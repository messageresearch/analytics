[9:42] um i know most of the young people here
[9:44] went to um the camp in south carolina um
[9:48] both esther and zach made me sign up
[9:50] about five months ago
[9:52] um
[9:53] and i never i had i went to the very
[9:55] first camp i ever went to was in 2014
[9:58] and it wasn't a very good experience so
[10:00] but i really wanted to put myself out
[10:01] there because god has been really
[10:03] working on me the last couple months
[10:05] and um
[10:06] you know
[10:07] i went through a lot two years ago and
[10:09] that kind of closed my heart to the
[10:10] things of god
[10:12] and so the last six months or so i
[10:14] couldn't figure out why i was so
[10:15] sensitive
[10:16] to
[10:17] you know the word and preaching and
[10:19] it's like every time i would really
[10:21] listen i would let's just cry
[10:23] and i couldn't figure out why but um
[10:26] you know i kind of was just trying to be
[10:28] open to it and accepting it and just
[10:30] letting god work for the first time in
[10:32] my life that strong
[10:35] so during the camp i knew like something
[10:37] was going to had to happen
[10:41] and so
[10:42] that first night i was so emotional and
[10:44] i was like you know god i'm not gonna
[10:46] leave this camp the same i knew it
[10:48] but um
[10:50] the saturday night
[10:53] something was just the atmosphere when
[10:54] we walked in was just different
[10:56] and so i knew like i was so determined
[10:59] because i knew i needed the holy ghost i
[11:01] was so determined that i told my i told
[11:02] god i'm not leaving this service without
[11:05] it
[11:06] and so uh
[11:07] like they had a prayer line and i knew i
[11:09] wanted to be that like within the first
[11:10] three people in that prayer line but um
[11:14] you know i i sat there for about an hour
[11:16] just praying and feeling exhausted and
[11:18] by the end of it i knew i had it so i
[11:20] just wanted to give that to that
[11:21] testimony of that

[44:00] called the internet we didn't have a
[44:01] thing called uh
[44:03] the cameras and the online streaming and
[44:06] then god sent us a group of holy
[44:08] ghost-filled people
[44:17] to get the word out to our brothers in
[44:19] different places in the world in the
[44:21] country so
[44:22] it's all the glory goes to god

[49:45] name of jesus christ we pray
[49:47] amen
[49:49] who is this son of man
[49:51] john 1 1 we're going to get to something
[49:53] a little bit in the book of luke and
[49:57] something i want to really really touch
[49:58] on in the beginning was the word
[50:00] the word was with god the word was god
[50:03] the same was in the beginning with god
[50:06] all things were made by him and without
[50:08] him was not anything made
[50:10] that was made in him was life and life
[50:13] was the light of men and the light
[50:15] shineth in darkness and the darkness
[50:16] comprehended it not
[50:18] that was a man sent from god whose name
[50:20] was john there had to be a messenger
[50:23] bring a
[50:24] message or we wouldn't understood who
[50:27] this person was amen there had to be
[50:29] somebody in the end time bring a message
[50:32] to help us understand
[50:34] this one that came amen that christ is
[50:37] here
[50:38] the same came for a witness to bear
[50:40] witness of the light that all men
[50:41] through him might believe he was not
[50:43] that light but was sent to bear witness
[50:45] of that light amen he wasn't the light
[50:47] but he bore witness of the light that
[50:49] all men through him might believe he was
[50:51] not that light but was sent to bear
[50:53] witness of that light
[50:55] that was the true light which lighteth
[50:56] every man that cometh into the world he
[50:58] was in the world the world was made by
[51:00] him and the world
[51:02] knew him not
[51:03] made the world and made the people
[51:04] standing in the world and they didn't
[51:06] know who he was
[51:07] he came unto his own he actually then he
[51:09] said i am he
[51:12] and they didn't believe that either
[51:14] they're not going to believe you either
[51:16] amen
[51:17] but as many as received him
[51:20] ask me in you
[51:21] but as many as received him
[51:24] amen
[51:25] because we had to receive him
[51:28] wasn't born special
[51:30] born in sin shaping iniquity dying
[51:34] we received him
[51:37] to them gave he power to become the sons
[51:40] of god even to them that believe on his
[51:42] name which were born not of blood nor
[51:44] the will of the flesh nor the will of
[51:45] man
[51:46] but of god
[51:47] so it has nothing to do with your
[51:49] natural birth
[51:50] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[51:52] among us and we beheld his glory as the
[51:53] glory of the only begotten of the father
[51:55] full
[51:56] of grace and truth you may be seated now
[51:58] i want you to look that word full
[52:00] because remember he was the fullness
[52:03] of the godhead bodily there was no part
[52:06] of him that was not god
[52:10] show me one
[52:11] there wasn't a part of him even his
[52:13] flesh
[52:14] that was
[52:16] rotting
[52:18] or deteriorating or dying
[52:21] that body came from god
[52:23] that body was god
[52:26] amen
[52:27] but it was born in a way that you and i
[52:30] can see that he was born a man
[52:34] a human mortal
[52:36] so he could taste death for me and you
[52:37] he couldn't taste death as the son of
[52:39] god he couldn't taste death as the great
[52:41] elohim or or all the great titles
[52:44] excuse me they gave him in the old
[52:46] testament
[52:47] he had to come as man
[52:50] a baby see even adam as great as adam
[52:53] was adam was called the son of god
[52:57] that's fine because he had the he had
[52:59] the holy ghost in his soul amen
[53:03] but his body's what died
[53:05] amen his spirit realm is where he fell
[53:07] he didn't he didn't fall in his soul
[53:10] he fell in his spirit realm because
[53:12] listen if you're born again you can't
[53:14] fall in your soul
[53:16] impossible
[53:19] for god to fall
[53:20] because that's who it is
[53:23] it's that by the transforming power of
[53:25] god god's in there now
[53:27] that's what i hope we understand is we
[53:29] we've already got what people are
[53:31] looking for
[53:33] hello somebody we've already got what
[53:36] people are looking for
[53:37] and we're not using it
[53:42] we've got it so wrapped up inside of our
[53:44] memories and conscious affection
[53:45] imagination and our flesh and all these
[53:48] different things
[53:49] we got to let it go
[53:52] we got we got us but we got to start
[53:53] somewhere you can't just say well i got
[53:56] it all when i believe you got everything
[53:58] you needed to believe more
[54:00] but you didn't get all you got
[54:02] everything you needed to believe more
[54:04] hey man i was listening to a
[54:06] denominational preacher
[54:11] and actually got some out of his sermon
[54:13] but he was talking on the statue of a
[54:15] perfect man
[54:17] and he made this statement and i thought
[54:18] man how profound he said
[54:21] he's talking about fruits of the spirit
[54:23] everybody talks about fruits to the
[54:24] spirit right where does that fruit come
[54:26] from
[54:28] he said the fruit
[54:30] is in the root
[54:34] think about it
[54:36] it didn't just pop up on the end of a
[54:38] the bud didn't just pop up on the end of
[54:40] the of the stick that goes out there you
[54:42] know because god says i'm the vine
[54:45] where's the vine
[54:46] the vine's what's plugged into the
[54:48] ground
[54:49] i am the vine you are the branches so we
[54:52] start at the bottom of the statue of
[54:53] perfect man
[54:55] the root
[54:57] and whatever that root is
[54:59] that's what we're going to be
[55:01] so that fruit comes from the power of
[55:03] the root all that energy comes from the
[55:06] root you say no it comes from
[55:07] photosynthesis it comes from the leaf
[55:09] well that leaf has to talk to the
[55:12] root
[55:14] and the root has to say i'm going to
[55:15] release the energy to go up to that
[55:18] plant so that's a good thing
[55:20] sometimes you might all listen to a
[55:22] denominational preacher you might get
[55:23] something but the fruit's in the roots
[55:26] that's the same way the fruit where do
[55:28] these fruits of the spirit come from
[55:30] the root cause
[55:32] is because this son of man came on earth
[55:34] and showed us how to live them
[55:37] amen
[55:38] unless he dies see he said unless a
[55:41] grain of wheat die
[55:42] and go into the ground well now
[55:45] what's the first thing it starts growing
[55:46] what attaches
[55:48] that seed to the ground
[55:50] a root
[55:52] the root comes out and that's where the
[55:54] power comes from is when that root
[55:56] starts absorbing
[56:00] the 16 elements
[56:03] the dirt
[56:04] and then what
[56:05] produces itself
[56:07] amen
[56:08] so i thought that was pretty good but
[56:10] that but god had to provide a body
[56:13] let's go to hebrews 10 verse 1. we've
[56:15] read this before let's read this again
[56:17] but for the law having a shadow of good
[56:18] things to come and not the very image of
[56:20] the thing can never
[56:21] with those sacrifices which they offered
[56:23] year by year continually make the comer
[56:26] there unto perfect in other words there
[56:27] was no root
[56:31] jesus christ was the root your holy
[56:33] ghost that's where everything comes from
[56:35] that wasn't in the old testament there
[56:36] was no holy ghost in the old testament
[56:39] there was an anointing they got an
[56:41] anointing and that's why that they
[56:42] couldn't fulfill the fruits of the
[56:43] spirit that's why they couldn't fulfill
[56:45] all the word of god like you and i can
[56:49] you know it's great for to see the the
[56:51] two guys that uh that walked in the road
[56:53] to them on the road to emmaus and jesus
[56:56] just absolutely told them
[56:58] he was telling them he went through all
[56:59] the scriptures and but he wasn't in them
[57:02] he was a man talking to him and he said
[57:04] oh did our hearts burn within us well
[57:06] then that man
[57:07] is in your heart today
[57:10] it ought to burn more than that it ought
[57:12] to burn your whole being
[57:14] if it burned in their hearts that a
[57:15] person
[57:17] was telling them what the old testament
[57:18] was and who he was that one person is
[57:20] now inside of you that's why i said the
[57:22] first of the year you need to let out
[57:24] what you got inside i don't care whether
[57:26] it's good or bad
[57:28] if i got something bad in me i want it
[57:29] out
[57:31] let it out
[57:32] but i do want what's good inside of me
[57:34] to be let out also
[57:36] so the world can see who we are
[57:39] amen we can say message believers all we
[57:41] want to
[57:45] we have a holy ghost on our spirit every
[57:48] day of our life and die and go to hell
[57:50] you can say brother byron said it a
[57:51] million times because you know what
[57:53] that's what's going to happen
[57:54] when they come up to him in the end time
[57:56] and they say have i not
[57:58] preached the message of the hour
[58:01] have i not cast out devils in your name
[58:04] he said depart from me i never knew you
[58:06] in other words you never
[58:07] you never got me inside your soul
[58:10] you thought you did you got a good
[58:11] anointing that some preacher told you
[58:13] you were okay
[58:16] we're not okay
[58:17] we're getting okay
[58:19] but we got the one that's okay inside of
[58:21] us if we got that residing inside of us
[58:24] then we can make it
[58:26] [Applause]
[58:27] but not in the old testament it couldn't
[58:29] make them perfect there was nothing
[58:31] there was nothing to there was no power
[58:34] to make man stop doing what they were
[58:36] doing
[58:37] all right
[58:38] for then would they not have ceased to
[58:39] been offered in other words one
[58:41] sacrifice and done because that the
[58:43] worshiper once purged should have had no
[58:45] more conscious of sins
[58:49] now
[58:51] do we have conscious of sins
[58:58] you say yes
[59:00] but you should say no
[59:03] because your soul can't sin
[59:05] if you're born again there's no
[59:07] conscience of sin and if you if you sin
[59:09] brother brown said you send a sin you're
[59:11] going to read pitfall where are you
[59:12] standing from you remember reason
[59:13] conscious affects your imagination
[59:16] your human nature
[59:18] it's where you're doing that from but
[59:20] listen and that guy's inside of you
[59:22] going don't do that don't do that hello
[59:25] don't do that don't do that and if you
[59:27] do do it though who's the one that get
[59:29] that condemns you that one that's inside
[59:33] he's the he's when it condemns you and
[59:35] then you're different from the world
[59:37] because we used to do the things we used
[59:39] to do and we it didn't bother us
[59:42] there was nothing inside
[59:44] except him
[59:46] and he said that's okay
[59:49] right
[59:51] but now that you've got the holy ghost
[59:52] inside of you what's he saying you need
[59:54] to repent
[59:56] you need to repent the devil never while
[59:58] i was out in the world for 20 years the
[59:59] devil never come to me and said you need
[1:00:02] to repent
[1:00:03] did he did your devil do the same thing
[1:00:05] maybe your devil's different than mine
[1:00:08] maybe you got a different they got one
[1:00:09] different ohio
[1:00:10] no same devil okay all right i just want
[1:00:12] to make sure it wasn't just a georgia
[1:00:14] thing because remember the devil went
[1:00:15] down to georgia
[1:00:16] and um
[1:00:22] where'd that come from what
[1:00:24] that's in this fire some other spiral
[1:00:25] book it ain't this one but look look
[1:00:29] it's not the bible telling us though
[1:00:31] that if
[1:00:33] the worshiper once purged should have
[1:00:36] had no more conscious of sins
[1:00:40] paul's telling us they did have a
[1:00:43] conscience of sin because there was
[1:00:44] nothing to perfect them but now that
[1:00:46] perfection has some has the son of man
[1:00:49] come died
[1:00:51] left us the statue of a perfect man left
[1:00:53] us the fruits of the spirit left us a
[1:00:56] way to walk like he walked
[1:01:00] had a guy um
[1:01:02] friday at the wedding they were
[1:01:05] um they were all there both of them are
[1:01:07] greeks because lia is a greek
[1:01:09] and most of them are greek orthodox and
[1:01:11] i want to know the difference between
[1:01:12] greek orthodox and roman catholic church
[1:01:14] because they're close but they're
[1:01:16] they're totally separate but he kept
[1:01:18] reverting back to that same thing he
[1:01:20] said also we can't help it because i
[1:01:21] told him he said well what do y'all
[1:01:22] believe i said well i said we teach
[1:01:25] what's in the bible
[1:01:27] you know folks and this is way off my
[1:01:29] subject but we're going to stay on this
[1:01:30] for a minute you know i was thinking the
[1:01:32] other day you we're the only people that
[1:01:34] can take the bible
[1:01:38] of god
[1:01:39] now everybody's preaching it today but
[1:01:41] we can take this word of god and hand it
[1:01:43] to somebody and say show me
[1:01:46] where i'm not doing
[1:01:48] what's in the bible
[1:01:51] right show me amen
[1:01:53] we believe in one god
[1:01:55] we don't believe in eternal hell it's
[1:01:57] not even in the bible
[1:01:59] so what am i telling what i told that
[1:02:01] guy said you build a lot of your
[1:02:03] religion on tradition
[1:02:06] and he agreed
[1:02:08] because that's what the roman catholic
[1:02:09] church they a lot of theirs is tradition
[1:02:11] you can't get it out of the bible
[1:02:13] that that mary was the mother of god and
[1:02:16] and the even that she was she you know
[1:02:19] the roman catholics teach that she was
[1:02:20] immaculately conceived also
[1:02:23] in other words she was conceived
[1:02:26] from a virgin
[1:02:28] which made her a virgin and then god and
[1:02:31] then i'm like no
[1:02:33] i ain't buying that i said where'd that
[1:02:35] come out of the bible
[1:02:36] and my bible says mary went to the upper
[1:02:39] room
[1:02:40] why did she go the upper room if she was
[1:02:42] god
[1:02:44] she needed god
[1:02:46] she bore the seed but she wasn't
[1:02:48] deceived
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:51] amen
[1:02:53] so i asked him and he kept saying well
[1:02:55] we're not perfect well we're not perfect
[1:02:57] i said that's not what this bible tells
[1:03:00] me
[1:03:01] your traditions tell you
[1:03:05] you can't be perfect
[1:03:07] your tradition
[1:03:10] now what did you know i never said this
[1:03:11] but i thought man didn't jesus stand one
[1:03:14] day and tell the very religious people
[1:03:16] of the world that he came to he said
[1:03:18] your traditions is what's killing you
[1:03:22] you've made a non-effect
[1:03:24] by your traditions he was telling them
[1:03:27] he said you've took the old testament
[1:03:28] and made it of none of faith because of
[1:03:30] your tradition
[1:03:32] so he said so you believe what's in the
[1:03:34] bible i said look i said whatever we
[1:03:36] preach
[1:03:37] we have it in the bible
[1:03:40] it's not in the catechism it's not
[1:03:42] enough and he was talking about how they
[1:03:43] recite the apostles creed and all that i
[1:03:46] said that's not even in the bible
[1:03:49] i said let's if we stay with the bible
[1:03:51] we got to be somewhere close to being
[1:03:52] perfect
[1:03:54] all right
[1:03:55] you can stay out there with your
[1:03:57] tradition which tells you you can't be
[1:03:58] perfect
[1:04:01] but right here he said because that the
[1:04:03] worshiper once purged
[1:04:05] now when you receive the new birth does
[1:04:07] that mean you have been once purged
[1:04:09] you don't get you don't get the baptism
[1:04:11] of the holy ghost in your soul as the
[1:04:13] new birth and then you got to have it
[1:04:14] again and you lose it tomorrow
[1:04:17] no
[1:04:18] one and done
[1:04:19] amen because you're sealed
[1:04:23] you're sealed the book is sealed
[1:04:24] everything's sealed inside of you but if
[1:04:27] the worshiper wants purge should have no
[1:04:28] more conscious of sins
[1:04:31] but in those sacrifices there is a
[1:04:33] remembrance again made of sins every
[1:04:35] year so because you've got to take the
[1:04:36] lamb because you've got to meet the high
[1:04:38] priest because you got to put the thing
[1:04:40] on there and they got to kill it and the
[1:04:42] blood goes everywhere and you say okay
[1:04:44] i'm fine but when the person turns and
[1:04:45] walks back out
[1:04:47] he's going to send the same sin again
[1:04:50] now folks if we keep sending the same
[1:04:52] sin again
[1:04:54] you need the new birth
[1:04:57] you don't just need to go up the statue
[1:04:59] a perfect man
[1:05:00] you need to get you need to get some
[1:05:02] power in your root
[1:05:04] you need to get the root inside of you
[1:05:07] that's the seed i like plant that seed
[1:05:09] and give it some root amen
[1:05:12] but what is the seed the word of god
[1:05:15] really simple really simple but in those
[1:05:18] sacrifices there's remembrance again
[1:05:19] made of sins every year
[1:05:21] for it is not possible that the blood of
[1:05:23] bulls and of goats should take away sins
[1:05:26] it's not possible
[1:05:28] there's no way
[1:05:30] it's a substitute it helped until christ
[1:05:33] got here it helped until the son of man
[1:05:35] walked on earth
[1:05:36] amen
[1:05:39] but i'm telling you
[1:05:40] you can't get your sins forgiven without
[1:05:43] jesus christ
[1:05:45] never
[1:05:47] there's nobody powerful enough to do
[1:05:49] that you know i'm going to i'm going to
[1:05:51] read you next a couple of sundays from
[1:05:52] now
[1:05:54] jesus kept telling them he said i want
[1:05:56] you to know
[1:05:58] i want you to know several times in the
[1:06:01] in the gospels
[1:06:03] that the son of man
[1:06:05] is here and can forgive sins
[1:06:10] and that's why they hated him because
[1:06:12] here's these
[1:06:13] priests high priest
[1:06:15] they're under bulls and goats and they
[1:06:17] keep doing the same thing everybody else
[1:06:18] does
[1:06:20] and this man walks up
[1:06:23] and he says
[1:06:25] who can convince me of sin
[1:06:27] convince me
[1:06:29] who can convince me of sin i don't do
[1:06:32] the things you do i don't go by
[1:06:33] tradition i live by the word of god
[1:06:36] and then the people are like well you
[1:06:38] know you're you're a man making yourself
[1:06:40] god
[1:06:41] no god made yourself a man
[1:06:44] now what's the difference in you i know
[1:06:46] there's a difference in you and in god
[1:06:48] we were born
[1:06:50] in sin
[1:06:51] we have a sinful nature which is our
[1:06:54] memory reason conscious effects and
[1:06:55] imagination now jesus did not
[1:07:00] because he knew no sin
[1:07:03] he didn't have a carnal mind he couldn't
[1:07:04] look back and say i know what my mom and
[1:07:06] daddy did to get me here
[1:07:08] see that makes the ball rolling right
[1:07:10] there
[1:07:11] because you do you do we do the same
[1:07:12] thing well i do this because
[1:07:15] my daddy don't you blame your daddy
[1:07:18] brother license but nobody bless you
[1:07:21] brother you didn't make these two the
[1:07:22] way they are
[1:07:24] they did it theirself
[1:07:27] he's going to go sure boy
[1:07:30] but it's not possible that the blood of
[1:07:31] bulls and ghosts take away sin wherefore
[1:07:33] when he cometh into the world
[1:07:35] listen
[1:07:37] he didn't build a soul
[1:07:42] he didn't build a soul
[1:07:44] he always was a soul
[1:07:48] amen the theophany of god
[1:07:52] but he had to build a
[1:07:54] body he had to build a 16 element body
[1:07:57] so he could be our brother
[1:08:00] so we could look at him and he could
[1:08:02] look at us
[1:08:04] and he said unless you believe that i am
[1:08:06] he
[1:08:07] you'll die in your sins
[1:08:10] well listen you know what
[1:08:13] they didn't believe who he was
[1:08:15] so they died in their sins
[1:08:17] because that's what he told them he said
[1:08:19] don't you he said i i've come to this
[1:08:21] earth
[1:08:22] to forgive your sins
[1:08:25] and you're turning me down in other
[1:08:26] words he knew that he was going to kill
[1:08:28] him somewhere eventually down the road
[1:08:29] they were going to kill him he's going
[1:08:30] to have to die for him
[1:08:32] but a body has to help prepared me
[1:08:35] a body a flesh body that's what connects
[1:08:37] the son of man
[1:08:38] with this whole thing the whole human
[1:08:40] race
[1:08:41] is that he came in human flesh
[1:08:43] and he was born
[1:08:45] virgin born though but he was born
[1:08:48] but watch what he did let's read this
[1:08:50] real quick number one in the masterpiece
[1:08:53] then come finally the great head the
[1:08:55] head of all of it the rest of the body
[1:08:57] just spoke of it the foundation was laid
[1:08:59] by the patriarch but the body was built
[1:09:01] by the word which was the prophets in
[1:09:03] other words he stepped out
[1:09:05] on their prophecy didn't miss it by one
[1:09:07] scripture actually didn't miss it by one
[1:09:09] word you know if he would have come one
[1:09:10] word off he couldn't have been our
[1:09:12] savior
[1:09:14] he didn't miss it by one word
[1:09:17] now
[1:09:18] you say we don't say but you say well we
[1:09:21] can't be perfected
[1:09:22] why can't we be perfected when you've
[1:09:24] got the one that is perfect inside of
[1:09:26] you
[1:09:27] we're just not letting that thing out
[1:09:29] and using it
[1:09:31] that's the whole problem
[1:09:33] why because our carnal mind says we
[1:09:35] can't
[1:09:36] or i did or i must have
[1:09:40] that's tradition that's not what the
[1:09:42] bible says
[1:09:43] that's a tradition somebody has taught
[1:09:45] you
[1:09:47] and it's wrong
[1:09:49] it's wrong
[1:09:51] anything outside the word of god is
[1:09:52] wrong
[1:09:54] and sure the bible does say you were
[1:09:55] born and sin shaped and iniquity but i
[1:09:57] can read you thousands of others that
[1:09:59] says you're perfect
[1:10:01] sinless
[1:10:02] brother brown i'm invisible union he
[1:10:04] said
[1:10:07] a sinless bride
[1:10:09] is going to be presented to god
[1:10:12] not over yonder
[1:10:14] right here
[1:10:16] right here
[1:10:17] because look the union's not over yonder
[1:10:21] if you don't get married here
[1:10:26] you're not gonna get married over there
[1:10:30] the union happens on earth while you're
[1:10:32] in human flesh
[1:10:36] and i know we beat the human flesh a lot
[1:10:38] we do but and and it is it is it is our
[1:10:41] problem it's the the spirit and the
[1:10:43] flesh part but
[1:10:47] god
[1:10:48] knew
[1:10:49] what it would take
[1:10:51] to get us back
[1:10:55] and he used human flesh why didn't he
[1:10:58] just send an angel
[1:11:00] why didn't he just say all right
[1:11:02] brother dardy you're going to be an
[1:11:04] angel and you're not going to have no
[1:11:05] sin
[1:11:07] well guess what
[1:11:09] i believe god created those angels and i
[1:11:11] believe some of them sinned
[1:11:14] did they not
[1:11:16] they believed the devil's lie
[1:11:18] and now they're his subjects
[1:11:20] so that ain't gonna protect you even if
[1:11:22] you come here an angel
[1:11:23] you still got a choice to make
[1:11:26] satan made a choice
[1:11:30] you know what god made a choice too
[1:11:33] god could have stood up in the in the
[1:11:34] heavens with his arms folded and said i
[1:11:36] don't need any of you to exist
[1:11:39] and he would be telling the truth
[1:11:43] he doesn't even need air
[1:11:46] he just doesn't need us
[1:11:47] but he wants us
[1:11:50] because we came from here
[1:11:52] everything came from the what the root
[1:11:54] amen i am the vine
[1:11:57] you are the branches but the body was
[1:11:58] built by the word which was the prophets
[1:12:00] and here comes the head of it all
[1:12:01] jesus came on the scene when this head
[1:12:03] piece was put on it we find in him the
[1:12:06] entire work of god
[1:12:08] we find in him the perfect reflection of
[1:12:10] the word for he was the word the
[1:12:13] fullness of the word now look now again
[1:12:16] god has the perfect masterpiece again
[1:12:19] who's he talking about in the
[1:12:20] masterpiece he's not talking about only
[1:12:22] jesus christ
[1:12:24] he's talking about his bride
[1:12:26] the body that's been prepared for jesus
[1:12:30] which is not the physical body it's me
[1:12:32] and you
[1:12:33] you know why because he chose it
[1:12:36] that's his choice
[1:12:38] to be a savior redeemer healer that's
[1:12:41] his choice he made a choice
[1:12:44] isaiah 7 13 says behold the virgin shall
[1:12:47] conceive and bear son
[1:12:48] shall call his name emmanuel that's how
[1:12:51] he got here
[1:12:52] isaiah 9 6 unto us a child is born unto
[1:12:54] us the son is given
[1:12:56] tells the government shall be on his
[1:12:58] shoulder and all these different things
[1:13:00] all these great like the like the song
[1:13:02] was talking about crowns i was thinking
[1:13:04] about that when we were singing that
[1:13:05] psalm
[1:13:06] how great is our god we're really not
[1:13:09] going to know
[1:13:11] until we get there
[1:13:13] the fullness
[1:13:15] we're just going to get enough to get us
[1:13:16] out of here
[1:13:18] and then we've got an eternity
[1:13:21] to learn about this god
[1:13:23] that we're talking a little bit about
[1:13:25] today and a little bit about tomorrow
[1:13:27] and a little bit about when you talk to
[1:13:29] him you're going just enough to know the
[1:13:33] the magnitude
[1:13:34] of what he's going to do for us
[1:13:37] the bible says i has not seen ear has
[1:13:39] not heard or entered in the heart of man
[1:13:41] we can't we can't comprehend because you
[1:13:43] know what we're all thinking now well i
[1:13:45] got to go to work tomorrow
[1:13:46] well i got to do this tomorrow i got to
[1:13:47] pay bills tomorrow i got to do this but
[1:13:49] what about a day when that's not going
[1:13:50] to happen anymore
[1:13:53] but you know what if you don't get
[1:13:54] prepared now
[1:13:56] you're not going to meet that
[1:13:58] you're going to meet torment that you're
[1:14:00] not going to be ever able to get relief
[1:14:02] from that
[1:14:04] think about it young people i'm not
[1:14:05] trying to scare you but i'm telling you
[1:14:07] if you don't know god
[1:14:09] it's horrible
[1:14:11] horrible
[1:14:13] but i know listen when i was at lewis
[1:14:14] when we was out in the world we didn't
[1:14:15] think about god every day
[1:14:18] no
[1:14:19] so we had to come to a time i'm telling
[1:14:21] you we all had to come to a time to
[1:14:22] where god said okay that's enough you
[1:14:24] got to make a choice today
[1:14:26] but listen don't miss that choice
[1:14:28] don't miss that day don't miss that
[1:14:30] visitation
[1:14:32] of god coming to you and say hey
[1:14:35] let me in
[1:14:36] amen because i want to be in your flesh
[1:14:39] i came in flesh so i could be in your
[1:14:41] flesh the only person that can do that
[1:14:44] isaiah 53 said he was taken from prison
[1:14:46] and from judgment who shall declare his
[1:14:48] generation as we were talking about
[1:14:50] before he could have been a he could
[1:14:51] have he was a human mortal man he could
[1:14:53] have had he could have had a progeny he
[1:14:55] could have had a line of children but he
[1:14:57] knew that's what was killed he knew they
[1:14:59] were they would die
[1:15:01] they would die
[1:15:03] because everybody was born a man is
[1:15:06] full of days or in other words they're
[1:15:08] dead but he's told nicodemus he said now
[1:15:11] you've got to be born from above
[1:15:13] he said if we can get you born from
[1:15:14] above he said i can give you eternal
[1:15:16] life and said we can just continue on
[1:15:18] and on that's what he's saying here he
[1:15:20] was cut off of the land of the living
[1:15:22] but the transgression of my people was
[1:15:23] he stricken
[1:15:25] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:15:26] with the rich in his death because he
[1:15:27] had done no violence
[1:15:30] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he
[1:15:32] has put him to grief look when thou
[1:15:34] shalt make his soul
[1:15:35] his soul
[1:15:37] an offering for sin
[1:15:39] like i said before
[1:15:40] and don't get me wrong but you have to
[1:15:42] pull jesus apart
[1:15:45] and see what the body did for us
[1:15:47] the spirit did for us and the soul did
[1:15:49] for us because the soul the body of
[1:15:53] listen the body of jesus can't come back
[1:15:54] inside of you
[1:15:57] it was a perpetuation though according
[1:16:00] to the old testament it was the
[1:16:02] sacrifice the flesh sacrifice
[1:16:05] everybody with me it was the flesh
[1:16:07] sacrifice behold the lamb of god what's
[1:16:09] a lamb a lamb and flesh
[1:16:11] flesh had to be given every sacrifice
[1:16:14] except for the meat offering in certain
[1:16:16] ones was flesh
[1:16:18] amen because they fell in flesh in the
[1:16:20] garden of eden
[1:16:22] so now we got to come back in flesh
[1:16:24] and clean this thing up jesus christ and
[1:16:27] then he's going to make his soul an
[1:16:29] offering for sin it was his soul his
[1:16:32] person is what is before the throne not
[1:16:35] the body
[1:16:38] amen his soul he gave his soul a ransom
[1:16:41] so he what
[1:16:43] for sin
[1:16:44] he shall see his seed in other words he
[1:16:46] shall see his progeny
[1:16:49] he shall see his seed
[1:16:54] he shall prolong his days and the
[1:16:56] pleasure of the lord shall prosper in
[1:16:57] his hand
[1:16:58] he shall see the what the travail of his
[1:17:00] soul again he don't talk about his body
[1:17:02] the travail of his soul
[1:17:04] listen he poured out his soul unto death
[1:17:07] that's what we're talking about right
[1:17:08] here therefore will i divide him a
[1:17:10] portion with the grain he shall divide
[1:17:11] the spoil with a strong because he has
[1:17:13] poured out his soul
[1:17:15] unto death
[1:17:19] you know you look and you see brother
[1:17:21] brown said one time he said god died
[1:17:24] and then he said god can't die amen
[1:17:27] well you can do that you're going to
[1:17:29] read in between the lines
[1:17:31] god played the part of death
[1:17:34] because you can't kill god
[1:17:35] but jesus died
[1:17:38] he said that's the same person yes but
[1:17:40] watch the manifestation
[1:17:42] when jesus died on the cross that soul
[1:17:45] came out of jesus
[1:17:47] which was god
[1:17:49] amen
[1:17:50] and it went and preached to the souls in
[1:17:51] prison we read that last week
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:56] but the body was what was put in the
[1:17:58] grave and it was d-e-a-d
[1:18:01] it was dead
[1:18:02] and if it hadn't been for david saying
[1:18:05] he'll not leave his soul in hell or
[1:18:06] suffer his holy one see corruption that
[1:18:08] body would have corrupted just like
[1:18:10] lazarus did right
[1:18:12] because it was a human body
[1:18:14] but that soul
[1:18:16] he made an offering with his soul
[1:18:19] and when that soul came back into that
[1:18:21] body it quickened his mortal body does
[1:18:24] that sound like a scripture that we've
[1:18:25] been talking about
[1:18:26] it quickened his mortal body and romans
[1:18:29] 8 says he's going to quicken your body
[1:18:31] the same way you quicken jesus's body
[1:18:34] why because it's the same spirit
[1:18:37] not a second person amen glory
[1:18:41] not two holy ghosts
[1:18:44] and the brother was telling me there
[1:18:45] about the
[1:18:46] uh catholic churches some they split the
[1:18:48] holy ghost and it just i said look it's
[1:18:50] real complicated
[1:18:53] these traditions are complicated
[1:18:56] i just read the bible
[1:18:58] where he said i'll give you the holy
[1:19:00] ghost well i just believe that
[1:19:02] i don't it ain't gotta be split up into
[1:19:04] whatever and make me do this and it
[1:19:06] don't make me do that and because you
[1:19:08] know you always go back to what he said
[1:19:10] ain't nobody perfect
[1:19:12] well i said that's not what my bible
[1:19:14] says
[1:19:16] you say i see you do
[1:19:18] please
[1:19:20] please come on
[1:19:24] if we don't start seeing that we are the
[1:19:26] sinless bride of jesus christ we'll just
[1:19:28] continue to stay here
[1:19:32] start believing
[1:19:34] don't worry about what you see
[1:19:36] start believing
[1:19:38] because it's already been said
[1:19:41] amen
[1:19:42] not going to change the bible
[1:19:44] we just got to start looking at it and
[1:19:46] saying well that's me
[1:19:49] devil i like what brother schroeder
[1:19:50] always said we had an older brother used
[1:19:52] to come to church here a long long time
[1:19:53] ago
[1:19:55] and he said devil
[1:19:56] if you're gonna look through my eyes and
[1:19:58] talk to me in my brain
[1:20:00] he said we're gonna read the bible
[1:20:04] we going to read the bible
[1:20:07] devil
[1:20:08] if you're going to play up here we're
[1:20:10] going to start reading the bible
[1:20:12] and he said that old devil just leave
[1:20:13] him well see the devil can't stand the
[1:20:15] word of god
[1:20:16] that's what we'll read here in just a
[1:20:17] few minutes when jesus went and was
[1:20:19] tempted the greatest temptation of 40
[1:20:21] days and 40 nights jesus by himself
[1:20:25] the devil quoted him scripture
[1:20:30] he didn't give him a tradition
[1:20:33] he quoted in the scripture
[1:20:35] but he misquoted
[1:20:37] he actually misrepresented the scripture
[1:20:40] because he had no revelation
[1:20:42] all right so let's continue on here just
[1:20:44] for a few minutes everybody all right
[1:20:46] it's not even 12 o'clock yet
[1:20:47] luke 1 verse 30
[1:20:49] behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[1:20:51] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:20:52] name jesus and he shall be great and
[1:20:55] call the son of the highest and the lord
[1:20:57] god shall give unto him the throne of
[1:20:58] his father david he shall reign over the
[1:21:00] house of jacob forever of his kingdom
[1:21:02] there shall be no end
[1:21:04] and then matthew 2
[1:21:06] verse 11 we know that the
[1:21:08] the wise men brought him three gifts
[1:21:10] gold frankincense and myrrh and why am i
[1:21:12] bringing this out because look
[1:21:15] deity
[1:21:18] they got a revelation
[1:21:21] there was something different about that
[1:21:22] child
[1:21:24] right i mean he was just a two-year-old
[1:21:26] kid sitting in the lap of the child i
[1:21:28] like my brother marcus he was almost
[1:21:29] preaching what we had preached last
[1:21:31] sunday you know about the two-year-old
[1:21:33] the baby being two years the baby wasn't
[1:21:35] a baby it wasn't a baby like this it was
[1:21:37] sitting in his mother's lap so it was a
[1:21:38] couple of years old
[1:21:40] but they brought gold frankincense and
[1:21:41] myrrh now it was a revelation they had
[1:21:44] deity brother brown talks about here and
[1:21:47] god's gift always find their place
[1:21:49] so now gold in the bible paragraph 52
[1:21:51] but fitting it
[1:21:53] fitting it fits to christ because gold
[1:21:55] speaks of deity the gold is deity we'll
[1:21:58] get to it in just a moment frankincense
[1:21:59] speaks of service
[1:22:01] and merged death so god deity in service
[1:22:03] to die and that's what he was the very
[1:22:06] thing that they brought identified what
[1:22:07] they thought he was
[1:22:10] now what's the same thing with me and
[1:22:12] you in our life
[1:22:14] let's think about this other day
[1:22:17] because we've got to start seeing that
[1:22:18] we we take jesus over here and we say
[1:22:20] well he was and we know there's we
[1:22:22] weren't virgin born okay
[1:22:26] but he learned by the things he suffered
[1:22:27] he was made perfect
[1:22:29] all these things we read about this god
[1:22:32] everybody with me
[1:22:34] everything we read about this god
[1:22:37] and we say that's just i'm it's
[1:22:39] unreachable
[1:22:40] no it's a total example of what you've
[1:22:43] got to go through
[1:22:46] because are you not deity if you're born
[1:22:48] again
[1:22:50] dedicated
[1:22:52] unto death unto death now listen there's
[1:22:54] some going to die but there's deity
[1:22:57] dedicated unto death
[1:23:00] they're not going to get all the way to
[1:23:02] it
[1:23:03] somebody's going to make a body change
[1:23:05] somebody is going to see that their god
[1:23:07] almighty and human flesh
[1:23:09] call the bride not a second person
[1:23:12] and they're going to stand up and say
[1:23:14] death
[1:23:15] you have no part with me because the one
[1:23:17] inside of me is greater than the death
[1:23:20] that you are bringing to me
[1:23:22] isn't that just real simple brother
[1:23:24] brown said he'll death will walk crawl
[1:23:25] up your sleeve and you just
[1:23:28] now how many of us really believe that
[1:23:32] you better start
[1:23:35] you better start
[1:23:36] it's not just a good thought
[1:23:39] no that's what i told the the traditions
[1:23:41] to tr the traditions that they believe
[1:23:43] in the catholic church and all the other
[1:23:45] roman that's that's just tradition
[1:23:47] that's just good thoughts
[1:23:49] because it's not god
[1:23:51] it's not it's
[1:23:52] you know when you can't have a trinity
[1:23:53] and all these different things and and
[1:23:55] communion with saints and dead saints
[1:23:57] and all that stuff you know you can't do
[1:23:59] that in our i think our sister
[1:24:01] um back there was come up in the
[1:24:03] catholic church
[1:24:04] typically didn't you come up in catholic
[1:24:06] church yeah some some of the ones here
[1:24:08] come up in in a little bit of
[1:24:09] catholicism and
[1:24:11] and it's uh
[1:24:13] it's different
[1:24:15] but it's tradition
[1:24:18] and it's hard to you know what
[1:24:21] truthfully if you were a devout catholic
[1:24:23] it's harder to live a devout catholic
[1:24:25] life than it is a christian life
[1:24:28] because you got all the every move you
[1:24:30] make you got to go to mass you got to go
[1:24:32] to this you got to do that you got to
[1:24:33] pray to that saint you got to pray to
[1:24:35] that saint if you're going to drive
[1:24:36] somewhere you got to pray today
[1:24:38] let's just pray to one god
[1:24:42] and he's my daddy
[1:24:44] and i feel comfortable talking to him
[1:24:47] and i don't have to go find a book to
[1:24:49] find out where he's at
[1:24:52] but that's but listen
[1:24:55] billions of people
[1:24:57] today
[1:24:58] believe that
[1:25:00] billions
[1:25:01] of catholic
[1:25:03] people believe that
[1:25:04] they're good people folks but now
[1:25:06] they're caught up in a bad situation
[1:25:09] everybody okay
[1:25:10] just pray for him
[1:25:12] i like what brother marcus said he said
[1:25:14] call him brother remember him when he
[1:25:16] said you call him brother he said you he
[1:25:17] said don't don't he said they're human
[1:25:19] beings and i want to take that point
[1:25:22] we're human beings
[1:25:23] i'm not talking about that guy i met the
[1:25:24] other day but look what he's caught up
[1:25:26] in
[1:25:28] now listen if he receives that he
[1:25:29] becomes that and there's nothing i can
[1:25:31] do about it but see the same way with me
[1:25:33] and you if we receive what's being
[1:25:35] preached to us
[1:25:36] and it's the truth
[1:25:38] and we become that what are we
[1:25:41] we're the manifestation of what this
[1:25:43] bible said amen we're not a tradition
[1:25:47] we're not a second person
[1:25:49] we don't need another something to come
[1:25:54] man
[1:25:56] think of how privileged we are
[1:25:57] everything we need has already come here
[1:26:01] totally available
[1:26:02] you can actually now put 1100 sermons in
[1:26:06] in that bottle cap
[1:26:08] if you had the right kind of little
[1:26:09] thing to put it in like the chip right
[1:26:12] right
[1:26:12] and that right there
[1:26:15] all 1100 sermons that used to be i
[1:26:17] didn't tell the brothers but this whole
[1:26:19] back wall right here when we first had
[1:26:20] the church this whole wall there was no
[1:26:22] door there whole wall
[1:26:24] was shells
[1:26:26] because this used to be a store building
[1:26:28] all the shelves had the sermons of the
[1:26:31] eight inch reel stacked one on top of
[1:26:33] each other from from bottom to top
[1:26:36] and people could check them out
[1:26:38] it was a library but it covered that
[1:26:40] whole wall and i don't think that that
[1:26:42] wasn't the whole that wasn't all 1100 of
[1:26:44] them was it mom no it was about maybe
[1:26:46] 800 something like that we didn't even
[1:26:47] have the whole volume
[1:26:49] and now you got it right here
[1:26:52] if you had to i mean if you listened to
[1:26:55] four sermons you had to get a box
[1:26:58] to put the tapes in
[1:26:59] and then the tape player
[1:27:02] was this big
[1:27:04] because the 8 inch reel that would be 16
[1:27:07] inches
[1:27:08] and it'd be this big and it only came up
[1:27:10] later on that they had batteries where
[1:27:11] you could carry it somewhere else you'd
[1:27:13] have to plug it in
[1:27:16] and i've seen daddy take and get the the
[1:27:19] um
[1:27:20] the belts
[1:27:22] were rubber
[1:27:23] and they start wearing out and they
[1:27:25] start slipping and the tape would get
[1:27:26] real
[1:27:30] and daddy would yeah i see sister
[1:27:32] tabitha i'm funny here too
[1:27:34] daddy would take a pencil and stick it
[1:27:36] inside that thing and start turning it
[1:27:39] to get it caught back up
[1:27:42] amen that's what we did to hear the
[1:27:44] message and now we got it on this right
[1:27:45] here and we don't listen
[1:27:47] we don't think we got everything we need
[1:27:50] when we got it right here we put it in

[1:28:34] there's your sign he was god and became
[1:28:36] man not rich man but poor man this is
[1:28:39] the super sign let's go on down to the
[1:28:41] red when that first little toothless
[1:28:43] mouth opened in that manger on that
[1:28:45] first crib first christmas morning in
[1:28:46] his little manger crib the first little
[1:28:48] yell that went out of his voice that was
[1:28:51] god
[1:28:51] crying
[1:28:54] you say that's impossible
[1:28:57] only god can do it
[1:28:59] only god can do that so we know that's
[1:29:01] god
[1:29:03] because only god can do that then he
[1:29:05] sent us a prophet to tell us exactly
[1:29:07] what he was
[1:29:08] so let's go to revelations 3 14. we know
[1:29:10] he grew up we knew we know he grew in
[1:29:12] grace and knowledge and we'll read that
[1:29:13] in just a minute
[1:29:15] you say jesus did yeah he was a human
[1:29:17] mortal man
[1:29:19] all right so let's go to revelation 3 14
[1:29:21] and to the angel of the church a lot of
[1:29:22] sins right these things saith the amen
[1:29:24] the faithful and true witness the
[1:29:26] beginning of the creation of god
[1:29:29] now we were talking about this last
[1:29:31] sunday let's cover it just a little bit
[1:29:32] more
[1:29:35] let's read the loudest in church age and
[1:29:37] then we'll make comments on it the 14th
[1:29:38] verse to the
[1:29:41] y'all stuck
[1:29:44] maybe they need to
[1:29:46] there we go
[1:29:48] okay the 14th verse to the third chapter
[1:29:51] of revelations unto the angel of the
[1:29:52] lord angel of laodicea write these
[1:29:55] things which saith the amen the faithful
[1:29:56] and true witness the beginning of the
[1:29:58] creation of god
[1:30:00] how odd would that sound the beginning
[1:30:02] of the creation of god oh my we got all
[1:30:05] if we had all night on that right now
[1:30:07] how the lord would reveal that to us
[1:30:08] watch
[1:30:09] the amen is the last
[1:30:11] he appears all the way down through the
[1:30:13] different things but here in the last
[1:30:14] church age why isn't he saying the first
[1:30:16] church age
[1:30:19] it was god
[1:30:21] the son of god in the church ages
[1:30:24] but he wasn't the fullness
[1:30:27] all the word hadn't been opened up yet
[1:30:30] we're going to look at that in just a
[1:30:31] minute
[1:30:33] we're going to see something that jesus
[1:30:35] did
[1:30:36] that told us the book was going to close
[1:30:38] up until he came back
[1:30:41] all right
[1:30:42] because it did remember it was closed
[1:30:45] the book was only open brother brown
[1:30:46] said revelations 10 7. revelations 5 it
[1:30:49] was closed revelations 10 it was open
[1:30:52] something happened in between that
[1:30:54] now to show that he was the first
[1:30:57] down at the bottom
[1:30:59] also as he was he's the beginning of the
[1:31:00] creation of god oh do you catch it how
[1:31:03] could god be created if he's a spirit
[1:31:07] well he couldn't because he's eternal
[1:31:10] he never was created he never will be
[1:31:12] created because he was god at the
[1:31:13] beginning
[1:31:14] same way with you
[1:31:19] you have to separate
[1:31:23] i see what began from your mama and
[1:31:26] daddy
[1:31:27] but remember
[1:31:29] as brother marcus was talking wednesday
[1:31:30] night i've never seen the real you
[1:31:33] that theophany that real you i've never
[1:31:35] seen i see the manifestation of it
[1:31:37] but if you're born again
[1:31:39] that always was
[1:31:41] it never had a beginning it never will
[1:31:44] have an end that's right amen
[1:31:47] but god had to somewhere develop
[1:31:51] when he was developing his plan
[1:31:54] and he had to come in human flesh
[1:31:56] everybody with me he had to come in
[1:31:58] human flesh he couldn't just be created
[1:32:01] human flesh though
[1:32:03] like melchizedek
[1:32:05] captain of the host right because that
[1:32:07] couldn't be your boaz
[1:32:10] boaz had to be a kinsmen
[1:32:12] in other words lineage
[1:32:15] jesus became lineage when he became the
[1:32:17] beginning of the creation of god
[1:32:20] there's when the lineage began the human
[1:32:23] lineage began
[1:32:25] all right with that the spiritual
[1:32:27] lineage
[1:32:28] never had a beginning
[1:32:31] never will have an end
[1:32:33] and then same thing with you
[1:32:36] what are we saying i'm a new what
[1:32:38] creation
[1:32:41] well brother john
[1:32:43] you look just the same you did before
[1:32:45] you got the new birth
[1:32:47] right
[1:32:48] but you're a new creation
[1:32:50] what that new creature
[1:32:54] that always was
[1:32:56] now resides in you because you let it in
[1:33:00] that's your choice
[1:33:02] but he didn't change this
[1:33:05] thank god for a prophet on the future
[1:33:06] home he said god's not going to destroy
[1:33:08] this earth
[1:33:12] listen talk to anybody out in the world
[1:33:15] this world this world so sinful god's
[1:33:17] going to just destroy it we're going to
[1:33:19] go live in heaven
[1:33:22] right
[1:33:24] we're all going to heaven it's the puffy
[1:33:26] cloud and it's i don't know what they're
[1:33:27] talking about
[1:33:30] i like living right here
[1:33:33] because i'm part of this
[1:33:35] and by the transforming power of god as
[1:33:37] he transforms me he's transformed the
[1:33:39] earth
[1:33:42] same power
[1:33:44] so thank god for a prophet that says oh
[1:33:46] he's gonna burn it off yes
[1:33:50] just like he burnt you off
[1:33:52] because john said i'm going to baptize
[1:33:54] you with what holy ghost and fire yes
[1:33:56] sir
[1:33:57] it's going to take the holy ghost it's
[1:33:59] going to take the holy ghost in fire
[1:34:02] to burn that oh you out
[1:34:05] and then put the new creation in
[1:34:07] but he had to begin somewhere so he can
[1:34:10] die for us
[1:34:13] our near kinsmen had to take our place
[1:34:17] melchizedek couldn't take our place
[1:34:20] the captain of the host couldn't take
[1:34:21] our place
[1:34:22] jesus
[1:34:24] was born just like you except for the
[1:34:26] conception
[1:34:29] 16 elements of the earth he was tied to
[1:34:32] his mama by umbilical cord
[1:34:36] had to eat when he got here
[1:34:39] had poopy diapers
[1:34:42] god yeah
[1:34:43] he decided he was going to be human
[1:34:47] because you know what then he could walk
[1:34:48] up and say hey i'm your brother
[1:34:51] i know what you're going through
[1:34:54] even the all-knowing god i've always
[1:34:56] thought the all-knowing god that knows
[1:34:58] everything
[1:35:00] every naf that's on the earth and by the
[1:35:02] sign how much tyler made this great god
[1:35:05] he decided he decided
[1:35:08] to understand you
[1:35:12] all knowing
[1:35:13] knew what your choice would be before he
[1:35:15] even got here
[1:35:18] yet he wanted to talk to you
[1:35:21] and get down to your level
[1:35:25] and still be god
[1:35:27] to me that's the beginning of the
[1:35:29] creation of god when that develops that
[1:35:31] we understand that that god yes it's not
[1:35:34] just a god that stands up in heaven with
[1:35:36] his arms folded
[1:35:38] no
[1:35:40] you ever get him in your heart you'll
[1:35:42] understand what i'm talking about
[1:35:44] because you won't if you don't
[1:35:47] he's just a theory or a thought
[1:35:49] or or or a ghost or a
[1:35:52] something that's not tangible
[1:35:54] but you get him inside of you
[1:35:56] i'll promise you you'll understand
[1:35:59] that when he he had to begin like you
[1:36:02] began
[1:36:03] but yet he was god
[1:36:06] but now look
[1:36:09] you by the new birth what do you become
[1:36:12] by this new creation
[1:36:17] you become god in human flesh
[1:36:20] called the bride
[1:36:22] amen so see what he done he came to
[1:36:24] earth
[1:36:26] and who was somebody read today being a
[1:36:28] little made a little lower than the
[1:36:29] angels
[1:36:30] that was jesus
[1:36:33] because even an angel couldn't couldn't
[1:36:35] save you
[1:36:36] as far as i know an angel can't create
[1:36:40] we were talking about the other day or
[1:36:41] yesterday last night
[1:36:43] you know the angel that came to brother
[1:36:45] branham said i have come from the
[1:36:47] presence of god
[1:36:49] right
[1:36:50] to bring you this
[1:36:51] right
[1:36:53] an angel walks in the room brother bryan
[1:36:55] said stood there with his arms folded
[1:36:57] about six foot tall
[1:36:59] dark complected he explains the whole
[1:37:01] thing
[1:37:02] there's no angel i ever seen
[1:37:04] all the angels we ever sees got the wing
[1:37:06] thingy and the thing around here and
[1:37:08] they're all white
[1:37:09] no
[1:37:10] no
[1:37:12] he sent him so that brother adam could
[1:37:14] understand
[1:37:15] who was talking to him but remember that
[1:37:17] angel never gave him a revelation
[1:37:20] never
[1:37:22] he never said the angel revealed to me
[1:37:25] he said the angel told me to look in
[1:37:28] this scripture the angel told me all
[1:37:30] these scriptures to put together and
[1:37:32] then brother branham was the one that
[1:37:33] had to get to revelation
[1:37:36] same way with me and you we may not see
[1:37:38] the guy walk in the room you know
[1:37:41] but trust me
[1:37:43] you have an angel
[1:37:45] sent from god
[1:37:46] if you're born again
[1:37:48] and he's with you all the time but he's
[1:37:50] not going to give you he's not your holy
[1:37:52] ghost that's right
[1:37:54] he's a god
[1:37:56] he's not your holy ghost but he's your
[1:37:58] guide
[1:37:59] how many times have you been reading
[1:38:00] something and you you what we were
[1:38:02] talking about the other day you read
[1:38:04] something and and you read it 100 times
[1:38:06] and
[1:38:08] all of a sudden
[1:38:09] it's like somebody wrote a brand new
[1:38:10] book
[1:38:12] or they added this chapter in here that
[1:38:14] you swear you read
[1:38:17] good grief
[1:38:18] you swear
[1:38:19] oh i have a new name now
[1:38:22] my name is charlie brown
[1:38:25] their dad
[1:38:26] because i say good grief all the time
[1:38:29] good grief charlie brown get it okay
[1:38:31] anyway
[1:38:32] so
[1:38:34] it's funny how people look at you
[1:38:35] different ways you know so
[1:38:37] that's all right that's okay with me we
[1:38:40] all have our little
[1:38:41] quirks
[1:38:43] but that but you look at that though
[1:38:46] what god did for us
[1:38:49] and then he sent us a guide
[1:38:52] sure he gave us the holy ghost inside of
[1:38:53] us but then brother brown said oh you've
[1:38:55] got an angel
[1:38:57] and you're reading the bible or you're
[1:38:58] reading something and and something says
[1:39:00] read that book again
[1:39:05] right
[1:39:06] somebody something says read that
[1:39:07] scripture again go back over the book of
[1:39:10] matthew
[1:39:13] well that may be that angel over there
[1:39:14] trying to flip the flip the pages for
[1:39:17] you and you're not wanting to
[1:39:19] amen
[1:39:22] but the beginning of the creation of god
[1:39:24] was jesus christ when he was made
[1:39:26] manifest when god lived in him he is
[1:39:29] god's creation oh my the first and the
[1:39:31] last the amen the beginning of the
[1:39:33] creation of god when god created himself
[1:39:36] a body but now remember he didn't just
[1:39:38] create himself a body from nothing
[1:39:40] everything god does this has a purpose
[1:39:41] because remember what was the body built
[1:39:43] built by the word of god
[1:39:46] built by even though it came through the
[1:39:49] womb of a woman even though it came
[1:39:51] human flesh and he had to eat and he did
[1:39:53] all the different things that humans had
[1:39:54] to do
[1:39:56] god built that body
[1:39:58] now see that's the difference in me and
[1:40:00] you are me and you and him
[1:40:02] your mom and daddy
[1:40:05] basically formed your body right
[1:40:09] god formed his body
[1:40:12] i'm going to tell you something though
[1:40:13] that body went through stuff that you'll
[1:40:15] never go through
[1:40:18] just for you
[1:40:19] so that you don't have to go through it
[1:40:22] so he came down and lived in it it's the
[1:40:24] beginning of the creation of god
[1:40:28] oh isn't he wonderful
[1:40:31] he created himself a body
[1:40:33] oh isn't
[1:40:35] he wonderful
[1:40:37] unless
[1:40:37] luke 2 verse 39 continue on and the
[1:40:40] child grew and whacked strong in spirit
[1:40:41] filled with wisdom
[1:40:43] and the grace of god was upon him
[1:40:46] as parents were in jerusalem every year
[1:40:47] the feast of passover
[1:40:49] when he was 12 years old they went to
[1:40:51] jerusalem after the custom of the feast
[1:40:54] when they had fulfilled the days as they
[1:40:56] returned the child jesus tarried behind
[1:40:58] in jerusalem and joseph and his mother
[1:41:00] knew not of it but they suppose him to
[1:41:02] be with the rest of the company in the
[1:41:04] crowd when a day's journey and they
[1:41:06] started him among their kinfolks and
[1:41:07] acquaintances
[1:41:09] and when they found him not they turned
[1:41:10] back into jerusalem seeking him and he
[1:41:13] came to pass that after three days
[1:41:15] always three
[1:41:16] after three days they found him where in
[1:41:18] the temple
[1:41:21] he wasn't building
[1:41:22] he didn't find him another
[1:41:24] carpenter shop and start working in it
[1:41:26] no he started doing his father's work
[1:41:30] sitting in the midst of the doctors both
[1:41:32] hearing them and asking them questions
[1:41:34] and all that heard him were astonished
[1:41:35] at his understanding and answers and
[1:41:37] when they saw him they were amazed and
[1:41:39] his mother said son why is thou dealt
[1:41:41] with us behold thy father and i have
[1:41:42] sought these sorrowing we know what
[1:41:44] brother brown said about that she denied
[1:41:45] the virgin birth
[1:41:47] well she didn't have the holy ghost
[1:41:51] you know how long ago
[1:41:54] and he said unto them how is it that you
[1:41:55] sought me i wish not that i must be
[1:41:58] about my father's business
[1:42:00] that's the same way with you and i
[1:42:03] we should be about the father's business
[1:42:06] and they understood not
[1:42:08] what a misunderstood guy
[1:42:10] they understood not the sayings which he
[1:42:12] spake unto them
[1:42:14] now here's mary like i said last night
[1:42:16] here's mary that knows for a fact she
[1:42:19] didn't have no relations with a man and
[1:42:20] this baby comes out
[1:42:23] it had to come from god
[1:42:26] and she can't understand verse 50 they
[1:42:28] understood not the sayings which you
[1:42:30] spoke unto them
[1:42:33] to me it's a little
[1:42:34] they just were deceived
[1:42:37] and he went down with them and came to
[1:42:38] nazareth and was subject unto them but
[1:42:40] his mother kept all these sayings in her
[1:42:42] heart and look here we go again and
[1:42:43] jesus increased in wisdom and stature
[1:42:45] and favor with god in men
[1:42:48] amen
[1:42:49] hebrews 5 verse 8
[1:42:52] a few minutes after 12 we're doing good
[1:42:54] though he were a son
[1:42:56] okay look though he were a son
[1:43:01] you
[1:43:02] though you were a son a child of god not
[1:43:04] a son of samuel peggy dale
[1:43:07] this is this is
[1:43:08] heading towards what we're going to talk
[1:43:10] about adoption because remember adoption
[1:43:11] is not your new birth
[1:43:14] you knew birth is what makes you the son
[1:43:17] puts you in the family
[1:43:19] have i got that
[1:43:21] we've been taught well we know that but
[1:43:24] then yet learned he obedience by the
[1:43:27] things which he suffered
[1:43:30] and being made perfect
[1:43:33] not in his soul
[1:43:38] in his humanity
[1:43:39] and being made perfect he became the
[1:43:41] author of eternal salvation
[1:43:44] unto all them that obey him called of
[1:43:46] god and high priest after the order not
[1:43:49] being melchized but after the order
[1:43:51] of melchizedek because jesus truly was a
[1:43:54] high priest
[1:43:57] he was he fulfilled every bit of it all
[1:43:59] right
[1:44:00] now matthew 3 verse 1. we talked about
[1:44:02] john the baptist
[1:44:04] and john the baptist we know he said
[1:44:05] repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is a
[1:44:07] hand
[1:44:09] and
[1:44:10] it's kind of interesting i was thinking
[1:44:12] about this the other day here john is
[1:44:14] preaching a message
[1:44:17] that he's never going to attain to
[1:44:21] think about it
[1:44:23] think about it
[1:44:24] because the least in the kingdom is
[1:44:25] greater than john
[1:44:27] john wasn't in the kingdom
[1:44:30] but he said repent
[1:44:31] for the kingdom of heaven is the hand
[1:44:34] the only thing he was then though there
[1:44:35] was his responsibility was to introduce
[1:44:37] the one that had the kingdom in him
[1:44:41] that was his job
[1:44:44] you see how a prophet has to stand you
[1:44:45] see how even brother branham was he was
[1:44:47] wanting so much on the seals and a
[1:44:50] different one he wanted people to see it
[1:44:53] he wanted people to enter into what he
[1:44:54] was preaching
[1:44:56] and then it finally got revealed to him
[1:44:59] this ain't the group that's going to get
[1:45:01] it
[1:45:03] wow
[1:45:05] see most of us would have just i'd have
[1:45:06] quit and went up in the mountains and
[1:45:08] you've never seen me again
[1:45:11] right
[1:45:12] but he just kept right on preaching
[1:45:14] get right on he knew there was something
[1:45:16] coming he john knew there was one coming
[1:45:19] john knew that one day because remember
[1:45:21] he hadn't met jesus yet
[1:45:23] but now he's going to meet him and the
[1:45:25] first thing john's going to say is
[1:45:26] behold the lamb of god that takes away
[1:45:29] the sin of the world
[1:45:33] matthew 3 verse 11
[1:45:35] i indeed baptize you with water and to
[1:45:37] repentance but he that cometh after me
[1:45:39] is mightier than i whose shoes i am not
[1:45:41] worthy to bear he shall baptize you with
[1:45:43] the holy ghost and with fire whose fan
[1:45:46] is in his hand and he will thoroughly
[1:45:47] purge his floor
[1:45:49] and gather his wheat in the garner but
[1:45:50] he will burn up the chaff with
[1:45:51] unquenchable fire
[1:45:53] then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan
[1:45:55] under john to be baptized
[1:45:57] but john forbade him saying i have need
[1:45:59] to be baptized of thee and cometh out of
[1:46:01] me jesus answered the sin unto him
[1:46:03] suffer it to be so now for thus it
[1:46:05] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[1:46:07] in other words then he baptized him what
[1:46:09] the prophet did god tell us
[1:46:11] he had to be washed
[1:46:13] the sacrifice had to be washed and jesus
[1:46:16] when he was baptized went up straight
[1:46:18] way out of the water although the
[1:46:19] heavens were opened unto him and he saw
[1:46:20] the spirit of god who saw
[1:46:22] john saw
[1:46:24] because he was going to be a witness and
[1:46:25] he saw the spirit of god descending like
[1:46:27] a dove and lighting on him and lower
[1:46:29] voice from heaven saying this is my
[1:46:31] beloved son in whom i'm well pleased now
[1:46:33] did not tell us the other day that's the
[1:46:35] same thing god when you receive the
[1:46:36] baptism and holy ghost
[1:46:39] when you receive the new birth sister
[1:46:41] lily
[1:46:43] man
[1:46:46] god
[1:46:48] is pleased
[1:46:50] to dwell in you now
[1:47:06] because god's only going to give the
[1:47:07] holy ghost
[1:47:08] to those that will keep it
[1:47:10] cherish it
[1:47:12] and develop it
[1:47:14] right
[1:47:15] he's not going to give you the holy
[1:47:16] ghost and then no
[1:47:18] a year from now not you
[1:47:20] know a year from now you're going to
[1:47:22] just leave no you never got the holy
[1:47:23] ghost to begin with
[1:47:25] because remember he's not going to give
[1:47:27] it to you take it away from you
[1:47:29] and he's going to give it to you because
[1:47:31] he sees that you're worthy
[1:47:33] you might not have been worthy
[1:47:35] 20 minutes before that
[1:47:37] because remember the unclean spirit goes
[1:47:39] out
[1:47:40] god's not going to dwell in an unclean
[1:47:41] vessel how many of these things are we
[1:47:43] and that's what gets me with all these
[1:47:44] people thinks we came here with this
[1:47:46] some great something in us
[1:47:48] no i was lost
[1:47:50] the things i did in the world god was
[1:47:52] not somehow
[1:47:56] his eyes was barred from it or i'd be
[1:47:58] dead
[1:47:59] yours too
[1:48:01] hello
[1:48:03] yours too
[1:48:04] but i'd be completely dead physically
[1:48:07] if the things i did god could see
[1:48:10] but he wasn't looking at that right
[1:48:12] god was looking at promise
[1:48:14] he was looking at a promise that one day
[1:48:16] you're going to be worthy i know you're
[1:48:18] going to be worthy because you chose me
[1:48:20] and i saw it before the foundation of
[1:48:22] the world so by foreknowledge
[1:48:25] i gave you something
[1:48:29] not at your birth
[1:48:31] there was something right here with you
[1:48:33] the whole time
[1:48:35] oh and sometimes we didn't listen to
[1:48:37] that
[1:48:38] right
[1:48:40] sometimes we didn't
[1:48:43] but he was right here
[1:48:45] he's wanting to give you the new birth
[1:48:46] more than you ever wanted
[1:48:50] more than you ever wanted because he's
[1:48:51] right here
[1:48:52] he's wanting to give it to you so bad
[1:48:54] yeah and what what stops us
[1:48:56] i me
[1:48:59] i mean me me and his other brother me
[1:49:04] and the other brother i
[1:49:07] because that what's stopping god if he
[1:49:09] wants to give it to you more than you
[1:49:10] want it who's stopping him
[1:49:12] you but you have to wait to get to a
[1:49:15] place now listen jesus
[1:49:19] had to wait to get to a place
[1:49:23] yes he did
[1:49:26] if he was the if he was going to be the
[1:49:28] priest
[1:49:29] to begin his ministry
[1:49:32] because i didn't i don't have it but
[1:49:33] it's in luke where the bible tells us
[1:49:35] that jesus becoming 30 he was almost 30
[1:49:37] years old you know priests cannot do
[1:49:39] anything in a
[1:49:41] in a temple
[1:49:42] unless he's 30 years old or becoming 30
[1:49:44] years old
[1:49:46] okay
[1:49:50] so he couldn't at 13 years old
[1:49:52] go and be baptized
[1:49:54] he had to wait till 29.
[1:49:57] why are you saying this well some of you
[1:49:59] have been waiting around for waiting to
[1:50:00] quit waiting around but there's a time
[1:50:03] that you're going to meet
[1:50:05] god
[1:50:09] you're either going to say i want you
[1:50:11] more than life itself
[1:50:15] i'm done look i'm sick and tired of
[1:50:16] being sick and tired
[1:50:20] and he's going to give you the desire of
[1:50:22] your heart that's what he did that night
[1:50:24] maybe your desire wasn't that six months
[1:50:26] ago
[1:50:28] i'm just speaking to you and me because
[1:50:30] you're fresh
[1:50:31] that's great good testimony wonderful
[1:50:35] keeper
[1:50:38] oh i'm sorry i should have cut my
[1:50:40] microphone off
[1:50:43] listen folks
[1:50:44] if
[1:50:46] whatever you do marriage or whatever you
[1:50:48] got to do is hard enough
[1:50:50] just as human beings
[1:50:52] but get the holy ghost
[1:50:55] get the new birth
[1:50:57] it sure will help
[1:51:00] you fight nicer
[1:51:02] if there's such a thing
[1:51:06] maybe i'll ask sister tabitha i'm not
[1:51:08] gonna talk to you right maybe fighting
[1:51:10] nice is
[1:51:11] okay
[1:51:13] but i mean really
[1:51:15] that's what jesus he came to the river
[1:51:17] jordan
[1:51:19] and remember what i read you the other
[1:51:20] day even the scripture says now john
[1:51:24] i think i got it there we'll read it
[1:51:25] again john
[1:51:26] it's not just the one you see the spirit
[1:51:28] drop on and then leave
[1:51:31] because remember he doesn't give you the
[1:51:32] new birth and then leave but now he will
[1:51:34] give you an anointing
[1:51:38] you can get that good sanctified feeling
[1:51:40] and all that unclean stuff's gone out of
[1:51:42] you and you think well i got it now
[1:51:46] you better get something cause the
[1:51:48] devil's coming right back and the bible
[1:51:50] says he's coming back to his house
[1:51:54] he's coming back to his house and he's
[1:51:57] gonna enter back in because you didn't
[1:51:59] get something sealed
[1:52:03] and he's going to make you just so
[1:52:05] religious
[1:52:06] you're going to love the lord
[1:52:08] you're going to love brother branham
[1:52:10] you're going to love brother dale
[1:52:13] come
[1:52:14] on but you're not going to have
[1:52:18] agape love
[1:52:19] for god
[1:52:23] you'll have filial love for god and you
[1:52:25] know what filial love is temporary
[1:52:29] it's a temporary love
[1:52:32] you said no it's just so much well
[1:52:36] but somebody somewhere
[1:52:39] you sister lily whoever's in this
[1:52:40] building
[1:52:43] when you're sealed in
[1:52:44] god
[1:52:45] puts a stamp on you
[1:52:48] he said i am pleased at this point in
[1:52:51] your life
[1:52:52] to dwell inside of you
[1:52:54] you are now my family members
[1:52:57] i knew you were going to you just didn't
[1:53:01] i knew you were going to a little voice
[1:53:02] from heaven saying you say well i've
[1:53:04] never heard a voice sister lily did you
[1:53:06] ever you hear a voice
[1:53:08] no
[1:53:09] but you heard god talking to you though
[1:53:12] come on folks if you ever the devil's
[1:53:14] not going to tell you to get the holy
[1:53:15] ghost
[1:53:17] that is something he is he
[1:53:20] there's no way
[1:53:21] because it's totally against all of him
[1:53:24] he can't say oh you need to get the new
[1:53:26] birth
[1:53:27] no that's god telling you that
[1:53:30] no the devil's going to say you're fine
[1:53:33] don't worry don't worry you're good you
[1:53:35] had that little feeling didn't you
[1:53:37] yeah i had a little feeling
[1:53:39] well you can get a little feeling from
[1:53:41] other things
[1:53:42] but when it turns you to the word of god
[1:53:45] because look what's the first thing
[1:53:47] jesus did
[1:53:49] jesus went to the wilderness
[1:53:52] and he fought the devil
[1:53:55] don't you think that's what me and
[1:53:56] you're going to do
[1:53:57] listen to this john 1 verse 29
[1:54:00] the next day john sees jesus coming to
[1:54:01] him and said behold the lamb of god
[1:54:04] which taketh away the sin of the world
[1:54:06] this is the he of whom i said after me
[1:54:08] cometh a man which is preferred before
[1:54:10] me for he was before me and i knew him
[1:54:12] not
[1:54:14] but that he should be made manifest to
[1:54:16] israel therefore am i come baptizing
[1:54:18] with water and john bear records say i
[1:54:20] saw the spirit descending from heaven
[1:54:22] like a dub and then a boat on him look
[1:54:24] and i knew him not
[1:54:25] said that twice and i knew him not
[1:54:28] but he that sent me
[1:54:31] now who sent him
[1:54:33] the same one that was in jesus
[1:54:36] but he was in another form
[1:54:37] right
[1:54:38] the holy ghost was talking to john
[1:54:41] but he that sent me to baptize with
[1:54:43] water the same said unto me upon whom
[1:54:45] thou shalt see the spirit descending
[1:54:47] and remaining on her
[1:54:52] man
[1:54:54] you
[1:54:55] the same as he was baptized with the
[1:54:57] holy ghost
[1:55:01] you say oh that's too close no it's not
[1:55:03] close enough yet
[1:55:06] it is not we are not getting close
[1:55:08] enough yet
[1:55:10] so let's look in the future home real
[1:55:11] quick we'll be done just a few minutes
[1:55:16] the prophet of god said here comes god
[1:55:18] down upon his earthly tabernacle
[1:55:20] jesus in the descending out of heaven
[1:55:22] jesus was baptized and went straightway
[1:55:24] a watch
[1:55:26] when he met the prophet
[1:55:29] the word comes to the prophet and he was
[1:55:32] the word and the prophet was standing
[1:55:33] there denying all their denominations
[1:55:35] and everything and when he seen the word
[1:55:37] the word came right to him
[1:55:39] see that you say we were talking about
[1:55:41] the other day about getting the new
[1:55:42] birth in the sunday school bible study
[1:55:44] class when you see the word the word
[1:55:47] comes right to you see when you when you
[1:55:50] you make up you made a statement up here
[1:55:54] sister lily you made a statement we all
[1:55:56] heard it didn't we
[1:55:57] so did every demon in hell here
[1:56:00] and the head demon himself heard it
[1:56:02] you say he's in church he gets here for
[1:56:04] you too
[1:56:06] and leaves after you leave
[1:56:08] or maybe some of you leaves with you
[1:56:10] so
[1:56:11] when he seen the word the word came
[1:56:13] right to him
[1:56:17] how you got hey you know you got the new
[1:56:18] birth because what's inside of you
[1:56:21] will come right to the word of god
[1:56:24] it will not go to anything else it will
[1:56:26] go to the word of god
[1:56:28] not a catechism
[1:56:30] not a apostle's creed not a tradition
[1:56:34] it will come to the word the word will
[1:56:36] come to the word and the prophet was so
[1:56:38] shocked he said i need to be baptized of
[1:56:40] thee why cometh thou to me he said
[1:56:43] suffer to be so for thus it becometh us
[1:56:45] we know the message to fulfill all
[1:56:46] righteousness i am the sacrifice it must
[1:56:50] be washed
[1:56:51] so he washed him or suffered him then he
[1:56:53] went up out of the water i saw heaven
[1:56:55] open the prophet saw it he saw the
[1:56:56] heavens open now watch and i was talking
[1:56:59] about this last sunday and here comes
[1:57:00] descending out of heaven a form of a
[1:57:02] dove and a voice saying hold on a man
[1:57:05] brother brown you're misquoting the word
[1:57:08] because that's not what he said in the
[1:57:10] bible
[1:57:11] because i just read you what it said in
[1:57:12] the bible
[1:57:14] a form descending like a dove said this
[1:57:16] is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to
[1:57:18] dwell
[1:57:19] that's all it said
[1:57:21] but watch a prophet
[1:57:24] he knew it had to deal with that flesh
[1:57:28] this was the son of man
[1:57:30] fixing to start the son of man message
[1:57:34] and here he come descending out of
[1:57:35] heaven a form of a dove and a voice
[1:57:36] saying this is my part of the earth
[1:57:46] this is my part of the earth
[1:57:49] that i have redeemed
[1:57:52] and out of this
[1:57:54] oh you're getting you're getting too far
[1:57:55] off brother from this part of the earth
[1:57:58] i will redeem the rest of it how do you
[1:58:00] think redemption comes when jesus is not
[1:58:02] here
[1:58:06] comes to you
[1:58:09] the bride
[1:58:12] the bride
[1:58:13] you're going to extend eternal life
[1:58:17] part of redemption so much a part of
[1:58:19] redemption you are
[1:58:21] to the world we're redemption
[1:58:24] amen come on i'm not getting any man out
[1:58:27] of that we are redemption to this earth
[1:58:31] how they gonna get it hey there's
[1:58:32] millions going to get
[1:58:34] redeemed
[1:58:36] by you
[1:58:37] or you or anybody else
[1:58:41] a cup of water in my name
[1:58:43] changed my tire on the side of the road
[1:58:45] open the door for you
[1:58:49] so who's that coming from we know that's
[1:58:51] coming from god but whereas yet he's
[1:58:53] inside but he's coming working through
[1:58:55] you
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:58:58] that's why
[1:58:59] that brother branham says the seed life
[1:59:02] has to come through the body somebody
[1:59:04] with the seed
[1:59:06] not that was born with it
[1:59:08] because remember even paul that's my
[1:59:10] whole point you take the apostle paul
[1:59:12] great apostle right
[1:59:15] wrote 80 of the new testament
[1:59:17] yeah got it
[1:59:21] the man
[1:59:25] got knocked off his horse one day
[1:59:28] got smoked blind one day
[1:59:30] wait a minute great man
[1:59:33] he was going to kill christians actually
[1:59:35] great man
[1:59:38] he had to go and wait for three days
[1:59:42] in a house
[1:59:44] and god goes and speaks to the seed life
[1:59:47] that was in the nice
[1:59:50] why didn't he just say paul you always
[1:59:53] was
[1:59:54] open your eyes
[1:59:56] blind dummy
[1:59:58] no
[1:59:59] somebody had to bring him the seed
[2:00:03] a nice go talk to this guy he's like
[2:00:08] he'll kill me
[2:00:10] jesus said all i mean well god said oh
[2:00:13] oh and nice
[2:00:15] you're going to find him pretty humble
[2:00:16] right now
[2:00:19] he's probably sore from getting knocked
[2:00:20] off the horse and oh i kind of blinded
[2:00:22] him a little bit so he wouldn't run
[2:00:24] off and i put him in a room
[2:00:27] i want you to go lay hands on him so he
[2:00:29] can get the holy ghost right here
[2:00:34] don't tell me that you don't have a
[2:00:35] connection with redemption
[2:00:37] why did he say i'm nice you got to go
[2:00:39] pray for paul
[2:00:41] to get the holy ghost scales came off
[2:00:43] his eyes
[2:00:45] and then god started working with him
[2:00:47] i mean why didn't he just knock paul off
[2:00:49] the listen paul was laying on the ground
[2:00:51] saying lord
[2:00:53] he knew it was god
[2:00:56] laying out there in the desert and you
[2:00:57] know his horse probably on top of him
[2:01:00] why didn't he just say
[2:01:02] oh i'm in the message now
[2:01:05] i'll just start writing the bible
[2:01:09] you see how god works
[2:01:11] right i'll just start writing the bible
[2:01:13] give me some paper
[2:01:16] i'm going to antioch i'm going to no
[2:01:20] he was blind for three days
[2:01:24] when that night's prayed for him the
[2:01:25] other thing we hear is is paul had to go
[2:01:27] back to the back side of the desert
[2:01:32] to listen to some tapes and read some
[2:01:34] books
[2:01:36] and listen to a five-fold ministry
[2:01:39] but when he comes out
[2:01:42] he meets peter
[2:01:45] and having the same holy ghost they're
[2:01:46] preaching the same message what's the
[2:01:48] problem with us in the message why can't
[2:01:49] we preach the same message
[2:01:57] i will redeem the rest of it for he is
[2:01:59] my word made manifest what are you
[2:02:02] you're his word made manifest
[2:02:06] and the whole world i spoke it into
[2:02:08] existence by my word
[2:02:10] now why'd he speak it into existence for
[2:02:11] me and you
[2:02:13] and satan has held its law this time but
[2:02:15] i've come to redeem it so much of it was
[2:02:17] made his body and i'm coming to
[2:02:20] dwell in it
[2:02:21] let's go to luke four we got two more
[2:02:23] points and then we'll be done
[2:02:25] jesus being full of the holy ghost wow
[2:02:30] he's ready for his ministry now
[2:02:32] because there's a part that's being
[2:02:33] quickened in his life
[2:02:36] listen jesus didn't need the holy ghost
[2:02:38] okay like me and you need the holy ghost
[2:02:41] everybody got that
[2:02:42] okay just want to explain that jesus
[2:02:44] didn't walk as some people said in the
[2:02:46] message that he walked 30 years without
[2:02:48] the holy ghost
[2:02:49] no
[2:02:50] he was born emmanuel
[2:02:52] god with us
[2:02:54] and that income
[2:02:56] encompasses every title
[2:02:59] he just had to get to a certain age to
[2:03:01] fulfill that title had to get to a
[2:03:03] certain age to fulfill that title had to
[2:03:05] get a certain age and do a certain thing
[2:03:06] to fulfill this title everybody good
[2:03:08] with that and man he like said he just
[2:03:11] didn't wake up
[2:03:12] and the best of him and go
[2:03:14] i'm the redeemer
[2:03:16] no he was going ah
[2:03:19] i need some milk
[2:03:21] right
[2:03:25] because he hadn't come to his position
[2:03:26] well that was god i just read you the
[2:03:28] quote
[2:03:29] crying in a manger that was god
[2:03:34] but now
[2:03:36] he's come to a position
[2:03:38] he's come to the 30 years of age
[2:03:40] he's come to a place to where god can
[2:03:42] now use that flesh to do something and
[2:03:44] being 40 days tempted to the devil in
[2:03:46] those days he did eat nothing
[2:03:49] now don't tell me that wasn't god
[2:03:53] 40 days he didn't eat nothing
[2:03:58] and in the south nothing means nothing
[2:04:01] okay nothing
[2:04:02] or we say nothing
[2:04:04] they don't mean nothing
[2:04:06] and people from ohio they're different
[2:04:07] they're just a little bit different they
[2:04:08] put all them little vowels in that we
[2:04:10] don't
[2:04:11] yeah i don't put them on we don't we
[2:04:13] don't even play with them vowels we just
[2:04:15] shove everything together
[2:04:16] yet
[2:04:18] being 40 days tempted the devil in those
[2:04:20] days he did eat nothing and when they
[2:04:22] were ended he afterward hungered and the
[2:04:24] devil said unto him if thou be the son
[2:04:26] of god
[2:04:28] command this stone that he that it be
[2:04:31] made bread
[2:04:34] now remember
[2:04:38] jesus brother brown tells us that jesus
[2:04:41] had three pulls in his journey
[2:04:44] we talked about the third pull three
[2:04:45] pulls first pull second pull third pull
[2:04:47] right
[2:04:49] well let's look at this this is three
[2:04:51] times
[2:04:52] that the devil's going to talk to him
[2:04:54] and he's going to say it is written that
[2:04:57] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:05:00] every word of god
[2:05:02] okay look it says it is written
[2:05:05] look in your bible it says it is written
[2:05:07] all right watch
[2:05:08] and the devil taking him up into a high
[2:05:09] mountain and showed him all the kingdoms
[2:05:11] of the world in a moment of time
[2:05:13] and the devil sent to him all this power
[2:05:15] will i give thee and the glory
[2:05:18] sounds pretty good doesn't it for that
[2:05:20] is delivered unto me and to whatsoever i
[2:05:22] will give the you in other words if thou
[2:05:24] will worship me
[2:05:26] all shall be thine and jesus answered
[2:05:28] and said unto him get thee behind me
[2:05:30] satan for it is
[2:05:33] written
[2:05:34] thou shalt worship the lord thy god and
[2:05:36] him only shalt thou serve
[2:05:39] now in brother brown's first pull and
[2:05:40] second pull
[2:05:43] it was the healing campaign
[2:05:46] right
[2:05:47] and the hand
[2:05:49] then the speaking
[2:05:51] right or the the
[2:05:53] discernment
[2:05:55] but now watch this
[2:05:57] brother richard douglas preached this
[2:05:59] several years ago here
[2:06:01] and
[2:06:02] and i brought this to his attention so
[2:06:03] he's preaching a little bit different
[2:06:04] now and he brought him to jerusalem and
[2:06:06] sent him on the pinnacle of the temple
[2:06:07] listen
[2:06:08] satan didn't have a problem going to
[2:06:09] church
[2:06:11] he took him to jerusalem and put him on
[2:06:12] the temple
[2:06:14] and set him on the pinnacle of the
[2:06:16] temple and said to him if thou be the
[2:06:17] son of god cast thyself down from hence
[2:06:18] for it is written
[2:06:21] he shall give his angels charge over
[2:06:23] thee to keep thee
[2:06:24] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[2:06:26] up lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[2:06:27] against the stone
[2:06:29] jesus had had enough
[2:06:35] he was fishing to administer the third
[2:06:37] pole
[2:06:39] he didn't say it is written
[2:06:43] he said i'm talking to you
[2:06:47] see he was quoting the bible
[2:06:49] it is written it is written it is
[2:06:51] written
[2:06:52] but when he come to that third poll he
[2:06:54] said
[2:06:55] it is said
[2:06:57] talking to you now
[2:06:59] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
[2:07:02] and when the devil had ended all this
[2:07:04] temptation he departed him for a season
[2:07:06] it is written it is written it is sad
[2:07:10] he said i've had enough
[2:07:12] he said i'm administering the third pull
[2:07:14] on you i'm not saying this in the third
[2:07:16] person or second person i'm telling you
[2:07:18] what was brother brown's third pull
[2:07:20] speaking squirrels
[2:07:22] he didn't say don't don't don't don't no
[2:07:24] no he said you say where you want them
[2:07:26] to be
[2:07:28] well bro well well god
[2:07:29] you say
[2:07:31] he said walk out on that limb stop right
[2:07:33] there i'll shoot that one walk out on
[2:07:35] that limb i'll shoot that one creative
[2:07:37] power
[2:07:38] by the third pool and they hear was god
[2:07:40] saying all right satan
[2:07:42] it's sad
[2:07:45] i've had enough when are we going to do
[2:07:46] the same thing
[2:07:48] see we can say it is written
[2:07:51] we can say it is written in the future
[2:07:52] home page 24. hello somebody
[2:07:57] but when are we going to say satan i say
[2:07:59] unto you
[2:08:01] you leave my kids alone
[2:08:03] you leave my family alone you leave this
[2:08:07] alone and that alone
[2:08:08] sure it's great to be under the pools
[2:08:10] where it is written that's okay quote
[2:08:13] him the word
[2:08:14] but you know what if it's just a quote
[2:08:19] satan just stand right there just like
[2:08:20] he did with him first too he was still
[2:08:22] right there but when but when that voice
[2:08:25] came out and jesus answered and said i
[2:08:27] said
[2:08:29] i've had enough of this
[2:08:31] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
[2:08:34] leave me alone and guess what he left
[2:08:37] now he left for a season so be careful
[2:08:39] he'll leave forever
[2:08:41] he's going to come back
[2:08:45] everybody all right with that
[2:08:47] let's read this and then we'll close
[2:08:48] right here uh sisters go ahead and get
[2:08:50] everything ready well i know they're
[2:08:51] down there watching
[2:08:53] and if you need to go help
[2:08:55] we're gonna sing a couple of songs
[2:08:56] before we
[2:08:58] um
[2:08:59] we got a lot of food down there please
[2:09:01] eat all you want to eat
[2:09:06] all right let's go to luke 4 verse 1.
[2:09:10] jesus well i'm sorry let's go to luke 4
[2:09:12] 16. it continues on when he came to
[2:09:15] nazareth where he had been brought up
[2:09:16] and as his custom was he went to church
[2:09:21] didn't i just
[2:09:23] and as his custom was
[2:09:26] he went into the synagogue on the
[2:09:27] sabbath day
[2:09:28] and stood up for the read
[2:09:31] he wasn't just a bystander
[2:09:33] he was a participant
[2:09:35] but watch this this is what i love
[2:09:38] and there was delivered unto him now
[2:09:41] remember
[2:09:43] you and i
[2:09:46] know about this book
[2:09:49] we know it's not just a scroll
[2:09:52] the book we're talking about
[2:09:54] is the word
[2:09:57] all right
[2:09:58] but now there was delivered unto him
[2:10:01] the book of the prophet isaiah
[2:10:04] and this is the way it happens there
[2:10:06] they didn't have books
[2:10:09] right
[2:10:11] because even if you read it in the
[2:10:12] original greek or hebrew or whatever it
[2:10:14] is it says scroll
[2:10:16] they didn't have books like we did until
[2:10:18] like the 15th 1500s but it was a scroll
[2:10:21] like we were talking about the seal you
[2:10:22] know the seal
[2:10:25] all right
[2:10:26] they handed it to him closed
[2:10:30] because he said he opened it
[2:10:33] he opened the book
[2:10:38] he looked down in that book
[2:10:42] and he saw itself
[2:10:49] by the way what are the seals christ
[2:10:51] right
[2:10:52] we know that christ we know it's got all
[2:10:54] the symbols and all of it is christ but
[2:10:56] where where
[2:10:58] where
[2:11:00] christ out you under somewhere
[2:11:02] crossed over in the desert somewhere
[2:11:04] crossed over into this church and that
[2:11:07] the bible says christ in you
[2:11:10] that's where you're going to find him
[2:11:11] out
[2:11:12] but look when he opened the book
[2:11:14] he found a place where he was identified
[2:11:19] amen
[2:11:22] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[2:11:27] wow
[2:11:28] because he has anointed me
[2:11:32] to preach the gospel
[2:11:35] he has sent me
[2:11:37] look how personal
[2:11:41] he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[2:11:44] preach deliverance to the captive and
[2:11:45] recover sight of the blind to set at
[2:11:47] liberty them that are bruised to preach
[2:11:49] the acceptable year of the lord
[2:11:52] and what'd he do
[2:11:55] he closed the book
[2:11:58] he said you're not going to understand
[2:11:59] me
[2:12:00] until the end time
[2:12:02] but when i come back
[2:12:04] i'm going to come back with an open book
[2:12:07] and you're going to not see just me
[2:12:10] you're going to see yourself
[2:12:13] you're going to see you are going to do
[2:12:15] these things
[2:12:16] see
[2:12:17] listen god's the only one can open the
[2:12:19] book
[2:12:20] why didn't they hand him that scroll
[2:12:22] open
[2:12:24] he had to fulfill
[2:12:26] everything that we believe
[2:12:28] the denominations handed him a closed
[2:12:30] book
[2:12:31] priest
[2:12:32] people that didn't know who he was
[2:12:34] the people that
[2:12:36] really never knew who he was why because
[2:12:38] the book was closed
[2:12:40] but he opened that book in their
[2:12:42] presence
[2:12:45] and told them who he
[2:12:46] was me
[2:12:49] me
[2:12:50] i me
[2:12:52] to preach the acceptable year of the
[2:12:53] lord then he closed the book and what
[2:12:57] give it back to the church ages
[2:13:02] right
[2:13:03] give it back to the church ages and he
[2:13:04] said
[2:13:06] i can't reveal myself like that
[2:13:08] to the church ages
[2:13:10] because i'm the son of man
[2:13:11] that was the literal son of man standing
[2:13:13] there with that book in his hand
[2:13:15] amen just like in revelations 5 that was
[2:13:17] the son of man standing there with the
[2:13:19] book in his hand
[2:13:21] the lamb
[2:13:22] took the book
[2:13:26] and this mighty angel that came down
[2:13:28] from heaven in revelation 10 with the
[2:13:29] book open it was in his
[2:13:31] hand
[2:13:34] the son of man
[2:13:37] but he closed the book and gave it back
[2:13:38] to the minister and sit down
[2:13:40] the eyes of all of them
[2:13:43] were in the synagogue were fastened upon
[2:13:45] him
[2:13:46] and he began to say unto them this day
[2:13:50] can you say that
[2:13:52] this day
[2:13:54] is this scripture
[2:13:56] fulfilled
[2:13:57] in your ears
[2:13:59] every time you hear
[2:14:01] and something's quickened of this open
[2:14:03] book
[2:14:05] this day
[2:14:06] this scripture
[2:14:08] has been fulfilled the son of man
[2:14:11] has spoke to you
[2:14:13] through the word
[2:14:16] and all bear him witness and wondered at
[2:14:18] the gracious words which proceeded out
[2:14:19] of his mouth
[2:14:20] look
[2:14:22] all this great mighty
[2:14:25] man standing there
[2:14:28] they denied his virgin birth
[2:14:31] is this just joseph's son
[2:14:35] is not this joseph's son
[2:14:38] and he said unto them you are surely
[2:14:40] saying to me this proverb i'm going to
[2:14:42] read you this and it's kind of comical
[2:14:44] under this proverb physician heal
[2:14:45] thyself
[2:14:47] no a physician heals other people
[2:14:51] whatsoever we have heard done in
[2:14:52] capernaum do also here in thy country
[2:14:54] and he said verily i say unto you no
[2:14:57] prophet is accepted in his own country
[2:14:58] now here's the sort of man talking
[2:15:01] even brother brown said that same thing
[2:15:04] because in jeffersonville he was just
[2:15:06] brother bill
[2:15:08] they knew he had a good ministry but
[2:15:09] they didn't know who he was
[2:15:11] but i tell you of a truth many widows
[2:15:13] went to israel in the days of elise when
[2:15:15] the heaven was shut up three years and
[2:15:17] six months when great famine was
[2:15:18] throughout all the land
[2:15:20] but unto none of them
[2:15:22] was a lie sent
[2:15:24] save that one woman
[2:15:27] you know what he's telling them
[2:15:29] this wasn't sent to you
[2:15:31] because after we get finished reading
[2:15:33] this they almost threw him off of a
[2:15:34] cliff
[2:15:37] he said i'm not sent to you
[2:15:39] i'm sent to a will now remember what the
[2:15:41] widow woman was he's talking to jews
[2:15:44] the widow woman was a syrophoenician
[2:15:47] woman or a from sarah path and she was a
[2:15:50] gentile
[2:15:52] elijah was sent to the gentiles he's
[2:15:54] telling them this has nothing to do with
[2:15:56] you
[2:15:59] when the heaven was shut up three years
[2:16:00] and six months from great family
[2:16:01] throughout all land but unto none of
[2:16:03] them was elise sent saving to saratha a
[2:16:06] city of sidon unto a woman that was a
[2:16:08] widow and many lepers were in israel in
[2:16:10] the time of elias or elijah the prophet
[2:16:14] and none of them was clean
[2:16:15] now
[2:16:16] naaman
[2:16:17] is what
[2:16:19] he's a syrian
[2:16:21] he's not a jew
[2:16:23] he's telling them exactly i am not in
[2:16:26] other words whatever this is i just told
[2:16:28] you
[2:16:28] it's not for you
[2:16:30] because the rest of that i didn't put it
[2:16:32] on there to save time the rest of that
[2:16:34] is
[2:16:35] they perceived that he was talking about
[2:16:37] them and they run him out of the city
[2:16:39] and put him on a cliff and was going to
[2:16:40] push him off
[2:16:42] that's how mad they got you know what
[2:16:44] they got just a little bit of revelation
[2:16:47] they didn't know really who he was
[2:16:49] they'd have said god forgive me and save
[2:16:51] me but that wasn't the time for that
[2:16:55] now what about me and you are we
[2:16:56] fulfilling the scripture
[2:17:02] let's stand are we fulfilling the
[2:17:04] scripture
[2:17:05] say amen
[2:17:06] [Music]
[2:17:08] right or wrong
[2:17:10] right or wrong we're fulfilling the
[2:17:13] scripture
[2:17:17] but there could you imagine there stood
[2:17:18] jesus
[2:17:20] and they handed him that scroll
[2:17:23] i believe if i'd have been there i'd
[2:17:24] have started crying
[2:17:26] because i said god that's you
[2:17:29] and you're opening that book just for me
[2:17:33] i'm not opening it for you the jews
[2:17:35] you're opening it for me lord a
[2:17:37] syrophoenician a syrian a a gentile
[2:17:41] that's just not worthy to have all this
[2:17:43] but you know what
[2:17:45] it won't make us mad
[2:17:47] it makes us glad
[2:17:50] that god give us an open book
[2:17:52] that god give us a time
[2:17:54] to where we can see him in his fullness
[2:17:57] now listen this is the time of the
[2:17:58] fullness
[2:17:59] this is not part truth this is the
[2:18:01] fullness time to know exactly who this
[2:18:03] son of man is and we'll get to it a
[2:18:05] little bit later we're going to talk
[2:18:06] about the headstone
[2:18:08] because that was what was rejected was
[2:18:10] the full headship of the word was what
[2:18:12] was rejected
[2:18:14] right jesus took him back to scripture
[2:18:16] but remember that headstone
[2:18:20] didn't get wiped away he just came back
[2:18:22] down here and became the chief
[2:18:24] cornerstone
[2:18:25] which is a little bitty pyramid right
[2:18:27] here
[2:18:29] and he started
[2:18:31] building that foundation
[2:18:33] by the roots
