========================================

good to be in the house of the Lord this morning good to see each one of you and so before uh we do the Sunday School lesson this morning I just want to just's uh take a moment and uh pray just speak to the author Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord thank you for your blessings and we just pray you Lord just help us this morning Lord as we look into your word for this portion of time and Lord we just commit ourselves to you Lord and we just pray that you bless everything every part of this service today bless those that are here with us Lord and visitors father the ones that are not here with us this morning I pray that you be with them those that are watching in online ones that be listening later Lord we just pray that everything that is said and done Lord will be a blessing Lord we just thank you for all you have done for us and Lord we just commit ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen so this morning I'm not I'm not uh unless they pull it up on the back but this morning I want to read from Psalms 27 1-5 and U the scripture says David says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid said when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came up upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fail though and host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing I have desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and this morning I want to take a little my title is my light and my salvation and uh I just want to look at a few things this morning and U something been I'd actually had started working on this some time back and uh just with some of the recent events that we've had with uh the school shooting and and different things this just came back to me but uh I just want to look at a few things this morning and um might uh I know the young people aren't up here the kids up here but this may be something for the kids to uh listen to might be something for the kids but uh you know the word light is one of the defin you know is to illuminate to Enlighten to shine upon and so says the Lord is my light and you many times we have especially recent but in life you know we have a lot of times that are dark and Gloom ly and u a lot of things come against us and things don't uh come the way we want them to but you know God is our light and no matter how dark the world gets or how dark our situation gets God is our light and he lights our paths he shows us the way we should go anything that happens God is the one that's going to lead you and show you which way to go and the word salvation you know means to means to uh to rescue or bring from one position to another because you know we were all in sin we were all in darkness and we were brought into Marvelous Light and salvation is is to bring from one place to another but it also means to rescue and so but it also means our our safety it means our welfare our prosperity it means means our Victory all these things have to do with our Salvation so when when we talk about God being our our Salvation God is our safety he is our deliverance everything that we have need of it's in it's in a part of God being our Salvation so when he says my the Lord is my light and my salvation of Whom Shall I Fear when when David's talking about this and all the things when you look at David's life all the things that David went through uh you know the one thing I I thought about when you when you look at David's life and you know David had had a great opportunity to to really stand out in the things that he done but you know it's the things that he didn't do are some of the most remarkable things that people look at David's life about you know when when King Saul tried to kill David and kept coming after him him you know it was the Integrity of David's heart not to kill Saul he said God forbid that I touch God's anointed even though Saul had been rejected as king and had turned the word of God down and the Judgment of God was upon Saul David still held Saul in regard to the anointing that God had placed upon him and he said God forbid that I touch his anointed but to show the Integrity of David's heart Saul was put in David's hands more than once but he wouldn't touch him right even when he was urged to take Saul's life he said God has placed him in your hands now take your enemy and do you know that he would not do that because he still held Saul as the King right because he realized that the Judgment wasn't his it was God's judgment right and so he's like no I will not touch him and when he cut the skirt Saul's skirt he went back and apologized to Saul he said I want to show you that I had the opportunity to take your life and I didn't but but he had done he had done an offense to Saul a minor offense and he was so he was so moved by that that he called out to Saul to tell him I cut your skirt and it's an amazing thing sometimes because we allow such small things happen in our lives and we just let them pass by and not realize the the little fox is spoil of Vine the small things in your life that you allow to pass by those are great offenses sometimes we allow such small things happen but see it was the it was the Integrity of David's heart to understand who God was and he said I I don't want to put anything before me that would displease God and so we see the things that David done that he had such a great um love for God he he had such great love for God's word that he would not allow these things to take place but he had this great opportunity and you know a lot of people like well look at look at David's life well he held he held the word of God in such high regard that he wouldn't touch Saul and it's so and it's just like that that you know when you have these things God is my light and my salvation of Whom Shall I Fear right you know you see the you see the life that David lived and you know here he is in all these things the things that he had seen God do in his life so many times we'll read several different uh passages from from Psalms this morning maybe U but here's one of them Psalms 112:4 says unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous so we think about the things that all the things that are the darkness that covers the earth today we see a lot of even in politics and different things we see the we know that the time that we live in we we understand how these things are to take place and you see the things that's going on but you know we we see these things we know that there's supposed to be darkness in the land but you know there's light right and you know you know David said the Lord is my light but you know Jesus said ye are the light of the world and it's not just not just to be that we're to walk in the light but we're supposed to be the light also John chapter 3 19 and 20 he says and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved so we see that the light has come into the world the light of the word has come and in every age there was a light God brought light in every age every group that was alike there was a message that came forth to them we received our message in our day right the fullness of the word is coming our dayen and we see many people have have rejected the word and turned it down they walked away from it but we realize that's what they're supposed to do but we see that how God is is light and he's brought us this light and you know there's there's many people that have walked away from the light and we see um I I was thinking the other day and I kept trying to think of the name of the song but I could I I I had part of it in my mind but I couldn't think so I had to do a little research and it was called getting used to the dark and I don't know if any of y'all it's an old southern gospel song but you know it's you know the condition of the world today the the things that we see and it's just like you know there's so much darkness in the world and it says for Christians are to be the light but instead of instead of standing up and being the light to the world and showing the light of the word of God we're starting to just get used to the dark because if you compromise on the word or you just let things go well this is just the way things are going to be well I I'm sorry but you know I I going stand up for what's right and I want the world to see that there is truth and this is what the truth is and you know I I want I want the world to know these things because many people that they've got to the place Well it Well we can't change anything but you know there was a little story years ago about that little boy that was going down the beach and he saw all the little starfish and little things that were on the b beach and you know he was going down through there and he was throwing all of them back in the old man watch that little boy throwing starfish and little aquatic things back in there you know and he's like you know son he said you can't do any good doing this he said look all the way down through the beach you see all these little creatures up on the beach they're not in the water they're not going to make it but it didn't stop that little boy he was determined everything that was all the little living creatures that were stuck on the beach he was up there throwing them back in and he stopped and told that old man he picked up a little starfish and held in his hand he said well I can't save all of them but it's important to this one and he threw it back in the water and he just kept on going down through there we can't save the whole world we can't change everything but you know that God puts you across somebody's path for you to be the light to that one that's right be the light where you are and you know you know you never know why people cross your path why things happen the way they do but you sow the seed you be the light to that person right because you never know what when God is going to reach that one just like I was thinking of the the brother that was in the the brother in South Africa brother Keith and uh he uh was witnessing to this lady and he said the Lord just impressed me to go over to this lady I started talking to her and I was telling her about the Lord and everything he said I just stood there and talked to her and he said I didn't understand he said she wasn't interested in one bit she was an older lady she said she was not interested in any of this one bit but he said I just went over there he said because this the way I felt led to go but she had a young caretaker with her and he said I began to share the gospel and talk about God and the word and he said I just started giving part of my testimony just began to speak to this lady and he said just in a moment he said that young lady started crying she was moved by that and he said it wasn't that I was talking to that older lady it was God he said it was because that young lady was with her and he said I had to stop that elderly lady because she was the one that was that was the one in charge you know but when I started talking to her because she stopped to listen I then that young lady was the one that was moved by the gospel was able to be saved because of the of his testimony of them speaking so you never know what God and you say why why are certain things happen just be faithful to what God calls you to do right God moves you on your heart to say stuff to something somebody you know like brother M says always check it by the word but you know if if it if it's uh if it's right if it's uplifting you know if it's scriptural then yeah we ought to share it and whether whether you know it offends people or not well the word's going to be offensive but the word but the people need to hear the truth amen so we see here speaking of the light proverbs 18:10 says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe so you know God has us a place for us to come to the name of the Lord he's given us his name and we have a place to run to in times of need times of trouble problems so you just go and see you know people are looking for many things in the world but they're try trying to find it the wrong way and this is uh one of the what really got me started on on going down this line was I was listening to brother Brown and he was preaching in the message the time tested Memorials of God and he's talking about being there at the a lot of yall probably remember this he was talking about being at the Statue of Liberty and he goes out on the on the uh the island where the where the statue is and you know he goes up there and he's in the he's in the statue they're showing him around and he's talking to the uh some of the people there and and he sees all those dead birds laying up there on the Statue and and he asked him you know he's like why are they up here he said they did they get electrocuted while they they were sparrows and they were all dead and he's like no he said those little fellas they got caught in a storm he's like yeah I know there was a storm here last night he said when they got into this light they tried to beat the light out see they just HIIT against this glass and beat he said instead of using the light to go to safety they tried to beat the light out and he said they beat their brains out trying to get trying to put that light out and they died and he say see and he said then the inspiration struck me he said that's right men and women who are trying to beat out the light of God are just beating their brains out he said why don't they use it to go to SA safety in this in the stad of beating their brains out trying to deny it saying the days of Miracles is passed there is no such thing as Divine Healing old heart felt salvation these things they're just beating against the post but see so they spent all their time and he was sitting there listening and watching those seeing all those dead birds where they' went out there and got caught in a storm and they' beat their themselves to death because they saw that light and instead of trying to use it to go to safety they wanted trying to beat it out and you know and that's the way it is today we see many people they want to try to deny the the light of the word they want to deny the word they want to try to put the the word down they want to try to do away with it but that's the only safety that you have your only the only salvation that you're going to have is the word of God the only protection you're going to have is the word of God and they try to put this out because 2 Corinthians 37 17 says because it's speaking of the spirit of the Lord he said now the Lord is that spirit and he said where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty so there's Freedom so you can be free of these things he said where we are we all with open face beholding it as a glass in the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so where the spirit of the Lord is see it's going to it's it's going to be a it'll take a change it'll cause a change in you it'll bring you to the change that you want to come to it'll do whatever you have need of that is where there is freedom in that there is Liberty in that and so when you see all these things that are taking place there's safety in that right he said the righteous run into that are safe so all these things that you go through in life here they are if you just come to the right place Place see you know we we see a lot of times people today they they have they have their ideas backwards and I was thinking about how people want to try to you know they they want to try to justify themselves they want to look at things but you know I I was thinking about Abraham Lincoln you know when they asked Lincoln about um um you know he's like why why is it that both sides of this war he said you know they both pray to the same God they both believe the same you know they're both praying for an outcome and and he like you know they say that God's on their side and we say God's on our side Lincoln told him said no he said my greatest concern is not to is not whether God is on my side is on our side he said my greatest concern is to make sure that I'm on God's side right he said because for God is always right right amen and some times you know we have it backwards we're trying to look at it as whether God's on our side well I I want to be on his side I want to make sure that I'm doing the things that is pleasing to him and not trying to use my own ideas or on my own ways because I want to be on his side right because if I'm if I'm where he's at and I'm following the way he's going then I'll never be wrong I'll always be right and see if we if we follow the way that God has the way that God made the god the way that he showed these things if we follow his plan then all that comes to pass everything will be fine you know in the in the Old Testament when when they God told them that they had to take the lamb and and slay the lamb and they had to cook it and and they had to eat and they had to prepare themselves to leave Egypt and they had to have their shoes on and all that and you know they had to go out there and they had to take the blood from the lamb and they had to put it on the lentil on the doorpost and and prepare themselves to leave Egypt and you know they were they were under a death warning right because you know the the warning had been sent out that listen he said prepare yourselves tonight and he said there's the way of Escape made but he said come tonight the death angel will pass through and kill all the firstborn and you know he said but there is a way of Escape that was made but the death the the death angel was coming through and there was only one way that they could bypass that because it was it was either you followed the way that was played out or there was death there was no other way right you had to follow that and you know he was talking about brother R was talking about how that father was sitting there and you know he was just sitting there resting and and relaxing you know just going through the things and he said but his son was standing there and you know his son was so worked up he's like Daddy are you sure about this Daddy are you sure about this because it's my life that's hanging in the balance he said are you sure about this Dad and he said son I want you to come here and look he said God told us there's one way and if we would take the blood of that lamb and the hisp and we would put the blood on the door he said this the death angel can't touch you you're free from this God's brought us all this way when you see them all of the plagues that they had went through all the things that had taking place in Egypt but you know here they are Egypt was in darkness but we know that there was light in Goan all of the fleas the Flies the frogs all the things that they had went through but you know what God protected his people and it's like and now we're going to see this great thing that's going to take place but after after this and we eat this lamb and we prepare ourselves then you know what we're leaving Egypt we're not going to be in this bondage anymore and so you know Harry is standing there telling his son listen you don't have to worry about all this because we're following God's plan God has made a way and we put our full trust in God that he's going to bring us through there is no second way there is no we don't have we don't have a as they say we don't have a Ace in the Hole or you know any kind of other you know we ain't got plan b or or nothing else we got we got God and we got our full trust in him we don't have no other way there's no second way you know because it's either God's way or it's death right you know we see you know in Psalms 23 it says yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me you know brother bram's talking about in the in the message the great warrior David he's talking about the shepherd and the shepherd has a script bag and he has this script bag and it has all of the things that a Shepherd needs that's inside there and he's talking about you know he said here's God's script bag He said Each traveler Shepherd out there has a script bag so you know if you want something out there some purchasing power if if you're sick reach out here and let's see what's in the script back he Saidi the Lord that Health thee all right take it out it's a power that buys he said whatsoever thou believest When you pray believe you receive what you ask for if you desire if you desire it pray and believe you get it you shall have it that's in the script bag so whatever you have need of is in that script bag so if he's our Shepherd and he's the one that shows that we shall not want and whatever whatever condition that we go through in life what however dark and dismal it may look but you know what he is our Shepherd and it's in his script bag that he'll bring you through he'll give you whatever you have need of and he said and the shepherd Christ Jesus who never lost the battle The Shepherd of the sheep is packing the church tonight in his own glorious protection amen so whatever you go through realize that you are protected we're walking as as brother Bram was talking about the condition everybody wants to build bomb shelters and they want to have this kind of protection and that kind of protection but he said the believer is under feathers right the greatest place that you can be is under the wings of that Jehovah Eagle almighty God be under his wings and no matter what happens if we're there then we don't have to worry about the condition the world is in things that happen because we have the best protection that we can have so we can have he said and the eagle he said and the eagle can have confidence in his god-given protection you know he was talking about how he went down in that blowdown brother BR was standing out there in that field and he saw that eagle and he had he was flexing his wings you know he said I can shoot you I can put you down but he said that eagle never never flinched never was scared because he knew that the wings that he had was his protection and he said if if that give him confidence he had strength to believe in that confidence that God given that that God had given him that he could do that he said how much more the church by the Holy Spirit can have confidence in the wings he said your god-given protection and tutor when sick strikes or when trouble strikes when all these things take place then you know what you can put your trust in him and whatever condition that happens whatever things goes then you put your your faith and confidence in those things you've seen God work in your life then if God's done one thing for you then you know what he'll continue to do the same thing and I I I want we'll have the the musicians come I'm I'm going to finish here just in in a few minutes but I I I want to finish this morning with this you know brother bam talks about the story of the little the little boy in the storm the little boy came in the storm and you know he's at home and he got real nervous about the storm and he stood there and he's like Mom I'm afraid of this storm it's getting too close and it really made him nervous and his mom was like listen the WS our protection you don't have to worry about it you know but but he never he never would he never could get comfortable with that he never could put his trust and that and the next thing he like well Mama all these things have taken place and I'm more more worried about this today and I'm a little bit con you know concerned about these things and she kept telling him said listen said we believe God and and and all these storms or whatever Co he said God is our protection and his mama kept trying to comfort him he said yeah Mama he said I believe that' but he said I want a god with skin on it right you know he wanted he wanted a god with skin on it well I want to say this morning brother BR and the Mighty God unveiled he said we are the god with skin on it you're looking at the people this is god with skin on it when you're looking for somebody that you're that you're wanting somebody that lay you know that you can touch that you can give a hold of well that's that's your brothers and sisters that's the people in this church church that's the the Believers these are this is this is the ones that you can touch because God is veiled in human flesh and if God has has veiled in human flesh s you know fall short of the glory of God and all those type things but you know what God still is hid in our flesh we are god with skin on it and that you know that little boy you can have confidence in these things and you know the the scripture talks about a the the scripture I just want to I know there's several scripture here in Psalms but I'm not going to be able to get to them this morning but it says that you know the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliverthat was here the same God that brother bandam talked about that he preached about the one he served is here this morning and he's the ones that brought you all this way and has kept you every day of your life and I I've talked to several people this this week and one of the things that really stirred me up you know because so many people walk in in they walk in fear of the unknown and I you know and it's and it's real easy just to say well I just walk by faith but you you you look you look moms in the eyes and they're sending their kids to school and it's like I don't know what's going to happen next right but you know what I know where I came from and I know where I'm at this morning because you know what I know I passed from Death to life right every day of my life I've come all this way because of God Amen all my shortcomings all my figures but you know what God has never failed me he's brought me all this way I've got a son that I got to send to school but you know what I placed him in the hands of God yes and I can't do anything else but do that right because that's true I was thinking about this morning how many children are sitting here in this building that we've dedicated to God that brother Dale dedicated you to God well then how much more I mean what else do you want don't think well I'm so worried I'm so nervous I I don't know what's going to take place you're in the hands of God we dedicated you to God yes so you know what you don't have to worry about those things and the other thing is is every single year we come up here and we give y'all prayer clo walls and we pray over every one of you right so that guess what when you walk out of here and you get up to go to school and everybody's like well I don't want to go to school today and they're so afraid and they're so worried well I want you to realize that the angel of the Lord is still there with you why because we prayed over you we dedicated you to the Lord and we send you out there as walking in faith amen you walk in faith you don't have to worry about what's going to take place that's right why because Isaiah 54:17 tells us he said no weapon formed against you shall prosper Glory that's what God Said right and that's what we spoke over you and when we do these things and we pray over you and we give you prayer Clause listen this ain't some kind of Hocus Pocus this ain't some kind of ritual that we go through this is enforcing the word of God righten because we take God at his word and we enforce it amen then guess what the devil is defeated right so don't worry about what takes place I'm not worried because you know what even if I had an army around me I wouldn't have more confidence in that than I do in the word of God right because though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me amen God bless you this morning and if you have if you don't have a prayer cloth this morning if you want a prayer cloth then guess what we will give you one pray over you this morning whatever you have need of we want you to be have have confidence in God's word and realize who you are and where you're standing at because so many kids will go out and they'll be worried about what's going to take place tomorrow next day it's all in the hands of God Amen that's right so I want you to be comforted be a good cheer this morning I am with you and I'll be with you till the end of the world Amen God bless you this morning [Applause] [Music]
