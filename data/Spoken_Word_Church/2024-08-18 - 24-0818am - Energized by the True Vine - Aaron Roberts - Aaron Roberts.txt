TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Holy Spirit flow through me amen as I lift my hand to worship and to magnify thy name flow through me oh Holy Spirit flow through me amen good morning it's good to see everybody here this morning I was talking to brother collie this morning and he um actually overslept and uh that happens to us sometimes I have those days myself the older I get the more I like to sleep and my wife likes it too cuz it keeps me out of her way anyway this morning it's good to see everybody here this morning and uh we're going to be reading from Hebrews 12 1-15 and uh it's this morning it's about um little things that we do and follow up with brother Lis is what he was talking about this morning Sunday school is about that correction that we get and I mean when we get it from our father a real father it don't taste too good because it's all flesh but when it comes from our heavenly father that's supposed to reach weigh down and changes and I want to I want to say this just for what it's worth brother Bob preached a wonderful message me Wednesday night and for those of you didn't hear it I hope you hear it CU it's talking about you and I was going to read another scripture this morning I was going to go through Revelations 22 and um what he preached Wednesday night brought me back to Revelations 22 and I sat there and I read and read it and you know had a wonderful time with the Lord but today I'm telling you all of you if you get a chance to go back and listen to it listen to it because it's a wonderful message and we need to not let these messages not be unheard two or three times I know I have to listen to them several times just to get it so any morning anytime right now we're going to go ahead and just read the Bible revelations 12 1-15 and as we go to the Lord and ask his permission to open his word let's let's pray pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this day you've given us to come together around one more time around your word Lord and to be fed by your ministers here brother Aaron and brother Bob this afternoon I I pray Lord that you just open up their hearts and let those words a preparation Lord that you've given them to give to us to feed us that high protein food that we need Lord to stand on your word because we are the only light the little light that you've given us is that new birth and it needs to be Shone out into to the world and I know that people don't really understand us a lot of times Lord but you know what a smile on our face and Lord bless you helps them along their way and I just ask father that if there is any still out there that hadn't come yet I believe there is that we might be one of them to reach them I don't know Lord just have your way with us and use us forgive us of our sins Lord and I ask today that you just come down and bless the service and bless brother Wade and sister Jun and Mama they up there and visiting with those people in Brother Wilson's and I ask you just to bless brother Wade as he's bringing the Mana to them up there today and bless their journey and bring them back home safely and Lord just keep bringing us back lord till you get us right and have your way with us most of all and we ask these things and bless the opening and the reading of the word we ask it in your name Jesus Christ amen bear with me a minute here wherefore seeing we also are compass about was so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do so easily beset us and let us run with a patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus ofing the shame down at the right of theone of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your own minds you have not resisted unto blood and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou thy chastising of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him For Whom the he every he receive if ye endure chastising god dealth with you as Sons for what son is he whom the father has chastised us not you without Chas All Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live days foret we might be of now no chastising for the presence seems to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefor lift up the hands which hang down and thees and make straight pass for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed peace with all men in without no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of betterness spring up trouble to you and thereby may be defiled thank you for the open the word you may be seated amen thank you Jesus amen thank the Lord for that word amen right in line from glory to glory our brother mentioned you know we it's a it's a suffering and I think of it as God will let you practice he's going to let you practice what you are learning and growing in his word he's going

Wilson's may they have a great time in you Lord may they be blessed and we just commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen John chapter 15 and beginning at verse one and it says I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you amen abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the Vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine and ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me he can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples amen God bless you this morning you may be seated and uh my titled is energized by the True Vine and I was looking at some things and you know I'm I I get everybody have all ministers have a different way of of studying and and doing different things and I get I get thoughts and ideas and I put them together and I was talking to brother Aon McGary one time and I told him I said the one thing that I have trouble with is trying to come up with a with a title for my sermons sometimes I got a sermon together and I don't know what to call it and he told me so well maybe you just send it to me give me your idea and I'll give you a good title because I always said brother Aon if you ever listen to brother Aaron mcgary's titles it's like I don't know what he's going to preach on but we know it's going be good he just has a way of of labeling and uh but this morning I want to look at this and I was thinking about what brother uh brother Quinn was talking about and he was he was talking about the True Vine and the false Vine and uh I had just been been looking at this and that's the reason I entitled it energized by the True Vine and so here brother randam says in the in the message the Queen of Sheba he said he's the vine John chapter 15 he said where are the branches now he said the vine does not bear fruit the branch bears fruit as it's energized by the vine and if the first Branch out of that vine produced a church that wrote a book of Acts the second Branch would do the same thing every branch that comes out of that vine will be energized by the same life that's in the vine amen so that's what I want to I want to look at this morning and because he said I am the vine and ye are the branches my father is the husbandman and so I I want to look at this word the word energize it means to give vitality and enthusiasm to it means the power or the ability of something to continue to live or to give the power of life to to be or to be successful now now the word Vitality means to the power of giving continuance of life and the word enthusiasm means one of the definitions means belief and special Revelations of the Holy Spirit now some of those that got to listen if you've had the opportunity to listen to uh the Youth Camp from Ohio from uh brother uh Wayne Lawson's Camp um brother Andrew Glover preached a really good message about don't lose your enthusiasm and one of the things that that brother Andrew brought out that I thought was really good that tied in with this is that brother Andrew was talking about if you go back a hundred or more years ago the word en enthusiasm only was tied to the scripture was tied to the revelation of the word enthusiasm did not mean what we think it means today it actually meant and when you go back and look and he brother Andrew brought that out and I was like I actually wouldn't looked up in the dictionary and sure enough that's what it means amen it meant special Revelation it brings power and enthusiasm comes from the scripture amen and we've taken that and brother Bram said that's what he said brother Bram said the church has lost its enthusiasm why because they've got mixed with everything else and they've not went to the scripture but that's where you get your power you get your um energy Your vitality lifegiving the only lifegiving for there is comes from the scripture he said that he is the way the truth and life he is the only way that you can make it he is the light he is he is all that you have need of comes through the scripture comes through him and it says to energize means it's a strong excitement or a feeling and to energize means to get something from energy it has comes from energy energy means a vigorous exertion of power it means power strength Force the ability or capacity to Pro produce an effect so when we talk about having the to be energized by the Holy Spirit to have this energy this Force this power there's only one power in the world and that's Jesus Christ God's the only Power everything else is permitted power we realize that everything else God allows things to happen but he's in control the only one that's leading this and has power over is him is God is the one that's in control he has the force he created all things and everything is under his control and nothing takes place that he doesn't know about so uh I just want to look at this this morning now we know brother Bram was speaking one time and he was speaking about how in the beginning he was speaking of God and he said that in the beginning God was the father he was the vine and he goes on to talk about that Jesus was the branch now if you go back into the book of uh in Jeremiah and U believe in Isaiah in the book of Jeremiah talks about the branch of that he would put forth A A righteous branch and bring forth a king there was a there was a prophecy made and that prophecy was made and the person that was that was the Messiah that was a Prophecy of the Messiah and brother R says see he was the he was the branch to Bear the fruit of God he said now he becomes the vine and we become the branch he said and all that God was he he poured into Christ he said but listen all that was in Christ was poured into the church he said the works that I do shall ye do also more More Than This shall you do for I go to my father you see we are living under our god-given privileges that God has redeemed us to so we know that he started out as the the vine or I'm sorry as the branch because he was the one that came he condescended come in flesh and began to manifest what the word and he said as we read here in a little bit that when Jesus came he said I can do nothing in myself except what the father shows me he said that's the the son likewise so the son was doing Jesus done exactly what the father showed him to do and that's the only thing that he became to manifest because when he began to speak to the disciples and tell them he said they were looking he said let show us the father he said have I been so long with you that have You' not seen the father so that's what his job was to was to manifest the father to show them God that was God before them and so see we have been redeemed to this we've been redeemed to this place that you and I have been placed into this into this bride into the body and so we have become the branch that's come off the vine he said I am the vine you're the branches and he said you bring forth fruit amen and so as he began to do this he said say we we live below our god-given privileges that God has redeemed us to that's right so all all the Redemptive blessing are yours and mine this morning we have we have been sitting set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and he said brother Ram said he said what did Christ redeem us for did he ever did you ever think what he redeemed us for why didn't he just make you the atonement say there's no need of giving them deep Powers there's no need in making this man a Son of God there's no need in doing that I would just ask him to believe it and write his name on The Book Of Heaven that'll settle it but he gave these redeem redeemed blessings that we might operate the work of God by the energy of the Holy Spirit he said St John 15 says he said I am the vine and ye are the branches do you know that the vine can't bear fruit although the fruit is in the vine but the fruit cannot be brought forth from from a Vine it has to have the branch to Bear the fruit he said and you are the branches now the Vine with all its energy now listen this the Vine with all its energy cannot produce anything unless the branch is willing to receive the energy he said now God is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit and now if he's depending on you let's open up our Channel Chels and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts so we have to realize that God has given us something and you know what the the opportunity has been set before us and we have been made to this position God has opened it up for us and the only thing is is do you allow God to work in your life because he said you know he said we live below our god-given privileges here we are this morning sitting here and God has given us all that we have need of and and blessed us to be here and all these things but you know what we live below what God has given us we walk in such a defeated State come on come on brother but you know I I I you know because if you understand that that when you when you're living in in the in the power that you have what what you have that what you've been given by the new birth yeah if you realize who you are this morning and what you have then you can claim what belongs to you this morning you can you can walk in all these things that God has given you you don't have to worry about you know it's like well I I I I want to know if if if if this if God will allow me to do this or or do that or or can I get healed or any of these things but you know it's just like as brother Bob was preaching Wednesday night see when you come back to realize that you you know because the message has brought a restoration and by the restoration has brought you back to the place that you should have been so if you if you've received that restoration then you say well I'm not where I ought to be well praise God the restoration is in progress and the power is still there to bring you back to the place where you ought to be because just like that sister said that morning he she stood up and said I want to say one thing said I'm not what I ought to be but let me tell you what I'm not what I used to be thank you Lord well because she could see something had Tak place and realize that she's come somewhere right amen see it's the same way with you and I see the devil wants to tell you well you're not you're not anything and you're not going to make anything and and you know all these things the devil likes to tell you and try to put in your in your path and in your mind well you know what if he's talking to you you know it's a lie true brother because the truth's not in him yeah but he says brother man says here he says see he said a little while and the world will see me no more when he came he said the been speaking to the disciples he said a little while and the world will see me no more he said he said the world order he said they will see me no more yet ye shall see me he said that's the elected the church he said for I will be with you even in you to the end of the the world Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever The Works that I do shall ye do also he said do you believe that he said the Church of he said the Church of Christ is the branch and it says if you go to the branch and you don't find the fruit of the vine then there's something wrong it isn't the branch Christ Jesus but if it is in the branch Christ Jesus it'll bear the fruits of Christ because he was he was the the branch that was in the vine and what he done was he brought forth exactly what the father had amen because he was because he said he said search the scriptures and them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me so show me where I didn't fulfill the scripture as he began to speak and walk and he said look all the things that had been written of him he said that's exactly what he fulfilled he he walked and as he went forward everything that that was spoken of him was made manifest and he went back and he began to talk about the scripture and he said well how is it that that that when they began to talk about the the uh prophets and and things the prophecies that were made and he went back and he pointed out the scriptures and began to lay them out and show them what the what the Fulfillment of the scripture was right just like when when they asked him about about John the Baptist he said Elias truly shall come and restore all things but I tell you he's already coming you didn't know him right and then oh we that's John the Baptist see they couldn't believe they couldn't believe that that he came is there anything ever come any good thing ever come out of Nazareth well where's that where's that in the Old Testament that a king that a messiah is coming out of Nazareth but but they didn't realize that he was born in Bethlehem according to the scripture right but the scripture said that he would be a Nazarene but see some of those scriptures people didn't actually believe those scriptures ever spoke of the Messiah it's like well I don't you know I don't see that as as the Messiah because but it took it took the prophecy it took the word to reveal that and show that that that was what what was meant by the prophecy amen that's right when he went back and everybody's like we see they that's the reason the Jews doesn't don't always see and we understand that that they're blinded in the day that we're in the hour we live because God blinded their eyes but you know they don't see those things why because the light has never shown on that that the scriptures that are written in the scripture actually speak of the Messiah and that's the reason many times that they stand up and and deny that Jesus Christ is the Fulfillment of the word is because those scriptures don't don't because when what they see in the scripture in the Old Testament does not speak of the Messiah but in the New Testament you go back and read those scriptures and they go back just like he said out of out of Zion out of Egypt I called my son amen see they don't see the duality of the scripture but in the Fulfillment of that then it says that it may be fulfilled of what was written see it takes the opening of the word the Holy Spirit has to Quicken the word and the opening of the word see Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he saidthe son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing he said for whatsoever things the father doeth that doeth the son likewise and he'll show you greater than this that you might Marvel he said the father worketh and I worketh hither too and he's speaking of see the the son began to do the things exactly that was spoken of him that he would do and he began to walk and he walked in a realm of perfect Faith because he saw the things that the father showed him to do and he just he just done exactly what the father showed him to do and he was walking in the realm of perfect faith and he said see he said the things that I do ye shall do also he said and greater than this for I go to my father he said is that true he said if ye abide in me and my word abide in you ask what you may and it'll be given he said that's either right or wrong Hallelujah so it's either correctly what he said because that's what he was saying here in the scripture he said that you're going to bring forth this fruit and you're going to and these are the things that are promised to you that you're going to bring forth much fruit amen but as you bring forth this fruit he said every tree that brings every Branch that's bringing forth fruit he said it's going to be purged that it brings forth more fruit right and he said and he said he said herein is the father glorified that you may bring forth much fruit so there's many things that you have to go through and you know as we were speaking of last time you know when everybody talks about you know wanting to have you know wouldn't it be great if we had them you know the experiences that brother brandham had and we had all these things we could see what brother brandham saw and all these typ things and you know as we were talking you know brother brandham but there's a lots of times that brother bram's experiences when you go back and look there were lots of times brother brandham didn't didn't know anything he's like brother he said God I don't understand and he's stand there he said Lord I'm just walking by faith and everybody thinks well you know the Lord just woke brother brandom up every morning and just showed him everything and he got to see you know the the clouds parted and he just had these great these great Revelations these Visions just broke all the time and he saw everything well he didn't show brother Brandon everything there's a lot of times that brother BR didn't understand things even when people come and asked him you know they would bring him qu uh dreams and and different things they had questions for and brother brown stand there saying I don't know but he had to go through the exact same thing that you and I go through and people it would be wonder you know if we just had brother brandom but you know what the same God that was in brother brandham is here today but you know what you and I have to walk by faith it's the same it's the same thing that brother brandham done so it's the same it's say you go through the same thing that he would do so here as we walk through this way he said and Jesus said brother said he said that Jesus said that he would come back and be with us he resurrected from the dead lives among men tonight working in his church and he said and the real tree believing Church sees Jesus the same yesterday today and forever now if Jesus was here on Earth tonight in a physical body like I am he's in the form of the Holy Spirit God took his body and sat on the right hand and glory on the throne and sent the spirit back as a covenant to the people he said and we're sealed by that Holy Spirit baptism which gives us a touch of God's life in US Zoe the life of God in us he said now we become the sons of God that makes you believe no matter what that's God's word I believe it we believe it so if the same life that was in you and I that was in him it's the same life as we are the branch and we bring forth the life from the vine then he says if we yield ourselves to that then as it brings forth the life that's in there will produce exactly what it's supposed to do because we see it does the exact same thing he said see when he was here he was a branch also so he brought exact he brought forth exactly what he was supposed to manifested exactly what was that was that was spoken of him that he would do that he said God was in him and he said God's in us and he said it's the vine he said what will the vine do he said the vine per furnishes the energy to the branches he said is that right and he said and the branches bears fruit so if he's bringing forth the fruit just like he did previously and we do the exact same thing then he said just as when Jesus was here he said you are his hands you are his mouth right he said he said he has no other hands but your hands he has no other eyes but your eyes he has he has no the life our life is his life he said he puts his life in us he said we live the life that we would live it if he was here on the earth in a physical form so the same life that he would live is in you the same life that he would live if he was here because it was the same life that he lived previously when he was here in a physical form and he said if he was here in a physical form then we would live the same life he said while the body is sitting at the right hand of God making intercessions he said oh isn't that isn't that beautiful so you understand that when he's talking about the life that was in him it's the same life and it'll do exactly what it what it set out to do what it done in the beginning it'll do today so the same life that if Jesus Christ was here in a physical form and he was walking on the on the Earth right now that life what it would do would do the same thing in you and I he said he said oh isn't that beautiful he said that just knocks all the kings out of unbelief to me he said it just makes it so real to understand the same life that was in Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago if it's in you this morning it'll do the exact same thing amen amen and the only thing that you have to do is you have to yield yourself to that how how wonderful to realize who we are that we have the life of the branch he said he said if we understand he said we he said what did the vine what did the vine do when it put forth a branch see when Jesus came and and he walked on the face of the Earth and he began to speak to the disciples and he began to tell them what was going to take place they walked for three three and a half years hearing this message and as as he began to speak to him and he began to tell them what was going to take place and then he told him he said but he said but T in Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high because you know what he preached them the word he taught them the word he swed the word in them but you know what it come to a time when the Holy Spirit came and it quickened the word that they held and you know what it brought forth exactly what took place on the day of Pentecost is exactly what was the same life that was in Jesus Christ became born in 120 and they began to do exactly the same thing that's it when they walked out there and they thought they were drunk men but you know what they realized that those men had been with Jesus when those women had been with Jesus the exact same thing came forth and was brought was manifested exactly what was said was going to take place when when Peter and the 11 walked out there that morning he said these men aren't drunk as you suppose s it's the third hour of the day but he said this is that that was spoken of by the prophet Joel he said I will pour out my spirit on All Flesh and then they began to prophesy and tell them what would take place and when they began to tell them what would take place then they went back and told him said listen this is what the prophets had said this is what David had said in the Psalms and he began to bring that straight out and began to un to make them understand to understand that the life of Jesus Christ the ministry that Jesus had what y'all had just seen in a man that that y'all thought it was be above and everything but this was the Fulfillment of that scripture and they began to explain to them exactly what took place all the way through the scripture and then when they began to hear that then they were pricked in their hearts and they said men and Brethren what shall we do to be saved would just pick up your your uh your Cloud picture make sure you get a Bell Buckle tow around some message books come on and if you wear your hat make sure you to it on the side and drive a Ford but now what did they say well wear your robe like Jesus done whatever jesus' favorite fruit we're going to eat the same fruit that Jesus did we're going we're going to dress and walk just like Jesus amen hallelujah but it wasn't impersonation right it was a manifestation that's right right they weren't trying to impersonate Jesus it was a manifestation of Jesus why because it was what's on the inside that came out and he said what we must be he said you must repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit not just trying to not trying to put on a an act or anything but it was the manifestation of the same life right right it was a manifestation of what was on the inside that began to be manifested on the outside and brother Bram said see he said when that first Branch put forth he said they put out it would became the Pentecostal Church in the beginning he said in that same Pentecostal church he said now if the second Vine the second Branch does the same thing and he said they wrote a book of Acts behind the first Branch the first Pentecostal church he said if it brings forth the second Branch he said then they'll write another book of Acts behind it he said we don't see but he said the problem is that people don't believe in Pentecostal he said they don't believe in having Pentecostal in the churches anymore he said he said well what is it he said it's a grafted Vine he said they're grafted in but he said they're not living off the original they're living off the original life but it's not the original Branch he said he said because they've grafted in the men's ideas and men's thoughts and everything he said but when that Branch puts when that vine puts forth an a bran original branch he said it'll bring forth the exact same thing he said it'll match just like it did in the beginning see one of the things that people were talking about was when when they talk about oh look look at all the the great things that they done the Miracles the signs and the Wonders but the problem is is one of the things that they miss when they when they talk about that first Branch when it put forth you know what they were rejected they were despised everybody came against them you know what they didn't have it they didn't have it a real easy way of going why because there was there was God God had a way and they said if if they treated Jesus the same way he said then they done them the same way and he said they'll do you the same way they were rejected they they were despised they were hated they done the exact same thing to Jesus and that's exactly the same way if you bring forth the same thing then it's going to be the same way they they don't want the truth they don't want to hear what the truth is the truth is rejected they want they want to just have their own ideas they just want to have something that's you know simil or uh easy but it's not easy it's a hard way to go but he said see but you're energized by the by the Light that's in the vine he said it'll bring forth his spirit will bring forth his Works he said if you're in Christ he said it's got to because it's the vine of God he said he said now watch what kind of nature it brings he said it brings forth the same fruit it did when it was here it's back in the church bringing bearing forth the same fruit making another Pentecostal church just the exactly the same it did the first time he said now that church sealed their testimony with their blood they were godly people they love God they stayed with it right amen and it's the same way it's the same thing that you and I have to go through just like they did they sealed their testimony with their own blood but you know it brought them through and so it's the same way with you and I it's the same battle you're going to be rejected and despised but you know I want to take my way with the Lord's despise few just the same way as they did see when you see that when when God brought you see you come to this place and just as they did you come the same way that they done you come through this justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring you into the same place that they came to it's the same work of the Holy Spirit God called you wherever you came from brought you out of whatever you were in and he said he brought you and he called you into this and you know you responded to that call there because there was a day that God had that because you were one of his that you know what the word was going to cross your path one of these one day and you know what the light struck your path and you know what you saw who you were amen because you know I I realized one day when I when I was out in the world and I was enjoying myself but you know there come a time you know that didn't that didn't have any enjoyment for me anymore you know what I be I don't know about y'all but I've become miserable there were times in my life where I was just totally miserable with things but you know what God began to deal with me and you know what he began to show me the path that that I needed to take I bring me to a place and you know I had to come to a place and realize you know what I as brother Louis was saying this morning you know you come to a place Lord I don't want to live like this anymore I don't want to live like this anymore I I want to I want to surrender because he began to show you a better way he began to show you a better way and I Lord I want to walk that way amen and you know you began to realize who you are I realize I'm a sinner I realize I'm not where I ought to be but praise God he's made a way that you can come in amen that you can leave you leave your past sins that's right amen you know and you you see that you know he can clean you up and and take care of all these things and yet you know you see that you you begin to walk on this pathway that God is leading you and you as you begin to walk then you realize you know I'm going walk the way God wants me to walk and begin to go forward and you think well I've got all of these things in my life that I I you know I don't know how all these things are going to take place and I I I all you see is all the sin and all the problems that you have and all all these things it's like Lord I don't know how I'm going to get through all this but you know all all you can do is repent and start walking yes and that's and that's all you do Lord I don't know because why because when you get to a place of sanctification you know what it takes the Holy Spirit to clean you up and you realize you can't do it yourself but you know one thing I was listening to brother BR he was talking in the message he said what does it take to make a Christian Life and he begins to talk about he said see he said God sent his big b bulldozer down and cut the thing all to pieces he bulldozed it up and scraped it off and I thought that was so good because we sometimes we look at our lives and think Lord there's so much in our lives how are we going to get rid of all of this how are we going how are we going to take because we all we see is all of the problems that we have and all the all of the things that we've got to overcome and you're like well it's so impossible and sometimes we get overwhelmed with the things that we've had to face and not realizing how am I going to give up because you know sometimes you're so Bound by things because you say well I I was so Bound by smoking or or music or different things like that and sometimes it's a real challenge because you know what you fall and you keep you keep going through the same thing the same rut you just keep going on and on and on but you know what praise God one of these days God sent his bulldozzer in there and he began to scrape out everything I know I know well praise God you know because you know we we see how big the things in our lives are the biger challenge that we have the big structures that are in our lives and we think how are we going to overcome that well you know what the grace of God the power of the holy spirit will come in your life and it'll wipe it all out because greater is he that's in in you because he's greater than any problem that you have whatever is in your life he's greater than that and he will destroy all the strongholds that are in your life you think you can't overcome but you know what he's going to over he'll show you that you overcome he'll overcome through you if you just yield yourself to that thank you Jesus see there's a great big bulos that's gonna come in and just think I don't know how I'm gonna get through this I don't know how I overcome these things but you know what praise God the holy spirit will come and you'll see one of these days you'll rise up and you think well I have fallen a hundred times well guess what you get up 101 times and you keep going and one of these days you're going to find out that the Holy Spirit you're going to overcome that amen so you know you like well I I don't know I'm I'm so Bound by these things I'm so Bound by these things I was listening to brother Josh Bennett when he was up there at the camp you know he talking about you know that's what the devil wants you to do is you know is be down on the young people so much that you know that well I fail this time and I fail this time you know just keep going amen don't give up you know because for every you because I can count probably a half dozen young people that I've SE where you know they just allowed the devil to beat them up and they just fall apart and they never go beyond what they were at why because they gave up too easy because you know what the devil sold them a bill of goods that actually had no belief in it had nothing in it it was just a pack of lies and they believed it and they've allowed the devil to run rough shot over them but you know what there's there's been kids that have been bound by pornography and everything else that you can imagine smoking and drinking and all kinds of other perversions that's in the world but you know what they kept going and had faith in Jesus Christ to clean their lives up to free them from that and you know what when somebody come and told them listen you don't have to live like that you can take this you can take this and he will free you from that why because the the right has been given unto you if you will believe it and all of a sudden there's these young people come up there and they say you know I was bound by this and that and and all these other things when you know you talk about some of these young people when they when they're coming in prayer lines and they're standing there saying if the Lord doesn't do something for me I'm going to commit suicide when you see the the challenge that is placed before them you know what all you got to do is believe the devil's a liar that's it the devil wants you to believe that you can't overcome but let me tell you something there's a church full of people sitting here this morning that you know we overcome so many things in our lives if you go back and look what God has done for us what he brought us out of to where he's brought us this morning there's nothing that our God can't do right all you got to do is believe him that same spirit that same spirit that if he's done it for one he'll do it for another sir that's right he's here this morning to meet your need all you got to do is believe him he doesn't but the devil doesn't want you to believe that see there's so many people that they just devil wants you to look at everything else but take what God Said look what God Said Yes sir brother BR is talking about see the work of the Holy Spirit he said the Holy Spirit turned over the 10 Can Alley dumps you upside down sweeps the devil's stuff out of there and creates a new heart and a new life he said but not only that he moves in to see that everything goes all right he said glory to God he has the caretakers the angels that prunes the trees see you see the things that have went on in your life well guess what God is here and you know we we've all can testify to that that God has come in your lives and whatever you whatever you you think is so so hard that you can't overcome then you know what God has done greater there's people here this morning that has seen God come on the scene and do the miraculous and you know he's the same one why because if he started you on this journey there's no power in hell that's going to stop him he comes in and he said he going clean that up shake all of the devil stuff out sweep it all out bulldo it out and then he's going to come on the scene because if he's the one that started you on your journey to bring you to a place of sanctification and burn all of that stuff out and drive the unclean Spirit out then you know he's there to bring you to the place that you can be filled with the Holy Spirit he's there because if he's the one that justified you Sanctified you then he's one that's obligated if you continue on the same Journey the same Faith he's obligated to fill you with the Holy Ghost amen that's his job because he said the caretakers are there the angels of God are there to bring forth the word right see it's the same life if we he done the same thing in the past then it's the same thing he'll do today yes right see God has given us these things Amen to show you he's here to speak to give what you what you have need of whatever you whatever you're looking for amen he'll energize youen see and it's and it's for us and it's not and it's not just one but you know each one of us has has a job to do just as you know as as brother uh brother Dale always said about you know when we dedicate children to the Lord he said you know each one of us is to live a life before those children that they can see Jesus Christ that if they were looking for a Godly example then we're supposed to live that life in front of them see each one one of us is supposed to do that each one of us if if somebody's looking because they say well you know the devil's trying to tell them well you you can't overcome and this and that and you know what you see people that over have overcome so many things yes and you you know well you know I I've fall in this or that you know what there's somebody here that's overcome it that's right that's right and don't get so play you know you get to the point where you know well I'm too I'm too ashamed well you know what there's plenty of us here this morning that you know there's lots of things in our lives that you know we would hate for everybody know what we've done in the past you know we're ashamed of our past but you know what it's the grace of God that brings you to this place to cleans you up frees you from those things and brings you to the place where you ought to be you what and you say well I don't know if I can overcome you know what all you got to do is trust God because you know there's people that can stand up and tell you all the things that they've been through and it's so wonderful when you hear these people talk about their testimonies of what God's done in their lives to see how God's brought them through and it's like well how did they ever make it well it's because God brought them through but why did what but why did God bring them up and have them Testify the things that they've been through and how they've overcome why because it's to give you faith that you can overcome also amen that you can see the same that God has done the same thing well if if he's done it for one he can do it for the same for another see he said see he doesn't have any hands but our hands he doesn't have a voice on Earth but ours he said how many knows that he said sure he said he said I'm the vine you're the branches he said the vine doesn't bear fruit it energizes the branches the branches bears fruit he said he uses he said he said no listen he said I am the vine you the branches he said we lay our hands on the sick he said it gives us he uses us to see Visions he uses our lips to speak he uses us to pack the gospel see it's given unto his church and he's in his church manifesting himself and the people can see him as he works in his church see when people are looking for Jesus Christ when the when the world's out there looking they're looking for something that's real it's you and I that he's look that he wants to speak through and manifest himself through amen that you can see I'm that I can show the world Jesus Christ and now it's just not something that I done but it's what God has done for me what God has done in my life it's the grace of God not what I done because I didn't do anything good there was nothing good in me but it's what God done through me God done this work through me but he started me on this journey and he's kept me all this way and he's leading me on through that I can that I can tell that listen there's nothing that God can't do that God can bring you through whatever you're looking for in this in this life God will bring you through amen see all you got to do is trust trust God and and you know you see the the condition that the world has gotten into but you see but there's God has has a provided way he's he's got a provided plan and all you got to do is put your trust in that and just trust what God has done but see the problem is is you know we people have gotten so mixed up and so many things that you know that if you don't just trust God and just put your faith in the simple gospel and it's see you see how people have gotten so confused and so mixed up on things it's like well how are you how are you ever going to become free if you can't just trust God Amen and Trust just put your trust in the simple gospel right you know um I was listening you know I was on I was on the on the twoof face book and uh uh well you know that's that's what it is but you know it's it's it's it's pitiful but you you see the condition that the world is in today but you know you know there's so many people that have gotten to this place now in the world you know they don't they don't even try I mean they they say they believe this message they they say that they have their trust in it but the problem is is they don't yeah true and when you when you see because you know the thing is you know God works in continuity so you know when in the beginning God called men and he and he's led men all the way through and he's and he's had prophets and then later on you know he had Church age Messengers from you know Paul and you know Paul when when he was there in the in the first church age you know and he was begin to speak you know he wasn't the only one that God ever spoke to that he actually because he actually had a five-fold Ministry that was actually men even when Jesus began to preach the gospel it was it was the word made flesh and you know what he sent he sent disciples out to preach and then and then and Paul Paul wasn't the only one Paul didn't go out there and tell Peter like listen I'm the I'm the I'm the prophet of the age I'm the I'm the messenger you just need to be quiet and I'm G to speak but here's here's Paul speaking and he said and he gave some Apostles prophets evangelist teachers and pastors for the perfecting of the Saints till we all come to Unity of the faith so here's the here's this group so as it all the way down through time even in in in the patmas vision you hear brother brandham talk about he said he said the the voice of many Waters he said what was the voice of many Waters he said it was the voice of the ministers in every age the voice was singular yes go back look he said the voice of the ministers plural in every age singular so then there were multiple ministers in every age that were speaking according to the voice of their age amen was speaking according to thus sayith the Lord right and it was the same life it was the same Ministry and then all of a sudden we come to this into the end time and everybody's got to the point well you know what if if God works according to continuity then how is it that brother Bram was speaking and talking of a five-fold Ministry when they're in in questions and answers on the seals brother brandham they asked brother brandham they said will the bride have a Ministry before the Rapture he said yes it's going on right now amen and he says it consists of Apostles prophets P pastors evangelist teachers right but you know what he said it'll be so humble amen you know what hey you you you show me where brother Brown I'm done away with the fivefold ministry and you know what you show you show me somebody a true fivefold Ministry M uh one of the ministers in the five-fold ministry and show me where they try to take you away from the message that's right if if you're God called into the five-fold ministry even even if you're just a lan member but you know what everybody's going to point you right back to what the prophet had to say that's right that's right because rapturing faith lies in those books and tapes the rapturing faith lays right there that's where God wants you to be right in those right in those books and tapes but you know what because but the same God that pointed you right there into those messages where the Prophet is speaking is the same scripture that he said this is the absolute and tell me where he took out Ephesians 4 but when people come up there and you know they they want they want to act like they're so uh put against and and cut off well how how in the world are people that that are supposed to believe this message and then all of a sudden it's like well you know what we're going to take that out we're taking that out well let me tell you what the same life that was in the beginning it's if it's in you and I and we're able to draw from the same life that you know what it's the same life that spoke through Jesus that created all things that set everything in divine order and he brought and sent a prophet in our day all the way down through seven Church ages began to speak and fulfilled exactly what the scriptures said and he came and brother BR began to speak exactly what thus sayith the Lord was matched according to what the scripture had to say then you know what if it's the same one that could speak then you know what it's the same one that can speak to you and I and give us the exact same thing to say because you know I have I have I have full confidence that God sent a five-fold Ministry and God speaks to them and gives them exactly what has to be said and you know what I can put my confidence in that because you know I can put my confidence in everything that brother brandom said and I can sit and I can rejoice and listen to those books and tapes but you know what I can sit and listen to a five-fold Ministry preach and I can Rejoice on that too amen and I can I can Feast I can Feast on a five-fold Ministry and I don't I don't have one bit of problem with it I thank God for it because you know what if it hadn't been for them I wouldn't be where I'm at today but it t it takes the word but you know you see these people that come against them and you know when you when you begin to question these people about well you know we're just going to push play and we're not going to have anything else well you know what then then how is it that you can have confidence in God and put your trust in everything that he had to say it's like but we can't have you can't trust that so you're telling me that the same God that said all these other things put everything else in motion he can't speak to another human he because you know what we're just we're just up here saying what we we're just saying our own thing well this this is just this is just Aaron Roberts but you know I can see that God can speak through a man just like just like he did all through out through history hisory it's the same thing and you see these people and they and they they come against them and it's like listen show me where we're just supposed to push play just show me where we're we're not we're not we don't have to we don't have to have a fivefold Ministry or we're we're just do we don't about all these things just show me where it's written I and I I was I was talking to a brother the other day and and you know that's what happened to him he was brother show me where these things are and I and I and I I sent the brother a message and I told him I said brother I really appreciate what you had to say he's a minister and the way he handled things and I thought you done a really good job trying to show somebody Christian love and trying to show them you can disagree with somebody brother R said what we can dis bitterly disagree with one another still love one another amen but you know the problem was is this this brother took took what was said and when when when this Minister asked him some questions you know he got all upset then when when the the conversation was done he deleted it all and then he wrote well this brother you know done this and was trying to take us away from the Mana and all this kind of stuff and he said well I had to block him you know I had to delete all this stuff and I was like well where where in the world is any of that showing the love of God right and it's like then you you delete everything that was said and then you write you take it totally out of you totally misrepresent what was said you take it all out of context and then you write what you want and then you like well I'm defending the faith you know brother Bram said you know if you're going to if you're going to draw me outside your circle that's all right I'm just going to draw my circle bigger and draw you right back in exactly amen and it's like well you know where one of we're one of the Lord's despised few well you know what if you're pushing people out you're not one of the Lord's despised few because you know what we're going to reach out to everybody we're going to do all that we can to help everybody we're going to do what we can yeah and we're going to reach out and we're going to try to help but you know what they're the ones that walk away just like brother Lise was talking about this morning your friends you try to show them Jesus Christ but they're the ones that are going to walk away that's right right when Jesus began to speak to there in John 6 when he began to speak to them they walked away from him he didn't he didn't turn his back on them right they rejected him and it's the same way you and I we're trying to reach all that we can and try to help all that we can we we want them to un we want them to see Jesus Christ because that's what because that's what is the heart of God to reach the lost that's right to reach those that don't have those that are confused and that's what the brother was telling me about when I when I wrote him he's said well you know this brother's just confused he said all you can do is pray for them but you know it's it's not that we're trying to do what but you know we we want them to see the truth yes and and it's so sad that people they've got their own ideas and you can't you can't tell them oh it takes the Holy Spirit to to do that for them they can but God wants us to do what we can to if if if we have that life on the inside then you know what it's if we yield ourselves and that's what our job is to do is to manifest that life to the world that they can see Jesus Christ see energizing us to this see leading us that way see we see these things that God is trying to do he wants you to see these things see if if the life is on the inside if he's if he's making this manifest then whatever you have need of this morning he's here to me it amen he's here to do whatever you have need of whatever you're looking for this morning see he was saying he said he said he being in the vine energizing your heart to believe now this this is Brother bam speaking in a in a um in a prayer line and he's doing discernment and say he said he was speaking to this woman and he was standing there and he said see he said is God using us as branches he said he said I'm yielding myself and you are believing he said he said then God will make will make known what you have need of make it known to us he said he said see he was standing here this morning right now and he said Lord you know he said I I want I want to be healed he said well Lord would you heal me he said he said I've already done he said I've done that at Calvary he said ' don't you believe it he said he said he couldn't do it the second time amen he couldn't do it the second time why because he's already done it the first time correct he it's already finished this morning that whatever you have need of he's hereu and all you got to do is receive the benefits of that that same life that dwells in you he said if it raised up Jesus from the dead it'll Quicken your mortal body and all you got to do is believe it see you just take him at his word see and it's your testimony God can see Christ in you by your testimony see how beautiful that is see brother bandam I have the musicians come this morning I just got I'm going to skip some of this but we see how it was and I just want to finish with this this morning we we've just got a few more minutes and I want to finish but I don't want to I don't want to go over our time this morning see we see the things that God has brought us through the things that we see brother BR says we realize that this is a like experience of a Chris he said sometimes we have to go through terrible chastisement chastising of the Lord let's all stand this morning many things to correct us that we'll bring forth will be fruit bearing Christians he said sometimes he has to prune us cut off take away take away our our hands he sometimes we think oh God what are you doing to us but he knows what he's doing so we pray father that today that you'll prune every one of us from the least to the greatest God we pray that you'll prune away you'll prune every one of us take away all that's unlike you father take way the thing that's hindering us from being fruit bearing Christians he says if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or a daughter of God he said we have a right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God bring them back he said if he's Afflicted you and made you sick you have a right before God to enforce the laws of God he said by his stripes you are head it said bring amen bring him back turn him loose you're taking him out here under death and we claim him bring him back so if you have a need this morning whatever you have need of that God is here to meet your need right and you think well you know what I've not lived the kind of life that I want to live and the devil's hindered me and I've allowed the devil to hinder me to from being what I ought to be then you know what you can lay a claim this morning and take back all your god-given PR Privileges and you know what and you say Lord I want to be pruned this morning I want all the things that are not like you I want all of them removed I want I want all of them to I want it to just be more like you in every situation every aspect of my life I don't want to have the devil to have a foothold and on anything then you know what you can make a claim this morning and you know what I'm going to pray and I'm GNA allow God to work this morning Lord have your will and way with us
