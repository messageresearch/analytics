[0:00] you know something else
[0:03] Proverbs is next so we just may continue
[0:06] right in
[0:07] The Book of Proverbs
[0:10] from her breeding now
[0:15] we've been talking
[0:18] on his tactical project man obviously
[0:21] for six this is now number 69. and
[0:25] um
[0:27] we have uh Richard is not working
[0:31] hello hello hello hello hello
[0:38] he had it working but it's not working
[0:40] now so
[0:42] anyway
[0:47] Richard came down here and fixed the
[0:49] thing and had it working and we both saw
[0:51] it it was working and now it's not so
[0:53] Richard walked out of the room that's
[0:55] probably why
[0:59] so we have been talking about the Statue
[1:01] of a perfect man now for a long time and
[1:03] we're we're not coming to a close but
[1:06] we're gonna come to a pause Maybe
[1:08] thank you
[1:10] because I you know like I was telling
[1:12] you
[1:13] um
[1:14] starting the first Sunday in January I'm
[1:16] going to be taking both Services through
[1:17] the month of January and into February
[1:20] so and then the first weekend in
[1:22] February we're going to be at brother
[1:23] Joe Greene so you'll be doing Sunday
[1:26] school the whole month of January so if
[1:28] they don't like you you're going to
[1:30] really prove it
[1:35] but you'll have the whole month of
[1:36] January and then then after that of
[1:39] course I'm going to Philippines for
[1:40] three weeks so the rest of you will get
[1:43] to fill in so be prepared and be ready
[1:46] that we want to
[1:49] go back to where we were
[1:52] and get my history up here because we
[1:54] were going through a bunch of stuff last
[1:55] night and I keep uh
[1:58] tagging my history and
[2:00] I got to get back down here to where we
[2:02] were
[2:06] gonna be reading that
[2:11] I'll be reading that everyone living
[2:17] I tagged a lot of things we start
[2:19] talking about stuff and I'll tag it and
[2:20] then we can go back see if we start
[2:22] talking about under the blood so you can
[2:24] mark it and there you are you're right
[2:26] back to
[2:27] what you need to this is the neat app so
[2:30] maybe you don't have it you need to get
[2:31] it it's free but
[2:33] it's a
[2:35] It's a Wonderful tool last night we were
[2:37] talking about free moral agent we were
[2:38] talking about representation
[2:40] and I was looking up the quote where
[2:43] Adam took Eve to himself and I couldn't
[2:45] find it because you've got to put in the
[2:47] the right thing it's not the person
[2:50] uh your soul was black you're born
[2:53] between Satan and need you can really
[2:54] look up a lot of things
[2:56] real quick
[2:58] to uh
[2:59] there it is
[3:03] to uh
[3:05] like last night in the Bible study we
[3:07] were talking about certain things and
[3:08] you could pull the quote up where
[3:09] brother Brown said it just like that and
[3:12] kind of
[3:14] kind of reiterate what's going on so
[3:16] here we are on the Statue of perfect man
[3:20] right here on this one this is the
[3:22] one-on-one right here
[3:23] at Broly kind of stand the love of God
[3:25] the Holy Ghost Christ and the person of
[3:27] the Holy Ghost comes upon you and the
[3:29] true baptism I know we've stayed on that
[3:30] a long time but what I want us to see
[3:32] and we're going to do some more of that
[3:35] upstairs in in January with the whole
[3:38] congregation
[3:39] but the most important thing is the new
[3:42] birth
[3:43] knowing that you're born again knowing
[3:46] that God can even start putting these
[3:48] virtues in your life
[3:50] for those of you that weren't at the
[3:52] Bible Study last night that's what
[3:53] brother Dale's been that's his concern
[3:57] is that we may just be in sanctification
[4:01] all these years or we may just have a
[4:03] sensation that I've been in the message
[4:05] and I can see look like I said before
[4:09] at 14 years old I could tell you what
[4:11] serpent seed was I could explain to you
[4:13] what happened in the garden Through the
[4:15] Bible and I wasn't even born again
[4:16] that's just the ability to read
[4:19] we have a lot of people in this message
[4:21] that just have the ability to read
[4:24] because their life don't prove it they
[4:26] don't come to church half the time they
[4:27] don't do the things to the Lord all the
[4:29] time then you know it's the life is
[4:32] what's going to show because you can
[4:34] take
[4:35] as brother Brandon used the illustration
[4:37] in Blasphemous names about the the
[4:40] peacock with or the crow with the
[4:42] peacock feather stuck in it it's going
[4:43] to look like a peacock sometime
[4:46] but those feathers are going to get
[4:48] shook out one day and you're going to
[4:50] show your true colors what I want to do
[4:51] is I want us to I'm not I'm going to
[4:54] read them off the Capstone because
[4:57] we got to come here first
[5:00] well if we if we if we don't come to
[5:03] here
[5:06] let's let's just say for Surety you want
[5:10] to understand what the seals are you
[5:11] want to understand what those things are
[5:13] the true when I say the true message of
[5:16] brother Brown that doesn't mean that
[5:17] part of it was false but brother Brown
[5:19] came to do one thing or two things
[5:21] actually but one thing he came to
[5:23] specifically do that no man had ever
[5:26] done before is to bring this down to a
[5:29] group of people which is the seals the
[5:32] Thunders and the things of God that no
[5:34] man has ever looked at before right here
[5:37] man there's been many men come to this
[5:40] right here
[5:41] many men
[5:43] First Church age was full of these
[5:45] Brethren and sisters okay full of
[5:48] brothers and sisters they had all these
[5:49] working in their life so brother Branham
[5:52] did not come to bring us the Statue of a
[5:54] perfect man it's always been there he
[5:57] come to bring us the completion of the
[5:59] Statue of the perfect man because
[6:00] remember the Bible says The Headstone
[6:02] was rejected all right so if the
[6:05] headstone was rejected
[6:09] then that's all they had
[6:11] if the headstone was rejected they
[6:13] didn't it's just like the natural
[6:14] pyramid doesn't have a cap on it yeah
[6:18] right why does it have a cap on it
[6:20] because it's a type of right your
[6:23] journey
[6:24] so you and I must have these virtues
[6:27] working in our life and then the Holy
[6:29] Spirit
[6:30] the Holy Ghost Christ and the person of
[6:32] the Holy Ghost comes upon you and the
[6:34] true baptism of Holy Ghost and you get
[6:36] all these virtues sealed in you
[6:39] that says sealed in you it doesn't say
[6:41] it gives them to you
[6:43] read that
[6:45] you already got them right that Holy
[6:47] Ghost doesn't give you the virtue
[6:51] but it is the same holy ghost that gives
[6:52] you the virtue
[6:54] but at this stage or at this stage of
[6:56] development that Holy Spirit is sealing
[6:58] the virtues in it's making sure that
[7:01] that vessel will work
[7:04] and it'll work for God not for man all
[7:07] right so that's why he says see he says
[7:09] in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:12] not that this one's false
[7:14] but this one up here is more of the same
[7:17] one that gave you the virtues
[7:19] but this one doesn't come to give you
[7:21] any more virtue it comes to seal in what
[7:23] you have
[7:25] and you get all these virtues sealed in
[7:27] you then God lives in a tabernacle
[7:29] called the building now he lived in it
[7:31] down here
[7:32] but remember he lived in it in the park
[7:35] that you let him live in
[7:37] and it's a seed plant that's right
[7:40] everything well this is you don't you
[7:42] can't plant up here all right
[7:46] you don't plant the seed in the air and
[7:49] it grows from seed to stalk I mean seed
[7:52] to stalk to leaf
[7:55] yeah
[7:57] she's planted here's your roots because
[7:59] that's your foundation just like a big
[8:01] tree
[8:02] it's got a big wide Foundation
[8:05] and then it grows up
[8:07] then what happens is all the fruit is
[8:09] where not Naruto it was at one time
[8:14] it was in the sea the root at one time
[8:16] as we're all that's what's
[8:19] so profound about nature
[8:22] I've got apple trees that apple tree
[8:25] comes from one seed but now out of that
[8:28] one seed that we planted in the ground
[8:29] or a man did we bought it when it was
[8:31] about this high
[8:33] hundreds of apples
[8:35] have come from that that has seed in it
[8:37] that if you plant it in the ground it'll
[8:39] bring forth another several hundred same
[8:41] thing with God that's the spiritual
[8:44] multiplication of God
[8:46] is
[8:48] remember it's not seized as of many but
[8:51] one seed which is Christ right so out of
[8:54] that one seed comes a many membered body
[8:57] now we got people in the body Wesley
[8:59] Luther Columbus Martin irenius and Paul
[9:03] and then this age Wesley and all those
[9:05] in here and they got to a certain part
[9:08] of this
[9:09] but they could not attain to this part
[9:14] of the cap coming down
[9:18] because when Jesus was walking on the
[9:20] Earth
[9:21] it was the whole pyramid the whole every
[9:24] bit of that pyramid there was nothing
[9:26] now when he was rejected man cut him off
[9:30] in that way said the Bible said he was
[9:31] rejected he was a rejected Stone in
[9:34] other words the stone was cut off
[9:37] so man couldn't attain to that right at
[9:40] that time
[9:41] everybody okay with that when he died
[9:43] and went to heaven
[9:44] The Headstone went with it he was The
[9:47] Headstone he was the head of the church
[9:50] all right and um like we were talking
[9:52] about last night
[9:56] we'll talk about the seed dolphins and
[10:00] um
[10:01] it just came to me that if if
[10:03] see Jesus was standing on Earth
[10:07] in his body
[10:10] and the little one at the well was
[10:13] standing there well now if he would
[10:15] imparted eternal life and I know what
[10:16] brother Brown said but you got to
[10:17] remember what he said
[10:18] but if he imparted he Colonel life to
[10:21] that woman standing there as the new
[10:24] birth
[10:26] that's two bodies standing there and you
[10:28] can't have that
[10:29] I don't know if anybody got that last
[10:31] night or not but you should understood
[10:32] that there's no way because remember
[10:35] Jesus breathed on her disciples and said
[10:37] receive ye the Holy Ghost well now they
[10:38] didn't get the Holy Ghost
[10:40] because he was the body
[10:42] If he if they would received the Holy
[10:44] Ghost they would have become his body
[10:46] right right exactly right so he had to
[10:50] go up though and send that Holy Ghost
[10:53] down to make them the body of Christ
[10:56] right
[10:57] so he was gone
[10:59] the world will see me no more but you'll
[11:01] see me in other words you're going to
[11:02] see me inside of you you're not going to
[11:03] see me physically because brother
[11:05] Branham explains many times that brother
[11:08] Brown can't um that Jesus Christ can't
[11:10] come back to this earth
[11:12] until the Millennium that's when all of
[11:13] his bodies together again that's when
[11:15] everything's done and redemption's over
[11:17] for the Gentiles and for the Jews you
[11:20] understand what I'm saying when you come
[11:22] back in the Millennium the the
[11:23] Redemption is over for the Gentiles of
[11:25] Jews I didn't say redemption was over
[11:27] because he's still Redeeming the foolish
[11:29] version at the white Throne he's given
[11:31] people eternal life so he's still
[11:33] redeeming right up to the Future home
[11:35] coming down and to me see the future
[11:37] home is the type of that where's it
[11:39] coming down it's coming down on the
[11:40] Earth
[11:41] all right the future home is coming down
[11:43] to me this is the future home
[11:46] that is the future home that's where
[11:48] everything lays is in that Capstone
[11:50] message
[11:52] so what we've got to do is though is
[11:53] with this year coming up if you want to
[11:55] make a New Year's resolution make this
[11:57] one that you're going to be standing
[11:59] right here by the end of the year
[12:02] and the virtues are going to be working
[12:03] in your life not trying to find them
[12:05] that's right all right and that's for
[12:08] all of us we all need to have this
[12:10] before we can even understand this
[12:11] that's why I don't that's why many
[12:14] people
[12:15] I believe in the message have false
[12:17] Doctrine is because they're presuming
[12:20] they're venturing without Authority
[12:23] that's what presuming is venturing
[12:24] without the so they're venturing way up
[12:27] here
[12:29] and maybe some of them have not even
[12:30] here yet
[12:34] you can't you can't teach a false
[12:36] Doctrine and be here
[12:38] that's right
[12:39] now you might could teach a false
[12:41] Doctrine when you're just born again and
[12:43] you're getting started as a baby because
[12:44] babies make mistakes hey how many of you
[12:47] kids said something that they weren't
[12:48] supposed to right
[12:50] same way with you and I you know you
[12:52] hear the old kids say something you go
[12:53] where'd that come from we'd see that
[12:55] that's just that's the growth
[12:56] development of the child same way with
[12:58] here you might say a few things but you
[13:00] know what once the true words presented
[13:03] to you
[13:04] you will turn from that because you'll
[13:06] have what you'll do is you'll receive
[13:09] virtue from whoever that was that's
[13:11] delivering it to you
[13:13] so we're going to break that down a
[13:14] little bit more when we do it upstairs
[13:16] with the whole congregation
[13:18] that virtue that strength has to come
[13:20] from
[13:22] a Spirit-filled person
[13:24] that's not just a baby in Christ
[13:28] because babies
[13:30] put five babies in this room
[13:33] leave them alone and come back five
[13:35] years later you'll have a problem
[13:38] right because this Baby's teaching
[13:40] babies babies do baby things right so
[13:46] you gotta have an adult there
[13:49] to lead those children
[13:52] up into adulthood
[13:55] same way with God
[13:58] God raises his kids the same way you
[14:00] raise yours it's just that he don't make
[14:02] mistakes when we do
[14:03] all right
[14:05] but as we come up through here that's
[14:07] virtue coming from someone you must get
[14:09] the correct knowledge
[14:11] they've got to have Temperance and
[14:13] patience with us with us
[14:15] as congregation got to have godliness
[14:18] and brotherly kindness you've got to
[14:19] have all those things working because I
[14:21] can't I can't tell you about virtue if I
[14:23] don't have it
[14:25] and virtue has to be something that's
[14:27] comes out that you pull from the
[14:29] minister upstairs you pull that virtue
[14:31] if he don't have anything you know what
[14:33] you're going to do you're going to sit
[14:34] there just like we do and we hear a
[14:36] false Doctrine upstairs watch something
[14:38] happen something clicks or something
[14:41] rings in your heart it's not really a
[14:43] true virtue
[14:45] right that's right I'm certain you're
[14:47] right you're tuned to certain things
[14:52] your tune to a certain thing and you're
[14:54] hearing you're hearing you're hearing
[14:56] all of a sudden boing
[14:58] and you know what you do you know you
[15:00] and your thought Hey listen we're humans
[15:03] and we're sitting there listening
[15:04] and then all of a sudden something comes
[15:07] forth that we have not been taught that
[15:09] maybe is not correct or even that we
[15:11] don't understand now see there's a
[15:12] difference between that that's right
[15:14] I've sat and listened to people that I
[15:16] didn't understand yeah
[15:18] yeah but you got to stay open enough
[15:20] that's right to listen
[15:23] consider the end of the conversation
[15:25] right but then there's people that sit
[15:28] there that you're on the line you're
[15:29] listening you're listening and all of a
[15:31] sudden
[15:32] he said all right
[15:35] there's a difference in that there's a
[15:37] difference because with the way you're
[15:39] taught is you come up to a certain place
[15:41] and you're drawing virtue
[15:44] sure you can draw Hey listen they drew a
[15:47] certain amount of virtue from Judas his
[15:50] character
[15:54] sure they I said a certain amount I
[15:56] didn't say Godly because it wasn't
[15:57] boring it I said but they drew certain
[15:59] amount of virtue from Judas because
[16:01] Judas preached the gospel and people got
[16:03] healed people got saved or not saved but
[16:06] come to the to the word of the hour
[16:08] right everybody understand that so Judas
[16:10] did have Judas was in tight was
[16:13] justified and Sanctified right joining
[16:16] even in a Sanctified condition that's
[16:18] why the anointed ones at the end time is
[16:20] so
[16:22] hard to see but it's really easy to see
[16:25] once you see it that they are here
[16:28] they're not coming they're here and
[16:29] they've been here since this first
[16:31] church age
[16:32] I know anyone's attend time is us but
[16:35] there have been anointed ones Paul said
[16:37] Grievous wool
[16:38] they've come among you and are now here
[16:41] he said
[16:42] but what brother random has done he has
[16:45] come to restore that
[16:47] bring that back up
[16:49] but then bring a message that no one
[16:51] else brought except the man that was
[16:53] standing here with the headstone Jesus
[16:55] Christ he was standing here with that
[16:58] anointing on him
[17:01] because he was the son of man all right
[17:04] so you get to the son of man Ministry
[17:06] this is the son of man Ministry this is
[17:09] the Son of God Ministry everybody okay
[17:12] with that yes yes this is the Son of God
[17:14] Ministry this is God in spirit form in a
[17:18] human being doing the work just like he
[17:22] did on the day of Pentecost Son of God
[17:25] this is the son of man Ministry but I
[17:27] want you to I want you to take this one
[17:29] point though if Paul was a holy ghost
[17:32] filled person and he had the Son of God
[17:34] living in him that was God in human
[17:36] flesh
[17:38] what is the son of man
[17:44] the son of man never left the Earth
[17:47] it just was hidden
[17:49] from man it was even hidden from Paul
[17:51] because he didn't come to the position
[17:53] but now that we've come up to here and
[17:55] we can look back down through here you
[17:58] see that is the Son of God Ministry but
[18:00] it was God in human flesh working
[18:02] through group people so it was the son
[18:05] of man Ministry the whole time yes
[18:07] they just was he just wasn't revealed
[18:10] brother remember said to be revealed now
[18:11] look
[18:13] to reveal something is not putting
[18:15] something together and then saying here
[18:17] it is now to reveal something it's there
[18:19] all the time that's right anybody got
[18:22] that it was here all the time right it
[18:25] just had to be made known or had to be
[18:27] revealed the seals listen Jesus preached
[18:30] the seals in Matthew
[18:32] 24 right
[18:34] but who knew that
[18:36] even Paul didn't know it
[18:38] but see it wasn't time for The Headstone
[18:40] Ministry to come it couldn't come down
[18:43] here right it had to come there had to
[18:46] be a bribe tree there had to be the tree
[18:48] eat down restored back and then the
[18:51] headstones come down everybody
[18:53] understand that
[18:54] right Paul couldn't preach the son of
[18:58] man Ministry
[19:00] like brother brownham preached it and
[19:03] put all this together now Paul was a
[19:04] pattern messenger
[19:06] right Paul was a prophet he was a
[19:08] patterned messenger he was the one you
[19:09] patterned everything by
[19:12] but he wasn't given
[19:15] the uh Revelations 10 7.
[19:19] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[19:21] angel when he begins to sound the
[19:23] mystery of God should be finished now
[19:25] Paul didn't finish that mystery Paul
[19:28] says in the Bible I finished the mystery
[19:31] in which I am called I think we read
[19:33] that last night
[19:34] Paul finished the ministry he was called
[19:37] for
[19:38] which was not the son of man ministry
[19:40] that's right all right so did Irene it's
[19:42] Martin Columbus Luther Wesley but when
[19:45] we come to this age the first part of
[19:47] Malachi 4 was the son of God of ministry
[19:49] from 1947 to 1963 was the son of God
[19:53] restoring the gifts back restoring and
[19:56] to me when I say gifts the first thing
[19:57] you think of is what
[20:00] being in tongues
[20:02] there's nine spiritual gifts those two
[20:06] are the least of the two of the nine
[20:08] there is these spiritual gifts that we
[20:11] must have in our church working to be a
[20:14] strong church that's why Ephesus was a
[20:16] strong Church there was 12 people but
[20:18] those 12 people were full of the Holy
[20:20] Ghost and had these virtues working in
[20:23] their life okay not to say they probably
[20:25] didn't have any problems but you know
[20:26] what they had a lot less problems
[20:28] all right because of that son of man I
[20:31] mean that Son of God Ministry being in
[20:32] their life all right
[20:34] so the Son of God Ministry down through
[20:37] seven churches brother around him say he
[20:38] died son of man raised Son of God why
[20:40] did he die son of man because that was
[20:42] the word in flesh that's right all right
[20:44] yes he raised back up the word in flesh
[20:48] but when he come back on the day of
[20:50] Pentecost he didn't bring his flesh back
[20:52] that's right
[20:53] that's right okay he didn't bring his
[20:54] flesh but his flesh didn't come back he
[20:57] sent back the Holy Ghost equipping the
[20:59] Flesh of the people that was on the
[21:00] Earth yeah
[21:07] so anyway
[21:10] he didn't send his place right
[21:12] that's why that's why the Holy Ghost
[21:15] couldn't be given while Jesus was still
[21:17] in the Earth
[21:18] that they'd be two bodies that's right
[21:20] yes it'd be two bodies it'd be Jesus and
[21:22] his own body right here on the earth
[21:23] same time now Heidi you say well that's
[21:25] going to happen in the Millennium that's
[21:27] when everything's over that's when all
[21:29] Redemption is over that's why the soul
[21:31] of man cannot have anything in it but
[21:33] sin and and death and sorrow
[21:36] until Jesus comes that's right and
[21:38] redeems that soul
[21:40] if any Soul that's standing on this
[21:42] Earth had Jesus in them that was two
[21:44] bodies and there's no way that can
[21:45] happen
[21:46] Jesus died son of man
[21:49] that flesh died
[21:51] but it raised back up the Son of God
[21:54] which is Spirit God is the one that went
[21:56] to hell and preached to those people
[21:57] there who else right Jesus says flesh
[22:00] didn't go to hell
[22:01] this is flesh stayed up here that's a
[22:03] sacrifice it stays in the Tomb right
[22:05] here but the soul went to hell preached
[22:07] to the people down here all right son of
[22:10] God he said I'm the Son of God I'm the
[22:11] one you turned down
[22:13] then he comes back and picks that body
[22:15] up quickens it
[22:18] all power and Heaven on Earth been given
[22:19] unto me so he had control over the Flesh
[22:22] and and in spirit how many Soul had
[22:24] control over the flesh at that time he
[22:26] said well they had control later no he
[22:28] said not my will but thy will there was
[22:30] a factor in there that he was human when
[22:32] he was here
[22:33] though it was almighty God there was a
[22:35] factor that he could be tempted and all
[22:37] these things when he come back up out of
[22:39] that grave he could not be tempted he
[22:41] was done finished and over with he was
[22:43] the almighty the one that stood before
[22:45] the foundation of the world he had just
[22:46] picked up a body of Flesh that he was
[22:48] supposed to have had there not been a
[22:49] fall he had to come down here
[22:52] get a body of Flesh take it back up
[22:55] glorified
[22:57] send back the Holy Ghost into a group of
[22:59] people then now that's God in human
[23:01] flesh on the Earth
[23:03] but the understanding was the son of God
[23:06] God Spirit God
[23:09] that's why Paul never called him son of
[23:12] man
[23:13] Irene has never called him son of man
[23:16] they didn't understand that that sure
[23:18] they said well I've got it Paul said I'm
[23:20] God in human flesh that's what he's
[23:22] telling us you'll be judged by my gospel
[23:24] if an angel comes from Heaven preaches
[23:26] anything besides what I preach let him
[23:27] be a curse
[23:28] so what was Paul saying whatever God was
[23:31] was standing right there in Paul
[23:32] speaking to those people
[23:35] but he never had the understanding see
[23:37] brother Brown then comes and God gives
[23:39] him the understanding
[23:42] 63-65 gives him the understands that hey
[23:45] that's me standing there in human flesh
[23:47] in yeah and that's what's going to
[23:50] change those people that's the only
[23:51] thing that's what couldn't change Paul
[23:53] Irene is because remember
[23:56] let me get this right
[23:58] the son of God
[24:00] is not commissioned to change your body
[24:06] until the end time right right that's
[24:09] right because Why didn't it change
[24:11] Paul's body down here when the Son of
[24:13] God entered in when he received a new
[24:14] birth
[24:16] the commission was just for remember I
[24:19] will restore
[24:21] you say Joel Joel is what kept me from
[24:23] doing I will restore what's that brother
[24:26] absolutely
[24:28] it wasn't all fulfilling Paul Paul never
[24:30] spoke of the son of man as Jesus spoke
[24:33] of himself but he did speak to Jesus in
[24:36] the pure form for that day
[24:38] but you keep coming up coming up the
[24:40] word was eat down word was being
[24:42] restored and it comes back up to Malachi
[24:44] 4. turn the hearts of the babies
[24:47] children to the fathers back here
[24:51] brother Brown had to bring them back to
[24:53] that Foundation he said you lettering
[24:55] people
[24:56] he said you think you've had the latter
[24:57] rain which is up here which is the
[24:59] Harvest drink you you think they think
[25:01] you you think you've had that rain
[25:03] he said you've never had the former ring
[25:06] first which is the teaching or the
[25:08] planting right here
[25:11] he had to get everybody back to right
[25:12] here
[25:14] then he could work them up right and it
[25:17] took 50 years after he's been dead for
[25:20] us to just begin to realize we need to
[25:23] amen
[25:27] after he died
[25:29] 50 years after he died to realize that
[25:32] that was not just a good sermon in
[25:33] Priest yeah
[25:35] it's like a brother said and I really
[25:37] enjoyed it and I think I mentioned it
[25:39] the other day brother brother Mike Ortiz
[25:42] I tried to you know bring it in a little
[25:43] bit
[25:44] but it's the centerpiece
[25:46] but you've got a table full of food
[25:50] but what does that centerpiece do that
[25:52] Center piece draws your attention to
[25:55] what's on the table right
[25:57] right and it draws it into the center of
[26:00] the table to me
[26:02] brother made a good point he said this
[26:03] is the center of the message that's
[26:06] right because of you and I'm going to
[26:08] try to draw that I'm going to try to do
[26:09] that and we're going to try to do it
[26:11] upstairs on the screen
[26:13] to bring us up because that's got to be
[26:15] the centerpiece before you get SEALS or
[26:18] chains of the body or son of man
[26:20] Ministry or anything over here that's
[26:22] got to be your Center focus that's right
[26:24] it's right there
[26:26] to me that's the hinge
[26:28] that's the hinge Point we've got people
[26:30] working down in here and that's fine and
[26:32] okay but brother Brown said God will
[26:35] have a mature Church
[26:37] a mature this is a mature church this is
[26:40] not but we got to go on beyond the
[26:42] mature Church part right
[26:44] Ephesus was a mature Church
[26:47] because they had all these working in
[26:49] their life yes but they didn't have this
[26:52] this was rejected this was left off the
[26:55] body wasn't complete
[26:57] there has to be a group of people
[27:01] that that Divine love has to come down
[27:03] on
[27:04] and that is adoption
[27:08] remember we see we we receive in Romans
[27:10] 8 we receive the spirit of adoption
[27:13] right whereby we cry daddy day our
[27:15] father father we don't receive adoption
[27:17] there there's a process that goes
[27:19] through that I was like the analogy we
[27:21] used with the the kids with the car now
[27:23] the kids got all the faculties that he
[27:26] needs
[27:27] he's a human you got a brain he's got
[27:29] arms he's got legs he's got eyes he's
[27:31] got an ear if you can see you can smell
[27:33] but why don't you give a five-year-old
[27:34] car the keys to your car
[27:37] he's not mature enough
[27:39] he's not mature enough to be able to
[27:42] handle the situation same thing with
[27:44] these virtues
[27:47] if you're not mature enough God's not
[27:49] going to give them to you
[27:50] so you've got a mature as God adds them
[27:54] to you on the way up through your
[27:56] journey and remember it's life and
[27:59] godliness so it's your life that you
[28:01] live bless the godliness that you show
[28:04] right that's true yes sir well it's not
[28:08] like it's not like uh you're pushing
[28:11] yourself into these things like I got to
[28:14] get some some virtue yeah you know so
[28:16] okay I got about you all right now you
[28:19] know and uh
[28:21] and that's how it kind of makes it makes
[28:23] you feel like you know that you can't
[28:24] right but I like what you just said that
[28:26] that you know God knows when you're
[28:28] mature enough to come to the next point
[28:31] and it's not like a like I said I've
[28:34] never liked these lines but it is lines
[28:36] there for a reference
[28:38] because it's not like you're gonna fill
[28:39] a tank up and you're gonna say well now
[28:42] brother Luis you got to buy a quarter
[28:43] tank of virtue there you need you know
[28:45] no no that's that to me they ought to
[28:48] turn them this way
[28:49] virtue goes all the way up and always
[28:51] goes all the way up Temperance you don't
[28:53] you don't get virtue and then say well
[28:55] I've done that
[28:56] you know Anna Anna is almost a doctorate
[29:00] got a doctorate degree now she can't
[29:01] she's not going to lay down what she
[29:03] learned in kindergarten
[29:05] no that's the foundation she's built
[29:07] upon all that to get those degrees same
[29:09] way with this like brother Brown said he
[29:12] said you try to jump up here
[29:14] he said you'll fall right that's right
[29:17] don't try to jump up here
[29:20] I've always said God will show you where
[29:23] you at at any time he'll make one thing
[29:24] happen and listen if you fail one time
[29:26] with God one time
[29:28] you know one thing for sure you don't
[29:30] have it that's right one time now God's
[29:33] gracious he'll give you some time but
[29:34] still there'll be one point you'll say
[29:38] I don't have that no more
[29:40] I don't have that awful feeling I have
[29:42] toward people or that awful this or that
[29:44] that or that you know Temperance I got a
[29:46] lot more Temperance I got one more
[29:48] patience okay Lord I'm becoming more
[29:51] like you you've shown me that I'm
[29:52] becoming more like you I'm doing the
[29:54] things of God instead of doing the
[29:55] things of the world
[29:56] so there's somewhere in there that
[30:00] you're going to know
[30:01] because God's obligated to tell you yes
[30:04] see just like just like the world I'm
[30:06] gonna make this point and then we gotta
[30:08] go
[30:10] the world says
[30:12] that when
[30:13] uh ibigen reaches 16 years old
[30:17] according to
[30:20] the books and according to history and
[30:24] according to uh you know doc they build
[30:27] it on all kind of things
[30:29] she can drive a car
[30:31] at 16 she has come to a point well now
[30:34] how did that come to man just didn't say
[30:36] well 16 is a good number we'll just no
[30:39] there's something that goes with that
[30:40] there's there's
[30:42] um research there's there's research and
[30:44] development statistics there's
[30:46] statistics what I'm looking for thank
[30:47] you there was their statistics well you
[30:49] know where your statistics are
[30:51] right there right here this is your
[30:54] statistics sheet brother Brampton when a
[30:56] man possesses these kind of things then
[30:58] the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter
[31:01] you might speak with tongues impersonate
[31:03] any gift God has you might do that but
[31:04] until these virtues here go into you
[31:07] you're still off the real true
[31:09] foundation of Faith but when these
[31:12] virtues grow in so it's a growth
[31:14] development grow in and you added that
[31:17] to that then you are a living Monument
[31:19] you are a living moving item
[31:25] not a motionless person all right
[31:28] any questions
[31:36] Maybe
[31:37] this is a thing I mean when you have a
[31:39] set of page too there you go thinking of
[31:42] the event
[31:44] that's right you bring you understand
[31:45] that yeah you bring this is Christmas
[31:47] time so we have a theme we have a
[31:48] centerpiece that brings the theme of the
[31:50] event in well the theme of the event
[31:53] to get this thing right here and I call
[31:55] it a thing I'm sorry but this this
[31:57] headstone to come on this church this
[32:00] living it don't come on dead people
[32:02] comes on live people so it's got to come
[32:04] on the people that are alive you've got
[32:06] to see that that centerpiece has brought
[32:09] you to the the theme of this whole thing
[32:10] is it's getting the virtues
[32:13] then God can give us
[32:16] The Headstone which is the seal for the
[32:18] body change that's what the seals were
[32:20] given for was a change of this body
[32:22] there's not been a requirement in any
[32:24] other age but this one to have our body
[32:27] change while we're still alive everybody
[32:29] else had just enough word to get them in
[32:31] the grave and get them out of the grave
[32:33] in 63 brother Brown was the only man
[32:36] that had that right absolutely he was
[32:38] the only man him and Jesus Christ are
[32:40] the only two men that we know for a fact
[32:42] had it at that time in 63 up until 65
[32:46] but Jim remember too he died
[32:50] last night
[32:53] you can be baptized you'll do this
[32:56] you'll do this I promise right if you've
[32:59] got to get these promises down here
[33:00] first or you can't that's the jumping up
[33:04] the ladder
[33:05] brother rush things and jump up three
[33:07] rounds to fall off
[33:10] the future
