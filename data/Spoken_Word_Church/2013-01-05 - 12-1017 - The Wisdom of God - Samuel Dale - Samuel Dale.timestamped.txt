[12:17] you know and I want to you know just how
[12:19] how you can pray what would you pray and
[12:23] and so I got thinking I said well if you
[12:26] want somebody to pray for you what would
[12:27] you well you know
[12:29] but you want to pray for your salvation
[12:31] your healing
[12:32] uh things like that you know
[12:35] and you know I thought the thought come
[12:37] to me is what I need more than anything
[12:38] is an increase in my faith
[12:41] and then I told Brother Ray about it and
[12:44] he sent me a email back and that's Luke
[12:46] 17 5 I believe it is but that's what
[12:49] they were praying for was an increase to
[12:51] be fair the other day you're watching
[12:54] uh the thing up in The Minister's
[12:57] meeting
[12:58] and Wade had something to say about it
[13:01] uh you know that the times and all of
[13:05] that you know and not this really
[13:07] doesn't mean a whole lot but to
[13:09] understand it will increase your faith
[13:11] that's what he said that's right you
[13:12] know and I found I believe sure what we
[13:15] need is an increase right in our faith
[13:18] Lord just be with her touch her you
[13:21] don't know we don't know what the
[13:22] situation is right but let's run number
[13:24] one 36 in Red Book

[23:32] when you come here one time you're a
[23:34] visitor you get welcome
[23:35] you come two times you don't get
[23:37] welcomed a second time because we
[23:41] like yeah we're just part of the body of
[23:44] Christ amen so just make yourself to
[23:46] home and
[23:47] you know pray that the Lord with bless
[23:50] you amen amen you'd like turning your
[23:52] scriptures turn to Luke
[23:54] 11 we're not going to be on the seals
[23:57] tonight we're coming I'm going to inject
[23:59] the message
[24:00] into and if I get through I'll inject
[24:03] one if I don't I'll inject two but uh
[24:06] you know we'll try to do that it's just
[24:08] something as a matter of fact brother
[24:10] colleague read the scriptures and I I
[24:12] had them all underlined our Sunday when
[24:15] he was reading the responsive reading
[24:16] and I said well I've been intended to
[24:18] preach on that for a long time and I uh
[24:21] he just read part of the scripture there
[24:23] and we'll get to that in a little while
[24:24] but we'll try to carry on with that amen
[24:28] now remember the announcements now we've
[24:30] we've had so much problem with trying to
[24:33] get a Christmas time operating in the
[24:36] correct order of the dates and the times
[24:37] for everybody to where we can have our
[24:40] dinner together so what I thought we'd
[24:43] do this time if you want to is we'll
[24:45] just not have a Thanksgiving dinner
[24:48] and we'll move the Christmas dinner back
[24:52] like one Sunday I think it'd be this in
[24:55] December the 9th because we figured we
[24:57] couldn't do it on the first but be
[24:59] December of the 9th I believe is correct
[25:01] and we will be having on that Sunday our
[25:05] Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner
[25:07] together right because that'll get cut
[25:10] down a little bit on on the sisters of
[25:12] fixing and doing but just remember that
[25:15] and we'll keep announcing that until the
[25:18] time in order where we can remember
[25:20] Terence has made all the other
[25:21] announcements she'll remember each and
[25:23] every one of them let's pray together
[25:24] Luke 11 49 and we'll also go with First
[25:28] Corinthians 2 1 through 8.
[25:34] Heavenly Father we thank you for you
[25:36] loving your grace our kindness and to us
[25:38] thank you for grace and Calvary and
[25:40] peace and joy and thank you for
[25:43] everything Lord
[25:44] and we ask you now that you would just
[25:45] come on the scene tonight to speak to
[25:47] our hearts and our lives that we may be
[25:49] what you want us to be
[25:51] we can read your word but it takes you
[25:53] to unfold it to where we can have
[25:55] understanding that's what we pray for
[25:57] more than anything in the world it's for
[26:00] you to move on the scene in our hearts
[26:01] and our lives forgive our sins
[26:03] cleanse us of all unrighteousness and
[26:06] keep us in your love blessing God each
[26:08] one you said you sent your word and
[26:10] healed us and delivered us from
[26:12] destruction so we believe you and we
[26:15] expect you to do that Lord have your way
[26:18] now in Jesus name
[26:20] amen
[26:23] and we'll go to Luke
[26:25] 11 49 first then we'll go over to First
[26:29] Corinthians 2.
[26:32] he's talking about the the lawyers was
[26:35] arguing with him backwards and forth and
[26:38] he said you're you're blind you know you
[26:39] build a Supple to church and things like
[26:41] that and your father's killed him and I
[26:43] want to use verse 39 just as a point
[26:48] for that verse 49.
[26:52] therefore also said the wisdom of God
[26:58] no that's very odd reading yeah
[27:02] we're going to find out that wisdom can
[27:04] speak
[27:07] um
[27:07] therefore also said the wisdom of God
[27:11] I will send them prophets and apostles
[27:14] and some of them they shall slay and
[27:17] persecute all right so remember that now
[27:21] because that's what'll be the time of
[27:22] the message wisdom of God
[27:25] all right verse 2 of SEC First
[27:27] Corinthians 2.
[27:29] and we'll go one through eight
[27:32] and I Brethren when I came to you came
[27:35] not with Excellency of speech or of
[27:38] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[27:41] of God see not with his brain not with
[27:43] intelligence right right for I
[27:46] determined not to know anything among
[27:49] you say Jesus Christ and him crucified
[27:52] I was with you in weakness and in fear
[27:55] and in much trembling
[27:57] and my speech and my preaching was not
[28:00] with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[28:04] right
[28:05] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[28:08] of power
[28:10] that your faith should not stand in the
[28:12] wisdom of men
[28:15] but in the power of God
[28:17] albeit we speak wisdom
[28:20] now what
[28:21] he's telling you the wisdom when man is
[28:23] no good so now he's changing something
[28:25] else right right albeit we speak wisdom
[28:27] among them that are perfect
[28:30] well ain't nobody perfect what the Bible
[28:32] says you are so forget it
[28:34] yet not the wisdom of this world nor the
[28:37] princes of this world that come to knock
[28:40] but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[28:43] mystery even the hidden wisdom and watch
[28:47] it
[28:48] which God hath which God ordained before
[28:51] the world
[28:52] unto our Glory you may be seated the
[28:56] Lord that is blessing to the re of the
[28:59] word
[29:00] and we're going to be talking about the
[29:02] wisdom of God
[29:05] and it says here in Luke it says wisdom
[29:09] speaks and says I'll send you prophets I
[29:11] sent you this I sent you that you killed
[29:14] him in other words you've crucified them
[29:16] you know so wisdom can speak
[29:21] that's right it's not you're speaking
[29:24] being of
[29:25] and I'll get this point in right up
[29:27] front it's not speaking then just of of
[29:30] an intelligence
[29:34] it's not speaking of a man's Wisdom
[29:38] and you might find out at the end a
[29:40] little more about wisdom
[29:43] when it comes to the point of finding
[29:45] out that
[29:47] wisdom has always been
[29:49] the wisdom I'm talking about amen
[29:52] but I'm not talking about man's brains
[29:54] and human intelligence or or any form
[29:58] I'm talking about Holy Ghost wisdom
[30:01] right amen or the wisdom of gods right
[30:04] now keep that in your mind all right so
[30:06] we see then that Luke says wisdom can
[30:09] speak
[30:12] and in Corinthians we read that
[30:16] we must speak
[30:18] right
[30:20] because Paul said I I speak wisdom
[30:25] I speak wisdom
[30:29] to them that are perfect
[30:31] I bet we see we speak wisdom among them
[30:34] that are perfect
[30:35] not the wisdom of this world or nor the
[30:38] princes of this world that come to know
[30:40] but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[30:44] mystery
[30:45] so now the wisdom of God then is a
[30:48] mystery amen
[30:50] he said well let's just Holy Ghost
[30:53] well I think brother Gary one time was
[30:55] telling me about something that he said
[30:57] something the Lord spoke and said when
[30:59] just not the Holy Ghost you know yeah so
[31:01] we just want to make it some kind of a
[31:03] form of speaking and doing but we're
[31:06] going to talk about the wisdom of God
[31:10] and how that it can speak
[31:13] how they can talk
[31:15] so it's more than just
[31:18] the thoughts of man's mind
[31:22] and you'll see when we get to the end of
[31:24] the message that is even more than
[31:27] um
[31:29] a revelation from God
[31:32] and he said wait just a minute now well
[31:35] hold on to the end we'll get to it and
[31:37] we'll see if that's right or not all
[31:39] right but we'll think on that
[31:42] not Holy Ghost not man's Wisdom
[31:46] we were talking about the very wisdom of
[31:48] God
[31:50] the very intelligence of God Amen
[31:58] that causes this Holy Ghost knowledge
[32:00] that we have or Holy Ghost wisdom
[32:06] then that means it's of God right it's
[32:09] not of you and I amen amen it's of God
[32:12] see that way then we can uh
[32:17] put her confidence in amen
[32:20] and find out that there's a lot more to
[32:22] just thinking of well that's just Holy
[32:24] Ghost wisdom
[32:25] but uh in the pyramid that's knowledge
[32:29] you know but wait a minute do we read a
[32:32] few things about it
[32:36] but think on these things now
[32:40] wisdom can speak
[32:43] in our confession must be
[32:46] according to what he says because that's
[32:49] he makes intercession Upon Our
[32:51] confession right right profession
[32:53] confession
[32:55] all right so it's got to be what he says
[33:00] yep that it's been given to us
[33:05] and then if it's God's wisdom it must
[33:09] not only become an intelligence to us
[33:13] you know our brains in Reading studying
[33:18] it must become a very part of us
[33:22] amen
[33:25] so then you know we can we can
[33:27] deal with those things I really enjoyed
[33:31] brother Aaron's message there Sunday uh
[33:34] when he first started off I'd wondered
[33:36] which way it was going and you know I
[33:39] was kidding him about it I said well
[33:40] you've done good I said you didn't even
[33:42] make one Rabbit Trail yeah you know you
[33:45] generally goes for a while and then he
[33:47] goes off and then he has to back up and
[33:48] start again but I thought he'd done an
[33:51] excellent job
[33:52] of what he was trying to express to us
[33:55] you know and uh you know I had no stops
[33:59] as a matter of fact I have them if you
[34:00] want to look at it laying on my desk I
[34:03] had written down before he started
[34:05] speaking
[34:06] some things to speak about
[34:09] and then when he came out I said well
[34:11] okay we'll just let him say it people
[34:13] don't want to leave me anymore let him
[34:15] say it maybe they'll hear her in the
[34:17] second opinion you know it ain't an
[34:20] opinion in the Holy Ghost but I really
[34:23] enjoyed it because I'm like deer smokes
[34:26] we talk about former letter Reign we
[34:29] talk about uh you know what is here and
[34:32] what's not here
[34:34] you cannot have the latter rain
[34:38] unless the former rain is sold that's
[34:40] correct amen what is the need of it see
[34:43] now your your Pentecostal people
[34:46] they have what they call ladder rain
[34:49] but it's it is the how pouring of the
[34:53] spirit right right now you're going to
[34:55] argue of the prophet and the Bible or
[34:58] with them it is the outpouring of the
[35:00] spirit Cody said I part my spirit on All
[35:02] Flesh all right
[35:04] but yet the problem they have is what
[35:09] the word
[35:11] right right that's it they have just
[35:13] enough of it to make it work yep that's
[35:15] quoting the prophet just enough of it to
[35:18] to make it go and do and the healing
[35:21] comes the signs and the Wonders comes
[35:23] and all like that right
[35:26] and to look at other churches about the
[35:29] country and seeing denominational
[35:31] churches and you would find probably
[35:34] more uh signs and wonders a lot of times
[35:37] better than you find here are among the
[35:39] Believers of the message
[35:42] because that's what they deal with
[35:44] right they're only working according to
[35:47] that manifestation
[35:50] all right but you're going to ask them
[35:51] about the faith of the fathers yes we
[35:54] have it look at the signs and wonders
[35:58] what is their basis right
[36:01] we have here among us today
[36:04] what is in the book of Acts
[36:07] we have the the signs and wonders taking
[36:10] place all right
[36:12] but without the word
[36:15] amen being there how can you judge it or
[36:18] determine anything about it right
[36:21] Lee then
[36:26] without a character within us built by
[36:29] the word
[36:30] then what we have is not worth anything
[36:33] right right
[36:35] even though we can have the great signs
[36:37] and wonders
[36:39] and the great thing can happen and you
[36:40] can say well they have more signs and
[36:42] wonders than the Believers of the master
[36:44] time argue with me I'm on a great week
[36:47] all right sure
[36:51] but the basis is they don't have the
[36:53] word right amen right you see you ever
[36:55] think about how to work because look
[36:56] what none you didn't listen to what I
[36:57] said you need to quote run around and
[37:00] said they take so much of the word
[37:05] and make it work
[37:07] all right
[37:09] now
[37:10] until then there's there's got to be
[37:12] something that you know
[37:15] has to be in you and I
[37:18] in this end time and that's what I
[37:20] believe Aaron was getting at it because
[37:22] that's what I was following along
[37:24] I believe in signs and wonders I want to
[37:26] see God Among Us more than ever before
[37:29] right amen I cry out every day never
[37:31] service
[37:32] before I come out here I ask him to use
[37:35] me and my friend want to go you know
[37:37] Lord this this that scripture that I
[37:40] quoted you know
[37:42] he sent his word among us to heal the
[37:44] sick
[37:45] man and I believe it's delivered amen I
[37:48] believe it's delivered a lot of people
[37:50] amen I believe it's here to uh uh
[37:54] anything that we have need of right
[37:56] we've seen things happen we've seen the
[37:58] dead raised the sick heal right we've
[38:01] seen great things happen Among Us just
[38:03] in this little group right all right and
[38:06] by doing that we haven't put our bases
[38:09] upon trying to make it work that's it
[38:12] yeah we put our faces upon trying to get
[38:16] an understanding of the scriptures right
[38:18] by the Holy Spirit
[38:19] not by man's Wisdom as we were reading
[38:23] because man's Wisdom was doing good you
[38:25] can quote the Bible from Genesis to
[38:27] Revelation you had a photographic memory
[38:29] you could just go through it and look at
[38:31] that but that still doesn't mean a thing
[38:33] to you dead and lost as long as you
[38:35] ain't Born Again amen you're sold as
[38:37] black as son if you're not born again
[38:38] even though you could quote Everything
[38:40] Jesus never said right amen and even if
[38:42] you'd walk there with him
[38:44] washed his clothes and and feed him
[38:47] every meal and everything you could have
[38:50] done
[38:51] yeah see and all sounds and wonders
[38:54] could be following you
[38:57] right if the word's not present first
[39:02] then those signs and wonders
[39:05] I'm not saying there are of no value
[39:07] that would be foolish right
[39:09] right because to see anyone delivered
[39:11] any sick healed if the pope wrong lay
[39:14] his hands on somebody and they was
[39:16] raised from the dead I would shout Glory
[39:18] Hallelujah right
[39:20] right I wouldn't agree with this
[39:22] Doctrine but I shout about that God
[39:23] raised the dead because he ain't nobody
[39:25] can heal or deliver or anything but God
[39:28] himself
[39:31] but I see the what I see is wrong with
[39:33] the little church
[39:35] what's out there if anybody listening
[39:37] that's your business
[39:39] what I see is wrong with this church is
[39:41] is we don't put our confidence in what
[39:44] God has given us right amen I didn't say
[39:48] build up the preacher
[39:50] all right okay
[39:54] I've had twice here these people tried
[39:56] to bring me up to try to say that I was
[39:58] a prophet both times I've come to this
[40:00] pulpit and flatly denied that
[40:04] to say no I am not a prophet I do not
[40:07] operate like a prophecy
[40:10] I'm just what I am
[40:12] I talking about honoring me I'm talking
[40:15] about believing what God has said to you
[40:18] and I uh right no matter who it's come
[40:22] from or what it's come from me
[40:25] but to honor that word
[40:28] and give honor and Grace unto it you
[40:31] know give a give praise
[40:33] unto him
[40:37] and say thank you Lord for what you've
[40:39] done moment
[40:40] because that way see that we don't have
[40:42] to worry about getting exalted right
[40:45] you know
[40:46] because an exalted Spirit see won't work
[40:50] that's right other gift may work
[40:53] but it's going to come to its Folly amen
[40:57] but I see that that's what's wrong with
[40:59] you and I
[41:00] if we don't
[41:02] put our confidence right into where
[41:03] we're at
[41:06] I don't mind saying it this way do
[41:09] anybody out there that's listening
[41:12] if you got more signs and wonders than
[41:14] one we can come here and produce the
[41:17] people that were healed and everything
[41:19] even the dead was raised right
[41:22] if you got more than that well praise
[41:24] God all right thank God for him right
[41:27] but what about the word well we don't
[41:30] need that word now we we we're we're in
[41:34] the the we're in the third pool but I
[41:36] thought the third quarter opening the
[41:37] worst right right I didn't know it was
[41:39] anything else all right
[41:41] I thought that's what the prophet said
[41:44] yes but you just put two emphasis of one
[41:46] word word word word word
[41:50] I know to put on is John 1 1. that's
[41:53] right in the beginning was the word word
[41:55] with God the Word was God Amen
[41:58] and verse 14 said and the Word was made
[42:00] flesh and dwell Among Us that's right
[42:01] but see we're not looking at it we're
[42:04] we're I'm talking here and hang out
[42:06] Gardner all right
[42:09] what I see wrong with this church is
[42:11] there's too many people in here that
[42:13] think they know all about what's going
[42:15] on
[42:17] now Shake Yourself
[42:20] clear it up and get an understanding
[42:25] the Holy Ghost is the only one that
[42:26] knows what's going on
[42:28] but you see what people are thinking if
[42:31] it was me up there it would work
[42:33] yeah um
[42:36] I'm not exalted not married I'm truthful
[42:40] come on man women and all
[42:43] one because I want to see God move amen
[42:46] right amen but you know what our trouble
[42:48] is when we start getting those exalted
[42:50] Spirits right
[42:52] the Earth what's killing the spirit of
[42:54] God
[42:58] let's bind them together in one thing
[43:01] because that's what I prayed told you
[43:03] I'm praying for a Revival a Revival not
[43:05] of gifts and signs and wonders but a
[43:08] Revival of Love among a group of people
[43:11] that would surpass all things
[43:14] when your Prophet said one day he said
[43:16] I'd rather see the love among the people
[43:18] than see 5 000 people healed amen I mean
[43:22] I listen I I was in shock
[43:27] but he finished the statement he said
[43:29] because we have love Among Us they'd be
[43:31] ten thousand people healed right man so
[43:35] then he was around
[43:37] would you see our problem is if we don't
[43:39] put the emphasis
[43:41] upon the revealed word
[43:46] now according to my understanding I'll
[43:49] get off this in a second I'm just saying
[43:51] something about what Aaron was was
[43:52] trying to say like one brother though
[43:54] one time I asked the Brother David said
[43:56] did you say that that he said I said no
[44:00] I didn't say that so Aaron he can get
[44:03] his next time he can get up there and
[44:04] say I didn't say that no that'd be all
[44:07] right but I just want a brother said I
[44:10] said no I didn't say that right you know
[44:12] but listen
[44:15] if we don't confess what is Among Us
[44:18] right
[44:19] how can God come Among Us that's right
[44:21] now
[44:27] but you see now everybody puts emphasis
[44:30] up on the
[44:32] the book of Acts
[44:34] the faith of the fathers
[44:37] but to my understanding now
[44:40] if I'm wrong I'm up for correction but
[44:43] make sure you come good with it because
[44:44] I want to know this because I've been
[44:46] studying this for 40 something years
[44:49] faith of the fathers means revelation of
[44:51] the father right right
[44:54] it doesn't mean signs and wonders
[44:57] amen minds and wonders followers
[45:00] revelation of the father
[45:03] you first got to get the revelation of
[45:06] the fathers
[45:07] that's why it's called Faith revelation
[45:09] of the fathers all right that's what
[45:12] people look at they say well we don't
[45:13] see nothing going on well you're blind
[45:16] amen
[45:17] that's right I'm sorry you're blind amen
[45:22] and blindness is what's causing us it's
[45:25] killing us
[45:27] I told you brother asked me that I I
[45:30] believe we was at the faith of the
[45:31] fathers and I'm fatically stated yes I'm
[45:33] going to go stronger tonight
[45:36] everybody listening
[45:43] I believe the headstone's here all right
[45:44] come on come on Amen for those who can
[45:48] receive it amen amen
[45:51] amen yeah but I don't see the signs
[45:53] anyone
[45:56] see you're after signs and wonders right
[45:58] you know what after the words and signs
[46:00] and wonders following the word
[46:03] John's followers them that believe
[46:05] Believers don't follow signs
[46:07] that was brother Harris's favorite
[46:09] saying wouldn't it
[46:11] I 100 agree with it
[46:14] but signs will follow Believers right if
[46:19] we don't confess The Headstone in here
[46:20] it can't come right right
[46:23] is it going to come in some secret way
[46:30] what's it going to be
[46:32] so let's start confessing
[46:34] amen
[46:41] but you see what we do is we talk about
[46:42] what the doctor says
[46:46] and we all go to the doctors
[46:49] well do you ever hear me in the Pulpit
[46:51] okay
[47:01] I come here dying and hurting all over
[47:04] and I'll never tell you
[47:07] I'll never tell my wife how much I hurt
[47:10] why
[47:11] because it'll hinder her
[47:15] it'll hinder her right
[47:18] it won't hip her
[47:20] that's what she said value doing I said
[47:22] doing fine
[47:25] because that's what our confession is
[47:28] supposed to be I thought our confession
[47:30] of healings was dangerous the same as
[47:31] bases that are confession of salvation
[47:35] are you saved today in locks tomorrow
[47:37] say well I'm feeling good but I'm
[47:38] without it my brother Eric on my
[47:40] downlies you don't know I love that
[47:43] because down in The Valleys is where
[47:45] everything grows good that's right
[47:48] yeah
[47:50] you get up on the mountain sure you're
[47:52] going up on a mountain called flood put
[47:53] the soil up there you work flattens off
[47:55] and things you got valleys
[47:58] but you get up on the mountains I've
[47:59] been up there where the trees wouldn't
[48:01] but
[48:02] yeah this hour in the window garage all
[48:05] right that was just in Colorado
[48:11] but listen Church
[48:14] I think it's time to start saying what
[48:15] we are and what we believe we are and
[48:18] where we stand
[48:19] that's right do you think I'm afraid of
[48:21] anybody out there coming and said will
[48:23] it comfortable come on bring the word
[48:25] right and then if you want the signs and
[48:28] wonders to back it up calculate I know
[48:30] I'm aggravated and hurting calculate
[48:33] your church to see how many people have
[48:34] been healed and the Dead's been raised
[48:36] in the city and bring them and let's lay
[48:37] them down side to side right
[48:40] right so you shouldn't be that way why
[48:42] not
[48:43] I'm just sick and tired of Satan pushing
[48:47] you and me around
[48:49] because of our little petty feelings
[48:52] right yeah
[48:56] all right
[48:58] come on because that won't be one thing
[49:01] of our wisdom we're talking about okay
[49:03] that's right I think that's what Aaron
[49:05] was talking about if it wasn't even
[49:06] Straighten It Up
[49:09] I just want to see us folks move on
[49:11] right
[49:13] now it's just like I said over and over
[49:17] you don't pray for rain in a monsoon
[49:20] season huh that's right we don't need a
[49:23] manifested son of God
[49:25] or a daughter of God when it's raining
[49:27] like crazy To Pray For Rain right you
[49:30] might want one to pray for it to stop
[49:31] yeah
[49:34] but if there's no sick among us how can
[49:36] God manifest itself
[49:38] um
[49:38] all right sure
[49:42] well if we had what we think we have
[49:44] well go show me somewhere else that's
[49:47] got anything all right amen
[49:51] you know what I'm saying I've tried to
[49:54] explain it of course everybody thinks
[49:55] I'm trying to justify you take the
[49:57] people in the book of Acts and you put
[49:59] them right down here today
[50:01] right
[50:02] and let's see what they produce
[50:05] I don't mind talking that away I don't
[50:07] think God is mad at me for that right
[50:10] because you take some time and you
[50:12] calculate
[50:13] how many healings is in the book of Acts
[50:18] I challenge you on this point sit down
[50:20] sometime and read the book of Acts and
[50:21] write down every healing that took place
[50:28] and then come and let's sit down talk
[50:30] about how many has happened here
[50:33] that's right
[50:35] no wonder brother Randall said he said
[50:37] I've seen more miracles right in one
[50:42] service right
[50:44] he said then there's even all of the
[50:48] Ministry of Jesus right
[50:53] yep
[50:54] now did he have any problems saying that
[50:59] but you see all of that goes into wisdom
[51:03] girl that's what I want us to get to
[51:06] because there's a wisdom that is so
[51:09] close the Holy Ghost wisdom right until
[51:11] the Earth where our problem is that's
[51:13] correct
[51:14] amen
[51:16] now if you don't catch that out of the
[51:18] message you you just go ahead and listen
[51:19] to it over and over
[51:22] there is a wisdom that comes in there so
[51:24] close yep that's right until there's
[51:27] only one thing above it and that's holy
[51:29] ghost from revelation
[51:31] or wisdom right
[51:35] and wisdom according to the Bible I'll
[51:38] go ahead and say it and then I'll prove
[51:39] it
[51:40] wisdom according to the Bible is a
[51:42] person
[51:43] that's right
[51:46] I'm done by Holy Ghost wisdom right
[51:48] right amen not the wisdom of man all
[51:51] right
[51:53] it's a person
[51:57] Reverend said if you read the Bible and
[51:59] don't see Christ in every verse what'd
[52:01] he say all right
[52:04] he said go back and read it again
[52:05] because you missed it right that's right
[52:08] wisdom is a person
[52:11] wisdom is just as old as God is
[52:15] that's right
[52:16] because he was with God
[52:19] when he created all kinds
[52:21] of that ring a bell John 1 1 again Amen
[52:24] in the beginning was the word word with
[52:26] God the Word was God is that enough to
[52:28] open your eyes and then we'll go back
[52:30] and prove it
[52:33] and read the scripture and see what it
[52:35] is
[52:37] Holy Ghost wisdom not man's Wisdom right
[52:39] amen amen
[52:42] okay go ahead now
[52:44] let's see
[52:46] I'm gonna check out and see where I
[52:47] start at
[52:49] you know
[52:52] my book number one brother we'll get
[52:53] started
[52:57] so we're gonna have a lot of scripture
[52:58] tonight we don't go through the
[52:59] scripture we're just going to go one to
[53:01] the other one or the other in the
[53:02] scripture
[53:03] all right now going down to uh
[53:07] then to Ephesians 3.
[53:10] go on to the next one there you go
[53:13] now look what Paul says about wisdom
[53:19] to make all men is what he wanted to do
[53:23] to see
[53:25] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[53:28] I remember
[53:30] what we read yep
[53:32] in Corinthians
[53:35] the mystery of wisdom right
[53:38] wisdom is a mystery
[53:41] so now look what Paul's saying The
[53:43] Fellowship of the mystery
[53:44] which from the beginning of the world
[53:46] have been hidden God who created All
[53:48] Things by Jesus Christ
[53:51] to the intent
[53:53] that now unto the pitch of power peace
[53:57] and Powers
[53:59] in Heavenly places
[54:02] might be might be known by the church
[54:07] the what now
[54:09] the manifold wisdom
[54:12] of God
[54:17] we're in the end time folks we're
[54:19] supposed to be the end of all things
[54:21] right
[54:25] we're supposed to be winding it
[54:29] off and we're supposed to be having some
[54:31] form of understanding in this day
[54:33] of all powers and heavens and everything
[54:35] that principle anything
[54:41] to make known to a bride of Jesus Christ
[54:44] the manifold wisdom
[54:47] of God
[54:49] not man's Wisdom
[54:52] second Corinthians 3 and this is not on
[54:55] that one I just read it brother you know
[54:57] I got a lot down to quote
[55:00] II Corinthians 3 19 to First Corinthians
[55:02] 3 19 says the wisdom of this world is
[55:05] foolishness right with God
[55:09] so we're certainly not talking about
[55:10] wisdom of man
[55:13] how much intelligence we can receive
[55:16] how much we can know of the message
[55:19] that's it amen I heard the Bible see
[55:25] First Corinthians 1 22 says
[55:28] the Jews require a sign
[55:32] the Greeks seek wisdom right all right
[55:40] Greek seek after wisdom Proverbs 2 and 6
[55:43] says for the lord giveth wisdom
[55:49] out of his mouth come at knowledge
[55:52] and understanding amen
[55:55] amen I want you to notice that because
[55:58] we're going to get out in a minute and
[56:00] you'll see what I'm talking about it
[56:03] God didn't say nutless
[56:06] God didn't say the lord giveth knowledge
[56:09] and understanding
[56:15] we know he does
[56:17] but get the point
[56:22] where the lord giveth wisdom
[56:29] then he says out of his mouth
[56:33] cometh knowledge and understanding
[56:37] which one do you want
[56:40] you want knowledge understanding or
[56:42] wisdom
[56:46] that's right
[56:49] look how important God considers wisdom
[56:52] to be
[56:57] who had number three brother
[57:02] First Corinthians 12 8.
[57:06] Market 1 is given to Spirit given by the
[57:10] spirit right the word of wisdom
[57:14] to another the word of knowledge
[57:17] by The Same Spirit and which comes first
[57:23] which do you want
[57:26] you want knowledge
[57:28] you want understanding as we quoted from
[57:31] proverbs
[57:34] or do you want wisdom first
[57:39] right
[57:40] number four
[57:43] take them from the message God keeps his
[57:46] word
[57:48] 1957 four or seven in the morning
[57:50] service look at here
[57:53] the first gift and allowed gifts is
[57:55] wisdom that's right absolutely amen
[57:59] the second is knowledge
[58:03] y'all watch it
[58:05] and if you don't have any wisdom how do
[58:08] you know what to do with knowledge right
[58:11] amen amen amen come on
[58:14] seek the best things first is that what
[58:17] the scripture is interested in wisdom
[58:22] and if you hadn't got wisdom what can
[58:25] you do with knowledge
[58:28] right I'm speaking with Jones right are
[58:31] these other things it takes wisdom it
[58:33] takes God's wisdom Solomon said
[58:37] call it your mother now I searched for
[58:39] an hour this morning I never did find
[58:40] out what are you leaning on me I
[58:42] couldn't find it so if you do let me
[58:44] know you're right but what did they do
[58:46] the Pentecostal received speaking in
[58:47] tongues and they made a denomination out
[58:49] of it and they wanted this sure they did
[58:51] and a mixed multitude went with them so
[58:53] what did they get first what comes first
[58:56] to mankind right that's what he wants
[58:58] his knowledge which is most not supposed
[59:00] to be first right nope
[59:04] wisdom is supposed to be first amen
[59:09] all right now remember that as we go
[59:11] through and don't forget it
[59:13] place I don't say it about five times
[59:16] the prophet says what would you do with
[59:20] your knowledge right
[59:26] if you don't have any wisdom all right
[59:28] right
[59:32] oh I just want to understand just tell
[59:34] me about nothing I've told you before
[59:36] God's told me a lot of things I could do
[59:37] and give me the opportunity to do what I
[59:40] wanted to and I ain't done it yet
[59:46] one of them is quitting
[59:52] maybe yeah
[59:55] but it's all right
[59:59] but you see
[1:00:01] we want knowledge
[1:00:03] we want understanding
[1:00:07] have you ever heard a preacher get up
[1:00:08] and say now what I'm going to tell you
[1:00:10] today I don't believe is the Lord
[1:00:16] never heard that
[1:00:18] no they always say the Lord told me
[1:00:23] Lord told me to come tell you
[1:00:29] is it the Lord
[1:00:34] so wisdom must come first right right
[1:00:37] now I hope you'll start getting the idea
[1:00:39] of what I said
[1:00:41] wisdom is a person right understanding
[1:00:44] and knowledge comes from that person all
[1:00:46] right
[1:00:52] wisdom was with God before the world
[1:00:54] right amen amen
[1:00:58] understanding and knowledge
[1:01:01] comes to human terminologies upon Earth
[1:01:04] in you and I right
[1:01:06] we must have understanding we must have
[1:01:08] knowledge come on yeah that's right but
[1:01:11] it must be first what
[1:01:13] right now according to my Bible
[1:01:16] and the prophet I fall after I've
[1:01:19] changed today to testify to the
[1:01:22] chiropractor
[1:01:24] you just said something we got to
[1:01:26] talking about tapes and things and he
[1:01:28] said what dates you listen to oh that
[1:01:30] opened it up
[1:01:32] I hope it was listed
[1:01:36] I sure don't want it just be knowledge
[1:01:38] because he can run people off on that
[1:01:40] but
[1:01:40] I've done the best I could do in about a
[1:01:42] five minute run through and I left
[1:01:43] office by saying
[1:01:45] you know according to the Bible Malachi
[1:01:48] 4. the money's got to turn the hearts of
[1:01:50] the children back to the face of the
[1:01:52] Fathers as if they don't it won't be no
[1:01:54] Rapture right
[1:01:56] and I said Rapture is not an automatic
[1:01:57] processor right right not just because
[1:02:01] of bus pools that's right you're right
[1:02:04] I said Rapture is a revelation right
[1:02:08] yep
[1:02:09] yes sir he's not stupid
[1:02:14] I hope it was
[1:02:16] wisdom
[1:02:18] but now think about it
[1:02:22] what good is your gift
[1:02:25] did the prophet say that
[1:02:27] did he say the gifts without the virtues
[1:02:29] is what
[1:02:31] they didn't say they was wrong and bad
[1:02:33] and we didn't need them did he
[1:02:35] come on what did he say
[1:02:38] he said the gifts without the virtues is
[1:02:40] a stumbling block that's right
[1:02:43] that's right yep
[1:02:45] not against guilts he wanted gifts
[1:02:49] but it becomes a stumbling block because
[1:02:51] you allow those gifts
[1:02:53] to get in your way right that's right
[1:02:55] yeah
[1:02:59] brother was up one nothing
[1:03:01] Church went out years ago and
[1:03:03] he was talking like you know that he had
[1:03:05] discernment
[1:03:08] when he finished I went up shook his
[1:03:10] hand I said brother
[1:03:11] I said enjoyed your message only one
[1:03:15] point I want to make
[1:03:17] if you discern me out with something
[1:03:19] just keep Discerning until you find out
[1:03:21] what's behind it
[1:03:25] I said because it's God behind it all in
[1:03:27] between there to be taken care of
[1:03:30] all right
[1:03:32] so if you discern me out to find me a
[1:03:35] bad egg you know
[1:03:36] there's a sister in India you know
[1:03:40] old man
[1:03:44] just run it on back till I see you see
[1:03:46] what I'm talking about
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:49] and then that way you know you'll get
[1:03:51] rid of all of that in between
[1:03:53] but now look
[1:03:56] if you don't have wisdom how do you know
[1:03:58] what to do with your knowledge all right
[1:04:02] said on number five look what he said
[1:04:05] these are the only quotes I'm giving to
[1:04:06] the prophet and I've got one more
[1:04:07] student name
[1:04:11] Mayra 67 a name of 70 week the 70th week
[1:04:14] of Daniel Daniel
[1:04:16] the spirit of wisdom comes into the
[1:04:19] church
[1:04:21] I notice the inside the spirit of
[1:04:24] knowledge or understand it
[1:04:28] in Daniel what does it say Daniel I've
[1:04:32] come to give you understanding
[1:04:35] all right
[1:04:37] but watch him here now the spirit of
[1:04:39] wisdom comes into the church to make
[1:04:41] known to the church by the revelation of
[1:04:43] the Holy Ghost bringing the church in
[1:04:46] and revealing what day that we're living
[1:04:50] in
[1:04:51] just the same as Gabriel come to to
[1:04:55] Daniel all right the Holy Spirit comes
[1:04:57] to the church in the last days to reveal
[1:05:00] these great deep secret things do you
[1:05:03] understand
[1:05:04] but we don't need
[1:05:07] things
[1:05:14] I told him in the Bible study the other
[1:05:16] night
[1:05:18] people think Daniel said you wish is
[1:05:19] confusing yeah
[1:05:21] give me about an hour we just talk about
[1:05:23] what the prophet said about the baptism
[1:05:26] of the Holy Ghost and the new birth
[1:05:28] and if you don't housing you birth
[1:05:30] you'll come out of there confused it's
[1:05:32] all you know that's right
[1:05:36] I'm trying
[1:05:37] everything is confusing
[1:05:40] until it's revealed
[1:05:43] right
[1:05:44] amen I don't care what it is or how
[1:05:47] simple it is
[1:05:49] man
[1:05:51] probably said you don't need a
[1:05:53] revelation to realize what a baptism in
[1:05:55] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:05:57] agree amen true
[1:05:59] but you need understanding to be able to
[1:06:01] read
[1:06:07] now come on then
[1:06:09] the Holy Ghost comes to the church to
[1:06:12] make known to the church by the
[1:06:14] revelation of Jesus Christ bringing us
[1:06:16] to the place but in wisdom
[1:06:19] welcome man
[1:06:21] not just his knowledge
[1:06:23] knowledge perfect
[1:06:25] right right
[1:06:29] is that scripture amen
[1:06:33] all right now
[1:06:36] we're going to take a lot of scripture
[1:06:40] go ahead with number six
[1:06:42] you see automatically
[1:06:44] just the second chronicles 1 12
[1:06:47] 8-12 it just disappeared
[1:06:51] Miss back
[1:06:53] all right you see that it's Solomon
[1:06:56] now everybody knows the story of Solomon
[1:06:59] right
[1:07:00] what was the thing Solomon desired
[1:07:04] understanding and knowledge no
[1:07:09] no
[1:07:10] you knew a little more about that than
[1:07:13] we think he did
[1:07:16] understanding and knowledge would be
[1:07:18] great of how to rule I mean how to do
[1:07:21] and fight a war and
[1:07:25] look what he says amen give me now
[1:07:29] wisdom
[1:07:30] and knowledge amen
[1:07:33] wisdom first
[1:07:36] what did I may go out and come in before
[1:07:38] this people
[1:07:39] well who can judge this thy people that
[1:07:43] is so great that's right
[1:07:45] and God said to Solomon because this was
[1:07:48] in thine heart
[1:07:51] and thou has asked not riches wealth or
[1:07:54] honor
[1:07:55] nor the life of thine enemies
[1:07:58] neither yet has asked long life
[1:08:04] laughs
[1:08:06] but if that's wisdom yeah and knowledge
[1:08:10] but I say off but I must judge my people
[1:08:13] over whom I have made the king
[1:08:18] now watch what God Said Amen
[1:08:22] thank you what did God say
[1:08:27] wisdom and knowledge he didn't say
[1:08:30] knowledge
[1:08:32] amen wisdom and knowledge is granted
[1:08:36] unto thee
[1:08:38] and I will give thee riches
[1:08:41] and wealth and honor such as none of the
[1:08:45] Kings I've had that have been before
[1:08:47] thee neither shall bear any after they
[1:08:50] have the life amen
[1:08:53] my seeking wisdom
[1:09:00] that should be writing any man's heart
[1:09:02] that if he's serving God
[1:09:05] to want knowledge and understanding of
[1:09:07] how to do things
[1:09:12] I mean I'm a bachelor of church I I want
[1:09:14] understanding and knowledge from God how
[1:09:16] to do things that's right
[1:09:18] you know what to do in case of this that
[1:09:21] or the other
[1:09:26] what you see
[1:09:29] are we seeking wisdom are we seeking
[1:09:31] understanding and knowledge which we are
[1:09:39] because see there's knowledge of the
[1:09:40] Lord the Bible called the dead knowledge
[1:09:42] of the Lord right
[1:09:44] but wisdom
[1:09:48] and knowledge was granted
[1:09:51] under Solomon
[1:09:56] do you remember that
[1:09:58] there was a little Queen came to see
[1:10:01] Solomon right
[1:10:05] she came for about three months just to
[1:10:08] get over there to see because you'd
[1:10:09] heard about all of the great things that
[1:10:11] was taking place and how that God was
[1:10:12] with Israel through Solomon
[1:10:16] you know the Bible says that not one
[1:10:19] thing was withholding that's right from
[1:10:21] her
[1:10:22] that she
[1:10:24] desired to understand
[1:10:28] was that knowledge
[1:10:31] with that understanding oh yeah okay you
[1:10:34] you want to know how to run your kingdom
[1:10:36] you go out here and you take so many men
[1:10:37] you put them over here
[1:10:38] that's all knowledge
[1:10:41] she saw the wisdom
[1:10:45] that could only come from God
[1:10:52] wisdom
[1:10:54] she knew Solomon couldn't tell her her
[1:10:57] thoughts
[1:11:02] nothing was withholding from
[1:11:04] go look up how many times right around
[1:11:07] emphasizes that see he showed her the
[1:11:09] very secrets of her heart yep
[1:11:13] she knew that God was with him
[1:11:17] because she sat down right there with a
[1:11:19] man yep
[1:11:24] Solomon want understanding and knowledge
[1:11:27] how to rule no
[1:11:29] he said Lord give me wisdom
[1:11:33] in other words
[1:11:36] Lord
[1:11:38] come down and live
[1:11:41] and live amen right was that what he
[1:11:43] wanted amen right come down and be so
[1:11:46] present until
[1:11:48] and it was amazing to remember when the
[1:11:50] the two women that one of the babies the
[1:11:52] women too had two babies remembering one
[1:11:54] of the babies that died and and the the
[1:11:57] they got into an argument about who did
[1:11:59] it belong to and
[1:12:00] I said okay we'll go to Solomon
[1:12:04] and the wisdom of Solomon what did he do
[1:12:08] they both said yeah that's mine that's
[1:12:10] mine
[1:12:13] Solomon said let's solve the problem
[1:12:16] we'll just give each one of you half of
[1:12:18] it
[1:12:19] you get the sword
[1:12:22] we'll divide it
[1:12:25] the real mother screamed out no don't
[1:12:27] kill my child I'll give it to her he
[1:12:30] said you're the mother taking another
[1:12:32] one out of here
[1:12:35] we've done anybody
[1:12:39] to lead his people
[1:12:43] you have many men that were of great
[1:12:45] knowledge
[1:12:47] but he wanted wisdom right
[1:12:50] what do we want
[1:12:54] right
[1:12:56] I've had people to say to me say brother
[1:12:58] Dave I'd love to have the knowledge you
[1:12:59] have as a message well you know what if
[1:13:01] you'd have stayed out of Walmart
[1:13:04] this is a good old saying here in
[1:13:06] America overseas in case you don't
[1:13:08] understand that just simply means you're
[1:13:10] passion you foolish time away down at
[1:13:11] Walmart shopping
[1:13:13] it's all over the country now getting in
[1:13:14] your countries so you'll find out what
[1:13:17] it is to go to Walmart
[1:13:19] you can find anything you want yeah
[1:13:26] see I dedicated my life when I come into
[1:13:28] the message
[1:13:31] to try to have understanding right
[1:13:34] you listening right I wanted knowledge
[1:13:42] I was trained how to use my knowledge
[1:13:46] to crack you with words
[1:13:54] but then one day
[1:13:56] I saw I didn't need knowledge
[1:13:59] understanding right
[1:14:01] I needed wisdom all right
[1:14:05] and you know what I saw it after until I
[1:14:07] found it
[1:14:09] amen all right sure
[1:14:16] because I found the person right
[1:14:21] go to number seven
[1:14:25] we're gonna get on number nine we're
[1:14:26] just gonna read a whole new chapter
[1:14:30] all right
[1:14:32] look what it says the fear of the Lord
[1:14:34] is the beginning of knowledge
[1:14:38] and watch
[1:14:40] but fools
[1:14:42] despise
[1:14:44] wisdom and instruction yep amen
[1:14:48] Why didn't it say there that fools
[1:14:50] decide despise knowledge
[1:14:57] because it wouldn't be correct
[1:14:59] everybody wants knowledge
[1:15:01] right we're building knowledge right
[1:15:04] yep
[1:15:06] you want to walk home tonight
[1:15:08] no now they put you in automobile where
[1:15:10] you can get it and drive home right
[1:15:13] right
[1:15:15] the world is built on knowledge
[1:15:18] that's why the world hates wisdom
[1:15:22] I get it right
[1:15:25] you said but wisdom is this knowledge
[1:15:28] well why did the fool hate it then
[1:15:33] but that's all he's built on this
[1:15:35] knowledge
[1:15:37] you build on understanding
[1:15:44] now they can blow the world apart and
[1:15:46] eat any given time
[1:15:49] never been before right
[1:15:54] because of their knowledge
[1:15:57] but they hate wisdom
[1:16:04] I hate you
[1:16:11] see where I've got a couple of year on
[1:16:13] the quote
[1:16:14] I'm fine
[1:16:21] Ecclesiastes 9 and 16. now this is a
[1:16:23] quotient all right
[1:16:26] says wisdom is better than strength
[1:16:30] sure
[1:16:35] I believe in that story if not in there
[1:16:37] I'm interested in there one or two you
[1:16:39] remember where the man came up the young
[1:16:41] young guy did and told him how they
[1:16:42] could win the war
[1:16:43] you remember that in the Bible if it's
[1:16:45] not that right it's just somewhere and
[1:16:47] he told them how to win the war
[1:16:49] you know what they won the war
[1:16:52] but they forgot who gave them the
[1:16:54] understanding
[1:16:58] instead of getting praised for the the
[1:17:01] ACT they were just praising each other
[1:17:06] Ecclesiastes 9 and 18 says wisdom is
[1:17:09] better than weapons of war
[1:17:14] I remember a town in the Bible when they
[1:17:16] built a city
[1:17:20] that you could run chariot races
[1:17:25] on the top of that concrete built or
[1:17:27] whatever you want to call it in that day
[1:17:30] building that was around you know the
[1:17:32] wall but
[1:17:33] chariot races I mean if you had one
[1:17:36] horse and a buggy
[1:17:38] one horse and a bug he would cover at
[1:17:40] least five or seven feet
[1:17:44] and they didn't exactly have horses and
[1:17:46] Buggies you know but if you put two
[1:17:47] buggies around
[1:17:48] running around you'd have to have 15
[1:17:51] feet or more
[1:17:54] bad chariot races
[1:17:57] around the wall on the taco
[1:18:01] mm-hmm
[1:18:03] hours
[1:18:05] I mean how would you know Joshua going
[1:18:08] to get in there all right
[1:18:11] the gates was iron and
[1:18:14] you know right
[1:18:16] tons of times and couldn't break through
[1:18:18] wow all right
[1:18:22] he didn't pray for understanding of how
[1:18:25] to defeat the army
[1:18:31] God just dropped down and said
[1:18:33] this is the way you do it
[1:18:36] walk around there one time he studied
[1:18:38] come on back and settle down just worry
[1:18:41] them a little bit
[1:18:42] you know make them all upset
[1:18:45] do you know day one and went around and
[1:18:47] that's all the person are they gonna try
[1:18:49] to come up now well yeah I don't know
[1:18:51] I'm kind of a little afraid
[1:18:53] well day two day three day four and then
[1:18:56] it's up on the top of the rock Sam
[1:19:03] the wisdomen yep told him to go around
[1:19:07] it seven times that last day turn around
[1:19:10] and face the wall
[1:19:12] and they blow the trumpet
[1:19:14] and everybody shouted
[1:19:18] and the wall went straight
[1:19:21] not crumbled
[1:19:23] Earth just opened up right make you just
[1:19:26] see that guy on the inside boy I think
[1:19:28] let me go fight him let me ask our
[1:19:29] fighting Israelites and about that time
[1:19:31] the wall goes and he's standing there
[1:19:33] that's it
[1:19:35] I'm on your side all right let's go
[1:19:39] all right you being silly I'm just being
[1:19:40] truthful
[1:19:44] you see wisdom
[1:19:46] told them how to go down
[1:19:49] you get all the stories in the Bible so
[1:19:51] you could go from one to one to one to
[1:19:53] one
[1:19:54] we'll stay all night but I want to get
[1:19:56] down in these scriptures
[1:19:58] all right

[1:20:44] no let's see if you go along with that
[1:20:46] one he went along that wisdom goes
[1:20:48] before knowledge and that was always the
[1:20:50] number one gift was wisdom and then the
[1:20:52] neck was knowledge now how about you
[1:20:53] going along that
[1:20:55] you gonna follow that scripture
[1:20:59] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:21:03] and revelation
[1:21:06] now according to my Bible in the prophet
[1:21:08] that I follow
[1:21:10] no man can call Jesus a Christ except
[1:21:13] what
[1:21:15] by the Holy Ghost
[1:21:18] by the new birth
[1:21:20] not by letters from your mouth
[1:21:23] right amen

[1:22:23] I'm sure it probably is
[1:22:28] and you're gonna find out if this wisdom
[1:22:30] was before the world
[1:22:32] all right
[1:22:34] all right sure you got a Scofield bible
[1:22:36] turn down to the bottom of the page
[1:22:39] there and see that even Scofield
[1:22:44] I don't agree with his statements but
[1:22:46] yet still he knew by looking at it from
[1:22:49] an intellectual point
[1:22:52] that that wisdom had to be greater than
[1:22:54] even he said than a personification I
[1:22:56] don't agree with Eric I believe it is
[1:22:59] he said it was the Eternal Son of God
[1:23:07] right sure
[1:23:12] but we look at it as wisdom
[1:23:16] you ever read the Bible like that and
[1:23:18] look at something you know you're
[1:23:20] reading down through there they're not
[1:23:21] with some crying understanding go for it
[1:23:23] she stands in the top of the high places
[1:23:25] right away you know right keep Crossing
[1:23:27] it again you know what you're talking

[1:24:12] I hope I don't have to point at one of
[1:24:14] them

[1:24:47] keep standing in the top of the high
[1:24:49] places

[1:24:53] each verse like a preachers all right an
[1:24:55] hour off the verse it said

[1:27:15] that's what the Bible said amen
[1:27:20] it says they're playing wisdom is
[1:27:22] playing
[1:27:23] to him that understand it
[1:27:25] and write to them that find knowledge
[1:27:29] wisdom is going to lead you tonight
[1:27:31] now watch what he says watch what wisdom
[1:27:34] said receive my instructions
[1:27:37] and not silver
[1:27:40] and knowledge rather than Choice gold
[1:27:45] for wisdom is better than rubies
[1:27:48] and all the things that may be desired
[1:27:50] are not to be compared to it
[1:27:53] isn't that wonderful
[1:27:55] playing that song about the gold the

[1:30:48] did Solomon get substance
[1:30:50] right
[1:30:52] Riches of all the kings man because he
[1:30:55] wanted wisdom to lead the people
[1:30:58] and I will feel their Treasures
[1:31:02] I don't care about all that stuff
[1:31:05] when he had a problem when they had us
[1:31:06] don't caring about it
[1:31:08] you say you just give it all away I
[1:31:10] tried to a lot of times
[1:31:11] you know help do but
[1:31:19] where are we at the Lord possessed me in
[1:31:23] the beginning
[1:31:24] of his way
[1:31:28] before his works of old
[1:31:32] now
[1:31:35] sure ain't no head knowledge isn't it
[1:31:37] that's right
[1:31:39] I thought we believe John 1 1 said in
[1:31:41] the beginning was the word the rift God
[1:31:43] in the Word was God
[1:31:45] and didn't believe that was a trinity
[1:31:48] right we didn't believe it was God With
[1:31:50] God you know
[1:31:54] in the beginning was the word
[1:31:57] translated like the prophet of God did
[1:31:59] in the beginning was Elohim Elohim was
[1:32:01] with Elohim and Elohim was Elohim that's
[1:32:05] the way he does it on
[1:32:07] the
[1:32:08] I'm getting a minute not the Mighty God
[1:32:16] the Lord possessed me in the beginning
[1:32:19] of his ways that's you get in there and
[1:32:21] you'll find hours where Schofield says
[1:32:23] this is not
[1:32:24] yes just out
[1:32:29] he says it's greater than even a
[1:32:31] personification yeah
[1:32:34] I don't understand all these thoughts
[1:32:36] but I don't know what he finally winds
[1:32:37] up saying
[1:32:39] thank you
[1:32:42] all right but is a distinct
[1:32:44] abdibration a
[1:32:47] d-u-m-b-r-a-t-i-o-n abdibration of
[1:32:50] Christ
[1:32:52] which means a overshadowing
[1:32:55] or means a representation yep
[1:32:59] a representation of Christ all right so
[1:33:01] if you don't see Christ in every verse
[1:33:04] read it again
[1:33:05] Christ is this wisdom I'm talking about
[1:33:08] that's right
[1:33:10] this person I'm talking about amen
[1:33:14] the Lord possessed me in the beginning
[1:33:15] of his way before his work to move I was
[1:33:18] set up from Everlasting from the
[1:33:20] beginning or ever the Earth was with our
[1:33:24] no depths I was brought forth amen when
[1:33:27] there were no foundations of bounding
[1:33:29] with water she performed before the
[1:33:32] mountains were settled before the hills
[1:33:34] was I brought forth
[1:33:37] as long as yet he had not made the Earth
[1:33:40] not to see yours not the highest part of
[1:33:43] the Dust of the world
[1:33:45] he's already there
[1:33:48] amen
[1:33:49] wisdom was already there amen
[1:33:53] amen when he prepared the heavens I was
[1:33:56] there
[1:33:58] the prophet said what out from God went
[1:34:01] alone gosh speech and began to say Let
[1:34:04] There Be he said not another God said
[1:34:07] but God in another form called a word
[1:34:12] are you listening
[1:34:17] when he prepared the heavens I was there
[1:34:18] when he said accomplish upon the face of
[1:34:21] the Dead you know to keep the all the
[1:34:23] different things happen when he
[1:34:25] established the clouds above when he
[1:34:27] strengthened the strengthened The
[1:34:28] Fountains of the deep
[1:34:30] when he gave to the Sea his decree that
[1:34:33] the water should not pass his
[1:34:35] commandment
[1:34:36] when he appointed the foundations of the
[1:34:39] Earth
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:43] then I always by him
[1:34:47] as one brought up with him
[1:34:51] and I was daily his Delight amen
[1:34:54] rejoicing always
[1:34:57] before him
[1:34:59] little brother said
[1:35:01] when that went out to create
[1:35:03] how great could a seventh grade
[1:35:05] education man explain but he explained
[1:35:07] it with a man that had wisdom the
[1:35:09] theologians couldn't figure it out
[1:35:11] that's right he set out from God towards
[1:35:13] a Halo and they couldn't argue from that
[1:35:15] because they knew that right you
[1:35:17] theologians get your Bible Scofield and
[1:35:19] then says the first thing that went out
[1:35:21] from God was the word of God which was
[1:35:23] the son of God
[1:35:27] those theologians knew that
[1:35:31] but then they turned it into a trinity
[1:35:34] listen then I was by him as one brought
[1:35:37] it with him and I was David here Delight
[1:35:39] rejoicing always before him
[1:35:42] rejoicing in the
[1:35:44] Hospital
[1:35:48] part of his Earth amen and my Delights
[1:35:51] were with the sons of me amen
[1:35:53] now therefore hearken unto me all you
[1:35:56] children for blessed are they that keep
[1:35:59] my ways
[1:36:01] and ways of wisdom
[1:36:03] your instructions
[1:36:05] and be wise and refuse it not
[1:36:11] blessed is a man that Hearth me
[1:36:15] watching daily at my Gates
[1:36:18] waiting at the post of my daughters
[1:36:23] but whosoever findeth
[1:36:25] me
[1:36:27] kind of life
[1:36:29] and show obtain favor
[1:36:31] oh Lord amen
[1:36:34] but he that Sinners against me wrong
[1:36:36] with his own soul
[1:36:40] all day that hate me
[1:36:43] love death amen I could have put that
[1:36:46] right into Fort Seal from where we ended
[1:36:48] up if I don't want it to but I chose not
[1:36:50] to
[1:36:52] he chose to just take the scriptures and
[1:36:54] let's talk about wisdom
[1:36:57] let's not talk about knowledge and
[1:36:58] understanding let's talk about wisdom
[1:37:01] let's get wisdom the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:04] Ghost the New Birth the person of God
[1:37:05] himself living inside of us in the new
[1:37:08] birth
[1:37:09] that was with God before the world that
[1:37:11] was God himself
[1:37:12] I still haven't preached all I know know
[1:37:14] that God revealed me about himself I'm
[1:37:17] just waiting I've got something
[1:37:19] you don't worry about it I've told you
[1:37:21] that before it didn't come out and
[1:37:22] preach on me
[1:37:24] because see I can look back there and
[1:37:26] it's just plain as language and see
[1:37:30] that that one that went out from God
[1:37:31] couldn't become the Son of God Amen
[1:37:36] not God the son right no such thing in
[1:37:39] the Bible amen
[1:37:41] right right that's why I don't get
[1:37:44] caught with all these two Souls Two
[1:37:46] Lords River Jordans and stuff that Jesus
[1:37:49] wouldn't god Till The River Jordan when
[1:37:51] my Bible said he was born to Emmanuel
[1:37:55] that's why I don't get caught with all
[1:37:56] that stuff
[1:37:57] why
[1:37:59] because I'm looking at the author
[1:38:01] I'm reading his word just like reading
[1:38:04] that in Psalms
[1:38:07] marking it
[1:38:12] that's where I've read my brother call
[1:38:14] me soon
[1:38:16] all that underlined to preach also one
[1:38:18] of these days
[1:38:21] didn't even have to write a note for
[1:38:22] this message
[1:38:27] but see wisdom as a person
[1:38:29] amen amen it's just not understanding
[1:38:33] you get a revelation of a person
[1:38:36] in that Revelation and you can become
[1:38:38] one now you've got wisdom you don't just
[1:38:40] have a revelation you've got wisdom
[1:38:42] you're following me
[1:38:45] when that Revelation becomes personal
[1:38:47] not just a healing Revelation not just
[1:38:50] some way or some part Revelation but
[1:38:53] complete perfect revelation
[1:38:56] turned out to be wisdom
[1:39:01] you see that's why I can say
[1:39:04] I believe the headstones here right amen
[1:39:07] I believe the word has been planted in
[1:39:09] the field
[1:39:11] that now the rain can fall
[1:39:14] and I see no promise in this last days
[1:39:17] contrary to most everybody in the
[1:39:18] message that's looking at it I see no
[1:39:20] promise except the one thing
[1:39:23] the prophet of God said when that door
[1:39:25] closes one day God will anoint a church
[1:39:27] and you'll see in one year what
[1:39:29] theologists is trying to do watch him
[1:39:32] but saying he's doing it now
[1:39:35] yeah that's right he's not failing he's
[1:39:37] not just playing around he's crying you
[1:39:40] and I to see if we want knowledge
[1:39:43] understanding or do we want wisdom
[1:39:49] do we want an understanding of a person
[1:39:51] or the person living within us right
[1:39:55] that's right which do we desire
[1:40:02] we want head knowledge for Holy Ghost
[1:40:05] knowledge
[1:40:08] all right holy ghost knowledge will
[1:40:10] never be contrary to the word amen
[1:40:12] that's what everybody's saying well
[1:40:14] brother Branham you know when we hear in
[1:40:16] any career now you're correcting yep
[1:40:21] you're saying he was wrong
[1:40:24] when he didn't say he was wrong
[1:40:26] if he says he's wrong he told us he is
[1:40:29] wrong that's right
[1:40:31] amen I'm done riddle I remember that
[1:40:34] statement years ago never forgot he said
[1:40:37] anybody will one-eyed and highest since
[1:40:39] I know you just put that down one night
[1:40:41] in half sentence what a no
[1:40:45] if this was a prophet
[1:40:49] nobody corrects a prophet God himself
[1:40:52] amen
[1:40:54] he stands before no man he stands before
[1:40:58] wisdom yep that's right which is the
[1:41:01] person of God Amen
[1:41:04] wisdom is a very part of God
[1:41:10] and you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:12] Ghost in your heart
[1:41:13] it's a part of God
[1:41:15] not God in a part I didn't say that
[1:41:18] it's part of God
[1:41:22] he's the only one that could divide
[1:41:23] himself among seven billion people in
[1:41:25] the world today and give everybody in
[1:41:27] the world a new birth and would have no
[1:41:28] less Holy Ghost than what he did when he
[1:41:30] started that's right
[1:41:33] because he's God
[1:41:37] wisdom
[1:41:40] might encourage you to read the Bible a
[1:41:42] little more plainer
[1:41:45] you know Michael Prophet saying wisdom
[1:41:48] was the first
[1:41:49] because what would you do with your
[1:41:51] knowledge if you didn't have wisdom
[1:41:54] you would destroy it
[1:41:59] instead of help
[1:42:03] wisdom
[1:42:05] is that new birth
[1:42:07] that one that talks to you and tells you
[1:42:09] and leads you that one that heals you
[1:42:12] and saves you
[1:42:17] Solomon knew what wisdom was
[1:42:21] we talk about David and those men like
[1:42:23] that I believe Solomon was speaking in
[1:42:26] the first person don't you
[1:42:29] Man David will say David said they
[1:42:31] pierced my hands enough to eat and Etc
[1:42:33] you know right we say oh he was speaking
[1:42:35] in the first person
[1:42:43] I thought
[1:42:45] all true Prophets
[1:42:48] spoke in the first person right that's
[1:42:51] right
[1:42:55] that's why they said thus saith the Lord
[1:43:01] they were not saying what they meant or
[1:43:04] thought
[1:43:05] they were saying what God Said right
[1:43:09] right their lips were turned over to God
[1:43:11] so he could speak
[1:43:19] ing about brother Branham listen to
[1:43:21] Brother Richard there today at home
[1:43:23] talking about the ceciling the things
[1:43:27] thinking about brother Branham on that
[1:43:28] sixth Hill he said we're not still open
[1:43:30] he said I just kind of walked down the
[1:43:32] room
[1:43:34] oops
[1:43:37] go back and find out what he's talking
[1:43:39] about yeah that's right he was talking
[1:43:41] about that those two prophets open that
[1:43:45] six seal
[1:43:51] one time he even said they were that six
[1:43:53] still that's right that's how close
[1:43:56] correct but he said they opened that
[1:43:58] Sixth Seal when they want to
[1:44:00] don't you think he was standing there
[1:44:02] looking
[1:44:03] I've done preached six of them by the
[1:44:05] wisdom of God
[1:44:07] you're standing here now trying to tell

[1:45:34] just read that over and over and over
[1:45:36] there
[1:45:38] and look at it

[1:46:14] at in the Catholic Church did
[1:46:18] to confuse you
[1:46:22] to keep you from seeing the truth
[1:46:26] one of The Commandments I thought said
[1:46:29] something about it it was just one God
[1:46:31] beside him it was no other
[1:46:36] I thought that's what we used to all
[1:46:37] make that statement there was one thing
[1:46:39] God didn't know
[1:46:41] you know there's one thing I don't know
