[14:56] keep us in Jesus name
[15:00] job
[15:04] seven
[15:05] let me just read verse 17 and 18.
[15:09] what is man
[15:11] that thou shouldest Magnify Him
[15:14] and that I should have set down heart
[15:16] upon him
[15:17] and if I should have visited him every
[15:19] morning and try him every moment you may
[15:24] be seated Lord that is blessing to the
[15:27] reading of the word now we're still in
[15:30] Ephesians and talking about
[15:32] predestination and we'll get back to
[15:34] some of the things but I just wanted to
[15:37] uh
[15:38] we've been so much trying to preach in
[15:40] eternity of going you know so far and
[15:43] then the eternity going so far back
[15:46] and if you can't go just as far back
[15:48] with eternity as you can forward then
[15:50] you don't understand what eternity is so
[15:53] you know but we're going to get down
[15:55] into that and probably uh the next
[15:58] service will be on uh still in the
[16:02] Ephesians to you know predestinated in
[16:05] him and and things like that to just
[16:07] kind of cover individually uh some of
[16:10] the things that are said but I just got
[16:12] a thought to her thinking a little bit
[16:14] last night you know how to approach
[16:17] and uh I thought well what we need to do
[16:20] is just really just think about
[16:24] you know where we are and what we're
[16:27] doing and really what we are amen and I
[16:30] just got that thought you know from the
[16:32] scripture and we'll get on over in a
[16:34] minute into Hebrews but you know
[16:37] uh
[16:40] job he was a pretty smart man
[16:43] and the county during the day is to be
[16:45] the smartest of all and uh so he asked
[16:49] that question
[16:51] what is man
[16:54] that thou should have Magnify Him
[16:57] and thou should have set thine heart
[16:59] upon him now we take that and we'll go
[17:02] we'll get over it a minute in the book
[17:03] of Hebrews okay and Psalms to pick up
[17:06] the others but
[17:09] um I want you to think on it because I
[17:12] wrote in my Bible many years ago there
[17:14] in Hebrews 2
[17:16] you know we're talking about what his
[17:18] man in the dark mindful of him and the
[17:19] son of man that thou envisages him and I
[17:22] wrote dire I wrote bride and Son of Man
[17:27] you know because that's what I want you
[17:30] to think about right see we we take it
[17:32] as being just you know when it says what
[17:35] is man we take it as being just the son
[17:39] of man
[17:40] see God will take that and we'll read it
[17:43] and all let's just go there and read
[17:45] that one where we'll have it in our our
[17:46] talk go to Hebrews 6.
[17:49] and uh you know
[17:52] Hebrews 2 6.
[17:54] and uh just just think on a little
[17:56] something
[17:58] because that's what I want to get a
[17:59] point across now what do you what are
[18:01] you
[18:04] ever thought about what you are
[18:07] Mommy what do you mean not me you know
[18:09] I'm a human being but have you ever
[18:11] thought about it it's really thought
[18:13] about it
[18:14] so think on this verse 6 Hebrews 2 verse
[18:18] 6. but one in a certain place testified
[18:21] saying what is man that dark mindful of
[18:24] him
[18:25] are the son of man that thou visited him
[18:28] all right
[18:30] see Thou made us him a little lower than
[18:32] the angels I promise him with glory and
[18:34] honor and just set him over the works of
[18:37] thy hands
[18:38] that has put all things in subjection
[18:40] under his feet but in that he put all in
[18:43] subjection under him he'll have nothing
[18:45] that's not put under him but now we see
[18:47] not yet all things put under him but we
[18:50] see Jesus okay so when you really you
[18:52] know when people you say well what the
[18:54] scripture what is man and in your mind
[18:57] will automatically go over to thinking
[19:00] about the son of man
[19:02] me but I don't want you to do that I
[19:05] want you to think about the question if
[19:07] not asked of who is the son of man
[19:09] because God knew who that was
[19:12] right you know or what is the son of man
[19:13] the question is what is man
[19:17] you know
[19:19] what is man that thou art mindful of you
[19:22] well she back over again in job see he
[19:26] didn't list
[19:27] anything there about the son of man
[19:32] see he just said what is man that dog
[19:35] that thou shouldest Magnify Him
[19:38] you know honor and glory and things to
[19:41] be brought to him all right then he's
[19:44] asking us the question do you know who
[19:47] you are
[19:49] what is man
[19:52] why would God be concerned about man
[19:59] what would be the the point that he
[20:01] would he would be any thoughts concerned
[20:03] drop over a couple of scriptures in in
[20:05] the 15th chapter
[20:07] and uh you know 15th chapter in the 14th
[20:10] verse
[20:12] what is man that thou should
[20:14] that he should be cleaned so now we know
[20:17] that that's not talking about the son of
[20:19] man
[20:21] and he which is born of a woman that he
[20:24] should be righteous
[20:27] why would God be concerned about man
[20:30] that's much more
[20:33] what is it so great about man
[20:36] that would cause God
[20:40] to
[20:42] consider it or ask the question
[20:45] what is my
[20:49] all right go over and Psalms
[20:53] I'm ready
[20:57] this is the one where it's picked up
[20:59] from
[21:00] Hebrews but it doesn't carry all the way
[21:03] you remember and Paul picks it up a
[21:04] little higher he said what is man that
[21:06] dark mindful of him and the son of man
[21:09] the top visits him for that's made him a
[21:11] little lower you know crowned him with
[21:13] glory and honors and made us him to have
[21:15] dominion over the works of thy hands now
[21:19] I thought we believed
[21:22] that
[21:24] man in his
[21:26] original condition or existence or
[21:29] thought
[21:30] you know as a spiritual man
[21:34] that that spiritual man was placed Over
[21:37] the Garden
[21:39] that's right that you could rule the
[21:40] animals you know like the Holy Spirit
[21:43] does
[21:45] because he was in that form now we'll
[21:47] get to that in the next message or so
[21:49] but the point I want you to think about
[21:51] now is just think about yourself
[21:53] right what is it good about man
[21:59] I mean are we so wonderful
[22:06] you really
[22:08] I I'm wondering about it because that
[22:11] was the thought
[22:12] that what is man
[22:17] why would God not be
[22:19] uh just as concerned or thoughtful about
[22:23] the animals
[22:26] when they're under his control
[22:31] and they can you know a storm can be
[22:34] coming right and there's a Wonder his
[22:37] control until they'll leave the place
[22:38] get out of the Rocks because of the
[22:41] earthquakes
[22:43] they'll they can be led
[22:45] and man had to be driven into the ark
[22:49] right
[22:51] I mean sure he was told to build an ark
[22:53] but he basically had to be made go into
[22:55] art
[22:57] but the animals travel from all over the
[22:59] world
[23:01] it took 120 years to to build the art
[23:06] well it probably took God 120 years to
[23:09] get all the animals to travel you know
[23:10] the distance he had to get him to travel
[23:12] because you didn't have no boats back
[23:15] then to run over and pick them up bring
[23:16] them over for you you know
[23:19] but I got thinking about that one time
[23:21] and I was looking at you know and seeing
[23:23] how long it would take say for an
[23:26] elephant to leave Africa and keep
[23:29] migrating and keep migrating and keep
[23:31] migrating and then you wind up with two
[23:34] of them to her you know to to get in the
[23:37] ark but yet my point is God could lead
[23:40] them right and he can lead the animals
[23:43] he looked like he'd be more satisfied
[23:45] with the animals than he is with
[23:47] anything you know of us but you know
[23:51] what really makes God so mindful and
[23:56] brother Theo a rationalize if you
[23:58] remember him always liked him he's a
[23:59] good brother you know and he always had
[24:01] a little catch phrases and things and
[24:03] kind of my brother Ernie going away you
[24:06] know he had his own little way of saying
[24:07] it and he said he preached on that one
[24:10] time you know what his man the dark
[24:11] mindful of him and he said see that
[24:14] he said God's mind is just full of us
[24:18] he's just full of us
[24:21] because he's mindful so his mind is just
[24:24] packed full well why
[24:28] what's
[24:29] what is so great
[24:31] about man
[24:34] that would make God the creator of all
[24:37] the universe
[24:40] but yet he would
[24:43] bottle himself or whatever would be the
[24:46] word for it right to come down to earth
[24:50] make all of the things
[24:53] and brother Brown said he knew that some
[24:55] of us would like mountains
[24:57] and City creative mountains he said he
[25:00] knew some would like planes flat land
[25:02] somewhere like this some would like the
[25:04] ocean some would like this you know
[25:06] mountainous ranges whatever and he said
[25:09] he made all of that
[25:11] brush
[25:17] he put everything there
[25:21] for you and I yep
[25:24] and we wound up being the last
[25:27] creation
[25:31] you know in the chain of creating I told
[25:34] you we're going to go back and start
[25:35] this Earthly Journey now and travel
[25:37] along a little bit in it on
[25:39] predestination where we can see it
[25:43] but
[25:45] he made you and I
[25:46] the last one
[25:52] now
[25:55] what did why did he
[25:58] bring everything down to where you and I
[26:01] are at
[26:03] you know oh I know we think we're pretty
[26:06] you know we think we're dead we think
[26:09] we're all kind of things you know we
[26:11] think we're so great until that no what
[26:14] what is the point
[26:18] why would
[26:20] Joe asked the question two times
[26:23] the psalmist asked the question
[26:26] and then Paul asked the question
[26:29] what is man
[26:32] and each time that I said we want to
[26:35] just go on over to the son of man but
[26:37] each time it's asking a question about
[26:39] man
[26:42] and telling though that man is to
[26:46] be over everything
[26:49] to rule over everything
[26:52] but why
[26:53] what's the what's the point
[26:57] me
[26:59] why would he not be as concerned with
[27:02] the animal life
[27:08] to say what is a monkey
[27:11] what is this or what is that but no it's
[27:13] what is man
[27:16] so there must be something about man
[27:19] that
[27:20] is coming down into the highest chain of
[27:23] creation
[27:25] that would bring that man to a place
[27:28] that God was pleased
[27:31] all right
[27:33] so you'll find it in Genesis that he was
[27:36] pleased to the first day you know
[27:40] second day Third Day Etc
[27:43] he was pleased at his creation right but
[27:48] he made us the last
[27:49] coming in on the sixth day and being man
[27:53] and as he did
[27:57] what made him so concerned
[28:00] that he would tie up the entire world
[28:04] to try to get an answer to you and I
[28:08] no
[28:11] went on that beat
[28:15] God had always tried to contact man
[28:18] you look down through the Old Testament
[28:20] you see the things happening you see men
[28:22] that would be like Moses that would you
[28:25] know come so close to God until that he
[28:29] would actually be speaking you know and
[28:31] God you know they decided to cover his
[28:33] face because he'd been in the presence
[28:35] of God
[28:39] and he was pleased with man even though
[28:42] a fallen State a state right
[28:46] he didn't destroy us when we sinned
[28:49] nope
[28:53] you say well he was just looking at the
[28:55] atonement was I'm glad with that
[28:56] whatever you're looking at but the point
[29:00] is he didn't destroy us amen
[29:05] is it that he loves a sinful no no
[29:08] that's beside the point
[29:14] but maybe it's in our creation
[29:20] because of where the lies and the
[29:21] creation
[29:24] then maybe it's in that creation
[29:28] do we know that
[29:30] they're in Genesis and we'll get back to
[29:33] that it's the spiritual part later but I
[29:35] want you to hold it just the name of
[29:37] this thing I'm just you know I'm just
[29:39] going to just talk to you about it and
[29:41] just it's something that's on the heart
[29:43] and you listen
[29:48] you know God is a Triune being
[29:52] all right
[29:54] Father Son and Holy Ghost
[29:56] right
[29:57] and when he created man
[30:00] he created a crown being
[30:05] a body
[30:06] spirit
[30:08] so
[30:10] you know
[30:11] any creative in His image
[30:14] now if you don't like the word image
[30:16] there in Genesis for the natural man
[30:18] just say lightness to him because it
[30:21] does have image and likeness you know
[30:23] so if you don't like image too much just
[30:25] use the word likeness and forgive my my
[30:28] inability to understand
[30:32] but my point is man even in his Fallen
[30:36] estate
[30:39] he's still in the image of God
[30:44] amen
[30:45] even in the Fallen estate
[30:51] none of the animals sure and I know they
[30:54] can progressively train them to do
[30:56] things Etc yeah
[30:58] but still they've never been able to
[31:00] train a bird how to build its nest any
[31:02] different right it may have had to adapt
[31:05] to the position it built it in that
[31:07] instead of building it in a tree it
[31:09] builds it in the corner of your house or
[31:11] somewhere where it can find a hole but
[31:14] you know I steal this bill that mess
[31:16] everything's the same
[31:19] but man is constantly changing
[31:24] I'm 70 years old and in my lifetime we
[31:27] have went from a horse and buggy
[31:31] you know to an astronaut
[31:34] all right
[31:36] In Our Lifetime the advancement of
[31:38] science
[31:40] no the word that we we're it's just
[31:44] almost
[31:45] uh Unthinkable about the things that man
[31:48] can do
[31:50] you're sitting with a a little cell
[31:53] phone in your pocket there
[31:56] and those things are a computer
[31:59] you know
[32:01] I mean you know
[32:03] it can do everything that the big laptop
[32:05] computer can do and contact things and
[32:08] do everything just you know
[32:11] it was created by man
[32:13] right
[32:14] even medical science
[32:19] do we go off on a lot of the things but
[32:22] even in medical science
[32:24] you know
[32:25] that's what I was telling Brother Dean
[32:27] the other day I said when they they said
[32:29] that that that aneurysm remember how you
[32:31] pronounce this big old word that was
[32:34] there I said when they said that it was
[32:36] what was causing the trouble I said well
[32:38] thank God that it made your eye to start
[32:41] hurting
[32:42] because had it not
[32:44] it may have just blowed out and killed
[32:47] you
[32:48] know
[32:48] all right every how they found brother
[32:51] Danny's there and operated see thank God
[32:54] for that
[32:56] I mean back when we was kids you know
[32:59] you didn't have anything
[33:03] to her if he did he didn't know what to
[33:05] do
[33:06] and we had our own home home remedies
[33:09] and and those were just about as good as
[33:11] anything because if you got the coffin
[33:14] they would just take some some uh
[33:16] kerosene and and a little sugar and
[33:20] or something like that coal oil and and
[33:22] they put that sugar on that kerosene or
[33:25] kerosene on the sugar and you'd be
[33:27] creeping like everything and coughing
[33:28] well once you've got that and put it in
[33:30] your mouth you didn't cough no more it
[33:33] may have been self-control it kept you
[33:35] from coughing but you just didn't cough
[33:37] anymore because it would just clean out
[33:39] everything
[33:41] well now we don't do that today you know
[33:44] we take a cough dropper we take a go get
[33:48] some some kind of medicine something for
[33:49] it but you see how that we've Advanced
[33:52] all right because it says in Genesis
[33:55] that that nothing is withholding
[33:58] from the imagination of man
[34:02] and we really are in the day that you
[34:05] can see that right that now it's never
[34:09] been that instantly around the world
[34:12] you know I mean you can talk on the
[34:15] telephone
[34:16] you know we was in Israel and
[34:19] Manny woke up and said what are you
[34:21] doing I said I'm calling them at the
[34:23] church
[34:24] yes son
[34:26] six or nine hours different anyhow I
[34:28] calculated the time and she said what
[34:30] time is it here I said three in the
[34:32] morning what do you call it a three in
[34:34] the morning or I said it's not three in
[34:37] the morning dark
[34:38] well see that was good but now it's a
[34:41] whole lot more instant than that
[34:43] everything is just so great until it's
[34:46] it's almost you know
[34:49] beyond the thinking of man's mind right
[34:51] and the reason that he can do that is
[34:54] because
[34:55] he's a little Creator right yeah
[35:01] he's a little creator
[35:03] he can take things and work it out
[35:06] I've always said to you you can destroy
[35:08] right now
[35:09] the uh the things it took no telling it
[35:13] probably took for the first two thousand
[35:15] years it probably took
[35:17] a thousand years for them to develop a
[35:20] way to to temper meddling things from
[35:22] doing things right
[35:25] but you see even what knowledge was
[35:27] brought over to Ark
[35:30] and just you know knowing his children
[35:33] you know it was just a little while they
[35:35] were tempering metal again
[35:38] well because they had the knowledge of
[35:39] it
[35:41] and look what he'd be now if you just
[35:43] wiped out everything
[35:45] but left just a few people with a little
[35:47] knowledge you can bring it right back
[35:49] why because we're a little creators
[35:51] right
[35:53] that's right and see that's what God
[35:54] likes about us
[35:57] thank you
[35:59] Elijah the part about us being the word
[36:03] it
[36:04] We're In His Image
[36:07] like I said even in our fallen estate
[36:10] right
[36:13] sure we hadn't fail we wouldn't need all
[36:15] of this but in our fallen estate
[36:18] they just constantly coming up with some
[36:20] way of doing something better
[36:23] we're building houses better we're
[36:25] building cars better we're we're doing
[36:27] all kind of things a whole lot better
[36:29] than we used to be
[36:32] because
[36:34] they were a little creative
[36:39] but see God then is pleased to dwell
[36:41] with us
[36:44] yeah
[36:45] no I mean I'm carnal I know
[36:49] sorry but
[36:51] you know I think God would be more and
[36:54] more
[36:55] enjoyment sitting down and talking to
[36:57] Einstein
[36:59] about his theories
[37:03] than it would be because I don't know
[37:04] anything about them
[37:06] you know
[37:08] you understand what I'm trying to get
[37:10] across
[37:13] that
[37:14] there's something about you and I
[37:18] that makes God want to dwell with us
[37:21] amen
[37:24] when he created this for worship well
[37:26] that's true
[37:28] but he dwells with us when we don't even
[37:30] worship Him
[37:33] right
[37:35] so what is man
[37:41] he's created in the image of his maker
[37:47] and I keep saying that even in the
[37:49] Fallen estate
[37:55] that man is still
[37:58] it's it's just Unthinkable about this
[38:01] the ability of mankind
[38:06] and if that be true then there must be
[38:09] something there that
[38:10] he likes
[38:15] no
[38:17] what is it that would make him like us
[38:19] so much
[38:22] it's because we're created in His image
[38:25] that's it
[38:30] he's a Trion being foreign
[38:48] I believe almighty God is real right man
[38:52] I don't believe him and just think about
[38:54] him as being some kind of a mythologies
[38:57] or a myths or thoughts
[38:59] I believe he's real
[39:02] I believe he's more tangible than we're
[39:04] tangible
[39:06] right
[39:10] which is
[39:13] he's asked the question do you know what
[39:16] you are
[39:20] well yeah I know I made in the image of
[39:22] a maker but but what image
[39:28] you see this is where most people don't
[39:30] even want to go that far about it
[39:31] because they want to say God is the
[39:33] spirit and no no I believe God is real
[39:37] you want to know what I think God looks
[39:39] like
[39:41] I think it looks like you
[39:46] hey
[39:48] I Think Jesus was the proof of that
[39:53] he was almighty God made into human
[39:56] flesh
[40:02] but do we really know who we are and
[40:04] what we're doing
[40:06] you know we were brought here for a
[40:08] purpose
[40:10] and is it just to worship
[40:15] that's what people deal with you know
[40:17] we're probably here to worship God we're
[40:19] brought here huh no
[40:23] we're brought here for rulership
[40:26] right we'll get to more of that on
[40:28] adoptions and things
[40:30] but we're brought here
[40:34] to rule the world
[40:37] sure look what a garbage can we've made
[40:39] out of it
[40:40] right
[40:43] but that's still beside the point
[40:46] that he brought us here for that purpose
[40:50] that's what the psalmist said that's
[40:53] what that job said
[40:56] everything was to be under our Dominion
[41:01] and even in your Fallen estate
[41:05] the very very few animals
[41:09] that are not
[41:12] fully under our subjection as far as
[41:15] leadership
[41:18] and they can even be brought to that
[41:20] right they've trained almost every
[41:23] animal and form in the world from virus
[41:26] to
[41:30] mankind has been able to take over and
[41:33] and
[41:34] train them
[41:39] so it means there's something about you
[41:45] that those animals are that's right
[41:47] under your subjection
[41:53] so that's why they tell you for buyers
[41:59] attack
[42:00] scream at it
[42:03] you take a dog ask any of these you take
[42:05] a dog that's coming at you speak to him
[42:07] in a Stern voice
[42:10] I'm scared of you don't get out of here
[42:14] no get out of here and leave me alone
[42:19] let's turn the voice the quicker they'll
[42:21] mind you
[42:22] why because there's something about you
[42:25] he was made to be under your subjection
[42:28] and even in your Fallen estate he's
[42:31] under your subjection
[42:34] the Bible says you know that we put uh
[42:37] what is it bridles in the horse's mouth
[42:39] and the things we've been able to train
[42:41] as I said almost every animal in the
[42:44] world in some way or other at one time
[42:46] had been able to be conquered of mankind
[42:49] right
[42:51] because he's their master
[42:56] and brother random I'll give you a quote
[42:58] later about it but he said to our work
[43:01] said let us make man
[43:02] he said that was God talking to the
[43:05] animals
[43:07] you know
[43:08] how he was going to make the man
[43:12] in other words he's gonna make him a
[43:14] ruler over them right
[43:17] and even though we're you know even
[43:19] though it's a fallen estate it's still
[43:21] that rule factor is there
[43:24] live the what if man
[43:32] all right so then if we're a try and
[43:34] being we need to understand about that a
[43:36] little
[43:38] we can spend a lot of time talking about
[43:40] things but you know we need to
[43:43] understand
[43:49] see we only as I said we take where it
[43:52] says what is man and we just leave that
[43:55] alone we don't want to fool with that
[43:57] but then when it comes you know and the
[43:59] son of man
[44:03] we emphasize that but the emphasis is
[44:06] upon the question that was to start with
[44:08] what his man
[44:14] she being a try on being then
[44:18] to be Body Spirit and soul
[44:23] then we deal with God or should deal
[44:26] with God as a try on being
[44:29] but when we say try on being of God what
[44:31] do we say
[44:32] father son Holy Ghost
[44:35] right
[44:38] foreign
[44:39] we just put it on that basis
[44:42] but why can't we look farther back and
[44:45] see that almighty God is more real than
[44:47] we are
[44:54] you mean he would just floating around
[44:56] up there's a glove you know this
[45:02] why can't we think of him being Body
[45:04] Spirit and soul that's right
[45:11] why can't we think of him as being real
[45:17] Cody made Man real
[45:21] right
[45:23] right gave us Dominion gave us all the
[45:27] things
[45:29] and I keep saying Even in our fallen
[45:31] estate
[45:33] that image is still dark
[45:35] that we're we're a little creator
[45:41] and God likes that
[45:44] because he brought into being
[45:47] he could fellowship with the animals and
[45:49] lead him sure
[45:51] but he brought into being a man
[45:55] that he could fellowship with
[45:59] did we take it as Fellowship on the
[46:01] basis that that he created us for
[46:03] Fellowship well why not take it to bases
[46:05] that he created us for fellowship and
[46:08] plain sense about what it's saying he
[46:10] created us to fellowship with us
[46:14] we want to put all the emphasis about
[46:16] fellowshipping with him that's right but
[46:18] he wants to fellowship with us
[46:20] you don't run around said he'd come down
[46:22] in the cool of the evening
[46:25] or in the garden
[46:28] and he said children
[46:30] have you had a good day today
[46:34] have you enjoyed this day in the garden
[46:38] he said he'd put him to sleep at night
[46:41] and said he was pleased amen I thought
[46:45] he was pleased he was happy
[46:49] well because he had something in his own
[46:51] image right
[46:53] he had something he could fellowship
[46:55] with
[46:57] see I'm trying to compare it now
[46:59] he because he couldn't fellowship with
[47:02] the animal
[47:03] Kingdom because they were not like him
[47:09] they were a whole lot better than you
[47:10] and I but they still wouldn't like him
[47:15] and why can't you believe God is real
[47:20] because he made you and I real amen
[47:24] and he made us to fellowship with us
[47:28] you might as a trial and being
[47:31] thought did it we were in His image he
[47:33] was a Triumph being
[47:37] she understood their mind go father son
[47:39] Holy Ghost
[47:41] no
[47:42] if we're a crown being Body Spirit and
[47:45] soul he was a Trion being Body Spirit
[47:47] and soul
[47:51] it took
[47:52] quite a while to bring it into being
[47:55] that's right
[47:57] that he could manifest himself
[48:01] but you know what
[48:04] the biggest portion of his manifestation
[48:06] of himself was brought into being after
[48:10] we fail all right all right amen
[48:16] you'd be easy to understand how he could
[48:19] come down as I said in the garden with
[48:20] Adam and Eve and there was no sin
[48:25] no problem right
[48:29] but yet the biggest portion of his
[48:31] downward descent toward
[48:35] his brain into being upon what we call
[48:38] time and Earth
[48:40] has taken place after the fall of
[48:42] mankind
[48:45] all right
[48:48] so don't you think he might still be
[48:50] pleased to dwell
[48:54] now we want our children to do good
[48:56] don't we
[48:58] you know
[49:00] we want our children to be good and to
[49:02] do good and we're happy about them doing
[49:04] anything but now just because it they're
[49:07] not exactly the way that we like them do
[49:09] we quit fellowshipping with them
[49:16] no it's been a proven fact
[49:18] the meanest kid in the family gets all
[49:21] of its benefits
[49:23] right
[49:25] you can argue with that if you want to
[49:27] but it's true
[49:29] you take one of the kids in the family
[49:31] they got maybe four kids and maybe four
[49:33] boys you know and three of them is
[49:35] pretty good guys and they went out and
[49:36] they're doing all right and one of them
[49:37] sorry slot and mud wouldn't work for
[49:40] nothing but who does mom and daddy take
[49:41] care of
[49:48] it just trying to make a point right
[49:50] all right I ain't saying that we come
[49:52] into the world to cut Sinners that make
[49:53] God happy now don't get misunderstand me
[49:56] I'm trying to illustrate
[49:59] but even in the Fallen condition
[50:03] God still wants to come down and
[50:07] fellowship with you and I
[50:13] am that's where it's always been
[50:15] yeah
[50:17] why because we're created in this image
[50:22] so then if we're a trial and being why
[50:24] can't we believe he's a trial and being
[50:26] right all right man right when this is
[50:29] over with
[50:30] are we going up to heaven you know and
[50:33] we're going to get up there and there's
[50:34] going to be a little Pillar of Fire over
[50:36] here that's the father gonna be a little
[50:39] Dove over here at the Holy Ghost and
[50:42] no
[50:43] I thought the Bible said that we would
[50:46] be like him
[50:47] you know
[50:49] and I thought the prophet said that when
[50:51] we get there we'll see him
[50:56] it won't be just floating around clouds
[50:58] and pillars of Fire
[51:02] to be real
[51:04] it seemingly to me has been the hardest
[51:06] thing to try to preach one God
[51:09] in the correct order that's ever been on
[51:12] this one basis
[51:14] is to try to get people to see what I
[51:17] believe
[51:18] that God is real
[51:23] when you talk about father son holy
[51:29] holy God
[51:32] but do you believe God is real
[51:37] or is he just the thoughts of your mind
[51:38] because if he if he's Spirit or
[51:40] something
[51:46] now if if we are real
[51:49] and he's not real well which one is the
[51:51] best or which you know
[51:53] we would be greater than him right
[51:59] right but he wanted man
[52:01] to live on the earth and rule the Earth
[52:07] and now listen you can argued a point do
[52:10] all you want to but man was made to put
[52:12] in the garden to till the soil
[52:15] that's right that's before the fall
[52:17] see we want to make it after the fall
[52:19] that he had to do it now after the fall
[52:21] is the sweat of your brow
[52:24] nowhere to become hard to do all right
[52:26] amen oh
[52:31] yeah but man was put here until the
[52:34] storm yep
[52:36] to take care of the garden
[52:42] sure it works on them yep amen there's
[52:46] minor G credit said where
[52:50] that's the word we don't like
[52:55] but what's the problem with work
[52:58] all right
[53:01] you know what's the trouble with it
[53:02] sorry laziness having a lot of trouble
[53:04] with it
[53:05] but now listen I'm trying to just get a
[53:08] plain little point to you
[53:10] about something that the Lord began to
[53:13] deal with me about it because he has for
[53:15] years about this and you know I preached
[53:16] on it and I believe God is real
[53:20] but I don't believe he's just some
[53:22] floating around something that you can't
[53:24] you know find him and you know you just
[53:28] uh
[53:30] I believe he's real
[53:32] I believe he's more real than we are
[53:36] well now brother Dale is the 16 elements
[53:39] well his body comes from 16 elements
[53:41] that's right amen
[53:43] okay
[53:46] but I believe this the afternoon sole
[53:49] being of his person was more real than
[53:52] than what we're talking about here
[53:55] amen because we believe he brought us
[53:58] here why can't we believe the one great
[54:00] is greater that brought us here than
[54:01] what we are right amen
[54:05] amen but you see then you get into the
[54:07] the message of the hour and people they
[54:11] have trouble to understanding Body
[54:13] Spirit and soul
[54:17] and they think well that your your soul
[54:20] well it's just the nature of your spirit
[54:24] well now you're not making it real
[54:29] you're making it just something you
[54:31] think
[54:32] just the nature it's a thought
[54:37] let's see you're real right amen that's
[54:40] right that's easy to look at the body
[54:42] and see that it's pretty real
[54:48] but you know what we get so tied up into
[54:50] that until we think that's the real
[54:52] thing
[54:55] now inside of you is something greater
[54:57] than you are because this body can't
[54:58] figure out how to make no no airplane
[55:01] different or a car different right
[55:04] this body ain't nothing but just moving
[55:07] it and just you know moving muscles and
[55:09] things
[55:10] it doesn't have any thinking ability
[55:12] right
[55:13] you can't figure out things it's no
[55:16] different than animal right man
[55:20] and if you leave him with just the
[55:22] spirit part of him
[55:25] you're no different than any animal
[55:27] there is amen
[55:31] and there was a doctor in many many
[55:32] years ago before I heard of the message
[55:34] I ran into it that man didn't have a
[55:36] soul till the law came oh
[55:40] well I mean I heard a man sit there and
[55:42] teach it they're adorable and I just
[55:44] asked him one simple question I said
[55:46] well
[55:47] you know I I thought that the Bible said
[55:49] that God breathed into the nostrils of
[55:52] Adam and he'd become a living soul
[55:54] right he said I never thought of that
[55:57] but you know what I mean I I didn't know
[56:01] nothing but I did try to believe the
[56:03] word all right
[56:05] but see is your God real
[56:07] or are you more real than your God is
[56:11] all right
[56:13] which way is it
[56:16] me
[56:20] but see then we get into the
[56:22] intellectualism of the Mind as we call
[56:24] it
[56:27] well you know that brain of your
[56:28] intellectualism and all like that's your
[56:30] spiritual part of you whatever you want
[56:32] to call it memory reason constant
[56:33] defections
[56:35] you know that that that's no different
[56:37] than animal
[56:39] unless there's something controlling it
[56:41] right
[56:45] right
[56:47] just the highest form of animals
[56:51] so when he created man he made Man In
[56:53] His Image
[56:56] now can I quote brother Brown
[56:58] he made your body in the image of the
[57:01] animal
[57:03] a hand like a chimpanzee a foot like a
[57:06] bar Etc
[57:10] so he created our bodies in the image of
[57:12] animal life
[57:15] so what was the real part that was
[57:17] created in the image of God
[57:22] be the soul of mankind
[57:27] see then we make it this shoulder it was
[57:30] just a nature
[57:32] now you're bringing it down to something
[57:34] that you're not letting it be real and
[57:36] you're saying the same thing we used to
[57:38] say well God it's just a spirit
[57:42] what do you mean brother Dale he's real
[57:44] he's just a spirit
[57:48] well you better remember one thing if he
[57:51] is just the spirit that spirit is more
[57:53] real than you are cause that's being
[57:55] brought you here right right
[57:57] amen
[58:00] but see we want to just do it that way
[58:02] so what his name
[58:06] the when he created me and he made him
[58:07] in his image
[58:12] so the real soul of you is what the
[58:14] image of God is right right
[58:20] what is your soul
[58:24] well it's just some kind of nature you
[58:26] got any well then the dogs out of the
[58:27] way because you got dogs that are that
[58:29] are they're naturally born and you don't
[58:32] have to train them to be a bird dog
[58:36] right they'll go out and bring burnt off
[58:40] yep
[58:42] because it's a nature that's born within
[58:44] them
[58:48] but seeing Mankind we have to be trained
[58:52] you take a little puppy dog
[58:55] you know nothing just gets working walk
[58:58] you know two weeks old or something
[59:00] maybe
[59:01] or a month oh whatever just a little
[59:03] puppy dog
[59:04] and you say that on the edge of a table
[59:08] and you know what it'll sit there and
[59:10] wine
[59:12] and look off
[59:15] right
[59:18] but you put a baby out there that can
[59:20] crawl
[59:23] it'll crawl off and fall
[59:26] so which one's smarter
[59:30] right the
[59:33] the nature is still there of each one
[59:35] because they're natural
[59:38] but there's something about that baby
[59:40] then that you'll give that baby a little
[59:42] while to grow up and something begins to
[59:44] motivate within it
[59:46] and to come out into a controlling
[59:48] Factor until it not only will not fall
[59:51] off the table it can make a table
[59:55] me
[59:57] well that's the real you
[1:00:01] the real you
[1:00:03] now but you're a Trion being a body
[1:00:06] spirit and soul and here's where in the
[1:00:08] message that people go wrong then
[1:00:11] when I come to this I must explain one
[1:00:13] thing that the Lord showed me many years
[1:00:15] ago when I thank God for it
[1:00:18] basically up until 1962 on the message
[1:00:21] called the greatest battle ever fought I
[1:00:23] said basically now because
[1:00:26] get my point in a minute you'll see
[1:00:28] basically up until that point brother
[1:00:31] Brown would cover a human being as being
[1:00:33] body
[1:00:35] Soul and Spirit
[1:00:40] that's the way he would describe your
[1:00:41] body Soul and Spirit
[1:00:45] all right
[1:00:48] but then after the the word began to be
[1:00:51] revealed to him and right after you go
[1:00:53] to the greatest battle ever fought you
[1:00:55] watch him he's just going like this he
[1:00:56] just seemingly having the problem with
[1:00:59] his battle in and understanding but then
[1:01:01] after then you watch him and he always
[1:01:03] teach them what
[1:01:05] Body Spirit and soul
[1:01:12] in the beginning he would put the spirit
[1:01:15] as the center Realm
[1:01:18] may you study the message I got two
[1:01:20] quotes laying here in front of them if
[1:01:21] you want them
[1:01:22] one of them on the inside in 1962 see
[1:01:24] 119 that he called his body Soul and
[1:01:27] Spirit
[1:01:28] and then on the Rapture message in 1965
[1:01:32] he covers his body spirit and soul
[1:01:35] I know just two it's brought to you
[1:01:39] see that's where people go wrong with
[1:01:41] understanding the Bible and then they
[1:01:44] don't understand their own selves
[1:01:51] see then we go over to what is it uh
[1:01:55] is it Ezekiel works and I'll give you a
[1:01:57] new heart and your spirit 36.
[1:02:02] you see I'm glad brother random
[1:02:03] explained that right amen he said see
[1:02:06] there I should give you a new heart and
[1:02:07] your spirit he said you couldn't under
[1:02:09] you couldn't even fellowship with your
[1:02:10] own self with your old spirit
[1:02:12] yeah he said that's not the Holy Spirit
[1:02:15] that's right man
[1:02:17] he said because he gave you a new heart
[1:02:18] a new spirit he said that's not the Holy
[1:02:20] Spirit he said then he went on to say
[1:02:22] and and I put my spirit in you he said
[1:02:25] that's the Holy Spirit
[1:02:27] that's right
[1:02:28] but yet even in the time that he was
[1:02:30] quoting those scriptures and giving the
[1:02:32] understanding he added to the basis that
[1:02:35] the spirit was the center in with you
[1:02:40] and the Soul was the second ring
[1:02:43] he said well I've never heard run around
[1:02:45] and explain he's wrong he wouldn't
[1:02:50] you went wrong
[1:02:53] he didn't have to explain it
[1:02:55] because he never changed his senses
[1:03:00] no matter what he called it body we can
[1:03:03] always go with what she takes me or
[1:03:04] smell in here
[1:03:07] the second rim of man
[1:03:13] he would give the second realm of man
[1:03:15] memory reason conscience Etc whatever
[1:03:18] those five senses
[1:03:20] and the center of man would always be
[1:03:25] one since
[1:03:26] neither Faith or doubt it's not faith
[1:03:29] and doubt they hit it on that drawing
[1:03:31] back there and I erased it put on our
[1:03:33] faith or doubt that I've got in my
[1:03:35] office
[1:03:36] but it's not faith and doubt
[1:03:39] right
[1:03:41] his faith or doubt right all right but
[1:03:45] you get the point one saying see then
[1:03:47] the prophet didn't have to come back and
[1:03:48] say well look I was wrong explaining
[1:03:50] this about the soul and the spirit
[1:03:52] one because he always had his senses
[1:03:54] correct right through this goal when
[1:03:56] you're starting to study what you're
[1:03:57] talking about go and see what the sense
[1:04:00] is he's saying
[1:04:04] and if he says so
[1:04:08] and he says when people taste it see the
[1:04:10] Earth see there we get a new soul
[1:04:13] because that's the quote you know
[1:04:15] people say we get we get a new soul
[1:04:19] to every Prophet said
[1:04:21] we'll go back and see what he's talking
[1:04:23] about right
[1:04:25] he's talking about your second Rim right
[1:04:30] all right
[1:04:31] go check your senses just read a little
[1:04:34] bit
[1:04:35] you remember how it expressed it to you
[1:04:37] over and over and over all these years
[1:04:38] where the brother runs in our language
[1:04:40] is so messed up with about the board you
[1:04:42] know come on board pay your board
[1:04:44] because I'm bored with you
[1:04:46] no
[1:04:48] but all you got to do is just explain
[1:04:50] what you talking about each time you
[1:04:52] know what's the man talking about come
[1:04:53] on board
[1:04:55] stand on that board and pay your board
[1:04:58] because I'm bored with you now you know
[1:05:00] exactly what I'm talking about right
[1:05:03] but if you don't express it so what is
[1:05:05] it the before and after is always the
[1:05:07] answer so go back and study the
[1:05:09] prophet's message
[1:05:10] when he says you get a New Soul
[1:05:13] watch him and he'll cover in a minute
[1:05:15] that they sense as he's talking about
[1:05:21] see that you'd be surprised what that
[1:05:23] that cost me
[1:05:26] in fellowship with a lot of people but
[1:05:28] it's as playing it could be
[1:05:31] but explain to me that that's the way it
[1:05:33] is because he never changed them senses
[1:05:36] uh doing whether he called it Soul or
[1:05:39] spirit
[1:05:39] and see that's where you two Soul people
[1:05:42] came in that's where your uh your people
[1:05:45] that believe you get a New Soul
[1:05:46] you're coming down with the the
[1:05:48] different ones they use those quotes
[1:05:52] it's just like the man about the seven
[1:05:54] Thunder virtue
[1:05:55] random didn't know what the Thunders
[1:05:57] were until the seals broke he said he
[1:05:59] didn't
[1:06:00] and he said the Thunder was a voice when
[1:06:01] the seal broke
[1:06:03] and then they'll turn around and take a
[1:06:05] a 61 or 60 quote out of the church age
[1:06:08] book of thousands of live voices
[1:06:10] thundering out
[1:06:12] all right so she's already got them
[1:06:13] Thunders
[1:06:17] didn't even know what the Thunders were
[1:06:21] but you see that's always seemed to been
[1:06:23] my
[1:06:24] like maybe if you want to call anything
[1:06:26] that somebody's in the world for
[1:06:28] maybe mine has been to take all of those
[1:06:31] things where the contradictory look like
[1:06:33] statements come from and bring them down
[1:06:35] to a simple thing just like what we've
[1:06:38] been through in predestination where I
[1:06:40] always was eternal the prophet said if
[1:06:42] you have eternal life right
[1:06:45] now the before and after explained it
[1:06:47] didn't it if you have eternal life you
[1:06:50] always was eternal
[1:06:53] me go to see eternal life
[1:06:56] all right see I like it like that to me
[1:07:00] that's what I'm saying this morning
[1:07:03] with the restoration of the word
[1:07:07] with the restoration of the reveal work
[1:07:09] come to Restoration of power
[1:07:12] right
[1:07:15] all right
[1:07:16] he said well I I just don't see it I
[1:07:19] just don't see the power now
[1:07:21] what are you looking for
[1:07:25] words of that in you
[1:07:28] me why are you judging my my Apples by
[1:07:31] your one rotten one
[1:07:34] hmm
[1:07:35] but listen
[1:07:37] neither do we get it correctly to
[1:07:39] understand
[1:07:42] that you're a Triumph being
[1:07:45] what do you want to say Body Spirit Soul
[1:07:47] or Body Soul and Spirit as long as you
[1:07:49] know what you're talking about you can
[1:07:51] see that you're a trial and being
[1:07:55] you're not a trinity you're a trial and
[1:07:57] being exactly in the image of almighty
[1:08:00] God
[1:08:03] and like I said it took a long time to
[1:08:06] bring down things into order of God to
[1:08:09] break it down to where you could see
[1:08:10] that God was real
[1:08:14] he appeared in the Old Testament as
[1:08:16] Melchizedek
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:20] but Mankind's never been able to
[1:08:22] understand that one
[1:08:24] the prophet of God said we no longer see
[1:08:26] Melchizedek he said because male chatted
[1:08:29] it became Jesus Christ right
[1:08:35] now I told you back a month ago I guess
[1:08:37] was that we get down to it eventually
[1:08:40] and I won't finish the day on it but
[1:08:42] you don't find the soul being dealt with
[1:08:44] now I didn't say you didn't find a soul
[1:08:46] the word sold in the Old Testament I
[1:08:49] happen to look that up at 399 times so
[1:08:53] you worked soul is used in the Old
[1:08:55] Testament as a matter of fact it's used
[1:08:57] more in the Old Testament than this than
[1:08:58] you
[1:08:59] it worked so I didn't say now that you
[1:09:02] can't find a soul in the Old Testament
[1:09:04] right
[1:09:05] right you can't find a man in the Old
[1:09:07] Testament and understood her soul
[1:09:10] even David said my soul
[1:09:12] thirst after thee oh God
[1:09:15] we need another new burger
[1:09:20] the soul of man has always been a
[1:09:23] problem
[1:09:23] for mankind to understand
[1:09:28] because if we don't make it real what
[1:09:31] are we
[1:09:32] amen
[1:09:34] it's just some kind of a nature we got
[1:09:36] then the anointing can fall on you
[1:09:40] now anointed ones
[1:09:43] have the anointing on their Spirit right
[1:09:48] all right
[1:09:49] but you know anointed ones the anointing
[1:09:51] is genuine right right
[1:09:55] now what they do wrong is not the
[1:09:57] anointing
[1:09:59] right
[1:10:00] right
[1:10:02] they go out and live like the devil it's
[1:10:04] not the anointing that makes them live
[1:10:06] like the devil the anointing is the good
[1:10:08] part about them right
[1:10:11] but you see they don't understand the
[1:10:13] real part that's why you say well well
[1:10:15] all it is just understand well how come
[1:10:18] people don't understand anointing one
[1:10:25] right I'm talking about me and you
[1:10:29] do you really understand how the
[1:10:31] anointing can be on you and anoint you
[1:10:33] to do exactly right
[1:10:35] and you still be lost
[1:10:43] the anointing could be on you to get you
[1:10:45] to come to church to cry to pray to
[1:10:48] worship God Amen
[1:10:51] and you still be lost
[1:10:56] but we better quit dealing with
[1:10:58] something in a spiritual realm that we
[1:11:00] don't know what we're talking about you
[1:11:01] know that we can't get straight
[1:11:04] well brother Dale I I know I got the
[1:11:06] Holy Ghost God I love the Bible
[1:11:09] I loved it when I was in the Baptist
[1:11:13] well I know I'm right cause I know I got
[1:11:16] the Holy Ghost because I come in the
[1:11:18] message
[1:11:21] well the devil's got it on you because
[1:11:22] he beats you here
[1:11:25] all right right
[1:11:31] but you see we'll never be able to
[1:11:34] conquer death
[1:11:37] somebody's got to face this thing right
[1:11:40] and walk straight through death
[1:11:42] right and we'll never be able
[1:11:44] to do that until we understand who we
[1:11:46] are right
[1:11:48] and what we're doing here right God
[1:11:50] created you and me for a purpose amen
[1:11:52] that's right
[1:11:56] he's got something for you to do amen
[1:12:01] it's not all in the preacher's hands
[1:12:03] that's where the Prophet said be done he
[1:12:05] said they took it off of The Laffy back
[1:12:07] there and put it on the preacher let him
[1:12:09] do my praying let him do my doing let
[1:12:12] him tell me what God wants me to know
[1:12:16] he said that's wrong
[1:12:18] I like to preach to a group of people
[1:12:20] that knows what what the message is
[1:12:22] right man that's right
[1:12:25] no no man it used to in this message was
[1:12:27] made to be a big guy he told Brother
[1:12:30] monk one day he said you don't want to
[1:12:32] give them people all them books and
[1:12:33] Tasties because they don't wind up
[1:12:35] knowing much as you did oh my God said I
[1:12:38] want him to know what I know
[1:12:41] that's what I want you to know
[1:12:43] that's right you're not having to study
[1:12:45] for a message
[1:12:46] you can read anywhere God leads you to
[1:12:49] leave read from you know you just pick
[1:12:52] up books and study them I'm reading for
[1:12:54] a message all right
[1:12:55] I'm trying to find the mind of God for
[1:12:57] what I preach on
[1:13:00] but I want you to know see when I say
[1:13:03] try on being you say
[1:13:05] try on being
[1:13:07] I said we're trying to be in what are we
[1:13:09] you might say Body Spirit and soul
[1:13:16] man
[1:13:19] now say we're created in the image of
[1:13:22] God
[1:13:23] and even in our fallen estate
[1:13:27] and then you know the prophet said
[1:13:35] I give you the quotes when I think that
[1:13:37] there's a situation there that you're
[1:13:39] gonna
[1:13:39] maybe not understand what I'm doing
[1:13:43] you see I can preach for that note
[1:13:46] you know a quality to one
[1:13:49] because I get to talk
[1:13:51] and it's always to me what is man
[1:13:56] I'm sitting there praying Lord where did
[1:13:58] I go next what'd I say
[1:13:59] I said what is man
[1:14:03] okay
[1:14:04] what do you mean
[1:14:09] man it'll try on being created in the
[1:14:11] image of almighty God
[1:14:13] and even if
[1:14:15] still wants to come down and fellowship
[1:14:17] with us
[1:14:21] nurse in no
[1:14:24] with us as beings
[1:14:29] because he's real and he knows we're
[1:14:31] real
[1:14:33] and if like I said then I can can say
[1:14:35] when I've run around and said Body
[1:14:36] Spirit and soul
[1:14:38] you made me say My Soul and Spirit you
[1:14:41] say Amen we understand
[1:14:45] we understand that he just didn't change
[1:14:47] the senses so he didn't have to go back
[1:14:49] and re preach the message over again
[1:14:52] he ate it right yeah The Simpsons was
[1:14:55] always right
[1:14:57] so just read the sentence listen to what
[1:14:59] it is if he says stolen he starts
[1:15:01] talking about imagination remember you
[1:15:03] know what he's talking about
[1:15:05] thank you
[1:15:07] all right
[1:15:09] but see then us being what we are
[1:15:14] Body Spirit and soul
[1:15:18] and the real the person of you is the
[1:15:21] inner part
[1:15:24] the inner part of Youth the soul the
[1:15:27] center part
[1:15:28] of you is more real than your body and
[1:15:31] spirit all right amen right
[1:15:35] because that's the center part of you
[1:15:39] it's just like it was in the Old
[1:15:40] Testament when they had what the outer
[1:15:42] Court
[1:15:44] the inner Court
[1:15:46] but then they had the holy of holies
[1:15:49] which one do you want to live in
[1:15:52] if you want to live in the presence of
[1:15:54] God you wanted to go behind the veil
[1:15:55] right to the inner Veil the inner Court
[1:15:59] to the holy of holies
[1:16:03] because that's where God was at when she
[1:16:06] back there to show that that it wasn't
[1:16:08] in its right place to come forth
[1:16:11] to even be able to understand Body
[1:16:13] Spirit and souls
[1:16:15] I mean only the high priest could go
[1:16:17] behind her right
[1:16:20] but you know what I love about it
[1:16:23] until that was dedicated and set to the
[1:16:26] place
[1:16:27] now I watch this and I listened I never
[1:16:30] never hear preachers wanting to bring
[1:16:32] this out but until that was set in place
[1:16:36] until the dedication of the temple you
[1:16:39] know that Moses could walk behind her
[1:16:43] you know that Joshua could go behind her
[1:16:45] to make sure everything was made right
[1:16:49] you're a thought man
[1:16:51] somebody made it right behind her
[1:16:53] somebody built it the way it was
[1:16:55] supposed to be right somebody put them
[1:16:57] cherubims over the yard
[1:16:59] somebody put the Ark in there
[1:17:02] but once it was dedicated
[1:17:06] see the church listen what's it would
[1:17:09] come into being
[1:17:10] Lord Jesus Christ upon the Earth
[1:17:13] do we ever to be
[1:17:17] at
[1:17:19] that's right
[1:17:20] man it already gone
[1:17:23] all right
[1:17:26] but it couldn't happen in the Old
[1:17:29] Testament because once they dedicated
[1:17:30] that Moses couldn't go behind her right
[1:17:35] the only one could go there with the
[1:17:37] high preach
[1:17:39] and he had to be dedicated just right
[1:17:41] everything had to be perfect or he died
[1:17:43] right right
[1:17:44] and They Carried that around through the
[1:17:47] Wilderness for 400 years and nobody
[1:17:49] didn't know what was behind her except
[1:17:51] the high priest
[1:17:55] but I wonder how many sermons I don't
[1:17:56] know why freaks come out and preached
[1:17:58] after seeing what he's off
[1:18:00] he'd come out there trying to describe
[1:18:02] what was back there
[1:18:04] he said you ain't never seen nothing
[1:18:06] like it
[1:18:14] said you don't have to lie no no candles
[1:18:17] you don't have to have nothing
[1:18:20] there's this beautiful mind amen
[1:18:24] make sure we'll draw it out here and he
[1:18:26] draws it out and he puts the cherry bin
[1:18:28] and he puts the ark and he puts the the
[1:18:31] two tables of stone you know what Moses
[1:18:33] put in there and he drawing and
[1:18:34] everything else
[1:18:35] don't look too glorious to me all it is
[1:18:38] is a bunch of junk
[1:18:41] but to that high priest while he was in
[1:18:43] that presence
[1:18:46] yep he could prove that it wouldn't junk
[1:18:48] either
[1:18:51] you know what he got that nobody else
[1:18:53] didn't get
[1:18:56] ever knew high priest was dedicated
[1:19:00] got a chance to eat a piece of that
[1:19:02] manner
[1:19:05] that manner that was in the wilderness
[1:19:08] that everybody could eat but one day it
[1:19:10] stopped didn't it
[1:19:12] but you know what they took a bunch of
[1:19:14] it and put it in the
[1:19:17] the container They carried in behind
[1:19:19] there and Moses set it down and you know
[1:19:22] it never got old
[1:19:24] that I preached he could get a piece of
[1:19:26] that and he could come out he said but
[1:19:28] I've tasted it
[1:19:29] amen but to anybody else it's just no
[1:19:33] well I'm gonna just disturb me I don't
[1:19:34] know this way and I don't understand
[1:19:36] that because God told me not to make no
[1:19:37] images and there he is he told us to
[1:19:39] make them
[1:19:41] that's the way the carnality of human
[1:19:43] mind is right that's right
[1:19:46] but you see it's the outer Court the
[1:19:48] inner core the holy of holies
[1:19:50] which is the most important then right
[1:19:54] me
[1:19:56] a gentile was allowed into the outer
[1:19:59] sections of the outer court but you know
[1:20:01] that he couldn't go into the inner Court
[1:20:04] could only be one dedicated for the job
[1:20:06] then the high priest was the only one
[1:20:08] could go behind the veil
[1:20:10] see so which one is the most important
[1:20:12] the outer Court the inner court or the
[1:20:14] holy holies
[1:20:16] which one's the most important about you
[1:20:18] your body your spirit
[1:20:21] and run around even explain it he says
[1:20:23] you don't love your soul he said you
[1:20:25] love with your spirit
[1:20:30] because your soul is either lover
[1:20:32] for Satan it's either God or it's either
[1:20:34] Faith or doubt it's either one of the
[1:20:36] two right it's not no mixture in there
[1:20:39] right but now get the point now I'm
[1:20:40] getting slow so the real person
[1:20:44] you are is the inner being of you that
[1:20:48] is called a soul
[1:20:53] the real you the inner being is called a
[1:20:56] soul
[1:20:57] you say oh but brother Dale it's just
[1:20:59] the nature of some spirit
[1:21:01] see there's word and see what the
[1:21:03] devil's done with that
[1:21:05] he's blinded the eyes of the people
[1:21:07] until they can't see that's right oh it
[1:21:11] was just well the priest told me it was
[1:21:13] just it's just going to put it this will
[1:21:16] put you and that's what Darkness
[1:21:18] and they're blinded
[1:21:20] so it's the preachers of this message
[1:21:22] blinded the people died amen
[1:21:26] to the point that they just look at it
[1:21:28] and say what's yours no just the nature
[1:21:30] of experience it's just you know it's
[1:21:32] just some nature
[1:21:38] no it's the real you amen that's right
[1:21:40] we read and preached just a few weeks
[1:21:42] ago about what that in Ezekiel 18 4
[1:21:47] we read that All Souls are mine
[1:21:52] but did you remember what the likes of
[1:21:53] it said
[1:21:55] and he says it again in Ezekiel 18 20 it
[1:21:58] says in
[1:22:00] 1804 and he says it again in 1820 he
[1:22:03] said the soul that sent us
[1:22:05] and she'll die
[1:22:08] now the real part of you is your soul
[1:22:12] because that's what you are
[1:22:15] a being a person
[1:22:17] Bears the image of God
[1:22:20] more than your natural cause your body's
[1:22:22] in the image of the animals
[1:22:25] and that Soul inside of you is that in
[1:22:27] that image of that one that was behind
[1:22:29] the veil right see
[1:22:32] so the soul that sinneth it shall die it
[1:22:35] doesn't say in the Bible that the spirit
[1:22:37] that sentences shall die right
[1:22:42] he says the soul is sin
[1:22:46] and like I said it took brother Branham
[1:22:50] 30 something years
[1:22:52] for the opening of the word to get to
[1:22:54] him of Hebrews 44 12. that is the
[1:22:58] dividing of the Soul and Spirit and
[1:23:00] Joint Marinol right it took all of that
[1:23:02] time for it to get to the prophet that
[1:23:04] he would bring it and praise it in his
[1:23:06] life part of his years
[1:23:08] especially the lights say three part
[1:23:10] three years of his life he would explain
[1:23:12] it as body spirit and soul
[1:23:17] and it took him 30 something years to
[1:23:19] get to there to explain that
[1:23:21] well yeah we know all about it
[1:23:25] do we even know what a man is
[1:23:31] like I said what is death we go we look
[1:23:33] in this in the casket we say oh Lord
[1:23:35] look at them they're dead
[1:23:36] you're not looking at the person right
[1:23:39] you're looking at the body they used to
[1:23:40] inhabit right
[1:23:42] right man the person is done gone right
[1:23:45] and then
[1:23:47] what you see
[1:23:51] that's why in Revelations 20 and 6
[1:23:55] . and you got it into church ages and
[1:23:58] all like that we're just talking of what
[1:24:01] you won't be hurt by the second death
[1:24:05] now what is the second death
[1:24:08] right you'll have part in the first
[1:24:09] resurrection over which the second death
[1:24:11] right will have no part right amen what
[1:24:14] is the second death
[1:24:17] now your Prophet said on the message
[1:24:20] some earning Church age 1960 1206 that
[1:24:24] the second death is the death of the
[1:24:26] Soul see now the Earth even back before
[1:24:28] the opening but he knew what it was why
[1:24:31] because he knew what the scripture says
[1:24:32] redescript read the quote
[1:24:35] he would know when he said so he would
[1:24:38] know that it says the soul that sentence
[1:24:40] shall die
[1:24:42] I mean
[1:24:45] but do we understand
[1:24:47] thank you
[1:24:48] Jesus spoke of it in Matthew 10 and 28
[1:24:51] he said Don't Fear him that can destroy
[1:24:53] the body but said fear him that can
[1:24:55] destroy the soul and body amen listen
[1:25:00] he said in hell
[1:25:04] go read it
[1:25:06] then go over to Luke
[1:25:10] the 12th chapter verse 4 and 5 almost
[1:25:13] the same quote but he says he'll cast
[1:25:15] that Soul into hell in other words
[1:25:18] what is the second day of the death of
[1:25:20] the Soul
[1:25:21] what's going to be the last thing
[1:25:23] destroyed the real you
[1:25:25] now listen to what I'm saying
[1:25:28] your body
[1:25:30] is going to be in the ground right
[1:25:33] so that's not the real you that's
[1:25:34] already burned up
[1:25:36] rottened out and gone
[1:25:39] do you say well the Bible said the
[1:25:41] spirit goes back to God who gave it all
[1:25:43] right but be careful don't bring back an
[1:25:45] ungodly thing and join it back to God
[1:25:47] it's just a statement of showing what it
[1:25:50] does it's released from the body it's
[1:25:53] released it's gone if you can't take it
[1:25:55] back to God the one that really goes
[1:25:58] back to God who gave it is the new
[1:26:00] performing in your new birth in you
[1:26:02] because that's the change of the body
[1:26:04] and spirit because that's what we need
[1:26:06] we need a change of the spirit let alone
[1:26:08] a change of the body
[1:26:10] then it can go back to God who gave it
[1:26:13] amen all right
[1:26:16] see my real point then what
[1:26:18] is we need to understand
[1:26:21] the soul
[1:26:23] that's why the animal alive see
[1:26:26] it had no soul
[1:26:30] it could be used of God to cover our
[1:26:33] sins through the blood of the animal but
[1:26:35] it had no life within it that could come
[1:26:38] back upon the human being right go to
[1:26:41] the numbers
[1:26:43] right
[1:26:45] God permitted a man to be born because
[1:26:49] of the fall in a perverted world
[1:26:52] and he he gave him a a body you know
[1:26:56] allowed it to come and a spirit
[1:27:01] no soul
[1:27:04] the soul is the real deal right so the
[1:27:07] animal even though it can adapt
[1:27:10] it still can't reason things out
[1:27:15] I'm going to do now Michelle
[1:27:17] see the soul is what you are
[1:27:21] the real part of you is that soul that
[1:27:24] is created in the image of God
[1:27:27] now that's why it's got to be recreated
[1:27:29] in the new birth to bring about Genesis
[1:27:31] 1 26 and 27 into the right condition
[1:27:34] right because they're fitting back there
[1:27:36] we'll get to that later but just think
[1:27:38] about it look how we've advanced
[1:27:42] look how great the the soul of mankind
[1:27:45] is that even lead the animals he has
[1:27:48] control of those things
[1:27:50] but yet
[1:27:53] someone came to die
[1:27:56] right
[1:27:58] and he gave his own life as a ransom
[1:28:01] right right
[1:28:02] now this needs to talk about the River
[1:28:04] Jordan and all of it well then you've
[1:28:06] got to admit that brother Brown said the
[1:28:08] anointing left Jesus in the garden
[1:28:11] the anointing that came on in one of the
[1:28:13] River Jordan left him in the garden
[1:28:14] that's quote from your prophet
[1:28:17] so where's your new birth
[1:28:21] of course you're so spiritual you don't
[1:28:23] need one
[1:28:24] hmm
[1:28:25] you know all about the quotes that he
[1:28:27] always was eternal
[1:28:30] but then why did Jesus have to die then
[1:28:32] why wasn't it sufficient what left him
[1:28:34] in the garden to be able to come back
[1:28:36] upon us to give us understanding why
[1:28:39] would that not be your new birth
[1:28:42] but that anointing left him in the
[1:28:44] garden your Prophet said he said the
[1:28:45] spirit left him in the garden
[1:28:47] now you know if it would have been his
[1:28:49] Natural Spirit he'd been dead right
[1:28:51] there that's right so as your anointing
[1:28:53] came on him on the River Jordan left him
[1:28:59] but he cried out on the cross
[1:29:02] into thy hand I come in my spirit
[1:29:06] that Soul was ripped out of that body
[1:29:10] to play the prize because he'd take a
[1:29:13] soul to pay a price
[1:29:15] body to body is one thing spiritual
[1:29:18] spirit is another thing but that only
[1:29:19] deals with anointed ones spiritual
[1:29:21] Spirit but Soul or Soul we can become
[1:29:23] the very offspring of almighty God
[1:29:27] we could become the children of God Amen
[1:29:29] see he came to to bring man back to the
[1:29:32] place
[1:29:33] to restore Fellowship right
[1:29:36] he came to bring us to that place God
[1:29:39] wants to restore man to his rightful
[1:29:40] place and man in his rightful place is
[1:29:43] what
[1:29:44] Body Spirit and soul Farm after almighty
[1:29:47] God
[1:29:50] to understand then why it would be like
[1:29:52] it is but Iran says your brain is not
[1:29:54] your intelligence he said Satan in the
[1:29:57] garden took man's brain he said but God
[1:30:01] took man's heart what is the soul of man
[1:30:05] the heart of man not the thumping
[1:30:07] gizzard
[1:30:08] you know the thing that beats the blood
[1:30:10] the heart that's not your soul that's
[1:30:12] not your that's not the center of you
[1:30:14] the center of you is that light right
[1:30:18] that reality so the soul is the real you
[1:30:22] and thereby then if you do die
[1:30:26] now I'm just going to say this and leave
[1:30:28] it because it's the end of the message
[1:30:30] he said if you do die
[1:30:32] you got a place to go
[1:30:35] but it's one or two
[1:30:37] right
[1:30:40] you've got a Celestial body
[1:30:45] you say so that's real good that's going
[1:30:47] up and I'll brought around cover
[1:30:48] Celestial going down too yeah
[1:30:51] he says according to which one you're
[1:30:53] pulling from right if you're born again
[1:30:56] the pool is going upward he said if
[1:30:57] you're not it's going downward
[1:31:00] all right so you have a place to go to
[1:31:04] a center when he dies he has a place to
[1:31:06] go to if so goes where
[1:31:09] The Fifth Dimension
[1:31:12] right The Sinner did
[1:31:15] and waits there to be brought back into
[1:31:18] his Natural Body to stand it to judgment
[1:31:21] to be judged
[1:31:23] you see the born-again Christian
[1:31:25] he has an outward pool
[1:31:28] see so you see then if the new birth is
[1:31:30] just the anointing of the spirit
[1:31:33] look where it would put you
[1:31:36] the new birth is not just the anointing
[1:31:38] of the spirit all right it's the birth
[1:31:40] of the Soul
[1:31:42] you see eternal life
[1:31:44] through Jesus Christ
[1:31:46] amen so do you understand who you are
[1:31:48] what is man
[1:31:52] he's a body spirit so
[1:31:55] created in the image of his maker
[1:31:58] and even in the Fallen estate God
[1:32:00] thought so much of us to come down and
[1:32:01] died for us
[1:32:03] come over
[1:32:05] take on these things
[1:32:07] what is man
[1:32:12] he's controller of the Earth
[1:32:18] he traveled through space like it's not
[1:32:21] even thinning thing there
[1:32:24] and if you ever think about how
[1:32:26] technical all of this stuff is you know
[1:32:28] that before they ever sent one of those
[1:32:29] Rockets into space they had to calculate
[1:32:34] ever a moving element in his face that
[1:32:38] they could find
[1:32:39] and calculate where they would be when
[1:32:41] that rocket would get there because it
[1:32:43] didn't it was destroyed
[1:32:48] and in doing that you know what they
[1:32:50] found that there was in their calendar
[1:32:51] systems and all they found it was a day
[1:32:54] missing
[1:32:56] you read the story it was a day missing
[1:32:59] an older calendar system this one day
[1:33:02] off
[1:33:03] you know what they've done they went
[1:33:04] back to the Bible
[1:33:06] they said would anybody know any place
[1:33:08] you know anything we can find this day
[1:33:09] and this man said yes in the Bible and
[1:33:12] they read it
[1:33:14] yep said to Sean there and Joshua Stood
[1:33:17] Still
[1:33:17] but to catch what it said about today
[1:33:20] because you know what they done and
[1:33:22] don't ask me how they done it but
[1:33:23] they've done it because they could prove
[1:33:25] it they run it back and they said you're
[1:33:26] missing about 20 minutes right in your
[1:33:29] space of time right
[1:33:32] the man looked at it and he said well it
[1:33:34] does say about a day so then he went
[1:33:36] back over and he said well is there
[1:33:37] another he said yeah yes sir when the
[1:33:40] man would come up to the time that he
[1:33:41] was going to die you know yes and God
[1:33:44] told him no it'll be all right I'll give
[1:33:46] you 15 years you know he said well for
[1:33:49] it to go forward is easy but said turn
[1:33:52] it back to God he turned it back so many
[1:33:54] degrees and it was exactly the 20
[1:33:56] minutes
[1:33:57] that man could pull the Bible is right
[1:34:04] had to read the Bible to start with he
[1:34:07] wouldn't have no trouble wouldn't it
[1:34:08] right
[1:34:09] let's see what are what is man
[1:34:14] I look at these little children
[1:34:16] and I see him and I want you to be
[1:34:18] educated you know and go to school and
[1:34:21] to learn
[1:34:22] and I look at them and I see them you
[1:34:24] know if time lasted
[1:34:29] huh if time lasted
[1:34:32] our little coal would be maybe a
[1:34:36] jet airplane or back then it'd be
[1:34:38] Rockets you know Tommy gets up over in
[1:34:41] the
[1:34:42] might be a doctor or a scientist
[1:34:48] you know why
[1:34:49] because he's a student
[1:34:52] and being a soul
[1:34:55] he has thinking abilities
[1:35:00] he could reason out things
[1:35:02] yeah okay
[1:35:04] he could turn out to be whatever he
[1:35:08] wants to be
[1:35:13] you can beat what you want to
[1:35:15] we had a president but one time they
[1:35:17] couldn't read
[1:35:20] but you know he taught himself to read
[1:35:23] reading the Bible
[1:35:25] become president of the United States
[1:35:28] right
[1:35:29] to show how easy it was done
[1:35:33] and then we just had a man to come up to
[1:35:35] be president and you'd say oh you want
[1:35:37] to about him he's going to argue with
[1:35:38] nobody
[1:35:40] but you know we wound up with a man that
[1:35:42] is an African descent to be our
[1:35:45] president
[1:35:48] you say well now he's not he's from
[1:35:50] Hawaii but his natural descent that's
[1:35:52] come from somewhere over the heart you
[1:35:55] know they're still arguing about whether
[1:35:57] he is or not but that's no I'm just my
[1:35:59] point is you can be what you want to be
[1:36:05] you don't have to be a lazy shiftless
[1:36:07] bum
[1:36:10] I told him that Jamaica
[1:36:12] and it's hard to find a job there but I
[1:36:14] said you don't have to do it you can get
[1:36:15] out here and get you something
[1:36:18] well they didn't like it the pastor
[1:36:20] actor then he said man you really laid
