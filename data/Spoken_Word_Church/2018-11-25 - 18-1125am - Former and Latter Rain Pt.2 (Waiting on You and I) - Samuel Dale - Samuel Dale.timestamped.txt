[28:00] way we can have plenty of help that was
[28:03] the one thing I was at General Motors I
[28:05] was an absentee replacement well doing
[28:09] that see it's kind of hard to do a lot
[28:11] of time to be an absentee replace what
[28:13] we call Richard absentee around here
[28:15] because you know and I had to know 40
[28:18] something jobs you know to be able to go
[28:21] and run each one of those jobs because I
[28:24] was absentee for all of that and
[28:26] sometimes it was fun that we got by and
[28:30] I enjoyed it all right Joe 2:22 be not a
[28:37] Frazee beast of the field for the for
[28:41] the pastures of the wilderness do spring
[28:43] now listen says it's an upward now we
[28:46] should I'm trying to help us all to pull
[28:52] more into an upswing of things because
[28:56] we we need it you know and to look and
[28:59] see what is taking place among us in the
[29:03] land and now ought to be enough to know
[29:07] and realize that we're in the end and
[29:10] it's finishing up so this that's what we
[29:12] praise God for for the pastures of the
[29:15] wilderness new spring for the tree birth
[29:17] for fruit the fig tree and divine do
[29:20] yield their strength be glad then you
[29:24] children of Zion and rejoicing the Lord
[29:26] your God for he hath given you the
[29:28] former rain moderately and he will cause
[29:31] to come down for you the rain the former
[29:34] rain and the latter rain in the first
[29:37] month now what's in one month it's going
[29:39] to come all right so it's got to be a
[29:42] quick work and the floors shall be full
[29:44] of wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[29:47] one and all and I will restore to you
[29:49] the years that the locust has eaten the
[29:52] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[29:54] palm worm my great army which I sent
[29:57] among you he permitted it not he sinned
[30:00] it has to be destructive but he
[30:03] permitted it to come forth all right to
[30:06] be in this day and you shall eat him
[30:08] plenty and be sent
[30:09] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[30:12] that have dealt wonderfully with you my
[30:15] people shall never be ashamed and you
[30:18] shall know that I am in the midst of
[30:20] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[30:23] and none else and my people shall never
[30:28] be ashamed all right Hosea I told you
[30:33] it's in about six or eight times a
[30:36] former lot of rain in the scriptures but
[30:39] just picking out the ones that we you
[30:42] know want to read come and let us return
[30:46] unto the Lord for the for he has torn
[30:49] and he will heal us
[30:51] he has smitten and he will bind us up
[30:53] after two days he'll he revived us in
[30:57] the third days he after two thousand
[30:59] years we've done pice that two thousand
[31:01] year bracket so we're in the third day
[31:04] right all right so in the third day he
[31:09] will raise us up and we shall live in
[31:11] his side then shall we know if we follow
[31:14] on to know the Lord his going forth is
[31:17] prepared as the morning and he shall
[31:19] come unto us as the rain as the latter
[31:23] and former rain untrue the earth and
[31:27] then now remember the kids all practice
[31:31] today's that all kids practice at 12:50
[31:35] so remember that all right you may be
[31:37] seated while you're receiving all this
[31:39] turn to one more scripture that I want
[31:42] to read is in James in all this read it
[31:47] you don't have to turn there but he said
[31:49] be patient therefore brethren unto the
[31:51] coming of the Lord
[31:52] now once be patient unto the coming of
[31:56] the Lord behold the husbandman which is
[31:59] Almighty God right waited for the
[32:02] precious fruit of the earth and hath
[32:04] long patience for it until he received
[32:08] the early and latter right now is it for
[32:12] him or who is that he that's us that's
[32:16] us that's not he don't have to have rain
[32:19] he is the rain but we need the rain
[32:22] all right now I want to try to go real
[32:24] feist and if I get to face you slow me
[32:29] down a little but I want to hurry up and
[32:32] get something to you because I I've got
[32:35] about ten pages to just read okay not
[32:39] awful brother branham but parts or do it
[32:41] alright we're talking about what former
[32:44] and latter rain no in the natural you
[32:48] have that you have to have rain to our
[32:53] put rain or put water so when you plant
[32:56] your crop your your things you know
[32:59] tomatoes and and all like that
[33:01] especially find objects or different
[33:03] objects that has to be dug up planted
[33:06] but you put some waters are alright and
[33:09] that water is to make that plant boost
[33:13] forth alright you take a seed beans etc
[33:17] you put that in the ground it needs the
[33:21] moisture to quicken that seed to make it
[33:24] come alive alright so then we know that
[33:28] the rain is we'll read it in a minute is
[33:31] the Holy Spirit okay all right see then
[33:35] we need the rain upon the seed alright
[33:38] we covered it last Sunday there you know
[33:41] there the other day with the message
[33:43] cover and former and latter rain alright
[33:46] now I tried to emphasize to you heavily
[33:52] about the rain of what it is it's the
[33:55] Holy Spirit the you know I said some
[33:59] words are that you misunderstand me and
[34:02] all but I said like you know I said
[34:04] although this is the importance is not
[34:06] the rain now I went on to emphasize now
[34:08] I'm not talking about that you've got to
[34:11] have the seed first all right now water
[34:15] without the seed is no good seed without
[34:17] the waters no good all right so it's not
[34:20] making one greater the other it's
[34:22] emphasizing the point that it's very
[34:25] important which seed is planted because
[34:28] remember what we tried to cover that the
[34:32] the latter rain is going to produce
[34:34] whatever seed has been playing
[34:36] we'll read in a minute the Prophet said
[34:38] the Baptist has been planned to
[34:39] Methodist the Pentecostals etc are just
[34:42] going to produce that okay you say yeah
[34:44] but that's very deceiving for God to do
[34:46] that that's what he does he does it to
[34:48] see if you and I will be able to stay
[34:50] with the word all right get the message
[34:53] then anointed ones and study that we
[34:57] won't try to emphasize much other than
[34:59] the statement about it get the message
[35:01] or noted ones to where the rain falls on
[35:04] all all right it falls on the just and
[35:07] the unjust okay alright the same rain
[35:10] that makes your beam come up and grow
[35:12] will make the weeds come up and grow all
[35:15] right because if the the rain then is
[35:19] the moisture that we must have you know
[35:22] to the crops all right so then now here
[35:26] in the scripture of Hosea and it's
[35:29] talking about the restoration of the
[35:31] bride tree if you want to call it you
[35:34] know return of the years of the
[35:36] cankerworm pond warmed locust
[35:38] caterpillar and he says he'll send the
[35:40] FIR former rain he said he gave you
[35:42] former I'm moderately you know great in
[35:45] the form of rain all right then he says
[35:47] there as we read it that it would give
[35:49] you the former and latter rain in the
[35:53] same month well there's no no beans corn
[35:58] or anything that you can put a seed in
[36:00] the ground and and you know thirty days
[36:03] later you got corn or whatever it's
[36:06] emphasizing that something is going to
[36:08] happen all right now I want you to
[36:12] remember this part to keep in your mind
[36:16] brother Branham talks of like 200 and
[36:18] something quotes about former and latter
[36:21] rain alright now don't lose the point of
[36:25] interest to what we're trying to get see
[36:28] what's the point so that's what I'm
[36:30] aiming at all right he mentions former
[36:33] rain for Baptist latter rain former rain
[36:37] for the Pentecostal latter rain up and
[36:41] down all right coming throughout the
[36:43] message he's talking about he says we're
[36:45] having the latter right all right
[36:49] but then he finishes up in the spoken
[36:52] word his original Cedars will read in a
[36:54] minute he said you say you've had the
[36:56] latter end he says no that's that's not
[36:57] true he said cause the form of rain that
[36:59] come yet
[37:00] all right get the point the point is
[37:04] former rain is planting latter rain is
[37:10] harvest are gathering so no matter what
[37:13] you're talking about
[37:14] as will emphasize in a minute each
[37:17] church age had a former and latter rain
[37:22] it may be interesting if we can get to
[37:25] that part you know to express it all
[37:28] right let's see then
[37:30] don't don't that's what I'm saying when
[37:32] you're reading the message you're
[37:33] hearing the Prophet don't think he's
[37:35] only putting former and latter rain into
[37:38] the last days and you know that's knit
[37:41] down here but there's one thing this is
[37:44] very sure for this down here this is the
[37:47] age of the quick work quick word as the
[37:50] original says that word says he do a
[37:53] short work it means word he's going to
[37:56] pour in things Feist in the last day he
[38:00] spoke up in the church age book he said
[38:02] lady you'll see it would be a very short
[38:04] age all right now comparing to the other
[38:08] ages it is to be a very short age in
[38:10] time so God is going to do something
[38:14] here but don't misunderstand me when I
[38:17] bring and you'll see me come all the way
[38:19] up to here and then we get to laying on
[38:21] hard a former and latter rain in our day
[38:24] just remember that I've read and studied
[38:27] and I'll be glad to give you the quotes
[38:29] there laying on the table at the house
[38:31] of where brother Branham would be
[38:32] talking about former rain and he'd say
[38:36] we have had the latter right see there's
[38:41] a point that he was getting to it was
[38:44] right you know what when he said former
[38:48] rain and the Baptist former rain and the
[38:51] Methodists or whatever and he'd bring
[38:53] that out and he bring out two former
[38:54] rain in the Pentecostals and the latter
[38:57] rain he's right okay
[39:01] it's got to be place career
[39:03] li to be understood about it but what
[39:07] he's saying is right he doesn't come on
[39:09] later and say I was wrong back there
[39:11] about to rain
[39:12] no he gets the emphases of the point of
[39:17] the Pentecostals Worthen and I'm just
[39:20] laying this down in Rebecca the
[39:22] Pentecostals got into the move of God
[39:25] the gifts and the thing and they said
[39:27] they had to lie to rain all right now he
[39:31] says no he said you haven't had the
[39:34] former rain yet all right now what's
[39:36] he's got to be talking of a specific
[39:38] point or a thought all right so you got
[39:42] to get to the message to where this age
[39:44] has the the split condition I want to
[39:47] bring back the faith of the father all
[39:50] right then to go on and to front the
[39:53] prophets message to carry it on so watch
[39:55] that now and don't get lost and took
[39:58] what brother Dale don't understand
[39:59] because it's I don't where he's yeah
[40:02] brother Branham will call the babies
[40:05] having a lot of rain called any move of
[40:08] God is the Holy Spirit moving among
[40:14] those people and we'll get to it in a
[40:16] minute DC age did have a former and the
[40:20] latter rain never aged had it all right
[40:25] but then this age is going to pour in to
[40:28] cause it's gonna have to be returned to
[40:30] the faith of the Father's right 327
[40:34] Church age book messenger new to thing
[40:36] and then it'll have to not only turn
[40:39] back to the hearts of father but he'll
[40:40] bring his message which is the revealing
[40:42] of the entire Word of God
[40:44] all right now because we know that it
[40:48] it's okay let's get to the point James
[40:53] says that the husbandman waiteth
[40:56] patiently in other words God has been
[40:59] patient with you and I waiting on us to
[41:02] come in the last days to understand okay
[41:05] all right now watch the former message
[41:09] because the former rain the teaching
[41:15] rain
[41:17] remember you're talking about rain but
[41:20] you're talking about the Holy Spirit the
[41:24] Holy Spirit is the rain that you're
[41:26] talking about the move of God among us
[41:30] okay now we'll start and we'll read just
[41:32] a little while and then I'll drop back
[41:34] and try to finish the message by
[41:36] preaching it okay so go ahead and pull
[41:38] number one brothers and we'll get
[41:40] started cause I want to read some and
[41:42] then I want to drop back and get the
[41:45] message in and drive it hard to where we
[41:48] can see okay after the message anointed
[41:50] wanted to end time he said therefore the
[41:54] rain dropping down upon the natural
[41:56] vegetation of the earth is the top of
[41:58] the spiritual rain which gives eternal
[42:00] life dropping down upon the church for
[42:03] we call it the former rain and the
[42:06] latter rain and it's a rain all right
[42:09] pouring out of God's Spirit upon his
[42:12] church
[42:13] what is the rain now remember former
[42:16] rain and latter rain is the same rain
[42:19] it's the same water it's just the
[42:22] position you're putting it in one of
[42:25] them is to start it the other one is to
[42:28] make it come to a harvest all right but
[42:31] it's the same rain okay now remember
[42:34] this as we'll try to get to it in a
[42:36] minute remember the rain doesn't change
[42:39] the seed that's why I emphasizing that
[42:45] message so much about the seed see the
[42:48] seed is the same that's why when the
[42:50] rain falls it's going to produce Baptist
[42:54] Methodist Presbyterian or Oliver
[42:57] randomizer it's going to produce it
[42:59] because the rain is what makes the crop
[43:02] cometh but remember you didn't plant all
[43:05] them weeds right but you got them all
[43:11] right and they'll be there so remember
[43:14] but remember the one thing now the water
[43:16] you pour own to the to the beam you put
[43:19] in the ground don't change it to a
[43:21] cocklebur it produces a beam but the
[43:26] cocklebur doesn't change and produce
[43:29] beans there's a cocklebur
[43:31] all right see whatever the seed you have
[43:33] and see why it's so important for us to
[43:39] follow the message to get it in the
[43:42] correct order one God to water baptism
[43:44] no eternal hell to the seals the thing
[43:46] all to have it perfectly laid down in
[43:50] order to were that we can see what God
[43:53] is going to quicken those he's going to
[43:56] quicken that he has planted all right
[43:59] now remember he didn't he didn't plant
[44:01] all the seed remember there's two seeds
[44:04] there one of them is the son of man
[44:08] stored in the seed but the other is the
[44:10] devil showing his seed all right but
[44:13] remember the same rain that makes the
[44:15] the week come up is the same rain that
[44:19] makes that disel or whatever you call it
[44:23] or different thing it'll make it come up
[44:25] - matter of fact it'll come up quicker
[44:26] all right yeah but then see what are we
[44:30] looking at what is the former rain in
[44:32] the latter Ryan it's a pouring out of
[44:35] God's Spirit for what it's doing okay
[44:38] and it's making manifest whatever seeds
[44:42] you plant so now this emphasize this in
[44:46] your thoughts hold this point in your
[44:48] mind that you're going to hopefully see
[44:52] today why things are so said by the
[44:54] Prophet a certain way to work that it
[44:58] will blind those who cannot understand
[45:03] now I say the Holy Spirit had him to say
[45:06] those things you know not that he
[45:08] planned to say them all right but it was
[45:11] just sit in a certain way God like I
[45:13] said you say former and latter rain well
[45:16] I know where he quoted here I've got
[45:18] these quotes here were former latter on
[45:20] with baton 54 well praise God that's
[45:23] right that's right the former rain and
[45:29] latter rain was in the days of Martin
[45:32] Luther John Wesley it was any church age
[45:37] it was all the way back forming latter
[45:39] rain would always back into the Old
[45:41] Testament
[45:44] watch that now as we get to it a minute
[45:47] but I want to read this part where you
[45:48] we're going to stay on your mind go to
[45:50] spoken word number two our excuse me
[45:53] number one that would one a go to number
[45:55] one which is spoken word as original
[45:57] seed 62 318 I believe it's near the
[46:03] harvest time the seeds been planted
[46:07] denominational seed of the churches now
[46:11] remember this I try to tell you
[46:13] something to help you remember this is
[46:18] 62 he's talking about the rain he's
[46:22] going to talk about the former in letter
[46:24] right and then he's gonna turn around
[46:25] and say you haven't had the latter rain
[46:34] okay he said because you haven't had the
[46:38] former that's what I said it in our
[46:44] minds we can get it so confused don't
[46:47] try to figure it out just listen like I
[46:50] said you say well brother Dale I've got
[46:52] a lot of quotes here we run around
[46:53] talking about former inliner right amen
[46:56] I just stated words me every church age
[47:00] has former lighter rain but then it's
[47:04] got to come to a short quick work in the
[47:06] last days okay now the seats been
[47:09] planted denominational seeds of the
[47:11] churches such as evangelist like
[47:13] Baptists and Presbyterians and Lutheran
[47:15] and the Pentecostal seeds been planted
[47:18] into the Pentecostal organization by
[47:20] great men like Oral Roberts Thomas heat
[47:22] Tommy Hicks
[47:23] Tommy Osburn great meaning of Godsey and
[47:27] I believe the Word of God has been
[47:30] planted unadulterated away from any of
[47:33] those organization sixty-two then he
[47:38] gets in the same message and says
[47:40] Malachi 4 ain't come here so he's
[47:42] talking about the Bible as far as man
[47:44] knew before you coming into the prophets
[47:48] message I've preached that I hope and at
[47:51] least lay in your mind enough to think
[47:54] alright look now watch what he said
[47:57] what's the matter the seed must have the
[48:01] seed plant must house seed water before
[48:04] it can grow they must have water to fall
[48:06] before the seed that's been planted can
[48:09] grow now will you say brother branham
[48:12] there's been hour I know that's right
[48:15] catching your thought now and you see
[48:18] you just can't hide it they all right so
[48:21] be careful what you're thinking what
[48:24] were they thinking brother branham we're
[48:26] in the latter rain because that was the
[48:29] pentecostal move the idea we're in the
[48:32] latter rain he said okay you've had rain
[48:38] that's what he just said but watch him
[48:42] now he's picking up the thoughts of the
[48:43] people of what they're saying and the
[48:45] Pentecostals you Pentecostals know a
[48:47] number you come up through four you come
[48:49] up through latter rain but I run said
[48:52] they had all kind of range all right
[48:55] and see he thought that that and I'll
[48:57] read where brother Brennan said people
[48:59] thought that was the finishing up he
[49:02] said when it wasn't said the former
[49:04] hadn't even come well not so listen now
[49:09] the seed must be planted then it must
[49:11] have water in order to grow now you said
[49:13] well brother branham I'm going to
[49:15] express your thought thought dark we've
[49:19] had the water so be it that's correct
[49:25] you have had the water then he turned
[49:31] around says you ain't had to lie to rain
[49:36] what he's telling them that's right
[49:38] we'll get to that in a minute what
[49:40] produced in the days of 1906 the baptism
[49:49] of the Holy Ghost right
[49:53] and once you plant cabbage or anything
[49:56] the seeds or something nothing like that
[49:58] usually you got a water tower just pour
[50:00] a little on them see all right but now
[50:02] wait what did we have in that planting
[50:05] time the former rain oh you say brother
[50:08] branham nonsense
[50:11] in other words we've had the latter on
[50:15] you're talking about former Ryan that's
[50:17] why they couldn't understand him he was
[50:19] standing there telling them that their
[50:21] reign that they had was not what they
[50:24] thought it was right it was not the
[50:29] quickening to the going away they
[50:33] thought it was that's your Pentecostal
[50:36] people they still think that said then
[50:39] wait a minute you take the word former
[50:41] in Joel and look at it and see if the
[50:43] Hebrew word you go to the Hebrew and see
[50:45] if it know if you want to write it down
[50:47] he said mo you are eh Mora and get the
[50:51] Hebrew word interpret see what Mora
[50:53] means teaching the teaching rain has
[50:57] went forth the denominational teaching
[51:00] rain has went forth a million more than
[51:03] 44 Baptists so-and-so so-and-so members
[51:06] in the church Roy Roberts them brothers
[51:09] with the Pentecostal move the the
[51:11] economy you can never have said that
[51:14] word the great Pentecostal move they
[51:16] moved up until the millions that's right
[51:20] and the seed has went forth the word for
[51:24] the minority the group who's he told man
[51:27] himself
[51:28] this restoring of the faith of the
[51:30] fathers had been preached in 62 by the
[51:33] Prophet and remember the word Mora Mora
[51:36] means teaching the former ein that says
[51:38] that more rain the teaching run teaching
[51:41] rain went forward Billy Graham has
[51:43] struck the world the Pentecostal struck
[51:45] the world and the word has struck the
[51:47] world he had come in there and wedging
[51:53] in that faith of the father's he knew
[51:55] exactly where he was at what's the
[51:57] matter now it's now waiting for the
[51:59] letter right that's what you produces a
[52:02] fruit oh well I hope you get here then
[52:05] the kind of seeds you have planted in
[52:07] your field will be the kind of crop
[52:09] you'll reap if it's a denomination wants
[52:13] more members that's what they're going
[52:15] to get that's what they have they
[52:19] remember they've gotten the Pentecostal
[52:21] move ever what I say a nice message
[52:26] it's going to produce you say Lateran
[52:30] run run said the latter rain will cover
[52:34] the earth it's not just latter rain for
[52:42] the bride only there's never been any
[52:45] thought that like that by the Prophet
[52:47] he's always brought you for my lighter
[52:49] rain form a lot of rain I mean when you
[52:52] get a form of rain remember there's
[52:53] going to be a ladder rain to follow that
[52:57] cuz why would you want to put a form of
[52:58] rain if you didn't do it
[53:00] all right they're gonna get what they've
[53:02] gotten the pentecostal wants more
[53:03] pentecostals that's what they're going
[53:05] to get right but the word is going to
[53:08] produce sons and daughters of God right
[53:11] now where's that supposed to be coming
[53:15] in a minute you put it down all right
[53:17] now listen go ahead to the next one
[53:24] someone asked him about the word you
[53:26] know former Ryan and all former and
[53:28] latter the word former is the Hebrew
[53:30] word Morra more which means teaching in
[53:33] other words it'll be a teaching rain and
[53:35] a harvest right now we've had the
[53:38] teaching rain and we're ready now for
[53:40] the harvest rain you know the first rain
[53:44] is when you plant the seed that starts
[53:47] your crop growing then just before it
[53:49] matures there comes another crop that's
[53:52] what is called now remember it'll be a
[53:55] teaching rain and a harvest rain we've
[53:58] had we've had the heart would excuse me
[54:01] we've had the teaching rain and we're
[54:05] ready for the harvest rain then God
[54:10] corrects the man in his message and says
[54:12] that of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled
[54:14] in other words you haven't preached your
[54:17] message yet but see they were saying the
[54:21] Pentecostals even under brother Branham
[54:23] trying to bring the message that he was
[54:25] they were saying that they had to lie to
[54:27] Ryan he said no he said you haven't had
[54:32] a letter Ryan yet he say you know we've
[54:37] had a teaching run
[54:38] his message ain't even come into being
[54:40] yet but he's right he had to do the
[54:45] works all right come on let's see uh we
[54:49] found out it over all right let me just
[54:54] drop them to preach a little cause I've
[54:56] got a bunch of quotes there's one I wore
[54:58] especially though he said we've had the
[55:06] teaching rain that around go we'd better
[55:11] get number three well number three they
[55:14] resume with the church ages and he said
[55:17] this church agent started right after
[55:19] the turn of the century and it was any
[55:20] ages in which the true church would
[55:22] return to being the bride she was at
[55:24] penny calls now we believe that or not
[55:27] but that's what he said is going to take
[55:28] place we know that there must be
[55:31] necessity to be a return of the dynamic
[55:33] power the believer since this in their
[55:37] spirit and begin crying to God for a new
[55:39] outpouring such as was in the first
[55:41] century what seemed to be the answer
[55:44] came as many began to speak in tongues
[55:46] and manifest gifts of the Spirit
[55:48] it was then believed that this was
[55:50] indeed the long-awaited restoration or
[55:54] Lateran at once it was not for the
[55:59] latter rain can come only after the
[56:03] former rain which is the spring our
[56:05] teaching rain the latter rain then is
[56:08] the harvest rain how could this be the
[56:10] real thing when the teaching rain had
[56:12] not come they said just a little bit for
[56:16] then we've done happier teaching right I
[56:22] mean they don't hit with you you don't
[56:25] read and listen you know read to try to
[56:31] get understanding
[56:34] right you've got to read it over and
[56:37] over why would a prophet Lee telling
[56:39] those Pentecostal people you've had rain
[56:42] you had water you had teaching tonight
[56:44] which said you haven't had the latter
[56:47] rain
[56:52] come on look what he's saying see
[56:56] they're saying right here in this period
[56:58] gap of time they say don't had ever he
[57:01] said
[57:01] the former which is the spring right the
[57:04] latter rain then is the harvest how
[57:06] could this be real the real thing when
[57:08] the teaching rain had not come the
[57:11] Prophet messenger who was to be sent to
[57:15] teach the people turn the hearts of the
[57:17] children back to the faith of the
[57:19] fathers had not yet come they trying to
[57:25] tell those Pentecostal people you've had
[57:27] to move of God the works of God is among
[57:29] you the gifts is among you but yet
[57:32] you're saying latter right he said no he
[57:38] said you haven't even heard the farmer
[57:42] come on that's what was thought to be
[57:45] the restoration and the finala
[57:47] quickening unto the rapture had not come
[57:52] see they thought they've come the
[57:54] pinnacles this is it we're ready to go
[57:57] kind of reminds me of a lot of people in
[58:01] seventy two three and four that some of
[58:04] you older ones can remember when oh yes
[58:07] I told a dream that I'd have a little
[58:10] girl that would be about this tall and I
[58:14] told it in about nineteen seven then
[58:15] they said well you're gonna miss it
[58:17] cause rapture is coming in 73 okay I
[58:22] just tell the dream as a dream you know
[58:24] what I got the little girl she's a
[58:26] little bit bigger than that now but
[58:27] that's a little girl all right but you
[58:30] see the Pentecostals thought it was over
[58:33] that they had it all that's why you see
[58:36] it among the ministers of this message
[58:38] they don't want what brother Branham
[58:40] said they still want to move the goings
[58:45] the great things of great anointings I
[58:50] don't make light but they say well he
[58:53] was anointed look at him his shirt is
[58:55] wet you know thinking those are the
[58:59] things no the Pentecostals had you
[59:03] because they
[59:04] they wouldn't even wear short sleeves
[59:05] and they stayed wet but listen Church
[59:09] what are we doing this message is
[59:13] supposed to be the thing and that's what
[59:16] I'm trying to show you right in one
[59:18] message read it I've asked you to read
[59:20] spoken words of reason don't see how
[59:23] many of yous ready don't in a few hands
[59:27] ninety-eight percent didn't raise their
[59:29] hand okay listen
[59:33] and the spoken word original seat
[59:36] brother branham brought his message and
[59:40] he preached the pure unadulterated word
[59:42] in the city that struck the world but
[59:47] then something happened and he said
[59:50] something's wrong God told him to go
[59:53] back he rewrote it brought it back down
[59:55] and God told him you can read it right
[59:57] outspoken original seated in them and
[59:59] the church age will brought him right
[1:00:01] back to his message right to the same
[1:00:02] place and when he got to that place he
[1:00:04] said what am I gonna do Lord he said as
[1:00:07] of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled
[1:00:10] that's 1962 we thought Malachi 4
[1:00:13] fulfilled in the fifties sixties one not
[1:00:16] he said it was what are we going to
[1:00:22] believe him our our our own ideas listen
[1:00:27] look what brethren said about Azusa
[1:00:30] Street that's what was thought to be the
[1:00:34] restoration and to finally quickening
[1:00:37] unto the rapture had not come in it was
[1:00:41] a mixture what is this the street of the
[1:00:44] unrighteous for taking of spiritual
[1:00:46] blessing and manifesting in the Holy
[1:00:47] Ghost as we have kept pointing out to
[1:00:49] you in it also was devil power as men
[1:00:54] were under the control of the devil yet
[1:00:57] no one seemed to realize it then to
[1:01:03] prove that it was not the real these
[1:01:05] people even before the second generation
[1:01:07] had appeared organized and wrote their
[1:01:09] own scriptural doctrines and built their
[1:01:12] own fences as ever other group ahead of
[1:01:14] them done now you tell me that ain't
[1:01:16] happening to people this message
[1:01:17] I want to give you about an hour message
[1:01:21] on it okay you think it all already
[1:01:24] happened that they've done the sign
[1:01:26] thing in this message unscriptural yeah
[1:01:34] go ahead to number four better read
[1:01:38] these if I don't get all arrested like
[1:01:41] spoken word to regional city and what
[1:01:46] we're trying to do they're trying to
[1:01:49] manufacture a lot of rain nonsense
[1:01:58] they said nonsense on that quote while
[1:02:00] ago about him he's saying nonsense back
[1:02:02] right while the latter rain will sweep
[1:02:06] the world the latter rain was weak the
[1:02:15] world I'm better Dale I thought you said
[1:02:18] the other day that you believed in a
[1:02:20] revival coming but there was not going
[1:02:25] to be a world wide sweeping revival they
[1:02:27] won't be but the latter rain will sweep
[1:02:31] the world they will sweep the world now
[1:02:37] that's what he's saying so go ahead
[1:02:40] rather been a former rain sawing words
[1:02:43] that's right now you see what the latter
[1:02:45] rain producer now you'll see what you
[1:02:48] find out darl be an affiliation the
[1:02:51] Pentecostals and all the groups will
[1:02:53] come together and they'll shut the doors
[1:02:55] on them guys that won't listen to you it
[1:02:58] won't even be allowed to open your mouth
[1:03:01] right that's when he'll come that's when
[1:03:07] he'll show that's when you will see a
[1:03:09] rain oh my they still be quiet yeah he's
[1:03:16] not coming until the pressure comes yet
[1:03:21] we've got all this he's there he's there
[1:03:23] is he come in 63 and he was here and
[1:03:25] he's done this and he's got all of those
[1:03:27] things
[1:03:31] he said the Lord's gonna come when they
[1:03:34] start closing our doors well we've been
[1:03:39] a long time and ain't closed them yet
[1:03:43] don't you worry about it they're getting
[1:03:45] everything ready and then it'll fall I
[1:03:51] tried my best to tell you years ago what
[1:03:54] there's gonna take place experienced it
[1:03:57] and seen it when they broke in this
[1:03:58] front door up here the old door came in
[1:04:04] and when the little brother come in sit
[1:04:08] down here with us and fellowship with us
[1:04:10] for a few months and you talking about a
[1:04:13] spiritual crying weeping man every
[1:04:18] service he was in the altars crying and
[1:04:20] crying and screaming out to God I walked
[1:04:24] up to him one day I said brother I said
[1:04:27] something's telling me that you're a
[1:04:30] government agent that has come in here
[1:04:32] to check us out he just froze stiff he
[1:04:37] never blinked he never moved I said just
[1:04:40] do a good job I said don't tell no lies
[1:04:43] on us I said report it like it is tell
[1:04:46] it like it is
[1:04:47] and I said I'm telling you I won't tell
[1:04:49] nobody for awhile he come on the church
[1:04:54] for a few weeks then he left he went
[1:04:56] down to Church in Atlanta going on down
[1:04:58] in that away I never told my wife for
[1:05:01] three months I was embarrassed to tell
[1:05:04] anybody I'm illustrating you know how
[1:05:08] wonderful sweet blessing brother Tatum
[1:05:10] was that I mean you could just say Jesus
[1:05:12] and he descried and just worshiping her
[1:05:15] that man had him beat ten to one he
[1:05:18] stayed in the older more and he did
[1:05:20] anything else but yet something told me
[1:05:23] I went told him now I told you there the
[1:05:29] other day something that the Lord had
[1:05:30] showed me was you listening they ain't
[1:05:34] putting signs on these churches anymore
[1:05:35] that says this is a Baptist Church
[1:05:37] they're putting some kind of a shallow
[1:05:40] or this that or the other
[1:05:44] they're putting some kind of a name on
[1:05:45] them they're not they're taking down
[1:05:47] their Baptist names they'll take it down
[1:05:49] their methodist name they're putting up
[1:05:51] these all kind of names worship center
[1:05:59] but right here what are you looking for
[1:06:09] go ahead number five stealing smoking
[1:06:12] words regional seed this is in the
[1:06:15] evening service look God has promised be
[1:06:20] careful God has promised from Ellicott
[1:06:21] for for this life stays and melikhaya
[1:06:24] for has not yet has been fulfilled
[1:06:29] does that been fulfilled that's what God
[1:06:32] told him get the message read the book
[1:06:37] and then when the Prophet puts it they
[1:06:40] put it in there what the Lord told him
[1:06:42] to rewrite Lord told him a Malachi four
[1:06:44] hadn't been fulfilled he thought it had
[1:06:47] he thought he'd preach the seals he did
[1:06:50] in 57 or somewhere long didn't re preach
[1:06:52] the under seal he thought all that was
[1:06:54] done that's why I was telling them
[1:06:56] brothers but then when this message came
[1:06:59] it brought him alive that's why I said
[1:07:06] to you the prophets message beginning
[1:07:08] some wording to save 62s and lasted for
[1:07:11] three and a half years listen and
[1:07:13] Malachi for has not yet has been
[1:07:16] fulfilled but it must be fulfilled first
[1:07:18] the drummer Ty's work spoken through
[1:07:20] Malachi the prophet Jesus referred to it
[1:07:23] to be just before their coming across a
[1:07:25] second time
[1:07:26] and then it comes to the scriptures of
[1:07:28] the Gentile dispensation is to be
[1:07:30] finished with the church age when this
[1:07:32] anointed messenger arrives of course he
[1:07:35] will plant the seed of the entire Bible
[1:07:39] what's how perfect that man's
[1:07:43] understanding was read that next
[1:07:51] statement
[1:07:58] the Gentile dispensation is to be
[1:08:00] finished with the church age when this
[1:08:04] anointed messenger arrived of course
[1:08:06] he'll plant the seed of the entire Bible
[1:08:08] what's he plumb from the serpent that's
[1:08:13] Genesis right to the messenger in the
[1:08:17] former rain looks like he would have
[1:08:23] said latter rain of cause at that time
[1:08:28] the Adam sold the former so it's going
[1:08:35] to come this man that's come on the
[1:08:37] scene is going to what bring us the word
[1:08:40] plant the entire Bible from the serpent
[1:08:43] to the messenger in the former rain
[1:08:46] What did he say into our Bible and say
[1:08:49] it like that it looks like it's going to
[1:08:50] be an addition those seals were not an
[1:08:53] added thing to the Bible but it was a no
[1:08:55] man know anything about it long church
[1:09:02] then he'll be rejected by denominational
[1:09:05] people that's just for fun it's on the
[1:09:07] larger word what about it
[1:09:17] go ahead let's see when I roll up back
[1:09:20] down cuz we're missing part maybe a
[1:09:23] little bit yeah this is it Melek i3
[1:09:28] planted a former rain and was rejected
[1:09:32] by the churches the denomination the
[1:09:34] fire season of Sadducees and his day
[1:09:36] Melek aah tree planted a former right
[1:09:39] watch that in a minute as we pick it up
[1:09:43] the Pharisees know Jesus came who
[1:09:48] introduced Jesus Malachi 4 but Malachi 3
[1:09:53] had planted a former rain and was
[1:09:57] rejected by the churches well he gets
[1:09:59] missed they should have been Malachi for
[1:10:01] that you go do what you want to ain't
[1:10:05] listening to you Jesus came and had to
[1:10:08] mount Transfiguration showdown this
[1:10:13] forerunner of the last day who's he
[1:10:16] Malachi 4 will so for the former rain
[1:10:25] he's exactly writing a statement of here
[1:10:27] to the messenger to former right
[1:10:30] Jesus will be the showdown between
[1:10:33] denominations increase which is his word
[1:10:36] when he comes a showdown the rapture of
[1:10:40] his bride we're not gonna go out her
[1:10:43] fight on a work less Carter I can just
[1:10:45] see that Battle of Armageddon we just
[1:10:48] listen the rapture is gonna prove what's
[1:10:52] right listen the first was Mount Carmel
[1:10:55] Elijah Mount Carmel the second was Mount
[1:11:01] Transfiguration Jesus in Matthew 17
[1:11:04] transfigured look and the third will be
[1:11:07] Mount Zion rapture now Zion rapture okay
[1:11:16] now
[1:11:19] now hang on a minute with him go ahead
[1:11:20] and clear that off because we ain't
[1:11:23] gonna be using the board for a little
[1:11:24] bit I want you to think about former and
[1:11:28] latter rain Iowa straighted it the life
[1:11:32] service and I'll illustrate the good bit
[1:11:34] now that former rain is teaching rain
[1:11:37] the right ladder rain is more like
[1:11:40] harvest rain or gathering rain or
[1:11:43] whatever and you see you you put your
[1:11:46] water on to get it to plant to multiply
[1:11:49] you know i'll reproduce and start it
[1:11:51] grow then you need rain all the way
[1:11:53] through but then when you come to the
[1:11:55] lice you need a good rain right if they
[1:11:57] the older ones is here you say well I
[1:11:59] thank God for that in Chennai for rain
[1:12:01] we got like not that'll be enough make
[1:12:03] my garden produce you know because you
[1:12:06] know you having the life rain you're
[1:12:08] gonna get because it's going to start
[1:12:11] drying up all right now but the
[1:12:16] outpouring of the Spirit of God is that
[1:12:18] rain whether it be former rain Lateran
[1:12:22] whether it be Cornerstone faith or a
[1:12:26] headstone it's the same door Jesus
[1:12:29] Christ the rain is the same it's just
[1:12:33] according to whatever is to produce okay
[1:12:38] now if I can read my own notes so listen
[1:12:46] very carefully as we start something and
[1:12:50] watch now listen I'm trying to instruct
[1:12:53] you all right watch each thing be the
[1:12:57] same when we get it and especially the
[1:13:00] ages you'll see what happened in the
[1:13:01] first age happens in the sixth and
[1:13:03] eighth happens in the third age happens
[1:13:06] in the fourth age happens in the fifth
[1:13:07] age happens in the sixth age and then
[1:13:10] something special happens in the seventh
[1:13:11] so just remember that and listen so I
[1:13:15] just wrote down this point there's
[1:13:18] always to be in scriptural matters
[1:13:25] a former on a ladder Ryan because if God
[1:13:29] ever brings a form of rain he was going
[1:13:30] he is going to bring the ladder right
[1:13:32] that's a promise because he won't leave
[1:13:35] it said my word won't return unto me boy
[1:13:37] all right now each time God moves
[1:13:42] they'll get this thought each time God
[1:13:46] moves it'll be a former and a ladder a
[1:13:50] former and a lighter every time he moves
[1:13:54] will be that so get that thought in your
[1:13:57] mind
[1:13:58] I wrote down do you understand remember
[1:14:01] the form of rain is the pouring out of
[1:14:04] the out of God up on the church to bring
[1:14:09] the church and start it latter rain will
[1:14:12] be a harvest rain or quickening to the
[1:14:14] rapture so let's back up there was a man
[1:14:18] came on the scene back there one time
[1:14:21] the Old Testament was coming to an end
[1:14:24] and there's that Old Testament was
[1:14:27] coming to an end you can go by
[1:14:28] performing a lot of running back through
[1:14:30] all of that but we're just picking up at
[1:14:32] that point as the Old Testament was
[1:14:34] coming to an end and the New Testament
[1:14:36] coming into being what took place
[1:14:39] it wasn't Jesus just stepping out there
[1:14:42] and I'm definitely know he had to have
[1:14:44] an introducer he had to have someone to
[1:14:48] forerun him John the Baptist forerun the
[1:14:52] coming of the Lord Jesus and proclaimed
[1:14:56] and said behold the lamb of God john
[1:14:59] 1:29 or 2080 Rodina behold the lamb of
[1:15:02] God that takes away the sin of the world
[1:15:04] he introduced the Messiah
[1:15:07] now listen his message was to introduce
[1:15:12] the Messiah
[1:15:15] okay he priest a former rain are you
[1:15:19] listening
[1:15:20] if you sleepy wake up don't try to write
[1:15:23] too much today either cuz you're gonna
[1:15:24] get behind all right you'll get to tape
[1:15:28] and replay it and I ask you but you're
[1:15:32] not gonna do it so then you're gonna
[1:15:34] lose and then you're gonna say I said
[1:15:35] something I didn't say and then when you
[1:15:37] do we're gonna get
[1:15:38] bleh and I'm gonna say it's been said I
[1:15:41] said so in tone I didn't say it here's
[1:15:42] the tape we're gonna play it because
[1:15:44] I've tried to drive to get you to listen
[1:15:47] so at least if you listen it work
[1:15:50] alright John's message was to introduce
[1:15:55] the Messiah it was more than just
[1:15:57] introduced the Messiah
[1:15:58] it was to turn the Old Testament away
[1:16:04] from that Old Testament form and
[1:16:05] pointing it toward the New Testament now
[1:16:08] are you listening toward the New
[1:16:11] Testament that message that John was a
[1:16:13] former rain
[1:16:15] behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:16:17] the sin of the world was the former rain
[1:16:21] he was to bringing in brethren city was
[1:16:24] a keystone standing between the old and
[1:16:26] new Testament all right now going on to
[1:16:29] Jesus Christ so don't misunderstand see
[1:16:33] he introduced Jesus Christ then Jesus
[1:16:37] Christ was the latter rain - what John
[1:16:40] had preached are the production of the
[1:16:45] seed that John had planted and produced
[1:16:48] are you in me the Lord Jesus when John
[1:16:52] said to behold the lamb of God there he
[1:16:55] stood what God alive in human flesh the
[1:16:59] Living Word was standing upon the earth
[1:17:02] there's your latter rain it was ready to
[1:17:06] be harvested
[1:17:07] but there was so much more to be left
[1:17:09] that wasn't finished
[1:17:12] alright see then Jesus and I try to
[1:17:16] hurry it up and I'm trying to figure
[1:17:17] that feistner see then Jesus turned
[1:17:20] around and he preached the message he
[1:17:24] had a former Ryan a teaching rain priest
[1:17:27] his whole message for three and a half
[1:17:29] years with the disciples the disciples
[1:17:34] heard that word and believed it went to
[1:17:37] Pentecost and Pentecost quickened that
[1:17:42] word they see the answer to John's
[1:17:45] message wasn't coming for the Lord's
[1:17:47] either the answer to Jesus's message was
[1:17:50] they people that would come forth to be
[1:17:52] the
[1:17:52] body of Jesus Christ see then John's
[1:17:56] message was what produced the Lord Jesus
[1:18:00] see the former rain produced the ladder
[1:18:03] you get the former you're going to
[1:18:05] automatically get the ladder it's not
[1:18:08] that you did he he breaks down and
[1:18:10] forgets about us no huh
[1:18:14] so let's follow the example throughout
[1:18:16] the word John introduced Jesus that was
[1:18:23] his message Jesus was the latter rain to
[1:18:25] his message Jesus preached the message
[1:18:28] to the disciples they had to go to
[1:18:32] Pentecost and wait for the Holy Ghost to
[1:18:36] fall which was the latter rain and
[1:18:39] listen they had heard the word and then
[1:18:42] the latter rain the Holy Spirit fell on
[1:18:44] the day of Pentecost to make alive what
[1:18:46] they had heard all right so it produced
[1:18:50] a lot of rain season Pentecost the the
[1:18:55] word that they heard was made alive it
[1:18:59] became the latter rain are the word
[1:19:01] quickened by the Spirit of God to make
[1:19:05] that a rain for them a harvest or
[1:19:08] collecting when I'm using harvest until
[1:19:10] it gets in the last days remember run
[1:19:13] around and use harvest so harvest
[1:19:16] doesn't mean that it was over with that
[1:19:18] guard it means a collecting and getting
[1:19:22] ready for the next could listen alright
[1:19:25] then the disciples what's their message
[1:19:29] the disciples in their former reign
[1:19:32] teach to the people the faith of the
[1:19:37] father's the stature of a perfect man
[1:19:42] the Jesus Christ being the chief
[1:19:44] Cornerstone build on the foundation
[1:19:46] apostles prophets Jesus Christ all right
[1:19:48] you follow what I'm saying John preached
[1:19:52] the message Jesus was the ladder to that
[1:19:54] former Jesus preach the message of
[1:19:57] disciples was the latter aim to that are
[1:20:00] the Living Word Living Word just in
[1:20:04] Jesus was the Living Word
[1:20:06] with standing that stands a bride the
[1:20:07] living word and as she does she has a
[1:20:11] message the book of Acts she brought the
[1:20:16] faith of the father she began to teach
[1:20:18] it it was answered with the book of Acts
[1:20:21] acts of the Holy Ghost in the church
[1:20:24] which was the latter rain to what those
[1:20:27] disciples begin to preach all right the
[1:20:31] word was made alive and that become the
[1:20:35] body of Jesus Christ which was the book
[1:20:39] of acts are the alive word the latter
[1:20:43] rain to the former that the disciples
[1:20:46] had preached an alive word and the
[1:20:50] people he listened to it all the way
[1:20:55] down you see it tie right in what way
[1:20:57] talking about because you've got your
[1:20:59] your white horse rider
[1:21:00] it was the people red horse rider
[1:21:03] it was the people black horse rider it
[1:21:06] was the people then would say brother
[1:21:07] branham eagle Lorenz City just come to
[1:21:10] make way for the Eagles we don't listen
[1:21:20] and once as we start to Church ages
[1:21:23] watch it
[1:21:24] the Apostle Paul standing at the ending
[1:21:28] up of the book of Acts

[1:21:31] the aged paul standing there proclaim
[1:21:36] the message to the first church at
[1:21:38] ephesus the people believe that message
[1:21:42] and as they believe that message it
[1:21:45] became a latter rain to what Paul had
[1:21:47] preached or a quickening or a making
[1:21:50] alive of that word see it becomes a lot
[1:21:55] of rain the proof that it was the word
[1:21:59] then remember there's going to be
[1:22:01] another age to come I'm having a skillet
[1:22:05] but this get it see what happened with
[1:22:08] her disciples produced what happened
[1:22:11] with Paul Paul coming out from the book
[1:22:13] of Acts took his message to the first
[1:22:15] church age his message was the former
[1:22:19] rain the people making that message
[1:22:23] alive became latter rain people are a
[1:22:26] live word out of that now listen and
[1:22:32] watch the connection and the star steps
[1:22:34] if you see the Statue of a perfect man
[1:22:36] watch the star steps once you step up
[1:22:39] and your messenger comes the end of the
[1:22:41] age sure what Paul brought started
[1:22:46] pulling down and going down but remember
[1:22:48] they were still enough they're alive
[1:22:50] word until out from that out from Paul's
[1:22:54] message that had been brought in the
[1:22:57] face of the Father come Iranian Iranian
[1:23:03] priest his message of the age for his
[1:23:05] time and as he did what happened the
[1:23:09] people become alive with the word and
[1:23:11] they stayed alive enough until it come
[1:23:14] out for what now if I get them wrong you
[1:23:16] kick me alright Paul Irene yes Martin
[1:23:23] right
[1:23:24] Martin was produced by Paul and I radius
[1:23:28] if you're listening because they he was
[1:23:33] the word
[1:23:34] he was the alive word the original spoke
[1:23:38] original seat brother unsaid lie stood
[1:23:40] about for ages then it started more
[1:23:42] going into the ground
[1:23:44] don't worry about it going into the
[1:23:46] ground cards gonna come out whatever
[1:23:49] coat is not over
[1:23:51] Martin stood on the word and preached
[1:23:54] his message he stood on what he had from
[1:23:57] Paul and him and brought his message and
[1:24:00] when he did God answered that were the
[1:24:05] people that made it alive and from that
[1:24:08] people that made it alive
[1:24:09] walked out a man me Martin
[1:24:16] the rest said there was no greater than
[1:24:18] Martin of all the messengers it was no
[1:24:21] greater he said they never had a service
[1:24:25] they didn't have a signs and wonders of
[1:24:26] taking plush you see you're lonely
[1:24:29] looking at dying dying dying I'm not
[1:24:33] I've never looked like that see Martin
[1:24:36] when he brought his message he made sure
[1:24:39] his message was right with our reneus
[1:24:41] and Paul and the book of Acts and John
[1:24:43] and Jesus his message was alive not a
[1:24:50] dead letter but a live man walking out a
[1:24:54] messenger coming forth
[1:24:57] now what's you at the ending up with
[1:25:01] that age of Martin message your country
[1:25:05] in the age here comes Columba ever how
[1:25:08] you pronounce the Columba come by
[1:25:09] everywhere you want to pronounce it here
[1:25:12] he comes for stepping out upon what Paul
[1:25:15] and all them had preached and he brought
[1:25:17] his message which bound together are
[1:25:20] showed exactly the same God Paul
[1:25:23] preached same God Iranians proof the
[1:25:25] same god Martin please there stood
[1:25:27] Columba was the same message and the
[1:25:32] people made that alive
[1:25:36] that was the thousand years of dark ages
[1:25:38] then that struck right into that period
[1:25:41] of time
[1:25:42] and as it began to die and going to the
[1:25:44] ground it looked rough but God had
[1:25:46] already promised it
[1:25:50] from Columbus message of former rain
[1:25:54] when he ended up his life
[1:25:57] it produced a man called Martin Luther
[1:26:03] Martin Luther was already a convert
[1:26:05] converted he was a monk in a monastery
[1:26:08] he wasn't just somebody went down joined
[1:26:10] him monastery he was already a Christian
[1:26:12] he was already you know claiming to be
[1:26:14] in Christ and being saved and everything
[1:26:16] and all that wants the message struck in
[1:26:19] from work Paul said to just shall live
[1:26:23] by faith
[1:26:25] when Martin Luther stepped out of there
[1:26:28] with that message to sow that seed of
[1:26:30] the just shall live by faith into that
[1:26:33] fifth age it was a former rain as he
[1:26:35] brought it but as the people received it
[1:26:38] to become lighter rain to them are in a
[1:26:40] live word of quickening a harvest was
[1:26:44] there for each age you know what it
[1:26:48] produced I said you're gonna have to
[1:26:52] hold a home because you see it was
[1:26:54] Luther's message that produce Wesley you
[1:27:00] went with me for a while and then you
[1:27:02] drop now so you dropped also you know
[1:27:05] you drop you went where you were kind of
[1:27:07] looking and saying that's a good point
[1:27:09] that Paul brought his message and I
[1:27:11] reneus stepped right out on Paul's
[1:27:13] message Martin stepped right out on our
[1:27:15] eNOS
[1:27:16] come on we'll step right out on now
[1:27:20] don't go to sleep on me and pretend you
[1:27:22] asleep when you're sitting there in your
[1:27:24] head trying to figure out where I'm
[1:27:25] going just listen
[1:27:28] is it the Word of God that you just
[1:27:30] shall live by faith we realized then
[1:27:35] that when the messenger coming at the
[1:27:37] end of the age at the end of that age as
[1:27:40] Columbo was it was ending up Martin
[1:27:42] Luther walked on the scene and preached
[1:27:47] his message former reign of the just
[1:27:50] shall live by faith the people took that
[1:27:53] and made it alive and as they made that
[1:27:57] message alive it became to them a ladder
[1:28:00] rain or
[1:28:01] connection or a harvest and a man walked
[1:28:07] right out of there
[1:28:09] out of all of that Catholicism's all of
[1:28:13] that problems walk out a man called John
[1:28:16] Wesley John Wesley said I come to
[1:28:22] America to convert to Heath and found
[1:28:24] out I need to be converted myself Martin
[1:28:29] Luther preached his message West Nick
[1:28:31] step right up with sanctification all
[1:28:35] right what happened next
[1:28:38] Wesley got the message of sanctification
[1:28:41] he sold a former reign of sanctification
[1:28:44] because they ain't no messenger can give
[1:28:47] you anything the Holy Ghost is the only
[1:28:51] reviewer of the word I didn't say that
[1:28:53] your prophet said it if you want that
[1:28:56] quote be glad to find it a Holy Ghost is
[1:28:58] the only revealer of the you know who
[1:29:00] the messenger at each age were do you
[1:29:01] want this it was the Holy Ghost but it
[1:29:05] was in a man right but see you out of
[1:29:10] Luther's message come walked out Wesley
[1:29:13] out of Wesley's message come walked out
[1:29:16] I get it in here somewhere were veteran
[1:29:20] lucinda justification produced
[1:29:24] sanctification sanctification - baptism
[1:29:27] when the Holy Ghost
[1:29:27] and then the word all right now listen
[1:29:31] so as John Wesley will come forth and
[1:29:34] preached his message former Ryan what
[1:29:38] was the answer to John Wesley's message
[1:29:41] messenger comes the end of the age at
[1:29:44] the end of Wesley's age the Wesley come
[1:29:48] the end of Luther's age come on we got
[1:29:51] him laying here at the end of Wesley's
[1:29:54] age came Azusa Street
[1:30:01] Azusa Street Azusa Street was the latter
[1:30:07] rain to Wesley's message of
[1:30:10] sanctification justification makes work
[1:30:13] for sanctification sanctification makes
[1:30:15] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[1:30:17] got him laying here
[1:30:18] I don't preach without stuff laying in
[1:30:20] front so come up later and ask me where
[1:30:21] you want
[1:30:22] I got him laying right here you got the
[1:30:25] notes you've got the notes on it you
[1:30:30] come forth with Azusa Street my brother
[1:30:35] random says it so we got him laying here
[1:30:40] the masterpiece he's a justification
[1:30:43] made a way for sanctification
[1:30:44] sanctification made a way for the
[1:30:46] baptism with the Holy Ghost and the
[1:30:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:30:51] the Holy Ghost itself to come right down
[1:30:54] in perfection back to the word again to
[1:30:58] manifest itself that's 1964 but see
[1:31:04] that's where the key that brother
[1:31:05] Branham comes in at to explain but we
[1:31:10] don't want to read these questions and
[1:31:16] answers go ahead with number 7 we'll
[1:31:18] start reading a little bit questions and
[1:31:21] answers on the seals justification
[1:31:24] that's leave that one where they can
[1:31:26] read it justification is a work of the
[1:31:27] Holy Spirit saying if occasional work of
[1:31:29] the Holy Spirit but the baptism okay
[1:31:31] that's that's this question that's the
[1:31:33] reason it took a prophetic prophet to
[1:31:35] come down no messenger to the age so you
[1:31:39] don't want to have you think that's
[1:31:41] destroying brother Branham no way come
[1:31:45] on
[1:31:48] reading it took a prophetic prophet to
[1:31:50] come down no messenger to the aged
[1:31:52] brother branham was not the messenger to
[1:31:53] lady of seal come on we got the quote
[1:31:56] we'll read it in a minute what did he
[1:31:59] say
[1:32:05] on the message feast of the trumpet they
[1:32:08] come with a message of penico if I come
[1:32:13] with a message of Pentecost it would be
[1:32:15] in the lady you see in church age and it
[1:32:20] wouldn't be right
[1:32:25] but seeds we don't want to read that
[1:32:27] because it blows our mind we well how
[1:32:30] can we get to okay that's the reason it
[1:32:33] took a prophetic prophet you say a
[1:32:35] prophet holy ghost came he is the
[1:32:37] prophet whose overseas with a man he
[1:32:42] asked me what I thought about what he
[1:32:43] presented and I answered it I said first
[1:32:47] off you're trying to make brother
[1:32:48] branham to be come to John on Patmos and
[1:32:50] I said I don't agree with that I said
[1:32:52] why were you just respect all the other
[1:32:54] prophets and not allow all of it you may
[1:32:59] believe brother Branham come to John on
[1:33:00] Patmos but I don't I believe it was the
[1:33:03] Holy Ghost that come to John on Patmos
[1:33:05] it was the Prophet I said why you want
[1:33:08] to degrade it off why don't you make
[1:33:10] that and it won't come to John on Patmos
[1:33:12] be the Holy Ghost God Himself the
[1:33:14] prophet he hadn't talked to Miss Minchin
[1:33:18] I don't mean that talk to me and talk to
[1:33:20] him about half all right see that's
[1:33:24] reading it took a prophetic prophet to
[1:33:25] come down no messenger of the age
[1:33:26] because the Holy Ghost came himself and
[1:33:28] the fullness of the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:33:30] come on a Sutra Street in the fullness
[1:33:31] of the baptism now brother showing so
[1:33:36] that cannot preach era said that Azusa
[1:33:40] Street in all was false I told him I
[1:33:44] didn't agree with it till he said it
[1:33:48] right here I don't agree with it I
[1:33:54] believe what he said okay because the
[1:33:59] Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness
[1:34:01] of the baptism were susurrus true watch
[1:34:04] now you said well Widow but at the end
[1:34:06] of the age that it's always ends upon
[1:34:08] two others we find our then the
[1:34:10] messenger sent and all these scruples
[1:34:13] and things are to be placed in their
[1:34:16] places like that then the rapture
[1:34:19] for the church yeah no messenger to the
[1:34:25] age where the number eight which is the
[1:34:31] first seal we explained the messenger to
[1:34:35] the age but let the Prophet explain the
[1:34:37] messengers come Paul coming to end of
[1:34:39] the age we find out that Iranians come
[1:34:41] at the end of the age Martin into the
[1:34:43] age Luther into the Catholic aides
[1:34:45] watching and what Wesley at the end of
[1:34:51] the Lutheran age can you read the what
[1:34:58] and Pentecost at the end of the age of
[1:35:01] sanctification through the baptism of
[1:35:05] the Holy Ghost and at the end of the
[1:35:08] Pentecostal age we are supposed to
[1:35:10] receive according to the word as God
[1:35:13] helped me to not to show you through
[1:35:15] here that we are to see receive a
[1:35:18] messenger that will take all of those
[1:35:21] loose ends out there and reveal the
[1:35:24] whole secret of God for the rat string
[1:35:26] of the church who was the messenger to
[1:35:32] Azusa Street the Holy Ghost okay wait a
[1:35:36] minute
[1:35:36] I'll give it to you okay go to number 10
[1:35:40] got number 10 which is God's only
[1:35:44] provided place of worship
[1:35:48] now the Pentecostals that brother I
[1:35:50] believe his one of his eyes was out a
[1:35:52] colored brother who really started the
[1:35:55] Pentecostal message in California old
[1:35:59] Azusa Street he was laughed at because
[1:36:01] he was a Negro he was made fun of but he
[1:36:04] brought the message for that age just a
[1:36:08] little body a fella could hardly sign it
[1:36:10] own name but the Lord had revealed to
[1:36:12] him that this was the age for the
[1:36:14] restoration of the gifts and they come
[1:36:17] no matter what said it come
[1:36:20] who's the messenger to Azusa Street said
[1:36:24] no brother Brennan said no messenger of
[1:36:26] the aged he's because the Holy Ghost
[1:36:28] came himself well you're making another
[1:36:31] man knowing
[1:36:32] there's seven men in the statute of
[1:36:35] perfect man but there's eight
[1:36:36] manifestations of God
[1:36:39] now we'll tie brother run him into that
[1:36:41] if you want to go all the way but let's
[1:36:43] just get the rest of what we're doing
[1:36:44] where did we get to okay
[1:36:48] Wesley caught the message of
[1:36:50] sanctification and he preached that
[1:36:53] message to the people there was the
[1:36:55] former rain the people became the
[1:36:59] message that he had preached and their
[1:37:02] zeal a terrain are the quickening the
[1:37:03] harvest to prove it out of our walk John
[1:37:06] Wesley John Wesley believed what Paul
[1:37:08] what Luther had preached but he knew
[1:37:13] there was more to it so he stepped forth
[1:37:16] with his message what a former rain day
[1:37:19] and a message of Wesley and what comes
[1:37:22] from that if you following me I'm
[1:37:25] getting you to look at the people that's
[1:37:26] in each age the people is the one that's
[1:37:29] a live word time to get you to see what
[1:37:33] you are not if don't say nothing go
[1:37:41] ahead what you see when Azusa Street
[1:37:46] started off that colored man with a one
[1:37:48] eye Seymour's and all that come down
[1:37:51] through what was the other one daddy
[1:37:53] daddy seemed over that his name of it
[1:37:55] and it Heywood and all they come you
[1:37:58] ought to go to Jamaica and go over there
[1:38:00] and listen to those people of oneness
[1:38:02] their oneness but they know whatever
[1:38:06] scripture did I tried to bring the only
[1:38:09] thing they backed up in Fire Services
[1:38:11] was when I brought out Melchizedek and
[1:38:13] who he was they've never seen that and
[1:38:15] they just kind of it just went through
[1:38:18] and I had to explain it because they've
[1:38:21] never seen whom else editing book comes
[1:38:24] even Almighty God he's the one talking
[1:38:26] about so Azusa Street with the gifts and
[1:38:29] a DC morning him the oneness doctrine
[1:38:31] Azusa Street was Pentecostal of a
[1:38:34] Pentecostal group was actually
[1:38:35] Trinitarians most of you probably don't
[1:38:38] even know that Azusa Street was
[1:38:41] Trinitarians out of there came the
[1:38:44] oneness through Seymour
[1:38:46] and all of them bringing out the oneness
[1:38:48] doctrine and the oneness doctrine had
[1:38:51] come back and the baptism in the name of
[1:38:52] the Lord Jesus Christ had already been
[1:38:54] started using before brother Branham
[1:38:56] stepped on the same Ridge of history or
[1:39:02] at least read bread around him you hear
[1:39:05] so what happened the people become what
[1:39:10] the messenger on the day of his oosa
[1:39:12] Street had brought and they become a lot
[1:39:14] of rain to that out of there stepped a
[1:39:17] man that had a special work we just read
[1:39:24] he preached the faith of the fathers
[1:39:26] until he saw it statue of perfect man he
[1:39:29] preached it to bring it to the people
[1:39:31] that was the former rain the teaching
[1:39:35] rain of the Prophet in the early
[1:39:36] ministry and then the latter rain - that
[1:39:40] was a people that began to believe it
[1:39:42] and from the hour step forth the life's
[1:39:46] messenger of the messengers okay
[1:39:51] then brother Branham LAN listen and I
[1:39:53] got to finish it up brother Branham then
[1:39:56] was the latter rain to everything that
[1:40:00] had been brought him and his message now
[1:40:04] not him no no we're not Tara it's the
[1:40:07] message his message was the latter rain
[1:40:10] his message begun in the opening of the
[1:40:12] seals and the things they're after
[1:40:16] before then it was work of restoration
[1:40:19] his message was not a restoration his
[1:40:22] message listen listen careful his
[1:40:26] message was the words spoken from the
[1:40:29] lips of a man that had never been
[1:40:32] understood before in all the Bible it
[1:40:40] had never been understood it stepped
[1:40:42] from a man's lips he became the
[1:40:46] messenger the Malik of Malachi for
[1:40:48] produce a prophet Malachi for was just
[1:40:54] to return the faith of the fathers
[1:40:55] spoken words original seed if you'll
[1:40:57] read it you'll get it but you're not
[1:40:58] going to read it cause you don't wonder
[1:41:00] sand it you want to stay in you're black
[1:41:02] you're black and out situation to where
[1:41:04] you're at and be justified in your own
[1:41:06] thoughts well what do you think the
[1:41:08] reason we're here 50 years after the
[1:41:10] problem but I taught this 50 years ago
[1:41:20] season brother branham step forth from
[1:41:23] all of those things back back behind and
[1:41:25] brought his message starting in 63 some
[1:41:31] were 62 into life's one in 63
[1:41:33] three and a half years and see the
[1:41:36] people has got to become that message or
[1:41:41] there's no ladder rain to his message do
[1:41:44] you understand me if there's not a
[1:41:46] ladder rain I've got it written in here
[1:41:48] and I got a quote from the Prophet if
[1:41:49] that latter rain don't take place your
[1:41:54] former was wrong
[1:41:57] you better get serious if this message
[1:42:02] don't produce Jesus Christ then we've
[1:42:06] all missed it see as John preached and
[1:42:16] Jesus became the latter rain we see in
[1:42:19] the latter days that produces Street
[1:42:21] people preach the message and the
[1:42:24] Prophet stepped out on that then he went
[1:42:27] to had to connect to the faith of the
[1:42:28] fathers and get that so down completely
[1:42:31] the word a word would be correct and
[1:42:32] those seals can't be something different
[1:42:34] from the statue of a perfect man and the
[1:42:37] things of the before then that's why I
[1:42:39] differ with these brothers that say
[1:42:40] brother Branham was corrected and here
[1:42:42] later he changed his doctrine come and
[1:42:45] show me but see you don't want to hear
[1:42:50] that well why don't some of you people
[1:42:52] out there that's listening to what I'm
[1:42:54] saying why don't you go to your pastor
[1:42:56] and tell him that and why don't you get
[1:42:59] him by the NAP of the next they're seen
[1:43:00] in the britches and bring him here no
[1:43:04] you ain't gonna do it because you're
[1:43:05] scared of them your soul is the most
[1:43:10] important thing that could ever be
[1:43:12] yet you won't fight for your soul I'm
[1:43:15] fighting for mine with everything that
[1:43:17] I've got I'm trying my best to get you
[1:43:21] to see like illustrating it out of one
[1:43:24] age it produced another age out of that
[1:43:26] age produced another age out of that
[1:43:28] produced another out of that produced
[1:43:29] another and it when it comes to this
[1:43:31] life stage it produced Azusa Street with
[1:43:36] the messenger being the Holy Ghost and
[1:43:41] that Holy Ghost could put forth in a
[1:43:44] profit and start preaching back to the
[1:43:47] faith of the fathers and get back to the
[1:43:49] faith of the father's then his message
[1:43:51] could open Co that's what he said on
[1:43:53] spoken word originally he said yet Lord
[1:43:56] something's wrong
[1:43:57] I've preached my heart out I preached
[1:43:59] the faith of the father appreciate right
[1:44:01] and what's wrong
[1:44:02] he said Milliken for a fool for you so
[1:44:08] melikhaya for had another part right
[1:44:10] what was the two parts that we've always
[1:44:11] been quoting 327 Church age book this
[1:44:13] messenger Malachi for Luke 17 30
[1:44:15] whatever it says will grow to two things
[1:44:18] 1 turn the hearts of the children back
[1:44:19] to the faith to the Father to reveal the
[1:44:21] seven thunders which is a revelation
[1:44:22] contained in the seven seals
[1:44:24] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:44:26] truths that literally turn our hearts
[1:44:27] back read it the Prophet brought a
[1:44:33] message that's to stand between time and
[1:44:35] eternity now what did brother Branham
[1:44:42] say that he came to do you can talk
[1:44:47] about faith afar but what about this
[1:44:49] quote that the product this prophet
[1:44:54] would be pointing to the skies - a word
[1:44:57] born bride that the coming of Jesus
[1:45:01] Christ see you and I've got to be a lot
[1:45:07] of rain now listen don't go haywire
[1:45:13] because this latter rain will take us to
[1:45:17] a harvest there is not another one
[1:45:20] coming we've reached the end of all
[1:45:23] things the prophet has brought his
[1:45:24] message the people become here
[1:45:26] message and as they become his message
[1:45:28] then they go forth okay let's get one
[1:45:31] more go ahead go ahead number 11 let's
[1:45:39] get to number 11 which is 340 ladies in
[1:45:44] church hmm
[1:45:48] okay that comes down get the whole thing
[1:45:53] over set down to the church a Giunta
[1:45:54] thing and when it comes to Wesley the
[1:45:56] voice of the word and the people and the
[1:45:58] revelation of God didn't watch what it
[1:46:00] comes up and their God raised up others
[1:46:02] and so he has gone on through the years
[1:46:04] until in this last day there is again
[1:46:08] another people in the land who under
[1:46:11] their messenger will be the final voice
[1:46:14] to the final age now I didn't say that
[1:46:22] don't get upset with me cause I found it
[1:46:26] the bride is to be the final voice no
[1:46:29] brought around final voice read what he
[1:46:31] said this last day people is another
[1:46:35] people in the life laying under there
[1:46:38] messenger can only bring what their
[1:46:41] messenger brow what I said go home

[1:46:48] latter rain now you may have to type in
[1:46:50] former and latter rain then you have to
[1:46:52] type in ladder you know what type it in
[1:46:57] and see how many times brother around
[1:46:58] spoke of former and latter rain and how
[1:47:01] that he spoke of down through the ages
[1:47:05] and how he brought it up to Azusa Street
[1:47:07] and said they had the word and he
[1:47:13] stepped right out and brought the
[1:47:15] message you see we've got to make a live
[1:47:20] we've got to make a live what he brought
[1:47:25] if not there is no latter rain now you
[1:47:30] want to stay a little while and let me
[1:47:31] quote one more why is the latter rain
[1:47:36] withholding in the last day
[1:47:38] who's got two scripts

[1:49:07] questions we'll have a whole series of
[1:49:09] questions but I want one face line
[1:49:13] through to where you'll understand now
[1:49:15] listen
[1:49:16] John spoke it Jesus became it Jesus
[1:49:21] spoke it's each one former lines rather
[1:49:23] Jesus spoke it the disciples became it

[1:49:32] brought into Iranian smart and kahlúa
[1:49:34] out in all and come to this last days
[1:49:38] that this messenger is to turn us back
[1:49:42] or have a harvest rain are the Prophet
[1:49:45] said rapture in faith where'd he say the
[1:49:49] rapture fate lays in these books and

[1:50:13] thank God for some better home fire
[1:50:17] thank God hang on throw off on him I'm
[1:50:22] just gonna asked what are they bringing
[1:50:26] is it to help you and me to understand
[1:50:29] who we are to be or is it still just
[1:50:31] trying to prove brother branham was a
[1:50:33] prophet I think we ought to know that
[1:50:40] let's tan that's just saying I love him
[1:50:43] anybody has a need you have a question
[1:50:47] about anything I say
[1:50:49] you asked me I'll be glad to tell you or
[1:50:52] tell you don't mind
[1:51:01] anybody have a need
[1:51:07] be calm ether love but Ron who said so
[1:51:18] you don't listen
[1:51:21] well Ron said here comes a former rain
[1:51:23] with a lighter rain on it wouldn't
[1:51:26] follow that watch him he said here comes
[1:51:28] the latter rain with a former on it
[1:51:35] that's done gone we didn't get it but if
[1:51:39] you look at it or what I've been trying
[1:51:41] to bring former and latter rain now
[1:51:44] that's one word you realize if God spoke
[1:51:48] to you today
[1:51:49] and reveal to you something I say it
[1:51:53] that's a former rain teaching it's been
[1:51:56] a quickening of the latter to you but

[1:52:04] that you hear today and make manifest
[1:52:05] today tomorrow is a former you may not
[1:52:09] follow that line but that's true that's

[1:52:14] moving straight forward take every day
[1:52:18] as it comes and say thank you God that
[1:52:19] was a lot of the form of rain to reveal
