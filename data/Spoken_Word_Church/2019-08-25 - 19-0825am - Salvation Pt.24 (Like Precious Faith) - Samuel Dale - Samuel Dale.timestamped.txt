[20:39] Ephesians four
[20:41] Romans five Ephesians four remember all
[20:45] of these that are sick among us right
[20:47] the Lord would bless each one because
[20:49] that's something that we can all do
[20:51] together
[20:52] is get a burden on our heart for the
[20:54] sick among us now
[20:56] as I've always said it's not trying to
[20:59] call down fire now we don't believe in
[21:02] doing that but there's one thing about
[21:04] it tomorrow may be your day in the
[21:07] barrel okay you know what is meant by
[21:10] that it may be you'll be sick next who
[21:13] else will be sick next so we all bind
[21:15] together to pray one for the other you
[21:18] know and and I like what brother John
[21:22] Martin said one time he said why do we
[21:24] have to wait until we get sick
[21:27] he said why can't we pray for not to get
[21:30] sick well that's a good point you know
[21:33] why can't we do that just pray to not
[21:35] get sick and all and take care of it
[21:37] okay father we thank you for this day
[21:40] and your grace and your love we thank
[21:42] you for the opportunity to be able to
[21:44] stand and talk about you but what a day
[21:47] what a time we have the Lord that you
[21:50] would reveal yourself unto a an unworthy
[21:53] group of people that has no thoughts of
[21:57] being worthy of any form or any part to
[22:00] do in it but to know that you have
[22:02] chosen us and Lord that you're leading
[22:04] us into the love got each one remember
[22:07] the sick among us touch each one of them
[22:09] either remember those that are away wait
[22:13] brother the Beast ministering today you
[22:14] just be with them as they minister and
[22:17] may we all be together in loving you we
[22:19] love you and we think you got us now in
[22:22] Jesus name Amen
[22:24] brother Matthew brave will be here with
[22:27] us the Lord willing I
[22:29] guess what it'll be the eight in other
[22:32] words not just coming Saturday ears on
[22:35] but if the time with us it'll be the
[22:37] eighth or the night there always works
[22:39] out you know not just from come and
[22:42] weekend with the next okay my brother
[22:43] Matthew brave will be with us the Lord
[22:45] with it so let's go on into our
[22:47] scriptures right
[22:50] since therefore being justified by faith
[22:54] we have peace with God through our Lord
[22:57] Jesus Christ
[22:59] with whom also we have access by faith
[23:02] into
[23:03] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[23:08] in hope of the glory of God and I
[23:11] remember this what we're bringing that
[23:13] by whom also we have access by faith
[23:18] alright by faith
[23:21] okay now let's go over to Ephesians
[23:24] we'll go to
[23:27] for
[23:31] is there is one body and one spirit even
[23:36] as you are called in one hope of your
[23:40] calling one Lord one faith one baptism
[23:45] one God and Father of all who is above
[23:49] all and through all and in you all you
[23:53] may be seated to the Lord that is
[23:54] blessing to the reading of the word
[23:59] now our thought
[24:02] for today
[24:04] will be basically based upon faith
[24:09] because
[24:11] without faith it's impossible to please
[24:14] God and no and we we will be going into
[24:19] getting more into the stature of a
[24:22] perfect man
[24:23] from this as to given us understanding
[24:27] of what to do but now I want you to
[24:31] think about one thing
[24:33] I've got a bunch turn off some here and
[24:36] I had a bunch more where the Prophet
[24:38] talks about that there's just one faith
[24:41] all right he says it's not many face
[24:46] he says there's one faith he said now
[24:49] you can have a faith
[24:53] and they can be many
[24:56] you know you can have a faith even how
[24:58] churches you can out denominations you
[25:00] can have all kind of things and it can
[25:02] be many things but he says there's just
[25:06] one the faith see thee is singular so
[25:10] when we get into the scriptures irony
[25:12] when Hebrews it says now faith is the
[25:14] substance
[25:15] it's not a substance it is the substance
[25:21] all right now I remember this in the
[25:24] Baptist because I remember saying
[25:26] something two of them one time only and
[25:28] this man was talking to me about how
[25:30] that you know that we was Baptist
[25:34] because of John
[25:36] we're Baptist because we followed John
[25:39] the Baptist said we'll I said we just
[25:42] messed up he said what I said you just
[25:46] finalized it to say in one thing John
[25:49] the Baptist so there's never been but
[25:53] one and there never will be but one
[25:56] right you get what I'm talking about
[25:59] there's just John the Baptist there's
[26:01] not a whole bunch of John the Baptist is
[26:03] running around and I said so then you're
[26:06] trying to make a church out of something
[26:07] that there's just one of it is john the
[26:11] baptist's i had that much understanding
[26:14] see back then to be able to at least
[26:17] read and see what words meant you can
[26:21] have a a Baptist you can have a faith
[26:24] and all I kept but there's only one
[26:26] faith
[26:28] because there's one Lord
[26:31] right they remember one faith one Lord
[26:35] one
[26:36] baptism all right so now we have just
[26:39] one baptism right in the name of the
[26:42] Lord Jesus Christ
[26:43] right
[26:45] all right see then we'll we have only
[26:48] one
[26:50] Lord
[26:53] so there's not many Lords or it's not a
[26:56] Lord it's the Lord Jesus Christ all
[27:01] right so we have only one Lord one
[27:04] faith one baptism
[27:07] within we would only have one Revelation
[27:13] right called faith is a revelation of
[27:16] the word of God and faith is the
[27:20] substance of things hoped for the
[27:24] evidence of things that you don't see
[27:27] me know but father my point then will
[27:31] drop into the message of getting to what
[27:33] I want you to see follows what I'm
[27:36] saying John the Baptist that means it's
[27:39] just one
[27:41] alright so then the faith
[27:47] would fit with what Paul is saying in
[27:50] Hebrews that faith is the substance
[27:54] he didn't say faith is a substance faith
[27:57] is the substance
[27:59] all right now the prophets you know
[28:02] you've been through it you studied the
[28:03] message you you've been in it long
[28:05] enough to know most of you that then he
[28:07] said it's it's not a faith
[28:10] it's the faith that
[28:13] was once delivered to the Saints he said
[28:16] now that's what we're contending for not
[28:19] a faith not a church not a doctrine
[28:24] deal the it's the
[28:28] singular because that's what the
[28:30] substance is now
[28:33] substance according to Webster is what
[28:37] anything consists of
[28:40] right faith is what anything consist of
[28:45] you say no this isn't no well let's see
[28:48] we could go on and keep reading in the
[28:50] Bible where they talk about by faith we
[28:52] know that the worlds were framed by the
[28:55] Word of God that it was made from things
[28:57] that do not appear
[28:59] all right so then the word would be the
[29:03] singular point of dealing with it and
[29:05] getting it to stay now on faith being de
[29:09] substance
[29:11] no no that's why brother Brennan says
[29:14] you can't be saved without having faith
[29:20] right
[29:22] you can't be saved without having a
[29:24] revelation
[29:25] because that's what faith is
[29:28] faith is a revelation of the Word of God
[29:32] and a revelation now a revelation can
[29:36] you can walk on a revelation
[29:39] right but you can't walk just on mental
[29:42] concepts
[29:45] then see the faith is singular and
[29:49] that's the substance of what anything
[29:51] consists of wrote a moment had a good
[29:54] web Vick statement because this was his
[29:56] way he said faith is what anything
[29:59] consists of would it be natural or
[30:02] spiritual
[30:07] are you following that now everything
[30:10] natural is a substance correct trees
[30:14] cars fish live food whatever people
[30:17] whatever it's a substance
[30:21] all right it's the substance it's what
[30:25] anything consists of all right then
[30:28] that's it in the going on and reading
[30:31] there in Hebrews you'll find the worlds
[30:33] were framed by the Word of God
[30:38] we're from
[30:41] what from
[30:43] from things that do not appear
[30:47] it was the Word of God
[30:49] the Word of God created the world
[30:52] alright so the substance of this world
[30:55] is the Word of God
[30:57] the substance of your faith is that sure
[31:00] there's the point for today remember it
[31:03] if we can believe that
[31:06] wood whatever metal thing that God
[31:11] created that from something that was not
[31:15] there he didn't take this and put it
[31:17] together with this and bring it down to
[31:19] this and make metal and then he took
[31:21] this and put it with that and come down
[31:22] made a tree no
[31:25] he just spoken
[31:29] he spoke it
[31:31] when he spoke it he come into being
[31:33] because it was the substance
[31:36] now is your faith that real
[31:43] is your faith your revelation
[31:47] is your new birth
[31:51] that real
[31:56] now we've been on the new birthright
[31:58] trying to bring it and get into it and
[32:00] it's laying down and getting ready to go
[32:01] into more into the faith virtue
[32:04] knowledge temperance alright
[32:06] but is your faith a
[32:09] substance or is it a mental concept
[32:17] now remember if it's a mental concept
[32:19] somebody brother would be had a good
[32:22] point of saying he said you can get him
[32:23] in with hot dogs and you can get them
[32:24] out with a hamburger
[32:26] now you understand what that means
[32:29] if you get somebody in by this some
[32:31] little doctor a little idea somebody
[32:33] come along with a little bit bigger idea
[32:35] or doctor or something and take you out
[32:37] right
[32:39] yeah but if it's a substance
[32:44] no I'm just trying to get a point to you
[32:50] it's one faith one Lord one baptism I
[32:53] mean there's any way to convince you
[32:56] that water baptism in the name of the
[32:57] Lord Jesus Christ is incorrect
[33:01] if there is then you don't have a faith
[33:04] on that you don't have that as a
[33:06] substance if he can be taken away you
[33:09] don't have it it's a mental concept it's
[33:13] not a substance
[33:15] remember substance what do you think
[33:18] consists of
[33:19] all right now
[33:21] could you take away the point of being
[33:24] one Lord how many guards are there how
[33:27] many think that's why I've always just
[33:28] been against these people with the way
[33:30] they bring they've always gotta have
[33:32] this and - this is an antenna and I've
[33:35] always just been I'm sorry
[33:37] I've just been that away that I'm just
[33:39] it's the way I think if you've got two
[33:42] Lords you've got two gods that's as
[33:45] sensible as I can make it
[33:48] right if you've got two Lords you got
[33:51] two gods you've got two souls you've got
[33:54] two
[33:55] gods
[33:59] so God's because that's what you're
[34:03] depending on you don't have the
[34:05] substance to walk on it you have a
[34:09] mental concept but not of confession
[34:14] right but not a possession
[34:17] okay so now faith
[34:21] Hebrews 11:1 says faith is the substance
[34:25] of
[34:27] things hoped for whatever you hoping for
[34:30] now we can go into what the Prophet says
[34:33] what now he says if I'm hungry and
[34:37] needing some bread
[34:40] he said
[34:42] what in other words is the difference in
[34:45] me having the quarter which I wouldn't
[34:49] work today you know a couple of dollars
[34:51] now but alright but what would be the
[34:54] difference in having the quarter he says
[34:56] then having the bread
[34:59] well I don't know how the bread has seen
[35:02] that's you
[35:03] your faith is not anchored your faith is
[35:06] not sure you have a faith
[35:09] you don't have the faith
[35:13] he said if it isn't he said I've got the
[35:16] quarter he said I've got two purchasing
[35:18] power
[35:19] he said then I have
[35:22] the substance and
[35:26] he goes on to explain that the substance
[35:30] of anything there is an evidence because
[35:32] that's what the scripture says
[35:34] just as things hope for
[35:36] things not seen it's the evidence
[35:40] all right now if your substance is your
[35:44] new birth and evidence is it a substance
[35:50] is it something real
[35:53] not something that somebody can talk you
[35:56] out of it
[36:02] brother al he used to say and he'd say
[36:05] why don't you go front let brother Dale
[36:06] talk you out of the fact that you're
[36:08] healed
[36:10] we'll see I wouldn't talk you out of it
[36:12] but I just talk with you a little bit
[36:14] and find out you ain't got it
[36:18] because if you have the substance you
[36:21] have the healing it don't matter when it
[36:23] comes oh yeah they want to operate on my
[36:27] shoulder and if not know how my first
[36:29] year I'll probably let them because
[36:31] that's your hurts me but the thing of it
[36:33] is I'm already healed I don't care about
[36:36] the the point of what I got to do that's
[36:39] where you get all tied up within little
[36:41] claims that you get your idea of thing
[36:43] what's it matter whether you let the
[36:45] doctor take something out or you let God
[36:48] take it out that's what we don't see
[36:50] faith
[36:52] yeah but if you had faith you would have
[36:54] operation well if you had faith you
[36:56] would need Oh
[37:02] brother brother day huh okay is it right
[37:11] you gonna argue that point
[37:13] but
[37:16] the saying by stripes I'm healed
[37:20] and most of you know you know I got
[37:22] something I got tested out that's long
[37:23] that I've got to this word we're okay
[37:25] most of you know my wife and him
[37:27] especially the family knows that back
[37:29] last year and throughout last year and a
[37:32] few got a while I've had trouble with
[37:34] both knees
[37:35] and Weiss tried to get me that operated
[37:38] on and everything else well they still
[37:41] bother me a little bit but see the big
[37:44] pain is going away so I thank God
[37:47] but I just keep confessing it I
[37:51] can get up now I can walk
[37:55] you just keep confessing it till it
[37:58] comes to pies well my shoulder
[38:01] well I just I'm gonna confess is healed
[38:06] okay but still the walk right in there
[38:09] that day hey doc like it do whatever you
[38:11] got to do it fix the thing
[38:13] right
[38:15] because I believe in the doctor as well
[38:19] as I believe that God has give us the
[38:20] doctors for our thing why would brother
[38:23] branham tell a man when he walked up and
[38:25] he remember the story and and this man
[38:28] said he said something about his stomach
[38:30] he said now brother he says now there's
[38:32] an old doctor down here said you need to
[38:35] go down there to him
[38:37] know if you ever heard this story told
[38:39] this is actually I can find it in the
[38:41] message he said you need to go down
[38:44] there to that doctor and said he
[38:46] specializes in that kind of operation
[38:50] well there was a prophet sending a man
[38:53] to the
[38:55] have you ever heard this quote you don't
[38:58] have a right to go before God
[39:00] wait a minute let me make sure I get the
[39:03] statement right he's you don't have a
[39:05] right to go before God for your healing
[39:07] until you've been to the doctor first
[39:08] now it's something close to that I
[39:11] ain't never preached that you got to go
[39:13] to the doctor don't get that idea now
[39:15] cuz that ain't what he's talking about
[39:17] that ain't what brother Branham was
[39:18] talking about he's meaning plain to me -
[39:21] meaning plain sensible why are you
[39:24] afraid to go to what I'd prove I didn't
[39:26] I don't say well what do you hurting or
[39:28] that proves you don't have it
[39:31] yeah okay good office I need to preach
[39:36] on faith like it has but now listen
[39:40] if it's true that there's just one faith
[39:43] one Lord one baptism one God and Father
[39:48] of us all and in the goal yeah all right
[39:51] then when we get to the stature of the
[39:54] perfect man the Prophet said if you've
[39:58] read the book you're supposed to be
[39:59] reading on it he says now that's the
[40:02] basis of what I want to talk about today
[40:04] is faith faith
[40:09] then you're gonna find out in a minute
[40:11] that your faith is gonna flop feeling
[40:14] careful
[40:19] because see I'm gonna go ahead and put
[40:21] it this way there's a lot of people
[40:23] teach the stature of a perfect man
[40:27] and it's been a doctrine down through
[40:29] time that a lot of you
[40:32] sit and listen to but must not have paid
[40:35] no attention to it
[40:36] but it was taught to you that you're not
[40:38] born again do you get to the top of the
[40:40] pyramid
[40:44] you never heard that doctrine talk
[40:47] that you're not born again - you didn't
[40:49] the top of the pyramid you said yeah but
[40:52] the Prophet said we have the new birth
[40:53] well we don't have you have it show it
[40:56] to me tell me signs miracles and wonders
[40:59] well that's not a proof of anything
[41:01] that's a proof of stupidity y'all but
[41:04] not a proof of anything to anchor with
[41:07] we'll see I'm telling you the doctrine
[41:10] has been taught
[41:11] that you don't get the new birth until
[41:14] you come up here to the headstone now
[41:17] when the Prophet says you're born again
[41:19] at faith see that that's price at all
[41:21] and they tried it to to maybe kids make
[41:24] some doctrinal issues out of it and
[41:26] things you know okay but that's the
[41:30] point I wanted to make now before we get
[41:32] into the statue of perfect man I
[41:36] thought we're supposed to believe what
[41:38] the Prophet said not what we were what
[41:40] we think
[41:41] all right and see ya but brother dude I
[41:44] believe brother so-and-so said I don't
[41:46] care what brother someone's from saying
[41:47] huh I don't have nothing to do with it
[41:50] it's what God has to do with it it's
[41:53] what he said and like I told you know I
[41:56] was sitting talking to her two brothers
[41:57] and one of them went this way off the
[41:59] scale and he says you're not born again
[42:01] until you get to the headstone pyramid
[42:04] and all it up to talk and all like that
[42:06] the other brother said well you ain't
[42:08] got nothing yet
[42:11] these two ministers I
[42:14] said what y'all brother's mind if I just
[42:16] kind of stake somewhere in the middle I
[42:18] said cuz I certainly can't go with with
[42:21] that that we don't have nothing till we
[42:24] get here and I can't go with the fact
[42:26] and deny what I do have
[42:28] I'll see you mind if I just kind of stay
[42:30] here in the middle and then let me quote
[42:33] the Prophet he said I
[42:35] met people that had the baptism with the
[42:37] Holy Ghost just exactly like the day of
[42:39] Pentecost
[42:43] both of them admitted right openly that
[42:46] they couldn't explain that that they
[42:49] wondered why he said that I
[42:52] thought it simple once you just go back
[42:55] to the book of Acts now you've heard me
[42:58] explain this a lot of them but some of
[42:59] you and you would have it on the day of
[43:02] Pentecost you got a split condition you
[43:05] got 120 in the upper room
[43:08] that has been tutored for three and a
[43:10] half years
[43:11] and then the Holy Ghost failed well the
[43:15] Prophet said it gave them these virtues
[43:17] now watching these virtues but he
[43:20] stopped here he said but the headstone
[43:23] ain't come yet
[43:24] so now he's stipulating a point okay
[43:30] let's see that put them positionally at
[43:32] a good point
[43:34] all right but the just a few hours later
[43:38] a little bit here's three thousand
[43:41] outside that here is one sermon and
[43:44] receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:46] the new birth eternal life
[43:49] they get it at faith then everybody
[43:53] that's born again since that day is born
[43:55] again at faith are the earnest of our
[43:58] inheritance
[44:00] we'll get to that more as we talking to
[44:03] more the statue of a perfect man but now
[44:06] think of it
[44:08] if substance is what anything consists
[44:12] of then your new birth
[44:16] consists of the word that has been
[44:19] revealed to you
[44:24] you follow that I never asked anybody to
[44:27] agree with me I don't ask my wife I'm
[44:30] their kids what a degree with me I ask
[44:32] you to listen because I'll explain what
[44:35] I believe and why I believe it and this
[44:39] left up to you cuz I can't reveal it to
[44:40] you
[44:42] there's no way I can reveal it to you I
[44:44] can only speak about it and then God has
[44:48] to reveal it okay now if it's true then
[44:54] that faith is the substance and faith is
[44:58] the birth of the word that you've heard
[45:02] so usually what happened to the
[45:04] disciples look how they had been taught
[45:07] all of these things look through here
[45:09] all through the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[45:11] for three and a half years and the Holy
[45:13] Ghost failed it made them sons and
[45:16] daughters of God
[45:20] well but now the next time it happened
[45:23] on which was an hour so later you had
[45:26] three thousand at one time to receive
[45:28] the Holy Ghost
[45:29] are you going to say well this one got
[45:31] the Holy Ghost but this didn't get the
[45:33] whole ego
[45:36] no it's simple like I tried to tell
[45:40] those brothers you're born again at
[45:42] faith
[45:43] the new birth is the earnest of our
[45:46] inheritance
[45:47] the Bible said until the
[45:51] presented
[45:52] earnest very nervous until the
[45:54] possession comes forth into full
[45:58] manifestation all right and see then
[46:02] would you birth stand true
[46:06] can you walk on your revel
[46:09] now we're not talking about you gotta
[46:11] walk physically you know we'll get up
[46:12] brother then walk down through here
[46:13] beneath n beat us all
[46:17] come on a lot of you don't even know
[46:19] that being here and walk right off the
[46:20] platform right out in midair
[46:27] but you see
[46:29] it's not that a way to try to make
[46:31] something
[46:34] it's whether or not what's within you
[46:37] controls you
[46:39] makes you to what you need to be all
[46:42] right now
[46:46] what about this faith
[46:49] I'm trying to get a point now to you so
[46:51] listen so faith
[46:54] is
[46:56] what I'm seeking after you know I can
[47:02] make a confession
[47:04] but I needed substance
[47:07] then if I have a substance I don't worry
[47:10] about somebody trying to take it away
[47:12] from me so
[47:13] you think that Here I am and I've done
[47:16] it for all these here we're on internet
[47:20] going out
[47:21] I've always said if you see me wrong
[47:23] come on show me where I'm wrong we never
[47:26] had anybody yet to come I thought when
[47:28] we put it on the internet and opened it
[47:30] up that it be that my mail would be so
[47:33] full till they'd have to send a special
[47:34] UPS truck to send me my mail you know
[47:40] but yet I just try to preach it so
[47:43] straight till I know where they're at at
[47:46] least I appreciate the brothers they're
[47:48] not gonna try to beat they're not gonna
[47:50] show how dumb they are
[47:51] you know I don't mean that to be wrong
[47:55] cuz they're not gonna come out and just
[47:58] say well I think you're wrong oh yeah
[48:00] they do whatever works out you know
[48:01] around you know you know different
[48:03] things that but
[48:05] I'm just saying
[48:08] if you really have a substance if you
[48:12] really have the new birth you're not
[48:13] afraid of anybody
[48:16] in any doctrine
[48:21] huh come on if you really have the new
[48:25] birth
[48:27] you have that substance faith
[48:32] okay
[48:35] no all right now we'll start into the
[48:38] message I'm asking you this question
[48:43] do you believe that the disciples
[48:47] had the new birth
[48:51] morning getting experience baptism of
[48:53] the holy ghost whatever you want to lay
[48:55] with in there to talk about it do you
[48:58] believe that your disciples
[49:00] had the new birth
[49:06] then if he knew that if you believe they
[49:09] had the new birth do you believe you
[49:12] have it as they had it
[49:14] there's the second question see we can
[49:18] talk about and that's what people do
[49:20] they say well you know we don't have it
[49:22] like them well I don't see why not
[49:26] yeah I wouldn't the one that said the
[49:29] things a prophet said it so it's less up
[49:32] to God to produce it
[49:34] all right
[49:36] do you really have the confidence in the
[49:40] fact that you're born again
[49:46] that you're a child of God that you have
[49:50] within you right now eternal life in
[49:55] your soul not in your body your spirit
[49:57] but in your soul the being that you are
[50:00] do you have eternal life
[50:03] if not then we need to all recall
[50:07] right
[50:09] we need to get that straight so that's
[50:11] why that I'm preaching so hard and so
[50:13] straight about it to make sure that if
[50:16] you're not dead since you're on what
[50:18] you're believe
[50:19] then you can be wavered by any doctrine
[50:22] or idea
[50:26] you fall after anything
[50:33] because he's Satan it's not that we're
[50:36] facing we're facing the the
[50:39] Christian faces the worst
[50:43] doctrinal issues and pride things that
[50:46] could ever be thought of to consider the
[50:49] fact of a new birth
[50:53] [Music]
[50:55] but do you believe that you have the new
[50:58] birth
[50:59] I'm not talking about now listen why
[51:03] explain things that are going on I
[51:05] believe every born-again believer will
[51:08] prove by the Prophet is born again at
[51:09] faith because he said how faith and be
[51:12] born again okay if you lift some statue
[51:14] of a perfect man you've heard him let's
[51:16] see the disciples were right here 120 in
[51:21] the upper room
[51:22] because they'd been tutored for three
[51:24] annive here
[51:27] right three and 1/2 years they had been
[51:32] tutored by the Lord Jesus
[51:34] taught the word
[51:36] and when they were born they were born
[51:40] at that place
[51:41] but the people outside
[51:44] the later that heard the word
[51:48] they couldn't be born again up here
[51:50] because they don't have the word they
[51:53] were born again here where it says faith
[51:57] well honest don't believe God brother so
[51:59] until he really made it sound good I
[52:01] really enjoyed I just don't understand
[52:03] what you're talking about well you might
[52:05] want to pray and ask God to reveal it
[52:08] because the new birth is a revelation
[52:10] you know and you can't be born again
[52:13] without a revelation what I still have a
[52:15] revelation to that well then you're not
[52:16] born again okay problem solved
[52:21] I'm saying it why don't you say it if
[52:24] you don't have an anchor within your
[52:28] soul to word that there's something
[52:30] within you that cannot be taken away
[52:37] then you need to be in the altar
[52:42] well I just really don't know whether
[52:44] I'm born again well then what are you
[52:48] doing about it
[52:51] you remember what I've always told you I
[52:54] would to God I could preach to where
[52:58] everybody in this building would wind up
[53:02] figuring out they wasn't saved
[53:07] that way you could do something about it
[53:10] you could go before God and cry out to
[53:13] him to give you an answer to what you
[53:16] need
[53:17] I'm not trying to tell you your loss I
[53:20] never try to tell nobody they lost
[53:23] and that Pentecostal God enter at work
[53:25] at the time told me that then he wasn't
[53:28] fooling with with the devil no more come
[53:30] and he said I'm commanding the Lord I
[53:34] didn't holler and scream tell him how
[53:36] wrong he was I just disappeared
[53:40] because I was talking to the big guy
[53:43] myself you know what I mean
[53:46] that man didn't have enough sense to say
[53:49] that it was what was inside of him don't
[53:53] by the fact of being the devil talking I
[53:57] said sorry buddy I
[54:00] can't go that away I
[54:02] said when it says commands you me it
[54:05] doesn't mean that you're commanded it
[54:07] means you believe God and thank God for
[54:11] giving it to you and you believe it and
[54:13] he'll make it manifest
[54:15] right but think about it now
[54:22] what kind of a faith did those Apostles
[54:26] house
[54:33] what kind of a faith did a high up
[54:38] every one of them gave their life
[54:41] for the gospel I think John's the only
[54:43] one who died a natural death right I
[54:45] believe that's correct
[54:48] everybody else was crucified one way or
[54:51] the other
[54:53] gave their life
[55:00] with our faith they able to stand that
[55:03] test
[55:09] well you sure do preach negative don't
[55:12] if you didn't understood what I was
[55:15] talking about
[55:16] and you'd see how positive what I'm
[55:19] talking about is
[55:20] I'm talking about the most positive
[55:23] point that could ever be made if you're
[55:26] truly born again you have eternal life
[55:30] dwelling within your soul and
[55:32] there's no way you can ever lose it
[55:37] it can't be taken away
[55:41] it's given unto you now listen all right
[55:45] let's start now with our our point of
[55:48] thinking because this is the lay in the
[55:50] background to start on the statue of a
[55:53] perfect man so go ahead and pull up
[55:56] number
[55:57] number two
[56:00] let's start right there
[56:02] because I want you to think about these
[56:05] scriptures and what they're actually
[56:07] saying now this is 2nd Peter this goes
[56:10] on down to get to the virtue or
[56:13] knowledge temperance places and all that
[56:14] but let's start off where it starts
[56:17] this is 2nd Peter 1 and 1 Simon Peter a
[56:21] servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ
[56:25] to them that have obtained like precious
[56:29] faith
[56:30] with us through the righteousness of God
[56:33] and our Savior Jesus Christ
[56:36] so now we're talking about like precious
[56:39] faith
[56:41] life is like anything you know
[56:46] it means it's it's the same thing or you
[56:50] know like precious so whatever faith
[56:54] they had we need
[56:57] well you think you have what they had
[57:00] if we don't have what Peters talking
[57:04] about we're lost
[57:06] you want to argue that
[57:09] if we don't have what Peters talking
[57:12] about we're lost
[57:15] that's as blunt as I can be I
[57:19] don't like your way of expressing though
[57:22] well good
[57:23] maybe you'll do something about it but
[57:26] look
[57:29] silent Peter a servant an apostle of
[57:32] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[57:35] like precious faith with us through the
[57:39] righteousness of God
[57:40] all right
[57:42] Peter is saying I
[57:45] will read his we will in 2nd Peter is
[57:48] saying I have this faith
[57:51] and I'm dressing this to the people to
[57:54] have this faith the same faith I'll
[57:59] now watch him listen to brother branham
[58:02] Peter's not talking about that you got
[58:06] to be up here before you got anything
[58:11] all right now let's just read it's a
[58:15] greater number
[58:16] number three is degree killer number
[58:18] four
[58:19] let's starting to read some from the
[58:22] stature of a perfect man
[58:25] paragraph 33 now that second Peter the
[58:29] first chapter Simon Peter served an
[58:31] apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[58:33] have obtained like precious faith with
[58:36] us through the righteousness of God and
[58:37] our Savior Jesus Christ I like the way
[58:40] that stated right there
[58:43] because my whole subject this morning is
[58:46] based on faith let me read that again
[58:49] listen close Simon Peter a servant an
[58:52] apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[58:55] obtained obtained like precious faith
[58:59] through the righteousness of God and our
[59:01] Savior and our and Jesus Christ notice
[59:05] rolling up where you can make sure that
[59:07] cos retreated
[59:09] notice he is saying that I have obtained
[59:14] this faith
[59:19] that's brother Branham said you supposed
[59:22] to been reading it so you read it now
[59:26] he is saying that I have obtained this
[59:29] faith I
[59:31] have the faith
[59:34] all right and I'm addressing this to
[59:39] them that has obtained the like precious
[59:43] faith
[59:45] he said I've got the faith and I'm
[59:47] addressing this to people that have the
[59:49] same faith I have
[59:54] it's not to the outside world
[59:58] this is to the church see those that are
[1:00:02] in Christ
[1:00:04] now
[1:00:09] Peter you
[1:00:11] were chosen to open the doors to the
[1:00:15] Gentiles you were chosen for many things
[1:00:17] you wrote a lot in your own hand and
[1:00:21] thing to us
[1:00:23] and you're saying that you have a
[1:00:25] certain kind of faith
[1:00:30] he said now I'm addressing this to
[1:00:33] people that's got that same kind of
[1:00:34] faith now is that what he said I'm
[1:00:38] addressing this to them that has
[1:00:40] obtained the like precious faith
[1:00:42] who see rotten -
[1:00:45] - born-again Christians right now look
[1:00:49] what he said it's not to the outside
[1:00:50] world
[1:00:52] now here's been the hardest thing for me
[1:00:54] to try to get people to see
[1:00:57] maybe for me to see it so ok by women
[1:00:59] til I get through where I can see it and
[1:01:01] then you'll be all right
[1:01:04] the Bible is not written to a sinner
[1:01:11] the only thing the Bible can do to a
[1:01:14] sinner is condemn that person for
[1:01:17] sinning
[1:01:19] bring to them a knowledge that they need
[1:01:22] to be saved
[1:01:23] it is not written to them
[1:01:28] because they can't understand it
[1:01:31] right
[1:01:33] now I've got a lot going over here later
[1:01:35] but I'll put go ahead and drop it in
[1:01:37] here the Bible says no man can call
[1:01:39] Jesus the Christ except by the Holy
[1:01:40] Ghost the
[1:01:42] brother said brother Brennan said except
[1:01:45] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:01:48] can't call Jesus the Christ you can said
[1:01:50] all day long by your mouth
[1:01:53] but until you can say it from your heart
[1:01:55] by the new birth you don't have it
[1:01:58] so look at what Peter told him I have
[1:02:01] obtained this faith I've got this faith
[1:02:03] I
[1:02:08] have this revelation
[1:02:11] of Jesus Christ and I'm addressing this
[1:02:16] to them that has obtained the same like
[1:02:19] precious faith
[1:02:20] so now he's evidently talking to
[1:02:23] somebody that's got it so now that blows
[1:02:26] the doctrine out that nobody's got it
[1:02:29] until you come down here to get in the
[1:02:30] end one of the really what they're
[1:02:31] saying there's nobody ain't got it till
[1:02:33] I tell them how what it is you don't
[1:02:35] listen to doctrines like that you ought
[1:02:37] to listen sometimes what they're saying
[1:02:38] instead of the mouth words they use him
[1:02:43] come on the brother probably was telling
[1:02:46] you ain't gonna have it til I tell you
[1:02:48] where you got it or not
[1:02:52] okay now listen church it's not to the
[1:02:57] outside world
[1:03:00] the Bible is not written to the outside
[1:03:03] world
[1:03:04] it can only bring a sinner to a natural
[1:03:09] knowledge that he needs to be saved
[1:03:15] yeah but I know a man that can quote the
[1:03:18] other scripture in the Bible and he he's
[1:03:21] got a good memory thank God wish I had
[1:03:24] it
[1:03:24] but it ain't gonna be knowing that won't
[1:03:27] save him
[1:03:30] well all I gotta do is believe
[1:03:36] what do you believe
[1:03:39] if you're gonna put it on the basis all
[1:03:41] you gotta do is believe what do you
[1:03:42] believe
[1:03:43] what are you to believe I
[1:03:48] never thought about it like that happen
[1:03:52] let's see the Bible the Statue of
[1:03:56] perfect man is not written in 2nd Peter
[1:03:59] to the world but neither is Matthew
[1:04:05] 29-28 that what it is about the water
[1:04:07] baptism
[1:04:10] the Bible is not written get that point
[1:04:13] if I have to stay on it to finish this
[1:04:16] whole day get the point the Bible is not
[1:04:20] written to a person that is lost
[1:04:25] you cannot understand it without the new
[1:04:30] birth
[1:04:33] without the Holy Ghost now I've got them
[1:04:35] laying here how many of me you want
[1:04:38] that no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:04:42] it's about 30 something times that
[1:04:45] brother Branham says that maybe more
[1:04:48] you can't call Jesus the Christ without
[1:04:51] the new birth
[1:04:53] so you can say all day long the words
[1:04:55] you can quote them you can do everything
[1:04:57] your honor you can call it all you can
[1:05:00] do all that but that doesn't tell me
[1:05:01] what he's talking about
[1:05:03] the probably says you can't call him
[1:05:06] call Jesus the Christ except it be by
[1:05:09] the new birth
[1:05:14] because it's the new birth inside of
[1:05:16] unit speaking out
[1:05:18] it's him that's doing the talking it
[1:05:20] ain't you
[1:05:21] right
[1:05:23] and see you say you ever brunella I know
[1:05:26] I'm born again because I've done this
[1:05:27] side of the other
[1:05:32] heaven help us if that's where we're
[1:05:34] still left
[1:05:38] well you can't tell me I saved I ain't
[1:05:41] trying to tell you you saved I'm trying
[1:05:43] my best to get you to think about it
[1:05:51] see because you cannot
[1:05:54] be saved
[1:05:56] unquote listen here somewhere or any
[1:05:59] other you cannot be saved without it
[1:06:02] being a revelation that's what the
[1:06:05] prophets said now so it's not shouting
[1:06:07] crying speaking in tongues feelings
[1:06:09] ideas and things that we had happen I
[1:06:12] know I'm saved because I felt yes I done
[1:06:15] that it's none of those things you can't
[1:06:18] put it on that you
[1:06:20] can only put it on whether or not the
[1:06:24] spirit in you agrees with the word and
[1:06:26] that agrees means keeps all agreeing
[1:06:30] what I told that Baptist preacher I said
[1:06:33] the Bible says he that believeth in his
[1:06:35] baptized believe that keeps on believing
[1:06:38] I said why'd y'all teach it to us that
[1:06:40] all you had to do was to believe it well
[1:06:43] we did not so wait a minute come on get
[1:06:44] off I
[1:06:45] taught plain to him just like I do hard
[1:06:49] but I said you know yourself what I'm
[1:06:50] talking about you taught it to us and
[1:06:52] telling us all we had to do was believe
[1:06:54] I said the Bible says the devil believed
[1:06:57] and trembled about
[1:06:59] he said well I guess we did teach it
[1:07:01] wrong
[1:07:04] but listen
[1:07:07] do you have the same born-again
[1:07:10] experience
[1:07:11] now I remember what I've explained it
[1:07:13] over and over
[1:07:15] 120 in the upper room got the baptism of
[1:07:18] the Holy Spirit
[1:07:20] the 3,000 outside got the baptism of the
[1:07:23] Holy Spirit it's the same Holy Spirit it
[1:07:26] maybe degreed in the basis of how much
[1:07:29] knowledge or understanding or whatever
[1:07:32] goes with it but it's the same new birth
[1:07:36] anybody that's born again we've got the
[1:07:38] same new birth
[1:07:41] only you women that had babies unless
[1:07:45] there was something went wrong and it
[1:07:46] had to be done some other things all of
[1:07:49] you women had a baby the same
[1:07:53] water blood and baby
[1:07:57] then they just didn't go through what I
[1:07:59] did see that's what I'm saying you do
[1:08:01] that and then you go into the gospel
[1:08:03] letter wait
[1:08:05] you said well well they didn't have the
[1:08:07] problem right ahead cuz I've talked to
[1:08:09] them and they didn't hurt like I heard
[1:08:11] what are you trying to prove what they
[1:08:13] got to do with it birth is the birth
[1:08:17] the new birth is a birth
[1:08:20] everybody that's born again is born
[1:08:22] again the same that's why I've taught
[1:08:25] that over for for the fifty years I've
[1:08:27] been in the message and
[1:08:30] it takes justification sanctification
[1:08:33] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:08:36] have the new birth
[1:08:39] and ever new birth is a birth of the
[1:08:42] word
[1:08:51] like precious
[1:08:54] life is equally precious
[1:09:00] especially honored to be you know of the
[1:09:03] same
[1:09:06] so Peter said I'm writing this to those
[1:09:09] that have obtained
[1:09:10] like precious faith
[1:09:14] so now I've received this faith and I'm
[1:09:17] writing it to those who have this faith
[1:09:20] what now he's gonna tell you about
[1:09:23] statue of perfect man
[1:09:27] right
[1:09:29] we're having to get this out of the way
[1:09:31] code now you know he's gonna tell you
[1:09:32] about the statue of a perfect man add to
[1:09:35] your faith virtue and all these
[1:09:36] temperance bases on
[1:09:40] but he said I want you to know you first
[1:09:44] got to be born again
[1:09:47] you've got to have the inside teacher
[1:09:50] before you could be taught anything
[1:09:53] outside of that is head knowledge
[1:09:59] if you do not have the new birth then
[1:10:02] see you don't have that inside teacher
[1:10:08] then you can have a faith ain't Lord
[1:10:12] ain't baptism which you can't howdy
[1:10:16] faith the Lord and the baptism
[1:10:20] he is singular it has nothing to go with
[1:10:23] it
[1:10:30] like precious faith
[1:10:33] just exactly like what Peter had
[1:10:39] well now Peter was way up here with see
[1:10:41] now you're trying to get Peter them got
[1:10:43] the new birth same way of anybody else
[1:10:45] the new birth started him right down
[1:10:47] here justification of sanctification
[1:10:50] this was their baptism of the Holy
[1:10:53] Spirit
[1:10:56] because they were tutored for three and
[1:10:59] I of your
[1:11:00] but the three thousand outside only
[1:11:03] heard one message and they were
[1:11:05] justified sanctified and filled with the
[1:11:08] Holy Spirit and wound up being babes in
[1:11:10] Christ
[1:11:12] desiring in the sincere milk of the word
[1:11:15] that we may grow thereby
[1:11:24] what is the faith that
[1:11:27] was once delivered to the Saints I
[1:11:30] mean I was looking at him this morning
[1:11:33] the run said that's the one we're
[1:11:35] honestly contending for her we're not
[1:11:38] contended for what was delivered to the
[1:11:40] Baptist imagine that's the presbytery or
[1:11:42] whatever
[1:11:43] we're not you know we're honestly
[1:11:46] contending for the faith that was
[1:11:48] delivered to the Saints and
[1:11:50] Peter called it like precious faith
[1:11:55] he said I have this like precious faith
[1:11:58] and I'm talking to people that have the
[1:12:02] like precious faith
[1:12:06] this is not written to the world it's
[1:12:09] not far the world
[1:12:12] it's to get you born again it can tell
[1:12:16] people they're lost
[1:12:18] don't misunderstand me when I make a
[1:12:20] bold statement a
[1:12:22] sinner cannot comprehend the Word of God
[1:12:25] he can only get his intellectual concept
[1:12:29] of that
[1:12:32] and I've told you over and over my
[1:12:35] experience I
[1:12:38] came up through straight strict doctrine
[1:12:42] come into this message
[1:12:46] wound up hearing a prophet telling what
[1:12:49] a new birth was
[1:12:50] and when I did I realize I didn't have
[1:12:53] it
[1:12:56] you know I was a deacon at 23 years of
[1:12:58] age
[1:13:00] teaching the adult Sunday School classes
[1:13:03] in time when I walked out of the Baptist
[1:13:05] Church
[1:13:08] well honored among the people of the
[1:13:13] Baptist faith
[1:13:16] but when I heard brother Branham telling
[1:13:19] about a new birth being the birth of the
[1:13:20] word I
[1:13:21] knew
[1:13:24] that if I had a birth of the word that
[1:13:27] was a Baptist word I wouldn't born again
[1:13:33] for two years
[1:13:36] after coming in this message I
[1:13:41] would not
[1:13:43] take the doctrine and ideas of people
[1:13:46] even though they told me said well
[1:13:48] you've done this you've done that you
[1:13:49] believe the message you must be born
[1:13:50] again
[1:13:51] it ain't to me
[1:13:53] two years
[1:13:56] until God came down and sealed that for
[1:13:59] me
[1:14:02] and during that time brother Colley
[1:14:06] sitting right there he can tell you I
[1:14:09] have been known to read six books in one
[1:14:13] day and
[1:14:15] listen to two tapes in that same day
[1:14:21] not bragging just telling the truth
[1:14:24] I've done it
[1:14:27] because I believe it if you're gonna
[1:14:30] believe the words you need to know what
[1:14:31] it says I had a decent knowledge of the
[1:14:35] Bible point but when that prophet
[1:14:37] brought it alive
[1:14:39] I
[1:14:39] seen God
[1:14:41] that I met when I was 11 years old and I
[1:14:45] knew where he was at but nobody couldn't
[1:14:48] get me to him
[1:14:51] but I talked to people about it and they
[1:14:53] just whether you need to go to some
[1:14:54] Pentecostal church or do something they
[1:14:57] didn't understand me
[1:14:58] you see after I come in this message I
[1:15:00] didn't say well I come into the message
[1:15:02] so it proves I'm saved for two years I
[1:15:06] saw God I
[1:15:14] probably read more than one day and a
[1:15:16] lot of yous read in a year
[1:15:20] and many of you ever read six books in
[1:15:23] one day
[1:15:24] how long it took me all day
[1:15:29] because I wanted to know what the
[1:15:32] Prophet said
[1:15:33] because this man talked about a birth
[1:15:36] that I knew I didn't have
[1:15:42] he talked of the birth of the word of a
[1:15:46] like precious faith
[1:15:51] are you listening
[1:15:55] like precious faith
[1:15:59] okay
[1:16:06] but uh Brennan was quoting Peter and he
[1:16:07] said Peter said I have this faith and
[1:16:11] I'm addressing this to people that have
[1:16:13] this faith
[1:16:14] are you one of them do you have the
[1:16:18] faith
[1:16:20] there's one faith one Lord one baptism
[1:16:22] do you have the faith
[1:16:26] not trying to decrease denies anybody or
[1:16:29] say anything about it I'm trying to tell
[1:16:31] the truth
[1:16:33] do you have the new birth
[1:16:36] if you do then that new birth is this a
[1:16:39] new birth that Peter received
[1:16:43] and now he's gonna teach us how to come
[1:16:46] up the statue of a perfect man like
[1:16:52] precious faith
[1:16:56] what is like precious faith
[1:17:01] what is it
[1:17:13] go ahead with number four a
[1:17:16] usually I put a lot of numbers in on
[1:17:18] this one because I kept adding from the
[1:17:21] message calls earnestly contending for
[1:17:22] the faith
[1:17:23] little brother said I just love that
[1:17:25] address he's talking about Jude the
[1:17:29] brother and all of that he sanctified O
[1:17:31] God and preserved in Jesus Christ and
[1:17:33] called I just love that address I like
[1:17:36] the way he places that out there now
[1:17:39] look this letter
[1:17:40] not written to the unbelievers
[1:17:48] notice he states specifically to them
[1:17:52] that are sanctified
[1:17:53] goes on down takes you totally into the
[1:17:56] new birth this is not talking to
[1:17:59] unbelievers
[1:18:01] unbelievers cannot understand what
[1:18:03] Peter's talking about
[1:18:07] where do they be in this message or
[1:18:09] outside the message unbelievers cannot
[1:18:12] follow what the Prophet is saying that's
[1:18:15] where the trouble is that
[1:18:17] you say yeah but nobody don't have that
[1:18:19] light precious faith
[1:18:24] nobody just don't have it like they had
[1:18:27] it
[1:18:32] well
[1:18:37] go ahead to number five
[1:18:40] what house will you build me
[1:18:43] and now that brother green
[1:18:46] you know who that is brother / green
[1:18:49] God has sent him in here and opened us
[1:18:53] up a church of like precious faith
[1:18:59] that we believe it
[1:19:04] he said for the pretty green come in to
[1:19:07] pick up a church of like precious faith
[1:19:14] go ahead number six so happy today to
[1:19:19] have received the baptism of the holy
[1:19:21] ghost and to be a fellow worshiper of
[1:19:25] like precious faith as you all stand far
[1:19:28] today
[1:19:35] number seven all the ways of our life my
[1:19:39] brothers and sisters who are like
[1:19:42] precious faith
[1:19:44] who's been born of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:48] that's had the blood of Jesus Christ to
[1:19:51] sanctify me thing like precious faith
[1:19:57] but it wasn't so from the beginning so
[1:20:00] about the baptism of the Holy Spirit I
[1:20:02] truly believe that with all my heart I
[1:20:05] believe in the gifts of the Spirit
[1:20:08] prophesied speaking in tongues etc and
[1:20:11] all the great things that goes in the
[1:20:14] body of Christ and believed by one
[1:20:16] spirit we're all baptized into that body
[1:20:19] and our members and fellow citizens of
[1:20:22] the kingdom of God and brethren and
[1:20:25] sisters of like precious faith
[1:20:35] seemed like he knowed a little bit about
[1:20:38] like precious faith
[1:20:44] well we just we just don't see God
[1:20:47] moving like this you know why
[1:20:49] that statement alone is one
[1:20:54] when you say we don't see God moving
[1:20:57] that means you are doubting God moving
[1:21:00] and
[1:21:02] when you're doubting God moving God
[1:21:05] can't move in your life
[1:21:08] now you blaming everybody else
[1:21:13] well I remember when the church used to
[1:21:16] be so much on fire who died
[1:21:21] are you part of the church
[1:21:25] well what went wrong
[1:21:28] but I remember when we used to have this
[1:21:30] we witnessed what went wrong
[1:21:40] who doesn't know how no revival what
[1:21:43] went wrong I
[1:21:44] preached to you'll know things right the
[1:21:47] Prophet said there'd be a revival come
[1:21:49] that would fill every fiber of our being
[1:21:51] and take us in the rapture well my life
[1:21:54] don't see it well what did that got to
[1:21:56] do with it
[1:22:00] you think you're something you think you
[1:22:02] can control it
[1:22:09] let's don't see that we have the faith
[1:22:12] the Apostles had what do we have
[1:22:21] well we just don't see it mean we don't
[1:22:24] see it cause we don't believe it
[1:22:27] now you want to testimony meeting
[1:22:32] yeah but we don't see the book of Acts
[1:22:34] alive anymore
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:37] you don't test them on the meeting
[1:22:42] he's been healed by the Lord of
[1:22:45] different things
[1:22:51] many times as we've seen storms spoke
[1:22:54] into existence
[1:22:55] because we needed rain but spoke out of
[1:22:58] existence because we got too much rain
[1:23:04] how many things do we need what do we
[1:23:06] need to be proof
[1:23:08] we've seen the dead raised
[1:23:14] I'll take you right today to a man's
[1:23:16] house and he'll tell you in a hurry
[1:23:19] that that man right there him and his
[1:23:22] son was standing there and said if he
[1:23:24] hadn't have been there I'd be dead he's
[1:23:27] because I died
[1:23:28] he told the world I mean the people
[1:23:31] around us while we're hunting together
[1:23:32] he told him
[1:23:36] seen his eyes robot wait said daddy he's
[1:23:39] dead
[1:23:45] I just called his name real loud I said
[1:23:47] Rando
[1:23:49] and he just
[1:23:52] was I am
[1:23:55] just raised on a hook
[1:23:58] we've seen the sick healed what do we
[1:24:02] need
[1:24:03] why don't we believe that we have like
[1:24:05] precious faith without talking about
[1:24:08] like precious faith that Peter is
[1:24:10] talking about like precious faith is
[1:24:12] this place right here not only up here
[1:24:14] it's right here
[1:24:17] like precious faith is the faith that we
[1:24:20] can attain them to if we have the new
[1:24:22] birth we have that faith
[1:24:29] we have the faith in disciples head so
[1:24:32] we have the same faith that everybody
[1:24:34] has if you're born again you have the
[1:24:38] same eternal life
[1:24:42] right
[1:24:43] when I just don't see that's what I'm
[1:24:46] saying that's what it goes to well I
[1:24:48] just don't resist own you don't see it
[1:24:50] cuz you never will see it
[1:24:55] well if we just had the Prophet back
[1:25:00] I'll tell you this Elijah that's the
[1:25:02] best I can say it
[1:25:06] for your sake in men and we don't need
[1:25:08] the Prophet back today I
[1:25:10] said that the way I minute and you take
[1:25:13] it what you want to I said for our part
[1:25:15] we don't need him back why because he
[1:25:17] condemned every one of us
[1:25:22] well you don't want see that's what he
[1:25:25] said you'd already done you don't run
[1:25:26] that to your mind you doesn't figured
[1:25:28] out all I'm talking about I'm talking
[1:25:29] about one time if we if he was here
[1:25:31] right now he'd call out every one of our
[1:25:33] unbelief
[1:25:39] around the Wimbley
[1:25:41] my god what's wrong
[1:25:49] they like precious faith
[1:25:52] we can have like precious faith if you
[1:25:56] have the new birth you have like
[1:25:58] precious faith you don't have the statue
[1:26:00] of a perfect man into manifestation
[1:26:02] we'll pick that up this evening where it
[1:26:05] comes into the divine nature of God
[1:26:10] see by the new birth you have the same
[1:26:13] faith the Apostles had
[1:26:20] you have eternal life in your soul
[1:26:23] don't let the devil beat you down
[1:26:30] stand up and say that's it I believe it
[1:26:39] why can't you stand for it I've stood
[1:26:43] over 50 years
[1:26:45] declaring this message to be right
[1:26:50] and I believe it more today than I did
[1:26:53] when I started
[1:26:58] and I'm glad he's let it go the way he
[1:27:01] let it go because it's gonna drop
[1:27:04] everything that ain't work nothing
[1:27:06] somebody's going to believe it
[1:27:09] and stand on it are we that people
[1:27:13] we start with like precious faith then
[1:27:16] we grow in grace and knowledge see
[1:27:18] that's what you're gonna have to accept
[1:27:19] to see that the new birth gives you that
[1:27:22] faith they don't give you virtue or
[1:27:24] knowledge temperance patience those are
[1:27:26] the things we are birthed into after we
[1:27:29] receive the new birth to come into the
[1:27:31] body
[1:27:33] after we're born again these are the
[1:27:35] things then God expects us to add if you
[1:27:38] read the Statue of per man you heard
[1:27:39] that
[1:27:44] but let me say it this away ain't asking
[1:27:48] for raise a hand but how many of these
[1:27:50] read the Statue of perfect men since I
[1:27:53] announced that you needed to read it
[1:27:55] buys you I wouldn't raise no hand if I
[1:27:58] hadn't done it cuz you build a locker
[1:28:00] you see what I'm talking about
[1:28:04] many have studied that message you
[1:28:06] listen to a tape or
[1:28:09] we get you want to know yes you don't
[1:28:12] know whether it's right or not
[1:28:14] won't you read the book and say
[1:28:18] you know I'm like this I'm gonna end it
[1:28:21] come on musician I'm this way
[1:28:23] you realize that
[1:28:27] if God doesn't move on the scene we're
[1:28:30] gonna be too deceived and taken into the
[1:28:31] wrong way and gonna wind up like the
[1:28:34] rest
[1:28:37] well I ain't deceived well
[1:28:42] why can't we say we believe it
[1:28:48] and say thank you Lord for what you've
[1:28:51] revealed to us
[1:28:53] do you realize what God has revealed to
[1:28:56] you things that the prophets desired to
[1:28:59] look into is at the Bible
[1:29:03] they desired to look into the things you
[1:29:06] and I see I
[1:29:11] couldn't see it I couldn't believe it
[1:29:13] correctly
[1:29:15] sure what's fine for their time
[1:29:19] what you see the world's weight no me
[1:29:22] and you
[1:29:26] adoption time is that what the prophets
[1:29:28] said they're all waiting on you and the
[1:29:30] adoption time when he can pour into us
[1:29:32] his fullness and the Baptism and raise
[1:29:35] the dead and we'll go in the rapture
[1:29:47] told you the other day about
[1:29:49] this had a lady over school over there
[1:29:52] and they called her flunking Duncan
[1:29:55] because she always would kick everybody
[1:29:58] out but anybody did ever stayed under
[1:30:01] her long enough to get anchored with her
[1:30:05] and her teachings they wound up to be
[1:30:08] great math people
[1:30:11] she knew what to do to teach it but she
[1:30:13] couldn't get nobody listen so she had to
[1:30:16] go ahead and flunk them you don't turn
[1:30:17] them down and kick them out and give
[1:30:19] them zeros
[1:30:21] what would happen if they just listened
[1:30:27] they wouldn't even have took a book home
[1:30:31] that's what I've always said it about
[1:30:33] this message
[1:30:35] how many times do you read and study and
[1:30:39] pray your Bible or the message
[1:30:43] how many times
