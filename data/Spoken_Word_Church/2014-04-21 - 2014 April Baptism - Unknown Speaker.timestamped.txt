[0:00] have a word prior before we go into the
[0:01] baptismal service
[0:03] and ask the lord to bless these and be
[0:04] baptized so that's the purpose of it
[0:08] father we thank you this day for your
[0:09] love and your grace and trust
[0:11] thank you for the word that we've heard
[0:13] today now we come to just fulfill more
[0:15] of it
[0:16] we can just come to you and lord believe
[0:19] you and just
[0:20] baptize these that lord has been
[0:23] desiring to be baptized
[0:25] pray that you bless them now if you fill
[0:27] them with the holy ghost
[0:31] the reason for being baptized is not to
[0:33] wash away our sins
[0:35] but an answer of a good conscience do
[0:38] what you say lord and follow you
[0:39] we love you and we thank you in jesus
[0:42] name
[0:44] amen everybody here
[0:48] since we have some new ones here i'm
[0:49] telling jim coming down the road i think
[0:51] i'll
[0:51] we're going to read our scripture in
[0:53] romans 6 we have the bible but then i'm
[0:55] going to go back
[0:57] and just kind of speak a moment about uh
[1:01] why we baptize the way we about why we
[1:03] baptize
[1:04] the name of the lord jesus christ not
[1:06] entitled
[1:07] father son holy ghost like the rest of
[1:10] the world if that's all right
[1:12] amen we got all evening
[1:15] it's much needed in romans chapter 6
[1:19] now we've got two brothers to be
[1:21] baptized if anybody else
[1:23] wants to be baptized i'm not going to
[1:26] come out of here to him
[1:28] so we do all right the bible says
[1:31] what shall we say then shall we continue
[1:33] in sin that grace may abound
[1:36] paul said god forbid how shall we that
[1:39] are dead to sin
[1:40] live any longer therein know you not
[1:44] that so many of us as were baptized into
[1:47] jesus christ
[1:48] were baptized into his death of course
[1:51] that's what we do
[1:53] this is the burial ground this is where
[1:56] we bring it right here
[1:58] we bring the burial we bury the person
[2:00] and when the person dies the old man
[2:02] don't come back
[2:04] okay all right therefore we
[2:08] are buried with him by baptism
[2:12] into death that like as christ was
[2:15] raised up from the dead by the glory of
[2:16] the father even so we
[2:18] also should walk in newness of life
[2:22] or if we have been planted together
[2:25] what do you do with a seed you plant it
[2:29] that's what we're going to do we're
[2:30] going to plant it now what does the seed
[2:31] do when it's planted
[2:32] it dies it rots but there's life in
[2:36] there and that life comes back up
[2:37] in newness of life that's what paul's
[2:39] talking about for if we have been
[2:40] planted together in the likeness of his
[2:42] death
[2:43] we shall also be in the likeness
[2:46] of his resurrection so there's a promise
[2:49] knowing this that our old man is
[2:51] crucified with him
[2:53] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[2:56] not just hung up
[2:57] not just put aside not just put him in a
[3:00] closet till we need him
[3:01] but destroy it hence henceforth
[3:04] we should not serve sin
[3:08] for he that is dead is free from sin
[3:12] you can't accuse the dead man of
[3:13] anything
[3:15] thank you dead man of stealing my
[3:18] grandfather's been dead for
[3:20] 60-something years you could accuse him
[3:23] of stealing yesterday all you wanted to
[3:25] he's dead so that's what we're talking
[3:26] about here we're coming out of death
[3:28] now if we be dead with christ we believe
[3:30] that we also shall live with him so
[3:32] we're being identified
[3:34] with what's going on knowing that christ
[3:36] being raised from the dead
[3:37] diet no more death hath no more dominion
[3:41] over him
[3:42] for in that he died he died unto sin
[3:44] once but in that he
[3:46] liveth he liveth unto god now paul
[3:49] summed this up
[3:50] likewise reckon you also yourselves to
[3:52] be dead indeed into sin
[3:54] but alive unto god to jesus christ our
[3:57] lord
[3:58] now you see this in verse 3 it says no
[4:01] you're not in so many of us as we're
[4:02] baptized into jesus christ
[4:04] now if i'm a dale i'm identified as a
[4:08] dale
[4:09] okay this is for the youngest even even
[4:11] for
[4:12] for hank and and some of those that are
[4:15] new among us
[4:16] i'm a dale because i was i was in the
[4:19] family of dale
[4:20] i was born in the family of dale so that
[4:23] identifies me with the dale family is
[4:24] that correct
[4:26] all right now i'm a father
[4:30] my son josh he's not here but he's it's
[4:33] sure
[4:34] i'm a son there's my daddy and i'm a
[4:37] spirit
[4:39] but now that's not my name i can't go
[4:40] down to the bank and sign my name
[4:43] father son holy spirit they'll say
[4:46] who are you who are you
[4:50] you know i want you to identify who you
[4:52] are
[4:53] who are you and i tell him samuel wade
[4:55] dale ii well then see they identify
[4:57] me with that name so we go over here to
[5:02] the book of matthew and read what jesus
[5:05] said because we're going to fulfill this
[5:07] great commission
[5:10] and this great commission is jesus is in
[5:12] galilee and he's given the great
[5:13] commission before he's called up he says
[5:15] then the 11 disciples went away into
[5:17] galilee into a mountain
[5:18] where jesus had appointed them and when
[5:21] they saw him they worshiped him but some
[5:23] doubted
[5:24] and jesus came and spake unto them
[5:25] saying all power is given to me in
[5:28] heaven and in earth
[5:30] go you therefore and teach all nations
[5:32] baptizing them
[5:33] in the name name
[5:37] singular name of the father
[5:40] and of the son and of the holy ghost now
[5:42] it does not say in the name of the
[5:44] father in the name of the son
[5:45] and the name of the holy ghost that's
[5:47] how that baptized in the denominational
[5:48] world
[5:50] they say we'll take what jesus said well
[5:52] this is exactly what he's telling you to
[5:53] do he's telling you to be identified
[5:55] with the father and the son and the holy
[5:56] ghost all right
[5:58] teaching them to observe all things
[6:00] whatsoever i have commanded you and lo
[6:02] i am with you alway even unto the end of
[6:05] the world
[6:07] now let's go over to our to acts and we
[6:10] see that
[6:12] peter in the book of acts now what does
[6:14] peter say peter
[6:15] peter gets up on the day of pentecost
[6:18] and remember he's a spokesman right
[6:20] didn't jesus say
[6:22] i give you the keys of the kingdom
[6:23] whatever you buying on earth i'll bind
[6:24] in heaven whatever you loose on earth
[6:26] i'll loose in heaven
[6:26] well peter is fixing to lose something
[6:30] he's fixing to lose something on this
[6:32] earth
[6:33] that has been eroded down through the
[6:35] ages by denominational world and
[6:37] denominational teachings in our own
[6:39] teaching
[6:39] their own ideas it says well you need to
[6:42] be baptized in the name of the father
[6:44] and of the son of the holy ghost you
[6:45] know that's true
[6:48] we're going to baptize just exactly what
[6:50] jesus said to do today
[6:52] amen because peter couldn't say anything
[6:54] different
[6:55] because peter gets up and preaches a
[6:57] wonderful sermon
[6:58] in the book of acts here in acts 2.
[7:02] but he gets to acts 2 37 now when they
[7:05] heard this
[7:05] they were pricked in their heart in
[7:07] other words they were convicted in their
[7:09] soul
[7:10] and said unto peter unto the rest of the
[7:12] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[7:14] do
[7:16] now peter could have said should have
[7:17] said well you need to be baptized in the
[7:19] name of the father son and holy ghost
[7:20] but that's what jesus said
[7:23] he's telling them the exact way to be
[7:25] baptized
[7:26] then peter said unto them repent so
[7:28] that's the first thing repent
[7:31] repent then
[7:35] be baptized every one of you i like that
[7:38] it's not just
[7:38] you every one of you in the name of
[7:41] jesus christ well what does that do if
[7:43] we
[7:44] bury our brothers in baptism in the name
[7:47] of the lord jesus christ we have
[7:49] given them part of the family name
[7:53] amen that identifies them with the
[7:56] family of god amen
[7:58] uh i've told you many times before in my
[8:01] uh even
[8:02] being raised in a message you read even
[8:05] the old testament says my name my name
[8:07] my name well
[8:08] father son holy ghost is not a name
[8:11] titles to a name so that's what jesus
[8:13] was telling them i want you to baptize
[8:16] in my name
[8:20] and the name is the lord jesus christ
[8:22] not father
[8:23] father's not a name son's not a name
[8:26] holy ghost is not a name
[8:28] it's titles to a name repent and be
[8:31] baptized every
[8:32] one of you in the name of jesus christ
[8:34] for the remission of sins
[8:36] and here's the promise and you shall
[8:38] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[8:41] so here's your first route for the holy
[8:44] ghost if you want to receive the holy
[8:45] ghost
[8:46] repent be baptized be identified with
[8:49] the family
[8:52] and you shall receive the gift of the
[8:53] holy ghost for the promise what that
[8:55] promise that if you'll do these things
[8:57] isn't to you to your children
[9:00] and to all and i circle that in my bible
[9:03] all that are
[9:04] far off even as many as the lord our god
[9:07] shall call and then it was three
[9:09] thousand souls
[9:10] baptized in the name of jesus christ not
[9:13] titles father son holy ghost in the name
[9:15] of jesus christ
[9:17] for the remission of sin and you know
[9:19] what
[9:20] the 3 000 it's the bible says it was
[9:23] they were added to the kingdom
[9:24] right so they must have received the
[9:25] holy ghost that was the kingdom like
[9:27] brother daniel so this is the kingdom of
[9:29] god the holy ghost
[9:30] that anointing is going to come on you
[9:32] and going to stay on you
[9:34] not just an anointing of the holy ghost
[9:36] it's an indwelling
[9:37] but it starts by identifying yourself
[9:41] with the family
[9:43] there's no other way i could be a dale
[9:46] unless i was born one right you being
[9:49] born a black
[9:51] you know what you're still going to keep
[9:53] the name black you're still going to be
[9:54] that
[9:54] pickle i'm talking that you're talking
[9:56] about
[9:58] but we're going to baptize you and god's
[10:01] going to
[10:02] fill you with the holy ghost yeah
[10:05] you are
[10:08] i've already you we're just doing this
[10:10] to confirm
[10:12] uh you're a good young good young
[10:14] christian man so before we start let's
[10:16] pray one more time um
[10:18] brother bob black can you just pray over
[10:20] these two right here and if anybody else
[10:22] wants to be baptized please david go
[10:25] ahead this power he is
[10:26] lord jesus we thank you for this day the
[10:29] lord god i believe that these two
[10:30] brothers have a confession that
[10:32] they can't live without you lord i
[10:34] believe that when you died on the cross
[10:36] it was because you couldn't live without
[10:38] us and i pray god that you'll come down
[10:40] upon the scene today and recognize their
[10:42] testimony lord jesus
[10:44] because we know that your promise still
[10:47] lives on
[10:48] 2 000 years later lord that you you
[10:50] still are fulfilling your promise that
[10:52] you'll come live in the hearts of me and
[10:55] god i pray that you'll remember your
[10:56] promise this evening lord
[10:58] god i pray that you'll grant it that
[11:00] you'll make today a tie post that they
[11:02] can look back
[11:03] only when the devil comes with
[11:05] temptations and and lies and doubts and
[11:07] figures that
[11:08] something wasn't right lord they'll look
[11:10] back on this day and remember that they
[11:11] met every requirement
[11:13] they repented and were baptized in the
[11:15] name not a name of titles but a name by
[11:18] revelation
[11:19] god i pray that when they come up from
[11:20] the water lord that you're giving them
[11:22] something that will just live on
[11:24] and carry them through until they win
[11:26] the race lord jesus
[11:27] we ask it lord jesus believing lord god
[11:30] that you're still here and
[11:31] still remembering what you promised 2

[16:24] i remember when i came out of the water
[16:27] i remembered i was empty i had an empty
[16:30] feeling that
[16:31] that's right past anything i'd ever
[16:34] experienced in my life
[16:38] and brother dean said his angel
[16:42] well we used to baptize down there there
[16:43] was a big old tree hanging over the
[16:45] hanging over the hole he said there's an
[16:47] angel sitting in those winds
[16:49] right you know what they're clapping
[16:51] their hand
[16:58] but you know what that's the only joy
[17:00] angels get
[17:01] right we get the joy of having all this

[17:07] that's to praise god
[17:09] that's right help a new one into the
[17:12] kingdom you pray for these
[17:14] you know as well as i do though when i
[17:15] come up out of that water i felt empty a
[17:17] few days later the devil found that out
[17:20] so you be careful i might go to the
[17:23] house and just stay inside
[17:24] keep the door locked
[17:30] i wish i
[17:34] the devil knows he's only got a short
[17:36] time
[17:37] that's right devil's only got a short
[17:39] time and if he can stop you right here
[17:43] if the devil can stop you right here
[17:44] he's got your weapon

[17:48] with the family welcome these into the
[17:49] family of god amen
