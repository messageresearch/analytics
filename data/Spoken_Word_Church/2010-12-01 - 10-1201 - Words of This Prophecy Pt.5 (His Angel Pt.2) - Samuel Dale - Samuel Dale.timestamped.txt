[35:44] things that he saw blessed is he that
[35:47] readeth and they that hear the words of
[35:48] this prophecy and keep those things
[35:51] which are written therein for the time
[35:54] is at hand you may be seated I believe
[35:57] the time time is at hand because it's a
[35:59] time to understand now if you have your
[36:02] things I ran off 10 extra copies and
[36:05] just in case uh but if you have your
[36:08] copy you were supposed to bring them
[36:09] back with you uh to tonight uh from
[36:13] Sunday but if you don't have a make sure
[36:16] the ones that that don't have a copy get
[36:19] a copy of the quotes a lot of the quotes
[36:22] is things that we have quoted many times
[36:25] but we're just trying to put it all
[36:27] together in one line and to be able to
[36:32] uh speak about something and and it's
[36:34] going to take us now quite a while to be
[36:36] able to
[36:38] um speak in on
[36:41] this so I pray that you won't get bored
[36:45] uh hearing it and that you will uh you
[36:48] know that it'll be of interest to you uh
[36:52] you know we read our in the scriptures
[36:54] as we was trying to cover Sunday and we
[36:56] had a good in a company so I had to kind
[36:59] of you know walk around a little bit
[37:02] different than what I wanted to bring
[37:04] but uh we still I believe got the point
[37:07] across about what I wanted to bring now
[37:11] uh I say this again because I don't want
[37:15] you to think that I am uh you know just
[37:18] this that or the other I've been
[37:19] studying on this point of the Book of
[37:22] Revelations and you know it because this
[37:24] is message number uh five tonight and
[37:27] I've been speaking on this for quite a
[37:30] while so it's not just that someone
[37:32] comes along and says something and then
[37:35] you know uh I jump up and start on
[37:38] something to do that if you believe it's
[37:40] that way then that's up to you I can't
[37:42] convince you any other way uh Wade read
[37:45] a quote the other day and I want to try
[37:46] to get that quote uh that he read where
[37:49] brother brandham said he said if God if
[37:52] you can't do something with him I can't
[37:53] do it right so that's you know I want
[37:56] that quote because that's the way I've
[37:58] always been I've always been burdened
[38:00] because that uh you know two or three
[38:03] times in my life I've had to deal with
[38:05] situations that other people would have
[38:07] entirely dealt differently and you know
[38:11] and things like that but I I I can't
[38:13] deal the way you deal I have to be the
[38:16] way I am and doing it like that then
[38:19] sometimes I might not satisfy you about
[38:22] the way things are done but just
[38:24] remember I'm the one responsible so you
[38:28] know it's always burdened me and I used
[38:30] to pray Lord if you can't touch the
[38:32] people what can I do right and you know
[38:35] people say well just go tell them well
[38:37] where's it ever settled anything to go
[38:39] to somebody and tell them you
[38:42] know it just won't work you say oh yes
[38:45] it will just come and tell me brother I
[38:48] had two brothers in The Minister's
[38:49] meeting one time and they was both up
[38:51] talking and both of them said just tell
[38:53] me like it is I got up behind them I
[38:55] said you two don't want me to tell it
[38:58] like it
[38:59] is I mean you know they just kept on
[39:01] about it I said you two don't want me to
[39:03] tell it like it is right because it
[39:06] would be contrary to both of them you
[39:08] know I would have been saying things
[39:09] that they wouldn't have liked but that's
[39:11] just my nature and my ways I'm sorry
[39:14] that's me but you know a lot of people
[39:19] believe and it's not just because of um
[39:22] somebody as I said come through and make
[39:23] a statement about something but a lot of
[39:25] people believe that
[39:28] that brother randam was the one to that
[39:30] come to John on
[39:33] patmas and revealed a book to John and
[39:37] their statement is because that he was a
[39:39] prophet and the word comes to the
[39:42] prophet well all right now whether that
[39:46] be true or not I don't lay emphasis upon
[39:50] that my emphasis upon one thing I want
[39:53] to know who came to brother
[39:56] brandham right
[39:58] that's because if I can get to the point
[40:01] to see who came to brother brandham and
[40:03] really who it was right that came to
[40:07] brother brandham then I don't believe
[40:09] we'll be concerned too much about
[40:11] whether brother brandham come to John or
[40:12] not that would be uh you know another
[40:16] point I know what the prophet has said I
[40:19] know what he made the statements and
[40:20] things and we'll get to it eventually uh
[40:23] you know of what he said but what I want
[40:25] to do is go through the Book of
[40:26] Revelation cuz that was my
[40:28] intentions has always been to go through
[40:31] the Book of Revelations in this point
[40:33] about where that the scripture said that
[40:36] he sent and signified by his Angel unto
[40:40] John amen now I believe that there was
[40:42] an angel come to John O Baptist amen yes
[40:45] sir now I believe that because the
[40:48] scripture said it all right and I I
[40:51] believe that uh you know brother randam
[40:53] had an angel all right that came to him
[40:56] I believe is that amen all right and but
[41:00] the main point I want to get is I've
[41:02] always believed that the Bible and
[41:04] that's the reason I gave you the quotes
[41:06] right up front there I believe the Bible
[41:08] is a revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[41:11] amen now if we are part of that right
[41:15] then all right we're we can be revealed
[41:17] and made known all right amen but if
[41:19] we're not part of that Revelation then
[41:22] we have got a problem you know so I'm
[41:24] trying to find the revelation of Jesus
[41:27] Christ and then when it comes to that
[41:29] place that we get to the point then uh
[41:33] we won't worry about some of the other
[41:35] things because you know uh as I said
[41:38] this is not something new it's something
[41:40] that's been around the message for a
[41:42] long time well all right now I'm just
[41:44] I'm honest and this way I talk plain if
[41:48] it was brother randam it come to John on
[41:50] patas
[41:51] okay all right but where's that going to
[41:54] put us in Rapture if we don't know
[42:01] the Revelation that come to John O
[42:04] Batman
[42:05] right now if it's not revealed to me and
[42:07] you that's right
[42:09] see just because brother around preached
[42:12] it do you automatically have
[42:14] itess that's what I want to prove
[42:16] tonight cuz we're going to stay in this
[42:18] for a while but we're going to stay in
[42:20] it going through the Book of
[42:22] Revelations because I believe it's very
[42:24] vital to understand
[42:27] right there are are uh many things said
[42:31] in the Book of Revelation and I think
[42:32] will be very helpful unto us about these
[42:36] things all right now as one who is a
[42:39] Believer I believe in angels right amen
[42:43] I believe in angels am the prophet of
[42:45] God said ever born again believer now he
[42:49] didn't say everybody in the world right
[42:51] see we used to you know we had pictures
[42:52] all over every little baby and all over
[42:54] this that the other well brother Brown
[42:56] didn't explain that
[42:57] but he did explain that all born again
[43:00] Believers have Angels right all right
[43:03] now so you can say well all born again
[43:06] Believers have the Holy Ghost well
[43:07] that's true cuz it all going to have to
[43:09] tie together because if it's an angel
[43:12] from God right that is given unto you
[43:16] and I and we'll get to that when we get
[43:17] more in the
[43:18] scripture then that angel coming from
[43:21] God would be a part of God right amen
[43:23] would you not agree because the
[43:25] scripture calls it uh ministering
[43:28] Spirits sent forth for the hours of
[43:31] Salvation now that's a paraphrase but
[43:33] we'll get back to that scripture later
[43:35] but what I want to do is just get step
[43:38] by step through the Book of Revelations
[43:41] and I believe you'll begin to see a
[43:43] picture
[43:45] unfold and the picture that I want to
[43:47] unfold to you is one
[43:50] thing brother Ram had an angel right
[43:54] sure followed him from birth that's
[43:57] right appeared to him right as about a
[44:00] 200 lb man dressed and he seen him and
[44:02] everything talk with him that angel told
[44:06] him many things like what serpent seed
[44:08] was what different things
[44:11] was that angel directed him and told him
[44:14] I'd always be with
[44:16] you and but why didn't that angel tell
[44:20] him about the seals
[44:27] he had to have a visitation
[44:30] y of an
[44:32] Angel to tell him about the
[44:37] seals that's my point that's what I want
[44:40] you to
[44:41] see and you'll see that it'll unfold one
[44:44] of the most beautiful pictures that's
[44:46] right that has ever been to
[44:49] mankind because why didn't that angel
[44:52] tell
[44:53] him he had the Holy Ghost Why didn't it
[44:56] tell him come on
[44:57] that's
[44:58] right that's right John had the Holy
[45:01] Ghost when he's on P why didn't they
[45:03] tell him all about that that's right you
[45:05] have the Holy Ghost do you know
[45:08] everything no we'll automatically admit
[45:10] we don't see that's why I tried to
[45:13] preach about even that the Lord Jesus by
[45:16] his own ways of doing being almighty God
[45:19] he limited himself to word that he
[45:21] wouldn't even know when he's coming back
[45:25] right you said well that was just the
[45:28] flesh well don't just lay on all of it
[45:30] just being the flesh tie it together
[45:33] with the whole entire being
[45:36] right I mean don't you think that he
[45:38] could override the flesh he surely did
[45:41] and could tell them everything y right
[45:44] but you see that's where that I don't
[45:46] believe that we're following the message
[45:49] to see the real
[45:51] importance of what has happened in this
[45:54] in this last days h
[45:58] now to approach it then as I
[46:05] said get this point drive it hard into
[46:07] your
[46:10] mind if that was brother
[46:14] brandham that come to John on
[46:17] Pat where would that put you in the
[46:19] Rapture
[46:22] right well it might
[46:24] be oh yeah come on come on you was
[46:30] fixing to say it'd make me believe him
[46:31] better now butd if you can't believe
[46:34] brother randam was a prophet without
[46:36] thinking he come to John on pmas you're
[46:38] in bad shape that's right
[46:42] amen I'm in terrible shape amen if you
[46:46] can't believe God kept his word straight
[46:49] right you're in terrible shape amen now
[46:52] that's as blunt as I can be not to try
[46:54] to do anything or whatever but I wrote
[46:56] this down you
[46:59] know we better deal with who came to
[47:02] brother
[47:08] Brandon and who told Brother brandom all
[47:10] of these
[47:14] things now what I want to prove tonight
[47:17] is one
[47:21] point if the the if brother brandham
[47:26] came to join patas where did he get what
[47:29] he brought to
[47:32] John right that's right are you with me
[47:37] amen where'd he get
[47:39] it you said what it got it from the Lord
[47:42] Jesus well now let's just prove that in
[47:44] the
[47:45] Bible now let's prove it in the the
[47:48] scriptures that we've been talking
[47:50] about now I tried Sunday like I said
[47:53] with company M how in the world could I
[47:55] go through something so I done the best
[47:57] I could you go back and listen to that
[47:59] but just don't discard the message right
[48:02] because there's a lot of things said
[48:04] right that you need to have of
[48:07] understanding all right but you see now
[48:10] listen it's there on your quotes page 13
[48:13] of church age
[48:16] book that brother brandham
[48:18] said that the Book of
[48:21] Revelations is the only book
[48:26] it's Church age book P 13 I think it's
[48:29] uh one two or three of you notes okay
[48:32] let me look up here and get it number
[48:34] one on your notes page
[48:37] 13 it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[48:40] given to John for Christians of all ages
[48:43] it's the only book in the entire Bible
[48:45] that is written by Jesus
[48:47] himself though personally
[48:52] appearing to
[48:55] ascribe through
[48:57] personally appearing to ascribe right
[49:01] it's a revelation of the person of
[49:03] Christ that's right but it's not just
[49:05] the revelation of the person of Christ
[49:07] right on down below
[49:09] there see the uncovering is not not only
[49:12] the revelation of the person of Christ
[49:14] but it's the revelation of his Future
[49:16] Works in the oncoming seven Church ages
[49:21] amen look down at number two on your
[49:24] notes what a great day is ahead of us
[49:26] friends the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:28] that God gave to his Angel and come and
[49:31] signified it to John that it might be
[49:34] known through the church ages the thing
[49:36] that is in store for
[49:41] us why because it says there in
[49:43] Revelation
[49:44] 1 the Revelation that God gave to Jesus
[49:47] to give to John he said signified by an
[49:51] Angel so there's an angel involved
[49:56] all right you got all of the quotes that
[49:58] goes
[49:59] through but go down to number five on
[50:01] your notes and look at it Christ
[50:03] revealed in his own word
[50:06] 1965 but it's the revelation of Jesus
[50:09] Christ God himself revealed from word to
[50:15] flesh that's what it is the Bible is the
[50:19] word and God is the
[50:21] flesh God God is the word rather and
[50:25] Jesus being the F amen it's a revelation
[50:29] how God the word was manifested in human
[50:32] flesh and revealed to us and that's why
[50:35] he become a Son of God he is a part of
[50:41] God
[50:43] now so let's just take now before we we
[50:47] get into the thought that I want you to
[50:48] get for the night I want you to just
[50:50] follow me in the
[50:52] scriptures all right follow me who's
[50:55] talking
[50:57] let's go through I've done this one time
[50:59] you know but let's go through to get
[51:00] this lined up together at one time I
[51:04] want you to look at it now who wrote who
[51:07] was this in re in uh writing in
[51:10] Revelations 1 1 through
[51:15] three that was John right
[51:18] right John was writing down
[51:22] right what he was
[51:24] told now watch it go from John writing
[51:27] down to an angel talking to
[51:31] John to Jesus coming on the scene
[51:35] right because I'll go ahead and say it
[51:37] to you any Revelation you think you
[51:40] got if Jesus Christ won't come on the
[51:44] scene to that Revelation then it is not
[51:47] a revelation that's right blunt
[51:51] plain don't need interpreting does it
[51:54] right
[51:57] now so verse 1 2 and 3 John is telling
[52:02] you see blessed is he that readeth this
[52:04] is John talking right you all right then
[52:07] what does it say John to the seven
[52:09] Church ages the angel was telling John
[52:11] to the seven Church ages Grace be unto
[52:14] you and peace from him which is and
[52:17] which was and which is to come and from
[52:21] the seven spirits which are before the
[52:24] strong and watch that
[52:27] an angel is telling John a great
[52:32] Revelation watch it in just a minute CU
[52:35] we'll prove that if Jesus don't come to
[52:37] your Revelation is not a revelation
[52:39] that's what I'm trying to
[52:41] prove verse 5 and from Jesus Christ who
[52:45] is the faithful witness and the first
[52:48] begotten of the dead and the prince of
[52:50] the kings of the earth unto him that
[52:53] loved us and washed us from our sins in
[52:55] his own blood
[52:57] and ha made us Kings and Priests unto
[52:59] God and and and his father to him be
[53:02] glory and Dominion forever and ever
[53:05] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[53:07] ey shall see him they also which pierced
[53:09] him and all Kindred of the Earth shall
[53:12] whail because of him even so
[53:15] amen and the angel is bringing a great
[53:18] Revelation to
[53:21] John of Jesus
[53:24] Christ right
[53:27] he describes him up there in verse
[53:30] four from him which is and which was and
[53:33] which is to
[53:35] come now watch Jesus when he steps on
[53:37] the scene you say did Jesus step on the
[53:39] scene well verse 8 says red letters so
[53:41] that means Jesus
[53:44] speaking when you see it in the Bible
[53:46] that's what we're supposed to believe
[53:48] the red letter means Jesus is talking I
[53:51] believe God's talking all the way
[53:52] through but you know I'm just telling it
[53:54] like it is verse eight I am Alpha and
[53:58] Omega the beginning and the ending
[54:02] listen sayith the Lord which is and
[54:07] which was and which is to come the
[54:10] almighty
[54:12] amen they come and verify that what the
[54:15] angel said was
[54:17] true right the angel said up there this
[54:20] is the one that which is and which was
[54:22] which is to
[54:24] come now Jesus steps on the
[54:29] scene now that's not just an
[54:33] Angel that's Jesus stepping on the scene
[54:35] because the angel proclaimed it
[54:38] correctly that's what gets me about the
[54:40] people that say brother brandom was all
[54:43] messed up before the seals broke then
[54:44] the seals had to come straighten him
[54:47] out and I'd like to see
[54:50] that but they won't come and tell you
[54:53] where it's at
[54:57] oh yeah they attack like the church age
[54:58] book and say the 17 contradiction I've
[55:01] invited on tape and everywhere else to
[55:03] come and show me the 17 contradictions
[55:06] there till this day nobody's contacting
[55:09] me about it listen now what's it
[55:14] what he jumps back says I
[55:17] John now John's going to tell you what
[55:19] he's
[55:22] doing now the angel has delivered the
[55:25] message
[55:29] the angel has delivered the message to
[55:33] John that God gave him to deliver of who
[55:38] of Jesus
[55:41] Christ is that what we just read the
[55:43] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[55:45] gave unto
[55:48] him God was giving him a revelation here
[55:51] brother R said he didn't even understand
[55:53] that in those quotes right there at the
[55:54] beginning of it
[55:56] he didn't understand his part in the
[55:59] Kingdom but said when he come to John on
[56:01] patmas then he knew see he' come from
[56:04] the pillar of fire and went back to the
[56:06] pillar of
[56:07] fire he come from God and went back to
[56:11] God why because he's God the whole time
[56:13] right but he was displayed all right so
[56:16] follow
[56:17] me now John
[56:19] talks John said I John who is also your
[56:24] brother and companion in Tri in the
[56:26] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was
[56:29] in the aisle of that is called patmas
[56:31] for the word of God and for the
[56:33] testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the
[56:35] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[56:38] behind me a great voice as a of a
[56:44] trumpet I gave you a quote somewhere in
[56:47] your reading that John knew who that
[56:53] was amen I can find it as I go through
[56:55] if I don't it'll be any notes or you
[56:56] just read every one of
[56:59] them and what did he say and heard
[57:02] behind me a great voice as of a
[57:06] trumpet what's who's this this is not an
[57:11] angel this is the Lord Jesus
[57:16] Christ No Angel could say I am Alpha and
[57:20] Omega come on no angel could say what
[57:24] John said he said to John up here that
[57:26] he's the one that which is and which was
[57:28] and is to
[57:29] come no angel can say that about
[57:35] himself it was the Lord Jesus amen so no
[57:40] matter who come to John on patas we
[57:43] better be concerned about the message
[57:45] that he
[57:51] brought or else you're just in idolatry
[58:01] so follow me that's what I'm trying to
[58:02] prove that's the whole thing I've Got
[58:04] Tonight is to show one
[58:10] thing that even though an angel would
[58:12] step right down here tonight and tell us
[58:16] something it still takes the Holy Spirit
[58:19] to reveal what that angel said
[58:24] amen cuz that Angel brother Rand
[58:26] couldn't reveal nothing to you even
[58:29] Jesus said come on quote your
[58:32] Prophet brother brand said Jesus said
[58:35] even my own life did not reveal that
[58:38] unto thee why right I think it's
[58:42] uh ano some Christ Ministry I believe
[58:44] it's 74 then brother R said the Holy
[58:47] Ghost is the only revealer of the
[58:49] word right that's right no angel can't
[58:52] reveal you the word no Prophet can't
[58:54] reveal you the word
[58:57] that's
[58:59] right he can only express to you and I
[59:03] in the words right
[59:06] amen yeah but brother Dale we got what
[59:09] the prophet said amen do you know what
[59:11] that'll do that'll drive us to hell if
[59:13] it's not revealed
[59:16] amen if it's not revealed what good is
[59:19] it right
[59:22] right good look right
[59:27] John in verse 99 and 10 he's telling
[59:30] where he's at and what he's
[59:33] doing and he heard behind him a great
[59:36] voice as of a
[59:39] trumpet let's see if I can find
[59:45] it I'll run across it a minute but
[59:49] brother rown saids it like
[59:51] this said he didn't turn to see the
[59:54] person
[59:59] he knew what which number is
[1:00:04] it you got the notes you can read faster
[1:00:07] than I
[1:00:08] can okay number 14 on your notes which
[1:00:12] is 49 of the church age book The patmas
[1:00:15] Vision page 49 Revelation 1:12 and I
[1:00:19] turned to see the voices spake with me
[1:00:20] and being turned I saw seven gold and
[1:00:22] Candlestick John does not say that he
[1:00:24] turned to see the one who voice he
[1:00:27] heard
[1:00:28] right he knew that
[1:00:31] voice but he didn't turn to see that
[1:00:34] voice he knew he was there in a
[1:00:35] vision but he turned listen he didn't
[1:00:38] turn to one whose voice he heard but he
[1:00:42] turned to see The
[1:00:44] Voice y I like that he turned to see the
[1:00:48] voice the voice and the person are one
[1:00:50] in the same he knew that was almighty
[1:00:52] God
[1:00:53] Amen he knew who that was talking to him
[1:00:57] but the surprise was is what he
[1:01:00] saw I've preached this before to you
[1:01:03] right verse 11 saying I Alpha and Omega
[1:01:06] the first and the last see a prophet
[1:01:08] can't say that an angel can't say that
[1:01:15] right only God can say those things what
[1:01:18] th see us right in the book and send it
[1:01:20] unto the seven churches which are in
[1:01:21] Asia unto Ephesus unto s and unto
[1:01:24] pergamus and unto tar and un artist
[1:01:26] under Philadelphia and under lady AA and
[1:01:28] watch and I turned to see the voice that
[1:01:31] spake with me and being turned I saw
[1:01:34] seven golden
[1:01:39] candlesticks now he didn't turn to see
[1:01:41] the person like knowing it was Jesus you
[1:01:44] understand he turned to see The Voice
[1:01:47] cuz the voice and the person is the same
[1:01:50] that's right the seven golden
[1:01:51] candlesticks has got to be the the same
[1:01:53] as he is why because he and them
[1:01:57] that's why in verse 13 and in the midst
[1:01:58] of the seven candlesticks One Life unto
[1:02:00] the son of
[1:02:02] man now I've got it in here somewhere if
[1:02:05] I don't I'll get back to it maybe Sunday
[1:02:08] he saw the glorified Son of
[1:02:12] God you see he saw one in the midst of
[1:02:14] seven gold C like another son of man
[1:02:16] that's what he saw amen cuz it wasn't
[1:02:19] the son of man it was the glorified Son
[1:02:22] of
[1:02:24] God you got son that's god well don't
[1:02:27] don't get all tied up just think about
[1:02:29] what's being
[1:02:31] said where is he to be
[1:02:35] glorified according to your Prophet he's
[1:02:37] to be glorified in me and you that's
[1:02:40] right cuz he's already glorified right
[1:02:43] that's right glorify thy name already
[1:02:46] glorified it glorify it again come on
[1:02:49] and in the midst of seven can seven
[1:02:51] candlesticks one like another son of man
[1:02:53] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[1:02:55] and G about the pouch with a golden
[1:02:57] girdle
[1:02:58] watch now if you'll get this
[1:03:02] one I wrote it somewhere down in my
[1:03:04] notes I wish youd read the Sevenfold
[1:03:07] Glory of his person it's in the church
[1:03:09] age
[1:03:12] book I'll find it in a minute but if you
[1:03:14] can find it in the church AG book if
[1:03:15] you'll turn over about page 13 14 you'll
[1:03:19] start 15 turn just keep turning you'll
[1:03:21] see it s says the Sevenfold Glory of his
[1:03:24] person
[1:03:26] but now remember the
[1:03:30] point you remember what we brought
[1:03:34] out we brought out
[1:03:40] what that this was Judgment Day we've
[1:03:43] done been through
[1:03:44] this cuz he was in the spirit on the
[1:03:47] Lord's Day the Lord's day is not the
[1:03:49] Sabbath yet the prophet will call it the
[1:03:51] Sabbath The Lord's day is not
[1:03:53] Saturday the Lord's day is the Judgment
[1:03:56] Day you remember I preached a message
[1:03:58] just the other week on it or when I
[1:04:00] preached back on it some time ago that
[1:04:03] it was the Judgment Day you're looking
[1:04:06] at see cuz this is the bride of Christ
[1:04:09] sitting on the Judgment exactly like the
[1:04:11] Book of
[1:04:14] Daniel but when he turns to see it what
[1:04:16] did he see
[1:04:20] right come on we've been through it
[1:04:21] before haven't we look at number 10 on
[1:04:24] your notes
[1:04:29] paragraph 167 Patman Vision 60 1960 1204
[1:04:33] the evening service here's more proof
[1:04:35] that this Doctrine is right about the
[1:04:37] Lord's
[1:04:38] day did you notice him he was not a
[1:04:41] priest during this time neither was he
[1:04:43] King he was a
[1:04:46] judge you remember how I went through
[1:04:49] it the message is titled the Lord's day
[1:04:51] if you didn't get it go back and listen
[1:04:53] to the message
[1:04:56] the Lord's day is the Judgment Day the
[1:04:58] white Throne judgment that's
[1:05:01] right cuz that's when it fits all of the
[1:05:04] scriptures and fits
[1:05:05] Daniel notice a priest a high priest
[1:05:09] when he went into the sanctuary and went
[1:05:11] in or went in to minister to serve he
[1:05:13] tied himself around the waist tying his
[1:05:16] girdle around the waist meant that he
[1:05:18] was serving never tied it over his
[1:05:20] shoulder but here he comes out walking
[1:05:23] out with a girdle tied around the top
[1:05:26] with a s over his shoulders gted about
[1:05:29] the pouch the
[1:05:30] breast so that's not masculine it's
[1:05:33] feminine right with a golden girdle gted
[1:05:36] up high what is it an attorney of Judge
[1:05:39] a judge with his sash over his shoulder
[1:05:41] gted up here not just not down as a
[1:05:45] priest see that he shows he wasn't in
[1:05:48] his priesthood now he went all the way
[1:05:50] over into the Lord's day and saw him
[1:05:52] coming as the judge
[1:05:57] so now when you're looking at
[1:05:58] Revelations 1 you went all the way over
[1:06:00] to the Judgment Day with it that's right
[1:06:05] amen if you can see what I'm talking
[1:06:08] about see then the angel can bring the
[1:06:11] message but who's going to be setting in
[1:06:15] judgment amen you and I right but who's
[1:06:18] on the throne right
[1:06:29] judgment when over into
[1:06:33] judgment I gave you some more quotes on
[1:06:36] that CU Patman Vision number 12 on your
[1:06:39] notes sonone of righteousness healing in
[1:06:41] in his wings and now his countenance he
[1:06:44] was a judge or another thing to show
[1:06:46] that he was over into the Lord's day you
[1:06:48] believe that he went over into the
[1:06:49] Lord's day and saw the Lord as judge not
[1:06:51] his priest not his King not as but as
[1:06:54] judge he is a judge don't you believe
[1:06:56] that the Bible said he's the judge and
[1:06:58] here he was dressed as the judge showing
[1:07:01] that he had done what he was and what he
[1:07:04] was to The Sinner what he was to the
[1:07:06] Christian and here here stands now with
[1:07:10] the voice of many Waters and his
[1:07:13] countenance was like unto the sun
[1:07:14] shining in his strength what does the
[1:07:16] scripture say about many Waters the
[1:07:19] voice of many Waters people right so we
[1:07:22] set on judgment with him not in front of
[1:07:25] it to be judged right we set on the
[1:07:28] Judgment seat with him John saw all the
[1:07:32] way there in Revelations 1 over to the
[1:07:34] Judgment
[1:07:38] seat how many times do we give you this
[1:07:41] one why are we not a denomination 1958
[1:07:44] 927 and if you'll notice Revelations 1
[1:07:47] number 13 on your notes we find Jesus
[1:07:50] standing in the seven Church ages the
[1:07:52] seven golden Candlestick when he turned
[1:07:54] and saw one like the son of man standing
[1:07:57] clothed with a how was it it was a bride
[1:07:59] standing in the candlesticks draw out
[1:08:02] right right right damn it so what did
[1:08:04] John see on the patmas look down at the
[1:08:06] next one there seven Church ages 1954
[1:08:09] 512 we've read this one before right
[1:08:12] number 13 a the reason I add these A's
[1:08:15] and B's is because you know I'm not so
[1:08:16] good and other this so I have to put in
[1:08:18] some quotes every once in a while kind
[1:08:20] slide them in and hand them to Joe so
[1:08:21] when I do I give them a and b and c and
[1:08:23] d you know all that all right
[1:08:29] all right what paragraph 204 what the
[1:08:31] spirit said the candlesticks all right
[1:08:33] in the midst of the seven golden
[1:08:34] candlesticks one like the son of man
[1:08:37] what one like him who was this his bride
[1:08:41] one like him watch How It Was clothed
[1:08:44] with a garment down to the foot the
[1:08:45] Holiness of Jesus Christ covering her
[1:08:47] has washed us from our sins with his own
[1:08:50] blood G about the pouch not a man a
[1:08:53] woman amen and a golden girdle the
[1:08:55] gospel that held the power and glory of
[1:08:57] God over the body of Christ right going
[1:09:00] down he swore by himself
[1:09:03] 195422 Revelation 1 Jesus was seen or
[1:09:07] the church rather of the bride of Christ
[1:09:09] seen him standing into seven golden
[1:09:13] candlesticks and his feet was made of
[1:09:15] brce which Bryce is divine Judgment of
[1:09:18] the church out upon the world the Divine
[1:09:21] judgment so what do we need now do we
[1:09:24] need any more to be able to
[1:09:26] see now we're down to the 14 that we
[1:09:29] come to what he does not say he turned
[1:09:31] to see the one whose voice he
[1:09:36] heard but he knew who that
[1:09:40] was I mean we could be in a great big
[1:09:42] crowd and I could walk up and I say
[1:09:47] Danny he know cuz he knows my voice I
[1:09:51] can't disguise my voice on the telephone
[1:09:53] I call people try to
[1:09:56] I can't do it they I Brother
[1:09:58] D but see now watch it does John does
[1:10:04] not say that he turned to see the one
[1:10:06] whose voice he heard but he turned to
[1:10:09] see the voice
[1:10:11] right and watch him cuz he was a prophet
[1:10:14] he knew he was going to be there and he
[1:10:16] knew things was going
[1:10:19] on I like that he turned to see the
[1:10:22] voice the voice and the person are one
[1:10:23] in the same Jesus is the word then who
[1:10:26] are
[1:10:27] we you get to really see in the word you
[1:10:29] see in
[1:10:32] Jesus now watching go on down while
[1:10:35] we're at it and then we'll go back and
[1:10:36] read the
[1:10:38] scripture same message page 110 7even
[1:10:41] Church a excuse me seven Church ages
[1:10:44] 54512 he was standing in the midst of
[1:10:46] the seven golden candlesticks who is it
[1:10:50] what is this re this revelation of Jesus
[1:10:52] Christ and here he's not a prop
[1:10:56] Propet here he is the almighty God
[1:11:00] manifested the Alpha and Omega cuz
[1:11:03] that's who he said he
[1:11:05] was that's right but the catch of it is
[1:11:08] is where's he
[1:11:12] at he's showing himself in his prde amen
[1:11:17] like I've told you show me in the Book
[1:11:18] of Revelations anywhere that Jesus has
[1:11:21] ever shown by
[1:11:23] himself he shown any is right let's just
[1:11:26] go ahead and read this patas Vision
[1:11:28] number
[1:11:29] 16 60 1204 he comes down G about the PS
[1:11:34] and the things the sful glory of his
[1:11:36] person the sound of many Waters look
[1:11:37] what he says and he gets to what a
[1:11:40] vision what did he see
[1:11:42] here the glorified Son of
[1:11:46] God oh no that's son of man ni it's
[1:11:53] bride but the glorify Son of
[1:11:58] God glorified Son of
[1:12:02] God and the bride glorifies him
[1:12:07] amen so now let's read the scripture
[1:12:10] down through where we talking about and
[1:12:12] I turned to see The Voice verse 12 that
[1:12:14] spake with me and being turned I saw
[1:12:16] seven golden Candlestick in the midst of
[1:12:18] the seven candle sticks one like unto
[1:12:20] the son of man clothed with a garment
[1:12:21] down to the foot and G about the pouch
[1:12:23] with a golden G his head and his hair
[1:12:26] were white like wool as white as snow
[1:12:28] and his eyes were as a flame of fire
[1:12:30] that's Daniel 7 cuz it comes to the
[1:12:32] anent of days the white Throne
[1:12:37] judgment eyes were Fame of fire feet
[1:12:40] like UND defined Bry as if they burned
[1:12:42] in a furnace and his voice as the sound
[1:12:44] of many Waters and he had in his right
[1:12:46] hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth
[1:12:48] one a sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:12:51] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[1:12:52] his strength and when I saw him I fell
[1:12:55] at his feet as
[1:12:58] dead now look at
[1:13:00] John and he laid his right hand upon
[1:13:04] me saying unto
[1:13:07] me fear not now who's that the angel no
[1:13:11] brother R said it's not a angel it's not
[1:13:14] a
[1:13:16] prophet he said it was
[1:13:19] God come on fear not red letter right I
[1:13:23] am the first in the last a ain't no
[1:13:25] Prophet can say
[1:13:29] that keep that in mind ain't no Prophet
[1:13:31] can say I'm the first in the
[1:13:34] LI it'll help you understand the reading
[1:13:37] of the
[1:13:40] Bible I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:13:42] and behold I am alive forever more and
[1:13:44] have the keys of hell and
[1:13:47] death write the things which thou Hast
[1:13:50] seen and the things which are that's and
[1:13:53] the things which shall be here after
[1:13:56] then he explains the mystery of the
[1:13:57] church ages and you know the the
[1:13:59] candlesticks and things but what I want
[1:14:02] you to see now is this then Revelations
[1:14:05] 2 is the church
[1:14:08] edges Revelations 3 is the church edges
[1:14:11] right do you have a Scofield bible it's
[1:14:15] all red letter
[1:14:19] right that was Jesus writing
[1:14:22] himself that was Jesus revealing
[1:14:26] himself that was the Alpha and Omega
[1:14:29] making himself
[1:14:30] known where's the
[1:14:37] angel come
[1:14:40] on why does not John say he told me to
[1:14:44] do this no brother random says I think I
[1:14:48] got it in here from
[1:14:58] forgive me for just jumping around
[1:15:00] because I want to make sure you get
[1:15:02] it patmas Vision 1960 number 20 on your
[1:15:06] notes
[1:15:08] 1204 now just a little comment before we
[1:15:11] go before we read again this morning we
[1:15:12] taken the Supreme deity of the
[1:15:14] revelation of Jesus Christ who God
[1:15:15] revealed to him who God revealed
[1:15:20] him to us this morning as the Supreme
[1:15:23] deity the Great I am not I was or will
[1:15:27] be I am always and we notice in this
[1:15:30] first chapter of Revelation or the
[1:15:33] Revelation what is the revelation of
[1:15:34] Jesus Christ what's the first thing he
[1:15:36] reveals himself here as the god of
[1:15:39] Heaven not a tri God but one God one God
[1:15:42] and he re reveals himself that way in
[1:15:44] the first of the Revelation and speaks
[1:15:46] it four times in the first chapter so
[1:15:49] that there will be no mistake the first
[1:15:51] thing you got to know that he is not a
[1:15:53] prophet he is not a Je your God he is
[1:15:56] not a secondary God he is God he is God
[1:16:00] and so therefore the Revelation come
[1:16:02] came forth and we will we still continue
[1:16:06] with it tonight on down as we of the
[1:16:08] seven full Glory listen patas Vision 257
[1:16:15] paragraph and I fell at his feet my the
[1:16:17] prophet couldn't stand no more see such
[1:16:21] a vision he just he just sapped his
[1:16:24] strength and he fell down and his feet
[1:16:26] is dead and he laid his hand on it oh my
[1:16:29] not a prophet God I am the first and the
[1:16:33] last I am the first of the Revelation
[1:16:36] the last of the Revelation I'm here him
[1:16:40] he that was I'm he that is and he that
[1:16:44] will
[1:16:45] come there's somewhere in there I missed
[1:16:47] one where that I wanted to bring it to
[1:16:50] you but just remember brother R says
[1:16:56] paragraph 997 patas Vision if you find
[1:16:59] it go ahead with it but if not brother
[1:17:01] BR said Jesus said I want you to know
[1:17:03] who I am before I tell you anything
[1:17:07] else I want you to know who I am he said
[1:17:10] before I tell you anything
[1:17:12] else the last quote there you'll see is
[1:17:15] off Christ The Mystery of God reveal
[1:17:17] where the brother Brown says it's the
[1:17:18] brightest part of the mystery
[1:17:22] amen now let me ask you one question I
[1:17:25] will not speak no more on this subject
[1:17:27] of what I'm fixing to say until a later
[1:17:29] date so no need of asking
[1:17:32] me why was it that John is called the
[1:17:36] greatest of all the
[1:17:45] prophets now I've got what brother R
[1:17:47] said on that so don't worry about
[1:17:50] it but John was called the greatest of
[1:17:52] all the prophets
[1:17:55] we emphasize a lot upon and I do too
[1:17:58] that it says but the least in the
[1:18:00] kingdom is greater than John and that's
[1:18:01] true cuz John was not a born again
[1:18:03] believer in the New Testament
[1:18:05] Kingdom but he was the angel of the
[1:18:09] Covenant John was the angel of the
[1:18:12] Covenant don't mind say it that way but
[1:18:14] I won't pray no
[1:18:16] more cuz you see we're going to come
[1:18:18] back to the same thing John
[1:18:20] do exactly right we are amen going to
[1:18:24] come come back
[1:18:27] Amen to be to the
[1:18:29] place you see Church all I'm trying to
[1:18:33] get you to see
[1:18:34] is one
[1:18:36] thing everyone said hold up a point let
[1:18:38] get it one
[1:18:41] thing I don't mind
[1:18:44] quitting one
[1:18:49] thing an angel can deliver a message a
[1:18:53] prophet can deliver a
[1:18:55] message but if Jesus Christ does not
[1:18:58] step
[1:18:59] forth and vindicate that to be true come
[1:19:03] on what good is it come on Amen now you
[1:19:07] take this for whatever you want and God
[1:19:09] forgive me for the carnality of Ed but
[1:19:11] there's no difference in John Smith in
[1:19:13] all of his plates that he had than what
[1:19:16] most people have about brother brandham
[1:19:19] and the Bible and the things
[1:19:26] that's
[1:19:28] right that's but you see brother brandom
[1:19:31] it took him 30
[1:19:33] years to preach the statute of perfect
[1:19:36] man that's what he
[1:19:41] said and you know that was not even his
[1:19:43] message he was sent to bring
[1:19:45] right
[1:19:47] right not even his message he was s to
[1:19:50] bring that's right it was a restoration
[1:19:52] message
[1:19:55] see that's why that angel couldn't tell
[1:19:57] him no
[1:20:01] more that angel was sent to him that was
[1:20:04] with him all his life couldn't tell him
[1:20:05] no further than
[1:20:12] that who was it that come to
[1:20:16] John on
[1:20:20] patmas here we've shown that the angel
[1:20:24] is only
[1:20:27] deliverer but that the Lord Jesus
[1:20:30] stepped on the scene let go back and
[1:20:31] read the fourth verse fifth verse there
[1:20:34] where that that angel tells John this is
[1:20:36] the one who is and one who's to come
[1:20:39] which is and and all of that and Jesus
[1:20:42] immediately when he steps on the scene
[1:20:44] he said I'm exactly what John
[1:20:46] said I'm the one which is and which is
[1:20:49] to
[1:20:53] come there's no nobody in this world
[1:20:55] puts any more emphasis upon brother Bram
[1:20:58] in the correct order than I
[1:21:01] do but he's not among
[1:21:04] God and he can't reveal a thing to me
[1:21:08] right if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:11] that's why you don't know it that's
[1:21:12] right amen well I just can't understand
[1:21:16] why brother brand one of the biggest men
[1:21:18] of this
[1:21:19] message he said brother Brown made so
[1:21:22] many slips of the tongues on the message
[1:21:23] of uh Feast of the trumpets that you
[1:21:26] can't understand what he's
[1:21:28] saying you better go read that book CU
[1:21:30] brother or listen to tape cuz brother R
[1:21:32] said this is thus sayith the Lord that's
[1:21:34] right that shows our carnality that's
[1:21:38] why because we can't put together things
[1:21:42] cuz brother R said on on Feast of the
[1:21:44] trumpet that the seventh Church age
[1:21:47] messenger Meli 4 comes between the sixth
[1:21:50] and seventh
[1:21:52] trumpet and he says all trumpets is the
[1:21:54] isual and all trumpets sound under the
[1:21:56] six seal so so that would automatically
[1:21:59] look like it' put brother brandham over
[1:22:01] there but in the
[1:22:04] tribulation but it can't put him over
[1:22:06] there cuz if it did mean You' be over
[1:22:10] there you see because statements are
[1:22:12] made by a
[1:22:14] prophet and people try to carnally
[1:22:17] understand them that's
[1:22:19] right or calculate them
[1:22:25] it's just the same way of Daniel 70
[1:22:27] weeks when they around come up and he
[1:22:29] said there's in the Daniel 70 weeks he
[1:22:31] said there's one week left after the
[1:22:34] Rapture and yet they went haywire in the
[1:22:36] seal books everywh else and brother R
[1:22:38] said no no no no no you didn't
[1:22:40] understand me never did I believe
[1:22:42] Jesus's
[1:22:44] Ministry they're talking one thing he's
[1:22:46] talking about something else that's
[1:22:48] right
[1:22:49] right we better get to Revelation that's
[1:22:52] right but my point tonight is one thing
[1:22:55] thing even though an angel a prophet
[1:22:59] could sit down in your home and explain
[1:23:03] the Bible to the detail right it would
[1:23:06] still take the Holy Spirit to reveal it
[1:23:09] amen cuz he's the only revealer of the
[1:23:12] word and if he's the only revealer of
[1:23:14] the word then he's the one I'm looking
[1:23:17] forward
[1:23:20] to you never noticed I give it to you
[1:23:22] the other day so
[1:23:25] you had never noticed that brother
[1:23:26] randam kept saying we're looking for a
[1:23:28] great one to
[1:23:30] come oh he was just throwing you off on
[1:23:33] that because he was that one oh where
[1:23:37] did he become
[1:23:44] it you
[1:23:46] see then that made a lot of people run
[1:23:48] along and they say I'm the great
[1:23:51] one he come to introduce me oh lord
[1:23:57] well they've all went by the grave so
[1:24:00] far you said well he did
[1:24:03] too yeah but he'll
[1:24:07] raise all them that holler I'm the great
[1:24:10] one they're not going to raise until the
[1:24:13] Judgment that's right and then they'll
[1:24:14] find out that's right but we're just
[1:24:17] chapter one chapter two
[1:24:24] chapter 4 John hears a
[1:24:28] voice was that the voice of the
[1:24:33] angel or was it the voice of the
[1:24:40] Lord I just ask simple
[1:24:43] questions well you confuse us no no no
[1:24:47] now he's already confused I didn't
[1:24:49] confuse you I'm sorry he was already
[1:24:52] confused
[1:24:54] brother random I was listening to him
[1:24:56] the other day on the tape and boy he was
[1:24:58] raking down on something on
[1:24:59] predestination he said now I'm not
[1:25:01] trying let's see if I can remember the
[1:25:02] exact wording I'm not trying to to
[1:25:06] condemn people or something he said I'm
[1:25:09] just preaching the
[1:25:12] gospel he said I'm just telling the
[1:25:14] truth about
[1:25:16] it so you can think that you're arguing
[1:25:19] fussing and screaming about something
[1:25:22] no I fa this Doctrine
[1:25:26] before I faced it and had to sit down
[1:25:29] and tell a person I didn't agree
[1:25:32] with I've been there before and seen
[1:25:34] these
[1:25:36] things the only emphasis I have is one
[1:25:39] thing that angel can't deliver nothing
[1:25:42] to you and
[1:25:44] I that Prophet can't deliver nothing to
[1:25:47] you and
[1:25:48] I he can deliver the word yes
[1:25:53] right it was already written right
[1:25:57] brother rown couldn't add anything to
[1:25:59] what was written right
[1:26:03] right but you see light had not shined
[1:26:07] on it that's right when the prophet
[1:26:09] preached his message it brought it to
[1:26:13] light but it still takes the Holy Spirit
[1:26:15] to reveal it if you don't have the Holy
[1:26:18] Spirit you're just as blind as you ever
[1:26:21] was am and can't understand
[1:26:26] yeah yet you say oh that's in Deep thing
[1:26:30] about stay away from there why the Holy
[1:26:32] Spirit WR
[1:26:35] right right amen
[1:26:40] yeah amen Jesus said I sent my
[1:26:44] angel and I told him what to tell
[1:26:51] you but he can't the angel can't reveal
[1:26:56] it
[1:26:59] right your Prophet said I am nothing but
[1:27:03] a trumpet he said a trumpet is totally
[1:27:07] mute unless someone blows it
[1:27:17] right he said one day I used to think
[1:27:21] that Jesus loved me and God hated
[1:27:26] me your Prophet said
[1:27:29] that he said I found out it St same
[1:27:32] person that's
[1:27:36] right so that's the point now come
[1:27:39] on that's the point I want you to
[1:27:42] see that no matter who brings what to
[1:27:49] you it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal
[1:27:53] it amen amen now let me put one more
[1:27:57] point to
[1:27:58] it and if the Holy Spirit reveals it the
[1:28:02] Holy Spirit can make it manifest right
[1:28:06] the prophet cannot make it manifest
[1:28:14] right now you show me where you
[1:28:18] can and I'll go back and tell you that
[1:28:21] he would stand there and say you you
[1:28:24] know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on
[1:28:27] him I can't do a thing till he
[1:28:31] comes you might order read a little on
[1:28:34] those things because sometimes he's
[1:28:37] talking about the angel that walked with
[1:28:40] him and sometimes he's talking about
[1:28:43] Jesus
[1:28:46] Christ that's why it's so
[1:28:53] close you see we make angels to be
[1:28:55] angels and that's right they are Earthly
[1:29:00] Angels but if there's not a Heavenly
[1:29:04] Angel we've lost the whole
[1:29:10] story brother Dale can preach to you
[1:29:12] till he turns blue in the face but you
[1:29:14] can't see it until God reveals it to you
[1:29:17] and I know that that's why I don't mind
[1:29:19] going over it and over it and over it
[1:29:24] because I know and realize it you can't
[1:29:26] get it until God reveals it to
[1:29:29] you am I right does the scripture say
[1:29:33] that no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:29:36] except It Be by let me quote your
[1:29:39] Prophet on that scripture he said unless
[1:29:41] it be by the Holy
[1:29:46] Ghost cuz you're just saying what
[1:29:48] somebody else
[1:29:52] said he said you can call call him Jesus
[1:29:55] Jesus and not getting nothing you know
[1:29:58] why cuz you're saying what somebody else
[1:30:00] says about
[1:30:05] Jesus well brother Dale you're just so
[1:30:07] dried and cut and everything else and
[1:30:10] these other brothers even they preach ER
[1:30:12] I just feel so
[1:30:18] good we get over on the other side it
[1:30:20] ain't going to be worried about that
[1:30:22] right
[1:30:26] it bothers me because that I can't
[1:30:28] preach like
[1:30:30] others I cry and I pray and I ask God to
[1:30:33] help me I can't be with Just What I
[1:30:40] Am I can't have be nothing but just what
[1:30:42] I am and that's the way I believe
[1:30:46] God I just believe what he
[1:30:50] says if I hold it up in this red letter
[1:30:54] I just believe Jesus spoke that that's
[1:30:56] how much I believe it but you know what
[1:30:59] I believe God spoke the whole thing it
[1:31:02] don't I've always told you it don't
[1:31:03] always be red letter all the way through
[1:31:06] because it's God talking to us whether
[1:31:08] he uses prophets Angels or who he using
[1:31:12] he's talking to us right right now let
[1:31:15] me say it this
[1:31:17] way an angel came to Mary
[1:31:24] and brought a
[1:31:27] message but he never put the seed in her
[1:31:29] wound
[1:31:31] right is that true right that's right he
[1:31:34] only told her what would take place
[1:31:39] right he said the Holy Ghost will
[1:31:41] overshadow
[1:31:43] you
[1:31:46] amen the
[1:31:48] disciples walking with the Lord Jesus
[1:31:51] that's right yep right
[1:31:54] he told him he said okay boys come on
[1:31:56] back in sit down up you in the upper
[1:31:58] room and keep your mouth shut cuz you'll
[1:32:01] mess it
[1:32:03] up I'll be
[1:32:05] back amen and even though they could
[1:32:08] deliver the message on the day of
[1:32:09] Pentecost even though Peter after
[1:32:12] receiving the Holy Ghost could bring the
[1:32:15] message y he could still couldn't put
[1:32:18] that Holy Ghost in them people's heart
[1:32:20] that's right
[1:32:22] amen if you don't get nothing nothing
[1:32:24] else that's all I want you to get all
[1:32:26] right that's right they worth it tonight
[1:32:28] for me amen for you to see one thing
[1:32:31] right it takes God to reveal
[1:32:35] amen that's right no matter who tells
[1:32:38] you it takes God to reveal right youve
[1:32:41] heard brother random talk about Moses
[1:32:44] now there's two or three different ways
[1:32:46] it's said in there now you put it
[1:32:48] together do what you want to one time he
[1:32:49] says that Moses sits on on his mother's
[1:32:53] knee two or three years old and said she
[1:32:55] says you're not the son of Charles and
[1:32:59] brandom other times he said somewhere 15
[1:33:02] years old or something you know
[1:33:04] different something it comes and and
[1:33:07] Moses realizes it it's all
[1:33:10] right I said Charleson El say you're not
[1:33:14] the son of Pharaoh's daughter right
[1:33:19] okay you're not the son of Pharaoh's
[1:33:22] daughter you're a
[1:33:25] Jew but you know
[1:33:29] what he got ready
[1:33:32] yeah but all he got out of all that he
[1:33:35] could do and all that he believed about
[1:33:38] what he was he got brother R let me
[1:33:40] quote him a stinking dead Egyptian
[1:33:43] that's and that's what he went saying
[1:33:46] that's that's all M has got am out of
[1:33:49] all the years he said five minutes in
[1:33:53] front of the burning
[1:33:54] Bush was more than all the 40 Years of
[1:33:57] his mother
[1:33:59] Telly that's right he got something
[1:34:02] personal that's
[1:34:04] right you better pray for God to give
[1:34:06] you a
[1:34:10] revelation cuz that's the only way it's
[1:34:12] going to make it out of here that's the
[1:34:14] thing what we got brother 288 and red

[1:42:47] statement home with
[1:42:49] you could you see I know how people do
[1:42:52] that listening to tapes and I wasn't
[1:42:54] going to say that but most people that
[1:42:57] listen to tapes they cut it off quick as
[1:42:59] you get the people to come up to the
[1:43:00] altar they don't wait I mean you know
[1:43:02] they don't wait for the rest of the
[1:43:03] story that's all right so they don't
[1:43:06] care the rest of the
[1:43:09] story see God is trying to reveal
[1:43:14] himself amen do you and
[1:43:18] me but he's in you and me trying to
[1:43:20] reveal itself right he's not revealing
[1:43:23] the god off up you under somewhere
[1:43:25] you he's revealing himself right
[1:43:28] way father we love
[1:43:30] you we thank
[1:43:32] you we ask you to just go with us now
[1:43:35] and help us to understand reveal
[1:43:38] yourself unto us
[1:43:40] Lord through the opening of your word
[1:43:43] because that's the only way we can see
[1:43:44] you and know for sure where we
[1:43:47] stand we love you and we thank you thank
[1:43:51] you for sending a prophet in this last
[1:43:52] day Lord unto us that you could speak
[1:43:56] through but then if you don't reveal
[1:43:59] what he said then it won't be no good
[1:44:02] anyway it'll only be a
[1:44:04] condemnation be like Paul said the
[1:44:06] letter kill it but the spirit giveth
[1:44:10] life be with the people on the way home
