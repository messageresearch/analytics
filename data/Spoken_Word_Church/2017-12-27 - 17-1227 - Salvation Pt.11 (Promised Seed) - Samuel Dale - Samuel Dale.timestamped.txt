[0:00] my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart
[0:06] I want to see you I want to see you open
[0:19] the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes
[0:24] of my heart to see you name an I want to
[0:34] see you to see you
[0:42] that's your desire to raise him up more
[0:49] power and love as we hold
[0:56] [Music]
[1:02] shining in a man in a minute I want to
[1:41] see him don't you good to be in the
[1:43] house of Lord good to see everybody out
[1:44] tonight we're down some denied you know
[1:48] we had more Saturday night then there is
[1:50] your night I guess cuz we had a pretty
[1:52] good crowd there Saturday night we
[1:54] expect him to be way down but everything
[1:56] worked out it's good to see everybody
[1:59] and had he coming to a close of this
[2:02] year and the ending it up and looking
[2:05] forward to our brother on this coming
[2:07] Sunday night as he brings the word of
[2:10] the Lord unto us and really in the year
[2:12] out and go into another year and that
[2:16] way then we know see we're getting one
[2:18] day closer every day to one way or the
[2:22] other I like what brother Carroll said
[2:24] one time he said Lord don't do something
[2:27] he said I'm going one way or the other I
[2:29] was he was 80 something years old so
[2:31] then that's that's about the truth okay
[2:34] if you like turning these crypts return
[2:36] to Jonah to where we've been reading and
[2:38] then we'll read again on Romans nine
[2:41] that we was there Saturday and try to
[2:43] bring our thought to an end and then the
[2:48] Lord willing after the first of the year
[2:50] try to get into the New Testament
[2:52] because trying to bring the Old
[2:54] Testament part to a close and I hope
[2:57] you've listened because what has been
[2:59] our thought that all the Old Testament
[3:01] is the types and shadows of the New
[3:05] Testament to come all right but then it
[3:08] would have to be that
[3:10] whatever's in the Old Testament would
[3:12] have to come forth into a greater
[3:15] manifestation yes and things but yet
[3:19] would just be more of the same salvation
[3:23] our greater are bringing it into light
[3:25] and understanding it's not changing it
[3:28] it's not you're saved by this over here
[3:31] every what was the point now listening
[3:34] tonight ever what was the point of
[3:36] salvation in the Old Testament has got
[3:39] to be the point of the New Testament
[3:40] right you can't change and have one one
[3:44] thing and one another and then you will
[3:48] see why that it has to be brought in
[3:50] order when we get Darth Jonah to Lord
[3:56] Jesus just bless us tonight as we come
[3:59] to read your word and just let it be you
[4:01] take care of us
[4:02] we love you and we thank you in Jesus
[4:04] name Amen all right what is our thought
[4:07] but I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[4:12] what with the voice of Thanksgiving I
[4:15] will pay that I have vowed salvation is
[4:19] of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the
[4:22] fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the
[4:25] dry land let's go over to Roman's 9
[4:33] because now this relates back because
[4:35] there's a lot of in Romans 9 that is
[4:38] going back and is picking up the Old
[4:40] Testament and bringing it out and that's
[4:42] why I want to keep using it Paul says I
[4:46] say the truth in Christ I lie not my
[4:49] conscience also bearing me witness in
[4:51] the Holy Ghost that I have great
[4:53] heaviness and continual sorrow in my
[4:55] heart for I would wish that myself were
[4:58] accursed from Christ for my brethren my
[5:02] kinsmen according to the flesh now
[5:04] that's that's a mighty powerful
[5:07] statement to say that you would if you
[5:09] could just take you out of the way
[5:11] Savior your kin folks your kinsmen not
[5:16] just your kin folks but your kinsmen
[5:19] listen for who are Israelites to whom
[5:22] pertaineth the adoption and
[5:24] lowering the covenants and the giving of
[5:26] the law and the service of God and the
[5:28] promises now you could take six months
[5:31] on that one scripture that would be no
[5:35] problem because who are Israelites you'd
[5:37] have to cover that not all the Israel
[5:40] special whom pertaining to the adoption
[5:42] if we study of any adoption in the right
[5:45] across you've got to pick it up from the
[5:47] Old Testament that's my point that's my
[5:50] point is you read those scriptures and
[5:53] it'll keep unveiling the promise of God
[5:56] coming across and whose are the fathers
[5:59] and aluminous concerning the flesh
[6:01] Christ came who is over all God blessed
[6:05] for heaven amen
[6:06] not as though the Word of God hath taken
[6:08] none effect for they are not all Israel
[6:12] which are of Israel neither because they
[6:15] are the seed of Abraham are they all
[6:18] children but in Isaac shall thy seed be
[6:22] called
[6:24] once now that is they which are the
[6:27] children listen they which are the
[6:31] children of the flesh these are not the
[6:34] children of God but the children of the
[6:37] promise are counted for the seat you may
[6:41] be seated the Lord at his blessing to
[6:44] the reading of the word now if I get to
[6:45] coughing and sneezing and ice all right
[6:48] don't worry about let me say this now
[6:51] before we get started
[6:53] and the point now there's been too much
[6:58] entirely no deacons deacons are the
[7:05] policemen of the church right why do you
[7:11] need deacons in the church you're not
[7:14] supposed to have deacons to keep the
[7:16] laity people that are members of that
[7:19] church come on
[7:26] they are to control the strangers that
[7:29] come in the visitors and things they
[7:33] should never have to speak to anyone who
[7:36] is a born-again Christian come on if I'm
[7:45] wrong God you show me where I'm wrong
[7:47] the Deacons should never have to speak
[7:49] to a born-again Christian to tell them
[7:51] things it's doing wrong that's why I
[7:55] always say it this way if we're no
[7:57] further up the road then all I can do
[7:58] tonight is preach on her and dress of
[8:00] clothes that's part of the Word of God
[8:04] and it's got its right place glory and
[8:08] we do that but if that's all we can do
[8:11] then let's eat drink and be merry
[8:14] because tomorrow we die then forget the
[8:17] whole thing you know but listen there's
[8:19] been an entirely too much talking I mean
[8:22] coming from backdoor walking up here now
[8:24] get in there and I'm telling you I come
[8:28] up through there a lot of times and I
[8:30] said lord please let them understand
[8:33] people will be sitting talking and me
[8:35] coming up to go into the study
[8:44] I used to look through the window and I
[8:47] see you talking that should never be
[8:51] done Church that should never be done
[8:57] you realize this is the house of God we
[9:02] don't have to have now listen we don't
[9:04] have to have brother branham to tell us
[9:06] the things ought to be done right in the
[9:08] church but we do have a vindicated
[9:11] prophet that told us the way God loved
[9:15] it to be done right we in the Baptist
[9:20] Church we didn't run all over the church
[9:22] and holler and scream
[9:24] you didn't where you came from you
[9:30] didn't do it it's it's an embarrassing
[9:35] to say going on the internet system that
[9:40] a lot of you are just sitting talking
[9:42] and doing things getting up and going
[9:44] into it and a deacon has got to control
[9:49] that when you were born-again christian
[9:52] didn't know what the prophets say it he
[9:55] said nothing shouldn't be spoken here
[9:57] outside of worship and you know what he
[10:02] said meaning right somebody comes up you
[10:05] say something this say meet you outside
[10:09] we'll talk outside Lord bless you
[10:13] there's no problem with saying Lord
[10:15] bless you god bless you there's no
[10:17] problem but when you carry on the
[10:20] conversation now if you don't believe it
[10:26] go back and listen to Saturday services
[10:30] at the end of the service I said it this
[10:33] loud I said no talking it didn't stop
[10:44] didn't even hear me that loud I said
[10:50] I said no talking you don't believe me
[10:55] go play the tape it's embarrassing I
[11:04] should never have to be doing to
[11:06] Christians our deacons instructed
[11:11] visitors comes in if they're talking
[11:14] don't go over to chat up in here now
[11:16] we've got a house of the Lord because
[11:18] you're in worse shape than they are you
[11:20] got the wrong attitude and they have it
[11:21] because they don't know right I'll tell
[11:27] you right now with honesty and my heart
[11:31] is broken you won't stop it you won't
[11:40] stop it you've been told over and over
[11:44] and over not to talk not to let your
[11:48] kids what the prophets say just a kid he
[11:53] said just a kid running in a church
[11:55] would hinder the next service
[11:58] now the next service has got to be six
[12:00] or eight hours later maybe our week
[12:03] later you mean God is that you didn't do
[12:13] it an Old Testament you would have got
[12:18] taken care of in a hurry if you'd have
[12:20] been running back and forth there may be
[12:25] more than what you think even when
[12:30] you're up here you have to come up here
[12:34] in practice come on listen Church see
[12:36] I'll try to say something you don't want
[12:37] us to practice
[12:39] I'll get that before a month from that
[12:43] or a week from now somebody will say
[12:45] that to me I'm gonna say it here you're
[12:51] not supposed to be up here life and
[12:53] hollering and screaming back and forth
[12:54] laughing and talking to each other and
[12:56] kids running up and down the aisle and
[12:58] beating by I started up here last win
[13:03] when whenever there was practicing
[13:06] somebody stopped me from coming up and
[13:09] I'm glad they did I said I've got to go
[13:12] up start they're running oh they're
[13:14] practicing practicing what how to run
[13:18] down stars I could hear a boom boom boom
[13:21] boom bum bum bum or I could hear head
[13:24] down stars
[13:30] the you've offended me brother Dale you
[13:35] know brother would be made a good point
[13:36] one time I've never been that strong but
[13:42] he said if people won't honor and be
[13:46] right and do right in the church they
[13:49] ought not be there I had to agree with
[13:55] him don't not be there if you can't
[13:59] honor and respect the church and the
[14:02] doings up here I'm talking about from
[14:04] the star way up and talking about the
[14:07] tape room I'm talking about the nursery
[14:10] I'm gonna ever work if you can't do it
[14:13] now a lot of you have caught on a little
[14:18] bit with us playing the tape brother
[14:20] branham for about 20 minutes but a lot
[14:23] of your outside yakking talking i mean
[14:27] you ought to be up your listening
[14:29] preachers deacons
[14:38] That's not me we play the tape you were
[14:43] to be up here just down the life and
[14:44] talk okay see when you're up here
[14:55] practice in church you got to call out a
[14:58] song you got to do it honey
[15:00] you got to do that but I come through
[15:02] and walk walking and I hear you just die
[15:05] laughing that's enough this is a house
[15:16] of God
[15:21] this is not a stage or a show thing to
[15:24] put on it's the house of God what if
[15:31] your life in talking would stop someone
[15:35] else from being able to receive that day
[15:39] what they need from God cultures we're
[15:48] trying to get across a point the other
[15:49] day one you know the Bible says will up
[15:51] will give an account right of the deeds
[15:56] done in the body you see we try to make
[15:58] that it's not being born-again Christian
[16:01] but come on it's talking about mourn
[16:03] again Christians and that's what's your
[16:04] profits it and that's what Paul says
[16:09] that's who is talking about what if you
[16:17] just buy some now I'm gonna say it this
[16:20] way some of you sire it up when I
[16:23] started what if that sort of spot
[16:26] hinders the spirit to where it can't
[16:28] work tonight
[16:37] you're gonna give an account someday for
[16:40] that brother day well you want us to do
[16:45] leave the wrong attitude is what I want
[16:49] to leave I've never tried to run nobody
[16:52] off but the wrong attitude shouldn't be
[16:56] around here it's hard to come out here
[17:02] and preach when you got a burden heart
[17:05] for this little silly things or somebody
[17:10] I see you while I'm preaching that
[17:16] you're talking to one another
[17:24] well we're discussing the message don't
[17:30] don't do it the best thing for me to say
[17:38] is one thing you need to you should know
[17:40] better
[17:40] if you're a Christian if you've ever
[17:45] heard the prophets message about the
[17:48] order of the church and I'm gonna say it
[17:52] this way I doubt if half of you have
[17:54] ever heard what wrote a random has said
[17:57] about the church in the order other than
[18:00] maybe what somebody has read to you how
[18:03] many of these ever went into
[18:06] Konak order and doctrine message you
[18:09] just read the whole book and find out
[18:12] what's there and what the prophets said
[18:19] or are we like the brother that was his
[18:23] wife was they were listening to a tape
[18:28] brother branham and brother Branham was
[18:30] laying down pretty heavily on what
[18:32] something that that brother didn't agree
[18:33] with and his wife said you ought to
[18:36] listen to that he grabs the type of
[18:38] slings it out or in the car something's
[18:40] that ain't no man don't tell me what to
[18:43] now where's that person going to be
[18:47] I don't care who's the preacher I mean I
[18:51] don't make light of the Pope I ain't
[18:53] gonna make no light of the Pope cuz you
[18:56] know what he's anointed what if you're
[19:00] making fun of the anointing it's been
[19:02] thinking you're making fun of my hand
[19:03] I made no light of the Pope uh-huh
[19:06] nobody gonna kiss his toe but I ain't
[19:09] gonna make no light of it made it I'll
[19:11] call him brother don't let no light of
[19:17] him okay about it we teach our children
[19:26] to do things what do they do I always
[19:35] told my kids I said you whip him kids
[19:38] for doing something you used to do
[19:41] you're in bad shape you were to explain
[19:45] to them kids
[19:46] the reason I'm spanking you is because I
[19:49] know what I done and what it calls me to
[19:51] do and I want to correct you and make
[19:52] you right that's bad be all right these
[19:56] children are what you never move now
[19:59] okay we end it with the Bible 42
[20:02] children lost their lives because of the
[20:08] families the mamas and daddies making
[20:12] lot of the profit you said we ain't no
[20:16] scripture for that ain't no Scripture if
[20:19] you'd argue against it for some reason

[20:31] old bald head 42 children what if your
[20:37] children now you're not gonna like this
[20:39] one at all but you put it down and sit
[20:42] on it what if your children don't want
[20:44] the messages because of you have you
[20:48] ever apologized to your children for
[20:49] being wrong in front of them and no

[22:56] one day that crowd to God for your souls
[23:08] there were one of you by name pray for
[23:16] God to help us all yeah you think I
[23:24] don't love you if I didn't love you I
[23:27] wouldn't do you the truth I don't have
[23:32] to preach I was reading that today the
[23:34] Prophet and God said I don't have to
[23:38] preach to be saved I don't have to
[23:46] preach to be sunny I'm priest cause I'm
[23:48] saved
[23:50] cuz I'm trying my best to help you
[23:53] understand what life of a Christian
[23:58] should be I'm sorry then if I don't
[24:04] agree you don't agree with my ways of
[24:06] being I'm sorry but that's the way we go
[24:15] okay
[24:23] Lord just help us all to understand we
[24:28] love you and we think in Jesus name okay
[24:32] what have we been doing okay we've been
[24:36] talking about the Old Testament form of
[24:39] salvation all right we firmly stated
[24:44] over and over to you about it that there
[24:49] was a salvation back tyre in the Old
[24:52] Testament of deliverance all right that
[24:57] salvation saved those people it provided
[25:03] them a place to go to when they died
[25:07] proven they were saved because it wasn't
[25:11] that for everybody it was only there for
[25:15] the ones who believed it salvation and
[25:25] knowing that salvation it was back tyre
[25:29] was only as a top because it did not
[25:34] bring them eternal life in their soul
[25:39] you remember how we started out the
[25:41] story of it
[25:42] Adam had eternal life your prophet said
[25:47] it but then Adam died did he go to hell
[25:57] no no he just never reached eternal life
[26:04] in flesh but he was the example that we
[26:13] should have all come that away but we
[26:15] didn't come that way all right
[26:17] so salvation was back there grace was
[26:21] back there we've been over and over and
[26:23] over
[26:23] grace was way before the law grace was
[26:26] before man ever come on the earth
[26:28] grace was before the foundation of the
[26:31] world
[26:33] the lamb stood is you know the slain
[26:36] before
[26:37] the world grace was dire graces the
[26:39] Prophet said is the oldest thing there
[26:41] is they said you got a new religion he
[26:44] said no this is the oldest religions
[26:46] ever been grace so then the old
[26:51] testament would be based upon grace well
[26:54] then surely we can understand that a new
[26:56] testament will come forth based upon
[26:58] grace not greasy grace not this grace
[27:05] but grace that withstand all things and
[27:10] god will bring us to the right place we
[27:16] ended up our thoughts on Saturday night
[27:18] they're speaking about what is the seed
[27:24] of Abraham because the Old Testament
[27:30] salvation now I know he didn't come and
[27:34] I know you got had him I know you got
[27:36] Noah no no you got a lot of people but
[27:41] just remember that the place provided
[27:46] for mankind to go to was thought so much
[27:50] of it would be called paradise yes but
[27:55] what would it be called in the Bible
[27:57] riding the bosom of Abraham which was
[28:04] not a badly of Abraham Hummer
[28:06] it was a carrying device and holding it
[28:10] like him
[28:11] what was it it was the faith of Abraham
[28:19] then do you realize it was almost 3,000
[28:23] years coming from Adam and Noah and down
[28:27] to to Abraham and all of those people
[28:34] back there was waiting on a faith man to
[28:39] walk out that God could look at that man
[28:45] and say there the man I want
[28:50] Adam was the example you had a lot of
[28:54] problems Abraham was the father what we
[29:01] call the father of faith that's what
[29:02] will end this with it going into the New
[29:04] Testament we got to end it on the faith
[29:06] of Abraham because the New Testament
[29:10] will be the faith of Abraham brought
[29:12] into a manifestation I've got the quotes
[29:15] were brethren and we'll get to it in a
[29:16] minute said what is the seed of Abraham
[29:17] he said abraham believed God then he
[29:22] says now to the Gentiles
[29:24] what is the seed of Abraham to the
[29:27] Gentiles
[29:28] he said the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[29:32] do you realize had there been no man
[29:35] called Adam
[29:36] I mean Abraham there would have been no
[29:39] faith seed and when we start that New
[29:43] Testament why would it be if you have to
[29:48] start the New Testament a justification
[29:59] which is that time only means chopping
[30:04] off we'll get to that see we're going to
[30:11] go over into the New Testament why would
[30:14] it start with justification why would
[30:17] Jesus tell Nicodemus you must be born
[30:18] again you gotta be more into water in
[30:20] spirit you gotta be born a justification
[30:22] Saint case the baptism one only goes and
[30:27] Nicodemus couldn't follow that but
[30:31] that's what the Old Testament declared
[30:32] that's what we we've got to get to see
[30:34] all right who didn't it so marvelous how
[30:39] things would wind up if the Old
[30:43] Testament is going to wind up and get
[30:47] wind up back our being that one man
[30:54] believed God
[30:56] so much I found forward I found another
[31:02] one another day
[31:03] oh how that abraham believed God and it
[31:10] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[31:17] what is the seed of Abraham brother
[31:20] branham it's a faith seed it's not a
[31:27] natural seed put in it odd how that the
[31:35] Bible would declare that Abraham would
[31:39] have many sons that runs at eleven one
[31:45] time he says seven you can argue back
[31:46] and forth that's what gets me in a way
[31:48] that makes me sick for people to argue
[31:51] how many it was instead of taking what
[31:54] brother branham say it if it wasn't but
[31:56] Isaac in each small you got enough to
[31:59] make his point when I found this I found
[32:03] that one I found that for you found out
[32:05] well that's really great makes it
[32:09] marvelous listen what did brother
[32:13] Brennan say from where as we were
[32:15] reading I told him we would not read all
[32:17] of these we would just quote a lot of
[32:18] when the message call to Israel in the
[32:20] church where brother Branham say it he
[32:25] said Abraham had eleven sons but he said
[32:31] he only had one son I promise right only
[32:40] one son from Sarah right one promised
[32:50] son in all of those were his children
[32:57] natural genetic well you go to there
[32:59] what he call natural seed literally from
[33:03] Abraham he never got to promise
[33:09] Ede until he got the change of the body
[33:13] right he went to the believing it
[33:17] circumcisions and got a change of the
[33:20] body then he got Isaac
[33:22] there was the seat of promise okay in
[33:29] Isaac only one promised son I still in
[33:35] Israel in the church well it's a
[33:38] different message one of them was one
[33:40] place one uh only one selling out of how
[33:45] many he had it was the only one that was
[33:48] promised and that was Isaac
[33:54] well I that looks partial don't that
[33:57] looks that looks you know that looks huh
[33:59] it looks like God is doing this thing
[34:01] wrong every one of them other children
[34:06] got blessings and blessings and
[34:09] blessings and blessing even a small got
[34:11] great blessings and great things and
[34:13] said all of this would come out of you
[34:15] and all these thing it was a promise
[34:18] seed to come through Sarah not through
[34:23] Hagar to come through Sarah and it would
[34:28] be then the seed of Abraham by faith
[34:33] he'd be the promised seed so we read it
[34:39] in Romans nine and seven in Isaac shall
[34:42] thy seed be called the Covenant was made
[34:48] with Abraham but then it was made with
[34:50] Isaac and then were Isaac's descendants
[34:53] and from Isaac came Jacob right David
[34:58] all of the coming down through from
[35:03] Isaac Hebrews 11 and 18 says of whom it
[35:12] was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be
[35:16] called one
[35:21] seed come through Isaac Genesis 21 and
[35:29] 12 in Isaac shall thy seed be called not
[35:40] a natural seed promised seed what then
[35:47] is the seat of promise message seeds not
[35:55] out with a shuck number 7 Abraham's seed
[35:59] was his faith seed not natural was his
[36:05] faith seat anything natural 7 a spoken
[36:14] words regional seed three DS what is the
[36:21] seed of Abraham now not his flesh Paul
[36:24] said you that's a Jew outwardly that's
[36:26] Romans what did it 3 or 4 from we're
[36:29] gonna I got it written now is not as you
[36:31] that you inwardly what is the seed of
[36:34] Abraham those that believe the whole
[36:40] Word of God regardless of what
[36:45] denomination Papa mama anybody else says
[36:48] they believe the whole Word of God said
[36:51] I'll establish my covenant right now
[36:54] predestinate this covenant with thee in
[36:59] the seed the drunkies word for yesterday
[37:05] how does God predestinate the Bible says
[37:09] by foreknowledge right by foreknowledge
[37:15] we give the interpretation or thought is
[37:19] what Jacob have I loved and he saw have
[37:21] I hated said even before they were born
[37:26] and what is our answer
[37:28] God knew what Jacob would do
[37:34] in God knew what he saw would do right
[37:38] God knew what you and I did you know out
[37:42] of all the world as I said the other day
[37:44] out of all the world that was back there
[37:47] in the days of Abraham there was not one
[37:49] man could come from the foreknowledge of
[37:53] God down to an earth and God would look
[38:03] at it and say that's my seed
[38:09] what is the seat of God you want to
[38:11] quote the seat of God is the word of God
[38:16] what did Abraham believe God's Word why
[38:22] did God choose Abraham because he would
[38:26] believe in his word
[38:27] why did he choose these Jacob over Esau
[38:31] because he knew on Jacob wanted to birth
[38:33] rights and everything
[38:34] sure shyster true forever bad guy but in
[38:37] the finality Abraham didn't start out
[38:41] too good he stayed Abram all of those
[38:43] years until he got over close to the
[38:46] change for he's even made a brown yet
[38:49] God looked at him and he said that's
[38:51] what it is what about David murderer all
[38:55] kinds of things a dog for ya what does
[39:00] the Bible say about him
[39:01] I almost said God said he's a man after
[39:04] my own heart
[39:05] why because there was something about
[39:08] David that God loved what was it an
[39:11] honest and a contrite heart what did he
[39:15] love about Abraham did he believed him
[39:20] see we could just stop right there in
[39:22] the end of service they're not go home
[39:24] because that's exactly where we start
[39:26] the next service if we're not the seed
[39:31] of Abraham by faith then we're not the
[39:39] children of God
[39:41] oh I don't inside owner and then undo it
[39:46] it's whether or not we can find out what
[39:49] that seed of Abraham what did he say
[39:55] modern events made clear by prophecy
[39:58] faith in the promise word he swore by
[40:08] himself abraham believed God what about
[40:17] that abraham believed God I'm looking
[40:26] for the quote I know it's there but it's
[40:29] the run said if God can get one man he's
[40:33] don't have to help us flew he said if he
[40:35] can get one man to believe his word you
[40:41] know that one man believed enough of
[40:45] God's Word until he entrusted him with
[40:47] the full opening of the seven seals the
[40:49] entire message the whole Word of God
[40:51] because he had one man that would
[40:53] believe him what would you do if a voice
[41:01] spoke to you and says get up take your
[41:04] family leave this country yeah but a
[41:06] good living I've got my retirement plan
[41:08] we've got everything made he said yeah
[41:12] but get out of here he goes in to save
[41:16] her and he says Sarah pack up honey
[41:17] we go and she said where we going he
[41:19] said I don't know I said God told us to
[41:23] go our said a voice told us can you
[41:30] believe that away now let me make
[41:33] another statement if you and I cannot
[41:39] believe God's Word and believe in God
[41:46] the way abraham believed you will never
[41:52] be saved
[42:00] you know that's that fact I'll tell you
[42:03] what I gots getting pretty strapped name
[42:07] strict or not it's based on whether
[42:11] Abraham could believe or not it's based
[42:14] on whether you believe or not Oh a
[42:19] brother Dale I believe I'm saved
[42:20] I believe I'm safe not have these
[42:22] problems yeah
[42:27] spoken word original seed it's a faith
[42:31] seed of Abraham then he believed God I
[42:38] just quoted over these Saturday but a
[42:42] lot of them still there what about it
[42:50] what about Abraham believe in God so
[42:53] much until it brought God on the scene
[42:59] to Abraham
[43:08] you understand what I'm talking about
[43:11] he said but brother Dale I can't believe
[43:16] like Abraham show me one sign I mean
[43:27] asking you for two I'm asking you from
[43:30] one sign that God told Abraham he had to
[43:34] believe you can deal with Moses and the
[43:37] burning bush you can deal with all these
[43:38] other but remember Abraham was the
[43:41] father of the faith
[43:42] not one signer wonder took place before
[43:47] Abraham got out and started walking and
[43:52] I thought we believed the Bible says
[43:53] what if believers signs don't follow
[43:58] believers don't follow signs signs
[44:00] father believers I thought we had that
[44:02] in the order but I just don't see how
[44:07] you you could put everything so strong
[44:09] you mean I've got to believe like
[44:12] Abraham what did they brahim how to
[44:14] believe with Abraham listen folks never
[44:20] had one sermon anybody preached to him
[44:24] about her leaving God he was a healer
[44:28] your prophet said it come from the earth
[44:31] a child these are what it is there
[44:34] anything not one Sun that one sermon at
[44:43] least you heard sermons telling you you
[44:46] need to be saved
[44:51] we've had it what is the faith of
[44:55] Abraham simply to believe God simply to
[45:02] believe him
[45:08] and all the way from glory God came down
[45:12] to Abraham to show him that his
[45:15] believing was what triggered him back
[45:17] dire you know what the words you want to
[45:19] use God saw him before the foundation of
[45:22] the world and you he'd believed him well
[45:29] you're making a chose to know what
[45:31] remember the Prophet said don't
[45:36] predestinate by his desires right till
[45:40] he desired everybody to be safe but you
[45:42] know what he predestinated spy now come
[45:44] on swallow he got it he predestinated by
[45:48] your desire and you tell me that's wrong
[45:55] I thought that we believed that God
[46:05] could not override our free moral agency
[46:08] and save us that we had to accept it
[46:14] yeah but but you're saying except you're
[46:18] saying we got to do something now to get
[46:19] her salvation oh my god do is accept it
[46:26] ain't nothing good you can do there bad
[46:30] you don't do only the one brain guard to
[46:33] you but believing this word Church I
[46:41] know you don't like me and people don't
[46:44] anyway because I just don't play games
[46:47] but when God spoke to me when I was 11
[46:50] years old there was no way for you to
[46:52] tell me they wouldn't know God you can
[46:54] forget it to this day I was there when
[47:00] it took place and I saw him and I don't
[47:05] have to worry about it
[47:06] that's not trying to make you something
[47:08] where you believe me no but it is making
[47:11] something DIF that around say they've
[47:13] God will do something for one person
[47:14] now listen am i right he said if he can
[47:16] doing one person he said you need to do
[47:18] it for another one if you believe it's
[47:20] the same way
[47:27] has he ever told you something that was
[47:29] impossible
[47:30] I mean impossible to take pleasure and
[47:38] you go tell everybody excellent I play I
[47:44] stood right here many years ago and I
[47:46] said wait it's coming back forget it
[47:51] well you thank God gonna save you cause
[47:53] you'll chop no didn't say that I said
[47:56] God's gonna save him cuz I called for
[47:58] him because God told me that he said
[48:04] you'll be there with your offspring then
[48:12] we moved on down through time and then
[48:15] he was believing with us we were calling
[48:17] for weight and she confessed it to I
[48:19] walked in one day and I told her I said
[48:21] did more than story now honey didn't
[48:24] want I said wait gonna be in the pulpit
[48:26] beside of me this is before he come back
[48:29] to the Lord now he's gonna be in the
[48:36] book the other side of me don't you put
[48:41] your faith out sometime why don't you
[48:44] speak it in the khalaf art when I'm
[48:49] afraid that's what it is afraid you're
[48:53] afraid God ain't talking to you
[48:56] listen Church you can do what you want
[48:58] to about all the things I'm on the spot
[49:00] here ever service because I'm at least
[49:04] here trying to tell you this is what God
[49:06] is telling me to tell you and I've never
[49:11] had to take back one time that he told
[49:14] me now you show it to me anything that
[49:19] he told me I've always stood on it to
[49:25] see if you can't believe God he can't
[49:28] move he can't say
[49:32] you override your free moral agency
[49:34] you've got to accept Jesus Christ as
[49:36] your Savior but what about a great man
[49:41] now wouldn't you want to be counted in
[49:43] the Bible terminologies as being a
[49:45] righteous person you know it says that
[49:48] about Noah we won't say it about you
[49:51] know you know and all and say and you
[49:54] know that that he was chosen of God but
[49:56] we don't read Noah you know it says
[49:58] about Noah that he was chosen he was it
[50:02] was he had us he had something back more
[50:07] God liked it
[50:17] Abraham's faith to believe what the word
[50:25] said to him and told you it's over and
[50:29] over now he didn't have no 20 people to
[50:31] tell him the wait team preachers and no
[50:34] mama and daddy to correct him now you
[50:36] understand what I mean he was standing
[50:39] on his own and believed in God and
[50:43] walked out on his own even when his wife
[50:46] didn't agree with him go ahead let's
[50:55] read these cuz I want to get this on go
[50:58] ahead to number number 10 brother
[51:02] they're doing good keeping up back there
[51:04] so let's read some scriptures it's
[51:10] Genesis 15 he brought him forth abroad
[51:17] and said look now toward the heaven and
[51:21] tell the Stars is the arm be able to
[51:24] number them and he said unto so shall
[51:26] thy seed be and what and he believed in
[51:32] the Lord and was counted to him for
[51:37] righteousness
[51:38] I said wouldn't you want to think about
[51:42] some way that they could be something
[51:44] that God could say
[51:46] that's your righteous you can get all
[51:52] your definitions of righteousness
[51:55] don't worry about I've been through all
[51:56] of them as I'm fine but once you sum it
[52:00] up in one point righteousness would be
[52:03] the factor state of being right if
[52:10] you're right you're not wrong right if
[52:15] you're right you're not wrong
[52:17] if you're not wrong you're righteous
[52:21] those are justified he hath already
[52:26] glorified so God starts it off in
[52:36] Genesis talking about a man that
[52:37] believed him and it was counted unto him
[52:40] for righteousness
[52:40] okay let's jump over Romans for number
[52:44] eleven four and three and what saith the
[52:52] scripture abraham believed God and it
[52:57] was counted unto him for righteousness
[53:00] if you want to have anything to do in
[53:03] God to think about God in any way could
[53:06] impart anything we don't we believe God
[53:10] and he can impute in part cuz it'll get
[53:14] to work go to the next one relations
[53:16] three you got it
[53:18] I make up the other way all right yeah
[53:21] go places three six seven seven
[53:23] even if abraham believed god and it was
[53:25] accounted to him for righteousness
[53:29] know ye therefore that they which are of
[53:31] faith the same are the children of
[53:35] abraham abraham believed god and it was
[53:38] counted accounted who's the next ones
[53:41] james ii during twenty three
[53:49] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[53:52] say it now scripture you see see it was
[53:58] so hard to preach you see you want to
[54:01] stop explaining that right one the
[54:03] Scriptures fulfill that said where was
[54:07] it fulfilled in Abraham brought in to
[54:12] Jesus Christ
[54:13] to bring it into me and you in the
[54:18] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[54:19] abraham believed God and it was imputed
[54:22] unto him for righteousness look and he
[54:26] was called the friend of God what about
[54:35] it jump to 14 there you go
[54:42] romans 419 in vietnam we can faith he
[54:48] considered not his own body now did when
[54:50] it was about a hundred years old
[54:52] you neither yet the deadness of flavors
[54:55] wound he staggered not at the promise of
[54:57] God through unbelief who was strong in
[55:00] faith giving glory to God and being
[55:03] fully persuaded that what he had
[55:07] promised he was also able also to
[55:10] perform therefore after believing it
[55:14] that way after believing it that way and
[55:20] therefore it was imputed to him for
[55:23] righteousness
[55:25] after he believed it and staggered and
[55:28] all of that all the problems come up
[55:30] look now it was not written for his sake
[55:35] alone that it was imputed to him but for
[55:42] us also to whom it shall be imputed what
[55:51] you got a condition existing in front of
[55:53] you and the written word over there is
[55:56] no condition that's where you don't
[55:58] understand now it was not written for
[56:03] his sake along that it was imputed to
[56:05] him but for us also to whom it shall be
[56:08] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[56:12] up Jesus our Lord from the dead do you
[56:17] want to know anything about
[56:18] righteousness why don't you study
[56:19] righteousness on the basis of the fact
[56:22] of it being right and think about
[56:24] justification when you chop off when God
[56:29] remits her sins what does the Bible say
[56:32] about him were they put in the sea of
[56:35] forgetfulness never to be in remembered
[56:40] no more can't be imputed come on I'll
[56:44] quote brother Branham he said you can't
[56:47] impute sin over the token yeah but
[56:53] brother's throwing so done swords
[56:54] oppress what's your so and so what then
[57:01] is the seed of Abraham we've just been
[57:03] through it and they say G swore by
[57:05] himself abraham believed God more than
[57:10] words reading a seed what is the seed of
[57:13] Abraham those that believe the whole
[57:20] word
[57:25] those that believe the whole word you
[57:28] want to be the seed of Abraham I won't
[57:30] be no whew oh you're really smart
[57:33] that's wonderful I know you're just
[57:37] smart enough to be is in him talking
[57:41] about a Jew Abraham would note you
[57:46] there's no relation and Abraham they're
[57:49] calling with you until you come over the
[57:50] New Testament with him
[57:52] she comes from soda and that wasn't
[57:58] until over in the second kings in Judah
[58:02] and one of the other travelers in
[58:03] bondage this way 10m was in bondage that
[58:06] away see we talked about a Jew ain't
[58:12] bran wouldn't no Jew he was a Gentile
[58:17] the Bible said he come from the earth
[58:20] shall these heathen
[58:22] see we've been taught all over LA
[58:24] Abraham's it's you and you all we got to
[58:27] do it be a Jew he's not a Jew our labor
[58:31] to do this inwardly right you see we
[58:38] think we've been taught all of this we
[58:40] think we know and then I come on and say
[58:41] so
[58:42] when I don't know what he's saying I
[58:44] don't understand it because he you've
[58:45] never heard it you've never listened to
[58:49] what it's saying about it it's not a qu
[58:56] that's what you outwardly coach you
[59:00] means chosen and you want the quote from
[59:02] the Prophet I got to let it on the dance
[59:03] it out he said is it's not a Jewish is
[59:09] that it's a promise a promise seed
[59:25] she's called faith he said he believes
[59:30] the promise in the message brought her
[59:34] over to another message called faith he
[59:39] said he looked for God to fulfill his
[59:42] promise but for God to fulfill his
[59:48] promise you know what this is statements
[59:54] I make him I'm harf hard for you to
[59:55] follow he can't make his promise come to
[59:58] pass until he gets somebody that will
[1:00:01] believe it he's got to have somebody to
[1:00:05] believe his promise that's what I spent
[1:00:13] so much time they should have spent a
[1:00:14] whole lot more on the life of Abraham
[1:00:17] coming from Abram and all the problems
[1:00:20] he had he meets God go back on read
[1:00:24] Genesis he meets God time after time he
[1:00:29] meets Melchizedek God in human flesh
[1:00:33] before he ever comes to a change of his
[1:00:36] names in vain Abraham was a person to
[1:00:44] who could believe he didn't have no
[1:00:48] super dooper believe it he just believed
[1:00:51] it you talk about SuperDuper faith what
[1:00:56] is SuperDuper faith he knows this thing
[1:01:02] is SuperDuper faith faith is the
[1:01:09] substance of things hoped for the
[1:01:11] evidence of things not seen and read
[1:01:16] Hebrews 11 all the way down and you'll
[1:01:21] find every one of them is Old Testament
[1:01:23] people and what was the connection with
[1:01:27] every one of them that they had the
[1:01:31] ability to believe God our faith by
[1:01:35] faith Enoch by faith Noah by faith
[1:01:39] by faith that one by what a revelation
[1:01:45] to them that God had spoke to her what
[1:01:56] could you believe it like that why can't
[1:02:00] you believe it - the basis of thinking
[1:02:02] about that God would choose the people
[1:02:05] like you and I he would allow you and me
[1:02:09] to hear this message and to believe it
[1:02:13] when the world won't have it the
[1:02:22] religious society won't have this
[1:02:24] message you know that Oh y'all just make
[1:02:31] something out of this y'all my son

[1:02:42] about a change of the body now Abraham's
[1:02:47] change didn't come when his name was
[1:02:49] Abram and it didn't come for 25 years
[1:02:58] then he got a change a name and
[1:03:03] everything went through all of that and
[1:03:10] then he got a change
[1:03:18] there's all a born-again experience that
[1:03:21] we'll get to in the New Testament but we
[1:03:24] end the Old Testament is talking about
[1:03:28] looking at the basis of God
[1:03:34] what do you mean brother Daly you're
[1:03:36] trying to tell me that and all we got to
[1:03:38] do is believe God

[1:03:42] mean I'm open to anybody tell me some
[1:03:45] other way that anything can take place
[1:03:49] outside of belief in God now listen sure

[1:04:01] brought you to where you are some was
[1:04:08] born in the message yeah we know that
[1:04:10] but what brought you to this message
[1:04:20] well
[1:04:22] I didn't want to that's a good way to
[1:04:24] start because they brown me didn't
[1:04:25] either
[1:04:26] right but see one day something happens
[1:04:33] you need to say where can we go Lord is
[1:04:40] that what they said they finally got
[1:04:43] around enough to believe in God until I
[1:04:46] could contact him and when he said
[1:04:48] something to lase is working we go to
[1:04:50] work you've got the words of eternal
[1:04:52] life what can we do you don't never sit

[1:05:27] what I should've done what order done
[1:05:29] and what I didn't do
[1:05:39] thinking about your life
[1:05:48] just thinking about where you come from
[1:05:51] and what happened in your life you can't
[1:05:56] think like that and just think about to
[1:05:59] your life certain things would happen
[1:06:01] that could have changed your life
[1:06:04] totally certain situations meeting
[1:06:11] certain people doing this or doing that

[1:08:09] grabbed a gun and when I have tremor
[1:08:11] because he was that real I always had a
[1:08:17] 357 pistol in the holster hanging on the
[1:08:20] the bed and what you call it the poster
[1:08:23] we're all I had to do with just and I
[1:08:27] just caught it and I said Peggy you go
[1:08:28] in the room with the boys and it scared
[1:08:34] me to death

[1:08:48] didn't go after a gun
[1:08:50] I just lay down look just faded away we
[1:09:00] moved from the ire down to where we live
[1:09:01] now I always wondered Lord did I move
[1:09:05] away because you contacted me twice as
[1:09:09] dreams and Peggy standing with a baby
[1:09:11] out in the front of the house and all
[1:09:14] the things and the way it was all laid
[1:09:16] out and what was taken
[1:09:17] I carry through a lot if I out and my
[1:09:21] brother in a dream was working on an old
[1:09:23] building didn't come down like spaceship
[1:09:25] I knew what them things mean so I was
[1:09:32] laying there in the bed not where we're
[1:09:34] sleeping now but over an other end of
[1:09:36] the house always wondering what the Lord
[1:09:39] did I move away should I stayed there I
[1:09:44] woke up one night and looked re stood as
[1:09:51] well at least a notice okay they moved I
[1:09:56] never made that an experience never said
[1:09:59] that said I was saved never said it made
[1:10:03] me anything for you to believe but I
[1:10:07] will tell you who something true if
[1:10:10] you'll be serious God will meet you
[1:10:15] somewhere in your Christian experience
[1:10:19] he will meet you and you will know that
[1:10:23] it's him see that's why that when I
[1:10:30] preach I preached with a challenge not
[1:10:34] to challenge the world a challenge no if
[1:10:37] I'm wrong come show me but now don't
[1:10:41] come and say my brother Dale I think

[1:10:44] come on bring all the word we're gonna
[1:10:46] have a quite a day so we're gonna talk
[1:10:48] about it that's why I went to preached
[1:10:51] in 74 I preached that we could pass the
[1:10:57] Year 2026 and not break bread around
[1:11:00] message that was nothing said before I
[1:11:02] still
[1:11:03] not to take hey folks we whole lot
[1:11:10] closer to that and you think because
[1:11:14] what if you took the seven years off to
[1:11:19] go to Israel you only got another year
[1:11:23] or so and they're worried about it ain't
[1:11:27] never made no predictions I just told
[1:11:31] what I said
[1:11:33] sitting life and were people and they
[1:11:35] say you think when I just tell me what
[1:11:37] happened please don't Daniel 70 weeks
[1:11:45] that 74 series and still to this day
[1:11:48] I've never had to change one quote the
[1:11:51] cult has all been what he said stood
[1:11:55] before ministers put it out to where
[1:11:58] they could listen but nobody don't want
[1:12:00] me my brother branham said if you don't
[1:12:03] understand Daniel 70 weeks you cannot
[1:12:06] understand the seals but everybody knows
[1:12:09] the seals and all about nothing about
[1:12:12] Daniel 70 weaves what are you trying to
[1:12:17] say brother Dale try to say one time and
[1:12:21] God tells me I believe it I believe it
[1:12:27] brother dad would you tell me this out
[1:12:30] of the other not unless God allows me he
[1:12:35] told me one thing years ago that I could
[1:12:38] do and for five years or more I never
[1:12:42] done it I never did do it he said it's
[1:12:50] in your hands no I won't do it you see
[1:12:59] is not a plaything Church this is
[1:13:02] serious we think we're ready for a
[1:13:06] rapture and can't even talk about the
[1:13:09] message because you hurt somebody's
[1:13:18] feelings neighbor ahem believe God what
[1:13:32] if this whole thing is based upon
[1:13:34] whether or not you can believe God now
[1:13:42] you want me to get brother branham I got
[1:13:44] it on my desk but you want me to get him
[1:13:47] with what he said how many of you'd like
[1:13:49] to do the works of God you want to do
[1:13:55] the works of God now who knows the quote
[1:13:58] the Larry's quoting it back up for me
[1:14:00] who knows the quote what is it to be
[1:14:06] able to do the works of God he's shaking
[1:14:10] her head what is some of you know cause
[1:14:13] the Bible tells you it's to believe on
[1:14:15] Him that God sent that's what the Bible
[1:14:19] says to do the works of God is to
[1:14:23] believe on him that God sent we believe
[1:14:26] God sent a prophet right that's doing
[1:14:31] the works of God that's fulfilling God's
[1:14:34] Word and here's what your son we believe
[1:14:40] in the fivefold ministry do we do we
[1:14:48] really believe in a fivefold ministry
[1:14:50] that God could still come in today
[1:14:53] and tell you something and tell you the
[1:15:00] word
[1:15:05] just simply believe in God I wrote notes
[1:15:10] have all kind of try to express it but I
[1:15:13] can't express it no other way but one
[1:15:14] time
[1:15:17] can you believe God how you gonna know
[1:15:25] when he speaks to how you gonna know
[1:15:28] when he speaks to you now God will never
[1:15:36] speak except by his word he said well
[1:15:41] the delegator then we got the message
[1:15:44] just keep tapping that old boy then
[1:15:49] you'll find out he'll back up in a hurry
[1:15:51] because there's one thing he can't do
[1:15:53] what is the one thing they can get it he
[1:15:55] can't bring the word word by word that's
[1:16:01] your prophet that's wonderful
[1:16:03] you said well I I've a brother Dale you
[1:16:06] don't understand me cuz I I know the
[1:16:09] presence of God I know that sweet humble
[1:16:12] feeling of the presence of God so do I
[1:16:19] so did I and I believe in it you heard
[1:16:24] me tell when I'd ask God to give way to
[1:16:27] sign about something I could talk to him
[1:16:29] about and he killed his 10 pointer he's
[1:16:33] got hanging on the wall and Here I am
[1:16:38] over in the woods and one side of the
[1:16:40] woods praying about God to give him the
[1:16:42] deer and even had a dream of the
[1:16:45] footprint and the neighbor I went around
[1:16:47] and showed the neighbors dark the old
[1:16:49] church was at war was counted jury went
[1:16:53] back he told he said hey footprint over
[1:16:56] tire of a deer in the same and said Sam

[1:17:45] quit doing it I could stand like that
[1:17:48] and drop that Bible not because I had
[1:17:50] something sticking in it I could take
[1:17:52] your Bible and say Lord I need an answer
[1:17:55] to this question I drop it and put my
[1:18:01] finger on the words and read it because

[1:21:49] that you just a baby side
[1:21:51] thing with sugar tits trying to
[1:21:53] make something happen
[1:21:54] be honest I have no problems with nobody

[1:23:12] wife is contrary can you stand by
[1:23:16] yourself not stubborn
[1:23:23] just stand on the word see because
[1:23:27] that's the only way you're gonna face a
[1:23:29] New Testament situation because you got
[1:23:30] to start the New Testament as a man
[1:23:33] standing there and says you must be born
[1:23:34] again and the guy that was posting over
[1:23:37] the whole story says what I do he
[1:23:41] couldn't understand the simplicity they
[1:23:45] did what he had to do and that was
[1:23:46] believed that that man right there was
[1:23:49] his way to get in the kingdom right come
[1:23:55] on Nicodemus you didn't have to convince
[1:23:57] Nicodemus there was a god right he was
[1:24:02] the guy taught all of it but to believe
[1:24:06] that that was gone how would you like to
[1:24:11] have been standing there one of those
[1:24:12] great religious Pharisees will escort
[1:24:14] come after in a man walk up to uni look
[1:24:16] at uni see unless you believe that I am
[1:24:19] he you will die in your sins so jesus
[1:24:24] said one day he walked alone you take
[1:24:30] brother Branham brother Branham walk it
[1:24:32] alone I think about that man all through
[1:24:35] his life that he walked alone what a
[1:24:40] lonely man he would have been had God
[1:24:45] not been on his side as he walked alone
[1:24:52] nobody couldn't understand him come on
[1:24:54] his wife did nobody get it get to
[1:24:56] message ride nobody didn't understand
[1:24:59] brother branham he won't alone but he
[1:25:07] believed God no matter do we believe him
[1:25:14] can we end the Old Testament is talking
[1:25:17] about Abraham as being our Father and
[1:25:20] move with Abraham into a situation
[1:25:23] because listen

[1:25:37] all the way to Jesus Christ right not
[1:25:39] just a little handful of people come to
[1:25:43] a great nation of people but then when
[1:25:50] it come to the day today that they met
[1:25:52] the savior of all that they had they
[1:25:58] wouldn't accept him he said before
[1:26:05] Abraham was I am
[1:26:09] they recognized Abraham right
[1:26:12] they believed in they brown yeah but
[1:26:20] they didn't believe Abraham spoke about
[1:26:21] that kind of a God it would stand there
[1:26:25] how about you how about me tonight do we
[1:26:29] believe God is real come on musician do
[1:26:32] we believe God is real if you don't
[1:26:37] believe like Abraham did you're not
