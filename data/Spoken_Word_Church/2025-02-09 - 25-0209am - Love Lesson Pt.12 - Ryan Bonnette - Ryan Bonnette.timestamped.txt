[0:01] and pray for me teaching Sunday school
[0:02] here this
[0:09] morning so I'm going to review my last
[0:12] lesson just for a few minutes and then
[0:13] we'll pray and get started on the lesson
[0:15] for this morning here so last time for
[0:19] you those of you that were here you
[0:20] remember maybe that I was talking about
[0:22] uh Revelation
[0:25] ship and that's not really a word that's
[0:28] not in the dictionary that just my word
[0:30] to say a relationship based on receiving
[0:33] Revelation from God and it is so
[0:35] important that we have this constant
[0:37] flow of Revelation from him we need to
[0:40] get into a position where we have that
[0:42] we need to call on God for Revelation
[0:44] more than anything else in the world
[0:46] brother benam said from Exposition of
[0:48] the church ages and I had mentioned my
[0:50] dream that I had a couple years ago
[0:52] about that pond out here outside the
[0:54] church there was not a parking lot but
[0:57] there was a pond there in my dream and I
[0:59] was walking around and around this Pond
[1:02] and as I said last time I was throwing
[1:03] in handfuls of sort of like meal like
[1:06] cornmeal or something like that
[1:07] something for food and and then oil and
[1:10] as I was walking around and around this
[1:12] Pond there was three people three
[1:13] different characters interacting
[1:15] different ways with this Pond this water
[1:17] of the word I would say it would
[1:20] represent the word and the little boy
[1:23] there on the right was just playing kind
[1:24] of playing in the pond jumping in and
[1:26] out sort of like in church out of church
[1:28] back and forth up and down in and out
[1:31] the young lady a little more mature she
[1:33] wasn't a little girl like that in the
[1:34] picture that's the best picture I could
[1:35] find but she was more like a young woman
[1:38] sitting on this slide never getting in
[1:41] the water but always there sort of like
[1:44] she was always there at the pond but not
[1:47] ever fully getting in sort of like a
[1:49] border borderline believer if you will
[1:52] but then the main character that I
[1:53] observed it was so profound is this
[1:56] young lady that was always submerged in
[1:58] that water the entire dream that I never
[2:00] saw her surface from the water I never
[2:04] really fully saw her like come out of
[2:07] the water because I couldn't really tell
[2:08] about her appearance exactly other than
[2:10] she was a young woman and she was always
[2:13] very attentive to me passing around this
[2:15] Pond dumping in this basically uh word
[2:18] in Revelation if you will and she
[2:20] represents the True Believer the bride
[2:22] always there not always just at church
[2:24] but
[2:26] absolutely uh you know always with the
[2:28] with the word always
[2:30] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:32] always ready to receive always with a
[2:34] good
[2:34] attitude and just constantly locked into
[2:37] this relationship this Revelation
[2:39] receiving the word of God this from
[2:41] Brother Bob been wondering if my font is
[2:44] big enough I keep trying to up my size
[2:46] can y'all see that in the back pretty
[2:47] good good then you begin to know him
[2:50] it's not just something that you've
[2:52] heard about but you know him it's a deep
[2:55] internal change a complete shift of your
[2:57] nature now the new birth let's not give
[2:59] this this wrong the new birth is a start
[3:01] of your regeneration you're going to
[3:03] begin to grow in the stature of perfect
[3:05] man that's from Brother Bob October last
[3:09] year and the last sermon of the year
[3:12] last year the watch Night Service
[3:13] brother Andrew gave us this commission
[3:15] to keep walking simply all I'm saying in
[3:18] last lesson and all I'm going to talk
[3:20] about this lesson let's go to the Lord
[3:22] in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you
[3:24] for letting us get to be here Lord once
[3:25] again this morning thank you for your
[3:26] presence here and I pray you bless this
[3:27] lesson let it be a help to your people
[3:29] here and to those who may hear it later
[3:31] be with all those who couldn't be here
[3:32] Lord and give us understanding of your
[3:33] word and just help me to uh to get this
[3:36] across this thought that you've given me
[3:37] I pray in a way that be uplifting to
[3:40] your bride in Jesus name amen So This is
[3:43] Love lesson Part 12 the pool not getting
[3:47] into first second third pool nothing
[3:48] like that I'm just simply talking about
[3:50] this great attractive Force um if you
[3:53] will this attraction between God and us
[3:57] or US and God back and forth
[4:01] and there's it's good to do your daily
[4:04] Bible devotions and read your Bible and
[4:06] matter of fact that's a big part of this
[4:07] matter of fact this really won't happen
[4:09] what I'm fixing to talk about won't
[4:11] happen if you're not doing that so
[4:12] that's very important and being a church
[4:14] fa service and listening to sermons
[4:16] meditating on the word of God but then
[4:18] at some point you come to this mature
[4:20] state where you are locked in you're in
[4:22] that Revelation and this sort of
[4:25] gravitational bond between you and
[4:27] Christ and that's what I'm going to get
[4:29] into in this lesson keep doing that
[4:32] until this pull that's been leading you
[4:35] this pull goes all the way back to not
[4:37] only when you were converted to Christ
[4:40] to being a Christian but even back to as
[4:43] far back as you can remember I like
[4:45] everybody to take time meditate on your
[4:52] life and think back to your earliest
[4:55] memories of even a toddler maybe four
[4:58] years old 3 years old as far back as you
[4:59] remember and start to think about what
[5:02] led you to your conversion and led you
[5:04] all the way to where you are today
[5:06] because Christ didn't just start dealing
[5:07] with you when you were converted he
[5:09] dealt with you since you were a child
[5:11] since you formed conscious memories you
[5:13] can begin to see in my own example that
[5:18] was Christ and my grandma when I was
[5:19] four years old that led me to read the
[5:21] Bible that taught me to read the Bible
[5:23] and pray I said Lord that was you wasn't
[5:25] it it was him and that would come back
[5:28] to me at 15 and there he was was again
[5:30] when I started reading my Bible every
[5:31] day because my grandma taught me that
[5:33] and that was Christ and my parents that
[5:35] took me to church every Sunday and had
[5:37] Bible study in prayer and and uh um when
[5:40] I was growing up that was Christ in all
[5:42] both sets of grandparents and both Sid
[5:44] influenced me in so many ways so think
[5:46] about how Christ influenced you well I
[5:48] like to look at people's lives and study
[5:50] people's lives and think about your
[5:52] little um seemingly unimportant details
[5:55] of your life that are important because
[5:57] Christ is in that leading you um one of
[6:00] my favorite people to look at is Gabby
[6:02] because her life so far out away from
[6:04] Christ it's not such a surprise that I
[6:06] would be serving the lord today cuz I
[6:07] was raised in church she was raised
[6:10] completely away from God by alcoholics
[6:13] that weren't even fit to be parents the
[6:15] social services took them her and Jackie
[6:17] her sister from their biological parents
[6:20] gave them to Uncle John at about when
[6:22] Gabby was 10 years old Uncle John said I
[6:24] don't want them took him back to Social
[6:26] Services dropped them off packed their
[6:27] suitcases and dropped them off said
[6:29] y'all have them so they were orphans
[6:31] from then on till Gabby was 17 and all
[6:34] that time she believed in God and yet he
[6:37] was drawing there was this pool he was
[6:39] drawing her but she didn't serve him she
[6:42] didn't per se love him but she was
[6:44] praying said God give me a family and
[6:46] and when he did he gave her this loving
[6:48] Godly family and she saw something real
[6:50] and that was God pulling her through
[6:53] that family that message family that
[6:54] adopted two sinner girls that didn't
[6:56] even know the Lord a message family that
[6:58] God would have them adopt two sinner
[7:00] girls that don't even know the the Lord
[7:02] and bring them into their home not as
[7:05] foster kids as adopted kids and that
[7:07] they would well at least Gabby anyway
[7:09] would give her heart to the Lord and
[7:10] serve him that was Christ all the way
[7:13] through that
[7:14] Journey so I always like to relate this
[7:17] to Holy matrimonies it so perfectly does
[7:20] holy matrimony is a such a a a blessing
[7:23] and a privilege that you can see those
[7:25] of you who are married to the Lord you
[7:27] can look at your marriage and see so
[7:29] much about Christ about the character of
[7:31] Christ and the love of Christ portrayed
[7:34] in this Union this holy Union between
[7:35] man and wife instituted by God and if
[7:39] it's done right you know it it shows you
[7:41] so much about the Lord that's where this
[7:43] thought came from from what I'm going to
[7:45] talk about today actually came from me
[7:46] thinking about Gabby the other day um
[7:49] and then I realized this relates so much
[7:51] to our walk with the
[7:52] Lord so now that I got you in suspense
[7:56] let's actually get into it
[7:57] here so
[8:00] from Jesus Christ same yesterday today
[8:02] and forever listen very closely to this
[8:04] few slides of brother benham's quote
[8:05] here but you find it's that the girl
[8:08] that you love there's something about
[8:10] her as soon as you see her you know you
[8:12] love her you think oh if I could just
[8:14] only get one date with that girl well
[8:17] finally you do and you think it would
[8:19] satisfy that feeling but it doesn't and
[8:22] then you think if I could go with her
[8:24] steady that would do it finally you get
[8:25] to go with her steady it
[8:27] doesn't if she would just let me kiss
[8:30] her I know brother bam didn't believe in
[8:31] premarital kissing okay I don't know
[8:33] anyway if you if you just she would just
[8:35] let me kiss her good night sometime that
[8:36] would do it fin that happens and it
[8:38] doesn't well she would marry me I know
[8:41] that would do it it
[8:43] doesn't there's this longing this pull
[8:45] between you and your spouse that started
[8:47] small maybe from the beginning keeps
[8:49] getting greater and greater and greater
[8:51] and after maybe 10 20 years of
[8:54] marriage if that is nurtured and taken
[8:58] care of and done right that will
[8:59] actually increase it will not diminish
[9:01] it will actually become greater and
[9:02] greater till you can't get enough of
[9:04] each other even family relationship you
[9:07] love her so much feel like you could
[9:09] pull her all the way around through you
[9:11] reach back and pull her again and and
[9:13] trying to that's rude expression it mean
[9:15] like that but I mean what I'm trying to
[9:17] say is you love her love her love her
[9:20] and there's no place you can find what
[9:22] is it she's part of your soul she's part
[9:25] of you that's right and that's that if
[9:27] that's the way God is now we're getting
[9:30] into our thought for the day when you
[9:32] come and find Christ in your heart
[9:33] there's no place you can stop you just
[9:35] keep moving on this meeting that meeting
[9:37] that thing that I made it my slides too
[9:41] big my font it got cut off there but
[9:43] point is you start with your daily
[9:45] devotional just reading the Bible every
[9:47] day and that's what I did at 15 years
[9:49] old I said Lord I'm going to read the
[9:50] Bible every day that's it I just did my
[9:52] daily Duty for years and years and years
[9:54] and years and it got to where that
[9:56] wasn't enough and then I came into the
[9:58] message at 17 and then kept reading the
[10:00] Bible and the message every day for many
[10:01] many years still was enough and now it's
[10:04] just like every waking moment I'm
[10:06] meditating on the word of God listening
[10:08] to sermons worshiping the Lord reading
[10:10] my Bible listening to my audio B and so
[10:12] on like brother Dale all he ever did his
[10:14] whole life was dedicated to this when
[10:16] you get locked into this gravitational
[10:18] pole like between two celestial bodies
[10:21] like two stars that we're going to talk
[10:22] about you get locked in so tight to
[10:25] where there's nothing can separate you
[10:26] from the love of God in Christ there's
[10:27] nothing that can come between you
[10:29] there's not a devil in hell that can
[10:31] stop you from believing the message from
[10:34] believing the Bible and from walking
[10:36] with the Lord nothing there's not a
[10:38] woman on this Earth that could deter me
[10:40] from my love for Gabby not a woman that
[10:42] I could ever encounter that could sway
[10:44] me from my love from her that's the type
[10:46] of thing I'm talking about in marriage
[10:48] and I'm talking about that in your walk
[10:49] with the
[10:50] Lord let's go to Genesis 1 and the Earth
[10:54] was without form and void and darkness
[10:56] was upon the face of the deep and the
[10:58] spirit of God moved upon the the face of
[10:59] the waters I believe brother bam said
[11:02] that could have been millions of years
[11:03] scoffield speculates that might have
[11:04] been millions of years in Genesis 1
[11:06] where it said in the beginning God
[11:07] created the Heaven and Earth period
[11:09] right doesn't specify how much time
[11:11] there period but the Earth was without
[11:13] form and void so there was this time
[11:15] before creation before God really began
[11:19] doing the days of creation I mean before
[11:21] that part there was this time and there
[11:24] was this time in your life before your
[11:26] conversion before God really dealt with
[11:28] you on a more level that he was gooing
[11:32] to
[11:33] you calling you brooding over your life
[11:36] as you were yet a sinner and didn't even
[11:38] love him didn't know him didn't care
[11:40] about him maybe didn't even know of him
[11:42] and yet he would brood over you like
[11:45] that like over the face of the Waters of
[11:47] the earth and there you set what would
[11:49] one day be a bride of Christ started
[11:52] back here in darkness and sin and
[11:54] unbelief and he would yet call through
[11:56] your grandma through your sibling
[11:58] through your friend through your
[11:59] coworker through somebody through a a
[12:02] book or through you know through the
[12:03] Bible Etc and there is that scripture
[12:06] again the Earth was without form and
[12:07] void you our Earth was without form and
[12:09] void Darkness was upon the face of the
[12:11] deep God finds us as
[12:14] Sinners Broods over us coups to us to
[12:17] lead us to Salvation he leads us to
[12:19] through trials exactly to where he wants
[12:21] us this love this pull it leads us
[12:23] through all those things of life it
[12:25] leads us and it's not by chance none of
[12:28] it's by chance
[12:29] Gabby went through some awful things in
[12:31] those time those years of being a foster
[12:33] kid nobody wanting her she was tossed
[12:35] from family to family never really
[12:37] having a home and saying God just please
[12:39] give me a family please give me a home
[12:41] that's all I want and boy he did when it
[12:44] when it came the right time but in all
[12:46] that time there was a purpose and a
[12:47] meaning to every bit of that that's
[12:49] right early in our journey it's it's
[12:52] easy to be
[12:54] deterred um oh and my my early time I
[12:56] was going to say here my early time in
[12:58] the message I was was trying to figure
[12:59] out if this was even right I wasn't
[13:01] locked in there was no like me and
[13:03] Christ really that one I was just trying
[13:04] to figure out if this is even right I
[13:06] this new thing called the message I was
[13:07] like Lord just show me where you want me
[13:09] to be I was at the Baptist church on
[13:10] Sundays for a while and coming here on
[13:12] Wednesday nights kind of back and forth
[13:14] but now I'm locked in there is no
[13:16] absolutely no uncertainty it's like um
[13:19] you know brother B preached convinced
[13:21] and concerned once you're really
[13:23] convinced you're concerned and you're
[13:24] persevering as he
[13:26] preached Philippians 1
[13:29] being confident in this very thing that
[13:31] he which hath begun a good work and you
[13:34] will perform it to the day of Jesus
[13:36] Christ he that everything God does he
[13:38] begins and then he finishes it if you
[13:41] keep going on with the Lord there's that
[13:43] big if and that's up to you if you keep
[13:46] going on the Lord he starts it and he
[13:48] finishes it he's Hebrews 12 the author
[13:51] and the finisher of our faith I don't
[13:53] know if y'all seen this before but James
[13:54] chapter 1 every good gift and every
[13:58] perfect gift
[13:59] is from above well there's a distinction
[14:01] there there's a good and there's a
[14:04] perfect and cometh down from the Father
[14:06] of Lights with whom is no variable
[14:08] variableness neither shadow of turning
[14:10] so there's a reason he did not just say
[14:12] every gift is from God if it wasn't that
[14:15] distinction he would just say every gift
[14:17] is from above but there's a good and a
[14:20] perfect so what's the distinction so if
[14:22] you look up in the original Greek good
[14:25] means Pleasant agreeable agreeable to
[14:28] the senses Pleasant a higher nature
[14:29] excellent Rich valuable but especially
[14:31] like the word agreeable at the beginning
[14:33] of your journey at your conversion
[14:34] you're good okay you're agreeable you're
[14:37] saying Amen to the word and as long as
[14:39] you keep Amen in the word every time you
[14:40] see more you'll amen that word and walk
[14:42] into more and then he shows you more
[14:43] light and you'll walk into more onto
[14:45] your day of perfection here a little
[14:48] there a little you know uh partial to
[14:50] perfect realization if you will you keep
[14:52] on going you're coming to Perfection but
[14:55] that perfect there means brought to its
[14:57] end finished complete wanting nothing
[15:01] necessary to completeness that which is
[15:03] perfect okay so there's a start and a
[15:06] finish like the Earth Genesis 1 God saw
[15:09] everything that he had made and behold
[15:11] it was very good didn't say perfect now
[15:15] was it flawed I don't believe it was
[15:17] flawed was it an error I don't believe
[15:19] there was anything God could do in error
[15:21] but it wasn't complete there was
[15:23] something yet to be complete God wanted
[15:25] to form himself into Mankind and and
[15:28] finish his his uh creation by being part
[15:31] of man he wanted to become man he wanted
[15:33] to be human be one with us so there was
[15:36] this everything that God saw he made it
[15:38] was good and that there if you look at
[15:40] that good Again original Hebrew means
[15:43] good Pleasant agreeable there's more to
[15:45] it though there's more to the story
[15:46] there's more he's doing making himself a
[15:49] part of his
[15:50] creation Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the
[15:52] thoughts that I have that I think toward
[15:54] you say the Lord thoughts of peace and
[15:56] not of evil to give you an expected end
[15:58] he knows your end of your journey but he
[16:01] knows here you are down here at the
[16:03] start he sees the entire thing and he
[16:05] knows exactly how to get you to that
[16:07] perfect end Oneness with him being part
[16:10] of the bride of Christ it's only up to
[16:12] us to just keep going with him keep
[16:14] walking keep
[16:17] moving Ephesians 2 and you have he
[16:20] quickened who were back here remember
[16:22] our past life dead and trespasses and
[16:24] sins where in time past you walked
[16:26] according to the course of this world
[16:27] according to the prince of the power of
[16:28] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[16:30] the children of Disobedience among whom
[16:32] also we all had our conversation in time
[16:34] past the lust of our flesh fulfilling
[16:36] the desires of the Flesh of the mind and
[16:37] were by Nature the children of Wrath
[16:39] even as others but God who is rich in
[16:42] Mercy for his great love what am I
[16:44] talking about this whole lesson this
[16:45] pull this love wherewith he loved us
[16:48] even when we are dead in sins hath he
[16:50] quickened us together in Christ by Grace
[16:52] you're saved and have to raised us up
[16:54] together made us sit together in heaven
[16:55] plac in Christ that in the ages to come
[16:57] might show exceeding Riches of of his
[16:59] grace and his kindness toward us through
[17:01] Christ Jesus before our conversion we
[17:03] were dead in our sin and unbelief yet he
[17:06] called us yet he drew us he CED to us I
[17:09] don't know if y'all know this but I love
[17:11] stuff about space and I don't if
[17:14] anybody's ever heard of a binary solar
[17:15] system our solar system is a single star
[17:19] solar system that's all we've ever known
[17:20] we see one Sunrise every day and one
[17:22] Sunset we have one Sun that hosts all
[17:26] these planets orbiting about it did yall
[17:29] know that there are solar systems in the
[17:31] universe that have two or more Suns
[17:33] orbiting around each other in the center
[17:36] of their solar system and there are
[17:38] planets orbiting those two suns there
[17:42] can actually be three or four or five as
[17:44] a matter of fact
[17:45] Polaris uh I believe what we call the
[17:47] North Star as I understand has either
[17:49] three or five stars orbiting about each
[17:51] other it's not just one star I guess
[17:53] that's why it's so bright the point is
[17:55] there are stars interlocked in this
[17:58] gravitational bond this sort of
[18:00] celestial dance through all of time that
[18:03] they're just dancing about each other
[18:06] locked in they can't get away from each
[18:07] other if they want to they're always
[18:09] pulling toward each other as they
[18:11] revolve as they orbit around each other
[18:13] round and round and these other planets
[18:15] orbiting about them at the same time but
[18:17] all the while they're orbiting around
[18:19] and around each other always pulling so
[18:21] hard to get to each other yet they can
[18:23] never get enough of each other they can
[18:25] never get to each other and that's like
[18:27] us in Christ this is what occurred to me
[18:28] other day me and Gabby are so in love
[18:31] that there's this constant pull and I
[18:33] can never get enough of Gabby if I had a
[18:35] 100 years I could never get enough time
[18:37] with her that's how much I love her
[18:38] after 17 years of marriage I love her
[18:40] more than I did when I started that's
[18:42] what occurred to me the other day and I
[18:43] thought how much us in Christ that we're
[18:45] so in love with him that we can't get
[18:47] enough of him there's not enough time in
[18:48] the day to spend enough time with him
[18:51] that you want his word more than
[18:53] anything you're willing to give up sleep
[18:55] and food and and family time and
[18:56] everything for him that's that's what
[18:58] I'm talking about that's the whole
[18:59] lesson so if you don't get anything else
[19:01] to say that's it being locked in with
[19:05] Christ um these solar systems are
[19:07] actually possibly they say more abundant
[19:10] than single star solar systems these are
[19:12] actually a frequent thing it's not a
[19:13] rare thing in our in our universe that
[19:15] they say possibly 50% or more solar
[19:18] systems have more than one star and so
[19:21] it's actually pretty common thing so
[19:25] nothing can deter us from this love with
[19:27] Christ when you come to this position
[19:28] there's no no more swaying you're not
[19:29] fickle you're not double-minded B says
[19:32] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[19:34] ways you're that when you're that way
[19:36] you're that little boy jumping in out of
[19:37] the pond in my dream or that young lady
[19:40] that's just kind of on the edge never
[19:42] getting in but when you're fully
[19:43] submerged in that water you're fully
[19:45] locked in there's gravitational pole
[19:47] nothing's going to move you no devil in
[19:49] hell I get that quote from brother I
[19:51] think it was brother Brady the preacher
[19:53] many years ago and by that time I was
[19:54] locked in I was saying Lord I'm not
[19:56] going nowhere and he I think it was
[19:58] somebody from Jamaica I think it was
[19:59] maybe brother Brady I can't remember and
[20:01] he stood up here and said I don't see a
[20:02] devil in hell that can stop me from
[20:04] believing this I was like yeah I'm there
[20:06] I know what you're talking about nothing
[20:08] can stop you and can never get enough of
[20:11] him never fully satisfied now Leo deia
[20:14] our age we live
[20:16] in um you know the Bible talks about
[20:18] we're and we have U Need of nothing
[20:20] because we're rich in increasing Goods
[20:22] we have all these great things at our
[20:24] disposal Amazon and uh you can get
[20:26] anything you want on Amazon delivered to
[20:28] your door you can get groceries
[20:29] delivered to your door you just have
[20:31] like that Rich Young Ruler your barns
[20:32] are full and overflowing You're Building
[20:34] more Barns and you think but you don't
[20:36] make time for the most important thing
[20:38] for Christ and that love for him that
[20:41] love for him that needs to be nurtured
[20:44] um so and we know Romans 8:28 that all
[20:47] things work together for good to them
[20:48] that love God here we are again with
[20:50] that love to them who are called
[20:52] according to his purpose you all are
[20:54] very familiar with that scripture so I'm
[20:56] going to try to close up with this last
[20:58] few slides here meditate on your past
[21:00] life all the way to the present do this
[21:04] often say it out loud when you're alone
[21:07] sometimes say it out loud if you need to
[21:09] tell yourself your life story and watch
[21:12] how the Bible re relives itself in your
[21:16] life this is a living Bible oh man I
[21:20] wish I had time to say this but you know
[21:22] um watch how you can see Christ moving
[21:24] brooding over you and your paths cing to
[21:26] you and bring you to himself to
[21:27] Salvation and ultimately to Redemption
[21:30] consider the hardships you had to face
[21:32] in life when you were neglected abused
[21:34] mistreated pay attention to the detail
[21:35] not overlooking the smallest most
[21:37] simplistic events God hides in
[21:39] Simplicity I'll say it just for a brief
[21:41] moment the trial with IA that gav and I
[21:43] went through we were walking in Psalm 23
[21:47] and Mark 4 at the same time Psalm 23 at
[21:51] the end of that trial trial when the
[21:53] Lord came and I realized then that he
[21:55] was there the whole time we were in the
[21:57] consultation Room 2 a am waiting to meet
[22:00] the doctor right before she came in and
[22:02] told us our baby is dying she was the
[22:04] third person that said that the third
[22:06] medical person that affirmed for us that
[22:08] yeah your baby's dying okay this is not
[22:10] a good situation you're in well right
[22:12] before that I'd open my bible to read it
[22:15] and I landed for my daily reading on 1
[22:18] John 4 he who fearth not made perfect in
[22:20] love I don't want to confuse anybody but
[22:22] there was two things happening there
[22:24] Psalm 23 The Lord prepared a table
[22:26] before me in presence of my enemies my
[22:28] enemies were fear and death I was
[22:29] fearful about my baby dying and those
[22:31] two enemies fear and death were lurking
[22:33] about yet in the midst of that I open my
[22:35] Bible that down to do my daily Bible
[22:37] reading and what was allotted to me for
[22:40] that day my portion for that day was
[22:42] first John 4 he who fearth not me
[22:44] perfect in love that's when I realized I
[22:45] had what I needed that spiritual food
[22:48] and due season that meat that I needed
[22:49] for that moment to overcome that trial
[22:52] right so there's Psalm 23 at the same
[22:54] time see the Bible was reliving itself
[22:56] Mark 4 Jesus was asleep in the back of
[22:58] the ship he was there he was asleep
[23:01] waiting to see what the disciples would
[23:03] do what they believe in this storm being
[23:04] tossed about in the winds and waves
[23:06] would they believe or would they doubt
[23:08] they doubted they came woke him up
[23:09] Master carest thou not that we perish he
[23:12] rebuked them calm the winds and the
[23:14] waves and in our trial day number two or
[23:18] three right before the Apex right before
[23:20] the
[23:21] climax that night that Saturday night we
[23:23] left the hospital to come to church for
[23:25] the Bible study baby dying thought she'd
[23:28] be dead when we got back that's how
[23:29] close she was she was hanging on by just
[23:31] a just a
[23:32] hair and when we were going out the door
[23:35] I said Lord where are you you know my
[23:37] baby's dying where you at same thing the
[23:40] disciples said master car th not that we
[23:43] perish he was asleep I didn't see him
[23:45] moving at all he was asleep in our trial
[23:47] and the first thing he did 2:00 in the
[23:49] morning when we're waiting to meet the
[23:50] doctor in that consultation room at
[23:52] Egon he comes in the
[23:55] room and I was say master car th not
[23:57] that we perish he comes in the room and
[23:59] gives me my rebuke like he did the
[24:00] disciples cuz first John four is my
[24:02] rebuke he who fearth is not made perfect
[24:04] in love that was a rebuke to me I wasn't
[24:07] where I needed to be with the Lord I
[24:08] wasn't perfectly confidently resting in
[24:11] him that all be well with the baby even
[24:13] if she dies everything's fine that's
[24:16] what I was lacking so that was my rebuke
[24:18] and then peace be still was the doctor
[24:21] comes in and says you're a baby's dying
[24:23] but right now she's stable was that not
[24:27] peace be still she was stable she was
[24:29] hanging on by a thread but she wasn't
[24:31] going down so he literally rebuked me
[24:34] like he did the disciples in John in
[24:35] Mark 4 and then he said peace be still
[24:38] to the winds and the waves that looked
[24:40] like it was in any moment going to take
[24:42] her brother Wade
[24:44] from uh February just February 2nd just
[24:47] about a week ago your life starts with a
[24:50] saying somebody told you about brother
[24:52] Brandon somebody told you about Jesus
[24:54] Christ you might not have known you
[24:56] might not know nothing you just heard
[24:58] something a saying a deed you started
[25:01] coming to church you started trying to
[25:02] do the things then when you get born
[25:05] again what it become a Doctrine it
[25:08] become what you live by you're bound
[25:10] gravitation to Christ you're bound
[25:12] you're you're um nothing can separate
[25:14] you from him anymore uh you musicians go
[25:16] ahead and come please and then what the
[25:19] word's going to be incarnate in me and
[25:21] in you listen the doctrine we have today
[25:23] is what's going to take us out of here
[25:25] nothing else there's not a new doctrine
[25:27] from another preacher or a new sermon
[25:29] coming or a new it's here it's just
[25:32] getting in and becoming
[25:34] it B gra and P is here now they said
[25:37] Jonah was backsliding this is brother
[25:40] Bob was preaching the other day about
[25:41] Jonah and gab and I were talking about
[25:42] Jonah was he really backsliding or not
[25:44] well it depends a a lot about
[25:45] perspective if you're looking at God's
[25:47] perfect will yeah he looked backsliding
[25:49] but if you look at God's permissive will
[25:50] that how God brought him around though
[25:52] he was going the opposite direction God
[25:54] brought him right back around to where
[25:55] he needed to be and really use the trial
[25:59] or use that I guess you can say
[26:01] Disobedience for a benefit and to um
[26:05] really get his purpose across so God
[26:08] when we were maybe backsliding or maybe
[26:10] not even serving the lord yet he was
[26:12] using all those little things we went
[26:14] through okay and I believe I'm going to
[26:17] close up there because uh you see that
[26:19] God made it all work out right you know
[26:22] the footsteps of the righteous are
[26:23] ordered of the
[26:25] Lord I sheep hear my voice and I know
[26:27] them and they follow me and I give unto
[26:29] them eternal life and they shall never
[26:31] perish you heard God's Voice through all
[26:33] of your sin through all the things you
[26:35] went through in life and your past life
[26:36] God was cooing to you and and brooding
[26:38] to you at some point you began to hear
[26:40] him the start of your journey perhaps
[26:42] you did not desire the Lord that much
[26:43] but as you mature you should want him
[26:45] more than anything and be willing to
[26:48] forsake everything for him Luke 14 If
[26:50] any man come to me and hate not his
[26:52] father mother sister or mother and wife
[26:55] and children Brethren sisters and his
[26:57] own life also he cannot be my my
[26:58] disciple as brother Michael was saying
[27:00] last Sunday or so he talking about that
[27:02] hate doesn't mean despise it means like
[27:04] love less our love for the Lord should
[27:06] be so much greater than I love for even
[27:08] spouse or anybody
[27:10] else so we're in the celestial dance
[27:12] let's get locked into that Celestial
[27:15] dance with the Lord that we never
[27:17] separate from him never let anything
[27:19] come between us again God bless you
[27:22] [Applause]
[27:31] [Music]
