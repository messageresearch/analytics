[17:11] amen Revelations
[17:15] 1 1 through3 the revelation of Jesus
[17:19] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[17:21] unto his servants things which must
[17:23] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[17:26] signified it by his Angel and to his
[17:28] servant John who be record of the word
[17:30] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[17:32] Christ and of all things that he saw
[17:35] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[17:37] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[17:40] those things which are written therein
[17:42] for the time is at hand the time to
[17:47] understand okay let's go over to
[17:50] Revelation 6 we jumped up read
[17:53] Revelations uh 6 3 and 4 the other day
[17:57] but I want us to make make sure we
[17:59] understand so let's drop back and just
[18:00] read Revelation 6 1 and 2 and then we'll
[18:04] continue on into the second seal the
[18:07] Lord willing next week H and I saw when
[18:11] the lamb opened one of the seals and I
[18:14] heard as it were the noise of Thunder
[18:15] one of the four Beast saying come and
[18:18] see and I saw and behold a white horse
[18:20] and he that set on him had a bow and a
[18:23] crown was given unto him and he went
[18:25] forth conquering and to conquer you may
[18:29] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[18:32] the reading of the word
[18:36] now as I said we spoke back there this
[18:40] past Sunday on talking of the Antichrist
[18:44] and the things but I want to just make
[18:46] sure that we understand a few things and
[18:49] and then if you have uh already looked
[18:52] at the notes or something some of you
[18:53] that get them hold them and we'll come
[18:55] back to them the Lord within next
[18:57] Wednesday on and talking get on to the
[19:00] second seal but we see there that it
[19:03] says
[19:04] that you
[19:06] know when he opened the
[19:09] seal and I saw and behold a white horse
[19:13] and he that sat on him had a bow and a
[19:15] crown was given unto him and he went
[19:18] forth conquering and to conquer now I I
[19:24] I pray that the Lord will give me the
[19:26] correct way to present what I see to you
[19:29] tonight because you know I I want to try
[19:32] to bring something to you I don't want
[19:34] to just get together and have a meeting
[19:36] and just talk on something I want to try
[19:38] to uh you know give an understanding to
[19:41] our hearts and our lives for that's a
[19:44] purpose of being here if other than that
[19:45] we just stayed at home and we could have
[19:47] listen do a tape or done something else
[19:50] but back years ago when I preached on
[19:53] the seals back in it would have been 79
[19:56] really in the beginning and uh even over
[19:59] into 882 and 3
[20:03] uh I saw what I believe was the opening
[20:07] of that first seal and I be to see it
[20:10] real clear throughout the
[20:12] scriptures but then there was a kind of
[20:15] a I preached it and you know the best
[20:18] that I could but there was a kind of an
[20:20] understanding Gap that was not filled in
[20:22] real good even though if I went back and
[20:25] listened to the tapes and if you would
[20:26] go back and listen to them you hear me
[20:28] saying the things that I'll say tonight
[20:30] but you know how it is sometimes
[20:32] something opens right that's right from
[20:35] what you preached for maybe 20 years
[20:37] that's been quite a while ago and but I
[20:40] I just kind of had a little gap between
[20:42] the first and the fourth seal as a
[20:45] basics of total understanding of what it
[20:49] was dealing with and the Lord was
[20:51] dealing with me the other day and opened
[20:53] it unto me so maybe I'll try to bring
[20:55] that tonight that's the reason I wanted
[20:56] to drop back to this to be able to get
[21:00] the foundation in the correct order uh
[21:03] it wasn't that I was preaching something
[21:05] I had it right I said if you listen to
[21:07] the texes and then you listen to the not
[21:09] you say well that's what you said well
[21:12] you know you can say a lot of
[21:13] things but when it's revealed right amen
[21:16] there's a lot of
[21:17] difference I pray that the Lord will
[21:20] help us all to understand all
[21:23] right we covered this last the last
[21:25] message you know we were talking about
[21:27] how that this Antichrist as we'll read
[21:30] in a minute that it was so
[21:34] deceiving that it's all it's deceive the
[21:36] whole world right
[21:38] amen you know and in doing that then
[21:42] it's close to deceiving the bride yep
[21:46] because if the Bible hadn't said you
[21:47] know that uh it it would not deceive us
[21:51] then I'm sure it would have done a lot
[21:53] of damage but you better remember the
[21:56] prophet said that we wouldn't be
[21:59] deceived but he said frankly if he
[22:01] didn't cut the work short they wouldn't
[22:04] be any flesh save for a Rapture right so
[22:07] we better be concerned about that and
[22:09] not be our our heads blowed to high so
[22:12] high that we think I can't be deceived
[22:14] that's right that probably is 99% of the
[22:18] people's statement y of the world that
[22:21] they're not deceived did you think you
[22:23] was deceived when you was in the
[22:24] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[22:26] Pentecostal or you was in a
[22:28] um uh a night of your own you know what
[22:31] I mean by that you know had your own
[22:33] Doctrine your own idea or thoughts you
[22:35] know and know see it deceived the world
[22:40] and it even deceived the prophet right
[22:43] amen that was my emphasis I was trying
[22:45] to get across because when he comes to
[22:48] that first seal he said I've made a
[22:50] horrible mistake that's right amen if
[22:53] the Holy Spirit hadn't to come down and
[22:54] corrected me on something I was going to
[22:57] pre
[23:00] you say no brother Dale he understood
[23:03] out there when the Angels Came Down well
[23:06] you better go back and read that a
[23:07] little bit that's right you'll find out
[23:09] he said the angel there or the holy
[23:11] spirit said go back to Jeffersonville
[23:14] it'll be told you what to do now either
[23:17] he's a prophet or whatever you want to
[23:19] do about it that's up to you but when he
[23:21] come back he said I don't know what that
[23:23] first seal is that's right well now
[23:25] you're going to make him a liar to say
[23:27] he did right now sure he had a whole lot
[23:29] better understanding than me and you
[23:31] amen right MH that's right you know you
[23:34] see what I'm saying a whole lot better
[23:36] understanding me and you right and a
[23:37] whole lot more capability of being
[23:39] correct right than you and I because he
[23:42] was a
[23:43] prophet now but still if something is
[23:47] not unveiled to
[23:49] him it's not unveiled that's right
[23:52] that's right all right so then we can
[23:54] see that it was the the spirit of Satan
[23:57] work working in the children the Bible
[23:59] says of Disobedience that's right
[24:03] amen turning the righteousness of God
[24:06] into a lie
[24:08] right he said Satan told that same lie
[24:11] that he told
[24:13] Eve well you know Eve believed that lie
[24:16] that's right Adam was not deceived but
[24:19] Eve was she believed that lie it was so
[24:22] close to the truth
[24:24] right until she believed it amen like I
[24:27] tried to emphasize that to you many
[24:31] times I believe he was trying to
[24:33] convince her right not to have an act
[24:37] with him the Beast you know but it was
[24:40] Satan speaking through him he was trying
[24:42] to convince her that she was chosen for
[24:46] this job but that Adam and God wouldn't
[24:49] tell her about
[24:51] it yeah right it wasn't it just the the
[24:54] deception is not the the act on the
[24:57] ground we call it right the deception
[25:00] was in the very heart of Eve that
[25:03] thought she was doing right that's right
[25:05] amen and the World Church system still
[25:07] thinks that you're doing right that's
[25:09] right all right y now but it's so
[25:12] deceiving until John I gave you the
[25:15] quotes there John even admired yes
[25:19] that's right this church system that he
[25:21] saw
[25:23] amen he looked at it and he admired
[25:26] it right yeah see horrible things like
[25:30] we think is G you know demons oh oh they
[25:34] just go around like this you know who we
[25:37] trying to scare the kids or or who you
[25:44] know Satan is very slick with the tongue
[25:47] and the Bible even says that his
[25:49] ministers were as Ministers of
[25:53] righteousness right so that would leave
[25:56] out a law teacher mhm right right that
[25:59] blown up somebody that's a good law
[26:01] teacher that didn't leave him out y he's
[26:04] not even considered into the deception
[26:06] right
[26:08] amen it's not the the guy in the pull
[26:11] pit that tells you it's okay to drink
[26:12] and run around and stuff like that
[26:14] you're going to heaven anyway yeah
[26:17] that's not the
[26:18] deceiving the deceiving is when he's
[26:20] trying to get you to see his Doctrine am
[26:26] and to believe it MH there's your
[26:28] deception that was what I was trying to
[26:30] get
[26:32] across all right so tonight what do we
[26:34] look
[26:35] at
[26:37] now listen to what I'm
[26:40] saying even though the prophet in the
[26:42] first seal seen
[26:45] the
[26:51] Antichrist and even in the first seal he
[26:54] covers him as Antichrist false
[26:59] prophet
[27:00] Beast he covers about the
[27:03] pope and the things in the first
[27:07] se but you see once that part opened to
[27:11] the prophet right of who that by horse
[27:15] rider was
[27:17] MH then he could see that it would be
[27:21] the same
[27:22] Rider to ride on his horse right right
[27:27] even though would turn out to be the
[27:28] second seal red third seal black fourth
[27:31] seal
[27:33] pale it would just be changing the color
[27:35] of the horse M right to represent what
[27:39] was going to
[27:42] be but I believe that when he seen the
[27:44] Antichrist he knew who that was that
[27:48] would be straddling that horse right yes
[27:50] sir amen so when the second seal
[27:54] broke see he didn't have to go back
[27:57] other than to say see here this second
[28:00] seal shows you y that it's the same
[28:04] riter man MH the same Rider it's
[28:08] different horses right right all right
[28:11] now we say well now but that first seal
[28:14] shows the
[28:17] Antichrist
[28:20] well is that only the that all the
[28:23] stages you can
[28:26] see pure Satan is a very deceiving
[28:30] that's right person but this
[28:33] Antichrist that we're going to read here
[28:35] in a second the prophet said you want to
[28:36] know who he is he's the Antichrist right
[28:40] that was Satan right
[28:43] right Satan in his deception
[28:49] amen right he starts out as a
[28:55] spirit Antichrist spirit yeah then he
[28:59] becomes a false
[29:03] prophet then he becomes an incarnate
[29:05] false prophet right being the
[29:09] pope and then he'll turn out to be the
[29:12] Beast one day yes that's right same
[29:16] devil
[29:18] amen same
[29:21] person and that's the way that that seal
[29:24] opened to me was
[29:26] it
[29:27] here stands a lamb with a book in his
[29:30] hand and there goes a white
[29:34] Rider see the prophet said look that's a
[29:37] another person that's another that's a
[29:40] guy he call him guy I think three or
[29:43] four times right just prior to the
[29:46] speaking that said who is this it's the
[29:49] Antichrist right he said he's a
[29:52] fellow the Bible said that there was a
[29:55] horse and a rider y
[29:58] right all right
[30:01] now that is opening the
[30:05] seal and get my point
[30:08] now that breaks the symbol of the
[30:17] riter go just as a white you know Rider
[30:21] on the White Horse it breaks the symbol
[30:24] of the
[30:26] rider but it doesn't reveal the seal in
[30:29] its
[30:30] fullness right because there's a whole
[30:32] lot more to the uh seal than just a
[30:37] symbol of a riter that's
[30:39] right yes sir the the riter the symbol
[30:42] if you get what I'm
[30:44] saying once it broke to the prophet he
[30:46] could see that that was
[30:50] Satan changing his form from one form to
[30:54] another as he rode right amen but to be
[30:57] the the same
[31:00] devil right but now watch what I'm
[31:03] saying now we're going to read out of
[31:04] the first seal that he sees
[31:07] this but
[31:09] then he says I don't know what that
[31:12] second seal is that's correct
[31:16] amen but yet he knows the
[31:19] riter
[31:21] MH now are you listening right he knows
[31:24] the riter right he knows who's going to
[31:28] be riding on that red horse he knows
[31:31] who's going to be riding on that black
[31:33] horse amen he knows who's going to be
[31:36] riding on the paale
[31:37] horse that doesn't break the
[31:40] SE right cuz he's a lot more to the
[31:46] seal now remember to find
[31:51] Satan and to know it's him is
[31:56] wonderful but that's not a symbol of a
[31:59] church
[32:04] right you got to break the other symbols
[32:07] right to be able to see that it's a
[32:10] symbol of a church and things
[32:14] right see so it's the same riter every
[32:19] time because it's the devil right yes
[32:22] amen he's just changing his mask mhm
[32:25] changing his way he revealing himself or
[32:28] making himself
[32:29] known because he's trying his best to do
[32:32] but he always does everything in copy
[32:34] after that's right God revealing
[32:38] himself that's why I've always told you
[32:41] then the reveal the devil is not the
[32:44] seals right that's right amen you just
[32:48] broke a symbol y
[32:50] amen you didn't reveal the devil you
[32:52] can't reveal the devil ain't no devil to
[32:55] Reeve reveal right
[32:57] brother Dale there is a
[33:01] devil now don't think I'm that carnal
[33:04] that I don't know what I'm
[33:07] saying the devil's not a
[33:09] person right oh you can call him the
[33:11] person of the devil you can say those
[33:13] say but he's not a person
[33:17] right he has no body spirit and soul to
[33:21] display himself
[33:23] right that's what he tried to do in the
[33:26] garden
[33:27] right through Eve and the
[33:30] Beast to try to enter the human
[33:33] race MH he can't
[33:39] create that was the one thing
[33:40] withholding from
[33:44] him he said but brother Dale don't you
[33:47] think the devil's real yeah he's a real
[33:50] devil right sure
[33:53] is but he doesn't have a body spirit and
[33:55] soul to display himself
[33:58] right if he had it he would went
[34:00] straight to Eve
[34:04] right come on
[34:06] right so we had to use something
[34:09] vicarious
[34:11] mhm he entered the
[34:14] Beast and used that Beast to talk to Eve
[34:19] right he could have spoke to her maybe
[34:22] in some ways through her inner being
[34:28] y but he's got to have somebody to talk
[34:31] through amen that's right so he entered
[34:34] the
[34:35] Beast and used the beast's
[34:38] voice to
[34:42] speak now remember Satan is a created
[34:45] being right amen mhm he was the anointed
[34:49] sherff that Stood Beside the Lord
[34:52] right he's even called in the Bible a
[34:55] man
[34:58] M the scripture he's called a man but
[35:02] that don't mean he's got a body spirit
[35:03] and soul
[35:07] right
[35:11] no he cannot do anything unless he's
[35:15] permitted to do it that's
[35:18] right we'll get to it a
[35:21] minute he has no power
[35:25] no oh look what the devil can do he
[35:29] can't do anything to you unless God
[35:31] allows him if we'd ever get that into
[35:33] our heads amen you know that's right of
[35:36] course that's what people do you
[35:38] know I've been honest with you all I'm
[35:41] trying to preach to
[35:43] you there's things that come up on these
[35:45] human bodies is because of the
[35:47] deterioration it's not to say oh the
[35:50] devil after me I got a bad C well that
[35:54] may be
[35:55] true
[35:57] but it might be because that you run out
[35:59] without a coat on when it was cold
[36:01] that's right so you going to be the
[36:03] devil that made yourself get it all
[36:05] right that's right see there's things
[36:08] that are brought on us because of life
[36:12] right well the devil's making me older
[36:15] now he ain't making you older he can't
[36:17] do that that's right yep that's right
[36:22] come on the Bible says the devil is like
[36:26] a man
[36:27] l in a ditch it has no strength I'm
[36:30] quoting scripture to you and why are we
[36:33] afraid of him right right when the first
[36:36] heal shows you ain't nothing but a bluff
[36:37] anyway right amen cuz he don't have no
[36:40] arrow for his bow right
[36:43] amen we just read
[36:46] it yep you see that's what I'm saying we
[36:50] we look at at it we think well I
[36:52] understand
[36:54] that but really do we
[36:57] right
[36:59] amen why are you afraid of the
[37:03] devil you me like that fell would I
[37:05] heard a story about a man that walking
[37:07] down the road and this guy said his
[37:09] buddy you know he crawled up in the
[37:10] bushes
[37:12] and pull a joke on his buddy and he come
[37:15] walking by and he said hey
[37:18] John he stopped looking him he said I'm
[37:22] the
[37:23] devil I'm coming after you he already
[37:27] praising the Lord he said you don't
[37:29] understand I'm the devil he said I
[37:31] didn't know he that far away from
[37:33] me right we ought to realize that that's
[37:37] right but get the point then when we go
[37:39] through you'll
[37:41] see Satan he's not a person in the point
[37:46] of being a body spirit and soul right he
[37:50] can be called a person or a fellow or a
[37:53] guy or even a
[37:55] man
[37:57] you said well anything a man got to have
[37:59] Body Spirit and soul well see that's
[38:00] where you're missing it right you're
[38:02] taking your
[38:03] theological
[38:06] interpretation right you know what I
[38:08] mean your own
[38:10] idea W you just listen to the word and
[38:14] read
[38:19] it you see that
[38:21] Antichrist he only started out as a
[38:24] spirit MH we gave you the quotes where
[38:28] that when Jesus was
[38:31] here Judas was here
[38:35] right when Jesus was crucified Judas
[38:38] went to a cross y right when the Holy
[38:41] Ghost came back on the day of
[38:43] Pentecost the Antichrist come
[38:46] back and started dealing with the
[38:49] church to deceive it that's
[38:52] right what does the prophet called the
[38:54] devil's work attempt
[38:57] destruction of God's
[39:00] word if he can get you to doubt the word
[39:03] of God that's right as being true that's
[39:05] right he's got you amen that's right yes
[39:09] sir we'll find out in a minute he has no
[39:12] Crown you got to be given one right amen
[39:17] well God never gave the devil a
[39:20] crown that's
[39:24] right come on God didn't give him ground
[39:27] that's
[39:28] right we
[39:30] did that's
[39:33] right you say yeah but those people are
[39:35] wonderful people I agree with you but
[39:38] you know why don't we ever thank God for
[39:39] being not being the fact that he didn't
[39:41] let us be to see right amen right we
[39:45] don't have anything against people and
[39:46] their ideas right in
[39:50] churches it's just the fact of trying to
[39:52] find the truth to get us out of here
[39:54] amen right they have to answer to God
[39:57] for their own selves right but get the
[40:00] point now what I'm talking about the
[40:03] Antichrist he starts out as a
[40:11] spirit it's Satan has a deceptive
[40:16] Spirit to try to enter into you and I
[40:20] right okay you don't have much trouble
[40:22] doing that but we were born kin folk to
[40:25] him whether you like it or not you can
[40:28] holler we're talking a while ago about
[40:30] seeds and what people believe in this m
[40:32] you can holler all you want to about
[40:34] seeds and how you come here with eternal
[40:38] life you know people take that they
[40:42] quote brother random oh we come here
[40:44] with eternal life but if he did Jesus
[40:46] Christ died in vain absolutely so
[40:48] something's wrong right the prophet's
[40:50] not saying what we think then is he
[40:54] right all right
[40:57] you see it's time to line it up and get
[40:59] it right amen and quit playing
[41:02] around because we got to walk out of
[41:04] here amen that's right and I don't know
[41:06] if another message has got anything in
[41:08] it do you no no
[41:10] sir I mean this is the only one I know
[41:13] it's got the truth in it
[41:15] amen see get the Antichrist down is what
[41:18] he
[41:19] is the Antichrist is Satan amen that's
[41:25] right he's a spirit right right
[41:30] yep all the Old Testament that's where
[41:33] people don't like me to preach this
[41:35] way but it was never but one man and one
[41:39] woman and they don't most of them even
[41:41] agree with a man they don't want to
[41:43] agree with Eve at it but I believe Adam
[41:44] and Eve had eternal life in their soul
[41:47] amen as an impartation not a birth right
[41:51] they never went to a birth they didn't
[41:52] have to go through justification baptism
[41:55] over it was parted right right into Adam
[41:59] but nobody after them no so everybody
[42:02] after them K folks to the devil right
[42:06] amen right well brother D oh no they had
[42:11] they had an anointing of the Holy Spirit
[42:14] that's right that's why you're Prophet
[42:16] we were talking about one ago he said
[42:18] David
[42:19] said Thy word have I hid in my heart
[42:23] right that I might not sin against thee
[42:25] right you know what R and say it I
[42:27] believe it's the the birth plan spoken
[42:29] word Original
[42:32] Seed he said David needed the baptism of
[42:35] the Holy Ghost that's right said he had
[42:38] everything right right but he didn't
[42:40] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:41] that's right he had an anointing that
[42:43] could kill a bar a lion or a giant or
[42:46] whatever but when that LE him he could
[42:48] go out and take his best friend's wife
[42:50] and how the man killed yeah and try to
[42:52] cover it up right don't look like a born
[42:55] again Christian no that's
[42:58] right see that's why the prophet would
[43:01] say
[43:02] then these seals just spoke up from
[43:05] Genesis right amen and go all the way
[43:07] back in Genesis and follow it down mhm Y
[43:11] and see what's going on and look back
[43:14] there and
[43:15] see that Eve was deceived right then it
[43:19] went on over Cain was
[43:25] deceived
[43:28] see then Abel was just as perverted as
[43:31] Cain because of this way he come in to
[43:35] the world right
[43:37] amen no Abel was a seat of
[43:42] God go
[43:45] ahead go
[43:47] ahead but he was lost that's right he
[43:51] needed a savior yeah he said how do you
[43:53] know that because he offered a sacrifice
[43:55] that's solve the
[43:57] problem if he didn't need a savior he'd
[44:00] have been standing back Kan you go ahead
[44:02] I don't need
[44:03] it always was
[44:06] eternal yes sir now none of that will
[44:08] fit no
[44:10] amen would you see church until we're
[44:12] born
[44:13] again that devil is living in our soul
[44:18] right because of the perversion and the
[44:21] fall right right
[44:23] amen that's why you got to be born again
[44:26] amen that's right you got to get him out
[44:29] of there we you get the life of God
[44:31] inside of there amen then we can say
[44:33] we're a child of God that's right so no
[44:36] wonder the world is
[44:39] deceived only those who have the new
[44:43] birth is the only ones who can
[44:45] understand amen Satan in his
[44:49] ways that's right man right that's right
[44:54] that's right he
[44:57] so only those that are born again know
[45:00] the difference
[45:01] right now you know the
[45:06] quotes but yet what is quotes without a
[45:10] God to reveal it Revelation amen all
[45:13] right so let's get started now on
[45:15] something I want you to just hold a
[45:16] point through of what I'm talking
[45:20] about
[45:22] Satan rides that first horse while gets
[45:26] off gets on the red right rides it a
[45:28] while gets off on the black rides it a
[45:31] while comes up over on the Pale Horse
[45:35] amen that's just the symbol of the
[45:39] rider
[45:40] amen right you will a first seal yeah
[45:44] what do you ask people what's the first
[45:46] seal
[45:52] Antichrist I thought the seals was to
[45:54] reveal Jesus Christ amen yes that's
[45:56] right and we would see the Antichrist in
[45:58] opposition right amen riding away
[46:02] amen I didn't know the seals was to
[46:04] reveal the devil I thought I just read
[46:07] to you in Revelations one there that
[46:09] this is a revelation of Jesus Christ MH
[46:13] doesn't say anything about the devil
[46:15] right and I hope you understand what I'm
[46:17] saying he's not a he's not a man body
[46:20] spirit and soul so you're not trying to
[46:22] reveal him amen right you already to
[46:24] know who he is
[46:27] oh but brother Dale he is so sweet when
[46:31] he when when the Lord speaks to me he
[46:33] just so sweet Noble but when the devil
[46:34] speaks he just hard I think you got it
[46:37] backwards right amen honest as I can be
[46:40] amen that's right the devil sweet talks
[46:43] you God says sit down shut up and act
[46:48] like a child of God that's right he
[46:50] never told you like that right you got a
[46:52] treat treat coming when he does one day
[46:56] that's right he tells you to quit crying
[46:57] like a baby that's right and get on with
[47:01] living for him yeah am ain't too much
[47:03] sweet sometimes in his voice that's
[47:05] right in Pharisees sure didn't think and
[47:08] he had a good voice when he said you are
[47:10] your are of your father the devil right
[47:13] and his works you will do right right
[47:16] the devil was saying cus you're the high
[47:19] priest everything's wonderful sweet when
[47:21] the Messiah comes he'll walk down this
[47:23] carpet that'll roll out and walk right
[47:25] up to you and say oh great
[47:28] cus that wasn't exactly the
[47:30] way the story goes right all right I get
[47:34] off on
[47:35] that sometimes I get to preach and I'd
[47:37] rather just
[47:39] talk let's just start reading just a
[47:41] little bit and just pick up some
[47:44] thoughts and follow our line so go ahead
[47:47] brother number
[47:53] one this is taken from the first seal
[47:57] paragraph
[48:00] 293 you want me to tell
[48:03] you he's talking about how who he is
[48:05] he's Mighty and conquering power
[48:09] watch watch in the minute where he gets
[48:12] it is a great fellow in his conquering
[48:15] power you want me to tell you who he is
[48:18] he's the
[48:19] Antichrist that's exactly what he
[48:23] is one
[48:26] so close together until it would deceive
[48:28] the very leg the bride if it was
[48:31] possible Antichrist is the Antichrist
[48:34] Spirit right amen
[48:36] right now nobody in the early age would
[48:39] have accepted
[48:41] anybody walking out there and
[48:44] says you got to believe me right they
[48:48] didn't seem too many of get in trouble
[48:50] about that they knew the stories about
[48:53] how that you know dayon and cor said
[48:56] Moses you take too much on yourself
[48:58] we're spiritual
[49:00] too they didn't seen that they does seen
[49:04] the great acts in the book of Acts by
[49:06] the what
[49:07] Simeon one of those guys that
[49:12] was using the spirit of the devil Simon
[49:18] Simon and they done rebuked all of that
[49:20] right sure did and they does seen no
[49:24] seven sons of scuba run in there and
[49:26] trying to cast out that devil Y and it
[49:28] didn't work that's right they didn't see
[49:31] what happened to them
[49:33] amen so it wouldn't be a man walk out it
[49:36] wouldn't be someone walk out in that
[49:38] first church age and say hey I'm the
[49:40] devil you got to believe
[49:44] me because he ain't going to
[49:47] say under the second seal I'm the devil
[49:51] right he ain't going to say under the
[49:53] third one or the fourth one right
[49:57] amen when he becomes literally the Beast
[50:00] is he going to walk in the temple and
[50:01] say I'm the devil no
[50:05] right he's going to say what he's always
[50:08] saying I am instead of God right amen
[50:12] because they got enough sense to know
[50:15] how many popes have they
[50:18] had right sure right M two or 300 poke
[50:24] mhm
[50:27] well did the did the God die when the PO
[50:29] died no they believe the Incarnate God
[50:32] moved over incarnate into the next po
[50:35] right right right right right so don't
[50:38] think he'll ever come to you and say I'm
[50:40] the devil Fall Down and Worship
[50:43] me when he come to Martin or which one
[50:46] it was he told him he was Jesus
[50:49] Christ he seen him and he throw to
[50:51] Inkwell at him said get out of
[50:53] here but he you he was
[50:57] right so don't ever look for the devil
[50:59] to walk up to you and say I want you to
[51:02] know I'm the
[51:03] devil no right he's always going to tell
[51:06] you he's Jesus Christ sure that's right
[51:09] he's God are instead of
[51:12] God
[51:13] right so then think about
[51:19] him look at the next one paragraph
[51:24] 266
[51:28] he's talking about this
[51:30] Antichrist he had a bow in his hand
[51:32] which meant little Cupid that's what
[51:34] they used to
[51:35] think he shot the arrows of love into
[51:37] the hearts of the people the love of God
[51:40] and he conquered that's what man used to
[51:41] teach that's what your your theologians
[51:44] teach about the white horse
[51:47] rider now that sounds very good but it
[51:49] isn't true no sir that it wasn't what
[51:52] does mean righteous we we realize that
[51:56] that white means righteous the teachers
[51:58] taught it that it was the Holy Spirit
[52:00] conquering in the first Age and what but
[52:02] my revelation of it by the holy spirit
[52:05] is not that way now watch his
[52:07] Revelation my Revelation by the holy
[52:09] spirit is Christ and the Holy Spirit is
[52:13] the selfs same person right
[52:16] amen only in a different form so here
[52:20] stands the L stands Christ the lamb we
[52:23] know he was the lamb he standing here
[52:25] with the books in his hand and there
[52:28] goes this White Horse writer see it
[52:30] wasn't the Holy Spirit right all
[52:34] right now are you following it
[52:40] right where would a trinitarian ever be
[52:44] able to seals to break to
[52:47] them
[52:48] right CU he says
[52:53] Christ yep the holy spirit is a selfs
[52:56] same person amen that's right and he
[52:59] says in the lamb is that
[53:02] person so then your revelation of one
[53:10] God so it was simple you remember I'm I
[53:14] preached this in 79 let Al 8182 in
[53:18] there so brother random was standing
[53:21] there and
[53:22] he he was talking about a white horse
[53:24] rider
[53:27] so he says here stands a lamb with a
[53:28] book in his
[53:30] hand and out there goes the White Horse
[53:33] riter see he knew he was seeing two
[53:36] people that's
[53:38] right one standing there as the
[53:41] lamb which was Christ almighty
[53:45] God the other was another fell riding
[53:48] off
[53:49] right so he knew immediately that there
[53:52] was a
[53:53] problem that that that's how easy it was
[53:56] to be revealed to the prophet that it
[53:58] was the Antichrist it was Satan
[54:02] amen anytime you see two people in the
[54:04] Bible That's why I said a trinitarian
[54:06] can't figure that out see he got people
[54:08] here people there person here and person
[54:10] he just got all kind
[54:13] of the Holy Ghost you ever heard
[54:17] trinitarian the Holy Ghost sent the Holy
[54:20] Spirit down with a sperm into the wound
[54:23] of the Virgin Mary you know
[54:27] got to have Father Son and Holy Ghost
[54:30] involved you never heart hurt him where
[54:33] the Bible said If you deny the father
[54:35] you deny the son which is proven that
[54:37] there's just one God you ain't never
[54:39] talked with one or have excuse me I use
[54:41] the word ant that's okay it's in the
[54:42] dictionary
[54:44] now you never heard them say if I deny
[54:48] the father I'll deny the son and I'm not
[54:51] going to deny I'm going to keep my three
[54:53] person no matter what you say Mery
[54:58] Lord the Baptist I've told you over and
[55:01] over teach and believe even to this day
[55:04] that there's just one God sure
[55:10] right but they say he's God in three
[55:13] persons Blessed
[55:16] Trinity coequal and co-eternal
[55:20] I've made the statements over and over
[55:22] to you and they back here in my office
[55:23] if you want them go into Wikipedia and
[55:26] run up NN counsel 325 ad and it'll give
[55:29] you the the NN counsel and tell you what
[55:32] they were arguing Aras and athanasius
[55:34] was arguing athus was saying that Jesus
[55:38] was a different
[55:40] substance Aras would say I already
[55:42] pronounced his name that he was the same
[55:45] substance right you ask most people to
[55:47] quote the first the Nan
[55:52] Creed have you ever read the Nan Creed
[55:59] at 3:25 ad they establish a Creed right
[56:02] a statement of Doctrine
[56:05] y that statement says that Jesus was
[56:09] almighty God
[56:15] creator and they
[56:18] lambasted or eus for his
[56:23] Doctrine
[56:26] but you need to keep reading a little
[56:28] bit cuz somebody I forgot who it was was
[56:30] giving it to me Sunday sister barara who
[56:33] who gave me that Sunday try Trudy
[56:36] cassant
[56:38] right at
[56:40] 381 MH they added some words to the naan
[56:45] Creed and said Mary the Mother of
[56:51] God we see most people would read
[56:53] something like that but the original Nan
[56:57] Creed states that Jesus was almighty God
[57:01] and there is no other God right
[57:05] amen but then the deception got easing
[57:08] in see right and they started changing
[57:11] it then it begin to bring in all of the
[57:14] other things I wish you'd read
[57:16] it of how the pope had come into the
[57:19] view right now he got
[57:22] started did you see you say one
[57:26] God you know that the muhammadans
[57:29] believe in one God his name is Allah
[57:32] that's
[57:34] right see the world never did believe in
[57:37] a trinitarian Doctrine right until the
[57:39] Catholic Church come
[57:42] along it took to about 606 before the
[57:45] water baptism was
[57:47] changed made into Father Son and Holy
[57:50] Ghost would you hear Brother Ram say at
[57:53] a n see en C 325 ad about everything
[57:57] happened right there it didn't happen
[57:59] there no
[58:00] right he knew
[58:03] it it took time right to get that
[58:06] Doctrine the deception I talking about
[58:08] Sunday into the mind of man right amen
[58:12] like we were talking one ago and I told
[58:14] him I said if time lasted in 100 years
[58:18] from
[58:20] now our great great great great
[58:22] grandchildren ever how long it take
[58:24] great great great I guess or something
[58:26] you know what they
[58:27] say Jesus was married I saw I I didn't
[58:32] see it but Grandpa told me he saw a
[58:37] movie then got it in your mind
[58:40] right they don't got it in your mind M
[58:46] right Y Wonder on the people in this
[58:49] message don't come up with it yeah
[58:52] preacher so call yeah they to go with
[58:55] everything else
[58:57] right but listen
[59:00] church if there just one true and living
[59:05] God and that God is the Lord Jesus
[59:08] Christ there is not another
[59:12] god let's see how does the scripture
[59:14] says those that be Gods yeah there's
[59:17] God's plural right sure 30 how many 300
[59:20] something million in what is the number
[59:22] 300 and something million in India in
[59:24] India right of gods and
[59:29] goddesses but
[59:31] listen when that Prophet seen that lamb
[59:35] standing there he seen that devil riding
[59:37] off
[59:38] right that seal broke right there right
[59:42] it unfolded the
[59:45] symbols that mankind had been deceived
[59:49] by You See It Was the Same Old Devil in
[59:52] his ways right
[59:56] but then we're not going to be able to
[59:57] have time to get on over into the
[1:00:00] other but
[1:00:02] remember there's a whole lot more
[1:00:04] symbols there it's got to be
[1:00:08] broke we'll try to cover a little
[1:00:12] bit this
[1:00:15] Antichrist he has no arrow for his boat
[1:00:19] so he's a bluff right right what the
[1:00:22] prophet called him a
[1:00:26] bluff he said that devil that when he HS
[1:00:29] Boo at you yep he said just boo back at
[1:00:32] it that's
[1:00:34] right like I always try to tell
[1:00:36] everybody the devil tells you all about
[1:00:40] what you've done in your life
[1:00:42] right you remember you done this you
[1:00:44] done that you done this you can't be
[1:00:46] saved cuz look how bad you are
[1:00:49] yeah would you stop him and say Satan
[1:00:52] I'd like to make one point
[1:00:57] there is a possibility of me and being
[1:01:00] saved but there's no possibility for you
[1:01:03] that's right that's right and let me
[1:01:05] tell you what the Bible says about where
[1:01:09] you're going to be cast into the Lake of
[1:01:13] Fire that's right
[1:01:15] amen the Bible says that right that's
[1:01:17] right amen amen the devil is going to be
[1:01:20] cast into the Lake of Fire right amen
[1:01:23] remind him
[1:01:26] of where he's going right
[1:01:30] amen get get the point let's move
[1:01:34] on see the prophet explains then in the
[1:01:37] first
[1:01:38] seal there was no ARS for the bow right
[1:01:42] so it was symbol of a
[1:01:45] spirit no nothing of his own you
[1:01:48] couldn't do anything with the
[1:01:50] bow I've asked you to read the seal book
[1:01:55] but how many has kept my lessons and
[1:01:57] done and tried to read with me then when
[1:02:00] I get up here and try to preach I don't
[1:02:02] know where you said that or not you know
[1:02:04] why cuz you ain't never read the
[1:02:11] book all
[1:02:13] right but look what he says about the
[1:02:15] devil
[1:02:17] now this is in the first seal I want
[1:02:20] gohe with number
[1:02:22] three paragraph 367
[1:02:25] now remember the Antichrist and Beast is
[1:02:28] the same self
[1:02:31] Spirit there Earth the Trinity yeser is
[1:02:34] three stages of the same devil
[1:02:37] power remember niia see it had to be
[1:02:41] incarnate before it could be crowned
[1:02:45] right and watch this three stages first
[1:02:49] stage he's called Antichrist second
[1:02:52] stage he's called a false prophet third
[1:02:55] stage he's called the beast now we get
[1:02:57] on over in a minute where there the four
[1:03:00] stages we don't need to go there let's
[1:03:04] just think about it
[1:03:08] right you can't Crown a
[1:03:12] spirit so you have to do
[1:03:16] something think so you get a false
[1:03:21] Propet how comes a false prophet
[1:03:26] preaching the
[1:03:29] doctrine that the Antichrist had right
[1:03:33] that's why it's called a false
[1:03:36] prophet
[1:03:38] right see you can't crown
[1:03:41] him because you can't
[1:03:45] tell he's not out in the open enough for
[1:03:48] you to be able to see what's going
[1:03:50] on he's just teaching the doctrine of
[1:03:54] the
[1:03:55] Antichrist so he's called a false
[1:03:59] prophet you know I've been through it so
[1:04:01] week or so
[1:04:03] ago that people read that and they don't
[1:04:05] even they just say three stages the
[1:04:08] Antichrist will read in a minute four
[1:04:10] stages what Antichrist Prophet
[1:04:16] Pope incarnate false prophet and finally
[1:04:19] the Beast right cuz see that's for
[1:04:22] combat right man you Mark Luke John L ox
[1:04:26] man Eagle right all right
[1:04:31] now so what is
[1:04:36] he the rider of each horse is the same
[1:04:40] going to the next
[1:04:43] now so when he starts into the second
[1:04:46] seal what does he say now here's my
[1:04:48] revelation of it this is Satan again
[1:04:52] it's the devil again in another form for
[1:04:55] what's he talking
[1:04:56] about he changed his horse went to
[1:05:02] Red it's the same
[1:05:04] devil
[1:05:06] Satan
[1:05:08] again same
[1:05:12] devil so you see it unfolding from all
[1:05:15] of the
[1:05:19] seals it's going to show
[1:05:23] Satan
[1:05:24] in the opposition of
[1:05:27] God
[1:05:29] right Satan seeing him is
[1:05:33] that Spirit form
[1:05:36] first all
[1:05:39] right he had no BS and no
[1:05:42] Arrow but he's given a
[1:05:47] crown now the false prophet that started
[1:05:51] out Paul would say there's already false
[1:05:53] prophet prophets among you
[1:05:56] yep John said that the Antichrist was
[1:05:59] already Among Us y teachings that deny
[1:06:03] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[1:06:04] he's Antichrist
[1:06:07] right Paul would speak of false
[1:06:10] prophets cuz they seen
[1:06:12] them they were already rising up
[1:06:14] teaching things like two of them always
[1:06:18] get their names wrong there but two of
[1:06:20] them was teaching that the resurrection
[1:06:22] was already passed
[1:06:25] I think it's F how many that's teaching
[1:06:28] the resurrection was already p y Paul
[1:06:32] turned them over to
[1:06:34] Satan for the destruction of the flesh
[1:06:38] right right he saw these false
[1:06:46] prophets but do you know when the pope
[1:06:48] came into
[1:06:53] being
[1:06:55] you read that in a
[1:06:59] minute it unfolds to us the prophet said
[1:07:02] that it's the same
[1:07:07] Rider Changing Horses right that's
[1:07:11] right horses are powers are symbols amen
[1:07:15] and that's is where your church starts
[1:07:16] coming into
[1:07:18] view as the power cuz where does the PO
[1:07:22] get his crown
[1:07:25] right from the people amen
[1:07:28] right see by the time the pope came into
[1:07:31] being it had to start out with false
[1:07:33] prophet Bishops etc etc falling in and
[1:07:36] these leading to that and this you know
[1:07:38] it took quite quite a while matter of
[1:07:39] fact 300
[1:07:43] years now I didn't look up to see that's
[1:07:46] the words of the prophet he said 300
[1:07:48] years later the pope came into being you
[1:07:52] may go home and look it up and find out
[1:07:53] it's 250 years or something you know
[1:07:55] whatever just remember we're trying to
[1:07:58] say something it took a while for the
[1:08:00] pope to come into view right he didn't
[1:08:03] come into view in the book of Acts but
[1:08:05] the Antichrist and the false
[1:08:08] prophet was dealt with in the
[1:08:13] scriptures of the
[1:08:15] Apostles Paul would only speak of the
[1:08:18] man of sin sitting in the temple of God
[1:08:20] showing himself to be as
[1:08:22] God but he was looking at it to unfold
[1:08:25] later on not in his day
[1:08:28] right now when it does it comes down
[1:08:33] see he's just a blood amen right F
[1:08:37] trying to cut out
[1:08:41] something but he received a
[1:08:46] crown of Triple Crown we're read a minut
[1:08:49] yeah right over Heaven Earth in
[1:08:52] purgatory there's no such thing as
[1:08:55] Purgatory in the
[1:08:56] Bible so the pope to get it where he
[1:08:59] could control the people he come up with
[1:09:01] a Purgatory you know that every Catholic
[1:09:04] pope priest who he is has got to go
[1:09:06] according to their Doctrine to
[1:09:09] hell when they
[1:09:12] die and like I said the other day this
[1:09:15] last one was such a good guy he just
[1:09:17] made a Whistle Stop and they bounced him
[1:09:19] right back out of there and he's
[1:09:21] probably already in heaven as far as
[1:09:22] their Doctrine is concerned but they
[1:09:25] believe that everybody's got to go to
[1:09:27] hell but that's where you come up with a
[1:09:29] Purgatory where he can scare you with
[1:09:32] it you get excommunicated from the
[1:09:34] Catholic Church you realize to them
[1:09:37] there is
[1:09:38] no hopes of you ever being saved
[1:09:44] right they give you a chance to repent
[1:09:46] you won't do it they gave it to Martin
[1:09:48] Luther he said I've said what I said
[1:09:51] right he was excommunicated from the C
[1:09:54] Church which meant according to their
[1:09:56] Doctrine he was
[1:09:57] dead I'm glad God didn't believe their
[1:10:00] Doctrine right amen aren't you amen but
[1:10:03] get what I'm talking about a crown was
[1:10:05] given
[1:10:07] him the people crowned
[1:10:10] him the people that had the same
[1:10:13] identical Antichrist
[1:10:16] spirit and it went into their false
[1:10:18] prophets and they begin to preach it and
[1:10:21] then one day it was incarnate in a pope
[1:10:25] right a
[1:10:29] pope the Pope in his original
[1:10:33] Beginnings I'm reading this out of
[1:10:36] Wikipedia he didn't have the full
[1:10:39] Authority even though he had a
[1:10:42] crown but as it went along it began to
[1:10:45] designate him as the final Authority y
[1:10:50] there's many splits in the Catholic
[1:10:52] Church over the authority of the Pope
[1:10:56] they used to be two different
[1:10:58] popes that was back in
[1:11:01] history but get the point one
[1:11:03] com where did he get that Crown cuz that
[1:11:06] first seal that and a crown was given
[1:11:11] him
[1:11:14] right now come on follow my
[1:11:17] points the church gave him the crown
[1:11:20] amen that's right that's
[1:11:22] right
[1:11:24] I didn't say the bride I said the church
[1:11:27] right right but the bride was caught up
[1:11:30] in it brother R said they should have
[1:11:32] never went to n right right right why
[1:11:38] because they brought back that Doctrine
[1:11:40] y he said oh no they
[1:11:42] didn't well argue with your a
[1:11:47] prophet until it come into the time of
[1:11:50] later on we get in the Dark Ages and
[1:11:52] thing until the light is totally put out
[1:11:54] that's right through the
[1:11:57] symbols but
[1:11:59] listen a crown was given God never gave
[1:12:02] that man a crown
[1:12:05] right that was Satan
[1:12:08] right that had
[1:12:10] become not totally incarnate as the
[1:12:14] beast but he had become incarnate into a
[1:12:18] head man called a pope
[1:12:22] right he could change the rules do what
[1:12:24] he wanted
[1:12:26] to you differed with him out you
[1:12:30] went he was given the
[1:12:33] power he was given the
[1:12:39] crown a triple ruling Crown you see over
[1:12:41] there I'm
[1:12:43] wrong over Heaven Earth in
[1:12:52] purgatory the church wound up to be the
[1:12:54] most powerful organized religion there
[1:12:56] is and still is today
[1:13:00] right more land is owned by the church
[1:13:04] systems than any other Corporation Etc
[1:13:07] or whatever that's why they're going to
[1:13:09] try to take away your tax
[1:13:14] status they're working on it they're
[1:13:16] taking
[1:13:18] away because they own millions of
[1:13:21] billions of acres of land right or
[1:13:23] properties is owned by the churches that
[1:13:26] is taxfree
[1:13:33] right who gave that hope is Crown the
[1:13:37] people amen right right that's
[1:13:42] right he just had a little Doctrine
[1:13:45] little idea got to reminds you of what
[1:13:48] happened in heaven don't
[1:13:52] it Lucifer Satan and his angels what was
[1:13:56] Satan trying to do in
[1:13:59] heaven take over
[1:14:03] right and he got all of got one3 and
[1:14:07] know brother say 2/3 the angels of
[1:14:10] heaven believe Satan's
[1:14:12] lie and we're cast out right
[1:14:16] right those were in the days of demon
[1:14:19] Spirits right not in human occupation
[1:14:23] you know
[1:14:24] people but he came to Earth and brother
[1:14:27] R said them demons that
[1:14:30] fail gave us a
[1:14:33] nature sure that's what I was talking
[1:14:35] about a while ago we're born kin folks
[1:14:38] to the devil right amen right and we're
[1:14:40] trained from the minute we open our eyes
[1:14:43] a little old baby he can't hard do
[1:14:44] nothing and lights is all over the place
[1:14:47] he's lay there and this nurse says boy
[1:14:50] something in blankety blank baby born
[1:14:52] all here on full of the Moon more little
[1:14:55] kid all years in bad
[1:15:00] words you know you don't have to teach
[1:15:02] your kids to say bad words no that's
[1:15:05] right right Mama and Daddy don't say
[1:15:09] them grandma grandpa don't say them
[1:15:12] aunts and uncles don't say them they're
[1:15:14] still say
[1:15:15] them
[1:15:18] why you ask that little old kid he's
[1:15:20] standing there with cookie all over his
[1:15:22] hand cookie all over his face you ask
[1:15:24] him said you eat that
[1:15:30] cookies I know you don't like me in my
[1:15:32] ways but you look down at a little fell
[1:15:34] and you say ain't a pretty little
[1:15:40] devil oh you don't like that about your
[1:15:43] kids or grandkids or something like that
[1:15:46] especially but until that baby's born
[1:15:48] again right right mhm that's right he
[1:15:52] got somebody he's more K to than you are
[1:15:54] righten
[1:15:56] amen but
[1:15:58] listen he's just a bluff why we're
[1:16:01] afraid
[1:16:05] of he was they were the people gave him
[1:16:08] the crown we'll get down to that quote
[1:16:10] to me if time look at the next one let
[1:16:12] see wait a minut let me jump up to
[1:16:15] number seven we bypass a couple
[1:16:18] of book number
[1:16:22] seven
[1:16:26] cuz you see Satan has no
[1:16:29] power
[1:16:31] yep the Bible says it only Powers that's
[1:16:34] given them God right that's right Satan
[1:16:37] don't have no power unless we give it to
[1:16:39] him right that's right he didn't have a
[1:16:42] crown till the people gave it to him
[1:16:44] right he wasn't able to kill until he
[1:16:46] got somebody they would follow his
[1:16:48] orders right and do the killing look
[1:16:52] what he says about it
[1:16:53] don't about the power of life and death
[1:16:55] that's the only two
[1:16:57] powers and Satan can only his power he's
[1:17:01] got is the perverted power of God it
[1:17:04] isn't no real power it's a perversion of
[1:17:06] God's power yep death is only perversion
[1:17:10] yeah look what he calls it in the Third
[1:17:13] Exodus number
[1:17:19] eight I got
[1:17:22] 152
[1:17:23] the enemy
[1:17:24] will purpose always his
[1:17:27] system and unbelief will accept it
[1:17:31] because the enemy is the intellectual
[1:17:34] sign now remember there's only two don't
[1:17:38] forget this there's only two
[1:17:40] Powers now I'm he's going to be down
[1:17:42] here in a minute and answer
[1:17:44] okay one is spiritual power of the Holy
[1:17:47] Spirit the other one is the devil
[1:17:49] working through
[1:17:51] intellectual power
[1:17:54] power
[1:17:56] yep it's on the paragraph up above on
[1:17:59] the other one he has
[1:18:01] only intellectual
[1:18:04] power he doesn't have any power of his
[1:18:06] own right only what God give him or
[1:18:09] allowed to work
[1:18:11] right he allowed that deception to come
[1:18:15] in to try the real bride right amen
[1:18:19] Satan don't have any power well there
[1:18:21] two Powers right
[1:18:24] what did Brother around say one is
[1:18:25] spiritual power of the Holy Spirit the
[1:18:27] other one is the devil working to
[1:18:28] intellectual for that's where he entered
[1:18:31] in the Garden of Eden through
[1:18:34] intellectual powers to make Eve believe
[1:18:37] in intellectual conception against the
[1:18:39] word that's as plain as could be even
[1:18:41] the kids get
[1:18:43] it y listen church he has no
[1:18:49] power he can't do anything with you
[1:18:51] until God turns him loose right
[1:18:55] right he allowed these things to happen
[1:19:00] the prophet says and the Bible said to
[1:19:02] prove you and I right
[1:19:06] right God never gave Satan any power to
[1:19:10] control you
[1:19:13] with he gave him powers and abilities to
[1:19:17] inflict to do
[1:19:20] whatever but the holy spirit is there to
[1:19:22] control you and I amen thank you
[1:19:27] Lord see you still afraid of the devil
[1:19:29] and
[1:19:31] why why are you afraid of the
[1:19:35] devil you can't do anything until God
[1:19:38] permits it right amen that's
[1:19:42] it he can't take your life until God
[1:19:47] permits him to take you right you want
[1:19:51] scripture Jo
[1:19:55] God said you can take him do what you
[1:19:59] want to with him but you can't touch his
[1:20:02] life
[1:20:05] Bible might read the book of job you
[1:20:08] couldn't touch
[1:20:09] him Satan can only be permitted and he
[1:20:13] was permitted to take the church
[1:20:16] down but it would really to try the real
[1:20:20] genuine you remember that
[1:20:23] scripture back there where it talks
[1:20:24] about if a Prophet come among you and
[1:20:26] give a sign and the sign come to pass he
[1:20:30] takes you to another God don't believe
[1:20:31] him said I've done that to prove
[1:20:37] you but Brother D I ain't never give no
[1:20:40] crown or no
[1:20:47] pop you remember one we read there the
[1:20:49] other day where brother R said you talk
[1:20:51] about a preacher and a in a
[1:20:54] denominational Church yeah he said do

[1:22:48] Doctrine I said I'll give you money a

[1:24:50] got a crown later see when they that
[1:24:52] Spirit became incarnate see he become a

[1:25:18] Earth in purgatory right yep he became
[1:25:22] the one who stands between you and

[1:25:44] right see 300 years later he became a
[1:25:48] pope he didn't start out right with a
[1:25:50] pope start with that's right
[1:25:53] and who made him a
[1:25:55] popee the people amen right like I said
[1:25:59] a moment ago isn't it odd the pope

[1:26:22] elect him another
[1:26:24] God
[1:26:26] right come on right one who stands in
[1:26:30] for
[1:26:32] right that's why I don't allow around
[1:26:34] here we put too much emphasis on this F

[1:26:39] right CU there ain't no F coming out of
[1:26:41] this thing that's right amen but around
[1:26:44] them is our Authority

[1:26:59] calling names no more I said I'm I'm
[1:27:01] through with that so I've called names a
[1:27:03] few times and found out people told me
[1:27:05] later that I was lying about it so I got
[1:27:08] where I'm trying my best not to call
[1:27:09] names but I was talking to a certain
[1:27:12] person in Israel as we were looking
[1:27:14] around through the mosque of Omar and
[1:27:16] seeing the big old rock and the hole and
[1:27:18] all that bohamad was supposed to went up
[1:27:20] through and he looked at me and he said

[1:27:27] of these for brother

[1:27:38] it they've already made
[1:27:43] it come on before he died they believed
[1:27:46] he was God right that was that snake in
[1:27:50] the people right and he was never able
[1:27:53] to kill that snake that's right cuz it
[1:27:55] went in the water people right he come
[1:27:58] out after he died right there's people
[1:28:00] believe that brother randam was almighty
[1:28:09] God little less God yeah there's people
[1:28:14] today believe that brother random is
[1:28:15] going to come back yeah and
[1:28:19] preach the things that we don't Now
[1:28:24] understand well it take him 40 years or
[1:28:26] 50 know it took him 30 something to
[1:28:29] preach what he did y way it's messed up
[1:28:31] now it take him 40 or 50 years that's
[1:28:34] right that's not a joke that's right
[1:28:36] true that's what I'm trying to show
[1:28:41] you I preached what I believe about the
[1:28:44] tent visions and the things brother
[1:28:46] around can come back and he can be here
[1:28:48] with us for 30 40 days but so will the
[1:28:51] dead Saints amen here he's got 30 40
[1:28:55] days to preach to us amen that's right
[1:28:57] but the Plan of Redemption has already
[1:28:59] been
[1:29:00] preached that's right we don't need him
[1:29:03] here to tell us how to be redeemed no
[1:29:05] right
[1:29:09] amen right come on yes I've never denied
[1:29:13] anything that he
[1:29:15] said I just try to put it in the right
[1:29:17] perspective of what I think that's
[1:29:20] right my dependence is not in the
[1:29:23] resurrection of a prophet right my
[1:29:25] dependence was in the resurrection of
[1:29:27] Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago that's
[1:29:29] right amen and for him to raise in you
[1:29:32] and I to destroy these doctrines that we
[1:29:36] have right right Paul wanted
[1:29:40] to an out
[1:29:42] resurrection that always bothered me
[1:29:44] where we talk about that R around and
[1:29:46] said y he wanted to be raised out he
[1:29:50] already understood the resurrection
[1:29:52] Jesus Christ he said he wanted to be
[1:29:53] raised out of the or the resurrection
[1:29:56] out of the Dead that was around
[1:29:58] him
[1:30:00] y the ones that was trying to deceive
[1:30:03] him
[1:30:04] right he wanted raised out of the Dead
[1:30:06] that was alive around
[1:30:09] him that's what we all already
[1:30:12] do you said what Brother D you shouldn't
[1:30:14] be so
[1:30:19] Stern let's see if I can quote brother
[1:30:23] he said you sympathize with the
[1:30:27] devil you've taken his Doctrine that's
[1:30:30] right that's a paraphrase quote right
[1:30:32] I'll be glad to find
[1:30:34] it sure he say you can't sympathize with
[1:30:37] the
[1:30:38] devil
[1:30:40] right CU if you do y he's got you right
[1:30:44] mhm oh sure
[1:30:46] yeah I don't I don't I don't sympathize
[1:30:50] with it m yeah what do we do
[1:30:57] right think about this what he's doing
[1:31:00] to you now that's right amen but what we
[1:31:03] read these going down to number 12 let
[1:31:06] me get these we'll just get
[1:31:08] quick I want to make sure you get the
[1:31:10] point of what I'm talking about you know
[1:31:13] the other day we were covering the four
[1:31:14] stages of the
[1:31:16] Antichrist we read there the first seal
[1:31:18] and we find out it's just look like a a
[1:31:21] three stages I showed you where it's the
[1:31:23] four stages to get the point the second
[1:31:25] seal paragraph 184 notice Satan's
[1:31:28] Trinity same person coming just
[1:31:30] incarnate from one to the other Rider y
[1:31:34] mhm that's the way them bugs did PL worm
[1:31:37] canor worm canor Palm worm Locust
[1:31:40] caterpillar they ate the bug the bugs
[1:31:42] ate the tree down that's what he's
[1:31:43] talking about go read it between
[1:31:46] there one to the other nickan spiritual
[1:31:50] Antichrist what spiritual Antichrist
[1:31:53] Pope false prophet Beast now he's back
[1:31:56] to the four the Beast is Satan
[1:32:00] incarnate he's back to the
[1:32:03] four now let's see if he's keeping his
[1:32:05] point right that it's the same writer go
[1:32:08] ahead
[1:32:13] 13 the four stages of his writer has
[1:32:16] been revealed the four stages of the
[1:32:19] Antichrist writing has been revealed at
[1:32:21] this time therefore they don't have to
[1:32:23] have anymore that's why you don't have
[1:32:25] any more combat Beast you only got four
[1:32:27] end of the four seal and there was four
[1:32:30] living creatures of God to announce the
[1:32:31] writing as they rode four Beast or four
[1:32:34] poers look at the next one read this one
[1:32:38] I want you to notice the four of them
[1:32:39] notice the off Mark of four other the
[1:32:41] spiritual mathematics God's God is
[1:32:44] threes this is four he's in four here
[1:32:47] first an Christ
[1:32:50] why second false prophet
[1:32:54] red third vikers of Heaven and Earth and
[1:32:58] Purgatory black that's your pope right
[1:33:04] fourth the Beast fail Satan being kicked
[1:33:07] out of
[1:33:09] heaven so he goes through Satan being
[1:33:11] kicked out first he's Antichrist just to
[1:33:14] teaching call niol and comes from that
[1:33:16] to a false prophet it's an antichrist
[1:33:18] Antichrist is against anything that's
[1:33:21] against God God's word is against God
[1:33:23] because the word is God in the beginning
[1:33:25] was the word word with God the word with
[1:33:27] made flesh when he had no thing Spirits
[1:33:31] can't be crowned going down and Pi up
[1:33:37] the drop to the 16 where we going read
[1:33:39] it go ahead number
[1:33:47] 16 notice Nic the Antichrist teaching
[1:33:50] that started in the days of Paul against
[1:33:52] God's word Antichrist and he's called
[1:33:54] again the false prophet which when the
[1:33:56] teaching become a man he was a prophet
[1:33:59] to the teaching of the hierarchy of the
[1:34:02] hierarchy of the Catholic Church the
[1:34:04] pope was the prophet to the false word
[1:34:07] and that made him a false prophet the
[1:34:09] third stag is of Beast a man crown and
[1:34:12] coming forth in the last days so it
[1:34:14] looks like he still his holy but look at
[1:34:15] his word he done said it over here four
[1:34:18] stages one Antichrist false Prophet
[1:34:23] Pope Beast Satan incarnate
[1:34:27] amen
[1:34:29] listen it's the same Rider
[1:34:34] yep but that's only the symbol of the
[1:34:36] riter right
[1:34:40] right the symbol of the rider is
[1:34:43] broken
[1:34:44] right he had no
[1:34:48] bows the horse was white right
[1:34:52] some of the
[1:34:56] church second was
[1:34:59] what he went from what Antichrist false
[1:35:03] prophet I talk about second seal now
[1:35:05] we're still in the first
[1:35:08] right because it goes from that
[1:35:13] Antichrist to a
[1:35:16] prophet because you can't start the
[1:35:18] second seal until you get a pope
[1:35:22] we'll pick that up next Wednesday the
[1:35:25] Lord
[1:35:28] willing you don't start the second
[1:35:31] seal until you see the
[1:35:34] symbols the symbol of the first is a pro
[1:35:37] it's always the rider right that's a
[1:35:39] symbol broke we know
[1:35:41] that no bow no arrows for his bow right
[1:35:45] right but he's given a crown from the
[1:35:47] church he's riding yeah the white
[1:35:50] righteous Church the prophet called it
[1:35:53] right that he's
[1:35:57] writing so the symbols is broken the
[1:35:59] first
[1:36:01] seal but just because you know that the
[1:36:04] second seal is the same Rider don't
[1:36:08] break the symbols right on the second
[1:36:14] seal that'll have to go we you have to
[1:36:16] chew
[1:36:19] on symbol of the second seal of the
[1:36:21] rider's Al
[1:36:23] broke the symbol of the third seal of
[1:36:26] the rider's Al broke the symbol of the
[1:36:29] for seal the rider off
[1:36:34] broke the symbols of what's Happening
[1:36:37] not
[1:36:40] broke see isn't that way the prophet
[1:36:42] says watch he saw the symbols of the
[1:36:47] rider he said I don't know what that
[1:36:49] seal is
[1:36:55] he knew the riter was a sign
[1:36:59] sure but he didn't know the symbols of
[1:37:02] the second
[1:37:06] seal he didn't know what the red horse
[1:37:13] meant the
[1:37:16] church there's a lot yet to be
[1:37:19] revealed amen
[1:37:22] there's plenty in the word to be
