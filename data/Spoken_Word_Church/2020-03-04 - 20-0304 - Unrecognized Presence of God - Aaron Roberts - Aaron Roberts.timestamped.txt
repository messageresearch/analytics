[39:45] god bless you and from job chapter 14
[39:49] very firm very familiar Scripture and my
[39:54] title is unrecognized presence of God
[39:57] and I want to look at unrecognized
[40:00] growth and and you know I thought about
[40:05] the spiritual growth and you know we
[40:09] look at things in our in our lives and
[40:11] we see situations happening and we don't
[40:15] see God moving and even even you know
[40:19] the natural types of spiritual we you
[40:22] know even in the natural we see things
[40:24] and we we look at things a certain way
[40:26] and we don't even realize what God's
[40:28] actually doing something even in the
[40:31] even in the natural world and you know
[40:34] it's the same way in the spiritual we
[40:35] don't see these things but he said for
[40:38] there is hope of a tree if it be cut
[40:40] down that it will sprout again and that
[40:43] the tender branch Darrell will not cease
[40:45] though the root thereof wax old and the
[40:47] earth and the stock thereof die in the
[40:50] ground yet through the scent of water it
[40:53] will bud and bring forth bowels like a
[40:55] plant but am and I've been wasted the
[40:57] way yeh man giveth up the ghost and
[41:00] where he is he as the water spell from
[41:04] the sea and the flood to camp and drive
[41:06] so man left down and rises not till the
[41:09] heavens be no more they shall they shall
[41:14] not awake nor be raised out of their
[41:16] sleep o that thou would would hide me in
[41:20] the grave and thou wouldest keep me
[41:22] secret until their wrath be passed and
[41:25] thou wouldest appoint me a set time and
[41:28] remember me said if a man die shall he
[41:33] live again all the days of my appointed
[41:35] time will I wait too much change come
[41:38] amen god bless you tonight
[41:49] y'all gotta pray for me sometimes oh I
[41:53] don't know me and brother Bob have leaky
[41:56] heads sometimes brother snap one time
[42:03] that leaky heads rarely swell but uh you
[42:12] know sometimes you just get stirred up
[42:14] sometimes you don't know you don't know
[42:16] what to do you just it just stirs you up
[42:18] sometimes and y'all just pray for me not
[42:21] I don't know how this is gonna go but I
[42:23] you know I just want to I just want to
[42:25] look at one thought is the presence of
[42:28] God being unrecognized God wants us to
[42:32] recognize what's going on and what God
[42:35] has a plan and a purpose in our life and
[42:37] you know I wanted to go back to the
[42:39] scripture because we look at this and it
[42:40] says for there is a hope of a tree
[42:42] though it be cut down and you know you
[42:46] look at a tree and if it dies or if he
[42:48] gets kind of down if there's still life
[42:50] in the and the roots of that tree poppin
[42:59] it may be mean but if but if that tree
[43:05] is in the if there's real life in that
[43:07] we're in the root of that tree no matter
[43:10] what happens to it it'll live again and
[43:12] it talks about even if it goes away and
[43:14] it says you know in order to look at
[43:17] this point that job's talking about it
[43:20] being though it said just the scent of
[43:23] water that's all it takes is just the
[43:26] scent of water and you know I want to
[43:31] get into some things I was reading the
[43:33] article sometime back and it just it
[43:35] just it just struck me and you know what
[43:38] we look at some of these things that
[43:39] just that scent of water and it'll
[43:42] sprout it'll move and you know that's
[43:45] the way things are in the spiritual but
[43:47] you know we're waiting but you know
[43:48] God's moving but you know we miss God
[43:51] moving and we fail to see that he's here
[43:54] we said we fail to see that
[43:55] God's presence is in our midst and you
[43:59] know the scripture tells us in Matthew 6
[44:03] you know you know what God says is
[44:07] eternal it's--yeah amen
[44:09] and whatever he says you don't have to
[44:11] doubt it you don't have you don't have
[44:14] to worry about what he says because if
[44:15] it's if he says it he backs it it
[44:17] because there's two immutable things
[44:19] that he can't lie and he's gotten him
[44:21] and he swore an oath that he would
[44:23] fulfill his word so the thing is is you
[44:25] and our beneficiaries tonight of what he
[44:29] has said so you know what the thing is
[44:31] we don't have to worry we don't have to
[44:33] fret because the same God that created
[44:36] created all things created you brought
[44:39] you had you had you in the end the baton
[44:41] the foreknowledge of his mind that knew
[44:43] all these things that brought you here
[44:44] tonight and knew all about you
[44:47] he knows your needs before you even
[44:49] asked him and and I just wonder I just
[44:54] want to read this scripture here Matthew
[44:55] 6 verse 24 says no man can serve two
[45:00] masters for either he will hate the one
[45:02] and love the other or else he will hold
[45:04] to the one and despise the other
[45:06] he cannot sir you cannot serve God and
[45:09] Mammon therefore I say unto you take no
[45:12] thought for your life what you shall eat
[45:14] or what shall drink nor yet for your
[45:17] body what ye shall put on is not the
[45:21] life more than meat and the body more
[45:23] than raiment behold the fowls of the air
[45:26] for they sow not neither do they reap
[45:28] nor do they nor gather into barns yet
[45:31] your heavenly Father feedeth them are ye
[45:35] not much better than they which of you
[45:38] by taking thought can add one cubit unto
[45:41] your stature and why take ye thought for
[45:44] raiment consider the lilies of the field
[45:47] how they grow they told not neither do
[45:50] they spin and yet I say that even
[45:53] Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
[45:55] like one of these
[45:57] therefore if God so clothe the grass of
[46:01] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[46:04] cast into the oven shall he not much
[46:07] more clothe you O ye of
[46:09] faith now read what he said ain't some
[46:14] about all these things he says even if
[46:16] you have little faith even if you're
[46:20] weakened and your faith he said all
[46:22] these things are still he still do these
[46:24] things for you he said therefore take no
[46:26] Thought saying what shall we eat or what
[46:29] shall we drink or wherewithal
[46:32] for all these things do the Gentiles
[46:35] seek for your heavenly Father knoweth
[46:37] that ye have need of all these things
[46:40] but seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[46:43] His righteousness and all these things
[46:45] shall be added unto you
[46:47] take therefore no thought for the morrow
[46:49] for the morrow shall take thought for
[46:51] the things of itself suffice unto the
[46:56] day is the evil thereof well if it pops
[47:05] too much I'll just use a handheld will
[47:07] that work okay if it pops too much I'll
[47:12] let me know I can get a it will work
[47:14] better this way well if it pops too much
[47:16] I don't mind I'll use I had my old or
[47:18] whatever all right bridge all right but
[47:23] no I don't want to bail the element if
[47:24] it's if it's problem okay just let me
[47:26] know I'm easy to get along with they say
[47:29] sometimes but yo yeah don't ask her
[47:34] don't ask her or your study buddy in the
[47:41] waters doing anyway but you know if you
[47:46] have a need then then he said it doesn't
[47:50] matter what you have neither and whether
[47:52] whether its food or drink of the natural
[47:55] things of life whatever you have need of
[47:57] your he knows that you have need of
[47:58] those things and he said you don't have
[48:00] to worry about those things because you
[48:02] know he said how much are you better
[48:04] than all these things that he said look
[48:05] what God has done and the beauty of
[48:09] nature the beauty of things and he was
[48:12] some about the lilies of the field and
[48:14] the fowls of the air and all these
[48:16] different things that God has done and
[48:19] he said are you not better than these
[48:21] there's
[48:22] you not think that he if he if he knows
[48:24] every time a sparrow falls brother
[48:27] branham said he he said he knows every
[48:28] time and that would bat its eye or he
[48:31] knows how much Tyler would make every
[48:33] little thing that he knows he knows you
[48:35] know the scripture tells all the hairs
[48:37] of our head are numbered all the things
[48:39] that we have need everything everything
[48:41] about you he knows about and you know
[48:44] what he cares about you he's concerned
[48:46] about you he's interested in your and
[48:48] your needs and your problems and your
[48:51] despairs and all these things he wants
[48:53] you to know that he cares for you
[48:55] and he said not only that he cares but
[48:57] he wants you to cast your cares upon him
[48:59] he wants you to bring your cares to him
[49:02] because he wants to bear your burdens he
[49:06] wants to take care of all your needs and
[49:08] yet sometimes we fail to realize that
[49:11] God's in our midst
[49:12] God is there to help us you know what no
[49:16] but that doesn't mean that we're not
[49:18] void of problems that we're not we're a
[49:20] boy of circumstances that we don't want
[49:23] to have to go through we don't have to
[49:24] face these things trials and temptations
[49:27] and problems but you know he said in all
[49:29] those things he'll make a way that we
[49:30] can escape these things he'll take us
[49:32] through these things but to desire do
[49:35] you want to go through them do you have
[49:36] have that desire to make it through
[49:38] those things you know the the person
[49:42] that I was you know I look at in the
[49:44] scripture is Gideon you know Gideon was
[49:48] was a man and you know by his birth he
[49:53] was he was a it was an air of God
[49:55] because he was because he was a part of
[49:58] the children of Israel because of who he
[50:01] was because of what he was more than he
[50:02] had though he had a birthright he had
[50:04] because you know he had that that sale
[50:07] of circumcision he had all those things
[50:09] that that made him who he was that he
[50:11] had that gift and you know what God
[50:13] called him and in the midst of all of
[50:16] these things and get an A and they stood
[50:18] there and and he was he was speaking and
[50:21] you know the angel come and spoke to him
[50:24] and you know he run from the Philistines
[50:27] and everything that was going wrong and
[50:28] all he could think about was all the
[50:29] problems and I recall a situation that
[50:32] he was in and yet when the angel
[50:34] Lord came to him and Tony said you know
[50:36] thou art a mild you man of Valor here he
[50:40] was you're a mighty man and and you and
[50:43] the thing is this he stood there and he
[50:44] said he said if God is for us if we are
[50:48] who we say we are if we're a part of the
[50:52] blessed of God if we're if we're the
[50:54] children of Abraham and these blessings
[50:56] rest on us he said why is all this be
[50:58] following us why are we in the condition
[51:00] that we're in and they stand and he's
[51:02] speaking to the angel of the Lord and
[51:04] he's asking him why is all this become
[51:06] to us why are we facing these things and
[51:08] he don't realize and when Gideon is
[51:10] standing there speaking to the angel God
[51:12] is in his midst god Braun said that was
[51:15] at the often extend another angel Lord
[51:17] that was God standing in his meds
[51:19] standing before him speaking to him and
[51:21] he wants to know where God he is God
[51:23] standing right in front of him speaking
[51:24] to it and he's telling him who he is
[51:26] think of him you're gonna be an
[51:28] overcomer there's a battle that has to
[51:31] be fought but you'll overcome but you
[51:33] know he don't even realize that he's
[51:35] been called to the battle and he's
[51:36] already been given the victory the
[51:39] victory was he is any stander
[51:43] why is all this befallen us why because
[51:45] you can overcome that's what that's
[51:49] what's be given to us I don't know why
[51:56] we go through the battles we go through
[51:58] why because God knows that we can
[51:59] overcome God knows we can overcome we
[52:04] have to fight these things we don't know
[52:07] why we have to fight particular ones but
[52:09] you know God knows we can overcome them
[52:13] what we'd like to we'd like to be able
[52:15] to pick and choose our battles
[52:16] we'd like to pick and choose our
[52:18] problems we'd like to pick and choose
[52:20] our temptations because you know what
[52:22] I'd like to pick the things that we
[52:23] don't have word we don't have a problem
[52:25] with the things that we don't have to
[52:29] you know well they don't bother me
[52:30] that don't bother me you know what the
[52:32] devil's not going to come at you with
[52:33] things that don't bother you he knows
[52:36] exactly which one of us he knows every
[52:38] aspect of our lives he knows he knows
[52:42] everything how you how you come in and
[52:44] everything that you inherited from your
[52:46] mama and your
[52:47] and all the other things that you had to
[52:49] deal with and all the things that's
[52:50] happened in your life and he knows that
[52:52] one punch he knows exactly how to get to
[52:54] you but the thing is as greater is He
[52:58] that's in me that he that's in the world
[53:00] greater is he that has come to me and
[53:03] given me the victory but do I have but
[53:09] you know the thing is is did you claim
[53:11] the victory do you claim that victory do
[53:15] you believe that you have the victory do
[53:18] we recognize that we have the victory
[53:20] because if if if Gideon was was a it was
[53:25] received the promise and he was a seed
[53:29] of Abraham and he was a son of Abraham
[53:31] and had to had the blessing how much
[53:33] more is the spiritual seed of Abraham
[53:36] have the blessings how much more do we
[53:40] have through because we actually have
[53:42] the life of God living inside of an
[53:45] episode that actually have been born
[53:46] again have actually been born of
[53:48] incorruptible seed how much more does
[53:54] that belong to us oh but you know we see
[54:00] we have things in our lives and things
[54:02] that happen to come our way and you know
[54:08] going back and speaking of this look
[54:11] tree as we were speaking of you know
[54:13] this time of year you know we look and
[54:16] see this this time of year that we're
[54:17] living in and and it's it's in the
[54:19] winter time and you know everything is
[54:21] is everything out there so dead and
[54:24] dried and you know there's no life and
[54:26] it's also gloomy and and all these
[54:28] different things that you know everybody
[54:30] has so many problems this time of year
[54:33] and you know they actually have people
[54:34] that actually have they don't I believe
[54:38] it serotonin I can't remember the name
[54:40] of the the chemical that they have but
[54:45] you know it it lifts you up you know if
[54:47] you get in sunshine you know and people
[54:49] are because in the wintertime there's
[54:51] not enough sunlight and people get in
[54:53] this gloomy condition because they're
[54:54] not living in the sunlight and so
[54:56] there's people that actually go and sit
[54:58] in front of ultraviolet
[55:00] and everything just to have this does it
[55:04] like creates a vitamin D or whatever in
[55:05] their body and so you know they they get
[55:07] so gloomy they get depressed but you
[55:09] know they go sit in this artificial
[55:11] sunlight to get better and in you know
[55:14] it's a psychological addition because
[55:16] people are depressed because of the
[55:17] darkness and everything and they live in
[55:19] this in this condition so they go get in
[55:21] this light because that's what makes
[55:23] them better you know and it's and so
[55:25] they live in this light it is so gloomy
[55:28] and it's so dark and everything and you
[55:30] know and it's the same way in our lives
[55:31] many times you know because things come
[55:33] our ways and everything looks so gloomy
[55:35] everything looks so dark everything
[55:37] looks so bad and we just like you know
[55:38] there's there's no there's no light
[55:40] anywhere it's just so dark and
[55:42] everything every time you know maybe
[55:44] that goes wrong and then there's another
[55:45] problem and it just never just can't
[55:47] ever get anything right and everything
[55:48] just like nothing goes our way and we
[55:51] just can't get a foothold on nothing it
[55:53] just goes all against us and we sit
[55:55] there and you know and we just worry
[55:56] ourselves to death and we just get all
[55:59] depressed about things that we just in
[56:01] this gloomy condition and you know and
[56:03] then you know the thing is that
[56:05] sometimes you can God's trying to speak
[56:06] to us to tell us who we are and what we
[56:10] can do and what we have in our
[56:12] possession but yet we live in the
[56:14] darkness that the devil puts upon us and
[56:17] we just listen to his lies and we walk
[56:19] in him in the in the path that he said
[56:21] for us and we just oh just listen and
[56:24] just go real devil you're right yeah
[56:26] yeah yeah and we just you know we just
[56:30] talk it we just talked the devil's
[56:31] language as brother Forney always says
[56:33] you got talking the devil's language you
[56:37] know work with a I work with a lady and
[56:38] if and and if there's anybody in this
[56:41] whole wide world
[56:42] that's a worrier she's a warrior not a
[56:45] warrior a warrior she's a warrior and
[56:50] she's got it down to a science
[56:54] she is an expert at worrying she worries
[56:58] about everything and every time she
[57:02] comes every time she comes she I see her
[57:04] the plant every now and then and and
[57:06] she'll have she's got something to tell
[57:08] me and it's just like all the time is
[57:11] something and and your energy and
[57:14] she tells mail time she says Aaron she
[57:16] said I pray and I read the Bible and I
[57:19] read the Bible and I pray and she says
[57:21] every time there's something that she
[57:23] comes to me and I said because she said
[57:25] she's so concerned about this and that
[57:27] no and I was like did you read that in
[57:29] the Bible did you find that in the Bible
[57:33] I said the Bible tells me that God
[57:37] didn't give me a spirit of fear he
[57:39] didn't give me it he didn't give me that
[57:40] but he gave me a spirit of a sound mind
[57:44] he said he gave me peace
[57:47] he gave me love he gave me joy you know
[57:51] I know I don't live it I don't live in
[57:52] worry I don't live in these things and
[57:56] you know I always asked her I said where
[57:57] did where did you find that in the
[57:58] bottle well I didn't find that in the
[57:59] Bible I've told her I've told her what
[58:03] brother Ernie said so many times all I
[58:04] have to Go's she'll say something to me
[58:07] I say you'll pay the toll twice now I
[58:08] got to say that and she knows exactly
[58:09] what I don't what the rest of the story
[58:11] is you're paying the toll twice if you
[58:14] worry about something before you get
[58:16] there you got to pay the toll twice
[58:17] brother he always says you're worrying
[58:19] about something and it won't come to
[58:21] pass but y'all well I'm worried about
[58:23] this and I'm worried about that and you
[58:25] know and I tell her I said Kathy
[58:28] not okay her name's Kathy but you know
[58:33] her sister had cancer and she was really
[58:40] bad off they didn't give her a lot of
[58:42] Hope she had to go she had to have
[58:43] surgery in Atlanta and she had to go
[58:45] through chemotherapy she had to be
[58:47] isolated she had to go through a lot of
[58:49] different things
[58:50] channel 4 - it was quite a large mess
[58:53] well I told her I said well I'm gonna
[58:55] bring you a prayer cloth so I brought
[58:57] her a prayer cloth and her her brother
[58:59] had cancer also so I brought both of
[59:02] them prayer cloths well then after that
[59:06] her son ended up having a tumor and it
[59:09] his optical nerve on his in his eye and
[59:12] he had to have surgery to remove that so
[59:15] you know I just here you go
[59:17] there's no prayer call there's no
[59:20] protocol and I was like and then and
[59:22] then she's like I'm so worried I'm so
[59:23] work and then one day she just stood the
[59:26] plant she just cried she
[59:28] right now I said like listen I
[59:30] understand that but you know what he
[59:32] said by stripes you're healed I said oh
[59:33] you can psyche you can't say nothing
[59:35] else well you know she'll get so worked
[59:38] up on stuff and I hear her she get so

[59:42] gonna do I'm gonna do oh I was like do

[59:51] the same one to touch your sister that
[59:53] the doctor said that she wouldn't live
[59:54] and she's living now and they say that
[59:57] she's a miracle you know because we
[59:59] believed and we give her a prayer cloth
[1:00:01] and that we committed her to God and all
[1:00:03] of a sudden now she's still living and
[1:00:05] she's like you know my sister she they
[1:00:07] didn't think she'd ever make it what

[1:03:11] into such a gloomy time and now all
[1:03:13] these all these problems and everything
[1:03:15] gets so dark and and everything but you
[1:03:17] know what there's there's a time that
[1:03:19] God is trying to speak to us to let us
[1:03:21] know there's a greater light there's a
[1:03:23] greater time coming and you know what if
[1:03:24] we can see that it's right in front of
[1:03:27] us that it's there you know as the Song
[1:03:30] of Solomon you know because you know we
[1:03:33] talked about it being dark you know I
[1:03:35] think about that you know he said it's
[1:03:38] the Song of Solomon 2:10 says my beloved
[1:03:41] spoke spake and said unto me rise up My
[1:03:44] Love My Fair one and come away for lo
[1:03:46] the winter is past the rain is over and
[1:03:49] gone the flowers appear on the earth the
[1:03:52] time of the singing of birds is come
[1:03:54] the voice of the turtle is heard in our
[1:03:57] land the fig tree putteth forth her
[1:03:59] green figs and the vines with the tender
[1:04:03] grape give a good smell arise my love my
[1:04:05] fair one and come away so you know you
[1:04:09] know we say all these things that are
[1:04:11] gloomy and dark and everything but you
[1:04:13] know he's warning us to come because you
[1:04:14] know what there's a the winter is over
[1:04:17] you know he's speaking come come there's
[1:04:20] greater things look look the things that
[1:04:22] are past you know because if we dwell in
[1:04:25] these things but you know he's there to
[1:04:27] speak to us you know what it doesn't
[1:04:29] have to be that way that we can come and
[1:04:36] you don't you just walk right out of
[1:04:37] that well put that behind you come into
[1:04:40] this great life the beautiful scenery
[1:04:42] that that he speaks of the flowers of
[1:04:44] blooming and all these different things
[1:04:46] while the winters pass the darkness the
[1:04:48] gloom enos the coldness all let's pass
[1:04:51] there's a beautiful time ahead if you'll
[1:04:53] just come he said come away from all
[1:04:56] that if we can just come and get away
[1:05:05] from all this gloom enos this darkness
[1:05:08] and we can if we can see what God is
[1:05:10] wanting to do this unrecognized presence
[1:05:13] of God this spiritual happening that God
[1:05:15] has for us that he can quicken us you
[1:05:19] know and one of the things that we must
[1:05:20] do is is we must stay in the word we you
[1:05:24] know because you know if you want to
[1:05:26] grow as he talks about the tree he said
[1:05:30] you know tree all they have to do is
[1:05:32] drink in and push out all they have to
[1:05:34] do is drink and push out God wants us to
[1:05:38] stay in his presence you know and when
[1:05:42] we look and we say well you know we see
[1:05:45] things and it just doesn't look right
[1:05:47] and you know it's not the way we want it
[1:05:49] to be but you know what you just get in
[1:05:50] the presence of God you know you just
[1:05:53] put everything else aside just put all
[1:05:55] of the all the things of the world aside
[1:05:57] you know you set aside time for God and
[1:05:59] God sets a time for you because you know
[1:06:01] there's a time you see you you get along
[1:06:03] with God and God will get along with you
[1:06:05] and go
[1:06:06] come and speak to you and God will do
[1:06:08] things for you I know doesn't matter how
[1:06:10] long you have to sit because you know
[1:06:13] what God knows whether we're honest or
[1:06:15] not God knows whether we're sincere God
[1:06:17] knows whether we're desperate or not but
[1:06:19] you know what you getting desperate
[1:06:20] before God he'll get desperate with you
[1:06:22] he'll come meet your need he'll come
[1:06:23] speak to you you know the scripture
[1:06:27] tells us in the book of numbers you know
[1:06:30] it talks about when when they when the
[1:06:32] children of Israel you know that they
[1:06:34] murmured and complained against Moses
[1:06:36] and Aaron and and all these different
[1:06:37] things and you know here they were
[1:06:39] comparing complaining about about them
[1:06:41] and you know not realizing they were
[1:06:42] God's instruments that was God's prophet
[1:06:45] and that was God's mouthpiece speaking
[1:06:47] to them speaking to them and you know
[1:06:49] they wanted to a murmur and complain and
[1:06:51] argue with them and you know what God
[1:06:53] told him said well you know what he said
[1:06:55] just to show you he said we're going to
[1:06:58] take each man a rod and you know he put
[1:07:01] each man's run and he wrote an Aaron's
[1:07:03] name on the tribe of Levi and he put it
[1:07:04] in the in the holy place and you know
[1:07:06] it's set in there and this dead stick
[1:07:08] this dead thing there laid in the
[1:07:11] presence of God all of a sudden it bloom
[1:07:13] and brought forth almonds and you know
[1:07:16] here was in the midst of all this you
[1:07:17] know and so he shows us that that no
[1:07:19] matter what condition that we're in even
[1:07:21] though we're alienated and cut off from
[1:07:23] God or no matter how dark and gloomy
[1:07:25] things get in your life you get in the
[1:07:27] presence of God and see if God doesn't
[1:07:29] do a miracle because brother bill talks
[1:07:31] about he is a spiritual God is a
[1:07:33] supernatural God and he said if we get
[1:07:36] in that same realm I've been in the
[1:07:38] supernatural that will see miracles take
[1:07:40] place but the thing is is you've got to
[1:07:41] get in that same realm the hazy and that
[1:07:44] he'll come on the scene and you can see
[1:07:45] the supernatural take place he said he
[1:07:48] said house hitting house the god of
[1:07:50] miracles ever gonna work miracles if you
[1:07:51] don't believe in miracles maybe you
[1:07:53] don't trust God to do a miracle that
[1:07:55] how's he ever going to do it for you but
[1:07:57] he can stand right there and speak to
[1:07:59] you and show you and no matter how dark
[1:08:02] and gloomy it gets to know how many
[1:08:03] darkness it is you know that as Gideon
[1:08:06] was tender the angel of the Lord was
[1:08:08] stood before him and spoke to him and
[1:08:10] you know it Darren was his answer that
[1:08:12] he needed they was looking for speaking
[1:08:14] right to him and we you know sometimes
[1:08:18] it's like well he didn't come through
[1:08:19] the right
[1:08:19] person who didn't didn't come the right
[1:08:21] way you know and but you know what we
[1:08:23] still need to pray and say God where
[1:08:25] where he comes however it comes you know
[1:08:27] you know I just want to see you and you
[1:08:30] let me know this is for me appreciate
[1:08:40] any button sister Esther singing that
[1:08:42] song you know there was a woman she had
[1:08:46] a need you know and she stood there you
[1:08:49] know she cuz she could have you know she
[1:08:51] could have just stood there but you know
[1:08:52] what she decided that she was gonna
[1:08:54] fight her way through the crowd she was
[1:08:56] going to press her way in you know
[1:08:58] there's no scripture that says that if
[1:09:00] you touch the hem of His garment that
[1:09:02] you be made whole but you know what her
[1:09:04] faith was that if I can but touch the
[1:09:06] hem of His garment she said I'll be a
[1:09:08] made whole you know she had faith to
[1:09:11] reach out in that and she believed what
[1:09:13] she said she would indeed and brother
[1:09:16] brother said that's what God does and
[1:09:17] everything that was created he believed
[1:09:19] in his own word he spoke it and he
[1:09:21] believed it and it came to pass and
[1:09:25] here's a woman walks out there and she
[1:09:27] just goes in man believes it and didn't
[1:09:28] even have a word it wasn't was it
[1:09:30] something that the law of Moses said if
[1:09:32] you touch the hem of the of the Messiah
[1:09:34] or whoever some holy man and you'll get
[1:09:36] healed
[1:09:36] there's no scripture for that but you
[1:09:40] know what she had faith to believe that
[1:09:42] she could touch him and you know what he
[1:09:45] didn't even he didn't even know
[1:09:47] physically that she touched him but
[1:09:50] there was something that came from him
[1:09:51] because virtue left him and he turned
[1:09:53] and said who touched me why because she
[1:09:56] knew how to reach into our supernatural
[1:09:57] realm to touching and then she received
[1:10:01] exactly what she had need of if you can
[1:10:05] do the same thing we can reach in into a
[1:10:07] surfer natural realm and touch God and
[1:10:09] we can receive exactly what we have Nita
[1:10:12] he's there to meet your need
[1:10:14] he said he's there too for you to reach
[1:10:16] out and touch him many times we get so
[1:10:21] wrapped up in the gloom and the darkness
[1:10:24] and the sadness and all these different
[1:10:26] things and don't realize that gods in
[1:10:29] our midst
[1:10:31] we missed we missed the things of God
[1:10:34] going on but Wade's been preaching on
[1:10:37] revival you know you can be in a revival
[1:10:41] and nobody else know that you're in a
[1:10:42] revival God can stir your soul nobody
[1:10:45] else know what's going on because there
[1:10:49] is like well it's so dead it's so gloomy
[1:10:53] but you know what there's things that
[1:10:55] happen and and before us and we don't
[1:10:57] even see them take place you know as
[1:11:01] speaking I was I was reading the article
[1:11:05] some time back and it really it really
[1:11:09] stirred something inside of me you know
[1:11:11] it was it was speaking of and I didn't
[1:11:15] know this learn something but you know
[1:11:18] in the wintertime we look out here in
[1:11:19] the wintertime when we say well you know
[1:11:21] all this is dead brother brems said you
[1:11:23] know tree the tree knows that God tells
[1:11:26] that tree before anything happens any
[1:11:30] cold spell anything happens you know all
[1:11:33] of a sudden those leaves start turning
[1:11:34] and that SAP starts going back into the
[1:11:37] the root of that tree and he said you
[1:11:39] know he said you can see that root you
[1:11:40] know the SAP going back down into room
[1:11:42] you know when he was speaking to that
[1:11:44] infidel you know he was talking to the
[1:11:46] infidel and he asked himself why is that
[1:11:48] he said why I said it was that SAP going
[1:11:52] out of that tree going into the ground
[1:11:53] he said we had a cold spell there's
[1:11:56] nothing happening he said he said well
[1:11:58] that's just nature he said but what
[1:12:01] calls nature to do that he said there's
[1:12:04] guy you got to know that there's some
[1:12:05] kind of intelligence that done that and
[1:12:09] he said that's what brother Graham told
[1:12:10] him he said he said if you can tell me
[1:12:12] what what intelligence told that SAP to
[1:12:15] go into the root of that tree he said
[1:12:16] I'll tell you the intelligence that told
[1:12:18] me about that woman that was in that
[1:12:20] meeting that had she had a handkerchief
[1:12:23] in her and her purse and her sister was
[1:12:25] dying so you know we say you know what
[1:12:32] why don't one of these things take place
[1:12:33] like that and you know everybody says
[1:12:35] well it's you know it's dead it's this
[1:12:37] dead time of year we we can't see
[1:12:39] anything but you know I was reading this
[1:12:43] article and
[1:12:43] and this this man he's a forester he's
[1:12:47] an arborist and you know I learned
[1:12:50] something that I didn't realize and I
[1:12:52] thought you know what it's exactly this
[1:12:53] way he said you know tree roots there's
[1:12:57] life in the tree roots but you know what
[1:12:59] they don't stop growing you know they
[1:13:03] are growing right now
[1:13:04] dead winter cold as long as the ground
[1:13:08] he said long as the ground stays between
[1:13:09] 36 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit those
[1:13:12] treatments are over they said no most
[1:13:16] tree roots are within 6 to 24 inches of
[1:13:19] the bottom of the tree so most of them
[1:13:21] or sometimes we get 4 foot some areas
[1:13:24] got 4 foot of frost got the frost
[1:13:28] barrier you know it goes down 4 feet
[1:13:31] sometimes it's 2 feet whatever area is
[1:13:32] well you know some of those roots are
[1:13:34] beyond that and you know what those
[1:13:36] things are digging sometimes he says
[1:13:39] sometimes they're just like little hairs
[1:13:41] little tiny hairs and you know what
[1:13:44] they're moving and let me tell you
[1:13:47] something else I learned that I didn't
[1:13:48] know I didn't know I thought was real
[1:13:50] fascinating do you know when you end up
[1:13:53] with roots in your sewer line is in the
[1:13:58] wintertime yeah but you didn't know that
[1:14:01] I didn't know that I learned something
[1:14:05] new every day man but you know I thought
[1:14:08] well they grow all the time you know in
[1:14:09] the wood in the summer but but he's like
[1:14:11] no he said they grow more in the winter
[1:14:13] and you sir and your sewer lines your
[1:14:15] septic tank then in the summertime they
[1:14:18] said you know why number one there's air
[1:14:23] because though there's the Silver Line
[1:14:26] don't always stay full of water there's
[1:14:27] there's moisture there's air and I
[1:14:33] didn't tell you nothing like that as
[1:14:35] fertilizer fertilizer fertilizer
[1:14:36] fertilizer he said it he said it was
[1:14:45] nutrients I'm reading I'm reading my new
[1:14:47] notes here nutrients but the other thing
[1:14:50] he said was interesting was you know
[1:14:52] they want warmth you know brother Graham
[1:14:55] tells that story about him camping out
[1:14:57] there and had
[1:14:57] fired all of a sudden seen that little
[1:14:59] flower bloom and that flower sitting
[1:15:01] there he's like where did you come from
[1:15:02] well you know what life was already in
[1:15:04] the ground he was just waiting for the
[1:15:07] right atmosphere and when that fire was
[1:15:09] there that that flower came to life and
[1:15:12] he said you know he said the water that
[1:15:15] you goes down your drain is warmer than
[1:15:16] the ground is so you know what they like
[1:15:19] warm warmth they like water they got
[1:15:22] nutrients everything is right there you
[1:15:26] know then things are just going along
[1:15:27] and all it takes is just one tiny hairs
[1:15:30] just little tiny teeny tiny thing and it
[1:15:33] finds a crack it goes all around you
[1:15:35] sewer lines he finds a little opening
[1:15:36] slides right in there and all of a
[1:15:40] sudden that little little root starts
[1:15:44] having a Jubilee and he starts going to
[1:15:47] town and then you know what not only
[1:15:51] does he have a Jubilee but all of a
[1:15:53] sudden he lets everybody else know I
[1:15:55] found it and all said you know what
[1:16:00] there's headlights crawling over too and
[1:16:01] they start going in next are crawling
[1:16:03] around all saying hey you know what if I
[1:16:04] got one in there and there's another one
[1:16:06] going in and there's another one all of
[1:16:07] a sudden all of a sudden next thing you
[1:16:09] know you've got a problem because your
[1:16:12] sewer lines missed it but you know what
[1:16:15] we think what God's not doing anything
[1:16:17] we say well we don't see anything taking
[1:16:20] place but you know what there's all
[1:16:24] kinds of things taking place and we
[1:16:26] don't we don't see them and here and you
[1:16:29] know it struck me when I was reading
[1:16:31] that that here here's all this root
[1:16:33] growth going on and just because it's
[1:16:35] got cold outside all of a sudden the
[1:16:38] life of that tree is went down into the
[1:16:40] end of the root and it's in the ground
[1:16:43] well you know what it may be cold it may
[1:16:45] be freezing
[1:16:46] it may be gloomy it may be all kinds of
[1:16:48] problem but you know what if those roots
[1:16:50] get deep enough you know what that frost
[1:16:53] don't touch them
[1:16:55] and you know what as job said he said at
[1:16:58] the scent of water that tree go bloom
[1:17:01] and he said at the scent of water that's
[1:17:04] always looking for it doesn't need a lot
[1:17:06] it all it needs is just a little bit of
[1:17:09] water and then roots are girl
[1:17:11] one down and they start growing and
[1:17:13] growing and growing trying to get to
[1:17:14] that water and you know what else
[1:17:16] happens not only them roots just growing
[1:17:19] but you know what it knows that there's
[1:17:21] another part of that tree it's in the
[1:17:24] fall that's in the frost it's it's froze
[1:17:26] up but you know what it's all one and
[1:17:29] you know what it starts doing it starts
[1:17:32] pulling that water back into the end of
[1:17:34] the end of the whole root system and it
[1:17:36] starts bringing nutrients into that
[1:17:38] whole root system and it's a it's not
[1:17:40] just from one it may be one tap root but
[1:17:43] you know what all of a sudden this whole
[1:17:44] winter it's pulling all those nutrients
[1:17:46] it's pulling all that moisture it's
[1:17:48] pulling that oxygen right up into the
[1:17:50] that route and that roots just sitting
[1:17:52] there and they said he said that roots
[1:17:54] just sitting there like just like this
[1:17:56] and it's like well you know what I can't
[1:17:58] move right now I'm pros but you know
[1:18:00] what he said there's something on the
[1:18:01] inside of me just full full of moisture
[1:18:05] full of nutrients and all of a sudden
[1:18:08] one day the Sun comes and all of a
[1:18:13] sudden the warmth of the Sun starts
[1:18:15] hitting the ground and then roots
[1:18:17] sitting there you know what they've been
[1:18:18] froze all winter long and it don't look
[1:18:20] like there's anything going on but all
[1:18:22] of us said all that stuff that's been
[1:18:24] built up all winter long you know
[1:18:26] because there's one that's been digging
[1:18:28] because there's one that's been active
[1:18:30] there's one that's been moving and it
[1:18:32] all of a sudden there's another one
[1:18:33] starts doing and you know what in that
[1:18:34] whole root system when the Sun comes up
[1:18:36] in the spring then all of a sudden you
[1:18:38] know what then that whole thing starts
[1:18:40] to just comes on life and you know what
[1:18:42] it starts digging and it starts pushing
[1:18:44] and then all of a sudden it starts
[1:18:45] pushing out it starts pushing out all of
[1:18:47] a sudden you know what all of a sudden
[1:18:49] then you've got trees that are blooming
[1:18:50] and all of a sudden you've got things
[1:18:52] that are taking place but you know what
[1:18:54] it takes it takes something to reach
[1:18:56] y'all we said well we don't we don't see
[1:18:57] these things and he said you know he
[1:18:59] said just because people say well you
[1:19:01] know I don't want to don't feel like
[1:19:03] it's time to fertilize the trees or
[1:19:06] anything like this you know he said you
[1:19:08] know you know what because it's the
[1:19:09] winter time and you know everybody wants
[1:19:11] to put it off no now it's the time to do
[1:19:13] it you know as it's starting to get cold
[1:19:15] in the fall and everybody you know
[1:19:17] sometimes people get coldness in their
[1:19:19] life and they think well you know you
[1:19:21] you got the excuse to they know that's
[1:19:23] the time that you need to get in the
[1:19:24] Word of God you need to get before God's
[1:19:26] presence because you know here maybe you
[1:19:28] may go through the dry time you may go
[1:19:30] through a cold time you may go feel like
[1:19:32] God's a million miles away but you know
[1:19:33] what you stay in the presence of God and
[1:19:35] you feed on the word and you feed on the
[1:19:37] word you say well I don't see nothing
[1:19:39] taking place you stay there until late
[1:19:41] because you know what it's milling
[1:19:42] filled up inside it's been it's metal
[1:19:46] build up its building build up and then
[1:19:48] you spend packed in there all of a
[1:19:50] sudden there's a time with because when
[1:19:52] the Holy Ghost is going to come and it's
[1:19:54] going to quicken that word it's gonna
[1:19:56] come and it's going to come to life why
[1:19:58] because there's one of them one of these
[1:20:00] days the Esso winds gonna strike what
[1:20:02] you have the scripture brother man up
[1:20:07] said you know he said you you knew
[1:20:08] because if you bring him the word the
[1:20:09] Holy Ghost feeds on the word the Holy
[1:20:11] Ghost will quicken the word that you
[1:20:12] bring to and if you become the word as
[1:20:15] you as you feed on the word but you've
[1:20:18] got to bring in the word you know
[1:20:21] because you said well it's easy to it's
[1:20:22] easy to pray when everything's going
[1:20:24] good it's the more it's more important
[1:20:27] to pray when just not going good is more
[1:20:29] important to stay in the word when
[1:20:31] things don't go well when things have
[1:20:33] when you have more problems and all
[1:20:34] these things and instead of sitting
[1:20:36] around thinking you know where is God in
[1:20:37] all of this well you know what God made
[1:20:39] me standing in front of you speaking to
[1:20:41] you and telling you I'm giving you your
[1:20:43] answer right now but you know what we
[1:20:47] may we just may miss go and honey
[1:20:48] recognize that God is in our midst and
[1:20:54] we don't we think well we don't see any
[1:20:55] we don't see any growth but you know
[1:20:57] what you don't know that just because
[1:20:59] you said well I don't see anything
[1:21:01] taking place I don't feel like I'm
[1:21:02] growing up the statue of a perfect man I
[1:21:04] don't I don't feel like I'm going to get
[1:21:05] away you stay in the word because you
[1:21:07] know one of these days God's gonna show
[1:21:09] you where you are
[1:21:10] he's going to show you because you know
[1:21:14] because you may have one little tap root
[1:21:15] that's digging through there and he's
[1:21:16] like well you know this is so hard it's
[1:21:18] such a struggle it's just a you know I
[1:21:20] just can't don't seem like I'm gonna
[1:21:22] make it well you just keep going because
[1:21:23] you know what now that's the one that's
[1:21:25] going to bring you through and all of a
[1:21:30] sudden you get full and then all of a
[1:21:32] sudden you know then that light
[1:21:34] illuminates
[1:21:35] the word that you've gotten off some man
[1:21:36] you said men it's just you know you're
[1:21:38] just over over there over the heels well
[1:21:43] you know what God wanted want to show
[1:21:46] you you stay in the word you feed on the
[1:21:50] word no matter what it comes or goes
[1:21:53] just stay with the word and it'll bring
[1:21:56] it it'll bring to pass whatever you have
[1:21:59] need of scripture tells us says blessed
[1:22:07] is the man that walketh not in the
[1:22:08] counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in
[1:22:11] the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[1:22:12] seat of the scornful but his delight is
[1:22:15] in the law of the Lord and in his law
[1:22:17] doth he meditate day and night he shall
[1:22:20] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:22:22] water and bringeth forth his fruit in
[1:22:24] his season his leaf also shall not
[1:22:27] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:22:30] prosper so you know it's in it and it's
[1:22:35] in that season so whatever whatever
[1:22:39] seasoning that you're in if you stay
[1:22:41] there and you and you stay faithful to
[1:22:44] that in that season God will bring it to
[1:22:46] pass
[1:22:46] whatever that season is God's going to
[1:22:49] quick in it to you you faith if you're
[1:22:51] faithful to the word that he's faithful
[1:22:53] to you he's gonna be faithful to you to
[1:22:55] bring exactly what you have need of we
[1:23:00] worry about things and we don't see
[1:23:01] things taking place did you know what
[1:23:04] God's moving I got one one other cool
[1:23:12] demo I want to share with you and Brad
[1:23:15] Brad was speaking of this is what hereis
[1:23:21] tell Elijah new brother Brad was
[1:23:23] speaking of he said that he said that's
[1:23:29] what churches try to do they try to
[1:23:30] pattern mark join something run after
[1:23:33] this or that or the other he said wait
[1:23:34] on the Lord he will provide for you he
[1:23:36] said what do you hear can you hear the
[1:23:38] voice he and he speaking of the Bears in
[1:23:41] the wintertime
[1:23:42] he says the Bears hear the voice of God
[1:23:45] that bear and he goes on he talks about
[1:23:48] the mother bear said that mother bear is
[1:23:51] bred in October she goes and lays down
[1:23:55] she doesn't wake up anymore to the
[1:23:57] middle of May said them little Cubs are
[1:23:59] born in February so what if the little
[1:24:01] mother would say no wait a minute my
[1:24:04] little Cubs is going to be born there'll
[1:24:06] be three months before I ever see them
[1:24:08] the little fellers are born just like a
[1:24:11] little rat a little bitty things naked
[1:24:12] just like a little young rat well how
[1:24:14] would these little fellas ever find a
[1:24:16] place and well how will they ever be
[1:24:19] taken care of said she don't worry about
[1:24:21] that she knows that something speaks to
[1:24:23] her that God will take care of that when
[1:24:25] them little rats fellows are born in
[1:24:27] February and all that cold weather down
[1:24:30] under the snowdrift something makes the
[1:24:32] little fella stand on his feet walks
[1:24:34] around his mother right to the utter and
[1:24:36] goes and goes to nursing ladies right
[1:24:39] there and nurses three months and when
[1:24:41] mammy wakes up she says good morning
[1:24:42] children
[1:24:43] takes the stroll and goes out said she
[1:24:45] ain't flustered by about going down
[1:24:48] south she ain't flustered she's got to
[1:24:50] have a doctor there to take care of all
[1:24:51] these children and things when they're
[1:24:53] born she just sleeps it off amen said if
[1:24:55] the church could only find bare sense to
[1:24:59] wait on God if we could find and realize
[1:25:09] that all that you have need of God is
[1:25:11] given to you he supplied your every need
[1:25:14] before you ever have the need of that
[1:25:16] and you know what if you just wait just
[1:25:18] like that that mama bear just lays there
[1:25:21] and we think well nothing's going on
[1:25:22] well you know what there's some new
[1:25:24] births taking place there's some people
[1:25:26] that are actually being born again
[1:25:27] there's actually some that are growing
[1:25:29] up and you know we don't we don't see
[1:25:32] that because you know what we know well
[1:25:33] nothing's going on we're you know it's
[1:25:34] just the same church service it's just
[1:25:36] the same people you know we're just
[1:25:38] going here brother Dale for the weight
[1:25:39] or whoever but you know what there's a
[1:25:41] time and all of a sudden you know if we
[1:25:45] start looking they said look to the
[1:25:48] unseen if we can look into that other
[1:25:51] realm and see what's taking place you
[1:25:53] know many times we fail my brother Bram
[1:25:55] said we fail to realize the angels of
[1:25:57] God are encamped about us we are we're
[1:25:59] we fail to realize that the angels of
[1:26:02] God are here they're here when you when
[1:26:05] you when you come to the house of God
[1:26:07] they're here they meet with us they
[1:26:10] follow us they're leading us and they're
[1:26:14] here to meet your needs
[1:26:18] well god bless you gnight let's stand
[1:26:20] while have musicians come I'm so glad
[1:26:23] that I am a child of God that I can
[1:26:26] recognize Who I am and Lord let me be
[1:26:30] mindful in the Lord
[1:26:31] wake me up sometimes when I don't
[1:26:33] realize that you're there trying to
[1:26:34] speak to me I think about brother Dale
[1:26:38] where he says you know when you wake up
[1:26:39] sometimes you wake up in the middle or
[1:26:41] not sometimes it's early in the morning
[1:26:42] when you wake up and you know sometimes
[1:26:44] like Lord you want talk to me you know
[1:26:49] sometimes things come to your mind in
[1:26:50] the early in the morning and you know
[1:26:55] I've had I've had people come on my
[1:26:57] heart wake up early in the morning to
[1:27:00] pray for somebody it's like well I don't
[1:27:03] know why this is but you know I and I
[1:27:08] had a years ago I told you I had a
[1:27:10] sister she come home I heard and kind of
[1:27:14] grew up together know I knew her for
[1:27:16] many years and you know there was
[1:27:20] something that I just couldn't get away
[1:27:22] from it up you know and so I just prayed
[1:27:25] as a lord you know I don't know what's
[1:27:27] going on this has probably been
[1:27:29] 20-something years ago but as well comes
[1:27:32] like Lord I don't know why this is but
[1:27:33] I'm just I'm just I don't know what the
[1:27:35] situation is but at that time when I
[1:27:40] talked to her later on she told me she
[1:27:42] said Aaron you don't realize that she
[1:27:46] said I've been dating a boy that was
[1:27:49] Pentecostal and having been raised in
[1:27:52] this message she said I was dating a
[1:27:53] Pentecostal boy and he had asked me to
[1:27:56] marry him and she said I was really
[1:27:58] going through a struggle at that time
[1:28:01] because she said she said because her
[1:28:04] dad was an unbeliever her mom was a
[1:28:06] believer her dad put so much pressure I
[1:28:08] was like he's got a good job he's got a
[1:28:10] good family look I mean everything
[1:28:12] everything that you
[1:28:13] is right there he's a good Christian boy
[1:28:16] he's got a college degree got money
[1:28:19] everything Hey I mean I worked with I
[1:28:21] worked with Glenn he was an awesome guy
[1:28:23] but you know what she's like I can't do
[1:28:25] this and her dad just and you know and I
[1:28:29] I prayed you know I didn't understand
[1:28:33] any of that at the time but later on she
[1:28:34] told me she said you know she said I
[1:28:36] appreciate you praying out she said I
[1:28:37] thank God that somebody was interceding
[1:28:41] for me because she said I was battling
[1:28:42] and she said you know only me and mama
[1:28:44] knew really what was going on you know
[1:28:48] you wake up in the middle of the night
[1:28:49] and you know when you hear somebody
[1:28:50] speak like that right and years later I
[1:28:52] let brother
[1:28:53] I let brother Dale she wrote me she
[1:28:56] wrote me a letter number of years ago I
[1:29:00] thought brother Dale read it and
[1:29:02] everybody that had something to do with
[1:29:04] her Christian experience she wrote a
[1:29:06] letter to all of us and she wrote an
[1:29:10] every portion of that every person that
[1:29:11] had something to do with her Christian
[1:29:13] walk that had something and and she
[1:29:16] actually included me in that and to this
[1:29:18] day is one of the greatest honors that
[1:29:24] I've had in my life that you know you
