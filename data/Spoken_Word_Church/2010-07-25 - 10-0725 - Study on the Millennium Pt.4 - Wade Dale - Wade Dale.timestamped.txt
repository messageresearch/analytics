[0:02] okay

[0:09] somebody's hand and say god bless you
[0:10] this morning
[0:19] now for those of you that listen
[0:22] for those of you that are going to camp
[0:26] we need to meet today um
[0:30] we can't meet in between services
[0:31] because i got a sermon to do this
[0:32] afternoon so
[0:34] it won't be long short won't be long be
[0:36] short
[0:37] we'll never run after the second part
[0:40] i've been told my sermon will be short
[0:42] today
[0:46] short meeting i'm sorry but i just we
[0:49] just need to know
[0:50] exactly who's coming and exactly when
[0:53] and if you're not
[0:54] if you're if you're even if you even
[0:56] have a question just say no
[0:58] okay because i don't want to depend on
[1:00] somebody and i know things come up but
[1:03] hey i got a i got a uh a plant manager
[1:06] that's going to be out friday saturday
[1:08] and sunday and they want me to stay at
[1:10] work
[1:13] you better pray because he's having a
[1:15] lung surgery he can't
[1:16] do anything he just came up instantly
[1:19] he's i think he's got um
[1:22] so anyway so that's serious all right
[1:25] but i told him i said look i said that's
[1:27] my ministry for the year
[1:29] for the young kids and i said to me it's
[1:30] just like church
[1:32] and i'm not going to miss it so we'll
[1:35] see how that works out
[1:37] plus uh a company came by just for
[1:41] a testimony for a minute the customer
[1:42] came by friday and we thought he was
[1:45] going to fire us
[1:47] we were doing seven 280 000 pounds of
[1:50] product with them a week
[1:52] they want us to do what's 15 times 40
[1:58] 600 they want us to do 600 000 more
[2:01] pounds
[2:03] instead of firing us so guess what
[2:06] wednesday we're opening the other plant
[2:08] back
[2:08] up again and i'm leaving thursday friday
[2:10] saturday and sunday so
[2:13] you flat for the opening of the plant
[2:14] but me being gone is important i don't
[2:17] know
[2:18] it is awesome that obviously they'll
[2:20] probably be jobs right
[2:23] we need to hire 150 people tomorrow
[2:27] tomorrow tomorrow we need 150 people
[2:32] can you cut chicken
[2:37] no actually we are hiring back the
[2:39] office help we have before so we don't
[2:41] have to need any office out we need
[2:43] general labor so anyway but to god be
[2:46] the glory because thursday
[2:47] we had a meeting thursday and the owners
[2:49] were like hey this we're going to do
[2:51] this
[2:51] if they fire us we're going to do this
[2:53] and we we're going to lose those seven
[2:54] loads but we're going to do this bunch
[2:56] business
[2:57] that's not totally into the story but
[2:59] they said because we've lost this we can
[3:01] do this
[3:02] so starting monday instead of doing
[3:06] 80 000 pounds of size a day
[3:09] we're gonna be doing four hundred
[3:12] thousand pounds a day
[3:14] so i said we need 150 people because
[3:16] they weren't expecting cooked foods
[3:18] they were expecting them to fire us so
[3:20] we'd have this to take over well now we
[3:22] got both of them
[3:24] make a long story short 15.
[3:28] 30. 1.2 million pounds of product is
[3:31] going to be going through the
[3:33] plant starting monday if we can get
[3:35] enough people
[3:37] where it was only 400 000 pounds
[3:41] but anyway but the the glory behind this
[3:44] is is i told the lord i said i've had
[3:46] enough of this up and down business
[3:48] we go in the meeting and we're going to
[3:49] lose everything we're going to meet and
[3:51] we're going to gain everything we're
[3:52] going to meet we're going to lose
[3:53] everything we're going to meet we're
[3:54] going to gain everything
[3:56] and i said lord i don't want that to
[3:58] happen about three o'clock friday
[3:59] morning
[4:00] i just woke right up lord just said
[4:03] it'll all work out they were so
[4:06] fearful friday morning that that company
[4:08] was going to tell us
[4:10] you know get out of here as soon as that
[4:12] man walked through the door because
[4:14] i know it as soon as that man walked
[4:15] through the door i could look in his
[4:16] face and i could have walked in and told
[4:18] him
[4:19] they're not gonna fire us they gonna
[4:20] give us three times more what we're
[4:22] doing
[4:23] so don't do it if you're just asking
[4:26] right
[4:27] all right let's get finished with this
[4:28] we're going to finish this up and then
[4:30] next sunday we probably won't have
[4:33] sunday school because
[4:34] most of us will be gone okay um
[4:39] we just won't have it for the sake of
[4:41] just nobody being here much
[4:45] and then the next sunday lord willing
[4:48] june and i will be in
[4:49] saint augustine florida um
[4:52] preaching brother keith brown so we'll
[4:55] be on that sunday but i had already
[4:56] asked brother joe
[4:58] last week if he would take that weekend
[5:00] and i'm not knowing that
[5:02] brother keith brown was gonna call you
[5:04] know he called it wednesday right
[5:07] so i asked you lord knows how to work
[5:10] everything out
[5:12] he knew it before i did he knows all
[5:15] things so we know the lord's on
[5:16] he's on the scene so let's turn to
[5:18] revelations 21
[5:20] and let's try to finish this up today
[5:24] with a parallel between the millennium
[5:26] and the future home
[5:29] just for a recap we know that the
[5:33] millennium
[5:33] i'm gonna back up so you can all see
[5:35] that the millennium we know is time
[5:38] all right i kind of made kind of
[5:39] self-explanatory here millennium is time
[5:42] we're still in the seventh day rest
[5:45] we don't enter the eighth day
[5:52] until we get into the future home but
[5:54] now listen
[5:55] you and i that are born again this
[5:56] morning we're already in that eighth day
[5:59] all right we're already in eternity
[6:02] already have crossed over from time to
[6:06] eternity that's why the bible can say
[6:08] we're sitting in heavenly places
[6:09] in christ jesus already
[6:13] eternal but there's a process like
[6:16] everything there's a process
[6:19] to this and the process is
[6:22] that we we had sin over here in the
[6:24] garden
[6:25] man fell man came through the old
[6:28] testament
[6:29] came to the new testament god testifying
[6:33] and we'll kind of look into that this
[6:35] afternoon in the appearing and the
[6:36] coming of the lord
[6:38] like brother dale's been preaching but i
[6:39] want to kind of take it in a little
[6:41] different angle
[6:42] um but what happens here is then
[6:46] everything
[6:48] after the it kind of hooks in with the
[6:49] daniel 70 weeks that we've been doing
[6:51] at the end of that last week
[6:56] to the jews to the world
[6:59] then you start blending into the
[7:00] millennium but it's still
[7:02] time time is still going on we're still
[7:04] going to have days and times and seasons
[7:07] all right now remember here
[7:10] is going to be atomic fire
[7:16] right that's going to destroy the world
[7:18] bottle of armageddon
[7:19] we're going to come back into the
[7:21] millennium after a three and a half year
[7:24] wedding supper the millennium will be
[7:28] the bride's honeymoon
[7:30] all right right but it's going to be our
[7:34] eternal home because we're in our
[7:36] eternal home right here
[7:37] in in this this man will be body spirit
[7:40] soul eternal
[7:41] but the world has to come behind and
[7:43] follow through
[7:44] right right right so in the millennium
[7:49] he's not going to be
[7:52] to us a son of david because the bible
[7:57] says that he'll sit on the throne
[7:58] of david ruling the 12 tribes of israel
[8:02] now we'll be sitting on the throne with
[8:03] him but in the millennium
[8:05] is our honeymoon but to the jews
[8:10] it'll be the time of the building of
[8:12] this temporary city
[8:15] and i believe the reason that in ezekiel
[8:17] 40-44 you can read that that's a
[8:19] temporary city
[8:20] because that city will be destroyed
[8:23] after battle of gog and magog
[8:25] all right because everything will be
[8:27] destroyed battle of gog and magog
[8:28] they'll be everything will be gone
[8:30] right um in the millennium he'll be the
[8:33] son of david
[8:35] to us he's already all in all
[8:39] but when we get into the future home
[8:41] that's when he's all in all to everybody
[8:44] all right so that's the difference
[8:45] between these two it's our honeymoon
[8:48] it's our eternal home in the future home
[8:50] this is just a honeymoon
[8:52] now basically
[8:56] in a type your honeymoon where you go on
[9:00] your honeymoon is not your permanent
[9:02] home
[9:03] right usually you go off somewhere now
[9:06] some of you go home somewhere but what
[9:07] i'm saying is normally
[9:09] okay if you go on a honeymoon you don't
[9:12] want to just go back to your house
[9:14] you want to go somewhere special and
[9:17] enjoy
[9:17] all the pleasures that are there all
[9:20] right
[9:21] then go to your normal home right
[9:25] or eternal home all right so that's for
[9:27] the bride that's the bride's honeymoon
[9:30] we'll be here for a thousand years
[9:33] just to walk through the earth
[9:37] to go into this temple and be able to
[9:40] explain
[9:41] to each person of the 144 thousand maybe
[9:46] they'll they know about this temple but
[9:48] they don't know all the significance
[9:49] about this temple
[9:50] what it meant to go into justification
[9:52] outer court inner court and holy holies
[9:54] all right
[9:55] so you and i will be able to expound to
[9:57] them
[9:59] and then from that it's going to convert
[10:02] after sin is done away with because
[10:03] remember sin is still here in the
[10:04] millennium it's not in the millennium
[10:06] but it's still alive all those demons
[10:10] that
[10:10] that depressed you they're still
[10:12] somewhere but they're not on this earth
[10:14] brother branham said they're bound with
[10:16] a chain the bible says angel goes and
[10:18] gets the chain binds the devil
[10:20] puts him in a pit why is he why is he
[10:23] bound he's bound because you and i
[10:26] are eternal we have an eternal mind
[10:30] the only people he can get to is maybe
[10:32] the heathen that may be raised up in the
[10:34] millennium i don't you know that's
[10:35] something we don't even need to be
[10:36] discussing we just need to make sure we
[10:38] know how to get there all right
[10:40] now the bible says we'll build houses
[10:42] and gardens and etc
[10:44] and in the future home there's no
[10:46] building because
[10:48] we're going to read right here in just a
[10:49] second that
[10:51] home was built when jesus in john 14
[10:55] says i go to prepare play i go
[10:57] to prepare a place for you
[11:00] that's not the millennium millennium is
[11:03] a natural happening still in time
[11:06] still god can still walk among us though
[11:08] still jesus christ can walk among us but
[11:10] this
[11:10] earth and some of the things that are
[11:13] around
[11:14] are still going to have spirits
[11:19] but they're going to be bound but at the
[11:21] battle of gog and magog those spirits
[11:23] are going to
[11:24] be killed sin is going to be done away
[11:25] with everything's going to be brought
[11:27] back to its rightful
[11:30] position temporary world
[11:34] that's exactly what it is it says heaven
[11:36] and earth will pass away
[11:38] in other words the old the old form of
[11:39] the earth will pass away
[11:42] we'll have a temporary world but if the
[11:44] devil's still around somewhere
[11:46] it's not perfect right or eternal until
[11:49] all this is done away with and then it
[11:51] converts into
[11:52] an eternal world here what we're talking
[11:56] about
[11:57] all right after the battle of gog and
[11:59] magog which burns
[12:02] see it's the type of brother brown or uh
[12:05] john said to baptize you with holy ghost
[12:07] and fire baptize you with the holy ghost
[12:10] when he gives you the holy ghost and
[12:11] fire which will burn this guy up
[12:13] that you're looking at and he'll become
[12:16] eternal same thing with the world
[12:17] world's gotta go through the same
[12:18] process you and i went through
[12:20] justification under moses sanctification
[12:22] under jesus baptism of the holy ghost
[12:25] under the fire of god only in the fire
[12:27] of man
[12:29] the holy ghost is your earnest it's not
[12:32] the full redemption it's the earnest
[12:35] but right here is where we get
[12:40] our fullness but the world
[12:43] doesn't get its fullness do you
[12:45] understand
[12:46] this world gets its fullness because
[12:48] we're baptized with the holy ghost and
[12:49] fire we get a body change here
[12:51] then the world has to be changed
[12:55] temporary world turns into an eternal
[12:57] world same world
[12:59] it's just made eternal same body right
[13:02] right
[13:03] it's just made eternal temporary city
[13:07] ezekiel 40 through 44 is a temporary
[13:09] temple
[13:10] all right but this one we're going to
[13:12] talk about now revelation
[13:14] 21 and 22 is an eternal city it'll never
[13:17] change there'll be no
[13:18] difference in it from from eternity to
[13:21] eternity
[13:21] all right this city is going to change
[13:25] this city is going to be destroyed
[13:30] right here is the city that abraham
[13:33] looked for
[13:34] right
[13:37] the bible says we have no continuing
[13:39] city
[13:42] i mean they're continuing down here but
[13:43] we have one that's not
[13:45] right this city right here
[13:50] in in its earnest form is in me and you
[13:53] now
[13:53] that's why it says the earnest of your
[13:55] resurrection the earnest
[13:57] brother brownson when you get the holy
[13:58] ghost you just get started it's a little
[14:00] dip
[14:01] then you have to grow all right same
[14:03] thing with the world it gets a temporary
[14:05] burning right here then it has to go
[14:09] through
[14:10] the millennium then it goes through the
[14:13] fire of god
[14:15] then the eternal city comes in
[14:18] revelation 21-22 now let's read it and
[14:20] then we'll
[14:22] okay listen before we read is there any
[14:23] questions
[14:25] the white throne that's the fire of god
[14:27] the white throne is the fire god
[14:29] which is the judgment seat
[14:34] and that's where you and i'll sit
[14:37] and we don't judge the 12 tribes of
[14:39] israel the bible says the saints
[14:41] will judge the earth right angels
[14:44] will even have to be judged by humans
[14:48] that are born again born again human
[14:49] beings all right
[14:52] but the white throne judgment after the
[14:53] white throne judgment you're going to
[14:54] see
[14:55] that god's going to come down and burn
[14:58] every bit of this off
[15:00] and then brother the bible i keep saying
[15:02] brother
[15:03] but he quotes the bible says we read it
[15:05] right here
[15:07] let's go back to chapter 20.
[15:13] verse 7
[15:20] and when the thousand years are expired
[15:21] satan shall be loosed out of his prison
[15:24] and shall go out to deceive the nations
[15:26] which are in the four quarters of the
[15:27] earth
[15:28] god and magog to gather them together to
[15:30] battle the number of whom is the sand to
[15:32] the earth
[15:34] what satan do in some way he's unlocked
[15:36] that fifth dimension or
[15:38] or whatever and he's going to bring
[15:40] everybody up
[15:42] all the demons in the world
[15:45] it's ever been because brother brown
[15:46] said demons don't die spirits don't die
[15:49] they just move from one place to the
[15:50] other he said the same demon
[15:52] that was uh that was in legion
[15:55] when it went into them pigs when they
[15:57] died when the pigs died
[15:59] the devils left them and just went in
[16:01] some more people all right
[16:03] so now dog and make all together
[16:06] together
[16:07] the number of whom to sin and see and
[16:09] they went up on the breadth of the earth
[16:10] and come past the camp of the saints
[16:11] about
[16:12] and the beloved city now that's got to
[16:15] be the millennium
[16:16] city all right that's not the city
[16:18] that's not
[16:19] it's not the city coming down
[16:27] us
[16:30] what's the problem
[16:34] yeah absolutely
[16:37] that's the biology manga
[16:41] are we really going to be tested well no
[16:43] but look listen
[16:45] and they went up on the breadth of the
[16:47] earth and compassed the camp of the
[16:49] saints about and the beloved city
[16:50] that's us we're down here living in this
[16:53] millennium
[16:54] right
[16:58] and fire came down from god out of
[17:00] heaven and devoured them
[17:04] burnt them up didn't burn us we already
[17:06] had our burning
[17:08] it's going to burn them up now the
[17:11] question was and i agree
[17:13] that i don't know whether that's going
[17:16] to happen before the white throne or
[17:18] after it looks like to me it could be
[17:20] either one but it looks like to me more
[17:22] that somewhere because remember
[17:23] scripture is not exactly
[17:25] verse one two three four five and that's
[17:26] the way it happens there's a lot of
[17:28] things
[17:28] inserted taken out so you could insert
[17:32] maybe right in here
[17:34] in the beloved city stop right there
[17:39] and then that's when the white throne
[17:40] judgment comes in
[17:43] because god's got to judge those demons
[17:45] before he can do what he's doing
[17:48] if i understand he's got a he said just
[17:50] god everybody's going to have a judgment
[17:52] all right and
[17:56] remember brother brown said god made the
[17:58] heavens and the earth period
[18:00] then he started with the very next
[18:01] sentence he said it could have been a
[18:02] million or a billion years in between
[18:04] those two
[18:04] those two verses right here we could see
[18:08] that
[18:09] and compassed the camp of the saints
[18:10] about in the beloved city well hey
[18:12] if you've got all the saints
[18:16] if you got all the dead if you got all
[18:19] the demons
[18:20] what a time to have a white throne
[18:21] judgment right because that's where it's
[18:23] going to happen
[18:24] everybody's going to be gathered
[18:25] together right because right here it's
[18:27] going to tell you about the great white
[18:28] throne in verse 11.
[18:30] and the devil that deceived them was
[18:31] cast into the lake of fire brimstone
[18:33] where the beast and the false prophet
[18:34] are
[18:35] in other words there's some people going
[18:36] in first
[18:39] that beast in the false prophet must be
[18:40] going in first it shall be tormented day
[18:43] and night forever
[18:44] and i saw a great white throne and him
[18:46] sat upon it whose face the earth and
[18:48] heaven fled away and there was found no
[18:50] place for them
[18:51] what a place right there for to be the
[18:52] battle of gog and magog right in there
[18:54] somewhere
[18:55] all right and i saw the dead small and
[18:57] great stand before god and the books
[18:58] were opened another book was open which
[19:00] was the book of life
[19:01] and the dead were judged out of those
[19:03] things which are written in the books
[19:04] according to their works
[19:06] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[19:07] in the death death and hell delivered up
[19:09] the dead which were in them
[19:11] and they were judged every man according
[19:12] to their works and death and hell were
[19:14] cast in the lake of fire
[19:15] this is the second death and whosoever
[19:17] was not found written and the book of
[19:18] life was cast into the lake of fire now
[19:21] let's have a battle of gog and my god
[19:24] because the battle of gog and magog
[19:26] kills spirits it's a spiritual
[19:29] right then the earth is going to get its
[19:35] total cleansing
[19:38] because chapter 21
[19:41] is a continuation john's standing after
[19:44] that saul
[19:45] what a new city come down now until we
[19:47] had a prophet
[19:48] we didn't know what all this happened
[19:49] but brother brown said that
[19:52] a mountain's going to push up right over
[19:54] there where the other one did
[19:56] in jerusalem the mountain's going to
[19:57] push up brother brown said he said look
[20:00] he said
[20:00] same place abraham fed cafta
[20:04] melchizedek is the same place that that
[20:06] mountain's going to push up
[20:08] right there in palestine right up there
[20:10] so actually
[20:11] he was looking for a city and it was
[20:13] right under his feet
[20:15] in a natural sense the mountain but see
[20:17] that mountain's not the city
[20:19] that mountains where the city's going to
[20:20] sit on
[20:22] i mean i can see that's so plain that
[20:25] that mountain is going to
[20:26] it's going to come up you know and it's
[20:28] not going to be just a straight shot it
[20:30] could be you know
[20:31] it could be just like this
[20:35] it's going to be 1500 miles so they may
[20:37] be 500 miles between a dip
[20:39] and a right and a rise a dip in their
[20:41] eyes there's one thing for sure
[20:43] this is where the lamb is going to sit
[20:46] and the throne will be and then what's
[20:48] going to happen i believe
[20:49] is is guess what
[20:58] that part is going to come from here set
[21:01] down on this
[21:02] and and i put it for illustration two
[21:04] lines
[21:06] but in actuality
[21:09] it's one line right it's just going to
[21:12] sit down right on every curve and nook
[21:14] and cranny those houses are going to
[21:16] just sit right down
[21:18] and you it's going to be you and i
[21:20] standing on that mountain
[21:22] and then what we're going to do is we're
[21:24] going to
[21:26] okay brother branham gives the
[21:27] illustration that we'll go up
[21:29] and see that he's the on that will
[21:31] worship him all right that's what it
[21:32] says on the bottom
[21:34] and then now you're going to have your
[21:36] wall
[21:38] which is going to be 212 feet high
[21:41] which that's not too high 1500 miles is
[21:44] gonna be way above that
[21:46] then you're gonna have your your your
[21:48] gates three gates on each side
[21:49] three fours is twelve they're all going
[21:51] to have the name of the apostles and all
[21:53] that
[21:53] foundations are gonna be abraham isaac
[21:57] jacob and joseph
[21:58] the four corners all right let's read
[22:02] i saw a new heaven in the new earth for
[22:03] the first heaven and the first earth
[22:05] were passed away
[22:06] there were no more sea and i john so and
[22:09] that didn't say
[22:11] that didn't say ocean i said see
[22:14] okay well don't worry there's going to
[22:16] be water there's going to be an ocean
[22:19] now john saw the holy city new jerusalem
[22:22] coming down from god
[22:23] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[22:25] adorned for a husband
[22:27] and what do you do when you're a bride
[22:29] you start with your body and then what
[22:31] do you do you put on the garment put on
[22:32] this stuff and all that stuff
[22:34] put on them real tight things to make
[22:36] you look skinny on that day
[22:41] but you don't put on your worst you put
[22:44] on your best
[22:46] and that's what this city is going to be
[22:48] it's what you and i have been putting on
[22:50] down here
[22:51] because this city is built on the word
[22:53] of god which the word of god is in you
[22:58] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[23:01] saying behold the tabernacle of god
[23:04] is with men now that
[23:08] god is the same form and same
[23:12] i got a circle in my bible i looked it
[23:13] up it's the same as genesis 1 1.
[23:16] right
[23:20] same because you look
[23:25] because it's god with the people treaty
[23:27] it's not god it's not big
[23:29] o.g anymore god's with his people in the
[23:32] beginning god because remember
[23:33] we were there with him in in theophany
[23:37] right in the beginning god that same god
[23:40] is the same
[23:41] in the greek as this god
[23:44] so i wrote my bible back to the
[23:46] beginning and that's exactly what it is
[23:48] it's total restoration
[23:50] from where in the beginning god started
[23:52] this thing
[23:53] and that same god that started it is
[23:56] going to finish it
[23:58] and you and i are part of it
[24:02] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[24:05] and he will dwell with them and they
[24:06] shall be his people
[24:09] and god himself shall be with them and
[24:11] be their god
[24:12] god shall wipe away all tears from their
[24:14] eyes and there shall be no more death no
[24:16] sorrow no crying
[24:17] there shouldn't be any more pain but
[24:18] former things have passed away
[24:20] he that sat upon the throne said behold
[24:22] i make all things new
[24:24] now you see that remember daddy preached
[24:26] on that not too long ago
[24:27] why is that not in red every other thing
[24:30] that jesus
[24:30] who is almighty god has said has been in
[24:33] red letter
[24:35] because he's back to the all in all he's
[24:37] back to the beginning why didn't you
[24:39] why didn't you go back to the beginning
[24:40] because everything that god spoke into
[24:42] existence is not in red letter
[24:44] but that creator god was jesus christ
[24:45] right
[24:47] but he's come back to his original form
[24:51] you and i are with him now outside of
[24:53] him
[24:54] so he's come back and he's who's he
[24:55] talking to you and i
[24:58] you don't have to be in red letter all
[25:00] right
[25:02] behold i make all things new and he said
[25:04] unto me right for these things are true
[25:05] and faithful
[25:06] and he said unto me it is done i am
[25:08] alpha and omega
[25:10] now who is alpha omega people always
[25:12] talk who is for the media the bride
[25:15] he's out the alpha bride no mega bride
[25:17] it's the same
[25:18] right he's sending me and he's done now
[25:21] i'm alpha omega
[25:23] the beginning and the end i was given to
[25:25] him the thirst to found the water of
[25:27] freely he that overcometh shall inherit
[25:28] all things i shall be his god and he
[25:31] shall be my son
[25:32] which are fearful and unbelieving and
[25:33] abominable murderers whoremongers
[25:35] sorcerers and idolaters and all liars
[25:36] shall have their part in the label which
[25:38] burns with fire and brimstone
[25:40] which is the second death showing that
[25:42] john's saying hey these people are not
[25:44] going to be here they were
[25:45] but these people are not going to be
[25:47] here all right
[25:48] and there came unto me one of the seven
[25:50] angels which had the seven vows full of
[25:51] the seven last plagues and talked with
[25:53] me saying
[25:54] come hither i will show thee the bride
[25:56] the lamb's wife and he carried me away
[25:57] in the spirit through great high
[25:58] mountain
[25:59] and showed me that great city now he
[26:02] don't sound here and show him a bunch of
[26:04] people
[26:05] but by revelation we see
[26:08] that the people are the city
[26:12] because he said he said come hither i
[26:13] will show thee the bride the lamb's wife
[26:15] and say come heather and i'll show you
[26:16] the city
[26:18] huh because if you were to read this
[26:22] i'd read come heather i will show thee
[26:23] the bride of the lamb's wife and he
[26:24] carried me away in the spirit
[26:26] to a great high mountain and there stood
[26:28] a great bunch of people
[26:34] they didn't say that
[26:37] he showed me a great city the holy
[26:39] jerusalem descending out of heaven from
[26:41] god which goes back to chapter 21 verse
[26:43] one and two
[26:45] having the glory of god
[26:48] and her light
[27:03] when you say the city of lula turned out
[27:05] for a parade
[27:07] the buildings didn't all walk up to the
[27:08] edge of the road
[27:11] and the houses all of them didn't pack
[27:12] up next to the road and wave their
[27:14] little flags no
[27:16] the people of the city of lula but when
[27:18] they say it they say the city of lula
[27:20] came out
[27:20] all right all right and he had it and
[27:23] had a wall great and high
[27:26] let's start right there stop right there
[27:27] her light was locked into a stone most
[27:29] precious even like a gas
[27:30] stone clear as crystal all right
[27:34] so i gotta answer uh sister got a
[27:36] question but we may take one more
[27:38] because i want to finish that chapter
[27:41] and go to the next one so
[27:43] you know keep that in your mind for a
[27:45] few weeks put it on hold pause
[27:48] and we'll try to get into it all right
[27:50] kathy will you
[27:51] uh when you were talking about building
[27:54] houses
[27:57] okay you said there won't be no man-made
[27:59] stuff won't you just speak the word
[28:02] well i didn't say there wouldn't be no
[28:03] man-made stuff i just said there
[28:05] wouldn't be no
[28:06] listen you ever thought about this
[28:09] everybody gets so carnal when they're
[28:11] supposed to be spiritual and they get so
[28:12] spiritual when they're supposed to be
[28:13] carnal
[28:15] think about this
[28:19] you think well my gosh i'm going to have
[28:20] calluses i'm going to be sore
[28:22] i'm going to no we're thinking we're
[28:24] thinking in human terms
[28:26] but let me prove one thing to you well i
[28:29] get this cramp out of my foot
[28:33] back in the bible there was a man named
[28:36] solomon
[28:38] solomon remember david said god i don't
[28:41] want you to dwell
[28:43] in a little tent i want you to dwell in
[28:46] a house
[28:47] and god said that's wonderful build me a
[28:49] temple then david did what he did with
[28:51] bathsheba
[28:52] and god said i've taken that away from
[28:54] you but your son will build me one
[28:56] now what did the bible say happened to
[28:58] the building in that of the building of
[28:59] that
[29:00] temple
[29:04] what'd he say what'd the bible say there
[29:06] was not a sound
[29:09] of a hammer
[29:13] how in the world can you build something
[29:16] so
[29:16] glorious as a temple that was uh solomon
[29:19] temple
[29:20] was the greatest temple that ever was
[29:22] and the bible said
[29:24] there was not a sound of a hammer
[29:26] brother branham said
[29:27] those pieces fit together
[29:31] without any hammer and nails
[29:36] that's during the sin curse that's
[29:39] during
[29:40] the earth when we were building things
[29:44] i believe it'll happen the same way
[29:49] if you have one time in the natural
[29:53] i won't worry about it right here
[29:57] so it will be like it is speaking the
[30:00] word
[30:01] but i think we'll put the thing together
[30:04] i mean i'm just dumb enough to believe
[30:05] that solomon
[30:07] and if you'll remember in the book
[30:12] i think they cut the stones away
[30:15] yes they did they did
[30:18] and you remember who that was
[30:22] gentile that's right gentiles
[30:26] solomon made a pact with this man and i
[30:29] because uh i'll find it for next time
[30:32] because brother uh
[30:34] uh tim humes was preaching on unity
[30:37] fellowship when we started going to the
[30:39] medicine meeting
[30:41] and he preached on solomon and whoever
[30:42] this guy was this guy was a
[30:45] gentile and he lived on the coast
[30:49] and he had the river frontage and all
[30:51] that stuff and solomon just said hey i
[30:53] need this and so and that's and so and
[30:54] thus and so and the guy just brought it
[30:56] to him and all they do is when they
[30:57] brought it to israel
[30:58] they just went like a like lincoln logs
[31:00] and they just started putting the thing
[31:01] together
[31:02] all everything fit fit perfect
[31:06] i don't see why we that same thing can't
[31:08] happen now we'll do this because we want
[31:10] to
[31:12] now i believe the millennium temple will
[31:14] be constructed by the jews
[31:17] right because the bible said it would be
[31:18] built by their hand
[31:20] just like the pyramid they said
[31:23] sure exactly there's no way you could
[31:26] have a machine that put that together
[31:28] like that
[31:30] well it's all going to be because of the
[31:32] spoken word so this is
[31:34] like donnie said the spoken word made
[31:36] the first temple
[31:37] god said solomon you'll build the temple
[31:40] for me
[31:40] right won't be no sound of a hammer it
[31:42] won't be no sound of a saw
[31:44] it'll be put together in other words
[31:47] what he was doing
[31:48] he was showing a prefigure of this and
[31:50] this
[31:51] right only in earthly terms way back in
[31:54] the old testament
[31:56] because he never wanted to dwell in a
[31:57] city but he always wanted to dwell in
[31:59] this eternal city because who is that
[32:01] eternal city
[32:02] me and you that's what he wanted
[32:05] all right
[32:18] good questions
