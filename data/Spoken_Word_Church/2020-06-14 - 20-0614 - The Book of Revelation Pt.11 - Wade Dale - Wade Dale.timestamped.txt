[0:00] yeah got it okay just recording
[0:03] good okay all right well we're in the
[0:05] book of revelation
[0:07] we're in the book of revelations and
[0:08] we're going to go to revelation chapter
[0:10] four
[0:11] hey baby hey how you doing
[0:16] oh good to be danny i'm glad you i'm
[0:18] glad you brought in paw paw with you
[0:20] today
[0:20] yeah grand van gaal granddad's a chair
[0:24] huh you want something you want a chair
[0:27] yeah yeah
[0:28] come and sit right here
[0:32] right there you can head out that way
[0:35] we're just readjusting since we haven't
[0:36] been together in a while
[0:38] is that got enough power because it's
[0:39] not plugged in it's got enough power to
[0:42] orbit
[0:44] now we're trying to get everything back
[0:45] to normal maybe normal as we can get
[0:48] so uh god bless you we're gonna remember
[0:51] we went to the church ages through
[0:53] revelations chapter one two and three
[0:57] now remember the revelations chapter one
[0:59] two and three
[1:00] are or is god in the church ages
[1:04] god in the people in the seven stars
[1:08] and in the seven churches
[1:11] that were in each character ephesus
[1:13] smyrna
[1:14] pergamos and make sure i get them around
[1:17] thy torah
[1:18] sardis philadelphia and then laodicea
[1:20] and we know for a fact
[1:22] we're at the end of this layout of the
[1:24] age
[1:28] going heading toward the millennium
[1:30] because after this
[1:31] church age is over we take a rapture
[1:35] for us the church ain't to be over that
[1:37] church age goes all the way through that
[1:39] old seventh day that goes all the way to
[1:41] the future home
[1:44] so so that's in time
[1:48] time's going to continue on through the
[1:50] millennium it will be a thousand years
[1:53] it will be 360 days of the year not 365
[1:56] and a quarter
[1:58] right and it'll be that time continue
[2:01] will go
[2:01] but now when time will be no longer
[2:05] is when that new city comes down and
[2:07] we're even going to still be in
[2:08] time when when
[2:11] the judgment we look in the book of
[2:14] revelations where the books are open
[2:16] and judgment is set well that's still in
[2:17] time because those people that come up
[2:19] to that judgment bar
[2:20] are still in time but now once that's
[2:24] done once the devil's
[2:25] destroyed and all his ants are destroyed
[2:27] all this the spirits and evil things are
[2:29] destroyed
[2:31] then god's going to set this thing back
[2:33] up
[2:34] the way it should have been had they're
[2:35] not being followed amen
[2:37] then there'll be eternity it will time
[2:39] brother brown said time will blend into
[2:41] eternity
[2:42] right and um for us it'll be a
[2:46] we're in an eighth day now but our
[2:49] bodies are in the seventh day or in the
[2:51] seventh
[2:52] church age because we're in time
[2:55] that's why i said time would continue on
[2:58] after we're gone so this is what's
[3:00] happening now watch revelations remember
[3:02] this
[3:03] keep it straight brother ryan will tell
[3:05] us
[3:06] revelations chapter one through three
[3:10] everybody got that it's showing the
[3:13] bride
[3:15] and the characteristics of what we've
[3:17] got to put up with
[3:19] from the beginning
[3:23] until this time right here
[3:26] so that's the bride on earth everybody
[3:29] got that say amen because it's going to
[3:30] be important what we're going to talk
[3:32] about now
[3:33] because brother brown says in
[3:35] revelations 4 1 the bride
[3:37] leaves the earth and is not seen until
[3:39] revelations 19 that's a big
[3:41] jump right from revelation 4
[3:44] to revelations 19 because what is
[3:47] revelations 19
[3:48] us writing back in the millennium still
[3:50] in time
[3:52] we're coming back in time but now we're
[3:53] eternal creatures
[3:55] right now you're an eternal creature
[3:57] inside right
[3:59] but you're still in the old seventh day
[4:00] because everybody that's born of sex is
[4:02] in the seventh day
[4:03] you can't get out of it unless you die
[4:06] or take a body change
[4:08] all right and then that releases that
[4:09] first birth that that second birth can
[4:12] take over
[4:13] all right and that's what's going to
[4:15] happen we have a question the other day
[4:16] about the change of the body that's
[4:17] that's literally what's going to happen
[4:21] time is going to have to blend into
[4:22] eternity for us and the body here is
[4:24] going to be that the old body is not
[4:26] going to die but it's going to have to
[4:27] move over enough for that
[4:29] not new body the body that's inside of
[4:32] you that's forming
[4:33] can just take over the whole thing right
[4:36] and that's what happened to jesus jesus
[4:37] didn't have to get a new body
[4:40] right he resurrected in the same body
[4:42] that he lived in
[4:44] so are we but he remember he turned back
[4:45] to 20 years old
[4:47] because the gardener didn't recognize
[4:48] who he was even mary or mary thought he
[4:50] was a gardener
[4:51] because he turned back to a 20 year old
[4:52] kid all right i say kid
[4:55] when you're 60 years old 20 years a kid
[4:57] when you're 20 it's
[4:58] saying gold
[5:03] are you 28 not even close 17
[5:08] oh i got shoes over here
[5:12] [Music]
[5:14] when you say move over that body's going
[5:15] to move over can you expound
[5:18] that is a that is a
[5:21] example you're not going to come out of
[5:24] this body
[5:26] but your first body is going to yield to
[5:28] your second body
[5:29] the first body your mom and daddy made
[5:31] is what's killing us but i mean is this
[5:33] body just going to
[5:34] get younger and younger well it'll be a
[5:37] change
[5:37] in the moment and the twinkling of an
[5:39] eye
[5:42] just boom well that's what happened to
[5:43] abraham and sarah sometimes when they
[5:45] went to bed they were 99
[5:49] they preached about that 99
[5:52] and whatever she was okay 99 and 90 or
[5:56] 80 what else you though but when they
[5:59] woke up the next morning
[6:04] abraham thought he got the wrong bed
[6:06] sarah thought she got the wrong bed but
[6:08] that's what's gonna happen it's gonna be
[6:09] but i don't think we're gonna have to go
[6:11] to sleep for that to happen because
[6:12] remember that's the type they died
[6:15] remember they continued on and they died
[6:17] same way with
[6:18] um lazarus what am i what am i saying
[6:21] when we get a body change that's not
[6:23] going to be it changes back to young
[6:24] people when we get old and die again
[6:26] ours is permanent jesus didn't have to
[6:29] jesus's body was old
[6:30] well you know he wasn't 33 but he looked
[6:32] old but when he
[6:34] come out of that tomb he was in that 20
[6:36] year old body
[6:38] that coincided with the theophany that's
[6:40] inside that was inside of him
[6:41] and it just took over that's what
[6:43] happened because that soul released and
[6:45] went to hell
[6:45] right all right preaching the souls in
[6:47] prison getting a little bit off the
[6:48] subject here but anyway we're fixing to
[6:50] take a change right here
[6:52] so when he comes back up and when he
[6:54] steps inside that body because remember
[6:56] if somebody passes away
[6:58] at this moment you don't have to open
[7:00] the door for them to get out
[7:03] that spirit becomes in a faster
[7:04] dimension of that soul
[7:06] boom and you're in another dimension
[7:08] this one has to stay here because what
[7:11] we're lifelike matter we're solid our
[7:14] spirit's not solid
[7:15] the soul inside of you is not solid at
[7:17] the moment
[7:19] okay but one day
[7:23] mortal will become immortal
[7:27] that's what happened to jesus when he
[7:28] stood up you know he said all power in
[7:29] him and earth again
[7:30] in other words when he god almighty
[7:33] human flesh
[7:34] was in a flesh
[7:37] it was getting older he could not change
[7:39] his body
[7:41] at the time he was coming up why because
[7:43] he had to be the ultimate sacrifice
[7:46] he was the lamb so the lamb had to be
[7:48] put up
[7:49] in flesh but when he died on the cross
[7:52] he said unto them
[7:53] your hands i commend my spirit we know
[7:55] what happened
[7:56] the body just died when the spirit
[7:58] leaves the body it dies
[7:59] right so that's what happened to has
[8:02] happened in the past
[8:04] now what's going to happen is somebody's
[8:06] going to break around you know makes the
[8:07] example that death is going to come up
[8:09] your sleeve
[8:09] it's not going to start your gut dying
[8:12] it's an example
[8:14] when death comes on you because listen
[8:18] it's like brother brown said i'm not
[8:19] afraid of death
[8:21] but there is a little bit of a fear
[8:23] there because you don't know the
[8:25] you don't know the unknown what is it
[8:27] like the very moment you pass away and
[8:29] once
[8:30] well he told us he just said you step
[8:33] over into another dimension and
[8:34] you don't want to go back to that one
[8:37] so now there are some people that die
[8:39] that would like to come back
[8:42] because they go to a bad place i've
[8:45] always said about the jihadists and all
[8:47] them and get 70 virgins and all that
[8:48] other stuff they have a real rude
[8:50] awakening when they die
[8:51] when they blow theirself up
[8:54] they are not they are not in the same
[8:56] place
[8:58] that they thought they were going to but
[9:00] now you and i if you get born again
[9:02] get the baptismal holy ghost in your
[9:04] soul we know where we're going
[9:06] there is no doubt
[9:09] that you if you were to pass away you're
[9:12] going to step over into that other
[9:14] not another body it's just this one
[9:16] that's inside of you it's just going to
[9:17] move faster so it can go through that
[9:19] wall
[9:21] and you're standing in a faster
[9:22] dimension the sixth dimension thank god
[9:24] brother brown went there
[9:25] told us about it he said why would you
[9:27] fear this see
[9:30] so we have a apprehension of death but
[9:32] you should never fear death if you're
[9:33] born again if you're born again
[9:35] free pass free pass all the way into the
[9:39] future home
[9:40] but i would not want to be hey
[9:46] i would not say amen say amen amen
[9:51] amen just knock on dude that's what a
[9:53] lot of y'all do up in the sanctuary
[9:55] anyway
[9:57] not smile or nod and fall asleep
[10:01] but we've come to a place now to where
[10:04] we're going to take a rapture and then
[10:05] things are going to take place so this
[10:06] is what i'm telling you to break up
[10:08] to make up to this is that we look
[10:13] and brother brown says the bride goes up
[10:16] in revelation
[10:16] 3 1 4 1
[10:20] and is not saying to revelations 19 well
[10:22] there's a lot that goes on
[10:24] now he says that's to the jews now
[10:28] that is correct because the prophet
[10:30] knows what he's talking about
[10:32] and it's correct to us if we know what
[10:34] we're talking about
[10:35] right because revelations 4 1 is us
[10:38] going in the rapture
[10:40] but it says look after this i looked
[10:44] and behold the door was open in heaven
[10:46] and the first voice which i heard was as
[10:48] it were of a trumpet
[10:49] what a message talking to me
[10:52] now who typed the bride john type the
[10:54] whole ride right
[10:56] talking to me which said come up hither
[10:59] and i will show thee things which must
[11:01] be hereafter so that's typing the
[11:03] rapture but you know what it's also
[11:05] typing
[11:05] it's also typing revelation when you
[11:08] come to the end of the church age in
[11:10] your life
[11:11] because we go through justification
[11:13] sanctification
[11:15] baptism of the holy ghost and the
[11:16] opening of the word amen
[11:18] everybody got there one more time
[11:22] first three first three church ages type
[11:25] justification yes that mental church
[11:28] aids type
[11:29] sanctification right the fifth and sixth
[11:33] church age
[11:34] types the baptism of the holy ghost the
[11:36] man the intelligence
[11:37] and then the eagle age is the revealing
[11:40] or the
[11:41] coming up higher because without brother
[11:43] brown's message we couldn't go no higher
[11:45] right right we just have to keep dying
[11:49] waiting on somebody that's why i want to
[11:50] ask these people that doesn't think
[11:51] brother brown is the last
[11:53] prophet for the end time who's coming
[11:55] because somebody's got to do it
[11:57] right somebody's got to bring a message
[12:00] to get us in that door now who's the
[12:03] door christ
[12:05] christ is always the door but remember
[12:07] there's a porter that stands in the door
[12:09] that opens the door and tells you what's
[12:11] inside it preached that many times on
[12:13] the quarter
[12:14] because there was a porter came in every
[12:16] age
[12:18] pentecost was falling down
[12:21] paul comes on the scene opens the door
[12:25] lets the grip in then god doesn't shut
[12:28] the door
[12:29] man starts shutting the door when man
[12:31] starts shutting the door
[12:33] god stands irenaeus and he opens the
[12:36] door
[12:38] to the second church aid smyrna you
[12:40] understand what i mean
[12:42] so you've got porter's they're in uh
[12:45] john 10 i believe it is that's where it
[12:47] talks about the porter the porter stands
[12:49] at the door
[12:50] and if you'll notice in your very large
[12:53] hotels which i've never been to
[12:55] but one or two when somebody else paid
[12:57] for it was uh there's always a guy
[12:59] standing there with a tuxedo on and some
[13:01] of them even have top hats on and they
[13:03] have the cane and
[13:05] and they're i guess you may call it a
[13:08] concierge now
[13:10] it's somebody that knows everything
[13:11] about that building i said it right
[13:14] now they closed enough okay nobody else
[13:17] attempted
[13:18] nobody attempted to to uh correct me
[13:21] because most of the time they do
[13:22] june's name
[13:26] destiny is that right here a concierge
[13:30] is somebody that if you need to know
[13:32] where to go what time to eat
[13:34] where's the bathroom where's the ice
[13:36] machine
[13:37] you asked that person all the activities
[13:39] going on do i
[13:40] oh yeah all the activities in the area
[13:43] that's what the porter does
[13:44] because you know what the porter has
[13:46] entered in
[13:48] because you see what brother brown says
[13:49] i'm sorry we're not getting anywhere
[13:51] but paul god sends paul
[13:55] paul goes into the mind of god finds out
[13:58] what the people need
[14:00] and then he steps back out because you
[14:01] know he's not god
[14:03] right he's a representative right
[14:06] because the concierge usually is not the
[14:08] owner right and a porter is usually not
[14:10] the owner the owner you don't see the
[14:12] owner standing at the door of the hotel
[14:14] right he's off somewhere else okay
[14:16] because he built the thing
[14:18] he built a business model he built the
[14:20] plans
[14:21] and he had somebody build the building
[14:22] so he's off somewhere else that sounds
[14:24] like something familiar
[14:26] god gives you the plan builds the
[14:27] building puts everything there and
[14:29] he don't go off anywhere but he's not on
[14:31] the scene who's on the scene
[14:34] these seven starts the porter comes out
[14:36] stands the door paul
[14:37] says gives the message or somebody comes
[14:40] to the door
[14:42] and he says this is what's inside
[14:45] you go to the right service desk go to
[14:47] the left restaurant
[14:49] and he tell that's the same way as what
[14:51] hat what's happening
[14:53] when god sends these characters or
[14:55] messengers
[14:56] in each church age they're porters and
[14:59] they tell you what's the mind of god for
[15:01] that time
[15:03] period that time period not period but
[15:06] that time period
[15:07] each one of these so here we have
[15:09] brother branham at the end
[15:11] same thing porter but he's not just a
[15:14] porter
[15:15] he goes back into the mind of god and
[15:17] gets everything we need
[15:19] to take a body change okay and it does
[15:22] make him a little special but god's not
[15:24] a respectable person but
[15:26] i'm telling you he had a different
[15:29] every person every person had one
[15:32] message to give
[15:33] paul irenaeus martin columba all born
[15:36] martin luther wesley but when brother
[15:39] brown comes
[15:40] that's why it stumps people when he says
[15:42] i'm what i'm not the messenger of sia
[15:45] he's not right he'd be allowed
[15:48] or a pentecostal that's a pentecostal
[15:50] age
[15:51] because you got to look at brother brown
[15:53] with two things he had to do
[15:56] everybody else had to do just one
[15:59] bring your message preach to the people
[16:02] die go off the scene all right brother
[16:06] brown comes with two things he had to do
[16:07] number
[16:08] one restore just like all the other ones
[16:10] restore back to
[16:12] but he didn't just he didn't restore us
[16:13] back to right here
[16:16] the alpha and omega had to be the same
[16:18] so he had to restore us
[16:19] back to the faith of the fathers in the
[16:22] first church age which is the statue of
[16:24] a perfect man
[16:25] right that's why it's so ill-taught in
[16:28] this message
[16:28] but it's the very foundation of the
[16:32] first part of brother brown's message
[16:34] if you can't get you you say well this
[16:36] is a mystery
[16:37] hey paul peter
[16:41] they were all right here right yeah they
[16:44] had these virtues working
[16:45] in their life so this is not something
[16:48] new brother
[16:49] now look brother brown did come to bring
[16:50] us the pyramid and faith virtue
[16:53] knowledge temperance
[16:54] you know to draw the chart remember he
[16:56] was sitting in the woods squirrel
[16:58] hunting
[16:58] he said the revelation came and this is
[17:00] what he drew to preach the statue of a
[17:02] perfect man
[17:04] but where do you get it from first peter
[17:06] saint peter yeah
[17:07] add to your faith virtue virtual
[17:09] knowledge but nobody's ever done this so
[17:11] you can put this
[17:12] some of you can't see them i know they
[17:13] inside this
[17:15] can see that brother brown put all this
[17:17] together though
[17:18] he takes revelations three one through
[17:21] three he takes and positions all the
[17:25] messengers
[17:27] see what brother brown's doing he's
[17:28] restoring just like elijah did
[17:32] excuse me in kings when the
[17:35] prophets of baal beat down the altar for
[17:38] the altar of
[17:39] first thing elijah done he never said a
[17:41] word he went and started putting the
[17:43] rocks back on the altar what he was
[17:44] restoring worship
[17:46] right so he's restoring back to right
[17:48] here we can't get people in the message
[17:51] off from down here
[17:52] yeah baby faith
[17:55] because you're not born again right here
[17:58] you're not born again anywhere except
[18:00] down here
[18:01] below the pyramid if you're not born
[18:03] again
[18:05] this is nothing but a beautiful picture
[18:10] i mean really it's just a pretty picture
[18:12] if you're not born again because you're
[18:14] born again at faith
[18:15] justification satisfaction baptism of
[18:17] the holy ghost
[18:20] god honors your faith just like he
[18:23] honored abraham's faith and circumcised
[18:25] him he honored abraham's faith
[18:26] i in your faith and circumcises your
[18:29] heart
[18:30] and gives you the bible from the holy
[18:32] ghost according to your faith yes right
[18:34] right
[18:35] right right but brother brown says
[18:38] god give me this eye he said this is my
[18:40] eye god gave it to me
[18:41] so when god gives you the new birth it's
[18:43] not his anymore sure
[18:46] so then you start again as we've talked
[18:48] many times before you start again then
[18:50] in justification because what does
[18:51] justification do
[18:53] the real you did we're not going to get
[18:56] anywhere
[18:56] but revelations 4 1.
[19:00] down here the real you did it when you
[19:03] start coming up through these things and
[19:05] you see god knocking a lot of this stuff
[19:06] out of your life the trash remember in
[19:08] sister chapter 3 of the trash
[19:10] when he starts knocking that trash out
[19:12] you go through another
[19:14] stage of justification not to justify
[19:17] you
[19:19] of your past sins that's already done
[19:21] but you got you start seeing it again
[19:24] yes you do why do you think all the
[19:27] trash had to be burned out after you get
[19:29] the
[19:29] new birth why do you think you need all
[19:31] these verses after you mourning you i
[19:33] just got everything see that's what a
[19:34] lot of people say in the message
[19:35] to me that's a lazy christian to say
[19:37] that man then i got everything i needed
[19:40] and i'm just gonna sit at home or i'm
[19:41] gonna
[19:42] right you know that's right
[19:46] folks this is the fight you're fighting
[19:49] your old nature
[19:50] all the way up through here that's right
[19:52] that's right
[19:53] but god's gonna show you in this type of
[19:56] justification
[19:58] that the real you didn't do it
[20:02] yeah you know you did it
[20:06] like i've always said you drive by them
[20:07] places i can't do away with them places
[20:09] i did bad things that
[20:11] but you know what god doesn't sell
[20:13] that's why you should never
[20:15] ever ask god to forgive you your past
[20:16] sins if you've already asked him to
[20:18] forgive you and you believe you've been
[20:19] justified
[20:20] he's going to look at you and go what
[20:23] sin is you talking about
[20:25] but you do sin as a christian this is
[20:26] what brother brown's talking about
[20:28] you sin as a christian right here you
[20:31] don't sin as a christian down here
[20:33] because you're not a christian until you
[20:34] get the right hand
[20:35] everybody got that right trying to get a
[20:37] little bit slow there
[20:39] but we'll be um we need to get out at 10
[20:41] 10 so we can get upstairs just about
[20:42] three more minutes
[20:44] but then you go through look first your
[20:45] knowledge temperature
[20:47] and remember like brother dale said
[20:48] there are
[20:50] definitions human definitions or what i
[20:53] say
[20:59] the definitions that man has come up
[21:01] with
[21:02] that's not what that is virtue virtue
[21:05] to the world is is that you're a virgin
[21:08] or that you have a virtuous life
[21:11] but now brother well are you are you
[21:13] kept yourself
[21:14] clean you understand what i mean but
[21:16] brother i said this virtue was strength
[21:18] right power virtue went out from jesus
[21:20] when the woman touched his garment
[21:22] we get weak when things happen in the in
[21:25] the spirit realm
[21:26] and you see people get a little bit weak
[21:28] because of different things
[21:30] that's not man's knowledge right because
[21:32] the bible says knowledge puffed
[21:34] up and all these different things
[21:36] knowledge will run to and fro
[21:38] knowledge will increase that's not god's
[21:40] knowledge yes it is to a point
[21:42] because god but this is god's knowledge
[21:44] brother brown said to know what the
[21:45] bible says and know what to do about it
[21:47] you see what man
[21:48] so you go through justification again
[21:50] amen god keeps every day
[21:52] chopping off your past sins if you ask
[21:54] him to forgive you of that
[21:55] and make it right then you go do
[21:58] sanctification again what is
[21:59] sanctification oh lord is cleaning and
[22:01] setting a sign for service so
[22:03] what god's cleaning you up in here again
[22:07] okay because there is still unclean
[22:09] spirits right here because they're in
[22:10] your spirit realm
[22:12] not in your salt have i got that right
[22:15] then when you come up to here that was a
[22:17] question the other day brother talks
[22:19] about the holy spirit sealing this
[22:21] in what adoption
[22:24] where it's not that you're just some
[22:28] christian robot right you're not a
[22:31] christian robot
[22:31] amen i don't do anything wrong i don't
[22:34] do anything
[22:36] no you come to a consciousness
[22:39] that when something does happen you stop
[22:42] it real quick
[22:43] instead of letting it go further like
[22:44] you used to do all right so you've got
[22:46] justification thank you
[22:47] for baptising the holy ghost
[22:49] justification baptism of the holy ghost
[22:52] have i got that that's why they wrote
[22:54] holy spirit right there
[22:56] but now this is god himself
[23:00] right amen the the um
[23:04] founding fathers if you want to say are
[23:06] the first church
[23:08] age didn't have this this is jesus
[23:10] christ this is the son of man he went
[23:12] away
[23:14] but he became the cornerstone which is
[23:16] exactly apparent little pyramid
[23:18] the headstone became the cornerstone
[23:19] that's right built the church back up
[23:21] and they stopped right here because they
[23:23] couldn't go any further god had to send
[23:24] us a prophet
[23:26] to give us rapturing faith to get out of
[23:29] here
[23:30] okay so this rapture and faith now we're
[23:32] going through and we got we will realize
[23:37] that i am sinless because god said i'm
[23:40] saying this
[23:43] and this is what's going to take us out
[23:45] here we get all this together
[23:48] that's what we're doing now the porter
[23:50] has got has given us the message to get
[23:52] everything together
[23:54] so that we can go in this open door it's
[23:56] not a door squeezed open
[23:57] this thing's open and the bride's gonna
[24:00] go up through that door
[24:02] and then immediately i was in the spirit
[24:03] and behold the throne was set in heaven
[24:05] and
[24:05] one you know i'm going to meet three
[24:08] right
[24:09] one set on the throne you see that
[24:12] now look that's italicized one one
[24:15] sitting on the throne right and it's not
[24:17] look it's not even a definition for that
[24:19] because one means
[24:21] one all right let's go that's right one
[24:24] means one
