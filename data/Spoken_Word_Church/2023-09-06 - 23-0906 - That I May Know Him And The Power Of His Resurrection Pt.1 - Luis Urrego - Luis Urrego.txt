Philippians chapter 3. amen and so the song that I was singing um I guess it kind of goes in tune with what I want to talk about and uh I've been reading on on uh in in First Corinthians chapter 15. and if you all know that's probably one of the if if you had maybe 10 scriptures in the Bible that you'd put as the top ten that'd probably be one of the top 10 scriptures First Corinthians chapter First Corinthians chapter 15 where it talks about the resurrection amen and and and the and and how we identify the in the resurrection and and and Paul goes into details as in into the resurrection and and and then it brings us even brings it even down towards uh the resurrected Saints and a Rapture amen uh they're at the end so uh if you all have time just go through and read that and and just look over it but I just felt led to just go ahead and go this this direction uh just looking at some things there and the Lord showed me some things and I hopefully that the Lord will show you some things through it as well so we might not be able to get it's a long chapter about 58 verses if I'm not mistaken so maybe we might not be able to finish this tonight but we'll uh we'll finish it at another time so in Philippians chapter 3 verse 7 through 11 says but what things this is Paul speaking but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ yea doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done now we all know what dung is and dungus is you don't even pay attention to it afterwards this is what he says that he considers everything that he learned all that he had accomplished nothing but something that you just flushed down the toilet can you imagine the conversion that Paul had to think of of his life in that way do we do we do we and sometimes we hold things back in our well I don't want to give this up in my life I don't want to serve Christ uh fully because out that means I'll have to give this music and my life up I'll have to give this up in my life but here Paul he he experienced Christ in such a way that he counted everything that he had learned all his life all the The Prestige that he had gotten nothing but done at this man has really been converted this man's really been converted for whom I have suffered the loss of all things see he lost something and do count them but done that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith and watch this verse 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection look the way he words it there the power of his resurrection amen and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead amen so let's just buy our heads before we be seated Lord Jesus we thank you once again for giving us a privilege to open back the pages of your word father God I'm insufficient Within Myself Lord and I ask you father that you were just help me to just calm my spirit down lord God and and Lord you just use my lips Lord Jesus to speak father God according to your word Lord father you anoint my lips and and anoint the ears that are here listening to your word father that they may be edified Lord Jesus and you and you glorified Lord and we just commit ourselves into you blessed brother they'll bust the family Lord just be with them Lord this this evening father God and just give her the devil the strength and rest that he needs Lord and also continue to be with brother Boyd and brother how Lord there and and the decisions that they have to make there Lord we ask that you just give them strength and just give them wisdom Lord God during this time lord Jesus and we just commit these things into your hands we thank you Lord that we have one that we can lay our heads upon Lord Jesus and that's you father what a what a thing it would be Lord we wouldn't have a shoulder to lean upon Lord but father your shoulder is always there Lord we can cast our burdens upon you Lord God because you care father God and Lord we can we can put our our burdens Lord for our family members Lord our burdens for for our loved ones our burdens for our friends for for situations upon you because that's what you want us to do Lord God because you want us to be in full rest and Lord we just trust your word this evening we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you saying she may be seated foreign amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so we just want to do a little Wednesday Sunday school service we're just going to go through the scriptures here amen and um but I wanted to read this quote here um you know because I know that do you all know we're living in crazy times in the hour that we're living in if you don't know that amen wake up [Laughter] we're living in an insane world and the country's becoming more insane by the day we have uh uh uh a clown show up in Washington D.C uh and and it just doesn't get better and better we don't even know what's going on up there but that right there is letting us know amen that that's not what we need to be dependent upon I'm not depending my soul and my life on on what's going on in Washington DC or on a coming on coming uh uh the presidential elections people are like well Trump's getting back in this and Trump was the one who put us in this stuff in the first place in 2020. all right so you just think about that all right there's no man amen that's going to save you except the Lord Jesus Christ no no politician amen no no savior the world is looking for a messiah the world is looking for for for a Superman to rise on the scene hey man he's already coming and and gone amen he should be living in you that Superman amen there's not going to be any other Superman but the Lord Jesus Christ amen and that's what we should be hoping for is for the coming of the Lord you know sometimes we talk about we talk about politics and still letting people start who was he going that direction you know but brother Branham talked about politics so anyways but but you see that's not where we need to put our trust on Amen I I hope that 2020 and I hope that this last three years have taught us something because it certainly has taught me a lot of stuff and uh and now they're talking about bringing the masks back in and the lockdowns again or what is that about so you all just just pray you all just pray because it's a clown show it's really what it is so so because I tell you what I'm sick and tired of it to be honest with you amen but brother Brandon says here in the in the mystery Christ in Christ's mystery of God revealed he says but I'm taking I'm talking about the headship of Christ he said he said notice being personally identified by the original headship amen we have the answer to the devil's question amen praise the Lord amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price and raising up the head the body amen the devil can't stand it and that's the reason why he's howling around here continues here that's the reason these ecumenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they are doing now and they're all in lockstep doing the same thing amen that you can't you can't say it's a coincidence oh it's just a coincidence no they're all in lockstep doing the exact same thing but if we know it's what the power behind it is is nothing but the devil amen and so let the devil do whatever it wants to do because it's drawing us closer to God it's drawing me closer to my knees amen and it should do that to you as well praise God so let the devil do because the Bible says that this Kingdom amen this world is this is the devils this is his domain this is this this is his playground and he's got his little chess pieces amen so let him do whatever he wants to do amen because what that's doing to us amen is drawing us to be more like him amen praise God but we shouldn't be we shouldn't be uh uh uh what's the word I'm looking for we shouldn't be ignorant of the devil's devices we shouldn't be ignorant amen because sometimes women we're just so carried up with the things of this life you got your Apple Apple phone you got your your devices and you got your your job and you got stock in your money in your in your in your bank account ah that all can't happen to me but I do remember brother Brandon talking about a squeeze coming down and gas prices don't seem to be going getting less and food I mean is getting worse it's not the food that's getting more expensive amen it's the money that's that's being devalued so so so it's a little squeeze that's happening amen and this should make us look more and more towards the word and I have so much so much dependence upon this upon this world and upon the the the the the the new gadgets that come out and all that kind of stuff amen that has amen the word is what changes us amen that's the reason these economical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they are doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is amen his wickedness has been his scheme has been uncovered by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body amen praise the Lord Jesus so he is the head we know that Christ is the head and wherever the head does Amen the body follows amen and if you and I are the body of Christ amen if he raised amen then we raise along with we were raised with him as well amen if you are born again and have this the Holy Ghost dwelling within you praise the Lord amen so as I said you know everyone's looking for a Superman right now amen and and even at the time of brother Brown and brother Brown was was saying how people back then they were looking for a Superman amen and and even in the in the in the days of of Israel amen when where they were looking for the Messiah amen they were looking for someone to come in and stump out the Romans and and and and freedom politically when in reality what they needed was was was was someone to Freedom spiritually and that spiritual savior came and they didn't recognize who he was they didn't recognize that that was God himself coming down to free them God himself not another man not another he didn't say nobody else he came down himself that was who the Messiah was to be and God comes down on the scene amen service after service and and and and in different ways in your life and we fail to recognize that it's God moving on the scene we failed to realize that it's God amen because sometimes we're looking over something else right right and God's Right Here Waiting amen praise the Lord so amen what the bride in this hour desires amen is the resurrection of the Saints and man I'm not looking for anything else but the resurrection because that's the next that's the next coming event amen I don't know what all the details of it are I just know that I want to be ready when it happens amen and there the Bible says that they can't be perfected without us without us they cannot be perfected so you have to be perfected in order for them to be perfected praise God you have to make sure that you are living the life of Christ praise the Lord Jesus now we know that nature testifies of a resurrection amen we see the the sun setting in the morning and it it dies in the evening amen but that's not the end of it amen we see it again coming up in the morning you see and so it's like it's like a resurrection amen we see the the leaves that fall in in in in in in in the fall we're coming to a time right now where where leaves are turning yellow and and they're getting ready to fall and they'll the sap will come down to the the bottom of the tree and and but that's not the end of that tree amen because that tree a man will eventually that sap will come back up amen the leaves will come back out in the springtime and that that tree looks like it never had a death before right you never you never would have thought ma that tree looked barrelless you know a couple of months ago because that's how powerful the resurrection is amen praise the Lord I remember I was I was talking to a brother brother Jorge Rivas who came here to spoke for us a couple of years ago from Colombia and he was in our backyard on our deck he was drinking his coffee he was spending the night at our house drinking his coffee and uh and I'm from Colombia you know so he was back there look drinking and he was just admiring and it was January the dead of winter right and he was just admiring and enjoying the cold drinking his coffee and I went back there and I said I said brother brother Jorge I said this back here looks much nicer in the summertime I mean with all the trees with all the leaves have grown out and everything and he said brother Louise you just don't understand where I'm from I see trees with leaves all the time everywhere I go I see trees with leaves I don't see trees with leaves this is this is I'm enjoying this and I never thought of that you know I never thought that you you know that that they they don't see that if we do we see it and so to them it's something amazing you know we think it's ugly but to them it's amazing at least to him it was and so I said well you know what brother you just keep enjoying keep drinking you want me to get more another cup for you and uh but it's a beautiful time for God too amen you know the trees they look so much beautiful Amen in the in the fall but they're dying the leaves are dying but that's when the the most beauty is the that's when you want to go up to the mountains to look at them right yet the leaves are dying at that moment and so it makes us think about our lives amen how how some of us hey man we're dying amen but but we're dying each and we're once are dying amen our physical bodies are degenerating hey man I don't feel like when I was 21 years old amen but but but but but you see uh the Bible says that precious is the death of his Saints amen so it's something beautiful to him because it's a graduation time for those who for his Saints amen and it also makes him a candidate for a resurrection hey man you think about that praise the Lord because you see there is going to be a time where there's going to be a people who are going to be alive and remain right the Bible talks about that Paul talked about that but then those that are alive and remain would not have experienced what a resurrection is but those that have gone past beyond the curtain of time amen those that have gone before us amen they will be able to experience that and so I believe that that that's beautiful in the sight of God because he knows what it's like because wherever the head goes the body goes with it I always give this example for young people to understand amen when you get up in the morning amen what is the first thing that gets up in the morning it's usually our head right sometimes we drag our feet down on the floor like this and oh God yeah but usually the normal person gets up and his head gets up amen and so that's why Peter I mean Paul here is going to describe as Jesus resurrecting the first fruits of the Resurrection right and we'll read we'll read it here in just a moment so we have no we have not to be uh be afraid of of death Saints amen we we have not need to be uh uh uh to be afraid that well we only we only live for Christ here and we only experience Christ here amen Christ will be with us even there amen praise God I believe the Saints amen that have gone past before us they're enjoying Aaron join Bliss right now and they're they're they're if we could just hear them amen beyond the curtain of time we could just hear him telling us keep going keep praying keep pressing on just keep keep doing what you're supposed to be doing amen because I'm they're saying I'm telling you it's worth it it's worth every every every drop that Every Teardrop that you shed amen every prayer that you pray every scripture that you sit down and take time to read it's it's all worth it amen and it won't be in vain amen and so Paul here in in first in First Corinthians 15 where we're going to be reading here in just a moment amen Paul says amen that if there is no Resurrection amen then what we preach and what you believe is all in vain if there is no such thing as a resurrection everything that we that we Christianity is based upon the fact that we have had a resurrection it was Jesus Christ right and if all that is done away with if there is no such thing as that then why are you here why do you pray why do you just not go back to the world why do you just not go back and doing the things that you used to do remember something has drawn you amen a living Christ has drawn you it's not a dead Christ something dead doesn't draw you but a living Christ does draw you amen a living Christ draws you I I hope it was a living Christ that Drew me amen and I want that living Christ to be living in me amen praise the Lord Jesus so we see it in nature nature testifies of a resurrection Amen brother brother Wade's been talking about metamorphosis amen about the caterpillar even the caterpillar testifies of a resurrection maybe we'll look into that later on Amen I've been looking at some things in in detail about that it it's very powerful by the way the process of metamorphosis but the foundation of the Christian faith is the fact that Jesus resurrected that is the foundation amen that is the foundation you see that's the that's the main point of Christianity amen Christianity can be summed up in in in in in in in this way amen God created man man sin needed a redeemer amen nothing else could redeem him amen but God himself so he came down himself and so he redeemed man but now amen he just doesn't want to redeem him he wants to live in them amen and that's that's that's what that's that's the that's Christianity right there tell me one thing in this life amen that can that can one that that can do that for you amen you know in in the in the comic book world or in the or in the in the stories that that you read amen there's always that that that protagonist amen that if he dies oh we want him to come back again oh and sometimes he does and the series continues right sometimes he does but you see where did they get that yeah it came from the Bible even the world has to testify of a resurrect to Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord amen well thank God for that now the prophet tells us here in in the message Awakening Jesus he says let us remember also that he created our bodies now listen to this I hope that sister freda's list is listening to this listen to this this might help her won't our bodies obey his command if he created him right spit out that cancer he says to the body amen and away it goes praise God you just take that word and plan it in here and see what happens sure yes sir our bodies has to obey his command praise the Lord you you say you're a Christian I believe you are you believe why are you resting what are you resting in someday he'll raise our bodies up after they've absolutely completely perished praise the Lord if you watch this if you don't believe that why do you go to church if you don't believe that if something happens to you maybe on the way to church amen that you are going to amen being coming in a resurrection you're you that same body that went down is the same body that's coming up amen then what you're doing is is in is in vain but we know it's not in vain if you don't believe that why do you go to church if there's no Resurrection aren't we amongst men most miserable but his Word of Promise he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live amen Jesus said I am the resurrection and life amen he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I'll raise him up at the last days my why the body the ashes the volcanic ashes that we're made out of obey his command because he's the creator of it amen praise the Lord Jesus amen you don't have to sit there with yours and accept your sickness you don't have to sit there and accept your your your your situation amen whatever your body goes through because he's the creator of your body you can speak to it because you have the living Christ dwelling in you amen and the living Christ dwelling in you amen that that thing because Devils were created as well and if the living Christ is living in you amen you can speak to that devil you can speak to that mountain you can speak to that thing amen and it's got to obey the life that's within us is not only a creative life but it's part of his own life that's the reason we have the authority to speak to a devil because it's God's Own created life if your anointed see correctly not you it's not you that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in you amen praise the Lord amen now the the word Resurrection amen this is what it means indeed in the dictionary it says the act or fact of bringing someone back to life or bringing something back into use or existence now the key thing about Resurrection is bringing that same thing back to life it's not replacing Resurrection is not replacement Resurrection is whatever went down is the same thing that comes back up because it was it was the body of Jesus Christ that went down but it's not the body of Jesus Christ that you see in that tomb today it's not is that it's not there it's what came up you see praise the Lord Jesus and so it's not replacement sometimes you know in the nominal world you know we have the thought that that that God's going to give us a another body amen and and I don't know how it all works in regards to the theophany amen but but but there's not another body because something's got to happen to this body that goes down right this body's not going to be lost this body's part of you and me amen so there's got to be a resurrection for this body because it's what happened on uh with Jesus Christ the same body that went down is the same body that came up praise the Lord Jesus so we're it's not going to be lost this is this is you now we know that the the the the the soul is is is the real you God said All Souls are mine and we know that that that is the real you amen but this flesh amen this spirit amen it's part it's part of Who You Are amen there's all there's a connection there and God won't lose that amen praise the Lord Jesus so um there's another part here the resurrection meaning it says Resurrection or anastasis or anastasis is the concept of coming back to life after death in a number of religions a dying and Rising God is a deity which dies and is resurrected reincarnation is a similar process hypothesized by other religions which involves the same person or deity coming back to another body so we know it's not reincarnation amen I don't see the word in anywhere in the Bible but it is resurrection praise the Lord amen you take for example the the the the the the the the example of of pawning something amen when you go upon something and you want to go get that thing back amen they don't give you something else you're pawning amen they're giving you back what you pawned right amen and that's the same thing with Resurrection amen whatever went down is what's coming back up amen praise God now we know that Satan he's the God of this world and and he loves to copy God but in a perverted way amen he's he's a pervert Yeah if you didn't already figure that out he's a pervert and he's making people act like perverts you can see it out in the streets you can see it if you live in Beaufort do you see it a lot there it's terrible you can't even go into Target now how much perversion it is man with dresses and you can't say anything about it that's what I guess Target's losing sales and Budweiser but going out of business well thank God anyways let it happen whatever needs to happen amen but you see Satan we know he can't create he only perverts what has been created amen and and so I you know reading the scientific things and stuff like that you know do you know that they plan to actually they're trying to resurrect a woolly mammoth they want to bring back the woolly mammoth if the woolly mammoth existed I I guess it did but they're trying to bring back the woolly mammoth now this this is what this is what they say yeah I was talking to my daughters about this the the other day and we were talking about this and what they're saying they want to they want to bring it back a woolly mammoth back within a decade this was in 2021 so they got a couple more years left but this is what they're saying previous discussions on resurrecting this is and they're using the word Resurrection resurrecting long extinct animals like the woolly mammoth have been largely theoretical but colossal uh is a company or scientific uh consensus or a group that has taken many of the first steps towards resurrecting the creature using a gene editing technology called crispr amen and so if you've never heard of crispr I mean that's what crispr is amen those letters represent uh I forgot what what they represent but it's it's what it is where they keep replicating Gene uh genes and um and they're trying to create they're trying to create humans even in that way so he says here because woolly mammoths and Asian elephant shared a common ancestor some six million years ago church this is the the man spearheading this his last name is church [Laughter] rewrite the elephant's DNA to produce what's to produce something that looks and behaves like a mammoth using crispr you see they can't Resurrect The a true thing they can only copy if they can do this they they can they can only say that we can only bring something that looks like it like a mammoth using crispr which acts as a copy and paste tool for for genetic code that's what Chris that's what crispr technology is so my I thank God that God Amen doesn't just bring something that looks like it amen he brings Resurrection to him is is that whole thing amen the original that went down is the original that comes up praise God Amen so it's the difference between see Satan wants to copy God but he can't he can't he perverts amen he perverts the people he perverts uh uh you you know man trying to be women and women trying to be man and and and the way that they're trying to botch their bodies and and all that stuff and it doesn't work it doesn't work because science say man uh uh tells you amen that it that it that it that it doesn't there's there's a there's a footprint or there's a print right there and you and it doesn't work but a lot of people that say that they're transitioning and they're a lot of them are transitioning trying to transition back because it's not it doesn't work amen there's nothing like the original Saints young people don't don't allow for your for your Minds to be perverted in a way where they're trying to push these agendas on you and say that you're going to be happy and that you're going to be free and that you're going to be a lot of them is just a bunch of work work of taking hormones hormones and doing all kinds of they don't have a peaceful life just because they're trying to make themselves look a certain way that's not the peace of God the peace of God doesn't amen doesn't doesn't uh when the peace of God is really in you amen it's uh it doesn't make you do it it makes you just lay down your burdens give them to the Lord amen praise God amen so so this this crispr technology now they they've succeeded cloning an animal or cloning human body parts my wife was showing me a picture of a of a mouse the other day that that there that their clone or they're trying to build you know human ears upon upon a mouse and it just looks so silly they got this they got this mouse and it's got a a human ear hanging on uh on it and stuff like that and it's such a perversion this is what brother Branham called amen that they're all in God's Laboratory trying to to make something that is that they can say we did it they cloned the Sheep about 20 years ago called Dolly I believe that sheep is dead now yeah yeah and so but they can't call no human they're as far as I know there's no cloned humans because they can't clone a soul that's the reason they can clone an animal but they can't clone a soul amen because the souls belong to God Amen praise the Lord so we just thank God for that now let's go to First Corinthians chapter 15. First Corinthians chapter 15. and we're going to talk about this resurrection of Christ now we'll just take it verse by verse and we'll see how the Lord leads here it's interesting that Paul here he's talking to the to the Corinthians amen and and in the Corinthians you know they were Gentiles and uh you know Paul had some issues with the Corinthians he had to he had to spank him I guess many times and write to them and let them know because they were they were they were uh um uh just very immature and so in this time the Corinthians the Corinthians being uh in the area of Greece amen a lot of people back then uh during in that time they were not not agnostics um um they didn't believe in resurrections and maybe they might have had influences from maybe the Sadducees he uh because the Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection they didn't believe in spirits and they didn't believe in angels so we don't know exactly why the Corinthians some of these Corinthians that Paul is talking to were having a problem with Resurrection but they were so Paul uh starts here in First Corinthians 15 and he tells them moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand so we thank God for for for those those that did receive the Gospel amen because imagine living in that time amen where where it was nothing they didn't some of them were just were just heathens and they had they had all these different gods and all these amen and they had one place there for the unknown God and Paul said that's the god I come to preach to you that's the Paul I come to teach you about amen the unknown God so that you can know him and so amen verse two it says by which also ye are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain amen for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures amen and you think about this amen that that that in the scriptures you know there's different parts you know uh Isaiah talked about how he was to be wounded by our with our transgressions but it's by his stripes you know we were healed uh Isaiah mentioned that and and then other other prophets mentioned it about it and and you see these different types Amen in in in the scriptures even the the life of Abraham amen you look at the life of Abraham and and how God asked uh asked him a man to go sacrifice your son your only begotten son though you you you're you're the one that you love now at that time Abraham had had Ishmael he had two sons at that time but God tells him go sacrifice the one that you love the one that God promised to him and here goes Abraham imagine this Abraham the Bible says that it was about three days journey three days journey up in the mountain how long was Christ in in the grave heading up and you think about this Abraham in Abraham's mind Isaac was already dead because he was obeying God I'm whatever he said I'm doing can you imagine can you put yourself in that in that position you Dad or or you mom if God told you to do that I'm like Lord just take me take me but he said Abraham go sacrifice your son the one that you love and as he's riding his horse up there as he's walking with his servants his servants are just doing what he's Abraham's telling them to do and Isaac is right there right behind him he's looking at Isaac and his Isaac to him and his mind is already dead because that's the only way he can obey God so he goes he goes he goes to that point and he tells the servants he says stay here me and my lat the ladder are going to go worship but we're gonna come back hey man praise God we're gonna come back and then we know that right there he ties he ties Isaac right there on the table and and Isaac tells him Dad we have the the table and the wood but where is the sacrifice and he said God will provide himself a sacrifice amen and then right there right here before he's getting ready to put that God stops him that angel stops him the angel the Bible says the angel of the Lord amen and so he comes back down the mountain amen they sacrificed the ram call it Jehovah Jireh comes back down to the mountain back with Isaac the way Isaac went is the way he came back amen unharmed untouched amen speaking of a resurrection amen so Paul here is telling us hey man as a Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures in the Old Testament amen many different things that had happened they meant testifying of that and that being one of them and that in verse 4 and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures amen and that he was seen of cephas then of The Twelve now now Paul here is bringing the the witnesses the witnesses that that witnessed Jesus amen after he was raised from the dead amen because without Witnesses amen anybody can say anything but now here's the here's he bringing Witnesses and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve after that he was seen of above 500 Brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep so it looks like there's over 500 people here that he's mentioning that Saul Jesus after he resurrected amen after that he was seen of of James I'm not sure which one of the James was it it could have been the James that was the brother of Jesus but uh I'm not sure the half-brother of Jesus then then of all the apostles and last of all he was seen of me also as one born out of Due Time amen Amen in the in the in the in the in the Contemporary English version it says finally he appeared to me even though I am like someone who was born at the wrong time amen so Paul is saying here I saw him as well and I'm a witness of his resurrection that he is alive because I talked with him and he changed my life Paul wasn't the same then amen amen when he when he was walked when he was writing Amen on that road to Damascus amen he thought he was all Almighty taken care we're going to just take care of all these Christians we're going to just put them all in jail kill them amen he was he was blinded but then God blinded him he needed to be blinded so that he could see Jesus amen praise God so he so he continued we'll just go down to verse 12 amen it says here now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the Dead you know when I was younger and I was this scripture really caught my attention and I'm I'm thinking my how could someone believe that that there is no resurrection of the Dead when when it's the foundation of the scriptures it's the foundation of Christianity that he rose from the dead how says I'm among you that there is no resurrection of that but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risen in other words Christ did not rise if there's no Resurrection from that and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain amen amen so if you don't really believe what that Christ died if you if you read it and you really don't believe it and you can't apply that to your life amen then what are we doing right right you're wasting your time go home you're wasting your time coming to church you're wasting your time kneeling down to pray you're wasting your time telling someone about Christ if Christ did not raise from the great but we know that he raised from the grave amen praise the Lord Jesus and where we have verse verse 14 and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching vein and your faith is also vain verse 15 yea and we are found false Witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if if so be that the dead rise not so we're just false Witnesses Paul is saying we're only just false Witnesses if we are preaching that to you and the apostles are false Witnesses everybody that's preached amen that Christ has died and raised amen there's they're just false Witnesses if so be that the dead rise not amen can you imagine I mean the world walks like that in this life with no hope amen but the Christian doesn't have to walk that way we have a hope in Christ amen as I said earlier amen it's a head amen a shoulder that we can lean upon praise the Lord Jesus verse 16 for if the dead rise not then it's not Christ raised and if Christ be not raised your faith isn't is vain ye are yet in your sins now now think about that those are very strong words from Paul amen that if Christ is not raised amen then you are still a sinner you are still yet in your sins if Christ is not raised amen and your faith is in vain what is vain vain means for not it means it means that that there's no purpose amen but we know that's not the case then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished they're gone everybody all your loved ones that have gone past before you they're that they're just rotting in the ground in other words is what Paul is saying amen so we have no hope to seeing them now I'm talking loud now I'm talking like Paul is talking to the Corinthians we have no hope of seeing our loved ones because Christ did not raise you see what kind of imagine living life like that amen what a great thing amen it is to think that amen that that we serve a living Christ amen we that we serve a resurrected Christ and that there were Witnesses of his resurrection and you and I are witnesses of his resurrection amen the life that that that you was once lived amen you don't live anymore why you've experienced that Resurrection amen at least you don't have to true Christianity amen is is as you walk in this way amen and you take a 180 degree turn go back the other way amen sometimes we we do this and we think that that there's a change but is it changed back to the same thing there's no change that's where a lot of people do Christianity Today they just do 360 degree turn and back in the same thing as long as I'm going to church as long as I'm paying my tithes as long as I'm a little bit it doesn't matter what I do at home as long as I'm doing that you're walking the same route that you were that you that you started you need to do the 180. amen Christ is calling you from here you go back and listen to where Christ is calling you from amen truth praise the Lord then they are also which are fallen asleep in Christ or Paris you know we have we have hope saints that we're going to see our loved ones I have hopes that I'm going to see my my in-laws amen I have hopes that we're going to see you know brother Royal amen I think I think this week is going to be tomorrow is going to be two years since he since he passed away what a thing it is to think that I'll I'll never see him again amen well that we'll never see brother Gabriel again or or the Saints that have passed on here brother dick and some of the Saints that's not a consolation is it but what a great consolation it is amen amen that we are going to see them and they're not going to be in the same condition that they went down in amen they're gonna be they're gonna be young they're gonna be they're gonna be happy they're going to they're not gonna have gray hair or not even that all right what a what a wonderful thing it is to think amen you know that that even Jesus when he resurrected amen the the the gardener amen uh they I mean the the Mary didn't even didn't even think that that was Jesus he thought that she she thought that that was one of the gardeners or one of the area the the man tending the garden there because he had got he had come back so so in such a young looking State again she didn't even think that that was Jesus Jesus worked so hard in in in in his lifetime and and did so much his body almost was wasted and and and almost older looking than what he was than what he really was right now can you imagine when they were when they were hitting him and spitting on him and yanking beard and all that stuff amen how much more he even looked amen the the the The Passion of the Christ didn't do that Justice although it came close but it didn't it didn't it didn't do amen justice of what Jesus really looked like his ribs showing and all kinds of things but when he came back and resurrected from that grave amen even Mary didn't even recognize who he was and then can you imagine amen that the resurrection of the Saints amen and they're walking amongst us amen maybe we brush right by him and we don't even know that's that's one of them and they'll say brother Louise yeah huh I don't know I'm just wanting it so bad amen I don't know how it'll happen amen rushing right there around my brother who are you or maybe we will know exactly amen but I mean we will know that it's our loved ones amen we definitely know you just you just ever stop to think of how it all happened it's it's it's amazing to even think about amen I'm gonna let you all go here I'll start rambling here in just a moment I hope you're enjoying the word I'm I'm just reading the word then they also which are falling asleep in Christ or Parish verse 19. in this life and we'll stop here at verse 20 in this life only we have hope in Christ we are all okay so he's saying if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all man most miserable and if we can't take the same Christ that we have obtained here in this life on the other life on the other side and we're just very miserable is what Paul is saying amen in other words he says here if our hope in Christ is good only for this life we are worse off than anyone else yeah verse 20 but now now I like that but now I like I like that that that that that that word amen that it's not a conjunction I think it's a conjunction I don't know what what the word bud is but but now amen so if something was a certain way then amen but now there's a change right but now is Christ risen from the dead amen when are you the sons of God now are you the sons of God why because now is Christ risen from the dead and become and become the first fruits of them that slept amen praise the Lord Jesus so he is the the the the head the head of the body right and wherever the body goes the wherever the the head goes the body follows praise the Lord so if he resurrected from the dead nothing could stop him death hell on the grave amen couldn't stop couldn't stop God amen but he had to overcome he had to face death he had to face hell and he had to face the grave in order to overcome them and it's the same thing with you and I Saints amen we have to face dangers we have to face hardships we have to face problems in order for us to come out Overcomers on the other side amen the Christian life isn't easy and I know that you all can say Amen to that it's not easy it's it's it's it's a hardship amen but Christ has made it easy for us in the sense amen that we can put our burdens upon him we don't have to carry those burdens on us anymore young people you don't have to carry your yours your sins and and the and and your condemnation upon you amen just lay them out on Christ lay them down on him and say Lord you change me I Can't Change Myself and I can't I'm trying Lord I'm trying to give up this in my life I'm trying to do stop this in my life but I can't amen just lay it down upon him upon his cross and he can do it for you amen we got lots of witnesses here that that's happened to amen Brother Don you let go of cigarettes he did amen many of us amen we've we've we've let go of things that have burdened us in our life amen you don't have to carry those things in your life anymore to feel better I'm scared I don't know what to do I want to serve the Lord but at the same time I don't I'm I'm I'm all caught in between what's keeping you everything that that in this life will perish the only thing that won't perish is Christ amen eternal life do you want to have eternal life or do you want to have temporary life this this this life right here amen the life of Christian's life is only a shadow of really what it what true life is we're just living a shadow right now yeah man the Bible calls it the earnest of our inheritance amen the down payment and if and if this this is glorious amen when you give all those things to Christ amen it's glorious to be unburdened how much more I meant to be unburdened of this body then of this of this of this old of wrinkles and gray hair why are you laughing brother [Laughter] and and well I I don't I'm getting a few gray hairs here and there but but uh but you know Saints uh it's a glorious thing to know that this isn't the only thing we have to be waiting for amen we have something to say man
