[8:02] straight all right if you like turn in
[8:04] your scriptures turn where we've been
[8:06] reading from hebrews 11
[8:08] and we'll try to get right on into our
[8:10] thought
[8:11] and carry it on
[8:13] for the time
[8:14] you know because we're trying to speak a
[8:17] little bit from the book of hebrews
[8:19] and pray that the lord would help each
[8:20] one of you and bless each one father we
[8:23] thank you for this day and we pray that
[8:25] you would just guide each and every one
[8:27] of us in your loving understanding
[8:29] that father you may be the one that
[8:31] would have the preeminence in our hearts
[8:32] and our lives
[8:34] we know there's many sicknesses among us
[8:36] and you said you sent your word and
[8:38] healed us
[8:39] and delivered us from destruction we
[8:41] know you've done this and we praise your
[8:44] great name and we just ask you to make
[8:46] it come into a manifestation
[8:48] into the hearts and the lives of the
[8:50] people
[8:51] because we believe you and we commit it
[8:53] all to you now remember those that are
[8:55] not here the way lord and and things we
[8:59] just ask you to help each and every one
[9:01] we love you
[9:02] forgive our sins cleanse us from all
[9:05] unrighteousness and keep us in jesus
[9:07] christ
[9:09] amen
[9:10] hebrews 11 now we've been reading this
[9:14] for quite a while so everybody ought to
[9:16] be able to to do
[9:18] all right yep bible study will be coming
[9:21] this this coming saturday this coming
[9:23] saturday bible study remember that six
[9:26] o'clock here at the church come and be
[9:28] with us
[9:29] we've actually got over in
[9:31] three
[9:32] three months i think we've covered
[9:35] nine verses in the book of romans so
[9:37] we're doing you know we're real real
[9:39] good we're kind of slowing just having a
[9:41] good time
[9:42] and there are available
[9:44] to you that would like but you have to
[9:47] request
[9:48] it's not just something sticking up
[9:49] somewhere you're going to have to
[9:51] request
[9:52] from brother joe
[9:54] to be able to
[9:56] get you the copy of the
[9:58] bible study but we do make those also
[10:04] chapter 11 verse 1. now faith is the
[10:06] substance of things hoped for
[10:08] the evidence of things not seen for by
[10:11] it the elders obtained a good report
[10:13] through faith we understand that the
[10:15] worlds were framed by the word of god so
[10:18] that things which are seen
[10:20] were not made of things which do appear
[10:23] now here's what we'll be trying to get
[10:25] in today verse 4.
[10:26] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[10:29] excellent sacrifice and came
[10:32] by which he obtained witness that he was
[10:34] righteous
[10:35] god testifying of his gifts
[10:39] and by it
[10:40] he being dead yet
[10:42] speaketh you may be seated lord add his
[10:45] blessing to the reading of the word
[10:49] now
[10:50] i hope you will
[10:52] if you wasn't here wednesday
[10:54] and heard the wednesday night services i
[10:57] pray that you would
[10:58] listen to that i thought we'd done a
[11:00] real marvelous job speaking on
[11:03] abraham
[11:05] and his faith and how it's connected to
[11:08] us
[11:09] because that's what we're doing here in
[11:10] hebrews we're going to go through these
[11:14] warriors of faith now
[11:16] dropping down
[11:17] and as we do we're going to try to
[11:19] relate
[11:20] that
[11:21] to where we're at
[11:23] because what good is it to
[11:26] talk about
[11:27] abraham
[11:29] and look at him as so great and then
[11:30] look at ourselves as so small you know
[11:33] or whatever so we must see that they
[11:36] were only speaking
[11:38] of us
[11:39] in this day so that's our point what
[11:42] we're trying to do all right and we've
[11:44] talked about faith just as a little bit
[11:46] to the
[11:47] the visitors and the
[11:49] you know the others that haven't been
[11:51] with us
[11:54] you remember how we done we took the
[11:56] definition of the word faith
[11:59] and we looked it up in the
[12:02] bible concordance the strong's
[12:04] concordance you know to get the
[12:05] definition
[12:06] and uh then we looked up in webster but
[12:10] that definition does not give a clear
[12:13] understanding
[12:15] of what really the word faith
[12:17] means because
[12:20] when you're looking it up like that
[12:21] you're looking at it like well there's a
[12:24] baptist faith there's a methodist faith
[12:26] there's a presbyterian faith there's you
[12:28] know and really it means in those
[12:30] definitions it means like a doctrine
[12:33] or a thought or an issue or a point you
[12:36] know as to the word faith
[12:38] all right
[12:39] but that doesn't really clear up to me
[12:42] what
[12:43] uh we are trying to cover because we
[12:46] covered you remember in verse 38 of the
[12:50] uh uh 10th chapter
[12:53] is the background
[12:56] for going into the 11th chapter
[12:58] and in that you'll find that paul says
[13:00] now the just shall live by faith
[13:04] right then he drops down to the 11th
[13:07] chapter and tells you what faith is
[13:11] so here is god's definition of the word
[13:14] faith not man's uh
[13:17] concordances man's ideas man's webster
[13:21] uh you know we've become educated uh
[13:24] idiots
[13:25] out of doing things but thank god for
[13:28] them we still use them
[13:29] but
[13:30] to try to see you know the correct way
[13:32] of understanding so paul says see by his
[13:36] own revelation
[13:39] he said faith
[13:41] is the substance
[13:44] he doesn't make it a doctrine an idea or
[13:46] a concept or a belief or you know
[13:50] he makes it
[13:51] what it is faith is the substance
[13:56] of what anything consists of
[13:59] all
[14:00] right then we read and we covered
[14:04] the past few services are talking about
[14:08] see by or through faith verse 3 we
[14:11] understand the worlds were framed
[14:14] so that's not just a doctrine or a
[14:16] thought or concept because
[14:18] uh science can tell you how the world
[14:20] was framed
[14:22] you know but their way is that it's some
[14:25] kind of a big bang theory which is fine
[14:28] are doings but uh you know
[14:30] it doesn't bring a clear understanding i
[14:33] hope that's the point you've gained from
[14:36] my constantly speaking
[14:38] about faith
[14:39] is the substance and is is present tense
[14:43] it's not past or future it means present
[14:46] tense
[14:47] um
[14:47] and all right then in that
[14:50] we're talking about our understanding
[14:54] of what they're understanding
[14:57] right
[14:59] you know we're looking at our
[15:00] understanding from what they're
[15:02] understanding because see anybody's
[15:05] before you like the scripture says they
[15:07] done those things that old testament
[15:09] especially those things were done for
[15:12] our example
[15:15] all right
[15:16] see they they they spoke they done they
[15:19] lived they're acted out their lives as
[15:21] an example
[15:22] to you and i
[15:24] that we could look to that and see
[15:27] what's going on now
[15:29] all right
[15:30] so then we can as i said we can talk
[15:32] about definitions of words but the best
[15:35] thing is to see that
[15:37] faith is the substance
[15:39] so whatever the world consists of
[15:43] you know the worlds as it's called there
[15:45] because it's many planets many things
[15:49] and then you've got the worlds that are
[15:50] known the unknown the different ones
[15:52] but in doing those things
[15:55] we see that it had to come from
[15:57] somewhere
[15:59] all right now whatever you want to do
[16:01] with your doings of scientific knowledge
[16:05] and saying well this is this and this is
[16:07] that it still had to have a creator
[16:11] irregardless of what
[16:13] you come up with
[16:15] uh whatever how you address it uh if you
[16:18] want to make that us human beings on the
[16:20] evolution tree that we laid over on a
[16:24] pollywog laid over this away for a while
[16:26] and grown an arm and fell over another a
[16:27] couple of million years on the other
[16:29] side and growed another arm and then
[16:31] finally got an eyeball and finally but
[16:33] it still had to have a
[16:34] beginning where did the pollywog come
[16:37] from
[16:38] it still had to have a beginning so we
[16:40] go back to the word of god and see that
[16:42] it says the worlds were framed
[16:45] made
[16:46] you know we went back in genesis to read
[16:50] where it says
[16:51] in the beginning
[16:53] god created the heavens and the earth
[16:55] and there's a period it stops there
[16:57] that's not the first day of creation the
[16:59] first day of creation is verse three i
[17:01] think it is we went through
[17:03] you know because it said evening in the
[17:04] morning was the first day
[17:07] so then the world being billions of
[17:09] years old we have no problem with that
[17:12] that's a scientific fact
[17:14] the world being billions of years old
[17:16] because see in the beginning god created
[17:18] heaven and earth feared and just he let
[17:20] it lay there and let it go through
[17:21] different things he moved it around in
[17:23] space to make it to where that it would
[17:25] go through the ice ages and the things
[17:27] they can prove
[17:28] that happen
[17:30] and see that's in the bible then if we
[17:32] understand the bible
[17:33] and read it then we're we're not lost to
[17:35] try to destroy the or that's trying to
[17:38] destroy you know science or trying to
[17:40] make it this or that or the other we
[17:42] believe it
[17:44] but see then whatever the world consists
[17:46] of
[17:47] god had to speak it into being
[17:50] right
[17:51] i mean you would have to agree with that
[17:53] if you're going to believe in god
[17:55] and if you don't believe in god then
[17:56] you've got to believe you're greater
[17:57] than god so go ahead be an idiot
[18:01] you know that's the plainest language i
[18:02] can take and make and if we don't
[18:04] believe in god then we've we've got a
[18:06] problem we've got to believe in a
[18:08] creator
[18:09] because we are a creation
[18:12] and that requires a creator to come into
[18:15] being all right then moving along in
[18:17] those things
[18:18] we can see that what everything consists
[18:21] anything consists of
[18:23] it had to come into being
[18:27] all right and the worlds were framed how
[18:31] we just read verse 3 by the word of god
[18:36] all right
[18:37] the word of god brought into being all
[18:39] of the things that we see
[18:41] tangibles or whatever you want to make
[18:43] it you know it comes from the word of
[18:45] god so it comes from a substance
[18:48] greater than this substance
[18:51] right
[18:53] which is faith
[18:55] all right then science can go in and
[18:57] prove it and go on into the uh the
[19:00] things of
[19:01] of
[19:02] the supernatural almost to their being
[19:04] they're seeing
[19:06] and we can look at it by the word of god
[19:08] and see that how god done these things
[19:11] and in doing that then we come out to
[19:13] the basis of saying what
[19:15] faith is the substance
[19:19] all right
[19:20] we know that god is a covered last we
[19:22] know that god created the world all
[19:25] right
[19:26] then he started in verse three of
[19:29] genesis
[19:30] and day one
[19:32] he brought light into being day two he
[19:34] brought this day three you know finally
[19:36] coming up till day six and bringing man
[19:39] into existence
[19:41] and then resting on the seventh day
[19:44] in the garden all right
[19:46] so we've been through those things to
[19:48] talk about them
[19:49] and to see where it's doing but yet our
[19:52] mental thought is that when god created
[19:55] the world then he stopped creating
[19:58] all right
[19:59] he did because he's not creating more
[20:01] worlds
[20:03] but even science says of it if you want
[20:05] to go back and read it
[20:07] they say that we are a are a moving uh
[20:10] system of things and and that things are
[20:13] coming into being going on out beyond us
[20:15] into the to the
[20:17] you know almost into the eternities well
[20:20] you know because this clinker still may
[20:22] be slinging off with what we call the
[20:24] sun
[20:25] but remember we're not dumb we're not
[20:26] talking about the sun in the bases
[20:29] because there are universes of universes
[20:31] of universes that have their own sons
[20:34] and their own moons and their own stars
[20:35] and their own doings you know but we're
[20:38] sitting here where we believe that god
[20:40] chose to bring mankind
[20:43] because this is the part that he chose
[20:45] to do to come and bring this world into
[20:48] existence
[20:49] you know and then we don't care nothing
[20:51] about and forget all this about extra
[20:53] restaurant beings you better be worried
[20:56] about
[20:57] the beings here
[20:59] not something coming out of space
[21:02] because you find out one of these days
[21:03] those things coming out of space is when
[21:05] it comes out of here
[21:06] like i gave you the quote there which
[21:08] was amazing to me that we believe
[21:10] brother random was a prophet in 1955 he
[21:12] said russia had flying saucers
[21:16] well
[21:17] you know no problems with that
[21:20] you know
[21:21] they just take somebody and twist him up
[21:23] a little bit put him in a flying saucer
[21:24] if they shoot him down they think he's a
[21:25] monkey from outer space
[21:28] but it's funny how he speaks english
[21:30] that's always the point when people are
[21:32] contacted by these illegal aliens all
[21:35] right
[21:36] but getting to the point see because we
[21:37] believe this is the center of the
[21:39] universe i know that's the way i believe
[21:41] it
[21:42] because it's where god chose to to work
[21:44] from i don't care what's out there
[21:47] you can have your planet you can do what
[21:48] you want to with yours we just stay here
[21:50] on this and and god came down to this
[21:53] earth to dwell with us
[21:54] so this wonderful thing
[21:56] we have a great place to be
[21:58] all right then in the future home as we
[22:00] get on over to revelation 21 22 john
[22:03] sees it coming down out of heaven
[22:07] so then it'll be coming down to where we
[22:09] are
[22:10] all right so let's stay with us
[22:13] i like it here because god is with us he
[22:15] didn't stay somewhere else he came down
[22:17] to dwell with us
[22:19] all right
[22:20] then in getting that point in the
[22:22] thought that
[22:25] that we think though that well god's not
[22:28] creating anymore
[22:30] well
[22:32] i remember a prophet and that's what i
[22:33] was trying to do there wednesday
[22:35] or last weekend uh you remember moses he
[22:38] stood out there and called for flies and
[22:40] fleas and frogs
[22:43] so he must have created
[22:46] you know
[22:48] but maybe he's through creating but
[22:50] maybe he's not true with us
[22:55] you know what
[22:57] maybe he's and we're not going to go out
[22:59] and speak worlds into existence go live
[23:00] on them don't get in the garbage can
[23:02] stay where we're at
[23:04] whatever would be needful for the time
[23:06] then god can supply all right but we
[23:08] were trying to cover that god didn't
[23:11] stop creating because all at once he
[23:13] comes down and he creates in the wound
[23:15] of a virgin mary
[23:16] a body
[23:18] to come and live in
[23:19] so he's not through creating
[23:22] hebrews 10 5 he created his own body to
[23:24] come to live in so he's not he's not
[23:26] through creating all right
[23:28] now but in doing that too
[23:32] he started on the day of pentecost
[23:34] creating a bridegroom
[23:37] called the bride the church
[23:39] so he's not through creating
[23:42] we just try to limit him
[23:46] then we doubt him being able to speak
[23:48] through moses
[23:50] flies for these frogs etc those things
[23:54] not if they wasn't already there he just
[23:56] multiplied them through moses's mouth
[23:58] but yet they were a creation
[24:01] all right
[24:02] now
[24:03] then like the prophet of god said why
[24:05] would we stumble at the blood of jesus
[24:06] christ
[24:08] see if that could be done under moses
[24:10] and the blood of bulls and goats why
[24:11] would you stumble under the blood of
[24:13] jesus christ
[24:16] i believe limbs can be restored
[24:20] i don't think
[24:21] that we're going up in the rapture and
[24:23] i've got to have a crutch
[24:25] and i'm going to be missing a lag you
[24:27] know
[24:28] i don't believe that
[24:31] i believe we're going to have a change
[24:34] all right
[24:36] we don't believe in getting a new body
[24:37] because why get a new body where would
[24:39] you get it from
[24:41] jesus had nail prints in his hands why
[24:43] don't we want to depend upon what's real
[24:46] that's my whole point
[24:48] he had nail prints in his hands and no
[24:50] problem to show them after his
[24:51] resurrection
[24:53] all right but we're not going to be old
[24:54] dilapidated worn out men neither women
[24:57] we're going to be back in the prime of
[24:59] youth
[25:01] to live
[25:02] eternity
[25:03] you know
[25:05] in a beautiful wonderful state all right
[25:07] so then god's not through creating
[25:10] that's the point
[25:11] that i'm trying to get you to see
[25:15] he's not true creating
[25:18] so let's don't limit him
[25:20] as to our thinking
[25:24] you know what you can limit all you want
[25:26] to he's still going to do it
[25:28] why don't you get up in the morning and
[25:29] tell the sun not to rise
[25:32] you know
[25:36] but you know if god ever told you to
[25:39] because joshua one day told the sun to
[25:41] stand still
[25:42] and it did
[25:44] why can't we believe it that's in your
[25:46] bible
[25:48] why can't we believe in
[25:51] an eternal god
[25:54] who's trying his best to reveal himself
[25:57] to mankind
[26:00] and he does it through his creation
[26:02] and then he takes those back there in
[26:05] his creation
[26:06] that's where we're getting to today
[26:08] and he takes those people as i said a
[26:10] moment ago and he makes them an example
[26:14] and they're there for a reason
[26:17] to be an example to you and i
[26:20] oh if i could just be back there when
[26:23] moses has done this that or the other i
[26:25] don't want to be back there
[26:29] oh if i could just be back there when
[26:31] jesus
[26:32] walked on the shores of galilee i don't
[26:34] want to be back there
[26:38] i'd rather be here
[26:40] right
[26:41] in the most horrible situations of life
[26:43] i'd still rather be here than to be back
[26:45] there
[26:47] i kind of like our conditions and cars
[26:49] riding up down the road don't you i
[26:52] don't want to go back to mules and
[26:53] wagons i've spent my days in that
[26:58] i want to be
[27:00] where that god is
[27:04] all right and remember we'll get back to
[27:07] it in a little bit in the message maybe
[27:08] where he gets down to about verse six of
[27:11] hebrews and he speaks that it's
[27:13] impossible for us to please god
[27:17] unless we have this faith which is a
[27:19] substance
[27:22] you see the only way to have you
[27:23] remember we covered it in the sixth
[27:25] sense message talking about it where you
[27:28] have five senses to contact the earthly
[27:30] world which you see taste field smell in
[27:32] here but then you have a sixth sense
[27:34] which is by the baptism of the holy
[27:36] ghost
[27:37] coming and living in our hearts
[27:40] and by that sixth sense we can have a
[27:41] contact
[27:44] with the eternities because eternal life
[27:46] comes and dwells in us by the new birth
[27:49] all right
[27:50] now in doing that then we'll get to our
[27:52] point now
[27:53] we read in verse two we'll use this
[27:56] every service for a while
[27:58] like we do the other so
[28:00] you know verse 2 it says
[28:06] for by it which is talking about faith
[28:09] the elders obtained a good report
[28:14] all right
[28:15] so then we're going to take these down
[28:17] through
[28:18] uh
[28:19] abel
[28:20] you know
[28:21] enoch
[28:23] noah et cetera abraham and we're going
[28:26] to talk about them and their report that
[28:28] they made but remember the report that
[28:31] they made
[28:32] is the example for you and i
[28:37] they lived their lives out for an
[28:38] example for you and i
[28:41] all right
[28:42] so then that way we can look at their
[28:44] example
[28:46] and believe what god is to be here
[28:48] then
[28:49] why look back and say i wish i was back
[28:52] there
[28:55] all right
[28:57] which he was listening other day to the
[28:59] prophet he said
[29:00] why would we want to look back
[29:03] he said because
[29:05] he's the same yesterday today and
[29:07] forever
[29:09] but do we believe that
[29:11] do we believe hebrews 13 8
[29:14] oh we believe john 3 16 about you get
[29:16] born again don't we but do we believe
[29:18] hebrews 13 8
[29:20] that he's the same yesterday today and
[29:24] forever
[29:29] that is malachi 3 he said i'm god and i
[29:31] changed not
[29:33] all right so we don't have to worry
[29:35] about it
[29:37] all right
[29:38] now getting to that point then
[29:41] let's look at their lives but bring it
[29:43] up and see where we're at
[29:48] because faith is a substance
[29:52] all right
[29:54] see if you're prayed for and god heals
[29:56] you
[29:57] it took a creative act of god right
[30:01] you break an arm what do you do doctor
[30:03] puts it back together he can't heal it
[30:06] there is no such thing in medical
[30:08] science of creating life
[30:09] they do the closest they can to it on a
[30:11] lot of things but they cannot create
[30:13] life
[30:14] but they can
[30:15] put together put it out show it up cut
[30:18] it out do whatever
[30:20] but it takes god to create those sales
[30:23] to bring all of that back together you
[30:25] understand me
[30:26] all right so god is not through creating
[30:33] come on
[30:34] break it down to where we're at where
[30:35] we're living
[30:36] see we're
[30:37] we've got our mind the way out under or
[30:39] way back there
[30:41] instead of looking at the realities of
[30:42] what life is now
[30:48] you realize what i was just saying that
[30:50] a bone could be broken you pull it out
[30:52] put it back together wonderful
[30:54] put splints on it do everything we can
[30:57] but you can't heal that
[31:00] it takes a creation of life
[31:03] to heal that back together
[31:05] all right
[31:07] then is there any different for god to
[31:09] where
[31:10] he heals a bone and it comes together or
[31:12] the thing is thought off and god wants
[31:14] to put it back
[31:18] oh we don't go that far
[31:21] right
[31:23] why not
[31:26] are you going to limit god
[31:27] you are
[31:29] you're limiting him to the basis that he
[31:30] can't do it because of your unbelief
[31:34] remember that's the only thing god can't
[31:35] get over is our unbelief
[31:38] but don't worry about it he'll just move
[31:40] around you somebody else as i said go
[31:42] out there and tell her son not to come
[31:43] up in the morning at least come right on
[31:45] up he just bypasses go right on
[31:49] but you see the prophet said there'll
[31:51] come a time when limbs will be restored
[31:55] where's that coming from
[31:59] a creation
[32:01] i look at a baby
[32:03] i see a little baby come into the world
[32:07] and i thank god you're not true creating
[32:11] because that starts from a little bitty
[32:13] thing that cannot be seen
[32:19] right you know with a natural eye
[32:23] and develops into a human being
[32:33] living below our privilege is what i'm
[32:35] trying to get you to see
[32:37] but why can't we just believe it
[32:39] and god moving among us as he had we
[32:42] were talking about this the other day
[32:43] brother gary now
[32:44] that there's a lot of things god has
[32:46] been doing
[32:47] among us but we don't listen to it
[32:49] and look at it
[32:51] but i'm not going to stop
[32:55] i want to stop when we leave this earth
[32:58] in a change of these bodies
[33:01] that'll be the ultimate of healing
[33:05] is when these bodies are totally
[33:07] finished
[33:08] all right but you say well brother dale
[33:10] i'm just you just don't understand my
[33:12] problem no i don't understand your
[33:14] doubting
[33:17] is that strong enough i don't understand
[33:18] you're doubting why are you doubting
[33:20] you know what the prophet said called
[33:22] sister uh frida called me the other
[33:24] night and said
[33:25] she was dying with a headache or
[33:27] something
[33:28] shoulder aching
[33:30] she was hearing the church and the
[33:31] things just went away
[33:33] all right but a few days later it came
[33:35] back
[33:36] she called and we said a simple prayer
[33:39] lord go back and do what you've done the
[33:41] other night in the church that was way
[33:43] afraid and just bring back that healing
[33:46] to her
[33:47] we hung up the phone she walked in today
[33:49] said the minute we hung up the phone
[33:50] that hurt and stopped
[33:52] well
[33:55] you know what that should do that should
[33:57] show up throw everybody in the church
[33:59] into desperation to believe god
[34:01] come on
[34:04] you say well that just went away
[34:06] why don't you take it away
[34:09] i mean if it just went away you ought to
[34:10] know how to take it away
[34:13] yeah go down you can make a lot of money
[34:16] right
[34:17] put it on the internet you can take away
[34:18] headaches
[34:20] go ahead you get multiple rich
[34:22] you know
[34:24] yeah i'm not trying to make it silly i'm
[34:25] trying to make it straight
[34:28] see we want to prop up things
[34:31] and and do things that were you know
[34:34] of doings but now let's get into the
[34:36] thought today
[34:38] that we read it says
[34:41] by faith
[34:43] by revelation
[34:45] is that what abel had
[34:49] it was revealed to abel
[34:52] what happened in the garden
[34:55] all right
[34:58] now
[34:59] and as it was revealed to him
[35:02] he offered unto god
[35:05] a more excellent sacrifice than cain
[35:08] by which he obtained witness that he was
[35:10] righteous
[35:11] god testifying of his gifts
[35:14] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[35:19] a lot to cover there
[35:21] by faith abel offered unto god
[35:24] a more excellent
[35:28] sacrifice
[35:31] now
[35:31] first i want to get this out of the way
[35:34] there is a lot of arguments and a lot of
[35:36] contradictory points of saying that
[35:40] it was more excellent than cain so cain
[35:43] offered an excellent one and abel
[35:45] offered a more excellent one you've
[35:47] heard that preached
[35:48] that's all right that's your business
[35:51] but
[35:52] what i want you to think about
[35:56] abel by faith
[35:59] offered a sacrifice
[36:03] the blood of an animal
[36:06] because he knew
[36:08] why they were in the problem they were
[36:10] in right
[36:14] but why did cain offer
[36:17] flowers
[36:18] fruit
[36:20] etc
[36:24] i hope you can see this point
[36:26] abram offered a sacrifice
[36:28] cain was trying to appease
[36:32] a lot of difference in trying to appease
[36:34] god and a sacrifice to take care of it
[36:40] see people today they build beautiful
[36:41] churches and have wonderful offerings
[36:43] they have great things they're doing a
[36:44] lot of work around the world and they're
[36:46] they're sending billions of dollars
[36:48] around the world thank god for all of it
[36:50] you know and and helping the sick and
[36:52] the people and all of the things
[36:54] wonderful
[36:57] but where's their sacrifice
[37:00] that's no more than appeasement
[37:03] see cain was not trying to
[37:06] offer an offering
[37:08] a sacrifice
[37:10] he was trying to appease god
[37:14] because he didn't believe what abel said
[37:17] is that what it says in genesis
[37:21] is it right that during genesis you had
[37:23] cain and abel the first two boys
[37:28] and they come up to a time which meant
[37:30] they were up in their at least
[37:32] maybe 20 years of age or something
[37:34] they had been there quite a while in the
[37:36] garden that's my point
[37:38] and as it did they came to a time that
[37:40] they offered sacrifices
[37:43] all right
[37:45] well
[37:46] abel
[37:47] he offered the blood of a
[37:51] lamb
[37:54] right
[37:59] a lazy
[38:00] shitless
[38:05] come on
[38:07] he surely had a revelation of what's
[38:08] going on
[38:09] or if not he was laying back in the
[38:11] woods somewhere waiting on the lamb to
[38:12] get old enough to go out and kill it
[38:14] whereas abel were i mean a cane he was
[38:16] up working like crazy because he called
[38:18] him a tiller of the soil
[38:21] right
[38:24] abel was a keeper of sheep
[38:26] so look like cain's offering should have
[38:28] been accepted
[38:32] right
[38:34] he worked himself to death to do or
[38:36] either went out and at least gathered
[38:39] enable all he's doing and just wait
[38:40] until the lamb gets right goes out picks
[38:42] one out of the crowd takes it up
[38:44] cuts his throat burns it as an offering
[38:51] as he does cain he gets all upset
[38:54] because god you remember in genesis do
[38:57] we need to read it
[38:59] that
[39:01] god come to
[39:02] cain and said cain
[39:06] why are you upset
[39:12] you
[39:12] know why are you upset about
[39:15] me accepting abel's sacrifice
[39:23] he said now you go do just paraphrasing
[39:25] it but read your scripture
[39:27] it tells it you go do as your brother
[39:30] done and i'll accept you
[39:34] so what it came to
[39:36] he said look i've worked i've worked
[39:38] abel is a lazy bum laid over there on
[39:40] the side and never done a bit of work to
[39:42] get nothing what he's doing lord i've at
[39:44] least worked myself to death for you
[39:47] right come on
[39:50] he said that's not written in the bible
[39:51] but
[39:53] we ought to be able to talk a little bit
[39:54] about playing common sense there was a
[39:56] conversation between god and cain
[40:01] right
[40:02] not no two words written down it was a
[40:03] conversation
[40:06] and god said look cain
[40:09] as your brother done
[40:11] and then your flowers will turn
[40:15] from an appeasement
[40:18] to a wonderful
[40:21] offering
[40:25] sure we know what cain's all spoke of he
[40:27] worked himself to death he was a good
[40:28] worker it was his good works
[40:32] but good works does not appease an angry
[40:34] god
[40:37] right
[40:39] when god says
[40:40] give a lamb you give a lamb
[40:45] what if moses would have come up and
[40:46] told levi levi i want you to get your
[40:49] beautiful we got all this ready we got
[40:51] everything made here in the temple we
[40:53] got everything we got all the rooms we
[40:55] got everything you go out and pull you
[40:56] some flowers and cure them in there
[41:02] i i don't think
[41:07] i don't think that's what moses told
[41:09] levi to you
[41:13] i don't think levi would went
[41:16] i wouldn't
[41:18] because i know that those things we're
[41:19] only trying to appease
[41:22] and you've got to have a sacrifice first
[41:25] all right
[41:27] that's why it says it cain you know
[41:29] they're able to offer them more
[41:30] excellent
[41:34] sure it was a sacrifice to cain to what
[41:36] he was doing
[41:39] but yet he was only trying to appease
[41:41] because he never followed god's plan
[41:45] god's plan was blood
[41:48] right
[41:52] now why couldn't cain remember
[41:57] that's my point
[41:59] you know cain was there around just as
[42:01] well as april was there
[42:03] right
[42:05] i mean like i say that maybe it was 20
[42:07] years of age but it's given a number
[42:08] might have been 40 50. you know back in
[42:10] the old testament there was a lot of age
[42:12] before even had kids got to say some of
[42:13] them was 150 years old before they had
[42:15] any kids
[42:18] well i don't think it works today
[42:20] you know
[42:22] even test you
[42:23] problems with that
[42:26] but
[42:28] my point he was there with him
[42:33] right
[42:35] and he could look around
[42:39] and he could see
[42:41] that they were wearing clothes
[42:43] made from skins
[42:47] they didn't have walmart
[42:49] okay
[42:50] they didn't have walmart back there
[42:53] so they had to make their clothes
[42:57] and it made them out of the skins of the
[42:58] animals right
[43:02] you remember eve thought it worked with
[43:04] fig leaves
[43:07] she kind of made her a dress didn't she
[43:09] had a thick leaves that didn't work
[43:13] don't you think my point is don't you
[43:15] think that cain
[43:16] knew the story
[43:22] let's don't be blind let's don't be
[43:24] something that which you know
[43:27] cain was i just as well as abel
[43:32] maybe
[43:33] maybe adam and eve didn't explain to him
[43:40] but i think i'd be a bad mom and daddy
[43:44] you can think what you want to
[43:46] if adam was the son of god even a fallen
[43:49] estate
[43:50] i think he still was holding on along
[43:53] to worship and believing god don't you
[44:03] but what happens
[44:06] cain gets his own idea
[44:09] come on in brothers
[44:11] sister
[44:13] welcome
[44:17] so abel
[44:19] he's not in a position to uh
[44:24] have a seniority
[44:26] he was really the younger supposed to be
[44:29] cain was supposed to be first
[44:32] all right
[44:34] you understand my point cain and abel
[44:37] both in the garden
[44:38] both living at the edge of the garden
[44:41] both living there
[44:44] both looking at all of the things
[44:46] both knowing that they could not proceed
[44:49] beyond one point
[44:52] because they were flaming swords whether
[44:54] they were visible or invisible they
[44:57] still didn't walk back in the garden
[44:58] right
[45:00] abel never walked back in the garden
[45:04] it wasn't able walked in and hey look i
[45:07] mean
[45:08] no no no no
[45:09] neither one of them could go back in
[45:12] they knew it was death to pass that one
[45:14] place all right if he explained death to
[45:16] pass that place
[45:19] don't you think that
[45:21] at least adam and eve talked a little
[45:23] bit over a 20-year period
[45:26] for the boys to get old enough to at
[45:28] least offer a sacrifice
[45:30] i just made it 20 years as a point of
[45:32] interest
[45:34] because it did come up that they were to
[45:35] make their own sacrifices
[45:39] so they must have had a little time
[45:42] all right
[45:44] but here comes
[45:46] abel
[45:48] and i said well ago
[45:50] lazy bum lays out there and lets him
[45:52] sheep eat all he wants to
[45:54] because there wasn't a whole lot to
[45:55] bother him back then
[45:57] probably wasn't too many wolves around
[46:00] because you remember it right after the
[46:02] fall there
[46:03] you know
[46:07] and you're able i mean here's cain he
[46:08] just worked himself to death
[46:13] so we come up to time to make an
[46:15] offering
[46:17] and abel says all right
[46:21] i'm gonna offer they're sitting down
[46:23] talking you know make a story out of it
[46:25] they're sitting down talking and cain
[46:27] and abel's talking it over
[46:30] and there with no five minute
[46:31] conversation remember they had years to
[46:33] do it
[46:34] and they were talking about
[46:36] what to do
[46:38] and they came up with a way you know
[46:40] saying well we need to make an offering
[46:42] a sacrifice
[46:44] all right
[46:45] true
[46:47] and as their discussion goes on
[46:50] abel says
[46:52] to king say cain what are you going to
[46:53] do
[46:55] he said i'm going to gather the
[46:56] prettiest
[46:57] roses
[46:59] i'm going to get the prettiest
[47:00] pomegranates
[47:01] and all of these beautiful fruits and
[47:04] things
[47:05] and i'm going to
[47:07] lay them before that gate
[47:11] were the flaming swords at
[47:14] to try to appease
[47:16] an angry god because they knew they were
[47:18] in a state of god being angry at them
[47:20] right what's the purpose of making a
[47:22] sacrifice
[47:25] he says well abel what are you going to
[47:26] do he says i'm going to take one of
[47:27] these lambs i won't figure out the best
[47:29] one that don't have no marks or not no
[47:31] and i'm going to take him up here i'm
[47:32] going to kill him i'm going to burn him
[47:33] right there in front of place
[47:38] come on
[47:40] if we didn't know the story
[47:42] and you'd listening to me tell the story
[47:44] then we would be on cain's side
[47:48] right
[47:49] because of his works and his doings and
[47:52] that's what he symbolically was speaking
[47:53] of
[47:55] and works is wonderful
[47:57] after you're born again
[47:59] they are expected after you're born
[48:01] again
[48:04] but works before you're born again won't
[48:06] bring you nothing
[48:10] come on
[48:13] remember jesus was the one that said it
[48:15] one day he said there's nothing good no
[48:17] not one
[48:20] where was the immortal being that would
[48:22] have an opportunity to go back in the
[48:23] garden
[48:28] right
[48:30] there was no way to get back in there
[48:33] but there come a time that they realize
[48:35] they must make an offering to god
[48:38] so abel takes a lamb and he kills it
[48:44] maybe a few years they had sat down and
[48:46] discussed this situation of what they
[48:48] were going to do
[48:54] don't look at cain as a
[48:57] uh
[48:58] hateful arrogant
[48:59] uh unbeliever uh
[49:02] someone who does not believe in god
[49:06] he was trying to make an offering
[49:11] to appease his god
[49:13] because he realized the angry skies the
[49:16] things that were you know
[49:19] taking place the animals eating each
[49:21] other and then wind up eating the
[49:23] animals by this time
[49:25] you know
[49:30] and abel
[49:33] he says cain
[49:34] but can't you see
[49:38] that we got to offer blood
[49:42] said because
[49:44] we were born
[49:46] in our mother from our mother
[49:49] and blood comes forth
[49:52] and said we were born in her blood from
[49:54] daddy's blood
[50:01] it was revealed to abel right
[50:05] but how much does it take beating you on
[50:07] the head to find out if revelations
[50:08] right
[50:11] right
[50:15] i mean somebody lays out the story to
[50:17] you that what happened in the garden had
[50:19] to be blood
[50:24] don't you think abel could remember to
[50:26] say
[50:28] cain
[50:29] don't you remember the stories daddy
[50:31] told us
[50:33] of how that once him and mama done wrong
[50:41] said god
[50:43] killed those animals
[50:46] and took the skins off of them so you
[50:48] don't want to believe that
[50:52] i sit and look at you when i talk like
[50:54] that
[50:55] but you don't want to believe that god
[50:57] took the skins off those animals because
[50:59] you don't think he was strong enough to
[51:01] do it you don't think he was real enough
[51:03] to do it you don't think that he was you
[51:05] think he was a spirit
[51:10] you want to stay with the old baptist
[51:12] god is a spirit
[51:17] amen that's right
[51:19] but he stripped him animal skins off
[51:23] and give them to adam and eve to put on
[51:27] and he didn't drive and tanned them
[51:31] you've heard your prophet talk about
[51:32] when they were walking out of the garden
[51:34] that those bloody skins flopping on
[51:36] their legs but he said god was satisfied
[51:40] right
[51:42] god was the first one to offer an animal
[51:45] but you don't think god's that real you
[51:47] think he's some spirit or some spook or
[51:49] something
[51:51] remember the point of what i've been at
[51:52] for the longest faith is the substance
[51:57] so then god has to be greater than any
[51:59] substance there is because he created
[52:01] the substance
[52:02] if there's a creation there's got to be
[52:04] a creator the creator is greater than
[52:07] the creation don't make us greater than
[52:09] him
[52:11] don't make us to be something that he's
[52:13] a peanut something that we control him
[52:20] you remember me telling you about that
[52:22] man said he wouldn't
[52:24] he wasn't working on commanding the lord
[52:26] anymore said he's working on commanding
[52:27] the devil
[52:29] i mean excuse me he wasn't working on
[52:30] commander the devil to work on
[52:32] commanding the lord because the bible
[52:33] said command you me
[52:35] i said man you sure are messed up
[52:38] you mean you're going to command god
[52:39] that's what the bible says i'm going to
[52:41] command god i said it doesn't mean that
[52:43] way it means to take him at his word
[52:47] and he'll do what he said
[52:49] not to command him that he's got to go
[52:51] do it
[52:52] don't pray a prayer that god you've got
[52:54] to do this you've got to do that
[52:59] but you see abel
[53:03] i'd like to make it so strong until i
[53:05] wish i could but
[53:08] was able a different type of a person or
[53:11] different something
[53:13] or were they just two boys
[53:15] two men
[53:17] you know
[53:22] i mean cain what no mean arrogant guy
[53:27] he became that because
[53:29] that god turned down his
[53:32] flowery beautiful offering
[53:35] but remember like i said abel had a
[53:37] revelation it was blood was born in
[53:39] mama's blood from daddy's blood and
[53:41] blood was what the animals was offered
[53:43] when they come out of the garden god
[53:45] offered them animal skins and scepted
[53:47] the blood in the place of mankind and
[53:50] didn't destroy adam and eve
[53:56] right
[54:01] you see we could spend a lot of time
[54:02] talking about how bad kane was and what
[54:04] will energy come from but what good is
[54:06] to talk about that
[54:08] talk about the reality of what it is
[54:14] then you look around the world today and
[54:15] you see the religious system as i was
[54:17] talking about a while ago beautiful
[54:18] church his wonderful offering sending
[54:20] money everywhere sending people sending
[54:22] out doctors sending out all things to
[54:24] help people
[54:26] right that's wonderful
[54:28] but where's their offering before god
[54:33] well now lord we're doing this
[54:36] you ain't never heard anybody say
[54:38] because there was one man one time laid
[54:40] out in the field and said god way back
[54:43] under hundreds of years ago and said god
[54:45] if you don't give me the holy ghost
[54:46] you'll find a pile of bones
[54:49] right here in this field
[54:51] you ain't never heard that used god
[54:53] knows i want the holy ghost and if he
[54:55] don't give it to me it's his fault
[54:58] because i want it
[55:04] see we're still in that religious
[55:05] society
[55:07] because that's what that was back there
[55:10] a religious society on both sides
[55:13] kang wasn't a horrible dirty he was
[55:16] trying to
[55:20] get on the good side with his god
[55:24] right
[55:27] but as i said well ago what'd he do he
[55:29] offered the fruits of the land that he
[55:30] worked for
[55:32] he was trying to appease god
[55:36] he should have listened to abel because
[55:38] abel was one with the common sense cain
[55:40] couldn't take what he saw
[55:43] because you know what cain would have
[55:44] been saying
[55:47] come on you don't ever think
[55:52] we can follow abel coming down and still
[55:54] able to realize that mama and daddy
[55:56] blood caused the problem the animals had
[55:58] to be killed it come on down and then he
[56:00] could see
[56:05] it's not written about all the children
[56:06] in the bible
[56:09] i'll just leave that for you to think
[56:11] but listen
[56:14] you can follow that all the way back but
[56:16] follow the fruit back
[56:19] whatever you want to make it apples
[56:20] orange pomegranates peaches or whatever
[56:22] that you say eve eat an apple
[56:27] come on we don't believe
[56:28] that no
[56:31] apples give you the belly ache
[56:34] they don't mor they don't demoralize you
[56:39] and eve said the beast said subdued me
[56:45] beguiled me defiled me
[56:49] but i'm not even trying to go back that
[56:50] far because there's no no need of it now
[56:53] if people don't understand it or sitting
[56:54] here especially then you're in bad shape
[56:56] and anybody that don't understand this
[56:57] height for their services you come into
[56:59] office we'd be glad to talk about what
[57:00] happened in the garden
[57:04] some of you shaking your head so you
[57:06] evidently know what it is you probably
[57:08] heard it
[57:10] it wouldn't know apple and orange that
[57:12] brought them out of the garden
[57:15] all right
[57:17] but see what about it follow you take
[57:18] your fruit come on
[57:20] take your good works i've explained the
[57:23] best i can he said he offered a more
[57:25] excellent sacrifice
[57:27] meaning that
[57:28] cain's offering would have been fine
[57:31] if he had offered the blood first
[57:35] then he would have been putting his life
[57:37] works behind his
[57:41] sacrifice but he had no sacrifice he had
[57:44] an offering
[57:48] you understand it he had an offering he
[57:50] didn't have a sacrifice abel had to
[57:52] sacrifice
[57:56] and they're able was trying to explain
[57:58] it to his brother
[58:01] and you know that god even comes down
[58:02] after that he
[58:05] you know we don't want to think about
[58:06] god talking to dirty people
[58:09] right
[58:12] we don't want to think of a god that
[58:14] comes down and talks to people that are
[58:15] in sin
[58:17] well let me solve that problem in a
[58:19] hurry where did you come from
[58:23] did you get it
[58:25] you garbage can because that's what we
[58:27] all were
[58:30] god come to you didn't he
[58:33] was your sweet loving thy sweet little
[58:35] person you were just through you were so
[58:37] so good that god saved you because he
[58:38] was good
[58:40] good for nothing
[58:44] good for nothing is the best way to put
[58:45] it
[58:48] but you see
[58:51] take your flowers have you ever thought
[58:52] of it that way
[58:54] take your flowers take your fruits and
[58:57] go back
[58:58] to where the start in the fall was
[59:02] you know what you'd have
[59:05] you'll have adam and eve doing wrong
[59:07] and you had the god coming down and
[59:09] pulled a bunch of bouquets
[59:13] flowers
[59:15] right
[59:17] he would have laid up some oranges and
[59:19] some apples and something and he said
[59:21] okay y'all go ahead everything's all
[59:22] right because i'm accepting your
[59:24] sacrifice and with no sacrifice
[59:28] sacrifice deals with life
[59:32] you don't deal with your works
[59:34] works is supposed to be an outward
[59:36] manifestation of an inward work that has
[59:39] taken place in our hearts by the new
[59:41] birth
[59:46] right
[59:48] what does the bible say about our
[59:49] goodness our righteousness it says it's
[59:51] filthy rags in the sight of god that's
[59:54] what your bible says
[59:56] you don't believe in being good brother
[59:58] dale no
[1:00:01] i don't believe in being good
[1:00:04] i believe in being born again
[1:00:07] right
[1:00:08] oh yeah you take what i just say it now
[1:00:11] i believe in being born again
[1:00:13] and you start with a sacrifice
[1:00:15] then your works follows it and god comes
[1:00:19] down with a bouquet of roses because
[1:00:22] your life is a bouquet of roses before
[1:00:24] him and he comes down with a bouquet of
[1:00:26] roses to you because you've made the
[1:00:29] right atonement to start with
[1:00:33] and abel and cain listen to abel
[1:00:36] and even god read your bible
[1:00:39] if you'll do as your brother done you'll
[1:00:42] be accepted
[1:00:43] he had an opportunity oh we're so much
[1:00:46] serpent seed message people until you
[1:00:48] preach that cain didn't have no
[1:00:50] opportunity you go with your bible i got
[1:00:52] the quotes where the prophet said
[1:00:54] that he offered salvation to cain
[1:00:58] so you're going to deny brother brown's
[1:00:59] message and you're going to deny the
[1:01:00] bible
[1:01:02] go ahead and do what you want to
[1:01:04] i'm just trying to make the point clear
[1:01:06] to you
[1:01:10] because i can take what i stand here now
[1:01:13] and believe in the blood of jesus christ
[1:01:15] and follow it back through every one of
[1:01:17] these warriors of faith and go right
[1:01:19] back to the garden but you take your
[1:01:21] good works and father
[1:01:23] i want you to show me one in the bible
[1:01:25] that had any good works
[1:01:32] we will go to the story of the two in
[1:01:34] the
[1:01:34] prayer
[1:01:35] place right
[1:01:37] where one of them is standing there
[1:01:39] and he's saying lord
[1:01:41] look what i've done
[1:01:43] i've paid my tithe i've sacrificed i
[1:01:46] prayed every day i've done all of my
[1:01:48] doings and i ain't like him over there
[1:01:52] you remember that
[1:01:55] well you know he was right
[1:01:59] come on he was talking to god he was
[1:02:00] right
[1:02:02] but here's a man on the other side he
[1:02:04] said lord
[1:02:05] i ain't got nothing to offer you
[1:02:07] ain't never been nothing but a garbage
[1:02:08] can all week long but just forgive me
[1:02:12] forgive me lord
[1:02:14] who at home justified
[1:02:17] well because this man over here they
[1:02:19] said repentance he had an offering to go
[1:02:21] by
[1:02:22] i'm going to sacrifice this man over
[1:02:24] here had just an offering of his life
[1:02:27] and paul says that won't work before god
[1:02:31] you don't believe in being good no sir i
[1:02:33] believe in being born again and let god
[1:02:35] live in you and that's what paul said to
[1:02:37] life that i now live in the flesh i live
[1:02:39] by the faith of the son of god a mass
[1:02:42] murderer
[1:02:46] right
[1:02:47] was that who paul was
[1:02:50] serial killer
[1:02:52] right
[1:02:54] killing christians causing them to
[1:02:56] blaspheme
[1:02:59] show me his good life it brought god on
[1:03:01] the scene
[1:03:05] the only thing paul had was one thing in
[1:03:07] his heart
[1:03:08] he had a desire in his heart to find
[1:03:10] that jehovah god
[1:03:12] that he searched for all the days of his
[1:03:14] life
[1:03:16] right
[1:03:18] because he was a good person in in the
[1:03:20] points of of being according to the law
[1:03:25] but are you following me
[1:03:28] because my point is
[1:03:31] abel
[1:03:34] faith
[1:03:35] revelation
[1:03:36] brought a lamb into existence
[1:03:39] for him

[1:04:36] need to believe you need to accept but
[1:04:38] you know what she's doing just like we
[1:04:39] do yeah but lord brother branham you
[1:04:41] don't understand i've done so much wrong
[1:04:46] he said but he's looking through the
[1:04:47] blood
[1:04:48] he don't see you yeah but i don't see
[1:04:50] you get the message and listen to it
[1:04:54] it's a very short one
[1:04:56] if not run it on your computer it'll run
[1:04:58] up right there
[1:05:01] she was doing everything in the world
[1:05:02] and you know what when the testimony
[1:05:04] ends it still doesn't say she accepted
[1:05:09] my point is what
[1:05:11] are we in a religious society that's
[1:05:13] trying to appease an angry god
[1:05:16] are we born again christians
[1:05:18] who believe in the sacrifice that was
[1:05:20] made for us that we can go back with
[1:05:23] what we believe all the way to the
[1:05:25] garden
[1:05:27] and come out of there with the same
[1:05:28] blood atonement
[1:05:34] and be like abel that by faith
[1:05:42] you know what happened in the garden
[1:05:43] right
[1:05:44] god comes down as i said a moment ago
[1:05:46] he's talking to cain he said kane go
[1:05:48] back and do what your brother done and
[1:05:49] you'll be all right
[1:05:52] cain actually said i've done all i can
[1:05:54] do you want to quote from the prophet he
[1:05:56] said i've done all i can do take it or
[1:05:58] leave it
[1:06:01] he said that's what the religious
[1:06:02] society is saying today lord i've worked
[1:06:05] myself to death i've done all of these
[1:06:07] things and you've got to agree they're
[1:06:09] right
[1:06:10] he said now you take it or leave it
[1:06:15] see there's no blood because why not
[1:06:16] even now what is it they want the blood
[1:06:18] out of the songbook
[1:06:21] right
[1:06:22] oh don't talk about blood you're scared
[1:06:24] of people
[1:06:25] scare what
[1:06:29] talking about blood
[1:06:32] come on abel knew he was born in his
[1:06:34] mama's blood from his daddy's blood
[1:06:36] because he knew by then he was old
[1:06:38] enough to understand what took place in
[1:06:39] the garden
[1:06:44] came
[1:06:45] was blinded in his own doings
[1:06:50] right
[1:06:52] what else are you going to say
[1:06:54] was cain some kind of a different kind
[1:06:56] of a something
[1:06:58] an inhuman and human because his daddy
[1:07:00] was the beast
[1:07:04] no
[1:07:05] he was still offering sacrifices
[1:07:08] you know over there in israel right
[1:07:10] today on one side
[1:07:12] is the ones coming from ishmael and
[1:07:14] they're talking about one true and
[1:07:16] living god go over on the other side
[1:07:18] which is coming from
[1:07:20] ishmael
[1:07:22] or one of them's from isaac the other
[1:07:23] nice boy
[1:07:25] you know
[1:07:27] two different boys two different groups
[1:07:29] of nations both of them serving god
[1:07:33] if you can't see it folks you're blind
[1:07:35] as a bat come on
[1:07:39] i don't preach about governmental things
[1:07:40] and you know better than that because i
[1:07:42] generally stay away from it ain't none
[1:07:44] of my business
[1:07:46] but there are the israelites on one side
[1:07:49] oh yeah they're fighting for their
[1:07:51] country
[1:07:53] sure
[1:07:54] are
[1:07:56] but there's a
[1:07:59] group from kane coming down
[1:08:02] the moabites
[1:08:04] all of those over there
[1:08:06] coming from ishmael
[1:08:08] wow man
[1:08:10] they give them
[1:08:12] in 67 they give them
[1:08:14] the temple back
[1:08:17] they were a wiped out defeated people
[1:08:21] and israel to be nice gave them the
[1:08:23] temple back
[1:08:25] they run in the temple and said we
[1:08:26] defeated y'all we made y'all back off
[1:08:34] come on
[1:08:36] israel today i'm not against nations or
[1:08:38] for our nations
[1:08:40] them israelites are a
[1:08:42] arrogant bunch of little people but
[1:08:44] they're mean and hateful and they're
[1:08:45] fighting for their god-given right but
[1:08:47] you know what the ishmaelites are
[1:08:49] fighting for their god-given right
[1:08:51] read your bible like why we're talking
[1:08:52] about wednesday
[1:08:54] we want to throw out this like that
[1:08:57] through hagar came a promise
[1:08:59] that the ishmaelites would be
[1:09:02] rule the biggest portion of the world
[1:09:04] and they do
[1:09:07] but you can't appease them
[1:09:12] right
[1:09:14] they've done lost
[1:09:15] seven or 800 people
[1:09:19] right
[1:09:20] and israel's lost about 30.
[1:09:28] it's like i saw a guy on a movie said
[1:09:30] he's talking about the alamo and he was
[1:09:32] a hispanic mexican whatever the word
[1:09:34] y'all want to use i don't
[1:09:35] i don't play
[1:09:38] but you know what he said he said we
[1:09:40] defeated you at the alamo
[1:09:43] and they did
[1:09:46] right
[1:09:47] the hispanics the spanish or whatever
[1:09:49] the words are you they defeated the
[1:09:50] people at the alamo
[1:09:55] the guy said yeah he was 501. no wonder
[1:10:00] i said we defeated you in the next one
[1:10:02] and that ended it too
[1:10:06] right
[1:10:08] but you see you can't appease them
[1:10:10] canaanites
[1:10:14] you can give they could give them all of
[1:10:16] israel and they wouldn't stop
[1:10:20] you can't stop them people give them
[1:10:23] everything that they want and they're
[1:10:24] only going to take more
[1:10:26] because they're trying to make some form
[1:10:28] and then they say if you get killed in a
[1:10:30] war
[1:10:31] you get to go to heaven where you got 70
[1:10:33] virgins
[1:10:35] right
[1:10:36] and now the women are dying but they
[1:10:38] don't say what the women's going to get
[1:10:42] right
[1:10:44] you can't see the canaanites and
[1:10:49] from abel and cain today out in the
[1:10:51] world what's wrong with your blinded
[1:10:52] mind
[1:10:55] but you see i'm not trying to preach it
[1:10:57] that way i'm trying to appreciate it and
[1:10:58] what what does it mean to you and i
[1:11:03] there was a day that you and i was just
[1:11:05] as much a cane as anybody could be
[1:11:10] because that's the whole human race of
[1:11:12] mankind lost born in sin shaping the
[1:11:15] neck we've gone into the world speaking
[1:11:16] lies
[1:11:18] lost
[1:11:19] we didn't need a bunch of flowers to get
[1:11:21] us back
[1:11:24] we needed a lamb
[1:11:29] abel's revelation was it was blood so he
[1:11:32] offered blood
[1:11:33] that only spoke of the blood of jesus
[1:11:36] christ
[1:11:42] they didn't speak of flowers and
[1:11:44] they spoke of blood
[1:11:47] the god himself was gonna have to come
[1:11:49] down and die
[1:11:54] pay the price
[1:11:56] all i'm asking is one simple question
[1:11:57] we'll quit in a second
[1:12:00] what about your revelation
[1:12:02] will it bring a lamb
[1:12:08] we'll get to it this evening
[1:12:13] will your revelation
[1:12:15] bring a lamb for you
[1:12:19] well i've done got the lamb he died to
[1:12:21] that every denomination there is say the
[1:12:23] same thing
[1:12:25] that 2 000 years ago
[1:12:28] a lamb died
[1:12:30] what good is that if it's not a personal
[1:12:32] experience
[1:12:33] remember the whole point of what i'm
[1:12:35] talking about is what a positive
[1:12:37] attitude
[1:12:38] everybody in the bible that ever was in
[1:12:40] the bible meant any mounting to anything
[1:12:42] had a positive attitude
[1:12:44] well i'm going to church today i hate it
[1:12:47] i know what they're going to do they're
[1:12:48] going to do
[1:12:51] what does your prophet say
[1:12:55] he said you can't wait till the doors
[1:12:56] open
[1:13:03] but you don't understand my case
[1:13:08] why don't you bring some flowers and try
[1:13:09] to appease me with it
[1:13:15] maybe i'd understand your case
[1:13:22] dirty i agree with you
[1:13:24] but did he get the point across
[1:13:29] see we're standing right before
[1:13:31] the garden of eden
[1:13:36] and the sword is turned everyway
[1:13:39] but you know what i like the way the
[1:13:40] prophet explained it
[1:13:42] he said that sword was turning the way
[1:13:44] to keep them from the tree of life
[1:13:46] he said but that sword one day anchored
[1:13:48] into a man's side
[1:13:50] that was hanging on a tree
[1:13:52] and said now those same angels that was
[1:13:54] trying to drive us out of the garden to
[1:13:56] keep away to it he said they're trying
[1:13:58] to drive us back to it
[1:14:02] same angels that was trying to keep us
[1:14:04] away is now trying to drive us to the
[1:14:06] trevor because who is the tree of life
[1:14:07] jesus christ and who is he he's the
[1:14:12] word that true
[1:14:15] abel spoke
[1:14:17] of a coming messiah
[1:14:21] cain spoke
[1:14:23] of a religious society
[1:14:28] that would make everything so beautiful
[1:14:30] but even take the blood out of the
[1:14:32] songbooks
[1:14:34] you know what i'm talking about is true
[1:14:39] i love to talk to people that are 20
[1:14:41] years old and up because they got a
[1:14:43] little sense
[1:14:49] abel's offering
[1:14:51] was what god
[1:14:54] required you know what
[1:14:57] in abel
[1:14:58] in all of his doings and loving god and
[1:15:01] doing you know what abel could have done
[1:15:03] the next day
[1:15:04] and god would have been happy
[1:15:06] he could have went out and he said cain
[1:15:07] can i borrow some of your fruit
[1:15:10] i'm going down today
[1:15:14] not to try to appease him because he's
[1:15:16] already appeased
[1:15:17] but i'll take some of your works and
[1:15:19] i'll lay it down
[1:15:20] before the gate
[1:15:23] god loves for us to walk right and do
[1:15:25] right
[1:15:26] but to do it from an inward work of
[1:15:28] christ not because of a book of rules
[1:15:30] that we got to do to be saved
[1:15:33] book of rules don't save nobody
[1:15:36] it takes a born-again experience
[1:15:39] then what you're talking about would be
[1:15:40] fine
[1:15:41] but just remember the point i made
[1:15:44] cain
[1:15:45] tried to appease
[1:15:48] abel
[1:15:50] knew what happened because he knew
[1:15:53] god took the skins off of them animals
[1:15:57] in the original
[1:16:00] and he says god i'm giving back to you
[1:16:02] what you've done
[1:16:04] where does cain fit
[1:16:08] come on
[1:16:10] you ought to be listening a little bit
[1:16:12] where does cain's revelation fit
[1:16:16] nowhere in the bible does it fit
[1:16:25] come on brothers
[1:16:28] will you lamb
[1:16:30] will your revelation bring a lamb
[1:16:34] or will it bring fruit
[1:16:37] what do you mean brother dale i go to
[1:16:38] church i do
[1:16:39] that's wonderful
[1:16:43] as long
[1:16:45] as it's coming from a heart of a
[1:16:48] born-again christian
[1:16:52] that's why david
[1:16:54] will get to it eventually one of these
[1:16:56] days
[1:16:58] you know david being a murderer being a
[1:17:00] whoremonger being everything in the
[1:17:01] world you could make him right
[1:17:04] but yet the bible said he was a man
[1:17:06] after god's own heart
[1:17:10] god said one day like this he said your
[1:17:13] sacrifice is your offerings
[1:17:15] come on am i quoting scripture has
[1:17:17] become a stink in my nostrils
[1:17:22] the thing he ordained for them to do had
[1:17:25] become a stink in his nostrils he said
[1:17:28] but he said a man with an honest and a
[1:17:30] contrite heart
[1:17:32] is the one i look to
[1:17:38] what about it
[1:17:41] have you got a lamb
[1:17:49] or is it a bunch of
[1:17:52] flowers
[1:17:56] you're trying to make it beautiful
[1:17:57] instead of just being yourself
[1:18:00] and just letting god live
[1:18:04] there's no need of trying to appease god
[1:18:08] you know what
[1:18:09] i differed with a brother years ago
[1:18:12] you know what he found out that he was
[1:18:14] wrong at least he said he was yeah
[1:18:17] that's all right
[1:18:18] cody later he said he wouldn't so that's
[1:18:20] up to him
[1:18:22] but anyhow
[1:18:25] he bought me boots he bought me shirts
[1:18:28] and this man didn't spend ten dollars on
[1:18:31] a shirt
[1:18:32] this is 30 years ago did he spent 50 on
[1:18:35] a shirt
[1:18:42] because he wanted to be back on the good
[1:18:43] side with me
[1:18:47] well you know what he's not to give me a
[1:18:48] dime to be on any side
[1:18:53] because when he said brother forgive me
[1:18:55] i said you're forgiven for you ever done
[1:18:56] it brother
[1:18:59] if that ain't able in the garden
[1:19:02] i'd like to find out what it's supposed
[1:19:03] to be
[1:19:07] and see i'm the kind of person and you
[1:19:09] know it
[1:19:10] if you do me wrong
[1:19:12] and you ask me to forgive you
[1:19:14] that will never be mentioned again
[1:19:17] in my life
[1:19:20] i don't care if you do it same thing
[1:19:22] again
[1:19:25] that won't be mentioned
[1:19:27] why because i said i forgive you
[1:19:33] when are we going to get that away well
[1:19:36] i just can't do it brother dad well you
[1:19:37] need to pray
[1:19:39] that's some pain thing let's stand what
[1:19:42] do we got brother three twenty three
[1:19:44] three three twenty four same of course
[1:19:46] three twenty three
[1:19:59] upon
[1:20:01] that old tree
[1:20:05] by his strides we are healed
[1:20:09] and by his blood we are sealed
[1:20:14] hallelujah
[1:20:16] to
[1:20:25] in the name of jesus christ we send this
[1:20:27] person and the rape
[1:20:44] what
[1:20:59] and you're right
[1:21:04] again
[1:21:25] in
[1:21:26] appreciation to the lamb
[1:21:30] i don't preach
[1:21:31] to try to be saved that was probably a
[1:21:34] long time ago
[1:21:36] i tried to preach to tell you about the
[1:21:38] god
[1:21:54] sounds
[1:22:01] i want to be an example
[1:22:13] hallelujah
[1:22:47] don't want to go up
[1:23:10] hallelujah
[1:23:12] to the lamb of god
[1:23:18] well it was in the name of jesus christ
[1:23:20] our brother he would come that he needs
[1:23:22] patience
[1:23:25] take that patience
[1:23:29] because that's the only patience
[1:23:35] but when they laid
[1:23:37] him in the tomb
[1:23:39] the power of the lord came in
[1:23:48] it up to him as you leave and think
[1:23:49] about him
[1:23:52] you're dismembered
[1:24:09] by
