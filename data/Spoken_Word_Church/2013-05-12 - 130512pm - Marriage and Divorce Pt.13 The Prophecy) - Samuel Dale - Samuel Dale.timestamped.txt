[0:02] talking years ago um work in the fields
[0:06] in slavery that lasted many years after
[0:10] slavery ended I worked in the field with
[0:12] my grandmother when I was 5 years old up
[0:14] in New Jersey and um in the field people

[15:12] sister Trudy most of you know they took
[15:15] her to the hospital last was
[15:17] Wednesday and uh they was running
[15:20] through a whole lot of test and

[15:37] I really appreciate God for being with
[15:39] her and what 70 what 75 and get a full
[15:45] test of okay so that's good
[15:48] amen Matthew
[15:52] 19 the Pharisees came unto him tempting
[15:56] him and saying unto him is it lawful for
[15:59] a man to put away his wife for every
[16:01] cause and he answered and said unto them
[16:04] have you not read that he which made
[16:05] them at the beginning made them male and
[16:07] female and said for this cause shall a
[16:10] man leave his father and mother and
[16:12] shall cleave to his wife and they twain
[16:14] shall be one flesh wherefore they are no
[16:16] more twine but one flesh what therefore
[16:19] God hath joined together let not man put
[16:22] aunder they say unto him why did Moses
[16:25] then command to giving a writing of
[16:26] divorcement and to put her away way he
[16:29] sath unto them Moses because of the
[16:31] hardness of your hearts suffered you to
[16:34] put away your wives but from the
[16:35] beginning it was not so and I say unto
[16:38] you whosoever shall put away his wife
[16:41] except it be for fornication and shall
[16:43] marry another commits adultery and who
[16:45] so Marth her which is put away doth
[16:48] commit
[16:50] adultery now let's go to
[16:54] Romans
[16:57] 7 remember the scriptures one the
[16:59] prophet used an invisible Union and we
[17:02] will be studying on that so if you want
[17:04] to study the message invisible Union go
[17:06] through
[17:06] it know you not brethren for I speak to
[17:09] them that know the law as the law hath
[17:12] dominion over man as long as he liveth
[17:14] for the woman which hath an husband is
[17:16] bound by the law to her husband as long
[17:19] as he liveth but if the husband be dead
[17:22] she is loose from the law of her husband
[17:24] so if while so then if while her husband
[17:28] liveth
[17:29] she be married to another man she shall
[17:30] be called an
[17:32] adulterous but if her husband be dead
[17:34] she is free from that law so that she is
[17:37] no adulterous though she be married to
[17:39] another man wherefore my brethren when
[17:41] you are come are become dead to the
[17:44] excuse me wherefore my brethren ye also
[17:47] are become dead to the law by the body
[17:50] of Christ that you should be married to
[17:53] another even to him who is raised from
[17:55] the dead that we should bring forth
[17:57] fruit unto God God for when we were in
[18:00] the flesh the Motions of sins which were
[18:03] by the law did work in our members to
[18:06] bring forth fruit unto death but now we
[18:09] are delivered from the law that being
[18:11] dead wherein we were held that we should
[18:14] serve in newness of spirit and not in
[18:17] the oldness of the letter you may be
[18:19] seated to the Lord at his Blessing to
[18:21] the reading of the
[18:24] word now remember he says and not after
[18:28] the letter we don't try to
[18:31] destroy the letter of the word we
[18:33] believe the letter of the word it's not
[18:36] to say that well this is and you know
[18:37] that no no we know the word right so we
[18:41] believe in it and we try to follow it so
[18:43] just you know following in that line and
[18:46] we'll try to get to the point in a
[18:47] minute of what we're talking about but
[18:50] to make sure you understand I want to
[18:52] back up a little bit as we always do in
[18:53] the service prior and tie it all
[18:57] together and and all like that of what
[19:00] we were talking about this morning about
[19:01] the pardon of God you know and you know
[19:05] a pardon is not a pardon unless received
[19:08] is
[19:08] one all right
[19:11] now you say well is there any hope for
[19:16] me all
[19:20] right I was reading this morning
[19:23] sometimes and I looked while ago but I
[19:24] didn't laid them all aside but brother
[19:27] brand was talking about like salvation
[19:30] and things and he was actually stating
[19:32] like that people would say is there any
[19:34] hope he said you're in the church said
[19:36] why would you not be in said you
[19:38] wouldn't be here if it wasn't any hope
[19:40] said you'd be gone said you wouldn't be
[19:42] trying right you wouldn't be trying to
[19:44] serve God if it wouldn't any hope so
[19:47] then there's always hope if we can
[19:51] receive it now that was the whole
[19:53] morning's message right if we can
[19:56] receive it then there There's Hope but
[19:59] if we don't receive it then there is no
[20:01] hope so then what we're the ones that
[20:06] determine we are the ones that determine
[20:09] whether or not God can fulfill his word
[20:12] CU he will not pass over the free moral
[20:14] agency of an individual he will not save
[20:17] you if you don't want to be
[20:20] saved he won't do that because he's God
[20:23] and that's the way he's made it and he
[20:25] gave us all that we could have need of
[20:28] he gave us his word and Vindicated it
[20:32] down through these you know 6,000 years
[20:36] and he sent a prophet in the end time to
[20:40] verify and show to you and I personally
[20:43] in the end time were that we could uh
[20:46] receive
[20:47] it and and walk in the word what else
[20:50] could we need the new birth to put in
[20:53] our soul to teach us what the word is
[20:55] saying the word to be brought and a
[20:57] prophet to make sure that we don't get
[20:59] it mixed up and misunderstand it so what
[21:02] else could we have need of you say well
[21:04] I don't know whether or not it's far me
[21:07] well then it's not far
[21:10] you now I'm sorry that's that's as
[21:12] honest as I can be because that way I'm
[21:14] not playing jokes with you if you don't
[21:17] believe it there's no hope for you there
[21:20] are some people you know that they just
[21:22] can't believe I remember an old man I
[21:24] work you know and they went up to to the
[21:26] Moon you know and everything and he said
[21:30] talking about he said I don't believe he
[21:31] went to the moon said they just went out
[21:33] here in the desert somewhere and done
[21:35] these things see he just couldn't
[21:36] believe it you remember the prophet
[21:39] describing how that the the people would
[21:41] say you know I don't care what you do I
[21:44] I I wouldn't believe for healing he said
[21:45] it's not for
[21:46] you all right then whose fault is
[21:50] it you mean God come down show
[21:54] everything do everything prove
[21:55] everything that he's real and
[21:58] everything's for us and then we won't
[22:00] receive it then whose fault is
[22:03] it see if we can't receive the grace of
[22:06] marriage and divorce then it wasn't for
[22:08] us right that's just as truthful as we
[22:11] if we don't believe in the grace of
[22:12] salvation for the soul it wasn't for us
[22:15] amen but my point has always been one
[22:19] thing is to believe and talk like I did
[22:22] this
[22:23] morning that see we can accept salvation
[22:26] for the soul
[22:30] because we've been taught in our life it
[22:31] was you know meant to be and we supposed
[22:34] to be saved and done but because of
[22:37] something that would sound
[22:39] different as the prophet coming along
[22:42] and speaking to us of the grace of
[22:44] marriage and divorce and then by man's
[22:47] ideas and thoughts upon that we've
[22:49] placed ourselves in a condition of
[22:52] unbelief because we cannot accept what
[22:54] God has
[22:55] said well then it's not God's
[22:58] fault he has done everything I don't
[23:00] know what else he could
[23:02] do do you I mean is anything else he
[23:05] could do well he could come down and
[23:06] speak to me
[23:10] personally
[23:12] right is there any greater thing outside
[23:16] of God speaking literally I mean coming
[23:20] down himself and standing in front of
[23:21] you than a prophet standing here with
[23:23] the
[23:26] word see which would be greater well the
[23:30] word is the word why would we want to
[23:33] argue about anything that God would send
[23:36] unto us and vindicate that the man was a
[23:39] prophet why wouldn't we want to believe
[23:42] it you
[23:43] know and if I can't believe it let me
[23:46] have let me give it to somebody else
[23:48] maybe they can believe it you
[23:50] know and just be on that basis but see a
[23:53] pardon is not a pardon unless received
[23:56] as one that's right
[23:59] now see you can say I
[24:06] believe but then see and notice the way
[24:10] that the prophet I noticed about every
[24:11] statement he would make he said pardon
[24:13] is not a pardon because he was actually
[24:15] probably quoting from what they said but
[24:17] a pardon is not a pardon unless received
[24:19] as one right so that means that you
[24:22] could have the man had the
[24:25] paperwork Amen to be said free right the
[24:30] case that came up they had the paperwork
[24:32] they had it there he could read it but
[24:35] he couldn't believe it was for
[24:37] him
[24:39] well then whose fault is it see God has
[24:43] given us his word and Vindicated what
[24:46] else would we want all
[24:47] right now we're going to start here a
[24:50] little bit and just not go into the
[24:53] invisible Union that much this
[24:56] afternoon but I I want to just talk to
[24:58] you about something that is here in the
[25:02] scriptures now this will be tying
[25:04] together marriage and divorce and still
[25:07] with the grace that we're talking about
[25:09] this morning bringing it together to
[25:11] where we can understand because as I
[25:13] said if we can't believe for salvation
[25:15] for the soul there's no need to worrying
[25:16] about for the body or you know anything
[25:18] else it would be just forget it because
[25:20] there's no need to worrying if we can't
[25:22] believe so the most important thing is
[25:24] whether or not you're born again right
[25:26] amen see now that's the thing that
[25:29] you've got to settle within yourself
[25:31] amen you've got to go before God I did
[25:34] for two
[25:35] years you say well no you're supposed to
[25:38] just believe it well maybe I just
[25:40] couldn't believe it I don't say nothing
[25:42] I'm just telling you what happened for
[25:44] two years I sought after God for the
[25:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost after coming
[25:48] in this
[25:49] message reading and studying and praying
[25:53] and everything I thought I could do to
[25:56] try to get to to a place to
[25:59] receive but you know one day I did and
[26:01] that settled a lot of things but you
[26:04] know I had to overcome a lot of the
[26:06] opposition because see a lot of people
[26:08] believed you couldn't be saved after 63
[26:10] that was doctrines and ideas of
[26:13] mankind and see how that it's really
[26:15] been the preachers that has blinded the
[26:17] eyes of the people if my eyes and your
[26:20] eyes are blind you know were ever
[26:23] blinded somebody blinded
[26:25] them no they was trying to help us well
[26:29] in the help they were trying a lot of
[26:31] times it blinded us to the truth to
[26:34] where we could see all right but look
[26:37] what your Prophet had to say about this
[26:40] Romans
[26:43] 7 go ahead brother and pull up number
[26:46] one we do a little reading this
[26:48] afternoon maybe not too much but look
[26:51] what he says on the invisible Union
[26:53] paragraph 23 preached in 1965
[26:56] 11:25 now and Romans 7 trusting that you
[26:59] have your Bibles open everywhere now
[27:02] across the country we want to read
[27:04] closely now this message out of here it
[27:07] seems like its own marriage and
[27:10] divorce but it really
[27:12] isn't now watch you to me it's a
[27:16] prophecy for the church in the last
[27:19] days let us read all right then he reads
[27:23] Romans
[27:24] 7 all right now listen to what is he
[27:33] saying this message out of here it seems
[27:35] like it's own marriage and
[27:38] divorce
[27:39] right but really it isn't now we won't
[27:42] get to it this
[27:44] afternoon we will start Lord willing
[27:47] next Sunday afternoon
[27:49] probably so study invisible Union and
[27:52] think about
[27:53] it the prophet says
[27:56] that the invisible Union is a greater
[28:01] portion that's in invisible Union you'll
[28:03] find it it's a greater portion of
[28:06] marriage and
[28:08] divorce now what's a greater portion of
[28:13] anything if marriage and divorce is a
[28:16] portion what is a greater
[28:21] portion if salvation for the soul is a
[28:23] portion then you know I miss my wording
[28:27] you you understand
[28:29] you if married if if salvation for the
[28:32] soul is a
[28:35] portion well then the grace of marriage
[28:38] and divorce would be a greater portion
[28:40] wouldn't it but what about something
[28:43] greater than marriage and
[28:46] divorce that's right I'm giving you that
[28:48] to think on see a greater portion he
[28:53] said all right see then we all may say
[28:57] or some may say I you know well brother
[29:00] Dale I don't have anything about
[29:01] marriage and divorce to get straight I'm
[29:04] I'm pure well wonderful holy and pure
[29:06] that's good wonderful commendable very
[29:08] proud of
[29:11] you well I don't need the grace of
[29:13] marriage and
[29:14] divorce well that's that's fine and I I
[29:17] believe there are people that you know
[29:19] that are there for that that I went
[29:20] through those things in the showing that
[29:22] even like if a man puts his way his wife
[29:24] for committing adultery against him he
[29:26] doesn't need need the grace of marriage
[29:28] and divorce to clear him he's got the
[29:31] Bible but the Bible say she's dead while
[29:34] she's living so that's you know all
[29:37] right but
[29:40] now in doing
[29:44] it we look at these things from the eyes
[29:48] of what we've been
[29:51] taught and we've been taught by mankind
[29:54] the soul can be saved but the body can't
[29:56] so we're going to get a a new body well
[29:59] I don't believe that see I don't I just
[30:00] don't believe that I believe what goes
[30:02] down comes back up Resurrection is not
[30:05] replacement it's not coming back up
[30:07] looking like this it's going to come
[30:08] back up in your young age we've already
[30:10] had the example of Abraham and Sarah and
[30:12] the things coming forth so then if we're
[30:16] going to look at something as a greater
[30:18] portion I was saying you may not need
[30:21] the grace that was there of marriage and
[30:24] divorce but I believe every one of us
[30:29] and I we make it stronger so that you
[30:31] can differ with me all you want I
[30:33] believe the prophet was very happy to
[30:35] find the grace of marriage and divorce
[30:38] when he didn't need it but yet other
[30:40] people needed
[30:43] it but now when he comes invisible Union
[30:47] and that's a greater portion I believe
[30:50] every one of us you and I and the
[30:52] prophet of God himself needed the grace
[30:55] that goes with that right that's what
[30:57] we'll go through and see what because we
[30:59] were all married to organized religion
[31:02] that's
[31:03] right so now that husband somebody's
[31:05] going to be that guy's got to be dead
[31:08] somewhere all right
[31:10] and brother R said God let it
[31:13] die that's an invisible Union you can I
[31:17] can't kill it that's right do all you
[31:19] want to you can't kill it he let it die
[31:22] if you did kill it you'd be a murderer
[31:24] if you done it physically right that's
[31:26] right so what good would it do
[31:27] all right but now think about it we'll
[31:30] get to that part
[31:32] later he said this message it seems like
[31:34] it's on marriage and divorce but it's
[31:37] really not really isn't to me it's a
[31:40] prophecy for the church in the last days
[31:44] now this will be the thought of the
[31:47] service all the way
[31:49] through if we can't find in the
[31:54] Bible the things that we talk of
[31:59] then where did we get
[32:04] it you know they they said about brother
[32:07] brandom it said oh some old hermit up in
[32:09] the mountains is one that told him about
[32:11] uh serpent seed but now I don't think so
[32:13] I believe God done that but that's just
[32:16] a joking way of people saying it or
[32:18] somebody had said that about him you
[32:20] know I believe he found it in the
[32:23] Bible all right now the Bible
[32:28] listen to what I'm
[32:29] saying the Bible is written by
[32:34] mankind and you know it tells of life
[32:39] and death and living and salvation and
[32:45] even tells us about eternity to
[32:47] come in the
[32:49] Bible but what good is I was saying a
[32:52] moment ago is anything that we think we
[32:54] have when it's not word related that's
[32:56] right if you can't find it in the Bible
[32:59] what good is it amen that's your opinion
[33:02] that's
[33:03] right well now we believe that there
[33:06] certain things wouldn't written but it's
[33:08] well go and believe what you want
[33:11] to I I'm just set enough on the Bible
[33:14] like it is to just I think there enough
[33:16] of that I don't have to worry about
[33:17] anything else but see a lot of people in
[33:20] this end time have a lot of ideas and
[33:23] you know they bring the message in many
[33:24] many forms and ways and it's been just
[33:28] about perverted so much until people
[33:31] don't want to hear it because the first
[33:32] thing you do is you go connect connect
[33:34] up to the computer when you say William
[33:36] brandom they'll go to the computer and
[33:38] run it in and the first thing you get is
[33:40] a pop up of all of these people telling
[33:41] you how wrong wrong he were the people
[33:43] in the message telling you how wrong the
[33:46] prophet
[33:48] was well if you can correct a prophet I
[33:50] want you to take your shoe off cuz I
[33:52] only to kiss your toe cuz you have to be
[33:53] almighty God I don't mean that as a joke
[33:57] means the
[33:59] truth if you can correct brother brandom
[34:01] then you need to be the one that brought
[34:02] the message I truly need to be listening
[34:05] to you but don't come up with these
[34:07] silly ideas and you know that's that's
[34:10] one thing don't do it uh of doing it but
[34:14] prophecy now that's p r o p h e c
[34:20] y p r o p h e s y is Southern prophecy
[34:27] these prophecies one of them but to give
[34:29] you the definition see p r o p h e s y
[34:32] means like I'm speaking or somebody
[34:35] saying it's the words coming out of the
[34:37] mouth of the
[34:38] person but p o p h e see
[34:42] y if you'll notice it in
[34:45] Revelations
[34:47] 1:3 blessed is he that heareth and
[34:50] readeth the prophecy of this book
[34:54] right all right now
[34:59] prophecy what do you think of when you
[35:01] think of
[35:04] Prophecy see we think of somebody
[35:06] standing up and saying things no yay the
[35:08] Lord said so and so we think that's the
[35:10] what it is
[35:11] no that's that's not what the p o p e c
[35:15] y is that's the p o p e s y if it's of
[35:19] God if it's not it's somebody blab all
[35:22] right but now what is a
[35:25] prophecy
[35:30] see the entire
[35:34] Bible now this why we read Paul and used
[35:38] it there not of the
[35:43] letter we can take the letter of the
[35:45] Bible and prove any thought we want to
[35:49] True take the message prove any thoughts
[35:51] you want to
[35:52] bring but if we take it all and bring it
[35:56] together
[35:57] it'll make a beautiful
[35:59] picture I've always Illustrated it like
[36:01] if you start in Genesis with a white dog
[36:04] and you wind up in Revelations with a
[36:06] spotted or a black dog here or something
[36:08] you think you got it right no you're
[36:10] wrong cuz you changed your color you
[36:12] start with whatever you got to end with
[36:14] it that way amen just because you start
[36:17] with a with a black horse and you wind
[36:19] up in Revelations with a white horse
[36:21] you're not talking about the same thing
[36:24] you've changed on your ways that is not
[36:26] a
[36:27] prophecy prophecy is really taking and
[36:30] setting in order now I'll read this from
[36:33] the definition but it's really taking
[36:36] and setting in
[36:37] order the
[36:40] scriptures until they bring out one
[36:43] beautiful
[36:44] picture all
[36:46] right now if you get two pictures out of
[36:48] it see what you got you got the
[36:50] Antichrist that's why when the prophet
[36:52] see when it come down to the doing of
[36:54] the seals see he was actually
[36:57] and himself as I said now he had to get
[36:59] away from that because he was believing
[37:02] that the white horse rider was the Holy
[37:05] Ghost and teaching that until the seals
[37:09] broke right when the seal broke see then
[37:12] he saw two people read your first seal
[37:16] said here stands a lamb with a book in
[37:18] his hand and out there goes another fell
[37:20] another guy writing off read your seal
[37:23] book see you saw two people when you see
[37:26] two people in the
[37:28] Bible you don't have the revelation of
[37:30] one
[37:31] God you can see one God with many
[37:34] multiple manifestations
[37:36] yes but not two
[37:39] people when you see two people you got
[37:42] the devil on one end of it that ought to
[37:44] be enough to take away a lot of thoughts
[37:46] of people's ideas but it will not why
[37:49] because it ain't going to convert
[37:51] anybody just as I said everybody ain't
[37:53] going to believe everybody ain't going
[37:54] to believe the truth in this message
[37:56] right
[37:57] and swear and die by believing it but a
[38:01] prophecy see we're we're that's what I'm
[38:03] saying we're just think that it's a
[38:05] prophecy is just one thing that's why
[38:08] I've always encouraged you like to read
[38:10] the book of Daniel CU I I love to read
[38:13] it because the Book of Daniel is a
[38:16] constant dreams and things that are
[38:18] being
[38:19] seen but it's the same
[38:23] thing it's not revealing many things
[38:27] it's a continual revealing of the
[38:30] same all right the Book of Revelations
[38:33] is
[38:35] revealing the bride of
[38:40] Christ never is Jesus Christ seen in the
[38:43] Book of Revelations by
[38:45] himself he's always with the bride or in
[38:47] Bride form see that's a prophecy then
[38:52] see if you can take it and tie it
[38:53] together then you're not worried about
[38:55] what somebody says
[38:58] you know you you lay down the prophecy
[39:00] of the Bible of one true and living God
[39:03] and see then when somebody comes along
[39:04] and says yeah but now down there on the
[39:06] River Jordan down there you know when
[39:08] that happened said there was a dove
[39:09] coming down and a you know a voice from
[39:12] heaven and one on the earth and that had
[39:15] to be three
[39:18] right three manifestation yes but not
[39:21] three Gods see there's no Prophecy in
[39:24] the Bible will tie together
[39:27] anything
[39:29] incorrect that's why that the prophets
[39:31] now I'm just trying to get something
[39:32] about a
[39:34] prophecy brother BR said each
[39:37] Prophet would go back and check his
[39:40] message with the prophet previous to him
[39:43] right right why cuz he wanted to keep it
[39:46] correct yes you remember there when one
[39:49] of them you know he said we're going
[39:51] down there and we're going to go
[39:53] Jeremiah one which one of the prophets
[39:55] said we're going to be down there 70
[39:57] years well see this guy jumps up and oh
[40:00] he's under the anointing he he's the
[40:01] spirit's on him and he didn't deny they
[40:04] was going in prison that's what's so
[40:06] odd he said you'll be back in two
[40:11] years you
[40:13] remember well the prophet said if you
[40:16] you come back in two years and God
[40:18] didn't speak to
[40:19] me well we know what happened he also
[40:22] said you'll be in prison and he wound up
[40:25] right right but you understand yes
[40:29] Prophecies of old came by God himself
[40:33] bringing his
[40:35] word and they prophesied you know they
[40:38] spoke out his words from their
[40:41] lips and it was compiled and made into
[40:44] what we call the
[40:47] Bible all right so then that way one is
[40:51] not contrary to the
[40:53] other what a beautiful picture
[40:57] right so now think about it as we try to
[41:00] get into a point because I want you to
[41:01] see this that this is a prophecy for the
[41:04] church in the last days now I'm going to
[41:07] make my statement and then we'll just
[41:09] try to prove
[41:10] it so then if there's a prophecy in the
[41:13] scriptures and it's tied to to here with
[41:15] his talking of man and wife and Etc in
[41:19] Romans
[41:20] 7 then you
[41:23] realize that brother brandham has said
[41:27] I've got the
[41:28] scriptures on marriage and
[41:31] divorce that was almost a year before he
[41:33] preached it maybe a little more but it's
[41:35] right in there something the Lord even
[41:37] told him he's driving down the
[41:40] road said preach that and lay it
[41:47] aside he said I've got the scriptures he
[41:50] knew in the scriptures how did it lined
[41:53] up and what would
[41:55] be he he even knew in the scriptures
[41:57] that Moses gave a Grace he knew in the
[42:01] scripture that Paul gave a Grace cuz
[42:03] he'll say it on conduct order and do God
[42:05] has made a way for these things
[42:10] before but you see if all of that hadn't
[42:14] been laid in
[42:17] order come on he couldn't have went to
[42:20] the mountain and got the
[42:23] grace all right now that's the whole
[42:25] thought for today think about it had it
[42:28] not been in
[42:29] order
[42:32] right had he not had in order about the
[42:35] one true and living God how would the
[42:37] seals ever broke to him that's right
[42:41] amen are you with me yes they could have
[42:43] never broke to him the seals never come
[42:46] to straighten him out on the godhead
[42:48] that's
[42:50] right he had that right amen he said I
[42:54] preached what Paul preached mhm
[42:57] you remember beyond the curtain of time
[42:58] yes all right so now think about what
[43:01] I'm saying p o p h e see why
[43:06] prophecy is a setting and order to get
[43:09] everything lined
[43:12] up all right and we come and you'll see
[43:15] why the prophet would say it's only for
[43:17] the Believers in this message amen see
[43:19] we come into the message and we somebody
[43:23] when I hear there's marriage and divorce
[43:25] on that book
[43:28] then you go read it you don't know
[43:30] what's going on that's right I don't
[43:33] give anybody a seal book when I first
[43:34] introduce them to the
[43:37] message the first one I take them to is
[43:39] the church age book because the first 10
[43:41] and something pages is one God serpent
[43:44] seed and brother Ron was a
[43:48] prophet I don't give him a seal book to
[43:50] start
[43:51] with well because won't understand it I
[43:54] told you my experience when I wanted
[43:56] that seal book so bad brother Mo said
[43:58] read this book this this this this this
[43:59] before you do I read every one of them
[44:01] but boy it didn't take me long to get
[44:03] through I read the church age book in
[44:05] about two days or something you
[44:08] know I wanted that seal book cuz that's
[44:10] what I was interested in well when I
[44:13] read the seal book I got a lot of
[44:15] understanding a lot of things was good
[44:16] and clear that open my
[44:18] eyes I could quote you a lot he said but
[44:21] I still had a
[44:24] problem it wasn't opening the way I knew
[44:27] I supposed to so you know what I done I
[44:30] laid the seal book down and went back to
[44:31] the church a
[44:33] book I read and studied and listened to
[44:36] tapes and things and then one day I
[44:37] picked up the seal book and began to
[44:39] read some two years probably
[44:43] later and it began to
[44:46] unfold see a prophecy then would meaning
[44:49] laying in order of scriptures in other
[44:51] words what you getting down to here is a
[44:53] foundation right mhm right that's right
[44:58] all of that that's been said is a
[45:00] foundation that's right that Prophet
[45:02] took all that was said he had the
[45:04] scriptures on there he stood with the
[45:06] foundation through the opening he said
[45:07] it was revealed in the
[45:10] seals he had a foundation and he stood
[45:13] on that and he began to prophesy or how
[45:16] you say the other word he brought God's
[45:18] word down to a reality to you and
[45:21] I right prophecy go ahead with number
[45:25] two brother and
[45:27] listen I see different ones out here
[45:29] today and I'm wondering who's back there
[45:30] now they getting where they swapping out
[45:32] a lot so that's real
[45:34] good look at your strongs number 34 343
[45:39] 94 this is the word prophecy taken from
[45:43] Revelations
[45:47] 13 prophecy and other words a discourse
[45:51] now if I mispronounce these words you
[45:53] you read it discourse emanating is that
[45:56] the way you say it e m every from divine
[46:01] inspiration are declaring see and
[46:04] declaring the purposes of
[46:07] God whether by
[46:10] reproving in AB nishing The wickly
[46:15] Wicked are comforting The Afflicted are
[46:18] revealing things
[46:20] hidden especially by foretelling future
[46:23] events using the New Testament of the
[46:26] utterance of Old Testament prophets
[46:28] remember Paul Paul would take the Old
[46:30] Testament scriptures and bring them over
[46:32] in too see and that's why he was a
[46:33] biggest writer of the New
[46:37] Testament in the New Testament of
[46:39] utterance of the Old Testament prophets
[46:41] of the prediction of the events relating
[46:43] to Christ's Kingdom and its speedy
[46:46] speedy Triumph together with the
[46:48] consolations and admonitions pertaining
[46:52] to it the spirit of Prophecy the Divine
[46:55] mind
[46:56] to which the
[47:01] prophets Prophet what now pretaining to
[47:04] which the
[47:06] prophet faul I want somebody
[47:10] facilitates faculty okay we got it is
[47:14] due of the endowment and speech of the
[47:18] Christian
[47:20] prophets Christian teachers and called
[47:23] prophets the gifts and the utterance of
[47:25] these prophets especially of the
[47:28] predictions of the works of which set
[47:30] apart to teach the gospel will
[47:33] accomplish for the kingdom of Christ
[47:37] other words a bringing forth a telling
[47:41] of what God has in his
[47:44] mind Those Old Testament prophets never
[47:47] spoke their own words they spoke the
[47:50] words of
[47:51] God what a beautiful thing to be able to
[47:54] read through the Bible
[47:57] and find of all of those writers and yet
[47:59] they could keep a
[48:03] continuity to bring it forth into the
[48:05] correct thing that's something in that
[48:07] shows it has to be an almighty God you
[48:08] can't keep any other book doing those
[48:11] things so then what is it
[48:15] now I said a moment ago the prophet then
[48:18] had everything laying in
[48:21] order the seals then broke to the
[48:24] prophet right he had preached it the way
[48:27] it was supposed to be that's why a lot
[48:29] of people believe you know that a lot of
[48:31] people in the message believe that that
[48:33] uh the son of man come in the 63 to
[48:36] straighten out the
[48:38] prophet well I I just can't read that
[48:41] too much I I'm bad at reading but you
[48:43] know I can't read that
[48:45] way I believe you had it in order or it
[48:48] would not have
[48:49] opened now what was not in order no one
[48:55] could have have said it and corrected
[48:57] him about it Clarence Lin said the white
[49:01] horse rider was the
[49:02] Antichrist that was before brother
[49:04] brandham but he wasn't the
[49:08] prophet already are you listening so
[49:11] then what are we dealing with in a
[49:14] prophecy to look at the whole
[49:18] Bible and see if it
[49:20] declares the
[49:24] truth all right then waiting for the end
[49:29] time for it to be
[49:32] comprehended what about God doing
[49:35] that what do you think your job is go to
[49:37] number three what do you think your job
[49:40] is in the end
[49:42] time Christ's mystery of God revealed 63
[49:45] 728 paragraph
[49:47] 203 all these things typed him just in
[49:50] Ty but yet the mystery was hid them men
[49:53] didn't know what they were doing they
[49:55] only knew knew that they were led by the
[49:56] spirit to do so now holding it
[50:01] back in the last days for the great
[50:04] Revelation I want
[50:06] you but expressing
[50:09] it expressing himself in Moses and David
[50:12] and Joseph Elijah and on down through
[50:15] you we could take each one of those
[50:17] prophets and bring their lives out and
[50:19] show that it expressed Jesus Christ
[50:22] perfectly exactly yet never
[50:26] giving his secret and full look at it
[50:30] waiting for it to be made known in the
[50:32] last days as he
[50:35] promised what promised it the entire
[50:37] Bible that's right right watch that in a
[50:40] minute we're going to jump all the way
[50:41] back to Genesis and see if it was
[50:43] promised all right waiting for it to be
[50:47] fully
[50:50] comprehended see before he could express
[50:53] it if he told the whole
[50:57] thing waiting for it to be
[51:06] comprehended would have have done any
[51:08] good if the prophet had have walked out
[51:10] there as he said in conduct order and
[51:13] Doctrine there in ' 64 said the seals
[51:16] were opened in the marriage and divorce
[51:18] was revealed in the seals and he come
[51:20] out there in 64 and questions and
[51:22] answers and and he said I'm going to say
[51:24] to you
[51:30] even when it came the way it did how
[51:32] many
[51:34] comprehended what he was
[51:37] saying waiting for it to be fully
[51:46] understood waiting for it to be brought
[51:48] to a place you said we comprehended
[51:51] that's to mean to
[51:52] understand might not even be in the book
[51:54] one of those words are not even in the
[51:56] English
[51:58] language but yet God was waiting for the
[52:01] end time for somebody to be able to
[52:05] understand he's waiting on you and
[52:08] I
[52:10] right praise God waiting on us to
[52:13] believe
[52:15] it waiting on somebody that would be
[52:17] able to believe
[52:23] it said well I never thought like that
[52:27] well what about
[52:29] it it hasn't been
[52:32] done he said these things couldn't be
[52:34] understood down Through the
[52:37] Ages that God had to
[52:39] wait
[52:43] see now let's watch something as we go
[52:46] back to Genesis and come through the
[52:50] scriptures and watch a
[52:54] prophecy
[52:55] now it might not all be uh let's see let
[52:59] me quote brother
[53:03] brandom he said God can't not bring a
[53:08] revelation and then bring something
[53:11] contrary to that right you familiar with
[53:13] that
[53:14] quote he said because that wouldn't be
[53:17] correct but said he can bring a
[53:20] revelation and then add to that
[53:23] Revelation right
[53:25] he said like for instance in Genesis
[53:27] speaking of the seed of the woman
[53:28] nothing Ang you know he said and later
[53:31] come in full and tell where that was
[53:32] actually going to be at in the wound of
[53:37] Mary that's not added Revelation
[53:41] contrary to the Revelation that is more
[53:44] information about the Revelation
[53:48] bringing it into a Clarity or
[53:51] understanding all
[53:53] right now
[53:55] where did the marriage and divorce
[53:57] problems
[54:01] start all
[54:03] right it started in Genesis
[54:10] right okay now let's go back to Genesis
[54:13] and see what God said about it go ahead
[54:14] and pull up number
[54:16] four and I wonder how many of us has
[54:18] really read the
[54:21] scripture and thought about
[54:24] it
[54:26] that immediately when man had
[54:32] sinned he puts the curse on the
[54:36] snake he says what will happen to the
[54:38] woman he tells what will happen to the
[54:40] man but right in the middle in between
[54:43] the cursing of the snake and what
[54:45] happened to the woman and the man is
[54:47] that scripture right
[54:50] there and you know brother random
[54:52] actually makes the statement one time
[54:54] about it he he
[54:56] said that when Adam and Eve was walking
[54:59] out of the
[55:00] garden with the bloody skins flapping on
[55:03] their
[55:04] legs said God said I'll put enmity
[55:09] between thy seed and the seed of the
[55:11] woman
[55:14] right all right now read that and think
[55:17] about it I'll put init between thee and
[55:20] the woman and between thy seed and her
[55:23] seed and it shall bruise thy head Thou
[55:26] shalt bruise his
[55:28] heel at Calvary Jesus Christ destroyed
[55:31] the head of
[55:32] Satan you agree but he hit him in the
[55:35] heel in other words he killed him
[55:38] yes he struck his heel see he didn't hit
[55:41] him in the head he hit he hit Satan in
[55:43] the head all right
[55:48] now what do we think about that
[55:50] scripture even with related to go ahead
[55:52] number
[55:53] five that is actually Tak Tak a quote
[55:55] from marriage and
[55:59] divorce and it's coming down through and
[56:01] look what the prophet has to say and he
[56:03] comes down I put imity between thee and
[56:04] the woman and between thy seed and the
[56:07] seed woman's seed and it shall bruise
[56:09] thy head and thou shal bruise his heal
[56:11] the promising coming through the woman
[56:15] the Messiah to
[56:19] redeem all right now that was the first
[56:23] promise in the Bible
[56:25] right writing now not talking about for
[56:27] the foundation world and God and doing
[56:29] in the writings on Earth while mankind
[56:31] that's the first promise of the coming
[56:36] Messiah all
[56:40] right but are we like we were this
[56:42] morning of trying to talk about
[56:48] it do we believe that salvation is for
[56:51] the soul and we can accept that right
[56:55] it's for our souls it'll set us
[56:57] free we preach it for the
[57:00] soul but do we preach Redemption of the
[57:07] body and so yeah my preacher preached
[57:09] about he's talk about yeah what do he
[57:11] preach about it I'm just I'm not
[57:12] throwing off on nobody I'm asking you a
[57:23] question Do We Believe believe that the
[57:25] promise of the Messiah for redeeming or
[57:31] Redemption was for the
[57:34] soul and that
[57:39] only he said well brother D we don't we
[57:42] believe in Redemption we believe what
[57:44] goes down is coming back but really do
[57:47] you when a lot of people in this message
[57:49] believe that you're going to get a new
[57:53] body
[57:55] a lot of people you hear them talking
[57:56] and they leave it open where you can
[57:59] take either way you don't do what you
[58:01] want and they'll say I'm going to get a
[58:04] new
[58:08] body well you don't know whether they
[58:10] mean they going to get another one or
[58:12] what they're going to get right right
[58:15] well the people out there they so well
[58:17] brother so and so said he going to get a
[58:19] new
[58:21] body you see you've left the devil's
[58:23] trap wide open
[58:26] to where he can jump in real quick and
[58:28] pound you to death that's
[58:30] right you might wonder why I'm so
[58:32] adamant about saying it you know not
[58:35] this this this body made
[58:38] new Jesus's body was made new it was
[58:42] made
[58:44] Eternal all right so I believe in a full
[58:47] Plan of Redemption
[58:50] man body
[58:53] world right that's right cuz see my body
[58:57] come out of this world so if my body
[58:59] come out of this world where my body
[59:00] come from got to be made Eternal one day
[59:03] too I believe in an eternal City don't
[59:08] you I believe in an eternal
[59:11] World boy that I don't know about that I
[59:14] don't where it's going to be an eternal
[59:15] World on I think it might be just a good
[59:17] old
[59:20] world
[59:22] well you just choed about half your
[59:24] salvation for your soul in two and
[59:26] didn't know
[59:27] it sorry I happen to think like you
[59:32] think you just cut off parts of your
[59:35] soul and just got it about halfway
[59:38] right you heard the prophet say well in
[59:41] a way that's right is that right brother
[59:43] Gary and what did he say he says no such
[59:46] thing is about in a way he said it's
[59:49] either right or it's wrong right all
[59:52] right now we're either saved or we're
[59:55] lost that's right there's no gray areas
[59:58] you say well I just repented well you're
[59:59] on the way to
[1:00:02] Salvation all right but think about
[1:00:06] it what was the first thing that you
[1:00:09] would think of in reading and and you
[1:00:12] would think about the I'll put imity
[1:00:15] between thy seed and the seed of the
[1:00:17] woman and then read that that was the
[1:00:20] promise of the Messiah
[1:00:23] coming
[1:00:29] this is just a sure very short period
[1:00:30] after the
[1:00:32] fall irregardless of how long you want
[1:00:34] to make it right
[1:00:37] right and then when Jesus I read that
[1:00:40] scripture purposely over and over and
[1:00:43] over and over it's 13 times now we read
[1:00:46] Matthew where Jesus said from the
[1:00:49] beginning it wasn't
[1:00:53] so
[1:00:56] he goes back to where there's one male
[1:00:58] and one female
[1:01:02] right goes back before the
[1:01:05] fall as quick as the fall came he said I
[1:01:08] put enmity yes I will bring the Redeemer
[1:01:12] to restore Adam and
[1:01:15] Eve is that restoration of the Bride
[1:01:18] tree is that the future
[1:01:23] home
[1:01:27] what is to be restored only salvation
[1:01:29] for the
[1:01:33] soul come on are you
[1:01:37] listening I'll put enmity between thy
[1:01:40] seed and the SE one I'm going to bring a
[1:01:42] redeemer on the earth that'll take care
[1:01:44] of all the things and put you back in
[1:01:46] the garden just like Adam and Eve was
[1:01:49] before sin entered the
[1:01:53] picture now do you believe that right
[1:01:56] now if you put them back there you don't
[1:01:59] put them back there with a whole bunch
[1:02:00] of wives a whole bunch of husbands whole
[1:02:02] bunch of
[1:02:05] things now there's the first Prophecy of
[1:02:08] the coming
[1:02:09] Messiah but that's all we want to deal
[1:02:11] with it but to me that was the first
[1:02:14] prophecy that marriage and divorce was
[1:02:15] going to be
[1:02:19] preached if it wasn't never preached
[1:02:21] where would we
[1:02:23] be come on if the prophet hadn't brought
[1:02:26] it where would we
[1:02:28] be you ever noticed him on the marriage
[1:02:30] and divorce he said because this is a
[1:02:32] question in God's
[1:02:34] word where's the
[1:02:36] question I Ain worried about the answer
[1:02:39] I just want to know the
[1:02:42] question he tells you he said see Jesus
[1:02:46] when he came on Earth was
[1:02:48] questioned he was the word that was
[1:02:50] questioned not a question in God's
[1:02:53] word he was questioned about the word
[1:02:56] cuz he was the word
[1:03:00] right the seat of the woman take you all
[1:03:02] the way back to the Garden of
[1:03:05] Eden so it covers the whole plan there's
[1:03:08] a prophecy remember what I kept saying
[1:03:10] one go a prophecy is going into the
[1:03:13] scriptures and coming out of the
[1:03:14] scriptures of the same
[1:03:17] thing the seed of the woman was promised
[1:03:19] sure that would come to Calvary that
[1:03:21] would bean he would would die and that
[1:03:22] would mean the soul would be first but
[1:03:24] then the body has to come into the Life
[1:03:28] part and whether or not we need the
[1:03:32] grace come on whether or not we needed
[1:03:34] the grace we sure need a redeemed body
[1:03:39] would you
[1:03:40] agree and to me that would have to be
[1:03:42] the Plan of Redemption that would be the
[1:03:48] prophecy all right so you see where I'm
[1:03:51] starting yes starting in Genesis where
[1:03:54] where the fall was at not to just talk
[1:03:57] about salvation for the
[1:04:01] soul but to be talking about the
[1:04:04] salvation of all
[1:04:07] things the
[1:04:10] Redeemer if you ever noticed this
[1:04:12] scripture of course I know we read it
[1:04:13] many times but go ahead number six Joel
[1:04:16] 2 if you really just read the
[1:04:23] scriptures
[1:04:25] as I read this morning and quoted we did
[1:04:27] out of
[1:04:28] numbers where Moses said
[1:04:31] Lord
[1:04:34] pardon trying to show you the grace of
[1:04:36] marriage and divorce was spoke of all
[1:04:38] the way back through
[1:04:41] there he said Lord
[1:04:43] pardon these
[1:04:46] people and what did the Lord
[1:04:49] say okay I'm going pardon that wasn't
[1:04:51] what he
[1:04:53] said he said at Thy
[1:04:59] word what if Moses had never said
[1:05:03] that wouldn't have been no
[1:05:06] pardoning come on that's right read the
[1:05:09] Bible and
[1:05:11] pray I remember Fells one time said
[1:05:13] Don't listen to T unless you you uh pray
[1:05:16] 30 minutes well I couldn't pray 30

[1:05:26] Warrior there's people that are prayer
[1:05:28] Warrior to get down and pray for 3
[1:05:30] hours I used to pray with some brothers

[1:05:34] out in the woods we praying they pray
[1:05:36] for two or three hours I'd be S over
[1:05:38] reading why cuz I done said what I
[1:05:39] wanted to
[1:05:44] say does it take you an hour to say Lord
[1:05:47] bless the people at the church remember
[1:05:48] everybody's needs take care of everybody

[1:06:01] yeah but those are the ones that I'm
[1:06:02] praying that's ones I got on my mind at
[1:06:04] the time and I do that every night but
[1:06:07] don't have to pray three hours but see
[1:06:08] then you think I'm against praying for a
[1:06:09] long time I didn't say
[1:06:12] that now you're the
[1:06:14] liar you know what brother Rand said
[1:06:16] about him who was it was it moody or
[1:06:18] which one of them was it that walked
[1:06:19] into the City and said the city just
[1:06:21] shut down the thing he said the reason
[1:06:23] he did said he put these men under the
[1:06:25] bridge that were Prayer Warriors and
[1:06:28] said they stayed there praying while he
[1:06:30] went and
[1:06:31] preached have you ever said y'all pray
[1:06:33] for me well what would happen if I got
[1:06:35] up and said that what would happen now
[1:06:37] right here in the service I got up here
[1:06:38] and I said I want all y'all to pray for
[1:06:40] me right now just pray for me and all
[1:06:42] y'all started praying out
[1:06:46] loud I didn't mean
[1:06:49] that I meant for you to
[1:06:51] pray the Bible says pray without s
[1:06:58] ceasing okay listen read the
[1:07:03] Bible I will restore the years that the
[1:07:06] Locust have eaten the canker worm
[1:07:08] caterpillar the Palmer word great Army I
[1:07:11] know that's where the bug eat down
[1:07:13] through the church ages I know
[1:07:16] that and that was to be restored but is
[1:07:19] that
[1:07:21] all is that all that he was talking
[1:07:24] about to be
[1:07:25] restored let's read the scripture and
[1:07:28] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[1:07:29] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:07:32] that hath dwelt wondrously with you and
[1:07:34] my people shall never be ashamed and you
[1:07:36] shall know that I am in the midst of
[1:07:38] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[1:07:40] and none else and my people shall never
[1:07:43] be ashamed look what he said and it
[1:07:46] shall come to pass afterward that I will
[1:07:49] pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and
[1:07:52] your sons and your daughters prophesy
[1:07:54] iing of the coming of the Messiah not
[1:07:55] you know the day of Pentecost
[1:07:57] right not just the church ages and the
[1:08:00] doing your old men shall dream dreams
[1:08:02] and your young men shall see Visions I
[1:08:04] have a lot of dreams so that means I'm
[1:08:07] old and also upon the servants and upon
[1:08:10] the handmaids in those days will I pour
[1:08:12] out my
[1:08:13] spirit now where is he talking
[1:08:15] about is not that to be fulfilled in a
[1:08:19] compound meaning that it came at the day
[1:08:21] of Pentecost but is it not to be that
[1:08:24] he's to pour out his Spirit upon All
[1:08:25] Flesh in the last
[1:08:27] days so now we've jumped a long ways
[1:08:31] right still with the same
[1:08:33] scripture and I will show wonders in the
[1:08:36] heavens and the Earth blood and fire and
[1:08:37] pillars of smoke look like this day and
[1:08:39] the sun shall be turned into darkness
[1:08:41] and the moon into blood before the great
[1:08:42] and terrible day of the Lord come and it
[1:08:45] shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[1:08:46] call on the name of the Lord shall be
[1:08:49] delivered right for in Mount Zion and in
[1:08:53] Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the
[1:08:55] Lord has said and in the remnant whom
[1:08:57] the Lord shall call is not that pointing
[1:09:00] down here to where we're
[1:09:02] at so then Joel is not just speaking of
[1:09:06] the returning of the cankerworm pommer
[1:09:08] worm Locust the calip pillar eat down in
[1:09:10] the
[1:09:11] ages he's not just speaking of pouring
[1:09:14] out his Spirit upon the day of
[1:09:18] Pentecost he's speaking of the last
[1:09:21] days so there's a prophecy that started
[1:09:24] and comes through 6,000 years amen you
[1:09:29] understand what I'm saying what I'm
[1:09:30] trying to
[1:09:31] do a prophecy Genesis
[1:09:35] 15 because of the sin of the marriage
[1:09:38] and divorce problem it would be all the
[1:09:41] way through the
[1:09:43] word and we could read it to see this
[1:09:46] grace and what we're to
[1:09:48] be which came first Grace or
[1:09:51] law we say grace came first we really
[1:09:53] realized that that's true now Grace was
[1:09:57] way before the
[1:10:00] law but you really realize what that's
[1:10:04] saying you said well I thought the law
[1:10:06] came first well I see that's where
[1:10:07] you're messing up no Grace was in
[1:10:10] Abraham he had an unconditional Covenant
[1:10:12] before you come over to Moses with the
[1:10:15] writing of the
[1:10:17] law the law Paul said was added because
[1:10:20] of
[1:10:22] transgressions they were was never to
[1:10:24] have been nothing but Grace it was never
[1:10:25] to have been a a a king over Israel God
[1:10:29] was their King there was never to been
[1:10:32] none of those
[1:10:33] things Grace was way before the
[1:10:37] law all
[1:10:39] right the law was added because mankind
[1:10:43] could not see what Grace was really
[1:10:48] saying and it became a book of
[1:10:51] rules but brother brand said they didn't
[1:10:53] get what they they thought they got when
[1:10:54] they got the Ten Commandments he said
[1:10:57] they got God in letter
[1:11:00] form we see all we read Thou shalt not
[1:11:03] kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not
[1:11:06] commit
[1:11:12] adultery but if we ever get born again
[1:11:14] and read it again in a different way we
[1:11:16] don't read th shall not
[1:11:19] steal you read I shall not
[1:11:22] steal
[1:11:25] changes it don't it just a tone of voice
[1:11:28] changes the
[1:11:30] understanding of what it
[1:11:33] was let's just read a couple and get a
[1:11:35] little thoughts on this look at number
[1:11:37] seven go ahead
[1:11:42] brother this is paragraph 82 and through
[1:11:45] 84 of the message of Grace preaching 61
[1:11:51] 80827 the grace was promised in in the
[1:11:53] Garden of
[1:11:56] Eden I'll put enmity between thy seed
[1:11:58] the seed of the woman our's Grace
[1:12:00] promised right come on Grace to Adam and
[1:12:05] Eve no where to go no which way to turn
[1:12:08] and yet Grace made away all
[1:12:14] right p on down just save reading the
[1:12:17] grace of God reached over in Noah's time
[1:12:20] Noah just an ordinary man he and his
[1:12:22] family because God Noah feared God you
[1:12:24] believed God you can't fear God without
[1:12:26] believing how can you fear something you
[1:12:28] don't believe you've got to fear God
[1:12:31] Solomon said the fear of God is the
[1:12:32] beginning of wisdom so it was in the
[1:12:35] garden we could say it would be in a uh
[1:12:39] Abel and we could say it would be in
[1:12:42] Noah all before the law came into
[1:12:46] existence so let's just jump down a
[1:12:48] little bit and maybe I can get back to
[1:12:50] preach let's jump down to number nine
[1:12:52] brother this sa reading the number eight
[1:12:54] go on to number nine and look what your
[1:12:56] Prophet said on the message called a
[1:12:57] paradox
[1:12:59] 65017 paragraph 65 the atonement had
[1:13:03] been made been provided before there was
[1:13:05] any law Grace was before the law during
[1:13:09] the law and after the
[1:13:12] law all right Grace was before the law
[1:13:16] in the law and after the law
[1:13:20] Grace was in the
[1:13:22] garden a promise that he would come
[1:13:25] forth and bring forth and correct all of
[1:13:28] our
[1:13:29] things our
[1:13:32] problems so then the grace of marriage
[1:13:34] and divorce was spoke of in
[1:13:37] Genesis not just the grace of the
[1:13:42] soul and what about down through the
[1:13:51] times like I said this morning
[1:13:58] do we think about some of the things
[1:14:00] that God has spoken through the prophet
[1:14:02] to us look at number 10 the token
[1:14:07] paragraph 317 through
[1:14:11] 320 the word Joshua means Jehovah savior
[1:14:14] so does Jesus mean a savior in Joshua
[1:14:16] when he know his
[1:14:18] Messengers his Messengers returned back
[1:14:20] and said I have obeyed your orders
[1:14:22] remember this was coming in and the the
[1:14:24] walls of
[1:14:27] Jordan and there was a woman we found
[1:14:30] when we played the tapes you know they
[1:14:33] went in and told her about what is going
[1:14:34] to happen right we found a woman that
[1:14:36] believed you remember what she
[1:14:39] said you remember what Rahab actually
[1:14:43] said go back and read your
[1:14:45] Bible she said once you crossed that Red
[1:14:49] Sea said there was no fight in US
[1:14:53] now the greatest Fighters that had ever
[1:14:55] been known the greatest walls to run a
[1:14:57] chariot race around the tops of them
[1:15:00] everything but go back and read your
[1:15:02] Bible they said we didn't have no fight
[1:15:03] in us they scared to death and hadn't
[1:15:07] even seen
[1:15:09] them
[1:15:11] right she heard about it she believed
[1:15:16] it you remember what she done her house
[1:15:19] was on the wall you remember she got her
[1:15:20] family and
[1:15:21] everything and look what happened we had
[1:15:24] told her that all that would come under
[1:15:27] the red sign back there the token it
[1:15:30] would token it would mean now I have
[1:15:33] preached that will you honor it Joshua
[1:15:36] words I preached that of you I sent you
[1:15:38] to do it he's paraphrasing like you know
[1:15:41] to The Messengers Joshua we went down
[1:15:43] and told her you remember she dropped a
[1:15:45] red Scarlet thing outside the windows
[1:15:47] that they crawl down on leftt it out and
[1:15:49] everything else fell but that
[1:15:52] wall right
[1:15:54] right and then when that God honored it
[1:15:58] the house never shook down and then when
[1:16:00] Joshua stood there and give the signal
[1:16:02] to destroy the whole thing we went right
[1:16:04] straight up and Rahab and all her people
[1:16:06] set right and all of their possession
[1:16:09] amen amen all their possession was in
[1:16:11] the house safely they just stood there
[1:16:14] and didn't have to look out the window
[1:16:16] they could read the scripture while the
[1:16:17] battle was going on brother R has a
[1:16:20] wonderful way of explaining things on
[1:16:22] she you come right back watch now and
[1:16:26] courted now remember this is Rahab the
[1:16:29] Harlot
[1:16:31] right I can show you where one time that
[1:16:34] it says that brother brandham said she
[1:16:35] got fed up with the things of the day
[1:16:37] and saw the religions of her day was no
[1:16:39] good to go with that but listen she come
[1:16:42] back right back and courted courted the
[1:16:44] general in the Army and was raised up
[1:16:47] and come up in Bethlehem and her portion
[1:16:50] was allotted up there to them and she
[1:16:53] brought forth she brought forth a famous
[1:16:56] son that famus son brought forth another
[1:16:59] famous son and that famous son brought
[1:17:01] forth another famous son until the great
[1:17:03] famous son came right back down and on
[1:17:08] through obeyed and on through Jesse and
[1:17:11] on down into David that's right Harlot
[1:17:14] Rahab because she believed The Messer
[1:17:18] she applied the token listen and her
[1:17:22] house was saved
[1:17:24] or she'd perish down there where she
[1:17:26] would
[1:17:28] at
[1:17:34] now she married a Israeli
[1:17:38] General and from there came down the
[1:17:41] lineage straight to
[1:17:45] David there was another lady involved in
[1:17:48] there that she married a
[1:17:51] man illegally
[1:17:54] right and that was
[1:17:58] basba and
[1:18:00] basba you remember the wife of URI and
[1:18:03] David had him killed and all the whole
[1:18:06] story
[1:18:10] and can you explain
[1:18:14] that sure the baby died that was between
[1:18:17] basba and David but the next baby didn't
[1:18:21] and the next one didn't
[1:18:23] and down from Rahab and
[1:18:27] basheba comes the lineage to Jesus
[1:18:34] Christ I even know enough of the
[1:18:36] scriptures so that somebody come along
[1:18:38] think how smart they are the lineage
[1:18:40] does not go down to Mary the lineage
[1:18:44] went down to
[1:18:45] Joseph but Joseph and Mary were
[1:18:50] married that brought the lineage to Mary
[1:18:55] then all
[1:18:57] right you see I've heard people preach
[1:18:59] on these women in the Bible and but they
[1:19:02] make it out to be the wrong kind of a
[1:19:04] things they make the sex action the
[1:19:06] things being that you've heard them
[1:19:08] preach that that Adam in the garden had
[1:19:10] to grab Eve real quick and place his
[1:19:11] seed in her to save Eve to keep her from
[1:19:14] being killed I don't believe that only
[1:19:18] ask one
[1:19:19] question one simple question what took
[1:19:22] took care of Adam and Eve
[1:19:25] before Adam had relationship with Eve
[1:19:28] they had to been in the garden for a
[1:19:30] Time Eve had to be in the garden for a
[1:19:31] little while 10 seconds would have been
[1:19:33] plenty enough for God to killed
[1:19:37] her she was covered by the found for the
[1:19:39] foundation of the world that's right cuz
[1:19:41] God knew what she was going to do so you
[1:19:44] can't just play with scriptures and try
[1:19:46] to line up things and make it look like
[1:19:47] a beautiful story I'm not trying to make
[1:19:49] a beautiful story I'm trying to tell you
[1:19:50] the
[1:19:51] truth
[1:19:54] you mean from Rahab to
[1:19:58] harlot came the lineage to David to down
[1:20:01] to Christ
[1:20:04] yes even from basba in her doing
[1:20:09] wrong you remember David called down his
[1:20:12] own condemnation you remember that when
[1:20:16] Nathan the Prophet come up and told him
[1:20:18] he you know they had all these and I he
[1:20:19] took the one he said bring him out here
[1:20:22] I'll kill
[1:20:24] he said David You're The
[1:20:27] Man David thought he had it all covered
[1:20:30] up didn't
[1:20:32] he Nathan said thou the man but said
[1:20:35] David you won't die I've prayed for
[1:20:40] you what kept David from dying the words
[1:20:44] of a
[1:20:48] Prophet come
[1:20:50] on the words of a prophet kept David
[1:20:53] from being
[1:20:56] killed the
[1:21:01] prophecy who set you who set Rahab
[1:21:06] free brother R said she Believe The
[1:21:09] Messengers said she believe the message
[1:21:12] you
[1:21:14] know do you understand what I'm
[1:21:17] doing let me tell you one more time a
[1:21:21] prophecy runs throughout the Bible
[1:21:23] and it connects together one scripture
[1:21:25] after the other one to bring out the
[1:21:27] same thing when it started in the garden
[1:21:29] the marriage and divorce situation
[1:21:30] started in the
[1:21:32] garden God said I'll put enmity between
[1:21:35] thy seed and the seed of the woman the
[1:21:36] promise of the return back to the Garden
[1:21:39] right not to just bring Salvation for
[1:21:42] the
[1:21:43] soul but to promise to bring a
[1:21:47] redeemer and then down through his word
[1:21:50] you see people like Rahab thear
[1:21:58] you better
[1:22:00] believe a little thing the prophet said
[1:22:02] in marriage and
[1:22:05] divorce he said Moses gave a
[1:22:08] Grace and God counted it
[1:22:15] righteousness you better believe
[1:22:19] that he said Paul saw it in his day and
[1:22:23] said he spoke the word and God counted
[1:22:25] it
[1:22:26] righteousness he said how about in the
[1:22:28] last days
[1:22:30] amen so we went all the way from Genesis
[1:22:33] and come into Revelation still reading
[1:22:35] Matthew
[1:22:38] 19 where Jesus said from the beginning
[1:22:41] it wasn't
[1:22:42] so Prophet said and in the future it
[1:22:45] will not be
[1:22:47] so well I'd like to see it get
[1:22:50] straightened out how that David could be
[1:22:51] up there with all of his wives and
[1:22:53] Solomon all his wives and and my
[1:22:55] neighbor were his three
[1:22:59] and Paul
[1:23:02] said I believe it's in Hebrews 7 is that
[1:23:05] right or is it eight where Paul
[1:23:07] said no no excuse me let's get
[1:23:12] it
[1:23:21] Matthew where he's speaking of the Unix
[1:23:24] and things but but what the scripture
[1:23:26] I'm trying to think of I believe it's
[1:23:28] Paul that said there'll be no married
[1:23:31] and giving in
[1:23:32] marriage you remember that we can find
[1:23:35] it there'll be no married and giving in
[1:23:36] marriage in
[1:23:38] heaven to prove my point when brother
[1:23:40] brandham was standing there and his wife
[1:23:41] comes running up to him hope he thought
[1:23:44] she was going to grab him and hug him
[1:23:45] and say
[1:23:48] honey he said my precious brother turn
[1:23:51] walked off
[1:23:55] and when we get to heaven don't worry
[1:23:57] about who you're going to be mated
[1:23:59] with people in the message wonder if
[1:24:01] Paul had another hi they tried to study
[1:24:04] the message see brother random said Paul
[1:24:06] had another
[1:24:08] hi you know because they going back to
[1:24:10] the
[1:24:11] soul if you go back to the soul in one
[1:24:14] form we can get back to a wonderful
[1:24:17] place Adam and Eve was one in Soul
[1:24:21] yes but they were two different people
[1:24:24] body spirit and soul what made them one
[1:24:27] in Soul cuz she was in theophany with
[1:24:29] him right every Born Again believer has
[1:24:33] the same theophany
[1:24:37] Soul well I never heard it like that
[1:24:40] well you hadn't heard much of the
[1:24:42] message every Born Again believer has
[1:24:44] the same Soul Genesis 26 and 27
[1:24:51] right
[1:24:53] why because Jesus Christ died and gave
[1:24:55] his life that was just one soul that
[1:24:57] Soul comes and lives in you and me it's
[1:24:58] supposed to live in everybody that makes
[1:25:00] all of us
[1:25:02] Christ the beautiful
[1:25:05] picture to see that the grace of
[1:25:08] marriage and divorce were spoke of
[1:25:09] before we ever even started the journey
[1:25:11] down through
[1:25:15] the promised of God that a messiah would
[1:25:18] come and restore all things as we
[1:25:20] covered in joy
[1:25:24] and looking at the two worst cases you
[1:25:25] could just about pick up would be
[1:25:28] Rahab and see from her did come the
[1:25:31] lineage naturally speaking not spiritual
[1:25:33] lineage that's what everybody wants to
[1:25:35] make some spiritual something that were
[1:25:37] physical
[1:25:41] lineages but it did come
[1:25:43] down to bring the spiritual
[1:25:46] man Jesus Christ came on Earth he never
[1:25:50] come from David
[1:25:53] right he never come from Joseph
[1:25:58] right Joseph's the only one that come
[1:26:00] from
[1:26:03] David and he had nothing to do with the
[1:26:06] birth of Jesus Christ right right see
[1:26:09] you want to make spiritual things trying
[1:26:12] to make something beautiful to make it
[1:26:14] tantalizing to the feelings of
[1:26:19] people right
[1:26:24] who was it back there
[1:26:26] that you want to say you know
[1:26:29] that the man took his daughter-in-law
[1:26:32] you know and she's she preserved a
[1:26:34] lineage she just preserved a natural
[1:26:38] lineage Tamar Kar
[1:26:40] Tamar preserve the natural
[1:26:44] lineage brother Brown says that was an
[1:26:46] adulterous act you want that
[1:26:51] quote he said that was an adulterous act
[1:26:54] that Tamar and Judah
[1:26:58] performed now that's okay we can maybe
[1:27:01] grow with that but what about the next
[1:27:03] one in the
[1:27:07] prophecy where brother brandham
[1:27:09] said an adulterous act can't
[1:27:15] bring a chosen
[1:27:21] seed
[1:27:23] he said adultery can't do
[1:27:26] that see we want one but we don't want
[1:27:28] the other we want what we
[1:27:31] want instead of all the
[1:27:38] word let make sure I get that quote long
[1:27:41] ago he said an adulterous that can't be
[1:27:43] a predestinated seed that's a direct
[1:27:46] quote you said well I was born in
[1:27:49] adultery I was born illegitimate what
[1:27:51] good good now do something about it get
[1:27:56] saved you found out how dirty he
[1:28:05] was what about it
[1:28:09] Church finding out how bad we are is one
[1:28:12] thing but doing something about it
[1:28:15] that's right brother R said all babies
[1:28:17] go to heaven yes we don't quote them do
[1:28:21] we
[1:28:25] but you see Church the new New
[1:28:28] Birth doesn't deal with a physical part
[1:28:30] of the body so what does it matter if
[1:28:33] you you know in the message they got two
[1:28:35] lineages they got a lineage coming from
[1:28:36] Adam and they got a lineage coming from
[1:28:38] the Beast if you happen to be the
[1:28:40] lineage the DNA the the things coming
[1:28:43] from Adam you can be saved but if you
[1:28:45] come from the Beast you can't be I
[1:28:46] wouldn't give a hoot if you could prove
[1:28:48] I went all the way back to the
[1:28:51] Beast
[1:28:52] why cuz that ain't got nothing to do
[1:28:53] with the new
[1:28:55] birth the new birth is in the
[1:29:00] soul you know if the Beast even had a
[1:29:02] place for the soul he just didn't have
[1:29:04] them that's right you know that Cain was
[1:29:06] offered salvation come
[1:29:10] on oh now I don't believe that well you
[1:29:12] don't believe the Bible and the
[1:29:16] prophet get upset with me about
[1:29:20] it
[1:29:23] was not
[1:29:24] Judas
[1:29:27] told the same thing that Cain was
[1:29:35] told we thr off on Judas you know how I
[1:29:38] Stand All Judas done is just point it
[1:29:41] out here comes Peter along denying and
[1:29:43] cursing I don't know nothing about him
[1:29:45] get him out of here I don't want
[1:29:47] to and God comes down and saves him you
[1:29:50] know why cuz you know what what happened
[1:29:52] to David you want to
[1:29:56] quote brother Bram said Nathan went and
[1:29:58] told
[1:29:59] him you won't die he said but David
[1:30:03] immediately fell on his knees and began
[1:30:06] to cry out and repent yes Lord and said
[1:30:09] God looked down and saw David and said
[1:30:11] all
[1:30:12] right you're a man after my own
[1:30:15] heart just had a guy killed to take his
[1:30:18] wife away from him pregnated a woman it
[1:30:20] wasn't supposed to and God say you're a
[1:30:22] man after my own heart I don't think
[1:30:24] that's exactly the way what God
[1:30:27] is but when he had that honest and the
[1:30:29] contrite heart that's what God looks at
[1:30:33] your goody goodies and my goodies
[1:30:34] goodies that we didn't do these things
[1:30:36] that don't have anything to do with it
[1:30:38] we're just as lost as anybody that's
[1:30:40] right Prophet said I'd hate to think I
[1:30:42] come into the world Hebrew series and
[1:30:44] five minutes ago and had to face God he
[1:30:46] said because I born in sin sa in
[1:30:48] iniquity and went forth speaking a lie
[1:30:53] had no hopes to start
[1:30:55] with but the promise in the garden amen
[1:30:59] are you listening the promise in the
[1:31:01] garden was not just for the soul the
[1:31:03] promise in the garden was for the entire
[1:31:04] being of mankind and even a
[1:31:08] world to be made Eternal one
[1:31:12] day when are we going to start believing
[1:31:14] instead of just pity pattern
[1:31:18] around I was thinking today I thought
[1:31:21] Lord I wish I could preach like these
[1:31:22] other preachers can just make it so
[1:31:24] sweet and just say things that are just
[1:31:26] so sweet but I just a made that way and
[1:31:28] I'm sorry you can get you another Pastor
[1:31:30] anytime you want
[1:31:31] one I'm just me and that's that's what I
[1:31:34] stand but there's one thing about it you
[1:31:36] don't know you know what I'm saying
[1:31:39] whether you believe it or not you can
[1:31:41] tell them what I
[1:31:43] said because I say it enough my wife's
[1:31:47] always getting on to me said you keep
[1:31:48] repeating yourself you're getting old
[1:31:51] well I didn't know that had anything to
[1:31:52] do with getting old because I repeated
[1:31:53] myself when I was
[1:31:58] 20 cuz I found out repetitive things is
[1:32:01] easier to
[1:32:03] remember I went to school did you 1 + 1
[1:32:07] equals
[1:32:08] 2 1 + 1 equals 2 I got in a second grade
[1:32:12] and that poor old teacher she thought we
[1:32:14] was the dumbest things that was in the
[1:32:15] world she said we're going to start off
[1:32:17] 1 + 1 equals
[1:32:19] 2 and I thought lady we've know that for
[1:32:21] a whole
[1:32:25] year right but after a
[1:32:31] while we found out some things didn't
[1:32:36] we and we called it
[1:32:39] horsepower which meant was one horse
[1:32:42] pulling a buggy or a
[1:32:45] plow and they just went to the moon and
[1:32:48] Beyond and they're sending Rockets now
[1:32:49] out into the atmosphere well on out
[1:32:52] they still call that
[1:32:56] horsepower that rocket had so many
[1:32:58] thousands of thousands of thousands of
[1:33:02] horsepower 1 + 1 equals
[1:33:05] 2 brother Dale I've heard you preach
[1:33:07] marriage and divorce about five times if
[1:33:09] you hang around five more years I'll
[1:33:11] preach it
[1:33:12] again because I do about every four or
[1:33:14] five years to keep all of us lined up in
[1:33:16] our things and
[1:33:18] thinking but this time has been a little
[1:33:20] bit different
[1:33:23] amen this time I've tried to spend more
[1:33:26] time with not just especially the last
[1:33:27] few services not just
[1:33:30] quoting because a quote from Brother
[1:33:32] brandham unless it's revealed is what
[1:33:34] death in your
[1:33:36] hand Paul said the letter kth this Bible
[1:33:40] is death in your hand until it's
[1:33:43] revealed the grace of marriage and
[1:33:45] divorce started as quick as the marriage
[1:33:47] and divorce problem
[1:33:49] started I'll put enmity between thy seed
[1:33:52] and the seed of the
[1:33:54] woman come all the way through the Bible
[1:33:56] and a prophet picked it up and said it's
[1:33:58] lined up from Genesis to
[1:34:01] revelation God said okay come out here
[1:34:03] on the mountain I got to talk to
[1:34:06] you when he did he told him about the
[1:34:08] grace of marriage and
[1:34:10] divorce is it for me brother Dale if you
[1:34:13] don't believe it
[1:34:15] no if you can believe it there's
[1:34:19] hopes unless your hope this hope I do
[1:34:22] too let's come on Brothers I do
[1:34:28] too good thing to be preaching on
[1:34:30] Mother's
[1:34:35] Day but I hope you found out to this
[1:34:37] series at least that you've listened
[1:34:39] enough to find out that brother Dale is
[1:34:41] not just against
[1:34:43] women I'm against you and me
[1:34:49] both until I started screaming and
[1:34:52] hollering about it how many of you ever
[1:34:53] thought about that Paul speaks of a man
[1:34:55] having a virginity as well as a
[1:35:01] woman man ain't supposed to just go out
[1:35:03] and live like the devil and him be okay
[1:35:05] cuz he's a
[1:35:08] man he's got a virginity as well as the
[1:35:11] woman's got
[1:35:12] one and we could go into a lot of things
[1:35:15] your Prophet said about that
[1:35:19] too but I'm choosing to just try to
[1:35:22] preach Grace
[1:35:26] now and we will deal in The Invisible
[1:35:28] Union of a greater portion of marriage
[1:35:30] and divorce what's a greater portion of
[1:35:31] marriage and
[1:35:32] divorce got to go back to
[1:35:35] Genesis come out of there and bring it
[1:35:42] through we find out divorces don't
[1:35:47] work your husband's going to be dead
[1:35:52] amen but yet he's still right over there
[1:35:54] the buildings he still out
[1:35:59] here got to be dead to you and
[1:36:04] I we can be alive in Christ let's stand
[1:36:09] together you know I tried to figure out
[1:36:11] while I was preaching I look around and
[1:36:13] you know there's three lights but I
[1:36:15] figured out while ago that the one
[1:36:17] that's on is the one that's shining so
[1:36:21] you know that's where you're supposed to
[1:36:22] be
[1:36:24] looking well I found out years ago and
[1:36:28] I'm not a movie star I just read but you
[1:36:30] know you remember the old days the old
[1:36:33] days old Roy Rogers and them when they
[1:36:35] talking they look right straight at the
[1:36:39] camera they finally told him you're not
[1:36:41] supposed to be looking at the
[1:36:43] camera said look off P her away and go
[1:36:46] around then here goes who was it gatri g
[1:36:49] we was watching here a while back I love
[1:36:51] old westerns I'm sorry I do they old
[1:36:53] ones and old gatri he's going around and
[1:36:56] then he come back and he look he go
[1:36:57] around he come back and he look well see
[1:36:59] you see people now that don't even like
[1:37:01] the camera is not even
[1:37:03] there well you know I don't pay no
[1:37:05] attention to that I don't care what
[1:37:06] you're looking
[1:37:07] at all I'm trying to do is preach to you
[1:37:11] amen and I hope the world can what's
[1:37:14] hearing the
[1:37:15] message we'll go home and check it out
[1:37:19] right amen and see if it's true or not
[1:37:22] it ain't going to help me none it ain't
[1:37:24] going to make me
[1:37:27] nothing but maybe in some way I can help
[1:37:30] somebody to get
[1:37:33] free to know the
[1:37:37] truth go ahead one we
[1:37:45] got having
[1:37:50] Jes
[1:38:01] what anybody have a
[1:38:03] need can you see
[1:38:08] Grace Grace is throughout the
[1:38:12] word even when the law the prophet said
[1:38:16] it before the law in the
[1:38:20] law
[1:38:23] ni
[1:38:37] Grace because we do not
[1:38:45] care everything to
[1:38:48] God thank God he gave my voice where I
[1:38:51] could at least holler at
[1:38:55] you I don't mean to do that I just mean
[1:38:57] to make a
[1:39:02] point think about
[1:39:07] it Grace is a
[1:39:13] person Grace is not a Doctrine or an
[1:39:16] idea or a
[1:39:18] quote Grace is Jesus Christ
[1:39:22] why we read that to start with the grace
[1:39:25] that is brought to us at the revelation
[1:39:28] of Jesus
[1:39:33] Christ I thought the headstone was to
[1:39:35] come down
[1:39:37] what crying Grace Grace Amazing
[1:39:45] Grace Grace must be
[1:39:48] accepted or else it's a condemnation
[1:39:59] anybody have a
[1:40:02] need are we
[1:40:11] weak with Lord
[1:40:19] of
[1:40:24] you know one of these days I'm going to
[1:40:25] get around and get brave enough I'm
[1:40:26] going to preach on a god with
[1:40:29] amnesia I've said that for many years
[1:40:32] and a God that can't
[1:40:43] remember what about
[1:40:46] it aren't you proud of the grace of God
[1:40:53] set us all
[1:41:01] for
[1:41:07] find think about
[1:41:10] it Grace

[1:41:18] much we appreciate
[1:41:19] you future mothers and things how much
[1:41:22] we appreciate you for being what you

[1:41:36] the women because it to fall but just
[1:41:39] remember Adam had a
[1:41:42] choice remember the Bible says and Adam

[1:41:48] choice well he done it cuz he loved her
[1:41:51] was a type of Christ be careful how far

[1:41:56] thought just make it fit
[1:41:59] right don't make him a product of
[1:42:02] sin to try to
[1:42:06] save make him the love in his heart and
[1:42:09] God looked down and seen that love in
[1:42:10] his heart and he says Adam I've already
[1:42:13] made the
[1:42:17] way I've already said there's going to
