[9:49] thank you lord jesus amen
[9:53] that same spirit
[9:57] that same spirit that said let there be
[10:02] it's dwelling deep with inside of our
[10:05] heart
[10:06] good to be in the house of the lord good
[10:08] to have each and every one of you here
[10:09] with us today
[10:11] good to be in service yes god bless you
[10:14] the ones downstairs the ones that are
[10:15] watching in the ones are out around the
[10:17] car
[10:18] may the lord be with you and
[10:22] keep you safe in this journey that we're
[10:25] in
[10:26] i think it's uh i think it's checkup
[10:28] time
[10:30] we every every place we go and
[10:33] everything we do
[10:34] is just so much uncertainty and so much
[10:37] well i don't know if i can do this and i
[10:39] don't know if i can do that and i don't
[10:40] know if this is right and i don't know
[10:42] if that's right the only thing you might
[10:43] write yourself
[10:46] the only thing you make right is
[10:47] yourself and that's what
[10:49] we're we're all striving to do i think
[10:52] is is
[10:53] as we grow up with god then i think it
[10:56] makes us realize
[10:59] that um as the prophet of god told us
[11:02] that
[11:02] that many times that you know if you
[11:05] feel like there's something in your
[11:06] heart that you need to take care of you
[11:07] need to take care of it
[11:09] and i think it's maybe a little bit of
[11:11] checkup time with all of us that if
[11:12] there's anything that's
[11:14] i don't want nothing to hinder me don't
[11:16] want nothing to hinder the spirit of the
[11:18] lord moving in the building
[11:19] prophet of god said un one unconfessed
[11:22] sin could make the whole congregation
[11:24] barely fail
[11:25] so you know we need to just be sensitive
[11:28] about each other
[11:29] uh this is just coming from me this is
[11:31] knowing not an incident that's happened
[11:34] it's just that we all need to check up
[11:36] just shake out
[11:37] you know let god clean you out sometimes
[11:40] the flus gets stopped up
[11:42] amen and who can unstop the flus the
[11:45] lord jesus cannot stop the flush but you
[11:47] got to ask him because he won't do it on
[11:48] his own
[11:50] because he's a very timid gentleman the
[11:51] holy spirit is and he will only
[11:54] come as you ask him to come amen but we
[11:56] thank god for that that we know that we
[11:58] have access to that holy spirit
[12:00] we have access to the same man that said
[12:03] let there be that we're going to talk
[12:04] about today if we get to it
[12:07] but just remember us all in our prayers
[12:10] pray for brother joe i just talked to
[12:12] him he has crossed the florida line
[12:14] heading toward the mouse trap
[12:17] called disney world
[12:20] josh asked me about 30
[12:25] something years ago i guess or 20
[12:27] something years ago he said dad when can
[12:28] we come back here i said when you can
[12:30] drive
[12:33] haven't been since so and i think he's
[12:36] been maybe a few times but
[12:38] i'm not going back didn't leave anything
[12:41] down there
[12:44] and um don't won't go find anything
[12:46] that's down there
[12:47] but just you know brother joe they've
[12:49] got kids i mean i'm not belittling
[12:50] anybody if you want to go that's okay
[12:52] but but he's on his way down there so
[12:54] let's pray that everything will be fine
[12:55] with them
[12:56] also remember next sunday as brother
[12:58] dale said we'll have communion second
[13:00] service
[13:00] after second service we will have a
[13:03] communion and we'll decide whether to
[13:05] uh we'll you know gather here or gather
[13:07] downstairs or gather out in the parking
[13:09] lot so we'll
[13:10] just show up we'll figure out what to do

[13:14] amen um and don't miss communion and
[13:17] wednesday night brotherdale's already

[14:10] them peace

[14:28] father i believe he's a god good enough
[14:31] god that he'll put his arm around you
[14:32] one day literally put his arm around you
[14:35] and say this is why i did that it was
[14:37] for their good i knew

[15:46] message and
[15:48] not so much that but so much of physical
[15:53] that satan has started to attack us
[15:55] physically

[16:00] get
[16:01] our soul our soul is sealed in

[16:50] creator

[16:53] thing to the very end and we're going to

[17:16] you're the author and finisher of our
[17:17] faith
[17:18] father be with us and take care of us
[17:20] lead us and guide us by your holy spirit
[17:22] today we ask in jesus name
[17:24] amen all right let's go to first john
[17:26] this is we're still continuing on
[17:28] two spirits part three and if we get to
[17:31] let there be we'll get to let there be
[17:33] if not we will pick it up wednesday
[17:36] night
[17:36] first john 4 verse 1 beloved believe
[17:40] not every spirit but
[17:43] try the spirits whether they are of god
[17:46] because many false prophets are gone
[17:49] into the world
[17:50] now remember though folks if these false
[17:52] prophets
[17:53] there has to be true prophets
[17:56] amen they're just not all false there
[17:59] has to be
[18:00] a truth amen and god's word is truth we
[18:03] know that
[18:04] hereby know ye the spirit of god every
[18:06] spirit that confesseth
[18:08] that jesus christ is coming the flesh is
[18:11] of god now remember we
[18:12] talked about this before that doesn't
[18:14] mean if you go outside and you ask a
[18:15] drunk if the drunk says yeah i believe
[18:17] jesus is the christ
[18:18] that doesn't mean he's saved right that
[18:21] word confesseth
[18:22] means like i said before logos it goes
[18:25] to the word
[18:27] all right if you'll look it up in the
[18:28] dictionary in the uh in the greek
[18:30] that jesus christ has come in the
[18:32] fleshes of god and every spirit that
[18:33] confesses not that jesus christ has come
[18:35] into flesh
[18:36] it's not of god now you got to believe
[18:38] that he's come in your flesh
[18:40] amen it doesn't do me any good to know
[18:43] that he came 2 000 years ago
[18:45] unless i know that he's right here today
[18:47] amen because that's a historic god
[18:49] there's a lot of history
[18:51] i i i love this sermon that brother
[18:53] brown preached
[18:54] taking god out of history
[18:58] because many people they all he died on
[19:00] the cross therefore i'm saved
[19:02] well that don't mean nothing to you
[19:04] unless he's come inside your heart
[19:06] amen and we don't know that it's just
[19:09] hearsay
[19:11] i mean we're not our witnesses but
[19:14] we know that this word tells us
[19:16] everything that goes on right here
[19:18] this word is what we depend on all right
[19:20] and every spirit that
[19:22] confesses not that jesus christ is in
[19:23] the flesh is not of god
[19:25] and this is that spirit of antichrist so
[19:27] there's two spirits right
[19:29] there's not eight or ten or fifth
[19:30] there's only two spirits when you come
[19:32] down to it
[19:33] there's the spirit of christ and there's
[19:34] a spirit of antichrist everything
[19:36] underneath that is a list of things
[19:40] are you know you take satan and you take
[19:42] god
[19:44] but then you got satan you got diseases
[19:46] and you got all these different things
[19:47] but it just comes from one spirit
[19:50] there's an unholy spirit and there's a
[19:51] holy spirit all right
[19:53] whereof ye have heard that it should
[19:56] come and even now
[19:57] already is it in the world now this is
[19:59] in john
[20:00] about 1896. so it's that's been a long
[20:03] time ago
[20:05] ye are of god little children and have
[20:07] overcome them because greater is he thus
[20:09] in you
[20:10] than he that's in the world they are of
[20:12] the world
[20:13] therefore speak they of the world and
[20:15] the world heareth them
[20:17] we are of god he that knoweth god
[20:21] heareth us remember i said before our
[20:24] conversation
[20:25] our conversation when we were lost and
[20:27] out in the world the world of sin
[20:29] they understood our conversation they
[20:31] understood we were going to go get a
[20:32] beer
[20:32] they understood we were going to go get
[20:34] to this we were going to go get of that
[20:36] but when you walk in one day and say i
[20:38] don't do those things no more i've asked
[20:39] god to come into my heart
[20:41] and i don't have a desire to do that you
[20:42] know what they quit listening to you
[20:44] because they can't understand what
[20:46] you're saying how in the world
[20:49] well get a little bit of god and you'll
[20:51] know
[20:52] we are of god he that knoweth god
[20:53] heareth us and he is not of god
[20:56] heareth not us hereby know we the spirit
[20:59] of truth
[21:00] and the spirit of error let's read
[21:01] ezekiel before we sit down
[21:04] second one moreover the word of the lord
[21:06] came unto me saying
[21:08] son of man take up a lamentation
[21:11] upon the king of tyrus and say unto him
[21:13] thus saith the lord god thou
[21:15] seedlest up to some full of wisdom and
[21:17] perfect in beauty
[21:20] wow who is this guy thou has been in
[21:23] eden the garden of god so it's not
[21:25] talking about a king a physical king
[21:27] tyrus amen
[21:29] talking about the devil because king
[21:31] tyrus wasn't in the garden of eden
[21:33] okay so it's talking it's an allegory
[21:34] talking of
[21:36] the devil thou hast been in eden the
[21:38] garden of god every precious stone was
[21:40] not covering the sardius the topaz the
[21:42] diamond the barrel the onyx
[21:44] the jasper the sapphire the emerald the
[21:46] carbuncle and gold
[21:47] the workmanship of thy tablets and of
[21:49] thy pipes were prepared in thee in the
[21:51] day
[21:52] that thou was created
[21:55] you may be seated in the lord that it's
[21:57] blessing to read in his word
[22:00] that was prepared and then the day that
[22:02] thou was created who created the devil
[22:04] who created lucifer
[22:07] god did god created lucifer
[22:11] but he created him with a position
[22:14] and an ability to make a choice i'll
[22:17] read you in here a few minutes
[22:18] well it'll be later on that that i was
[22:20] trying to find that quote where the
[22:22] prophet of god was telling us
[22:23] and i finally found it where all angels
[22:25] are put on free moral agency
[22:27] every person even god is a free moral
[22:30] agent
[22:34] remember he wants all to be saved but he
[22:37] only knows how many is going to be saved
[22:39] because of foreign knowledge
[22:40] right he's not just a a god that just
[22:43] says i want everybody to die if you
[22:45] don't fall down no he's a good god
[22:48] but you got to remember one thing he
[22:49] created satan
[22:51] he created lucifer let's get that right
[22:53] he was he created lucifer
[22:55] perfect
[22:59] until iniquity and we'll read it in a
[23:01] little while in isaiah
[23:02] till iniquity was found in his heart all
[23:05] right
[23:06] so we know that one thing's for sure
[23:10] that what we were talking about before
[23:13] that god i believe he created lucifer
[23:16] first
[23:20] why would he create something lesser
[23:22] because
[23:23] we'll read here in a minute where
[23:24] brother brown said that lucifer was
[23:27] god's right-hand man
[23:30] right-hand man so you don't create your
[23:34] right-hand man
[23:35] way down the line no he's he's going to
[23:37] be your helper you got him right here
[23:39] and that's the problem we have with the
[23:41] devil is we think the devil is this
[23:43] um um
[23:46] all red suit we look at him in halloween
[23:50] and he's got the
[23:51] horns and he's got the fangs and he's
[23:53] got the blood hanging out of his mouth
[23:55] and he's got this big
[23:56] long tail you know what we've always
[23:58] been we've
[23:59] been told that tale satan is not that
[24:03] way we're going to read it in just a
[24:04] little while where
[24:06] god said you're beautiful
[24:09] right here it says in ezekiel verse 12
[24:11] it says perfect
[24:13] in beauty satan's the most beautiful
[24:16] angel
[24:19] most beautiful angel why because that
[24:22] can be the most deceiving
[24:24] how can you be deceiving how can you be
[24:26] the the
[24:27] epitome of deception
[24:32] look like we think satan looks like you
[24:34] know the boogeyman
[24:36] the old the you know the no
[24:39] no he's slick he knows how to work
[24:42] god made him perfect god made him
[24:44] beautiful
[24:46] but iniquity was found in his heart
[24:47] later on and we'll read that in just a
[24:50] minute but we're talking about two
[24:51] spirits because remember
[24:52] there's only two spirits now like i said
[24:55] before when we started
[24:56] i don't want us to get any person in
[25:00] mind i don't want us to get any
[25:01] denomination in mind because there's
[25:03] good people out in the denominations and
[25:05] and and we're not here to bash them but
[25:10] but there's a time when some when you if
[25:12] you turn the word down if you turn the
[25:13] pure
[25:14] adulterate unadulterated word down then
[25:16] god has to move on
[25:17] the denomination was good for a time
[25:21] but then god has to move on and when god
[25:23] moves on he leaves that
[25:25] because they can't go all the way with
[25:27] the word of god all right so
[25:29] but we know that god's used all the
[25:30] different ones to get to today that's
[25:33] why
[25:33] that i believe that that we are standing
[25:36] in the end time we're standing in the
[25:38] last there is no other
[25:41] word to come we've got everything we
[25:44] need
[25:46] uh when god sent us a prophet he didn't
[25:49] send us a halfway one he sent us a
[25:50] really good one
[25:52] he sent us one to give us what the words
[25:54] to tell us what the word says and
[25:56] actually
[25:57] go back into the mind of god and and not
[25:59] just for him to go into the mind of god
[26:01] but for you and i to go into that same
[26:03] mind
[26:04] because if you and i can't see this word
[26:06] because you know what it's the same
[26:07] thing as i said before
[26:09] if you can't realize and see the word of
[26:12] god
[26:12] like you see it in the message of the
[26:14] hour then brother brown's message is
[26:16] just hearsay
[26:19] i mean we do have some in here sister
[26:20] clito being one that literally saw the
[26:23] man
[26:24] and freedom was just a young girl
[26:26] probably didn't remember
[26:27] that much because she was a baby but
[26:30] some people did see him but some most of
[26:34] us did not
[26:36] so it's just a tale it's just something
[26:37] we heard it's just something
[26:39] but when but when god comes into your
[26:41] heart
[26:42] cleans out all that and puts the holy
[26:44] ghost in then if
[26:45] if this person had the holy ghost if if
[26:48] william branham had the baptism of the
[26:49] holy ghost
[26:50] and you get the baptism of the holy
[26:51] ghost you can't deny that
[26:54] because the holy ghost can't deny the
[26:56] holy ghost everybody got that
[26:58] because listen we're working with two
[27:00] spirits here
[27:01] one is the holy ghost and one is an
[27:03] unholy ghost or an unholy spirit
[27:07] and a holy spirit everybody got that say
[27:09] amen because watch now look in matthew
[27:11] 24
[27:12] verse 23 the bible says then if any man
[27:16] shall say unto you lo
[27:18] here is christ are there believe it not
[27:22] for there shall arise false
[27:26] devils no
[27:29] there shall arise false anointed ones
[27:34] false anointed christ
[27:37] and false anointed prophets
[27:40] and shall show great signs and wonders
[27:42] in so much that if it were possible
[27:44] they shall deceive the very elect you
[27:47] know we
[27:48] we look at a lot of these signs and
[27:49] wonders and we know that
[27:51] that we look at the great healing
[27:52] campaigns in the 40s 50s and
[27:55] in the early part of the 60s it that all
[27:57] these different people
[27:58] were a part of you know you got your
[28:01] schulers you got your
[28:02] um you just lump them all in there you
[28:04] got you know you got jack cole you've
[28:06] got
[28:07] um uh brother branham you've got
[28:10] uh all the different ones you oral
[28:12] roberts billy graham
[28:14] all these different ones came through
[28:15] that same era
[28:17] and they preached salvation as a message
[28:20] amen
[28:21] i mean they were god god spirit-filled
[28:23] men they weren't
[28:24] they weren't anti-word the antichrist
[28:26] was there sure
[28:28] but not in them but what happened is is
[28:31] during that time their
[28:32] healing campaign would kind of dwindle
[28:34] away but then you got
[28:36] the prophet of god coming on there in
[28:38] the 60s and bringing us a message
[28:41] bringing us the opening of the seals and
[28:43] the opening of
[28:46] of things that man had never had never
[28:48] dealt with before how in the world can
[28:49] we stand here today
[28:51] and and read these quotes and then read
[28:54] these scriptures and
[28:55] and that i can see how they dovetail and
[28:58] we can all see how they dovetail because
[29:00] when we
[29:01] when we look at acts 2 38 says repent
[29:03] and be baptized in the name of
[29:06] huh jesus christ
[29:10] we immediately know that's exactly what
[29:11] the bible says you say oh well well
[29:13] matthew 20
[29:14] 28 19 says baptize the name of the
[29:16] father that is the name of the father
[29:17] son holy god
[29:18] father's not a name son is not a name
[29:20] and holy ghost is not a name
[29:22] you're not going to sign your mother
[29:26] no you're not going to sign your check
[29:27] worker of whatever
[29:29] you're going to sign it by your name
[29:32] amen and i thought the bible says that
[29:34] all the family in heaven and earth
[29:37] are named jesus christ
[29:41] that's my identification i identify with
[29:43] my name that
[29:44] name tells me where i'm at and what i'm
[29:46] doing so
[29:47] actually what in acts 2 38 is the same
[29:50] scriptures matthew
[29:52] 28 19. same thing jesus told them going
[29:55] to all the world preach the gospel
[29:58] baptizing in the name not names because
[30:01] they're not names it's the name of the
[30:02] father what is the name of the father
[30:04] the lord what's the name of the son
[30:05] jesus what's the name of the holy ghost
[30:07] christ name of the lord jesus christ
[30:09] very simple
[30:10] once you see it okay let's go to the
[30:12] first quote now jesus was telling us
[30:14] that now be careful
[30:16] it's going to arise false christs and
[30:18] false prophets
[30:19] they shall grow show great signs and
[30:21] wonders
[30:22] let's look at number one in demonology
[30:24] the prophet of god tells us
[30:27] yeah there's false there's true and
[30:28] false of everything
[30:30] if i give you a dollar say is that a
[30:31] good dollar like i said before
[30:33] a good counterfeit dollar you can't tell
[30:35] the difference
[30:37] now satan doesn't make a counterfeit
[30:39] dollar that you can tell the difference
[30:40] he makes one that you can't tell the
[30:42] difference
[30:42] only what a trained eye only somebody
[30:46] with the holy ghost is going to know
[30:49] these two spirits that we're talking
[30:50] about because as jesus said if if
[30:53] somebody comes and says
[30:54] oh christ is over here well if you've
[30:56] got him inside of you why do you want to
[30:58] go over there
[31:00] or if you do go over there you'll know
[31:02] where he's at he's inside of you
[31:04] all right so now look i'm sorry excuse
[31:07] me and if jesus said the two spirits
[31:09] down here at the bottom
[31:10] and the last day would be so close till
[31:12] it would deceive the very lack that's
[31:13] what
[31:14] i just read you there in matthew
[31:19] religious people right
[31:23] now remember now there ain't nothing out
[31:25] there in them old cold formal outside
[31:28] they have just a form of godliness you
[31:29] see but these two spirits are
[31:32] real spirits it'd be so closely deceived
[31:35] the very elect how it was working
[31:37] side by side in the last days
[31:41] did jesus say that sure he did number
[31:43] two the god of this evil age 1965 the
[31:45] two spirits
[31:46] one of them god's holy spirit the other
[31:49] one the devil spirit
[31:50] working in deception not working in the
[31:54] bar joints and working in the beer in
[31:56] the
[31:56] in the beer you know factories and uh uh
[31:59] no
[32:00] working in the church
[32:03] the people of the earth are now making
[32:05] their choice
[32:06] the holy spirit is here calling out a
[32:08] bride for christ
[32:10] he is doing it by vindicating his word
[32:12] of promise to her
[32:14] for this age showing that it is christ
[32:17] if the finger is supposed to move in
[32:18] this age then the finger will move
[32:20] if the foot is supposed to move in this
[32:22] age the foot will move if the eyes to
[32:24] see in this age the eye will see
[32:26] the spirit of god as it's grown into the
[32:29] full stature of god
[32:30] there's the key
[32:34] we're not to be babies anymore paul told
[32:37] us to go on you know drink milk that's
[32:39] okay
[32:40] you know have your have your uh baby
[32:42] food for a time but when you grow up you
[32:44] don't have baby food no more
[32:46] amen you grow up and eat strong meat and
[32:48] that's what the age is now is the age
[32:50] that we're now living in
[32:52] the holy spirit is here vindicating the
[32:54] message of the hour
[32:55] and the holy spirit is doing this so
[32:57] that the people that believe
[32:59] god will be called out of this chaos now
[33:02] my would you not like to be called out
[33:04] of this chaos
[33:06] look the devil's unholy spirit is here
[33:10] calling his church by error
[33:13] as usual by perversion
[33:16] of the word of god he doesn't walk up to
[33:18] you and say no the word of god is not
[33:19] right
[33:21] no that's not deception the deception is
[33:25] is to be one word off
[33:27] that's when we get to the garden of eden
[33:29] and we see those two spirits working in
[33:30] the garden of eden we see which one
[33:32] that eve took hold of and it was only
[33:35] one word
[33:37] god said if you eat this tree you shall
[33:39] die satan said you shall
[33:41] not die and she took that
[33:45] one word and that's why we're wearing a
[33:48] mouse today
[33:50] amen by perversion of the word of god
[33:54] like he did at the beginning
[33:57] see it coming back to that seed time
[33:59] again from eden here it is again because
[34:00] remember
[34:01] the book of genesis is your seed chapter
[34:03] everything started in that book of
[34:05] genesis
[34:06] all right so remember as that started in
[34:08] the book of genesis
[34:12] god has shown the plan of redemption and
[34:14] then in the book of revelation it shows
[34:16] the end
[34:18] of that beginning so satan had a
[34:22] beginning
[34:23] satan's going to have an end if you're
[34:25] born of a spirit of god today you've
[34:26] never had a beginning
[34:28] and you never will have an end amen all
[34:31] right so let's do
[34:31] read number three see does not air with
[34:34] the show remember
[34:34] there was no more seed promised to a
[34:36] woman anywhere after mary
[34:38] and there is no more denomination
[34:39] promised after pentecost it's the
[34:41] rapture and the bride coming forth from
[34:43] there the seed
[34:45] the word made manifest again i want
[34:47] everybody if you've got a pencil
[34:49] a piece of paper to write this down on
[34:52] the top of your nose
[34:53] the spoken word is the original
[34:57] seed that wasn't just a message that
[35:00] brother brown preached
[35:01] that is so profound and i saw something
[35:04] just
[35:04] a couple days ago that blew my mind
[35:07] remember he is the only one that has
[35:11] seed i ain't talking about male seed i
[35:14] ain't talking about seed of a flower
[35:16] when you talk about god almighty he only
[35:19] has
[35:19] one kind of seed and that's the spoken
[35:24] word of god he believed his own word
[35:29] amen do you know a tree came from the
[35:32] spoken word of god
[35:34] you know grass came from the spoken word
[35:35] of god the seed didn't
[35:38] that was the seed i'll read it to you in
[35:41] a minute
[35:41] there's the old adage you know uh liv
[35:44] did the chicken come first or the egg
[35:46] well if you believe in creation the
[35:48] chicken came first because god created a
[35:50] chicken
[35:51] then out of that chicken came an egg
[35:55] but what created the chicken the seed
[35:57] word of god
[35:59] because we'll see here that the god
[36:02] creates them and then he tells them
[36:05] that every seed brings forth of their
[36:06] kind okay same way with adam and eve
[36:11] oh yeah where'd he come from
[36:14] spoken word spoken word god didn't come
[36:18] down and plant a bunch of seeds no i
[36:20] believe he's spoken into existence and
[36:22] then he told it
[36:24] to multiply all right everybody got that
[36:26] say amen
[36:28] so now look watch notice
[36:31] see how close it looks matthew said
[36:33] matthew 24 24 we read
[36:35] the two spirits in the last day the
[36:37] church spirit now look
[36:39] the church spirit of the church people
[36:42] not the prostitute
[36:45] you know out in the world no it's church
[36:50] church people and the bride spirit of
[36:52] the bride people would be
[36:54] so close together until it would deceive
[36:56] the very elective or possible
[36:58] that's how close now this is where i
[37:00] want to base everything on here number
[37:02] four
[37:03] i'm gonna read some of these quotes and
[37:04] then we'll then we'll get back to the
[37:06] beginning because remember we
[37:07] we were speaking last last week on
[37:10] before
[37:11] the beginning how can we go back before
[37:14] the beginning we've only got the bible
[37:15] that says god created the heaven and
[37:17] earth
[37:18] but we go back into the mind of god
[37:20] where the prophet of god makes it so
[37:22] real how that this person called god
[37:25] almighty
[37:26] would stand out in out in nothingness
[37:30] and create a world from what the spoken
[37:33] word read it
[37:34] the spoken word is the original seed a
[37:37] this world you're standing on
[37:39] came from the seed word of god
[37:42] speaking everybody got that say amen
[37:46] so now remember this christ in the true
[37:48] church
[37:49] is a continuation of the book of acts
[37:52] but the book of revelation
[37:53] shows how that the antichrist spirit
[37:55] would come into the church
[37:57] and defile it make it lukewarm formal
[37:59] and powerless
[38:01] it exposes satan revealing his works
[38:05] attempted destruction of god's people
[38:06] and discrediting of god's word
[38:08] because that's what satan does satan
[38:10] can't deny
[38:12] god's word he just wants to discredit it
[38:17] he can't deny because remember if we got
[38:20] god standing here
[38:21] and we got lucifer standing here the son
[38:23] of the morning
[38:24] the anointed cherub the angel that he
[38:27] created saying right here god's
[38:31] right-hand man
[38:33] he heard everything that was said but
[38:34] the problem was
[38:36] his problem was he couldn't speak it
[38:40] i believe that's what made him mad
[38:44] god's out here having all this fun
[38:45] making the stars and the moon
[38:47] and making solar systems beyond solar
[38:49] systems and solar systems beyond solar
[38:51] systems
[38:52] and the devil's going can i no be quiet
[38:54] can i no
[38:55] hush because he couldn't create he
[38:57] wasn't he wasn't a creator
[38:59] god is the only creator so he's the only
[39:01] one that has
[39:02] a seed to create with satan doesn't have
[39:06] that's why he's so
[39:07] powerless if we'll look at it in that
[39:09] form that satan is a created being but
[39:12] if you and i
[39:14] are born again today of the spirit of
[39:15] god you didn't have a beginning
[39:19] that inside person that when you said
[39:20] god saved my soul and he came down and
[39:22] he cleaned out that old nature
[39:24] and he put himself inside there satan
[39:27] can't touch that
[39:29] and he even made you a little creator
[39:31] when he did that amen
[39:33] so satan is a hate and that's why satan
[39:35] hates it
[39:36] he hates that god's inside of a human
[39:39] being
[39:40] he hates when god works through people
[39:43] in what not out there in here
[39:48] in the religious realm but the book of
[39:51] revelation shows how the antichrist
[39:54] spirit would come into the church and
[39:55] defile it making lukewarm formal and
[39:57] powerless
[39:58] it exposes satan revealing his works
[40:00] attempted destruction of god's people
[40:02] and discrediting of god's word
[40:04] right down to the time he is cast in the
[40:05] lake of fire because remember
[40:07] after all this after even a excuse me
[40:10] after all even a thousand years
[40:12] the bible tells us that for a thousand
[40:14] years that satan is bound
[40:17] right look can't be he's not loose
[40:20] because he can't work in the people
[40:21] he's not bound by chains he's bound by
[40:24] he has nobody to work to the bible tells
[40:26] us
[40:27] the bible says resist the devil and
[40:29] he'll flee from you
[40:30] you've bound him right there
[40:34] oh but no that devil he's such a
[40:39] i thought i read you last sunday where
[40:41] the bible or last week where the bible
[40:43] says that we'll look at him one day and
[40:44] say is that the man
[40:46] right yeah that took down nations and
[40:49] he'll be like an old sock drunk laying
[40:51] in a
[40:51] landing in a uh in a ditch and that's
[40:54] but
[40:54] remember though the guy's a fighter he's
[40:58] gonna fight him we bind him for a
[40:59] thousand years and after that thousand
[41:01] years he still thinks he's got a chance
[41:03] which we know he does not so
[41:07] that'll make you happy
[41:10] because we have the devil's answer the
[41:13] answer is
[41:14] this word of god that gives us power
[41:17] over the devil
[41:19] amen he knows he can't
[41:22] stand it he knows that if the people get
[41:25] the true revelation of the true church
[41:28] and what she is and what she stands for
[41:31] and that she can do the greater works
[41:34] she will be an invincible army now
[41:36] invincible armies
[41:37] never lose invincible armies
[41:42] never lose if they get a true revelation
[41:45] of the two spirits within the framework
[41:47] of the christian church right here
[41:51] today our false ideas and our
[41:55] things contrary to the word of god if
[41:58] they get a true revelation of the two
[41:59] spirits within the framework of the
[42:01] christian church
[42:02] and by god's spirit discern and
[42:05] withstand the antichrist spirit satan
[42:07] will be powerless
[42:09] before her he will be as definitely
[42:12] thwarted today as when
[42:13] christ withstood his every effort to
[42:15] gain power over him in the desert
[42:17] satan hates revelation but we love it
[42:20] and with true revelation in our lives
[42:21] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[42:23] us
[42:23] but we will prevail over them now let's
[42:26] go to
[42:27] number five exposition those church ages
[42:30] this is jude chapter 3 4
[42:34] and then it also has 12 but let's read
[42:36] this right here beloved when i gave all
[42:38] give gave all diligence to write unto
[42:40] you the common salvation it was needful
[42:42] for me to write unto you and exhort
[42:44] you that you should earnestly contend
[42:46] for the faith that was once delivered
[42:48] unto the
[42:49] saints for there are certain men this is
[42:52] the next scripture for there are certain
[42:54] men
[42:54] not saints crept in unawares
[42:58] those have not come into the fold by
[43:00] means of the door and are therefore
[43:02] robbers
[43:02] who were before of old ordained
[43:06] remember what brother louise was
[43:07] preaching on for ordination or
[43:09] for knowledge god knew that they would
[43:11] be reprobates he knew they would take
[43:14] the word of god and turn it into
[43:15] lasciviousness
[43:16] he knew all those things but he allowed
[43:19] them to come on this earth
[43:21] what to try me in you because they're
[43:24] going to feast with us i'll read it
[43:25] right here
[43:26] who were before of old ordained to this
[43:29] condemnation
[43:30] now listen not that god chose them to be
[43:33] ungodly
[43:34] listen god didn't even choose lucifer to
[43:36] be ungodly
[43:39] he gave lucy for a choice god cannot
[43:43] create
[43:45] the the devil the devil
[43:49] did that make sense he created lucifer
[43:53] and we're going to see in just a few
[43:54] minutes that lucifer means
[43:57] light bearer
[44:00] he didn't make him a dark creature like
[44:02] we think is you know well there's the
[44:04] opposition no he became the opposition
[44:06] by turning down the word of god he
[44:09] turned down his position and wanted to
[44:11] get what
[44:12] higher than god he couldn't help himself
[44:17] ungodly men turning the grace of our god
[44:20] into lasciviousness and deny the only
[44:21] lord god
[44:23] and our lord jesus christ these are
[44:24] spots in your feast
[44:27] of charity when they feast
[44:30] with you not feeding out there somewhere
[44:34] feeding with you feeding themselves
[44:37] without fear wow
[44:40] it cannot be denied in the face of these
[44:42] scriptures that the true church and the
[44:44] false church
[44:44] are intertwined remember jesus told him
[44:48] he said look
[44:50] remember they were talking about this
[44:51] certain group in a certain group he said
[44:52] look leave him alone
[44:54] he said let the wheat and the tares grow
[44:56] up together because when you got
[44:59] like i was telling you in my garden you
[45:00] got corn and grass looks just alike
[45:03] until it gets up to about this high
[45:06] right so you don't want to go out there
[45:08] and just whack it all down and say i'll
[45:09] get all these
[45:11] all this grass up and then you've cut
[45:13] down all your crop
[45:14] you wait till it matures and then jesus
[45:16] said wait just a little while
[45:19] and let the tares grow up in the wheat
[45:20] gr wheat grow up and then you'll be able
[45:22] to tell what by their fruits
[45:24] you'll be known and you'll be able to
[45:26] what separate the wheat from the tares
[45:28] the tares are to be burned we know that
[45:30] and the wheat is to be taken into the
[45:32] rapture amen
[45:34] but right now they are intertwined
[45:38] having been planted together but of
[45:41] different seeds
[45:44] look at number six
[45:47] consummation of the gentile age we there
[45:50] yeah okay
[45:51] this age is the last of the seven church
[45:53] ages what began in the first of the
[45:55] ephesians
[45:56] must and will come to full fruition and
[45:58] harvest and the last will lay out a c
[46:00] and age
[46:00] the two vines will yield their final
[46:02] fruit
[46:05] the two spirits will terminate their
[46:06] manifestation in each of their final
[46:08] destinations
[46:10] the sowing the watering the growing is
[46:12] all over
[46:13] summer's ended the sickle is now thrust
[46:15] into the harvest
[46:16] harvest time yes and actually this is
[46:19] now harvest time coming up
[46:21] uh sister milker reminded me this
[46:22] morning that this is barley season
[46:27] in over in in israel september october
[46:30] barley season okay anyway the two
[46:33] spirits will terminate their
[46:35] manifestation harvest time yes harvest
[46:37] time
[46:37] the two vines that grew together and
[46:39] intertwined their branches
[46:42] are now to be separated the fruit of
[46:44] those vines
[46:45] which were at such variants will be
[46:47] gathered into separate gardeners the two
[46:49] spirits will go to their separate
[46:52] destinations all right everybody got
[46:55] that
[46:56] they'll go to their separate
[46:57] destinations but now remember they had
[46:59] to have a starting place and that's what
[47:01] we were talking about last week
[47:02] they had to have a starting place those
[47:04] two spirits well
[47:05] remember we know that there was an act
[47:08] that happened in the garden
[47:10] of eden to throw us into sin but
[47:13] remember
[47:13] sin did not start on earth
[47:19] sin started in heaven that's why heaven
[47:22] and earth the pastor have to pass away
[47:24] remember the bible says oh lucifer thou
[47:26] have fallen
[47:28] all right thou have fallen down
[47:32] now that's been in the eden the garden
[47:34] of god
[47:36] wow that was perfect in my ways
[47:39] i'm reading in ezekiel but i'm kind of
[47:42] paraphrasing
[47:43] that was perfect in thy ways from the
[47:45] day that thou was created until iniquity
[47:48] was found in thee let's pull that up
[47:51] there if you don't mind
[47:52] look at verse 17 thy heart was lifted up
[47:56] because of thy beauty
[47:58] not because of thy ugliness that heart
[48:01] was lifted up because of thy beauty
[48:04] thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[48:06] of thy
[48:07] darkness nope that's not what that said
[48:10] because of thy brightness listen the
[48:13] devil don't want to be darker than god
[48:15] he wants to be brighter than god he
[48:17] wants you to notice him
[48:20] and not notice god because god came down
[48:23] in human flesh as a common man
[48:28] no beauty that we should desire him i'm
[48:30] reading scripture if you don't mind
[48:32] but what here and then here we reverse
[48:35] it
[48:36] and think well the devil's this you know
[48:38] this nasty
[48:39] no he is the most beautiful
[48:45] of angels he is the most anointed of
[48:48] angels
[48:49] god's right-hand man he was
[48:53] that heart was lifted up because of thy
[48:54] beauty thou hast corrupted thy kingdom
[48:56] wisdom by reason of thy brightness
[49:00] i will cast thee to the ground i will
[49:02] lay thee before kings that they may
[49:04] behold thee
[49:05] thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the
[49:07] multitude of thine iniquities
[49:09] by the iniquity of thy traffic it keeps
[49:12] going on
[49:14] so let's go to number eight and read the
[49:15] seal of god
[49:19] i'm doing a lot of reading today but i
[49:20] want you to to get
[49:22] we're going to get down to something
[49:23] here in just a minute i want i've
[49:24] already read these the other day so
[49:26] you're
[49:26] all you ought to have known that the
[49:29] seal of the antichrist 1955 if you'll
[49:31] notice just about the time that jesus
[49:33] came on the scene judas came on the
[49:34] scene
[49:35] you got to remember say here here we go
[49:37] to the very beginning then god comes on
[49:39] the scene
[49:40] he creates the first guy he creates is
[49:42] lucifer
[49:45] amen that's his right hand guy
[49:49] then you come down and you you look down
[49:51] and you you he's they're thrown down
[49:52] the earth and you got cain and abel
[49:56] then you we're going to keep on going
[49:58] through the bible you've got dathan cora
[49:59] and moses
[50:00] you've always got god bringing somebody
[50:03] on the scene
[50:04] then you've got elijah comes on the
[50:05] scene and there's ahab
[50:07] or then you've got elijah come on the
[50:09] scene
[50:10] and there's balaam you've always got
[50:13] oppositions so here when jesus comes on
[50:15] the scene
[50:16] judas comes on the scene now he is the
[50:18] epitome of deception
[50:22] judas is the epitome of deception
[50:26] he talked with god he walked with god he
[50:28] prayed
[50:30] he preached he cast out devils
[50:36] he sat beside of god we believe jesus is
[50:40] god you know that
[50:41] amen not a second person
[50:45] he was god if he what if he wasn't god
[50:47] he was a deceiver because he said if
[50:48] you've seen me you've seen the father
[50:50] amen so look i want you to notice the
[50:53] nature of these two spirits
[50:56] now judas was a religious man remember
[50:58] judas
[50:59] even to the very moment
[51:02] brother john the very moment jesus
[51:06] speaks in the upper room now he's going
[51:07] to die the next day
[51:09] he knows that but they don't know that
[51:12] right
[51:13] right he says whoever is sopping in the
[51:18] bowl with me listen what he's saying he
[51:20] failed to just listen to what the word
[51:21] said
[51:22] whoever stops in this bowl with me is
[51:25] the one that's going to deceive me
[51:26] it wasn't a roman centurion it wasn't it
[51:29] wasn't even caiaphas
[51:33] so we be very religious though he was
[51:35] the head of the religious organization
[51:37] of the day
[51:38] right they were out there
[51:41] but judas was right here
[51:44] and even when judas said is it me
[51:48] the lord turns and says go do what you
[51:50] got to do
[51:53] all the 11 was like well judas is just
[51:55] going to go pay the bills you know he
[51:57] was the money he was the bag holder you
[51:58] know he held the money
[52:00] he's going to just go pay for this meal
[52:01] that was last this supper that we ate
[52:06] how deceiving was that right there
[52:11] and i believe that really until they got
[52:14] into that upper room
[52:16] they really didn't understand what
[52:18] really happened to judas because
[52:19] remember judas right after that went and
[52:21] hung himself
[52:22] okay and then they probably found out
[52:23] about that and then when they up went to
[52:25] the upper room they found another
[52:27] matthias and put him in place of judas
[52:30] but then they really understood that
[52:32] they said man this guy was right here
[52:34] among us
[52:36] the greatest deceiver was right here
[52:39] sitting with us
[52:40] he was not 12 plus one
[52:43] abby he was not 12 disciples plus judas
[52:47] out here on the outside
[52:49] no judas was chosen by jesus
[52:53] to walk with the disciples one of the
[52:55] 12.
[52:57] you see what i'm saying here so close
[53:00] that it could deceive the very leg the
[53:03] two spirits now watch
[53:05] and i want you to notice the natures of
[53:07] these spirits now judas was a religious
[53:09] man
[53:10] he was not an infidel and all of us know
[53:12] that he was the antichrist
[53:14] he worked the very closest hand to
[53:16] christ his right-hand man
[53:18] did you know that in heaven that the
[53:20] devil was god's right-hand man
[53:22] in the beginning that lucifer the son of
[53:25] the morning now remember
[53:26] we call him the son of the darkness we
[53:28] call him the demon of darkness
[53:32] he's called the son of the morning
[53:34] that's daylight
[53:37] that's when it first comes up and it
[53:39] gets bright did you know that in heaven
[53:41] that the devil was god's right-hand man
[53:42] in the beginning
[53:44] that lucifer the son of the morning was
[53:45] given power
[53:47] and the reason that he brought sin into
[53:49] the world he was able to take something
[53:50] that god had created
[53:52] and perverted it back into an evil thing
[53:55] which started all this trouble
[53:58] in the beginning satan is not an
[54:00] originator
[54:02] because that'd make him a creator
[54:05] but he takes what god creates that's why
[54:07] he's so deceiving he's standing right
[54:10] there beside of god
[54:13] you say satan can yeah it's kind of hard
[54:15] to believe brother donny that
[54:17] that the devil can talk to god any time
[54:18] as evil as he is
[54:20] and we try to talk to god and sometimes
[54:22] you know where you at lord
[54:25] amen you say how it proved that
[54:29] well didn't go to the book of job
[54:34] god said uh hey satan where you been
[54:38] he said i've been up and down you know
[54:39] up and down walking up and down in the
[54:40] world you know and looking around
[54:42] looking around
[54:43] he said hey if you consider my servant
[54:45] job they're talking to each other
[54:47] listen satan is not this he is the most
[54:51] hideous thing in the world
[54:52] but god allows him to be right there
[54:54] because he created him perfect
[54:56] he created him to do a job but now he
[54:59] didn't create him
[55:01] to make him do a job that would make god
[55:05] not a just god
[55:06] if he created satan for the sole purpose
[55:09] of him to be evil
[55:10] no he created him perfect just like i
[55:12] told y'all before
[55:14] adolf hitler's spirit
[55:17] come from god his soul
[55:21] god said all souls are mine it's hard to
[55:22] believe that but it's not hard to
[55:24] believe if you'll understand
[55:25] god is the only life-giver that's right
[55:28] satan can't give you life he has no seed
[55:32] to
[55:32] base it from that's where adam and eve
[55:35] came from they came from the seed word
[55:37] of god
[55:41] that's right then that little
[55:45] baby that was formed in a womb
[55:49] came from the seed word of god his name
[55:52] was jesus christ
[55:54] the savior of the world the lucifer the
[55:57] son of the morning started all the
[55:59] trouble in the beginning
[56:00] then god back before the foundation of
[56:02] the world was ever laid
[56:03] when he seen what satan done see he knew
[56:06] what satan was going to do when he came
[56:07] here
[56:07] but he couldn't make him any other way
[56:09] and be a just god
[56:13] that's what i've said before every
[56:14] person then everybody it doesn't matter
[56:16] if it's an
[56:17] angel they were created
[56:20] with a choice
[56:24] i'll read it to you in just a few
[56:25] minutes how are you and i
[56:27] the bible says you and i are going to
[56:28] judge angels
[56:31] judge angels well they're just holy no
[56:34] satan
[56:35] preached listen michael and satan
[56:38] michael and lucifer
[56:39] didn't get up there and have a wwe
[56:43] um world wrestling federation uh
[56:46] knocked down dragout and one of them tap
[56:49] out no
[56:53] what is the war today it's not with
[56:55] flesh and blood and fighting
[56:57] it's what spirits is
[57:00] preaching
[57:03] satan preached his sermon to a third or
[57:07] two-thirds of the angels
[57:08] and they took his lie
[57:12] and then god cast them out of heaven is
[57:15] that all right
[57:16] so let's read this right here just keep
[57:18] on reading this right here
[57:21] and his pride went over in the north and
[57:24] set up a kingdom and fought against
[57:26] michael and his angels the right-hand
[57:28] man of almighty god
[57:30] was lucifer the son of the morning the
[57:33] first
[57:34] god granted him almost co-workers with
[57:37] him
[57:39] he was a co-worker partly equal with him
[57:43] only satan could not create so satan has
[57:46] no seed he has no origin
[57:48] he can't something cannot originate
[57:51] from him that's why he has to take
[57:56] and pervert amen
[58:00] all the all the things we do in life
[58:06] satan can pervert it and just twist it
[58:08] just a little way
[58:10] and it it becomes perverted because what
[58:12] is adultery
[58:14] we as human beings we're supposed to
[58:16] procreate
[58:18] but we're supposed to do it the right
[58:19] way we're supposed to marry
[58:22] amen right that's what god set up now if
[58:24] we do it right then we're okay
[58:27] but what does satan do he takes that and
[58:29] makes adultery out of it
[58:31] and turns it in the right act turned
[58:33] wrong
[58:35] preaching of the gospel everything's got
[58:38] a right and the wrong
[58:39] but satan took something look god is the
[58:42] only creator
[58:44] but satan took something that god
[58:45] created and perverted it back into
[58:48] something else
[58:50] evil amen in the garden of eden
[58:53] god created adam and eve perfect
[58:58] and full of god
[59:02] gonna get a little tit a little touchy
[59:03] here like brother dale said this morning
[59:06] they weren't sinners sin had not entered
[59:10] the picture yet
[59:10] now it was in heaven and it cast you
[59:13] know it ca he got cast down into the
[59:15] earth
[59:15] but he didn't create adam a center he
[59:18] created adam from the spoken word of god
[59:24] and then put that word inside of him
[59:27] same thing with eve
[59:29] so satan's watching it he's going hmm
[59:33] okay i got an idea
[59:36] i got an idea but i got to fight here i
[59:38] got to get me some subjects first so
[59:40] let's go to revelation
[59:41] 12 verse 7. and there was war in heaven
[59:46] one war in the garden of eden it was war
[59:47] in heaven i'm reading the bible
[59:49] revelations 12. there was war in heaven
[59:52] michael and his angels
[59:55] see the problem with satan is he didn't
[59:57] know that michael was god
[1:00:03] michael's christ not a different person
[1:00:08] i done told you satan thinks he's pretty
[1:00:11] fast
[1:00:13] but he's only second fast amen
[1:00:17] he's only second rate god can be right
[1:00:20] here today and
[1:00:21] appear to me and you today now we know
[1:00:23] not in body form we know that but he can
[1:00:25] appear and give you the holy ghost
[1:00:27] and be in china in less than a split
[1:00:30] second
[1:00:31] and give the holy ghost to the same
[1:00:32] person so now tell me he's not pretty
[1:00:34] quick
[1:00:36] so there stands god and he's talking and
[1:00:38] he's talking to satan and all of a
[1:00:39] sudden here comes
[1:00:41] a form comes out
[1:00:44] if michael was christ and we know the
[1:00:46] christ was the logos
[1:00:48] amen jesus christ
[1:00:53] but he sees that and he goes uh wait a
[1:00:55] minute i told you that's how satan got
[1:00:57] the father-son holy ghost baptism idea
[1:00:59] i mean the father-son holy ghost
[1:01:01] trinitarian idea
[1:01:02] he sees god standing here and he sees
[1:01:04] another form go out and then he
[1:01:06] then he remembers in his mind that god
[1:01:09] said
[1:01:09] let us create man in our own image and
[1:01:11] let's make them a god
[1:01:13] genesis 1 26 and there goes adam
[1:01:19] out of the logos and here's adam and
[1:01:21] here's michael
[1:01:22] and god's still standing there
[1:01:26] and satan's going hmm
[1:01:30] i think i can make three out of them and
[1:01:33] i'm going to feed it to them because i
[1:01:34] know there's just one the bible tells us
[1:01:37] that the devil believes in one god and
[1:01:40] trembles but he tells us down here that
[1:01:42] we got a father-son holy ghost we got
[1:01:44] three different persons
[1:01:45] or some kind of three-headed monster no
[1:01:50] listen like brother dale said this
[1:01:52] morning
[1:01:53] the bible tells us that the godhead
[1:01:58] can be easily understood by the things
[1:02:00] we see
[1:02:02] what do we see we see that as he said
[1:02:05] before but i'm going to use
[1:02:06] dad because dad wasn't dad when he was
[1:02:08] born
[1:02:09] dad was a child right right
[1:02:13] but then dad and mom gets together
[1:02:16] and has the perfect one first
[1:02:23] but now look it makes him it makes him
[1:02:27] he can't say anything he's in church it
[1:02:29] makes him father though
[1:02:32] you got that now it's the same guy right
[1:02:35] that's right same personality same
[1:02:37] samuel wade dalla was born
[1:02:39] april the 16th in 1940
[1:02:42] but he grew up and took a position
[1:02:45] of father when he had me
[1:02:49] now did he change his personality no
[1:02:52] probably made him a little more
[1:02:53] aggravated
[1:02:53] when the other two came along
[1:02:56] but it made him a father amen
[1:03:00] now remember though when he was born he
[1:03:03] became the son of sam dale
[1:03:07] right he became the son of sam and i'm
[1:03:09] looking at the same guy
[1:03:11] he became the son of samuel of sam dale
[1:03:14] then he became the father
[1:03:16] of samuel wade dale ii that is my name
[1:03:21] then he became the father of the mother
[1:03:22] too
[1:03:25] but now has he changed persons but now
[1:03:28] remember he's a human with
[1:03:30] limited ability because god's not
[1:03:33] right right god's not a one uh with
[1:03:36] limited ability
[1:03:38] he's all-knowing all he's there he's
[1:03:40] omnipotent he's on the present
[1:03:42] he knew how many kids he was going to
[1:03:44] have dad didn't right
[1:03:46] right right but god being god
[1:03:49] knew how many children he was going to
[1:03:51] have so that made him a father he was
[1:03:52] going to be a father
[1:03:53] right but he came down and become the
[1:03:56] son
[1:03:58] to die on the earth for me and you
[1:04:01] the son of man amen i like that like
[1:04:04] brother dale said brother brown said
[1:04:06] the only way god could be a father was
[1:04:07] to be a son first be a sad to be a son
[1:04:10] he didn't send a son i wouldn't send
[1:04:13] josh to die for me
[1:04:15] what kind of father would that be but
[1:04:18] then he's the same man later on in life
[1:04:20] became a grandfather
[1:04:23] and a pastor and you just keep naming
[1:04:27] titles but
[1:04:27] you only got one guy you take that same
[1:04:31] thing with god almighty and human flesh
[1:04:34] he was god almighty and he went and
[1:04:36] stepped into human flesh
[1:04:39] by creating a seed
[1:04:42] that came from where not from the earth
[1:04:45] because see my
[1:04:46] natural seed this is what i wanted to
[1:04:48] get into if i don't get anything else we
[1:04:49] may stop right here
[1:04:50] my natural seed came from this earth
[1:04:53] right
[1:04:53] that's right from him
[1:04:57] you you understand what i'm saying the
[1:04:59] natural seed of me
[1:05:01] came from him right
[1:05:05] that's the way it was for ordained back
[1:05:07] in what happened in the garden and we'll
[1:05:09] get into that later on right
[1:05:11] so my literal what you see right here
[1:05:15] come from this earth but now remember
[1:05:19] that's not the spoken word seed of god
[1:05:22] that's permitted of god to get you
[1:05:26] here so that you can make a choice
[1:05:29] whether to receive the seed word of god
[1:05:32] or the seed of discrepancy or the seed
[1:05:34] of the devil
[1:05:36] i shouldn't be getting close to y'all
[1:05:38] i'll stand back up here i'll put my mask
[1:05:39] on
[1:05:40] if i walk down there again tony's
[1:05:41] looking at me going
[1:05:46] just lean over a little bit
[1:05:50] but here we are and we see that god
[1:05:55] as he's standing there in the beginning
[1:05:59] if you can't see it i'm going to try to
[1:06:00] illustrate about as good as i can
[1:06:02] we know one thing's for sure god's not
[1:06:05] an old man
[1:06:08] as the as the pictures portray him as
[1:06:10] you know i
[1:06:11] i was telling you before when june went
[1:06:13] to the bab had her jaunt with the
[1:06:14] baptist church for the second time
[1:06:17] she come home with this book and she was
[1:06:19] so excited bless her heart
[1:06:21] remember women can be deceived a lot
[1:06:22] more than men just remember that
[1:06:24] but she brings this she hey man
[1:06:28] she brings this book home nice glasses
[1:06:30] she brings
[1:06:31] she brings this book home and she says
[1:06:33] we're studying this don't don't touch me
[1:06:36] we're studying this and i looked on
[1:06:39] there
[1:06:40] and she'll verify it it said
[1:06:43] experiencing god
[1:06:45] and it was a book about this big and it
[1:06:46] had all the little sweet little things
[1:06:48] somebody from a college somewhere out
[1:06:50] west or something
[1:06:52] wrote in the in the book jim tell them
[1:06:55] what the picture was
[1:06:58] it looked like rip van winkle
[1:07:03] ball-headed long hair stick in his hand
[1:07:06] like this experiencing god i told her i
[1:07:10] said
[1:07:10] that's not my god
[1:07:14] that may be the devil's god that he
[1:07:15] wants you to see
[1:07:18] but the god i see
[1:07:21] like brother brown said i can you see
[1:07:23] that he said a kid
[1:07:26] a child playing before the father's door
[1:07:30] and you know what most children you give
[1:07:32] them a bunch of toys
[1:07:34] man they go to town well what about if
[1:07:37] you give this
[1:07:38] being unlimited power
[1:07:43] we're going to get into that let there
[1:07:45] be light in just a little while if we
[1:07:46] get to it
[1:07:48] because that little kid that little 20
[1:07:51] year old god that never was
[1:07:53] old god's not one second as old now as
[1:07:57] he was when he said let there be life
[1:07:59] not one second if not he's not god so
[1:08:02] he's always been 20 years old
[1:08:04] he said how do you know that well
[1:08:08] brother dale's talking about this
[1:08:09] morning when
[1:08:11] that man that looked 50 he wasn't 50. he
[1:08:13] looked 50.
[1:08:14] bible says you look 50. you know he said
[1:08:16] before abraham was i am
[1:08:17] he said you look you look 50 years old
[1:08:20] oh you're no he was only 30 some odd
[1:08:23] years old right
[1:08:24] but he looked very old because of his
[1:08:26] his time on earth
[1:08:28] but now remember mary magdalene knew
[1:08:31] that guy
[1:08:33] right mary magdalene for three and a
[1:08:36] half years of jesus's ministry
[1:08:38] she followed him looking at that guy
[1:08:42] okay that's the picture of the guy she
[1:08:44] had in her mind
[1:08:46] everybody got that say amen all right
[1:08:50] but now remember when he raised from the
[1:08:54] dead
[1:08:56] and stepped out of the tomb
[1:09:02] he couldn't have looked like that
[1:09:05] that was his earthly time that was his
[1:09:08] earthly journey
[1:09:11] he was a young boy because when mary
[1:09:13] magdalene she turned around and she said
[1:09:14] what have you done with my lord i
[1:09:15] thought he was the gardener when you
[1:09:20] said talk about this morning
[1:09:21] the two that went to emmaus they had
[1:09:23] walked with jesus for that same three
[1:09:25] and a half years
[1:09:26] they knew him as that person right there
[1:09:29] but when he
[1:09:30] stepped out of the bushes and walked
[1:09:31] down through there he was in another
[1:09:33] form what he was in the form
[1:09:34] i believe he was back into the form
[1:09:36] besides the nail scars for me and you
[1:09:39] he was back in the form where he said
[1:09:41] let there be
[1:09:43] when he stepped out of that tomb he said
[1:09:45] all power
[1:09:46] and heaven and earth has been given unto
[1:09:48] me he went all the way back to eternity
[1:09:52] and he said hey i'm the same guy but
[1:09:55] guess what thomas this was for you
[1:10:00] i didn't have these nail scarves when i
[1:10:01] was back in eternity didn't need them
[1:10:05] he said but i had to do this because of
[1:10:06] you and he said i'll keep these he said
[1:10:09] i'll be happy to live in this body
[1:10:11] i'll be happy to live in this body but
[1:10:13] it doesn't look like that
[1:10:14] so here's god standing in eternity and
[1:10:16] he's standing there and he's
[1:10:18] 20 years old and he's going milky way
[1:10:25] son earth
[1:10:28] right here i don't want you to go any
[1:10:29] further because i need some people to
[1:10:31] live on this one
[1:10:33] you don't think that way i do when i
[1:10:36] read that genesis account
[1:10:38] i think man he's like fish in the water
[1:10:41] got some water here he said it's not
[1:10:43] really it's not really that
[1:10:45] cold or not really that one let's make
[1:10:46] some kind of fish that'll go in that
[1:10:48] warm water
[1:10:49] because there's some fish to go in warm
[1:10:50] water and some won't go in warm water
[1:10:53] what a variety that god is but what the
[1:10:56] problem is though
[1:10:58] is you got somebody following him
[1:11:06] so that's how you did that because
[1:11:09] remember in satan's mind
[1:11:10] he's working on his own he's working on
[1:11:13] his
[1:11:14] own kingdom
[1:11:17] he sees god setting up his kingdom and
[1:11:19] just going
[1:11:20] let there be let there be let there be
[1:11:24] and there was he could stand there for
[1:11:27] an eternity and go let there be and he'd
[1:11:29] get nothing
[1:11:30] but satan remember the perversion that
[1:11:32] satan had was is he said i'm going to
[1:11:34] take everything
[1:11:36] that he's doing and i'm going to
[1:11:40] twist it just a little bit and i'm going
[1:11:43] to have them people worship me
[1:11:45] because my kingdom's going to look
[1:11:47] prettier cain
[1:11:50] my sacrifice is going to look much
[1:11:52] better nimrod my city is going
[1:11:54] to be the biggest city huh
[1:11:57] right but we got to get out of the car
[1:12:01] in the meeting first
[1:12:04] but look but there was war in heaven
[1:12:05] let's pull back up revelation 12. i kind
[1:12:07] of get off a little bit there
[1:12:10] there was war in heaven and michael and
[1:12:11] his angels fought against the dragon and
[1:12:13] the dragon fought
[1:12:14] and his angels so there was a separation
[1:12:16] in heaven and prevailed not neither was
[1:12:18] their place found anymore in heaven
[1:12:22] and the great dragon was cast out that
[1:12:23] old serpent called the devil and satan
[1:12:25] so we know who that was
[1:12:28] and i have a quote i didn't bring it but
[1:12:30] brother brown said satan
[1:12:32] they believed satan's sermon
[1:12:35] so michael like i said michael michael
[1:12:37] and lucifer wasn't up here doing this
[1:12:40] no i believe god showed him his plan
[1:12:45] and i believe satan showed him his plan
[1:12:48] and satan took part of them with him
[1:12:50] because of their choice and god had part
[1:12:52] of the ones
[1:12:53] that chose him i just how else are you
[1:12:56] going to say it
[1:12:59] to watch and he was cast out into the
[1:13:03] earth
[1:13:04] and the angels were cast out with him
[1:13:08] so where is the devil the devil's not in
[1:13:12] hell
[1:13:13] that's where he's going
[1:13:16] he's here he came from
[1:13:19] what another dimension into this
[1:13:21] dimension to do what
[1:13:23] to try to destroy god's creation
[1:13:27] amen he went into god's eden and
[1:13:32] destroyed it
[1:13:34] now we'll watch later on how that god's
[1:13:36] going to come into satan's eden
[1:13:38] and he's going to take out a bride and
[1:13:42] satan is going to hate it that's why i
[1:13:43] said
[1:13:44] satan hates revelation he hates us to
[1:13:47] know where we come from
[1:13:48] what we're doing here and where we're
[1:13:50] going all right
[1:13:52] and the great dragon was cast out in
[1:13:54] verse 10 and i heard a loud voice saying
[1:13:55] in heaven
[1:13:56] now has come salvation and strength and
[1:13:59] the kingdom of
[1:14:00] our god and the power of his christ for
[1:14:02] the accuser of our brethren is cast down
[1:14:04] which accused them
[1:14:06] before our god day and night how many
[1:14:08] times have i told you that god tells
[1:14:10] us that if he will if we will ask him to
[1:14:13] forgive
[1:14:14] us of our sins that he will place it in
[1:14:17] the sea
[1:14:17] of god's forgiveness according to the
[1:14:19] old testament never to be remembered
[1:14:22] again
[1:14:22] god's the only one that can do that he's
[1:14:25] the only one can erase his memory
[1:14:27] right because the devil's going to go
[1:14:28] don't you remember he did god's going
[1:14:33] what sins are you talking about i love
[1:14:35] that song
[1:14:36] what sins are you talking about the
[1:14:39] devil is the accuser of the brethren
[1:14:42] he accuses us day and night i don't know
[1:14:44] if he does that to you but he sure does
[1:14:46] it to me
[1:14:47] he reminds me of all the things that i
[1:14:50] did
[1:14:52] all the wrongs that i did and you know
[1:14:53] what listen
[1:14:56] don't go to god and ask forgiveness for
[1:14:58] the same sin over and over again
[1:14:59] unless you unless you don't think that
[1:15:01] you really got forgiveness but if you
[1:15:03] get forgiveness that sin
[1:15:04] god's just you know the lord's gonna
[1:15:06] look at you and go
[1:15:11] what's saying you're talking about
[1:15:13] because i thought he was coming back
[1:15:14] after a sinless
[1:15:16] perfect white
[1:15:20] robed bride of jesus christ now let us
[1:15:22] go to heaven and get it
[1:15:24] when you get the baptism from the holy
[1:15:25] ghost you get your white robe here
[1:15:28] you carry it there with you oh that
[1:15:30] ought to make you feel good
[1:15:32] how did all that even god's standing
[1:15:34] there and all this chaos going on with
[1:15:36] the devil
[1:15:37] and he's going that's all right
[1:15:40] that's okay i got my people
[1:15:43] you know where i had them i had them
[1:15:45] satan where you couldn't find them i had
[1:15:47] them right here
[1:15:49] i had them right here and this is where
[1:15:52] i keep them
[1:15:55] that great album that god took a picture
[1:15:58] of you like i said before
[1:16:00] if god's a 20 year old god guess what
[1:16:02] you and i are going to be when we get to
[1:16:03] glory when we get
[1:16:04] when we take a body change we're going
[1:16:06] to change right back just like jesus did
[1:16:08] we're not going to change back why would
[1:16:10] donnie want to strive all
[1:16:13] his whole life being 70
[1:16:16] one years old why we do want to strive
[1:16:20] to be a good
[1:16:20] christian and even if something does
[1:16:22] happen he passes away that he's going to
[1:16:24] raise back up
[1:16:25] like that
[1:16:29] me too brother all of us no
[1:16:32] we don't have a hope we have an assurity
[1:16:34] that if we do have to go into another
[1:16:36] dimension and we have to sleep we don't
[1:16:38] die
[1:16:38] if we have to sleep that that 20 year
[1:16:42] old body
[1:16:45] that god had before the foundation of
[1:16:47] the world put up in his mind
[1:16:50] that's why you and i have to come we
[1:16:52] have to come natural seed first because
[1:16:54] of what happened in the fall we'll get
[1:16:55] to that a little bit later on
[1:16:57] because of what happened in the fall we
[1:16:58] got to come this way because
[1:17:00] we'll read it in a minute where jesus or
[1:17:03] you say jesus or the creator
[1:17:05] the creator said let every seed bring
[1:17:08] forth of its kind now remember satan was
[1:17:10] standing there and he was going
[1:17:12] hmm now he said that let's see if we can
[1:17:16] make it come to pass
[1:17:20] because i don't have a seed for myself
[1:17:23] right satan don't have a seed he's not a
[1:17:26] person
[1:17:26] as far as that is he's not a human being
[1:17:29] he's a spiritual being
[1:17:30] right so he can't procreate he can't and
[1:17:32] jesus never procreated either you know
[1:17:34] we got to get that we came on this side
[1:17:36] of the of the of the act
[1:17:39] remember the spoken word is the original
[1:17:43] seed
[1:17:43] not from the loins of man not from not
[1:17:45] from an act it comes from this act
[1:17:48] he stood there and said let there be and
[1:17:50] there it was
[1:17:52] right all right so let's get let's go
[1:17:55] through this a little bit more here we
[1:17:56] go
[1:18:00] and heard a loud voice saying in heaven
[1:18:01] now it's come salvation and strength in
[1:18:03] the kingdom of our god and the power of
[1:18:04] his christ
[1:18:05] for the accused of our brethren is cast
[1:18:07] down which accused them before our god
[1:18:09] day and night
[1:18:10] and they overcome him by the blood of
[1:18:12] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:18:13] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:18:15] unto death
[1:18:16] therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[1:18:18] dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of
[1:18:20] the earth
[1:18:21] and of the sea for the devil it's come
[1:18:23] down
[1:18:24] unto you having great wrath
[1:18:28] because he knoweth that he hath but a
[1:18:31] short time
[1:18:32] isaiah 14 verse 12 how art thou are
[1:18:35] falling from heaven oh lucifer
[1:18:38] son of the morning what does lucifer
[1:18:40] mean i showed you here in
[1:18:42] the greek lexicon lucifer means the
[1:18:44] light bearer
[1:18:45] shining one morning star
[1:18:49] you know jesus called the morning star
[1:18:52] satan wants to be called just like him
[1:18:54] he don't want to be he cr
[1:18:56] sure he everything around him is
[1:18:58] darkness
[1:18:59] but remember he had a light
[1:19:03] so let's look at this just a second how
[1:19:04] art thou fallen from heaven a loose for
[1:19:06] son of the morning
[1:19:07] how art thou cut down to the ground
[1:19:09] which does weaken the nation
[1:19:11] which did us for thou hast said in thine
[1:19:13] heart
[1:19:14] i will ascend see he got cast out so
[1:19:16] he's got to go try to get back up
[1:19:18] brother john he's trying to get back up
[1:19:19] that way
[1:19:19] trying to get back into heaven i will
[1:19:22] ascend ascend is up
[1:19:24] i will ascend into heaven and i will
[1:19:26] exalt my throne above the stars of god
[1:19:30] i will sit also upon the mountain of the
[1:19:32] congregation in the sides of the north
[1:19:34] ah that's in the congregation around
[1:19:37] here
[1:19:38] all of us i will ascend above the
[1:19:41] heights of the clouds i will be light
[1:19:43] the most high
[1:19:46] now remember there's a position he wants
[1:19:48] to be like god but if you read over in
[1:19:50] the book of revelations here
[1:19:51] we'll get it maybe wednesday night he
[1:19:53] wants to be god
[1:19:55] it won't be like god he wants to be god
[1:19:58] right
[1:19:58] and you and i are not like god if you're
[1:20:01] born again today you are god
[1:20:04] made manifest in another form what one
[1:20:05] of those other attributes that satan
[1:20:07] can't understand because
[1:20:09] here stands the creator
[1:20:13] and there went adam and eve
[1:20:17] and then on the day of pentecost there
[1:20:18] was 120 little jesus is created
[1:20:21] right satan can't understand that you
[1:20:23] know why because he can't multiply like
[1:20:25] that
[1:20:26] he perverts what god has
[1:20:29] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[1:20:31] to the sides of the pit
[1:20:32] they that see thee right here this is it
[1:20:34] they that see thee shall
[1:20:35] narrowly look upon thee and consider
[1:20:37] thee saying is this the man that made
[1:20:40] the earth
[1:20:41] the tremble yeah
[1:20:44] that did shake kingdoms this guy
[1:20:49] that's powerless unless you give him the
[1:20:52] power
[1:20:55] oh no he no he anoints you
[1:21:00] satan anoints you just like god anoints
[1:21:02] you and sometimes you can't tell the
[1:21:04] difference
[1:21:05] right
[1:21:09] wow wow
[1:21:12] all right let's read number nine here
[1:21:14] real quick and then we'll we'll we're
[1:21:15] not going to get to let there be light i
[1:21:17] wish we could but we'll get to it
[1:21:18] wednesday night
[1:21:22] number nine that dead calvin sin did not
[1:21:24] start on the earth sin started in heaven
[1:21:26] lucifer the devil was a condemned
[1:21:29] creature for his disobedience before he
[1:21:31] ever struck the earth
[1:21:32] now remember it started in heaven he was
[1:21:35] cast out to earth
[1:21:37] and now remember there's a there's an
[1:21:39] idea
[1:21:40] in the denominational world that says
[1:21:42] that those
[1:21:44] spirits came down and
[1:21:47] you know became human beings
[1:21:50] they can't do that okay does everybody
[1:21:53] understand that they cannot
[1:21:56] you can be full of the devil but it's
[1:21:57] because you let him in
[1:21:59] right all right but he can't just take
[1:22:03] that's what i'm saying about you look at
[1:22:05] god and you and you see how god set this
[1:22:07] whole thing up
[1:22:10] that satan can influence you all he
[1:22:12] wants to but as long as god's in your
[1:22:14] soul he can't get you
[1:22:17] he can't have you he can't put his
[1:22:20] greasy hands now he can beat this thing
[1:22:22] up
[1:22:22] but he can't have that eternal person
[1:22:25] that's inside
[1:22:26] that's why the new birth is so important
[1:22:28] not just a feeling not just any motion
[1:22:30] not just i go to church every sunday
[1:22:33] but a real true revelation of what god's
[1:22:36] done for you
[1:22:37] in your soul and being that god is in
[1:22:39] your soul he's not going to deny the
[1:22:40] word
[1:22:43] never will he deny the word the word
[1:22:46] can't deny the word
[1:22:47] satan can sin began in heaven where
[1:22:52] god put the angels and so forth upon the
[1:22:54] same basis that he put
[1:22:56] human beings on
[1:23:00] so some people somebody asked me one
[1:23:02] time a long time ago said how in the
[1:23:03] world did angels fall they were holy
[1:23:05] created beings well now they didn't the
[1:23:06] bible never said they were holy beings
[1:23:10] the bible said some of them sang holy
[1:23:12] holy holy unto the lord
[1:23:14] but he put them on the same and see that
[1:23:17] makes god continuity that makes where
[1:23:19] that you read these scriptures
[1:23:22] especially down here a little bit
[1:23:23] further we're finished with that one
[1:23:26] let's go to jude 1 verse 6
[1:23:27] says and the angels which kept not their
[1:23:30] first estate but left their own
[1:23:32] habitation
[1:23:33] he hath reserved an everlasting change
[1:23:35] under darkness and to the judgment
[1:23:38] judgment of the great day everybody is
[1:23:42] going to be judged
[1:23:46] angels satan's already judged
[1:23:51] because he got cast out but who's going
[1:23:54] to judge him
[1:23:56] ah first corinthians let's let's skip
[1:24:00] that
[1:24:00] we'll read we'll read number ten first
[1:24:02] corinthians 6
[1:24:03] 3 do you not know that the saints shall
[1:24:06] judge the world
[1:24:08] and if the world shall be judged by you
[1:24:10] are you unworthy to judge the smallest
[1:24:12] matter
[1:24:13] know you not that you shall judge angels
[1:24:17] why would they need judging they're free
[1:24:20] moral agents just like me and you
[1:24:23] how much more things that pertain
[1:24:26] to this life amen
[1:24:30] now let's go back if you don't mind
[1:24:31] let's go back and read quote number 10
[1:24:32] then we'll close musicians get ready to
[1:24:34] come
[1:24:35] we'll we'll talk about the light because
[1:24:38] remember
[1:24:39] this is what i'm heading toward remember
[1:24:41] luis was talking about this the other
[1:24:42] night and i knew there was an answer to
[1:24:43] this
[1:24:44] because god told them god told them god
[1:24:47] in the beginning he said let there be
[1:24:49] light
[1:24:51] that was not the sun and the moon they
[1:24:53] were created on the fourth day
[1:24:55] this was the first day what is that like
[1:25:00] i'll tell you when i tell you wednesday
[1:25:02] night
[1:25:05] we'll do some paul harvey the rest of
[1:25:08] the story
[1:25:11] but it's real interesting though how
[1:25:13] that that's weaved into
[1:25:15] the creation and how that the prophet of
[1:25:18] god makes one quote
[1:25:19] and it clears the whole thing up because
[1:25:21] you think well the sun
[1:25:22] needs to be here and the moon needs to
[1:25:24] be here and now remember
[1:25:26] because on the third day plants started
[1:25:29] growing
[1:25:31] they need photosynthesis they need some
[1:25:33] kind of sunlight
[1:25:35] ah we'll see in just a little while
[1:25:37] wednesday night
[1:25:38] about 7 20 or 7 30.
[1:25:43] same bat channel same bat station
[1:25:46] right louise whatever that meant
[1:25:50] greatest battle ever fought do this and
[1:25:52] we'll be we'll be done
[1:25:56] now i believe the greatest battle that
[1:25:57] was ever fought is now ready to go in
[1:25:59] the action
[1:25:59] into action i believe that god has been
[1:26:02] selecting his soldiers
[1:26:03] i believe he's been dressing them
[1:26:05] training them and the battle front is
[1:26:07] now set
[1:26:08] getting ready to start this great first
[1:26:11] battle that was ever fought
[1:26:13] began in heaven when michael and his
[1:26:14] angels fought against lucifer and his
[1:26:16] angels
[1:26:17] it first started the first battle was in
[1:26:19] heaven so sin did not originate on
[1:26:22] earth it originated in heaven
[1:26:25] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[1:26:27] cast out of heaven to the earth
[1:26:29] and fell on human beings it didn't fall
[1:26:31] in them
[1:26:34] you say somebody's devil possessed you
[1:26:36] have to be careful with that
[1:26:40] now somebody can be completely um
[1:26:44] motivated but if that soul still there
[1:26:47] remember
[1:26:48] there's always a chance of salvation it
[1:26:51] doesn't matter how hideous
[1:26:53] adolf hitler could have been saved if he
[1:26:55] wanted to be
[1:26:57] remember the bible says only blaspheming
[1:27:00] the holy ghost there is no cure for that
[1:27:02] there is no
[1:27:03] there's no redemption for that everybody
[1:27:06] got that
[1:27:07] anything else you think of the worst
[1:27:08] murder you want to think of
[1:27:10] that soul is still before he dies it is
[1:27:13] able
[1:27:13] to be saved by god amen
[1:27:18] believe that if you want to i believe it
[1:27:20] everybody has a chance until that last
[1:27:22] breath comes
[1:27:23] except for one thing and that's
[1:27:26] blasphemed in the holy ghost
[1:27:27] look and then it was thrown down from
[1:27:29] heaven cast out of heaven to the earth
[1:27:31] and fell on human beings
[1:27:32] then the battle from angels became
[1:27:36] human battles
[1:27:40] because remember we're not
[1:27:43] fighting flesh and blood
[1:27:46] that's scripture but principalities and
[1:27:50] powers
[1:27:51] in high places we're not fighting as i
[1:27:55] said before let's not put somebody's
[1:27:57] name in this
[1:28:00] that you may know of that has turned
[1:28:02] against the word or turned against the
[1:28:03] message
[1:28:07] no it's that spirit that we're talking
[1:28:11] about
[1:28:12] we look at the characteristics of that
[1:28:14] other spirit and it can get on you
[1:28:19] folks have you not ever had a spirit get
[1:28:21] on you
[1:28:22] yeah it'll get on you
[1:28:26] but if you're a born-again child of god
[1:28:28] he can't touch your soul
[1:28:31] and i'll promise you one thing's for
[1:28:33] sure i don't care what battle you go
[1:28:35] through if you're a son and daughter of
[1:28:37] god
[1:28:38] as i said before god
[1:28:41] the bible tells us the footsteps of the
[1:28:43] righteous are ordered of the lord and
[1:28:45] until your time is up
[1:28:47] and if you're a child of god and god
[1:28:48] looks at you and says
[1:28:50] that's as far as i need you to go you
[1:28:52] ought to be pleased with that
[1:28:54] but he you will not go before then don't
[1:28:56] let the devil stand here and tell you
[1:28:58] yeah see i've had little things going on
[1:29:02] for the past couple weeks still got a
[1:29:03] little bit going on now but you know
[1:29:04] that little thing sits right here and
[1:29:05] goes you're gonna die
[1:29:09] and i told it something the other day
[1:29:11] and it left me alone for a little while
[1:29:13] you know what the bible says
[1:29:14] that the devil in the temptation of
[1:29:17] jesus what happened
[1:29:19] he was right there but remember the
[1:29:22] bible says
[1:29:22] satan left him for a season he didn't
[1:29:26] leave him forever
[1:29:27] he left even the almighty god in human
[1:29:29] flesh he was what sitting there buffing
[1:29:30] him but you know what
[1:29:33] if something ever comes in your mind and
[1:29:35] says you're dying
[1:29:37] i'm gonna kill you i'm gonna take your
[1:29:40] life
[1:29:41] no one thing's for sure that's not god
[1:29:45] your heavenly father your savior your
[1:29:48] redeemer would never come to you
[1:29:50] and say i'm gonna kill you he'll never
[1:29:53] come to you and so you all you do is say
[1:29:55] liar amen
[1:30:00] liar until my daddy's finished with me
[1:30:05] oh yeah we may go through problems
[1:30:08] but what is it for i thought the bible
[1:30:10] said it was for our perfection
[1:30:13] for our perfection so who wants to come
[1:30:16] to
[1:30:16] perfection we all do and satan came to
[1:30:19] destroy god's creation
[1:30:20] musicians come on what god had created
[1:30:23] to be for himself
[1:30:25] he had satan came to destroy this that's
[1:30:28] what his purpose was
[1:30:29] was to destroy it then the battle began
[1:30:32] here on earth
[1:30:33] and beginning us and has been raging
[1:30:37] ever since let's stand to our feet been
[1:30:40] raging
[1:30:42] ever since
[1:30:48] we look at what happened in the garden
[1:30:49] of eden that wasn't the first sin
[1:30:53] that was the first sin down here on
[1:30:55] earth right
[1:30:57] amen so god couldn't
[1:31:00] god god couldn't make the devil
[1:31:03] do these things but he created him
[1:31:06] perfect
[1:31:07] he created him beautiful knew what he
[1:31:09] was going to do but you know what i
[1:31:11] believe he looked at when he created
[1:31:12] lucifer i believe he looked at him he
[1:31:13] said look buddy
[1:31:15] you're my right-hand guy if you'll stay
[1:31:18] in your position
[1:31:19] and do what you're supposed to do and
[1:31:22] not exalt yourself above me
[1:31:25] i'm going to put you in a position that
[1:31:27] no one else is going to have but you
[1:31:31] but remember the devil couldn't stand
[1:31:32] that
[1:31:36] god knew it before he created him so you
[1:31:40] know what he had he already had the lamb
[1:31:41] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:31:43] up here in his mind
[1:31:44] he already had me and you preserved and
[1:31:46] every christian from the dawn of time
[1:31:48] till today
[1:31:49] he had us preserved right here
[1:31:53] i don't believe brother john i don't
[1:31:54] believe god didn't tell satan the whole
[1:31:56] story
[1:31:58] he told him what he needed you're my
[1:32:02] worship angel
[1:32:03] you're my anointed guy you're my right
[1:32:06] hand guy
[1:32:06] you can't create let me do the creating
[1:32:09] because remember
[1:32:10] when god's first son
[1:32:14] came on earth because remember the bible
[1:32:15] says adam was the first was the son of
[1:32:17] god
[1:32:18] amen what do you tell adam
[1:32:21] basically you take care of the earth
[1:32:24] i'll take care of heaven see
[1:32:26] satan couldn't do that so it couldn't be
[1:32:28] submissive because i believe adam was
[1:32:29] submissive i believe adam said oh
[1:32:31] i know you're my creator i know that i
[1:32:34] came from you
[1:32:35] see but satan didn't do that satan said
[1:32:37] i know i came from you but i'm a whole
[1:32:38] lot better than you are
[1:32:40] you see what the difference is
[1:32:43] watch the difference real quick before
[1:32:44] we close
[1:32:46] what's the difference i want you to chew
[1:32:48] on this to wednesday night what's the
[1:32:49] difference in these two scenarios
[1:32:51] here's moses
[1:32:55] here's moses moses is standing here he's
[1:32:58] got all these millions of people you've
[1:33:00] got all these problems and
[1:33:02] yada yada and here comes jethro which is
[1:33:05] his father-in-law
[1:33:06] right jethro walks up and says now moses
[1:33:11] it's just too much for one man to do
[1:33:14] why don't you get somebody to help you
[1:33:17] out here
[1:33:19] now listen god honored that by what took
[1:33:22] the spirit off of moses and put it on
[1:33:24] 70 different people to take care of the
[1:33:26] situation
[1:33:27] now what jethro do jethro said now moses
[1:33:30] you're taking too much on yourself right
[1:33:33] now
[1:33:35] out into the wilderness we come here
[1:33:36] comes nathan and cora the first thing
[1:33:38] they do they walk up and says moses you
[1:33:40] take too much on yourself
[1:33:42] same thing
[1:33:45] but look at the outcome god knew
[1:33:47] jethro's heart he was trying to help
[1:33:49] moses
[1:33:50] nathan and carl was trying to set up
[1:33:52] something that moses
[1:33:53] didn't need because they were going out
[1:33:57] here and they were talking amongst their
[1:33:58] they brought like 250. i've been reading
[1:34:00] it in the bible they brought like 250 of
[1:34:02] the best men
[1:34:03] the devil always gets the best men 250
[1:34:06] of the best men and they go
[1:34:08] moses you ain't the only man in the camp
[1:34:12] you see the difference though in the two
[1:34:14] scenarios it was almost exactly the same
[1:34:16] it was the approach your approach to god
[1:34:20] means all in the world everything in the
[1:34:23] world comes from that approach jethro
[1:34:25] approached him and said moses you're
[1:34:27] about to die up here
[1:34:28] you got you you're having a nervous
[1:34:30] breakdown because you got two million
[1:34:31] people trying to tell you what to do and
[1:34:34] get you some people let them help you
[1:34:35] we'll see nathan corbin the same way but
[1:34:36] dave and the court had in their heart
[1:34:38] that they were going to be
[1:34:40] say satan the same thing satan can't he
[1:34:42] can't get away from that cycle
[1:34:45] he wants to be just something better
[1:34:46] than what god's put on the earth
[1:34:48] that's right same thing with us he wants
[1:34:51] to be just a little bit better
[1:34:54] well god bless you love you with the
[1:34:55] love of the lord two spirits
[1:34:58] there's only two
[1:35:01] and if satan or if i'm sorry let's go
[1:35:03] back to lucifer if lucifer because that
[1:35:05] was his first name lucifer
[1:35:07] would have was created perfect if he
[1:35:09] would have stayed in his position
[1:35:11] he'd have been all right but god knew he
[1:35:14] could not stay in his position
[1:35:18] so therefore he couldn't just he
[1:35:19] couldn't stop him he let him be a free
[1:35:20] moral agent same way with the angels
[1:35:22] he said all right here's what we're
[1:35:24] going to do
[1:35:27] what did what hap what happened in the
[1:35:28] moses in nathan and chorus scenario
[1:35:31] god steps down he says um if you're with
[1:35:34] moses you need to get over here
[1:35:37] basically it's what he said moses said
[1:35:38] if you're with me get over here
[1:35:40] because what's going to happen to them
[1:35:42] nathan cora and their whole
[1:35:44] family the bible says they walked out
[1:35:47] from their tent he called them out moses
[1:35:49] called them out of their tent
[1:35:51] and rebuked them and told them said
[1:35:53] today
[1:35:55] you've made a choice and there's
[1:35:57] something will happen that's never
[1:35:58] happened before
[1:36:00] and the earth literally opened up and
[1:36:03] not just nathan and korra
[1:36:05] their whole family tent house and all
[1:36:09] went into the ground and shut up and as
[1:36:12] soon as it did
[1:36:14] god took fire off the sensor
[1:36:17] and killed them 250 people that were
[1:36:20] renowned men
[1:36:21] men that were of you know some kind of
[1:36:23] stature
[1:36:24] because what they rebelled against god
[1:36:28] there's your two spirits but they were
[1:36:30] so close
[1:36:31] they made us see the very late let's
[1:36:33] sing a song god bless you
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:38] [Applause]
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:48] because he lives
[1:36:52] all fear is gone
[1:36:58] because i know
[1:37:01] us i know he holds
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:14] [Music]
[1:37:18] you know god's only one can give life
[1:37:19] satan can't give life
[1:37:22] god's the only life giver there is
[1:37:25] and what you do with it is your choice
[1:37:30] but because somebody died on a cross
[1:37:35] god almighty in human flesh
[1:37:39] he wasn't going to trust the son to come
[1:37:41] down he wasn't going to trust another
[1:37:42] person
[1:37:43] no he came himself he said
[1:37:47] i'm going to take care of this mess i'm
[1:37:50] not going to send him
[1:37:51] i i've already had a right hand guy and
[1:37:53] he kind of messed up
[1:37:55] no i'm not going to send the right-hand
[1:37:56] guy i'm coming myself
[1:37:59] because i'm the only one that can stand
[1:38:02] on earth and say destroy this body
[1:38:04] and i'll raise it back up you can't say
[1:38:07] that
[1:38:08] i can't say that nobody can say that but
[1:38:11] god almighty
[1:38:13] he said you touch this body i'll raise
[1:38:16] it back up
[1:38:17] and not only raise it back up brother
[1:38:18] john i'm going to come back on the day
[1:38:19] of pentecost
[1:38:20] and i'm going to divide myself out

[1:38:26] buddy
[1:38:26] you're going to get really really weak
[1:38:28] you know if you you keep dividing
[1:38:30] yourself up like this you know

[1:38:37] you think i'm pretty rough i got 120
[1:38:41] just like me down there on earth now
[1:38:44] and i've got three thousand down there
[1:38:46] just like me now
[1:38:47] and i've got a bride in the end time
[1:38:49] that's just like me down there
[1:38:51] and we were put on this earth for a
[1:38:53] purpose is to destroy
[1:38:55] the effects of the devil now look we
[1:38:57] can't destroy the devil
[1:38:59] he gets destroyed in the lake of fire
[1:39:02] but we can destroy the effects of the
[1:39:03] devil that he has on me and you amen
[1:39:06] that's what we can destroy because he
[1:39:07] has no power thank you lord
[1:39:09] except what power we give it so go with
[1:39:13] god
[1:39:13] let's sing this one more time
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:17] and life is worth
[1:39:20] the living just because he lives sing it

[1:39:33] i can face tomorrow
[1:39:37] think about that because he lives
[1:39:43] all fear is gone
[1:39:46] [Music]
[1:39:49] because i know
[1:39:54] he holds my future
[1:39:59] and life is worth
[1:40:02] the living just because he lives
[1:40:10] live for god that's all we got folks
[1:40:14] live for god amen let's do our best
[1:40:18] even at our best we might fail but as i
[1:40:21] said before
[1:40:24] let's get our house and make sure it's
[1:40:26] all swept and garnished
[1:40:28] yes oh no that was back in
[1:40:29] sanctification i thought paul said i'd
[1:40:31] die
[1:40:31] daily there's a daily sweeping out of
[1:40:36] your house this house
[1:40:39] a daily sweeping out sometimes we have
[1:40:42] things that heap upon us and i promise
[1:40:45] you one thing for sure
[1:40:47] if you'll do what god said
[1:40:50] if you'll do what god said if you have a
[1:40:53] fault with your brother go to him
[1:40:56] if there's anything you know it
[1:41:01] i don't have to know it brother dale
[1:41:02] don't have to know it you know it
[1:41:04] i know the things i do because i live
[1:41:06] with me
[1:41:08] i don't know brother ryan i don't sit in
[1:41:10] a chicken truck with you every day
[1:41:12] but god does and there's a
[1:41:16] there's a holy spirit that's there sure
[1:41:19] we know what's inside of us
[1:41:20] if i was thinking about this and i want
[1:41:21] to continue a little bit further on
[1:41:23] there's an
[1:41:23] anointing brother dale's talking about
[1:41:26] different ones
[1:41:27] everybody's talking about there's an
[1:41:28] anointing what you do with it
[1:41:32] that's why when we pray now right when
[1:41:34] we pray
[1:41:35] song leaders when you come back and you
[1:41:36] pray when i pray with you i say god
[1:41:39] let this brother use that anointing
[1:41:42] that he is anointed with see he's not
[1:41:45] anointed to preach
[1:41:47] in that situation he's anointed to come
[1:41:49] out here
[1:41:51] and bring that anointing of worship to
[1:41:52] you to what to clear back
[1:41:55] the fog to clear back the fog
[1:41:59] i read a quote yesterday where brother
[1:42:01] brown said he said when sin happened in
[1:42:03] the garden he said there was a fog came
[1:42:05] on the earth
[1:42:07] you remember there was a holy ghost veil
[1:42:09] over adam and eve they were naked didn't
[1:42:10] know didn't know anything about that
[1:42:12] and all of a sudden what happened there
[1:42:14] in the garden of eden
[1:42:16] brother brown said there was a fog and
[1:42:17] even a fog came over
[1:42:19] adam's mind
[1:42:22] [Music]
[1:42:24] a fog why because the holy ghost had
[1:42:26] lifted off the earth
[1:42:28] because remember that holy ghost didn't
[1:42:29] appear back on the earth in human beings
[1:42:31] until jesus came back on earth amen then
[1:42:34] now we got that here but there's still
[1:42:36] that fog and i believe that fog is
[1:42:38] lifting
[1:42:40] i believe we're going to come to a place
[1:42:42] listen god is going to have preeminence
[1:42:46] he will not take second best
[1:42:50] he created you to be who you are
[1:42:55] but you got to make a choice
[1:42:58] i challenge you to read your bible just
[1:43:00] a little bit more than you did before
[1:43:03] listen to one more tape than you
[1:43:05] listened to before
[1:43:06] listen to one more sermon to brother
[1:43:08] dale that you didn't listen to before
[1:43:10] i challenge you to do that and say god
[1:43:14] i need an answer we all have questions
[1:43:18] god i need an answer on this right here
[1:43:21] how many times have you asked him
[1:43:25] and the preacher walk out here or you
[1:43:28] turn a tape on and you need an
[1:43:29] answer from god and there's william
[1:43:32] branham from
[1:43:33] 60 years ago
[1:43:37] he says oh i see in a congregation you
[1:43:39] brother you're struggling with this
[1:43:40] problem
[1:43:42] and it's you and you're not sitting
[1:43:45] there
[1:43:46] but god knows it god knew it before the
[1:43:49] foundation of the world how many times
[1:43:52] have you been listening to tate and
[1:43:53] brother brown say
[1:43:54] all of you that have a problem he's he
[1:43:56] said if you need prayers to raise your
[1:43:58] hand and as soon as mine went up the
[1:43:59] other day he said
[1:44:00] god bless you brother i mean it was it
[1:44:03] was just like he knew it was me
[1:44:05] i just went like this god bless you
[1:44:07] there brother you see what i mean
[1:44:10] listen the spirit of god has not left
[1:44:12] this earth
[1:44:14] the spirit of prophecy has not left this
[1:44:16] earth the spirit of the
[1:44:18] of healing has not left this earth
[1:44:22] god takes his man but he never takes his
[1:44:25] spirit
[1:44:26] that same spirit is for me and you to
[1:44:28] take hold of
[1:44:29] read your bible pray and study more than
[1:44:31] you've ever done before because we need
[1:44:34] it because you know what satan is not
[1:44:36] out there
[1:44:39] sometimes you can smell his stinking
[1:44:41] breath
[1:44:43] i don't know about you he said oh the
[1:44:45] devil don't get that close to me well
[1:44:46] pray for me
[1:44:48] because sometimes you can smell his
[1:44:50] breath come right over the side of you
[1:44:51] and say hey
[1:44:52] i'll get you
[1:44:57] you're done for i'll take you out of
[1:45:00] this world
[1:45:02] and then you you just look over and say
[1:45:04] okay
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:06] but my daddy over here he holds
[1:45:09] everything in his hand
[1:45:10] [Music]
[1:45:12] you don't you hold nothing
[1:45:16] you have no power please use that
[1:45:19] sometime
[1:45:21] and watch him he'll move away he'll give
[1:45:23] you some peace
[1:45:25] not satan but god will give you some
[1:45:27] peace when satan moves away
[1:45:28] because i know he bombards us every day
[1:45:31] of our life
[1:45:32] you know why
[1:45:36] i'm gonna give you a secret you know why
[1:45:38] because he feels that same anointing
[1:45:41] that he felt on jesus when he was
[1:45:44] combating him
[1:45:45] in the desert and combating him on the
[1:45:47] earth
[1:45:48] he feels that same spirit brother ryan
[1:45:49] because we're not down here as babies
[1:45:51] anymore
[1:45:52] we're right up here waiting for that
[1:45:54] headstone which was jesus christ
[1:45:55] himself so satan feels that brother
[1:45:58] louise and he's not running from us
[1:46:00] though he's so bold
[1:46:01] he's right there in our face
[1:46:06] but he cannot win there's nowhere in the
[1:46:10] bible satan wins anything
[1:46:13] so if we believe the word of god take
[1:46:16] that with you
[1:46:18] use that against him this thing's a
[1:46:24] sword
[1:46:28] it's a lightsaber better than any
[1:46:30] lightsaber that anybody else could make
[1:46:34] hey man harrison this doesn't have
[1:46:35] anything to do with lightsaber and star
[1:46:38] wars
[1:46:39] no this thing right here
[1:46:43] will cut you and do surgery
[1:46:47] and take out that meanness take out that
[1:46:50] whatever you want to call it he'll take
[1:46:52] that right out and never leave a scar
[1:46:56] that's how fast that thing is bro john
[1:46:59] god i got this problem
[1:47:03] and you go that didn't even hurt
[1:47:06] that's what that two-edged sword will do
[1:47:08] that word oh boy when it cuts though
[1:47:10] but when he takes that thing out see
[1:47:14] that's what we all need to be working on
[1:47:15] is god take this sword
[1:47:19] because it's the little things the
[1:47:20] little foxes that spoil the vine you
[1:47:22] shouldn't be having
[1:47:23] listen if you're not born again you've
[1:47:25] got big problems
[1:47:26] but if you're born again you've still
[1:47:28] got problems
[1:47:32] but you've overcome you've overcome the
[1:47:35] world you've
[1:47:36] overcome the devil you've overcome all
[1:47:37] of his imps you've overcome
[1:47:39] every one of those two hundred thousand
[1:47:41] thousand demons that have been released
[1:47:44] on me and you to drive us
[1:47:48] what back to our homeland which is the
[1:47:50] word of god
[1:47:52] not back us to an earthly home no we're
[1:47:54] going to have that in a thousand years
[1:47:56] or more we'll have an earthly home here
[1:47:58] amen because john saw the new city
[1:48:00] coming down out of heaven
[1:48:02] we're not going to live on a cloud we're
[1:48:05] going to live right here because we have
[1:48:06] conquered
[1:48:07] amen and took over satan's
[1:48:10] god bless you i'm sorry let's bow our
[1:48:13] heads
[1:48:14] to heavenly father we pray today lord
