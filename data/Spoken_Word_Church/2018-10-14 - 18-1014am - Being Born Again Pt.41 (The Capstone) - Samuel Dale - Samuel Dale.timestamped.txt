[2:13] revelation of it in Jesus Christ's name
[2:16] we pray amen
[2:19] first Corinthians we reverse 1 through
[2:23] 15 moreover brethren I would not that
[2:28] you should be ignorant how that all our
[2:30] fathers were under the cloud and all
[2:33] passed through the sea and did all eat
[2:43] in the same spiritual meat
[2:56] but with many of them God was not well
[3:00] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[3:02] wilderness neither be ye idolaters as
[3:16] were some of them as it is written the
[3:19] people sat down to eat and drink and
[3:22] rose up to play neither let us tempt
[3:35] Christ as some of them also tempted and
[3:38] were destroyed of serpents now all these
[3:51] things happen to them for examples that
[3:54] they are written for our admonition upon
[3:57] whom the hands of the world are come
[4:07] there has no temptation taken you but
[4:12] such as is common to man but God is
[4:16] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[4:18] tempted above that ye are able but with
[4:23] the temptation also make a way of escape
[4:27] that you may be able to bear it I speak
[4:38] as wise man JG what I say God bless you
[4:45] visit the brothers in the pack praise
[4:58] the Lord Amen god bless
[5:24] god bless you this morning I trust
[5:27] everyone's doing well I'm gonna try not
[5:29] to take too much times take give time
[5:32] for the word amen praise God a few
[5:35] months ago
[5:38] this is a church that we've we've
[5:40] actually started helping out in Honduras
[5:44] about two years ago when I was there we
[5:49] helped start the process of this church
[5:52] building and this brother Eric Gallo who
[5:55] is the brother who we helped buy some
[5:58] tires for his truck or if you remember
[6:00] him this is his church but this is the
[6:02] church that they started this is the way
[6:04] it was pretty much in December last
[6:06] December when I left it and so I told
[6:12] brother Dale and I told some brother
[6:14] Wade and and we wanted to help them put
[6:19] a roof on the church because really I'm
[6:22] supposed to go down there in December
[6:23] help dedicate the building with them and
[6:27] but they said I listen all we need is a
[6:31] roof he never asked me for a month
[6:33] before money or anything I just wanted
[6:35] to help them out you know and so I asked
[6:37] brother Dale and and and then brother
[6:39] they of course asked you all and they've
[6:41] you all were in agreement so so if they
[6:44] could put but but the next slide
[6:46] this is how the way it looked pretty
[6:48] much when I left there in December go
[6:51] ahead next next next all right so when
[6:57] we sent them the money
[6:59] this is they immediately started the
[7:01] process of the putting the roof on the
[7:03] church immediately
[7:05] and I'll show you something at the end
[7:07] after in just a moment
[7:10] but brother Eric he's so he's so
[7:12] detailed with what he does and this is a
[7:15] brother that really he he shows what the
[7:19] money is being used for and I really
[7:20] really appreciate young brother really
[7:23] young brother but yeah he's very
[7:25] responsible so next next
[7:30] the money that we sent them he was able
[7:33] to have leftover also to be able to pay
[7:35] some of the workers for labour so that
[7:38] was wonderful
[7:39] amen next next all right so here I
[7:45] believe it's complete right there it's a
[7:47] metal roof and they were gonna go with a
[7:51] wooden type first but then that was
[7:54] gonna be a little bit too much more more
[7:56] money so they decided to go with metal
[7:58] and it was a little cheaper so
[7:59] everything worked out next this is the
[8:04] inside now they have a dirt floor
[8:07] but he said that's okay we can still
[8:09] have service there as long as there's a
[8:10] roof over our head so next next next in
[8:18] this church I've been there it's in the
[8:22] middle of nowhere pretty much so yeah
[8:27] very nice view if you go back that way
[8:30] that's that's it's another little town
[8:32] that's where they were actually meeting
[8:33] the town was called Agua Blanca and they
[8:36] were meeting in a loss in a sister's
[8:38] house which I'll show here in just a
[8:40] moment
[8:40] next next all right so this is this is
[8:47] actually when he gave me the this is the
[8:52] the the materials and things that they
[8:55] were gonna buy and he said brother Luis
[8:57] we actually made it to in the name of
[8:59] spoken word Church at the top so the
[9:02] everything that the whole thing is
[9:04] actually made out and spoken word church
[9:06] amen and you know I didn't ask him to do
[9:09] that he just did that and that is uh is
[9:15] in their money yeah that's in their
[9:17] money and I believe in their money which
[9:20] is uh impede us is Colin Peters it's
[9:23] about 23 and Peeta's to a dollar that's
[9:26] how that's how their money is next next
[9:31] and that's the whole thing there was
[9:33] some other there was some videos there I
[9:36] don't think everything was shown here
[9:38] there it is okay all right this is a
[9:40] sister the sisters house that they were
[9:42] they were
[9:43] but I don't know they got the volume up
[9:45] or not all right
[10:17] she's she's saying thank you very much
[10:20] for the offering that was given she said
[10:22] I really appreciate you all supporting
[10:26] us and she said I want to see sister
[10:28] Christine brother Lewis again and when
[10:30] they come we'll have coffee ready for
[10:31] them and they said but we really
[10:34] appreciate you all and we are praying
[10:36] for you is what she says amen and this
[10:39] is another sister at the church they're
[10:40] just saying she wants to thank for the
[10:46] offering that was given for the offer
[10:49] for the church and then now we have a
[10:52] little place that we can actually call a
[10:54] church we take things for granted Saints
[10:58] we have these air conditioner and
[10:59] buildings and all these things and these
[11:01] people just with a building with just a
[11:06] roof on their head they're they're
[11:07] satisfied with that amen and this is one
[11:09] more
[11:25] so he's saying the same thing thank you
[11:28] very much for the offering that you was
[11:29] given to the for the church so that's
[11:33] pretty much it and I thought that those
[11:35] that those what I was going to show at
[11:37] the end was those two where the
[11:39] materials was being bought but I had
[11:41] that it I had that sort of at the
[11:43] beginning but I thought that was
[11:45] interesting that he did that you pray
[11:46] for them and pray for us the Lord
[11:48] willing we'll be there in December we
[11:51] got all of us are gonna be going this
[11:53] time
[11:53] my wife my daughter's want to give them
[11:56] an experience I believe I believe it'd
[11:59] be good for them you know I believe
[12:00] young people that it'd be nice for them
[12:02] to get out there in third world
[12:03] countries and see what things are really
[12:05] like because sometimes we take for
[12:06] granted what we have here you go to
[12:09] those places and be like wait a second
[12:12] things are there's things that are more
[12:14] important than just that you know then
[12:16] looking at yourself you know so a man
[12:18] you pray for the people and pray pray
[12:20] for us god bless you all
[12:22] [Applause]
[12:36] the stand
[12:38] amen amen
[12:42] appreciate that brother movies yeah we
[12:46] know that there is a great need in the
[12:50] world like that in the countries but a
[12:52] little bit of traveling I've done you
[12:54] learn a lot when you go so just pray for
[12:57] them that the Lord would bless them and
[12:59] take care of them and you know and help
[13:01] them along the way all right we are to
[13:04] going to start helping them financially
[13:08] but now not helping I want this
[13:11] understood he doesn't want any money to
[13:15] come to him for his financial life I
[13:19] don't know the best way to say it but he
[13:22] does a lot of traveling he does a lot of
[13:25] missionary traveling so what we're going
[13:27] to do is start sending to them the Lord
[13:30] willing this month or ever when they get
[13:32] it set to send to them like a hundred
[13:35] and fifty dollars a month that's not a
[13:37] lot of money but it does or without it
[13:39] helps and gives them an opportunity to
[13:42] do and that way he can travel more and
[13:45] feel more free on his traveling so you
[13:48] know just remember that just pray the
[13:50] Lord would bless we're glad to have all
[13:52] of our visitors with us today and we say
[13:55] to you welcome you've come here one time
[13:57] your visitor two times you're part of us
[13:59] so you know we appreciate you coming and
[14:01] being with us and prayer the Lord would
[14:03] bless you now you remember the
[14:06] announcements remember the festival will
[14:10] be on the 27th so remember that and just
[14:14] keep that in in mind and then to
[14:17] remember that the fellowship meeting
[14:20] will be at brother Tony's next month you
[14:24] know they say I'm not getting loud
[14:26] enough or something
[14:28] okay alright but it'll be at brother
[14:31] Tony's next month so remember that any
[14:34] other announcements that we have we are
[14:39] we generally miss something but anyhow
[14:42] so let's turn to our scriptures in first
[14:44] Peter that we've been at for quite a
[14:46] while and right not this coming
[14:54] Wednesday he will be here the next
[14:57] Wednesday ministering for us and then
[14:59] taking a couple of days off hunting and
[15:01] all so to remember that all right father
[15:03] we thank you for this day in your grace
[15:05] and your love Lord we thank you for all
[15:07] things and we just ask you Lord to guide
[15:11] each one of us and dine understanding
[15:13] that we may walk in the light of your
[15:15] grace we praise your great name and just
[15:18] honor you Lord with all that we could
[15:20] honor and father just to see pictures of
[15:23] these places that they don't have
[15:26] anything but to see this a few dollars
[15:28] will help them to be able to at least be
[15:32] in out of the weather and the things and
[15:35] and they can do a lot Lord with what
[15:37] little bit we can send and we ask you to
[15:40] just bless and guide each one you know
[15:42] the needs around the world and just
[15:44] that's your life shine in our hearts
[15:46] remember all the sick among us member
[15:49] the island sister Anna there today and
[15:51] just be with them it open our hearts
[15:54] that we may see you we love you in Jesus
[15:56] name
[16:03] first Peter
[16:07] verse 22 23 seeing ya purified your
[16:11] souls in obeying the truth through the
[16:13] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[16:15] Brethren see that you love one another
[16:17] with a pure heart being born again not
[16:20] of corruptible seed but of incorruptible
[16:22] by the Word of God which liveth and
[16:25] abideth for ever I know you they didn't
[16:28] give it to them but we'll just bypass
[16:31] that one and go to one more scripture
[16:34] that's very familiar with all of us in
[16:37] the message revelations 10 7 but in the
[16:41] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[16:43] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[16:47] of God should be finished as he had
[16:50] declared to his servants the prophets
[16:52] you may be seated the Lord at his
[16:54] blessing to the reading of the word
[17:03] try to pick up where we were Wednesday
[17:05] and make sure that we're understood and
[17:08] just rain to the thought you know and
[17:12] keep our hearts and minds in in to the
[17:16] area that we're talking about but I like
[17:18] that scripture called it said in the
[17:20] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[17:21] when he shall begin to sound well the
[17:25] reason I love it so much because it
[17:26] separates people that separates time it
[17:31] separates all of the things to work that
[17:35] we can follow the day in the hour that
[17:38] we're living all right now we believe
[17:41] that God sent us a prophet that's the
[17:44] part we do believe you know and we honor
[17:46] that part to believe in that he sent a
[17:49] prophet to us all right but to send a
[17:51] prophet remember if he just sends a
[17:55] prophet without a message that would be
[17:58] contrary to Scripture code it always in
[18:01] the Bible all the way through when a
[18:03] prophet comes on the scene he may have a
[18:05] judgment you know he may have a
[18:08] condemnation called it always is it
[18:11] would be put to that point you know that
[18:13] he'd bring down and it's always been a
[18:15] judgment to a nation when a prophet
[18:17] comes to that nation all right
[18:20] but also remember now even though you
[18:23] you think about the judgment of all of
[18:26] the things of a prophet coming to that
[18:28] nation that being condemned but also
[18:30] remember he's not just coming to condemn
[18:35] alright oh that's that's the point I
[18:37] want you to follow with me through the
[18:40] the message this morning that it's not
[18:43] to say well you know see we think about
[18:46] well god sent a prophet down here and he
[18:48] brought her judgment to that people but
[18:50] why did he send that prophet why did he
[18:55] send him I mean he just said well they
[18:57] said him to judge them you know the
[18:59] condemned woman all I can't now there
[19:01] was always somebody there at that
[19:05] position our place our country our dear
[19:09] they would always a group of people
[19:11] there too
[19:15] receive a message these so then his
[19:18] message would not be just see we think
[19:21] of right around him we say oh he just
[19:22] come to condemn America well that's true
[19:25] but remember that I've always tried to
[19:28] say to you he sent him to America
[19:32] because he knew one time there was not a
[19:36] place in the world that a prophet could
[19:39] go and do what this prophet has done all
[19:43] right are you following me how do you
[19:45] see when he sent him to America he sent
[19:47] him where the money would be for number
[19:49] one all right they would be money in
[19:52] America and we know neither sending him
[19:54] to to China or some country or anything
[19:57] like that to and expect a backup of that
[20:03] you know in any way to help and and you
[20:07] know to have the money to be able to
[20:08] support it came to America if that's
[20:11] just one point now listen we'll get to
[20:13] the other second he sent him to America
[20:15] because he knew there would be people
[20:17] here that we would have the financial
[20:20] ability to be able to send this message
[20:23] to the world all right so it's all not
[20:27] just judgment that's what I want you to
[20:30] to think about it's not just judgment
[20:33] because of sin and the profit that's
[20:36] true I mean there it is a point that he
[20:38] judge the nation is judged all right but
[20:42] it's still true that a point that were
[20:44] the nation should be great and like i
[20:49] said financially the message came to
[20:51] america we had the ability to and still
[20:54] how to be able to send this message to
[20:56] the world what if it to come to some of
[20:58] the other countries what if you were
[21:01] living in some of the countries that
[21:03] i've even been in to her you know the
[21:06] economy was so poor until you know i
[21:08] mean the poor little kids in jamaica
[21:11] when i went during 93 it amazed me to
[21:15] see that that what we call today in our
[21:19] schools when you're going a little
[21:21] special trip you know that you'd take it
[21:24] with the kids and care them on a little
[21:25] little trip out you know what a trip in
[21:28] Jamaica was you know what school trip in
[21:31] Jamaica was to go to a McDonald now not
[21:38] to get nothing to eat
[21:40] they didn't take him there
[21:42] on our little school trips for them to
[21:44] get somebody just to go and walk through
[21:47] the place and how would you like to have
[21:50] been born like that what if we were born
[21:53] in these foreign countries instead of
[21:55] being born where we're at alright so get
[21:58] the point now so then that makes it to
[22:00] where that there's many things to
[22:02] consider but then the next part is to
[22:05] one thing the bride of America now not
[22:10] it we're the only part of the bride this
[22:12] all the way around the world but the
[22:14] bride in America would be able to put
[22:17] the money forth to do the financial work
[22:20] the printings are doing and the Bible
[22:23] tells you know that that it was needed
[22:26] that that be done and then you could
[22:28] send the message around the world but
[22:30] what about a wonderful opportunity that
[22:32] you and I have that the message came to
[22:36] America it came to our part and we have
[22:39] the ability to to read it and study it
[22:43] in and all like that because it's a
[22:45] wonderful opportunity your to consider
[22:48] that but see then I caught it said in
[22:50] the days of the voice of the seventh
[22:52] angel when he begins to Sion
[22:57] but now remember financially it helps
[23:01] everything like that but remember when a
[23:04] prophet comes he brings a message
[23:10] there's always a message that'll follow
[23:13] all right see then that's why it says in
[23:16] the days of the voice of the seventh
[23:18] angel alright there's a message to come
[23:22] for you so well yeah we believe that but
[23:24] do we have it in the correct order of
[23:26] understanding because if we don't we'll
[23:29] get it massively confused see you got to
[23:33] get it lined up to work that the
[23:36] scripture then will declare who we are
[23:38] what we are what he's brought to us
[23:40] what's taking place all right so we can
[23:44] see the financial part is going we've
[23:46] done that we've seen it we've had the
[23:48] ability to do that all right but now
[23:51] what is the message like one country
[23:55] said you know better said you've told us
[23:58] about the prophet but said now tell us
[24:02] what he taught now see this message was
[24:06] a Gentile prophet which meant it would
[24:09] go to the entire world
[24:11] right it would be just to America
[24:15] the message would be to the entire world
[24:17] all right because that would bring it
[24:20] forth and it's to bring a people is to
[24:24] follow this message and that's what
[24:26] we'll get to in a minute to try to just
[24:28] to continue on what we were talking
[24:30] about Wednesday night of not in the
[24:33] years of preparation but when he begins
[24:36] to say on what about it what about the
[24:41] sounding of this endtime message to work
[24:44] that we could see Jesus Christ living
[24:47] among us and that a wonderful thing to
[24:51] think about to see and realize this
[24:54] message is the entire message
[24:57] there's not another message to come
[24:59] there's not another time or anything
[25:01] happening it's this message that would
[25:04] come forth to bring us the the
[25:06] understanding to bring a lot of things
[25:08] to an end to where that we could rejoice
[25:12] in what we've seen I rejoice in what
[25:14] I've seen so far but I'm looking forward
[25:18] to a change of the body I'm looking
[25:19] forward to many things that's in the
[25:22] message this problem
[25:23] to us alright but yet I mean I'm happy
[25:27] about what has been sent but in the days
[25:30] of the voice of the seventh angel see
[25:33] there's got to be a voice to have a
[25:37] messenger sent what good is the
[25:39] messengers in if he doesn't have a voice
[25:41] or if he's so far behind he can't
[25:43] understand you remember there in the
[25:45] Bible one time it always kind of tickled
[25:46] me but you remember in the Bible one
[25:48] time they would get out turn they was
[25:50] fighting and and everything and they
[25:52] wanted the king and all to get word or
[25:54] what back in the country you know so
[25:57] this man says well all right let me go
[26:01] they said no he said you don't know what
[26:03] to tell him
[26:04] so we got this one ready got everything
[26:07] to tell him you know yeah and I won't
[26:09] let me go then he said well let's go
[26:12] well he just took off running you
[26:16] remember the prophet rut called it
[26:17] running without a message go see when
[26:19] the guy got there he didn't know what to
[26:21] tell him when he come running in and
[26:23] asked him said what is this what did
[26:25] that he said I don't know all i know i
[26:28] don't know
[26:29] well said Disko said I am uh-huh was he
[26:33] finally come the guy that had run that
[26:36] had the message well I we heard a lot of
[26:38] messages across the land there's a lot
[26:41] of things that people have said but
[26:44] worth the message we thank God for
[26:48] people like all Roberts Billy Graham the
[26:51] great people that brought the flames in
[26:55] their day and things like that but
[26:56] where's their message well their message
[27:02] is Jesus Christ living yeah but what is
[27:05] their message what does it take you to
[27:10] and the profit I'll give it to you in a
[27:12] minute the kind of paraphrasing where
[27:14] the Prophet said it like this he said
[27:17] you know if we we think that we're in
[27:22] the end time then there is a message to
[27:24] be brought where's the message if he
[27:27] didn't bring it
[27:28] where's it to be all right what is the
[27:31] message he said well the message is this
[27:35] that now what is the message
[27:40] this profit brought us a message for the
[27:43] end time what is that message right what
[27:50] do you think about this message I
[27:51] believe it's Hebrews 13:8 I believe it's
[27:55] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[27:57] and forever all right I believe that's
[28:00] what the message is but yet to stay in
[28:03] the profit is saying to stay with the
[28:05] same message that you've brought he said
[28:13] the signs and wonders even following it
[28:16] you take signs and wonders and all like
[28:19] that going forth and you stay with the
[28:21] same message what good is it there's
[28:24] always a progressive in your message
[28:27] it's never to standstill
[28:29] all right you say well what do you mean
[28:31] by that all right what if what if it
[28:33] started happening what are you going to
[28:35] say about these churches around the land
[28:37] that denominational churches and people
[28:39] that are having great moves great signs
[28:44] and wonders are taking place among a lot
[28:46] of the religious world are you gonna say
[28:49] that's of God if it's any form to her
[28:53] that it would be of God we could say yes
[28:56] we believe it's of God but what about
[28:58] the message see if they're gonna take us
[29:02] back to the same old Trinitarian ideas
[29:05] they don't matter about the signs and
[29:07] wonders that's where the end time is
[29:09] going to be so deceiving because those
[29:11] things are going to start happening
[29:14] signs and wonders will start happening
[29:17] around the world very shortly from now I
[29:20] don't know how long and he never been no
[29:22] worry to me about how long but I've
[29:24] always said it happened could have
[29:27] always believed it we're not gonna run
[29:29] out of here and in this thing up with
[29:31] just how glory hallelujah we're in the
[29:33] rapture we're goin home you know no
[29:35] there's got to be something take place
[29:38] and we're in the very hour that those
[29:41] things now can start transpiring you let
[29:46] these things start tightening down just
[29:48] a little bit on us
[29:49] you let the that the part happening of
[29:52] that we know that
[29:54] in our that we're living in what is what
[29:56] the world is capable of you let that
[29:58] start happening and when you do you're
[30:01] gonna get serious right when you get
[30:06] hungry you get serious well brother
[30:09] Taylor you thank you that we go that's
[30:12] what your prophet say it now right
[30:16] that's what he said about it so then we
[30:19] stay with what he had to say about it he
[30:21] wasn't a doomsday preacher that's what I
[30:24] mean so he knew that with the fact that
[30:27] it would be if the enemy comes in he
[30:30] knew the Bible said what that the spirit
[30:33] would raise up a standard I'm not
[30:36] worried about it I'm not concerned with
[30:38] it I mean if they come in here right now
[30:40] and close us out
[30:42] close down take your homes do everything
[30:44] what are you gonna do well they can't do
[30:50] that we're in America
[30:51] oh don't life so much they can take
[30:56] anything they want to any time they want
[30:59] to the grace of God is what's keeping us
[31:02] to this day
[31:04] right and see then that that goes with
[31:08] the message because we've got to become
[31:11] the very message to talk about a message
[31:14] that a prophet Brian it's wonderful
[31:17] we've sent it to the world we've
[31:21] educated the world with this message
[31:24] until ever nice and had it everybody has
[31:27] it everybody in the world had an
[31:30] opportunity to this message now through
[31:33] one form or the other see we've educated
[31:35] them as I say into that but still have
[31:39] we taken it that to our hearts to what
[31:42] it is
[31:46] do we really believe that in the days of
[31:48] the voice of the seventh angel then it
[31:50] says the mystery that doesn't say
[31:52] mysteries are reaching Bible that says
[31:54] mystery singular because there's just
[31:57] one mystery and that's Jesus Christ the
[32:01] same yesterday today and forever that's
[32:03] the mystery all right that's all that it
[32:06] takes all the mysteries to make that
[32:08] mystery manifest that's why it says in
[32:10] the days of the voice he's got one
[32:13] message to bring you remember the
[32:16] Prophet he said not in the in the years
[32:18] we'll read it in a minute in the years
[32:20] of preparation but when he begins to
[32:23] sound a message your prophet knew that
[32:29] when he brought this message to America
[32:32] that it would be a condemnation to the
[32:35] land as I said a moment ago but at the
[32:38] same time there's a group of people to
[32:41] receive it it's not condemnation to
[32:45] those that receive it come on this
[32:49] message is not that's what I've always
[32:51] heard the ministers preached they
[32:52] preached a damnation message maybe you
[32:54] call it her condemnation message are
[32:57] downing the people for what they are
[32:59] it's not gonna do no good you could say
[33:03] all you want to it's not gonna change it
[33:06] you're not going to change the people of
[33:09] the world by preaching any form of a
[33:12] doctrinal priest Jesus Christ and let
[33:16] him be made manifest I got so tickled
[33:20] the other day I just really liked I'm
[33:23] not one to preach on this and that of
[33:25] closed line type of do I believe in it I
[33:28] believe in living right and doing right
[33:29] but I believe in because you're the new
[33:32] birth is there and I'd priest not preach
[33:35] nothing you know to say anything about
[33:37] it for a long time and I I just
[33:39] mentioned it in the message the next
[33:42] Sunday I saw manifest by somebody here
[33:48] the fact that it wouldn't don't change
[33:50] anything they wasn't gonna change
[33:55] anything for me do that someone do it
[33:58] you don't believe in living right no I
[34:00] don't believe in living right I don't I
[34:04] believe in being born again and that'll
[34:07] take care of it you get born again it'll
[34:10] take care of the higher the dress the
[34:12] clothes the me and the thing it'll take
[34:15] care of that if we get born again that
[34:19] was what the Prophet was bringing to us
[34:21] he was preaching Jesus Christ you said
[34:23] yeah but he hollered out about this and
[34:25] hollered out about that
[34:26] sure he did cause he was a messenger to
[34:28] the world his message went to the entire
[34:32] world so he had to condemn all right but
[34:38] to the bride he said you don't have to
[34:41] tell her but one time that's what he's
[34:48] saying
[34:49] he says you don't have to tell her but
[34:51] one time since she line up why because
[34:58] it's Christ in you there's the day that
[35:03] we're living and the message is being
[35:05] sounding for the Prophet brought us a
[35:08] message it was a message of salvation it
[35:12] was a message of deliverance we've tried
[35:16] our best to explain for 40 something
[35:18] years about the end time and the way it
[35:21] is that you you might as well forget
[35:25] trying to convert the world you can't do
[35:29] that it's only those that are
[35:33] convertible is the ones that's going to
[35:37] be saved
[35:38] see that's the message the Prophet
[35:41] brought the Prophet brought us a message
[35:43] to let us realize who we are as I said
[35:48] sure he condemned the world okay
[35:50] he's a judgment to the world right but
[35:52] he's not a judgment to the bride this
[35:59] message is not judgment to the bride
[36:01] this message is a release
[36:05] this message is to bring us to a
[36:08] position to see who we are and by
[36:11] realizing who we are it will take care
[36:16] of the rest of it the words the
[36:19] preachers preaching who we are they want
[36:21] to preach about what this is what that
[36:23] is no see get born again that's the
[36:30] message we need to begin to sound he
[36:35] preached in his early ministry to try to
[36:38] turn us back to the faith of the
[36:40] father's right because that was Malachi
[36:44] 4 was to bring the message to turn us
[36:49] back to the faith of the fathers that we
[36:52] could see Jesus Christ living among us
[36:56] but you see that's what all the people
[36:58] can receive they can receive that but
[37:01] they think that's what they think see
[37:03] then they think well you know it's just
[37:05] dress and closing huh all that is
[37:08] wonderful if you're born again but you
[37:14] can have you can have your address
[37:16] dragged into tracks out and the hard
[37:18] dragging that out that ain't gonna
[37:20] convert you but to get the revelation of
[37:24] Jesus Christ into your soul will take
[37:26] care of the hair and the dress and
[37:28] conversion - that's the message that has
[37:31] been brought this message was not as I
[37:34] say I won't that point it was not a
[37:36] condemnation message that's what it's
[37:39] been talk to the people that's all it's
[37:42] been talk to the people this
[37:43] condemnation it's not condemnation
[37:49] it's deliverance its deliverance to set
[37:57] us free from ourselves our own ideas and
[38:03] our thoughts of what we are
[38:07] what if you get everybody to start
[38:10] shouting glory hallelujah and all kind
[38:12] of thing you said brother Dale you
[38:14] wouldn't love to see this world and a
[38:16] resort yeah I'd love to but I know it's
[38:19] not gonna do it right I know it's not
[38:24] going to do it so why am I worried about
[38:26] it I'm concerned with the voice that
[38:30] goes with the man that brought the
[38:34] message we preach brother Branham was a
[38:38] prophet but remember the point that I've
[38:40] made to you drove it hard on this one
[38:42] I'll Drive it again
[38:43] he didn't come to condemn
[38:51] it's condemnation to those who will not
[38:53] accept but it's deliverance to those who
[38:58] will accept it sets free one group of
[39:02] people while it binds another group
[39:05] right see that's what it is in the days
[39:09] of the voice of the seventh angel we'd
[39:12] learned the truth we'd learned the truth
[39:16] of what a gulf sent for it wasn't sent
[39:23] to condemn is sent to a bride to let her
[39:29] realize who she is and to be gathered
[39:33] together in that word of the hour that
[39:35] we're living seem to get us born again
[39:39] get us to a place to where we can see
[39:44] Jesus Christ see we can bring down the
[39:50] things and and that's what we were doing
[39:52] the other day see the Prophet was
[39:54] bringing a point of a message you know
[39:56] and he said we do this we do that but he
[39:59] said about the revelation of Jesus
[40:01] Christ in other words what has happened
[40:07] to the end time people have they been
[40:10] set free by the message or is it
[40:12] becoming more condemnation is it
[40:15] becoming more binding
[40:21] that's worth it I've never tried to
[40:23] teach anything to bind anybody to any
[40:25] point because it'll do no good like you
[40:31] you sure funny I know I am because
[40:33] that's what I say you said you're not
[40:35] trying to get people safe
[40:36] no because I know I can't do it I know
[40:46] that I cannot save you from anything the
[40:50] Prophet couldn't save you from anything
[40:52] it takes God to do the saving and see
[40:57] then his message was sent to the bride
[41:02] the others it goes in it because of the
[41:05] ways and thought but the message was
[41:07] sent to the endtime bride then let us
[41:11] know who we are and what we're here for
[41:14] the set us free
[41:19] you don't think like that do you think
[41:21] well I always thought this message was
[41:23] just you know was a judgment it is to
[41:26] those who reject it but to those who
[41:31] receive it it's not a judgment it's a
[41:36] freedom it's not a freedom to go live
[41:40] like the devil that's not that way it's
[41:44] a freedom to realize that God has paid
[41:47] the price and sent a message he's given
[41:52] us a message we've come up to the inner
[41:57] statue of a perfect man we've come up
[41:59] through all of the virtues and the
[42:01] things coming out and we're now striking
[42:03] to the point of love now love is a lot
[42:10] different than what we think we know
[42:13] it's not to Phileas or not just that in
[42:15] the other no charity is love see do you
[42:24] love God because he corrects you my dad
[42:32] died when I was 4 years old I can't ever
[42:35] say I remember him spanking me I wish I
[42:38] could because you know what I know what
[42:41] he would be doing it for to help me to
[42:46] try to help me to live right and do
[42:47] right do you honor your parents because
[42:52] of they come on children because they
[42:55] correct you you get all upset and all
[43:01] everything because of correction what do
[43:03] you want no they're trying to save you
[43:10] they're trying to to help you to try to
[43:12] get you to live right and do right
[43:14] they're trying to get you to see Jesus
[43:16] Christ
[43:21] but do you understand what I'm driving
[43:23] at because it it's what I was trying to
[43:25] get across Wednesday night we'll get
[43:26] back to the point of to it later to her
[43:29] that brother branham's message never
[43:32] begun in the forties and times that was
[43:38] doing what God had told him he was
[43:40] supposed to do returned the hearts or
[43:43] the children back to the faith of the
[43:44] father all right but we fail to see as I
[43:49] said when over and over and we'll go
[43:51] back over but we fail to see the key
[43:57] that he told him their own Ohio River
[44:02] want your message will forerun the
[44:10] second coming where's the message
[44:17] where's the message to forerun the
[44:20] second coming well we've got it it's the
[44:25] message but what part of it is for us
[44:31] because I can stand here and preach your
[44:33] condemnation condemnation message and
[44:36] say that's what the Prophet taught and
[44:37] read it to you what is that the message
[44:40] that's the message to those who need
[44:43] condemnation yeah what was his early
[44:48] ministry back there when he was
[44:49] preaching those things and weren't even
[44:51] now you don't like this but even the
[44:53] Prophet himself taught era in his early
[44:56] ministry because light had not shined on
[45:01] the truth he talked to white horse rider
[45:03] was the Holy Ghost until he was
[45:08] straightened out by the Lord later on by
[45:11] the opening of the word see I was just
[45:15] trying to get a point across to us
[45:16] Wednesday of worth it can we see the
[45:19] difference between his early ministry
[45:21] when he was bringing his message to the
[45:24] people and they're returning back to the
[45:26] faith of the fathers and then to see the
[45:28] opening of the word to come
[45:34] the opening of the word until it would
[45:41] come to work that he would bring us the
[45:45] message of deliverance he said well I
[45:51] thought the whole message was was this
[45:53] message what are you talking about I'm
[45:55] talking about truth he was sent to do
[45:58] two things one to turn the hearts of the
[46:02] children back to the faith of the Father
[46:04] 327 church AG book 2 to reveal the seven
[46:08] thunders which is revelation contained
[46:10] in the seven sealed
[46:11] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[46:13] truths that literally turn us back when
[46:19] did his message begin
[46:21] he said not in the years of preparation
[46:25] well I don't get you what you mean it
[46:29] was the message of returning back the
[46:31] faith of the fathers it was jaws promise
[46:35] I will restore Joel never brought a
[46:42] restoration of the new birth the new
[46:45] birth has been in every age every age
[46:48] had the new birth I wasn't restoration
[46:54] you remember Wednesday the capstone to
[47:01] cap it all off to take us in a change
[47:03] and all that's not restoration that was
[47:08] never here Jesus was rejected he become
[47:15] according to the scriptures the head of
[47:18] the corner well because that's all they
[47:22] could do at that time
[47:24] yet he was the one who you know he
[47:28] brought the message the Prophet brought
[47:30] the message but have we been able to go
[47:33] on into the message to see what he told
[47:37] are we still playing around with our
[47:43] ideas or thoughts I've been preaching
[47:45] for months about this trying to get us
[47:48] to see one thing if everybody's I said
[47:54] if everybody in the world was standing
[47:57] with the faith of the fathers do you
[48:03] listen to what I'm trying to say
[48:04] that's not his message that was a
[48:09] foundation to be able to bring his
[48:11] message that was not him sounding forth
[48:16] the mysteries the mysteries come from
[48:21] the seals and going home
[48:22] throughout the message to bring us the
[48:26] message of eternal life
[48:34] but in the days of the voice of the
[48:36] seventh angel when he begins to silent
[48:42] when he begins to declare his message
[48:45] wind is brought around him to start
[48:47] declaring his message well he was
[48:48] declared all alone my steward but that
[48:51] ain't the understanding that won't fit
[48:56] in what he was saying how many things do
[49:02] we need to read from the Prophet about
[49:04] that brother Branham knew he was going
[49:06] to have a message you remember what we
[49:10] were bringing out Wednesday night
[49:12] according to spoken words of regional
[49:14] seed when he brought his message down
[49:19] the Lord he said Lord I got him out on
[49:21] the limb because he brought him to the
[49:23] faith of the fathers read the message or
[49:29] listened to it and the Lord told him
[49:32] said as of yet Malachi fours not fulfill
[49:38] 1962 spoken words original see said
[49:41] Malachi 4 is not full for him
[49:46] because there was more to Malachi 4 than
[49:48] to just turn our hearts to the faith of
[49:52] the fathers it was to bring the
[49:55] revelation of the entire word and see as
[50:01] it does then he was to bring a message
[50:03] your message the Holy Spirit said will
[50:09] forerun the second coming
[50:11] in other words really put it in plain
[50:13] language your message will be the second
[50:16] coming is that a better way of putting
[50:20] it can you follow that line he was
[50:23] literally being told that his message
[50:25] was going to turn the hearts back yes
[50:29] but that it would come forth and be the
[50:33] very coming of the Lord Jesus can we
[50:38] believe it like that but you see what
[50:42] about the Prophet talking about he said
[50:47] this is the introducing what was his
[50:53] message to do it was to introduce Jesus
[50:57] Christ it was to introduce the Messiah
[51:07] look how hard the Prophet preached to
[51:09] all they down to but then the message
[51:12] that he had was to take us further on
[51:17] Kampala never told anything about to
[51:20] change other than you be change the
[51:22] moment the twinkle of an eye but nobody
[51:24] won't start to make that manifest right
[51:28] come on they couldn't make it manifest
[51:34] see there has to be something else take
[51:37] place and that something else takes
[51:39] place in this day where you and I are
[51:45] living think about it we've heard the
[51:52] message but have we heard the message
[51:55] that the Prophet bro or have we just
[51:57] heard
[52:00] words like I said I heard that brother
[52:08] say it that this country said it did
[52:11] you've told us about the Prophet now
[52:13] tell us what the Prophet taught well he
[52:18] told the disciples taught that but in
[52:23] the days of the voice of the seventh
[52:25] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[52:28] mystery would be finished see we've got
[52:32] to go on to a change of the body we've
[52:34] got to go on to many things it's not
[52:36] just to haphazardly sit around and wait
[52:41] we've got to move on in him to where we
[52:44] can see those things and remember what I
[52:46] was trying to bring in we instead like
[52:51] trying to do God a service without it
[52:53] being his wheel the 7th angels and this
[52:58] is not when he starts out doing this
[53:01] well when he begins to sound his message
[53:05] not the years in preparation but when he
[53:12] begins to sound the message the
[53:15] mysteries would be revealed when he
[53:18] begins to sound his message but Ron's
[53:22] message then was not just to condemn it
[53:27] was to bring us the full world not just
[53:31] ideas or thoughts see because listen to
[53:35] what this says off of the message having
[53:39] to do is he trying to do God a service
[53:42] that would be in his will
[53:43] what's the doctrine of the Bible what's
[53:48] the message that follows them signs
[53:56] like I said what if you get out of here
[53:58] now and you get to seeing all these
[53:59] people and the world I'll start having
[54:01] great signs and wonders what are you
[54:03] gonna do what are you gonna stand on
[54:08] listen to what he says what's the
[54:12] message that follows them signs still
[54:17] the same the old school of message
[54:21] forget it
[54:27] what about signs and wonders what's
[54:29] going to happen one day when the thing
[54:31] starts happening around the world and
[54:35] you start seeing signs and wonders among
[54:37] the people what are you gonna do I'm
[54:46] gonna check out their message and I'm
[54:51] going to quote that what if you go on
[54:54] with that same message there's another
[54:56] quote to that too if you go on with that
[54:57] same simple message part without it
[55:00] moving on into deeper depth he said
[55:06] forget it
[55:10] they probably right understood at a
[55:12] wonderful place during 1962 that he had
[55:16] preached what the Apostles had preached
[55:18] he said I preached what they did what
[55:20] they and they all that was beyond the
[55:22] curtain of time remember the people in
[55:23] that was rejoicing about it and said
[55:26] we're dependent upon that but then the
[55:30] Lord said as of yet that's your not true
[55:37] what did he do he began to hunt for the
[55:41] message that God was trying to bring and
[55:44] as he was doing it what does he do
[55:50] revelation 10 says that in the hour of
[55:55] the seventh angels message when he
[55:58] begins to sound forth the message not in
[56:02] a healing service but the message that
[56:06] follows the healing service what does he
[56:13] mean Ian would it be wonderful to see
[56:17] the great days of the Prophet and the
[56:20] healing services that he had some of you
[56:22] were witnesses to those things right
[56:25] it was wonderful wasn't it what do you
[56:29] want that back or do you want the
[56:34] message mmm now we're striking on
[56:40] something a lot of people would like to
[56:44] have the days of the Prophet back
[56:51] did you understand him when he was here
[57:01] not in these years of preparation
[57:06] continuum number six
[57:12] and he promised in the hour of the seven
[57:15] angels message the seven seals would be
[57:18] revealed and the mysteries of God would
[57:21] be declared revelations 10 when the
[57:25] seventh angel begins to sound the
[57:27] message not the healing service the
[57:31] message that follows the healing service
[57:35] everybody wants the signs and wonders
[57:37] they wanted to profit you've heard him
[57:39] tell that right they gladly accepted
[57:42] Jesus when he was here healing the sick
[57:45] casting out devil
[57:46] but when he began to say I and my father
[57:47] one they was glad to hear brother
[57:54] branham right oh yeah great prophet but
[57:57] when he began to preach his message what
[58:00] happened
[58:05] was his message to just condemn them to
[58:09] tell them they were wrong like we can go
[58:11] to all of that alike where Pentecost
[58:15] fail and he say this is where you fail
[58:17] this worry is that all he was to brain
[58:22] or was he talk bring the opening of the
[58:25] word that light had never shined on
[58:28] before
[58:33] you see the disciples never preached the
[58:35] seals come on
[58:38] they never preached to see you it was
[58:43] not open to them they never preached
[58:46] about the Son of Man
[58:48] sure Matthew Mark Luke and John is
[58:51] writing about it go that's writing about
[58:52] war taking place but words any other
[58:54] than either their message or Paul or any
[58:56] of them that spoke of anything about the
[58:58] seals and about the what was the
[59:05] prophets message as I said to start with
[59:10] was it the basis of the Prophet being a
[59:13] condemnation was you listening was the
[59:20] Prophet a condemnation to a nation or a
[59:23] condemning to a world to be sent oh yeah
[59:27] yeah that's part of it yeah but did he
[59:33] not bring to the people an opportunity
[59:36] of salvation that had never been brought
[59:40] they did not bring forth to them what
[59:44] happened when when who what it went down
[59:47] you know and he said under the juniper
[59:48] tree oh he wanted to he wanted to kill
[59:50] everybody cause he understand his
[59:52] message either God had to put him
[59:55] through a whole lot of things when he
[59:56] did he come out there different
[59:59] relevance message was not just a
[1:00:01] condemnation message it was a
[1:00:05] deliverance message but when he entered
[1:00:11] the opening through the seals and get
[1:00:12] everything going look what he come to go
[1:00:15] ahead the number seven there's a
[1:00:21] messenger above and a messenger on the
[1:00:22] earth all right the seven angels message
[1:00:27] while he was making his proclaiming his
[1:00:31] ministry didn't when he began to sign
[1:00:34] forth his ministry not when he started
[1:00:38] out Jesus when he started out but he
[1:00:43] lived his evening oh that was great well
[1:00:45] when you begin to stay on my father one
[1:00:47] what happened would brought around him
[1:00:48] oh yeah they wanted him but him he began
[1:00:55] to say and he made this statement went
[1:00:58] on hello he said when you begin to say I
[1:01:00] and my father one and these other things
[1:01:03] he said Satan will come after you in
[1:01:06] other words he'll he don't like him what
[1:01:10] is it what is the message what I thought
[1:01:15] that is nothing see I'm trying to get
[1:01:17] you to define the message to see where
[1:01:19] the message lathes and what it brings
[1:01:20] and when did it start see he didn't
[1:01:24] start the message in his early ministry
[1:01:29] no really brought around his message
[1:01:33] began in 1963 until then it was a
[1:01:40] restoration until then it was turning
[1:01:43] back to the faith of the Father then he
[1:01:46] began to bring his message the opening
[1:01:50] of the seals was his message the years
[1:01:53] of preparation look what was he saying
[1:02:02] it's getting Lices I can read it off her
[1:02:05] but go ahead with number nine on the
[1:02:09] wings there was no white though I love
[1:02:11] this one
[1:02:12] let's read it off of her to get where
[1:02:15] you'll see what he's talking about
[1:02:22] look at what he's talking about he's
[1:02:26] explaining where this message come from
[1:02:34] already been here just exactly what the
[1:02:37] vision said that the next message would
[1:02:40] come forth bye-bye what now let's read
[1:02:43] it now I laid my hands against the rock
[1:02:46] and looked up towards the heavens and
[1:02:50] started praying I heard a voice come out
[1:02:53] of the top of the rocks there said what
[1:02:55] are you leaning against over your heart
[1:02:58] I raised back like this my bare
[1:03:00] shoulders naked from a waster hot I look
[1:03:04] back and there was wrote in the quartz
[1:03:06] in the stone white eagle look just
[1:03:13] exactly what the vision said that the
[1:03:15] next message was come forth his message
[1:03:22] was not to just come in condemn ination
[1:03:25] his message was not to come and and just
[1:03:28] try to restore us back to the faith of
[1:03:29] the father all that's well and good and
[1:03:35] we needed but what is his message to
[1:03:38] come to do the unveiling of God pillar
[1:03:42] fire peering visible among us
[1:03:44] identifying that the message is right
[1:03:46] like he did at Mount Sinai remember
[1:03:48] before the true message come forth
[1:03:51] Moses priests and led them out of Egypt
[1:03:59] this prophet preached and led to people
[1:04:02] out from denominationalism into the
[1:04:06] faith of the fathers but just not to
[1:04:10] finish of it this message is to bring
[1:04:16] Jesus Christ personally to you and me
[1:04:20] it's not to condemn us fine all right so
[1:04:25] you don't understand me when I say that
[1:04:26] he didn't come to condemn cuz that's all
[1:04:28] you've ever been taught all you've ever
[1:04:31] been taught by the ministers is that
[1:04:33] this message is condemnation it condemns
[1:04:35] this it condemns advocate ends is when I
[1:04:37] just condemn with a I just his message
[1:04:43] was not condemnation his message was
[1:04:46] revelation his message was restoration
[1:04:56] to bring back what the Apostles taught
[1:04:59] yes to teach it until that would be so
[1:05:02] perfect until Paul would have been
[1:05:04] pleased to stood there when the Prophet
[1:05:07] was bringing those things but to realize
[1:05:10] that Paul and him never made it that's
[1:05:14] why in Hebrews 11:4 it it says day
[1:05:16] without us cannot be made perfect Paul
[1:05:19] and then noticing the grave is waiting
[1:05:21] on you and me to do what
[1:05:30] to get into the message and find out
[1:05:32] what this message is really about you
[1:05:36] don't understand what I'm saying
[1:05:38] but listen to the wording at least this
[1:05:42] message is not this condemnation this
[1:05:45] message is not to try to make us dress
[1:05:49] right and live right
[1:05:55] you're funny preacher cuz I thought all
[1:05:57] preachers want people to live right I
[1:05:59] don't want people to live right I want
[1:06:00] people to get born again and then live
[1:06:03] in or take care of yourself do you
[1:06:06] understand that get born again it'll
[1:06:10] take care of itself right see because
[1:06:17] it's not what we think it is it's not
[1:06:19] judgment sometimes it's it's to bring us
[1:06:22] the sounding of the seventh angels
[1:06:24] messages to deliver us from all things
[1:06:29] that's why I've asked you to do it I've
[1:06:31] asked you to just do one simple thing go
[1:06:35] home take the book of the titles of the
[1:06:38] sermons of brother Branham after 63
[1:06:44] we're going to get into those things but
[1:06:47] show me one thing after 63 this a
[1:06:50] condemnation message unveiling of God
[1:06:58] mighty God unveil who is this melt
[1:07:02] resident future home
[1:07:07] across the mystery just read the titles
[1:07:14] things that ought to be just read the
[1:07:20] titles and you'll see what I'm talking
[1:07:23] about then go back and read the titles
[1:07:26] of the early ministry why did it brother
[1:07:28] branham preached over Christ the mystery
[1:07:31] of God revealed why did he preach that
[1:07:37] he had always preached one god but he'd
[1:07:44] always preached it as Jesus Christ me in
[1:07:46] the mystery no its Christ is the mystery
[1:07:48] and what did he say he said if you don't
[1:07:50] see now watch it he didn't say if you
[1:07:52] don't see Jesus and ever verse one
[1:07:54] decide he said if you don't see Christ
[1:07:56] in ever verse 57 he preached over and
[1:08:03] over and over that Melchizedek was
[1:08:06] Almighty God
[1:08:07] I wanted he preached another message
[1:08:13] after the seals bro but look at what he
[1:08:17] said after the seals preach he preached
[1:08:21] who is this melchester day he preached
[1:08:25] who he was by current 57 right he
[1:08:31] preached
[1:08:32] who is this melchester day no children
[1:08:36] occurs God in human flesh he's talking
[1:08:39] about and bride for him take two
[1:08:44] messages home and listen to them
[1:08:45] together listen to the unveiling of God
[1:08:52] and watch how much he lays down who that
[1:08:55] God is one didn't get the next message
[1:08:58] he preached not too long after then the
[1:09:00] mighty God unveiled and see if he ain't
[1:09:08] talking about you
[1:09:13] see that's what I'm saying that the
[1:09:15] people are not seeing the message
[1:09:16] they're seeing the the point of faith
[1:09:19] the fathers are seeing something like
[1:09:21] that or are following their own ways and
[1:09:23] ideas and just come down with it being a
[1:09:25] condemnation instead of coming to a
[1:09:32] point that he's he's showing who you
[1:09:34] really are what you're doing here is
[1:09:37] that the statement the Prophet said when
[1:09:39] the bride realizes who she is and what
[1:09:43] she's here for
[1:09:44] he said she'll be an invincible army
[1:09:53] what about it
[1:09:58] what about it what do you think the
[1:10:02] message is well it's just telling us
[1:10:06] about Jesus
[1:10:13] I thought the Bible was to reveal the
[1:10:17] mystery of God
[1:10:22] the Apostle Paul preached a message
[1:10:26] talking about the revealing of the
[1:10:28] mystery and you know what he said that
[1:10:31] mystery was he said it was the
[1:10:33] engrafting of the Gentiles the
[1:10:40] engrafting of the Gentiles into the
[1:10:43] kingdom now that's a great mystery
[1:10:48] because he you don't have anything like
[1:10:50] I said on the other night all you've got
[1:10:52] is a speaking of it here Rahab the
[1:10:55] harlot you got this one here you got
[1:10:57] David with his mighty men you know that
[1:11:00] justice speaking of it just the types of
[1:11:02] it showing the Gentiles would come into
[1:11:05] the kingdom but when Jesus came he knew
[1:11:08] what he was doing and he didn't pick the
[1:11:11] hole that the children of Israel he came
[1:11:13] to it own it own received him not to
[1:11:16] them that receive him he gave the power
[1:11:18] to become sons of God there's Peter
[1:11:19] James John and all of those palling in
[1:11:21] but who did he really come after and
[1:11:28] that little woman said yes Lord you're
[1:11:33] right they said that dogs eat the chrome
[1:11:39] from the master's table he said I found
[1:11:43] no faith in Israel who was she a Gentile
[1:11:50] and that man said you don't have to do
[1:11:54] anything I'm a man of authority you just
[1:11:56] speak the word and my server to be
[1:11:58] healed
[1:11:59] he said go home he found him well did a
[1:12:07] Gentile see Paul knew there was a
[1:12:15] mystery of the Gentiles in grafton that
[1:12:19] mystery would bring it to the basis it
[1:12:21] that he would finally have to go be the
[1:12:23] messenger to the Gentiles
[1:12:28] but do we see it like that what do we
[1:12:31] see this message to me what is salvation
[1:12:33] to you well I don't do this I don't do I
[1:12:36] don't lie don't cheat it on steal praise
[1:12:38] God
[1:12:39] but tell me that word saved anybody show
[1:12:46] me where your good works have never
[1:12:48] saved anybody now let's get back to Paul
[1:12:50] we was the other night when Paul said
[1:12:52] therefore leaving the principles of
[1:12:53] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[1:12:55] perfection not laying again the
[1:12:56] foundation of dead works you know if
[1:13:03] you're living right is a wonderful
[1:13:05] opportunity and a great thing but if
[1:13:08] it's not from the inside it's nothing
[1:13:10] but dead works its carnal reform ain't
[1:13:15] no the dead works but if you're living
[1:13:16] by Christ from the inside - let him take
[1:13:20] over then you have deliverance perish
[1:13:25] the prophets message it will take us all
[1:13:27] the way to the change of these bodies
[1:13:29] what's going to change these bodies go
[1:13:31] to one the opening of the word when the
[1:13:37] bride realizes who she is
[1:13:45] but what is it Church
[1:13:49] what is the entire message
[1:13:56] I thought it was the revelation of Jesus
[1:13:58] Christ
[1:14:01] and I thought by being the revelation of
[1:14:03] Jesus Christ that that Jesus Christ
[1:14:05] would be what would convert in us and
[1:14:07] not we ourselves
[1:14:17] what you see you can't try to tell
[1:14:18] people truth you try to get something to
[1:14:21] them about it and they just freeze up on
[1:14:22] you because they can't follow what
[1:14:24] you're talking about can you follow the
[1:14:27] simple statement that I might I don't
[1:14:31] want my kids to be good I wanted to be
[1:14:35] born again I don't want a church to be
[1:14:39] good the world can do that I want a
[1:14:44] bunch of born-again believers because if
[1:14:48] I get a bunch of born-again believers I
[1:14:50] ain't got to worry about them being good
[1:14:51] look you know what they're gonna rip out
[1:14:53] who they are and what's taking place and
[1:14:55] they'll be that because of what God has
[1:14:57] given them you ever thanked him for
[1:15:00] saving you
[1:15:01] well no brother deal cuz I don't do this
[1:15:03] I don't do that
[1:15:04] well what about when you didn't do it
[1:15:06] what about when you did do it
[1:15:11] is it deliverance or is it works
[1:15:18] is it salvation as this message brought
[1:15:22] salvation or has it brought condemnation
[1:15:31] barbaric
[1:15:34] what about the revelation of Jesus
[1:15:37] Christ
[1:15:40] in you as the Prophet said Christ the
[1:15:42] minister God revealed what is the new
[1:15:44] birth
[1:15:44] he says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:15:46] personally to you the growth development
[1:15:50] of the statue of a perfect man is a
[1:15:52] revelation of Jesus Christ to you it's
[1:15:57] not something you can attain yourself
[1:15:59] because there's no way to attain it
[1:16:01] you've got to let him have it in the
[1:16:07] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:16:10] when are we gonna really get down to
[1:16:12] understanding what the Prophet brought
[1:16:15] to you and me he brought us a revelation
[1:16:22] of Jesus Christ that mankind had never
[1:16:27] been able to try to bring the best they
[1:16:30] could do was the fossils and things that
[1:16:33] brought the faith of the fathers
[1:16:41] but what about it do you have salvation
[1:16:45] or do you have a book of rules that you
[1:16:47] live by
[1:16:50] have you been delivered from things like
[1:16:53] brother con fob bush this was back
[1:16:57] before he ever heard of the message part
[1:16:58] of it I remember that but he wanted to
[1:17:01] quit smoking and so he prayed well when
[1:17:07] he told me what his prayer would I said
[1:17:09] man they no way in the world you could
[1:17:11] have prayed anything any better he could
[1:17:14] have begged and screamed and hollered
[1:17:16] until he just fell over David trying to
[1:17:19] get God to take care you know what he
[1:17:21] prayed he said Lord take away the need
[1:17:26] and the desire he had it covered on ever
[1:17:35] Avenue that could be he said take away
[1:17:38] the need and the desire and he was
[1:17:41] immediately delivered from smoking they
[1:17:44] did smoked probably most of his life you
[1:17:49] ever prayed like that I thought God they
[1:17:51] know better what prior to could be pray
[1:17:54] anything you have need of getting rid of
[1:17:56] this ask God to get rid of the need and
[1:17:59] the desire and don't quit cause you
