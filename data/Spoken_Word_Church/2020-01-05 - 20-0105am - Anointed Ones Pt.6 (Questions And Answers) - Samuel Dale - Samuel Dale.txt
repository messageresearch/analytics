time you just part of us so that part of us today because they're back back with us we appreciate them coming up and fellowshipping with us and Norland having a good time so if you'd like to turn in your scripture turn where we've been reading Matthew 24 and we'll started reading about 23 22 23 to read this if we had any bring out a little early if we can we'll try to get to see if they can be any questions anybody Woodhouse oh you know we could try to cover that a little bit and we'll just call it questions and answers and what I've done now I ran off a good many copies this morning of basically all of the quotes that I've been using from the prophets so Terrence is passing them out if you want one just get one like to each family and then that way we can you know we can go back if there's any extra we'll have them to do with it but that's you know at a real good time yesterday with the the youth that we the lifetime see we didn't get to come we came a little bit late so we didn't get to see the events and the things and we enjoyed it it was real good brother Nathaniel done a good job ministering given little testimony and looking forward this afternoon to him ministering for us and this afternoon we'll be the youth time so they will be taking the services and doing the things in heaven and all like that so remember that remember the evening service rather

okay any other announcements 15th of February will be our Valentine's band for quit for the couples of the church so remember that you know we'll try to get everything together and all do it okay all right father we thank you for this day and your grace we thank you for your love and your understanding of us thank you for you and we just ask you Lord to help us to understand what the hour that we're living what a wonderful opportunity to be able to enjoy the presence of your revealing of your word unto us we pray that you would just have your way open their eyes of understanding close our hearts to things that are not needful and what the rest of the world does the rest everybody does that's their business help us to just settling in to where we can be have a personal revelation in a association with you Lord through the opening of your word forgive our sins cleanse us of all unrighteousness and got us in dial up in Jesus name Amen Matthew 24 verse 23 you remember how we brought this out all the other is back prior to this time coming down from from the building of the mosque of Omar and on down to the Titus and and sent in now coming down to our time our time here then If any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ there I believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they say all deceive the very elect now we know brother Branham said frankly get to elect tied-up you'd have to cut it short right now just remember one thing if this day of the anointed ones and the things that we've been talking about is the deceiving part remember one thing the bride can't be deceived all right but you know what that means everybody else is is that sensible if it's almost gets the elect then everything else is deceived you know so then ething anything outside of this message is deceived all right now because the only way we can know about the message of the prophet or the God bringing it to us okay now that's sensible enough behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not no don't follow every little doctrine of whim whims and ideas and thing where is the lightning shyness Lightning cometh out of the east and shyness even unto the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be now our concern we haven't dealt into this part we'll go back to it but you see there is to be the coming of the Son of Man that's the main part is the coming of the Son of Man all right now there's that's the thing we had this last night in the questions and answers in the Bible study and the questions ended up which I hope we'll get to the in it how do we know well we're only going to know by the revealing of the Son of man the only way we're gonna know the truth is by the revealing of the son of man all right now that'll that'll staying on for wheresoever the carcass is the word there will the eagle's be gathered to get it you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word what I'll stick that in my Bible yeah I put a great big one right there okay all right like I said we last night we have questions and answers you know if any of you are interested in any time coming and we don't have no set line to go by we just come and ever who has a question we lay the question out and we try to discuss that question as to what you know they're doing all right we got started last night and we had one question and we finished two hours talking on that one question because it wound up being exactly what we're talking about here and I told you last night I said I will speak in the morning about these things because this is message number six that we've been talking on the anointed ones all right I believe that we're in the last days I believe the Prophet brought the message and What did he say the only wants the endtime thank God for the opening of the seals now if you'll take my word and go do it look over at the beginning I'll give you the page in a minute but you go over to the end of the book read about the last 20 pages of anointed ones it's right down where we're living all right right to the point to where we're living right now because that's the way it's supposed to be all right but talking about those things we were discussing you know the anointed ones and that's the one thing I want you to think about there is not but one Christ there's just one god there's one Christ one Lord one faith one baptism now he anoints many yes because we're in the last days when it was promised that he'd pour out his spirit upon all flesh right now we covered those things to show you that's right down here Azusa Street was a fulfillment I've been pouring out of his spirit upon all flesh but that just keeps going now it's going on now because he's pouring out that spirit upon all flesh now all right and in doing that see then there can't be many Christ so we're gonna have to take the one thing and I believe that's the one point that that most people are missing on the message of noted ones we want to have an anointing over here an anointing over here you know we want to have one for the bride and one for the rest of the world well that's no such thing I want you to show me where the Prophet says that I want you to show me and cry in anything where he said it's the same anointing that's the mystery the mystery is if the anointing is the same yeah but see that's what what we say we think this is an anointing of the Holy Ghost come over here for different anointing of the devil no no no and we'll go through this in a little bit and just read some of it to show you brother Branham says the same anointing that was on Moses was on Balaam ain't no difference then but you see the same anointing that you have right now is the same anointing that was back very to walk the shores of Galilee or else you got another anointing just trying to make some simple statements for our understanding you say do we need to understand this brother branham said in the anointed ones the end time that we would be able to understand whether or not that we are a cuckoo bird you know our excuse me he uses the word Brier or a thistle or whatever and this only came out at the opening the well let me just get to that point and we'll just read it okay they let it be that away go ahead and pull up number one brothers must let's get started on just a little bit I'll try to just run through some of these and run them off real quick if I can but I ask you to please read anointed wants to end time and brother Branham in the naughty ones the end time said a good message to study would be the god of this evil age all right now he said that that it would be good to study that part of it because that's where he was covering him alright you go from from about the anointed ones being in 65 at the beginning 725 you know beginning and from then on he's talking about anointed ones until his crucifixion he talking about anointed ones and just about every message go back and study at the sea yeah I try to give you something to make you interested in your own self of reading it's not that the pastor has this or the preacher has the issue or the preachers are supposed to feed us no no you're supposed to have your own experience now the question was last night how do we know whether we were anointed wondering brother branham tells us he said it is only by the word well they got the word and they got the word and even you say the Baptist has got the word they only got part Pentecostals got booked only got part it's what I said one Christ one message one Christ see this message is the only one that's got the truth of all there's not one outside of this and that's what tears my heart out to think how these people can turn around in and say brother Branham was so wrong come on the doors of Lula opened for you out on the Internet's they've got your great revelations to come and show us that ain't no challenge that's just a straight fact come and show us we're all but now don't bring little silly things you know don't bring that one gospel says there's two blind men the other gospel says there's one blind man now don't be that narrow-minded if you're gonna come to talk about the word let's talk about the word I'm just serious that's not arrogant or hateful I'm serious it's time to say it it's time to say back to the people out there and let the people have a choice see the anointing that's on the bride is the anointing that's on the kimono can we quote it this way it rain falls on the just and the unjust it's the same rain for the beans of corn the cocoa bears in fact it's the same right behave it one line the able one Christ I don't you don't like my words I ain't but they finally did put that in the dictionary I reckon I quoted it so much too like they put it in in there but not all right now listen seeing all of this accumulation of evidence that now now that we now live in I think it's a good thing to rehearse these things and draw them out since the seals has been opened and find out the truth of these things as God has been so loyal to us with His grace to show us these things now I asked you I said it I asked you go to the lots of lies ten pages of the northern ones the end time and read it real careful it's right down to where we're at now he says the same thing but he brings it down to his message and worse I had no all right thank God for the opening of the seals these things were not understood I'm saying until you listen the Prophet didn't preach anointed ones until after the seals were broke he didn't preach marriage and divorce to life the seals broke there were certain things he didn't preach the life to the seals was broke why cuz that's revealed in the seals everything was revealed in the ceiling why don't we don't want to see you you know what's the trouble alright go to the next one and we'll get these little points out of the way paragraph 70 look what he says the prophecies of Balaam exactly right cuz he couldn't speak nothing else that ties the whole Bible together even Balaam could not say nothing contrary he told Balin I'll go with you you've offered me high for your kingdom you can give me all of it but I can't say nothing that God don't tell me now him you call him a false prophet the that state in his life that he could not speak nothing different listen if we claim to be anything we were to do something now look I hope your feelings don't get hurt and don't turn that off them phones off and don't get up and go out just sit still and let's see if it's the Holy Spirit won't reveal it to us and prove it to us you say brother you say but that just whatever you believe nother way you're saying just whatever you believe he ain't saying that just sit still and listen ask God to open your heart then you'll find out whether you're a briar or a thistle or whatever you're standing wherever you're standing now this message do we need to know how do you gonna know whether you're Breyer at this one or what you are that's what he just said well I know that I'm born again how do you know how do you know you're born again I shouted I cried I swung huh every one of those things Satan can impersonate and you know yourself the Prophet said what I just made this table you can't depend on no fleshly things to be proof you can only go to the evidence of the Holy Ghost and the evidence of the Holy Ghost is what whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word that's the only thing we can go to yeah but I know I'm born again praise God I'm not trying to take away your experience I'm trying to tell each one of us we need to have an experience with God if we haven't had it then that's what we need and brother Branham comes over to that he brings that out in the message there and what do we do well I know I'm saved that's like what I said back in when that guy said God was dead boy they just put it in the papers and I know my god live die I talked to him this morning come on how many of them that put out on earth and many denominations put out great statements against that man well how many other one had a new birth why did they turn the message down if they turn to message down it proves they don't have the new birth right so you can holler all you won't do I talked to him you know I doing this that's great statements but all that is you're just running your mouth words are true evidence whether or not the spirit in you agrees plural agrees continues to agree doesn't stop anywhere you know that never done away with brother brother branham never done away with with apples on the tree is proof it's an apple tree right he never done away with any of them things that used to be a people's idea of what the holy ghost was he believed in every one of them he shouted he spoke in tongues he done all of those things but he had one thing to connect it out and he said the angel of the Lord corrected him in a dream told him that's whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word these didn't there's one thing about it you can't then you ain't gonna change what you you ain't gonna try to change what this man say is no you're gonna take what he says okay listen now getting to the point you say number three someone might say to me do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine spirit of God upon a person and yet they are false wound down to the bottom and what does he say he says that's dust saith the Lord now you want to argue with it thus saith the Lord so then anointed ones genuine annoy only one Christ so the same anointing has to be it has to be the same on each individual all right the wheat if you got your things go with and just turn over the rough number forward we'll start on here both of wheat and the weeds live by the same anointing from heaven both of them rejoicing over that ought to be sensible same rained it brings up the beans brings up the weeds but you know what it brings up more weeds than it does beans I plant a whole bag of beans get a few and I don't plant them other things they get out there on their own and there's more of them right but you see the point of what I'm getting at reiji's going up to the bottom where we got martins they've really same guard in the same place under the same spouts they're come up weed and they're come up tears by the same thing notice the same anointing water anointing water brings forth the wheat brings forth the weed the same Holy Spirit that anoints the church that gives them a desire to save souls and gives them power to perform miracles it falls on the unjust the same as the just the very same spirit now you can't make it another way and understand Mathew 24:24 and he said there shall arise false Christ's false anointed ones anointed with a genuine thing but the false prophets of its false teachers he said he'd get down to the mark of the beast but listen the same anointing that anoints the church he said is the same anointing that noise although everything else that's only one anointing yeah but we got this anointing over here and and and they got that anointing over there and show me where the Prophet taught that I'll accept it and be glad to tell who told it to me but you can't find it it's the same anointing there's only one Holy Ghost there's only one God there's only one anointing all right so just remember that point there's never been but one anointing all right go ahead to number five yeah we know we're number six Moses a man sent from God with the Word of God and on his journey taken Israel into the Promised Land strictly with the commandment of God he met another prophet another anointed one that had a genuine anointing of the same Holy Spirit that was upon Moses are you going to say that the prophets wrong well I don't believe that then you're saying the prophets wrong guys II sense wake up he's a prophet the Holy Spirit was upon this man his name was Balaam we're all acquainted with him well the very things the same thing the things that the man said is still taking place he spoke in ascender Bible about 2800 years ago they aren't like a unicorn or Israel and as many there's more other things that he doing okay now think about it same anointing go ahead we're still in the north he wants to end huh progress 68 Balaam anointed with the same spirit that was upon Moses what was the difference well Balaam was false now he's gonna tell you what the difference is so what we think the difference is don't mean nothing it's what he says that's the way I follow the Prophet I'm either gonna follow him or I'm gonna get out no because I got enough sense to know I can't stay between you're either in this message or you're out of the message and what we do about the word will determine whether what we got come on by them annoying with the same spirit that was upon Moses what was the difference the teaching of Moses was perfect and watch him the Bible said here in 2nd Peter it was the teaching of Balaam that Israel received that God never did forgive unpardonable sin the teaching is the difference the teaching is the difference the anointing is the same to understand Mathew 24:24 what do you got they go ahead number 7 the vultures of Jesus day was also casting out Devils now I didn't say that he did it okay anointed ones on the old carcass that's a pretty good statement right they were casting out Devils jesus said and remember they had prophets in those days Kath was the high priest prophesy how many knows that calf was prophesied notice the position of the weed in the field it's watered by the same anointing why did the Bible say he prophesied because he was high priest that year a rotten scavenger a weed and a thistle sitting among the wheat but the Spirit was upon him Catholics prophesied and said it was necessary that one died for the sins of the people because he was trying to stop with the insurrection of taking place out in the natural all right so he's saying that it was necessary that one died for the sins of the people he goes on and crucified Jesus Christ did what are we gonna do Church come on but the Spirit was all on him the genuine the Holy Spirit of God the Holy Spirit of God was upon him to preach prophesy for tell it to come and come to Pais and denied and crucify the very vindicated word of the hour then what are we doing hey brother def what are you trying to do I'm trying to prove one time there's not but one anointing there's not an anointing for the genuine and anointing for everything else it's the same anointing if you don't get nothing out of the message study the message bring it and show me that there's a to anointing show me there's two guards water it's the same anointing yeah but I I don't understand you mean you mean that that's the Holy Ghost throwing them out there that your prophet said it was a Holy Ghost from cosmos and confidence is one had Jesus killed you get the anointing of the Holy Ghost was the same he said I don't understand that we are listen if you don't understand something what do you do well I don't know what to do it sounds like this and it sounds like that I don't know what it is we'll find somebody do something that's too late well how do we know cause there's no only does you say in there knowing he would have same anointing well somewhere this thing goes got to be settled right there falling away now by the thousands from the message because that's what the Bible said that they must be a falling away in their falling away but you know what they had to be somewhere to fall so they had to be up in the message going with it running with it now they're falling all right we'll see that's the greatest sign that is the Bible being fulfilled and why are we not then resourcing not because it Dara falling away no not resorting to that but rejoicing that the Word of God is keeping us from falling number one thing keeping me and you from following that's God himself well not use fetters I just can't see how they let that anointing cesano both them do you believe brother Brian was a prophet well why don't you accept what he says when I still see now you're saying he's wrong we know we're gonna put everything we've got onto the Prophet that's where the people this message the biggest percent of you they don't do it they're scared what do you think they're falling away now any little thing comes up and churches just fall away them any of you was around in 1977 when it didn't take place and churches were falling away and sending their books back to Jeffersonville well because it didn't happen according to what they thought well you know what evidently what was thought of back that must been wrong you know how I know it must have been wrong go we're here 2020 so what we thought of back dar was wrong that it's wrong inlets or whatever coming through but listen I'm trying my best to get you to see one thing you can't see anointed ones and if you can't see anointed ones in the correct way you can't see what you are where you're at or whether or not you have the new birth but can you understand it this way the rain falls on the just and the unjust it's the same rain the quickens of wheat that quickens the Browns same identical God doing it yeah but what you mean God for that huh yeah that's what it says in the Bible he said he sent these things among mr. tries to see whether we'd fall brother Brendan said that he would try the bride in the end down to see she'd fall said see what were she wouldn't fall like he fell oh but you can't get people to agree with the word take that one right there Eve brother branham said before Adam could come to Eve she had fallen he said before Jehovah could come to the Old Testament bride she fell he said before the bride could come to Jesus Christ in his fullness they went to Nicaea and failed but I've heard preachers right here they used to preach with me say oh but that wouldn't that wasn't the bride it went and I see yeah brother Branham said it was he said the true church wound up it and I see yeah we see they didn't believe that they believe the false vine went and I said what the false line have to go far if they're false right they aren't ready to see but you see that's word that when you stand you're gonna stand alone what you believe in you minister brethren you better consider that sometimes you're gonna stand by yourself because God's gonna try you to see what you'll do he's gonna put it out there in front there to see what you're gonna do and look what they're doing that falling right and left like I said to start with if it's to the point that it would almost deceive the elect everything else is already to see what about it look where we're staying all right now let's get something and then we'll pick it up and move over all right bring up Luke eight all right they're supposed to have these on only it's not it's not in what you got no pull up Luke eight a simple little parable one parable told in Luke Mark and Matthew a parable let's see what it says he's got Luke Luke eight nine go to 11 verse 11 now you know he gave the parable in told what it wasn't then they said you know this what is this and he says well this is the parable this seed is the word of God all right now started off the seed is the word of God we ain't talking about sowing beans and corn everybody thanks Boyle ain't it something that brother branham told us that when you plant corn you're gonna get colon said we thought when you plant corn you gonna get beans you say that's stupid brother Dale that's exactly the way people are he didn't have to tell me planting corn would get corn the parable is what it's the word now let's see what it says what do we do ask him saying once the prayer will be and he said unto the imminence given it is given to know you unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others and parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now we good old Baptists we thought Jesus spoke in parables to make it simple how much is that in the message now how many are you thinking that Jesus procured spoke in parables to make it simple he spoke in parables to hide it that's what the Bible says to hide it not to make it simple that's what I said you plant beans you get beans you don't have to make it no more simple than that but he spoke in parables that he might have it the scene you might see in here and you might understand understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside are they that hear the Watts now then come with the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts unless they should believe and be saved the devil comes and takes the word out listen they under a car they which when they hear receive the word with joy in these having no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away and they would fell upon thorns are they which when they heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection but that on the good ground are they which in the honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit unto patience simple parable Matthew says they understand understand it Matthew says understand a thing and mark says receives I'm powerful but listen do you understand what he's describing there's two things being described don't have a enough to do it with two identical so we'll do that these two things being described all right both of them is talking about the sowing of the seed it's the same seed that falls into the ground and withers away because there's no nothing there to quicken it all right the same seed is the seed that's in the thorns and tongues that's people at what hears the word and because they don't want to the cares of life and things and all come in and take over right and what do you turn down the word come on what do you turn down the word but the lysed is what the word that's in sown into the heart and it's quickened or made alive you understand what I'm getting both of these assignment what's the difference what happened in that parable the word was planted you agree you want to reread it you don't read Matthew you want to read mark you want to say that the word was planted that's my point each one of the three Gospels declares the word was planted why did it not mature what went wrong come on this was I was thinking about it last night when Nathaniel was talking about Cindy what was that when you said everybody preach it on David and and there were you know a new preacher to come you know what new preachers in the Baptist I'll preach the seed the word the parables that's what the priests come on the parables telling you what I'm seed everything's fine with it no problems what went wrong was when you don't water the seed and are by it'll die and go away goes into the ground it does this it don't work right but what's the difference in the anointing upon the genuine and the false the order remember one time they're not false into you turning down the world if you don't get that point then drop it and forget it Balaam Balaam was a prophet you listen to brother Branham he said Balaam was a prophet he said to be a prophet in Israel is a wonderful thing you realize they depended on Balaam as being their profit until Elijah stood up Balaam was not a false prophet until Elijah come up then when in Balaam had to go against Elijah he proved then if there's something wrong he wanted to riches he wanted two things and he finally got him the parable the sowing of the seed goes into the ground some of it you know what we're talking about some of us in stony it don't do no good some of us in this that don't do no what's the problem they were not wrong with the word there was nothing wrong with the seed it's what took place to the seed after it was planted it's the same anointing same rain that raised up the wheat raised up the beans raised up the corn raised up the weeds it's the same seed because you're not talking about but one seed what happened the Holy Spirit comes down to quicken then what was the difference in Peter them and con us and then when Caiaphas with all of his paperwork could rolled it out of them how long and tell them how great what had stuck with the word and how everything was right Nicodemus even goes to the Lord Jesus has said we know that thou art a man sent from God we know no man can do these things let's go to me with him but what happened to him his statement was good he had a good confession but when it was put on the line he backed off and said I don't understand I gotta go back to my mama and be born again me understand what I'm trying to get you to look at same rain same seed different conditions the different conditions is what made the problem it took a true seed that was put in the ground and the cares of life and things killed that seed out took the life away from it all right when the Holy Ghost fell what could it do that seed rotting in the ground when the rain fell how could it quicken it if it was in thorns and the cares of life and these things happen how could it quicken it the seed is right the rain is right what went wrong judas iscariot brother branham said was anointed it's in the only one then he said he was anointed he kept that devil heal the sick the whole kind of thing Judas was all right till he faced Jesus at the finish at the finish of the day he showed if color the finish of the day he went after the richest in different things right what happened to all that word that he had planted in him all in here he wound up thinking it's no good you know what it went being no good for him but you know what Peter heard the same word Judas did James heard the same word to Judas then some of them took the word and held it and some of them took the word and turned it down when they turned down that word in non seed the church age book says in none seed there's nothing to quicken what is none seed what is done seed we're supposed to be farmers or what is non seed hybrid seed it'll produce one time that's it it has nothing to carry it on non seed means hybrid high breeding in this message is what adding anything or in the Bible to coming down through adding any thoughts whatsoever to that Bible it'll take away the true meaning of that word all right when the Holy Ghost Falls what can you follow him you understand one took the word and hailed it they cherished it they couldn't understand that even said we don't understand what says thou hast the words of eternal life they went to the upper room the Holy Ghost failed and quickened him Judas didn't make it to that upper room experience of that and now he was in the upper room where the water the the supper was at but he wasn't at the upper room when it comes with a holiday and like I said last night and I keep saying it over and over you don't think the Bible said Jesus was seen of over 500 brethren after his resurrection the brother Aaron I mean you would be there and you would see him raised and you'd know it with him and you you could talent and not you were just with the rest of them and you knew it and he says now you go to the Upper Room away well something went wrong with three hundred and eighty people that had seen the little boy if I could just see the Lord race I'd be alright you're a line through your teeth you don't even understand any what you see is what you believe it's what you can hold on to is your own belief not what you see you can see a lot of things Satan can impersonate anything that God has but he can't be the Holy Ghost why did that 380 not make it to the upper room and I'm as human as can be I'd have never said they were all lost because it calls them brethren they could have come on later and got the Holy Ghost I'm not saying they didn't well then they're saying why didn't they make it to the upper room they didn't count it worthy they didn't count it to be anything that he was telling them was going to take place evidently and they never made it whose fault was it they had to seed right they heard the word but then when it come to the point of having to go do something they walked away what about it you mean you could hear the word you mean you can hear the word and turn and walk away I pray to you I should be open to the day that we're in you ought to be able to say amen to that because you see it happening right among the people of the message they're just walking away now what is it don't tell me it's like I've always told you eyeing against no brother night against none of them but you tell me that a brother could preaching this message for twenty or thirty years and he priests great things but when he walked away from the message what happened first his wife could or her now the Bible says not to do that you don't have to have a prophet to tell you not to cut your hair the Bible says don't do it and went right back the life was now I'm saying they could have chopped it on put life they'd seen the guy with a beer in his hand they're sending me a thing to wear that I can hear it they got a thing going now there's a man in I won't try to quote that part closer I'll get to the thing but today's a man got over 20,000 in her church he's saying that he's come to take her place of brother Brandon you want a little more now this is what was told me so I haven't viewed if they take a great Catholic archbishop got up and announced the man has to be the one that would take brother branham's play mm-hmm come on now hey how close is that this Catholic gets out and says this man is I get the tape we'll try to pass it around look at it I'm just saying what would set them that close to be sent to me I don't really care but for your benefit see how can you preach all the life that you preached for 30 40 years and then turn around and turn against it do you realize though that that anointing is still on those people you know those people that are turning against the message the anointing is on them I tried to explain that didn't finish the class not I probably shouldn't even say something about it but I mentioned it and dropped it brother mote years ago told me something that it took a long time to get it down into me that I could understand he said brother Dale there's no difference between free love and legalism I said brother I can't see that because legalism goes that away free love goes that way you keep going into legalism you wind up in free love because in legalism you're trying your best to appease an angry god legalistic ideas and thoughts you're trying to do it and you're saying I know I'm saved because I done this I spoke in tongues I cried I was there when God gave me this whole ego I know it I see somebody going into free love what do they do they don't condemn me to do that sure they gonna think I need to be condemned wedding my brother runs that ain't snake thing got no helps right do you understand what I'm saying look what's happening if you don't see it without one illustration when that brother set up there denounced brother branham's message and the first thing that happened his wife started cutting her now that's known that ain't just talking about it well you tell me that wouldn't okay let's go but you can be anointed with the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life and be lost like I told him lies not back in the seventies when these things was coming out I will remember him we had ministers meetings on to the cloud out in Arizona whether it was right or what is wrong what the dates was that was in the 70s we had ministers meetings on these things we had ministers meetings on this right here because we didn't have all the abilities to search the message to be able to give quotes and I remember they get up and they say you could say but brother that that can't be that you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day your life and die and go to hell because you can't do it you can't take the Holy Ghost to hell you can't put it in hell you can't do it so then there was no way to answer satisfactory until finally somebody come up and found I believe us and North it not where brother Brennan said you are knowing it on your spirit he said you can be anointed on your spirit by the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost now you got the right answer it's on your spirit it's where the anointing comes no the Holy Ghost came into my soul That's all right. There's a genuine there's Peter. But did the--now here's the Word. you know, this represents the Word. Peter took that Word in and held it or it held him, it's a better way of saying it. Alright, when the Holy Ghost fell what happened? Peter was justified and sanctified. Which means he was cleansed and set in order for service and everything was perfectly right. The Word had done the cleansing. The Word had done it; "Sanctify them through thy Truth cause thy Word is Truth. Is that Jesus? St. John 17. Peter and them--the Word had cleaned them. Like brother Branham said about David. He said "Look at David what he had." He said "But all he needed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost." What did Peter and them need then? There they were with a clean vessel full of Word. they didn't understand everything, they said they didn't. Jesus kept telling them when the Holy Ghost comes I'm gonna send it in my Name. It'll come; it'll quicken to you what to do, and don't worry about it. Go on! And when the Holy Ghost fell it made that Word alive. There's your new birth. You say what happened to this guy? We're gonna change out and just use the one okay. But that's the two guys. What happened? Peter and them got the Word and the Holy Ghost quickened it. You agree with that now? You go that way? What about the others? The cares of life. Are you watching? The things of the world. What happened? Satan entered in and brought back into the man the 7 times worse. Right? So after it was all finished, what are you going to quicken? There's nothing there. There was nothing in Judas to quicken. It had been taken out. It was there. It was there. It was there in both of them. But the cares of life and the things took it out. Took out what? The Word. Or you listen to somebody interpret false Word and it took out that Word. And when you do what could you quicken? There's nothing in the vessel to quicken. The anointing can strike but it can't go in and do anything. It can't quicken a Trinity. Oh I tell you what, now that that Trinity when it was revealed to me you ever heard people say that I've heard people in this message say that they say well more that that - so that - lords then thanks man they when that was revealed to me I was waiting on that - soul doctrine to come out I've heard that statement made I said how in the world could be waiting on something that ain't true because they can't be - Lords they can't be two souls the to soul doctrine was what God give you a soul Satan give you so I challenge that on the basis of God's Word and the prophets message show me where Satan could ever give you anything other than piss twisting turning he can't give you he can't create what you see when I Holy Ghost fell I shouted I cried I've done everything you know I know now last week I had a little problem now we're not done something wrong but I feel like I'm saved I don't think I spend enough to be lost see what are you doing you're propping up yourself right well I'll tell you what that's what I was trying to get across life's on this boat and tried to get you to cross lies not you are a body spirit and soul it doesn't matter what you do about the names of these things make sure you keep them in three line one line being a body the next line being you can call it spirit or slowly the one it doesn't matter to me but make sure you give it memory reason conscious affections then the center man you give that either faith or doubt now you're writing 50 60 and on when the Prophet ended it all up he didn't have to go and preach a long sermon about how in his early ministry he said body so spirit then in the Ministry of 65 write in 64 he's taught body spirit and soul but see if he hadn't told it that way the Bible would have been incorrect because the Bible said it divides the difference and he said because of the open of these things we can understand do you realize what I'm getting that do you realize that this person out here you don't mount to a sign that's your body all he's doing is just something you living in well my body let's see your body can't lust now I'm quoting I'll give you this one in here where brother Ron said you don't even thank with your body he said you think with your spirit as a man thinketh in his heart not in his thumping gizzard North natural heart in order to brain it's not it's that spirit in you that motivates you to make you to think right that's the difference you and a dog but see I'm asking you a question they said brother Branham said to Christians sin he said yes did brother Branham said do you you know how to listen ones huh do you back sighs he said everyday well I don't know whether I don't know I'm so confused with with with whether it's older spirit or whatever I'm confused well just get out the confusion and gets it line up number one you got five senses of the body number two you got five senses of the second room number three you got one sense faith or doubt let's do it the other way and handle it and forget it because I'm asking you a simple question how does a Christian sin when the Bible said he that sinneth is lost dead we get the Prophet said you seen every day come on church we taught this in the Baptist Church you don't like me because of that but I remember in the Baptist Church where we was taken we said well what it is is it if we're not really this we're not really going out and Atlantis Lee sin I wish brother dick was here he'd explain it to you better not can we're not going out that landis Lee sin we just do little bitty times well according to my Bible ain't no big thing ain't ain't no little sin they sin why would the Prophet say you sin if you send in your throw your love if you sin in that sin or realm whatever you want to call it you're lost but if you've seen in that spirit realm of reading the memory console design then you're not lost your soul will correct you and bring you back into line then bringing it to you to show that you're wrong that's what I've tried to explain 40 years it don't bother you it don't bother you for your prophet to say that you see them every day well brother Brandon word I said what hope do I have and I quote it wrong last night let her run said that Jesus was tempted of women I've caught it in the lustful part and corrected it down there but I'm making sure if anybody hears that or anything they tell know what I'm saying but a renin said Jesus was tempted where was he tempted my Bible says you can't tempt God so it had to be in Jesus's spirit realm not as so because your body can't sin well I just wish I'd get this over I don't worry about that old body that's why you don't understand the way I preach i dont preach quit this quit that do this and do that and it makes you saved I've never taught nothing like that and never will code it's not scriptural if when you let God take out these things you let him come in and take away the need the desires the things in you let him do it because you can't quit it you get rid of the Dagmar's another one quick as you get that demon out in another one coming back trying to condemn you going all right do we believe the Prophet he said we see in every day so where do you sin well we don't need to know cuz we're not probably garbage-can to you and you're thinking cause that's exactly what you're doing you're taking out things that could be quickened you're letting those things we've taken out of you by some demon and when you wind up you wind up with an empty vessel trying to say it's fool oh I know my vessel is empty because I remember when I was clean amen but that ain't all of it you got to put nothing in put the word in and let it take it out sanctification and not you quit smoke smoking drinking gambling off that's not sanctification that's what we teach is sanctification sanctification is the unclean spirit going out of you that's what Jesus taught sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit can I quote it that away but it runs the justification of work of the older spirit sanctification is work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism hears the Holy Spirit that's why you can be justified sanctifying you still lost the anointing is no different in a bride person that becomes a bride birth center it's lost the anointing comes across to try to quicken what you got that's the purpose of the anointing what's the rain for little rains for making mud holes in my yard don't lie oh that's about as good as we can go what is the rain farm to make whatever you have planted come forth alive and that's exactly what the preaching of the word does it does that brother Branham said preachers what do you do he said a preacher does only one thing he said he breaks the spell that Satan has over the people's eyes to work God can speak straight to the people now you need that quote that's identical a preacher all I do is have a gift they'll be able to do one or the other I can stand right here and make you mad as a Hornet or I can stand right here and make you shout but I can take my gift and sell ice cream to an Eskimo no you don't understand gifts gifts are eternal now I'm talking about 500 minutes per gift now gifts are like speaking in tongues out that's in the body across five full ministry the gifts you know that brother Branham said the báb to use well let's go come on what time we'll go all right then it's a church or church and what you want come on I'm trying to find you okay the order number eight let's read Feist I got the baptism so you saying that I got the baptism with the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so so now worse the baptism of the Holy Ghost do what does it do it strikes that second dream I've tried to explain it you've done this out here justification sanctification cleanse the vessel and you took the word and you held it and when you hold it then the Holy Ghost can come in quick it what you got in there but you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you know what I'm saying we'll get to it in a minute he said that's on your spirit go ahead to the next one still be lost if the baptism on your spirit it's not coming into your soul it quickens what you got in your soul then that way it can quicken two souls two lords all these doctrines in the message it can't quicken the Trinity you can't do those things cause it's not part of the word come on trying to do God a service out his will now notice in this now David thought he had everything in order and he was inspired see how the Holy Spirit kind of known a man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing I wish you'd write that down steady on that it's got to be in the order of the anointing the Holy Ghost fell in was in the street the Bible says in the last days I'll pour out my spirit on all flesh did it fall on the Zeus the street around the world no it fell on those that were sitting in Azusa Street praying for God to come in do something it didn't do it on 10th Street and 15th Street it done it on whatever the street was it would just to say that you pull out his spirit on all flesh don't mean it poured out on everybody in the world you got to get in a religious order come on see how this holy spirit could have known a man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside spirit can be anointed with the Holy Spirit holy goat and the soul as dark as pitch now where did he say you're anointed by the spirit on your spirit anointed with the Holy Spirit the outside spirit can be anointed with the Holy Spirit the soul is darkest be the cocklebur grows on the same water a little bill but the soul of it is cover raising only we get false teachers can rise teaching all kind of trinitarianism and everything else and be anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but the word here that's what it does see what I mean now it's alright to teach this I guess he said I'm not in a denomination this was teeth is not in the world listen all right what is it go ahead is to what was that 9 ok going 10 I'm going to give you now this is modern events made clear by prophecy now we found out today that many people just can't believe it every spirit feel people even spirit-filled people I'm gonna give you one that'll choke you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul did he say how many times have I told you you're not mourning again in your body you're not born again in your spirit the only born-again in your soul you don't need the new birth it would be good to have it but it doesn't work don't have anything to do with the soul that's the baptism another baptism one in just a minute we're brother Brendan says the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just a temporal gift okay don't have anything to do with it that's the baptism see here's the inside soul in here that has to come from God but then on the outside of you you have five senses and find out inlets in your contact your earthly home the inside you have a spirit in there you have five outlets your conscience and love and so forth five outlets to that spirit remember in that spirit you can be baptised with a genuine spirit of God and still be lost in that spirit you can't be baptized in your soul be lost so it ought to be realized as what's happening something that spirit realm is where it's all that go ahead to the next yesterday that would have been number go to number 11 I got the baptism the Holy Spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's just a temporal gift for you baptism on your spirit is just a temporal guilt temporal means of temporary you realize that so that you have can be eternal that spirit is not eternal I don't care how much it's anointed it's not eternal that body is not eternal what do we need we need a change of this body and the spirit chain but - so we don't need nothing - yet other than the point of letting the word come in us and go back out because if your soul is born again it's eternal so what's he saying the baptism own your spirit it's just a temporal gift the real gift is your soul and down in Darcy that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the Word of God and the will of God and there you grow up you say well I belongs don't have one thing to do with it that if you don't line up with that word there's something wrong see you see your fall real father ain't God because that real start in your soul before there was even a spirit come on remember when it all souls are mine they ain't no such thing as your so belonging to the devil devil can't give you so the Bible said all souls are mine but it also says that soul that sinneth shall die it never says the spirit that sent us you'll die and this is a such solace why because you can't do it all right before that was even the spirit so your soul was first go back to Genesis 1:1 now right let us make man in our own image what do you make later soul come on that soul didn't come from God see let's let me read it because that real start in your soul before there even was a spirit it was your soul that soul didn't come from God then it wasn't a germ of God to begin with you deceived you're in a patch of weeds and burn the world's record of the weeds coming forth acting like the world loving the world it's because the love of God is not in you and now there'll be false anointed ones in the last days not Jesus's they wouldn't stand for that they're anointed with the spirit to do the signs and wonders that Christ did but won't line up with his word you wanna do like who was it Benny Hinn that walked out on the earth and turned and walked back anybody won't try I ain't going to cuz I know if I step off your mohit now God tells me to I'll do the best I can I'll tell I'll step out cuz I'm gonna argue with him but I'm just trying to get a point to you what about people that can do all kind of things like that you realize that Janice and Jam breeze could do everything Moses did bring everything Moses brought the one thing they couldn't do was take away their plagues read your Bible they could bring them but you couldn't take them away well well that would represent divine healing I believe that's right or the prophets okay let's see where do we get temporal get all right go ahead to number 11 what excuse me I'm gonna get my numbers right I'm still on number 11 but we don't read that so lot go to the boy I'll leave it on well that's fine you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't mean that you're saved not by a long ways brother Dale you're confusing me I confuse the prophet blame him for confusing you and have I become your enemy because I found it I mean you're mad at me because I'm saying if you're lost brother Browns won saying it I'm just reading well you're fine it's me that's good you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't mean that you're saved not by a long ways looking here you are a Trinitarian or trying being you are inside this little fella here is the soul the next is the spirit neighs inside coming out right and the next is a body now you've got five senses in this body to contact your earthly home they don't contact the rest of it you got five senses of the Spirit here of love and rent and so forth like that but in here is where you live that's what you are the soul what are you and God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living soul brother Brendan said he had eternal life now you go argue that I got the quote so he said it he had eternal life well you know if he had eternal life Eve must have got it too because she had the same soul okay in the end of that you say well you're confusing that much more good maybe you'll go home and study alright let's see what else we got that's number number thirteen or that you're in a cycle of three which you're one person like father son Holy Ghost cycle of three but one person three attributes of the same guard fatherhood three offices like fatherhood sonship and holy go and you are body spirit and soul now the outside body has five inlets to it to contact your earthly home see taste feel smell in here the inside which is a spirit it has five senses conscience love and so forth but the inside of that but the inside of that the sole has but one thing all right now what's that's where you live but look the spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain things and you do it but that don't mean you're saved think of it confers prophesied Judas cast out Devils see the spirit anointed him this rain falls on the just and the unjust and the spirit can actually make witness of it and still it isn't so because if that soul hasn't come from God it can make all the impersonations out there but it cannot be real you can act healing you can act you how you can act like you receive Christ Christians gonna act like you know they're Christians and that can ever end so good at it but that don't mean that you're saved that's exactly right the spirit can be there the real genuine spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside soul that never dies it's got eternal life what about it let's go on to the next what's the next one fourteen or did we read it is that the one we just read okay now inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born in to the earth and the breath of life is breathing to you that spirit of a world in nature because it was not given from God listen but it was given permitted by God why because it wasn't eternal a baby's not eternal it doesn't have an eternal body spirit though so his Spirit is permitted of God right what it was given permitted now you got that every child that's born into the world it's born in sins having an iniquity come to the world speak life that's right so that person inside there is a sinner to begin with but now it's got two five in listens that's the thing first I know it's doubt conscious and love choice reason there is five inlets to the Spirit you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculties at all your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being because reason doesn't see touch feel smell or hear reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or if you're out your body is lying there dead but your spirit can still reason there is five senses that controls the inside man that now to the last man which is the soul there is only one sense that controls that and that is free moral agency what are you getting at what is the new birth well it's the baptism of the Holy Spirit the prophecy says you can have it every day your life let's still be lost what is the new birth it's the birth of the word the word is might alive in your soul then works back out through your spirit the things where I where go ahead all right and now the reason that people today they don't forget this now and you'll see what the what the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is now let's read it now people can live in the spirit they can dance in the spirit they can shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit and they can absolutely have the real Spirit of God anointing on that spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be without that spirit because their good thing gave me no hope I thought you're supposed to know the truth is most set you free okay where did we get to what's the next one number 15 okay that's the top post in the church what's he getting to Sunday next time he remembers basic their spirits are anointed in this second realm what's the second real memory reason conscious affections that's where the Spirit is anointing from all right go ahead to the next you might dance in the spirit you might still speak with tongues and them things are fine but that's not it yet no sir remember the Bible said in the last days there shall come false Christ not false Jesus they won't stand for that false anointed ones they're absolutely anointed with the spirit with the Holy Spirit and still false there's - there's a third people three there's three people of you the outside of it is the body you've got five senses you contact your earthly home with it the inside of the spirit there's five senses dark love and conscious and so forth you contact but the inside of that is the soul see what is that the inside of that seed is a nature and that nature display displays itself it can stand in the same field right there with the weed the weed and the wheat stand together resourcing just as much its head is down if starving for a drink when a rain comes the cook of work and shout just as loud as the weekend but by their fruits you shall know them what are we going let's see if I can read two more I go ahead to the next one should be eighteen or what at seventy from Christ revealed in his own word and lie Sunday when we was going into these cycles about how that the five senses on the outer rim that's the end let five senses to the body there's only one way you can get into the body that's by these five senses see taste field smelling here see faith comes by hearing you got here for no other way to contact the body on the inside of that man is a man called spirit and he has five senses think thought and thought in love and conscious and also for now you can't think with your body you think with your mind and in there is where the many of Christians only stop they can just like the corn in the field and the weed in the field they can be anointed with the same Holy Spirit that the real believer is anointed with but down on the inside of that next room the third room is the soul and that's predestinated by God and those were the real seed germ layers is in dark right today so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God has but he cannot bring that word word by word now how do you know is whether or not that spirit in you agrees of the word you know you're sitting there on the town I'm going to illustrate it now so you're sitting there saying I know you're reading what the Prophet says but I don't believe it now what gives you that right if I said it you have a right to argue but if I read it what you just read part it come on you got it come on come on up here come here and show me where than I just handpick stuff that's why I wanted it all to be given to you because you can know at least is this was nineteen and seventy eight or nine I've been teaching this over forty years I don't have to worry not exalted just telling the God's honest truth because when God showed it to me he showed me what it was that anointing on your spirit but it doesn't mean you're Christian you can dice and shout this in the inside listen what is the true sign that's your Christian and give you body to be burned you can do all kinds of things do everything what's the sign the Prophet said whether or not your sighing and crying for the abomination have done in the city that's what I said when the brothers that we all know step down of course what he's done that's his business but I haven't come here and bound by lambasted him at all what I've prayed for him have you have you really prayed for it you have no right to condemn him to your first pray for now that's brother Dale I'm not quoting Jesus or brother branham that's the way I live I have no right to condemn anybody that I haven't prayed for him first right so what is it simple thing of the Bible there's Peter named the disciples Jesus kept pouring the word in then what had happened when the Holy Ghost fell under their Pentecost he didn't have to go down in here and get all this and stir it up it just come right across it there's like rain and dropped in and says it's alive but what happened to those that didn't what happened to Caiaphas when the Holy Ghost fell he had nothing for it to follow me God can't quicken word that's not genuine he can't quicken the Trinity because there's no such thing I can't be done do you wanted one scan all the way you can understand it got to bring them all to the same place and let that anointing be at the same place but what it does you took the word and held it it'll quicken that word but if we take the word and get our own ideas and thoughts he can't quicken that it's our responsibility to study the word and let the word be in the field that's just like standing out in your garden and sand Lord I'm glad my garden is coming up and I walk up I said well you got well I didn't plant nothing but it's coming up say why yeah okay see my bees going the stuff three years later we're still looking the same bean and corn ain't working that don't do it the same word comes to the whole people there ain't but one gospel it comes to all people but it's what we do with it let's take it take these home with you you got any questions let me know later we'll try our best to cover it I've never done this all right we're gonna well have no music nothing with a single song I love him and then if anybody hasn't need the altars open so I you have a need coming let's see well brother Dale what do you believe the new birth is it's the birth of the word that I've cooked and according to the Prophet each one of these is a birth so it don't end just by you getting the new birth it just begins that's one reason I know what I know because what he told me years ago I can stand right now and say thank you Lord even two personal things when he told me that most of the people in the end time would die and go by the grave the followers of this message I said that 40 years ago I'm not tobacco but in no way was I ever references to anybody that would be lost but see we don't want it that away why why can't you believe it Dunaway when he speaks to you what are you afraid of he told me years ago he said there'll be a lot of people come from Athens to Lola there's a lot of you standing here you were to say brother Dale even if you're a false and everything in the world wrong at least you said what I would do and I am now doing it what about it father we thank you for today and we ask you to be with us guide us and direct us in your love Lord we ask you to just forgive us when we fail you in the things that we bring forth and our own thoughts and ideas forgive us bring it out in your own self it's bless us as we go either naturally Oh bring us back this afternoon and Lord for the children too to sing in worship about you and then for brother Nathanael to bring the evening message to us Lord we just thank you for these young ones that are coming along that can take this message and cure it on because we're getting older we're dying away we're we're all pricing on the yet you have never have left us without anything you've always been there when we had need of and answered all of our questions we love you and we thank you got us in Jesus name you dismiss
