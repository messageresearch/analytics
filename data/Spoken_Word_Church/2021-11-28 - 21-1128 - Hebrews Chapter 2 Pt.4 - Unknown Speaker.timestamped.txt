[0:01] god bless you this morning
[0:03] let's turn over in hebrews chapter two
[0:05] we got to verse nine i think last time
[0:09] let's just go to the lord in prayer real
[0:11] quick before we get into the word lord
[0:12] god we're so grateful to be able to
[0:14] gather together and i pray lord that you
[0:15] just bless the reading of your word and
[0:17] open our understanding we ask in the
[0:18] name of the lord jesus amen
[0:22] so uh just just to real summarize
[0:25] briefly the the things that we read last
[0:28] time
[0:30] or the things that we're about to get
[0:32] into um paul was paul's lay in a
[0:34] foundation so that we can so that the
[0:36] hebrews that he was speaking to could
[0:38] have an understanding that that this man
[0:40] jesus that came and died for our sins
[0:43] made a way to deliver us from the fear
[0:45] of death and uh to take the stinger and
[0:48] uh the that take that stinger in himself
[0:50] so that we don't have to
[0:52] uh
[0:53] he hate that through death he might
[0:55] destroy them they have the power of
[0:56] death that is the devil and and uh
[0:59] what a profound statement that we don't
[1:01] have to fear death anymore so we will
[1:03] see what we
[1:04] as we as we kind of dive into that see
[1:06] what that means but let's just read
[1:08] through the uh the next few verses and
[1:11] just just so that we can set a
[1:12] background before we get into this
[1:14] and paul said in verse 9 but we see
[1:16] jesus who was made a little lower than
[1:17] the angels for the suffering of death
[1:19] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[1:21] the grace of god should takes death for
[1:23] every man
[1:24] for it became him for whom are all
[1:26] things and by whom are all things and
[1:28] bringing many sons unto glory to make
[1:30] the captain of their salvation perfect
[1:32] through sufferings for both he that
[1:35] sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
[1:37] are all of one for which cause he is not
[1:40] ashamed to call them brethren
[1:43] saying i will declare thy name unto my
[1:46] brethren in the midst of the church will
[1:48] i sing praise unto thee and again i will
[1:50] put my trust in him and again behold i
[1:53] am the children which god has given me
[1:55] for as much then as the children are
[1:57] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[2:00] himself likewise took part of the same
[2:02] that through death he might destroy him
[2:04] that had the power of death that is the
[2:06] devil and deliver them who through fear
[2:09] of death were all their lifetimes
[2:11] subject to bondage
[2:12] for verily he took not on him the nature
[2:14] of angels but he took on him the seed of
[2:17] abraham
[2:19] wherefore in all things that behooved
[2:20] him to be made like unto his brethren
[2:22] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[2:25] high priest in things pertaining to god
[2:27] to make reconciliation
[2:29] for the sins of the people for in that
[2:31] he himself has suffered being tempted he
[2:34] is able to sucker them
[2:36] he is able to sucker them that are
[2:38] tempted
[2:39] there's a lot to unpack you you think
[2:42] about maybe put yourself in the shoes of
[2:44] the people that were sitting there
[2:45] listening to paul back then and see each
[2:47] of these statements that he would make
[2:48] it initially or it would kind of almost
[2:50] be like wow what is he saying uh kind of
[2:53] kind of like how sometimes we are today
[2:55] when a minister says something that
[2:57] seems very strange
[2:59] but over time you begin to unpack those
[3:01] things and the spirit begins to reveal
[3:02] what each of those are are speaking
[3:05] about so let's just kind of dwell on
[3:07] each of these as we go through
[3:09] if we go to the next slide hebrews just
[3:12] to do a quick background the last time
[3:14] we were talking about this this little
[3:16] statement but we see jesus
[3:18] and paul in god's provided place of
[3:20] worship said but lord it does delight
[3:22] our hearts when we see jesus glorified
[3:24] among us when we see him glorified when
[3:27] we see his word which he is the word
[3:29] when we see we can read it here in the
[3:31] bible where he promised he would do it
[3:33] then see him work it right in us
[3:35] so when we see his word being revealed
[3:37] into uh in us and it begins to open up
[3:39] and then we see the effect of the word
[3:41] in our lives and the effect of the word
[3:43] in our church
[3:44] then we see jesus
[3:46] so we can be like that deacon that uh
[3:48] that little girl asked him do you do do
[3:50] you can you see god and he said i see
[3:52] god everywhere i look you you when
[3:55] you're when you're driving in your car
[3:56] on the way to work or driving sitting at
[3:58] home you you see jesus because the word
[4:00] is opening up to you and you can see the
[4:02] effect that it has in your life
[4:04] and and we'll go to the next the next
[4:07] slide we see jesus who was made a little
[4:09] lower than the angels for the suffering
[4:11] of death crowned with glory and honor
[4:13] that he by the grace of god should taste
[4:16] death for every man
[4:18] so tasting is really an experience
[4:21] tasting if we go to the next slide to
[4:24] taste it means to experience if you if
[4:26] you if you tasting uh some some kind of
[4:28] bitter fruit then you can tell somebody
[4:30] i know that that fruit is bitter that
[4:32] whatever that tastes some good lasagna
[4:35] or taste whatever it is you now you you
[4:37] have experienced it and you can share
[4:40] with somebody that i know what that's
[4:43] like because i've experienced it so when
[4:45] the bible says that he tasted death for
[4:47] every man he experienced what death is
[4:49] so now he can deliver you from death
[4:52] because he he experienced it
[4:54] psalm psalms 34 8 says oh taste and see
[4:57] that the lord is good so everywhere the
[4:58] bible uses the word the the the metaphor
[5:01] taste it's talking about experience
[5:04] taste and see that the lord is good how
[5:06] do you taste and see is that you
[5:07] actually experience it you come to
[5:08] church and you hear the word preached
[5:11] and and uh something begins to quicken a
[5:14] desire in your heart to get closer to
[5:15] god and you go through a journey like
[5:17] abraham did and all the things that the
[5:19] scripture talks about and then you can
[5:20] tell somebody about your experience
[5:23] god delivered me from my past god god
[5:25] redeemed me he he brought me from where
[5:27] i used to be to where i am now and
[5:29] you've got an experience that you can
[5:30] share with somebody else and first peter
[5:32] says
[5:33] as newborn babies
[5:35] think about how the phrasing of this
[5:38] desire the sincere milk of the word
[5:41] that ye may grow there by desire the
[5:44] milk
[5:45] if so be ye have tasted that the lord is
[5:47] gracious if you have tasted if you've
[5:49] experienced it then keep eating the word
[5:52] if you've experienced that god that
[5:55] if you've tasted
[5:56] so so if we go to the next slide
[6:00] but we see jesus who was made a little
[6:02] lower than the angels for the suffering
[6:03] of death crowned with glory and honor
[6:05] that he by the grace of god should taste
[6:07] death so he tasted death he experienced
[6:09] it
[6:10] for every man
[6:12] and this is a little statement just we
[6:13] could sit on for a little bit because
[6:15] the gospel is really for every man we
[6:17] can get it our in our mind pigeon hole
[6:20] to the idea that it's only just for a
[6:21] few people and and it's not oh it's it's
[6:24] actually an open book it's the door has
[6:26] been opened up so that anybody that
[6:28] wants it
[6:30] you know brother brown gave that example
[6:32] that he he god voted for you and the
[6:34] devil voted for you and now what it
[6:36] depends on is how you are going to cast
[6:38] your vote
[6:39] so we run through some scriptures real
[6:40] quick to kind of back that up in first
[6:43] john 2 and he is the propitiation for
[6:45] our sins and not for ours only but also
[6:47] for the sins of the whole world
[6:49] anybody that wants it can come the door
[6:51] is open
[6:53] and the scripture that we quote a lot
[6:55] john 3 16 god so loved the world that he
[6:57] gave his only begotten son that
[6:59] whosoever believeth in him should not
[7:01] perish but have everlasting life the
[7:03] door is open to anybody that will
[7:05] believe
[7:06] and in revelation whosoever will let him
[7:08] take of the water freely and john 11 26
[7:12] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[7:14] shall never die believeth thou this
[7:16] whosoever so the door is open wide
[7:20] and on the next slide brother ramen and
[7:21] broken sisters he said and if you're
[7:23] thirsting this morning drink from it
[7:25] that's all you have to do
[7:27] god had provided a way for their thirst
[7:29] to thirsty children to partake freely of
[7:31] himself and god has provided a way for
[7:34] every man and woman this morning who was
[7:36] hungering and thirst
[7:38] so that's what paul's speaking of in
[7:40] hebrews chapter 2 verse 9 that he by the
[7:42] grace of god should taste death he
[7:44] experienced it for every man for anybody
[7:48] that wants it
[7:51] the next lie brother graham said in the
[7:52] queen of the south
[7:53] he said there's a pardon for every man
[7:56] that will hear and it's condemnation to
[7:58] those who does not hear it
[8:00] and he said in fellowship the stingers
[8:02] been pulled out of death
[8:04] for every man who will confess his sins
[8:07] and accept jesus christ's death in his
[8:09] dead
[8:10] for every man for anybody that will
[8:12] believe it the stingers pulled out
[8:14] now what what is the stinger
[8:16] let's go to the next the next slide
[8:19] brother said and when their eyes were
[8:21] open they knew him when he was preaching
[8:23] that sermon he said that's the reason
[8:24] god was made flesh in order to die that
[8:27] he could suffer and take the penalty
[8:29] upon himself
[8:32] he couldn't do it as long as he was
[8:34] jehovah and the spirit god the father
[8:35] and spirit could not do it but when god
[8:37] was made flesh and dwelt among us a
[8:39] human being then he could taste death
[8:42] and take the penalty they had put that
[8:44] he had put upon all human beings he took
[8:47] it upon himself and paid the price and
[8:49] we know we know the example that he gave
[8:51] that like a bee a bumble bee or a honey
[8:55] bee when it stings you it leaves the
[8:56] stinger in so he got stung
[8:59] so that you couldn't be stung but what's
[9:01] what's the stinger
[9:03] and i kind of want to dwell on that
[9:04] because we can see it looks like looks
[9:06] like there's a still a lot of stuff in
[9:08] the world
[9:09] it's just taking the sting out doesn't
[9:11] mean that you won't suffer anymore that
[9:12] you won't see somebody hooked up to a
[9:14] ventilator in the hospital with all the
[9:16] equipment beeping and that that's not
[9:18] what that means that there's not going
[9:19] to be hard times
[9:22] brother brown said and thus thy seed
[9:23] shall possess the gate of his enemy he
[9:25] said oh that sting of death
[9:27] you watch it in a person's faith face
[9:30] i've held them in my arms and see them
[9:32] quiver and straighten out and quivering
[9:34] straight down and cry and scream for
[9:36] mercy nothing like a sting of death now
[9:38] he's talking about somebody that doesn't
[9:40] have some confidence at their death
[9:41] they're dying and and but the stinger
[9:44] hadn't been taken out there's they still
[9:46] got this the the stinger in there
[9:48] they're they're they're crying out for
[9:49] mercy they know that the situation
[9:51] hasn't been resolved
[9:53] there's the sin situation
[9:55] he said you know when the bee of death
[9:57] began to buzz around him you know if a
[9:59] bee an insect has got a stinger if you
[10:01] ever have
[10:02] if he have ever sting deep enough it
[10:04] pulls its stinger out it hasn't got no
[10:07] more stinger after that and when death
[10:09] anchors its stinger and the virgin born
[10:11] son of god he pull the stinger out of
[10:14] death
[10:14] it doesn't have any more stinger in it
[10:17] the only thing it is is a bluff
[10:21] so again what's paul talking about by
[10:23] the grace of god jesus tasted death for
[10:26] every man he got stung
[10:28] so the stingers pulled out so let's go
[10:31] to the next slide what is what what is
[10:33] that stinger and paul tells us what the
[10:35] stinger is in first corinthians chapter
[10:37] 15
[10:38] o death where is thy sting
[10:40] o grave for where is thy victory the
[10:43] sting of death is sin
[10:45] the sting of death is sin
[10:47] and the strength of sin is the law
[10:49] what's that mean the strength of sin is
[10:50] the law the strength of the the law is
[10:53] the remember the finger pointer
[10:55] so when you've done it wrong the law is
[10:56] there to point the finger but if you've
[10:58] got something to take the sin away
[11:01] if you ca if you can apply the
[11:03] righteousness of god to your sin
[11:06] then that's gonna that's gonna take the
[11:08] stinger away that's why paul said thanks
[11:10] be to god which giveth us the victory
[11:13] through our lord jesus christ
[11:17] so so you can see here i've got a little
[11:19] picture of what what takes what takes
[11:21] the sting away the sting of death is sin
[11:24] but if we can if the righteousness of
[11:26] christ can actually be applied to us
[11:28] like as illustrated in that drawing then
[11:30] that takes the sting of sin away
[11:34] his righteousness is applied so that's
[11:36] why he had to die on the cross so that
[11:38] when we believe on him he can give us
[11:40] back the holy ghost his own life and
[11:43] takes away the sting of death so then
[11:45] then now you've got confidence when
[11:47] you're when you're when you're faced
[11:48] with death when you're coming to the end
[11:50] of your road you know that the sting has
[11:52] been taken away like paul was when he
[11:54] put his head on that chopping block how
[11:56] could a man with confidence come to a
[11:58] place where he could just lay his head
[11:59] down and say chop away is because the
[12:02] sting had been taken away he knew that
[12:04] sin
[12:05] that the antidote for sin had been
[12:07] applied to his life
[12:09] and he wasn't coming there uh to that
[12:11] place uh crying and screaming for mercy
[12:14] and i'd like that illustration he just
[12:16] gave but he knew that the sting
[12:18] had been taken away
[12:22] now paul in hebrews chapter 2 verse 10
[12:24] he said he said in bringing for it
[12:26] became him for whom are all things
[12:30] and by whom are all things
[12:32] and bringing many sons into glory to
[12:34] make the captain of their salvation
[12:36] perfect through sufferings
[12:38] so we've got a captain and and i got a
[12:41] little picture here of
[12:44] this
[12:45] captain
[12:46] one of the captains in that battle of
[12:48] san juan down in cuba and he was running
[12:50] he's running ahead of his men and see
[12:52] all of his men are looking at him as the
[12:54] uh he's the one that knows where we're
[12:55] supposed to go
[12:57] and brother said the brains of the army
[12:58] lays in as captains the intelligence so
[13:01] you follow he's our captain he's the one
[13:03] that led us into battle and if we'll
[13:05] follow him and he's making the
[13:06] illustration if we'll follow him instead
[13:08] of instead of the doctor instead of
[13:10] people that will tell us wrong he's the
[13:12] one he's the one he's our leader he said
[13:15] you follow your captain if he's the
[13:16] right kind of a general if he's the
[13:18] right kind if he's a four-star general
[13:20] if he's proved if he's been proven to be
[13:23] right follow him though it may seem
[13:25] wrong to you go on the front do as he
[13:28] told you
[13:29] now you well you think about how
[13:31] profound that is as paul is saying all
[13:34] these things that are kind of hard to be
[13:35] understood to make the captain of their
[13:38] salvation perfect through sufferings
[13:40] each of these little statements
[13:42] seems like a lot to unpack and many
[13:44] times we don't understand but if we'll
[13:46] just do just just obey
[13:49] what the prophet of our day
[13:51] the the scripture says even when we
[13:54] don't understand it
[13:55] you think about the way that paul would
[13:57] lay things out is is very similar to
[14:00] to to how the experience of those early
[14:03] believers i believe was would would have
[14:05] been very similar to the way things kind
[14:07] of unfold today people back then there
[14:09] was a
[14:10] as paul would he would preach and there
[14:12] was a young man that fell asleep in the
[14:14] church and fell out of the balcony and
[14:15] he had to pray and pray and ask god to
[14:17] give him back his life
[14:19] people were falling asleep back then
[14:20] just as they are today things were hard
[14:22] to understand back then just as they are
[14:24] today people struggle with the sayings
[14:27] of paul just as they do today but he's
[14:29] saying we've got a captain
[14:31] if we'll follow our captain
[14:33] then he'll lead us into victory
[14:38] that's why on the next slide in the
[14:40] greatest battle ever fought he said oh
[14:42] look back here and say who is this great
[14:44] captain
[14:45] well i don't look back and see if it's
[14:46] dr so-and-so
[14:48] i see what the captain said
[14:50] you could you could kind of unfold that
[14:52] into a lot of different i don't look
[14:54] back and see
[14:55] maybe maybe even what your parents said
[14:57] maybe what grandma
[14:59] mama and granddaddy said your
[15:00] grandparents and their denominational
[15:02] system or whatever we look to see what
[15:04] our captain said what the word says he's
[15:07] our captain he said i see what the
[15:09] captain said he's the captain of our
[15:11] salvation
[15:12] what is salvation deliverance he's the
[15:15] captain of our deliverance
[15:17] so we've got a captain and brother
[15:18] braham said now and on the next slide he
[15:20] said to make paul as paul was saying to
[15:22] make the captain of the very salvation
[15:24] perfect through sufferings and and and
[15:27] and brother brown said the only way he
[15:28] could become the captain of our
[15:30] salvation he had to suffer
[15:33] so he went through a lot of thing that
[15:34] now the statement that brother brown was
[15:36] going to make is that he's our captain
[15:38] had to suffer and we're following him
[15:40] into battle so we got to suffer too
[15:43] that's kind of a hard thing to to
[15:45] swallow we don't like that but we life
[15:47] is hard a christian journey is not a
[15:50] flowery bed of roses it's full of of
[15:52] people rejecting your doctrine and
[15:54] people rejecting your your way and and
[15:57] like we were sitting around the other
[15:58] night fellowship and it seems like today
[16:01] it's gotten even worse than when i was a
[16:03] kid the way that people will look at our
[16:05] sisters and mock and scorn and i openly
[16:08] laugh at you and deride you as you walk
[16:09] by
[16:10] and
[16:11] you would go to the park and people will
[16:13] laugh at you because you've got a skirt
[16:14] on and things
[16:15] because you gotta you gotta suffer it's
[16:18] not supposed to be a flowery bed of ease
[16:21] and in luke chapter 9 verse 22 jesus
[16:23] said saying the son of man must suffer
[16:25] many things
[16:26] and be rejected he suffered and he
[16:30] really because he was rejected that's
[16:32] why they put him on the cross because he
[16:33] was rejected
[16:35] and isaiah 52 says many were standing at
[16:38] these his visage was mark his face was
[16:40] so marred more than any man and this is
[16:43] isaiah prophesied and his form more than
[16:46] the sons of men so he suffered brother
[16:49] said his face on that cross looked like
[16:51] like hamburger me
[16:53] like he had just been tore up so bad
[16:54] that he just was not even recognizable
[16:56] anymore
[16:57] and if we go to the next slide that paul
[17:00] and chad in chapter five of hebrews goes
[17:03] on to say though he were a son yet
[17:04] learned he obedience by the things which
[17:07] he suffered
[17:08] and being made perfect he became the
[17:10] author of eternal salvation and all them
[17:13] that obeyed him and brother brown when
[17:15] this mernian church age outlines that
[17:17] the very character of jesus was
[17:19] perfected by suffering
[17:21] and according to paul he has left his
[17:24] church a measure of suffering that they
[17:26] too by their faith in god while
[17:28] suffering for him
[17:30] would come to a place of perfection
[17:32] because when you suffer you're being
[17:34] mold your character what happens when
[17:36] you suffer you go through a rough time
[17:38] and you begin to put your confidence in
[17:40] god instead of your own abilities
[17:42] something your character begins to be
[17:43] molded by your suffering
[17:46] in james chapter 1 but let patience have
[17:49] her perfect work that ye may be perfect
[17:51] and entire
[17:52] wanting nothing and that's why god
[17:54] allows us to go through hard times
[17:57] so suffering where did jesus suffer if
[18:00] we go to the next slide
[18:01] one of the best examples of where his
[18:04] his character was molded by suffering
[18:06] was there in the garden of gethsemane as
[18:08] he said he his spirit was groaning
[18:11] within him and he was going through that
[18:13] battle do i stay alive
[18:16] and maybe have my own family
[18:18] maybe get married continue to live or do
[18:22] i die
[18:24] and do what god wanted me to do from the
[18:26] beginning so he said in luke chapter 22
[18:29] he said he was withdrawn from them about
[18:31] a stone's cast and kneeled down and
[18:32] prayed
[18:33] saying father if thou be willing remove
[18:36] this cup from me
[18:37] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[18:40] done that's the effect that suffering
[18:42] will have in all of our lives that you
[18:44] begin to you begin to look for god's
[18:46] will in your life you want god's will
[18:49] and what is his will his will is his
[18:51] word
[18:53] you can find his will
[18:55] in his word
[18:56] not by some emotion or by like that you
[18:59] saw but looking into his word
[19:02] that you know so many times we think we
[19:04] think that we've got god's will because
[19:06] somebody has told us a story or
[19:08] something or something that they feel is
[19:10] the will of god and yet you're out of
[19:13] the will of god because you're not
[19:14] walking in the word
[19:16] the will of god is his word
[19:19] and he said and being in agony
[19:22] he prayed more earnestly
[19:25] that's it doesn't that sound familiar
[19:27] with maybe your own journey where you
[19:29] get to a point where
[19:30] you've gotten in agony and it made you
[19:32] pray more earnestly because you
[19:35] you're looking for god to come on the
[19:37] scene because of your suffering and his
[19:39] sweat was as it were great drops of
[19:41] blood falling to the ground
[19:44] brother brahman's burning in church age
[19:45] again he said unless we suffer with him
[19:47] we cannot reign with him you have to
[19:50] suffer to reign
[19:51] the reason for this is that character
[19:53] simply is never made without suffering
[19:57] and the little temporary suffering we go
[19:59] through now is not worthy to be compared
[20:01] to the tremendous glory
[20:03] that will be revealed in us when he
[20:04] comes oh what treasures are laid up for
[20:07] those who are willing to enter into his
[20:09] kingdom
[20:11] through much tribulation
[20:13] now if we go to the next slide perfected
[20:15] through sufferings
[20:17] so if jesus went through if he bore a
[20:19] cross and suffered then we he's our
[20:21] captain so we've got to come behind him
[20:24] and and go through our own sufferings
[20:27] which is why jesus said in luke 9 23 he
[20:30] said to them all if any man will come
[20:32] after me let him deny himself and take
[20:36] up his cross daily and follow me
[20:38] for whosoever shall lose his life will
[20:41] save his life will lose it but whosoever
[20:43] will lose his life for my sake
[20:45] the same shall save it
[20:47] and it's a it's a difficult journey the
[20:50] christian journey is and that's what
[20:52] matthew chapter 7 is talking about
[20:54] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[20:56] way which leadeth into life
[20:58] and few there be that find it it's
[21:00] difficult
[21:02] in galatians chapter 2 verse 20 paul
[21:04] said i am crucified with christ
[21:07] nevertheless i live yet not i but christ
[21:10] liveth in me and the life
[21:13] the life which i now live in the flesh i
[21:16] live
[21:17] by the faith of the son of god
[21:20] so that means it's his life in us
[21:23] and it's his faith in us
[21:25] doing the living
[21:27] now if we go to the next slide that's
[21:28] what paul's talking about on the next
[21:29] verse but both he that sanctifieth
[21:33] and they who are sanctified
[21:35] are all of one
[21:36] it's his life in us
[21:39] the one that's doing the sanctifying and
[21:40] the ones that are sanctified
[21:42] are all of one
[21:44] and and brother brown said don't you see
[21:46] the vine and the branch there
[21:49] all one
[21:51] so let's look at that parable that jesus
[21:53] taught about the vine the vine and the
[21:55] and the branches he said in john 15
[21:58] he said i am the true vine
[22:01] and my father is the husband
[22:04] now you think about what he's saying
[22:05] there
[22:08] if he said i am the vine and you are the
[22:09] branches
[22:10] that means the light the life that is is
[22:14] living out in you
[22:15] is coming from a source
[22:18] it's coming it's coming from him and
[22:20] you're part of the same plant
[22:22] you're part of the same thing you're one
[22:24] with him the same life that was in him
[22:27] is living in you
[22:29] i am the vine and my father is the
[22:31] husband and every branch in me that
[22:33] beareth not fruit he taketh or what does
[22:35] that mean if you if you were to put a
[22:38] put a
[22:40] if you were to put seed in a womb and it
[22:42] didn't have a child
[22:44] you know something's wrong if you put
[22:45] seed in the ground and it doesn't come
[22:47] up and you don't have an apple tree or
[22:49] you have an apple tree and it doesn't
[22:50] bear forth fruit then what good is it
[22:53] i i planted a fruit tree in my backyard
[22:55] a while back and and it never bore more
[22:57] fruit so eventually i was like i i you
[23:00] know i need space for something else in
[23:02] my yard so i cleared it down and made
[23:04] you better use of that space
[23:07] if you don't bear forth fruit that's
[23:08] like somebody just this
[23:10] maybe you hear the word but you don't
[23:12] really believe it
[23:13] and it never bears forth so you've got
[23:16] to bear forth fruit that's why brother
[23:17] brown preached the sermon works works
[23:19] his faith expressed and is your life
[23:22] worthy of the gospel and the paradox and
[23:25] all those sermons about the life has to
[23:27] actually be manifested
[23:30] if you if you say that you believe but
[23:31] you actually don't bear forth fruits
[23:33] then then where is it on display
[23:37] he said every branch that beareth fruit
[23:40] he purgeth it that it may bring forth
[23:42] more fruit
[23:44] now ye are clean through the word which
[23:46] i've spoken unto you
[23:48] now see tie that in with what paul's
[23:50] saying here in verse 11 for both he that
[23:53] sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
[23:56] are all of one
[23:58] so what makes you clean
[24:00] the one doing the cleaning
[24:02] and the one being clean are all one how
[24:05] are you one because he sanctified you by
[24:08] his word
[24:09] and when you receive his word he cleans
[24:11] you out
[24:12] that i think that's so
[24:14] difficult sometimes from to for us to
[24:16] grasp we think that we're going to be
[24:19] deliberate maybe when you're a baby
[24:20] christian you think that you're going to
[24:21] be delivered from that uh that that
[24:23] smoking or whatever your problem you're
[24:25] having you're dealing with that that
[24:27] vaping and things just by maybe just a a
[24:30] single outpouring of the holy ghost or
[24:32] just a feeling or motion but the word is
[24:34] what claims your life and you're sitting
[24:37] under the influence of the word being
[24:39] preached and the musicians should go
[24:40] ahead and come forward and we'll stop on
[24:41] that you're sitting under the influence
[24:43] of the word and it's taking effect on
[24:45] your life as you believe it and by and
[24:48] by it's driving out the unclean things
[24:51] and cleaning you out
[24:52] the word is what is sanctifying you
[24:55] and we'll stop on that
[24:57] god bless you
[25:02] [Applause]
