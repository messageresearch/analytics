TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen god bless you this morning and uh i'm filling in for brother bob this morning so y'all just pray for me it's always good to be in the house of the lord and uh so this morning uh we're gonna look in uh proverbs chapter four and uh just wanna speak to the author before reading the scripture this morning heavenly father we just so thankful lord for another opportunity to be in your house lord together around your word and father we just pray that you just come in a special way minister to each one lord help us this morning lord we just pray for each one has a need here this morning lord you know what the needs are we just committed you and we just pray that you bless our brother chris this morning as he comes to bring the word we're just touching touch our ears our hearts to receive from you in this this day in jesus name we pray amen amen look at the word uh diligence this morning and proverbs 4 verse 20 says my son attend to my words and climb thine air under my sayings let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life unto those that find them and help to all their flesh keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life now the word diligence got several different definitions here diligence is the quality of working carefully and with a lot of effort steady earnest and energetic effort devoted and painstaking work and application to accomplish an undertaking assiduous the meaning showing great care attention and effort marked by careful unremitting attention or persistent application earnestness in accomplishing promoting or striving after anything to give all diligence interest oneself most earnestly so i was i was thinking on these this subject it was a quote by abraham lincoln and he said the the leading rule for a lawyer as for the man of every other calling is diligence he said leave nothing for tomorrow which can be done today and so i was thinking about giving diligence and proverb solomon speaking in proverbs and the different scriptures that mention this and here in um in romans speaking of abraham and paul speaking of abraham being justified by faith and it says what shall we say then after abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted for him for righteousness now verse 11 says and he received a sign of circumcision the seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them which are not of the circumcision only but also but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being not uncircumcised for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith so we know that abraham received the promise through faith and it was counted to him by faith but he had to believe but then his actions proved that he had faith is what james says here in in 2 james 2 20 and it says but thou thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham or father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see us thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was unputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she received the messengers when she had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also so we know in the scripture and many times people have argued and they see there's a contradiction there but understanding that you know god sees a man's faith and he imputed that as for righteousness for abraham because he what he saw what he that he would believe but the outside world what people see is our works because if you have faith as james said fakes without works is dead so you're gonna have to have works people are gonna have to see that you actually believe because if you all the way through the scripture you know noah received the word from the lord that there was gonna be rain there was no way of proving that but that's what noah believed science could prove that there was no water in the heavens but no one said it's going to rain god gave him that word it's impossibility but it wasn't impossible because god spoke it would come to pass and noah believed that so when noah believed what god was going to say then he put his faith in action and he started building a boat he started building the ark right that's right but you know when when you have faith and faith produces works then the other part of that is when you have works is the word where diligence comes in and when so when you look at you know we can have works but you know we have to follow god all the way we have to follow god the way that he would lead us hebrews 11 6 says but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so he says diligently seek him so there's a way you know when noah was building the ark you know he didn't take his own idea on how to build it you know he doesn't say hey god told me to build an ark i'm gonna build a heart god gave him the exact measurements on how to build the ark he gave him the wood told him what kind of wood to use to build the ark he told him how to pitch it within and without how many levels to put in how many doors to put in how many windows to put in every aspect of the ark was built to god's design it wasn't noah's design and so when we look at the word diligence that's how god wants us to believe not just to believe that he is he is he is whatever you have need of he is the i am the ever-present but whatever you have need of that's what he is but he says he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and so we put all things aside to follow him in the way that god would lead us as as the there's our term looking you look and see what diligence means you know we hold on careful determination working carefully with a lot of effort now later on i want to i want to look at some things because if we if we look to see how god wants us to be diligent and understand what god wants us to do and here in ii peter chapter 1 and peter's speaking of you know the stature of a perfect man and he says as according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby our giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and he said and besides this giving all diligence so we see that god has given us his this divine power he's given us his nature he's given us these exceeding great promises and then he says besides this he says giving all diligence so there's something that has to be done beyond this he says besides giving this giving all diligence so how do we or to pursue these things he says then add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge into knowledge temperance and it tempers patience and the patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity he said for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he is purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall so when god calls us into when you receive the new birth as brother brown said you know as speaking of the the pentecostals you know they thought well you know i've reached the i've reached the pinnacle this is it they said let you know you just got started and you brother rebuked the pentecostals because he said y'all cabbage down on this part and not realizing there was something greater to come and so you should continue on and understanding paul's speaking about receiving these this divine promise this divine nature that we receive from god and he says besides this so we have received the spirit of god we have received the spirit of adoption but after you receive this he said but besides this he said give all diligence to to press forward with everything to make sure that we have these things to add to our faith continue on continue on press forward and you know many times when i was i was thinking of of this quote where brother branham says in be certain of god and you know when when you look at these things when comparing this to um other comparing this to um other words i was thinking of the word perseverance but uh when you when you hear brother branham speaking of uh when you look at things in your life and you wonder why things are happening the way they are brother brown says you know when we have confessed our sins and met every requirement that god requires we believed on god there's a certain their circumstances has to be met and it's according to his will and we've confessed our sins and we've made all the wrongs that we have did right done everything that we know how to do every requirement that god has made or asked we have met that requirement and yet he lays silent he just won't answer us i'm sure that i'm speaking to people's this morning that's come to that place i've been there so many times been there many times myself when i went went back and traced my life and turned over every stone and i find that i did something wrong i'd go confess it i said lord god i'll make it right and go do so then come back again and say now lord thou art god you'll answer me surely i've met every request that you've required me to do and every requirement i've met it and still he won't move seems to be silent that's when you've got to be sure that he is god don't be discouraged the only thing is that in your heart to be certain of god and so sometimes when when we looked at at the word diligence you know it's to look at everything in a in a careful way because one of the one of the definitions of looking at something being diligent is to stop and look at everything and search through things as brother i'm speaking here stop and overturn every stone go back through everything in your life and make sure everything is okay and so when you want to be diligent you want to look at every aspect of everything to go through everything not just to be moving forward here in in the this definition for perseverance it says continuing a course of action without regard to this discouragement opposition or previous failure it says persistent determination to adhere to a plan of direction insistence now brother brennam said in the message perseverance he said that you know it means to persist to set a goal to move forward consider persist means to continue firmly or obstinately an opinion or a course of action despite of difficulty opposition or failure so you persist in a way and many times we have things in our lives and we're facing something but many times if we don't go back just like brother and preach doors and doors if we go through things in our lives and we allow god to move in one aspect of our life but we don't open up the other things and and look and allow him those other access and stop and say lord is there's doors that i haven't allowed you to come into have i not opened these doors then we can't say that we've had all diligence there's a legal term called due diligence and and due diligence is is a aspect in the law where if you have a legal legal proceeding that takes place if you receive some kind of legal document you've got some it you have to give everybody so much time if uh to respond right if you get a judgment against you that you don't like you have so many days to appeal within everything has it has a legal you have to do your due diligence when you're searching the title on a on a home for a purchase they have to go back and and search so many years and check everything out everything has to be done and that's due diligence when foreclosures or different things they put notices in the paper they try to contact everybody that they can when things are taking place to contact you know relatives of different things you have to contact all different parties all those things is part of that due diligence you've got to do all those steps to cover all those aspects of what would be reasonable and it's the same thing with god you know if we don't allow him to have his full preeminence then we've not done our our due diligence and sometimes we wonder why god's not been pleased with things and why things happen brother braham says why haven't we had a revival well sometimes the reason we have it is because we're hindering god we hinder god in it and the way that god wants to move things that god wants to do and it's like have we taken that due diligence and taken that and said lord what would you have me do or take the time to sit down and pray and what's hindering me what is it that was is unpleasing to you you know sometimes sometimes we just get wrapped up in in life sometimes and just the everyday things of life and sometimes we just we don't take we don't take account of things and we have things like you know brother wade was up here the other other day and and you know he was talking about us being on time and getting here before service and and those things and you know sometimes we we just get in in a frame of mind and sometimes you know we'll say well we're just going through the motions or you know we're just rushing and doing different things and and when somebody says something like that it's like does that really sink into to us do we actually take that to heart or is that just something well brother wade's up here saying that but if it but if it was god speaking or do we just look at it as a man speaking because i take that as god speaking [Music] because i i see this church and you know brother graham said our unconfessed sin you know the things that we do just minor things we think we think it's not a it's not a big thing but it could be so moderate but you know that could cause this church to bitterly fail what brother brown said we could hinder the church and we just said well that's that's just a small no if it's in the word then we we need to take a more earnest heat as the scripture tells us to the things that we've heard we need to we need to hold on to these things right and when i was speaking here perseverance and diligence there's a couple of stories i wanna i wanna tell and one of them is brother brown tells it in the in the great coming revival and the outs outpouring of the holy ghost here brother i'm speaking of paul raider and he speaks of paul rayder and scroll down there or scroll up brothers you stop but anyway he says and he believed in god paul raider preaks divine healing he not only preached it but he practiced it so he went so he went unconscious he was talking about when brother paul was battling the fever he said when he had dreamed he was back in the woods as a logger as he used to be and cutting the timber and he said he cut a big log his boss sent him yeah his boss sent him okay his boss sent him up on the hill to cut a log and said he cut the log stuck his axe in the soft timber of the evergreen and he started to pick it up and he just couldn't pick it up it was too much for him said he said well why would my boss ask me to cut a log like this and couldn't pick it up he said if you get this symbol of what it meant god will never give you nothing this this gospel do what he give you grace to do it with that's right he will never promise thus in there but what he will fulfill it and said he tried to pick it up and he couldn't and he said he just wore himself out tugging at it and brother brown goes on and he says that's what's wrong with the church today denominations are tugging at it but they won't let god he said god let men run their limit right now god's letting men have this world let them prove to themselves that they can't run this world god with his mighty hand shows the world cannot stand that's right god rules the world he will rule it through christ jesus but now man wanted to rule and you see what kept what a chaos it's got into now we'll skip down just a little bit there and brother brown continues to talk about brother paul and he says paul said that he tugged at it till he just got tired he just didn't know what to do sat down beside of that tree and started crying he said oh i can't even pick it up i've lost my strength said he heard his voice speak partly he said he heard his boss's voice speak with a kind voice and said paul said what are you struggling at anyhow said why don't you just throw it over there in the water that water runs right on down around the camp said he looked up and his boss was the lord jesus said he just took that old log and pushed it over in the water jumped the straddle of them and went to splash the water riding it down the river hollering i'm riding on it i'm riding on it i'm riding on it instead he was coming riding into the camp screaming with all his voice i'm writing and when he came to himself he was standing right out in the middle of the floor with his hands up in the air screaming i'm riding on it i'm right it's god's promise and he was healed right there in the room and the fever is lifting so you know there was brother paul he was holding on and he kept trying to wrestle that log and that's persevering you know he's over there persevering he's wrestling that log trying to get that log to move but you know when he stopped and he thought and he's i can't do this that's when the lord was able to speak to him and said paul why don't you roll it into the water see if we we can persevere and have persistence and and push things and and we just stay in the same channel and just keep on going right but god doesn't want us just to be perseverant all the time god wants us to be diligent and stop and think well lord how would i how would you want me to do this and then when you come to that point then the lord was able to tell paul roll that log into the water and you can ride it there's another way to go and he said i'm riding on it see when he when he was battling that fever and he was working and and doing all that and we'll have the musicians come on i'll be doing in a minute but when he saw all that taking place and he was wrestling with that thing when he got to the point where he could just roll it over onto god when he cast his cares upon him then the lord could heal him and i was thinking about the there in the in john chapter 5 where there was a laying man laying beside the at the pool of bethesda and he laid there 38 years he had that infirmary infirmity but you know what he never gave up every single time the angel troubled the waters he was making his way to the water he was persistent he was perseverant to make that water but you know what jesus saw the faith that the man had and he said will thou be made whole he said lord i keep trying but you know what god told him take up your bed and he was able to take up his bed and walk not just be perseverant but let us all be diligent in what god has called us to do amen god bless you this morning [Applause]
