[2:02] God we're still gonna be on the calling
[2:06] it you know a title but we'll still be
[2:09] talking about the one God in the
[2:13] revealing of Almighty God because to me
[2:15] that's the entire Bible as in all things

[3:32] father we thank you for tonight you're
[3:35] loving your grace Lord and we thank you
[3:37] for all things and we just ask you
[3:40] Lord that you would call among us
[3:41] tonight that we could or just sit down
[3:44] for a little bit in the middle of the
[3:46] week and listen to you as you would
[3:49] meditate into our hearts and our
[3:51] thoughts and then our Lord that you
[3:53] would be the God of each one of our
[3:55] lives forgive our sins thank you for
[3:58] being with sister Trudy bringing her
[4:00] through that Lord and all making
[4:01] everything well and we prayed that you
[4:03] would give our strength and in the body
[4:05] and everything will be fine we love you
[4:08] and we thank you forgive us Lord for the
[4:10] many failures of our life cause we know
[4:12] we do failure but we want to stand
[4:14] completing you have your way in Jesus
[4:17] name Jonah - then Jonah prayed unto the
[4:26] Lord his God out of the fish's belly now
[4:29] look see where that now and said I cried
[4:32] by reason of mine affliction unto the
[4:36] Lord and he heard me out of the belly of
[4:41] Hell cried I and thou hurt us my voice
[4:45] in other words that means out of the
[4:47] deep it's not hail like as we talk about
[4:50] it because the word hail can be
[4:52] translated show Gahanna Hades it can
[4:55] mean the grave it can mean this that can
[4:58] be it was just like to him expressing
[5:01] how bad a situation that existed in were
[5:06] he with that alright far that hurt us
[5:09] excuse me for that hadn't cast me into
[5:12] the deep in the midst of the sea and the
[5:15] floods compassed me about all thy
[5:18] billows and thy ways passed over me
[5:21] he's just describing his journey and
[5:23] what happened and he was cast overboard
[5:26] by the men and the great fish swallowed
[5:28] him up you know and he's coming through
[5:30] and going down into the little the fish
[5:33] as it's eating in things and taking him
[5:37] to the depths of the ocean or to the
[5:39] mountains as you say in a second then I
[5:41] said I am cast out of thy side no I'd be
[5:45] pretty pretty bad to be down as low as
[5:47] you can go in the earth in the belly of
[5:51] a oil and be pretty easily to be
[5:54] able to say I kind of believe Lord I'm
[5:56] out of your side I'm not in your
[5:58] fellowship right now and I need
[6:01] something to take you know take place
[6:04] for thou had us cast me into the deep
[6:07] into the midst of the sea and the floods
[6:10] compassed me about all by billows in thy
[6:13] ways
[6:13] passed over me then I said I am cast out
[6:17] of that side yet I will look again
[6:20] toward thy holy temple now he was in the
[6:23] belly of the whale so he wouldn't wait
[6:25] he could look to the temple and like
[6:27] brother Adam said one day he just
[6:28] probably said okay I'm told and I'm
[6:31] supposed to look to the temple and I'm
[6:33] just gonna look that way and believe
[6:35] that that's the way you know and to do
[6:38] and do it and he says the waters
[6:40] compassed me about even to the soul the
[6:43] depth closed me round about the weeds
[6:46] were wrapped about my head I went down
[6:49] to the bottoms of the mountains see as
[6:51] far as you can go down there the
[6:52] mountains out in the ocean you know the
[6:55] earth with her bars was about me forever
[6:57] yet has now brought my life from
[7:01] corruption
[7:02] o Lord my God look at him sitting down
[7:06] in the whales belly and he's talking
[7:08] about that the Lord has brought up his
[7:11] life from corruption when my soul
[7:14] fainted within me I remembered the Lord
[7:17] and my prayer came in unto thee unto thy
[7:21] holy temple they that observed lying
[7:26] vanities forsake their own mercy in
[7:29] other words he calling everything around
[7:30] him a line vanity right that's the best
[7:34] way of saying it right but I will
[7:38] sacrifice unto thee now what now he's
[7:43] down there how's he gonna get would
[7:44] build him a fire and do all kind of no
[7:47] not exactly right but I will sacrifice
[7:50] unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving
[7:53] I will pay that I have vowed salvation
[7:59] is of the Lord now then what happened in
[8:04] the Lord spake unto the fish
[8:07] vomited out Jonah upon the dry land you
[8:10] may be seated the Lord had his blessing
[8:11] to the reading of the word now we've
[8:17] kind of finished up the thought at least
[8:20] enough I hope to work you can understand
[8:23] what I say you know not what it's what
[8:27] brother Dale said now it's I believe the
[8:30] Word of God tells us the truth and we
[8:34] talked about it there that the Bible
[8:36] says you know in talking about mankind
[8:40] that he's a triune being he's a body a
[8:43] spirit and soul and Paul said that you
[8:46] know that it be held blameless before
[8:49] the Lord
[8:49] it takes that to make a man you're not
[8:52] complete without your body you wouldn't
[8:54] be complete you wouldn't be complete
[8:56] without having a spirit living within
[8:59] you you wouldn't be complete if you
[9:01] didn't have a soul so then the old
[9:03] sayings of a lot of the denominations is
[9:07] saying man didn't have a soul until the
[9:09] law came into being you know that would
[9:12] be totally out and I'm I'm gonna say it
[9:15] this way to her that you can think about
[9:18] it you say I never heard anybody talking
[9:23] anything about the soul didn't exist can
[9:27] I ask you a question have you ever heard
[9:31] the word soulless have you ever heard
[9:36] the word soulish okay that's exactly
[9:41] what the teaching was that man didn't
[9:44] have a soul until the law came and
[9:49] brought him to a position that he became
[9:52] a soulish one who would be an answers
[9:58] from a conscience part of him and it
[10:02] would make him a soulish well if mankind
[10:04] could believe that before what do they
[10:06] believe now all right but then we talked
[10:08] about that it's the truth of seeing the
[10:11] the Word of God as it was brought to us
[10:14] and has been brought to us in the last
[10:15] days of talking about that that triune
[10:18] being is a
[10:20] human being and he's his body he spirit
[10:25] and he so it takes that to make him
[10:27] alright
[10:28] it took that to make Almighty God in
[10:30] human flesh that body was a creation
[10:34] Hebrews 10 5 a body has now prepared me
[10:37] alright that spirit the prophet said was
[10:40] the spirit in sunder town and divers
[10:42] manners in spite through the prophets or
[10:45] by the prophets really it's in the
[10:47] prophets is the correct way and then to
[10:51] say that that soul was a very soul of
[10:53] God
[10:54] because this is very nature it's very
[10:56] makeup and I asked you you know a few
[10:59] times are could you see you could follow
[11:02] the body throughout the Bible you could
[11:05] follow maybe the Spirit of God
[11:06] throughout the the word but could you
[11:09] see the soul there as it was back during
[11:12] that Old Testament trying to be
[11:14] displayed what was it that turned David
[11:18] from being killed kept all those others
[11:20] what was it in the fiery furnace our
[11:23] down with the three Hebrew children and
[11:25] all like that it came into being the
[11:28] very soul of Almighty God to manifest
[11:31] himself among us alright
[11:33] then bringing that into the truth that
[11:36] we understand an or need ones at the end
[11:39] time by the truth that was brought to us
[11:41] and it's giving you a little bit then
[11:43] we're gonna drop this but I'm trying to
[11:47] get you to see the situation and then
[11:49] we'll start in Genesis and come on up
[11:53] with a little point on salvation alright
[11:56] and because I want to cover this
[12:00] salvation for the Old Testament
[12:01] salvation in the new he said no it's all
[12:04] the same there's a little bit of
[12:06] difference there now we've got to hold
[12:07] that point you know alright and if you
[12:10] if you listen it will help to understand
[12:13] were wrapped all right but we found that
[12:16] the prophet in his early ministry would
[12:18] use body soul as the second rim spirit
[12:23] as the center realm but then when he
[12:25] came on into the 65s in the opening of
[12:28] the word then from then on he taught it
[12:30] body spirit second rim soul the senator
[12:34] we're all the way through from the very
[12:37] beginning of the 4647 and all all the
[12:42] way through he always told that man had
[12:46] five senses to the body
[12:49] whatever he called a second rim there
[12:52] was five cents this memory reason
[12:54] conscious you know it see taste feel
[12:56] smelling here for the body its memory
[12:58] reason conscious etc for the second
[13:00] realm of mankind no because you don't
[13:04] reason with your body see you've got a
[13:08] spirit that's the difference and in
[13:10] bringing us to where we are and
[13:11] especially to the soul of mankind but he
[13:13] always gave the third rim of mankind he
[13:17] always gave that free will are you know
[13:21] free moral agency the right to accept or
[13:24] reject and see then that way he says now
[13:28] we can understand Matthew 24:24
[13:33] they said in the last days they would be
[13:36] false Christ's people that would be
[13:40] anointed upon their spirit you see where
[13:45] you would would have you trouble trying
[13:47] to take your early ministry and anoint
[13:49] on your soul and do this that in the
[13:50] other it won't line up because the Bible
[13:53] never tells you you get a new soul but
[13:56] that's the way the people of the message
[13:57] touted the old two souls and all the
[14:01] exchange of the souls and everything
[14:03] let's see it can't be all right but if
[14:07] you can get the anointing on a man's
[14:08] spirit then he can be as dark as can be
[14:11] within his soul or inner being and still
[14:17] lost all right now because that puts him
[14:21] to be in that basis and I love it the
[14:24] way the Prophet said it he said God gave
[14:28] man a free moral agency and he said he
[14:33] made him like him you remember that
[14:36] quote made him like him made him with a
[14:39] choice made him the war he could accept
[14:43] or reject and by doing that then he
[14:47] would new he would go
[14:48] after the wrong thing and turnout and
[14:52] all mankind in would be lost the
[14:57] Scriptures will be right about morning
[14:58] sin che could say with an iniquity I
[15:01] know that's not scriptures totally
[15:03] together those two are but the other one
[15:05] that we're always quote you know and the
[15:07] Prophet who quoted morning sincerity
[15:08] nicholas fasting mothers wounds like
[15:10] it's going over in the in the song
[15:12] that's just a little okay now but
[15:16] getting the point of what we're talking
[15:17] about we talked about adam and eve in
[15:20] their situation how perfectly they were
[15:24] created there was no imperfection in eve
[15:29] to be able to blame anything upon
[15:33] something or some way that god made her
[15:37] different were that he could condemn her
[15:42] what if he made her different
[15:43] he can't condemn her and I'm complying
[15:47] i'm blood i've always been that way if
[15:50] he made her differ then he's responsible
[15:52] what he made no he made her with free
[15:56] free will a choice to make
[15:58] she made the choice and then she went
[16:01] after the rest of it alright now we've
[16:05] spent a lot of time talking about Adam
[16:07] and Eve okay now let's talk about
[16:10] mankind because God breathed into the
[16:15] nostrils he created Adam from a lump of
[16:17] clay and brought him up he was standing
[16:20] there he breathed into his nostrils and
[16:23] he became a living soul right according
[16:25] to the scripture all right then he was
[16:29] lonely because Eve was still in
[16:32] theophany still not in the right place
[16:35] so what did he do he didn't reach down
[16:39] and get another piece of clay and dirt
[16:41] and make he took a rib from Adam and
[16:45] Adam said now this literally is bone of
[16:48] my bone and flesh of my flesh since
[16:51] she'll be called woman woman means a man
[16:57] now has
[17:00] something that he can produce himself
[17:03] from you just think about what the word
[17:06] woman means what was Eve given to Adam
[17:10] for to reproduce Adam right now we're
[17:16] going we know when we talk about the the
[17:18] spoken word is to be what would bring in
[17:21] that's fine it'll make no difference
[17:22] we've been through all that okay you get
[17:26] tied up in that and you don't listen to
[17:27] what's being said Adam and Eve were
[17:31] created perfect and right the mankind
[17:35] wasn't created that way
[17:38] mankind Ian came because of the fallen
[17:42] condition so no matter who the player
[17:44] first baby coming from Eve no matter who
[17:51] it would be they'd be wrong let's see
[17:56] the words I like things like this I know
[17:59] you don't do that away but I have a way
[18:02] of just anchoring something down and
[18:04] saying okay now you dig around that
[18:08] stake oh you won't - you're gonna be
[18:10] here for a while
[18:11] Nicole see when you lay it down right
[18:14] then they can't argue with you about it
[18:16] all right
[18:18] so Adam and Eve was created perfect the
[18:24] wind scene entered the picture it
[18:26] polluted the wound of Eve because first
[18:29] was what what was the last thing we were
[18:32] talking about Eve mind or spirit her
[18:38] reasoning factors was polluted by the
[18:41] devil talking through the Beast
[18:43] and then the Act took place that's where
[18:46] the people of the message you know no
[18:48] wonder that mankind don't believe it you
[18:51] know the serpent seed is one of the
[18:52] major arguments of organized religion
[18:58] against us when no wonder all they know
[19:04] he didn't eat an apple she had sex acts
[19:08] with a beast
[19:11] it's all about us all the people but
[19:18] that was not the original sin but that
[19:21] tax was not the original sin I don't
[19:25] care if he's eaten apples
[19:27] he wasn't original sin the original sin
[19:30] was when Eve disbelieved God's Word and
[19:33] he told her not to eat of that tree he
[19:39] put to her spiritual being it clogged up
[19:44] all of those flus and everything and
[19:48] when they come out of it
[19:50] what could come from the wound of Eve no
[19:57] eternal life can come from the wound of
[19:58] Eve come on
[20:01] don't blow me away he said but what
[20:03] about Jesus what about it no connection
[20:10] to mama other than a naval core no
[20:16] connection other than the naval core
[20:19] don't try to blame it on this out of the
[20:21] other so just get the point
[20:23] he was polluted in her mind and then she
[20:28] went forth and done an original their
[20:30] act or the thing that took place all
[20:32] right
[20:33] see that way you can say the original
[20:36] sin was unbelief walk right over here
[20:42] I've invited you to do it why don't you
[20:45] do some of these things really deco do
[20:47] it sometimes I can get into it won't you
[20:49] find you a good Baptist and ask him what
[20:52] was original sin if he's anything
[20:56] talking word at all he'll tell you it's
[20:59] unbelief oh they'll argue the out for
[21:05] the situation but he'll tell you the
[21:07] original is unbelief why because
[21:10] everybody knows that's what it was
[21:13] except the people this master said the
[21:19] people of the message don't know what
[21:21] the bad does know about it and boy that
[21:23] hurts don't it
[21:26] and like feet have been able to talk to
[21:28] my mother and let her tell you about
[21:31] that my daddy told her what happened in
[21:35] the garden and he never heard of william
[21:40] branham there any no record really the
[21:43] ever even went to church as far as I
[21:45] know I don't know but he told her what
[21:49] happened a lot of people don't do that
[21:52] knew what happened physically but they
[21:55] didn't know what happened spiritually so
[21:58] we go we're trying to lay it out with
[21:59] Paul and what Paul was saying that Satan
[22:03] through his subtilty would be able to
[22:06] see the to real true church just like he
[22:10] did even the garden but their brother
[22:15] Dale we can't be deceived no you already
[22:18] are well you arguing about it you say
[22:25] yeah but but you just don't believe it
[22:26] right I may not but I believe that much
[22:28] I know the scripture we can't be
[22:31] deceived now we can't be deceived to the
[22:33] point of being lost no Satan can't get
[22:40] us far enough to make us lost if we're
[22:43] born again but he can sure attacked all
[22:47] of these senses about us and work on
[22:51] that okay now so you see then it put
[22:57] everybody now watch what I'm getting at
[23:02] if it was the fact that Abel was so
[23:06] perfect as everybody wants to make a -
[23:08] lineage thing I'm getting this point out
[23:11] of the way then we're going the people
[23:13] of the message got a tool in each part
[23:15] they got a lineage it comes down from
[23:17] Adam and if you come from Adam you can
[23:19] be saved if you come from the beast you
[23:23] can't be excited now show me that in the
[23:26] Bible show me that in the prophets
[23:28] message show me that in anywhere come on
[23:34] we proved a point like
[23:37] the people say oh you look at him you
[23:39] look at him big old giant ballplayers
[23:41] now especially them black ones you know
[23:43] big old John one day they throw in that
[23:45] climbing this I probably said well that
[23:47] would have ended it the flood see wait
[23:53] we don't we don't read enough to know
[23:56] that caused it to flood all you had was
[23:59] ham Shem and Japheth and there was you
[24:04] know but now let's start with one point
[24:09] what do you think about mmm
[24:14] salvation the point let me make my point
[24:16] in my statement from this do you believe
[24:23] that because of the fall in the garden
[24:30] that Abel was just as polluted as Cain
[24:38] then we're not talking about big size
[24:42] want them bigger and the other one
[24:44] we're not talking about strong genetic
[24:46] lines of anything you know to come out
[24:49] we're not talking about the beast on one
[24:52] side Adam on the other and well
[24:55] naturally probably Abel would have been
[24:59] a small like God compared to Cain
[25:03] problem once that wound spiritually was
[25:13] polluted it messed up the mind of all
[25:16] mankind and nobody could be brought into
[25:19] the world with eternal life you'd have
[25:24] to come to Jesus Christ right so Abel
[25:29] was just as polluted you've no luck they
[25:33] don't believe you was well then why did
[25:35] able offer a sacrifice case closed
[25:42] drove the stake you dig all day now try
[25:45] big why
[25:48] you're able have to offer a sacrifice he
[25:53] said you just to I know it that's what I
[25:56] am but I'm playing in Blunt and you tell
[26:00] me the difference once the wound is
[26:05] polluted anything that come from the
[26:07] wound was polluted come on
[26:13] what was the curse on you saw a resin
[26:18] things placed upon the woman okay come
[26:22] on but there was no difference in Cain
[26:25] and Abel both of them needed a savior
[26:32] may I ask you a point we'll get to in a
[26:35] minute how did Cain and Abel know that
[26:40] they needed to make an offering
[26:42] they were probably we're just given a
[26:45] number of age we don't worry about it
[26:47] they might have been 20 years of age I
[26:49] could argue the point we had the other
[26:51] day you know and make it real good
[26:53] couldn't because you just go in Genesis
[26:55] and read the accounts and most of them
[26:57] was 150 years old for to have any
[26:59] children read your Bible and let's just
[27:03] kill Cain and Abel 20 25 28 both of them
[27:11] knew they needed to make a sacrifice how
[27:16] do they know that
[27:22] there's no writing in the word that told
[27:25] them they had to do it no riding in the
[27:29] word now you go in a minute we're gonna
[27:32] flop back and you're going to see it was
[27:34] dead center in the middle of the word
[27:36] they knew they had to make an offering
[27:40] and God had said it now listen when we
[27:43] quote brother on him that when he says
[27:50] salvation is based upon the Word of God
[27:57] now don't jump over I know where he says
[28:00] this under the blood tell me where you
[28:04] got to talk to Al for the blood then
[28:10] when we get down to talking about it
[28:12] being the Word of God there's a whole
[28:15] lot more to the Word of God in this
[28:18] Bible that I'm holding this is just a
[28:23] part record of things and it was not
[28:29] written back there so there was no
[28:33] written law telling cain and abel they
[28:35] had to make a right a sacrifice okay
[28:43] maybe we need to think about this as I
[28:48] said we're trying to make a series part
[28:50] that we'll run into it eventually that
[28:54] there's a little difference in the Old
[28:56] Testament the New Testament and you'll
[29:01] find out Lord willing Sunday maybe why
[29:05] I'm stating it like I do
[29:07] I'm very particular in stating salvation
[29:18] not using the word Redemption
[29:25] just using the word salvation so let's
[29:28] start from the very beginning that's the
[29:30] way I do you know that when I start
[29:32] something I started this the shallows I
[29:35] started the most you know point I can
[29:38] get to the least things start with and
[29:40] come up in everybody just so deep deep
[29:45] in what manse in pants and put everybody
[29:53] didn't see him nobody born in any way
[29:58] could have anything that would make any
[30:02] point to save them by and you won't say
[30:06] where this men in ng Jesus didn't need
[30:08] saving so just don't go that far all
[30:10] right let's stop it right to her
[30:12] he didn't need saving he was the Savior
[30:21] what you don't want
[30:24] he's a lot of things he done under the
[30:28] word Mary had to do the same offering
[30:33] for Jesus in the eight days in a
[30:38] circumcision right and she did for the
[30:43] rest of them right I still go too far
[30:48] let's just coast along a little his Paul
[30:53] said descending for Tommy bar with me in
[30:56] my folly you know to the foolishness of
[30:59] preaching try to save the Lost
[31:02] so there's bear with me in the way that
[31:04] I try to bring things all right
[31:06] you say well why did you say this what
[31:08] why didn't you say it I said I don't I
[31:10] don't mean that wrong I made it truthful
[31:14] we look truly Jonah said it in the
[31:19] correct order when Jonah said salvation
[31:26] is of the Lord now watch him he didn't
[31:34] say at that point Redemption
[31:38] he's of the Lord he said salvation all
[31:45] right now so are we settled where we're
[31:48] at we've come up to the point that we've
[31:51] dropped pies to Adam and Eve we're into
[31:54] the whole human race that is lost and
[31:56] needing a Savior don't matter who you
[32:01] are see why then I fight the people this
[32:05] message so much I'll come in the world
[32:07] with eternal life I've always just asked
[32:11] a simple question where was it at and
[32:15] what was it and how did you get it oh
[32:19] it's a seed it's a bit seeds no good
[32:25] without moisture dead as a doornail
[32:31] you know what I mean by the life is
[32:36] laying there but it can't be brought out
[32:37] all right now here's what we're going to
[32:41] be talking about talking about salvation
[32:48] these are the things to consider what is
[32:52] salvation
[32:55] you see we say I'm automatically well
[32:58] it's believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:59] we're over an Old Testament we just
[33:02] remember if the Old Testament is not
[33:05] laid down correctly there is no new the
[33:11] old what is it that was a statement
[33:12] which I'm idea that the old speaks of
[33:15] the new now so the things to consider
[33:23] what is salvation what does it consist
[33:28] off whether it be older New Testament
[33:33] where does it take place the salvation
[33:41] start its journey in you in your body in
[33:44] your spirit or in yourself
[33:49] what are the benefits of salvation and
[34:00] what will salvation provide for mankind
[34:05] remember we're in the Old Testament all
[34:08] right don't jump over and run everything
[34:10] in the new we're in the Old Testament
[34:12] read brother Louisa's awake hey you
[34:15] gonna preach not just coming windy
[34:16] brother Forney don't pray but the next
[34:18] wind in your schedule to pray okay all
[34:21] right you got it okay we got I mean a
[34:30] Tuesday you just make sure you get here
[34:33] on the right date okay yeah we'll try to
[34:38] be here all right
[34:41] but now think about it I love the way
[34:47] the Bible speaks of things and to me you
[34:53] say what you want to to me it says to
[34:57] what it means and means what it says and
[34:59] there's no way to improve on it we try
[35:04] to destroy it but there's no way to
[35:06] improve upon it if God had any other way
[35:10] of doing it then what he done did he
[35:14] done wrong he didn't do it all right so
[35:21] now we're gonna start out talking about
[35:22] what is salvation oh it's a new birth as
[35:26] a senior in the New Testament come back
[35:28] in the Old Testament where we got down
[35:30] we just come with Adam and Eve and we
[35:35] just walk through with that and bringing
[35:37] it and now we've come with Cain and Abel
[35:40] as to standing outside the garden and
[35:47] offering a sacrifice
[35:50] Gudrun said probably right at the gate
[35:52] is where they made their sacrifice
[35:55] called at that time they knew where the
[35:56] gate was ad you know but the angels were
[36:00] there to guard that and I love the way
[36:03] because I remember in the Baptist Church
[36:06] nobody said something about said have
[36:08] you ever thought about how many times it
[36:10] says way other says why wait a minute no
[36:12] wait wait how many times it says way w8y
[36:17] because it starts not off in Genesis
[36:20] they were put there to guard the way of
[36:23] the Tree of Life
[36:26] well not jump SiC 4000 years and here
[36:31] stands a man on earth and he said I am
[36:33] the way I'm the way back in the garden
[36:39] I'm the truth and I'm the life what a
[36:45] wonderful situation so we're over to the
[36:50] point now so we're starting off with a
[36:52] word because I know you wouldn't think
[36:57] this way um and I shouldn't even say it
[36:59] but see we use the word redemption and
[37:03] the redemption is not for everybody
[37:09] right now it's for everybody because
[37:14] guard ladies in their lap and they can
[37:16] receive it but you're not going to
[37:17] receive it but the word salvation is for
[37:22] everybody
[37:23] oh when I heard that prophet I thought
[37:27] how could a man in his mind consider
[37:30] that when he said he said they'll even
[37:34] be a gospel to the heathen in the
[37:37] Millennium you know what that means it
[37:40] either gonna be in the Millennium
[37:45] they're not born again kind of a warning
[37:48] anyone me either
[37:53] how do you need these quotes I'll be
[37:55] glad to get them to it and most of you
[37:59] all know my heart
[38:01] alright but now watch so Jonah he said
[38:11] salvation is of the Lord you
[38:15] denigrate or sermonette of a message
[38:20] describing the situation you were
[38:22] existing in how you was in the whale's
[38:27] belly and you was all around and
[38:29] everything was around you and slopping
[38:31] about and he was floating around in it
[38:33] and in the no whale or we called it the
[38:38] great fish was made and that's fine you
[38:41] know we see we'll argue over that and
[38:43] failed to get the whole point it doesn't
[38:45] matter to me whether it was whale or a
[38:47] fish either way it had to have him out
[38:49] big enough to swallowing
[38:50] right all right let's see we try to get
[38:54] all of that to going but he's laying it
[38:56] down and he's selling how a situation
[38:59] that exists then let me take it as this
[39:02] part okay
[39:04] when man failed from that situation in
[39:09] the garden a wonderful position if
[39:12] you'll read the ten verses I gave you
[39:16] and read them over and over and over
[39:19] you'll see that that's a description of
[39:23] all mankind who fail in the garden you
[39:30] know failed and how death would come why
[39:34] everything would be Jonah was in bad
[39:37] shape he was in terrible shape you know
[39:47] but so you take I love it this way you
[39:49] know I try to do that sometime
[39:52] I love random here being one message and
[39:56] he'll be describing Jonah and he'll be
[39:59] making it so bad until aslam ease but
[40:01] you know of the puke and Obama canned
[40:03] everything is around him and he's in all
[40:06] kind of things and slopping around in
[40:08] all of that that would be in the oils
[40:11] belly and right and then you listen to
[40:14] him in another sermon and he just almost
[40:16] brings it to a place that Jonah was just
[40:19] floating on top of all of that and these
[40:22] nostrils was close to the point he
[40:24] couldn't smell and he was just having a
[40:27] good time and he was just floating
[40:28] around and he had to our condition
[40:30] running and everything was working just
[40:32] right come on listen to the message he's
[40:40] describing sometimes what he's meaning
[40:42] by this sometimes what he's meaning on
[40:44] that okay I won't charge you man just
[40:47] let it go but he comes down and he's
[40:52] coming to the place he says I will
[40:56] sacrifice unto thee with the voice of my
[41:02] Thanksgiving then words let my words
[41:08] that my my speech Lord recognize what's
[41:14] taking place and I'll pay the vials at
[41:18] all
[41:22] salvation is over the Lord you know when
[41:26] he finished his message the whale just
[41:28] opened up his mouth and you'll hear
[41:31] brother branham one time saying he
[41:32] vomited him out on the shoulder you hear
[41:34] him the next time maybe saying he rolled
[41:36] his tongue out there and said no a Jonah
[41:39] just walked out of his mouth on the
[41:40] tongue come on read the message
[41:43] but listen to all of the things it's so
[41:46] wonderful to get everything place as he
[41:49] would try to place it in the situation
[41:51] okay now so what does that word
[41:56] salvation mean
[41:59] now remember you're in the Old Testament
[42:01] so don't even start thinking about the
[42:05] thing because hey I know the scripture
[42:08] two hours I got laying on my desk and
[42:10] says there is no salvation outside the
[42:12] name of the Lord Jesus Christ right into
[42:16] the blood of Jesus Christ I mean come on
[42:18] folks we know it but now Jesus Christ
[42:20] wasn't back there and the situation
[42:23] didn't exist back doc alright but let's
[42:27] look at something that's wonderful to
[42:29] think about
[42:32] go ahead brothers brothers yo and pull
[42:35] up number one that word there where it
[42:40] said salvation is of the Lord it's
[42:43] number 34 44 a thirty four four four
[42:50] and it means salvation
[42:54] it means deliver us it means well fire
[43:02] it means to prosperity means deliverance
[43:07] he wanted you to know it meant deliver
[43:10] cleanness Kofi it means salvation by God
[43:15] or means victory now that's the Old
[43:20] Testament definition of salvation so
[43:25] when you narrow it all down to the point
[43:29] of what Jonah is talking about he's
[43:32] talking about the deliverance from the
[43:35] whale's belly right cause as quick as he
[43:40] said salvation is of the Lord now he
[43:43] comes the word deliverance don't forget
[43:46] that well just in case you don't want to
[43:50] go too far where you can say though it
[43:52] changes in the New Testament this don't
[43:57] change too much let's let's go
[44:00] go ahead number two comes the New
[44:02] Testament word is 49 91 that's the word
[44:08] for salvation
[44:11] it means salvation it means the one be
[44:16] saved deliver it means health means
[44:23] saving he's talking about the one side
[44:26] it means deliverance purse what is that
[44:29] / servation preservation safety
[44:34] salvation deliverance from the
[44:37] molestation of enemies in an ethical
[44:40] sense and that's what's included as a
[44:41] sole safety of salvation of the Masai
[44:44] acceleration I get the point one combat
[44:49] the Old Testament is speaking of the
[44:52] word salvation as a deliverance or
[44:56] deliverance you remember o Moses when he
[45:05] was standing at the Red Sea he said
[45:10] stand still what and see the salvation
[45:13] of the Lord now he ain't talking about
[45:19] saving nobody right he's talking about
[45:23] delivers or persevering over the thing
[45:26] he's talking about getting across the
[45:30] Dead Sea so then it's not always to use
[45:34] the word salvation as - meaning like new
[45:39] birth and things like that it starts off
[45:43] with a low form of understanding of
[45:46] salvation and Jonah was the first one
[45:51] used in that form of salvation to the
[45:55] point of saying salvation is of the Lord
[45:57] the others could use salvation that can
[46:00] be used many times we'll get to him at
[46:02] the why if we have time but what I want
[46:07] you to think about all of that back
[46:12] there speaks of right that's the type
[46:18] we're in any time that's just the
[46:20] speaking of it we're in the fulfillment
[46:21] of it
[46:24] all right bringing it out to a point now
[46:29] so let's anchor our thoughts into
[46:34] something that will always be the same
[46:37] no matter whether it's the Old Testament
[46:40] or the New Testament
[46:43] let's bring salvation from a point that
[46:47] we can understand that no matter where
[46:51] it's old or new it has the same meaning
[46:53] to it right pretty good point of
[46:59] salvation right let's read it from the
[47:02] prophet and see what he says about
[47:04] salvation okay go ahead to number three
[47:09] God keeps his word
[47:13] 19:57 III he said having an earth pass
[47:19] away the more she'll never pass away
[47:22] those words were solemnly spoken by the
[47:24] Lord Jesus Christ our Savior my subject
[47:28] continuing tonight God keeps his word
[47:33] and it is my belief that the Bible is
[47:37] God's Word and that in the word okay
[47:43] what's you that in the word it gives you
[47:47] a key come on that in the words not
[47:50] another sentence that in the word
[47:52] salvation is based upon the teaching of
[47:56] this Bible okay
[48:02] salvation cannot be based upon any other
[48:05] thing but the Word of God order the Lord
[48:09] many things are good remedies but this
[48:15] is the core love that right God has so
[48:20] planned it that his word is himself okay
[48:28] now so whether it's Old Testament New
[48:32] Testament where are you gonna put it
[48:33] don't matter just remember
[48:37] salvation is based upon the Word of God
[48:44] this is not based on what you think or
[48:47] what I think hold on a minute now don't
[48:53] run off so far with your thoughts and
[48:55] selves based on the blood
[48:58] give me the scripture fart I'll give you
[49:06] the scripture where the Word of God
[49:07] comes into being there because that's
[49:10] what we're doing
[49:12] listen salvation is based no matter
[49:16] where you're at old or new upon the Word
[49:22] of God now listen to a man describe
[49:26] salvation
[49:30] let's read go ahead to number four which
[49:34] is that was paragraph at our e3 from the
[49:38] message God keeps his word this is e for
[49:40] true about ten again so it's the
[49:45] continuing the thought now we cannot
[49:49] base salvation upon prayer as good as it
[50:00] may be we cannot base salvation on
[50:05] prayer now he's not telling you not to
[50:10] pray okay he'll tell you what he talking
[50:15] about the Muhammadans meters praying
[50:17] they prayed three times a day or
[50:20] something like I said the other day they
[50:23] go up to Washington DC they go right out
[50:25] in the middle of the street block the
[50:26] whole thing and pray they don't arrest
[50:29] them but you try you go parts of
[50:33] Christian get down to it and see if
[50:35] anyone arrests you okay they must have
[50:40] more power and we do okay now he
[50:45] describes it as good as it may be he's
[50:48] not saying not to pray
[50:50] don't misunderstand get your silly
[50:54] imaginations and members are not cause
[50:57] look if that be so the Muhammadans are
[51:00] saved we were over in Israel and all at
[51:08] once right in the middle of the day boom
[51:13] and my lord you can't even hardly hear
[51:16] yourself think and they start praying
[51:20] all over Israel on the big microphone
[51:23] and they called him Allah you know who
[51:31] they are they are descendants of Abraham
[51:39] and they're calling me Mahalo Mahalo
[51:42] means God I would see that's what we do
[51:48] but they don't know who they pray to do
[51:50] you we used to pray to the second or
[51:54] third person of the Trinity now you want
[51:56] to argue the stakes drove right we used
[52:00] to talk about a Trinity did we know who
[52:03] we prayed to oh yeah I always know that
[52:06] I prayed to Jesus you pray to Him as a
[52:14] second person of the Trinity third
[52:17] person of the Trinity well no no I just
[52:21] prayed Oh glory the Muhammadans are
[52:26] saved if it's base don't pray the
[52:29] Buddha's are saved the heathens are
[52:33] saved so it cannot be based on prior Oh
[52:38] what's this one and neither can it be
[52:41] based upon experience
[52:44] it's your prophet the way he told it you
[52:47] can't be born again without an
[52:48] experience so now he's not against
[52:51] experience right he's gonna tell you the
[52:54] experience he's talking about read what
[52:57] he says salvation is not based upon
[53:01] experience because people can
[53:03] any kind of an experience no more
[53:08] habitants have experiences the Buddhists
[53:11] have an experience and ever different
[53:16] religion has experiences you've heard
[53:18] run around and tell about the Indian he
[53:20] quote to the Indian thing you know and
[53:22] they would they would get down and they
[53:24] would pray and do rain dances and all
[53:27] like that and he said things happen
[53:32] really supernatural things and he said
[53:35] go into meetings of different thoughts
[53:37] and see a pencil stand up and ride and
[53:40] interpret so listen to what he's talking
[53:46] about the Muhammadans have experiences
[53:50] the Buddhists have experience every
[53:52] different religion has experience and
[53:54] neither can salvation be based upon
[53:56] fasting was against fasting no he done
[54:00] it so they should be based upon fasting
[54:05] pray and experience sensations our
[54:08] sincerity you gonna take your son out
[54:13] and offering like Abraham pretty serious
[54:18] bring it down to more modern today you
[54:20] gonna take your baby out and throw it to
[54:21] an alligator it sincerity many people
[54:29] say well it doesn't make any difference
[54:32] just what I believe as long as I am
[54:38] sincere in what I believe now what was
[54:46] the thought that we started this home
[54:48] when he's saying that salvation is based
[54:52] upon the Word of God and not on anything
[54:55] else now these are the else's that we
[54:59] think it's based on it may not be good
[55:01] language but you know what I'm saying or
[55:03] not well if that be so if it's based on
[55:09] sincerity if it's based on what you
[55:12] believe
[55:15] and come on you can't do whatever you
[55:17] believe in don't get messed up with it
[55:19] come to me and say you don't believe you
[55:23] sound like you don't talk about your
[55:29] prophet it is describing what we should
[55:32] believe and what we should not believe
[55:35] okay well if that be so the Muhammadans
[55:39] will say the Buddha's are say and all
[55:41] the rest of them the heathen is saved
[55:42] when I say that they can outshine us any
[55:46] day like I always say it we talked about
[55:56] we got the truth and the devil's mad at
[55:59] us I remember a pope that got shot just
[56:07] a few years ago for what he believed you
[56:13] ain't been shot yet have you don't play
[56:19] with me on words and philosophies I'm
[56:22] too old I'm sorry let's be serious they
[56:27] can outshine us any day when it comes to
[56:31] prayer fasting sensations and so forth
[56:33] they can outshine us and salvation does
[56:36] not pertain or is not based upon any
[56:41] other thing but the Word of God what
[56:45] God's got to say so so with all the
[56:54] things we might have might not be the
[56:56] word you get the point
[56:58] salvation cannot be based upon any
[57:00] church or any creed nothing but the Word
[57:04] of God
[57:05] British cards worked okay now let's just
[57:08] put it a little bit plainer it's not
[57:11] based on Lula okay
[57:15] church's Lula it's not based on Brenda
[57:18] mites
[57:26] sorry I'm playing you know it so what's
[57:30] the case but I lay down a good case that
[57:32] you're gonna be at that steak trying for
[57:35] a long time try to get up all right now
[57:39] I hope we've made this statement and
[57:44] compacted enough to be able to see what
[57:49] we're talking about that salvation is
[57:53] truly based upon the Bible in salvation
[58:00] of Buddha or Christianity you know
[58:02] shoutings you have praying's you have
[58:06] fastings any religion has some form of a
[58:11] rich world or whatever you want to call
[58:13] it of their church and their things
[58:17] right everybody does you know it's
[58:22] serious they're there they're
[58:24] worshipping I mean you want to be like
[58:27] one of these guys that strap these bombs
[58:29] on the side of him and he's so deceived
[58:33] and he walks out there and he blows his
[58:37] self up and he thinks that's gonna send
[58:41] him to heaven and he's gonna have 70
[58:43] virgins waiting on him when he gets that
[58:45] her I never did figure out how I got 70
[58:49] but that's alright don't think I
[58:51] couldn't figure out it what the women
[58:52] got you know but listen how sincere do
[59:01] you think those people are you want to
[59:03] try to give their life for what they
[59:10] believe they work like everything
[59:25] let's go a little bit further go now
[59:28] we've got a tie a knot in the state that
[59:31] we anchor that you won't just go haywire
[59:36] about what I'm saying and what your
[59:38] prophet is trying to bring go to number
[59:46] IC number six one of my place number
[59:50] five now so don't pull it up gonna go to
[59:53] number six
[59:57] what's then salvation coming down to all
[1:00:01] of the great things and all see
[1:00:05] salvation is not based upon what
[1:00:06] somebody someone else things okay
[1:00:20] is what you think of him
[1:00:30] can I say it without you getting all
[1:00:32] breathy puffed about it but it's not
[1:00:36] based to me upon what brother Branham
[1:00:39] says I know you didn't understand me the
[1:00:44] other day when I made that statement no
[1:00:47] or I might coming and join you later on
[1:00:49] that's funny I know you you don't listen
[1:00:53] to what I'm saying I told you my
[1:00:57] resurrection was not based upon whether
[1:00:59] brother Branham raised well let that go
[1:01:02] for that my resurrection is not based on
[1:01:04] whether Jesus raised two thousand years
[1:01:07] ago my resurrection is the resurrection
[1:01:11] that is with inside of me right now
[1:01:14] because that is all that's going to save
[1:01:16] me or raise me the believing of the
[1:01:19] others wonderful which you don't follow
[1:01:23] me there you think I'm throwing off on
[1:01:25] something okay sorry it's not based my
[1:01:31] my salvation my children my wife she has
[1:01:35] to have her own experience my children
[1:01:37] my grandchildren my great-grandchildren
[1:01:39] they have to have their own experience
[1:01:44] your children not going in because of
[1:01:47] your experience well then wait a minute
[1:01:51] we've got our power to get go ahead the
[1:01:53] Prophet tells you that they're not say
[1:01:55] just cause of your children they say
[1:01:57] when you got the same face with them
[1:01:59] that they come with the same faith you
[1:02:01] have okay we stop that but look it's not
[1:02:10] based on what somebody else says
[1:02:17] it's the based upon what you say yeah we
[1:02:23] could go a long ways on this right
[1:02:25] because you know where we could head to
[1:02:27] if you say to this mountain not if I say
[1:02:35] look it's not based upon what somebody
[1:02:39] someone else thinks it's what you think
[1:02:42] of him
[1:02:43] divine healing isn't based on what the
[1:02:45] critics say or what your churches say
[1:02:47] it's based on what your perfect faith in
[1:02:50] the inspired Word of God so where is
[1:02:53] your salvation based about your
[1:02:56] salvation based on the same thing is the
[1:02:57] healing which would be based on what the
[1:03:00] critics have to say about it not the
[1:03:01] church it's based on your perfect faith
[1:03:04] in the inspired Word of God it's coming
[1:03:13] back to an individual of fire it's cause
[1:03:20] mom and dad egos that don't mean you're
[1:03:21] going you gotta have your own experience
[1:03:29] now let's get this and we'll drop back
[1:03:32] number seven but she serves we would see
[1:03:38] Jesus I believe that divine healing is
[1:03:41] based upon a faith just like salvation
[1:03:44] that we believe that he was wounded for
[1:03:46] our transgressions with His stripes we
[1:03:49] were healed you notice the Apostle Peter
[1:03:52] places it in the Pais tense now reads
[1:03:57] your prophet real careful we were healed
[1:04:01] he supplies tens just like salvation is
[1:04:06] a pice tense as the Bible say we were
[1:04:12] saved before the foundation of the world
[1:04:16] it's based on a pie stems based on what
[1:04:20] he done but it's based upon what we can
[1:04:24] bring it to ourselves as to think within
[1:04:29] our cell
[1:04:32] when Jesus died the calorie saved a
[1:04:34] whole world every human being every
[1:04:36] would be on earth the same question was
[1:04:38] settled once for all when Jesus died but
[1:04:41] it will never it'll never be a
[1:04:45] beneficiary you will never be a
[1:04:47] beneficiary of this policy until you
[1:04:50] accept it and there's nothing you can do
[1:04:54] to merit
[1:04:55] it's an unmerited thing that God has
[1:04:59] done for you and you just accept it by
[1:05:02] faith in the simplicity of faith God has
[1:05:06] made it listen so we could all reach it
[1:05:14] remember cos mister God reveals
[1:05:17] afterward idiot
[1:05:18] the bread run said it it's a revelation
[1:05:20] of Jesus Christ personally to you then
[1:05:22] he goes on to say what and how the
[1:05:24] Christ could be revealed to the most
[1:05:26] illiterate person we don't like that do
[1:05:29] it that's what he said so go ahead in
[1:05:33] the simplicity of faith God has made it
[1:05:36] so we could all reach it rich or poor
[1:05:38] illiterate or educated we can all accept
[1:05:41] it because it's through it's in the
[1:05:44] reach of all us just by childlike
[1:05:50] simplicity to believe that the finished
[1:05:53] work at Calvary included me how much
[1:05:58] simpler could it be than that to base
[1:06:03] everything upon your own simple faith my
[1:06:11] faith is based upon this idea that
[1:06:15] wouldn't what is explained it's got to
[1:06:20] be your own personal experience now
[1:06:30] Missy
[1:06:40] so we need to his limitation says
[1:06:44] quietly wait for the salvation of the
[1:06:49] Lord
[1:06:53] Moses standing there he said stand still
[1:06:56] and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:07:02] Micah says therefore where I will look
[1:07:05] unto the Lord I will wait for the God of
[1:07:08] my salvation my God will hear me I hope
[1:07:20] it's anchored to understand because this
[1:07:22] will be our anchor all the way through
[1:07:24] that no matter what you talking about
[1:07:27] salvation if it be as Moses stand still
[1:07:30] and see the salvation the deliverance
[1:07:32] that's why we're using the word
[1:07:33] salvation with the word deliverance in
[1:07:36] other scriptures you read your
[1:07:37] scriptures and pick up deliverance and
[1:07:39] see other things delivered from this and
[1:07:42] deliver the children of Israel was
[1:07:43] delivered out of Egypt you know the all
[1:07:45] of the things that happen deals with the
[1:07:48] word deliverance which can be dealing
[1:07:50] with the word salvation because it's
[1:07:55] based upon what a man can believe maybe
[1:08:03] one of these days you'll realize why the
[1:08:07] bible says abraham believed god and it
[1:08:16] was accounted unto him as the word
[1:08:22] salvation you just go away through the
[1:08:27] bible day after day of studying in
[1:08:31] thoughts but we've got another thought
[1:08:34] we've got a cover now
[1:08:41] I hope you listened to the start of what
[1:08:44] we say it to say that salvation and
[1:08:49] things like that is based upon the Bible
[1:08:51] now there was hundreds of years and
[1:08:53] thousands of years they had no Bible and
[1:08:59] then your prophets come into being and
[1:09:01] started speaking if you're coming from
[1:09:06] Genesis to Noah really only have Enoch
[1:09:13] and Noah it's two prophets others are
[1:09:20] not mentioned see that it's so strong
[1:09:24] and so held to that point until Jesus
[1:09:29] knew what he was gonna have to do when
[1:09:31] he died he was gonna have to go and
[1:09:35] preach to the spirits that were in
[1:09:38] prison
[1:09:39] listen in the long-suffering in the days
[1:09:42] of Noah Jesus never went to the Old
[1:09:45] Testament site and had to preach to him
[1:09:48] after the prophets began to develop the
[1:09:51] body but from Genesis to Noah you don't
[1:09:59] have all of those things you don't have
[1:10:03] no writings I know I'm read I can read
[1:10:08] it
[1:10:09] Jobe is the oldest written I know the
[1:10:12] part of the story it was written before
[1:10:16] gender systems I just get the point it's
[1:10:23] not necessarily stamped letters on a
[1:10:25] page to call it the Word of God Noah
[1:10:33] let's see well let's put him first cut
[1:10:37] he represents the carried over to
[1:10:40] foolish virgins but Noah's words was
[1:10:47] God's Word you agree
[1:10:50] what Noah said to the people was God's
[1:10:54] words speaking to the people in a man
[1:10:59] the prior to that time had already got
[1:11:03] so involved in the Word of God until he
[1:11:12] walked off the earth we had he built the
[1:11:17] pyramid what was the pyramid the Bible
[1:11:27] so we already got the Bible before it
[1:11:32] ever become letters or anything
[1:11:33] you got it written in the sky you got it
[1:11:37] written on the earth by the pyramids and
[1:11:39] then you had mankind to start bringing
[1:11:42] it so the words been here a long time
[1:11:51] what does that word declare and don't
[1:12:01] come over junk no in the new or anywhere
[1:12:03] don't even jump over to the law leave
[1:12:05] all that alone you stay with me we're at
[1:12:10] cuz come on if you know if I studied it
[1:12:14] I got it laying there there's no
[1:12:17] redemption in the law so don't even fool
[1:12:20] with it which they were salvation while
[1:12:24] the law was in existence there was grace
[1:12:34] because the prophets were grace so don't
[1:12:40] go too far just wait on me let's talk
[1:12:43] about it
[1:12:48] now let's get to that little point we
[1:12:50] were making wanna go how did Cain and
[1:12:55] Abel know they were made to make a
[1:13:02] sacrifice and why does it show as we do
[1:13:10] and talk about it of how dumb Cain was
[1:13:14] to go to the works of the flesh to try
[1:13:19] to make an atonement rent Cain went to
[1:13:25] the works of the flesh he was serving
[1:13:26] God he was worshipping God he was
[1:13:29] praying to God
[1:13:35] but how did Abel know he was to make an
[1:13:44] atonement we'll get to that in a minute
[1:13:47] how do you know but how did he know it
[1:13:50] was to be a blood atonement now remember
[1:13:58] I made my case laying it down salvation
[1:14:02] is based upon God's Word God's Word must
[1:14:05] declare why things are done not written
[1:14:13] out in pen and ink we declared to be
[1:14:16] God's Word and what happened I've had
[1:14:26] ministers argue this and I'm fixing to
[1:14:29] say what happened when sin entered the
[1:14:36] picture
[1:14:45] but random places it he'd had to find it
[1:14:51] he said when Adam and Eve was walking
[1:14:54] out of the garden
[1:14:55] slapping with bloody skins upon their
[1:15:00] bare legs said then God streamed out and
[1:15:06] said but I'll put enmity between thy
[1:15:11] seed and the seed of the woman when we
[1:15:16] don't handle seed source he talkin about
[1:15:18] Jesus Christ as the seed of the woman we
[1:15:21] know that right
[1:15:23] see the woman without it which is which
[1:15:25] is Christ without sex she never had him
[1:15:28] by sex she had him by creation okay I've
[1:15:38] preached on this to people and him life
[1:15:41] and make fun of you to think that God is
[1:15:45] real enough he could kill an animal and
[1:15:48] pull the skin off
[1:15:59] I didn't knock the book he says in
[1:16:04] Genesis what 3 and 21 under Adam also
[1:16:11] went to his wife did the Lord God make
[1:16:14] coats of skins and covered them do you
[1:16:23] realize the Adam and Eve was walking out
[1:16:29] of the garden carrying their atonement
[1:16:38] it was splattered all over what just
[1:16:42] relax all over Adam and Eve was a blood
[1:16:51] sacrifice now we've got the story right
[1:16:59] it is based upon the Word of God of
[1:17:02] salvation and the Word of God declared
[1:17:05] when he said I'll put enmity between thy
[1:17:07] seed and the seed of the woman declared
[1:17:09] the coming of the Messiah in God Himself
[1:17:13] strip the skins off of those animals and
[1:17:16] atoned for them Abel could look back and
[1:17:24] said mama what's wrong
[1:17:29] Cain keeps telling me about all this
[1:17:32] fruit and all that stuff I said I
[1:17:39] remember you told me the story then when
[1:17:43] you were walking out of the garden did
[1:17:46] God clothed you and Adam with blood that
[1:17:51] was the first atonement my blood
[1:17:56] salvation is based upon the blood the
[1:18:03] word declares where it's based
[1:18:11] you said well where's that work I'll put
[1:18:13] in my teens I see the woman God made
[1:18:16] coach the skin for them see I had to
[1:18:21] read what the prophet and the people
[1:18:23] still liked so let's read a few and I'll
[1:18:27] quit on it go ahead a number 12 now
[1:18:31] let's see yeah number two well we're
[1:18:35] getting away over okay do you went
[1:18:43] anywhere because there was one show
[1:18:44] thence when sins come and sinner man
[1:18:47] from the fellowship notice what God did
[1:18:49] to make man back to fellowship he
[1:18:52] introduced to the world the blood
[1:18:55] Redemption right he introduced to the
[1:19:01] world God did a blood Redemption we're
[1:19:09] win God killed animals and put their
[1:19:14] skin showing a blood Redemption and
[1:19:17] their God after being separated from his
[1:19:20] from his creatures
[1:19:22] God laid out the welcome mat back home
[1:19:26] by the shedding of the blood and that
[1:19:29] was then and has been and will always be
[1:19:36] God's provided preparation for
[1:19:39] fellowship with him is through the shed
[1:19:42] blood God pulled his skin see that's
[1:19:46] where I spent months preaching right how
[1:19:50] real God was well you say God do the
[1:19:54] people's isn't it Oh God is a spirit he
[1:19:58] just just be ready
[1:19:59] gonna run said he wouldn't like the wind
[1:20:01] and thought he said he was a real being
[1:20:05] but we don't look back dire as him being
[1:20:08] something we try to make him come down
[1:20:09] here but teller he was real back down
[1:20:15] more real and all this garbage can you
[1:20:17] could talk about it
[1:20:20] he was so really pull the skins off no
[1:20:23] he hired somebody else that's pretty
[1:20:28] good you know yeah he had one of the
[1:20:31] height men with the Angels less real he
[1:20:33] was I've never heard of an angel cuz
[1:20:36] triple skiing off with an animal no God
[1:20:42] did so continue on 13 which is
[1:20:46] fellowship okay God made one preparation
[1:20:52] for a man to be restored back to that
[1:20:54] fellowship
[1:20:55] Onoda nothing else we have tried we've
[1:20:59] offered to he offered to the human race
[1:21:01] blood was the way back to fellowship God
[1:21:04] killed some animals and took their skins
[1:21:06] she had the innocent blood of the animal
[1:21:08] and brought it to the brought the skin
[1:21:11] and wrapped Adam and Eve in it and
[1:21:13] fellowship with them again fellowship
[1:21:17] with them again after the shedding of
[1:21:19] the blood that is God's Way it was God's
[1:21:23] Way it will always be the right thing to
[1:21:26] fellowship through the blood
[1:21:28] reconciliation bring in the believer
[1:21:31] back into contact with his maker we've
[1:21:34] tried to educate people to it and they
[1:21:36] were work we tried to draw the
[1:21:38] nomination of barriers and say because
[1:21:40] you go to this church oh yeah outside
[1:21:44] see signs or anything outside this she
[1:21:47] had blood of the Lord Jesus Christ will
[1:21:49] never bring Chappelle Michelle back to
[1:21:51] the people you already spoke back there
[1:21:54] the shed blood but it was a shed blood
[1:21:57] of an animal now you can say what you
[1:22:01] want to the same quotes brother Branham
[1:22:06] said God killed the animal and took the
[1:22:12] skin how do you want this one there he
[1:22:14] said God killed his own son
[1:22:19] no man killed Jesus Christ don't get
[1:22:24] that in your mind that did you done it
[1:22:25] or there's no no man killed Jesus Christ
[1:22:28] he said I'll lay my life down he said I
[1:22:32] can take it
[1:22:34] come on let's see we don't want to
[1:22:36] believe God is real okay to go to number
[1:22:40] 14 we get through in a minute number 14
[1:22:46] is having conference yeah and then we
[1:22:51] find then when God found them standing
[1:22:54] behind the bush somewhere
[1:22:57] now there's another quote you won't
[1:22:58] discipline you know what he said he said
[1:23:01] Adam and Eve was back in the bush he's
[1:23:03] having church she was still trying to
[1:23:08] convince Adam she was right then we find
[1:23:16] when God found them standing behind the
[1:23:18] bush somewhere shivering in with the fig
[1:23:21] leaves aprons on them God luck always
[1:23:24] the word conferences they always try to
[1:23:27] go to Geneva sleeping they don't make
[1:23:28] places and then call the comforts I
[1:23:30] guess God when he found Adam and he hid
[1:23:34] behind a bush over there they couldn't
[1:23:36] come out they said we can't come out
[1:23:39] father we're naked and who told you you
[1:23:42] were naked and then they started with
[1:23:45] the past in the book and all of this I
[1:23:46] I'm one of the God looked around and he
[1:23:48] found a tree a certain place a place he
[1:23:55] thought would be beautiful and he got
[1:24:00] some skins and threw them back in the
[1:24:04] bushes and said cover yourself with this
[1:24:06] and come out before me and they had a
[1:24:11] conference they talked it over then God
[1:24:13] made a preparation for them I'll put
[1:24:16] enmity between that scene to see that
[1:24:18] one coming well I'm so glad there was an
[1:24:20] Eden cumference now let us go under not
[1:24:24] let us go under fig leaves and something
[1:24:27] we can show up together that God killed
[1:24:31] something to cover their sins and gave a
[1:24:33] promise that through the woman's seed
[1:24:36] would crush the surface he had for
[1:24:38] telling what he would do
[1:24:40] okay one more message of grace
[1:24:45] oh it was terrible that morning darkness
[1:24:50] hanging in the garden
[1:25:00] did your son go down what happened
[1:25:11] it was a terrible that morning darkness
[1:25:14] hanging in the garden I'll imagine fog
[1:25:20] of black sack cloth
[1:25:25] I'd imagine ever leaf never moved
[1:25:29] there was no wind stirring it was
[1:25:33] darkness and terrible because sin had
[1:25:37] blooded out then comes you hold down
[1:25:41] like a roar of thunder walking through
[1:25:44] the garden the crying had him or aren't
[1:25:46] now that's when I don't realize he was
[1:25:49] naked and it's sin before God he hid
[1:25:51] himself and tried to make himself a
[1:25:53] religion but it didn't work
[1:25:54] God kills her she took the skins and
[1:25:57] showed that something had to die to
[1:26:00] cover sin joining church will never
[1:26:03] cover sin no dried out confession will
[1:26:06] never cover scene it takes sour and
[1:26:07] repentance and the grace of God to cover
[1:26:09] sin or the blood of Jesus Christ the one
[1:26:12] that God killed at Calvary to cover see
[1:26:16] him what about it Church come on
[1:26:21] brothers what about it
[1:26:25] there is no salvation without the Bible
[1:26:30] the Bible declares the blood atonement
[1:26:36] and that would be the only way that God
[1:26:40] would ever fellowship with mankind was
[1:26:43] through the blood they had their
[1:26:47] deliverance and listen you're not paying
[1:26:52] close attention
[1:26:53] what's your prophet said when he said
[1:26:57] them games he turned around and that
[1:27:01] fellowship with him it was restored
[1:27:04] right there no he was mad he thought him
[1:27:10] a leader tell us it was restored
[1:27:17] they come my children you're gonna have
[1:27:21] trouble you're gonna have problems but
[1:27:25] you know what I love I love the day the
[1:27:32] Prophet said said look he said God
[1:27:37] didn't curse at him he said God didn't
[1:27:46] curse Eve he said God cursed to earth
[1:27:52] the beast in the Sun but he didn't curse
[1:27:55] Adam and Eve
[1:27:57] how could he curse them when they were
[1:28:03] standing with animal skin covered in
[1:28:09] blood are you listening
[1:28:14] how could he condemn them when they were
[1:28:18] standing there with the shed blood the
[1:28:21] atonement made
[1:28:23] that's why Cain and Abel they had to
[1:28:26] make an atonement they found that out
[1:28:28] Abel he said it had to be blood see
[1:28:31] because I'd born in my mama's blood from
[1:28:33] my daddy's blood it's gotta be blood did
[1:28:37] they offer that back Baron said the
[1:28:38] story's been told me that God killed
[1:28:41] those animals said I'm going to offer
[1:28:44] that blood you know what that was that
[1:28:50] was his salvation the blood atonement to
[1:28:57] Adam and Eve was their salvation their
[1:29:00] deliverance
[1:29:07] I'll tell you one thing that we are
[1:29:09] eventually going to in the message was
[1:29:14] the lifestyle that we asked what would
[1:29:19] your salvation bring to you it brought
[1:29:27] Adam and Eve you brought Abel you
[1:29:31] brought all of those just ones down
[1:29:33] through there a place called Paradise
[1:29:40] that they could die and not be
[1:29:44] annihilated I love it when it says over
[1:29:54] in the New Testament about the parable
[1:29:55] of the rich you learn you know the man
[1:29:59] said it was in the bosom of Abraham
[1:30:08] Buddhism means that there's not just a
[1:30:10] belly but it actually is a place or
[1:30:13] carrying mechanism not in front of you
[1:30:18] I thought we believed that we were the
[1:30:23] seed of Abraham by faith it provided for
[1:30:29] them provided for us what we got that's
[1:30:33] damn take on these themes start a little
[1:30:38] simple thought of salvation
[1:30:40] I come to the car well the deal is still
[1:30:51] on the road if I have a need you already
[1:31:01] saying that going down to the garden
[1:31:04] he gets back home soon or
[1:31:11] don't matter how good you do things it's
[1:31:15] from the heart
[1:31:20] remember now with me is faith in the
[1:31:24] blood
