[0:31] JJ about any country I can tell me a
[0:35] living ain't anybody I know or even a
[0:40] lot no I just got married and the
[0:45] ammonia now they're taking the rivers
[0:48] darkening treatments right now our data
[0:51] because you know yes oh all right so
[1:00] anyway now let's get started so there
[1:03] was no rampage so just keep everybody
[1:05] forever the we believe prayer yeah
[1:08] will be answered man prayer will be
[1:11] answered
[1:12] all right let's read now Matthew 24 more
[1:15] still on the fifth seal will probably
[1:17] finish it up day is today and go to
[1:18] system and then show many be offended
[1:20] and shall betray one another and shall
[1:22] hate one another and many false prophets
[1:24] shall arise and deceive many now this is
[1:27] coming toward remember this fifth seal
[1:31] happens after we're gone right half of
[1:36] that y'all killing in your Sedona people
[1:39] get in here going yeah over here
[1:48] all right now spell something like but
[1:53] remember this is telling a an event
[1:57] that's going to happen right this is
[2:01] going to happen under the fifth seal
[2:03] there's going to be now we know for a
[2:07] fact that the fish they will went into
[2:08] another dimension but when we're gone
[2:10] the fifth seal is going to be inactive
[2:15] it's going to be an action still it is
[2:17] not going to be dormant because it as
[2:19] people die and get persecuted they're
[2:21] going in under that fifth seal juke-r
[2:24] right right okay so so it's happening
[2:26] that one saying we're gone so what's
[2:28] going to happen is now what does the
[2:30] Bible doesn't cover when it talks about
[2:33] the 1260 days and the two witnesses
[2:36] remember they're true witnesses they're
[2:39] all true they're true that true they
[2:41] bring a message but the vital really
[2:43] never said anything about balls because
[2:45] you know one thing for sure
[2:47] if they're going to be drool in this
[2:49] they've got to be involved with room
[2:51] there's got to be false prophets shall
[2:54] rise in deceive many
[2:55] so just as in our anytime see this is a
[3:00] choosing time in our en time same thing
[3:02] happened both profits are rising up and
[3:05] deceive many now we see that happening
[3:09] in the message rains as far as people
[3:12] leaving the message right but what were
[3:14] so far away is is people sitting here
[3:17] under the message of the idle word they
[3:19] don't have come to church and they don't
[3:20] have studying it up to me that's a
[3:22] greater falling away cause you think
[3:24] you're just so you think you're sitting
[3:25] in a building and everything's fine
[3:27] and what happened you're not hearing
[3:29] from a fault trumpet in this pulpit
[3:31] pulpit you're here from a false prophet
[3:33] but you don't have any bourbon that
[3:34] false prophet and then you you even got
[3:40] true or false in your soul there's no
[3:41] able to clean there's no there's no gray
[3:44] area you either got it or you don't
[3:48] GZ got the new birth or you still got
[3:51] that over that makes
[3:52] you still got a demon inside of you
[3:55] sorry but doctors the way they look
[3:58] there's a way out okay there's a way out
[4:01] I'm signal goes look because the niccola
[4:03] t show abound the love of many shall wax
[4:06] cold now that love is not so it is not
[4:14] filial love that's not how I feel up to
[4:16] it
[4:17] that's listen in the Bible when you try
[4:21] to make this skin we can understand in
[4:23] the Bible figlio love was when Abraham
[4:28] and Sarah
[4:29] when Jacob married Rachel and yourselves
[4:33] in
[4:34] when this natural act that's fetal love
[4:36] agape love never was a love between a
[4:41] man and a woman no there's no way agape
[4:45] love is between you across if you do one
[4:48] and cross the math right
[4:50] amantha God that true of God with a
[4:52] filial love and see they put in program
[4:55] of what point he did he come from agape
[4:57] the figlio to what was and what happens
[5:00] is now you see all these men with men
[5:02] women women notice what's going on back
[5:04] foot it a perversion of the true that
[5:09] God loves with that not that's not
[5:12] that's not video love that's adopting
[5:15] love the love of many shall wax cold may
[5:21] still happen you birth in there
[5:22] something that's why I grow to else that
[5:25] we need a reliable I sort David okay we
[5:28] were getting a haircut
[5:29] I'll get my haircut do then jeans a
[5:32] badges and then two of the badges
[5:34] sitting there you know they would come
[5:35] out now whenever revival to bring a
[5:37] center then you don't
[5:41] but Jeannie's real versed in the biology
[5:44] of the Bible I said Jim I said you can't
[5:49] have a revival with a dead person you
[5:53] can have a resurrection with a dead
[5:55] person you can revive those that are
[5:59] alive right there never has been a
[6:05] revival for their people its revival
[6:09] there's a lot of people's right you got
[6:11] anybody you know you're right I think
[6:13] the problem is we got too many people we
[6:17] got too many people then they died
[6:19] enough to be resurrected to have a real
[6:24] out all right anyway now to staying here
[6:28] because the love of many shall wax cold
[6:30] but look but he that shall endure unto
[6:33] the end the same shall be saved right so
[6:37] that's that's to me that's talking to
[6:40] the vigil Jew typical dari enduring what
[6:43] what does the Bible tell them and their
[6:44] revelations it said wait what is it door
[6:48] main door means wait in door means the
[6:51] way wait until your fellow servants in
[6:53] other words always I was thinking
[6:54] yesterday you know God's Word is is
[6:59] limiting what I can do but it's the
[7:02] perfect plan of God because what we
[7:04] thought just come down here change
[7:05] running we go home why can't do that
[7:09] why couldn't you do that why can't he
[7:11] just now appear right here change our
[7:14] body will go on a rapture and he goes to
[7:16] the Jews and why does he go thing
[7:18] influency today everything has a plan in
[7:21] the purpose running God's plan the
[7:25] reason that the fall happened was to
[7:27] fully develop not God God already fully
[7:31] developed but in other words our love
[7:34] back for him
[7:36] okay I love back for him at the top they
[7:39] love not feel you look beat me although
[7:42] it's for your parents your wife your
[7:44] children whatever you want to say down
[7:47] here this is still your look this was
[7:49] filial while this imperial
[7:51] was created after the ball be Leola was
[7:57] created after the ball because of the
[7:59] fall God said okay Adam you leave are
[8:02] now going to procreate this way that's
[8:09] not the way I want it but you're going
[8:10] to procreate this way but it's going to
[8:13] be a type of us that help took the new
[8:16] birth and Mail of the crops and develop
[8:19] the childhood of almost all men comes
[8:21] before that that now I'm going to tell
[8:26] you why they thought can go to them go
[8:30] remember when Boaz redeemed Naomi
[8:36] remember he got rude but the full right
[8:39] of redemption was was to take the child
[8:42] that they had and give that child back
[8:44] to Naomi right which what that cops
[8:48] Christ the towel they only type was the
[8:52] old Jews the 144,000 we gotta give
[8:56] Christ Christ had to come to the Gentile
[8:58] we had to be born again first so that we
[9:02] can present that child back to the Naomi
[9:06] Jews so she can raise it you know
[9:12] hurry Tommy but he can't just be that's
[9:15] like that I made that point up I'm
[9:16] answering the question that I asked you
[9:18] why can't other screw down here every
[9:21] time the Bible will be broke all the
[9:23] time says is you've got you guys want to
[9:25] come to the Jews and then you take it
[9:28] again all right and then they have a
[9:31] child promise child and they take a
[9:33] child and give it to you but same way
[9:36] got it right so so that but see that was
[9:39] feel you love could they produce the
[9:42] child who you love Monday but you see
[9:45] the adopted love even then the Old
[9:46] Testament are you looking god I'd read
[9:49] it this morning we're brother Brown
[9:50] stood there without money walking out
[9:53] think it was
[9:53] darkest hour and you know there's ever
[9:56] been because when we're walking out he
[9:59] screams out he said I will play in other
[10:05] words I'm going to come out there I'm
[10:07] going to undo all this see that speak
[10:09] that's not Phil Yolo feeling a little
[10:13] I've always said to that when Adam to
[10:17] give back when Adam took when Adam found
[10:20] out what he did now he didn't have to
[10:23] have a sacral relation letter to say we
[10:26] know that right right there are no
[10:28] special anything that was redemption if
[10:31] they taught but it's not the real thing
[10:33] right but I'm telling you though if Adam
[10:36] had not had the Holy Ghost in his soul
[10:38] which idiot could remember garden-party
[10:40] turn like that he was the son of God
[10:43] that man had more control of the earth
[10:45] and we do with one man at the moment
[10:48] here what's it at the moment but that
[10:51] video had to turn into the topic of
[10:55] something inside of Adam forgave me
[11:00] acted with this you and I you're welcome
[11:04] to use I've had relations with an animal
[11:07] figlio love we kick you out the door and
[11:11] divorce or and you never touch her she
[11:12] would be defiled so what took over with
[11:15] a - why that Adam portrayed cry that's
[11:18] why God look down and said that's what
[11:20] I'm going to do because listen we're the
[11:24] we had relations with an animal or not
[11:27] we have have relations with the server
[11:29] that's our first relationship is with
[11:33] the table drunken is right in the car
[11:35] line is the deception so Christ is going
[11:39] to what we'll look through all that they
[11:40] clap dr. kopylov that's this thing right
[11:44] here I told you that man can produce
[11:47] reading man can produce it because we
[11:49] haven't got we appeal you look really
[11:51] old of me if you do something in
[11:53] addition being you just up for me I do
[11:56] some for you
[11:59] dr. love has no how will you will it's
[12:03] all God that I learned do it whether you
[12:05] want whether you like it or not I'm
[12:07] going to do this all right so we see
[12:10] that that this love is agape love of man
[12:14] shall wax cold we see that happening now
[12:16] even here and what is the network and
[12:20] equally a sin that you know you
[12:22] shouldn't do but you do it anyway
[12:24] right they neither shall endure unto the
[12:26] end the same shall be saved
[12:30] and this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[12:33] preached into all the world for a
[12:35] witness unto all nations and then shall
[12:37] the end come
[12:40] right good look we're living in the end
[12:45] time but when we leave this earth that's
[12:48] not the end we're going to be a secret
[12:53] cat that's what people do not get where
[12:55] this is we are going to leave this earth
[12:57] and there's going to be nothing that's
[13:00] going to seem out of cater for a while
[13:05] you talk to most people denominational
[13:10] ones and they're going to tell you that
[13:13] they know that they're going to see the
[13:15] skies park I mean I just heard it this
[13:19] guy is going to pardon Jesus is going to
[13:21] walk down and pick his children up and
[13:24] take us home every eye shall see the
[13:27] Bible tells you that but you gotta
[13:28] remember that's not the coming we are
[13:30] that's not as I'm trying to get y'all to
[13:33] see me then don't let yesterday and this
[13:35] is one points each person is not
[13:36] included into that
[13:41] it is totally and he said well we're
[13:45] segregating ourselves I got a quote
[13:47] brother Brown said God is a segregated
[13:51] God is a segregated not black - why not
[13:54] not from you know Asian and in fact no
[13:57] God to segregate ago he said you don't
[13:59] touch them all right so neither the same
[14:02] Gator but being a segregated though he
[14:05] has segregated that Genesis 1.6 man but
[14:07] he's also calling to those people
[14:11] telling them you can come in and you
[14:13] want to but he knows who he is he knows
[14:15] he different so therefore being God he
[14:18] knows he has a special group of people
[14:20] and he's going to take us out of here
[14:23] and I brother I'm said he said what did
[14:26] five other people left Jefferson bill
[14:27] right now he said nobody don't for a
[14:30] year or more and that's Jefferson bill
[14:33] what about the whole world right we
[14:36] leave this place and disappear yeah sure
[14:38] here your clothes families gonna but
[14:41] they all don't go life didn't done
[14:44] branding people they probably went up in
[14:46] a mountain somewhere or they you know
[14:48] are they all the way to gentlemen bill
[14:50] are they always been you know you're
[14:51] selling center so what I'm saying is
[14:55] when every I shall behold and all the
[14:56] things you better not be at that
[14:58] resurrect I mean he very healthy at that
[15:00] coming right the Last Judgement but
[15:05] we're going to be taken out of it first
[15:06] to me that's what the secret of the
[15:08] field are the secret of these fields are
[15:11] is we're going to take a body change we
[15:14] know all this has already happened to a
[15:16] group of people seven groups of people
[15:21] surveyed seven groups of people already
[15:24] been to these they received the word for
[15:27] their hour but not the eagle anointing
[15:28] water but they received the word God has
[15:31] preserved them into and degrade waiting
[15:36] the redemption of the volume which oh my
[15:39] god come to Redemption here before
[15:41] backing up all right so that's the same
[15:43] thing here we we saw these seven
[15:45] churches this is half
[15:46] now we've got what I hope you many times
[15:48] before you got to remember we got I
[15:52] don't want you to look at this as
[15:54] sometimes getting something but but your
[15:57] soul once you receive a revelation once
[15:59] you receive the new birth your soul is
[16:01] gone in this dimension
[16:02] you should all wear it over the other no
[16:04] it's right not only wherever we're
[16:08] supposed to be
[16:08] Paul said what in heavenly places now it
[16:13] is a heavenly place
[16:14] no where you receive revelation from one
[16:17] feeling dream no that's where the
[16:20] revelation stopped in these three
[16:21] dimensions when when we come down into
[16:23] time God stopped what fellowshipping
[16:26] with man like he did without okay so now
[16:31] we got but when he come back he come
[16:33] back into these three dimensions and
[16:35] he's going to take us back giving us a
[16:37] promise we're gonna talk about this
[16:38] afternoon what about the promise he gave
[16:40] us a promise of what he would do to
[16:43] fulfill genesis 3:15 and to fulfil acts
[16:47] 2:38 and to fulfill genesis 3:15 God
[16:52] came back himself to take you where he
[16:55] is
[16:56] he said where I am there you be also
[16:57] right so to me your your soul is not in
[17:02] this to making sure if you're born again
[17:04] as I said if you're not born again you
[17:06] you can understand the things of God the
[17:08] bicycle Bible said that's what the Bible
[17:10] said that's not what the promise is no I
[17:13] said oh there's a pileup it without the
[17:15] Holy Ghost you can't understand this
[17:17] Bible or Jesus Christ for any male said
[17:21] the Bible this is the Jesus Christ you
[17:22] can't understand it without heaven Oh
[17:24] Leo's right amen all right
[17:25] why do you understand it when you have
[17:27] the whole go because you're the one that
[17:30] wrote the one that wrote it is inside of
[17:32] you speaking out plus Angie if you know
[17:37] going through the series about the fall
[17:39] look at the effects of the fall was
[17:41] though that man could go back and go out
[17:43] you come in and clean your soul up take
[17:46] all that old brother up that imprint and
[17:49] take all that backs away from you put
[17:52] his life in you and
[17:53] you become a new creature a new creation
[17:55] well I must not happen that's what's
[17:57] happening all this is what's happening
[17:58] in all these fields
[18:00] you're becoming a new creation you
[18:02] should all brother that's a new birth I
[18:04] die daily I was come with you creating
[18:09] every day every day right I'll go a new
[18:12] creation one of the things are
[18:14] developing as a baby you know like
[18:17] Ulysses there he's got everything she's
[18:19] got to be able grown woman but you don't
[18:23] put thing don't hurt that age that she
[18:25] would have to handle that big thing they
[18:27] things at 15 she went that panel when
[18:30] she's hurt till she's 30 you know they
[18:32] don't say so that way John that way I
[18:34] understand the way God does it because
[18:36] he knows he knows how we develop as a
[18:40] human because guess what he developed in
[18:41] the human he learned by the things he's
[18:45] wife suffered right that's why I was
[18:47] telling you before God didn't promise
[18:49] you a perfect life he problems you
[18:50] eternal life you know all that not till
[18:53] we get over not do we get that here
[18:55] it brought you the perfect life he
[18:58] promised us eternal life all right
[19:00] that's why everybody thank boy get the
[19:02] new birth brother Browns yeah you get a
[19:03] new birth no you probably go away no
[19:05] let's go this time that's when they
[19:08] start why because truly if your soul is
[19:12] that another dimension receiving
[19:14] revelation from God and speaking to God
[19:16] the part of you that's here which is
[19:18] your spirit the spiritual part of you
[19:20] spirit part of you is still in this
[19:22] world memory memory is unconscious
[19:26] affection imagination you take them five
[19:28] and you think about what troubled you
[19:30] more than anything
[19:31] once it's not your flesh your seat they
[19:34] still smell in here only reacts to what
[19:36] their five senses in the middle memory
[19:39] that's my problem but God can take the
[19:44] holy dose and go through that memory and
[19:47] show me this
[19:49] right I can remember what God taught me
[19:53] reasoning you sure you can but still
[19:56] remember you gotta say it coming in the
[19:57] other way all right
[20:02] say it's coming in this way and dogs
[20:03] coming last one the great Bell they will
[20:05] fall tonight in your heart listen the
[20:10] Greg
[20:10] that's why brother Brown was sold for
[20:12] cyber he's a lot of noise you say no I
[20:14] said my Emma Hart no these are sayings
[20:17] in there or gods in there we have to
[20:19] understand that there's no finding in
[20:22] your soul you're either faith or your
[20:24] doubt the fighting is in the spirit
[20:27] around up here you say down here e to
[20:31] the grant spell ever thought in your
[20:32] mind even born again greatest battle at
[20:37] the end every born again the greatest
[20:39] battle ever fought is is that we got to
[20:40] get this Carl line what turn back toward
[20:44] the word and everything's are putting
[20:45] the word is for us to be able to turn
[20:47] back all right I mean look look look at
[20:52] this afternoon brother I said at that
[20:54] day see that's now that's this day that
[20:59] wasn't all today sure they saw a little
[21:05] part of it and that day you'll know that
[21:07] I'm and father pomian but when we come
[21:09] to this time right here this is it and
[21:13] why is it boots burns and you know that
[21:15] you look and see this is the title that
[21:17] this is the time of the culmination
[21:20] because it said the bridegroom waited
[21:22] we've been waiting for seven church ages
[21:24] but remember there was a call sign rose
[21:29] up woke up went in I let's look for all
[21:32] couldn't find any comeback names already
[21:34] going
[21:34] that's the rafter we're looking at
[21:36] that's today and why they have to do
[21:39] with that these fields that got come
[21:40] today because a lot of preachers say
[21:44] well these seals are for you know
[21:45] they're for you and send them away with
[21:47] a daniels muh ball I spear from
[21:49] needed no remember everything that's
[21:51] given by God in that onion peeled layer
[21:55] upon layer you are not listening you are
[21:59] not excluded from one scripture not one
[22:03] you are included in everything you say
[22:07] what might be there well what were you
[22:09] before number one you were the devil
[22:11] oh but every picture has a dual meaning
[22:15] secret meaning and then a meaning does
[22:18] right and also meaning to the Jews
[22:21] because remember and it was hard for me
[22:24] to see that the Bible brother ground is
[22:27] written to Christian we say no Bible
[22:31] would read the Christian but a sinner
[22:33] has to read it to become Christian so
[22:38] what you say it was written to
[22:40] Christians about creating bring example
[22:43] to the center so that he can take it and
[22:45] enter into and become part of that right
[22:49] remember Redemption what I love and into
[22:51] I you guys come out of the world and
[22:53] then to Christ or into the into the
[22:55] world so let's read this
[23:05] while property gods to pray for
[23:06] revelation more than anything I prayed
[23:09] the daughter show me just a little bit
[23:11] doesn't matter just a little bit and you
[23:13] know you did this week showed me a few
[23:14] things that that I had had that I
[23:17] struggled brother there we were talking
[23:18] yesterday going on us clothing and I had
[23:21] a question and going to answer that
[23:23] question so you know but you know why
[23:26] would you just sit there like a fly on
[23:28] them in a flower pot you you know I'm
[23:31] gonna get much you got a question asked
[23:34] them I said I mean I ain't y'all say we
[23:36] you know I ask questions I have to ask
[23:38] questions right I love asking questions
[23:41] I mean it's not bad though in dumb
[23:45] questions when you carry around all you
[23:47] out you know you know you pick it up
[23:49] it's not when you open the fifth seal I
[23:53] saw under the altar the souls of them we
[23:55] were slammed with work garden for the
[23:57] testimony which they held know what
[24:01] brother branham held that scripture many
[24:03] times to be the souls under the altar
[24:06] even crying how long how long as the
[24:10] bride right before the sealed over
[24:14] you'll pay end up if you'll read the
[24:16] fifth seal will tell you but now that is
[24:20] true if you take the onion field because
[24:22] there are soldiers the Ultrabook when
[24:24] you come further and read what they said
[24:28] see then you take that scripture in
[24:30] these two just meld right together and
[24:33] we know it's a bit sealed you not the
[24:36] bride of Jesus coming because of what
[24:39] they said okay see that your relations
[24:42] that's been there for 1,500 years ago
[24:46] Bibles been written and nobody's called
[24:49] it the lamb time that's why the seals
[24:51] are so important what does he do in
[24:53] answer his question a loved ones
[24:56] property God said he said that the seal
[24:58] revealed what which that which was
[25:02] another one three came from that which
[25:05] he is and that wishes to cover even
[25:08] that's what John Senden book revelation
[25:10] that was what prolapses
[25:11] we'll show where you come from what
[25:13] you're doing here and where you go all
[25:15] right so that's the three bowl purpose
[25:17] all dusty 42 cry all Christ important to
[25:21] us and then we're going back to pass
[25:23] that to the Garden of Eden we're going
[25:25] back to the garden to be all right so
[25:28] what wonderful wonderful message we got
[25:31] and they probably allow boys say how
[25:33] long how long how long O Lord holy and
[25:36] true dost thou not judge and avenge our
[25:38] blood on them that dwell on the earth we
[25:40] know one thing's for sure that is not
[25:44] the bride of Jesus Christ because
[25:46] remember we would be saying Father
[25:50] forgive them for they know not what they
[25:51] do that would be us so that's what our
[25:54] Savior did on the cross he didn't say to
[25:56] be my blood
[25:58] he said Father forgive them they don't
[26:00] want to do it so therefore the Prophet
[26:03] running running the scripture through
[26:06] their Holy Ghost filter come to this
[26:10] assumption not even assumption a prophet
[26:13] doesn't listen don't remember he did
[26:15] roaming but he said we just presume
[26:17] anything we're assuming we were people
[26:19] we got to know so whether a new write
[26:22] land that that was not the bride it was
[26:25] another group of people he breathed and
[26:29] what wrote arguing there one of them it
[26:31] was said to them that they should rest
[26:33] yet for a little while until their
[26:34] fellow-servants so whatever it wasn't
[26:36] under the altar had to be only earth
[26:40] toast fellow service also their brethren
[26:43] rose magenta cute
[26:47] that should be killed as they were
[26:50] should be fulfilled and we know what's
[26:55] going to happen to know that that Jews
[26:58] are going to be slaughtered until until
[27:01] the I say real in time go back to that
[27:07] 1260 days the battle Armageddon is
[27:09] coming that will be the end time that
[27:12] will be termination of the world as we
[27:14] know it now do you understand what I'm
[27:16] saying
[27:16] as we know now now will be the end of
[27:19] the world it's not going to be the end
[27:21] of time I know that just an interruption
[27:25] of nature like we're going to get into
[27:27] the fist deal that's another
[27:28] interruption of nature that we'll have
[27:30] to deal with because the interruption of
[27:33] nature that we take in the new birth is
[27:36] the first one the first one it's got us
[27:40] on it we're not warning in it we'll have
[27:42] a new nature if we don't have a new life
[27:45] then the old optional people go it's
[27:48] just a think I'm taking over we're going
[27:50] as the scripture said down to time they
[27:52] said oh Jesus is coming well way by
[27:54] killing the 50s and coming to them but
[27:57] remember the signs were not there for
[28:01] him to come now the signs are here for
[28:07] him to come all the church ages have run
[28:09] out with the last prophet to the
[28:12] Gentiles has run out
[28:13] I don't mean run out and did it I mean
[28:15] run out to where the prophecy is in our
[28:18] hands
[28:18] all right everything is that that day
[28:21] everything has come right now to us
[28:24] standing here today no other group to
[28:27] throw it to no other prophet to come no
[28:29] other generation to come as far as a
[28:32] Gentile morning in generation this is it
[28:35] so what if our if our nature is not
[28:39] interested burst then there's no way
[28:42] because remember I will fail first then
[28:47] the creation felt hunted
[28:49] right now fail and God had to turn in
[28:55] curvier remember read your Bible
[29:00] even after the Asian Street good thing
[29:01] when they read it today a little bit the
[29:04] Galatian I mean no tension freaking
[29:06] thing relations of Jenson's replace the
[29:09] previous thing to to dentistry to think
[29:11] when I thought about genesis 3:15 what
[29:13] the problems was want to see them what
[29:14] he done afterwards teacher okay if
[29:16] you're going to what you're going to
[29:17] bear children in sorrow I am because of
[29:20] what you listen to your wild cursed is
[29:22] the ground delivered rain comes up on
[29:25] the grounds curves command just wait is
[29:30] everything okay I mean man even after it
[29:34] was cursed man live almost a thousand
[29:36] years what about that I went back to and
[29:40] I'm reading Genesis now than a million
[29:42] gentle I'm 41 I've read the whole book
[29:44] of Genesis in man and people live a long
[29:47] time
[29:48] kichul magnet being 500 years old and
[29:51] just be in midlife but there was a live
[29:56] another incision nine years why was 120
[29:58] years old for his first child yeah yeah
[30:03] but you know what though that was that
[30:05] was to me that was showing that how
[30:07] perfect out of a need worry they were
[30:09] state of that condition on how much we
[30:12] could live that even after the fall
[30:16] after the sex comes in after time comes
[30:18] in after all that comes in my thirties
[30:23] was filled with nine fifty-nine year and
[30:25] there's five hundred seven years six
[30:27] hundred seven here
[30:28] the what
[30:31] based on this is it always on fault then
[30:38] don't then don't use one company we
[30:41] apologized interviews working at this
[30:43] time no matter that we don't want to
[30:46] hear that which means sometimes before
[30:50] brain getting here Johnny is not all
[30:53] exon fault it is all of our fault a
[30:58] man's intelligence is our fault okay all
[31:03] right yeah but you know what those
[31:06] people did all they don't just develop
[31:07] what they went back before the flood and
[31:11] picked up all the oil it was under
[31:13] bigger health of all the plants and
[31:15] animals and people they never tell you
[31:17] people in school just for a few minutes
[31:19] before we go you know they don't ever
[31:20] you always go you see this you're crazy
[31:23] that you got to just a certain age and
[31:24] then protozoa and all these things came
[31:26] up and we're living off a dead plants
[31:28] and animals there was people here too
[31:32] and they all died in the footage
[31:35] separate them and if they were seven
[31:37] billion people before where it was in
[31:39] the days of Noah weird it said well
[31:42] we're doing six point nine nine nine
[31:44] eight nine nine nine billion people
[31:47] without the agent leo
[31:49] we're they Ellen they go in your car I
[31:55] told somebody that does a normal person
[31:58] in that way now man it plants an animal
[32:01] does it think over here yes all we are
[32:07] is petroleum anyway were jellies elected
[32:10] by thought we are you know we're yeah
[32:12] yeah but see that that's why probably
[32:20] come but you know what let me tell you
[32:22] this and not be not be I'm not
[32:24] belittling the profit for brother
[32:26] branham opened the door so that we can
[32:28] understand he did not give us every
[32:31] detail
[32:33] he didn't have time he creates deep
[32:36] reason a people to preach 5 a lifetime
[32:39] he would have never been able to bring
[32:42] everything that God has revealed to us
[32:45] after the prophets well by the Holy
[32:47] Ghost by the Prophet being the porter to
[32:50] open the door and introduce us to Christ
[32:53] the real person right so then cries -
[32:56] what speak to brother Raman speak to you
[32:58] that happened 60 years ago but as we
[33:04] hear the voice in other words there's
[33:07] power behind that voice that was the
[33:10] voice of Almighty God so he can then
[33:13] reveal things to you that brethren
[33:15] listen but I'm never revealed explain to
[33:17] anybody right not so he didn't really
[33:21] old nothing ready right he preach the
[33:24] Word of God he got a revelation God took
[33:28] that in took his human factor his voice
[33:32] and and molded it with his and then he
[33:37] spoke saying that man had never seen but
[33:42] what are we supposed to do with it just
[33:44] say well I was just listening to what he
[33:46] said look at the confusion of people
[33:51] they just listen to what he said
[33:53] remember the brothers they come from
[33:54] Africa that went over there confronted
[33:57] so the trevor of them what were they
[34:00] holding in there man that's a marriage
[34:02] in divorce booth oh yeah that video is
[34:07] to me it's just classic I'm sorry but
[34:09] that's a classic example that you just
[34:11] don't listen to tapes because they took
[34:14] that man in divorce book right here
[34:16] right the brother will call in brother
[34:18] will it's that I don't believe that now
[34:19] they don't believe the manual or pletely
[34:23] I'm sorry that brother said you'll
[34:25] probably did right hands if believing me
[34:26] was leading right out of marriage and
[34:29] divorce book the way you'll save you
[34:31] don't have a revelation or if you don't
[34:33] so some kind of teaching you did you

[34:40] right easy right that's right you want
[34:43] to be me bring a book down us over bring
[34:48] elbows down here we'll talk about it why
[34:53] because what the Prophet brought us two
[34:57] big nuggets and inside that big nuggets

[35:03] nuggets for me we can't swallow big
[35:05] nothing we call a little dude I mean I

[36:10] man to everything it comes in and they
[36:13] said well we've heard that before last
[36:14] example no you should Amen just as much
[36:18] because what you're doing is you're
[36:19] setting an example that that person may
[36:21] say hey they may have something here if
[36:24] all these people believe it
[36:26] like Jim's dad and Jim's dad always
[36:28] thought that my dad was the only one
[36:30] that believed we're waiting brent was
[36:32] the problem so he only were nut cases
[36:34] they brother that was just something he
[36:36] pulled him oldest man william branham
[36:38] out of a hat and he killed one they
[36:40] believed in till he started meeting
[36:42] brothers okay brother George Quinn all
[36:46] those brothers even foreign countries
[36:47] and all the medicines we have coming in
[36:49] jeans that would be there certain times
[36:52] and we have people when they put these
[36:54] same things we believe these are
[36:55] brothers we have churches in this place
[36:57] we all don't want to display this right
[37:00] you know what it doesn't change the data
[37:02] cute though it changes the attitude to
[37:04] we're not just want some little you know
[37:07] Jim Joe more Jim Jones all take a look
[37:10] you know over and South African drinking
[37:12] tea I mean some good way so you know
[37:15] you're no effective there are real
[37:17] people in this manatee and believe it
[37:20] and they limit and that that is the part
[37:22] of I think we are healthy don't be
[37:26] ashamed of the gospel that you know that
[37:27] don't not be ashamed
[37:29] we don't be what happen you be ashamed
[37:31] yeah good how can you be shamed
[37:35] at UPenn you should never be ashamed of
[37:38] eternal life
[37:39] she got the godly look that overtakes
[37:43] everything everything so no affinity
[37:47] let's run get real quick we'll go on one
[37:49] minute no not that based or what the the
[37:51] bride's don't so this is just to the Jew
[37:54] okay he come into another dimension
[37:57] because they're under the altar they're
[37:59] not in this dimension they're in another
[38:00] dimension okay
[38:02] so John hands go and look across into
[38:05] another dimension and see that go George
[38:07] saw and we had opened the fifth seal I
[38:11] saw under the altar so he had to carry
[38:13] him into another dimension while roads
[38:16] were given to them they did not have
[38:18] them while the world earth they were
[38:19] giving to them for what the testimony
[38:22] which they held all right they were all
[38:25] Jews and they're going they're going to
[38:28] have to wait for 1260 days after we're
[38:31] gone for 1260 days they're gonna have to
[38:33] wait to end the app another all right so
[38:38] the Pennsy are we looking at three
[38:39] things here we looking at the greatest
[38:41] showing of grade giving some laser loud
[38:44] that did not want justification Thomas -
[38:48] we just see the real you didn't do it
[38:51] cuz remember if the real thing did it
[38:53] they're going to hell but the real them
[38:57] didn't do it in God's mind he blinded
[39:01] them for a reason and then given me our
[39:04] life now and it's the first revelation
[39:07] for the body chain that your body though
[39:10] you've sinned with it with this body
[39:14] it's going to be changed
[39:16] it's going to be changed literally
[39:19] changing the moment 2009
[39:21] let's go back up a little bit maybe name
[39:23] tiny little start and see Lord bless you
