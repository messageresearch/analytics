[6:01] that
[6:02] because the Bible says so,
[6:04] you know, and if they had found that in
[6:06] the scripture, you need to go dig it up
[6:08] somewhere. The sisters are going to come
[6:10] and minister for us this afternoon. It's
[6:12] all
[6:14] uh
[6:16] I don't know who the sisters are going
[6:17] to be except usually there's three of
[6:20] them and one of them not here.
[6:23] Amen.
[6:24] And their piano player is not here
[6:26] either. So that's
[6:31] we going to make it.
[6:43] How
[6:45] can I say thanks
[6:49] for the things
[6:52] God has done for me.
[6:57] Things
[6:59] so undeserved.
[7:03] Yet he gave
[7:06] to prove your love for me.
[7:10] The voices
[7:13] of a million angels.
[7:17] And I express
[7:20] my gratitude.
[7:24] All that I am
[7:26] and ever hope to be.
[7:32] I
[7:34] owe it all to thee.
[7:38] To God
[7:41] be the glory.
[7:45] To God
[7:48] be the glory.
[7:53] To God
[7:56] be the glory
[7:59] for the things
[8:02] he has done.
[8:06] With his blood
[8:09] he has saved
[8:11] me. With his power
[8:16] he has raised
[8:18] me. To God
[8:22] be the glory
[8:26] for the things
[8:28] he has done.
[8:32] Just let me live
[8:36] my life.
[8:39] Let it be pleasing,
[8:42] Lord, unto thee.
[8:45] And should I
[8:49] praise,
[8:51] let it go to Calary,
[8:58] with his love.
[9:02] He has saved me. With his power
[9:08] he has raised
[9:10] me to God
[9:14] be the glory
[9:18] for the things
[9:20] he has done.
[9:24] For the things
[9:26] he has done.
[9:33] [Applause]
[9:40] Amen.
[9:42] That's right.
[9:43] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[9:45] Y'all, y'all remember, of course, I say,
[9:48] "Pray for me." And I mean, pray for me.
[9:51] I got a I got my hand, this hand right
[9:54] here, not want to work right here. And I
[9:57] Well, June knows about it. You ever had
[9:59] a trigger finger? Let me tell you what
[10:02] is it's one of those things that if you
[10:05] hit yourself on the nail with a hammer,
[10:07] you going to say, "Ouch."
[10:09] And my wife, she jumped on me for
[10:12] hollering when it got hung up. Let me
[10:14] tell you what, when that thing gets
[10:16] locked up and you have to peel it back,
[10:18] let me tell you, it hurts. So y'all pray
[10:21] me. So I'm having to learn to play this
[10:23] old thing different and I hope I can
[10:26] keep on playing.
[10:27] Amen. We going to Mos. She reserves us
[10:31] all day.
[10:34] Open the eyes of my heart.
[10:39] Open the eyes of my heart.
[10:42] I want to see.
[10:47] I want
[10:53] the eyes of my heart.
[10:57] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[11:06] [Applause]
[11:08] Heat. Heat.
[11:18] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[11:28] Yeah.
[11:31] Heat.
[11:41] Heat.
[11:46] Heat.
[11:58] I want to see.
[12:03] Amen. Amen.
[12:04] Amen.
[12:05] I want to see you.
[12:06] Good to see everybody in the house of
[12:08] the Lord.
[12:08] Amen.
[12:08] You like turn in your scriptures. Turn
[12:10] back where we've been reading in Matthew
[12:12] 5 and we will go to Hebrews 6. Matthew
[12:17] 5. Hebrews 6.
[12:21] Anna and Richard called and said they're
[12:24] stuck in traffic in Chattanooga,
[12:26] Tennessee. So remember them that that
[12:28] the Lord would open it up and and get
[12:31] all through.
[12:35] Remember now, Lord willing, this coming
[12:37] Sunday, we will be Saturday night and
[12:40] Sunday, we'll be over brother Collins's
[12:42] preaching for him and Wade will be
[12:46] taking the services here. So, just
[12:48] remember that on Saturday night service
[12:50] is 6:00 and I assume that the Sunday
[12:53] service is 10 or 10
[12:55] whatever
[12:56] 10:30
[12:57] 10:30. Sunday morning service is 10:30.
[13:00] So, we'll be there Saturday night,
[13:01] Sunday morning. So, pray if you want to
[13:03] come be with us, do that and then make
[13:06] sure you come back here for the regular
[13:09] service. Okay? And now Terrence had
[13:11] already announced that the uh service
[13:13] for brother Dawn and what it will be. So
[13:16] just remember that Thursday at 200 p.m.
[13:19] and there will be just it's a cremation
[13:22] and it will be uh you know just there to
[13:25] few words to be said and cast his uh
[13:28] ashes upon the the ground. So just
[13:31] remember that and pray that the Lord
[13:33] would bless. If you have any extra that
[13:36] you want to give they didn't have any
[13:38] insurance so make sure you know to help
[13:41] pay for the bills and things. I know the
[13:42] offering was there. If you have anything
[13:44] else you want to give, but feel free to
[13:46] do it. We'll make sure they get a hold
[13:47] of it. Okay? Just remember those things.
[13:50] And also remember the Bible study will
[13:53] be the second Saturday in December,
[13:55] which is December the 10th, will be at
[13:57] 6:00.
[13:58] How about communion?
[14:00] Uh we will we'll probably have the
[14:03] communion and foot washing on the
[14:06] second
[14:07] Sunday, which will be the 11th. All
[14:09] right. So, we have to make sure we we
[14:11] know that won't be on the 1st. It'll be
[14:13] on the 2nd. We always try to do that.
[14:15] Keep Sister Trudy trained where she can
[14:18] she likes to come down for the Saturday
[14:20] night Bible study and we like to keep
[14:22] her on time. Okay. So, we we appreciate
[14:24] her coming. Amen.
[14:25] Amen.
[14:26] You love him.
[14:27] Matthew 5, Hebrews 6. Heavenly Father,
[14:30] we thank you for this day and thank you
[14:31] for the hour that we have, the time Lord
[14:34] that you have given unto us and for the
[14:37] freedom at until this day that we can
[14:40] meet together and be able to worship you
[14:43] and and Lord to have a good time in you.
[14:47] We may face a time that it will come
[14:49] that we will not be able to do these
[14:50] things, but that's up to you, Lord,
[14:53] because you said when the enemy comes in
[14:55] like a flood, the spirit of the Lord
[14:57] will raise up a standard. So we believe
[14:59] you. We do everything we can now to pack
[15:01] in to get everything ready
[15:04] against that day. And just forgive us
[15:07] now of our failures and lead us Lord and
[15:09] bless each one. Bless uh the again
[15:12] family there Lord and take care of all
[15:14] of them be with them
[15:15] and the loss of the loved one. And Lord,
[15:18] just have your way with each one of our
[15:19] hearts and lives today as we read your
[15:22] word and try to speak upon you, then
[15:25] come on the scene and reveal that word
[15:27] into our hearts because we believe that
[15:30] everything we get from you must come by
[15:33] faith. It's not just a a study. It's not
[15:36] just even a gathering of words or
[15:39] quotes, but it must be revealed unto
[15:41] each one of us. We love you and we thank
[15:43] you in Jesus is your name. Amen.
[15:49] Hebrews
[15:51] be Matthew 5 and Hebrews
[15:54] 6. Okay.
[15:58] Verse 37. But let your communication be
[16:01] yay yay and yay nay nay nay. For
[16:04] whatsoever is more than these cometh
[16:05] evil.
[16:07] You have heard that it hath been said an
[16:09] eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
[16:11] But I say unto you that you resist not
[16:14] evil. But what? But whosoever shall
[16:16] smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to
[16:19] him the other also. And if any man shall
[16:22] will sue thee at the law, take away thy
[16:25] coat, let him have thy cloak also. But
[16:28] whosoever shall compel thee to go a
[16:30] mile, go with him twain. Give to him
[16:32] that askkest thee, and from him that
[16:35] would borrow of thee, turn th not thou
[16:38] away. You have heard that it hath been
[16:40] said, thou shalt love thy neighbor, and
[16:43] hate thine enemy. But I say unto you,
[16:46] love your enemies. See, he's setting up
[16:48] a new thing as compared to the Old
[16:51] Testament.
[16:53] A new thing is coming into being to you.
[16:56] All right?
[16:58] But I say unto you, love your enemies,
[17:00] bless them that curse you, do good to
[17:02] them that hate you, and pray for them
[17:04] which defi despitefully use you and
[17:06] persecute you, that you may be the
[17:09] children of your father which is in
[17:10] heaven. For he maketh his son to rise on
[17:13] the evil and on the good, and to sendeth
[17:15] rain on the just and the unjust. For if
[17:18] you love them which love you, what
[17:19] reward have you? Do not even the
[17:21] publicans the same?
[17:23] And if you salute your brethren only,
[17:25] what will do you more than others? Do
[17:28] not even the publicans so be therefore
[17:31] perfect, even as your father in heaven,
[17:33] which as your father which is in heaven
[17:36] is perfect. Then we'll go to Hebrews
[17:41] 6:1.
[17:44] Therefore, leaving the principles of the
[17:46] doctrine of Christ, let us go on to
[17:49] perfection, not laying again the
[17:51] foundation of repentance from dead
[17:52] works, and of faith toward God,
[17:57] of the doctrine of baptisms, and of
[17:59] laying on of hands, and of resurrection
[18:01] of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
[18:03] And this will we do if God permit. You
[18:07] may be seated. The Lord had his blessing
[18:09] to the reading of the word.
[18:20] I was making a reference this morning
[18:21] and said we had a Catholic among us. I
[18:24] meant we had a former Catholic.
[18:25] There you
[18:27] have a Catholic among us. We have a
[18:30] former Catholic.
[18:33] And you know what? That's all of us.
[18:37] with all former Catholics that we heard
[18:39] this message. So that you know,
[18:46] make sure too that you thank the sisters
[18:48] for the fixing of the food and
[18:50] everything and and I hope you enjoyed it
[18:52] and all cuz it was a good dinner and a
[18:56] good good time together in fellowship.
[18:58] Amen.
[19:00] Now,
[19:02] we were talking this morning and I asked
[19:04] the question the other day and that's
[19:05] what I'm trying to get to in these two
[19:07] services
[19:09] is uh what is the difference in perfect
[19:13] and perfection? You say, "Well, it's
[19:15] just the same word." Well, it may have a
[19:18] little different varying meaning and
[19:20] things. And um the amazing thing for me
[19:24] to study as we'll get to in a minute
[19:27] that you know generally there's a
[19:30] difference between the word of the Old
[19:31] Testament that will be like the the uh
[19:34] the Old Testament being the the Hebrew
[19:38] and then you try to bring that over to
[19:40] the Greek and and getting the definition
[19:42] of the wording is generally enough
[19:44] difference to be you know outstanding.
[19:47] If you look at those things a little
[19:49] bit, you'll see that it's, you know, it
[19:51] be like not not maybe so much a way
[19:53] difference, but a different form of
[19:56] trying to bring it to make it uh, you
[19:59] know, like their way and our way. But
[20:02] looking up perfection and perfect, we'll
[20:04] read in a little bit. I found it it
[20:06] compares to be to where the same word
[20:09] was in the Old Testament and the same
[20:11] word is in the New Testament definition,
[20:14] you know, of that wording. All right?
[20:16] And you say, "Well, what's the
[20:17] difference in what a word means?" Well,
[20:20] uh, I am
[20:21] I think it's entirely
[20:23] That's right.
[20:24] a wonderful thing to be able to have an
[20:26] understanding. I'm not a Greek scholar,
[20:28] but I thank God for those that were,
[20:32] those that brought it down to us and
[20:34] placed it within our hands to where that
[20:37] we could understand those things. And
[20:40] then we have the prophet's message to
[20:43] look at them by and you know and that's
[20:46] where we pick up the things from. So we
[20:48] we thank the Lord for that.
[20:51] Now the prophet of God I didn't bring
[20:53] you this one but on the message
[20:54] perseverance
[20:56] brother R says that you everything you
[20:58] get from God comes by faith.
[21:02] That's right.
[21:03] He said you got to believe it.
[21:05] Yes.
[21:05] Amen.
[21:06] So you can't go out to the world and
[21:08] prove God.
[21:09] Right. You say, "Oh, yes, I can. I can
[21:11] show them a blade of grass and I can
[21:12] show them that." That's all right. They
[21:15] already know about that.
[21:17] That's not going to convince them. They
[21:19] already know. That's where you get the
[21:21] uh uh you know, you would get your
[21:24] things from the books from them,
[21:25] right?
[21:26] But after all of their doings with it,
[21:28] they still can't find God.
[21:30] All right. See, so it's you know, you
[21:32] got to believe it by faith. Amen. Right?
[21:34] Cuz you read over there in Hebrews 11,
[21:37] it's all of those that said by faith, by
[21:39] faith, by faith, by faith. They And you
[21:42] got to uh to keep that in the correct
[21:45] order in your mind.
[21:48] But now, did you understand what I was
[21:50] trying to get at? And we'll try to get
[21:51] to the difference in perfect and
[21:52] perfection.
[21:54] Now, if the word perfect means what it
[21:56] does, and we'll get to the definitions
[21:58] in a minute, but there there is not any
[22:02] way to add anything to perfect
[22:06] because if it was, it wouldn't be
[22:07] perfect.
[22:08] That's right.
[22:08] All right.
[22:10] So, now you can add per perfect to
[22:12] perfect.
[22:14] Mhm.
[22:15] You know, because it's more of the same
[22:16] source.
[22:18] All right. See, when you look at the
[22:20] pyramid and you see faith at the bottom,
[22:22] that's the new birth. And virtue is a
[22:24] birth.
[22:26] Now you have all of this. Each one can
[22:28] be called a birth
[22:30] because a birth means a coming forth in
[22:32] two. And see each one of them can be
[22:35] brought out as a birth. But it's not
[22:38] different things. We're not built of a
[22:40] the cell of a dog and a cell of a cat
[22:43] and a cell of a monkey put together and
[22:46] come out to be a human.
[22:48] That won't work. It's all one thing.
[22:50] Right? You know, so then perfect is a
[22:54] beautiful word.
[22:55] Amen.
[22:56] But I must define to you to help you to
[23:00] follow it the way I see it. That
[23:04] when you're looking at perfect,
[23:06] remember what I've been trying to bring
[23:10] under the atonement.
[23:14] That person that truly believed God
[23:18] was so covered by the blood
[23:21] that was offered to the animal etc thing
[23:24] that they stood perfect
[23:27] before God.
[23:28] Right?
[23:29] And God wouldn't didn't come down to
[23:31] kill everybody.
[23:34] Now,
[23:37] following my point,
[23:39] even when Moses was there to stand in
[23:41] the way, you know that God didn't come
[23:43] down to kill everybody in the world,
[23:44] right? That's right.
[23:48] Are you listening?
[23:49] Right.
[23:49] Yes.
[23:51] Cuz the atonement was there.
[23:53] Amen.
[23:54] What did he come down and say, Moses,
[23:56] I'm going to wipe wipe out the whole
[23:58] world.
[24:00] I'm going start over with you.
[24:02] You didn't say that.
[24:05] He was talking about the children of
[24:06] Israel.
[24:07] Amen.
[24:07] Mhm.
[24:08] So then he was capable of coming from
[24:10] under the blood.
[24:14] And that blood was laid there before the
[24:16] foundation of the world.
[24:17] Amen.
[24:18] Right.
[24:19] But he was capable of coming down under
[24:22] the blood and he could have wiped out
[24:24] the children of Israel.
[24:26] But he wouldn't have wiped out everybody
[24:28] in the world.
[24:30] That was not what he was talking about.
[24:33] And see, then we talk about it as being
[24:35] the world being under the bumper blood.
[24:39] You know, the blood of Jesus Christ, the
[24:41] red crimson blood. And that man is not a
[24:45] sinner in front of God because God can't
[24:48] see you.
[24:50] He can't see the blood. See through the
[24:51] blood. Cuz if he looks through red at
[24:53] red, he sees white.
[24:55] That's right. See, it's when the blood
[24:56] sister has been a woman to go and and I
[24:59] expressed it this way and she'd come up
[25:01] with with the point which is right that
[25:03] when the the bride goes up, mercy is
[25:06] gone.
[25:06] Yeah, that's right.
[25:08] You know what? The blood will be gone.
[25:09] That's right. Absolutely.
[25:11] Right.
[25:12] And when it is, the wrath of God can be
[25:14] poured out.
[25:14] Right.
[25:15] These storms and all these earthquakes
[25:17] and things like today 200,000 being
[25:19] killed. That's not tribulation. That's a
[25:22] tribulation but not the tribulation.
[25:25] The tribulation is the wrath of God
[25:27] poured out because it won't be any blood
[25:30] atonement.
[25:31] Right.
[25:31] So he'll be able to come down and
[25:33] annihilate everything.
[25:34] Sure.
[25:35] But see, even until this day, that
[25:38] atonement is still there.
[25:39] Amen.
[25:40] Until we go out here,
[25:42] we go out, the atonement goes with us.
[25:44] Right. Right.
[25:45] All right. Then the only grace there is
[25:46] is to the 144,000. Right. Right.
[25:49] All right.
[25:51] But now thinking about it, so when we
[25:54] say that
[25:56] there there's no sinners in the world
[25:58] today,
[26:00] not meaning that man's not out there
[26:02] sinning. Amen.
[26:04] It's meaning that it's covered by the
[26:06] blood.
[26:06] That God can't see.
[26:08] That's right.
[26:09] What's transpiring
[26:10] and to not be able to see it,
[26:13] then he's not coming down to annihilate.
[26:16] Does everybody understand that? Right?
[26:18] So then you know maybe my wording is not
[26:21] good but it takes the Lord to reveal it
[26:24] anyway. So
[26:25] that's the point. But see under the
[26:28] blood then of the b w b w b w b w b w b
[26:29] w b w b w b w b w bulls and go gulps and
[26:31] things a man making that atonement was
[26:34] considered to be perfect.
[26:35] Sure. Amen.
[26:36] In God's eyes.
[26:39] Not perfect in man around him. You know
[26:41] Job with all of his comforters.
[26:46] And neither will people uh look at you
[26:49] and think you're perfect.
[26:51] But you know what I thought about doing?
[26:53] I better not, but I thought about it.
[26:57] You know, we do better under
[26:58] persecution.
[26:59] Right. That's right.
[27:02] And uh I thought about coming out and
[27:05] saying, but I found out that Wade's on
[27:07] the front seat by so he can't do it.
[27:11] I thought about coming out and saying,
[27:14] "Turn around and look at the person next
[27:15] to you and say, "You ain't perfect."
[27:22] You know, you start thinking about it.
[27:29] Well, am I or am I not?
[27:35] See, my point is under persecution,
[27:38] right? You'll think about it.
[27:40] That's right.
[27:41] If somebody don't jog your memory, you
[27:43] go right on through life just floating
[27:45] along wondering what's going on.
[27:49] Now, I'm quoting brother random whether
[27:50] you like it or not. He said the bride
[27:52] does better under persecution.
[27:54] You say, "What do we need today?" You
[27:57] know what we need today? We need for the
[28:00] world to get after us. That's
[28:01] right.
[28:02] And persecute us to death.
[28:05] That's right.
[28:07] Yep.
[28:08] No, brother. We don't No, no, no, no,
[28:10] no. Well, your prophet said we'd do
[28:14] better.
[28:17] See, because you don't think about
[28:18] things,
[28:18] right?
[28:19] Till somebody comes along and challenges
[28:21] you on it or something.
[28:24] You know that when they started out
[28:25] years ago, the Bible said there must
[28:27] needs to be heresies among you that they
[28:29] that are approved may be made manifest.
[28:32] And I remember the first major doctrine
[28:34] was one of them was about two souls
[28:38] and you know they went through you had
[28:40] two souls and if you person could be
[28:42] saved you had two and if you wasn't you
[28:44] just had one and and God come down and
[28:47] just killed one of them and left the
[28:48] other life alive cuz you didn't need
[28:49] nothing. All kind of doctrines went with
[28:51] it.
[28:53] But you know what happened?
[28:57] I began to wonder.
[29:00] I began to study
[29:04] of what really was a soul.
[29:10] Oh, I knew the definitions of beings and
[29:12] persons and what you are.
[29:15] But I began to wonder,
[29:17] you know, it made me study
[29:20] about the soul
[29:23] and I began to preach about
[29:27] and I began to find out that God was a
[29:29] soul.
[29:30] God didn't have a soul. He was a soul.
[29:33] Right?
[29:33] Cuz he was a person. That's
[29:35] right.
[29:35] You know what? It made me dig. So maybe
[29:38] we need to look at each other
[29:40] and say it.
[29:43] to where we'll start digging and
[29:45] thinking about what's being said.
[29:47] I know I'm carnal, forgive me, but
[29:49] you'll take that illustration home and
[29:51] think about it.
[29:53] You need somebody to jog you a little
[29:55] bit to get you to dig.
[29:56] Amen.
[29:57] You know, challenge you
[30:00] to move on.
[30:02] But being perfect now, under the blood
[30:04] of bulls and goats, God would call him
[30:06] perfect. Well, how much more would he
[30:08] talk about his little bride?
[30:11] Amen. and how perfect she is.
[30:15] And if he couldn't see Israel
[30:18] and their ways of doing it,
[30:20] how much more under the blood of Jesus
[30:24] Christ,
[30:24] right?
[30:25] Is there a covering for sin?
[30:29] Now, if we go with the fact that it
[30:31] don't make no difference in what I do,
[30:32] I'm perfect. Well, see, then you're
[30:34] lost.
[30:35] Come on. Do I need to Is there any other
[30:38] thing I can say to make that any
[30:39] stronger?
[30:42] If there's any inkling in your mind of
[30:45] thinking about that it don't matter what
[30:47] I do, I'm covered.
[30:51] Then if there's an inkling in your mind,
[30:52] then you need to repent of it. I need to
[30:54] repent of that.
[30:55] If there's something in my mind that
[30:57] would think that
[30:58] cuz we ought to always
[31:00] have within our thinking of the fact
[31:04] that God, we are human mortals that
[31:08] needs a savior. Amen. That's right.
[31:11] That's right. Amen.
[31:12] We need a redeemer.
[31:14] We need an advocate.
[31:17] Hallelujah.
[31:19] The word that we can walk on in God.
[31:21] Amen.
[31:23] And now the word perfect then we give
[31:25] the definition of any word. It means
[31:27] complete full grown.
[31:30] But then you take Martin Luther and
[31:32] compare him with this day
[31:34] as what he was doing out in in
[31:38] Kansas to those brothers and sisters.
[31:42] Well, you know what? Martin Luther
[31:48] was perfect
[31:52] by the new birth.
[31:55] And you know what?
[31:57] He was as full of age as he could get.
[32:00] That's right.
[32:01] He was at the height of growth of his
[32:03] time.
[32:04] Right.
[32:07] Are you following me?
[32:08] That's right. That's right.
[32:09] So the word perfect then is so perfect
[32:13] the definition until when I begin to
[32:16] look at it, I couldn't figure out any
[32:17] other way to express it.
[32:18] Right.
[32:20] See, but we think perfect means full
[32:23] grown. Well, when we get up here now, we
[32:25] going to be perfect. Yes.
[32:26] But we're not perfect down here.
[32:28] That's right.
[32:28] Now, that's where you're wrong.
[32:30] That's right. That's right.
[32:32] That's where I want you to know you're
[32:33] wrong.
[32:35] If you have the new birth, if you just
[32:37] got born again this minute,
[32:38] y
[32:38] that soul inside of you is perfect.
[32:41] That's right.
[32:42] Amen.
[32:43] But you don't have the growth
[32:44] development.
[32:45] Right.
[32:47] You know what? It's complete.
[32:49] Luther's new birth was complete.
[32:51] That's right.
[32:52] Wesley's new birth was complete.
[32:53] That's right.
[32:55] But yet comparing it to the day we're in
[32:58] of a growth development. Yeah.
[33:02] See, then by doing that, most people
[33:04] look back and say, "Lu didn't have
[33:05] anything. Wesley didn't have anything."
[33:07] Mhm.
[33:12] Like the top there, the two and a half
[33:14] tribes that Wade was bringing out. See,
[33:17] they took their inheritance outside of
[33:19] Canaan. But you know what? They had to
[33:21] go into Canaan first. Mhm.
[33:24] Yep.
[33:25] Right.
[33:26] And they had to come back out.
[33:27] Yep.
[33:28] Yes.
[33:29] They couldn't have stayed out here and
[33:30] said, "We got our we got our
[33:32] inheritance." Their inheritance was in
[33:34] Canaan.
[33:35] Right.
[33:36] Mhm.
[33:36] But they couldn't stay there.
[33:38] Because they wanted their place over
[33:40] here.
[33:41] And Moses said, "You go over Joshua.
[33:44] You go over and you fight the battle."
[33:46] Yep.
[33:46] And you do what you promised Moses. Yep.
[33:49] And then you can go back.
[33:51] Yep.
[33:52] And that's what happened.
[33:53] Yep.
[33:54] So that represents those down to there
[33:56] that never reached the completeness
[33:59] of their new birth, right?
[34:02] Not meaning they wasn't born again.
[34:04] Meaning they didn't have the ability to
[34:06] grow,
[34:06] right?
[34:08] I'm sure Martin Luther taught the statue
[34:10] of perfect man.
[34:12] I'm sure, excuse me, John Wesley taught
[34:15] there's that turkey and ham getting
[34:16] together.
[34:19] Poor old things had to die a week. have
[34:22] a good time today. Maybe we'll apologize
[34:25] to him later.
[34:27] But see, I want you to understand my
[34:30] point.
[34:33] See, you look at the word complete,
[34:35] perfect. You you you look at it, you
[34:37] see, and that's made people say, "Well,
[34:40] that word doesn't really mean just born
[34:42] again. It means of a full growth."
[34:46] Well, then this is the only age could
[34:49] reach that.
[34:50] Yeah. So what about everybody else?
[34:53] Right.
[34:55] Come on. Am I right? Is this the only
[34:56] age that can reach a perfection to be
[34:58] able to bring a change to the body?
[35:00] Right.
[35:01] Come on.
[35:02] Right. That's right.
[35:02] Yes, sir.
[35:04] This is the only age it can come to a
[35:06] change. Everybody else is waiting on us.
[35:08] Right.
[35:10] But they were waiting in their
[35:11] perfection of their age.
[35:13] That's right.
[35:15] They were waiting in the fact that they
[35:16] were newborn children.
[35:18] Right. Right. That's what made them
[35:20] wait.
[35:22] So the word perfect is is the definition
[35:24] of it in the Old and the New Testament
[35:26] is so beautiful
[35:28] until there's no need of trying to add
[35:30] anything to it. It's just get an
[35:32] understanding.
[35:33] That's right.
[35:36] We get the new birth. That's not the
[35:38] adoption of placing into the body of
[35:39] Christ. Is that true?
[35:41] That's right.
[35:43] See, that's the completeness or the
[35:45] growth development.
[35:46] Yes. But yet once you get there, when we
[35:50] get to the place the body is changed,
[35:52] you know what we can say? We're perfect.
[35:56] Right. That's right.
[35:57] We walk off here in a change. We can say
[35:59] we're perfect.
[36:00] That's right.
[36:02] We've reached full growth, full
[36:03] development, full maturity, and it's
[36:05] come to an end.
[36:08] So, we're standing here in the right
[36:09] order.
[36:10] Right.
[36:11] But you understand perfect then?
[36:13] Yes.
[36:14] You can't add anything to it. That's
[36:16] right.
[36:19] To make it more perfect.
[36:20] Right.
[36:21] Right.
[36:22] So then Luther are just as perfect as
[36:24] you are.
[36:24] Amen.
[36:25] Absolutely.
[36:25] Now, I know that won't be swallowed too
[36:27] good of the believers in the message,
[36:28] but that's all right.
[36:29] That's right.
[36:30] You tell me how it could be any other
[36:31] way.
[36:32] Yes.
[36:34] He was perfect cuz he had a new birth.
[36:35] Right. Amen.
[36:36] We're perfect because we got the new
[36:38] birth. Right.
[36:38] Now, growth development deals more into
[36:42] the word perfection. That's right.
[36:44] All right.
[36:45] But now as I ask the de ask you to give
[36:49] the de I mean to look up these things.
[36:54] Matthew 5:48. Now Joe and him put these
[36:57] in a perfect order for me cuz they
[37:00] realize how much a dummy they're dealing
[37:02] with. So they they do a lot of things
[37:04] for me and uh I appreciate it.
[37:09] So they gave me the scriptures and
[37:10] things and then started giving from that
[37:14] and when I would give the definition of
[37:16] the word they give the scripture it's
[37:17] there. So that's easy for to put it all
[37:20] together.
[37:20] Right?
[37:21] All right. So now watch
[37:24] and follow me down and then we'll get on
[37:26] to finding out. You'll see the
[37:27] difference in perfect and perfection.
[37:34] Perfect
[37:35] is it it just means it's so beautiful.
[37:38] are wonderful, so marvelous, nothing can
[37:40] be added. But perfection is a growth
[37:43] development,
[37:44] right?
[37:45] Which is adding perfect to perfect
[37:49] faith to faith. The Bible says,
[37:51] right?
[37:53] Until you just come out to be faith. All
[37:55] right? So now look, look at the
[37:58] definition in the Old Testament. Job 1
[38:00] and1. There was a man in the land of Oz
[38:02] whose name was Job. And that man was
[38:04] perfect and upright and one that feared
[38:07] God and to shoot evil. All right. So the
[38:09] Hebrew lexican strong concordance 8535
[38:14] said that that word means perfect.
[38:17] Complete.
[38:19] Complete. Perfect.
[38:22] One who lacks nothing in physical
[38:25] strength, beauty etc. It means sound or
[38:29] wholesome.
[38:32] an ordinary quiet sort of of person,
[38:36] complete, morally innocent, having
[38:39] integrity, one who is morally and
[38:43] ethically pure.
[38:45] Right?
[38:46] Uh it picks up just a tad in the word to
[38:50] show you the difference when it comes to
[38:52] to Genesis 6 and9 where it's speaking of
[38:55] Job of Noah. These are the generations
[38:58] of Noah. Noah was a just man and perfect
[39:00] in his generation. And Noah walked
[39:02] before with God.
[39:05] So this definition is taken from 85:49.
[39:09] See, in other words, God's looking down
[39:11] to speak about one.
[39:13] Yeah.
[39:13] And he says it like this. The same word
[39:16] is translated over to speak of another
[39:18] one. But it's it's in here. You know,
[39:24] how many times have you heard me say
[39:26] that? My I preach series on the Godhead
[39:30] that you look over in Genesis 1, it says
[39:34] God created the heavens and the earth,
[39:37] right?
[39:40] But then when you get over about Genesis
[39:41] 2 and 3, it says Lord God.
[39:45] Y
[39:46] all right. That was over when man was
[39:48] created in natural flesh.
[39:51] So it means like Lord God, Jehovah
[39:54] Elohim. See, God is Elohim. Jehovah
[39:56] Elohim did. All right. Jehovah Elohim
[40:00] means God with his family.
[40:02] So when he created Adam, he had somebody
[40:03] to dwell with.
[40:05] So that much difference made him
[40:06] translate.
[40:09] I I don't understand. But maybe a mark
[40:11] goes up this way where the other word a
[40:13] mark goes down this way. You know, but
[40:16] it turns the difference in the word.
[40:19] All right. And that's what I'm trying to
[40:21] give you to help you understand. But
[40:24] here in in in Noah it gives basically
[40:26] the same but listen
[40:29] it comes from 8549
[40:31] which means complete whole entire sound
[40:34] complete whole entire whole sound
[40:37] helpfully
[40:39] helpful excuse me
[40:43] complete entire of time
[40:47] it's a little different sound wholesome
[40:51] unemparded innocent
[40:53] having integrity
[40:55] what is complete
[40:57] entirely in accord with truth and fact.
[41:01] It's a neutral adjustment subject. See?
[41:03] All right. Now, that's the Old Testament
[41:07] definition.
[41:08] Now, look at Matthew 5:48.
[41:13] Be therefore perfect even as your father
[41:14] in heaven is perfect.
[41:15] Amen.
[41:16] is taken from the Greek word which is
[41:20] 5046
[41:22] which means perfect means man means a
[41:26] full age
[41:28] brought to its end
[41:31] remember that word in a minute
[41:34] and go ahead and say it if you listening
[41:37] I thought we believe the seventh seal
[41:38] was the end of all things
[41:39] right
[41:42] I thought we believe the Bible said the
[41:43] end of all things has come upon us Yep.
[41:46] Right.
[41:46] So remember that ending,
[41:51] brought to its end,
[41:54] finished.
[41:55] See, nothing can be added to it. No.
[41:58] Wanting nothing necessary to
[42:01] completeness.
[42:06] Perfect. That which is perfect.
[42:10] consummate human integrity
[42:13] and virtue of men fullgrown adult of
[42:18] full age or mature. Now what's the
[42:21] difference in the Old Testament
[42:22] definition the New Testament? It's the
[42:25] basic same word.
[42:27] It's perfect.
[42:29] Yep.
[42:29] Because there were people back there
[42:31] that were perfect.
[42:33] And there are people down here that are
[42:35] perfect.
[42:37] So you're getting basically the same
[42:38] definition out of the word.
[42:42] Scoffield says you got a Scoffield
[42:44] Bible.
[42:45] He said not sinless perfection.
[42:49] Right?
[42:52] It's not referenced with this word
[42:53] perfect in Matthew 5:48. It's not
[42:56] referencing the sinless perfection,
[42:59] but of growth
[43:03] and maturity.
[43:06] M
[43:07] so he's picking up the understanding
[43:09] from the word perfect
[43:11] that you can't add anything to it
[43:16] cuz nothing can be placed with it.
[43:20] I mean if you got you got something
[43:22] perfect what are you going to have to
[43:24] perfect?
[43:29] If you add one grind to something that's
[43:31] perfect
[43:32] it wasn't perfect before.
[43:33] Okay. But if you take that which is
[43:35] perfect
[43:37] and keep adding perfect to it,
[43:40] right?
[43:40] That's it.
[43:41] Of the same source material.
[43:44] Amen.
[43:45] Then you can keep climbing from faith to
[43:48] faith to faith. You can go faith,
[43:51] virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[43:52] faithlessness, godliness, brotherly
[43:54] kindness, and see that every one of
[43:55] those is God
[44:01] imparting to you.
[44:03] Yep. That's right.
[44:04] Of his own nature.
[44:09] And his nature is what? Perfect.
[44:15] Then watch what we're following.
[44:18] Now
[44:23] go now to
[44:27] Hebrews 6.
[44:34] We got it up.
[44:36] We got Corinthians
[44:41] before then if you want to go with it
[44:43] cuz they both come in together. There's
[44:46] a tiny bit of a difference in the word
[44:48] in the the Greek of perfection for
[44:51] Corinthians than it is
[44:55] to over to what Hebrews is saying. Cuz
[44:58] what's the point? Second Corinthians,
[45:00] bring it up. Okay.
[45:02] Second Corinthians says, "For we are
[45:03] glad,
[45:06] for we are glad when we are weak and you
[45:09] are strong. And this also we wish even
[45:12] your perfection."
[45:16] He's talking to Christians.
[45:21] Is that true? The Bible's written to
[45:23] Christians, not written to people of the
[45:24] world.
[45:25] Amen.
[45:27] He's writing to the saints at Corenth
[45:30] to the Corinthians. So the meaning of it
[45:32] is what? Perfection,
[45:35] a strengthening,
[45:38] perfecting of the soul,
[45:43] a training,
[45:45] disciplining,
[45:47] instructing.
[45:53] to he wishes that for us.
[45:56] Okay. Now Hebrews 6 and1
[45:59] therefore leaving the principles of the
[46:01] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[46:04] perfection
[46:08] not laying again the foundation of
[46:09] repentance from dead works and of faith
[46:12] toward God.
[46:15] Now
[46:16] let us go on to perfection
[46:20] meaning
[46:22] we haven't achieved
[46:25] this.
[46:30] Paul in Corinthians was referring to you
[46:33] know
[46:34] even your perfection that we wish that
[46:37] of you.
[46:39] You know the story of the Corinthians.
[46:41] They were babies,
[46:43] but they were born again Christians.
[46:44] Yep.
[46:45] That's right.
[46:45] But they were babies.
[46:47] Paul had trouble with the Corinthians,
[46:49] right?
[46:50] He even had a man living with his
[46:51] father's wife.
[46:55] But you know what he said? I can't find
[46:57] it. Brother around said that man in
[46:59] second Corinthians wound up being a
[47:00] deacon in the church.
[47:02] I can't find that in the Bible. But
[47:05] that's what he said. So I believe it. He
[47:07] got it somewhere.
[47:10] But see, Paul was telling the
[47:12] Corinthians, I wish
[47:14] you would not just sat down as babies
[47:18] and argue over I'm a Paul. I'm an
[47:21] apostas. I'm a Cus and I'm a this,
[47:25] right?
[47:26] I'm a two soul. I'm a 700 virgin. I'm a
[47:28] bruise. I'm
[47:31] right. Amen.
[47:34] But he wished their perfection,
[47:37] he wished a growth, development,
[47:40] a maturity
[47:42] would come within them.
[47:45] Now look when he gets to to the
[47:46] Corinthians, I mean to the Hebrews
[47:50] a little stronger, could understand a
[47:52] little better. You follow me?
[47:54] Yes.
[47:55] You remember that? You know, one
[47:56] couldn't understand.
[48:00] All right. Now the Greek lexican says
[48:03] that this is number that one for the
[48:05] Corinthians was number 2676 in case
[48:08] somebody on the tape missed it.
[48:11] This is a number 5051.
[48:14] It means finisher,
[48:16] a perfector,
[48:19] one who has in his own person raise
[48:22] faith to its perfection and so set
[48:24] before us the highest example of faith.
[48:29] Now
[48:33] we know that
[48:35] studying I ask you to read the Hebrew
[48:39] book
[48:40] especially chapter 5 67
[48:44] where brother R is explaining all of
[48:46] this about what it means in Hebrews 6.
[48:50] Therefore leaving the principles of the
[48:52] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[48:53] perfection. Well, now it sounds like and
[48:57] even brother Brandon will make the
[48:58] statement that our understanding one
[49:02] God, our doing our water baptisms, our
[49:06] understanding of no eternal judgments, I
[49:08] mean eternal judgment, no eternal hell,
[49:10] right?
[49:12] All of these things
[49:15] he calls them dead reforms or reforms.
[49:21] Now,
[49:24] How can the truth of one God be a
[49:26] reform?
[49:27] Right?
[49:27] What is he meaning?
[49:30] Let him explain yourself.
[49:34] What do you mean?
[49:38] The understanding of the Godhead, is
[49:40] that a reform?
[49:42] The understanding of hell not being
[49:44] eternal, is that a reform?
[49:48] No.
[49:48] That's right.
[49:50] So, he's not saying it like we think.
[49:52] Even though you can quote verbatim,
[49:54] right?
[49:58] He's trying to get us to see Paul is to
[50:01] do like the Corinthians and set down on
[50:04] the little things of the message,
[50:09] little things of the understanding of
[50:11] the Godhead.
[50:13] And forgive me, Lord, for saying little
[50:14] things. I'm trying to illustrate it.
[50:16] Right?
[50:17] Cuz no thing is little thing. That's
[50:19] what I done got to explaining. Perfect
[50:21] is perfect.
[50:22] That's right.
[50:22] If it's a revelation of one God, it's
[50:24] perfect.
[50:25] Right.
[50:26] If it's a revelation of one God.
[50:28] That's right.
[50:28] If it's my idea, it's not perfect.
[50:30] That's right.
[50:33] So Paul is not saying to leave this and
[50:35] get away from it.
[50:36] Right.
[50:36] That's right.
[50:38] I'll give you a quote in a minute where
[50:39] the prophet said, "We're not on the
[50:41] foundation anymore. We're in the
[50:43] tabernacle." Amen. Right.
[50:46] He said Paul was never satisfied with
[50:48] standing in one place.
[50:51] So he wants to go on
[50:54] and you and I today we can make the
[50:57] message carnal reform.
[51:00] That's right.
[51:00] And that's basically what most people
[51:02] has done. They make it an argument
[51:05] debate over one God,
[51:08] an argument debate over hell or over or
[51:11] other things. Because you'd be surprised
[51:13] if people in this message believe we're
[51:14] already in hell.
[51:19] From this message,
[51:25] has the message become carnal reform?
[51:28] That's right.
[51:31] It is not carnal reform to understand
[51:33] one God.
[51:34] That's right.
[51:35] You follow me?
[51:36] It's carnal reform to refuse to go any
[51:39] further.
[51:42] to cabbage down. The prophet said in the
[51:45] seal book. Yep.
[51:48] That's what a Pentecost said, cabbage
[51:50] down.
[51:53] Ain't ding going to hell. They just
[51:55] cabbage down.
[51:56] Right.
[51:57] They just stopped.
[51:59] Paul said to you Corinthians, I wish you
[52:02] could travel on
[52:06] and reach a perfection.
[52:08] Yes.
[52:09] You Hebrews, you understand
[52:12] better than the Corinthians. Y,
[52:16] but let's leave these little things and
[52:19] go on
[52:20] to perfection.
[52:21] Amen.
[52:23] Let's leave these principles,
[52:26] these doctrines,
[52:29] like I've heard people say it, you know,
[52:31] when we understand one God, we preached
[52:33] it, but it's still being revealed to me.
[52:36] That's
[52:36] right. Amen. Right. I don't understand
[52:38] about that because it's still being
[52:40] revealed to me.
[52:41] Now, the principle of the one God,
[52:43] that's right.
[52:44] Yeah,
[52:45] that's right.
[52:45] But you know, the Baptist believe in one
[52:47] God.
[52:48] Sure.
[52:49] But that ain't no principle.
[52:51] That's a carnal reform,
[52:52] right?
[52:55] He said, "No, wait a minute. Not I'm not
[52:57] going off on them. I'm talking I'm
[52:58] telling you where I came from."
[53:01] Baptist doctrine is one God,
[53:04] right?
[53:06] They will argue you to death about it,
[53:10] but then when you question them, they
[53:12] will say it is God in three persons.
[53:15] Blessed Trinity, and that's Trinity just
[53:17] like anybody else's trinity.
[53:19] But yet they won't admit that,
[53:21] right?
[53:23] See, so it's carnal reform
[53:26] letters on a page, whether it be brother
[53:28] Brown's message or this Bible, letters
[53:31] to argue and debate about, and that's
[53:34] all you can do.
[53:36] is to do that.
[53:38] That's carnal reform.
[53:41] I was talking to brother Ernie Villinoea
[53:43] and he said the first time he seen
[53:44] anybody with a computer he went to a
[53:46] Bible to a a
[53:50] ministers meeting
[53:52] and said man they had him around the
[53:54] table got there an hour early and said
[53:55] anything you said they go
[53:58] brother R said
[54:02] and it reminded me of what I've told you
[54:04] many times about the place I went to and
[54:06] was asked to speak and I got up and made
[54:08] the statement and when I made a
[54:09] statement All the computers got to run
[54:11] tonight, can you? They were sitting
[54:12] around the table with their computers
[54:14] shooting me quotes out.
[54:21] I said, "But brothers, what brother said
[54:24] was, thus sayeth the Lord."
[54:29] And they gave him that, but they didn't
[54:31] get that print out.
[54:33] But see, now I'm just I'm not I'm just
[54:35] trying to make an illustration. I'm
[54:37] trying to explain something that is very
[54:39] confusing
[54:41] to the mentality of a human mind.
[54:45] And Paul said, "Leaving the principles
[54:47] of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on
[54:50] to perfection."
[54:52] Does that mean leaving all that he had
[54:54] and getting something new?
[54:58] That's what everybody thinks.
[55:00] Yeah.
[55:01] Boy, when the seal broke, this Bible
[55:04] came brand new.
[55:06] It sure did to a lot of people. They got
[55:07] a whole lot of new doctrines,
[55:12] right?
[55:13] But that wasn't what it meant to me.
[55:19] You can't leave the one doctrine.
[55:23] So Paul is not saying what we think we
[55:25] say by his in his words,
[55:28] right?
[55:28] He's saying let's go on.
[55:31] Right.
[55:34] He even goed on right up to that point.
[55:37] He said, "And this will we do if God
[55:39] permits." Right?
[55:40] All right. Now, like brother Richard
[55:42] Wilson was quoting one day and I like
[55:43] it.
[55:45] He said, you know, Paul didn't go on to
[55:47] that place.
[55:49] Cuz he died.
[55:52] So he never went on to that place. So he
[55:55] said it right. If God permit,
[55:59] you know what? God didn't permit him.
[56:00] Right. Right. But he permits us.
[56:04] That's right.
[56:04] Amen.
[56:05] To have the opportunity
[56:07] to go on to perfection.
[56:08] That's right.
[56:10] To take the 40 years ago of
[56:12] understanding of one God, which was
[56:14] right.
[56:15] Sure.
[56:16] And bring it down to 2011 and talk about
[56:20] one God.
[56:21] Right.
[56:24] I remember when I first saw one God,
[56:28] I saw Jesus Christ was almighty God.
[56:32] Right. That's right.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:34] Come on. He was almighty God. That's
[56:36] right.
[56:37] I told you when I was a Baptist, I had
[56:39] him so much God. I was more wondous than
[56:41] I was. Trinity, I guess, cuz I had him
[56:43] so much God that I didn't believe he
[56:44] could stomp his toe. I give you
[56:45] scripture cuz the Bible said he bury him
[56:47] up lest he dashed his foot against the
[56:50] stone. See, I made him too human. I
[56:53] mean, too God and not enough human.
[56:58] But now I'm trying to divide. Listen.
[57:01] I'm trying to talk about what you first
[57:02] saw.
[57:08] And brother Gary and I were talking one
[57:10] time years ago
[57:12] and he said, "I see God in man."
[57:16] I said, "You can't see him in man till
[57:18] you see him in Jesus."
[57:20] Right?
[57:22] Yeah, but I see him in man. I said, "You
[57:23] can't see him.
[57:26] You first see him in Jesus."
[57:29] All right. When I first started, I saw
[57:30] him in Jesus
[57:32] as one true and living God. But you
[57:35] know, it took years for me to be able to
[57:38] talk about
[57:40] Christ in his church by revelation.
[57:44] I never saw it when I first started. Did
[57:46] you?
[57:47] I don't know.
[57:47] When you first seen it, you seen Jesus
[57:49] Christ as Almighty God. Then you begin
[57:52] to go on to perfection, climbing in
[57:55] understanding. And then you begin to
[57:57] see, hey, that same God is living in me.
[58:00] That's right.
[58:01] And I'm part of him.
[58:02] Right. Amen.
[58:04] A vast difference between the two.
[58:06] That's right.
[58:07] But you know what? Now the one God and I
[58:10] saw, well, it's what? Perfect.
[58:16] But there was just more perfect needed
[58:18] to be added.
[58:19] That's right. Amen. to the perfect.
[58:21] Are you listening?
[58:22] That's right.
[58:23] All right.
[58:25] Maybe I preached long enough until you
[58:26] lost the definition. So, I'll preach a
[58:28] little bit.
[58:31] You said, "Brother D, would you do
[58:32] that?" Yep. I just read you a
[58:35] definition.
[58:36] [Music]
[58:39] And how many of you caught it?
[58:47] Perfect.
[58:52] If we're in Christ Jesus, we're perfect.
[58:54] Right.
[58:55] If Christ is in us by the new birth,
[58:57] we're perfect.
[58:59] But perfection
[59:02] has to do with growth, development.
[59:04] That's right.
[59:05] But it has to do with something else
[59:10] that the people are leaving out.
[59:13] So, pull it back up, brother Joe.
[59:15] Hebrews 6.
[59:26] Therefore, leaving the principles of the
[59:27] doctrine of Christ let us go to
[59:28] perfection, not laying again the
[59:30] foundation of repentance from dead works
[59:32] and faith toward God.
[59:35] Remember
[59:36] the definition of perfect
[59:40] is dealing with perfect man full age
[59:43] brought to its end finished wanting
[59:46] nothing necessary to completeness
[59:47] perfect that which is perfect. All
[59:49] right. But look at the definition
[59:53] of perfection.
[59:56] Has nothing to do with you.
[1:00:01] Perfection has nothing to do with you
[1:00:04] and I.
[1:00:05] That's right.
[1:00:10] Did you catch that when we read it?
[1:00:13] It refers to a perfector.
[1:00:21] It don't refer to me and you.
[1:00:24] Faith refers to you and I because God is
[1:00:26] living in us.
[1:00:27] Amen. But when God comes living in us,
[1:00:29] it have no more reflection to you and I.
[1:00:31] A perfector, one who has in his own
[1:00:34] person.
[1:00:36] Think about Jesus.
[1:00:39] Raise faith to its perfection.
[1:00:44] You know what the Bible says that
[1:00:46] talking to Jesus says being made
[1:00:47] perfect,
[1:00:52] he reached his completeness.
[1:00:54] That's right.
[1:00:56] Right. Right. Right.
[1:00:57] He reached his completeness. He was made
[1:00:59] perfect. He was changed.
[1:01:02] He became the author of them.
[1:01:04] But look, a perfector. One has one who
[1:01:07] has in his own person raised faith to
[1:01:09] its perfection. And so sets before us
[1:01:12] the highest example
[1:01:14] of faith.
[1:01:18] Perfection don't have anything to do
[1:01:20] with you and I.
[1:01:21] That's right.
[1:01:24] perfect really don't because it's him.
[1:01:26] Right. Right.
[1:01:27] But then when he comes and lives in us,
[1:01:30] right?
[1:01:32] It's referencing to the perfector.
[1:01:34] That's right.
[1:01:37] That's the difference between perfect
[1:01:38] and perfection.
[1:01:39] Right.
[1:01:41] Perfection brings you to a completeness,
[1:01:43] sound and done, finished already.
[1:01:46] But completion means the perfector
[1:01:48] himself has come within you
[1:01:53] in this last days through the revealed
[1:01:55] word.
[1:02:00] How is it that I preach to you?
[1:02:03] You get born again at faith. How do you
[1:02:05] get these? How do you get these virtues?
[1:02:09] I just need them. Please tell me how you
[1:02:12] got it. I like them. Yeah.
[1:02:15] When brother Ro preached that 1971-72 I
[1:02:18] asked him that question. I said now how
[1:02:20] can I claim unto these things?
[1:02:25] It was about 1980 when the Lord spoke to
[1:02:27] me.
[1:02:29] And he said only by the word that is
[1:02:32] revealed to you
[1:02:34] can these virtues come into being.
[1:02:37] Amen.
[1:02:38] Into you.
[1:02:39] Amen.
[1:02:42] Right.
[1:02:42] That's right. Right. Right.
[1:02:44] Because it's his faith. It's his virtue.
[1:02:47] It's his knowledge. It's his temperance
[1:02:49] given to you.
[1:02:50] But then when it's given to you, it
[1:02:52] becomes your faith, your virtue, your
[1:02:54] knowledge, your temperance.
[1:02:55] Right.
[1:02:56] Yep.
[1:02:57] Amen.
[1:02:57] You remember what we were bringing out
[1:02:59] there Wednesday night.
[1:03:01] First it was God's talk. It's not word.
[1:03:05] Then it became Moses thought, not word.
[1:03:08] Then Moses spoke it.
[1:03:10] Mhm.
[1:03:11] It became word. Right.
[1:03:13] That's right.
[1:03:15] He traveling going on.
[1:03:20] He is not dealing with
[1:03:25] perfect because you can't add anything
[1:03:27] to it.
[1:03:28] No.
[1:03:28] Right.
[1:03:29] It's dealing with the growth development
[1:03:32] of the word
[1:03:35] and dealing with the perfector himself
[1:03:38] inside of you.
[1:03:40] Right. See,
[1:03:41] the one
[1:03:43] who has in his own person
[1:03:46] able one person ever done that.
[1:03:49] That's right.
[1:03:50] All right.
[1:03:52] Now, follow me then. That was the Lord
[1:03:53] Jesus Christ, right?
[1:03:55] He raised in his faith to perfection so
[1:03:59] that he could bring us an example. Okay.
[1:04:01] Now,
[1:04:04] is that not what happened to the
[1:04:05] prophet?
[1:04:10] Now, he didn't become the perfector.
[1:04:13] No,
[1:04:15] he's not God.
[1:04:16] That's right.
[1:04:16] That's right.
[1:04:17] But he did reach the height and
[1:04:19] development.
[1:04:20] Yes.
[1:04:21] That we could see the maturity.
[1:04:23] Yes.
[1:04:25] And desire and long to be into that.
[1:04:28] That's right.
[1:04:29] But it couldn't have been there unless
[1:04:32] he had a first attained unto it.
[1:04:34] That's right.
[1:04:35] Cuz the Bible says there must be the
[1:04:37] first come to the husband must be first
[1:04:39] partaker of the fruit.
[1:04:42] The brother Random had to be partaker of
[1:04:44] the revelation before he could tell us
[1:04:46] the revelation.
[1:04:51] So then why would we argue about
[1:04:54] the
[1:04:59] Let's do one more.
[1:05:09] All right, let's go pick up the word
[1:05:10] perfection from the Old Testament. Job
[1:05:13] 11:7. Brother Joe,
[1:05:17] brother
[1:05:20] Anderson, I keep calling him Brother
[1:05:22] Joe.
[1:05:24] Look what it says in the Old Testament
[1:05:25] about the word perfection.
[1:05:28] Job 11:7. Can't thou by searching find
[1:05:32] out God? Can't thou find out the
[1:05:34] Almighty unto perfection? In other
[1:05:37] words, can you do it?
[1:05:39] That word means perfection,
[1:05:41] consummation,
[1:05:43] completion
[1:05:45] or completeness. It means end. All
[1:05:48] right. All right.
[1:05:51] Now, this is Old Testament definition.
[1:05:54] Now, here's a New Testament definition.
[1:05:57] Hebrews 7:11.
[1:06:00] If therefore perfection were by the
[1:06:02] Levitical priesthood, look, look at the
[1:06:06] definition of that. Performance,
[1:06:08] perfection, a completing, a perfecting,
[1:06:12] fulfillment, accomplishment, the event
[1:06:14] which verifies the promise.
[1:06:18] Same basic meaning, the old to the new.
[1:06:24] perfection.
[1:06:27] It's dealing with the God that's within
[1:06:30] you,
[1:06:31] right?
[1:06:32] You must have the new birth before you
[1:06:33] can start talking about growth,
[1:06:35] development in the stature of a perfect
[1:06:36] man. That's sensible, isn't it?
[1:06:38] Yes.
[1:06:39] And it takes the opening of the word to
[1:06:41] bring us up to the stature of a perfect
[1:06:43] man.
[1:06:43] Yes.
[1:06:44] It's not because you come into the
[1:06:46] message today and you say, "Well, I need
[1:06:48] I need brotherly kind." Well, I got it.
[1:06:50] I love everybody.
[1:06:53] Just don't cross me.
[1:06:54] Yeah.
[1:06:58] And then when he do say, "Well, that's
[1:06:59] not me. That's my flesh."
[1:07:01] You know,
[1:07:05] but you see,
[1:07:07] perfection
[1:07:10] is dealing with the the perfector
[1:07:12] himself.
[1:07:13] That's true.
[1:07:14] Dwelling in you.
[1:07:15] Yes.
[1:07:16] Whereas perfect is the state the
[1:07:19] perfector has made you in by the new
[1:07:22] birth.
[1:07:23] Amen.
[1:07:24] Are you following it?
[1:07:25] Yes.
[1:07:26] So now you need to take the statue of
[1:07:27] perfect man,
[1:07:29] which we will, the Lord willing,
[1:07:30] Wednesday night, and just go through it.
[1:07:33] Amen.
[1:07:34] All right.
[1:07:36] But remember what I told you
[1:07:39] cuz it bothered me for
[1:07:42] until about 1980.
[1:07:44] You say, "Well, we need, you know, we
[1:07:48] need knowledge." Well, we just study the
[1:07:49] message.
[1:07:52] I read six books, have done it, and
[1:07:54] listened to two tapes in one day.
[1:07:57] Pretty good knowledge,
[1:07:59] right?
[1:08:00] And you know, at that time, I didn't
[1:08:01] even claim the new birth.
[1:08:06] People say, "Brother Dale, you not been
[1:08:08] a quoter." That's what they said when
[1:08:09] the computer came out.
[1:08:12] One brother said to the other one, "Cuz
[1:08:14] a man heard it." He said, "We got the
[1:08:16] computer now. We can quote with brother
[1:08:17] Dale."
[1:08:19] Well, why didn't they read the message?
[1:08:21] Why didn't they study the message?
[1:08:24] If they studied the message, they could
[1:08:25] have quoted women without the computer.
[1:08:28] I didn't need the computer to quote.
[1:08:30] The computer has been a a hindrance to
[1:08:33] me in one form.
[1:08:35] A lot of times I can't find in the
[1:08:37] computer what I'm looking for, right?
[1:08:39] But I got my books up on the wall that
[1:08:41] I've read and I got a decent memory to
[1:08:44] where I could say that's I was out in
[1:08:48] Kansas and I quoted him as in the second
[1:08:50] seal of being in the fourth. So I missed
[1:08:52] two seals. Yeah. Same book,
[1:08:55] right?
[1:09:02] I quoted him something. A lot of times
[1:09:04] I'll go up to the message and say, "God,
[1:09:07] I can't find it, but I know where that's
[1:09:09] in that book." Lay it down, open it up,
[1:09:11] and find out they changed the wording
[1:09:13] just a little bit.
[1:09:15] And they changed the paragraphs just a
[1:09:16] little bit.
[1:09:18] You know what I'm talking about. The old
[1:09:20] seal book,
[1:09:21] you can't read the new seal book. The
[1:09:22] old seal book will take the same page
[1:09:24] numbers. They're not the same.
[1:09:25] That's right.
[1:09:29] But listen folks,
[1:09:32] why haven't we wanted to study the
[1:09:34] message,
[1:09:34] right?
[1:09:36] And why condemn someone who that's all
[1:09:39] they done? Well, you get nothing with
[1:09:41] intellect. Well, all right.
[1:09:44] If I'm just an intellect,
[1:09:48] at least I got the seed planted,
[1:09:50] right?
[1:09:51] Where's your Walmart experience?
[1:09:53] Yeah.
[1:09:53] You said, "Brother D, you're not saying
[1:09:55] that. You know what I'm talking about.
[1:09:57] Instead of spending their time studying
[1:09:59] and praying before God, they're out
[1:10:00] running after all this other stuff,
[1:10:02] right?
[1:10:03] Traveling about preaching instead of
[1:10:05] sitting down listening.
[1:10:09] God, I ain't saying nothing.
[1:10:12] I'm just saying why would you say I'm an
[1:10:14] intellect?
[1:10:16] What's wrong? Is Brother R intellect? If
[1:10:18] I tell you what he said, does that make
[1:10:20] him one?
[1:10:26] That's why it just tears your heart out.
[1:10:28] I quit. I went totally off the field
[1:10:30] years ago in Canada that
[1:10:32] I said I ain't going nowhere else.
[1:10:36] I just it just ripped my heart out
[1:10:40] talking to a man. He said, "Come down
[1:10:41] preach for me." And I said, "Well, tell
[1:10:42] me when." He said, "Well, I want to tell
[1:10:44] you I want two or three weeks where I
[1:10:46] can study before you get there."
[1:10:50] I come home crying. My wife can tell you
[1:10:53] I come home crying about it.
[1:10:56] Oh, you want to study the message before
[1:10:58] I come?
[1:11:00] Is it like brother Brandham that he
[1:11:02] could stand up with his sermon and call
[1:11:03] out your sins
[1:11:05] and the lines would get empty when he
[1:11:06] started calling them out?
[1:11:10] But see, church, I'm trying to depend
[1:11:12] upon the perfector.
[1:11:14] Right. Right.
[1:11:15] To bring me to perfection.
[1:11:17] Amen.
[1:11:19] By the new birth, I'm perfect. Right.
[1:11:23] But I want to go on.
[1:11:25] That's right.
[1:11:26] As Paul said,
[1:11:28] Paul wanted to go on to a change of the
[1:11:30] body.
[1:11:33] He even said it there in the scripture.
[1:11:35] He said, "I might have resurrection from
[1:11:39] among the dead." Paraphrasing close.
[1:11:41] Brother Run said he wanted an out
[1:11:43] resurrection.
[1:11:44] Right.
[1:11:45] He said out from among the doctrines
[1:11:49] around him.
[1:11:50] Right. Right. Right.
[1:11:55] First service we right here in this
[1:11:56] church I preach.
[1:12:00] Let's go on
[1:12:02] going beyond man's camp.
[1:12:06] People have counted down on doctrines
[1:12:07] and ideas. Let's go on church.
[1:12:09] Right.
[1:12:10] For 40 years I've tried to go home
[1:12:13] to get you to see the message.
[1:12:15] Amen.
[1:12:15] Not a six and seven sermon that every
[1:12:17] day you're perfect, you good and this
[1:12:18] that and the other. Then the next day
[1:12:19] tell you ain't worth nothing.
[1:12:24] It's to go on.
[1:12:26] That's right.
[1:12:29] I try to keep something in front of you
[1:12:30] to for you to where it'll it'll
[1:12:32] encourage you to study.
[1:12:34] That's right.
[1:12:36] Encourage you to think on these things.
[1:12:39] Not just saying we're in the message
[1:12:41] that's killing the people.
[1:12:44] How many is it killing you? Right.
[1:12:49] start off a billy full in the morning
[1:12:51] that evening it's flat.
[1:12:53] Yeah.
[1:12:55] Well, brother
[1:12:57] Well, brother.
[1:12:59] Mhm.
[1:13:00] You wouldn't have done it 20 years ago.
[1:13:02] Right.
[1:13:06] Tell me you would
[1:13:09] 20 years ago, you wouldn't miss service
[1:13:10] for nothing. In a lot of them times
[1:13:13] listening to false doctrine.
[1:13:16] Mhm. Right.
[1:13:18] But you had a zeal. Now you've lost your
[1:13:21] zeal.
[1:13:26] Has it been my fault?
[1:13:30] Let's go on to perfection.
[1:13:31] Amen.
[1:13:34] Let's get a few quotes
[1:13:36] from what the prophet had to say.
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:46] This is 1963 318 first seal paragraph
[1:13:50] 79.
[1:13:54] Now watch out. These are the things that
[1:13:57] he's talking about on going to
[1:13:58] perfection.
[1:14:00] If the church had been judged and they
[1:14:02] have judged themselves, if the church
[1:14:05] has been judged and they have judged
[1:14:07] themselves and have accepted the blood,
[1:14:10] how can God judge a man that's perfectly
[1:14:12] totally sinless? You say there's no such
[1:14:15] person ever born again believer. I read
[1:14:17] it this morning, right? True believer is
[1:14:19] perfectly absolutely sinless before God.
[1:14:22] He's not trusting in his works and the
[1:14:24] blood of Jesus Christ that his
[1:14:26] confession dropped into the Bible says.
[1:14:30] He that that is born of God does not
[1:14:32] commit sin, for he cannot sin. How can
[1:14:35] you make a man a sinner when he when the
[1:14:37] bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:14:39] between him and God? That which scatter
[1:14:41] sin till there is there be nothing left
[1:14:43] of it. See, how can that pure blood of
[1:14:47] Christ ever let a sin pice dark? He
[1:14:50] cannot. The prophet on the token
[1:14:52] message, he said he can't impute sin
[1:14:53] over the token.
[1:14:54] All right.
[1:14:57] Jesus said you be therefore perfect
[1:14:59] union as your father in heaven is
[1:15:00] perfect. And how can we even start the
[1:15:02] thought of being perfect? But Jesus
[1:15:04] required it and Jesus required it. He's
[1:15:06] got to make a way for it. He has to he
[1:15:09] and he has his own blood. Now he made a
[1:15:12] way for us to be perfect.
[1:15:15] He's got to make a way for somebody to
[1:15:18] attain
[1:15:20] perfection.
[1:15:22] Amen.
[1:15:24] Are you listening? Yes, sir.
[1:15:26] Did you get the definitions between the
[1:15:28] two words?
[1:15:29] Now, it's reperfection we're talking
[1:15:31] about.
[1:15:32] It's not just getting into the body of
[1:15:34] Christ.
[1:15:35] This is not the age to just become a
[1:15:36] Christian. Now, come on, folks. You got
[1:15:38] to do that to start, right?
[1:15:40] This is the age to come to full
[1:15:42] maturity, adoption, etc.
[1:15:44] Right?
[1:15:45] And where's the preachers preaching it
[1:15:46] to their congregation?
[1:15:48] That's right.
[1:15:53] It's
[1:15:53] up to you.
[1:15:55] Look at the Hebrew book. Hebrews prayer
[1:15:59] 106. Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 number one.
[1:16:02] It's like a one which means there other
[1:16:04] parts of it.
[1:16:06] 5798 the morning service. Let's go on to
[1:16:10] perfection. Oh my. We're coming into the
[1:16:13] tabernacle. Not the foundation. The
[1:16:15] tabernacle. The tabernacle itself.
[1:16:18] That's the foundation of the law and the
[1:16:21] righteousness and and and joining church
[1:16:24] and being baptized and laying on hands.
[1:16:28] Them is all orders of the church. But
[1:16:30] let's go on to perfection. And there's
[1:16:33] only one that is perfected. That's
[1:16:36] Jesus.
[1:16:38] He's the only one perfected.
[1:16:41] Let's go on into Jesus.
[1:16:45] The opening of the word.
[1:16:48] All right.
[1:16:50] Same message. Paragraph 21:14
[1:16:55] talking about Jacob's ladder right up to
[1:16:56] the foot of the cross. They're laying
[1:16:58] down their sins and saying, now this is
[1:17:00] what people we should pray this. Lord,
[1:17:02] it's too much for me. I just can't bear
[1:17:05] it any longer. And will you take away my
[1:17:08] lot of sin
[1:17:10] and take the desire out of my heart to
[1:17:11] do so?
[1:17:13] And let me by faith this day receive you
[1:17:15] as my personal savior. And from hence
[1:17:18] forth I'll follow you every mile of the
[1:17:20] way to the end of the journey. I catch a
[1:17:24] glimpse of what it means to go on to
[1:17:26] perfection. Not going into church and
[1:17:28] the roots of dead works like baptisms
[1:17:31] and so forth. But I want to go on until
[1:17:33] I can be no more and Christ can live in
[1:17:37] me.
[1:17:37] Amen.
[1:17:39] Is that your desire?
[1:17:40] Amen.
[1:17:41] That's what going on to perfection is.
[1:17:44] Taking perfect and going on to more
[1:17:46] perfect. Right.
[1:17:47] Right.
[1:17:48] Right.
[1:17:48] Till you reach perfection.
[1:17:52] Same message.
[1:17:54] No, excuse me. That's number one. That's
[1:17:55] number two. Hebrews chapter 6. Number
[1:17:57] two, paragraph 262
[1:18:00] 5798.
[1:18:02] The evening service.
[1:18:05] He's reading the scriptures, believing
[1:18:06] the principles. Now, we got that this
[1:18:09] morning. How that we are perfected.
[1:18:12] Perfected. absolutely spotless and
[1:18:15] blameless. Not one sin on us. Are you
[1:18:19] above temptation? Never. Do you sin
[1:18:22] every day? Yes, sir. But yet, we are
[1:18:25] perfected because we are in him. And God
[1:18:27] could no more judge us than nothing.
[1:18:31] Couldn't be righteous. He's already
[1:18:33] judged us in him.
[1:18:36] When he judged Christ, he judged me. He
[1:18:38] judged you. and he can't judge me again
[1:18:42] because he took my judgment
[1:18:44] if I've been redeemed. And he talks
[1:18:46] about the ticket in the pawn shop. He
[1:18:48] said, "No, yes, sir. No more judgment.
[1:18:51] He that heareth my words and believeth
[1:18:54] on him that sent me has eternal life and
[1:18:57] shall never come to the judgment, but
[1:18:58] has passed from death unto life." That's
[1:19:00] my ticket. He gave the promise.
[1:19:05] out of that same message, part two
[1:19:06] there. Hebrews chapter 6, paragraph 279.
[1:19:10] Paul said,
[1:19:12] let's go on to perfection. Now, we're
[1:19:15] talking about perfected.
[1:19:19] And if you'll run this down
[1:19:21] now, I may preach on it next, but if
[1:19:24] not, we'll just give it to you. The
[1:19:25] Bible said, "He hath perfected those
[1:19:27] that are sanctified." Right?
[1:19:31] Amen.
[1:19:31] Now, when a man was sanctified, was he
[1:19:33] perfect?
[1:19:35] No. No.
[1:19:37] Wasn't perfect till got new birth.
[1:19:38] That's right.
[1:19:39] So he got me pointing down a second
[1:19:41] stage. His way was bringing out the
[1:19:42] three stages of justification. Three
[1:19:44] stages of sanctification.
[1:19:48] He has perfected those who are
[1:19:49] sanctified.
[1:19:50] He has perfected those who are in the
[1:19:52] body who want to walk after a sanctified
[1:19:55] life.
[1:19:56] Amen.
[1:19:57] Perfected high tense of perfect
[1:20:01] means it's complete and done. Paul said,
[1:20:03] "Let's go on to per let us let's go on
[1:20:08] to perfection." Now, we're talking about
[1:20:10] perfected. And if you run this down,
[1:20:12] you'll find out that perfected is the
[1:20:14] elected. I like that. I'll prove it to
[1:20:18] you in a few minutes by the Bible. It's
[1:20:21] the elected who God before the
[1:20:23] foundation of the world seen every one
[1:20:25] of them. And he sent Jesus to redeem
[1:20:28] that people, not the whole world. He
[1:20:30] wanted to, but he had to make a way for
[1:20:33] those. And the only way he could do was
[1:20:36] to send Christ that he might come the
[1:20:39] perpetuation of our sins that those who
[1:20:42] have been elected, he could bring to him
[1:20:45] in glory. Right
[1:20:47] now listen, he just took a major step in
[1:20:52] going on to perfection
[1:20:57] because he just explained
[1:21:01] in one little paragraph
[1:21:04] how the perfector come to pay our price.
[1:21:09] Come on, read it. He just said it. You
[1:21:11] read it off of there.
[1:21:14] He just brought it to show us the
[1:21:18] perfector made a way.
[1:21:22] Not to just save us.
[1:21:25] Right.
[1:21:26] But to bring us to perfection,
[1:21:28] right?
[1:21:28] Right.
[1:21:31] But how could you teach that to Paul? I
[1:21:33] mean to uh to Luther.
[1:21:37] He was perfect in his revelation.
[1:21:40] But how could you tell him of the
[1:21:42] things?
[1:21:44] He had no way to understand it.
[1:21:47] He didn't have a background of the
[1:21:49] prophet's message.
[1:21:51] Right.
[1:21:51] To understand, but you and I are
[1:21:52] supposed to.
[1:21:53] That's right.
[1:21:54] That's right.
[1:21:57] I explain a lot of things to you that in
[1:22:00] a way it hurts my heart to have to
[1:22:02] explain it.
[1:22:04] But I realize that other people out
[1:22:05] there on the internet are also
[1:22:07] listening.
[1:22:09] Brother Reed said, "Brother Dell,
[1:22:10] remember the people that are listening
[1:22:12] don't have the background your people
[1:22:13] have.
[1:22:14] Don't try to explain yourself."
[1:22:18] I spent a lot of time trying to explain
[1:22:19] it. But come to find out, probably I'm
[1:22:22] explaining it here more than I am
[1:22:24] anywhere else.
[1:22:30] See, I should be able to walk out here
[1:22:32] and say, "Brothers and sisters, I want
[1:22:33] you to realize God just showed me I'm
[1:22:36] perfect.
[1:22:42] I saw him while ago.
[1:22:45] Yeah, Zach could say he whipped me one
[1:22:49] day
[1:22:53] cuz he said that's the only one
[1:22:55] grandkid. I have spanked Hannah, so he's
[1:22:57] not the only one anymore. But one day I
[1:23:00] boy I really hit him so hard until it
[1:23:02] probably dusted the see the end of his
[1:23:04] britches, you know. And
[1:23:08] it hurt his feelings.
[1:23:11] But listen,
[1:23:16] don't you think it's time we go on to
[1:23:17] perfection?
[1:23:19] Amen.
[1:23:20] We studied the one God. We studied the
[1:23:22] water baptism.
[1:23:24] We've looked at these doctrines that
[1:23:26] come around the land and didn't fool
[1:23:27] with them.
[1:23:28] What?
[1:23:30] We studied all of them. The two sold
[1:23:31] seven under Virgin Perusia. I tried to
[1:23:34] study them out.
[1:23:36] Why? Because I wanted to know if it was
[1:23:37] true.
[1:23:40] But I also wanted to know how to tell
[1:23:42] people that it wasn't true.
[1:23:46] But that's dead reform,
[1:23:48] right?
[1:23:49] Cuz all those doctrines are dead.
[1:23:51] Yes.
[1:23:51] I don't care how much I quote the
[1:23:52] prophet. That's right.
[1:23:53] It's dead.
[1:23:56] He said, "Well, you think you're the
[1:23:57] only one that got it?"
[1:23:59] I believe the bride around the world has
[1:24:01] got brother Brandon's ministry. That's
[1:24:03] right.
[1:24:04] Around the world. That's right.
[1:24:06] But I believe it's getting very scarce
[1:24:08] about how many they are.
[1:24:09] That's right. Amen.
[1:24:10] As honest as I can say.
[1:24:12] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:24:13] Sorry. So, if you say you think you're
[1:24:15] the only one, I'm the only one I know.
[1:24:20] That's right.
[1:24:20] Did that get it?
[1:24:23] Cuz I don't know. Wait. All right.
[1:24:28] I believe him.
[1:24:29] I believe he believes everything I say,
[1:24:30] you know, through the message and what,
[1:24:32] but still he can deceive me.
[1:24:36] But I know myself.
[1:24:38] I'm the only person that I know in the
[1:24:40] world that's saved today.
[1:24:44] You know what? You better be able to say
[1:24:47] that
[1:24:48] cuz if not, you're doubting your own
[1:24:50] salvation. If you think somebody else is
[1:24:53] capable of being saved when you're not,
[1:24:56] you're doubting your salvation and you
[1:24:58] don't have it by faith. That's
[1:25:00] right. Amen.
[1:25:01] Is that any problem?
[1:25:04] Just being an honest heart.
[1:25:05] That's right.
[1:25:06] I'm saying thanks. Let's get to the last
[1:25:08] one.
[1:25:11] This is still Hebrews chapter 6 part 2
[1:25:13] paragraph 10301
[1:25:16] 1957 908 the evening service.
[1:25:20] Now he's beginning to talk about what is
[1:25:22] it? Let's go on to perfection. Now he
[1:25:26] said not carnal laying the foundation
[1:25:29] here of doctrines and baptism and
[1:25:31] reformations and so forth.
[1:25:34] Let's not do that. Let's go on to
[1:25:37] perfection. The subject is perfection
[1:25:40] and perfection comes by Christ.
[1:25:44] And how did we get in Christ? By joining
[1:25:47] the church.
[1:25:49] By one spirit we're all baptized into
[1:25:51] one body. Not by one tongue talking in
[1:25:56] one hand shook in one water baptized in
[1:25:59] but by one spirit we're baptized into
[1:26:01] one body. You get it? That's the
[1:26:03] perfection.
[1:26:04] Now let me finish this.
[1:26:08] Brother Brandham when he was preaching
[1:26:09] that in 57
[1:26:13] he knew
[1:26:15] there was more word to come. All right.
[1:26:19] He knew the seals had not been broken.
[1:26:24] He knew those things maybe to partial
[1:26:26] understanding, but he knew
[1:26:29] that there was more to come. He gets up
[1:26:32] to 62 spoken words, original seed.
[1:26:35] Says, "As of yet Malachi 4 is not
[1:26:38] fulfilled
[1:26:41] cuz that's what the Holy Spirit told
[1:26:43] him." That's right.
[1:26:45] The seals broke to the prophet. What did
[1:26:48] he do?
[1:26:48] Yeah.
[1:26:49] He went into perfection.
[1:26:53] I'm getting a pop in the cracking for
[1:26:54] some reason, but it's not.
[1:26:58] The prophet of God went on in through
[1:27:00] the opening of the word, right?
[1:27:05] He went on to perfection.
[1:27:07] That's right.
[1:27:09] He was, as we read, a living example.
[1:27:13] of faith
[1:27:17] for you and I to follow.
[1:27:18] Amen.
[1:27:21] There's many people died, many
[1:27:23] ministers, many great men who have lived
[1:27:25] and walked in the realms of a lot of
[1:27:27] things that died and went on before us
[1:27:29] because they had reached their place,
[1:27:31] right? Amen.
[1:27:34] Their position, their perfection, cuz
[1:27:36] that was as far as they could go.
[1:27:39] See, once Martin Luther had preached the
[1:27:41] just shall live by faith, he had to pass
[1:27:44] off.
[1:27:46] Not immediately, but you know what I'm
[1:27:47] talking about.
[1:27:49] Cuz that was all he was to bring.
[1:27:51] That's right.
[1:27:52] He was not to bring sanctification
[1:27:55] or he would have brought it.
[1:27:57] Now, I'm not saying he didn't preach
[1:27:59] sanctification.
[1:27:59] Sure.
[1:28:02] But see, he had to die and go by the
[1:28:03] grave.
[1:28:04] Right. Our prophet preached those things
[1:28:08] unto us.
[1:28:10] He had to go by the grave.
[1:28:12] Right.
[1:28:13] He's waiting on you and I
[1:28:16] to reach perfection.
[1:28:17] Amen.
[1:28:19] That's right.
[1:28:21] Through the revealed word.
[1:28:22] Right.
[1:28:25] Well, bless God, brother D. I've been in
[1:28:27] the message 40 years. Well, hallelujah.
[1:28:31] How long's the message been in you?
[1:28:33] Amen.
[1:28:35] A lot of differences in two statements.
[1:28:39] That's right.
[1:28:39] But I hope you understand the difference
[1:28:41] in perfect and perfection.
[1:28:43] Perfect is a state that God makes you
[1:28:45] and I by the faith that we have to
[1:28:48] believe that he died in our place
[1:28:50] and gave us the new birth. Right.
[1:28:52] Perfection
[1:28:54] brings to the point then that it
[1:28:56] reflects upon that one that's within us,
[1:29:00] the reflector within us to be able to
[1:29:03] bring into us his nature, his being, his
[1:29:07] word,
[1:29:08] to be able to bring us to perfection.
[1:29:11] Right. Right.
[1:29:15] Then we can walk off the earth. Right.
[1:29:21] You see the difference?
[1:29:22] Yes.
[1:29:27] Christ in you, the hope of glory. I do.
[1:29:32] But what we saw 40 years ago,
[1:29:36] you know what it is? It's partial
[1:29:37] realization.
[1:29:38] That's right. That's right.
[1:29:39] Yep.
[1:29:40] Earnest.
[1:29:41] That's right.
[1:29:42] Foundation.
[1:29:43] Yep.
[1:29:44] Okay.
[1:29:45] Compared to what we see today,
[1:29:47] right?
[1:29:47] Yes.
[1:29:48] Amen. through the opening of the word.
[1:29:50] That's
[1:29:50] right.
[1:29:52] Going on to perfection.
[1:29:53] Amen.
[1:29:55] See, Paul couldn't go on because he had
[1:29:57] to die and go by the grave.
[1:29:58] Yes.
[1:29:59] He went on because he taught deeper
[1:30:01] things. He got into the Hebrews and said
[1:30:03] these things I can't even speak to you
[1:30:04] about. He taught the uh Melchzdc and who
[1:30:08] he was.
[1:30:09] Yeah.
[1:30:09] He taught those things after the Hebrews
[1:30:12] 6 experience
[1:30:15] cuz Hebrews 7:1 right through Lisha 6
[1:30:17] and 7. when he begins to talk of
[1:30:19] mechanic and who he was and the thing he
[1:30:21] went on to great perfection in his day
[1:30:23] to bring those things and went on to
[1:30:25] speak of a say we'd be changed in a
[1:30:28] moment in the twink of an eye that come
[1:30:29] by the revealed word right out of the
[1:30:31] man's heart until he would speak it up
[1:30:33] like I was trying to tell you Wednesday
[1:30:35] Paul caught that thought from God and
[1:30:37] brought it down that we'd be changed in
[1:30:39] a moment in the twinkle of an eye
[1:30:42] but he couldn't attain unto it right so
[1:30:45] we had to go by the grave and wait on
[1:30:46] somebody
[1:30:48] somebody's going to reach perfection.
[1:30:50] Amen. Amen.
[1:30:54] And we're going to walk off this earth.
[1:30:56] Amen.
[1:30:57] You know when I told you 30, 40 years
[1:30:59] ago, there's no reflection wrong.
[1:31:03] I wish to God you'd let me say what I
[1:31:05] say without church.
[1:31:08] I said a lot of us ain't going to be
[1:31:09] able to stand and make the change.
[1:31:11] That's true. the moment the twinkle of
[1:31:13] an eyes my finger the chains the change
[1:31:15] you know they'll go out won't be able to
[1:31:17] make it I may be one of them
[1:31:21] until that time people are going to go
[1:31:23] by the grave
[1:31:25] but somebody's going to stand one day
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:30] and say I am changed
[1:31:32] right that's right
[1:31:33] and they'll be changed
[1:31:35] and you know what if I go by the grave
[1:31:37] that's the guy I'm waiting on
[1:31:38] right lady sister.
[1:31:41] That's right.
[1:31:42] Cuz you sisters have your part,
[1:31:44] right?
[1:31:46] We just going on.
[1:31:48] Been my goal ever since I started here,
[1:31:50] July 4th, 1971, is to go on.
[1:31:53] Go on, not go out after all these
[1:31:56] doctrines.
[1:31:58] But go on in God.
[1:32:00] Amen.
[1:32:01] To where that we can believe the
[1:32:03] prophet's message.
[1:32:05] Somebody's going to be changed.
[1:32:06] Right.
[1:32:07] I just I'm going to believe I'm one of
[1:32:08] them. That's right.
[1:32:11] You know what the prophet said?
[1:32:15] It's not up to you to say, "I believe
[1:32:16] brother Dale's going to make it."
[1:32:20] He said, "You're doubting your own
[1:32:21] experience."
[1:32:22] Right?
[1:32:22] I'm quoting him.
[1:32:23] Paraphrase it. Maybe it's our
[1:32:25] Amen.
[1:32:26] But he said, "You got to say if there's
[1:32:28] anybody in the state of Georgia going,
[1:32:29] right?
[1:32:30] I am the one."
[1:32:32] Amen.
[1:32:33] Brother Dale can tag along,
[1:32:35] but I'm the one.
[1:32:38] You believe it?
[1:32:39] Amen. Amen.
[1:32:41] That's simple, ain't it? Let's stand.
[1:32:43] How much more deeper could you think
[1:32:44] that simple? But you know what? It's so
[1:32:47] simple. It goes over
[1:32:52] because you know what's got to be
[1:32:53] revealed.
[1:32:55] One of these days I'm going to preach on
[1:32:57] why I started this service this
[1:33:00] series.
[1:33:02] Cuz if you can't believe you're just as
[1:33:04] righteous as God is by being in Jesus
[1:33:06] Christ, you're lost. Right. Right.
[1:33:10] Brother Dale, maybe not lost to death,
[1:33:14] but lost in understanding.
[1:33:18] A lot of the Bible is good statements. A
[1:33:20] lot of prophets message is good
[1:33:22] statements.
[1:33:24] What we need is a revelation.
[1:33:28] Amen.
[1:33:29] What do we got?
[1:33:30] 396
[1:33:32] in the red book.
[1:33:33] 396 in the red book.
[1:33:41] You believe it?
[1:33:48] The world
[1:33:50] is
[1:33:52] better.

[1:37:31] 4, behold I send you. They say family.
[1:37:36] Come on. No problem. I'm saying what the
[1:37:40] Bible said. No. He said I said you
