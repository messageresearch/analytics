[6:17] revelations
[6:20] 1
[6:23] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[6:25] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[6:27] things which must shortly come to pass
[6:30] and he sent and signified it by his
[6:32] angel and to his servant john
[6:35] who by record of the word of god and the
[6:37] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[6:39] things that he saw
[6:40] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[6:42] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[6:45] those things which are written therein
[6:47] for the time is
[6:49] at hand time to understand
[6:53] now let's go over to revelations
[6:56] six and we'll read verse seven and eight
[6:58] starting on the fourth seal
[7:01] and when he had opened the fourth seal i
[7:02] heard the voice of the fourth beast say
[7:05] come and see
[7:06] and i looked and behold a pale horse
[7:09] and his name that set on him
[7:11] was death
[7:13] and the hell followed with him
[7:16] power was given unto them over the
[7:18] fourth part of the earth to give the
[7:19] sword
[7:20] and with hunger and with death
[7:23] and with the beast of the earth you may
[7:25] be seated the lord that is blessing to
[7:28] the
[7:28] reading of the word
[7:31] now we've
[7:32] getting on over kind of in our studies
[7:34] and
[7:35] and uh you know talking on these things
[7:38] of the seals and things
[7:41] and just remember now what we've tried
[7:43] to bring and we won't get as much to it
[7:45] tonight but we'll the lord within sunday
[7:48] we will get on to
[7:49] trying to tie together some things but
[7:52] i'm trying to hold a point up for you to
[7:54] remember that
[7:56] uh the the seals
[8:00] they are to israel
[8:03] because they take place between
[8:06] revelation are in revelation 6
[8:09] and then going on into revelations 8 1
[8:11] for the seventh seal
[8:14] the literal things that take place there
[8:16] are to israel
[8:18] right now
[8:19] we don't want to be there when the
[8:22] sixth seal
[8:24] opens right we don't want to be there
[8:26] when the
[8:28] fifth field open we we don't want to be
[8:30] there for these we'll see sunday we
[8:32] certainly don't want to be there in the
[8:33] opening of the fourth seal when it would
[8:35] terminate in armageddon
[8:37] right so then the literal happening of
[8:40] the seals are to israel
[8:43] but the revealed word is to the bride of
[8:45] jesus christ
[8:47] all right
[8:48] now the revealing of the seals the
[8:50] bringing of the seals that's why you'd
[8:52] say well why did it come in our day
[8:54] because it would bring the mystery of
[8:56] redemption that's right amen and see god
[8:58] sent us a prophet as we'll get back to
[9:00] the end of the message this evening lord
[9:02] willing he sent us a prophet that we
[9:04] would be able to see what these
[9:06] mysteries are
[9:08] to be able to read them and
[9:12] the seals as we'll read one in a minute
[9:13] the probably said it shows what has been
[9:15] what is and what will be to come you
[9:17] know
[9:18] all right then
[9:20] we've studied so far and found out these
[9:22] seals even started back in genesis
[9:25] and worked their way all the way through
[9:27] the bible
[9:28] but the reality of those things the
[9:30] things that that you know the bringing
[9:33] forth of the things that we read under
[9:36] this
[9:36] is coming on over after we get out of
[9:39] here
[9:40] and it will be to israel
[9:44] but what a wonderful thing to be able to
[9:46] stand here and see it
[9:48] before it takes place that's right
[9:51] what about a people that we can stand
[9:53] here
[9:54] in the because of the message of the
[9:57] hour we can go all the way back to
[9:59] genesis
[10:01] and we can see what happened there all
[10:04] right amen we can come all the way
[10:05] through
[10:07] and see what's taking place
[10:09] and we can even go on past our time
[10:14] and see what will happen to israel right
[10:17] and go on to seeing the millennium and
[10:19] how it'll take place
[10:22] and seeing the future home and
[10:24] all of those things while we're still
[10:26] here on earth amen
[10:29] there's a lot of these things that we're
[10:30] speaking of see will be after we get out
[10:33] of here
[10:35] but we can see them while we're here
[10:38] i mean that's that's the part i've been
[10:39] trying to get across to you
[10:41] it's just it's been with me for 40 about
[10:44] 40 years and i've been trying to make
[10:46] that statement
[10:47] and it seems so hard for people because
[10:49] they'll say but but but brother dale i
[10:52] thought we got the seals we do by
[10:54] revelation
[10:55] we get the revelation of the word of god
[10:57] we don't get to tribulation right right
[10:59] right
[11:01] we don't go to the tribulation right but
[11:03] we know that what will take place right
[11:07] because it's been made known to us by
[11:10] the end time profit and that's what we
[11:12] want to we'll get down to the end in a
[11:14] little bit uh of understanding to see
[11:17] the point
[11:18] but
[11:19] we look at it and see the opening of the
[11:21] word
[11:24] right the word being open to you and i
[11:26] am
[11:28] and and
[11:30] you know that that to me is a wonderful
[11:31] thing when we i was talking with
[11:33] somebody there the other day
[11:35] and
[11:36] you know i told them i said you know
[11:38] it's so amazing how the bible is written
[11:41] amen
[11:42] you know it's written for every age
[11:45] that would ever be in the world
[11:48] martin luther could read
[11:50] the bible
[11:52] and he would understand things for his
[11:54] day and time
[11:56] right
[11:57] but he wouldn't understand what we
[11:58] understand
[12:00] but we better not come up with
[12:02] understanding something he didn't
[12:04] understand you know what i mean by the
[12:07] hat you know
[12:08] in other words he'd understand something
[12:10] and then we'd understand something
[12:11] entirely different
[12:12] then we're not talking about the things
[12:14] of his natural life and and the doings
[12:16] that he done we're talking about the
[12:18] message he brought
[12:20] the message of the just shall live by
[12:22] faith
[12:23] that is actually those
[12:24] who learn in revelations the the uh
[12:28] three angels coming across
[12:31] he's bringing it forth as the message
[12:32] upon the earth
[12:34] and what about a wonderful thing that we
[12:36] can stand here and agree with what
[12:38] martin luther said about the just shall
[12:40] live by faith right that's right
[12:42] and we don't have to deny that and we
[12:45] don't have to say as a lot of people in
[12:46] the message say well luther and western
[12:48] them didn't have nothing
[12:50] but if they didn't have nothing then we
[12:51] sure were what are we standing on
[12:54] you know right
[12:55] i mean but the bible is so beautiful and
[12:58] perfect
[12:59] but here we stand in the middle of it
[13:01] being the bride of jesus christ and can
[13:03] understand the whole the whole word of
[13:05] god all the way from the beginning to
[13:07] the ending that's right while we're
[13:09] still here
[13:10] and you know what that's going to do
[13:12] that in itself is going to change you
[13:15] and i
[13:16] to take us out of here
[13:19] see that's why it couldn't happen until
[13:21] the end time that's right
[13:23] we'll read in a minute we read ears
[13:25] about you know his name that said on him
[13:27] was death
[13:29] we'll see
[13:31] the prophet said even to the the line
[13:34] the ox the man even in those days they
[13:37] didn't understand it was dead
[13:39] right
[13:40] but he said it was death from the
[13:41] beginning
[13:42] right right
[13:44] it was death from the beginning
[13:46] but you see it's in the deception and
[13:48] that's what i want us not to do is to be
[13:51] deceived
[13:52] you know
[13:53] and get caught up in the deception of
[13:55] things and just kind of you know well
[13:58] brother dale that he he keeps on about
[14:00] the seals is the israel i've heard all
[14:03] my life they was to the bride well they
[14:05] are
[14:08] the revelation of it is to you and i
[14:14] we we even understand why throwing
[14:16] judgment you certainly don't want to go
[14:17] there do you no
[14:20] but we understand it
[14:22] well because it's been told to us
[14:25] through the opening of the word
[14:28] we see just get the point now of what
[14:30] we've been trying to say
[14:32] and we've been studying up through here
[14:34] and taking
[14:35] that
[14:36] it was the same rider on each one of the
[14:39] horses
[14:41] he changed but the writer the horse
[14:44] changed colors
[14:45] you know
[14:46] representing what would be in that time
[14:50] but it's the same writer
[14:52] the same devil
[14:56] being exposed
[14:59] by the word
[15:02] now i know people don't like me the way
[15:04] i talk but just get what i'm saying and
[15:06] you'll understand it the bible's not
[15:08] revealing the devil
[15:10] that's all right it's revealing jesus
[15:13] christ we just we've read that 37 times
[15:17] because this is the 37th message that
[15:19] i've read revelations 1 1-3 that's the
[15:23] revelation of jesus
[15:24] christ the bible is revealing jesus
[15:27] christ but by revealing christ to you
[15:30] and i it's exposing satan
[15:35] in his tactics and his ways
[15:38] so it's not revealing him
[15:42] he's not something that can be revealed
[15:45] god can be revealed but satan
[15:48] will one day become extinct
[15:50] and totally annihilated yes sir
[15:53] you agree with that the bible says he
[15:54] will
[15:55] well if that's true then how could it be
[15:57] a revelation
[16:00] the revelation of jesus christ is never
[16:02] ending
[16:05] it's exposing satan
[16:08] for what he is
[16:10] and the way he's deceived the people and
[16:13] you remember what we're bringing out
[16:16] sunday
[16:18] that white horse
[16:20] right
[16:25] it didn't just blow up and go out of
[16:27] existence
[16:29] get right on going right yes
[16:32] he got off and got on another horse
[16:34] ready
[16:35] he rode that horse through the bloodline
[16:38] got off to get on the black that red
[16:39] horse is just going right on through
[16:43] the black horse goes right on through
[16:45] and you'll see the reason that that i
[16:47] keep saying that because if that was not
[16:50] sold how would you wind up with the pale
[16:52] horse right
[16:55] because the pale horse
[16:57] would be the white the red the black all
[17:00] mixed together
[17:04] which is governmental powers religious
[17:07] powers and demon powers
[17:11] all mixed together and come out as a
[17:13] pale horse right i was thinking about
[17:16] that the other day and this i'll get
[17:18] back into the message with
[17:21] but we can see the red the black in the
[17:23] things you know the red being the blood
[17:25] and all of the killings and
[17:27] the 68 million being killed you know
[17:30] and more of that
[17:32] but didn't see the black horse to be the
[17:34] dark ages
[17:36] as it come down through you know
[17:38] in time the thousand years of
[17:40] where the the catholics ruled the world
[17:43] all right
[17:46] but then the thing about a pale horse
[17:51] why would it be in symbolic of a pale
[17:54] horse
[17:58] that gives us something to think about
[18:02] a pale horse
[18:04] yeah you say well you mix the white the
[18:06] red the black and you get pale okay all
[18:08] right
[18:12] you mix all of his powers together and
[18:14] you come out
[18:19] but i think it's got a whole lot of
[18:20] deeper meaning to it
[18:25] i believe it's pale because
[18:30] god is going to let us know how it's
[18:32] destroyed
[18:36] this beast
[18:38] will be destroyed
[18:41] this
[18:42] pale horse
[18:44] will be destroyed
[18:46] this system will eventually be destroyed
[18:49] that's right it was not destroyed down
[18:51] through time
[18:56] but it will be destroyed
[18:58] so it's not just stopping on a symbol of
[19:01] a
[19:02] killings or a dark age
[19:10] it's the payloads
[19:12] sickly
[19:15] pale horse
[19:20] it's death
[19:22] right because we'll get to it in a
[19:23] minute
[19:25] but you know
[19:26] death one day
[19:29] will be annihilated
[19:32] yes sir for everybody
[19:37] that's why it's pale
[19:39] i pray another day about i thought lord
[19:41] and i know the symbols and the things
[19:43] the prophet said but that's praying lord
[19:46] why did it wind up a pale
[19:48] i can understand the mixture of the
[19:51] the white the red pack you know and get
[19:54] your colors and whatever you want
[19:56] but
[19:59] why would it wind up paying the lord
[20:03] because you see he's going to destroy
[20:06] this seal is going to show us
[20:09] death
[20:10] right destroyed amen
[20:14] okay
[20:16] so now that's what i'm trying to get to
[20:18] so that maybe make you interested in
[20:20] listening for a while
[20:22] and read what the prophet has to say
[20:25] upon these things
[20:26] now i keep giving this quote back to you
[20:30] go ahead with number one brother
[20:33] anderson
[20:37] i keep bringing this one back because of
[20:39] the purpose that i want
[20:41] to be brought
[20:45] god's mathematics is three
[20:47] but satan's mathematics is four
[20:51] all right
[20:53] so what is he
[20:55] first antichrist white
[20:58] second false prophet red
[21:01] of heaven and earth in purgatory which
[21:03] is black
[21:04] and fourth
[21:05] the beast
[21:07] the pale horse
[21:10] and notice what he says
[21:14] this is the end of the message and i
[21:15] know this will probably be
[21:17] sunday morning but
[21:20] look what he says when he gets to the
[21:21] pale horse
[21:23] if you think we're going to be over
[21:24] there when the seals break you better
[21:26] start reading a lot right
[21:28] if you remember the daniel 70 weeks
[21:30] brother brown said you will miss the
[21:32] seals you'll miss the red dragon you'll
[21:35] miss the casting out and all of the
[21:37] things you'll miss revelations 12.
[21:43] so look what he says
[21:46] satan being kicked out of heaven
[21:50] amen
[21:56] now he goes into the fourth seal
[21:59] satan b-e-i-n-g
[22:04] right being kicked out of heaven right
[22:09] now we get over after a while in the
[22:10] message and read it
[22:13] we go up he comes down right
[22:16] amen
[22:20] we don't want to be there when that
[22:21] beast takes place
[22:23] but we are we've done this the rapture
[22:25] we're in the tribulation period
[22:28] and that's what i've tried to prove to
[22:29] you to show you
[22:33] then if we get time we'll get this
[22:34] scripture
[22:36] revelation 13.
[22:40] but notice when read around with
[22:41] bringing down the the course of the
[22:43] horses when it comes to the fourth
[22:46] the beast the pale horse
[22:48] satan being kicked out of heaven
[22:56] now what causes him to be kicked out of
[22:58] heaven
[23:05] okay
[23:06] so i said you might be interested to
[23:08] keep reading these things and when i
[23:10] keep bringing a quote over and over and
[23:12] over again you better believe that it's
[23:15] got a purpose behind it
[23:17] all right
[23:18] so i keep reading those things and i
[23:20] would go if i were you and i would read
[23:22] if if i don't get to it tonight i would
[23:24] read revelations the 12th chapter
[23:28] and he gives the 13th verse
[23:31] satan being kicked out of heaven
[23:34] then in
[23:35] 13 1-8
[23:37] he is incarnate in the person of the
[23:39] beast
[23:41] all right
[23:42] when he's kicked out of heaven
[23:44] you remember what i've always told you
[23:49] you can't be the beast until we get out
[23:51] of here that's right right
[23:54] that's right you can't be the beast
[23:55] until you and i leave
[23:59] so maybe it'll start dawning on you that
[24:02] the singles and the literal happening
[24:05] when he's kicked out of heaven we better
[24:07] be the reason he's kicked out
[24:09] right right now
[24:13] because he's kicked out as we go up
[24:16] he is right
[24:18] what a wonderful thing to think about
[24:21] i didn't mean to go this way but that's
[24:22] all right
[24:26] god will allow him to come up there
[24:30] and talk with him
[24:32] right come on
[24:34] that's right
[24:36] he was talking to him in the book of job
[24:39] where have you been they should walk
[24:41] into and from the earth
[24:44] you got an audience with god
[24:48] would you show me where he's ever back
[24:50] in heaven when the bride gets tired
[24:56] so i begin to believe
[24:59] if i was you
[25:01] that maybe
[25:03] she might be
[25:07] and have a part
[25:11] of kicking him out
[25:13] sure
[25:18] i'd consider that point
[25:23] and let that ponder in your mind
[25:25] cause that's the way i do if you wonder
[25:27] how i get things or what comes
[25:29] you know i'll wake up in the night and
[25:30] i'll just be praying and laying there
[25:35] you know i'm just like everybody else
[25:37] and say well lord
[25:39] why is it a pale lord i can understand
[25:42] the white the black
[25:44] i'm the one the red the black
[25:47] but why don't you turn out to be a green
[25:48] or a purple or
[25:50] a yellow or something
[25:59] you're gonna find out we got something
[26:00] to do with this
[26:06] we got something to do with this
[26:08] just don't put us there when the thing
[26:10] starts taking place
[26:12] we're going to be in heaven when
[26:13] armageddon strikes here on earth
[26:17] if we're not in heaven when that happens
[26:19] you better believe you better find you a
[26:21] place to hide and hurry
[26:24] and it won't do you any good that's
[26:26] right that's right
[26:31] back on these things
[26:33] go ahead with number two
[26:37] we've used this a few times
[26:39] i want you to get the point paragraph
[26:41] 194.
[26:43] so i keep giving these backgrounds if
[26:44] you notice a lot of the sc folks
[26:47] the people are out there on the internet
[26:48] they they made some of them don't even
[26:50] have the books
[26:53] you know
[26:55] and brother reed told me years ago he
[26:57] said brother dale remember those people
[26:59] out there don't know what you all know
[27:02] try to back up and cover as much as you
[27:04] can he said i know it's hard to do but
[27:08] because they're watching
[27:10] and then when we get reports like i did
[27:12] the other day from that sister that she
[27:14] just took the message and just tied it
[27:16] together from some of the sermons i'd
[27:18] preached and brought it right down to
[27:19] what i'm talking about
[27:23] maybe she don't sleep
[27:24] you know whatever
[27:29] but listen
[27:32] watch rides a pale horse
[27:35] hurt 194 to four seal
[27:37] on his ride
[27:40] this last ride now there's not another
[27:43] right beast
[27:46] in the field sixth and seventh
[27:48] and there's not another combat beast
[27:53] in the fifth sixth and seventh amen now
[27:56] i'm not saying he won't satan won't be
[27:58] there because he's gonna be in a
[27:59] tribulation to be wiped out and all that
[28:01] i'm just saying there's not another
[28:03] form
[28:04] death is the highest you can go
[28:09] there is no other place to go
[28:13] death is it
[28:14] right there's no court of appeal after
[28:17] death i'm talking about the death of the
[28:19] soul
[28:24] to this right he's on his life right
[28:27] now this is not an hour day
[28:31] that will be on down right
[28:34] it's the seal foretold
[28:38] i'll get to that loading about sunday
[28:41] sometime
[28:43] coach see the church has done gone up
[28:46] when this happens
[28:48] amen
[28:49] and when he becomes the beast
[28:55] the church is done gone
[28:57] well okay now brother dale i agree with
[28:59] you on four five six seven five six film
[29:02] but we're here when the first
[29:08] the seal started in genesis
[29:13] come on and work this way all the way
[29:14] down through
[29:18] and it didn't start in the first church
[29:20] age it started in genesis
[29:21] right where i've been through it with
[29:23] cain and abel and the things
[29:25] prophets told us that the seven seals
[29:28] even spoke up from genesis
[29:31] as it's coming down right
[29:35] and you'll see all of these things as
[29:37] they're taking place
[29:39] is the seal foretold
[29:42] amen
[29:45] but but but i just don't understand
[29:47] because
[29:49] you always and we will read some more
[29:51] work the prophet said we go up
[29:52] revelation 4 1 not single 19 21
[29:56] what about revelation 10
[29:58] well what about it
[30:02] we don't have to be over there
[30:06] well revelation 10 you know in the days
[30:09] of the voice of the seventh day yeah and
[30:10] that's the
[30:12] seventh angel is the
[30:14] church age messenger to revelation 3 14.
[30:21] come on right seventh church aids
[30:23] messenger
[30:27] it's just like i've tried to tell you
[30:29] john's up here seeing all this he's
[30:30] writing it he's told to send it to the
[30:32] church read chapter one
[30:36] he's told to send it to the church right
[30:38] that's right
[30:39] he gets over to where he's at into
[30:41] revelations 10
[30:44] and he's wondering how to work and i get
[30:45] this back to the church
[30:49] that's the key that's why i said it
[30:51] i've checked all of the translations as
[30:53] much as i've got a 26 to see if there
[30:56] was any you know discrepancy partner
[31:02] said but in the days of the voice of the
[31:04] seventh angel you look right back over
[31:06] and said
[31:07] seventh church agent saw that that would
[31:09] be a prophet
[31:11] that would come and get the word
[31:13] so he rejoices now everything's okay
[31:16] he can write all he wants to
[31:21] see that's what people they don't even
[31:23] think that's right
[31:26] right now we don't have no rights
[31:29] they're going to be christians we
[31:30] forfeited all of them right
[31:32] that's right we have no rights
[31:36] we gave up all of our rights
[31:38] to become christians
[31:40] well
[31:41] i'll tell you what i'm i'm just gonna
[31:44] believe what i want to believe well
[31:45] that's good for you go right here
[31:49] that's word that the people that don't
[31:51] get it you've done been told over and
[31:53] over you can goof off and play around
[31:55] and not believe it
[31:57] and you're going by the grave i'm not
[31:58] de-christianizing you say you're lost
[32:00] i'm just saying you're going by the
[32:02] grave i'll get to do your funeral or
[32:04] somebody will
[32:06] and i may be one of them
[32:08] but somebody will do mine
[32:14] because it's going to take somebody to
[32:15] stand there
[32:16] that's right
[32:20] and see death
[32:22] destroyed
[32:24] remote back by 19 and
[32:29] 60 what
[32:31] nah moving on about 70 anyway he made a
[32:34] statement he said brother dale we need
[32:36] to find out what death is
[32:39] because the only way you can destroy it
[32:41] to find out what it is
[32:43] that's right
[32:44] you know
[32:46] i mean you come up with a disease if
[32:48] they can't figure that disease out and
[32:50] find out what it is
[32:51] they can't hope and have any hopes of
[32:53] getting an antibiotic you know or
[32:56] antidote or whatever
[32:58] to
[32:59] right be able to conquer that
[33:02] right
[33:04] see church it's the day in the hour that
[33:06] we're living that we're wanting to go so
[33:09] fast
[33:10] and that's what everybody in the message
[33:12] want they want something new something
[33:13] every new thing that comes along they
[33:15] want to grab it and run with it
[33:18] well after a while it just runs down
[33:19] right right
[33:23] but somewhere there's a little bride
[33:25] just just
[33:28] taking it day by day and saying don't
[33:30] worry about it right
[33:33] you mean you're not worried brother
[33:34] they're worried yes because of us as
[33:36] human beings yeah
[33:40] we're worried about whether god will
[33:42] keep his word or not
[33:43] oh come on right amen
[33:46] i mean
[33:48] what we've seen in our day and then
[33:50] worry about whether god's going to keep
[33:52] his word
[33:54] right i'm only something wrong with your
[33:56] mentality
[33:58] revelation that's right
[34:00] he will keep his word
[34:03] even said he would send the headstone
[34:05] not upon our merits yeah right
[34:10] that's right
[34:11] but because he promised it right right
[34:17] oh but we're just gonna get goody-goody
[34:19] and get good goodies we go to goody
[34:20] goody until one day we're going goody
[34:22] writing rapture
[34:24] well keep good and all you want to do
[34:30] there's gonna be somebody that stands on
[34:31] the word we'll see death destroyed
[34:35] and you're going to have to be able to
[34:36] laugh at it
[34:39] while it's taking you
[34:44] and carrying you down
[34:48] you know getting old you know what i
[34:49] mean great higher right old age you know
[34:54] right
[34:55] i can well remember when i had a lot
[34:57] darker hair and a lot more of it and a
[34:59] lot of you had some real blackheart
[35:03] see that's death right
[35:06] that's right
[35:08] we're gonna find out what death is one
[35:10] day
[35:12] and it will be annihilated
[35:15] well i know what death is your heart
[35:17] quits beating
[35:19] your heart quits beating that just
[35:21] starts you over on the other side
[35:25] right
[35:27] death is the death of the soul all right
[35:32] that's what i'm trying to get us to see
[35:34] these seals is revealing death
[35:38] but why is it doing it by revealing life
[35:47] life is being revealed you know life
[35:50] you know the internet out there i got my
[35:51] southern way l-i-f-e you know i can't
[35:53] help it
[35:54] and i ain't gonna change it why because
[35:56] i can't go to school and learn how to
[35:58] talk properly
[36:00] so get you a dictionary and an old
[36:02] southern one and if not rightly and i'll
[36:05] tell you what i mean l-i-f-e
[36:08] life is what destroys death right right
[36:12] yes sir the only thing that can
[36:16] the revealed word is you don't think
[36:17] destroy death
[36:19] all right watch as we get on into it but
[36:21] what did we read there he said
[36:23] this rider rides on down he's on his
[36:26] lights right now the beast
[36:29] you know
[36:30] the pale horse
[36:32] and he says now that is not in our day
[36:35] that's right
[36:37] that will be on down
[36:39] it's the seal foretold
[36:42] because see the church
[36:44] has done gone up
[36:46] when this happens
[36:52] watch it now paragraph 202 number three
[36:55] on your notes
[36:57] the second seal look what it says
[37:01] but now in the age after the church goes
[37:04] home
[37:07] he becomes a beast
[37:10] he becomes the devil incarnate
[37:16] revelations 12 13 through there the red
[37:19] dragon himself
[37:21] oh my
[37:22] can't you see what i mean
[37:24] he's incarnate in his people then
[37:26] he's got his people bound by his power
[37:29] the false prophet has prophesied
[37:33] them right into it give them over to
[37:36] strong delusions to believe a lie and be
[37:39] down by it
[37:42] now what does he call believing a lie
[37:43] being damned by
[37:45] denying the word
[37:48] with a form of godliness right right
[37:52] you know that's that that's what's all
[37:53] in churches out there they got i
[37:55] wouldn't go that far
[37:58] stick around a little closer if i just
[38:02] you said they're denying the word no
[38:05] they ain't even never heard it right
[38:09] but look what he says
[38:13] the devil just in a time
[38:16] after christ no satan
[38:19] incarnates himself
[38:23] a type
[38:24] after christ not a type of christ
[38:28] happen after christ
[38:32] following christ
[38:36] if you look back above it you'll see
[38:37] what the key of the whole thing god
[38:39] works his place in the trinity
[38:40] justification incarnate himself in the
[38:43] people with the baptism of the holy
[38:44] ghost
[38:48] when that is fully completed we become
[38:50] the word make flesh
[38:52] and walk off of this earth because of
[38:54] that
[38:55] satan can become the beast
[38:58] because he doesn't know how to do it now
[39:00] right
[39:02] he watches god
[39:05] and followers live stream
[39:09] he doesn't run before he follows live
[39:11] stream who wants
[39:14] so what does it do now
[39:18] look at the next one
[39:22] people would wonder you know i keep
[39:24] reading a lot of these things and you
[39:25] wonder a lot
[39:26] but as it dawned on you yet
[39:30] the reason we go up
[39:35] is we're not going to go through the
[39:36] tribulation that's right
[39:40] that's simple but my language didn't it
[39:44] i have 164 questions and answers
[39:47] i'm 62 now watch it
[39:49] 0 5 27 62.
[39:52] now someone wrote me here not long ago
[39:54] and asked and he said
[39:56] if you do not believe that the church
[39:58] goes through the tribulation period
[40:01] how about revelations 13
[40:04] how they overcome by the blood of the
[40:06] lamb
[40:07] and their testimony
[40:09] i'm like hey brother around the
[40:10] scripture
[40:12] it looks like it
[40:14] looks like the church is gonna have to
[40:16] go through
[40:18] to be able to be overcome by the blood
[40:19] of the lamb
[40:22] but
[40:22] remember israel must overcome by the
[40:26] blood of the lamb
[40:29] even though she's in the tribulation
[40:31] right but
[40:33] the person asked that question i wonder
[40:35] do you realize that the first three
[40:36] chapters of revelation deals with the
[40:38] church in the church age
[40:41] that's the tribulation period
[40:44] now he's going back up here to answer
[40:46] this right
[40:47] that's the tribulation period not the
[40:49] church age
[40:50] the church raptures and goes up at the
[40:52] fourth chapter of revelation never comes
[40:54] back again until the 19th chapter when
[40:56] it comes with jesus that's right that's
[40:59] in the tribulation period not nothing to
[41:02] do with the church at all
[41:05] after we leave out of here this thing
[41:06] goes into the tribulation period
[41:08] right right
[41:10] okay
[41:12] i'm going to the next
[41:17] this is the feast of the trophies
[41:18] paragraph 36
[41:21] the three chapter first three chapters
[41:22] in the book of revelation revealed all
[41:24] the happenings unto the church
[41:26] then from the third chapter unto the
[41:27] 19th chapter of revelation there is no
[41:29] more scene in the church
[41:31] the church goes up at the fourth chapter
[41:32] of revelation and returns back at the
[41:35] 19th chapter of revelation the bride and
[41:38] the groom together coming to the earth
[41:40] then from that 19th chapter to the
[41:42] conclusion of the 22nd chapter it's all
[41:46] on the millennium and what will be in
[41:48] the year that is to follow during the
[41:50] 4th of the 19th god is dealing with
[41:53] israel is that enough
[41:56] that's right
[41:57] 4 to the 19th god's dealing with israel
[42:02] yep well what about the fifth foot
[42:04] remember the fifth chapter is in heaven
[42:07] after the rapture
[42:09] while israel is getting the tribulation
[42:16] i just got through preaching on it right
[42:18] sure
[42:19] look at the next one
[42:22] i grab 87 on the fifth seal
[42:25] but the reason it reveals it and i
[42:27] understand that it is because the
[42:28] mystery of the book of redemption
[42:30] as far as the antichrist being revealed
[42:33] notice where does that feel sealed right
[42:36] and at the same time the church is gone
[42:39] and these things don't even happen in
[42:40] the church age at all that's right
[42:43] they're away from the church age the
[42:45] church absolutely is raptured at this
[42:47] time
[42:48] the church goes up in the fourth chapter
[42:50] of revelation and does not return until
[42:52] it comes back with the king in the 19th
[42:54] chapter
[42:55] but these seals here are revealing what
[42:58] has been
[43:00] what is
[43:02] and what will be
[43:04] from genesis to revelation
[43:07] we're going to get to it the minute
[43:08] where the prophet was coming back to
[43:10] preach on what
[43:13] the trail of the serpent
[43:15] the beast at the beginning and the beast
[43:17] at the end
[43:20] you saw it the bible called it a beast
[43:22] didn't it right
[43:24] his he called that back in the garden
[43:26] the beast
[43:30] seeing that was to be for the church he
[43:32] was revealed by these seals and now
[43:34] watch what takes it see the church age
[43:37] was revealed by the scene
[43:40] but we're not dire
[43:42] the seals are going to israel right
[43:45] now
[43:47] i got the one in here with bro around
[43:48] there asking a question this is the
[43:50] first sealed first thessalonians
[43:54] said yes
[43:55] many times right on over to the last day
[44:01] but church are you listening
[44:07] see then that puts it to work we don't
[44:10] have to go through the triple s
[44:12] right
[44:13] right
[44:15] we're the bride of christ
[44:17] we get the revelation of everything
[44:20] we don't have to go through the
[44:21] tribulation
[44:27] so watch what takes place now go ahead
[44:29] number four
[44:32] you notice there was three a b and c
[44:37] so let's take on it now what's he
[44:38] talking this is back in the second seal
[44:43] now the first he become an antichrist
[44:45] and it couldn't be antichrist only in
[44:47] spirit
[44:48] you become an antichrist in that
[44:49] spiritual command that taught the same
[44:51] thing that the antichrist spirit was
[44:52] doing and then you become a false
[44:54] prophet to the antichrist spirit
[44:56] now what about a man in an organization
[44:59] that's what you said
[45:00] i don't know what you think about it but
[45:03] all right
[45:07] can i inject one right there and that
[45:08] word organization can be in the people
[45:11] around this message
[45:13] right
[45:14] okay
[45:18] said if your pastor won't stay with a
[45:19] word
[45:20] get away from your pastor
[45:23] that's his words you need it right
[45:26] of course busting up churches brother
[45:28] dale
[45:30] nope right
[45:32] doing it like it is amen
[45:35] god's the one that's doing the busting
[45:37] look now finally he becomes a beast
[45:40] now wait
[45:41] we'll get into that after a while see
[45:43] all right and if satan's trinity lace
[45:46] like that satan all the time
[45:49] that's the point when you get satan all
[45:50] the time satan
[45:52] antichrist spirit
[45:54] satan
[45:56] and dry spirit incarnate false prophet
[45:59] who is at satan into a prophets of
[46:02] people preaching their lives
[46:04] and then he becomes the beast
[46:06] they
[46:07] when not a demon
[46:09] that was in that antichrist
[46:12] that's it and what's it
[46:15] but when satan himself
[46:19] he said well now what's he saying
[46:23] that was a demon
[46:26] that was in them false prophets
[46:29] right
[46:30] the bible tells you this
[46:33] read what he's saying
[46:36] he's saying the beast is not a demon
[46:41] come on
[46:43] satan
[46:45] handed out spirit antichrist spirit
[46:47] incarnate false prophet then becomes a
[46:49] basic when not a demon that was in that
[46:52] antichrist
[46:54] that's not what the beast is
[46:58] but when satan himself is kicked out
[47:02] he comes down and takes over the place
[47:06] where the demon was
[47:09] where was that in the prophets you
[47:11] remember the other day i talked about it
[47:13] they just elected a a guy over all of
[47:16] them made my pope
[47:20] where the devil was the devil then the
[47:22] devil is incarnate of a man
[47:25] just repeating itself
[47:28] all right
[47:33] sticking next
[47:36] now you remember whatever said it that
[47:38] demon
[47:40] that was in that false prophet
[47:44] is not that beast
[47:46] right
[47:47] that beast is satan
[47:50] that demon was satan yes is one of
[47:52] satan's demons
[47:55] but when it comes to the beast it's the
[47:57] head man
[48:02] the beast is the devil himself because
[48:04] he's kicked out of heaven what we just
[48:06] read
[48:07] after we get out of here
[48:10] watch what he says paragraph 105
[48:12] for seal
[48:14] and when the laminate open the fourth
[48:16] seal
[48:17] let's stop there now the four seal now
[48:20] who opened it the lamb
[48:22] was anybody else worthy no one else
[48:24] could do it no
[48:26] the lamb opened the fourth seal
[48:29] now get the point
[48:32] and you'll separate the eagle
[48:34] from the lamb
[48:37] the lamb opened the fourth seal
[48:41] you remember in the third seal
[48:43] it was not the combat beast of the
[48:47] third
[48:48] combat beast that said
[48:50] a measure wheat for a penny and a minute
[48:52] of barley touch not the oil and wine
[48:54] that was the lamb himself you remember
[48:57] sunday
[48:58] all right see what's your prophecy
[49:02] the lamb opened the fourth
[49:05] seal
[49:06] and the the fourth beast
[49:08] the living creature like an eagle
[49:10] an hershey key
[49:12] said to john
[49:13] come and see what the fourth mystery
[49:20] right
[49:22] are you reading that all right amen
[49:26] are you reading where i got my finger
[49:28] can you see it from over there i'll they
[49:29] can see it
[49:31] he's not talking about the devil
[49:34] the plan of redemption is not redeeming
[49:36] the devil right
[49:38] man
[49:39] he's not being revealed he's being
[49:41] exposed
[49:57] what available the fourth mystery
[50:05] come on
[50:06] i'm just asking a simple question
[50:08] because what he's saying
[50:10] what is the fourth mystery
[50:14] amen of the plan of redemption
[50:21] come on church
[50:23] was you listening want to go right
[50:28] if we could ever find out how to destroy
[50:30] death it's going to take the fourth
[50:32] mystery to do it
[50:34] and it can only come by the eagle that's
[50:37] right
[50:38] yes sir
[50:39] none of the other ages could call him
[50:40] death
[50:43] right
[50:45] we'll get to that in a minute i'm going
[50:46] to do it sunday one
[50:53] the living creature like an eagle said
[50:55] to
[50:56] john
[50:57] come see what the fourth mystery of the
[50:58] planet redemption has been hid in this
[51:01] book
[51:01] because the lamb was opening it
[51:04] in other words
[51:06] that's what he was saying
[51:09] there's a fourth mystery here
[51:12] that's what the
[51:14] the combat beast is telling us
[51:17] the lamb is opening it
[51:19] bringing it down there's a forward
[51:20] mystery here
[51:22] i've showed you in symbol
[51:27] well
[51:28] you just see a symbol of the
[51:30] pale art
[51:33] remember in them symbols there's a lot
[51:35] of difference in what you think right
[51:40] go into the opposition
[51:43] of those symbols
[51:46] which we haven't done which we will do
[51:48] probably the next
[51:49] week or so
[51:51] we'll just preach a message
[51:53] of all the way through up to where we
[51:55] are
[51:56] and take both sides but we've been just
[51:59] dealing up until this message dealing
[52:02] with basically speaking about the
[52:04] antichrist false prophet pope
[52:08] etc
[52:10] exposing him
[52:16] but take the symbols of the horse amen
[52:19] in other words that's what he was saying
[52:21] there's a fourth mystery here i showed
[52:23] you in symbol and john i don't know
[52:25] whether you've understood it or not but
[52:27] he wrote down
[52:28] what he saw
[52:30] but it was a mystery so he wrote what he
[52:32] saw
[52:34] the lamb was breaking the seals
[52:36] and god still wasn't going to reveal it
[52:43] it was left for
[52:45] the last days
[52:48] that's right
[52:49] he was not going to reveal these seals
[52:52] until this day that's right
[52:56] the lies come back
[52:58] because that's basically what you're
[53:00] doing
[53:01] your mind i know it because mine done
[53:03] that until the lord began to break it
[53:05] away and help me to see it
[53:07] you're just looking at seals like a
[53:08] white horse and just finding out what
[53:10] that is right and you get all your
[53:12] symbols you get that down and you say
[53:13] well we got it
[53:16] and then you get a red horse and you say
[53:17] well we that's what we see the red horse
[53:19] and all the symbols we got it
[53:22] then you get a black one and you just
[53:23] see the symbols and we got it
[53:29] now we've come to a secret mystery under
[53:32] the fourth one
[53:34] amen
[53:38] to see that it's revealing jesus christ
[53:43] there's a statement brother man made one
[53:45] day and i've been looking i know i found
[53:47] one but it's close but
[53:49] he said we've talked enough about him
[53:54] what the devil right there
[53:58] we've talked enough about the devil
[54:01] you know the people of this message and
[54:03] i know i'm getting off of them mexican
[54:04] getting down to meddling but the people
[54:06] of this message are glorifying the devil
[54:08] that's what i'm trying to expose that's
[54:09] right amen
[54:12] glorifying the devil
[54:20] come on folks
[54:21] wake up
[54:24] there's some sitting here that know i
[54:25] know what i'm fixing to say and won't
[54:27] say much
[54:28] but you go join up with a certain group
[54:34] and they'll tell they first started out
[54:35] that it had to be a
[54:37] one supreme being
[54:39] now it's only dealing with a supreme
[54:41] being
[54:46] after you go so far
[54:48] it turns from
[54:50] looking at things to
[54:52] magic
[54:59] and you wind up worshiping the devil as
[55:02] your worshipful master
[55:09] okay
[55:12] but you see how easy and deceiving it is
[55:18] we had one brother that when i and i'm
[55:20] not against all of that i don't talk
[55:22] about those things
[55:24] we had one brother and he'd come to him
[55:26] and he said
[55:27] they lied to me
[55:30] i said
[55:32] i didn't beat on him in the hammer about
[55:33] it there's some sitting here i've never
[55:35] said a word to you
[55:37] but he couldn't he said they lied to me
[55:42] it's okay you found it out
[55:46] you found it out true sets you free
[55:50] okay
[55:52] but remember the lamb opened the fourth
[55:54] seal
[55:55] and the fourth living creature
[55:57] like an eagle
[56:03] now you've got an opportunity to be able
[56:06] to see
[56:07] the plan of redemption
[56:09] amen
[56:10] not that it wasn't dire on the
[56:14] others but they were not dealing with
[56:18] that they were dealing with the spirit
[56:20] of the age which was to sacrifice and to
[56:23] hang on and do the best they could
[56:26] and to live for jesus christ even though
[56:29] they died just for saying they were
[56:30] christians
[56:31] read foxy book of martyrs
[56:37] but you see
[56:41] waiting a time that we could
[56:45] understand
[56:48] the prophet unless brother richard
[56:49] wilson was last night
[56:51] waiting for a time that it could be
[56:53] comprehended
[56:55] that's it you know there's no need of
[56:57] god opening this in the first church age
[56:59] there was no need to open it in the
[57:00] second third fourth fifth and sixth
[57:04] there was no need of it
[57:06] because we couldn't comprehend them
[57:08] we're having trouble now right now
[57:11] because of the carnality of our mind and
[57:13] we want to keep rolling back but we're
[57:14] brotherly operating the seals for the
[57:16] bride
[57:18] i got quote quote
[57:21] yeah
[57:22] but are you going to deny the quotes
[57:24] where it says here to israel all right
[57:26] amen
[57:28] that's right
[57:29] and you are going to be in bad shape to
[57:31] think that we're going to be there when
[57:33] the fourth seal opens in armageddon
[57:40] terrible shape to think we're going to
[57:42] be there in the tribulation period
[57:45] no no no we don't believe that but we
[57:46] just don't want we just don't believe
[57:48] what you're talking about
[57:50] i thought i was reading it
[57:52] did i did i lose something somewhere i
[57:55] mean that's why i have page after page i
[57:57] thought i was reading it
[57:59] i thought i was reading what the prophet
[58:01] said that's right
[58:02] yeah but you're just putting it together
[58:04] that's what a brother told me one
[58:06] time he said you ain't nothing but a
[58:09] good baptist
[58:11] he said all you can do is just put the
[58:12] word together in the letter
[58:15] i just screamed that didn't bother me at
[58:17] all
[58:21] i said why did you change your mind
[58:25] he said brother i didn't think you had
[58:26] anything other than a new birth and it
[58:28] was nothing but
[58:31] this was his words
[58:35] he said when god spoke to you about that
[58:37] manifestation of spirits
[58:39] i knew the animal was right
[58:42] okay
[58:47] because that's what people think when
[58:48] they get over the romans you know in the
[58:50] days of the manifestation of the sons of
[58:52] god they think manifest goes out and
[58:53] call for rain and call for this and call
[58:55] for that all that that's wonderful but
[58:57] what about where it says making known
[58:59] right
[59:02] right manifest is to make known right
[59:06] your prophet came to make these things
[59:08] known
[59:10] that's why he was an eagle
[59:14] all right a wonderful position
[59:18] i hope we get down far enough to be able
[59:20] to
[59:20] cover it
[59:23] look at the next one parker at 158.
[59:29] now remember
[59:31] when we just read said it was a mystery
[59:36] the fourth seal is a mystery
[59:38] but then there's a mystery rejection
[59:41] because there was a mystery about the
[59:42] fourth seal it was you know it's just
[59:44] exposing the devil okay
[59:47] then when we find out his mystery here
[59:49] in
[59:50] his church and state
[59:53] the fourth stage of his ministry he's
[59:55] called the beast
[59:56] first he's called the antichrist and
[59:58] it's called false prophet and he's
[1:00:00] called the beast now we find him here
[1:00:03] being called as the beast and i want you
[1:00:05] to notice that after the fourth horse
[1:00:08] and then this fourth
[1:00:10] that's to want you to notice that's
[1:00:12] after the fourth quarter
[1:00:14] and in this fourth horse if you'll
[1:00:16] notice all the first one was white
[1:00:19] and then the next one was red the next
[1:00:21] one black and the fourth one all of
[1:00:24] these other three were represented in it
[1:00:28] is what makes it tail to
[1:00:30] because pale is red and white
[1:00:33] and so mixed together see
[1:00:36] he it's he's all mixed in this one horse
[1:00:40] and there he becomes four
[1:00:42] are actually the three and one
[1:00:44] he was all mixed up in that one thing
[1:00:48] mixing
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:51] now we're gonna read in a second what he
[1:00:52] mixes
[1:00:55] history powers
[1:00:56] heaven earth
[1:00:58] purgatory
[1:01:04] heaven earth and purgatory
[1:01:07] when he gets a mix together it's going
[1:01:10] to bring death
[1:01:14] but we'll find out it was death all
[1:01:15] alone you know
[1:01:17] but
[1:01:18] now what's his other three
[1:01:21] political
[1:01:22] power religious power
[1:01:26] and demon power right
[1:01:28] when you mix them together what have you
[1:01:30] got
[1:01:31] yeah
[1:01:32] amen that's right
[1:01:35] right
[1:01:36] pale horse
[1:01:38] okay go ahead to the next
[1:01:43] 136.

[1:02:07] how he heads up
[1:02:11] see

[1:02:15] so if the lord permits it
[1:02:18] he's going to come and do it the coming
[1:02:20] of this fellow
[1:02:22] well now beast at the beginning beast at
[1:02:25] the end
[1:02:26] where they're just like judas and jesus
[1:02:29] they're both brothers in their tribe
[1:02:32] just like he saw in jacob
[1:02:35] you know and the crow and the dove
[1:02:37] sitting on the same roost
[1:02:39] and everything is a twin
[1:02:41] in this great warfare that we're in the
[1:02:43] next one
[1:02:45] trying to do god of service without his
[1:02:47] will
[1:02:48] that being god's will america 37 i'm
[1:02:51] preaching i wouldn't preach it in
[1:02:53] brother jack's church he'd tell me go
[1:02:55] ahead and do it
[1:02:56] but i'm going to the tabernacle it'll be
[1:02:59] about four hours long and my subject is
[1:03:01] the beast at the beginning and the beast
[1:03:02] at the end through the trail of a
[1:03:05] serpent
[1:03:06] see
[1:03:07] it takes about four hours i got my
[1:03:09] scriptures all laid out
[1:03:12] the beast from the beginning he was the
[1:03:14] beast at the garden of eden he's the
[1:03:16] beast at the end and show how he's a
[1:03:18] religious person
[1:03:20] and a denomination
[1:03:22] that made the denomination
[1:03:24] and come right through the trail of it
[1:03:27] and prove it to you by the scripture
[1:03:29] that it is
[1:03:31] i didn't know that till the holy spirit
[1:03:33] gave it to me the other day
[1:03:35] up there
[1:03:37] that's one of the things of people who
[1:03:38] believe in the return ministry i believe
[1:03:40] brother brown has got to come back and
[1:03:41] preach the trail of the serpent
[1:03:44] that's one of their thinkings that's
[1:03:45] fine that's alright i have no problem
[1:03:47] not told you where i stand
[1:03:52] but listen
[1:03:55] you mix up all them colors
[1:03:59] look to the next now we're back on the
[1:04:00] fourth seal
[1:04:02] i got 195.
[1:04:07] when christ appears here on earth as its
[1:04:09] fellow appears and becomes completely
[1:04:11] completely the devil from the head cross
[1:04:13] all the way down the false prophet into
[1:04:15] the beast the devil himself and he's
[1:04:17] riding on a pale horse covered all up
[1:04:19] and mixed with all kinds of colors to
[1:04:21] make him pale
[1:04:22] and
[1:04:23] deadly
[1:04:25] right all right
[1:04:27] pale and deadly going to the next one
[1:04:31] alright 197 the fourth seal notice the
[1:04:34] antichrist was on a pale horse mixed
[1:04:36] color horse is a beast that represents
[1:04:38] the power his power is all mixed up why
[1:04:40] it's political
[1:04:41] it's national powers it's religious
[1:04:44] powers it's demon powers okay
[1:04:47] it's all kind of powers mixed together a
[1:04:50] mixed pale horse was he just got all
[1:04:53] kind of power do you remember what i was
[1:04:55] showing you that he couldn't be when it
[1:04:57] was an antichrist of the spirit
[1:04:59] he didn't have a crown he had to wait
[1:05:01] and become a pope well that'd be a pope
[1:05:03] that connected the government together
[1:05:05] so constantine
[1:05:06] brought the government in and that's why
[1:05:09] they could get bible killing 68 million
[1:05:13] because the government okay
[1:05:16] but when jesus comes it's on a
[1:05:18] one-colored solid colored horse
[1:05:28] this one mixes the colors of red white
[1:05:30] black
[1:05:31] three colors in one represented in one
[1:05:33] and three powers represented in one
[1:05:35] white horse a black horse red horse and
[1:05:38] three crowns
[1:05:39] in one
[1:05:41] triple ruling crown
[1:05:44] over heaven earth and purgatory right
[1:05:47] come on
[1:05:49] look at the next thing
[1:05:55] this is paragraph 310
[1:05:59] more sealed and here they're joining
[1:06:01] themselves together coming to that show
[1:06:03] down to armageddon
[1:06:04] i'm not gonna touch armageddon tonight
[1:06:06] period
[1:06:07] so don't get your thought running into
[1:06:09] armageddon we're coming up to that place
[1:06:11] we will do with that sunday sometime
[1:06:14] or some sunday
[1:06:18] let's go down to armageddon and riding
[1:06:19] on the mixed-colored horse
[1:06:21] with one horse of white one horse of red
[1:06:24] one horse of black the three different
[1:06:26] political of political power spiritual
[1:06:28] power control but demon powers which is
[1:06:30] the antichrist mixing that all together
[1:06:33] you've got a
[1:06:35] pale
[1:06:36] sickly
[1:06:38] looking thing
[1:06:41] he's right
[1:06:44] now now
[1:06:47] here is where our fear comes in
[1:06:50] and makes us think the wrong thing
[1:06:56] the bible speaks of the devil
[1:06:59] there's a man laying in a ditch
[1:07:03] with no power
[1:07:07] he's like a drunk
[1:07:09] that's laying in a ditch
[1:07:10] the bible describes a map we'll go back
[1:07:12] to scripture if you need it
[1:07:17] let's see we're afraid of him
[1:07:26] we're afraid that he may be powerful
[1:07:28] more than we think right
[1:07:30] why would you be afraid of him
[1:07:34] yeah but look what he's done to people i
[1:07:36] agree
[1:07:37] right
[1:07:39] but you know yourself most others
[1:07:40] because people volunteering
[1:07:44] that's right
[1:07:46] when you take the governments and the
[1:07:47] things like we've got them today
[1:07:49] and the government can control
[1:07:50] everything you're right back to the same
[1:07:53] situation where they can kill you
[1:07:55] and they just erase your name right now
[1:07:57] from all records
[1:07:58] by just the blood of your name and goes
[1:08:00] off the computer and you no longer exist
[1:08:03] and you'll not be able to buy ourselves
[1:08:05] right
[1:08:06] that's never been until now
[1:08:09] never being that the mark of the beast
[1:08:10] could be made manifest until now
[1:08:14] those are not jabbers those are facts
[1:08:18] you can take your name off a record
[1:08:19] right now and you no longer exist
[1:08:24] you can go in hard scream all you want
[1:08:26] to you don't exist
[1:08:28] look at it
[1:08:30] sickly looking thing he's riding on
[1:08:40] sure don't look like a powerful horse
[1:08:41] does it no
[1:08:42] that's right
[1:08:46] so you're looking at it as thinking as
[1:08:48] some kind of great powerful horse
[1:08:50] this demon power political power
[1:08:56] spiritual powers
[1:08:58] demon powers
[1:09:02] that's where our trouble is
[1:09:04] we're looking at them like they have a
[1:09:06] power
[1:09:09] the way you're talking they're going to
[1:09:10] get you brother dale
[1:09:12] they won't get me until god's through
[1:09:14] with that
[1:09:17] that goes out there for them to listen
[1:09:19] to as well as anything
[1:09:22] until god gets through with me
[1:09:25] and if he ain't through with me i got a
[1:09:27] lot of scripture to stand on
[1:09:30] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:09:31] spirit of the lord will raise up the
[1:09:33] standard
[1:09:34] man
[1:09:37] no
[1:09:38] i think it's wise to be sensible right
[1:09:43] yeah okay
[1:09:47] sickly looking thing he's riding on
[1:09:51] why
[1:09:53] why did it get up here where you got the
[1:09:55] white
[1:09:56] as a great powerful
[1:09:57] deceptive you've got the red that they
[1:09:59] could kill by the millions you got the
[1:10:02] black
[1:10:03] that represents your dark ages that
[1:10:05] brought around said no telling how many
[1:10:07] billion was killed spiritually
[1:10:11] right
[1:10:13] right
[1:10:16] why would it now show him as a
[1:10:18] pale
[1:10:20] sickly
[1:10:23] oh that's just the way it looks
[1:10:25] i'm glad you said that
[1:10:27] that's what i'm talking about right
[1:10:33] the symbol of that seal is a
[1:10:35] sickly
[1:10:40] situation
[1:10:44] that you and i should not have any fear
[1:10:46] of
[1:10:53] yeah but look what they can do they
[1:10:54] can't do nothing till god gets through
[1:10:56] with it that's right right he didn't
[1:10:58] worry about that at all
[1:11:02] why would it call him a
[1:11:04] horse
[1:11:10] because now he's come down he looked
[1:11:11] like he's got everything in the world
[1:11:12] under his control right
[1:11:14] political powers even to
[1:11:16] the
[1:11:17] their heaven or in purgatory that he's
[1:11:19] ruler over you can pray them out of hell
[1:11:21] or bring them out of purgatory do all
[1:11:23] kind of things
[1:11:25] got the government behind him and all
[1:11:26] the political maneuvers
[1:11:34] amen

[1:11:48] come and see
[1:11:54] he's going to show you what this stuff
[1:11:56] is
[1:12:01] and how it's going to wind up and be
[1:12:02] destroyed
[1:12:06] instead of satan gaining power
[1:12:10] you think he's got everything in control
[1:12:12] he's got the governments he's got the
[1:12:14] religious he's got everything in his
[1:12:16] control
[1:12:19] what does that matter right
[1:12:22] what are you afraid of that's right
[1:12:32] what are you afraid of jerk
[1:12:43] i'm serious
[1:12:45] right

[1:14:46] of god to be as god that is the beast
[1:14:48] which is satan incarnate that's when
[1:14:50] satan has been cast out because we go up

[1:16:00] in this message
[1:16:02] minister sat right here and was having a
[1:16:03] minister to me one day but i always
[1:16:05] thought
[1:16:06] we'd come back with him and fight
[1:16:08] on that revelation 19.
[1:16:12] i said five
[1:16:15] you mean we are supernatural
[1:16:18] eternal beings to fight natural people

[1:16:40] all right here we go all right
[1:16:44] please now he now he is a beast
[1:16:46] and a antichrist fox prophet now beast
[1:16:48] and given the name of death and hell
[1:16:50] follows him
[1:16:52] fully satan on this throne now that's
[1:16:54] after the rapture
[1:16:56] then we go up because he's kicked out
[1:16:58] remember he's kicked out because we were
[1:17:01] on the earth he's satan rep satan
[1:17:05] he's saving representatives on the earth
[1:17:08] now he that he
[1:17:10] now is head of the kingdom of the world
[1:17:13] the first thing kingdoms we offer to the
[1:17:15] lord jesus in matthew 4 satan now
[1:17:17] becomes a full king
[1:17:20] now this happens later on he's false
[1:17:22] prophet now he will come become beast
[1:17:25] after a while when he breaks his
[1:17:27] covenant there with the jews you know
[1:17:29] how we've been through that now there's
[1:17:31] how you understand you down on 70 weeks
[1:17:34] he breaks his covenant
[1:17:38] with the israel going to the next one
[1:17:42] paragraph 192 nobody's satan fully only
[1:17:44] strong yes sir
[1:17:46] offered it to god
[1:17:48] you talk about the world
[1:17:50] offered it to our lord
[1:17:52] he is sitting here with his beastly
[1:17:53] heart in him
[1:17:58] snake incarnate the devil in a man
[1:18:01] to become incarnate he's got a beastly
[1:18:03] heart
[1:18:04] don't get into that what's his heart
[1:18:06] over here what did it hurt was it down
[1:18:08] here
[1:18:12] you've got a beastly heart
[1:18:17] not a gizzard
[1:18:20] now here is the person the beast the
[1:18:22] incarnate devil he makes his appearing
[1:18:25] here on earth under the false pretense
[1:18:27] oh my goodness under the false prince of
[1:18:30] the true word
[1:18:34] oh
[1:18:37] he associates himself with the word yep
[1:18:40] that's right are you ready
[1:18:42] amen
[1:18:44] when he's cast out he don't come down
[1:18:46] say i'm the devil
[1:18:49] no
[1:18:50] no that's three and a half years
[1:18:53] of tribulation
[1:18:56] and then he breaks his covenant with
[1:18:58] israel
[1:19:00] at the end of three and a half years
[1:19:02] until that time he's the good old boy
[1:19:05] then according to the book of daniel
[1:19:07] that makes craft to prosper makes all of
[1:19:10] the things then he comes in like
[1:19:12] flattery he's a wonderful superman guy
[1:19:18] under the false pretense
[1:19:24] one
[1:19:25] of the true word
[1:19:26] right
[1:19:29] in other words they tell me you just got
[1:19:31] the word he's the one who said john he
[1:19:33] associated himself with the word
[1:19:37] and he can call fire down out of heaven
[1:19:39] that's right
[1:19:41] amen
[1:19:42] is that right is that the book of
[1:19:43] revelation
[1:19:47] he can do things
[1:19:50] why
[1:19:52] because he's satan incarnate
[1:19:56] we see the little bride's done gone
[1:19:59] lord
[1:20:00] my wife was saying the other day on the
[1:20:02] daniel stephanie
[1:20:03] see the only people battling him is not
[1:20:04] the natural jew they're the covenant
[1:20:06] with him right the only ones that's
[1:20:07] battling him is 144 000 when they're
[1:20:09] telling them that ain't right and this
[1:20:11] boy over here saying
[1:20:13] get even get rid of them get off take
[1:20:15] care of that
[1:20:17] you know what they do they take care of
[1:20:18] that
[1:20:19] they kill them
[1:20:20] then
[1:20:23] they find out you're done wrong
[1:20:26] it's going to be chaos to the natural
[1:20:28] israel right
[1:20:30] okay his death let's go a little further
[1:20:40] let me just get this quit off right here
[1:20:42] i'm gonna go any further we're going too
[1:20:44] far
[1:20:46] america two team watch
[1:20:48] christ first coming
[1:20:50] he comes immortal to bleed and die is
[1:20:52] that right
[1:20:53] that's his first coming the second
[1:20:54] coming is the rapture we made it
[1:20:57] undiscovered immortal his third coming
[1:20:59] he's the incarnate god
[1:21:01] amen god emmanuel to reign on earth
[1:21:04] that's right only three okay
[1:21:08] so satan is following after
[1:21:11] him becoming incarnate and you and i
[1:21:14] for a rapture to come then he followers
[1:21:17] with the beast being incarnate and
[1:21:19] saying he's god
[1:21:24] right
[1:21:26] but you see we've done gone
[1:21:28] four stages of the writer the fourth
[1:21:30] stage of this writer is called
[1:21:32] death
[1:21:34] death means eternal separation from god
[1:21:37] that's what death means to be eternally
[1:21:40] separated
[1:21:41] that's what god calls him
[1:21:44] and i'll just fold that over
[1:21:46] and we'll start it right there sunday
[1:21:49] we know
[1:21:51] the combat beats the eagle is the one
[1:21:53] that called him death
[1:21:55] but what is this
[1:22:00] if we take into account the last two
[1:22:02] things we were reading
[1:22:04] of how that god becomes incarnate in the
[1:22:06] people
[1:22:09] in the word
[1:22:11] and satan becomes incarnate in his
[1:22:13] people
[1:22:16] after we get out of here
[1:22:20] then we should consider one thing
[1:22:23] i'll review this sunday
[1:22:27] but why does it say
[1:22:29] in revelation 6
[1:22:32] verse 7-8 verse 8.
[1:22:38] it doesn't say his name is dead it said
[1:22:40] it was dead
[1:22:43] brother brown said his name is death
[1:22:50] now i want to end in just a minute or
[1:22:51] something
[1:22:55] you see what brother dale death is not a
[1:22:57] name
[1:22:58] yeah
[1:23:05] when the bible says it is
[1:23:08] the prophet says it is
[1:23:12] i don't care what your english
[1:23:15] vocabulary thinks about it
[1:23:19] but i'll remind you in your english
[1:23:21] vocabulary
[1:23:24] little now
[1:23:29] i'm real good in english
[1:23:32] but i do know how to read
[1:23:34] a noun is a name of a person
[1:23:38] place
[1:23:40] or what
[1:23:42] or thing
[1:23:48] so death is a thing
[1:23:51] it's not a person
[1:23:54] it's not a place
[1:23:58] it's a thing
[1:24:06] you see we look at it we want names laid
[1:24:08] upon things
[1:24:14] according to revelation 19
[1:24:19] that writer
[1:24:24] has a
[1:24:28] name on him
[1:24:32] which is the word of god
[1:24:42] you're waking up right
[1:24:49] loretta says that is jesus i got all
[1:24:51] that time
[1:24:53] we know that we know he's his word
[1:24:56] but just remember he's just as much god
[1:24:59] when it says jesus
[1:25:01] he's just as much god when it says in
[1:25:03] the beginning was the word word god the
[1:25:04] word was god and the word was made flesh
[1:25:06] and dwelt among us
[1:25:08] brother said translate that
[1:25:11] now this is his wording he said in the
[1:25:13] beginning what was
[1:25:15] elohim he said elohim was with god and
[1:25:18] elohim was god and elohim was
[1:25:20] made flesh and dwelt among us well
[1:25:22] elohim then it's a name
[1:25:24] right
[1:25:26] the word
[1:25:29] forgive me
[1:25:33] the word is a thing
[1:25:41] now you really stepped over
[1:25:46] because the word
[1:25:48] is a person
[1:25:50] that's right
[1:25:55] and it was placed before the foundation
[1:25:57] of the world
[1:26:02] and become a thing
[1:26:06] i want you ashamed to call the word a
[1:26:08] thing
[1:26:10] i remember brother years ago
[1:26:12] we were talking about something and
[1:26:14] then the bible calls the holy ghost and
[1:26:16] it you know that you want me to get
[1:26:18] scripture right the bible calls the holy
[1:26:20] ghost in it and he didn't like that
[1:26:22] translation whatsoever
[1:26:24] he was dogmatic against that part of
[1:26:28] saying the holy ghost was an idiot
[1:26:31] i never had no problem with it i didn't
[1:26:32] have enough education to figure it out
[1:26:35] i just read it citizen here
[1:26:38] and i knew what that idea was
[1:26:41] don't you all right right
[1:26:44] i've been under the bed this morning
[1:26:45] thank you now brother said a theologian
[1:26:48] will turn to this theology every time
[1:26:53] you have people in this message that are
[1:26:55] turning and i know one did
[1:26:58] because he said he did did he relied
[1:27:00] upon a
[1:27:01] theologian
[1:27:04] to help him understand
[1:27:07] i do too
[1:27:08] he's one called the holy spirit
[1:27:12] and he had a man to bring it down called
[1:27:14] william brown
[1:27:16] to bring it unto me
[1:27:19] so if you can see that
[1:27:22] death
[1:27:24] is a thing
[1:27:28] that's a name
[1:27:32] if you can see that then you can see
[1:27:35] the word
[1:27:38] is a person
[1:27:42] it's jesus christ
[1:27:48] you don't have to rewrite the bible
[1:27:51] just understand the mechanical side of
[1:27:53] it
[1:27:57] we get to it sunday
[1:27:58] it took the eagle to name it death
[1:28:04] the others
[1:28:06] looked at it as a deceptive form of
[1:28:08] different things and couldn't follow it
[1:28:10] true as even john on batman's admired
[1:28:14] that church
[1:28:19] until he found that all that was in her
[1:28:21] was
[1:28:22] death
[1:28:25] death is not
[1:28:26] dying
[1:28:28] you know hearts quit beating oh they did
[1:28:33] oh that soul lives on
[1:28:36] no matter whether you're sinner or saint
[1:28:38] that soul lives on until a time
[1:28:41] because only god can kill a soul that's
[1:28:43] right
[1:28:45] satan can't kill one
[1:28:48] amen
[1:28:49] he can blow you to pieces brother ray
[1:28:51] but he can't kill you he just puts you
[1:28:54] in the other side
[1:28:59] death is a name
[1:29:05] it's a personification
[1:29:09] of satan
[1:29:13] because the word
[1:29:15] is a person
[1:29:17] which is a personification
[1:29:20] of almighty god
[1:29:26] back on these things
[1:29:29] sickly pale horse
[1:29:35] oh it reads er that he had power to do
[1:29:38] this and that
[1:29:40] because he had all the governments and
[1:29:41] everything in the world
[1:29:46] but he's got no power over the bride of
[1:29:48] jesus christ right
[1:29:55] i remember drawing out for some brothers
[1:29:57] one time at a meeting we were having
[1:30:00] we were talking about how that gets over
[1:30:02] to the end and what happens with israel
[1:30:05] and i asked the question of who was
[1:30:07] fighting
[1:30:12] and by this quote to the prophet and the
[1:30:14] scripture i took out a position
[1:30:16] everybody
[1:30:19] even the two witnesses are killed
[1:30:22] before armageddon
[1:30:24] well who's fighting
[1:30:26] well that's where everybody will bless
[1:30:28] god we'll come back riding on him horses
[1:30:30] and we're just going to sword we're just
[1:30:31] going to kill we're just going to cut
[1:30:33] people you can see what kind of a demon
[1:30:35] spirit they've got right
[1:30:38] a supernatural person sitting on a
[1:30:40] supernatural horse to battle natural
[1:30:42] people with an army tank
[1:30:46] all you gotta do that's gone
[1:30:52] but when i draw it down i drove it out
[1:30:54] and you know what's left
[1:30:56] the last was two witnesses left standing
[1:30:58] on the earth
[1:31:01] i said but the bible says they're killed
[1:31:03] right
[1:31:04] that's right
[1:31:05] now who's going to fight it then brother
[1:31:09] the bible says
[1:31:11] out of the mouth of those two prophets
[1:31:15] will come the word of god
[1:31:18] that will annihilate the enemy
[1:31:23] it will be the word
[1:31:25] that will destroy satan
[1:31:28] ain't gonna be no physical battle
[1:31:31] that's not what everybody read the bible
[1:31:33] says michael in revelation 12 michael
[1:31:35] and all fought in heaven and they throw
[1:31:37] him out like michael and jesus was just
[1:31:39] slugging it out boy they just fighting
[1:31:41] gabriel whatever
[1:31:51] like a physical force
[1:31:53] satan just brought his powers up and
[1:31:55] jesus standing there as michael because
[1:31:58] that's where satan could never
[1:31:59] understand it
[1:32:01] he says can i
[1:32:04] you have no more right here that's right
[1:32:07] all right
[1:32:09] there wasn't no physical
[1:32:10] fighting that's right there's no
[1:32:12] fighting now
[1:32:15] christ is in charge
[1:32:18] as long as he's in charge what are we
[1:32:19] afraid of
[1:32:21] amen
[1:32:24] but enemy could destroy us
[1:32:32] why can't we at least be like israel
[1:32:37] now right now we're standing the whole
[1:32:39] world and we americans are patting
[1:32:41] around trying to sit somewhere in the
[1:32:42] world to keep them and keep giving away
[1:32:45] their land and typing them into it
[1:32:50] to try to have peace
[1:32:53] and they say give us but we'll blow the
[1:32:55] whole thing up
[1:33:01] they can take it all down
[1:33:04] they're sitting on the center of the
[1:33:05] earth
[1:33:06] why would they say we have the sampson
[1:33:08] effect
[1:33:13] you afraid of their bombs
[1:33:17] what would be the samson effect
[1:33:22] what if they know
[1:33:24] exactly where they're sitting
[1:33:27] and they know to put off a bomb
[1:33:31] under the earth right there
[1:33:34] will bring the whole thing to total
[1:33:36] annihilation
[1:33:42] remember the pyramid of egypt
[1:33:44] chiops is sitting in the center of the
[1:33:47] earth
[1:33:54] come on church what are we afraid of all
[1:33:56] right that's all i'm trying to get you
[1:33:58] to look at we're looking at a pail we
[1:33:59] look at the red we look at them we see
[1:34:01] the power they have but now look at this
[1:34:03] you said it's got all the powers but
[1:34:05] what good is those powers
[1:34:08] you know
[1:34:10] we preach back are the satan has no
[1:34:12] power
[1:34:13] only what god permits him to use
[1:34:18] that's right
[1:34:19] are you afraid of any country or any
[1:34:22] thing
[1:34:28] brother i'm afraid of dying well then
[1:34:29] you need to be
[1:34:30] saved that's right
[1:34:31] that's the best way to get rid of the
[1:34:33] free of dying right now let's stand
[1:34:35] together
[1:34:39] let him be on our side
[1:34:42] michael on our side we don't have to
[1:34:43] worry about nothing do it
[1:34:47] he'll take care of it anybody have a
[1:34:48] need your altar is open
[1:34:50] let's sing and worship and think about
[1:34:52] it but what he's doing for us
[1:34:57] even the symbol of the seal is not a
[1:35:00] powerful looking something it's a weak
[1:35:02] sickly
[1:35:05] probably didn't lose it believe it just
[1:35:07] as mixings
[1:35:10] the bible tells you sickly looking
[1:35:16] he's defeated right
[1:35:20] sure we got a battle of armageddon but
[1:35:22] it's a spiritual battle
[1:35:24] what's going on now we'll get down to
[1:35:25] that
[1:35:27] we'll see death destroyed amen
[1:35:32] somebody is
[1:35:33] right
[1:35:35] and why can't we be where are we
[1:35:37] 97 lord jesus consensus
[1:35:40] anybody have a need
[1:36:07] what do you
[1:36:13] is
[1:36:36] thank is
[1:36:52] jesus
[1:37:11] yes
[1:37:26] is
[1:38:09] foreign
[1:38:22] is
[1:38:41] satisfaction
[1:38:46] oh
[1:39:11] thank you
[1:39:27] is
[1:39:48] most of you know that
[1:39:52] the donny didn't have been taking care
[1:39:53] of
[1:39:55] andy's kids and things
[1:39:58] and
[1:40:00] you know
[1:40:01] we've been praying hoping they would
[1:40:02] work out things and maybe that ricky
[1:40:04] could get straightened out and do things
[1:40:08] it don't look like it's working out
[1:40:11] now
[1:40:14] they're set to the place that
[1:40:18] they can go to court now and the
[1:40:20] children can be theirs
[1:40:26] and maybe they'll
[1:40:27] get them totally free i mean they will
[1:40:29] could not
[1:40:30] they wouldn't fool with it
[1:40:32] they can get everything free
[1:40:35] but still it's something to think about
[1:40:37] when you gotta
[1:40:39] take three children
[1:40:42] and raise them
[1:40:45] everything is your own
[1:40:48] so they just want us to pray that god
[1:40:50] will work out everything
[1:40:54] for perfect will
[1:40:56] for what he wants that's right
[1:40:59] they're willing to do their part it may
[1:41:01] mean a lot of things
[1:41:04] but
[1:41:07] i just want what would we all do
[1:41:09] when you're faced with a thing of
[1:41:11] knowing that the children don't have a
[1:41:12] hoax whatsoever
[1:41:14] nowhere else
[1:41:17] what are you going to do
[1:41:21] let's all pray
[1:41:24] let's all believe just like we would
[1:41:26] like we would dedicate a baby that we
[1:41:28] have
[1:41:29] let's say this whole church is dedicated
[1:41:31] now to
[1:41:32] raise that baby you know give a life
[1:41:34] before it and things
[1:41:37] well let's just put this into the hands
[1:41:39] of the lord amen and believe that
[1:41:42] god will work it all out for his honor
[1:41:44] and glory
[1:41:46] and that whatever comes out of it it'll
[1:41:48] be his honor it'll be his
[1:41:50] his doings because we're going to
[1:41:52] believe it that way
[1:41:53] that's right
[1:41:55] everything so
[1:41:56] they're willing to give up the children
[1:41:58] give them full control so that's
[1:42:01] as long as they'll do that
[1:42:04] that i wouldn't go no other way hardly
[1:42:06] but you still couldn't close your home
[1:42:08] to a child and not take care of it
[1:42:11] those little kids are wonderful little
[1:42:13] kids that's right
[1:42:17] let's just pray on it
[1:42:20] lord jesus
[1:42:23] as a church of the living god
[1:42:26] we come before you this night
[1:42:29] with heavy hearts in many ways
[1:42:32] because we know and realize these
[1:42:34] children
[1:42:35] have no hopes without
[1:42:37] donnie and susan
[1:42:39] but no one also lowered that taking on
[1:42:41] the family and raising us a lot of
[1:42:44] burdens and heartaches
[1:42:48] but we know that it can all be wonderful
[1:42:51] if we just leave it in your hands
[1:42:54] and let you take care of it
[1:42:57] lord you just
[1:42:58] touched the children and that's
[1:43:01] donnie and susan and everything lord
[1:43:04] you work out everything
[1:43:07] but there'll be a lot of financial
[1:43:09] things in it raising kids
[1:43:12] lord just help
[1:43:14] bless and take care of everything
[1:43:19] but just have brother donahue sister
[1:43:21] susan to have the right attitude in
[1:43:23] their hearts
[1:43:24] that whatever comes with this will come
[1:43:26] for your honor and glory
[1:43:29] all be made manifest for you lord
[1:43:32] we love you and we thank you
[1:43:35] in jesus name
[1:43:38] amen we're going to believe everything
[1:43:40] will be alright
[1:43:42] it'll all be worked out all right
[1:43:44] anybody else will just have a need
[1:43:46] before we
[1:43:47] go here
[1:43:55] there's a blessed time that's coming
[1:43:59] coming soon
