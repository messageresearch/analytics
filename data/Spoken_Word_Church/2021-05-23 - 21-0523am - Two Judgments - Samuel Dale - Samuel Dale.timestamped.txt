[4:04] all right i want to take up where we
[4:07] were that
[4:08] last weekend because i want to make sure
[4:11] that you
[4:12] follow me in what i'm trying to teach on
[4:15] this
[4:15] thought and we had just like questions
[4:18] and answer part of it
[4:20] but i want us to make sure we understand
[4:23] and get everything in the right order
[4:25] because i don't want us to misunderstand
[4:27] and say well i don't
[4:29] i just didn't believe that i didn't
[4:30] didn't understand that well
[4:32] the best thing to do is just for just to
[4:34] take a thought about it
[4:36] and we'll try to consider it okay all
[4:38] right
[4:39] revelations 20 verse 7
[4:43] and when the thousand years are expired
[4:45] satan shall be loosed out of his prison
[4:48] and shall go out to deceive the nations
[4:51] which are
[4:52] in the four quarters of the earth gog
[4:54] and magog
[4:56] to gather them together to battle the
[4:58] number
[4:59] of whom is as the sand of the sea
[5:02] and they went up on the breath of the
[5:04] earth and compassed the camp with the
[5:06] saints about
[5:07] and the beloved city and the fire came
[5:09] down from god out of heaven
[5:11] and devoured them and the devil that
[5:13] deceived them was cast into the lake of
[5:15] fire
[5:16] and brimstone where the beast and the
[5:18] false prophet
[5:19] are and shall be tormented day and night
[5:22] forever and ever
[5:25] and i saw a great white throne and him
[5:28] that sat on it
[5:31] from whose face the earth and the
[5:34] heavens fled away
[5:35] and there was found no place for them
[5:38] and i saw the dead small and great
[5:40] stand before god and the books were open
[5:43] books plural now
[5:44] and another book was opened which is the
[5:46] book of life
[5:48] and the deeds and the dead were judged
[5:52] of those things which were written in
[5:54] the books
[5:55] according to their works all right now
[5:58] keep in mind what we're covering and
[6:00] we'll get to thought in a minute now
[6:02] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[6:04] in it and death and
[6:06] hell delivered up the dead which were in
[6:09] them
[6:09] and they were judged every man according
[6:11] to their works
[6:14] now judged watch now and death and hell
[6:17] were cast into the lake of fire this is
[6:19] the second death
[6:21] and whoso ever was not found written in
[6:24] the book of life was cast
[6:26] into the lake of fire all right let's go
[6:29] to romans now
[6:31] because what we're going to do is try to
[6:33] pick up our thought from last week so
[6:38] we'll get it romans 14.
[6:47] let's start with verse 10.
[6:50] but why does thou why dost thou
[6:53] judge thy brother or why dost thou
[6:57] set at naught thy brother for we
[7:00] shall all stand before the judgment seat
[7:03] of christ
[7:06] all right you believe that for it is
[7:09] written
[7:09] as i live saith the lord every knee
[7:12] shall bow to me
[7:13] and every tongue shall confess to god so
[7:16] then every one of us shall give an
[7:18] account of himself to god
[7:20] let us not therefore judge one another
[7:23] anymore
[7:24] but judge this rather that no man put a
[7:27] stumbling block
[7:29] of our on our an occasion to fall
[7:32] in his brother's way you may be seated
[7:34] the lord at his blessing
[7:36] to the reading of the word now we had a
[7:38] question about this
[7:43] last week and i just want to make sure
[7:44] now the main point i want to make sure
[7:47] that
[7:48] that you understand uh what is being
[7:51] said
[7:52] and that way we can follow it through it
[7:54] and it won't be any trouble with
[7:56] with something come up say well what is
[7:58] this and what is that
[8:01] now we've read here in revelations 20
[8:05] that there is a great white throne a
[8:07] judgment seat
[8:09] all right and there'll be people there
[8:12] the thousands of thousands are sitting
[8:14] there and all
[8:15] all right it's a judgment seat white
[8:18] throne judgment
[8:19] okay then we read in romans 14
[8:23] that we were all going to sit before the
[8:27] judgment seat of christ or stand before
[8:29] it
[8:30] all right now let's get that straight
[8:32] because see if we don't
[8:34] we've got a vast confusion in our minds
[8:40] because it's talking about a white
[8:42] throne
[8:45] it's there in the scripture you know
[8:47] revelation a great white throne
[8:49] is placed in order of showing that it
[8:52] has to be
[8:53] after the uh millennium it has to be
[8:55] after the thing
[8:57] and you know we read that and we'll give
[8:59] brother random in a minute to
[9:00] to show why so then you'll understand
[9:03] more about it
[9:04] but now to think about it
[9:08] a great white throne judgment then we
[9:11] read
[9:13] that paul is talking about a judgment
[9:18] a judgment seat of christ all right
[9:23] now are we going to stand before the
[9:25] white throne judgment
[9:31] are we going to stand before the
[9:34] judgment seat of christ
[9:41] it's it's hard to comprehend the two
[9:45] different thoughts
[9:46] because one of them is a great white
[9:49] throne judgment
[9:51] and it's picked up as we'll get back to
[9:53] it in a minute but it's picked up to be
[9:55] the same judgment
[9:57] that is in daniel 7 9
[10:00] through 10 there daniel is speaking of
[10:03] the white throne judgment
[10:06] all right revelation is speaking of the
[10:09] whites on judgment
[10:10] that people will be standing before the
[10:13] judgments
[10:15] all right now but at the same time we
[10:19] have paul speaking
[10:22] in romans of a judgment seat of christ
[10:25] that we'll all have to set before
[10:27] or stand before and that's picked up in
[10:31] second
[10:32] corinthians 5
[10:36] there's another account to where paul is
[10:38] covering
[10:39] the judgment seat of christ
[10:42] all right so now let's get that straight
[10:46] because that was the question that was
[10:47] asked and i don't want you to
[10:49] be confused about uh what is it uh
[10:53] you know i want you to have an
[10:54] understand if you don't then ask me a
[10:56] question about it and we'll try to
[10:58] speak some more about it or clear it up
[10:59] but i want you to be clear
[11:01] uh does the bride of jesus christ stand
[11:03] before the white throne judgment
[11:07] no no amen all right
[11:10] thank you lord the bride of christ does
[11:13] not stand before the white throne
[11:15] judgment
[11:16] amen all right so then
[11:21] what daniel was speaking of and what
[11:24] john was speaking of in revelation
[11:27] of a white throne judgment or a judgment
[11:30] seat
[11:32] it cannot be applied to the bride of
[11:34] jesus christ
[11:35] to be sitting and to watch on judgment
[11:39] because if it would be then that would
[11:43] put us in a
[11:44] pitiful situation the white throne
[11:48] judgment is a judgment
[11:49] not only of the deeds in the body
[11:53] you know the things we do but it's a
[11:55] judgment of whether or not that you can
[11:57] go into eternal life
[12:01] are you following me the white throne
[12:05] judgment
[12:06] is a judgment of a decision to find out
[12:09] whether or not you can enter into
[12:11] eternal life all right
[12:14] so then we see that that cannot be the
[12:17] bride of jesus christ
[12:21] because she has she does not stand
[12:23] before the judgment seat
[12:25] she sits on the judgment seat
[12:29] all right we understand that she sits on
[12:32] the judgment seat with him
[12:34] judging the people
[12:38] all right so it's not the fact that
[12:41] we have the separation of it and fully
[12:44] in control of the scriptures
[12:47] even though it looks like you well
[12:48] you've got this one there's a judgment
[12:50] seat you've got this one as a judgment
[12:51] seat
[12:52] but get to get it to correct into which
[12:54] is what
[12:55] and what's going on all right
[12:59] at the great white throne judgment
[13:02] which is placed after the millennium
[13:04] after thing and winding up you know
[13:06] in the finishing of all things all right
[13:09] now the bride of jesus christ
[13:13] does not stand before that white throne
[13:15] she sits
[13:16] on that throne with him judging the
[13:19] people
[13:20] all right amen amen
[13:24] are you following me is that clear now
[13:26] you understand what i'm saying that
[13:28] i want that point drove in to work that
[13:30] you'll understand
[13:35] the bride does not stand before the
[13:37] whites on judgment why
[13:39] because she's born again she receives
[13:42] eternal life here
[13:44] the white throne judgment will will be a
[13:46] judgment seat
[13:47] of a decision whether or not to go into
[13:50] eternal life
[13:52] right amen now in doing that then
[13:56] the white throne will will not be to the
[14:00] bride
[14:00] it'll be to those that she's sitting
[14:02] there to judge
[14:05] all right now do we understand that
[14:08] is that clear we don't we don't stand
[14:12] before the white throne judgment we'll
[14:13] give you these in a minute from the
[14:15] prophet
[14:16] we don't go before the whites on
[14:18] judgment because why would you go before
[14:20] the white throne judgment
[14:21] if you're a born-again christian
[14:24] like brother branham says a good
[14:25] illustration he said you're going to put
[14:27] your wife through a test
[14:30] you remember that you know said you're
[14:32] going to put your wife through a test
[14:35] to decide whether or not
[14:38] you know she's worthy
[14:42] but why are you going to wait and do
[14:43] that i thought you picked her for your
[14:44] wife to
[14:47] to be your helpmate so then it goes to
[14:51] show that that white throne judgment
[14:53] is not a decision or the bride of christ
[14:57] will not be
[14:58] sitting there she'll be sitting with him
[15:01] on that judgment
[15:04] judging others all right now that
[15:07] fulfills the scriptures then
[15:09] all right but i want to make sure you
[15:12] understand that and don't have no
[15:14] no parts in your mind to say but why
[15:16] would we sit before the judgment seat of
[15:18] christ
[15:21] i've confessed all of my sins here
[15:25] why would there be a judgment seat of
[15:26] christ and what is that judgment seat
[15:32] but get it clear now where there won't
[15:35] be any problem
[15:37] the bride does not
[15:41] go before the whites on judgment
[15:44] because that is owned after that she's
[15:46] done lived a thousand years in the
[15:47] millennial rhyme
[15:50] she's done went through that part of it
[15:52] she went through the the parts of going
[15:54] up in a rapture
[15:57] and being with god and it's already
[16:00] determined that she's
[16:02] has eternal life that's right well why
[16:05] would she be judged
[16:08] what is there to be judged about a
[16:10] born-again believer
[16:14] right it cannot be a decision of eternal
[16:17] life
[16:18] because that's what you receive
[16:26] we receive jesus christ as our savior
[16:30] giving us eternal life
[16:34] and that way we don't have to worry
[16:35] about
[16:37] standing before the white throne
[16:39] judgment
[16:42] let alone to think about that there's
[16:44] people
[16:45] sitting on that judgment seat with him
[16:49] that will be judging those that are
[16:51] outside of that that's right
[16:55] and to know that that bride of christ
[16:57] that wife
[17:00] will sit with him in judgment
[17:04] because it said about the 17th or in our
[17:07] 18th chapter
[17:08] where it said and his wife hath made
[17:10] herself ready
[17:13] well that's that's a way back
[17:16] you've already get it have gotten
[17:18] eternal life by the new birth
[17:21] and if you die it doesn't make no
[17:23] difference you go by the grave
[17:26] and you'll come up in the resurrection
[17:30] and you don't have to worry about the
[17:32] judgment all right
[17:34] but if you're alive then you remain you
[17:36] know and you can go up
[17:37] in a rapture you don't have to be
[17:40] concerned about but but i want to make
[17:42] sure you get that now
[17:45] i mean you know don't come up later and
[17:48] say well brother dale
[17:49] uh do you think that right now the bride
[17:51] is not going to go before
[17:53] and you know how to stand before the
[17:54] white zone judgment what for
[18:01] that's a decision of eternal life
[18:06] all right you say but then what about
[18:08] this other part
[18:13] that you've read what about standing
[18:15] before the judgment seat of christ
[18:26] see then let's make sure to get it right
[18:27] now and so we we we won't place this one
[18:30] over here and this one over here
[18:31] see then there is two judgments one of
[18:34] them is called the bema judgment i don't
[18:36] know what the other one is but anyhow it
[18:38] doesn't matter to me because
[18:39] i just know what the big greek word
[18:41] ain't gonna spell nothing
[18:44] it's a revelation from god to realize
[18:48] that we do not have to go
[18:50] before the white room what a wonderful
[18:53] opportunity
[18:54] amen what about a new birth and what it
[18:56] it does for you and i
[18:58] mean it gives us eternal life right here
[19:02] now
[19:03] we don't have to wait and go somewhere
[19:05] to be judged to finally decide whether
[19:07] we can go to heaven or not
[19:10] amen because
[19:14] the born-again experience new birth
[19:18] gives you eternal life now
[19:23] and see you become the christ the same
[19:26] as he's the christ
[19:29] all right and sit with him amen
[19:33] you've become the anointed he's anointed
[19:35] we've anointed him
[19:36] we're the bride of christ what a
[19:38] wonderful opportunity
[19:39] to be able to think about eternal life
[19:44] and the fact of that eternal life being
[19:46] to you and i that we don't have to go
[19:48] before any judgment to receive it
[19:50] it's already set here when you accept
[19:52] jesus christ
[19:55] all right i keep saying that i want you
[19:57] to hear that
[19:58] because i don't want no question to that
[20:00] point i don't mean i don't you know i'm
[20:02] glad i always try to answer a question
[20:04] but i'm just saying if we get it right
[20:07] then we won't be thinking about it
[20:08] but get what goes with what
[20:12] all right there is according to the
[20:14] bible
[20:16] the book of revelations in the book of
[20:18] daniel a great white throne judgment
[20:22] all right that is according to the bible
[20:27] and that is sitting there to be
[20:28] determined whether or not
[20:30] and it's got books books plural
[20:36] right you've gotten books at each one of
[20:40] those
[20:40] the you know revelations and daniel
[20:44] books plural why because there's deeds
[20:47] there that's done in the body
[20:53] and those books will show what we are
[20:57] all right but then there's a book there
[21:01] that is called the book of life
[21:06] right i mean that's a great white throne
[21:09] judgment now
[21:10] there will be a book of life
[21:16] and if your name is in that book
[21:19] then you have an opportunity to receive
[21:21] eternal life
[21:22] at that judgment but if your name's not
[21:25] in the book
[21:27] amen then there is no chance of judgment
[21:31] for you
[21:31] it's all finished it's done
[21:35] you don't have no court of appeal
[21:39] it won't be that we could go before the
[21:41] great white throne and say yeah but lord
[21:43] look what i've done look what i've done
[21:44] look what happened here
[21:45] look how i've done this i've done that
[21:47] if you're to watch on judgment there's
[21:49] no mercy
[21:52] it is turned from um the fact of you
[21:55] being
[21:57] totally lost and god then can take your
[22:00] place
[22:01] so don't think i don't know the message
[22:03] don't think i don't know that i can
[22:05] you know i can read i i know where
[22:08] brother branham said it probably about
[22:10] 35 or 40 times of that man that uh
[22:14] stands out there you know and and and
[22:16] jesus has to come and stand in his place
[22:18] and
[22:19] he took my place and but that's not the
[22:21] white throne
[22:23] that's the reason i want you to see it
[22:26] and dwell on it heavily
[22:28] to where you can see it paul what was
[22:31] his name paul ryan or
[22:32] anyhow it was it was the guy you know
[22:35] about the
[22:36] riding the log and going into camp and
[22:38] things
[22:42] but just remember
[22:46] that's not though that's not the white
[22:49] throne
[22:50] right because you don't go to the white
[22:52] throne as
[22:54] bride of christ
[22:57] [Music]
[23:00] you can't do that you can't put the
[23:01] bride at the white throne
[23:04] we see you say well we've got all of
[23:05] these quotes here about it that this one
[23:08] man well that's good
[23:12] but be careful how you're placing that
[23:16] because it does say that jesus comes up
[23:18] and stands there
[23:19] somebody took my place well if somebody
[23:23] took my place
[23:24] then that meant i was a born-again
[23:26] believer
[23:29] right that's what he's doing taking my
[23:31] place
[23:33] all right but not just because if you
[23:35] can read that
[23:37] and see that this story is told over and
[23:39] over by the prophet
[23:41] of a judgment seat and having to be
[23:43] standing there
[23:45] and you have a court of appeal that you
[23:47] can appeal to the white throne
[23:48] but remember it's not a court of appeal
[23:51] to the white throne
[23:54] what are you going to appeal to
[23:58] who are you going to appeal to
[24:02] so then it's not the prophet explaining
[24:04] it to where he's doing that was he's
[24:07] explaining the other one
[24:10] i want you to get that don't make make
[24:12] sure you keep it in your mind
[24:13] he's explaining the judgment seat of
[24:16] christ
[24:18] not to watch on because there's no
[24:21] record of the white throne to where he
[24:23] to where that he stands in place with
[24:25] somebody now i know the difference in
[24:27] the goats and the sheep and i know what
[24:29] i'm talking about in that
[24:30] all right so we can read that they will
[24:33] be
[24:34] at the white throne judgment goats and
[24:36] sheep but remember
[24:40] goats are sinners that are lost
[24:44] sheep at the white throne are not the
[24:47] bride
[24:49] that's your foolish virgin that can be
[24:50] given eternal life
[24:53] that's those that will receive eternal
[24:55] life at the white throne judgment
[24:59] because of their deeds done in the body
[25:02] all right so we're covering it each one
[25:05] each one each one
[25:06] each one all right now so do you
[25:09] understand what i'm saying
[25:11] at that white throne
[25:14] it will not be a a uh just a regular
[25:19] judgment it will be a judgment seat
[25:22] that we sit on that judgment seat with
[25:24] him judging others according to the
[25:26] bible
[25:26] where he says fear not you you know what
[25:28] are you thinking about it you're judging
[25:30] this you're judging it
[25:31] he said we judge angels the bible says
[25:34] we judge angels
[25:37] and why should we try to judge each
[25:38] other
[25:40] what right do we have to judge each
[25:42] other what thoughts are
[25:44] or things could come into our mind it
[25:46] would consider the fact of trying to
[25:48] judge
[25:48] each other are you trying to be
[25:51] something that
[25:52] you're thinking somebody done something
[25:53] against you and boy you're gonna get
[25:55] even with them at the white throne
[25:57] better be careful there's two two sides
[25:59] at that white drum
[26:01] one side is sitting out there and the
[26:03] other side is sitting up on the throne
[26:05] so you better be careful which one don't
[26:07] get on the wrong side
[26:11] you understand what i'm saying
[26:15] so let's don't start judging each other
[26:17] see we're not to judge each other
[26:18] the bible says don't take a brother to
[26:22] law
[26:24] well no no no no brother today we what
[26:26] we need to
[26:27] keep this clear with w what the bible
[26:29] said i didn't say it
[26:33] why does it say it that way because
[26:35] brothers should were sisters whatever
[26:37] just saying it always
[26:38] you should be able to work out your
[26:40] problems without having to go to court
[26:43] that's right now i'm i'm preaching
[26:46] so if you think i'm talking about you
[26:48] that's who i'm talking about
[26:51] okay
[26:54] now come on didn't get it straight let's
[26:56] don't play games
[26:59] he said well what we're going to do
[27:00] somebody owes us this out of the other
[27:02] well are you going to try to figure out
[27:04] whether that's a brother or not
[27:08] you know are you going to
[27:09] de-christianize everybody that goes
[27:11] against you
[27:14] are you going to put them at the white
[27:16] throne and you sitting in front of them
[27:18] that's not the christian attitude the
[27:21] christian attitude should be of the
[27:22] bride of christ
[27:23] to be able to stand there and say
[27:26] come on i can quote brother branham he
[27:28] said do you remember that helped you do
[27:30] this they have
[27:31] you know something something once and
[27:33] something went wrong you've done this
[27:35] you know
[27:40] but my point is this to try to get you
[27:43] to lay it down in our thoughts
[27:46] what is the judgment seat of christ
[27:54] what is the judgment seat of christ when
[27:57] we know it's not the white throne
[27:58] judgment
[28:01] that we know for sure right that's all
[28:03] we spend all this time trying to define
[28:05] that point
[28:06] and then we'll read some into what the
[28:07] prophet said to where
[28:09] it won't be what i've said but then what
[28:12] is the judgment
[28:13] seat of christ
[28:17] i had a brother here one time trying to
[28:19] preach on marriage and divorce
[28:22] and he said your marriage and divorce
[28:23] problem was gone by the new birth and i
[28:25] come right back to this pulpit and said
[28:27] that's wrong
[28:31] you don't you don't put your your your
[28:33] problems like that
[28:36] you know but i thought the new birth
[28:39] cleared me the new birth clears us
[28:43] make sure we don't go to hell
[28:49] it sets us free yes
[28:52] but just remember as we get down to the
[28:55] scripture
[28:56] some men's sins go before some follow
[28:59] after
[29:01] if they go before they're wiped away if
[29:03] they follow after
[29:05] what is left to follow after yeah but
[29:08] that's just where you don't believe in
[29:10] grace
[29:11] i believe in grace but not disgrace
[29:14] i don't believe it's all right for me to
[29:15] live like the devil but i'm a
[29:18] claim to everybody to be a christian but
[29:26] see that's why
[29:27] to me i have to be straight and blunt
[29:29] okay
[29:31] maybe you've had trouble maybe you've
[29:32] had problems that's for you to figure
[29:35] out and to do and to get straight and do
[29:37] yours
[29:37] but just make sure you don't have
[29:39] nothing left over
[29:43] because there is a judgment seat of
[29:44] christ
[29:47] and the prophet says it and the bible
[29:49] says
[29:50] that we'll all have to stand before the
[29:52] judgment seat of christ
[29:55] brother you just don't understand the
[29:57] new birth takes care of everything
[29:59] does it
[30:02] may i quote the prophet
[30:06] when the woman said but i was confessed
[30:08] that sin to god
[30:14] right what did the prophet say
[30:18] but you didn't sin against god in that
[30:20] adulterous act
[30:21] you sinned against your husband
[30:24] you've got to go to him first see we got
[30:28] it right we got to understand and we
[30:29] know where we're standing
[30:31] so don't play with it
[30:34] but you see we think we can do this and
[30:36] we can do that
[30:38] but brother dale my lord you've been so
[30:40] hateful lately
[30:41] you've just brought out every bit of the
[30:43] things and and just stomped our feet and
[30:46] and just you know
[30:50] well one of these days you'll pat me on
[30:52] the back
[30:54] and say thank you amen
[30:57] you'll do it you see i don't have to
[31:00] worry about it
[31:03] because the truth is the truth
[31:09] i have to say it like it is like the
[31:11] other day when i was preaching so hard
[31:12] about tithing
[31:13] i have to say it like it is
[31:17] you see everybody thinks that i say
[31:18] things because it
[31:20] helps me no no probably hinder me
[31:23] more than anything else because you know
[31:27] some people will get up and walk out
[31:28] eventually
[31:31] because they can't stand it
[31:36] see if you think that your new birth
[31:37] took care of your marital problems
[31:41] you're in trouble
[31:45] all sin is without the body except
[31:47] fornication which is of the body
[31:51] what does that mean that's what the
[31:54] bible says
[31:56] all right it means in simple plain
[31:58] language
[32:01] all sin can be forgiven
[32:06] but there's ways that are withholding
[32:09] for us to be able to get rid of those
[32:10] problems
[32:11] and that's why it's so serious
[32:15] if you sinned against your wife or
[32:16] sinned against your husband
[32:19] you've got to go to them first yeah but
[32:21] i went to god
[32:22] god won't listen to you now that's what
[32:24] your prophet said
[32:29] you see that way i'm trying to save your
[32:31] soul
[32:36] and like i was talking about even like
[32:37] tithing we've run around said that
[32:39] little girl
[32:40] or that person took some money and said
[32:43] god held it against him
[32:47] see we're serving a just god we're not
[32:49] serving to just
[32:50] play around haphazardly the little bitty
[32:53] things the little foxes is what's
[32:55] spoiling
[32:56] our vines
[32:59] right but you understand that
[33:03] you see what i'm talking about the bride
[33:04] does not go before the white throne
[33:06] judgment
[33:07] she sits on the white throne judgment
[33:09] judging others so things have got to be
[33:11] made right by then
[33:14] now i'm as serious as i can be about it
[33:16] i want somebody to show me
[33:17] i want to know whether this judgment
[33:19] seat of christ comes in that
[33:21] and where it takes place because i can't
[33:23] place it
[33:25] i know that it would have to be before
[33:28] the white throne
[33:34] maybe somebody can help me with it to
[33:35] understand it all right but i know it's
[33:37] got to be
[33:38] the judgment seat of christ has got to
[33:39] be before the white throne
[33:41] because there would be no way for you to
[33:43] sit at the white throne
[33:45] on the seat next to christ with sin in
[33:47] your life something
[33:48] that you didn't get right here so it'll
[33:51] have to be before the white throne
[33:55] i do know that much
[33:58] now i'm going to say this and i know i'm
[34:01] i ain't going to get through
[34:02] but i'm going to say this plane
[34:06] this right here is more valuable than
[34:09] you ever thought of
[34:12] is the stature of a perfect man
[34:15] that message is more valuable than you
[34:17] ever thought of in your life you ought
[34:18] to wire the book out
[34:20] or the tape
[34:23] because you see that's exactly what's
[34:25] taking place right now
[34:29] that's doing away with my sins
[34:34] that's doing away with what sins i've
[34:36] got yeah but a christian don't say
[34:38] christians is the only one that can sin
[34:40] come on i know the prophet i've got it
[34:42] laying right here before but one
[34:44] one quote he says directly sins
[34:46] christians do not sin
[34:47] you cannot sin as a christian
[34:50] then he turns around and says a
[34:52] christian is the only one that can sin
[34:56] now what are you going to do that's
[34:59] right
[34:59] well i you know i just don't i don't
[35:01] understand you say one thing then
[35:03] another
[35:04] i say what the prophet said
[35:07] i'm saying what the bible says there are
[35:09] two judgments in the bible
[35:13] one of them is the great white throne
[35:14] judgment
[35:18] the other one is a judgment of the deeds
[35:19] done in the body whether good or bad
[35:21] at the judgment seat of christ
[35:28] right but i want to make sure my sins go
[35:31] before me
[35:32] amen right because if it go before me
[35:36] whether it be my marriage and divorce
[35:38] whether it be my line cheating stealing
[35:40] whatever it be
[35:43] if it goes before and it's done away by
[35:46] the blood of jesus christ
[35:47] then god is
[35:51] swipe to clean this yet slate clean
[35:57] and there won't be no great white throne
[35:59] judgment for you to set out
[36:02] that's why brother branham said it this
[36:04] way he said
[36:05] make sure let's see all right i'll get
[36:09] to it in a second
[36:09] he said make sure you don't mess up the
[36:12] rapture
[36:16] with the judgment seat
[36:19] because you see if you go in a rapture
[36:23] that's over a thousand years before the
[36:26] judgment seat of christ
[36:27] i mean before the the white throne
[36:29] judgment comes into being
[36:33] if you're going in the rapture all
[36:37] things will be made right
[36:40] or we're not going do you understand
[36:46] do you understand what i'm getting at if
[36:49] we don't get everything right here
[36:51] there will be a seat somewhere that we
[36:53] have to to stand there
[36:55] and be judged of the deeds done in the
[36:58] body whether good or bad
[37:03] they'll be rewards or are
[37:07] taking away of rewards
[37:15] you see that's why it's so hard for me
[37:17] to to drive it i've got to drive it down
[37:19] to where it can't be the
[37:21] the devil can come in and pick it apart
[37:24] but drive it so hard but yet not try to
[37:26] drive the center
[37:28] i'm not against anything you've done in
[37:30] your life or what you're doing
[37:31] that ain't to me that's between you and
[37:33] god
[37:35] but if i can do anything i can to try to
[37:37] help you to get you to the point
[37:39] i want to get rid of all of my sin yeah
[37:42] but i didn't know a christian could sin
[37:43] there's a difference in sin there is a
[37:46] sin that is under death you don't even
[37:48] pray for that one
[37:50] so there's a difference in the word sin
[37:54] so the prophet says in one place the
[37:56] bride cannot sin
[38:01] he didn't say she won't and then pro now
[38:04] he says she cannot
[38:07] but in another place he says she is the
[38:10] only one that can sin because a sinner
[38:12] is condemned on a higher level
[38:16] right
[38:20] so then we got to define sin
[38:25] sin is not drinking gambling smoking
[38:27] running around with him and adultery
[38:29] uh uh you know all kind of things
[38:33] that's not sin
[38:37] but what is sin unbelief
[38:41] there is no unbelief in the bride of
[38:44] jesus christ
[38:46] because she cannot disbelieve because
[38:49] christ in her cannot do it
[38:56] but when it turns the other way what
[38:58] does it do we all have
[39:00] problems in the flesh
[39:06] galatians 5
[39:10] tells you the works of the flesh
[39:16] is adultery this that or the other names
[39:18] it all all kind of fun
[39:20] right envy strife
[39:23] galatians 5 but the works
[39:26] no works
[39:30] is no good but the fruit of the spirit
[39:33] is love joy peace good news he puts them
[39:36] right there and the same chapter talks
[39:38] about the
[39:40] the fruit of the spirit being loved joy
[39:41] peace statue of a perfect man
[39:45] but the works of the flesh
[39:48] a christian has works of the flesh
[39:57] their fruits of the spirit covers the
[39:59] inward part
[40:00] of them and keeps them from being lost
[40:03] but it still doesn't cover all of the
[40:08] works
[40:11] well i'll tell you what i ask god every
[40:13] day to forgive me i do too
[40:16] but what about all them things you
[40:17] forgot about
[40:19] now don't tell me that don't let's don't
[40:21] play pretty badly you know a little bit
[40:23] with me i don't
[40:25] let's be straight
[40:30] you realize if you think something wrong
[40:32] today
[40:34] that can be placed under the category of
[40:36] sin
[40:42] have you asked god to forgive you
[40:48] for thinking wrong
[40:53] beside the point of doing wrong
[40:56] right yeah right you know what i mean
[41:00] you say well brother dale i don't do
[41:01] wrong you just did you lied
[41:07] that solves that problem
[41:10] see because we're human mortal beings
[41:13] that's why we must have an
[41:15] advocate according the scripture says
[41:18] which is jesus christ the righteous to
[41:20] stand in place for you and i
[41:23] well if we're so white slate clean what
[41:25] do we need an advocate
[41:31] well you making it like that the blood
[41:33] of jesus christ don't do about
[41:34] well everything it don't do away with
[41:37] unconfessed sin
[41:44] unconfessed unbelief
[41:50] unconfessed unbelief
[41:53] don't have to be answered for here or
[41:54] there one
[42:00] works of the flesh
[42:07] but fruits of the spirit
[42:11] the christians have fruits of the spirit
[42:15] love joy
[42:19] but we don't want to have work for the
[42:21] spirit
[42:23] did you get that one we better not have
[42:26] works
[42:27] of the spirit that's crossing it up and
[42:30] messing it up we can have
[42:32] works of the flesh we can do things
[42:35] wrong
[42:36] in the flesh but still not be lost in
[42:39] our spirit
[42:45] but somewhere that has to be accounted
[42:47] for
[42:50] well if i got something to be accounted
[42:52] for i thought the blood of jesus christ
[42:53] counted for everything
[42:55] i thought she was listening while ago
[42:57] when the prophet said don't
[43:00] mix up the rapture with the great white
[43:04] throne
[43:08] what's his meaning the rapture
[43:12] is on this side of the white throne
[43:14] there's not going to be any judgment of
[43:16] the bride at jesus
[43:18] right sitting at the white throne
[43:25] the sins the things that we we we don't
[43:29] count as sin but have you ever just
[43:32] really read that
[43:37] have you ever really read it i ain't
[43:39] going to get that way but i'll
[43:40] i'll get part of it let's go over to
[43:42] galatians
[43:44] if they want to get that way if they
[43:45] don't we'll we'll read it
[43:49] galatians 5.
[44:00] listen to what paul has to say about it
[44:06] um
[44:11] verse 13 we'll start from there for
[44:13] brethren
[44:14] you have been called unto liberty only
[44:17] use not liberty
[44:19] for an occasion to the flesh
[44:23] now he's stating it right
[44:27] but by love serve one another
[44:31] for all the law was fulfilled in one
[44:32] word even
[44:34] this thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[44:36] thyself
[44:37] if thou bite and devour one another
[44:40] take heed that you be not consumed
[44:44] one of another now watching
[44:48] for the flesh lusts us against the
[44:50] spirit
[44:56] and the spirit against the flesh
[45:02] huh now follow
[45:04] it
[45:08] and these are contrary to one to the
[45:10] other so that you cannot do the things
[45:13] that you would but if we be
[45:17] led of the spirit ye are not
[45:20] under the law now watch
[45:23] now the works of the flesh
[45:27] are manifest which are these now follow
[45:30] these but don't get your mind in
[45:32] so dead set of a hard thing because take
[45:35] these
[45:35] and bring them down to our everyday life
[45:40] i mean we're not supposed to be talking
[45:41] about people that's doing
[45:43] dealing in adultery or witchcraft
[45:46] or bad hatred or heresies or but take
[45:49] and break these words down in simple
[45:51] language
[45:54] right now the works
[45:57] of the flesh are manifest which are
[46:00] these
[46:02] adultery well i don't commit adultery
[46:10] you want to get it down low enough you
[46:13] want to get it down girls wear your
[46:15] clothes and things like that you call
[46:16] somebody to commit adultery with you
[46:18] that's right ladies
[46:24] oh but see that's where you're going but
[46:27] but i'm not i'm breaking words down
[46:33] to plain language adultery
[46:37] fornication oh i don't commit no
[46:40] fornication
[46:42] go look that up go run it through the
[46:44] scripture and see what fornication
[46:46] really is
[46:49] it's not going out in adulterous acts
[46:51] and things
[46:53] paul is talking to christians
[46:57] forgive me for being smart
[47:00] paul is speaking to christians not to
[47:03] sinners
[47:04] in galatians 5.
[47:10] so listen uncleanness just break that
[47:14] word all night all the way down
[47:17] lasciviousness
[47:22] which is simply just dispute
[47:26] envyings oh i don't have no envies
[47:31] murderer i'm not a murderer brother dale
[47:35] if you do you destroy somebody's name
[47:38] you've murdered them
[47:40] that's how simple the word can be down
[47:42] to
[47:43] you make fun make light you've murdered
[47:47] come on drunkenness
[47:51] i don't drink brother tail no i take a
[47:54] little nip every once in a while
[47:55] wouldn't it
[47:58] revealings and such like of the which i
[48:01] tell you before
[48:03] as i have also told you in time times
[48:06] that they which do these things
[48:11] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[48:18] that's pretty serious
[48:21] [Music]
[48:23] but the fruit of the spirit
[48:27] see not works of the spirit fruit of the
[48:29] spirit
[48:31] love joy peace long suffering gentleness
[48:34] meekness temperance
[48:36] against such there is no law
[48:40] and what's not and they that are christ
[48:43] have crucified the flesh with the
[48:45] affections and lust
[48:49] sometimes just take a few minutes and
[48:51] sit down
[48:52] and take the dictionary
[48:57] and look up and just read these look up
[49:01] what
[49:03] these things mean and see if there's any
[49:07] of them in our lives
[49:13] right now see if we have any works
[49:17] we all want fruits of the spirit right
[49:21] it's not works of the spirit it's works
[49:24] of the flesh
[49:27] all right now let's define what the
[49:28] prophet is saying
[49:30] a born-again christian cannot sin
[49:33] from the soul
[49:38] done right a born-again christian
[49:42] cannot sin from the soul so where does
[49:45] the rest of it start off at
[49:46] go back up and read the first sign
[49:51] where did we have it uh
[49:59] or brethren you have been called unto
[50:01] liberty
[50:02] only use not liberty for an occasion in
[50:04] the flesh but by love serve one another
[50:10] but if you bite into devour take heed
[50:14] that you be not consumed one of another
[50:19] see church our lives are very vital now
[50:22] let me put it on this end of the scale
[50:24] where you want lose me
[50:30] paul was talking there about
[50:33] eating or drinking basically eating
[50:37] things that was sacrificed to idols
[50:42] you remember that all right
[50:45] now he says if it offend my brother for
[50:49] me to eat meat
[50:52] he said i won't eat no more meat
[51:02] but yet he turned around and said he
[51:03] said now listen the idol is nothing and
[51:04] all these other things
[51:05] he said in other words the one person
[51:07] who eats he eats when faith and no
[51:09] problem the other one eats in doubt
[51:14] so what is it
[51:18] it's not wrong to eat something that was
[51:20] offered to an idol
[51:23] because we know the idol is nothing
[51:27] but who it is you don't want to offend
[51:31] your brother or sister that's standing
[51:34] by
[51:36] and then you say well bless god it don't
[51:38] bother me to eat these things
[51:41] anybody that eats that that
[51:44] that it thinks it's a bother to them
[51:46] they they need to be getting straight
[51:48] no you're the one that needs to be
[51:49] getting straight because no matter what
[51:52] it is the attitude's wrong
[51:54] come on right the simple attitude of the
[51:58] heart the words of the mouth is from the
[52:00] attitude of the heart
[52:07] brother dale you you talk like that that
[52:09] there's no grace
[52:12] grace is unmerited favor we agree
[52:19] but grace is not disgrace
[52:27] remember when you say well well what
[52:29] right that brother he ought to get saved
[52:31] he ought to get straightened out
[52:32] because bless god it don't bother me
[52:34] with him things
[52:40] but what kind of an attitude have you
[52:42] got
[52:45] you shouldn't be doing that that's why
[52:47] paul said it if it offend my brother for
[52:49] me to eat meat he
[52:50] also won't eat no more meat
[52:53] what do you have he had a christian
[52:54] attitude right
[52:57] a christian part of his life
[53:00] that he was concerned with others i
[53:03] thought we were to be living a christian
[53:05] was to be living for others i thought
[53:07] that was the point of christianity
[53:09] was to be living for others
[53:17] and see then that way you can understand
[53:19] how that we can have
[53:21] works of the flesh
[53:26] we have wrong thoughts i ain't going to
[53:29] wait a second want to go don't raise
[53:30] your hand
[53:31] don't raise your hand if for me to ask
[53:33] you said if you had a that bad thought
[53:35] today
[53:36] i'm not going to we don't need to go
[53:38] that way because we know we had because
[53:40] we just
[53:40] all of us just we just stick our hands
[53:42] up and say forget it because
[53:47] but you see that's what we're looking at
[53:50] most people are thinking christianity is
[53:52] giving you a right to do and
[53:53] and whatever you want to do and just
[53:55] whatever takes place it doesn't matter
[53:57] because you're a christian
[53:58] now where's that in the bible what kind
[54:00] of a attitude is that
[54:02] which one of those words would it fit
[54:03] under the works of the flesh
[54:05] fornications or adulteries or whatever
[54:10] i remember one time i was talking to
[54:11] brother molten brother george
[54:13] canada one day about something and we
[54:15] were talking i said well the bible said
[54:17] if you're
[54:18] not having to do with idolatry
[54:21] and they said that's right i said that
[54:23] that means
[54:25] idolatry it don't mean
[54:28] i doubt it means my eyes is dollar
[54:30] turned all over the place
[54:33] idolatry idol
[54:37] idol you ever noticed that the way it's
[54:41] spelled
[54:42] idolatry i-d-o-l that's idols that's
[54:46] images that's
[54:47] things you make that's
[54:50] idolatry or the idolatry either way
[54:56] these churches we should be so concerned
[54:58] about each other until our lives are
[55:01] based upon trying to not be a hindrance
[55:03] to anybody but to be a help to one
[55:05] another
[55:11] but yeah we want to as i said about our
[55:13] unit the other day we want to blame
[55:15] the other person somebody do something
[55:17] wrong to us we ought to go get that
[55:20] straight in a hurry because if you don't
[55:22] a few days later you're going to start
[55:24] thinking well you know i wasn't too bad
[55:27] give you about two weeks later you're
[55:29] gonna find out that that other guy or
[55:30] the other
[55:31] lady or sister or whatever you're going
[55:33] to find out that other person was the
[55:34] one that was guilty and you didn't have
[55:35] nothing to do with it
[55:36] use a sweet darling little old thing
[55:40] right we start blaming everybody else
[55:44] for our own problems
[55:49] where's that fit in the line of
[55:50] christianity
[55:54] do you understand what i'm saying then
[55:58] a judgment seat
[56:02] to give an account of the deeds done in
[56:04] the body whether good or bad
[56:07] where's that taking place at
[56:15] it's got to be before the white throne
[56:16] we can go over that away
[56:19] but you know what i kind of believe it's
[56:21] right now
[56:24] you know i kind of believe that this is
[56:26] why god has given us this time
[56:30] that we should have been i've been out
[56:31] here a long time ago
[56:34] we should have been in a rapture 20 30
[56:36] years ago
[56:39] i was proving that in 1974.
[56:46] we should have been getting out of here
[56:47] a long time ago
[56:51] but could it be that we won't get our we
[56:54] won't get straight
[56:56] could it be that our works of the flesh
[57:02] is overriding our
[57:06] christian life what about it
[57:14] let's just read these now though go
[57:17] ahead brother to number
[57:20] number one we'll just read down through
[57:21] on these
[57:25] all right because what number one is
[57:28] covered is
[57:30] the white throne judgment the book of
[57:32] daniel
[57:34] which is the same as revelations 20. now
[57:37] you understand me we've started with
[57:38] that scripture that there'll be a white
[57:40] throne judgment
[57:44] all right and that is for the deeds done
[57:47] in the body
[57:51] of white throne judgment okay daniel
[57:54] covers it
[57:55] said i beheld till the drones were cast
[57:57] down and the anointed
[57:59] and the ancient of days did sit whose
[58:02] garment was white as snow
[58:04] and the hair of his head like pure wool
[58:07] his strong was like the fiery flame
[58:09] and his wheels as burning fire
[58:12] a fiery stream issued and came from
[58:14] before him
[58:16] thousands thousands ministered unto him
[58:21] and then ten thousand times ten thousand
[58:24] stood before him
[58:25] the judgment was set and the books were
[58:28] opened
[58:30] the same thing that that john covers
[58:35] on the isle of patmos so that's a white
[58:38] tron judgment
[58:42] we've covered that we don't sit at the
[58:44] white throne judge i mean don't
[58:46] stand before the whites on judgment we
[58:48] sit on the white throne with him
[58:53] but we also know that we say well what's
[59:02] wrong
[59:04] did the prophet preach a lot of messages
[59:05] about our sin
[59:10] but yet are we so smart are we so uh
[59:15] you know whatever but brother dale i
[59:18] don't sin
[59:23] i don't commit adultery and writes
[59:25] cheating still
[59:30] but take that word and just break it
[59:32] down just a little bit
[59:37] and find out about the works of the
[59:38] flesh
[59:41] all right then when we do we might find
[59:44] out we've all got a lot of problems
[59:54] you had it lately where you somebody run
[59:56] you off the road
[59:59] and they call it road rage
[1:00:02] you get mad
[1:00:06] just a little thing like that or some
[1:00:09] little dirty word
[1:00:12] i had to get onto people here one time
[1:00:14] because they was using some words that i
[1:00:16] don't agree with being used as christian
[1:00:18] language
[1:00:20] i don't even like the word dam
[1:00:23] oh that's a water right now but we don't
[1:00:26] the way it's used is not a body of water
[1:00:28] with a wall holding it up
[1:00:31] right
[1:00:36] little simple words that we use and our
[1:00:40] children use them then we get onto the
[1:00:42] children for using them
[1:00:48] well you know what they're just talking
[1:00:49] like mom and daddy
[1:00:56] right see it might be it's good for us
[1:00:59] to just take a couple of months and
[1:01:01] study on the works of the flesh
[1:01:09] of course our problem would be is it
[1:01:12] would wind up being
[1:01:15] no works no flesh because everybody'd be
[1:01:17] leaving because they'd be saying
[1:01:19] brotherdale's picking on me all the time
[1:01:24] well like i said one day
[1:01:27] you'll pat me on the back
[1:01:30] today you might want a knife in your
[1:01:32] hand to stab it
[1:01:34] and to do it but i'm a christian
[1:01:40] i've never done anything wrong brother
[1:01:42] dale now you have never done nothing
[1:01:44] right either because you're just lying
[1:01:45] like crazy
[1:01:48] what about it okay
[1:01:53] romans picks up now so let's go to that
[1:01:55] to number two
[1:01:57] romans 14 10.
[1:02:03] well why dost thou judge thy brother
[1:02:07] or why doest thou set at naught thy
[1:02:10] brother
[1:02:11] for we shall all stand before the
[1:02:15] judgment
[1:02:16] seat of christ
[1:02:20] now that is not the white throne
[1:02:21] judgment that's right
[1:02:25] if you want my idea about it i think
[1:02:27] right now is the greatest judgment time
[1:02:29] that's ever been
[1:02:30] because what does the bible say judgment
[1:02:33] begins
[1:02:34] work at the house of the lord so where
[1:02:37] does it start behind the pulpit
[1:02:40] right look for it is written as i live
[1:02:45] saith the lord
[1:02:46] every knee shall bow to me and every
[1:02:49] tongue shall confess to god
[1:02:56] you mean brother dale we're going to
[1:02:58] have to bow down before god
[1:03:00] we're going to have to uh oh you ghosted
[1:03:03] up
[1:03:05] do you mean if jesus christ walked in
[1:03:06] here right now and you knew it was him
[1:03:08] that you wouldn't bow before him you
[1:03:12] knew it was him now we don't bow before
[1:03:13] devils and demons and things
[1:03:15] but if jesus christ walks here we bow
[1:03:17] before him
[1:03:20] we'd be glad to vow
[1:03:25] right so get it right
[1:03:28] so then every one of us shall give an
[1:03:30] account
[1:03:31] of himself to god
[1:03:38] let us not therefore judge one another
[1:03:40] anymore
[1:03:41] but judge this rather that no man put a
[1:03:44] stumbling block
[1:03:45] or an occasion to fall in his brother's
[1:03:49] way
[1:03:52] don't do something to make your brother
[1:03:54] or a christian don't do something to
[1:03:56] make your children don't do things
[1:03:58] before your children
[1:04:02] just remember the languages they they
[1:04:05] use
[1:04:05] is the language you taught them right
[1:04:09] and if you use words that are vulgar
[1:04:11] words
[1:04:14] your children use those words who do you
[1:04:17] blame them
[1:04:20] well i just i just this little bitty
[1:04:23] words brother their ladies don't mean
[1:04:25] nothing
[1:04:26] i don't mean anything by it so is that
[1:04:30] sinner when he hollers every time he
[1:04:31] hollers jesus christ
[1:04:33] of course you know what i'm talking
[1:04:34] about he puts a lot of other things in
[1:04:35] it
[1:04:37] do you think he's he's oh he ain't being
[1:04:39] bad
[1:04:40] well what's he been
[1:04:45] what about all of us
[1:04:53] go ahead number four
[1:05:00] now don't get the rapture of the church
[1:05:03] and the white throne judgment
[1:05:05] mixed up now why would he say that
[1:05:11] well what do you mean i know the
[1:05:13] difference in the rapture and
[1:05:15] the white throne do you
[1:05:20] watch him what's he covered don't get
[1:05:22] the rapture of the church
[1:05:24] and the white throne judgment mixed up
[1:05:26] because the rapture of the church
[1:05:28] there is no judgment why have we
[1:05:36] been here so long and not gone in a
[1:05:40] rapture
[1:05:42] could it be that we have a lot of works
[1:05:46] for the flesh
[1:05:49] well you know the statue of a perfect
[1:05:50] man is supposed to be working
[1:05:53] from the inside soul out through the
[1:05:56] spirit
[1:05:57] over into the body and bring out a
[1:05:58] different person
[1:06:02] right that statue of a perfect man
[1:06:11] there is no judgment see you don't meet
[1:06:14] it right down
[1:06:15] here don't listen to it you've done meat
[1:06:18] met in other words it right down here
[1:06:21] that's right
[1:06:22] for they which are in the or in christ
[1:06:26] are free from judgment jesus said he
[1:06:30] that heareth
[1:06:31] my words and believeth on him that sent
[1:06:34] me has
[1:06:35] eternal life and shall never come into
[1:06:37] the judgment
[1:06:38] but it's passed from death unto life
[1:06:41] well brother dale that that means it
[1:06:44] just covers
[1:06:45] it means it's covered with what we
[1:06:49] think but what about what he thinks how
[1:06:52] do you do that we come into christ and
[1:06:54] are baptized into one body first
[1:06:55] corinthians 12 one body
[1:06:57] we're baptized into the body of jesus
[1:06:59] christ and god has already judged that
[1:07:02] body
[1:07:03] he could not stand stand us in judgment
[1:07:07] again because he's already judged that
[1:07:09] body
[1:07:10] well that's wonderful but are you
[1:07:14] listening to what he's saying
[1:07:16] why did he say don't mix up the rapture
[1:07:19] with the white throne
[1:07:20] if you're in the rapture there ain't
[1:07:21] going to be no white throne
[1:07:25] that's right do you understand amen
[1:07:29] you understand what he's saying if
[1:07:31] you're in the rapture there ain't going
[1:07:32] to be no what's wrong
[1:07:34] for you to have to stand be you know
[1:07:40] there ain't going to be a white throne
[1:07:42] for a born-again believer
[1:07:44] we sit on the throne with him
[1:07:50] but just remember that maybe while we're
[1:07:53] still here
[1:07:55] maybe when the rapture hasn't taken
[1:07:57] place
[1:08:00] maybe it's because we don't follow the
[1:08:03] line
[1:08:04] to walk in the light of the word
[1:08:15] but brother dale i i i've always been a
[1:08:18] good person
[1:08:19] praise god
[1:08:24] but what about the little things
[1:08:30] i thought the statue of a perfect man
[1:08:32] was to take care of our
[1:08:33] our uh outward beings by the inward
[1:08:37] working
[1:08:38] is that the best way to say it by an
[1:08:40] inward working of salvation from the
[1:08:42] soul out through the spirit
[1:08:44] into the body is supposed to produce a
[1:08:45] christian
[1:08:48] but what if we don't let it
[1:08:54] but brother dale i don't like the way
[1:08:55] you talk
[1:08:57] well would you mind explaining it to me
[1:09:03] who are we blaming for us being here
[1:09:08] 50 years after the going of a prophet
[1:09:12] are we blaming him
[1:09:16] who are we to blame
[1:09:26] oh it's quiet don't it
[1:09:33] you see why he's making an emphasis
[1:09:37] don't mix up that white throne
[1:09:41] and the rapture because if you go
[1:09:44] in the rapture there's not going to be
[1:09:47] any
[1:09:48] amen amen
[1:09:52] so maybe right now is the time we ought
[1:09:57] to be considering
[1:09:59] to think about the judgment of the deeds
[1:10:02] done in the body whether good or bad
[1:10:09] maybe we want to consider right now as
[1:10:11] the time that we have an opportunity
[1:10:13] to get rid of our works of the flesh
[1:10:23] and to get down to a sweet humble spirit
[1:10:27] that loves one another and tries to pray
[1:10:29] for one another and to help each other
[1:10:36] then it won't be any of the works of the
[1:10:37] flesh because that's what we need to get
[1:10:39] rid of
[1:10:42] but it'll be the fruits of the spirit of
[1:10:45] love
[1:10:45] joy and
[1:10:52] you see what i'm talking about
[1:10:57] works fruits
[1:11:05] if we go in a rapture we'll have to
[1:11:08] close it off because i can't go
[1:11:10] much further if we go in a rapture
[1:11:18] now you're gonna play hayward with
[1:11:22] words but i can't do nothing but talk
[1:11:24] and preach
[1:11:25] whatever our problems are
[1:11:29] we'll be dealing with works of the flesh
[1:11:34] right so read the works of the flesh and
[1:11:37] see if you have any of them
[1:11:39] but read it with a sensible human
[1:11:41] thinking
[1:11:43] fornication well i i've never committed
[1:11:46] fornication
[1:11:50] according to the book of revelations the
[1:11:53] old catholic church is covered with
[1:11:55] fornication
[1:11:57] and that we are part of that until we
[1:11:59] get out of that
[1:12:02] that's fornication ain't unclean living
[1:12:06] out here of adulteries and things in our
[1:12:07] life
[1:12:08] it's unclean living in ourselves
[1:12:12] it's thoughts and ideas what's wrong
[1:12:14] with you and me what's wrong with me
[1:12:17] thoughts you don't ever repent of your
[1:12:21] thoughts
[1:12:22] amen
[1:12:26] well that was a devil that made me do
[1:12:27] that i don't have to repent
[1:12:30] where'd you get that from
[1:12:41] what about it
[1:12:48] works could that be what's causing us to
[1:12:51] have to go by the grave
[1:12:58] so you see what the prophet is talking
[1:13:00] about don't mix up the white throne with
[1:13:02] the
[1:13:03] rapture keep them in place
[1:13:08] rapture got to come before the white
[1:13:10] throne
[1:13:12] because we're going to sit on the white
[1:13:13] throne with him
[1:13:18] and the rapture is not a bunch of group
[1:13:20] of people
[1:13:22] that are just living like the devil but
[1:13:24] yet they claimed
[1:13:26] like i said well brother dale uh
[1:13:29] brother so-and-so said it and i believe
[1:13:31] it i believe that that when i got born
[1:13:33] again i've done away with my marriage
[1:13:34] and
[1:13:34] divorce problems
[1:13:38] i want the scripture i want the prophet
[1:13:44] repentance is what does away with them
[1:13:47] things i want you to get that in the
[1:13:49] next few minutes then we'll quit
[1:13:51] repentance
[1:13:57] but it's so hard like a man said down at
[1:14:01] work one day
[1:14:02] he was lying about he said to say i'm
[1:14:04] sorry he said that's cheap talk
[1:14:06] he said of course you got problems
[1:14:09] because chief talk means you're tied up
[1:14:11] with a lawyer and the lawyers are many
[1:14:13] very expensive and i just died alive and
[1:14:15] i thought
[1:14:16] that's a pretty good point you know
[1:14:20] but just study these things then we'll
[1:14:24] take this up next week
[1:14:28] works see if you have any of them
[1:14:35] check it out in your life and see if you
[1:14:36] have any of them
[1:14:38] do you ever get a little bit mad because
[1:14:39] somebody said something about you or to
[1:14:41] you
[1:14:44] well i'd tell them off if i wasn't a
[1:14:45] christian now
[1:14:48] what kind of an attitude is that you
[1:14:49] might as well go ahead and tell them all
[1:14:52] because you just did
[1:14:55] right you might as well just go ahead
[1:14:57] and say it because you just did
[1:15:02] but church i'm trying to get me and you
[1:15:03] to look at one time
[1:15:09] there is a judgment seat of christ
[1:15:13] that we will all have to stand before
[1:15:16] now i've got the prophet here he said
[1:15:18] all
[1:15:20] all of us will stand before he said i'll
[1:15:22] have to stand get it just run that in
[1:15:24] judgment seat of christ and see how many
[1:15:25] times he talked to
[1:15:27] and see how that he would say now i'm
[1:15:29] standing here in this congregation today
[1:15:31] i said now this brother or this sister
[1:15:33] standing here beside me he said
[1:15:35] i don't know him or whatever i don't
[1:15:38] don't you know what said now
[1:15:40] if if he can take over then something
[1:15:43] else can work and
[1:15:44] first thing you know he'd be just
[1:15:49] talking about well yeah i see you're a
[1:15:52] christian
[1:15:54] why because he could pick that up
[1:15:59] but did he say it covered everything
[1:16:05] do you think being a christian gives you
[1:16:08] a right to go out and do
[1:16:18] anything
[1:16:20] well i didn't know it was so simple i
[1:16:22] thought it was big things that we done
[1:16:25] the little foxes spoil the vine
[1:16:31] so what is it
[1:16:34] we'll read these others next week and
[1:16:36] feel more with it because
[1:16:39] but the main thing to talk about is one
[1:16:41] thing
[1:16:45] if i have a wrong attitude
[1:16:50] towards you
[1:16:55] then i've always been one thing
[1:16:59] please forgive me and don't bother me
[1:17:03] for you to come tell me
[1:17:04] i don't like you brother dale
[1:17:07] you got problems say well i know that
[1:17:11] now let's get down how to get rid of
[1:17:12] them you know
[1:17:16] but you see don't never try to hide
[1:17:17] nothing
[1:17:19] just be what you are
[1:17:23] because at least that way you have an
[1:17:25] opportunity
[1:17:27] then you can start dealing with things
[1:17:29] and think about what do you think about
[1:17:31] what i've said today
[1:17:34] that there's two judgments there's a
[1:17:36] judgment of the white throne
[1:17:39] but there's a judgment of the deeds done
[1:17:41] in the body whether good or bad
[1:17:45] now we don't all mankind don't stand
[1:17:48] before the white throne
[1:17:51] right all of them don't have to stand
[1:17:54] before the white throne in some time
[1:17:57] you say well yeah they do this what sure
[1:17:58] they do because they're sinners
[1:18:02] what you see church we don't have to go
[1:18:04] to the white throne
[1:18:07] but why do we not want our lives right
[1:18:09] in our doings today
[1:18:20] you'll read what brother brown is saying
[1:18:21] he said if i offend or if i say this or
[1:18:23] that or the other
[1:18:24] thing he said i want to make that right
[1:18:28] he was sincere wasn't he he said i want
[1:18:31] it to be right
[1:18:33] i don't want no trouble it comes down to
[1:18:36] the river i want everything to be clear
[1:18:38] come on musician i want everything to be
[1:18:40] clear i want it all to be right
[1:18:43] right here so maybe now
[1:18:46] i'm ending it with this thought we'll
[1:18:48] pick it back up maybe right now
[1:18:50] is the judgment seat of christ
[1:18:55] because we know it's not a white throne
[1:18:56] or no thing but what it is about now
[1:19:02] if we judge ourselves that's why i like
[1:19:05] the communion
[1:19:07] i like to read that in the community if
[1:19:09] we judge ourselves then we'll not be
[1:19:11] judged
[1:19:15] well see we think well i want to keep
[1:19:17] that head you're not hiding nothing
[1:19:22] not hiding nothing it's going to come
[1:19:25] out somewhere
[1:19:27] the best thing to do is get out now
[1:19:35] the bride of jesus christ is the most
[1:19:37] wonderful position could ever be thought
[1:19:39] of
[1:19:42] and i have in no way made any reflection
[1:19:45] today in my thinking of trying to
[1:19:48] minister it unto you
[1:19:50] as to think of anything other than a
[1:19:53] born-again believer as being a
[1:19:55] born-again believer
[1:19:57] being a christian but god is not going
[1:20:00] to put us
[1:20:01] in a white throne
[1:20:05] but there is things in our lives that we
[1:20:07] need straight
[1:20:10] the lives we live before others is our
[1:20:13] most important thing
[1:20:17] and to find out that that rapture comes
[1:20:20] before
[1:20:21] the white throne judgment is a marvelous
[1:20:23] thing
[1:20:24] that means you don't have to go there
[1:20:28] because if you're going into rapture
[1:20:32] you're clear go ahead brother what we
[1:20:34] got let's stand
[1:20:35] just sing a verse and we beat
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:55] just remember what we're talking about

[1:22:07] [Applause]
[1:22:08] let's pray one for another keep our
[1:22:11] thoughts and ideas on one time we love
[1:22:13] god because he loved us
[1:22:17] he ain't gonna throw us away that's what
[1:22:20] i loved
[1:22:24] it doesn't matter if there is a judgment
[1:22:26] of the deeds done in the flesh
[1:22:28] and matter if i do have to stand there
[1:22:30] and say lord i've done something wrong
[1:22:32] with my brother
[1:22:33] i didn't get that right let me get it
[1:22:35] right now
