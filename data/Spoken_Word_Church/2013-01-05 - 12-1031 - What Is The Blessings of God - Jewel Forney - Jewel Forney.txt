for you to land than it used to be I said okay so but this this evening we trust God that we and say something in the word of God that'll bless you I'm going to read two places in the scripture brother that brother uh when I got this little message I didn't know at that time I was going to be preaching that brother Colin I said well I said I just preach said Brother Sam and then I ended up preaching for brother Collins so I just went on preach it I said well I still want to preach it for Brother Sam cuz that's my heart was so to see what the Lord do this evening if you got your Bibles we going to read from two places in the scripture one place going to be Deuteronomy the 28th chapter and I'm going to read from St Matthew the 16th chapter deuteron the 28th chapter and the 2 verse I'm going to read one scripture from there and I'm going to read St Matthew the 16th chapter and it reads like this deuteron 28:2 and it says and all these blessings shall come upon thee right and overtake thee if thou shall hearken un the voice of the Lord thy God amen amen St Matthew 16 take methew the 16th chapter and and I want to begin reading at the 15th verse Jesus speaking here he says and he said unto them who say yeah that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou the Christ the son of the Living God right and Jesus answered he said unto him blessed are thy Simon born of Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say Al unto thee thou are Peter and up this rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto these unto thee the the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou sh bound on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou sh loose on Earth shall be loose in heaven let's pray our gracious father I help you one more time to help me to yeld my body my mind my spirit and my soul to you one more time father God I trust God that you come and take over lord and give me the strength to surrender myself and get out of the way Lord now father God I commit this service to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you may be seated one moment thank the Lord for reading of the word of God this evening as I took from the the word of God from the book of Deuteronomy it say says here he says all the blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shall hugen unto the voice of the Lord thy God and I took a title this evening overtaken by the revelation of blessings everybody want to be overtaken if it's a b blessing that we want if I'm going to be overtaken by something let God bless me H but I begin to look I begin to think on this thing excuse me on overtaken by blessing people when they overtaken by something it's not you are looking for it to happen it just happened right if somebody was overtaken in a car rate they were not planning the carate it just happened Hallelujah you know in words just it's something that happened that you was not planning for it to happen but it happened but I say how much more if we can come to the revelation of almighty God and God overtake Us by blessing not even when we are looking for it it just happened I begin to take here I begin to look at this thing right here overt taking my blessing now we really here when God gave this Revelation to Peter I knew Peter was not looking for it right H and God came to Peter and said to Peter who the man said that I am Peter said th of Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said blessed are thy son born Jonah for Flesh and Blood never revealed us to you you have been overtaken by the revelation of blessing how we realize that God blessed him we realize here that blessing is an eternal attribute exactly it's something that God gave eternally he spoke it and when God spoke that word blessed that mean that God can't think it back right so I begin to realize here I took in Genesis one right verse 28 first God spoke God created everything he created he it it says here you know it begin to talk in Genesis 1 and then the Bible said Genesis 1 and ver when God in the beginning God created heaven and earth and then you know did God and then it said and the Earth was without form da was up the faith of the and the spirit of the Lord God move uh moved up on the face of the one and God said let there be light and then you know God divided God if you notice God begin to say he saw that the day was good he saw it but you know he never said anything about blessing till he got to man right H if you notice here he never talked about blessing until he got to man so Genesis 1 and verse 28 and the Bible say and God blessed them H that that that's something that the devil can't take away and God blessed and and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and S do it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowls of the earth and over every living thing that mooved upon the upon the face upon the upon the Earth so we begin to realize here that God blessed them and God told them I want you to be fruitful and I want you to be and I want you to multiply and I want you to replenish Earth before Adam got to that right amen right he broke the word of God right he didn't lose his sunship that's right he lost his Dominion right right Hallelujah and way he should have had Dominion ship over over over the Earth he should have dominion ship over everything to move and God blessed him and told him I want you to be fruitful and multiply but before before had before Adam exercise those pleasant he cut himself off through unbelief right amen so we begin to realize here we realize here so what they do God had to keep that word he had to keep that word moving he had to keep that word HH inspiration on the word blessing so we realize here what did God do he raised up a not a son that he can bless Abraham God said to Abraham Abraham what I have blessed thee whatever you do Abraham I Will Bless thee H Abraham he put it on Abraham right because was eternal blessing H was something that God said I would bless Abraham I would multiply your seed I would bless you AB huah he begin to tell Abraham I am unconditionally H I am overtaking you Abraham I am going to bless you and you know the St was Abraham was looking for God God was looking for him God called him when he was not even looking for God he was done the child doing his own thing but God had a blessing for him and God called him out and say Abraham I'm going to bless you how you been overtaken by blessing amen now I'm going to just stop for a moment and I'm going to think about blessings because when you talk to the world or you talk to peoples about blessings and you begin to listen at the radio preacher tevision evangelist when they speak on blessing it's always materal blessing right right you notice that they always go to the subject we believe that God going to bless you Hallelujah you you gave such a such amount of money to the church and God going to bless you with a new home God going to bless you with a new car and they always get the people mind always work up on material thing but I want to tell you what people God material thing will pass away but the Eternal thing that's what God want to bless us with h because you find here if you get up CAU you you and if God bless you with a new car sooner or later it going to wor out you going tell so it ain't nothing that God got Eternal blessing I take let me uh just read a quote from the adoption book page 15 he said bless bless it bless us with what Divine Healing for knowledge Revelation wisdom power tong interpretation the tong wisdom knowledge and all and all the Heavenly blessings and joy unspe able and full of Glory every heart filled with the spirit walking together s together in Heavenly places not one evil thought amen we get to that point you know we been blessed we get there you know have you know we had to deal with he a not a mother not one cigarette not one short dress not one this that or the other not one evil thought nobody uh nobody uh got anything against one another everybody speaking in love and harmony everybody with one Accord and one to play then suddenly that came a sound from Heaven Like A rushan Mighty Wind there you are he blessed us with all spiritual blessing so he if you notice here he L he going and teaching us we should see the spiritual place so begin to gohe look at the blessings so we begin to go here I begin to realize here we think I'm blessing so we we begin to realize the world it it least so everything is in the blessing real is always going to the mature real it's always I'm going to be blessed God going to do here H but what about Revelation if God blessing you by Revelation if God blessing you with Revelation he giving you power over every work of the devil he bless Peter take Peter and the against the hell shall not Hallelujah they shall not be able they might come against you Peter H they might fight you here and they might throw this at you and they might try this but they shall not be able to change your mind and make you turn against God here Eternal blessing so we begin to go here so I begin to look on these things here as as we begin to think this but people take then if they're not blessed with mat a mature then they take blessings sometime for Sensations yeah right I feel good how you know oh I went to church the other night and they they shout the church down Hallelujah and the preacher didn't get to preach yeah what happened you got caught up in emotions right how there's no higher calling than the preaching of the word of God how so if you go to church and you get worked up in emotion and sensation that's good I I believe that the Holy Spirit got those thing but what we Eternal destination on how God in other words you might not even feel like you saved you got to know you saved because the scripture Revelation tell you I'm a Son of God God bless you so begin to go here I begin to look at these things here I begin to realize here so we begin to realize here we must we God have called us to be a blessed peoples and we're to be overtaken by revelation of blessings amen and we begin to if we will study the Scripture it caus A peculiar people yeah pecul I looked at up in the Lexicon that mean God treager peoples Hallelujah God treed people meaning royal priesthood of chosen people of people that God say I'm going to bless you and I'm going to choose you and the devil ain't going to be able to do nothing about it because I decided and my for knowledge I'm going to bless you how so we begin to hear we are God chosen people but we realize here now we find out here God try to bless people why God can't bless people because people won't let him because people Fe that's right how they Fe if I believe God if this happen I don't believe I know if I hold on to this I don't believe it going to happen they always F right when Adam left the blessings of God when Adam moved from the presence of God the first word he spoke after he left the presence of God I hear thy voice and I was afraid right F had come in and and F had come in out of his own mouth he was bringing a cur on his own self how because God did not teach him through how God did not teach him how to PR and never since then man in his own mouth he a bless itself or curs so we begin to realize here we find out what James said out of out of the same mouth proceeding blessings and out of the same mouth preceded cursing H it's hard whatever you put in your mouth but we need to put the word of God in our mouth and possess the Gate of our enemy going let just look at so now we think about blessings am I'm going to I'm going to begin to look at it like this so when we think about blessing how you know that God blessing you you know some people say well the other day I was going down the road and I feel chill bumps yeah yeah man come on yeah that's all you got to base your Eternal destination on you feel chill but you going to be tossed to and fro because you living by emotion and feelings that's right Hallelujah so you living by something that God and way you living by you living by something that only yourself that you can feel yourself and you try to bless yourself because I feel good how but the point it is God that's good and and and I hope you feel good but the point of it is I want you to look at the spiritual things of God how we go the spirit of lay seal is an age that people will go off F instead of the word lay our seal is an age that taught us this is the end that people would Revelation 3:17 he said because thou said I am rich right and increase with good and have need of nothing H if you don't need nothing you ain't got no youed to pray for more God right H if you don't have a need for nothing you don't in other words you know way I I got everything I need I have a need for nothing and and and and knowth it not that thou are wretched and and and miserable and blind and and miserable and poor and blind and naked and don't even know it what it is what it is about le le is a ag a material thing and people say I'm blessed just living in Lay alone you bless with materialism right I mean everybody got material stuff now Hallelujah people can't say we can look at the people that sit here and nobody don't look like they on salvation this is here you might not have money but you got a credit card how you can get what you want how there a material blessing lay me people right how but the point of it lay that people depends on FS you know why because lay is the age that you blind right and a blind man don't live he had to feel his way through right he got to depend on his feelings to get around how and that blind is his a it got the people Le to feel it stand of the word of God how did they don't go to church because I don't feel like it yeah come on brother I don't feel like praying this is a blind Edge but it ain't got nothing to do with feeling I want you to open your eyes to the word of God and ain't feeling it's Revelation that God bless you glory we go here I look here so told Peter here I mean I give you the keys to the kingdom how I'm going to give you the keys to my own house right did you understand when Jesus told Peter St Matthew said Matthew the 16th chapter at the 16 verse he said I'm going to give you the keys yeah right not just one key right the keys right and other word single not single I'm giveing you keys to my kingdom and to give somebody your key that mean that you must have covidence amen and get him if I give you my my keys that mean I got covered to trust you with my Dominion right I mean come on people be for real I got cousins I won't give my key to I know better than do that I'm sure you got family Meers you going to give your key to because you got to have confidence when you give somebody your key how because you are saying I am in trusting you with my Dominion I have given you the authority to unlock my door and in my Dominion Jesus say I give you the key Peter right now if God going to give pet of the keys uh and he going to turn around and send him to hell he going to be in bad shape because when Once God give you something he can't take you back right exactly and if God give Peter the keys to send to hell he can't even get in his own house right but God gave Peter the key and he knew that the devil was going to try to SI Peter he knew that the devil going to try to get Peter but Jesus said Peter I pray for you because you got my keys exactly now when you get somebody your keys think about this you get somebody your keys and you leaving out of town you say here go my keys I'm in trusting you yeah use my house do shirt eat go cook whatever you need to do here go my keys you inviting him to go into your Dominion right now if that person come to your house yeah and all of a sudden he goes to the porch and he sit on the porch yeah and it start raining and start liting and thundering and sleep start falling and they you know hell is beating him to death and all the ice begin to come and this man satting on the porch freezing yeah yeah right to me that is plain stupidity right why stand on the porch of freeer there when you got a key to somebody El how I got to key to this house I'm going to go and get out of the cold I'm going to open the door and I'm going to go into his dominion and I'm going to shout myself in because I got the key and why when I give you the key to my car right you get a B the key to your car to go to church I can't make it tonight but I'm been trusting you with my car in other words so I give you the key to my car now people don't normally give the key to the car right you ask somebody for the car I don't let nobody drive my car but if you give a man to key to your car here go my power to get you to from here to there now the church is 20 M if somebody give you the key to their car I don't expect you to walk 20 miles yeah right come on now tonight we know that nobody ain't walk 20 miles to church tonight reason I know that because people at church right I guarantee you people had to walk 20 M to church the church will be tonight but I want to tell you what but if you got the key you get inside your car and you drive the church and and you got the key and when Jesus gave you the key he gave you every blessing I don't understand why people want God to come and he yeah I don't understand why people want God to deliver right but God gave you the key to his house everything you have need of is on the inside all you need to do is open the door and go the inside how did it get if you need healing open the door to Healing go in the inside and get healed if you need Deliverance go in inside and get delivered you got the key to do it all he need is your faith to do it so to go here and look so we begin to think he sent Jesus people under understand Jesus didn't come to make your life miserable right he came to bless you GL amen so you read in the scripture like Acts 3 verse 2 says unto you first God have been raised of his son Jesus send him to bless you and and bless you in turning yeah away every one of you from his iniquities right Jesus came y to bless you to turn you from your iniquity right things that we do that we ought not do but Jesus came right to turn us away right H that's the blessing God gave now we begin to look here we begin to look at as I begin to go here and look at these things because I begin to realize here God came to bless us and to turn us away from all our iniquity because I want to tell you what it ain't nobody in here that ain't got something that undone or something that un said or something that they cannot stand before God when say Lord I'm perfect without the blood of Jesus Christ right exactly let look at like Paul's begin to describe the blessings of God and Paul Tau it in Romans 4 verse 6 he says and he took him here Paul understood what God blessing was Paul understood what God's grace was right why you think Paul could take this scripture and he going write about the blessings of God is such impact such inspiration because Paul understood if God did not send his mercy and God did not send his Blessing he would have went straight to hell right Paul stood this so Paul the one that T he says here Romans 4:6 he say even as David describe the blessing of the man whom the Lord imp righteousness right without works amen you said what did I do to get there absolutely nothing that's right because you was good enough you couldn't have got there the rich man came to Jesus he tried to he tried to approach God upon his own Mar upon his own righteousness and he was not good enough H he said Lord I deserve to do this from my youth Jesus said all right he said if you want to serve me then and you said you don't kept my commandment he I tell you you like one thing and you like because you got another God that you love more than you do me he they said all you got to give to the PO we you see right there that rich man hard would sold out to God he could not overcome the material things of this world he says and we realize it's done worse he said blessed is the man of God whom the Lord right with our work then Paul said blessed are they who iniquities are forgiven right who sins are covered amen hallelujah blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin to so Paul begin to realize here how do even though I deserve to go straight to hell but I can look through the grace of almighty God say blessed is the man that God would not imp cuz if God would imputed Paul's sin Paul had blashe right amen go back and read the scripture Paul said I have blasphemed through ignorance right in other words Paul should have been scrapped off he should not have been able to be saved for what he done but the point of it is the scripture say blessed is the man whom the LA had impute sin to blessed is the man who Ned H are forgien and who sins are covered it was not Paul doing it it was the mercy and the blessing of almighty God do you realize when Paul killed Stevens and he he brought he didn't leave no way back because the scripture say touch not my anointing do my Prophet no harm it better for a millstone to be TI right your neck you throw it to the depths of sea and Dr and then touch one of my anointing Paul killed a man full of the Holy Ghost how do he he left no way back but I want to tell you why he got back because God had blood there God had mercy there and God had a blessing and Paul was not looking for God but God came looking for powerul Hallelujah he was overtaken by God blessing and I'm tell you what we needed to do Hall some don't realize here how much more we need I need God if I want God to do something for me tonight I want God to overtake Me by revelation of blood let me understand it how it was not for God blessing it was not for God imp was not impute sin to me if it was not God if God would not a charge iniquity to me I I would have went scrap to hell but God Rich him Mercy hallelujah thank you Lord so Paul he was there how he kill Stevenson and then would with d Stevenson looked up y because Jesus empowered him a few days before that amen said we s you remit they remit whoever s you retain they'll retain how whoever you forgive St they'll forgive it how Ste had power how do God Empower him with power to speak the word and bless somebody H and then Stevenson was die Stevens looked looked up on and looked to Christ stand at the right hand in the authority of God and he cried out he said Lord laid out this charge what did he do he dropped the charges how was poly s before God right I thank God that what the grace did for all of us hallelu with Jesus said father hallelujah hallelujah father L not the Char he dropped the charg of that c right H and we can go free but we got to take Faith and accept what God does that's right we take Fai you say well I'm looking for the blood God you are not saved by the blood You Are shved by the faith the blood is what keep you say but keep you clean day by day how God wash you day by day that's why we don't got no sins against us hallelujah you you you preaching this man is see like so just out here but there but see the the day it is the spirit will lay us still it's got people instead of worshiping God it's all self right self L everybody feel like look what I do how good I be Hallelujah and every become lovers of self more than lovers of God hallah you know it's all about me it's all about myself how in other words that the world is all caught up in themselves how everywhere you go it this matter about me but the point of it is I say you know what it is God is not let us live our life for ourselves we come to church to live our life for somebody else that somebody can see Christ shining in You You Lord H he want you not to P light and put it on the bush yourself you don't give light to the World Behind Your Life hiding Christ under a bush you let it shine so somebody that's in darkness they can look at the life and find a way so God don't want us to look to self how people are trying to bless themselves how where you go it's all about the self it's all preachers everywhere how it's about the S how they looking for theel they how they everything about theel but now God is trying to get the people how to come back to the blessing of God I know my children night I think the most person that's miss the greatest one of the greatest servants on Earth that people miss the most when they don't come they say what happened yeah yeah I said that's the mailman yeah cuz when you know you going to get a check and the mailman don't show up you never think about the mail man till he don't show up when the mail man don't show up right everybody say wonder what happened what the mail man it today my check didn't come today you might not think about the ma man but when he don't show up Hallelujah he don't get no praise for his job he don't nobody don't go out and pra him by only time you miss him when he don't show up right I know I been there I didn't know the holiday a few days ago I waiting for something to happen and it didn't happen I said oh my wife oh yeah this is a holiday I oh man waiting on the mailman right he serve his job he don't get no glory but he's a servant right Hallelujah he in word he serve others Hallelujah not not looking for nothing in return He just delivered the Bell how do God as a servant of God we're not looking for self Glory we not looking to get nothing in return or somebody pra up we do it because we love God and we preach the word that's somebody going be saved by the Holy Spirit we go here sir Hallelujah I guess got say man I'm trying to keep this camera on him yes sir there he is I want I to take it back here so we begin to go God trying to get us but TR to restore us right and this revelation of blessing yes how God going to bless you how God going to bless people today how we get Revelation to be blessed the Bible says here it says Romans 10 verse say what what said it the word is not right to thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we pring that's right if th if thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord and thou shall and and the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thy heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shall be saved and if you read the rest of the Scripture it that how can you how can you believe when I'm a preacher right that's right that's right they come to hear they Faith with God when you come to church and hear the word of God you are blessed because God is spiritually maturing you into a spiritual growth that when things come your way you got some word in your mind in your heart you can go back to say Dev I heard it preach you get behind me say that the word of God said this and I am blessed because I know my place in the word take this little step further so now we begin to go so we think about God blessings how good God been to we saved how God keep us saved by the washing of the word of God how and we hear the word God is keep blessing us over and over again H so if I begin to look here now I want you to understand when God bless you when God blessed Abraham right he told Abraham say Abraham look up to the Stars he's en C look at the S and you I can't do it do you realize here everywhere you go everything that come in contact with you come under the atmosphere of blessing H you know I work at you you can go work for somebody hall and then they could be unbelieving if you work there and you live a holy and Sanctified life you know it's the job of Prosper right what you say what happened that's God blessing Hallelujah he said I bless you he told Abraham see I bless your seed and they shall possess get of the enemy don't think it's SC people that about coming H that overtake you you don't you don't try to make that happen God automatically do it h because God promised he will bless Abraham SE Hall don't what we don't have to worry about this economy is falling I don't care what happened here I realize here that my Bible said that Abraham see the righteous won't be forsaken all he see to be Bing bread that's what the word of God say Hallelujah but see we we get this we create this spir that God won't stand behind his word things is going on everything is happening in the world people thinking what I'm going to do what I'm going to do I'm going to keep serving God how keep on doing the same thing I do loving God and every day and I don't have to worry about all these other things I don't have to worry about my clothes I don't have to worry about my Sho I don't have to worry about my food because he said he know what you have need of before you even ask got in the way God when God said I bless you you don't think God going to take care of you he promis take care of you I don't care how hard times get that ain't got nothing to do with it you show me in the Bible what God when Israel didn't have nothing righten left the big time Egypt y making the big bucks yeah working production per had them on production how here they were now leaving them good jobs behind how did the conomy them fail them how they follow the prophet Called Moses how did they get out in the wilderness and all of a sudden here they were they begin to realize hey man it would have been better we would have stayed back in Egypt they calling it on oh like God was going to bless him yeah see what happened F God in their minds and they begin to think that God ain't going to keep his word how they because to say because God will put them through a test they thought God was going to keep his word but I will let you know what God Said God can never change his mind what he said about you H when they got out there they begin to cry all of a sudden God begin to rain ble I'm going to bless you in a way I never seen the right of second or his see back and bread how a got the heart of my man he said me they got out that need water God s them water how do God kept all blessing them over and over right come on you know that God going to let us fall short today that's right don't worry about what's going on you just look up he said don't you take no thought don't you be going around worried about when people think about things God can't bless them CU When you think about try to figure it out try to reason out

when every demon and every Power been left Lo the say how you against the bride why you have evil goost right I don't even know what I'm going this way go ahead why you have even thoughts you know sometime you go on all of a sudden this thought come in your mind you think I even think about that where did that come from right do you realize in this Dimension yeah come on how many peoples and bodies B coming through this Dimension right now cut a television when you can see them right called the fourth dimension how do we come into contact with this dimension in all kind of ways is passing through our body radio ways television way how a frequency for cell all the things and we catching these thought and we running why I'm doing this we fighting against sa need and to keep your right mind in his head you are blessed right brother amen overtaking see look at here let me just use it like this let me when God came to Mary it never happened before right this had never happened before amen here go Mary doing whatever she doing maybe going to the well or whatever she doing and all of a sudden in the dimension that she stood in Angel steing up right Hallelujah and he called her by name Mary yeah on Mary turns around and she look you said brother it don't have today you show me where to quit happen today the Bible say you got to watch when you entertain stranger for unaware you entertain Angels HJ Mary standing there and he stepped into this Dimension where she was and he says a Mary he said you are highly favored amongst women amen that's right he said God did he told Mary he said you a blessed among women that's right H why would she bless among women because she would get ready to break everything to history she get ready to break everything that sh said how can she have a baby without knowing a man right amen she was breaking all history she was breaking all s it never happened before but Mary was blessed she said Lord how after here he was here go God he deal with Zachariah if you notice he never deal it he came to Zachariah said zachari I going to come to your your wife liiz in the whole land and Zachariah doubted God right God shut his mouth why because he didn't want him to C himself right amen right amen God would he let the man talk because out of your mouth you to bless and curse how so here was so he shed his mouth how do he came to zachari because Zachariah had to bring Jud on the sea and it had to be between the intimate of the woman and the man but when Mary come Jesus the angel never came to Joseph right right exactly he didn't have no reason to come to Joseph because the Holy Ghost can come to anybody want to so he buried then oh he was not dealing with her physical real he was dealing with her Revelation he said Mary you are highly faved among women he said the Lord he said you're blessed and begin to tell Mary then he said Mary you going to have a son Mary was in her mind she thinking I ain't never hear nothing like this before H but she didn't realize it was a blessing God was blessing her womb that she was going to have a son without aart from man Hallelujah Mary finally he finally Mary begin to go because Mary had to say the right word how out a while when God be to tell Mary Mary couldn't see to get it together he said you remember Elizabeth yeah in old age yeah already done blessed up with a son called John the Baptist and when Mary heard that Elizabeth got prayed Mary throw the hand up say me God that's a blessing we don't have to have a sensation to believe God that's right all I need is theor of God to call me by name how all you need is the voice of God to let you know who you are and where you come from and that's how God said I'm going to bless you today I'm going to bless you today what did he done today h when Jesus Christ left off the sea H he still had work to finish right right he still had work to finish that's right and in the last day he came down in the power of the Holy Spirit and in a powerful Min right amen that's right Hallelujah you said what you go when you come here you don't come here to see Brother Sam right right the day we was sitting in a restaurant and a lady was working now she didn't see us but Brother Sam saying something she said I heard your voice hallah something on the inside of her she knew it was here by his voice she I hear his voice I said praise be to God she can identify the character with I see oh hallelujah how much more will we can see Christ know that he's here tonight not by the man but by the voice hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah let me say a few Mo Hall I'm begin to look at now when God bless you when he blessed Abraham everything that Abraham come in contact was blessed right everything that Abraham prayed for was blessed even Israel would even a covenant child but still God blessed you you hear that y Israel was not a covenant child but the man still blessed right he might have got the natural thing but God blessed him right but it being of the sea Hallelujah the Royal seed it was not the natural thing that was looking for it was Supernatural things right amen I'm going to tell you here now you said was Abraham perfect if he was perfect Christ don't need to come right right she what was saying if he was so holy Christ didn't need to come right did Abraham have problem some he had problem when the man left the promised land left out the Canon went down went down to Egypt where he was how did the king saw his wife yeah that's right wow who is that woman yeah for C now he's looking at he's going to go and do something he trying to save his own life so to save his own life he got to tell a lie yeah the king say who that beautiful young lady you got he said that's my sister his wife probably want to slap him upside the head right he said that you need to hit him upside the head y all of a sudden she going to be your wife all the years yeah and now you come before this King and this King calling out and now you over here that's my sister yeah you better not try to wait I don't know what J going to do I bet what is wrong with you right now this king is taking his wife Abraham told a lie and the King was justified in what he was doing cuz he could not take another man wife but he could take a man sister right right right so now this kid go to sleep here he was doing by he doing ain't done nothing wrong our Angel Lord came and said you better restore the man his wife Hall you as good as a dead man your kingdom will die let man I ain't done nothing he sister he said I know the Integrity of your heart that's why I come to let you know restore back right when got it back he the one that told the LIE y then God say have to prayer for you yeah the man that told the LIE is praying for the man that does nothing wrong why because the blessing was on Abraham not the king so we begin to go here let's look at this blessing so now Abraham had problem like everybody him and lot was going to the same church yeah had they both went to the same church yeah and all of a sudden lot Herman started with Abraham Herman yeah who and other everybody got into some doctor issues yeah trying to prove the two Lords to Abraham fighting against doct yeah and ABR so Abraham said don't let it be scrib between them us yeah MH let us break this Spirit of division right y y he said let us the best of to separate y m so he said lot he said where you want to go lot look down to a solar that's what a big buck say yeah yeah I'm going that way you can stay out you in the country you want to I'm going down here where they making the money at have to go down here and live bu those solemn nights and all that perverted Spirit down now he chose to go down now lot get down there and the man become prosperous he became the mder of the city the man making plenty money everything going good for lot all of a sudden he get weaker in his face every day right can finally the devil kept shift in him and shift in him till the man didn't even have no faith right so now lot could not come out right because he didn't have enough Faith to come out right the man loveed it down there s right but the point of it was he had an uncle that loved him right he had an uncle that stayed on his knees Lord Open the Eyes of lot hard how he had a h that say I'm not going to let go of my nephew I love my nephew he like people today right we see we see him doing something wrong first we say forget him but Abraham said no I'm not forgetting lot he's my nephew I'm holding on to him and I'm going to BL God I don't know how he going to bring them out I don't know how he going to save them I don't know the condition I see the condition they because we look at the condition of the flood not the condition of promises when you look at flesh we get blood because we see our young people we see our children doing things that we be say why my kids doing this oh my God they going to go to hell they going to do this they going to get killed they going go but you looking at the natural you got to look Bey up because flesh is there nothing good in flesh nowhere and when you reach out for somebody else you not looking at their faith because they ain't got no faith but the B say if you got faith for yourself you take that same thing right Abraham un believe a lot now you say how did a lot come out did he come out on his own marriage or did he come out on Abraham Faith right the Bible says James 5:16 the effect fir of a righteous man availing much right so Abraham had a his thing because he believe God so now it's time for lot to come out yeah now lot is in the back condition by the way right when I'm talking about bid yeah the man is so B these angels come down there these perverted solom knits seeing these angels go in this house they kicking the door in and lot got two two virgin daughters really and lock goes to the door say don't take these angels take my two daughters you know what I would I would have went to the door with something oh yeah would had something they would have take something they take my other six there you know but here it is yeah but the he was backslid so he was so weak in his F he gave his clean ver his daughter over to these perverts the T right all that he done backlit completely his Fai was complet wi right but God said Abraham seed right will possess the Gate of his enemy so now let us go to the scripture see how lot come out yeah Genesis 19th Chapter Genesis you say sometime I pray for my children I don't see nothing happen keep praying on H you Ain the go if you can see something happen you don't need faith for Hallelujah faith is something that you don't see they they not see but you believe by the power of God some way somehow God going to Prevail so uh Genesis 19 chapter gen and verse 29 and it says it and it came to pass when God destroyed the the cities of the plains that God done what done what remembered Abraham how God was not looking at he was looking at Abraham it was Abraham he gave the promise hey Abraham whatever you pray for whoever you call me for he remembered Abraham and he remembered Abraham and he sh lot out of the midst of the overthrowing when he overthrow the city in which lot dwelt it was not lot coming out on his own it was Abraham kept laying there before God calling out for L Lord save my nephew don't let it P with the we yet right you got to take that same favor hold over your children I I can't promise you they going to be in the Rapture but I can't promise you hold that fa don't waver they'll make it out right hallelu God promised that Hallelujah he promised us if you ask anything we put a limitation on it he anything without a limitation because you got the right of the a come the blessen now what would have happen and lot would refus the blessing MH he would refuse to come out right why did abah keep calling on the lot right what did lot have to do when he was D that backlit why didn't God let him go to hell cuz if God would have let lock with to hell he would had to denal his own race right on because remember Ruth come through lot then Boaz then Jessie Then David right right right just came through that lineage so AB hold up so that why when God give you Faith to hold on for your son or your daughter sometime we begin to I don't know why Lord I just keep praying for keep praying for because in that son that you got it the Lord might be the next preacher for the church H he might be the next preacher and caring that seed in him right we don't give up on nobody we hold up on by faith keep bringing before God the unjust keeping H he didn't feel a man and he didn't for God but she just kept knocking Hall i w comeing Lord and I don't W keep not until you send that blessing because you promised that you will bless the seed of and we begin to get ready to wind down and the musicians come tonight Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord that what was playing when I come up here and I want to say here I had yeah go the biggest blessing you got today he said what did God do to me how do I know I'm blessed because God have gave you spiritual ears yeah to hear the word of God and if you can hear the word of God brother he said blessed are your ears because everybody ain't got ear to hear so if you can hear the word of God then that mean I got the ability to hear you don't follow nothing you don't hear right right you don't know what to say when I'm I I travel a lot of different foreign countries and when I walk up them foreign countries up there they talking stuff I don't know I don't get involved because I don't know what this say you got to be able to hear out to prepare yourself right amen so now this this hold for a few minutes I read he said thanks he he said right here he said thank God at this moment at this age is not over right he is crying and and his cry is not only is not only to the spiritual ears or men but his Spirit once again again a prophet in the land right once again God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul we hear God's voice right you said how will I hear God's voice today some people looking to hear something I'm walking in there and all of a sudden the wind blew and I hear the voice that a the way you going to hear God's voice you hear God's voice you must hear that man because Jesus said a little while that's why I be the world won't see me no more but you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and do the preaching of the word how hear my voice people every time God move they hear his voice the Bible said I S him went into the world right the voice of many Waters is raising up has a voice in this land right trying to fight against this own coming judgment right let me just read one more I had I better finish this up real quick give me a second I took the Book of Revelation when you preach on the Book of Revelation the majority of the people say I don't believe that book that's right if I talk to denominal peop all time and you say something about re I don't man I don't mess with that book M you know why because you got to be able to hear your name right right Revelation is not to everybody the Book of Revelation is to a chosen people a royal priesthood a special language that the world can't understand and only thing they can interpret this Lang language is ail 3 and7 right right you can not read the book of Revelation with intellectual concept you had to have the proper Chanel to understand the scripture you had to
