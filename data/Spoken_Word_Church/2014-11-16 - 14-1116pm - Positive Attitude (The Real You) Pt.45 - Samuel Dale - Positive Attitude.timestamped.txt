[0:10] sunday school was to sing today but
[0:12] since bob and monica not here
[0:17] i'll sing today
[0:18] they can sing next sunday
[0:24] i know
[0:25] not why gods want dress grace to
[0:30] me
[0:31] he hath made known
[0:34] nor why
[0:36] unworthy
[0:38] christ in love
[0:40] redeemed me for his on
[0:45] but i know whom i have believed
[0:50] and i'm
[0:51] persuaded that he's able
[0:56] to
[0:56] keep that which i've committed
[1:01] unto him against the day
[1:07] i know
[1:08] not how the
[1:11] faith
[1:12] to me
[1:14] he did impart
[1:18] nor how
[1:19] believing
[1:21] in his what wrought peace within my
[1:27] heart
[1:29] but i know
[1:31] i have believed
[1:34] and i'm
[1:36] persuaded
[1:37] that he's able to
[1:41] keep that
[1:43] which have committed
[1:46] unto him against that day
[1:52] i know not how the
[1:55] spirit moves
[1:58] convincing men of sin
[2:04] revealing jesus through the word
[2:09] creating faith in him
[2:14] i know
[2:16] not what of good or ill maybe
[2:22] for me
[2:25] off weary ways or golden days before
[2:32] his face i see
[2:36] but i know who
[2:38] i have believed
[2:41] and i'm
[2:42] persuaded
[2:44] that he's able
[2:47] to keep that which i've commented
[2:52] unto him against the day
[2:58] i know
[2:59] not when my lord may come at night or
[3:05] noon death air
[3:09] nor if i'll walk the veil with him
[3:14] or meet him in the air
[3:19] but i know hope i have believed
[3:25] and i'm
[3:26] persuaded
[3:27] that he's able to keep that which i've
[3:33] committed
[3:36] unto him against the day
[3:41] but i know hope i have believed
[3:46] and i'm
[3:47] persuaded that he's able
[3:52] to
[3:52] keep that which i've committed
[3:57] and to him
[4:10] before
[4:12] you don't need
[4:19] oh
[4:45] i've sung this before but i just don't
[4:47] think we can ever give him enough praise
[4:49] so
[5:02] well it was told
[5:04] that he would come
[5:07] and the race
[5:20] but when they laid
[5:22] him in the tomb
[5:24] the power of the lord came in the room
[5:28] now he raised yet he reigns forever
[5:53] by his stripes
[5:55] we are healed and by his blood we are
[6:00] sealed
[6:02] hallelujah
[6:04] to the land of god
[6:09] well bright he's coming back someday
[6:14] to take us home
[6:16] with him to stay
[6:18] his glory
[6:20] forever
[6:22] we'll share
[6:26] and when that last trophy sounds oh
[6:39] oh
[6:43] hallelujah
[7:01] we are healed and by his blood we are
[7:06] sealed hallelujah
[7:09] to the lamb of god sing the course
[7:39] hallelujah
[7:48] hallelujah
[7:58] amen amen
[8:15] open the eyes of my heart lord
[8:20] open the eyes of my heart
[8:24] i want
[8:36] i
[8:49] holy holy
[8:58] shining in the light of your glory
[9:02] pour out your power and love
[9:12] think about it
[9:33] amen
[9:34] just turn around and take a look at each
[9:36] other
[9:37] because that's where he's supposed to be
[9:38] at right
[9:40] amen good to see everybody in the house
[9:41] of the lord
[9:42] if you like turning your scriptures turn
[9:44] over to
[9:46] john 3.
[9:48] very familiar scripture with us
[9:52] you know i was thinking about
[9:54] and i want to do something in a minute
[9:56] kind of the natural to show
[9:58] what i'm talking about but
[10:01] i got to thinking about the scriptures
[10:05] and uh
[10:06] i just got to run into kind of a little
[10:09] reference to the scriptures there the
[10:11] other day and i thought well i'll just
[10:13] do it that way and i'll approach it from
[10:14] that and then we'll go on
[10:17] but
[10:18] remember now the bible study december
[10:20] the sixth saturday
[10:21] on that one you know december the 6th
[10:23] and remember the
[10:25] the uh what's not service
[10:27] on the 31st
[10:29] remember also the christmas time
[10:30] together on december the 14th
[10:33] only one service that day and so we get
[10:36] everything ready and getting it together
[10:38] and doing and then
[10:40] i really got a good one while ago
[10:43] you know i kind of
[10:45] got a little hard this morning i guess
[10:47] but
[10:48] it's it's in love so if you take it that
[10:51] way
[10:52] if you don't then just blame me for it
[10:53] but
[10:55] i was talking about you know i said
[10:57] where was you at yesterday i said
[10:58] where's it fellowship meeting
[11:00] i said i guess using walmart well
[11:02] one brother came up and he said
[11:05] brother dale i have to admit it
[11:08] i was in walmart yesterday
[11:13] that wasn't all
[11:16] he said
[11:18] but i was buying your christmas present
[11:25] that wasn't all
[11:28] he said i guess i'll have to take it
[11:30] back
[11:34] i said look if you're going to repent
[11:35] repent to me don't repent to walmart
[11:38] keep my christmas present
[11:40] you know
[11:41] no
[11:42] yes that's good
[11:44] that was a good point
[11:46] amen john 3
[11:48] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[11:50] this day and your grace unto each one of
[11:52] us we thank you for loving us and caring
[11:54] for us lord thank you for saving us
[11:58] guiding us and leading us lord
[12:00] into your word we love you and we thank
[12:03] you
[12:03] we pray that you would just reach down
[12:05] and touch each one remember the ones
[12:06] that are not here lord the sick ones
[12:08] among us remember the different things
[12:10] lord sister audrey there that lord heard
[12:14] her shoulders and their things lord and
[12:16] we pray that you just reach down and
[12:18] touch her and all the rest lord and we
[12:19] thank you for being with each one and
[12:22] it's delivering us we love you
[12:24] and we thank you in jesus name
[12:28] amen
[12:29] i said very familiar scripture with all
[12:32] of us
[12:32] right
[12:34] john 3
[12:36] there was a man of the pharisees named
[12:39] nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same
[12:42] came to jesus by night
[12:43] and said unto him rabbi we know that
[12:45] thou art a teacher come from god now
[12:48] brother brown says
[12:49] on the 4141 church age book he said
[12:51] jesus didn't say i'm a teacher
[12:53] he said because he didn't come for that
[12:57] he said he come to die
[12:59] he said but the holy spirit that would
[13:02] come would be the teacher you know and
[13:04] see i just write those things in my
[13:06] bible because to me i love them you know
[13:08] we know that the already teacher comes
[13:10] from god for no man can do
[13:12] these miracles that thou doest except
[13:14] god be with him
[13:16] jesus answered and said unto him verily
[13:17] verse i say unto thee except a man be
[13:20] born again
[13:21] he cannot see the kingdom of god the
[13:23] original said unless it be born from
[13:25] above
[13:26] all right so jesus was saying you got to
[13:28] be born from where i come from see that
[13:30] was the confusing to nicodemus nicodemus
[13:32] saith unto him how can a man be born
[13:34] when he is old can he enter the second
[13:36] time into his mother's womb and be born
[13:38] jesus answered verily verily i say unto
[13:41] thee except a man be born to water
[13:44] and of the spirit he cannot enter into
[13:47] the kingdom of god
[13:49] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[13:50] and that which is born of the spirit is
[13:52] spirit
[13:53] marvel not that i said unto thee you
[13:55] must be born again now see he repeated
[13:58] that statement
[13:59] now remember if god ever repeats himself
[14:02] you pay attention when he says verily
[14:04] verily
[14:06] you stop and listen all right
[14:09] so what he said marvel that not that i
[14:11] say unto thee you must be born again
[14:14] the wind bloweth where it lists us thou
[14:16] knowest the sound thereof but can't not
[14:18] tell once it cometh and whether it goes
[14:21] so is everyone that is born
[14:23] of the spirit of god amen you may be
[14:26] seated lord that is blessing to the
[14:28] reading of the word
[14:31] now
[14:33] i said i have a
[14:35] an odd way of approaching things but i
[14:37] got to thinking about
[14:39] this
[14:41] here and you know and tying it together
[14:45] and you know the whole bible is the plan
[14:47] of salvation
[14:48] amen
[14:49] redemption
[14:51] etc
[14:52] is in the word of god
[14:54] and uh you know
[14:56] after all of these years
[14:59] that the man had studied
[15:01] nicodemus
[15:03] now you know wade done a marvelous job
[15:06] on doing our
[15:07] wednesday night and maybe i shouldn't
[15:10] say it but i will anyway
[15:12] that the lord willing in
[15:14] january
[15:16] is going to run a series
[15:18] here upstairs
[15:20] here for the services
[15:22] as many services is necessary to putting
[15:24] together the statue of a perfect man
[15:27] into
[15:29] uh you know
[15:30] kind of like he's doing downstairs but
[15:32] more detail
[15:33] and
[15:34] that's why i just picked this up and i
[15:36] thought well here's something that's
[15:37] going to be very valuable because i saw
[15:39] something that i've never seen
[15:41] how it's done
[15:43] you know we talk about things but
[15:45] uh you know we talk about
[15:47] picking up a cup washing it
[15:50] using it
[15:51] and things like that but
[15:53] uh you know
[15:55] do we really understand what's taking
[15:57] place
[15:59] and you know it's not said there in the
[16:02] bible
[16:03] that nicodemus and jesus
[16:06] talked but
[16:09] i'm honest i'm you know as bad as i can
[16:11] be
[16:13] uh you can read here in just a few few
[16:16] minutes
[16:19] and then nicodemus is walking in he
[16:21] wants to see jesus he wants to talk to
[16:23] him he comes into his presence and jesus
[16:25] says you must be born again you never
[16:27] ever see your naked raider nicodemus
[16:30] now i don't think that happened
[16:34] i'm serious i don't think it happened
[16:36] that away
[16:38] i think they sat down and discussed a
[16:40] lot of things
[16:42] you know
[16:44] because he admitted that he was a
[16:45] teacher
[16:48] and you know and uh jesus recognized
[16:51] back to nicodemus
[16:53] that he was a teacher
[16:55] well they had a lot to talk about
[16:57] not just a uh
[16:59] a little 15-minute
[17:00] bid and then they went out the door and
[17:03] this might have went on for hours
[17:04] discussing the scriptures
[17:07] i always say it you know because it's
[17:09] funny to me not might not mean it to you
[17:11] but
[17:12] you know you said well brother dale you
[17:14] don't know they spent hours but you
[17:15] don't know they didn't
[17:17] so okay i'll just make my point
[17:20] you know what i'm talking about
[17:23] what if they discussed
[17:26] ezekiel 36
[17:31] you know
[17:32] what if they discuss the scriptures
[17:37] you know
[17:39] and then nicodemus says but
[17:42] hey i know the scriptures
[17:44] you know surely nicodemus knew that he
[17:46] was going to call him a messiah right
[17:48] you know surely he knew all about
[17:50] ezekiel and the the talking about the
[17:53] new heart and the new spirit you know
[17:55] putting my spirit in you and surely he
[17:57] knew all of those
[17:58] scriptures and uh and i know brother
[18:01] mode and i not meaning we were both so
[18:03] smart
[18:04] but this meaning we talked a lot alike
[18:06] and thought a lot of like and we'd be
[18:08] going to work and me and him would be
[18:10] talking here on something and all at
[18:12] once we'd be way over here on another
[18:14] topic and
[18:16] one of the brothers riding one day said
[18:17] hold on just a minute
[18:19] you were going that way and now you're
[18:21] going that way
[18:23] well we could just we could do that we
[18:24] could just swap
[18:26] and just follow each other because we
[18:28] knew each other's kind of thought well
[18:29] that's what i'm talking about two
[18:31] teachers sitting down they didn't have a
[18:33] 15 minute talk or
[18:35] something they they sat there maybe for
[18:37] hours and
[18:38] talked about the things
[18:41] and nicodemus says well i know
[18:44] i know there's some things there that
[18:46] maybe i don't fully understand
[18:48] well that wasn't confusing
[18:50] even if jesus would have explained to
[18:52] him
[18:53] the the uh
[18:54] things you know
[18:58] but yet when the amazing part was when
[19:00] jesus said
[19:02] you must be born again
[19:05] now that was the catch they could he
[19:07] couldn't get
[19:08] because there was no writings
[19:11] per se or wording period
[19:13] in the old testament form of talking
[19:16] about a new birth
[19:18] as we read it you know and we see it
[19:21] but
[19:22] yet i got to think and i thought well
[19:23] what if they um
[19:25] what if they went through some
[19:26] scriptures
[19:28] and i just like to take them and i want
[19:30] to put them up here
[19:32] and remember my thought is that they
[19:34] spent a time together
[19:35] they were discussing the scriptures
[19:38] and uh you know
[19:40] maybe they discussed something like this
[19:42] go ahead brothers and let's get started
[19:44] start with jeremiah 31
[19:47] and i want you to notice
[19:49] that you can put them all up together if
[19:50] you want to because we'll be reading
[19:53] and look what it says
[19:55] at the same time saith the lord
[19:59] will i be the god of all the families of
[20:01] israel
[20:03] and they shall be my people
[20:06] i thought lord about that scripture and
[20:08] i thought how many times did it say it
[20:09] like that
[20:11] you know
[20:14] so then we go to jeremiah 31 33
[20:16] but this shall be the covenant that i
[20:18] will make with the house of israel after
[20:20] those days saith the lord i'll put my
[20:22] law
[20:23] in their inward parts
[20:25] and i'll write it in their hearts
[20:28] now he's a little more
[20:31] expressing what he's seeing now he's
[20:34] bringing it into the inward parts and
[20:37] write it in their hearts
[20:39] and will be their god
[20:41] and they shall be my people
[20:43] but just notice the connection to always
[20:47] and they shall be my people
[20:50] those people back there believed
[20:54] you know
[20:55] i would love to go sit down with like
[20:56] rabbi richmond or some of those
[20:58] guys to just talk with them for
[21:01] hours you know of the things they're
[21:03] just not a fly-by-night or something
[21:05] they they study those scriptures
[21:09] you know
[21:10] and and they're always he said one time
[21:13] i remember saying it him saying it he
[21:15] said
[21:16] they're always interested in new things
[21:20] well see then you can see par paul on
[21:22] mars hill
[21:23] you know you can see all kind of things
[21:25] you know
[21:26] you know you can see how that people are
[21:28] always interested but look what he's
[21:30] doing now
[21:31] pick up the wording and watch
[21:34] jeremiah dealt down into the writing of
[21:37] the word
[21:39] getting into their hearts
[21:41] all right ezekiel picks it up and says
[21:44] 11 20 that they may walk in my statutes
[21:48] and keep mine ordinances
[21:50] and do them and they shall be my people
[21:52] and watch and i will be their god
[21:55] now he's saying that in the ones before
[21:57] but he's not making it that personal
[22:00] see now he's coming down to make it more
[22:02] personal ezekiel 37 27
[22:07] my tabernacle also shall be with them
[22:09] yea i will be their god and they shall
[22:12] be my people all right
[22:14] zechariah
[22:16] 8 and 8 and i'll bring them and they
[22:18] shall dwell in the midst of jerusalem
[22:21] and they shall be my people and i will
[22:23] be their god
[22:25] in truth and righteousness
[22:28] jeremiah 24 and 7 says and i'll give
[22:31] them and heart
[22:33] to know me
[22:35] you notice when i'm picking it up just
[22:37] following the lineup off you know
[22:41] just seeing they shall see might be my
[22:43] people and just follow that line up
[22:45] he's talking about the word in their
[22:47] heart now look what he's talking about
[22:50] i will as wade was bringing out the
[22:52] other wednesday give
[22:58] them a heart to know me
[23:01] you know if god don't give us a heart to
[23:02] know him we we can't know him
[23:05] it's his choosing remember
[23:08] remember that if he don't call us
[23:11] we can't come
[23:13] i'll give them in heart to know me
[23:16] that i am the lord and they shall be my
[23:18] people and i'll be their god for they
[23:21] shall return unto me with their whole
[23:25] heart
[23:27] just thinking about
[23:29] the things now
[23:31] to what that we we talk about
[23:36] and to get into
[23:38] knowing more as i said and god just
[23:40] gradually
[23:41] unveils
[23:43] well see maybe jesus was talking to
[23:44] nicodemus and he said nicodemus you know
[23:47] the scripture says this the scripture
[23:49] he says yes and here's this one here's
[23:50] that one here's this one and they just
[23:52] they're having a wonderful time
[23:54] discussing the scriptures
[23:56] and the meaning of what things were are
[23:59] you know
[24:01] and maybe jesus was saying nicodemus
[24:03] remember now it
[24:05] it does get down in there to talk about
[24:08] the heart
[24:10] you know
[24:11] it gets down to talking about the
[24:13] knowing of god
[24:15] and the
[24:16] heart and how the
[24:19] heart of man is
[24:21] not the thumping gizzard we call the one
[24:22] you can replace
[24:24] well that's what everybody's worried
[24:25] about they're worried about where to go
[24:27] and get a heart transplant
[24:29] because they're worried that they might
[24:30] get somebody else's heart or soul
[24:33] you know
[24:34] i've always said i want a brain
[24:36] transplant but now make sure you get the
[24:38] right one
[24:39] i don't want somebody as old as i am
[24:42] to get another brain you know
[24:46] but you understand what i'm trying to
[24:47] make the point
[24:50] that they're discussing the scriptures
[24:52] and the scriptures are coming into view
[24:55] and nicodemus is discussing it with him
[24:58] and he's saying nicodemus you know
[25:00] there's got to be a
[25:01] uh
[25:02] a savior born
[25:05] yes i know those scriptures
[25:07] i know well you know the things that
[25:09] you're talking about and we're looking
[25:11] for the messiah to come
[25:14] and
[25:16] time goes on
[25:18] and as it goes on he stops and he says
[25:20] now
[25:21] nicodemus you remember
[25:24] there in ezekiel
[25:29] remember he says he must be born again
[25:30] nicodemus
[25:35] he says
[25:37] with nicodemus
[25:41] don't you know the bible speaks with
[25:42] these things
[25:44] he says yes
[25:46] we said we have our preconceived ideal
[25:49] because remember now
[25:51] the scriptures that i gave
[25:54] are all naturally related
[25:57] to the restoration of israel
[26:01] you know
[26:03] and them being into captivity and coming
[26:05] back and doing and and even the
[26:08] prophecies
[26:09] of the future and our nicodemus could
[26:11] say
[26:12] yes i know we're right in that time
[26:14] that we're under captivity
[26:17] to these romans and
[26:19] there's going to be a time that we're
[26:20] going to go out
[26:22] and we're going to be
[26:24] the people of god
[26:26] we said we are the people of god here in
[26:28] captivity
[26:31] you know but it'll have to take a time
[26:34] and jesus would say to him yeah but
[26:35] nicodemus
[26:37] look all of that was natural
[26:42] now maybe it'll help you to understand
[26:44] that scripture
[26:46] and he says if i speak to you of natural
[26:47] things
[26:49] and you don't understand
[26:52] because really see he or understood the
[26:55] natural things type the spiritual things
[26:59] is that the way we've been taught
[27:02] the natural type in the spiritual
[27:04] so he's saying nicodemus follow this
[27:06] line
[27:08] and look at look at
[27:11] ezekiel
[27:13] look at these about the new heart and
[27:15] your spirit
[27:17] yet you don't understand why i said you
[27:18] must be born again
[27:20] so doesn't that seemingly
[27:22] put you in a position that like
[27:24] something's got to happen
[27:27] to you
[27:29] and it's not just a total outward
[27:31] happening
[27:34] it's got to be an inward
[27:36] uh working
[27:37] you know
[27:39] well now you're beginning to get
[27:41] confusing to nicodemus because
[27:44] nicodemus is taught
[27:47] we are the people of god
[27:50] what else could we do to be the people
[27:53] of god
[27:54] what else would we want to be
[27:56] than to be the people of god
[28:00] and see jesus spoke throughout his whole
[28:02] ministry about it and he does there
[28:04] about the kingdom but you can't see it
[28:09] when nicodemus says
[28:11] all we want is to whoop these romans
[28:14] and take over
[28:17] sure there'll be an end to the world and
[28:19] sure we're going to be judged and sure
[28:21] there's going to be a resurrection
[28:23] you know
[28:25] but he couldn't follow the line
[28:28] then when jesus said it see you must be
[28:30] born
[28:31] from above because that's what nicodemus
[28:33] understood him to be saying we read it
[28:35] as he must be born again
[28:37] see nicodemus knew exactly what the man
[28:39] was saying
[28:40] he said what do you mean
[28:42] you got to be born from above
[28:47] he said my kingdom
[28:50] is none of this earth
[28:52] is that putting together a lot of
[28:53] scriptures
[28:55] that maybe they
[28:56] discussed my kingdom is not of this
[28:59] earth
[29:01] my kingdom is from above
[29:05] i came from above
[29:09] and you must be born from where i came
[29:11] from nicodemus says
[29:14] you're already getting rough now because
[29:16] we remember your mom and daddy
[29:18] you know
[29:22] but he said nicodemus don't you remember
[29:25] you was probably standing there today
[29:27] that
[29:29] my mom came in hunting for me
[29:32] and said
[29:33] your father and i
[29:35] maybe he was some of those
[29:38] lawyers and doctors and people that were
[29:41] standing there you know because that's
[29:42] what they're doing i i get to thinking
[29:44] about that sometimes i think well why
[29:46] wouldn't that be nice wouldn't it be
[29:47] something that all you do is you get up
[29:49] in the morning and all day long you just
[29:51] think about god you talk about god you
[29:52] go to bed at night you think about god
[29:54] you talk about god
[29:57] well see some of the people stood out
[29:59] and amazing and i listened to brother
[30:01] branham you just think about it you
[30:02] remember gamalia
[30:05] gamaya was the one i believe that said
[30:07] what you'll be happily fighting humor
[30:09] nicodemus one you know said you better
[30:10] leave this alone said you'll be fighting
[30:12] against god
[30:13] all right
[30:14] and see the man seen something
[30:17] but his eyes could not be opened
[30:20] because the spirit of god had not been
[30:22] given to comprehend
[30:24] all right
[30:25] so he he goes to that point of talking
[30:27] with the lord jesus
[30:30] and in that conversation you know that
[30:32] he says
[30:33] but look
[30:36] i know you're right
[30:40] but i just can't follow you
[30:47] church i've done that and been there
[30:51] you talk to people and try to get them
[30:52] to see what you're talking about you try
[30:55] to get them to see the message
[30:57] the things of god daniel 70 weeks the
[30:59] seals
[31:00] the different things
[31:03] and you sit there and look at them and
[31:04] you
[31:05] you know these are well-trained people
[31:08] you know some older than i was and the
[31:11] things you know
[31:12] and you think about why can't they see
[31:14] it
[31:16] you know and each one of you can think
[31:19] the same way
[31:21] remember the people you talk to
[31:23] and you try your best to help them in
[31:25] love and understanding
[31:27] but they just walk away from you
[31:30] not that they hate you or or anything
[31:33] they just can't understand you
[31:36] you're speaking from somewhere else
[31:40] they are only natural
[31:42] because irregardless the best you could
[31:44] do in organized religion and the biggest
[31:46] portion of people in the message they
[31:48] still have their mindset on something
[31:49] natural something you know
[31:52] here
[31:54] all right
[31:58] it looked like nicodemus could have
[31:59] understood
[32:01] because why not compare
[32:04] john 3
[32:06] with ezekiel
[32:08] 36.
[32:12] right
[32:15] you must be born to water
[32:17] and a spirit
[32:21] well
[32:21] over here you've got
[32:24] you know you're dealing with three
[32:25] things all over in ezekiel you're
[32:27] dealing with three things this marvelous
[32:29] way wade was bringing it out wednesday
[32:32] see
[32:34] and i just thought well it's a maybe a
[32:36] good time to do this
[32:38] and then when something clicked i said
[32:40] well
[32:41] okay
[32:42] i know he's planning on going into this
[32:44] and yeah i'll get my part out of the way
[32:45] now and then i won't preach on the rest
[32:48] of the year
[32:49] so
[32:50] you know
[32:53] but think about it
[32:56] it's easy for israel
[32:59] to think about
[33:02] something natural
[33:07] if jesus had said to nicodemus nicodemus
[33:11] don't you realize one of these days we
[33:13] jews will rule the world
[33:16] oh nicodemus
[33:18] or he'd come up
[33:20] you know
[33:21] but it's always a natural
[33:24] thing to them
[33:28] let's go talk to the people of the world
[33:31] and try to show them
[33:32] the message of the hour
[33:37] and they'll go to the natural every time
[33:40] right
[33:41] i mean
[33:42] but they can't help it we're not
[33:43] throwing off on them
[33:46] thank god for god opening our eyes
[33:49] right that we may see
[33:52] all right
[33:54] well let's go to number seven there and
[33:55] just get a little point i just want to
[33:57] say a few things
[33:59] and then i want to
[34:00] get into some other things and
[34:02] illustrate a little bit but
[34:04] it's after you get up so far
[34:08] looks like people will begin to
[34:09] understand
[34:12] look at ezekiel 32
[34:14] behold i will gather them out of all
[34:16] countries which will be a natural thing
[34:20] right
[34:22] but remember the natural of the
[34:23] gathering and coming back to israel is
[34:25] only speaking
[34:27] of the spiritual which is the 144
[34:29] thousand that come into redemption
[34:31] and even israel as a nation going into
[34:34] the millennium and the things they're
[34:35] greater things than just occupying land
[34:38] and
[34:39] doing them behold i will gather them out
[34:41] of all the countries whether i've driven
[34:43] them in my anger and in my fury in great
[34:46] wrath
[34:47] and i will bring them again unto this
[34:50] place
[34:51] and i'll cause them to dwell safely
[34:54] once
[34:54] and they shall be my people
[34:57] is that that statement again
[34:59] and i will be their god
[35:02] i will give them
[35:04] one heart
[35:06] in one way
[35:09] jesus said i'm the way the truth of the
[35:10] life
[35:12] that they may fear me forever for the
[35:14] good of them and their children after
[35:16] them i will make an everlasting covenant
[35:18] with them
[35:20] that i will not turn away from them
[35:23] to thee
[35:24] to do
[35:25] them good but i will put my fear in
[35:28] their hearts
[35:30] that they shall not depart from me
[35:34] now he's going to enter into the man
[35:37] right
[35:38] into his heart
[35:40] i'll rejoice over them that do good and
[35:42] i would plant them in their land but
[35:44] surely with my whole heart
[35:46] and with my whole
[35:48] soul
[35:49] now uh-oh
[35:51] now he's not talking about theirs
[35:54] right
[35:56] you get it
[35:58] plant them in this land assuredly with
[36:01] my whole heart
[36:04] and with my whole soul
[36:08] now he's bringing it down to
[36:12] and i believe don't you that
[36:15] jesus is the heart and soul of god don't
[36:17] you
[36:18] don't you believe that that's who he was
[36:22] see now he's beginning to
[36:26] into the scriptures
[36:29] but now look
[36:33] drop back now ezekiel 11 17
[36:38] therefore say thus saith the lord god i
[36:41] will gather them from the people
[36:44] and assemble them out of the countries
[36:45] where they have been scattered
[36:47] and i'll give you the land of israel
[36:51] and they shall come hither remember he
[36:53] did do that
[36:55] right
[36:56] and they shall come to the other and
[36:58] they shall take away all the detestable
[37:00] things are of and all the abominations
[37:03] are from thence
[37:05] and i will give them
[37:07] one heart
[37:10] he's going to give
[37:12] remember
[37:13] before
[37:15] my whole
[37:17] heart
[37:18] my soul
[37:21] right
[37:22] you remember the scripture before you
[37:24] know my heart my soul
[37:26] now look what he's saying and i'll give
[37:28] them one heart
[37:31] all right
[37:33] and i will put a new spirit within you
[37:37] and i'll take away their stony heart out
[37:39] of their flesh
[37:40] and give them a heart of flesh
[37:43] now he don't take the heart out put
[37:45] another one in
[37:48] he simply softens
[37:50] that heart
[37:53] are you with me
[37:55] to take out the stony heart
[37:59] and put in a heart of flesh is a simple
[38:01] matter to me of saying i'll take away
[38:04] your stoning your hardness your
[38:07] arrogance your your doings
[38:11] and i'll give you
[38:12] a heart of flesh
[38:15] political soft
[38:17] nice
[38:20] he simply takes us
[38:24] and he works on us
[38:27] right
[38:28] give you a
[38:30] heart that's correct
[38:35] you'll remember
[38:36] you can't have the new birth until you
[38:38] come this away amen
[38:41] what
[38:43] that they may walk in my statutes and
[38:44] keep mine ordinances
[38:46] and do them and they shall be my people
[38:49] there it is again right
[38:51] and i will be their god
[38:55] but it's for them whose heart
[38:57] walketh after the heart of their
[38:59] detestable things and their abominations
[39:03] i will recompense their way upon their
[39:06] own heads
[39:08] with the lord
[39:11] if god didn't give us a soft heart right
[39:18] how could he save us
[39:22] right
[39:24] ezekiel 18.
[39:26] see this building up to 36
[39:29] all right
[39:31] cast away from you all your
[39:33] transgressions
[39:34] whereby you have transgressed
[39:37] and make you a new heart
[39:40] and a new spirit
[39:44] first he said i'll do it now he says
[39:46] you're doing it
[39:49] right
[39:50] come on
[39:52] and make you a new heart and your
[39:54] spirit for why will you die house of
[39:57] israel i have no pleasure in the death
[39:59] of that all right
[40:03] but look i can't
[40:06] i can't do anything
[40:09] the bible says
[40:11] the goodness of god
[40:13] leadeth thee to repentance
[40:18] brother branham says
[40:21] once in contact
[40:24] right
[40:25] once you contact the supernatural
[40:30] he said you'll never be the same
[40:36] the day i saw him in that church i wish
[40:37] i could have got somebody to led me to
[40:39] him
[40:40] but i had no one that could lead me
[40:42] there
[40:43] he said well you mean important well
[40:45] they couldn't
[40:49] but from that day on i had a change of
[40:52] heart
[40:58] take away the stony heart
[41:01] is that ezekiel 36 when we get on into
[41:04] the
[41:05] scriptures
[41:07] but look
[41:08] make you a new heart
[41:13] well i can't do nothing save myself
[41:17] no but you can quit acting like the
[41:18] devil because he don't need no help
[41:25] lord comes along trying to help you see
[41:27] like i said if i had somebody
[41:31] i've told you
[41:33] you don't believe it i'm sure
[41:35] but i told you that even when i got into
[41:36] sin
[41:38] it's coming on up as a child that
[41:41] i'd do things wrong and i'd re i would
[41:43] say god
[41:44] you know i didn't know to say god or
[41:45] this i just i don't want to act like
[41:48] this
[41:50] sure into pleasures for a moment
[41:55] well what good are pleasures for a
[41:57] moment
[41:58] when you got the rest of the day
[42:00] amen right
[42:02] you got to live yourself for a while
[42:08] i just don't understand how people could
[42:10] slap a little child and just wham
[42:13] you know just stop them
[42:15] or kill people or do something like that
[42:18] i don't understand that
[42:22] because i had no thoughts like that when
[42:23] i was a sinner
[42:28] huh
[42:30] so i i think it's it's wonderful
[42:34] for you to try
[42:36] you know
[42:37] well ain't no need me trying
[42:41] ain't no need you're trying to work
[42:44] you know
[42:46] i mean your sisters
[42:48] well i don't understand it
[42:50] i don't understand that about hiring a
[42:51] dress
[42:54] well i'll just get you a playboy
[42:55] magazine and let you see some stories
[42:59] i don't mean to be nasty hateful you
[43:01] don't see prostitutes
[43:03] with short hire
[43:05] bob dolph and everything else
[43:08] right
[43:12] what's the sign of a woman
[43:14] oh ball head
[43:20] wrong bathroom
[43:22] right
[43:24] i mean you go to the bathroom what's on
[43:25] the bathroom
[43:29] anywhere you can read or what you can do
[43:31] you look on the bathroom
[43:33] and you tell which one of them to go
[43:34] into
[43:35] and it all got higher
[43:38] maybe not way down but they've got her
[43:40] and they got a dress on them
[43:44] well you know
[43:46] i mean we don't have to lay down
[43:48] and just do what the devil wants us to
[43:50] do
[43:54] i didn't drink
[43:58] kids sure we puffed the smoke probably
[44:00] smoked maybe
[44:02] half a dozen cigarettes my whole life
[44:05] only loved
[44:06] uh cigars
[44:09] maybe five
[44:13] and i've done that as a sinner
[44:18] and i don't understand it because
[44:22] number one
[44:23] i couldn't afford it
[44:32] i went to work
[44:34] i told you
[44:36] the first paycheck i got i had a tooth
[44:39] that was just killing me
[44:40] i went to the dentist
[44:46] i made a down payment
[44:49] on my mother a set of teeth
[44:52] from my first paycheck at 15 years old
[44:57] she had her teeth pulled but couldn't
[44:58] afford
[45:00] to
[45:00] my teeth
[45:04] i really couldn't afford to drink
[45:08] but you know what then i said i don't
[45:10] want it
[45:12] never used to get me when the boys would
[45:14] come in and say boy i got drunk life now
[45:16] i had a time but i don't remember what
[45:18] i'd done
[45:20] i said i didn't get drunk and i know
[45:22] what i'd done
[45:27] right
[45:30] but you see that's what we
[45:32] we do
[45:33] that's why it says
[45:35] make you
[45:36] work on yourself a little bit
[45:39] well was it wednesday night wade was
[45:41] talking about well brother brown said
[45:42] you've got a stingy spirit

[46:04] stay in the place it was and arranged
[46:06] the way it was
[46:08] and i've seen a lot of people run their
[46:09] mouth with big old long cuss words
[46:12] and they wound up bloody all over
[46:15] well
[46:17] you know what
[46:20] say what you want to

[46:27] of being
[46:28] a decent guy
[46:36] brother dale i just well okay that's you
[46:40] i'm just describing that it can be done
[46:45] not telling you what you had to do

[46:54] sinners brother conley i said that one
[46:57] night he got up later he said brother
[46:58] dale ain't never been like the rest of
[47:00] us he'll not be saying that i said yeah
[47:02] but see i know
[47:05] i know how close it is

[47:11] in a good life
[47:14] and not be saved
[47:21] why don't you do a little working on
[47:22] your own shoulder thanks
[47:25] that will made me do it

[47:58] the only person i offered to whip
[48:00] in my day was three boys
[48:02] they told i was drunk
[48:05] i said one at the time or all three
[48:09] i said god i don't do it
[48:12] i don't drink
[48:14] everybody thinks it's so wonderful
[48:17] you know
[48:18] no
[48:20] i don't like to be nasty but
[48:23] i had a brother-in-law that he went to a
[48:24] lot of parties
[48:26] he didn't get as drunk as the rest of
[48:28] them
[48:29] so we had every girl there
[48:35] plain language
[48:40] you can do some good things
[48:45] well that's working out my salvation no
[48:47] all of that didn't save me god remember
[48:50] you're looking at a boy
[48:52] that spent 10 years in the baptist
[48:54] church five as a deacon
[48:56] and come out of there not born again
[49:00] till i come in this message
[49:04] don't
[49:05] play your pity patterns with me it don't
[49:07] work
[49:10] but think about it
[49:12] now let's look at this for a second that
[49:14] i said i don't want to spend much time
[49:16] on what i'm doing but be alright if i
[49:18] preach to five o'clock
[49:21] i ain't preaching much lately
[49:24] okay
[49:26] we look at ezekiel 36
[49:32] let's just think about it wade
[49:34] little marvelous and he'll get back to
[49:36] this
[49:38] he talks about bringing them to their
[49:40] land which have said that's a natural
[49:41] thing
[49:43] they were coming back to their land that
[49:44] was natural and he said i'll sprinkle
[49:46] you with clean water upon you and you
[49:48] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[49:50] and all your idols
[49:52] well i cleanse you now he deals with
[49:54] something else
[49:55] a new heart also will i give you and a
[49:58] new spirit will i put within you
[50:00] and i'll take away the stony heart out
[50:02] of your flesh and i'll give you a heart
[50:04] of flesh
[50:06] i will put my spirit within you and
[50:07] cause you to walk in my statures and you
[50:09] shall keep my judgments and do them and
[50:11] you shall dwell in the land that i gave
[50:14] to your father
[50:16] here's that scripture again
[50:19] and you shall be my people
[50:21] and i'll be your god
[50:23] amen
[50:24] try running something like that through
[50:26] the bible sometimes with your
[50:27] concordances and just read them
[50:29] and watch how many times this has been
[50:31] said
[50:33] it just comes out wonderful doesn't he
[50:35] all right but watch now
[50:39] what's the order the prophet said and we
[50:41] won't spend but a second on it
[50:43] what's the order of it
[50:45] a new heart will also i give you and
[50:47] your spirit will i put within you i'll
[50:49] take away the stony heart out of your
[50:51] flesh and i'll give you a heart of flesh
[50:53] now
[50:54] and i will put my spirit within you
[50:57] all right now most people think that
[50:59] they take this is the new heart and the
[51:00] new spirit they think that's salvation
[51:02] it's working on you
[51:07] but that's not the holy spirit when he
[51:08] even says and i'll give you a new spirit
[51:12] that's not the holy spirit
[51:15] but ron says you can't even live with
[51:18] yourself
[51:20] i've seen people that were so
[51:22] miserable
[51:23] i guess if i'd have been as miserable as
[51:25] they would i'd have got drunk every day
[51:27] but i've seen people that are so
[51:28] miserable
[51:30] i see people now in this message it's
[51:32] just
[51:33] i mean it's so miserable
[51:36] what's wrong
[51:39] well you ain't been done like i've been
[51:41] doing
[51:44] well
[51:46] wowzy wowsy woo
[51:53] you've never been treated the way i've
[51:55] been treated with
[51:56] what does that make you
[52:01] right
[52:02] well see i give you a new heart and your
[52:04] spirit we won't go through them but you
[52:06] know that wade gave him wednesday
[52:09] if you need it
[52:11] what does it take to make a christian
[52:15] he says i'll give you a new heart
[52:18] and i give you a new spirit
[52:20] all right
[52:23] and i'll take away your stony heart out
[52:25] of your flesh and i'll give you a heart
[52:27] of flesh
[52:28] all right
[52:30] now
[52:32] that's justification and sanctification
[52:34] right
[52:37] justification
[52:40] and sanctification
[52:42] and then i'll put my spirit in you
[52:47] that's the holy spirit
[52:49] all right
[52:51] see then justification
[52:53] is when your sins are chopped off
[52:56] right
[52:59] and when it does
[53:03] you come to sanctification
[53:06] cleansing and setting aside
[53:08] and there's where you come up with that
[53:10] new spirit
[53:11] and that new heart part and we're
[53:13] talking about heart we're not talking
[53:14] about gizzards
[53:16] right soul
[53:19] soul of mankind is the heart of mankind
[53:22] that's what you are
[53:25] all right
[53:26] but here's where i think that most
[53:28] people miss it because they've always
[53:30] got to have some kind of uh
[53:33] a doings
[53:36] and uh
[53:37] something that they can figure out that
[53:38] they think it makes it look right
[53:41] but i've got to express this where to be
[53:43] on here
[53:44] when you start talking about soul body
[53:46] spirit etc
[53:48] just remember how we've always taught
[53:50] you
[53:51] up until 1962
[53:53] on the greatest battle ever fought
[53:56] up to that point brother branham
[53:58] basically covers
[54:00] body
[54:01] soul
[54:03] spirit
[54:06] all right
[54:07] he uses it interchangeably at times but
[54:10] yet that's the basics of his speaking
[54:13] that the three circles
[54:16] that we look at
[54:18] so go ahead and pull that up brother on
[54:20] the circles we'll use that to start with
[54:24] because they're doing a marvelous job
[54:26] they got some things in here that wade
[54:27] can use later
[54:28] but just pull up the one where it shows
[54:30] and the you know the
[54:32] thing
[54:34] but remember after 62
[54:37] then he covers body
[54:39] spirit
[54:41] and soul all right
[54:43] you know what i believe that is
[54:46] that is the opening of the word to the
[54:48] prophet
[54:51] you know what
[54:54] but i've always told you now
[54:56] anybody on the internet listening
[54:58] go back and check it
[55:00] he would go body
[55:02] soul spirit
[55:04] then he made it in the last days body
[55:07] spirit
[55:08] soul
[55:10] but you check it and see if i'm right
[55:12] he never changed the senses
[55:15] of the position he was talking about
[55:17] first position
[55:19] body would be see taste filled smell in
[55:21] your
[55:22] right
[55:24] so here we got it see taste filled
[55:26] smelling here
[55:29] always give five senses for the body
[55:31] the second realm no matter what he
[55:33] called it
[55:35] heart head brain whatever
[55:38] soul spirit he always gave that five
[55:41] senses
[55:43] all right what was it
[55:45] imagination conscious memory reasoning
[55:48] affection
[55:51] and he always gave the center realm
[55:55] only one sense
[55:57] i can show you these that's greatest
[55:59] battle ever fought
[56:01] where he says his faith or doubt
[56:05] it's not faith and doubt that would put
[56:08] the devil inside of the soul of man
[56:11] along with god
[56:12] that's why i can't follow the doctrine
[56:15] of all these seed things
[56:17] i know what brother branham taught amen
[56:21] amen
[56:23] but you put god and the devil in the
[56:25] same place you got a problem because my
[56:29] bible says
[56:30] god will not dwell
[56:33] in an unclean vessel
[56:39] yes you don't care what the bible says
[56:41] it's like i've always said everybody
[56:43] says the soul
[56:45] is just the nature of the spirit
[56:47] i want that quote
[56:51] boy
[56:52] to see people sitting down at the top
[56:53] writer they're getting ready to do it
[56:55] but remember
[56:59] i want the quote as he said it
[57:03] brother branham never say it the soul is
[57:06] just the nature of the spirit i want to
[57:09] quote
[57:11] he said the soul is the nature of the
[57:13] spirit
[57:14] well that's all the same thing
[57:16] no it ain't
[57:19] soul is the nature of the spirit that
[57:21] can be made something but if it's just
[57:23] the nature of the spirit it's like a dog
[57:25] or a cat or anything
[57:27] you can't put it in the correct order
[57:31] but see your two soul people
[57:33] they quote that around the world
[57:37] that the soul is just the nature of
[57:40] there is no quote
[57:45] but that makes me a sarcastic
[57:48] arrogant hateful oh dude
[57:50] thank you
[57:51] now what are you gonna do
[57:54] we see it's faith
[57:57] or doubt
[57:58] that's what he says on blasphemy
[58:01] oh the greatest battle ever fought
[58:04] one of them dominates you he said
[58:08] because god and the devil can't be in
[58:10] there at the same time
[58:15] he can't be in your soul at the same
[58:17] time
[58:19] now remember
[58:21] you're not born again in your body
[58:24] you're not born again in your spirit
[58:30] you're born again in your soul
[58:35] justification
[58:40] works from in here
[58:45] that's where you sin from
[58:50] sanctification works from in here
[58:53] that's where you're dirty at
[58:56] no no no no you're dirty
[58:58] it works from there into here
[59:05] right
[59:08] you're not born again in your body
[59:10] you're not born again in your spirit
[59:12] you're born again in your soul
[59:16] brethren says on children in prison
[59:18] the nature of that soul is god
[59:21] if you are born again
[59:23] said if not it is of the world
[59:28] you do what you want to
[59:31] well i got it figured out this way well
[59:33] let's see you figure it out
[59:37] people will take three objects and
[59:39] they'll
[59:40] put this object
[59:41] and then they'll put that object inside
[59:43] of that object and that inside of that
[59:45] object
[59:47] and whatever you're doing
[59:50] if one of them is body nothing spirit
[59:52] not soul
[59:54] you're trying to be your best to save
[59:56] each one
[1:00:01] but it's very very simple
[1:00:04] if you take it correctly
[1:00:08] and remember what happened to you
[1:00:11] you're not born again in your body
[1:00:15] i wish we were amen
[1:00:18] you're not born again in your spirit
[1:00:20] i wish we were
[1:00:21] let me quote
[1:00:23] brother used to quote it was a good one
[1:00:25] he said i wish we were baptized with the
[1:00:27] holy spirit on our brain you know
[1:00:32] but it won't work
[1:00:36] here's salvation
[1:00:38] this is the works and manifestation of
[1:00:42] the individual
[1:00:46] you can't sin with this body
[1:00:50] it has no ability to sin
[1:00:56] it in the head put it asleep you do what
[1:00:58] you want to and then go by you
[1:01:01] you're getting closer when you're
[1:01:03] getting into the memory reasoning
[1:01:04] conscience
[1:01:06] but here's where the old man's at
[1:01:09] here's what's causing us to do it from
[1:01:11] the inside
[1:01:16] because remember
[1:01:20] the three rings
[1:01:22] now keep that in mind
[1:01:25] the three rings
[1:01:27] is the key
[1:01:29] to understand brother random in the way
[1:01:31] he's talking
[1:01:34] all right
[1:01:36] now let me show you something simple
[1:01:39] that i'd like you to do and i am going
[1:01:41] to have to use three objects
[1:01:43] because my wife said you ain't pouring
[1:01:45] water all over the platform
[1:01:51] she said you get up there and start
[1:01:52] pouring this out of that into that said
[1:01:54] you're gonna have a mess
[1:01:55] that's okay honey i won't do it
[1:01:59] but i want you to think about very
[1:02:00] little simple something
[1:02:04] there you are
[1:02:10] body spirit and soul
[1:02:16] now i ask you a question
[1:02:18] sister gayle here we go
[1:02:22] that's coke in here to make it look
[1:02:23] black
[1:02:28] is that
[1:02:30] black coke inside that bottle or outside
[1:02:32] of it
[1:02:35] well i know it is because i seen you set
[1:02:38] it up
[1:02:39] but remember
[1:02:40] optical illusions
[1:02:45] i can set a device there that runs that
[1:02:48] on the outside
[1:02:50] as well as on the inside
[1:02:53] he said what are you getting at
[1:02:55] hold on
[1:02:57] hold on think about it
[1:03:01] you see
[1:03:02] that's the quote brother when it weighed
[1:03:05] gave wednesday
[1:03:09] and then north at night pull up number
[1:03:11] 19 brother we do need that one
[1:03:15] look number 19.
[1:03:19] it's often north at night
[1:03:21] 1965
[1:03:23] paragraph 1
[1:03:25] 20 through 124.
[1:03:28] all right i may have to drink one of
[1:03:30] these bottles in a minute
[1:03:32] we might empty one of them
[1:03:34] but that's all right
[1:03:38] remember now this is 1965.
[1:03:44] this outside man is the flesh
[1:03:47] that's what we look at
[1:03:49] what we see
[1:03:51] where he stands
[1:03:57] now this outside man is a flesh that's
[1:03:58] what we look at
[1:04:00] what we see
[1:04:02] and it has five inlets to that body
[1:04:05] and any grammar school can go through it
[1:04:07] you know five senses what see tasteful
[1:04:08] smell here without that you can't touch
[1:04:10] nobody touch the body
[1:04:12] that's the only way you have to the body
[1:04:14] see tastes filled
[1:04:16] now this is the evil one
[1:04:18] on the outside
[1:04:22] so they're before you as a bottle and i
[1:04:23] hope they can pull it in without
[1:04:26] bouncing off of things
[1:04:28] to look at it
[1:04:31] that's as black as can be
[1:04:35] that was me
[1:04:38] i'll say it that way
[1:04:40] because you that don't believe it you
[1:04:42] don't want to put yourself there
[1:04:45] that was me as a sinner
[1:04:50] body
[1:04:51] spirit
[1:04:52] and soul
[1:05:00] you can't tell whether it's inside or
[1:05:02] outside
[1:05:05] because it's all together as one person
[1:05:10] me let's read it
[1:05:13] now inside of that is a spirit which you
[1:05:15] become when you're born into the earth
[1:05:18] and you breathe the breath of life
[1:05:20] he's breathed to you into him
[1:05:23] that spirit is of a worldly nature
[1:05:24] because it was not
[1:05:26] given from god not but it was given
[1:05:29] permitted by god
[1:05:32] a sinful spirit can't come from god
[1:05:35] forget it
[1:05:37] all right
[1:05:40] now you got that
[1:05:42] and every child
[1:05:45] that's born in the world
[1:05:47] is born in sin shape it in iniquity come
[1:05:51] to the world speaking lies
[1:05:53] and right
[1:05:54] so that person inside there is a sinner
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:00] to begin with
[1:06:04] that's me
[1:06:08] a full product of satan's domain
[1:06:12] that god permitted to happen
[1:06:15] to where he could save me
[1:06:19] but that's me
[1:06:21] my body was of the world
[1:06:25] the nature of my spirit was of the devil
[1:06:28] and my soul was lost
[1:06:32] and needed salvation
[1:06:35] don't try to do no white washings
[1:06:38] remember i read that this morning
[1:06:40] no white wars
[1:06:42] that is you
[1:06:44] that's me
[1:06:46] totally
[1:06:49] now here's the key to what's the point
[1:06:53] so what does he get to
[1:06:55] conscious remember
[1:06:58] you can't think without it all your
[1:06:59] faculties
[1:07:01] all that works
[1:07:02] all right
[1:07:04] but your spirit can still reason
[1:07:08] five senses that controls that inside
[1:07:10] man
[1:07:12] now the last man which is the soul
[1:07:15] that's it
[1:07:17] there is only one sense that controls
[1:07:20] that
[1:07:21] and that is free moral agency
[1:07:24] free will
[1:07:26] will to choose or to reject
[1:07:31] up until the age of accountability i
[1:07:33] will not deal with what this was or what
[1:07:35] that says that we're just going to start
[1:07:37] where we start at
[1:07:39] because up until then god didn't credit
[1:07:41] it but still the bible says born in sin
[1:07:44] shaping an iniquity spousal mother's
[1:07:46] womb go forth a liar
[1:07:48] every person the prophet said whether it
[1:07:50] was priest king prophet or whom
[1:07:57] all right
[1:07:59] in the book of
[1:08:03] let's get back to my notes when somebody
[1:08:05] help me
[1:08:06] broken ruth
[1:08:09] in the book of ruth
[1:08:12] you'll find that there's one closer kin
[1:08:14] to ruth than boaz was
[1:08:17] and brother branham says that fellow
[1:08:19] represented the devil
[1:08:21] in top
[1:08:23] you know what
[1:08:24] you and i
[1:08:25] was born
[1:08:27] in satan's domain
[1:08:29] now i want you to show me where you're
[1:08:32] going to put these little white dots
[1:08:38] these little seeds
[1:08:45] if you put it in there
[1:08:47] you are the one dealing with it i know
[1:08:49] out on the internet you're listening
[1:08:50] you'll probably flick this off forget it
[1:08:52] but you've got all them seed doctrines
[1:08:54] put it in that bottle
[1:08:57] and i'll quote the scripture god won't
[1:08:59] dwell in an unclean
[1:09:05] but vessel see
[1:09:07] we don't care what the truth is
[1:09:11] we've got our own little belief
[1:09:17] well i want it in the bible and i want
[1:09:20] it in the prophet's message
[1:09:22] he said if you have eternal life
[1:09:24] you always was eternal you know why
[1:09:27] because eternal life is eternal life
[1:09:31] but he says you were lost
[1:09:35] and doomed and on the way to hell
[1:09:40] right here
[1:09:42] black is soot
[1:09:44] no whites
[1:09:46] no spots
[1:09:48] black is stuck
[1:09:51] all right
[1:09:53] so now what do you do
[1:09:58] you remember the story that he gave
[1:10:03] on the future home
[1:10:08] when he gets in the future home he gives
[1:10:10] you an understanding
[1:10:14] that's on kinsman redeemer paragraph 178
[1:10:18] first you belong to him
[1:10:20] because you're his property
[1:10:23] where he was born in sin shaping him
[1:10:26] all right
[1:10:30] but you see this is what we need
[1:10:36] right
[1:10:37] that shouldn't be no light bulb turned
[1:10:38] on
[1:10:39] that ought to be sensible so we're not
[1:10:41] going to pour this out and put that in
[1:10:42] we're going to
[1:10:45] take this another way
[1:10:51] that was me before i was born again
[1:10:56] and i'm going to say this the way i mean
[1:10:57] it because i got another bottle
[1:11:00] this is me
[1:11:04] getting ready for a change
[1:11:14] are you listening
[1:11:15] so where am i at now brother dale
[1:11:20] right
[1:11:24] here hope that shows up enough
[1:11:29] on the screens and showing it there's
[1:11:31] some lines drawn in there
[1:11:34] that is in your body and your spirit
[1:11:38] the inside is perfectly totally pure
[1:11:42] but the body and the spirit
[1:11:47] is still in satan's domain
[1:11:50] and subject to all of them little
[1:11:53] things so i drawed it with a
[1:11:57] you little stripes in the body that's
[1:11:59] not on the inside
[1:12:04] all right
[1:12:06] well brother dale then
[1:12:08] how do we get rid of these stripes
[1:12:13] because you said this is what we need it
[1:12:15] to be
[1:12:23] now you think there's not a revival
[1:12:25] going on
[1:12:26] you think something ain't taking place
[1:12:30] you see when we walk off of here
[1:12:32] in the rapture
[1:12:38] after understanding what's taking place
[1:12:41] with the statue of a perfect man
[1:12:45] that's what we're going to
[1:12:48] be we're going to be pure and white
[1:12:52] and lily
[1:12:53] but just remember
[1:12:55] i have to put the guys up together
[1:12:59] but just remember
[1:13:03] that was me
[1:13:05] that was totally body spirit and soul
[1:13:08] lost
[1:13:10] and doomed it on the way to hell
[1:13:14] god came down
[1:13:16] put a new birth inside
[1:13:20] that's the same guy
[1:13:23] that's why i would have poured him out
[1:13:24] but you know
[1:13:26] that's the same guy
[1:13:28] but he's gone through
[1:13:30] justification sanctification
[1:13:33] in the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:35] and you notice i didn't leave it dark
[1:13:37] out here just left stripes because
[1:13:40] at the new birth we ain't supposed to be
[1:13:41] living like the devil
[1:13:47] right
[1:13:48] that's you
[1:13:50] that's me
[1:13:51] but when we leave here
[1:13:54] that's what we'll be
[1:13:59] not three bottles
[1:14:02] same bottle
[1:14:04] same person
[1:14:05] that's me
[1:14:10] that's me after the new birth
[1:14:13] that i've still got some problems
[1:14:16] but this is the man i longed to be
[1:14:20] you know what
[1:14:21] all the same old man
[1:14:23] except for regeneration
[1:14:27] i chose to use the same type of bottles
[1:14:30] or at least we could stay with that much
[1:14:33] but i hope you understand what i'm
[1:14:34] talking about
[1:14:36] that was me before
[1:14:39] body spirit and soul lost that's me
[1:14:42] getting ready to go in the rapture
[1:14:44] body spirit and soul saved
[1:14:49] that's what the new birth
[1:14:54] does that's what it takes place
[1:14:58] all right
[1:15:01] you can read the message
[1:15:04] but i want to give a couple more little
[1:15:06] drawings
[1:15:07] i'll leave that up there to show but
[1:15:13] but around used another illustration
[1:15:16] remember this was the illustration that
[1:15:19] he used
[1:15:20] all right we can go through it wade went
[1:15:22] through it
[1:15:23] you can show where that
[1:15:24] the cup was out in the yard
[1:15:27] dirty
[1:15:28] everything right
[1:15:31] you don't pick up the cup and put it in
[1:15:33] service
[1:15:35] you pick it up that's justification
[1:15:38] you got a reason for it
[1:15:41] all right
[1:15:43] you cleanse it with water you know boil
[1:15:45] it that sanctification
[1:15:49] and took this out
[1:15:53] because that goes all the way to the
[1:15:54] inside of the individual because you're
[1:15:56] not born again in your body
[1:15:58] why don't you quit trying to work on
[1:16:00] that fella
[1:16:01] why don't you get in god and let him
[1:16:04] work on from the inside out
[1:16:10] but you pick up the bottle
[1:16:12] you don't put it in service
[1:16:16] you wash it
[1:16:18] be careful on that washing
[1:16:22] because there is a scripture that a lot
[1:16:24] of people don't want to deal with the
[1:16:26] bible speaks
[1:16:29] of the holy ghost and fire
[1:16:32] you remember that
[1:16:34] holy ghost and fire
[1:16:37] see the pentecostal that was a holy
[1:16:39] ghost and then a great fire coming
[1:16:42] you know
[1:16:46] brother branham says
[1:16:48] when the holy ghost comes in
[1:16:53] he burns all of you out
[1:16:56] right
[1:16:58] he burns you out
[1:17:00] puts his own life in
[1:17:04] the same bottle
[1:17:06] the same person
[1:17:09] oh without here at this
[1:17:11] computer brain but i'm not the same
[1:17:13] person
[1:17:15] i found out i was always was eternal
[1:17:18] that makes people just get tiddly
[1:17:20] little ice pimples all over you makes
[1:17:22] you feel so good
[1:17:24] go right ahead you're headed for the
[1:17:25] tribulation
[1:17:31] i think what the prophet's talking about
[1:17:34] see you a bunch of preachers out there
[1:17:35] you know it's not
[1:17:37] because you know you face the truth
[1:17:41] i've taught this for 40 something years
[1:17:46] ever since i come in the message
[1:17:51] pick up the glass
[1:17:54] he says you're not right yet
[1:17:57] he said wash the glass
[1:17:59] he said jesus then says the unclean
[1:18:01] spirit goeth out of a man
[1:18:04] and walketh in dry places see then
[1:18:06] that's what i would do here
[1:18:08] i would pour this out
[1:18:10] see
[1:18:13] shake it out real clean fill it back up
[1:18:14] with water
[1:18:17] shake it rest and find it's done come
[1:18:18] back to the house find it swept and
[1:18:20] garnished entered in the state of the
[1:18:22] person is seven times worse
[1:18:27] all right
[1:18:29] let's use another illustration
[1:18:33] go ahead with number 23.
[1:18:36] rather
[1:18:37] if you'll notice there's a lot left out
[1:18:38] of here so
[1:18:41] this was taken from the future home
[1:18:43] 1964.
[1:18:46] 8 20. he's drawing he says
[1:18:49] let's take this board a minute brother
[1:18:51] around draws
[1:18:52] illustration or on the blackboard
[1:18:56] now here is a human heart
[1:18:58] and i'm not a long ways from being an
[1:19:00] artist you're the human heart here's a
[1:19:02] human heart
[1:19:05] now to me
[1:19:06] if you're going to redeem
[1:19:09] it means to
[1:19:10] redeem
[1:19:12] it don't mean throw one away
[1:19:15] and get you something else
[1:19:18] right
[1:19:21] now watch it
[1:19:23] here's a whole new heart here's one this
[1:19:25] one here has snake that's sin
[1:19:28] he has his life remember that
[1:19:31] this one over here has a dove in it
[1:19:33] which is the holy spirit he has a life
[1:19:35] well this one here has
[1:19:38] snake what
[1:19:40] has malice hatred envy
[1:19:44] that's what's causing it
[1:19:46] is this fellow here well this one over
[1:19:48] here has love joy
[1:19:50] long suffering
[1:19:52] that's what does it
[1:19:53] all right
[1:19:56] so when you're asked or you are forgiven
[1:19:59] of your sins you've only done this taken
[1:20:02] that away
[1:20:03] he takes out sin
[1:20:07] but the thing that made you do it
[1:20:09] we'll show it in a draw in just a minute
[1:20:11] he put sin and he put a snake he said
[1:20:14] thing made you do it still there
[1:20:18] that's the old root of evil is still
[1:20:20] there notice then you repent and be
[1:20:22] baptized name of jesus christ i forgave
[1:20:24] you of your sin notice then secondly
[1:20:26] comes sanctification
[1:20:29] which sets our mind in order for
[1:20:31] holiness to think right taking away
[1:20:34] sanctification greek compound then next
[1:20:36] comes the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:39] the fire of god cleanses
[1:20:42] when that holy ghost comes in you at
[1:20:44] your new birth the fire is preceding the
[1:20:47] holy ghost
[1:20:48] it's not following the holy ghost
[1:20:51] it's not holy ghost and then a fire
[1:20:54] the fire precedes the holy ghost
[1:20:57] to burn out anything left
[1:21:03] right
[1:21:05] anything left
[1:21:08] see
[1:21:09] next time the baptism is no longer
[1:21:11] fire and holy god and god might dwell in
[1:21:13] us the fire of god cleanses our hearts
[1:21:15] from sin and puts the holy ghost inside
[1:21:18] and we bring forth the same life
[1:21:21] now
[1:21:22] the white brothers would pull up
[1:21:26] that little draw in it
[1:21:28] we've tried to make
[1:21:31] but you remember
[1:21:35] as this is one man
[1:21:39] this was us as lost
[1:21:43] doomed in on the way to hell
[1:21:45] this is what we look like when god gets
[1:21:47] through with us
[1:21:48] in regeneration now regeneration means i
[1:21:52] didn't throw the cup away
[1:21:54] remember i'm supposed to pour that over
[1:21:56] into here
[1:21:58] i didn't throw the cup away
[1:22:01] i redeemed the cup
[1:22:04] you realize brother brown says that even
[1:22:06] today you get the holy ghost
[1:22:09] wait a minute today you're sanctified he
[1:22:11] said say i said god lays a claim on your
[1:22:14] body
[1:22:18] the day you're sanctified
[1:22:21] he lays a claim on that body why because
[1:22:24] you ain't gonna get a new one
[1:22:26] so look what he does
[1:22:28] this is before the new birth
[1:22:31] this is the solar heart
[1:22:33] prophet said this is sin
[1:22:36] here's the snake and said here's his
[1:22:38] life you remember the quote
[1:22:41] see malice hatred envy is inside of it
[1:22:46] now take that same heart
[1:22:49] and convert it show the next one
[1:22:52] i wrote it where it would come up after
[1:22:54] the new birth
[1:22:55] dove
[1:22:58] love joy
[1:22:59] long sufferings
[1:23:01] it's the same heart
[1:23:04] it's the same person
[1:23:06] he's just redeemed
[1:23:09] redeemed don't mean to throw away
[1:23:14] you throw something away i don't know i
[1:23:16] don't know your whole body no more
[1:23:18] well then where are you going to get one
[1:23:20] oh i'm going to get a new one i want
[1:23:22] bible for it and i want to profit for it
[1:23:26] but a lot of people make that statement
[1:23:28] and you don't know what they mean
[1:23:30] brother did last night go get a new body
[1:23:33] well you don't know what they mean
[1:23:38] right
[1:23:41] i can say to you here as a church i
[1:23:43] believe in getting a new body all of you
[1:23:45] will raise your hand and say amen right
[1:23:47] go you know what i've taught
[1:23:50] it is not another one it's this body
[1:23:54] made
[1:23:55] new
[1:23:57] in regeneration
[1:24:00] in redemption
[1:24:03] the soul of man
[1:24:05] put the dove inside the man
[1:24:09] i want to make another drawing
[1:24:11] that brother branham didn't make
[1:24:16] but i want to put it all together so go
[1:24:18] ahead and show the last one
[1:24:20] we'll get through it
[1:24:22] there to me is what
[1:24:24] we need
[1:24:28] you understand what we started off with
[1:24:30] we started off with three round circles
[1:24:34] the body spirit
[1:24:37] soul
[1:24:38] you born again experience
[1:24:41] puts christ in you
[1:24:43] the hope of glory
[1:24:46] this man
[1:24:48] when he becomes redeemed
[1:24:50] it's the same man
[1:24:54] he's just redeemed
[1:24:59] but i'm not the man i used to be that's
[1:25:01] good songs
[1:25:04] and good things
[1:25:06] you say well i don't understand this
[1:25:08] about the lines
[1:25:09] in there but it's still there
[1:25:11] paul said the things i do i would not or
[1:25:13] would not
[1:25:15] he said if not said what it is he said
[1:25:16] it's sin in my body
[1:25:19] is that what he said
[1:25:23] he said so then with my body
[1:25:25] i served the law
[1:25:27] of sin
[1:25:31] not meaning he was a sinner inside
[1:25:34] the body and the spirit but one day the
[1:25:36] body and spirit
[1:25:38] is going to be one
[1:25:42] i started off with one
[1:25:45] lost
[1:25:46] here we are one redeemed
[1:25:52] taking the heart taking the things
[1:25:55] and talking about jesus christ
[1:25:58] and what he's done for you and i
[1:26:00] why do we need
[1:26:04] all of these other things everybody
[1:26:06] wants
[1:26:08] yeah but i just don't
[1:26:10] hear now here's what you do
[1:26:12] and you watch what i'm saying so
[1:26:14] get ready on internet you people out
[1:26:15] there
[1:26:19] see what you do is
[1:26:20] you don't want nothing
[1:26:23] we have become so
[1:26:25] spiritually minded
[1:26:27] as being in the message
[1:26:29] until we don't want
[1:26:31] to follow after
[1:26:33] what somebody else says
[1:26:37] we've got to figure it out
[1:26:46] we got to get it ourselves
[1:26:52] when a man told brother moat one time
[1:26:55] i'm old mentioned speaking on the statue
[1:26:56] of a perfect man
[1:26:58] and rapture and where it comes
[1:27:00] what ages don't tell me i want to study
[1:27:03] it out myself
[1:27:05] he came back about
[1:27:07] i forgot maybe three six months later
[1:27:10] you know what he done
[1:27:12] he preached the rapture was going to
[1:27:14] come
[1:27:17] because brother brown and made a
[1:27:18] statement that the rapture would come in
[1:27:19] the brother of the kindness age
[1:27:23] and he brought in philadelphia as
[1:27:25] brotherly kindness so he brought it all
[1:27:26] the way back down here to the sixth
[1:27:28] church age
[1:27:29] and said the rapture is coming in
[1:27:31] philadelphia
[1:27:32] sixth church angel
[1:27:35] because philadelphia means what brother
[1:27:36] dick
[1:27:38] brotherly kindness
[1:27:39] well you know brother branham
[1:27:41] he didn't even know that
[1:27:44] no he wasn't talking about cities and
[1:27:46] what they meant
[1:27:48] he's talking about the word of god
[1:27:51] but the brother said the rapture is
[1:27:53] coming in the sixth church age
[1:27:55] i said you know what brother mo
[1:27:57] he wasted a lot of time
[1:28:00] that's dirty
[1:28:02] and i said he wasted a lot of time
[1:28:05] but you know what
[1:28:06] i'm as honest as i can be without trying
[1:28:09] to be arrogant or hateful or smart
[1:28:10] eloquently but you know a lot of people
[1:28:12] if they just listen to some of these
[1:28:14] brothers around here preach
[1:28:16] they wouldn't have to study for a
[1:28:17] message
[1:28:20] they'd get all they wanted
[1:28:24] right
[1:28:26] but they ain't gonna do that i gotta get
[1:28:28] it myself
[1:28:31] i'm the one that came up with this
[1:28:36] i'm the one that started the two soul
[1:28:38] the seventh hundred verse of
[1:28:40] peru right
[1:28:43] brother dale ain't trying to start
[1:28:45] nothing
[1:28:46] i'm trying to get back to the original
[1:28:49] brother branham is the one i'm reading
[1:28:50] from
[1:28:53] and if i've misread something to you
[1:28:55] about what he said i want to know about
[1:28:57] it
[1:28:59] but if i've read what he said
[1:29:02] and just put an illustration to it
[1:29:05] you tell me what he's talking about when
[1:29:07] he said here's a heart and here's a
[1:29:08] heart he's showing that and over there
[1:29:09] is lost he's saying this and saved what
[1:29:11] is it same heart
[1:29:13] soul
[1:29:15] that's why i made the life straw and put
[1:29:16] it in our soul
[1:29:19] i believe in redemption
[1:29:23] i believe we're being
[1:29:25] born again don't you
[1:29:28] we're being redeemed come on musicians
[1:29:30] we're being born again we're being saved
[1:29:35] i hope you understood what i brought the
[1:29:37] last one comes and that's where way will
[1:29:39] fit in the statue of a perfect man
[1:29:42] is going to take all these lines out
[1:29:45] there will be no lines left when that
[1:29:47] man walks off the earth
[1:29:50] you say you mean you talking about
[1:29:51] sinless perfection now i'm talking about
[1:29:53] sinless god
[1:29:59] right
[1:30:01] because i thought the prophet said
[1:30:04] may i quoted listen he's coming back
[1:30:06] after a church that's
[1:30:08] perfect
[1:30:11] that's what i thought he said
[1:30:14] well if perfect perfect has got to mean
[1:30:17] ain't nothing wrong with it
[1:30:18] ain't no lines left
[1:30:23] what do you think about it
[1:30:25] i'm talking about the real you
[1:30:27] the real you that started out in sin
[1:30:31] that's where we started
[1:30:33] body spirit soul
[1:30:36] totally lost
[1:30:39] but he comes down
[1:30:41] and don't leave out nothing and redeems
[1:30:43] body spirit and soul
[1:30:45] you got the same
[1:30:46] person you don't have to have three or
[1:30:48] four cups and do
[1:30:50] you just know what you're doing
[1:30:54] know what to look forward to
[1:30:57] let's stand together
[1:30:59] what we got brother
[1:31:26] still
[1:31:32] we are the people of god
[1:31:41] fulfilled in our day
[1:31:52] i left out one but you
[1:31:55] you just read it when you get a change
[1:32:12] it's in corinthians
[1:32:19] when you get into corinthians i'll find
[1:32:20] it in a minute
[1:32:26] you know what it'll wind up being
[1:32:28] the gentiles
[1:32:32] the gentiles get the same scripture
[1:32:36] well

[1:33:07] 6
[1:33:09] 16 and 18.
[1:33:11] read it
[1:33:12] and see if it don't have the same thing
[1:33:18] about being the children of god
[1:33:20] and that we're going to go through this
[1:33:25] soul spirit and body
[1:33:28] we're going to go through it
[1:33:31] and we're going to be made pure
[1:33:36] you see it wasn't just speaking of
[1:33:37] israel
[1:33:40] speaking of
[1:33:41] us too
[1:33:44] beautiful with endings
[1:33:55] let me see if i can find that and read
[1:33:57] it
[1:33:59] king james
[1:34:16] right
[1:34:27] and what agreement
[1:34:30] hath the temple of god with idols
[1:34:35] for ye are the temple of the living god
[1:34:37] as god has said
[1:34:39] i will dwell in them and walk in them
[1:34:42] and i will be their god
[1:34:46] and they shall be my people
[1:34:49] same thing he said in the old testament
[1:34:52] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:34:54] be ye separate saith the lord and touch
[1:34:56] not the unclean thing and i'll receive
[1:34:58] and i will be a father unto you
[1:35:01] and you shall be my sons and daughters
[1:35:06] same scripture we started in the old
[1:35:08] testament

[1:36:05] think about him
[1:36:07] what he's done for us
[1:36:10] redeem
[1:36:13] means to bring back
[1:36:16] that i have to make something else to
[1:36:17] make us feel
[1:36:37] it is he that hath made us and not we
[1:36:39] ourselves
[1:36:41] we are his people
[1:36:43] the sheep of his pasture
[1:36:48] we are the people of god
[1:36:52] why wouldn't that create a revival
