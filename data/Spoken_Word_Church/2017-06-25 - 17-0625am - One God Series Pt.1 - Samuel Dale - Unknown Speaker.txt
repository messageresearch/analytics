«  55       †          Notice now His attribute. Then the attribute was, first, God; the thought, the attribute itself, all in One, without being expressed. Then when He expressed, secondarily, He became then the Word. "And then the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us."
56    Saint John the 1st chapter and the 1st verse, notice, this is, "In the beginning." But, before, the Eternal! Notice, "In the beginning was the Word." When the time begin, it was Word. But before it was Word, it was attribute, a thought. Then it was expressed, "In the beginning was," the expression, "the Word."
    Now we're getting where Melchisedec is. That's this mysterious Person. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." "And then the Word became flesh and dwelled among us." Hold that there now, notice.
57    His--His first being was Spirit, God, supernatural, all right, the great Eternal. Second, He begin to form Himself towards flesh, in a theophany, it's called "the Word; a body." This then is the state He was in when He met Abraham, was called Melchisedec. He was in the form of theophany. Now we'll get to that and prove it in a few minutes, the Lord willing. He was the Word.

«  26       †        Now, "No man has seen the Father at any time." No man can see God in the bodily form, because God is not in body form; God is a Spirit. See? All right. "No man has seen the Father, but the only begotten of the Father hath declared Him," I John... See?
    Now, but notice now, there's nothing; there's just space. There's no light; there's no dark; there's no nothing; it's just seems nothing. But in there is a great supernatural Being, Jehovah God, Who covered all space of all places at all times. He was from everlasting from everlasting; He is the beginning of creation. That's God. Can't see nothi...
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
working again and then we go read today's of zom 57 now thinking as we get now people saying we know the end is near because Russia's come down for all and we come close to getting the woman in the white house but God said this will all mean know you're my disciples when you have love one to another hand and so let us show that life and let it be expressed wherever we go that others will see you know the real followers of Jesus Christ and let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you this day God for being among us Lord touches our hearts father draws close to lo one to another that I love be shown in our life slow wherever we go Lord those came up to the gate called beautiful nor they had been with Jesus Christ well they lifted up prayer for them raise them up Lord we know that we are the same as they were though we have the same God that is dwelling within our hearts Alton just give us strength that we make let it be displayed but we ask you for those in the sunday school class this morning father touched you in a special way don't let their hearts be open to the revelation of your word lonely issues blessed pastor love bless him that he may bring forth unto us words that we have need to hear and understand and use Christ and we pray amen so I'm 57 be merciful unto me O God be merciful unto me for myself trust in the a and the shadows are thy wings will I make my refuge until that Clement is be passed he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that was swallowed me up Selah God shall send forth his mercy and his true [Music] these are salted Oh God

nations Hammond's and i true agenda files be thou exalted Oh God above in heaven let that glory be of all there and maybe God blessing you maybe see foolish in the word of the Lord okay second Corinthians 12 and John 1 the only father we thank you for a time in an hour that we can set aside a little bit of our human element time as you sit down and rest a little bit and that you talk to us because that's what we desire more than anything else we know that we talk a lot we pray a lot to you but sometimes Lord we need to just sit down and listen to you talk to us so just have your way Lord in got each one of us forgive our sins remember the sick among us and just bless each one you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and deliver us from destruction we thank you in Jesus name yeah I very maybe odd to scriptures to use but what we're going to do is start a series and it will be called a one God series because it will be many many messages in relation could I'm sure but we're going to start off in something that maybe you wouldn't cut it to together but hang on until we get to the end of it and just read the scripture okay now in 2nd Corinthians 12 it says it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord okay watching he said I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such an one caught up in caught up to or now the third heaven now butter Brennan said that he was believed he went to the first heaven and he explains the first heaven later in the message as being the first heaven is the mote is the Millennium excuse me first heaven is now and the millennium is the first earth because it will come forth in a cleansing process but he said Paul went to the third heaven and what did Paul say then about this and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter now he went through the third heaven so remember that as we going throughout the message now we go to John 1 says in the beginning was the word and Word was with God in the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and lights on earth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not now jump to verse 18 to pick up the salt we can go through all the other but you're going to see in a minute while we're going to be staying back before time look now it says no man has seen God at any time the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him in other words the original says he has brought him out into the open or in other words he has revealed him I brought him out into the open where we can understand alright so you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now I want to make a statement from this past Wednesday I went back and I said I said something and we were listening and I did I made a boo-boo I said I said in other words I said brother Branham didn't believe in baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ I was reading and quoting from that you can take Jehovah Jireh jour Rayford yoga Chris can you all of that but that's not his name and I meant to say Father Son and Holy Ghost is not his night but the way it came out just came out bluntly to say and will run around didn't believe in water baptism and name of the Lord Jesus that was incorrect because the Bible is correct but in case you heard that I am human to the point that I do make boo-boos and when I make boo-boos I want to correct boo-boos connection you know make sure it's right okay because we do believe in the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you know the Lord Jesus Christ does fulfil Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ father son we go that's why it's in the Bible like it in okay alright now let's get started they said I want to start a series you know many messages in relation to our true understanding of one true and living God and I believe it's very valuable for us to understand what to mean now that is the Bible to understand one true Living God is the full Bible all the rest of it is in relation to it if you ask me to say brother Dale could you sum up the Bible with one talk I'd say one God you know I mean if you say what would be your greatest talk to connect together everything in the Bible it would be simply to say to understand one true and living God because that is what we're supposed to be understanding and without understanding that that's where it's got all messed up down through time during the dark ages they took away the understanding from the true Church of that one God and they came out with a Trinitarian concept well there's no such thing in the Bible there's not the word Trinity is not in the word all right let's see then to understand is to understand one true and living God all right now I know immediately your mind goes I start talking and that's why we've run to 18 the verse 18 we'll pick it up in a minute but see you'll say well no man has seen God at any time well that's got its truth but it's not all true because the same Bible says you know no man seen God in the same Bible said God is revealing himself to you and I what's the purpose alright see then we say God is the spirit that's true we believe that but just remember as we go along you'll pick up some things I hope because you'll understand that God is the spirit yes but then we're going to talk about him being not just a spirit as floating around you know we say spirit it's just something it really to our thinking a lot of times when we say spirit we just mean something that's motivating us something motivating me to do good something's motivating me to do bad we make that just spirit no things are all right you know understanding but remember now the Prophet we'll get to it later in making a statement and you were to understand this statement easily if God is just a spirit and our mental mind things then why do you pray for the Holy Spirit why do you pray for God to come and live in you because if he's just the spirit he's everywhere if he's ever heard then why would you ask God to give you eternal life it would be in you but it would be in the animals it would be in the trees they'd be no need of praying for the Holy Ghost if the Holy Ghost is just everywhere and this the spirit see that's why mankind came up with a part that they'll say you know that God is just your good touch but the devil is your bad dollars.the and that doesn't make anything real I'm the point I'm making we're going to we know how I do it I put a title and then I put a subtitle to what I'm thinking about so we're talking about understanding one true and living God but I want to ask you a simple question how real is your God I don't care you want to call him Buddha Hindu this out of the other father son Holy Ghost whatever whatever you want to be you doesn't matter if you want to be Trinitarian you want to be how real is your God that's a simple question to ask how real is your God is it possible to see God is it possible to understand him is it possible that he could speak to you how real is your God now I want to thought in your mind as we go along to think like this if we're looking at something real like would make this was made into this pulpit you know or papered or whatever you want rags it was made into paper just remember if that's tangible or real then are you going to tell me that your God is not more real than that well you just the spirit I thought we believed this we believed in one true and living God that Jesus was that God even if you're a second person of the Trinity you're gonna believe he's real in a horde of minion how real is your God well because I've been accused of trying to make him so real until people who say you're kind of doing away with God how could you make him more real in other words just was made out of rags maybe the paper whatever created dad or brought it into being is more real than this would you agree so then if there is a world and there is a life and there is people and that we're living then it means that somewhere at some time God had to bring into reality or tangibility or whatever you want to call it this world and people and he's more real yeah he's more real than that already to get to point to you when we start off then if Paul was taken up into the third heaven and that's according to the scripture he said he was you know he says I know a man you know now we know that was Paul always went up but he said whether I was in body or out of body I don't know we said I did go darn see something but he said I can't even talk to you about what I seen like a third heaven then that would mean there has to be others we live in life light matter like a fourth dimensional part than his TV you know different things are all in the next dimension and then the fifth in the sixth or seventh or and we talk about heaven we read over a revelation of heaven in dice and it tells what's going on there but I ask you the question is your God real and is your heaven real or is it just above us you know that you can call heaven just another atmosphere you know can be called heaven how real is your God and what would be his dwelling place well you just you just you just getting it too far I'm getting it too far for you to realize with your natural brain what I'm saying because with your natural brain you are limited you're taught you're taught of limitation you're taught things that you know you're not taught that God is real you're just Tony's the spirit see that's why they couldn't accept Jesus Christ when he came was he Almighty God in human flesh but why couldn't they believe it it was just a little bit too much real and what did they say did you're a man making yourself God is that scripture reading Matthew Mark Luke and John it emphatically States and declared how real God is the Bible said our eyes have seen him Peter said I mean Jesus said if you've seen me he said you've seen the father well that just means you know the actions and reactions of what's taking place that wouldn't want to say it that's your philosophy he said I my father are one who was it Philip one to love in one day said shorts her father is suffice mister he said have I been so long with you see they killed him because he being a man declared himself to be God the same people that was looking for a human being to come a messiah to fulfil Isaiah virgin shall conceive on they were looking for that one to kill him when he had every manifestation to show that he was God because you didn't come their way and would you uh he said well they just don't understand the spirit let's get a little strong thought about a spirit I wonder sometimes how we would feel if we had of actually stood in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ what I know him because I feel a good spirit come on when I know he's God could I feel the good spirit where he stood in the president's and some of you did a brother on him he I feel a good spirit what about those who stood around him and didn't feel a good spirit because he said then spirits is hanging around all the time could it be that when you was in his presence that you might feel them bad parks so then we're just taking our philosophies of our mind and trying to make some theory of a God how would you go along with these statements that will try to prove that God is real not a myth a being a person what about now see I get accused of being soul you so confuse us by what you're saying you listen to what I'm saying is your God real enough who you can think about him being a being instead of just the mythologies or ideas or some drawers loose ideas that you know they say that the Lightning is going to splitting rolling bowling balls up through the heavens you know in a blue moon is that the mythologies that we believe in what about knowing your God's name one of God's God God is an object of worship what is your God what about knowing his name what about being able to see him the God I talked about how real and I believe he is he was before all things and by him the Bible said all things consist he created all things who is real and we know his name is Jesus jesus said I come to my father's nothing ever son followers in the lineage of it father I mean ever son father's in the lineage of the father has to be the name of the Father and what about to declare that you've seen him that's where we're going okay now if we take a long time get tired don't worry about it let just coast along till we see what's going on try to follow the line all right now you cannot understand God by the carnal mind it's impossible to understand the supernatural with a natural mind that's why I read the scripture emphasized verse 18 says the son hath declared him he which literally means brought him out into the open revealed him made him known to mankind he said right there on earth making God known to mankind and they killed him though how real is your God is in one of these days you realize what I'm talking about you know what I say the Prophet I'll quote him because see I'm talking to people that claim to be following a message and that's why I'd use it a lot you know your prophet said it new meaning you claim to believe this man and he says the new bird is the person of Jesus Christ coming and living in you now do you believe that and just be careful because he I do say that he's born for that look see if you believe he's a person then you had to leave he's real you just you just lost all grounds you're going back to some spirit and some beings and some different so then lose all that and let's go if you believe he's a person a person's real and remember if he created you he feels more real you are see I know that when I speak I require for you to think well I thought that's what God gave you a brain fart I require for you to think over things one because I thought that was what we're supposed to be I thought according to the prophets message and the Bible that God has spent 6,000 years trying to reveal himself to mankind to his creation but because maybe you've never experienced things that others have it's very easy to kind of pull everything into your capability of thinking you probably said God allow some people to see things he said maybe not everybody but he said he gives it to them where they can tell others about it when how real is your God in other words how do you approach somebody to try to talk to them about God well you know yourself that most everybody says God sent a prophet if you don't believe that you're lost start with your denominations is dead and all these are right but what about just trying to talk to them about how real your God is well I don't believe it I the way I believe he's just a spirit it's floating around well how real is your God okay what about a statement that a prophet could make you makes a lot of statements that are sometimes really baffling to the human mind I'll give this an over and over and over a lot of times go ahead with number one and we'll just start if I go real slow trying to go through the quotes that you've already heard 29 times we're going to read 30 or maybe 31 okay because I thought that was what we were here to do I mean I didn't know we came to see each other now have a good time I thought we were together together to learn of God and you went to school and you said in the first grade and you said 1 plus 1 is 2 you got in the second grade you just said 2 plus 2 is 4 but you know what you still had to know 1 plus woman so Elementary let's say Elementary okay look what right around says on who is this Melchizedek he's go down to what we're online you read all the rest of it reason give it the Word was made flesh to dwell amongst we know who is talking about Saint John the first chapter and the first verse notice this is in the beginning but before the eternal how can anything be before the eternal if it's eternal that had to be before that's where you don't get eternity go just as far that way to go that way right I give that to make a talk to where you'll follow it in the beginning but before that you could ever comprehend anything whatsoever about an eternal God he already existed but there's nothing before the eternal there's a lot of eternity how far you want to go just like I said well ago see you don't realize it all said he went to the third heaven and many heavens are they well that's just we don't understand that and I know it cause you're trying to figure it out instead of just listening Souter just simply listening so when John is talking about in the beginning so when it says in the beginning that means a starting place right a starting place is in the beginning let's say there was no starting place with God so he was before the beginning any comprehension you can have of a start of anything that means the eternal was back before dark you don't think about God you don't ever just let your mind wander and they won't you know I mean here is your thoughts of God just some Spiritist something and then he comes down a little further then he becomes word then then he comes a little further and he becomes flash and then he takes own place and now he's got something it took four thousand years to bring him into flash a whole lot of word oh what a revealing a lot of God so how real is your God you so he said notice in the beginning was the word when time began it was word what before it was word it was attribute or thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word he said now again to where Melchizedek is because remember Mel Chadwick was Almighty God right see his first being was spirit watching God supernatural all right the great eternal second he began to form himself towards flesh in the theophany is called the word of Oddi this then is a state he was in when he met Abraham was called Melchizedek he was in the form of the often II know your prophet is covering the descending of God right are the comfort of God coming down into the basis of being able to be understood right so where was he before the world well we don't know well now we know for certainty that this dimension that we live in is life light and matter we know up above us is an atmosphere and that's called the heavens right we'll see then if you can go into the to the heavens then you got two more rims or whatever you call it dimensions to be able to be dealing with that are greater than all of these see we get in our mind and when we get down to a little later on in the message we'll talk about God dwelling along with his thoughts and and our mind immediately Falls to what who's the guy the thinker sitting down you know who Atlas is either through it you know he holds a world of he's nothing anyhow you know the story on talking about you got a picture of a guy sitting down thinking huh they saying it like everybody all right now that's what we think because that's the human wording but was he just not nothing intangibility what is the word I can use I don't know education what you know something tangible something real would be real before the world or was he just virgin what do you think about God did he exist before the world and the being as a person I was just floating spirit and we got a lot of scripture cover now we're going to get down into something but really about 20 sermons later where when the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy that was up in heaven before anything come to earth according to the word according to your prophet so we've got a long ways to go with ain't just a short terminology as we're thinking things over so how real is your God remember our statement at least some of you should head here and agree to smile or look or whatever that God's got to be more real than anything we know of tangible right you got to be more real than this because he made this you got to be more real than this body cut he made it so what do you think about your God was he just a spirit there was nothing no I know Moloch you know no let me ask you a simple question where you think about was he in the third heaven Oh all winter do these two more heavens above where we are and Paul wet dire and so things it was not lawful just because chaltén know you want to go back get that scripture he saw things he saw something he said whether in body or out I don't know but he said I've been there how that was just a vision that was just a dream that was it that's what we're going to get to if a vision is fulfilled it's more real than the vision you can have a vision of seeing something that's a vision right you can have a vision of seeing something happen tomorrow except there's a storm coming to mark two o'clock now you can say I saw a vision well now which ones are more real you've seen it by vision are tomorrow when the storm comes see could it be that Paul went to the third heaven surely we want to think about that being an eternal place right and you remember when he started bringing us into into manifestation disarray all went through the third heaven so things were not even lawful to speak off what about having something that you carried for 30 40 years and you tried because now listen you want me quote somewhere you thank Paul out of 30 40 years holds not trying to explain what you saw if you don't I want to sell you some stock the Booker and Leeds let you fall off in the he said no no well let me explain it this way was not brother branham cold don't try to explain the first second and third pool especially when he said first and second and he spent his whole life trying to explain it you mean Paul so all of this was never said a word about it where did he get all of that great understanding Dirac the book of Hebrews about this great eternal God melt shattered it and saying even melted it was a man where did Paul get all of that from it being got it from what he saw in the third heaven God remember Moses was taken up right and he saw the things and come back to earth and built them according to what he saw right but we know that Moses in what he saw was really that he didn't see a building a temple he saw God and tried to build him as Enoch did into the stone those prophets saw God when they brought it to earth what could they say naman look at the right one with it where he saw chariots Jocelyn's in the streets running like lightning he saw Buicks and Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs running down the road the headlights on he said that's why your prophet said it and said running into each other but What did he say he called a Jarvis he did not know the word Ezekiel so fire falling out of heaven but he had no word of nuclear destruction or atom bomb are you listening Moses saw Jesus in the heaven but when he come back to earth he build a tabernacle and all of that Tabernacle you think we didn't go down with Lugar's time in Jews don't understand that Tabernacle and all that doing come over sisters and all we're going to have a wonderful time brothers sat down talked to them Jews tell them all about that temple because they don't know what it all means but around said them Jews could not understand them two loaves of bread we're going to have a millennium to talk to them about Jesus and that's just going to start it because then we're going to go into total eternity in the future home am i right is that something beyond our minds is that too deep to follow it's because you don't want to maybe your God's not real to you within I'd assume I would ask you to get a good experience of God somebody's experience yourself Amish clicking home for them and you tell me how all of that works you mean you tell me how that that cell phone just clicked and got a message for somebody in Western Siberia and they ain't no telephone line hooked up over that then you want to tell me they ain't no eternal God in the supernatural part you can't look at the things of life and see it realize how eternal God is and how really is something wrong with you but listen what about an eternal God this becomes a property it would say in the Bible would say that God is a spirit that's exactly right God is our spirit just as Ezekiel so far falling out of him but he didn't describe this like I've tried to tell you come on get it a little common sense about Bible terminologies and brother Brown and said we'll give it our guest me later buddy when it's gear whenever when he quoted John warning said in the beginning with our hymn that with him would with a layman Ella hem was that with him and hell a.m. we think he kind interpret something doesn't ring you know with no no he doesn't say that he said in the beginning with the word we're really smart it's so stupid until we can't understand the Eternity of God well where did God come from you know it's good old Baptist had an answer for that any of you in here no word the Bible says God come from they just said it Bible said God comes from teman a survival somebody get the scripture Horn God come from teman oh where's Damon if they ever get it up you'll find the word demon means right hand where did God come from the right hand not from a place demon that he existed he lived but he is the God of eternity and Jesus is his name looking at him as we're trying to understand him man and went crazy trying to figure the Word of God out you can't figure it out it's going to be revealed now back at the injury since God come from teman it means the right hand I thought we believed by my right hand he said I saved them how did he bring their children of it I he said by my right hand right hand means power and authority get it in simple terminologies rush to understand but we just hold out that God is the spirit and we don't understand but those are words to try to explain him but brother Dale you told luck sometimes that you think that Jesus existed back over there somewhere and he was real now what are you going to say I'm going to put it in your life let you think about if you say he was backyard or spirit then it's real okay that's all that I trapped you with your own thoughts so you say just the spirit that my spirit would be real right you let somebody get up and come running down through here and they're mad as a hornet and they're going but somebody with the fish what do you own call dad that's a spirit it's real isn't it notice somebody don't stop you gonna bop somebody say you're just carnal why not be carnal then but the carnal enough to understand if there is a reality of a living of a world if there's a reality of life if there's a reality of people if there's all of these things we see then you mean to tell me all these things are more real than the God that brought it into being why can't you believe as we would talk with Apollo why can't you believe that when Paul went to the third heaven according to my Bible you can read a lot about heaven over in the book of Revelation but what dimension is that you mean to tell me you don't think there's something higher than that remember a lot of the Book of Revelations and visions and done of what's taking place or what he is or what if it's what I don't understand you sound like you're trying to believe this God is real why not would be your reason they're not leaving is real is it you're afraid of it you're afraid of him becoming more real to you what you see Church we have the truth why can't we believe the truth we talk about a god that's infinite and the god that's all-knowing but just remember I'll read it to you if he's a being you can't make him on the present except for the fact that he's omniscient because if he's our being he's not everywhere I wasn't the one that made the statement terribly well ago the prophets when it said it he said if he's omniscient he's ever were and all of that he said why do you seek the Holy Ghost he said it would be in you church listeners we talk about God sent a prophet we all came through those days and times or spokes to hell but it was trying to get people to believe God said profit non-sena profit Godzilla profit glory well what about the message he brought I thought about him being a prophet and his purpose we coming was to bring God out in the open to you and I I thought as we were reading the other day that even Jesus the flesh was not trying to reveal himself we're trying to reveal the God that was inside of me what do we look at God as being real but we just look at him as some spirit sometimes we just don't know what formative we don't know what is it and we don't know what that in we've already established by the Bible that there's at least a third heaven and the heaven is a dwelling place and brother Branham says God is real and he's got a dwelling place he said is heaven get you comprehend them she just sees you she's gonna get you comprehend a little bit that before the world of anything that God was real and you lived in a place it was real evidently the Pala third heaven must have been real he sees all things he couldn't explains what he saw things that couldn't explain it was laying Dyer yeah but I don't understand you that what are you trying to do trying to get you to think about God being real I didn't intend to go this way within Asia John I'll get to it later don't worry about it we're gonna get down to work that your prophet saw Jesus but your prophet said Paul saw Jesus Abraham meant God many times with the life thing was he met Abraham and play I mean met God in flesh Abraham made him no charity which was God in human flesh and he dropped one on you I mentioned a little bit while ago to somebody hope they don't explain it to nobody too much what about brother branham seeing God in many ways but then finally seeing him because he started off saying he said I've seen him in visions because he said one day I'm going to see him in reality he saw me what about it what about this great one going to pull under one eye up we'll get started a little bit then we'll quit I would ask you to just if nothing else go home I'll go back and listen to the same message as I breathe to make sure that I saying my wordings right and I didn't know I had said that REM didn't believe in water baptism name of the Lord Jesus Christ I was so caught up in my thoughts until it was never even in my thought I didn't say it as far as me and understanding well I said you said Shawn Jonah well I guess the better listen to the tape I listened to the tape probably a lot of you didn't hear me saying it because you mind as you're supposed to be taking what I mean not what I say right it is okay let's go let's get a little start okay questions and answers on Genesis I ask you to listen to that message it's in 53 729 I ask you to listen to the message read the message Oh questions and answers on Genesis and you'll see all of the things of a prophet trying to explain in 53 1965 but in 53 explaining an eternal God like I said to you over and over it don't mean nothing to you none of the writers whatsoever Matthew Mark Luke and John were recording what Jesus said they talk of a mode of the Elijah to come they speak of the things you know that coming in in the Son of Man but they didn't understand it Paul in the greatest of all he didn't express it and brother Adam starts off in the like the third-best I remember I looked it up I know he started we got 47 if 49 I think he started talking about short man that don't mean anything to you that means he was a prophet to me look let's take that scripture no man has seen the father at any time no man can see God in bodily form because God is not in bodily form is that any problem always just the spirit and hate inside by the way you're putting that in there what's the bodily form what's the fact of not being able to see the father what if it is that we haven't fully understood all of God what if there is a lot of things according to the Prophet we're to get a message of cheer down to the endless ages after this life is over are we going up to heaven and set and twiddle our thumbs now we're going to be hearing about God there's going to be some time we just get enough ear to be able to understand anything that is said dire no man has seen the father at any time now what about Moses song God is according to the Bible when he said Moses he said no you can't see my face are we going to heaven and have a place over here for the father and a place over here for the Sun and place over here is the Holy Ghost and we still well I know which ones we actually I didn't end all about the name all right I brought as much as I could when you get to heaven are you going to see a pillar of fire and a halo into this and then you don't see all different person are you going to see Jesus no we're just going to see a throne set nice but ain't nothing on it because no man can see the father well according to Jesus he said if you've seen me he said you seen the father all right now we got one to come to the throne and is that the book of Revelation that is according to verse chapter four in Revelation you sought find a throne and all about it ain't nobody on me go to chapter five you find a throne and one on the throne where'd he come from but run said he was back behind making intercession he says now as intercession and waning it he said he climbed up on the throne and sits down what does that meaning that's meaning in your mind in your mind you see it Hume do these things because we're not up there to see it that's look nobody seen God in bodily form human bodily form Melchizedek was your first but I can remember of a bodily form appearing to Abraham or any of them now that was a body created for the purpose of stepping into the Melchizedek could not die for your sin so it was a body he stepped in God stepped into and he stepped right back out of it but in Jesus he stepped into a body and a birth male Cheddar's it was a created full-grown man Jesus came as a birth a baby God in human flesh Jehovah were no teeth that's worth hurting and he growed up look God is not in bodily form God is a spirit now I know that's your own profit in the sign paragraph explain himself okay we got to explain over here in the mind you see guard it off and ain't nobody finally for they never gonna be no motley form of God God God is your spirit okay let's keep greed no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father hath declared him 1 John the first John that's really John 1 whether it is in first John 2 yeah now but notice now there's nothing there's your space there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing it just seems nothing but in there is a great supernatural being Jehovah God now he's just routing from spirit to a great supernatural being yeah we take this up here that's the same thing we used to do acts 2:38 Matthew 28:19 we take what we wanted to that's the way the people is amazing I cooked I told you what the Prophet saying ever what about all he said what about but in there is a great supernatural being over God who covered all space in all places at all times he was the ever licensing from everlasting that's good is the beginning of the creation now how many of you remember what wrote around said he said in the beginning of the creation he said God was his first creation that's a quote I'll give it to you we got create yourself no he just stepped into another phone okay come on that's God can't you see nothing here nothing not a move or an item in the air nothing I knew I heard nothing yet God was there that was God now let's watch for a few minutes after a while no man has seen that now that's the father that's God the Father he's right back to where he's talking that you can't see God and no problem he has to bring something to earth or to our earthly understanding and when he does that one sitting on the throne you will never see that father because that father will be in human flesh called Jesus is that any problem is any trouble that you won't see you but he'll be there why because my Bible says prayer phrasing it will be glad to get it money that's one day the son ship's going to terminate that God may be all in all now come on that God may be all that's all of him but what about in all that's you and I as his children we could bring a lot more into this not just waves going with the redemptive part I'm trying to start from the beginning but think about it look what he says of the unveiling of God we'll get one or two and quit paragraph 82 the unveiling of God who is this great unseen person who is this that Abraham seen in visions right it's a lifestyle he was manifested in flesh now you talking about Jesus he talked about Melchizedek right before the Sun came not himself came to Abraham in the form of a man watching at the end time manifested he saw him in a little light one time he saw him in visions he heard his voice many revelations but just before the promised son came he saw him in the form of a man and talked to him and said he meeting great notice God Himself veiled in human flesh this is a part of his way this is the way that he manifests himself to us manifests the eternal world God Jehovah made flesh like in John 1 in the beginning was the word in the Word was with God and the in the beginning with Ella him and that all him was become the word and the word was hell ahem and the word was made out of him and the problem didn't it's the same thing just unfolding like the attribute see it is in God and attribute is your thought but in the beginning the eternal he wasn't even God he was the eternal he wasn't even God God is an object of worship or something see so he wasn't even that he was of him the eternal but in him was thoughts he wanted to become material and what did he do then he spoke a word and the word was materialized that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation it's nothing is nothing wrong in stela him materializing so he can be touched feel and in the millennium there adela him sitting on the throne that's right with all his subject around him that he predestinated before the foundation or what about it how real is your God we've been through this let's cover it or we won't have to worry about it we see mankind tried to once the Bible was written he's tried all the time to express that word that's why you have so many different translations and so many different interpretations and things to try to make it simple but to all have to go back to the beginning and start from the beginning so the best mankind can do was to call him el ahem because that word derived from understanding of the fact that he is self existing that God dwelt alone okay go ahead with this from number to the adoption 1960 like a little bit the other night or struck it in Genesis when God called his name Lord God it's in the word él ella ella hem which means a self existing one there was nothing else existing but him there was no iron lied there was no stars or in the world I don't know nothing else it was God and God alone self existing self existing the best word that could come up with would be to call himself existing what other word could mankind arrive to expression so they said self existing is LEM and if he self-existing existed alone and simple and that shouldn't need a big old hammer hua if you understand that if you get seven existing just long okay any problem with that in order to be sensible he dwelled alone will remember he dwells alone in our talks goes back see to just some spirit and all why can't you realize we will get back to this as we get on the further end but I really thoroughly enjoyed one time the passion play in Atlanta and they only use it one time a lot of you have been there been with us when we went and the one time you know in the Passion Play they would start at one year here the next time they didn't start at the same place they started another period of time one would start at the baby one would start there and this one they started before the world begun and when its scene opened and the stage opened the first time was a man there were no stars no world on this a man the scene change from him saying let there be let there be in the world started coming into being this one that was standing there was saying it I rejoiced because it witness report missus spirit I tried with this next scene you heard a baby crying the next scene he was about 30 and he walks out and when he walks out they called it but they said they couldn't use it no more they were not allowed to use that because it was copyrighted they were never used to use that again because when this man stepped out at 30 he was the same man playing the part of the God that created the world why not you mean Jesus don't look like God we spent our time talking about him being God but you mean Jesus don't look like God well I just said to everyone and we're what God looks like he's like Jesus shows it because he declared that he brings it out I said to rejoiced because I knew that's what happened the very man according to my Bible according to my Bible in John 1 Hebrews 1 Colossians 1 James 3 and 9 the lie many more scripture says Jesus Christ created all things and there was not anything made unless he made it read all those scriptures especially in James I think it's 3:00 at 9:00 well why wouldn't you believe I rejoice because here was the creator when he came in human flesh that's what he looked the man played in the park what do you think Jesus looks like he looks like God because He is God what do you think well I guess God is just a glog vocal whining Jesus applause you don't think do you if God is just in lavaridge Spirit and Jesus couldn't have been nothing else but that then he could turn to Philip and say you look which one word he says you've seen me you've seen my father Cobra one stanka local musician I meant to get a long ways and I thought over I've been on this and then we had everything ready to get don't worry about it we could only we instead start I just asked you a simple question how real is your God and if Jesus was right it you've seen me you've seen the father then who does a father look like I thought your son was supposed to look like a father right I mean that's always what it is we then it hunting Lynn yesterday and talking to the guy and he's met Wade and they were painting it dirty was Hector here he said something I said something talking to him he said he said tell your daddy we're rich without life and he said tell your daddy I said hey that's it mr. Edward I am the dead he said be sure like y'all yeah I thought Jesus was supposed to look like his father what would you ever expect the father to be or how to look what went down here's where we go see we've never none of us didn't see Jesus and Hoffman laid a picture in 1889 I think I try when he painted the rich young ruler Stan well I don't nobody know what Jesus looked like well you know he looked like somebody right why would your prophet say he said I've never been without since I've seen it a picture of Hoffman in my home now you're just 30 years 33 so don't get confused he'll say 30 he'll say 33 don't get confused I got them all written down he said I've never been without a picture of Hoffman he's because that's the closest well then what does Jesus look like the closest you can get to Hoffman then what does God look like the closest you could get to Jesus right around him talk so much of it I'll give you the quote he said before men I leave to go on a trip we leave to go out something he said me and my wife and kids he said we go and stand before the picture of Hoffman and pray it he told us not to do those time you don't have to have a picture to remind you of this out of the other but that's his honesty of what he believed I know the story Hoffman there's a 34:33 there's no proof of this that or the other about it because you can argue about all you want to but just remember somebody painted a thirty and somebody planted a 33 then you argue over Hoffman didn't do this and Hoffman didn't do that what's your argument you got two pictures that's why they're back here behind you look at the young man and then you look at the older man and I'm in between them and that's what caused him to look like that I don't care who painted that one and who painted that one that's right it's just a fact of knowing my god is real go ahead brother holier that's 1962 anybody have an aid the altars open I guess we do that trying to get you to see if your God is real give you key here what a wonderful change in my life happened Jesus came into what about it I am Jesus bring us so or to get what somebody said this Jesus came into ha ha into the story the power he gave me real does came into haha but the soil my soul like this see Bill since Jesus came that has a the other bar I have pasted on the wonder if go straining Zetas came into and my wit were major God was not into this Jesus came into haha drunk my jewelry like this s exactly loaded 50-year things he's done in this fashion in - ah - try to bring it reality to please put this how real oh god he does Amy he cannot about and no cars have the down my favorite real did Jesus came into my heart Jesus is and Jesus gave me to heart then Jesus came into my heart but the joy or my soul like to see below since Jesus came into my heart there's a light in the valley of death now for me this animal heart we shoulda Perconte yeah you go hurt away from this lovingly easily buddy my Jesus gave me then Jesus came into my soul Jesus gave me a glass finally thank you for an opportunity today to speak about you and to try to explain Lord we believe you're real you're just not our folks you're just not I'm mythologies you're real and you live in each one of our hearts and live by the new birth probably we had to seek you to get that it wasn't just the fact that you be in the spirit that would just come down and fill everything because you're a person and you're real your name is Jesus but just go with us now as we dismiss for a few minutes come back to scene and bless leg Lord and give him understanding of you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you're dismissed Jesus amen to my song the Jesus game our [Music]
