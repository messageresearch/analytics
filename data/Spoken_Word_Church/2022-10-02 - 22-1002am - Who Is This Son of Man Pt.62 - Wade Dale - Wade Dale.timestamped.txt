[14:00] we've seen that song you know the world
[14:02] sings that song they ain't got a clue
[14:04] what they're singing about
[14:05] they really don't it's words and it's
[14:07] good they know Elijah was over back
[14:09] there in the Old Testament and they know
[14:10] all this we know what that song's about
[14:14] behold he comes
[14:19] riding on a cloud
[14:23] that's right and now you and I
[14:26] are a greater cloud of witness
[14:29] that he is here
[14:30] he's not coming
[14:32] he's right here with us today hey man
[14:34] good to be back we had a good trip and
[14:36] and uh in Ohio and y'all got some good
[14:39] preaching last Sunday man alive
[14:43] wow that was good
[14:45] post services in the Sunday school and
[14:47] everything was done
[14:49] um brother Aaron picking up with the
[14:50] song service and we sure appreciate it
[14:53] we appreciate everything that everybody
[14:55] does there's no way you can
[14:58] um as I've always said I would uh when
[15:01] we always get together at Christmas
[15:04] you know the greatest Christmas gift we
[15:06] could give brother Dale is that we live
[15:07] what he preaches
[15:09] right
[15:14] if you can drive them and they'll
[15:16] help but one Soul saved
[15:18] we were talking about that last night
[15:20] the Bible study one one man preaching
[15:23] the gospel here look where all brother
[15:24] dick and all the different ones came
[15:26] from Doraville way down there in Atlanta
[15:28] lived all in these different places and
[15:30] then here they start migrating both Tom
[15:32] then brother Tom goes one day and starts
[15:35] working out
[15:36] in a jam and there was Gary Atkin
[15:40] and he presented a message to Brother
[15:41] Gary Atkins and Dean Bradley Gary Atkins
[15:44] come to the message so you see how God
[15:45] is doing he's multiplying himself this
[15:48] is where it was supposed to be had it
[15:49] not been a fall this one that's what I
[15:52] believe we would all come all right the
[15:54] bride would come in its own time in
[15:57] their own time but you know what we've
[15:58] come in our own time now
[16:00] man so there's really nothing different
[16:01] we haven't upset the plan of God the
[16:04] plan of God is exactly the way it's
[16:05] supposed to be amen so thank you for all
[16:07] your prayers and and the uh I was
[16:10] telling brother Bob
[16:11] I'll give you just a minute for
[16:13] Testimony before we get now I got a
[16:15] pretty long list of to uh
[16:18] uh for announcements but there's a
[16:22] sister up there in Ohio and she may be
[16:24] watching in today which is fine her
[16:26] name's Anna and she's in the service and
[16:30] um
[16:30] I noticed Sunday you know I told Bob I
[16:33] said sometimes you know we we think that
[16:36] a powerful preaching of you need to
[16:38] repent you need to come to the Altar and
[16:40] you know a a message of repentance I
[16:44] preached on Daniel 70 weeks
[16:46] but it was on the six-fold purpose which
[16:48] is why Redemption
[16:50] and this girl's just I mean she's just
[16:52] boo-going
[16:56] she took communion for the first time
[16:58] she told Jim she said would you she said
[17:00] I don't know what I'm doing I said when
[17:02] Jim said I'll help you
[17:05] I'll help you through this
[17:08] Isaac
[17:10] he called me yesterday
[17:12] he said she's went and tried to find
[17:14] she's starting to find some dresses for
[17:15] her to wear
[17:17] she's under conviction of the things
[17:19] that she did
[17:20] that's the way a sinner comes
[17:22] that's the way somebody comes to God
[17:26] I couldn't remember her name I just
[17:28] called her sister Alabama that's all I
[17:30] remember but her name's Anna now but
[17:31] just pray for her amen just pray for her
[17:33] she's she's uh the only the family that
[17:36] she's got a good family and she's a
[17:37] boyfriend of of Isaac's son brother
[17:40] Gabriel she's a girlfriend of his
[17:43] and um
[17:44] that she's just a sweetheart she's just
[17:46] really a nice person I mean and we're
[17:49] going to pray that God will help her
[17:50] through all this amen and being in the
[17:53] military you know you may have to do
[17:54] certain things like you may have to wear
[17:56] you know slacks or something during your
[17:58] army time but we're going to pray that
[18:00] God will make talk and he'll just put
[18:01] all that together listen if there's a
[18:03] desire in your heart God will give you a
[18:06] person in the pulpit he will give you a
[18:09] desire to come to church he'll give you
[18:11] a desire to be saved because we can't
[18:13] save anybody

[26:27] John and I walk by and I see that X and
[26:29] I'm like what or that star it reminds me
[26:31] to go to the doctor or it reminds me to
[26:33] have Bible study
[26:34] so just remember that and keep that in
[26:36] your prayer also
[26:39] um
[26:40] yes I got every bit of that also I want
[26:43] to
[26:45] I want to I some of you know that
[26:49] that uh when that I had created a list
[26:52] of people
[26:53] that uh and I called their names over
[26:55] the pulpit
[26:57] and it
[26:59] by no means was I want to hurt anybody's
[27:02] feelings
[27:03] or call anybody out
[27:05] by no means because God knows my heart
[27:08] but it did upset some people
[27:11] and it did cause a little stir I don't
[27:13] want that
[27:14] God knows I don't want that
[27:16] I want people saved
[27:19] and I believe the Lord had me write that
[27:21] list but I in my misinterpretation
[27:24] should have kept hitting my Bible and
[27:26] prayed for him by myself
[27:29] that's where I missed it and I apologize
[27:31] that I missed that part of the
[27:32] discernment that I was I was zealous and
[27:35] I'm sorry I'd rather be zealous than
[27:38] asleep
[27:39] but in being zealous I do not want to
[27:42] hurt people's feelings and I apologize
[27:43] and if you see anybody that you know
[27:46] that that was here that day or that I
[27:48] call their name I apologize from the
[27:50] bottom of my heart no way in the world
[27:52] would I want anybody to not come to
[27:54] church
[27:55] all right everybody with me on that all
[27:58] right and I I I looked up today and
[28:01] brother Branham did the same thing one
[28:03] time
[28:04] he did the same identical thing he said
[28:06] but he said I don't want to do that
[28:08] anymore he said it hurt too many
[28:09] people's feelings
[28:13] well some people I know I know that but
[28:16] listen I apologize for what I did
[28:18] I want you to forgive me
[28:22] forgive me for what I did
[28:24] all right that was not appropriate at
[28:27] the time in the moment it's not
[28:28] inappropriate to pray for people
[28:30] but it would be inappropriate I guess to
[28:33] call somebody out I I was looking at a
[28:35] quote back here for brother Brown called
[28:37] the girl out one time and she missed her
[28:39] she missed her whole eternal life
[28:41] by being angry at brother Brown
[28:44] so don't be angry at me love me and
[28:48] forgive me of what I did because I do
[28:50] feel now that looking back on it that
[28:52] that uh that it was inappropriate to do
[28:54] at the time and I do apologize for that
[28:56] say Man everybody all right with that
[28:57] let's move forward let's keep going
[28:59] we're going to we got battles we're on a
[29:01] battleship not a cruise ship right we
[29:04] got battles to fight we got to learn how
[29:06] to fight
[29:07] all right that's what we're doing here
[29:09] with a statue of perfect man so let's
[29:10] turn our Bibles to um
[29:13] to John 1 1 this would be part 62. I
[29:17] want to bring out a few things extra
[29:19] that we did on Wednesday night
[29:21] and then this afternoon
[29:23] I stumbled on something that we really
[29:26] really need to look at
[29:28] uh according to the Statue of perfect
[29:29] man listen
[29:31] as we were talking about last night
[29:32] brother Dale brought to brought the porn
[29:34] out last night I mean you enjoyed
[29:36] brother Dale
[29:38] last night
[29:40] bringing it out all right
[29:42] so thank God for that I appreciate that
[29:45] and and and you know we cherish that
[29:48] and he was saying about justification
[29:50] sanctification he said there's some that
[29:51] will come to justification it won't come
[29:53] to sanctification the summit come to the
[29:54] baptism Holy Ghost some won't come to
[29:56] the baptism and Holy Ghost so I'm gonna
[29:57] come to the Statue of perfect man some
[29:58] won't but it's not for us to pick who
[30:00] they are it's for us to preach the
[30:03] gospel throw the net out there and
[30:05] whatever you get you're going to drag
[30:06] some fish in
[30:08] and because we need to go
[30:11] to the Lost we need the lost in because
[30:13] I'm telling you the door is fixing to be
[30:15] shut
[30:17] at least I know one thing's for sure
[30:19] thus that the Lord we're one day closer
[30:20] to the Rapture than we were yesterday
[30:22] right
[30:23] we're we're one month closer September
[30:26] 2022 is gone we're one month closer to
[30:29] the coming of the Lord now I want to be
[30:31] ready don't you I don't want to leave
[30:32] nobody behind I want to be ready all
[30:34] right so let's buy our heads Lord thank
[30:36] you for all the time that you give us
[30:38] with our brothers and sisters and I pray
[30:40] now that you'd sanctify us Lord for this
[30:42] journey forgive us of our sins and our
[30:43] many mistakes that we make Lord you know
[30:45] in our heart that we want everybody to
[30:47] make it we don't want anybody to miss
[30:49] out we want we want this church full of
[30:52] people that with the Holy Ghost that
[30:54] that you can work through them and speak
[30:55] through them even in speaking in tongues
[30:57] and even even worshiping and even being
[31:00] song leaders and being deacons and being
[31:02] elders and being ministers we want Lord
[31:04] each one to be a part of the body of
[31:07] Christ and father we pray Lord that you
[31:10] just give us this day our daily bread
[31:12] forgive us of our sins bless the ones
[31:14] that are sick bless this here that
[31:16] sister Andy Brown called in about the
[31:18] brother Freddy that you would he and I
[31:20] see you we don't know what's wrong with
[31:21] him doesn't matter doesn't matter about
[31:23] distance we know one thing's for sure
[31:24] you can go there in a split second and
[31:26] touch our brother Lord just touch us and
[31:28] lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit
[31:30] in Jesus name we pray
[31:32] Amen in the beginning was the word words
[31:34] with God and Word was God
[31:36] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[31:37] among us and we beheld his glory the
[31:39] glory of the only begotten of the father
[31:40] fall
[31:42] of Grace and Truth first Thessalonians
[31:45] says that every one of you should know
[31:46] that's what we're doing we're learning
[31:48] we're learning to know
[31:51] how to possess his vessel in
[31:52] sanctification and honor Romans 12 verse
[31:55] 2 says and be not conformed to this
[31:57] world but be transformed by the renewing
[31:59] of your mind
[32:00] that you may prove what is that good and
[32:03] acceptable and perfect will of God and
[32:05] what is the will of God his word you may
[32:07] be seated in the Lord has blessing to
[32:08] the reading of the word and we look and
[32:10] we see that
[32:12] we were talking about last night
[32:15] only in the son of man Ministry Judas
[32:18] was sitting right there beside Jesus
[32:19] they said Jesus who is the one's going
[32:22] to betray me or betray you he said the
[32:25] one that stops in the bowl well there
[32:27] was Judas with his bread siping in the
[32:29] bowl and they're still going is it me
[32:32] is it me is it me you see how deceived
[32:35] they were
[32:36] amen see how deceived they were but now
[32:39] who was not deceived
[32:41] the son of man was not deceived he knew
[32:45] who that was by spiritual discernment he
[32:47] knew that Judas was going to do what he
[32:49] was going to do all right so now I
[32:52] understand and know that if we talk
[32:54] about anointed ones at the end time and
[32:56] this thing's going to be so close
[32:57] until it's a Razor's Edge in between it
[33:00] only
[33:01] that there's going to be as we're
[33:03] talking about a few minutes there's
[33:04] going to be a showdown
[33:06] there's going to be a showdown there is
[33:07] going to be a time it separates because
[33:09] Judas
[33:11] looked at Jesus and what Jesus what did
[33:13] Jesus say he said go do what you need to
[33:15] do
[33:16] and he went out
[33:17] that was judas's problem he left
[33:20] he left the presence of God what was
[33:22] Cain's problem back in the Garden of
[33:24] Eden well he didn't have a problem while
[33:26] he was in the garden because God said
[33:27] hey if you'll do like your brother said
[33:29] I'll say in other words I'll save you
[33:31] that was a question last night and you
[33:33] know you hear people in the message
[33:34] preaching lineages and how that this is
[33:37] a serpent seed line and you can't do it
[33:39] come on people good grief
[33:42] Satan even had a choice
[33:45] amen he was made perfect
[33:47] he was made the anointed cherub he was
[33:50] made the right hand man of God
[33:52] until iniquity was found in his heart he
[33:55] made a choice
[33:56] Cain made a choice to go in another
[33:58] Direction
[33:59] it's all by choice folks
[34:02] it's my brother whis did a wonderful job
[34:04] Sunday bringing it down
[34:07] but you know what there's a lot of
[34:09] people that don't that don't like that
[34:11] because they want to think that they
[34:13] were just this always was an eagle and
[34:15] I'm always sitting in church and I'm
[34:16] always this and it makes that Brother
[34:18] Sam said it makes them lazy it makes you
[34:19] where you just say okay I got it
[34:21] boy I just felt something right here
[34:24] well you know what Judas when he was
[34:26] preaching the gospel remember Jesus gave
[34:29] him power to preach the gospel cast out
[34:32] devils
[34:34] that's why I said that somebody was
[34:36] talking about Judas last night the Bible
[34:38] says that Satan entered into the heart
[34:41] of Judas we read it we're going to read
[34:42] it in communion
[34:43] right Simon's son to betray him it
[34:46] entered him and you know brother Brian
[34:47] will say well he was the son of
[34:48] perdition he wasn't the Son of Perdition
[34:50] he was the son of Judas as whoever his
[34:52] mom and daddy was
[34:53] but when he accepted Satan's life when
[34:57] he accepted Satan why because here's my
[35:00] point the Bible Jesus looked at the
[35:03] people and says look bless you
[35:06] do that in about 40 minutes somebody
[35:09] wake up
[35:11] but here's Jesus and he looks at the
[35:14] people and he says you call me belzebub
[35:16] he said but Satan can't cast out Satan
[35:19] so if Judas was Satan
[35:22] he couldn't be casting out Devils when
[35:24] God told him but no he could cast out
[35:26] Devils because God give him an
[35:27] opportunity he give him three and a half
[35:30] years to make it right
[35:32] and finally he had to come to a showdown
[35:35] in the upper room he said Judas go do
[35:38] what you need to do
[35:40] Satan entered his heart and he went and
[35:42] did what he did and then remember the
[35:44] prophet of God said
[35:46] if he'd have made it to Pentecost he
[35:48] could have been saved he just he stopped
[35:49] that's our problem we shouldn't stop we
[35:52] need to keep going to what the Holy
[35:53] Ghost he was justified he was Sanctified
[35:56] but he was not filled with the Holy
[35:58] Ghost
[35:59] all right
[36:01] he would just but you said well that was
[36:03] just a lot no it wasn't as lineage right
[36:06] it was the foreknowledge of God knowing
[36:08] what Judas would do when he got here
[36:10] that's so simple it goes over people's
[36:13] mind and they go like well that was it
[36:15] I'm stamped you know I'm I'm gonna make
[36:17] it I'm predestinated listen everybody is
[36:19] predestinated
[36:21] every person is even Satan is
[36:23] predestinated don't you think God made
[36:26] him knowing what he would do
[36:28] but he made him to make a choice and
[36:31] when he made that choice he could be a
[36:32] Healer a savior a redeemer and all these
[36:34] different attributes that God could
[36:36] display
[36:37] because Satan made a choice listen God
[36:40] made a choice
[36:42] he chose
[36:43] me and you to be his bride
[36:47] so he made a choice he didn't have to
[36:49] listen he doesn't need us to exist
[36:52] but he wants us here
[36:53] to exist with him to come down into what
[36:56] into life into time
[37:00] get born again makes your soul Eternal
[37:03] not the rest of you and then you go what
[37:05] you go back to where you came from very
[37:08] simple
[37:10] in continuance we're being born as I was
[37:14] telling them last night and to preacher
[37:16] the other day was talking and he said
[37:17] you know what he said I know you're lost
[37:19] and I know you're a center for one thing
[37:21] you got a belly button
[37:24] you were tied to a woman
[37:28] you know what brother Brown said the
[37:29] problem was we were born by a woman if
[37:31] we're born by a man we'll live
[37:33] so that Genesis 1 26 man that I love so
[37:36] much that theophany of God it'll have a
[37:38] belly button
[37:40] because it was not tied to a woman it's
[37:42] tied to God it's tied to the eternal
[37:45] and that's what comes to you to New
[37:47] Birth listen if that was already in you
[37:49] Jesus didn't have to die
[37:52] what did the Holy Ghost come for
[37:56] kind of simple
[37:57] but you know what one word off folks you
[37:59] say boy sometimes y'all are a little bit
[38:01] uh dogmatic that's all right with me
[38:04] they call Jesus everything in the world
[38:07] but God
[38:08] maybe we ought to try that sometime
[38:11] be not conformed to this world but be
[38:12] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[38:14] that's what we got to work on because
[38:16] listen in your soul you have the mind of
[38:18] Christ today
[38:20] in your soul you are born again in your
[38:23] soul your Eternal Paul says sitting in
[38:26] Heavenly places in Christ
[38:28] try that on Monday
[38:32] yeah get up on Monday about two hours
[38:34] into your day and say I'm living in
[38:37] Heavenly places
[38:40] yeah exactly so all of us know we're all
[38:43] smiling we know what it on Monday you
[38:45] know two or three o'clock in the
[38:46] afternoon or right once you get up you
[38:49] got all that Monday stuff to do all
[38:51] right but that's your outside guy the
[38:54] inside guy is sitting in Heavenly places
[38:56] it is redeemed it is already
[38:59] up that statue of perfect man in itself
[39:03] but you and me we have to work on the
[39:05] memory reason conscious and affection or
[39:07] we wouldn't need a renewing of our mind
[39:10] renewing of this thing right as a man
[39:13] thinketh in his heart so is he we know
[39:15] the new birth changes that we were
[39:17] talking last night it absolutely
[39:19] transforms you
[39:21] into the children of light as the Bible
[39:23] says and not the children of Darkness
[39:26] that's why I said
[39:27] many times we we just look at quotes
[39:31] where brother Brown does say that you
[39:33] you know you were born with this seed
[39:34] now you were born in representation we
[39:36] know that
[39:37] but I want to ask you a question if you
[39:40] have a question about what we believe
[39:42] here in this church let me give you one
[39:44] example and it should help all of you
[39:46] go to the Book of Luke I've been reading
[39:48] it for the past three months
[39:50] the Bible says the unclean Spirit goes
[39:53] out of a man
[39:56] goes out of your what
[39:58] your soul
[40:00] so God can't be in your soul and Satan
[40:02] be in your soul at the same time folks
[40:05] it's a two Soul doctrine that was
[40:06] preached daddy fought against it for
[40:08] years back in the 80s did God give you a
[40:11] soul sake give you a soul whichever one
[40:13] beat it out and filed it and whichever
[40:15] one
[40:16] the devil ain't the devil I know is not
[40:18] that strong but the God I know is
[40:20] amen
[40:22] I was lost that unclean Spirit was in my
[40:25] soul it made me do things I didn't want
[40:27] to do sometimes but yes there was
[40:29] representation God knew before the
[40:32] foundation of the world that one day I
[40:33] get sick and tired of being sick and
[40:35] tired
[40:36] and I come right here to this altar on
[40:38] December the 17th 1997 and gave my heart
[40:41] to the Lord
[40:42] I knew there was a change but I knew it
[40:44] wasn't finished
[40:47] I wasn't finished oh that's it that seed
[40:49] just come to life and I started just
[40:51] preaching and and no
[40:53] I sat for six months before I got the
[40:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:57] I come to church
[40:59] read my Bible
[41:01] start opening service
[41:04] Philadelphia was once you take Sunday
[41:06] school so I started teaching Sunday
[41:07] school and it was a long time after that
[41:10] a year or so after the year after that
[41:13] and I think brother dick still got the
[41:15] or not him but you still got the tape
[41:17] there's a VHS tape that brother dick
[41:19] made in this church on my first sermon I
[41:20] preached so uh
[41:22] and from then on guess what I made a
[41:24] million mistakes
[41:26] backslid yes we all do
[41:29] but we still got to keep going
[41:31] get up and go again get up and go again
[41:34] Muhammad Ali he got knocked down a
[41:37] couple of times but you know what
[41:39] he made it it was the Gang
[41:42] why but he had to suffer we're going to
[41:45] read a scripture here we've got to
[41:46] suffer the rain
[41:47] we just don't become
[41:48] reigning Kings by nothing
[41:51] no we have to come to a place and that's
[41:53] why we believe in the Statue of perfect
[41:55] man we believe in justification which
[41:57] what chops off your past sins
[41:59] sanctification where that unclean Spirit
[42:01] that's in your soul
[42:03] that you were born with us a damnic
[42:05] nature you were born with a nature with
[42:07] a belly button
[42:08] comes from your parents
[42:11] and then you got to be born again
[42:15] by the word of God
[42:17] so your representation what comes down
[42:20] and gives you the New Birth by
[42:23] foreknowledge
[42:24] God knew all things
[42:26] second Peter 1 says Simon Peter and
[42:28] servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to
[42:30] them and what have obtained now why
[42:32] would we have to obtain stuff why would
[42:33] we have to fight why does the bible give
[42:35] us all these things that we got to do to
[42:37] get salvation
[42:40] if we already got it
[42:43] let's just say we were lost
[42:45] I like that
[42:47] I was lost I knew that
[42:50] I didn't just come to realization listen
[42:53] I'd heard sermons
[42:56] I had read books I'd listen to tapes
[42:59] but I wasn't born again
[43:02] I was lost that was an unclean spirit
[43:05] inside of me if you were and you know
[43:07] what if you'll realize that you might
[43:09] figure out you lost
[43:11] and need salvation what brother they'll
[43:13] always said we love to quote brother
[43:14] Dale I love this is the best quote I had
[43:16] rather
[43:17] seek every day of my life like Brother
[43:20] Don he's talking about putting on that
[43:21] list absolutely I'd rather seek God
[43:23] every day of my life and know that I had
[43:26] it at the end
[43:28] than to say well I always was eternal I
[43:30] think I'll just I'll just sing a couple
[43:32] of songs yeah I'll read a couple of
[43:34] books and and I'll make sure I don't put
[43:36] a dress on I mean I'll put a dress on
[43:37] until somebody sees me or don't see me
[43:41] right
[43:43] no it's a life
[43:45] it's a life-changing this is a
[43:48] life-changing message it's not a life
[43:49] listen it's not a it's not a it's not a
[43:52] a feel-good every once in a while
[43:55] attitude
[43:57] no it's a life
[43:59] I'd rather fight every day and say Lord
[44:04] how many of us have raised our hands and
[44:05] said God save me
[44:07] right man
[44:09] where'd that come you know God's not
[44:11] going to go oh no you won't have to say
[44:13] that I already know you should know by
[44:15] now no you got another little bird
[44:17] sitting on this shoulder going you ain't
[44:19] nothing
[44:20] you didn't do this you didn't do that
[44:22] you thought about this you spoke bad
[44:24] about this one
[44:25] he's gonna be right here and usually his
[44:28] volumes turned up a lot louder than this
[44:30] one over here I don't know if y'all I
[44:32] live this I don't know I'm just telling
[44:33] you my experience if you don't live it
[44:35] then that's fine pray for me
[44:37] but we do we all live it we all live
[44:40] here in humanity but we got up the
[44:43] statue of perfect man though it's what's
[44:45] going to work on our memory reason
[44:47] conscious affection imagination that all
[44:50] by the renewing of our mind as this
[44:52] afternoon we'll look at virtue virtue
[44:54] when you say virtue first thing that
[44:57] pops up or did would pop up in your head
[45:00] a virgin life
[45:01] clean life that's okay but that's not
[45:04] what that virtue means
[45:06] that virtue means power
[45:08] it means power
[45:11] and brother Brown said power without
[45:12] character satanic so we got to have the
[45:14] virtues the virtue
[45:17] the verse used to become a powerful Army
[45:20] and man's everybody with me because
[45:22] listen
[45:23] Peter James John Paul they all had these
[45:27] virtues working in their life so it's
[45:29] not something brand new it's something
[45:31] we need to read in the book of Acts
[45:34] you read in the book of Acts you're
[45:36] going to see the characteristics of
[45:37] Jesus Christ because that's who he was
[45:39] in his people they had got the unclean
[45:42] Spirit driven out of them come on
[45:44] somebody in the upper room
[45:46] and they what was filled with the Holy
[45:49] Ghost
[45:51] then they grew
[45:54] and Grace and knowledge
[45:56] Simon Peter servant Apostle of Jesus
[45:58] Christ with them have retained like
[45:59] Precious Faith with us through the
[46:01] righteousness of God and our Savior
[46:02] Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[46:04] multiplied unto you through the
[46:05] knowledge of God and Jesus our lord
[46:07] according has his divine power
[46:10] divine power hath given unto us all
[46:13] things that pertaining to life and
[46:14] godliness the knowledge of him that hath
[46:17] called us what to glory and virtue
[46:19] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[46:23] brother Brian said I read it the other
[46:25] day brother says don't ask for little
[46:26] things ask for big things
[46:29] he's a big guy ask for big things well
[46:31] I'm afraid he's going to be a little bit
[46:32] busy you ain't serving the same God I am
[46:35] en
[46:36] lying's never busy the old song says
[46:39] he's always right there right and he's
[46:41] never ladies always on time we may think
[46:43] he is but we're going to talk about
[46:45] patience in a little bit we're about her
[46:47] giving unto us exceeding great and
[46:48] precious promises that by these you
[46:50] might be what partaker so then we're
[46:52] able to partake of something
[46:54] we're going to partake partake of more
[46:56] of God yes
[46:58] all right if you got God in your soul
[47:00] you don't need to back up and start
[47:03] cleaning the soul back out it's clean
[47:05] we just need to let it out
[47:07] let that soul out and let it start doing
[47:10] its work and that's what we're talking
[47:11] about and how's it going to do it by the
[47:13] word of God yes yes no other way except
[47:15] by the word of God all right
[47:18] having escaped the corruption that is in
[47:21] the world through lust so the first
[47:23] stage is the birth brother Ryan says the
[47:24] first thing you got to do is be born
[47:26] again all right not realize you always
[47:29] was
[47:32] you can now
[47:34] you got to remember there's a there's a
[47:37] there's there's a two-fold we look at
[47:39] the Bible and we see that we were
[47:41] talking last night there's some
[47:42] scriptures that we use for the
[47:43] Millennium some will use for the future
[47:45] home some we can interchange
[47:48] there's some that we can't
[47:50] right
[47:52] so scripture has a dual meaning
[47:54] so brother Bradley said well brother
[47:55] Brown's got to do a minute yeah there's
[47:57] a doom any you got to be born again
[47:58] you've got to be born from above you got
[48:02] to be born again brother Brown didn't
[48:03] bring us a way to be born again it's
[48:05] already in the Bible he just brought us
[48:07] back to it what do you say restore yeah
[48:09] the faith of the father how are you
[48:12] going to restore something that's got 12
[48:14] 000 different denominations how are you
[48:15] going to restore that you can't there's
[48:17] only one truth
[48:18] amen one truth One Faith one Lord one
[48:21] baptism and his brother Richard Negron
[48:24] said he said there's one truth God you
[48:25] got to take me into that one truth
[48:28] not several truths one truth
[48:31] but the first thing you got to do is be
[48:33] born again you've got to be changed
[48:35] and when you're changed you become a new
[48:37] creation
[48:39] oh
[48:41] one time brother Brown said not the old
[48:43] one patched up
[48:46] the old one patched up is just the old
[48:48] you you've stuck peacock feathers into
[48:51] your Blackbird flesh
[48:52] and man that's what brother Bradham said
[48:54] but when you're born again it'll take
[48:56] care of itself when you're bored again
[48:58] like I've always said take a hog scrub
[49:00] it up put a suit on it and turn him out
[49:03] where's he go he's gonna go right back
[49:04] to the mud as we were talking last night
[49:08] you take people don't like the quotes of
[49:11] brother Brown where he says you were a
[49:12] kookaburra
[49:14] you work huckleberry
[49:17] and by the transforming power of God
[49:21] to make you a wheat he had to take the
[49:23] wheat life which is him you have to take
[49:26] the wheat life the wheat germ and put it
[49:28] in the cuckleberry
[49:31] it may still look like a kookaburra
[49:34] right
[49:35] but inside it's not a kookaburra anymore
[49:38] because it has had life not just that
[49:41] you all
[49:41] no you know what you know what came to
[49:44] life if you're a kookaburra kookaburra
[49:47] right
[49:49] but if you take the wheat life
[49:52] and put it in the Kookaburra you'll act
[49:54] like the wheat life just like this right
[49:56] here if you take what you take the life
[49:58] of a pig take it out and put the life of
[50:00] a lamb in he'll look like a pig
[50:02] sometimes he'll act like a pig come on
[50:04] somebody
[50:06] but deep down inside he's had a change
[50:08] and he won't go to that mud hole anymore
[50:11] he'll start acting better he'll start
[50:13] acting right all right you must be born
[50:16] again that is change there's got to be a
[50:19] change let's go down here a little bit
[50:21] further he might make a good neighbor
[50:23] but he isn't a Christian until he's born
[50:26] again
[50:28] that takes care of the always was right
[50:31] listen as we were as I brought my
[50:33] thought back thank you Lord but you know
[50:35] brother Brown when he's talking you got
[50:37] to remember he's in the mind of God
[50:39] sometimes and he's on Earth sometimes
[50:41] everybody with me he's in the mind of
[50:44] God he actually said let's go back into
[50:46] the bad part of God's mind so he took us
[50:48] back there
[50:49] to show us that we always were Eternal
[50:52] if we have the new birth if we've
[50:54] accepted it down here
[50:56] all right
[50:58] and if you hadn't then guess what
[51:00] that's what brother Brown said he said
[51:02] he said what'd he say about the the
[51:04] Pharisees he said they did not have
[51:06] represents what was a representation
[51:07] that God by far knowledge looked down
[51:10] and said they're not going to accept me
[51:13] therefore I don't have to keep anything
[51:14] for them but I'm not going to let them
[51:16] know that they said brother random if
[51:18] this is all true this predestination why
[51:20] are you preaching
[51:21] because why would you preach
[51:26] he said I'll throw the net out
[51:29] now throw the net out I bring it in he
[51:32] said I get crawdads he said I get snakes
[51:34] I get different things he said but I get
[51:35] some fish every once in a while
[51:37] because you know what we are not
[51:39] born the word of God that brother Louise
[51:42] was talking about you got to read that
[51:43] and who is this Melchizedek brother
[51:44] Brown said we didn't come word for him
[51:46] we came with a belly button we came with
[51:49] an older Dynamic nature Jesus
[51:52] now listen he came with a belly button
[51:54] but he wasn't attached to his mama that
[51:57] wasn't his mama's blood that was God's
[51:59] blood everybody with me he was attached
[52:01] by normal but remember he had to come
[52:03] like me and you he couldn't come
[52:04] different
[52:06] to save us and to give us New Birth why
[52:09] would he need to come if he just on
[52:11] Nicodemus
[52:12] come on now you're the you're the
[52:15] teacher of Israel you know every quote
[52:17] there is in the book
[52:19] all you got to do is just believe that
[52:22] no he said you've got to be born again
[52:24] you've got to be changed from what you
[52:27] were to a new creature
[52:29] in Christ that's why there's not many
[52:31] new births
[52:33] it's just
[52:35] a good feeling
[52:38] I just want us all to be born again
[52:39] that's why I want us to all strive
[52:41] Lord save me
[52:44] but now we can't stay there though
[52:46] Hebrews 6 1 says leaving therefore
[52:49] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[52:51] of Christ not leaving it and throwing it
[52:53] away no go up higher
[52:56] let us go on into Perfection sure he
[52:58] loves us to be babies
[53:01] but he wants us to be adults
[53:03] he won't he don't want us to uh brother
[53:05] Brown preach why cry
[53:07] why can't I speak
[53:10] when you can't speak if you speak a mess
[53:12] you got to speak with the virtues
[53:14] working in your life as I'll read in
[53:16] just a little while or maybe this
[53:17] afternoon he said those those uh
[53:20] disciples they waited on God
[53:23] and when they got a little nod they knew
[53:26] what to do with it
[53:27] that's what you and I have to do
[53:31] therefore leaving the principles of the
[53:33] doctrine of Christ let us go on into
[53:34] Perfection not laying again the
[53:37] foundation of repentance and that's okay
[53:39] we'll baptized we baptize 20 people
[53:42] we'll baptize whoever needs to be
[53:43] baptized we'll get you started in the
[53:46] right direction but you are going to
[53:47] have to make an effort right right
[53:51] to get born again
[53:53] of the doctrine of baptism and laying on
[53:55] of hands and resurrection of the dead
[53:56] and of Eternal judgment and look and
[53:58] this we will do if God permits
[54:00] how's he going to do it how are we going
[54:02] to do it
[54:04] he gave some Apostles some prophets some
[54:06] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[54:07] what for the Perfection of the Saints
[54:09] I've said many times before and I'll say
[54:10] it again you can get born again we were
[54:13] talking about last night I keep
[54:14] referring back last night if all y'all
[54:15] would have been here last night we
[54:16] wouldn't have to refer back to last
[54:17] night but anyway
[54:19] um
[54:20] last night we were talking about that
[54:22] and for the perfecting of the Saints
[54:28] there was a chicken yard
[54:31] there was a chicken yard and brother
[54:33] Brown's always refers to that about his
[54:35] little Eagle story
[54:36] all right see that then everybody goes
[54:38] oh there it is brother I always was an
[54:40] eagle you got to remember what what was
[54:42] the barnyard
[54:43] what was the chickens denominations
[54:47] he was preaching to people that were
[54:49] stuck in denomination that was already
[54:51] born again
[54:53] but they just didn't realize that he was
[54:55] the mother eagle
[54:57] come on people brother Brown's message
[54:59] not brother Brown his message was the
[55:01] mother Eagle that that went over into
[55:03] their Church
[55:06] and preached the word and said come out
[55:08] of her
[55:09] Eagles
[55:11] you got to realize who you are
[55:14] right because remember you were born a
[55:16] kookaburra
[55:18] and you had to be transferred life
[55:20] transferred into you
[55:22] for the Perfection of the Saints for the
[55:24] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[55:26] the body of Christ till look till we all
[55:28] come to the unity of faith of the
[55:31] knowledge of the Son of God and to a
[55:32] perfect man into the measure of the
[55:34] Statue of the fullness of Christ look
[55:36] that we hint forth being no more
[55:37] children
[55:38] toss to and fro and carried away with
[55:41] every wind of Doctrine by what the
[55:43] slight of men
[55:45] sadly the same preachers
[55:48] amen
[55:51] carried about with every wind of
[55:52] Doctrine by the slight of men and
[55:54] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[55:57] wait to deceive listen God has never
[56:00] ever ever
[56:03] spoke a false Doctrine
[56:05] ever
[56:06] he can't
[56:07] he is the truth that's why Jesus is the
[56:10] truth that's why this message is the
[56:13] truth but they took this message and
[56:14] divided it up into 700 different places
[56:16] or different ideas
[56:18] but there's got to be one
[56:22] from whom the whole whole body fitly
[56:24] joined together and compacted by that
[56:26] whichever joint supplies we better get
[56:29] compacted
[56:31] because every crack we have the devil is
[56:33] going to stick something in it
[56:35] because that's his job
[56:36] that man does his job really well but I
[56:39] got a God that does it way better than
[56:41] that
[56:42] he's wanting to heal me he's wanting to
[56:44] save me not destroy me
[56:48] according to the factual working in the
[56:50] measure of every part making the
[56:51] increase of the body into the edifying
[56:53] itself in love
[56:56] i hidden life in Christ what a beautiful
[56:57] picture it is today of a consecrated
[56:59] life who once enters in with Christ dead
[57:02] to the things of the world hid away with
[57:04] God and the veil dropped around him and
[57:06] all the world shut off
[57:08] then Christianity and religion become a
[57:10] pleasure
[57:12] azure
[57:13] to every believer
[57:16] if you're struggling
[57:18] sure we have struggles but if you're
[57:19] struggling with that you need to get
[57:21] born again
[57:22] I'm sorry
[57:23] I
[57:25] it's just there's two factions working
[57:27] here there's two powers
[57:29] devil power and God's power there's not
[57:32] an in-between right
[57:34] then Christianity and religion becomes a
[57:36] pleasure to every believer I love coming
[57:39] to bible study I love coming to church I
[57:41] love studying to come and preach to you
[57:43] while you're out doing whatever you're
[57:44] doing brother Dale did it for years and
[57:47] years and years I'm beginning to
[57:48] understand a little bit why he went
[57:49] crazy
[57:51] I'm not talking about that I'm talking
[57:52] about he wouldn't it just went crazy
[57:55] he would come to the house and sit down
[57:57] he said put on a hunting video and I
[58:00] knew right then that there was a issue
[58:01] going on that he was having a problem
[58:03] with Humanity
[58:04] with y'all's humanity and mine because I
[58:07] was lost he was still praying for me too
[58:09] he said put on a hunting video he just
[58:12] sit there put on a hunting video and I
[58:14] put one on he'd watch it and he said
[58:15] okay let's go hunt her he doesn't talk
[58:16] about something like that because I
[58:18] couldn't talk he couldn't talk to me
[58:19] about the word of God
[58:21] but he had to get that out of his mind
[58:23] he had to get that out of his mind look
[58:25] at brother Brown he looked 70 something
[58:27] years old he just looked old he was only
[58:29] 56 a lot of us have already passed that
[58:32] he was 56 but the body look at Jesus
[58:37] you be a man not over 50 years old it
[58:40] was only 33.
[58:42] it was the work they did you know what
[58:44] it was we were going to get into it the
[58:46] reason I said that we're going to get
[58:47] into it that because you've drug virtue
[58:49] out of that man for all those years
[58:52] sister gayles the ones that been here a
[58:54] lot we've drug virtue out of brother
[58:56] Dale
[58:58] the good part of virtue we drug it out
[59:01] of him
[59:03] and that's what we do we we virtuous
[59:05] power you got to have it before you can
[59:08] draw from it we'll read that from
[59:09] Brother Bradham talks about you got to
[59:10] have it so you got to have somebody that
[59:12] has it before you can draw it from them
[59:13] then when you draw it from them you just
[59:16] get weak in the knees you get brother
[59:17] Brown says I can't even feel my face
[59:19] sometimes
[59:21] my face goes numb
[59:23] the man
[59:24] well we were praying for those people
[59:25] the other weekend and and brother Ronnie
[59:28] and I were discussing a little bit later
[59:29] I cannot remember who we were praying
[59:32] for but all of a sudden you just kind of
[59:34] feel like that that somebody's pulled a
[59:35] plug
[59:37] on your electrical circuit
[59:39] and you just go
[59:40] now I know some of the ministers know
[59:41] that no dad knows it for sure because
[59:43] he's done it before
[59:45] laying hands on the sick
[59:47] there's a charge comes out of you and
[59:48] when that person receives something
[59:50] they're pulling it from you
[59:52] they're pulling it out of you they're
[59:54] pulling that strength out of you and you
[59:56] know that people get and I don't go by
[59:58] those feelings but there is sometimes
[59:59] when you go man that person really got
[1:00:01] something
[1:00:02] because it just it just drains you and
[1:00:04] it just sometimes will knock you
[1:00:05] backwards almost but you know what
[1:00:07] that's the way it ought to work that's
[1:00:08] the virtue and each one of you should
[1:00:10] have virtue that we can draw from that
[1:00:12] we can go to you not like I said before
[1:00:14] if we got a problem in our Christian
[1:00:16] life you don't go to the convenience
[1:00:18] store and ask the convenience owner what
[1:00:20] to do about something in your life
[1:00:22] you know what he's going to tell you
[1:00:24] have a drink
[1:00:26] right have a smoke
[1:00:29] now is that virtue or not no there's no
[1:00:31] virtue in that
[1:00:33] but you come and talk to a preacher you
[1:00:34] talk to a friend of yours that you know
[1:00:36] is born again and you get what you get
[1:00:38] strength from that you get virtue from
[1:00:41] that that's what we're going to talk
[1:00:42] about
[1:00:43] knowing that you ought not to do this I
[1:00:45] was talking you know what reason I think
[1:00:47] about you look at brother Homer Longoria
[1:00:48] look at these ministers that are getting
[1:00:49] older and man they're just I mean I'm
[1:00:52] not saying they're falling apart don't
[1:00:53] get me wrong but they're body wise
[1:00:55] we're not made for that kind of an
[1:00:57] anointing to just be every day just
[1:00:59] bombarding your flesh you get old
[1:01:02] looking brother Homer he's having some
[1:01:03] bad issues uh he's getting better now
[1:01:06] but uh he that COPD that he's had and to
[1:01:09] be a minister that's the first thing
[1:01:11] Satan should attack
[1:01:13] it's his lungs
[1:01:15] because he can't speak
[1:01:17] he gets all clogged up and he can't
[1:01:19] speed well you know what if he shuts us
[1:01:21] all up he wins he is not going to shut
[1:01:24] us all up
[1:01:25] somebody's gonna make it somebody is
[1:01:28] going to take this thing forward and we
[1:01:31] go listen
[1:01:32] what I always say lead follow or get out
[1:01:35] of the way
[1:01:37] don't hinder
[1:01:41] well well I got awful now because that's
[1:01:43] for this afternoon but anyway
[1:01:45] but that's what virtue is virtue's not
[1:01:47] living a virgin life
[1:01:49] it's drawing strength from from from
[1:01:51] sermons and strength from even from
[1:01:53] Brother Adam if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:01:55] and you listened to a tape that was that
[1:01:56] was in the 40s
[1:01:59] he said well that's pretty weak no you
[1:02:01] draw strength from that why there's
[1:02:03] virtue in that you draw virtue from all
[1:02:06] that amen
[1:02:07] even brother random I was reading just a
[1:02:09] few minutes ago talking about altar
[1:02:10] calls
[1:02:11] he made altar calls up to up to his he
[1:02:14] died
[1:02:16] but he said it's not supposed to be
[1:02:18] right not supposed to there's not no
[1:02:20] supposed to be an altar call in a
[1:02:22] gentile Church
[1:02:24] that's what he said he said it speak the
[1:02:27] word
[1:02:28] and that's supposed to be it he said but
[1:02:29] we still have them and we'll continue to
[1:02:31] have them amen we're supposed to come
[1:02:34] into speaking dick condition but we
[1:02:36] still lay hands on the sick because
[1:02:38] that's what the Bible says can't take it
[1:02:39] out of the Bible amen so what you draw
[1:02:42] virtue from that you come up here what
[1:02:43] you've gone up here saying well I don't
[1:02:45] know if I want that guy to pray for me
[1:02:47] or not well if you don't then find
[1:02:49] somebody to pray for you
[1:02:50] somebody you got some confidence here
[1:02:52] somebody's got some virtue because you
[1:02:54] know what it's something you need
[1:02:58] amen it's something you need so here we
[1:03:01] are going up the statue of perfect man
[1:03:02] we got to start down here at the bottom
[1:03:04] at the new birth which is faith
[1:03:08] have faith and be born again we got to
[1:03:10] have faith for the new birth and then we
[1:03:12] climb up as that Shadow shows us you
[1:03:15] start as a little kid and then you come
[1:03:16] up what to full maturity this is the
[1:03:19] only age
[1:03:20] that we're to come to full maturity
[1:03:23] hey man that's right everybody else
[1:03:25] didn't didn't have the open book they
[1:03:27] they didn't know what the seals were
[1:03:28] they didn't know what these different
[1:03:30] doctrines that we know about now because
[1:03:32] remember the sales is for your
[1:03:34] Redemption full Redemption Body Spirit
[1:03:37] and soul
[1:03:38] working under a closed book they didn't
[1:03:41] come to the body change they couldn't
[1:03:42] because they didn't have the seals open
[1:03:46] even Paul
[1:03:48] Peter the ones we're talking about here
[1:03:50] there's a further month past that
[1:03:54] oh
[1:03:56] there is God wants a body change that
[1:04:00] they couldn't come to
[1:04:01] but you and I can
[1:04:05] I guess why those seals are so important
[1:04:06] that's why the Daniel 70 weeks that's
[1:04:08] why all these different doctrines have
[1:04:10] to be lined up or you will not get it
[1:04:13] like Dad said last night it doesn't
[1:04:15] de-christianize people because I
[1:04:16] understand
[1:04:17] when he makes those statements a lot of
[1:04:19] people say well he's saying I ain't a
[1:04:21] Christian no it's not saying that
[1:04:24] because your baby right here if you're
[1:04:26] born again today as we were talking last
[1:04:29] night
[1:04:30] how many times have I said that
[1:04:32] we get to live in the new city
[1:04:35] because we're born again here
[1:04:38] we receive the new birth here
[1:04:41] we are bride here
[1:04:44] now there's going to be if it if it's
[1:04:47] brother Brown talks about one in a
[1:04:48] million
[1:04:49] if there's one of us there's a million
[1:04:51] people going to live outside the city
[1:04:53] if there's a million of us there's going
[1:04:54] to be 100 million people or more than
[1:04:56] that a billion people live out in
[1:04:57] outside
[1:05:00] somebody with me
[1:05:02] so the new birth puts us in that
[1:05:05] position that we can go to that City not
[1:05:08] go through judgment
[1:05:10] but the foolish version has got to go
[1:05:12] through judgment because they came to
[1:05:14] justification and sanctification they
[1:05:17] didn't go on to the New Birth so they
[1:05:18] have to brother Brown said give their
[1:05:20] life for the gospel but they gonna stay
[1:05:22] dead for a thousand years
[1:05:24] and then come up at the wife's own
[1:05:25] judgment and have to give what an
[1:05:27] account of what they did I do not want
[1:05:29] to give an account of my works
[1:05:32] do you
[1:05:34] our righteousness is filthy rags the
[1:05:37] Bible says but who stood for you the one
[1:05:40] that is righteous
[1:05:41] Jesus Christ stood my sin he stood my
[1:05:45] judgment he went to judgment hall for me
[1:05:47] and you that's why that's so important
[1:05:49] to get born again because you get born
[1:05:51] again you get to live in the city now
[1:05:53] listen the ones on the outsider is just
[1:05:55] as Eternal As You Are
[1:05:58] because there's only one form of eternal
[1:06:00] life there's not degrees but there is
[1:06:01] position
[1:06:04] folks come on there's possession clowns
[1:06:09] you're going to be what priests and
[1:06:11] kings
[1:06:12] there is position that goes with
[1:06:15] here now what goes with a position here
[1:06:18] brothers and sisters it's why it's so
[1:06:19] important without somebody living these
[1:06:22] virtues and being sealed by a special
[1:06:25] anointing we'll talk about way later
[1:06:27] and that Capstone which is him
[1:06:30] sitting down on the church and taking a
[1:06:33] body change we're going to still be here
[1:06:35] and just die all over the place
[1:06:37] somebody's got to come through this
[1:06:41] and manifest the son of man that's the
[1:06:45] plan I didn't make it but I sure want to
[1:06:47] be a part of it don't you you want to be
[1:06:50] a part of it say I want to be a part of
[1:06:52] it
[1:06:54] that makes it an individual
[1:06:56] I want to be a part of it then I want my
[1:06:59] kids to be a part of it
[1:07:01] I want my family to be a part of we want
[1:07:03] my in-laws to be a part of it
[1:07:05] why wouldn't you
[1:07:08] he certainly If any man will come after
[1:07:10] me let him deny himself
[1:07:12] take up his cross daily
[1:07:14] so you got to cross the bear as I said
[1:07:16] before there are some people that are
[1:07:18] enemies of the cross that will never be
[1:07:20] given eternal life you'll never see them
[1:07:22] in a kingdom anywhere except the one
[1:07:23] down underneath
[1:07:25] all right but there is going to be a
[1:07:27] group of people giving eternal life cup
[1:07:29] of water in my name foolish virgin the
[1:07:31] ones that didn't hear the gospel brother
[1:07:32] Brown said will be judged by what their
[1:07:35] works
[1:07:36] then they'll be divided as sheep to
[1:07:38] goats they'll get to live outside the
[1:07:40] city
[1:07:42] right
[1:07:43] billions of people living outside the
[1:07:46] city but there's only going to be a
[1:07:48] bride living in the city with 144 000 as
[1:07:51] servants to the bride and like I said
[1:07:54] yesterday that's the difference in the
[1:07:56] Millennium in the future home in the
[1:07:58] Millennium the Bible says we'll build
[1:08:00] and inhabit
[1:08:01] in the Millennium that thing's already
[1:08:03] built
[1:08:04] it was built before the foundation of
[1:08:05] the world it was that Genesis 1 26 man
[1:08:08] that was the kingdom that was built
[1:08:11] that's going to set down on the mountain
[1:08:13] after everything else is wiped off again
[1:08:15] even all this stuff that we did in the
[1:08:17] Millennium is going to be wiped off
[1:08:19] for a new Heaven and a new Earth just
[1:08:22] the way he wiped you off but look you're
[1:08:24] still here
[1:08:25] the hand that used to pick up a beer now
[1:08:27] picks up a Bible the voice in my voice
[1:08:30] in my mouth it used to curse doesn't do
[1:08:32] that anymore
[1:08:36] so he didn't destroy the frame he's not
[1:08:38] going to destroy the framework of this
[1:08:39] of this world
[1:08:41] see that's a great Revelation because
[1:08:43] most people think
[1:08:45] well this is just going to be
[1:08:46] annihilated and we're going to go to
[1:08:48] heaven live on a cloud play a heart I
[1:08:50] don't know
[1:08:51] that's not true
[1:08:53] this is our Earth
[1:08:54] Satan took it from me and you
[1:08:57] he didn't take it from God
[1:08:59] he took it from us
[1:09:01] Adam what's the ruler of this Earth Adam
[1:09:04] the prophet said had the title deed to
[1:09:06] this earth
[1:09:08] hey when you hold a towel indeed what's
[1:09:10] that ownership
[1:09:11] he owned it but forfeited it for Eve
[1:09:16] because he loved her
[1:09:19] and he said I don't can't you can't
[1:09:20] destroy her without destroying me what
[1:09:22] did Moses say when he fell in the Gap he
[1:09:24] said look God if you're going to destroy
[1:09:25] them people you got to destroy me too he
[1:09:27] stood in the Gap he stood as what Christ
[1:09:30] and the bride doing the bad stuff that
[1:09:32] they were doing but Jesus said I'll take
[1:09:34] their sin
[1:09:36] I'll take it on me because I'm going to
[1:09:38] have a bride so there's some that are
[1:09:40] what enemies of the Cross some go to the
[1:09:42] cross and get born again or get
[1:09:44] Justified or get Sanctified but there's
[1:09:46] a group of people that takes every bit
[1:09:48] of that and takes up your cross you take
[1:09:50] up your individual cross and you follow
[1:09:52] him
[1:09:54] for whosoever shall save his life shall
[1:09:56] lose it but whosoever will lose his life
[1:09:57] for my sake the same shall save it
[1:10:02] I protest in by my by your rejoicing
[1:10:05] which I have in Christ look I Die daily
[1:10:11] I Die daily
[1:10:14] things I used to do I do them no more
[1:10:17] things I used to do I do them no more
[1:10:21] why you changed
[1:10:23] you've got a new attitude
[1:10:25] you've got God is starting on the
[1:10:27] renewing of your mind he's starting to
[1:10:28] let you see things that he didn't let
[1:10:31] people see before start let you enter
[1:10:33] into what the mind of God to see now as
[1:10:36] we see as mature Christians that's why
[1:10:38] brother around him he said it's hard to
[1:10:40] preach predestination to a group that's
[1:10:43] not in other words not grown up
[1:10:46] right remember he said it's not a good
[1:10:48] word to use out there
[1:10:50] but the Ephesian Church you could use
[1:10:52] that word and know that those he
[1:10:55] foreknew
[1:10:56] he did predestinate for knowledge is
[1:10:59] always first because it's four knowledge
[1:11:01] it was before predestination he foreknew
[1:11:05] therefore he could predetermine your
[1:11:07] destination by what you choose
[1:11:11] I was thinking about this the other day
[1:11:13] brother Dale years ago preached on the
[1:11:15] the uh
[1:11:17] God being infinite and us being finite
[1:11:19] God being infinite knew that if I never
[1:11:22] met June and I married the girl that I
[1:11:24] dated before which was
[1:11:26] I'm not gonna call her name
[1:11:28] but you don't know who it was
[1:11:31] how my life would have ended up
[1:11:34] that's an infant got infinite God
[1:11:36] knowing all things
[1:11:38] how did if you chose this path that's
[1:11:40] why you say well prove it to me brother
[1:11:42] Brown said God's no's are the best yeses
[1:11:45] you'll ever get
[1:11:46] because you're going to go down there
[1:11:48] how many of us have said this is it this
[1:11:50] is the will of the Lord this is
[1:11:52] everything I've been looking for I I
[1:11:55] mean Donnie don't don't
[1:11:57] I'm not pointing at you I'm pointing
[1:11:58] over under me I'm sorry I didn't I
[1:12:01] called your name listen but we've all
[1:12:04] been through it we've all said this is
[1:12:06] it
[1:12:07] this is the Promised Land
[1:12:11] and come to find out it was the
[1:12:13] Wasteland
[1:12:16] amen but if we were to listen to God a
[1:12:20] child of God listens to God it's like we
[1:12:22] were talking about the other day you
[1:12:24] know the guy said well God why didn't
[1:12:26] you save me uh when he got to Heaven he
[1:12:28] said Lord why didn't you save me he said
[1:12:30] I sent you two boats I sent you an
[1:12:32] airplane a helicopter
[1:12:34] and you said no I'm waiting on no
[1:12:37] if God sends you a helicopter you better
[1:12:38] get on it
[1:12:40] so if God says no
[1:12:42] so there I proved my point if God says
[1:12:44] no he knows that if you're going to go
[1:12:46] down this path right here what your end
[1:12:48] is going to be and he's going to say no
[1:12:50] child don't go that way
[1:12:54] so that's why it's the best yes as
[1:12:55] you'll ever get
[1:12:57] because then you turn around and say hey
[1:12:58] there's something there's something
[1:13:00] going to happen God already sees
[1:13:02] something that's going to happen down at
[1:13:04] the end of the road here I better not go
[1:13:06] down that way thank God for that amen
[1:13:08] remember he's only obligated to his
[1:13:11] children
[1:13:12] everybody with me he's obligated to his
[1:13:15] kids so he's obligated to take care of
[1:13:16] us aren't we obligated to take care of
[1:13:18] our kids until they get old enough
[1:13:21] to fend for their self
[1:13:24] not be Boomerang Kids
[1:13:26] throw them out they come back throw them
[1:13:28] out they come back
[1:13:30] I got one so that's okay
[1:13:33] what some of us yeah well Donnie's got a
[1:13:35] couple too so praise God you know I'd
[1:13:37] rather be him there than be in the bars
[1:13:39] I'd rather be there into being a drug
[1:13:41] house
[1:13:44] please God pray for him
[1:13:46] so you know what give something pray for
[1:13:47] if you ain't got nothing else to pray
[1:13:48] for pray for your kids
[1:13:50] because you know what they'll make you
[1:13:51] pray for them
[1:13:52] because you love them they're part of
[1:13:54] you you can't just you can't just kick
[1:13:55] them out in the world
[1:13:57] I'm sorry let me get into this you're a
[1:14:00] chosen generation here we go a royal
[1:14:01] priesthood a holy nation in other words
[1:14:04] God's saying I'm going to take care of
[1:14:05] you
[1:14:07] I'm going to give you a kingdom
[1:14:10] give you this Earth you can have it
[1:14:13] but we got to go through these what
[1:14:15] light afflictions
[1:14:16] the Earth has got to go through a couple
[1:14:19] of times of being renovated
[1:14:21] remember it was renovated in the flood
[1:14:25] right
[1:14:26] it's going to be renovated in the battle
[1:14:28] of Armageddon for the Millennium then
[1:14:31] it's going to be really renovated when
[1:14:33] God steps up and wipes everything off
[1:14:36] except us
[1:14:38] we can be standing right in the middle
[1:14:39] of it and be going man this is pretty
[1:14:42] nice
[1:14:43] in the world just being wiped completely
[1:14:45] off
[1:14:46] because we're what we're in glorified
[1:14:48] bodies these are we've got the new birth
[1:14:49] and we've come to a body change and
[1:14:52] we're no more less God than he is except
[1:14:56] for position we're the bride right but
[1:14:59] he said we're bone of his bone and flesh
[1:15:01] of his flesh that's what he said
[1:15:04] but we got to come to it it's not just
[1:15:05] something that just falls on us all
[1:15:07] right
[1:15:09] don't you really wish well I do when I
[1:15:12] was in about the second or third grade I
[1:15:13] just wish that I knew calculus and
[1:15:15] algebra and I could just jump up and
[1:15:17] going into college no I it took me 12
[1:15:19] long years Brother John
[1:15:22] yeah
[1:15:24] being an accountant you I mean when
[1:15:26] you're third grade you say man I can do
[1:15:27] your undo your taxes for you no you
[1:15:29] can't
[1:15:31] that would be a disaster
[1:15:34] please don't ever do that but that's the
[1:15:36] way God that's the way we grow in God
[1:15:39] he was an intelligent child I was an
[1:15:42] intelligent child
[1:15:43] lost it a lot afterwards
[1:15:45] but I had to still go through what the
[1:15:47] required courses I had to go through the
[1:15:49] required courses
[1:15:51] right we're going to see here in just a
[1:15:53] few minutes where God said that these
[1:15:55] are required
[1:15:57] these virtues are required of you
[1:15:59] they're not a they're not an elective
[1:16:01] you remember you know what electives are
[1:16:03] what do they call them now maybe what
[1:16:05] they call them now
[1:16:06] it's not an elective but it's what
[1:16:08] it's called it's oh it's still called an
[1:16:10] elective I thought it was called
[1:16:11] something else alternate learning or
[1:16:13] whatever it is you know you it's an
[1:16:15] elective that you really don't need that
[1:16:17] to graduate but it'd be nice I took what
[1:16:19] I took was is and y'all know my story I
[1:16:22] love math and I wasn't uh never made a
[1:16:25] beat till I got to college and and I I
[1:16:28] could understand calculus algebra that
[1:16:30] was nothing to me I took a general
[1:16:32] mathematics course my senior year as an
[1:16:35] elective didn't need that no more than
[1:16:37] nothing but you know what I learned how
[1:16:38] to do fractions and and me and T was the
[1:16:41] same way I mean you we do our stuff in
[1:16:43] our head because he had you know he he
[1:16:45] had a uh a business where he had to no
[1:16:47] figures and no different when I so did I
[1:16:50] and that helped me more than anything oh
[1:16:52] coach Whitaker good grief he chewed
[1:16:54] tobacco and spit in the in the cannon
[1:16:56] and done other things in the classroom
[1:16:58] but he taught me how to do fractions
[1:17:00] taught me how to read a tape measure how
[1:17:02] many y'all know how to read a tape
[1:17:03] measure that's what I thought not many
[1:17:09] because you know what that wasn't a
[1:17:11] required course though
[1:17:12] now required was algebra required was
[1:17:15] calculus required were the well this you
[1:17:18] know what those are required courses
[1:17:21] that's required courses we got to go

[1:17:32] of him that has called you out of
[1:17:34] Darkness

[1:17:38] past you were not a people oh I always
[1:17:41] was well this said you weren't
[1:17:44] which in times past were not a people
[1:17:46] but are now the people of God which had

[1:18:05] evildoers they may by your good works
[1:18:08] which they Shall Behold glorify God in
[1:18:11] the day of visitation you're going to
[1:18:13] help somebody by the way you live or
[1:18:14] you're going to hurt somebody by the way
[1:18:15] you live that's what we're fixing to get
[1:18:17] into
[1:18:17] hey man you gonna hurt somebody or help
[1:18:20] somebody
[1:18:21] submit yourself to every ordinance of
[1:18:23] man for the Lord's sake whether it be
[1:18:25] Kings or Supreme in other words
[1:18:27] if you've got to go to work tomorrow be
[1:18:28] there at eight o'clock don't come in at
[1:18:29] 8 15 and say well the Lord told me I
[1:18:31] didn't have to be here till 8 15. you're
[1:18:34] probably asking the Lord to get you
[1:18:35] another job
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:41] I mean you know you pray for God to give
[1:18:43] you a job and you sit at home watch
[1:18:44] television I don't know if God's gonna
[1:18:46] give you one or not he's going to ask
[1:18:47] for a little effort
[1:18:50] that's just a laugh lesson there aren't
[1:18:52] the governors as unto them that are sent
[1:18:54] by him for the punishment of evil doers
[1:18:55] for the praise of them that do well this
[1:18:57] is why I'm getting to him for so is the
[1:18:59] will of God all right so is the will of
[1:19:01] God that with well-doing you may put to
[1:19:05] silence the ignorance of foolish man
[1:19:08] that's what we're doing here
[1:19:10] put to silence the ignorance of foolish
[1:19:13] men
[1:19:14] how are we going to do that
[1:19:16] now we got to come to full Doctrine I
[1:19:18] like good shouting meetings where we
[1:19:20] just clap our hands and shout and have a
[1:19:21] good time have a great powerful service
[1:19:23] and things dance in the bubble as it
[1:19:25] were but wait
[1:19:27] then when The Showdown time comes you
[1:19:30] don't know where you're standing
[1:19:35] so there's going to be a showdown
[1:19:37] there's going to be a showdown in your
[1:19:39] life there's going to be a showdown in
[1:19:41] church there's going to be a showdown
[1:19:43] with the devil because he's got dibs on
[1:19:45] your body
[1:19:46] there's going to be a showdown where one
[1:19:47] day you're going to say Satan this is
[1:19:49] not yours no more
[1:19:50] amen
[1:19:52] we should be starting to say that now
[1:19:53] but there's going to be a showdown of
[1:19:55] culmination in other words of everything
[1:19:56] that was a showdown when Noah preached
[1:19:58] 120 years one day God said enough
[1:20:02] that's enough
[1:20:03] get in the ark
[1:20:05] I'm gonna close the door
[1:20:07] there's a showdown time
[1:20:09] in other words what's he saying when you
[1:20:10] when we come and we have the great
[1:20:12] service like we did a couple weeks ago
[1:20:13] but we can't live what we preach
[1:20:16] we all fall short
[1:20:19] but we keep getting up and going
[1:20:21] there's a showdown you don't know where
[1:20:23] you're standing let's get back and find
[1:20:25] out let's find out what's making us do
[1:20:27] that listen let's find out what's making
[1:20:30] us act wrong
[1:20:31] let's find out what's making us think
[1:20:33] wrong
[1:20:34] yeah
[1:20:37] that's what the statue to me that's what
[1:20:38] statue perfect man is it's not just
[1:20:40] living a
[1:20:42] knows how to act to your boss it's how
[1:20:44] to act to your neighbors it's how to act
[1:20:46] to these different to different people
[1:20:48] now look now what is it we'll stop right
[1:20:51] here
[1:20:51] it's easy to feel the power of God to
[1:20:53] see it when you believe but then when it
[1:20:55] comes to The Showdown are you able to
[1:20:58] possess the thing that you profess to
[1:21:00] have
[1:21:02] that's the thing brother you've got to
[1:21:05] get it we've got to take it it's ours
[1:21:07] but you'll fight for every inch
[1:21:11] Fellowship
[1:21:13] 1962. brother Brown says we're all tried
[1:21:16] every Christian every son every child
[1:21:19] that comes to God is tried what not by
[1:21:22] the neighbor
[1:21:23] oh yeah well it is but it's Tried by the
[1:21:26] word of God Amen you're Tried by the
[1:21:28] word yes you know brother Brown said
[1:21:30] he'll have a brother say something to
[1:21:31] you off kind of off
[1:21:33] to see how you'll react to it I have to
[1:21:36] swallow that one
[1:21:38] have somebody say something to you to
[1:21:40] see how you'll Act you know what your
[1:21:42] child training my child training see if
[1:21:45] you'll be loyal to it
[1:21:47] when The Showdown comes what decision
[1:21:49] are you going to make that's it and he
[1:21:52] that cannot stand chastisement but goes
[1:21:55] on with the world he's an illegitimate
[1:21:56] child
[1:21:57] and not a son and daughter of God
[1:21:59] certainly not now but the spiritual
[1:22:01] minded catches the word lines up with it
[1:22:06] and the spirit comes down under the shed
[1:22:08] blood and takes that person
[1:22:10] I want to be took I want to be cooked by
[1:22:13] God I want to be took by the world we've
[1:22:15] been taught by the world long enough I
[1:22:17] want to be took by God I want to read
[1:22:19] this one real quick because this is one
[1:22:20] of we read Wednesday night
[1:22:23] it was a paradox she was talking about
[1:22:24] the Hebrew children
[1:22:26] sometimes it looks like you know brother
[1:22:30] boy did
[1:22:31] we're heading toward the fiery furnace
[1:22:34] something in your life something that we
[1:22:36] have to overcome
[1:22:39] and we think man I'm gonna get burned up
[1:22:42] I'm gonna get burned up
[1:22:44] but let's talk about the three Hebrew
[1:22:46] children
[1:22:47] how that three men you know what they've
[1:22:50] done all they said was they didn't say I
[1:22:52] know the seals
[1:22:54] they said we're not bowing down to that
[1:22:57] image
[1:22:59] and you know what they said if we live
[1:23:01] we live if we die we die but we'll never
[1:23:04] bow down to that image we'll never bow
[1:23:07] down to that world and you know what
[1:23:09] there was there was a furnace right here
[1:23:11] that they they heated it seven times it
[1:23:13] was glowing
[1:23:15] and was so hot to when the people walked
[1:23:17] up to throw a man it killed them
[1:23:20] but what did it do to the three Hebrew
[1:23:22] children
[1:23:24] they didn't even smell smoke
[1:23:27] but what did it do they were bound
[1:23:31] they were bound
[1:23:33] you know they they never run away if
[1:23:35] they weren't bound
[1:23:37] they were going to give their life for
[1:23:39] what they believed in
[1:23:40] but they were bound and here they go
[1:23:43] they're headed into the fire furnace and
[1:23:45] all of a sudden brother Michael
[1:23:48] the bands are the only thing that got
[1:23:50] burned off
[1:23:54] what they thought was going to kill them
[1:23:58] the trouble in the trials we go through
[1:24:00] if you'll look at it that way hey I'm
[1:24:02] Bound by something when I get into that
[1:24:04] furnace I'm not even going to be touched
[1:24:06] by the smell of sin of this world but
[1:24:08] God is going to take these bonds and
[1:24:11] Bounds and he's just gonna
[1:24:13] ashes listen
[1:24:16] that's the only thing it did let's stand
[1:24:17] our feet that's the only thing it did
[1:24:19] see it delivered them from the bonds
[1:24:21] that they were bound with
[1:24:24] that was a paradox sometimes in their
[1:24:26] own life that Paradox repeats sometimes
[1:24:28] you're brought to a showdown where you
[1:24:30] have to make a decision you have to
[1:24:32] stand on that decision like they did and
[1:24:35] it look it all works together for the
[1:24:37] good what did it do it never hurt them
[1:24:39] it loosed them yeah
[1:24:42] sometimes we're caught in that position
[1:24:44] first thing you've got just like the man
[1:24:46] drowning in the river you got to get
[1:24:47] that man out of the river before you can
[1:24:49] get the river out of the man
[1:24:52] I like about that
[1:24:54] and that's something what a man has to
[1:24:56] do is come out and make his stand get
[1:25:00] the thing out
[1:25:01] and what I've been saying for a year and
[1:25:04] get him out of the thing so he can get
[1:25:06] the thing out of him
[1:25:08] then this afternoon we'll talk about
[1:25:10] we'll start talking about selfish we've
[1:25:12] got to be the most unselfish people to
[1:25:14] go up this statue of a perfect man
[1:25:16] because there's things going to be shed
[1:25:18] away from you that you don't want to
[1:25:19] lose
[1:25:23] in our Humanity
[1:25:25] we still want to have a little temper
[1:25:27] well patience with Joe can't no I gotta
[1:25:30] have no patience with him now he he's
[1:25:32] his problem
[1:25:34] see what I mean about selfish
[1:25:37] we can be so selfish till we make it
[1:25:39] everybody else's problem but our own and
[1:25:42] I'll read you some quotes for brother
[1:25:43] random and then we'll talk about in
[1:25:45] Timothy because he says right here for
[1:25:46] men shall be lovers of their own selves
[1:25:50] selfish lovers of their own selves
[1:25:52] Covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[1:25:54] disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
[1:25:57] let's sing a song God bless you we'll
