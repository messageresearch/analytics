[0:00] don't throw a book revelation that what
[0:03] you want to do that was the next thing
[0:05] that was suggested yes we need to all
[0:13] keep brother and sister Tatum Stella and
[0:18] and there was a tree phone or house
[0:20] there okay it broke the whole freshman
[0:24] up porch off the house when the tree
[0:27] fell yeah the brother duck said the tree
[0:29] didn't fall over the house it fell right
[0:31] down the side it just keeps me brave
[0:34] with all the rain that had he said they
[0:36] had no leaks inside the house so that's
[0:38] the grace for diving that rain we get a
[0:42] life yesterday you run out for you went
[0:43] out flower good to get it back up they
[0:46] went on a football on our came good
[0:52] doing that
[0:56] hi Eddie are young as you might with the
[0:59] congregation
[1:02] well until Joe go all right let's just
[1:09] remember that and keep people in the
[1:13] prayers or so some trying time for
[1:15] everybody we all we all know what we're
[1:20] headed toward but I think if we get
[1:23] fortified behind the word enough that
[1:26] all these other things will fall into
[1:27] place because somebody's gonna make
[1:29] somebody's gonna make it yes right so
[1:31] we're just gonna declare that we're the
[1:33] one who's gonna make it
[1:34] some yes here's Paul in Philippians rent
[1:38] Flint it's three we're gonna try to get
[1:39] finished today that's okay if by any
[1:42] means Paul's talking about now we
[1:43] stopped right here excuse me
[1:49] I'm warmer Paul is trying to tell the
[2:00] people yeah a good time our first our
[2:24] first fruit of the what you want to call
[2:28] youth youth revival or youth whatever
[2:31] you want to call it brothers i blacks
[2:32] being baptized this afternoon so yeah
[2:37] he's got a wonderful testimony to you
[2:39] and gave me a little bit of it yes be a
[2:46] big baptize years ago yes this is not
[2:50] the first one but that's okay he he'll
[2:52] tell you a second one let him tell it's
[2:54] by any means I may attain to the
[2:56] resurrection of the Dead then what we're
[2:58] talking about Paul is telling the people
[3:04] that there's a resurrection but now the
[3:09] people he's talking to remember don't
[3:12] have the Bible to reference back like we
[3:14] do to where Paul's saying that will
[3:16] resurrect is sitting in heavenly places
[3:18] in Christ Jesus
[3:19] not that see what Paul and brother
[3:22] branham makes this statement he says
[3:24] Paul is trying to get it out of people's
[3:26] mind that it's not the resurrection of
[3:28] the Dead there is not a resurrection in
[3:30] Paul's age the resurrection is in our
[3:34] age but he's prophesying are pointing
[3:37] forward to a resurrection time to where
[3:42] there is a resurrection of the dead but
[3:44] Paul obviously when he got struck down
[3:48] at going to Damascus the rivers going
[3:56] he was three days blind then and nice
[3:59] prayed for me and received the Holy
[4:00] Ghost so that was his resurrection the
[4:03] old Paul died Saul died and Paul
[4:05] resurrected that's what he's trying to
[4:06] tell people but if you were just
[4:08] listening to Paul preached today if I by
[4:12] any means I might attain them to the
[4:13] resurrection of the Dead Paul's
[4:15] preaching there's going to be a
[4:16] resurrection but then Paul tells in
[4:20] other places to put them together that
[4:22] it's resurrected sitting in heavenly
[4:23] places it's not going to be a
[4:25] resurrection now there were some people
[4:27] raised from the dead but he's talking
[4:29] about a resurrection of the dead for
[4:31] everybody all right not as though I had
[4:34] already attained either we're already
[4:37] perfect see we said I'm not perfect this
[4:40] is this resurrection is going to bring
[4:41] out people they're perfect there's going
[4:43] to be a perfect people on earth and
[4:45] there's going to be a perfect people
[4:46] it's going to be resurrected okay
[4:48] they're already perfect but I'll follow
[4:51] after in other words he's coming you'll
[4:54] be up in the resurrection no doubt of
[4:58] the bride not just a general
[5:01] resurrection the several resurrection
[5:04] I'd like to cover that maybe sometimes
[5:06] they stay committee resurrection but
[5:08] there's this one is you've already
[5:09] resurrected because the Bible says the
[5:11] dead in Christ shall rise first will you
[5:12] died in Christ you didn't die in Christ
[5:14] when we put you in the grave you die in
[5:19] Christ yesterday whenever you were born
[5:21] again when you died yeah you're already
[5:24] resurrected you're already sitting in
[5:25] heavenly places you can't die you just
[5:28] fall asleep as they did when they stoned
[5:30] Stephen instead he fell asleep there was
[5:31] others from the Bible did that fell
[5:33] asleep all right not as though I'd
[5:38] already obtained either
[5:39] we're already perfect but I follow after
[5:41] the word I'm coming after this if that I
[5:44] may apprehend that probably also I am
[5:46] apprehended of Christ Jesus now what's
[5:48] apprehending it means lay hold of that
[5:53] which also I'm apprehended are laying
[5:55] hold of Christ notice he got to hold the
[5:58] Christ and he was resurrected from the
[5:59] dead sitting in heavenly places when you
[6:02] put all the scriptures together
[6:03] resurrected stood in heavenly places
[6:05] where in Christ Jesus there is no
[6:07] resurrection outside of Jesus Christ
[6:09] none zero the devil can't resurrect
[6:12] anybody that's right
[6:13] guys got a resurrect brethren I count
[6:17] not myself to Apple to have attained to
[6:20] but this one thing I do forgetting those
[6:24] things which are behind and reaching
[6:25] forth unto those things which are before
[6:28] we're gonna talk about a little bit this
[6:30] afternoon about the zeal you got a zeal
[6:33] for God then that's the things that
[6:34] you're reaching forth and I like what
[6:36] brother Ron say it brother Brown said he
[6:38] said he said God I prayed that my wisdom
[6:45] will take hold of my zeal because you
[6:48] can be a zealot are zealous her people
[6:51] do things wrong a zealot just goes out
[6:54] blinded and do you know about no but the
[6:56] brother Brown said let then other words
[6:58] like the Holy Ghost take my zeal and
[7:00] keep it that's right
[7:01] you know because one without the other
[7:04] is not good yeah vanna zealot and the
[7:07] Bible was not good they went out kill
[7:09] people yeah can you read that again we
[7:16] all right brethren I count not myself to
[7:18] have apprehended what lay hold of what I
[7:21] resurrect he's not holding the record I
[7:23] am right then but this one thing I do is
[7:27] his point leave it right there but this
[7:31] one thing I do come up forgetting those
[7:34] things which are behind that's what -
[7:37] brother Nathaniel was talking about
[7:38] Sunday a lot of got a lot of positive a
[7:43] lot of positive reviews on that we're
[7:47] all under reviews you know me and June
[7:48] are going to spend a few days in Clayton
[7:50] and we'd just go through and say put in
[7:52] restaurants and what did the reviews say
[7:55] we never had those reviews we just had
[7:57] word of mouth but now you can read the
[7:58] reviews well that's what he was
[8:00] reviewing all the things that he needs
[8:03] not prohibited he has not apprehended
[8:05] the
[8:05] erection yet though he's waiting he does
[8:08] that for him the resurrection inside of
[8:10] it
[8:11] but he said this thing I'm going to do
[8:14] until that happens for getting those
[8:16] things which are behind and reaching
[8:19] forth unto those things which are before
[8:21] reaching before reaching forth unto
[8:29] those things which are before what if
[8:31] your evolution revelation upon
[8:34] Revelation look now look don't say
[8:37] that's not before your thinking before
[8:40] ya know looking for those which things
[8:44] which are before me in front of me I had
[8:48] okay so that clears it up a little bit
[8:50] there you got it now ya know not always
[8:54] things are before we look you thinking
[8:56] forward sometimes nots not looking back
[8:58] before it's looking that way all right
[9:00] so that's what he said that's when he's
[9:01] trying to have her hand he's looking to
[9:03] the things are before not the things
[9:04] that are behind because the public that
[9:06] things were behind he'd kill himself
[9:07] right he would be literally killed
[9:11] Christian people and now he's
[9:13] commissioned to preach to that same
[9:15] group of people and put him in a bride
[9:19] yeah and get them eternal life the thing
[9:22] he was persecuted was the thing that
[9:24] saved it so I don't think now I know
[9:31] Paul in his humanity
[9:33] I believe that slain went to Rome I
[9:35] believe he knew that his time was up he
[9:37] knew that he was gonna die he was done
[9:41] he had finished his race I'm telling you
[9:43] because he told us he said I finished my
[9:44] race I'm going to fight a crown of life
[9:47] is left for me but he I'm sure he was
[9:50] just like all of us the devil reminded
[9:53] him of when he did the Stephen and what
[9:57] he did to all the Christians causing
[9:59] them to blaspheme going into churches
[10:01] and just tearing them up put them in
[10:02] jail right right thank you but what did
[10:06] he do go on I press toward the mark
[10:10] there was a mark he was pressing toward
[10:13] our goal same thing for the prize of the
[10:17] high calling of God in Christ Jesus let
[10:21] us therefore as many as be perfect or
[10:25] what complete mature Paul was a very
[10:31] mature Christian because he had those
[10:33] people in Ephesus he had a very mature
[10:36] group to work with
[10:38] he saw the power of done and that's the
[10:41] same way what we're trying to do here in
[10:42] this church we're trying to bring even
[10:44] the young ones up to a level of maturity
[10:46] all of us come to a level of maturity so
[10:49] God can use us he can't use yunalesca
[10:51] maturity that's what I mean you can't
[10:53] give a baby a key to the car you can't
[10:56] tell the baby to go build a house but
[10:58] through maturity I was thinking the
[11:02] other day well yesterday all the people
[11:04] in just in this church not including
[11:07] another church's thing where God's put
[11:10] you know Joseph counted in lieu in
[11:14] brother Bob and all the ones who worked
[11:16] on computers they didn't know that was
[11:18] gonna they weren't going to this church
[11:19] when they were taking classes were you
[11:22] Joe might have been but I don't think so
[11:25] no he was not but God was grooming them
[11:29] to get a good-paying job but to be able
[11:32] to help us get the word out so same way
[11:37] with all of these you said well I'm just
[11:39] you're just what you're a copier child
[11:41] to God everything you do in touch and
[11:43] say it's for things of God he knows what
[11:46] you're gonna do you just gotta go do it
[11:49] he quit us in each situation to where he
[11:52] even maybe one person it's what me and
[11:54] Bob were talking about Wednesday night
[11:56] after service if that black is the only
[11:59] person that realized he was lost
[12:02] realized he wasn't doing things right
[12:04] because of what's been going on in them
[12:06] in the youth meetings we could stop
[12:09] today and be a success
[12:12] right but you stop today I'm be a
[12:14] successful but I don't want it look Paul
[12:16] said no words no what Paul same I could
[12:19] be a success I think if I just stop I've
[12:22] already apprehended I've already put
[12:24] Christ in my life and I'll preach the
[12:26] gospel because remember in Philippians
[12:28] he's heading toward the end of his time
[12:31] so he knows that he is what he has
[12:34] established churches he's done all
[12:35] things he needs to do Sammy with you and
[12:37] I what'd he do he said no I'm not going
[12:39] to retire and just go live and you know
[12:42] go to Tarsus where I was born a retired
[12:46] nurse at home no he was first 14 I press
[12:49] toward the mark that's right
[12:51] even though knowing that when he went to
[12:53] Rome he wasn't coming back he knew that
[12:56] he stayed in Rome for two years before
[12:58] they could have heaven so he could write
[13:01] the letters and what he could be a help
[13:04] to the people in Rome yeah I've always
[13:09] looked at this one thing you take Paul
[13:13] he went to Rome to talk to what Caesar
[13:16] you appeal to Caesar that he was a Roman
[13:18] he was at the back he was at the Roman
[13:21] city he was at the Vatican that that
[13:24] what no Vatican at that time but that
[13:25] was becoming the seat of Satan
[13:28] yeah don't worry brother branham do beat
[13:33] him being the Alpha messenger brother
[13:35] Graham being the Omega messenger the
[13:37] inside messenger where'd he go he went
[13:40] to Rome right could you imagine a
[13:43] prophet walking into that Vatican and
[13:45] looking and seeing him in another
[13:47] dimension but all in demons hanging in
[13:50] that building so he said he walked right
[13:54] up to the triple crown he said he looked
[13:55] at it just pre inch it from his head so
[13:57] it was in that little glass box so he
[13:59] toured the Vatican but he didn't get
[14:02] remember he was going to get a will that
[14:04] a bit something can you imagine them
[14:05] demons looking at and seeing them
[14:07] prophets like what I'm a because I found
[14:09] salmon they be looking down and handling
[14:10] you doing here not knowing what you're
[14:12] doing here yeah but could you imagine if
[14:15] you met the Pope but remember he wasn't
[14:18] gonna do that I'm sure he liked me
[14:20] because of he's not gonna honor calling
[14:22] brother Jake his ham but that wasn't
[14:24] gonna happen you got a kiss ring before
[14:25] you know anything but why did Paul do
[14:29] Paul kept pressing he stayed two years
[14:30] in Rome know anyone coming back home and
[14:33] why he kept writing letters he kept
[14:35] writing and a lady actually that's
[14:37] what's kind of strange
[14:38] they allowed I've been reading in in the
[14:42] book of items they allow Paul he was
[14:44] like on house arrest he wasn't in a
[14:46] prison he was like in a house and he had
[14:50] a guard with him and even even Festus or
[14:53] whoever plus said well I'll let him go
[14:54] in and out let me see people how people
[14:55] come in and out you know but they're
[14:58] getting ready to cut his head off so
[15:00] Paul knew that but he said I press
[15:02] toward the mark for the prize of the
[15:05] high calling of God in Christ Jesus
[15:07] each one of us had been on high calling
[15:08] each one of us should be able to now
[15:11] know what that calling is right because
[15:13] the Bible says make your wife calling
[15:16] and election sure right let us therefore
[15:21] as many as be perfect or what not or are
[15:24] grown up be thus minded in other words
[15:27] think just like this and if in anything
[15:29] you'd be otherwise minded God shall
[15:33] reveal even listen to you I mean
[15:37] somebody's talking the other day was
[15:38] talking about the Holy Ghost you know we
[15:40] you sometimes we don't come say that's
[15:46] right we don't use the Holy Ghost our
[15:49] advantage because he said I will lead to
[15:51] you and guide you and all truth now if
[15:55] there's not a truth there you already
[15:57] immediately know that's not the Holy Oh
[16:00] turn away don't entertain it okay like
[16:04] John entertained it only I hope ours
[16:06] will get into
[16:07] brother Brown city the Bible says he
[16:08] admired that church why she was a
[16:10] beautiful woman
[16:11] which was groaned that the the mother
[16:14] so all that stuff we might leave
[16:17] my hand on thanks look we'll talk about
[16:20] this later but I was telling them the
[16:24] involves talking about something and I
[16:26] said this place is kind of like
[16:28] assembling this long there's full of
[16:32] people right we got to learn to deal
[16:35] with coming in on sentient being in this
[16:38] submarine you know this round tube that
[16:40] we had we worship in so these things
[16:43] that we need to do to to help it so long
[16:48] as we realize that we're all sailors
[16:53] we're staying don't sing something
[16:56] brethren be followers together of me and
[16:59] mark them which walk as you have thus
[17:02] for an example arm example pattern now
[17:10] he's interpolating here remember
[17:11] question come in no exclamation point
[17:13] not exclamation point bread States for
[17:16] many walk of them might have told you
[17:18] often and now tell you even weeping that
[17:20] they are the enemies of the cross of
[17:22] Christ in other words they walk with us
[17:24] my brother Dale's preaching on anointed
[17:27] ones they walk with us but there's
[17:28] somewhere whose end is destruction whose
[17:33] God is their belly and whose glory is in
[17:38] their shame who mind earthly things
[17:40] money think about this other day you
[17:43] think of all the things that are going
[17:45] on you drop you can draw down to three
[17:46] things programs in money women in
[17:48] popularity
[17:49] now you say women well no it may not be
[17:51] adultery but you commit spiritual
[17:53] adultery and it be the same demon right
[17:56] yeah and then false doctrine is a is a
[18:00] commitment okay so Paul sees this whose
[18:05] end is destruction whose God is their
[18:06] belly and glory is in their shame who
[18:08] mind earthly things when our
[18:10] conversation is in heaven from whence
[18:13] also we look for the Savior the Lord
[18:15] Christ who shall change our vile body
[18:18] that it may be fashioned like unto his
[18:20] glorious body
[18:21] so come on said will have a body locked
[18:24] into this glorious body we're not going
[18:26] all like look like Jesus right think I
[18:28] look like you but it will be fashioned
[18:31] in a glorified condition like Jesus's
[18:34] body is right now in the glorified
[18:36] condition and then you're not gonna lose
[18:38] your you're gonna be who you are all
[18:40] right who should change our vile body
[18:43] that it may be fashioned like unto his
[18:44] glorious body according to the working
[18:46] whereby he is able even to subdue all
[18:49] things unto himself so in other words
[18:51] when Jesus Christ walked out of the tomb
[18:53] peace at all power to him there's been
[18:54] given unto me so he goes to the right
[18:55] hand of the Father what does he do to
[18:57] stay there
[18:57] fall asleep no he says the Holy Ghost
[19:02] done 14 in my name I'll send the Holy
[19:08] Ghost back and he'll lead you and guide
[19:09] you in all truth yes
[19:11] now listen we might get confused dad
[19:16] never come like this other day you may
[19:18] get confused
[19:19] do not go continue in confusion if you
[19:22] got the Holy Ghost that's right
[19:24] you cannot if you continue in confusion
[19:28] you need to listen to that Black's
[19:32] testimony and get baptized again receive
[19:35] the baptism the Holy Ghost called about
[19:39] listen the Holy Ghost is not confused we
[19:40] got it we got a God in this message he
[19:43] changes his mind every week we got a
[19:45] Holy Ghost that allows people did
[19:47] whatever they wanted well that's way it
[19:50] isn't the message we've just becoming a
[19:52] bunch of Catholics I don't say this I
[19:54] say what's happening out there they take
[19:56] every fault often in the world in and it
[19:58] ain't even
[19:59] I mean badness like they say the bad
[20:02] wouldn't do what long people in
[20:03] the message called the message today
[20:05] right the worshipping brother branham
[20:07] brother Bob sent me a link over Africa
[20:11] they got shrine over brother
[20:13] differently well they did the same thing
[20:19] Apollo they were ones they've done it to
[20:21] everybody it's all ketosis and all well
[20:24] it's not really Catholicism it's the
[20:25] devil working through that system that's
[20:29] why Jesus said in Revelation they're
[20:31] ready to go wins tonight
[20:32] these are the next leggings I hate you
[20:35] say God no hey VA does he said he hated
[20:38] that thing
[20:39] alright and that's what's been the
[20:41] Nicolaitans spirit in this message that
[20:43] took over but if we're fortified behind
[20:46] the word that's was thinking a couple
[20:48] days ago it were fortified behind the
[20:50] word it's not so easy for the devil to
[20:53] get to it but remember remember Eve
[20:55] relevant that Eve had to come out from
[20:57] behind the word to be to see I didn't
[21:03] talk to you theory until next time thank
[21:08] you very
[21:10] we're not going pro but you see what
[21:13] happened if we stay fortified behind the
[21:15] word just stay there that's what Paul's
[21:18] saying stand there be zealous yes dude
[21:21] do the first works does will read in
[21:24] Revelations where go back and do the
[21:26] first work
[21:27] you know it would be good for us to just
[21:28] sit one day and go back in and think
[21:31] about the first week or month or year
[21:33] that you got born again if you can't
[21:35] remember it you need to get born again
[21:37] then you can start over
[21:38] alright but if you can remember that how
[21:40] God led you through different things
[21:43] told you many times before he let he
[21:47] lead you through things and then all of
[21:48] a sudden if you just like Doc died or
[21:54] went on vacation okay what's he doing
[21:57] that for child train just like with with
[21:59] children and all that is it's good to
[22:01] nurture and love Ellie but now not

[22:07] tease somehow anyway but God forbid that
[22:11] that that you turn around look at this
[22:14] picture of this beautiful child but

[24:56] seal was open still silence in heaven so
[24:59] nobody knows what's going on you know
[25:03] they don't God can't reveal something to
[25:05] them like that
[25:06] yeah God only reveals to people that
[25:10] will receive the word and that our
[25:13] receptors of the word remember what's
[25:17] the what's the Holy Ghost if you can
[25:20] receive the message where your day not

[25:55] companions there not division I'm
[26:00] telling you a division is a reason we're
[26:02] not having a revival right we need to
[26:08] shut up and look up and look up what
[26:13] pops ain't forgetting the things that
[26:15] are in the past how are you going to
[26:16] change them you know what Paul would
[26:19] probably say Lord if you just let me go
[26:20] back and change two years of my life of
[26:24] when I persecuted those Christian and
[26:26] gods like no that was you yeah that's
[26:30] your testimony that's what you did so
[26:34] that you can now say that it wasn't God
[26:37] that did that and now you're bringing
[26:39] these people in my fellow young fella
[26:41] my fellow servants help those women
[26:44] what's labeled men the gospel with
[26:45] Clement also with others
[26:47] my fellow laborers whose name during the
[26:49] book of life way that great Paul knew
[26:52] whose name was in the book of life well
[26:55] if you're born again you named another
[26:57] life right rejoicing the hallway and
[27:00] again I say rejoice
[27:02] let your moderation be known to all man
[27:05] you were good in gentleness
[27:12] be known to all men the Lord is at hand
[27:15] be careful for nothing but in everything
[27:18] by prayer and supplication with
[27:22] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[27:24] known to God pray without ceasing and
[27:26] the peace of God which passes all
[27:29] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[27:31] minds hearts your soul and your mind
[27:37] through Christ Jesus finally brethren
[27:39] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[27:41] things are honest whatsoever things are
[27:44] just whatsoever things are pure
[27:45] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[27:47] things are of good report if there be
[27:50] any virtue or what our strength to this
[27:52] and if there be any praise think on
[27:55] these things that's where brother Dale
[27:57] gets that quote from he likes that think
[27:59] on these things notice what Paul good
[28:01] he's telling it stop for a minute think
[28:03] about it think about what's going on
[28:05] whatsoever things are true honest you
[28:08] need to check those off true and honest
[28:11] just pure lovely good report if there be
[28:16] any virtue let praise there can be
[28:19] industry being praise think on these
[28:21] things those things which he have both
[28:23] learned and received and heard seen in
[28:25] me dude Wow
[28:27] and the God of peace shall be with you
[28:30] but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly now
[28:33] that the last year care of me has
[28:35] flourished again worrying you were also
[28:37] careful but she lacked opportunity not
[28:39] that I speak in respect to long so they
[28:42] don't want anything but I've learned in
[28:44] whatsoever slain I am therefore be
[28:47] content can we say that no wait a minute
[28:52] there by the way you just said Paul said
[28:54] I press on to the mark of a college now
[28:57] he's telling us to be content what we're
[28:59] doing you got to get them you know to
[29:01] get the revelation to that be content
[29:04] with what you got but you better use
[29:06] what you've got for the glory of God
[29:07] it's to press on to the mark of the high
[29:09] calling I know both how to be abased and
[29:13] other words what is the base be lowly
[29:15] live humbly and I know how to about
[29:19] which is a little opposite live in
[29:21] prosperity he's done both everywhere and
[29:25] in all things I am instructed both to be
[29:27] full and to be hungry both to abound in
[29:31] to suffer need I think we'll save that
[29:36] last part let's go enjoy I want to try
[29:37] to make sure we get up at 10:15 every
