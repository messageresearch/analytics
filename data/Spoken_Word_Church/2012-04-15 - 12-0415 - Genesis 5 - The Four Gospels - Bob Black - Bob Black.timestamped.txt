[0:00] we all right yeah we
[0:04] are so brother R number four he said it
[0:08] was an Earthly number the number of
[0:09] Deliverance and ew Bullinger said about
[0:11] the same number it was the number of
[0:13] creation the four is the number of of
[0:16] incarnation the number of
[0:19] Deliverance it's it's kind of it can be
[0:22] a double witness of the because number
[0:24] two is a is a witness a confirmation a
[0:27] testimony and Tak it a number four is is
[0:30] 2 * 2 which is a double witness a double
[0:33] confirmation and also represents the
[0:35] Incarnation God manifested in flesh
[0:41] so you never know how long this is going
[0:43] to
[0:47] take so Matthew there's
[0:52] um there's four scriptures that talk
[0:55] about the branch and they classify U
[0:58] Christ in these four different ways lion
[1:00] ox man and eagle and I'll just read it
[1:03] Jeremiah 23:5 it talks about behold the
[1:05] days come sayith the Lord that I will
[1:07] rais unto David A righteous branch and a
[1:09] king shall reign and prosper and shall
[1:11] execute judgment and Justice in the
[1:13] earth and that's what Matthew's gospel
[1:15] is to present Jesus as the son of David
[1:18] the king of the Jews that will sit upon
[1:20] the
[1:22] throne so the first chapter opens with
[1:25] Christ Royal genealogy I'm I'm just kind
[1:28] of doing a summary of the the four
[1:30] gospels first and then we'll later we'll
[1:31] go through the genealogy and look at
[1:33] who's missing and who's included and why
[1:35] they're included and who is this meisd
[1:38] he said now we've had 2,000 years of
[1:40] teaching coming down through the Roman
[1:42] Catholic church after the apostles then
[1:44] we come down through the Roman Catholic
[1:46] the Greek and so forth on down to
[1:47] Luther's age and Wesley what more 900
[1:50] different organizations coming down they
[1:52] had all these ages teaching now he
[1:54] promised just before the end time would
[1:56] come that the picture of Sodom and
[1:58] Gomorrah would again as it was in the
[1:59] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[2:01] coming of the end time the son of man
[2:03] will reveal himself again let's see you
[2:06] see the Samaritan was actually from my
[2:08] last night's sermon was Hagar see a
[2:10] perverted type the Jew was Sarah was
[2:13] site but the Gentiles of Mary the Royal
[2:16] seed Abraham's Royal seed remember when
[2:20] uh God told G gave Abraham his promise
[2:22] he he showed him first the Sands of the
[2:24] sea and said your your your lineage your
[2:27] seed will be like the Sands of the sea
[2:29] natural then a few chapters over he said
[2:31] look up at the stars your your uh your
[2:34] seed will be like the stars of Heaven
[2:36] the seed spiritual we're uh the Jews of
[2:39] the seed natural and the gentille is a
[2:41] Mary the Royal seed the seed of the
[2:43] promise of Faith the faith seed that
[2:45] you're part of through Christ the second
[2:48] uh let's
[2:49] see in the second chapter of of uh
[2:52] Matthew talks about the wise men
[2:54] journeying from the East inquiring where
[2:55] is he that is born King of the Jews in
[2:58] chapters 5 to 7
[3:00] are The Sermon on the Mount which is the
[3:02] manifesto of the king he said You' heard
[3:05] in old times it said whoever if you
[3:08] commit adultery you know you'll be
[3:10] stoned but I'll say to you brought it up
[3:12] a level if you U even look upon a woman
[3:15] you commit adultery and he talked about
[3:17] the meek shall inherit the earth who's
[3:19] going to be inheriting the kingdom and
[3:21] he declared the manifesto of his new
[3:23] kingdom not a kingdom of the Earth but a
[3:25] kingdom
[3:27] above we know that the kingdom must be
[3:30] first in you and then one day we'll walk
[3:32] the actual streets of gold but that's
[3:35] that's the New Kingdom uh and it
[3:37] confused the Jews because they were
[3:38] looking for somebody that was going to
[3:39] come with a sword and riding on a big
[3:41] white horse and everything and ride
[3:43] through the streets and kill everybody
[3:44] even Peter you remember when uh they
[3:47] they came to take P Jesus to the cross
[3:49] and he took out his sword and whacked
[3:50] off the high priest son's ear right
[3:53] because they it was it was confusing to
[3:55] them that he would come in a way that
[3:57] they didn't expect but uh he was the
[4:00] king that they were looking for they
[4:01] just didn't expect the way that he
[4:04] came a higher order of the law of Moses
[4:07] blessed are the poor in spirit blessed
[4:09] are the
[4:10] meek in Christ is the mystery of God
[4:13] revealed 1963 Jesus went up to the
[4:15] mountain his first sermon Sermon on the
[4:17] Mount came back down with the
[4:18] Commandments you heard them say them of
[4:20] Old Times Thou shalt not commit adultery
[4:22] I say to you whoever look upon a woman
[4:24] to lust after her has committed adultery
[4:27] just uh a brief summary for the word
[4:30] fulfilled because Jesus came to fulfill
[4:34] that the promise of the that he was
[4:35] going to be the king of David the son of
[4:38] David the king he was going to fulfill
[4:41] all that law required the word fulfill
[4:43] occurs 15 times in Matthew and it
[4:46] contains more Old Testament quotations
[4:48] than all the other three and think about
[4:50] the last prophet to the Jews was Malachi
[4:53] so for 400 years after Malachi they were
[4:55] waiting for some for all of these
[4:57] promises to come to pass and all and
[4:58] then all of a sudden the First Gospel
[5:00] written was Matthew with all of these
[5:03] Old Testament quotations the word
[5:04] fulfilled showing that he fulfilled
[5:06] everything that the Old Testament
[5:09] promised the son of David occurs seven
[5:12] times think about the numbers seven it
[5:15] occur son of David occurs exactly seven
[5:17] times in Matthew and Jesus is referred
[5:19] to as King in Matthew 12 times isn't
[5:22] that amazing and in in
[5:26] Mark uh I'll just read Zechariah 38
[5:29] talking about the different
[5:30] manifestations of the branch the branch
[5:32] is Christ Zechariah 38 says here now oh
[5:35] Joshua the high priest thou and th
[5:37] fellows that sit before thee for they
[5:39] are men wondered at for behold I will
[5:41] bring forth my servant the branch and
[5:44] that's what Ma Mark is the whole subject
[5:48] of Mark is to present Christ as the ox
[5:51] the servant and that's why there is no
[5:53] genealogy in mark because a king has a
[5:56] genealogy in Matthew and in Luke a man
[5:59] has the son of man has a genealogy but
[6:02] in Mark a servant doesn't have a
[6:04] genealogy Christ is the servant of jehos
[6:07] in Philippians 26:7 who being in the
[6:10] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[6:12] equal with God but made himself of no
[6:14] reputation and took upon him the form of
[6:17] a servant that was made in the likeness
[6:19] of
[6:20] men so Mark presents him as a servant no
[6:24] genealogy recorded and Christ is
[6:26] introduced at the beginning of his
[6:28] public Ministry
[6:29] instead of talking about
[6:32] um her earlier periods in his life
[6:34] there's more miracles in Mark recorded
[6:37] than in any other gospel because Mark
[6:39] records him as the
[6:41] servant in
[6:43] Luke he's presented as the son of man in
[6:46] Zechariah 6:13 it says and speak unto
[6:48] him saying thus speaketh the Lord of
[6:50] hosts saying behold the man whose name
[6:52] is the branch and he shall grow up out
[6:54] of his place and he shall build the
[6:56] Temple of the Lord Christ is the son son
[6:59] of man which is God in flesh a prophet
[7:02] and God manifest God manifests himself
[7:04] in flesh as the son of man to show
[7:07] everyone else that you can partake of
[7:09] the things that I'm
[7:11] presenting that's why we were promised
[7:13] that God would return as the Son and the
[7:14] son of man Ministry in this last day to
[7:17] show us that we could partake of the
[7:18] same things that were presented to us
[7:20] through a
[7:21] prophet 1962 sir we would see Jesus uh
[7:25] the Holy Spirit moving in the church is
[7:27] what does the works that wasn't that
[7:28] body of FLH it probably v he's talking
[7:30] about melkisedek when he came to Abraham
[7:32] but it was God in that flesh showing
[7:34] that God would again dwell in the
[7:36] redeemed flesh of his church in the last
[7:38] days and would do the same sign 1964 sir
[7:41] we would see Jesus Jesus was God in
[7:43] flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight
[7:46] still God manifest himself in the last
[7:48] days the son of man revealing himself in
[7:50] his church the human flesh making
[7:52] himself known you get it
[7:54] see God down here in his church making
[7:56] himself again the word the son of man
[7:59] being being revealed in the last days
[8:00] and it was in the days of Sodom so in
[8:03] Luke we'll look at it more detail next
[8:05] time but gen the genealogy is traced all
[8:07] the way back to Adam not like in Matthew
[8:08] where it's traced from Abraham down but
[8:12] all the way back to Adam showing that
[8:14] he's the son of man in Luke uh Jesus is
[8:18] often seen frequently in prayer and the
[8:20] angels are seen ministering to him
[8:22] instead of in Matthew where he's
[8:24] presented as the king he's more often
[8:25] shown commanding the Angels but in Luke
[8:28] there ministering to him in John Isaiah
[8:32] 4:2 says in that day shall the branch of
[8:35] the Lord be beautiful and glorious and
[8:37] the fruit of the Earth shall be
[8:38] excellent and comely for them that are
[8:39] escaped of Israel Christ is revealed
[8:43] John the first three gospels they kind
[8:45] of they kind of uh present him in the
[8:47] same way then all of a sudden you get to
[8:49] John John is totally different it
[8:52] presents himself
[8:54] it's I I really like John because this
[8:56] is the eagle chapter the eagle book of
[8:59] the Bible John is presenting God Jesus
[9:02] says
[9:03] God Christ is revealed as the Son of God
[9:06] Supernatural walking among the
[9:07] candlesticks down through the seven
[9:09] Church ages U John 1:1 declares that
[9:12] Jesus is the creator of all things now
[9:15] uh if you look at Matthew Mark and Luke
[9:17] you might kind of get the idea that
[9:18] Jesus started at at his birth but when
[9:21] you look at John he's the one that was
[9:23] back there in the beginning creating
[9:25] he's he's the Eternal
[9:27] one um he declares who the comforter is
[9:31] none of the other gospels declare that
[9:33] Jesus is the comforter it it it uh it I
[9:38] guess you could say it's maybe one of
[9:40] the most confusing gospels because John
[9:42] 14:18 says I will not leave you
[9:44] comfortless I will come to you then John
[9:47] 14:26 says the father will send the
[9:49] comforter in my name he's sending in in
[9:52] Jesus name and John is the only gospel
[9:54] that declares whose name the comforter
[9:57] comes in and who it is is is coming to
[9:59] you Jesus John 15:26 Jesus will send the
[10:03] comforter from the Father John 16:7 says
[10:06] I will send him unto you John 16:25 says
[10:09] but the time cometh when I shall no more
[10:12] speak unto you in Proverbs but I shall
[10:14] show you plainly of the father I shall
[10:16] show you plainly of the father because
[10:19] it's Christ that's coming to the
[10:20] believer prayer and it's also the only
[10:23] gospel that says prayer should be in his
[10:25] name John John 16: 2627 at that day ye
[10:29] shall ask in my name and I say down unto
[10:31] you that I will pray the father for you
[10:34] for the father himself loveth you
[10:36] because ye have loved me and have
[10:38] believed that I came out from
[10:42] God so those are the four gospels to
[10:44] present Christ in four different
[10:48] ways as a lion ox man and eagle and
[10:54] um make sure that that's everything that
[10:57] I have
[11:01] I see it
[11:07] J
