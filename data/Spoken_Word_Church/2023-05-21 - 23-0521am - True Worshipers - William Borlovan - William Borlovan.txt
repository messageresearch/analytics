the news and it'll make you depressed and what they call a New York minute but we have so much to be thankful for we have so much to be happy about praise the Lord Jesus is so good to see each and every one of you and the house of the Lord this morning thank you musicians appreciate the worship service and setting the atmos atmosphere for the word and now we just open up our hearts and see what the Lord has for us amen we have such a wonderful time of Fellowship yesterday after the service we again like to thank each and every one of you and all of you that was working behind the scenes to make that happen the food was delicious the the fellowship was wonderful and we just really really appreciate it we love you all with all of our hearts and we like to thank brother Wade for having us up certainly an honor and privilege to be here and speak to to you appreciate the Sunday School lesson that brother Bob gave us this morning there's many things that he was speaking about that goes right in with what the Lord laid on our hearts this morning so we certainly appreciate it so wonderful to see the moving of the spirit because the Bride is a wonderful team is a body of Believers that all work together and we all because you know there's only one big one among us and that's the Lord Jesus Christ and God has called each one with different gifts and maybe your gift is to sit there and pull on the gift of God but yet you're there maybe feeling like a nobody but you're pulling on the gift of God and these brothers are preaching and you're pulling on the gift and you you're pulling ends up blessing somebody else so don't ever think that you're not needed or that you're not useful in the kingdom of God amen amen God bless each and every one of you if you will we'll just go right to the word this morning and if you'll turn with me to Saint John chapter 4 and verse 7 and as your turn and just want to again extend appreciation of brother waiting for the Liberty that he gives us when we come and Minister and just with the Lord lays Upon Our Hearts that's because of my sister he said so thank you thank you sister Monica for uh we're keeping a good reputation here and brother Bob he yeah he does good too where is brother Bob okay he's in oh I see him in the window God bless you brother Bob let's read in Saint John chapter 4 verse 7. there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me to drink his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew ask a drink of me which I am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knew was the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and we he would have given the Living Water the woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water are thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the whale and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whoso drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou as well said I have no husband for thou has had five and he whom thou now has is not thy husband now note here she had five she had five in the past she was with one now and Jesus was the seventh Jesus was the seventh and he was her completeness that's it in that said is thou truly the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh we shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know now what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and which is a conjunction in truth so you need both Amen to be a true worshiper you need both spirit and Truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen let's bow our heads before we are seated the gracious Heavenly Father how we thank you Lord Jesus for this opportunity Lord to come and look into your word the very eternal life Lord there's many things we could be doing but father we're happy to be in the house of the Lord there's nothing else that we would rather be doing than to come in your presence because Lord all the Natural Things of life that pull on us each and every day they're so temporal but Lord the things that we're dealing with now are of Eternal value we ask that you forgive us of our sins may you father move me out of the way use me Father the Lord as your microphone use your people father as hearers May the word go forth in Fertile ground may bring forth fruit for your kingdom we love you we give you all the praise honor and Glory we ask that you please be with all the sick and needy be with every request we pray in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord my wife and I were recently kind of going through the church age book together and we were reading this and it kind of just stuck out to us there in verse 23 where Jesus speaking said about the hour cometh and now is when true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth and Jesus said for the father seeketh such to worship him I've read this text many times and this is a very familiar text to each and every one of us the prophet took it many times before the prayer lines were come in but I thought it was astounding that Jesus said that the father the heavenly father is actually seeking people to worship Him in spirit and in truth we live in a day where where God in other words God is looking for true worshipers we're looking in in a day that's what's going on in the Middle East is you have the Palestinians and the Jews and the each it's all about worship the Jews want to see the temple you know go back up again so they can worship God according to the Old Testament and they have their own ideas on that and they see what Solomon had and they're trying to recreate it but the Palestinians or the Muslims want to keep the mosque of Omar there so is all the contention and all that hate Sinners all around worship what they think the worship should be in Psalm 29 2 the David speaking says give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name Worship the Lord in Beauty and Holiness the Lord is worthy of worship and that's my title this morning is true worshipers we don't want to just be worshipers because there's worshipers all across the world in their respective areas and time zones and things worshiping God but we don't want to just be worshipers we want to be true worshipers now worship and many times you know when you hear Worship the Lord many things can come to mind and many times speaking in tongues and dancing and shouting all that comes to mind and that is worship but it's not that's not all that worship is a lot of times worship is your Amen to the word you're worshiping God you go to work or you you go home and he said God touch me those brother Ryan testified on how somebody got touched and got healed of a stomach issue while the word was going forth or in church on Wednesday what was he doing he was worshiping the Lord he didn't have to shout it he didn't have to dance it but he yet he was worshiping the Lord by the testimony there's many ways to Worship the Lord sometimes you're pulling on the gift of God and worship the spirit of God comes down on you and you bow your head and you're worshiping the God and nobody knows it but you and God and yet the blessing of God the very the very Pillar of Fire could be hanging right over you ministering to you delivering you healing you but nobody knows it but you and God because you got your head bowed and your worship you're worshiping God so there's power and there's freedom and there's release and worship because God made us to worship because you know understand this as a prophet taught us the angels of heaven as powerful as they are they cannot worship God like you can he tells us that whenever we get on the other side and we're all singing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound the very angels of heaven with all the power brother Wade had brought out they never called for reinforcements them powerful angels will be circling the earth with their heads bowed because they in in reverence because they don't understand your song of Amazing Grace they don't understand that despite all the mistakes you make despite all your failures God still loves you despite what a stinker you are he still redeems you and you responded to that call so you've experienced Redemption so you can sing Amazing Grace like the angels of God cannot sing the very angel that Gabriel that appeared to Mary does not know Amazing Grace like you know it this morning brother Louise never lost he never experienced he uh the only thing see worship is a choice we can come to church and we can refuse to worship if we want but there's something when there's something truly on the inside I believe with all my heart that expression is a that worship is a side effect of the Holy Ghost because when the Holy Ghost is in there it can't help but verse forth brother Bob it can't help it the trees when the wind blows which is the type of the spirit the trees clap their hands and they blow and their Seasons as the flowers come up they don't have a choice God set that law in motion and it begins to happen but yet we as free moral ages we sit we're Souls we're redeemed and the Satan can come and make you in such a bad mood you know and if we don't come if you come to church in a bad mood you're in the right spot let's get rid of it because the Satan can come and Crown you with the bad spirit and you come in church in the very presence of God but we sit on our hands all right so we have a choice I don't feel like worshiping we'll worship anyway I make the choice to worship regardless of how I feel regardless of of maybe you know maybe I had a little tip with my spouse this morning on the way to church or maybe whatever happened I choose to worship and that is when God accepts your worship because again God set the laws of CR of creation and things in motion and they do it because of the law of God the son has no choice but to come up every morning but yet you made a conscience choice to come to church this morning you said I'm going to church and you're worshiping the Lord before he even got to church you're worshiping the Lord we should start getting our minds on the word getting our mind on the Lord that is why we should be in the world throughout the week not just from service to service because then we come to service and then God by the Holy Ghost will actually be in you'll feel like he was in your living room you talk about the Lord you read a text you have Bible devotions and the spirit confirms it in church and that is God's confirmation that he was behind that he dropped that in your heart God Amen so worship isn't about feeling like it it comes from within and remember we must have both the mechanics and the Dynamics there's people there's people in denominational churches that the the real we've been taught this the real genuine Holy Spirit falls down and they're giving worship to God and they're praising God if you were in there you could feel the Holy Ghost but they major on that or then after that the preacher gets up and preaches about a trinity or preaches about Luther's message or preaches some word of a day gone by you see they have the Dynamics and they can have healing and manifestations and speaking in tongues and they'd be right they have the Dynamics but they don't have the mechanics and if we're not careful we God has given us this message which is the mechanics the open book and if we're not careful we just come and not and then we we just it's just about the mechanics and we don't loosen up and allow the Dynamics to flow and make it a reality to us a reality to where the word that you hear preached then goes out there you water it with your praise and remember worship and when you read the scripture the order of it is that worship always went before the battle and it was to give the Army behind them they'd carry the ark the word went first and they would praise and they would worship and it was to give the troops behind them the courage to fight and here you can come and you can feel pretty good you come you feel the movement of the spirit you clap your hands maybe maybe a tear run down your eye down your cheek but then you go out in the world and you have to be you have to fight Devils but see here you worship God and and the worship doesn't stop when you leave here but years where you get the encouragement and you get the strength to go out and fight the greatest battle ever fought so the prophet teaches us that the mechanics and Dynamics like having money in the banks but not knowing how to write a check or writing a check but not having them knowing how to write a check and not having the money in the bank but the bride has got both the bride has that beautiful car that beautiful Cadillac all studded and and it's wiped down and clean but she's also got the gasoline in the tank and she knows how to move she knows how to move in the spirit the bride knows how to worship and she knows why she's worshiping because that's important too it's important to know why you're worshiping so if you can't find a reason to shout and praise the Lord and Worship the Lord then you need some Holy Ghost reign in your life we go through seasons and sometimes we can go through a period of drought where we just come to church even and we just can't feel the spirit maybe we feel like we can't get our prayers answered maybe we feel like your prayers ain't even getting over this ceiling but that doesn't mean we should stop but that means we need Holy Ghost Train within the stickiness of our carnal nature can unroll and it's actually a leaf but it takes the rain that is why there's some stickers in the desert because they don't get rain and they curl up and they have a sticky nature and people we can get a sticky nature when we don't allow the the reign of the spirit to fall and let our leaves open that's right and maybe give a little shade for somebody because we know that eternal life is living for others eternal life is not selfish the very Fountain of eternal life Jesus Christ himself lived only for others never himself he looked around in nature and he said he see you know you see birds going in their nest and you see foxes hiding their dance and he said the birds have nests the foxes have dens but the son of man don't even have a place to lay his head he didn't even have a place to call home right there's not a single homeless person in this church now the word worship because remember worship is in the soul of a man everybody worships just because your friends May hate Church they're oh they're still worshiping but they could be worshiping a sports star they could be worshiping a movie star they could they could be worshiping money anything right so the word worship is a feeling or expression of reverence and adoration for a deity the worship of God another definition is to treat someone or something with a reverence and adoration that's appropriate to a deity so something that belongs to God but you give it to something else you're worshiping it you don't have to pray to it you don't have to lay pressure you don't have to pay tithes to it yet if we're not careful because remember the prophet taught us anything between us and God is an idol and an idol was tied to worship now let now let's think of how powerful worship is in the beginning aren't you thankful for a prophet that could take you by the way but even before the beginning before he he'd make a statement before God was God who can say that who can say before God was even God but before God was even God he said he was Elohim he was self-existent we can't wrap our minds around that we can't imagine it but I want us to notice because the prophet teaches us that the very first thing that God created was cherubims and angels and they begin to what worship Elohim so brother Bob worship is so powerful that it transitioned God as we call him to go from Elohim to God he didn't change in who he was he didn't change his power what changed worship when the angels and the cherubims begin to worship him he then was he didn't transition from Elohim to God because God is an object of worship and there was something there to worship Him Brothers said there was nothing there to worship him he was self-existent he was by himself but when they begin to worship him he then became God because there was something there to worship Him now let's expose the enemy a little bit before we go on because the enemy hates to be exposed so let's expose the enemy now before time because we know that time started When sin started so before Garden of Eden let's say because even during the Garden of Eden they were in a sense of Eternity until sin entered in before this time there was a conflict because remember where did the war start it started in heaven not on the earth and there was a conflict between God and Satan brother man preaches that sermon the conflict between God and Satan and that conflict and that war started in heaven what was the conflict over worship Lucifer was God's right-hand man brother Ram says the right-hand man of almighty God was Lucifer think about that he was his right-hand man all the archangels all the angels all the cherubims Lucifer was his his angel his right hand angel that he would depend on to lead the worship in heaven Heaven is a wonderful place angels are LED in worship and they Worship the Lord it's wonderful so here you had Lucifer that was a worship leader he was brother and said he was the right hand of almighty God was Lucifer the son of the morning the first God granted him almost co-workers with him think about that almost co-workers with him right he was a co-worker partly equal with him only Satan could not create so so so Satan so Lucifer at that time before he became Satan was a very powerful Angel the Bible tells us how he can transform himself as an angel of life he was a very powerful Angel but he wasn't he could not create and no doubt in heaven brother Bob was was teaching this morning on the on jealousy between Cain and Abel and no doubt as as Lucifer as as he was leading in worship and all the angels and he himself was worshiping God no doubt there came a moment in his heart where he began to say I want this worship why is all this worship going to him so Satan begin to desire and lust for worship and he began as a worship leader in heaven think about this it's not even fathomable but he began to get jealous of God he began to get jealous that God was getting all the worship and he wanted the worship so his plan from the very beginning was to get worship and get it away from God now notice in Isaiah 14 the mind of God through the prophet picks up runs all the way before time and he says how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down from the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart here the spirit of God is going right into the heart of Lucifer of what Lucifer was saying in his heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high but yet look at God bring him down to reality in verse 15. yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit that they that see thee narrowly that they see excuse me they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms yeah Satan is just a flick that's right remember in the scriptures whenever that that Jesus gives a parable about the great Shepherd how how brother him dramatizes how he gets the the lost sheep and he puts him over the shoulders and he carries him back that's the strongest part of a man but yet when he casts out a devil he did it with the finger yeah Satan is nobody he likes to make us think that he's like he's some big bad and and you know and he's terrible and we can't fight him within ourselves but through the blood of Jesus he's conquered he's defeated and the only weapon he's got against us is a bluff if he can get you to believe it he's got you [Applause] hi buddy amen amen so see if God can only he's there was her brother and say just the other day he said all the power of God is only limited by your faith all the power that's it so Satan is nothing but a bluff he's defeated but if he can get you to think that he's not defeated and that he does and he can do this that or the other then he's got something on him all right amen okay now he says but he was the devil was kicked out of heaven and the Very purpose that he tried a purpose in heaven he came right down here on Earth and is trying his best to fulfill any purpose so as brother Bob again was teaching this morning Satan got jealous in heaven and he got kicked down he got into the serpent deceived Eve got into Cain and he immediately see the same jealousy in Cain at the altar of worship just like he's seen in his daddy Lucifer in heaven it was a reflection from back in eternity now it's injected into time same devil same jealous devil what is it Desiring worship that's what that's why Abel Abel was not killed because he worked harder than Abel or I'm sorry Abel was not killed because he worked harder than Kane because he had more money than Kane it was over worship because his Revelation and approach to God that's what cost Abel his life amen now throughout the entire Old Testament we're still exposing the enemy here he was always tripping up Israel Over worship they came through the Red Sea they just seen them ten plagues on Egypt deliver with a mighty hand Moses goes up in the mountain to receive the word of the Lord 40 days they can't even stay pure they've already a molten calf already worshiped worship worship who inspired them to do that the devil why because he knew that he could get God angry you see he knows that God is subject to his own words so if he can get God angry then God has got to be subject to his own word and it angered God so Satan got in there and had them make this golden calf and say this is actually what brought you out of Egypt through Balaam he did the same thing God required Israel to go up to Jerusalem and worship to bring their Passover in the Old Testament in first king 12 you have two kings one was I believe Solomon Sonia jeroboam and he had another one rare bone I believe if I'm pronouncing that right but there were both Kings they were both fighting for the throne so jeroboam he looked and he was wanting the throne and he said you know if all these people start going up to Jerusalem to worship like God said their heart is going to be turned to my enemy and they're going to make him King so I've got to do something here so the Satan inspired him to actually build up idols and altars so that on the way to Jerusalem he can trip them up and have them worship there to keep the Israel from crowning his enemy King well Rita and jeroboam built shechem and Mount Ephraim and dwelt there first Kings 12 25. and went out from Vince embed and built pineal and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the House of David if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even into revoam king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam King of Judah whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold see it was a weakness in Israel it was the same thing of what their fathers fell and Mount Sinai right there and okay so he sent me two calves of gold and said unto them is it too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods o Israel which has brought the up out of the land of Egypt and he said the one in Bethel and the other put he in damn Satan will try and do the same thing in your life you don't have to go to church you don't have to do this you know here this is happiness then people don't love you here take this and you see this and see this is again Satan tripping Israel up because Satan knew that God is subject to his own word so what does the prophet teach us that Dan and Ephraim where bows were removed when you read in the Book of Revelations their names are missing it was over this sin right here that I just read it was over worship now we know they'll be restored in the Millennium but from under Heaven their names have been removed their tribes have lost their identity because of false worship because they refuse to worship in spirit and in truth the Hebrew children were cast into a fir into the fiery furnace over worship it wasn't because they didn't pay their taxes it wasn't because they killed somebody it was because they refused to worship something else other than the god of the god of Heaven so as I said since before time Satan's always been listened for worship and in this evil age that we're living in he finally gets his way for a short amount of time he gets his way fighting for it from Before Time and in this day we're living in he gets it in second Thessalonians chapter 2 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there cometh Falling Away first and that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worship so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God that's right do you see everything that Satan had he wasn't Lucifer had he was not happy with he wanted worship he wanted to be the God he wanted to be God and so God allows him to be the God of this evil age and Brethren brings that sermon out it exalts he said and when the church world would not have the word of God rule over them they accepted a murder of Barabbas what did this do it exalted Satan so see when they accepted Barabbas just the fact that they sister Zoe accepted Barabbas that automatically exalted Satan you don't have to make two choices they didn't have to you know exalt Satan in one way necessarily and then receive Barabbas they did one and automatically did the other so when you refuse the word and you don't let the word take the preeminence in your life you're then exalting the world and then you're opening the door for Satan to have access to your life this word is protection the the blood is protection amen just like it was for Eve God don't change if it was her protection and it was Adam's protection then it's your protection so when somebody gets from that is why when people leave the message they open themselves wide open to Satan they never become a better person they never become a better person because this word is the truth and they do just like what Eve did so when Eve got out of the protection of the word that opened her wide open to Satan amen if it did it then it does it now Revelation 13 we know that Satan comes down and he forces worship he literally incarnates the Beast the false prophet becomes the Beast and what does he Force worship and if people and this is after we go home that is why now is the checking up time now's the time to trim your lamps fill them up with oil if you've got oil more oil more oil more oil you've got to be overflowing you don't want to you don't want to just barely make it and have the door just hit you no barely made it in you want to be able to go in with flying colors and not your flying colors but the flying colors of the of the cross the Lord Jesus Christ that's the only way to get in there Hallelujah [Applause] so that is how to get in now is the time because what happens after the bride goes home the Beast will then Force worship and it's the same spirit that was in Nebuchadnezzar because if they they refuse to worship they're going to have to give their lives that's right if they are to preserve the names of The Book of Life they have to give their lives it's a serious hour many times we can come to church and you hear sermons you hear sermons and it just gets to be so mundane brother Wayne I were talking about Noah's sermon 120 years the same sermon but one day that God shut the door God shut the door so we we see that Satan when he came when Jesus was on the earth the fullness of the godhead bodily and Satan's still coming to him last night we read the quote Satan came to the prophet so if he came to God himself he came to the prophet messenger he's going to come to every single one of us so when Satan came to Jesus in the hour of Temptation when Jesus had not eaten he was fasting for 40 days he was at a very weak point and Satan comes and he begins to tempt him Satan had three shots at Jesus and he had to make every one of them count he had three shots and one of those shots in Matthew 4 9 and saith unto him all these things he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment's time he showed him every civilization if you love history in their Glory day including America that we live in showed it to him in a moment of time and he said all these things will I give thee if that will fall down and worship me all of that everything that Satan had and everything that he built up by the way up until that time he was willing to give it away for one moment for Jesus to worship him can you imagine how bad Satan wants worshiped why does he want worship so bad because he wants to be like God then saith Jesus unto him get thee hints Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve it was a Temptation for Jesus to get the world which he's going to fall heir to but he he's going to fall heir to because he paid for it so the Temptation was that he get all of that without paying the price Naturally Speaking imagine how tempting you'd be to say brother I will give you this Corvette right here you don't even have to pay for it it'd be a tempting proposition not pay for it or you're gonna have to work for it for years and years and years and years so Jesus was offered but do you know it would not I can imagine during that very moment he thought of you he could have all the world he could have it all but what good would that do because then he would be like he was back at the beginning what would have been the point of all that to have all the world he already had the world he created everything he had every he had the Angels they were worshiping him everything was perfect but he wasn't satisfied because he didn't have you sister June he wasn't satisfied and then whenever he still wasn't satisfied because under the fall you fell so he had to come and he had to pay the price not half price yeah you weren't on sale you weren't on clearance you come at a very high cost and he paid full price for you in the scriptures we find that there's a story about lepersy was a because of the times they lived in it was very you know dirty living in some ways and they just leprosy was very common and still isn't in very very poor countries and in Luke 17 and it came to pass 17 verse 11 and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he entered into a certain Village there met him 10 men that were leopards which stood afar off you talk about social distancing they had to stay away so we know that leprosy is a type of sin it starts just as a sore and then it begins to spread and it just keeps eating away and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said go show yourselves into the priest and it came to pass as they went they were cleansed see they took action upon the word what if you just said go your way and said well I'm not healed yet as they begin to act upon the word they were cleansed now watch in verse 15 and one of them There Were Ten one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God ten percent and fell down at his face at his feet and fell down on his face at his feet and giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan just like the woman at the well a degraded a segregated group of people that nobody wanted the Jews couldn't stand Jesus answering and saying where they're not ten cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that return to give God to give glory to God save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole how many times does God do something for us and we don't even thank him how many times is God heal us and we don't tell nobody about it see it's worship God does something for you God gave you the Holy Ghost tell somebody God did something for you in the service tell somebody because then that gives them faith that spreads it's like wildfire if you're not called to preach tell how your fire got lit tell how your candle got lit so out of ten lepers only one had I had to have the decency or had the appreciation to come back and say thank you Lord if he cleansed your life from sin every servant should be thank you Jesus when we see how the world is acting and how they're dressing and how degraded they are it should be thank you Lord that could have been me because remember in your flesh we're no better than they are the only thing that separates us from them is this the blood of Jesus that's cleansed us amen so God help us to always be thankful amen and to always return and give worship not just once the next week and give worship the next time give worship when you're in your prayer closet give worship and not only give worship now hear this not only give worship after you get something but give worship before you see it that is where the true Victory and even the faith is give worship when you don't see it whenever once you receive it it's yours brother Bob once you receive it it's yours you then you start giving thanks water it with worship whatever it thinks if you plant a seed best ground in the world most fertile ground in the world doesn't matter if it doesn't get moisture your art could be just as open as it can ever be you can just receive the word as it comes a fourth but if you go out and you don't water it water it with praise with faith with Thanksgiving how are you going to ever be very fruitful so let's not be the 90 that never came back to return and give God thanks we don't see our prodigals come home thank God for me anyway thank God for their return ahead of time and when they do return praise the Lord and when they do return we have to be like like the like the prodigal like the father he didn't start just scolding what took you so long you spent all your inheritance and you went all the way down there in the enemy's country and you were around pigs and all them things with open arms he was there is nothing more powerful than love not judgment love because without the love of God none of us would be here now all in wine is very important together and we understand the oil represents the spirit and wine represents Revelation in the fourth seal and the quote Brotherhood says now as oil symbolize the Holy Spirit then we find that the oil and wine is connected in worship see always connected in worship amen we find that when you read the Old Testament that Aaron and the priest and the Levites before they would actually go to worship and enter to the Tabernacle they have to be Anointed with oil and dress riding and do things but it was always with oil David picks it up and it talks about how the anointing oil fell down Aaron's beard went all the way down to the Hem of His garments in Psalm 92 10 David said in my horn shalt thou exalt like the Horn of a unicorn I shall be Anointed with fresh oil that's what every service that's what every time in his presence should do for us is fresh oil I've had oh Lord I've had all my and you know in my lamp for 50 years or praise the Lord but how about fresh oil how about a fresh anointing because the enemy is always coming up with fresh attacks by the way he always finds fresh ways to come and attack you so why not get fresh oil and get anointed with fresh oil in Saint John 12 there's that ill-fained woman that prostitute that took oil when she came to worship Jesus when he was invited by Simon the Pharisee and you know he was sitting there in a corner unwelcome the unwelcomed Christ but yet she came and seen that he had a need and she brought oil and remember Simon the Pharisee sent out that invitation and brother and dramatizes it beautifully in the assignment the Pharisee brought Jesus there to be kind of a joke and just so people can can see him and things and it was a half-hearted invitation he didn't really want Jesus there right and he thought that Jesus came because of his invitation but Jesus came for this prostitute Jesus knew she was coming amen when the servant didn't wash Jesus's feet he knew he was right on track he didn't go wash his own feet he wasn't worried about it he knew that God had predestinated that God had showed him that there was a woman that was going to come and that's why he didn't move right he let her pour the oil he let her experience the type of the birth right there and get messy so Jesus came for her not for Simon that Pharisee when the Mary of Bethany took all in her Alabaster Box and broke it and poured it upon his head it was oil when she came to worship the master now in the Old Testament there was a story about the Widow of zarepath Brethren preaches sermons like be certain of God or Elijah in the meal offering and all these things and she was a widow woman and she typed the Bride of Jesus Christ he preaches spiritual food in due season amen and God sent her God sent Elijah to her he said Brotherhood said because she had the same nature that Elijah had you know later in the message brother Ram says that God makes his Messengers with a certain personality in a certain way to fit the people and the people to you know God has his way in everything so in First Kings chapter 17 we'll read here in verse 8. and the word of the Lord came unto him about Elijah saying arise get thee to zeropath which belongeth to Zina zaidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to zarapath and when he came to the gate of the city Behold a widow woman was there get their Gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink let me stop there and say that that drink of water he was asking for was a lot no rain for three and a half years and he comes a stranger asking a widow woman for a drink he was already asking a lot so because she had the same nature Elijah had she said I'll go do it and then she was going to fetch it he called to her he called her again and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand that was the last two things she owned was the water and the morsel of bread no doubt when she turned to go get Elijah that water she thought at least I still have that cake at least you know maybe we can at least survive a few more days on the cake but then God asked even more of her right Amanda and said bring me a morsel of bread in thy hand and she said she was honest as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die this was life and death this wasn't just going to a church service and going home and going about our day and going about our week this was life and death it came to the wire it's where the rubber meets the road however you want to say it it came down to reality she was in the hardest trial of her life her husband brother him teaches a spot in the military gave his life for Israel and here she was not understanding why she was going through this raising her son by herself in the middle of the worst drought known to mankind three and a half years of no rain it was not her fault there was no rain it was ahab's fault in Israel's fault she was a believer it's not your fault of the judgments that's on that's on This Nation God has made a way of Escape God has made a way of Escape for her and how he sent Elijah to her she was in the hardest trial of her life and her and her own son's literal life was at stake but she took the oil of the Spirit Worship and she mixed it with the meal which is the word spirit and Truth she mixed them both together the meal alone would have just been dry wouldn't have done anything the oil alone could not have made the cake but you put the two together and you got a cake on your hands she mixed it because remember the meal is a type of the word every bird has to be the same we've heard the prophet talk about this many times to make a cake offering for a prophet she was exhausted she was discouraged the prophet picks that up where she's praying God I don't know why I'm going through this my husband he was such a faithful servant of yours and you of yours and you took him home and here I am with the starving sun on my hands she was discouraged and weak but she still used the last bit of her energy she had to do God of service in verse 13 and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou I said but make me thereof a little cake first that's an interesting word that she no doubt caught because if she said if he said first this has got to be a second he didn't just say go bake me a cake first then good luck yeah yeah you're on your own he said bake me a cake first but she only had enough for one so how can there only be a first when there's one you can't have a first let there be in a second if you're the only one running a race and you cross the finish line you're in first place but you're also in last place yeah there's nothing in between but if there's three people four people five people and there's the first place and if there's a first place there's a second and the third and so on so he said bake me a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son how am I going to make a cake after for me and my son when this is the last thing I've got she had to exercise some faith and now here comes thus saith the Lord for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the crews of oil fail until the day that the Lord sinneth rain upon the Earth the Holy Ghost will not run out the blessings of God will not run out for your life the word the Revelation that God has and he's sustaining you during this drought will never run out because you use your time and your energy to worship God well she had to believe the prophet's message because once the cake was made she couldn't take it back once she made it and gave it to him she had to have faith in what he said that there was going to be more so after he ate it she could go to the barrel and open it and there was meal she can run over to the cruise and there was oil why because she baked him a cake first she sought the kingdom of God first she mixed the oil with the word she mixed worship together in the message be certain of God he said she got the meal Christ Christ is a word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and wrote Among Us the word and the oil the oil represents the Holy Spirit she took the Holy Spirit the word and the truth Jesus said the time's coming to the woman at the well that God will honor those who worship Him in spirit and in truth many people worship in spirit and not in truth many in truth and not in spirit he says but when you get them together then you've got something when the spirit of God gets mixed into the word because remember the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so if you want the letter to have life in our lives we have to mix it with the spirit but when you get them together then you've got something the spirit of God gets into the word she mix it together and when you get the spirit of God on you mix with the word something's going to happen in another place he says but you take put them both correctly in their place there's a cake on the road there's something in the making you put them both together this morning in this service and you've got a cake on the road amen now notice whenever Elijah was at the brook God told Elijah I have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee now God told Elijah I've commanded her now it's not a command like you like you just whip somebody and make them do something but it's you know I looked it up it's like he charged her he commissioned her to do it but she had no idea here she was thinking the last meal I'm getting ready and God had already commanded her and she had no idea God told the prophet go here and I commanded that widow woman to sustain thee one cake one meal is not sustenance is repeated because remember the Bible said that he and she in their house ate many days so whenever he told her I commanded the widow woman to Phoebe she had didn't know it but God knew what she would do God might have commanded you God has commanded you to be a prayer Warrior he's commanded you to be the manifestation of the word remember it's not a just a whipping you've got to do this some abusive God is a god of love but he's charged you he's called you to it yeah you may not feel like it this morning you may have a heart for the thing of the world but yet you're elect so God is going to bring you around to this you may not realize that you are commissioned you may still be the prodigal son you may still be the prodigal daughter and not realize that is God calling out to you to take he God has commanded us to take a body change he's commanded that of the bride all along and she might not have realized it but now we've come into the realization that we are the final voice of the final age under our messenger you may not feel Worthy but it doesn't matter what you feel is what's been spoken of you the widow woman didn't feel worthy to house Elijah but God had already commanded it in the united on one head United under one head brother Ram said you might be filled with Elvis Presley's rock and roll that's true but you're filled with something in your own life Bears you record of what you're filled with buy their fruits you shall knows them you're filled with something you might be filled with a bunch of laziness just too lazy to do anything about it well you don't he said well you don't have to be that way Christ died that you might be cleansed from all those things he said God made a place in there to put himself in God wants you to be filled with himself what takes place when you're filled with God when you're filled with God you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're filled with power you're filled with love with joy with peace with long suffering with goodness with meekness with gentleness with worship you're filled with joy David said my cup runneth over you think and all of our cups are running over if you're a Believer your cup is running over but Satan can make you think that you're not that you know I don't have this oh if I could only be like this oh if I could only do this and here there you are with your cup running over David always had trouble in his life but then he he looked and said my cup runeth over I'm so blessed that my cup runneth over it and he said all that without the Holy Ghost and I didn't realize Brotherhood said here and if David had a cup running over before the Holy Ghost come what would it be now here because remember true worship is not put on and hyped up what we do is begin to meditate on God's goodness on our way to church we should begin to talk about God we should begin to think about God and what does that do it begins to take our minds off the things of the world and the natural things that we have to do and we begin to put our mind in a mind frame to come and we hear from God and many times God can confirm what you are talking about in the car 10 minutes before you got here right here in the service but we meditate upon God's goodness and as we meditate he says so when the spirit of God is near what will take place salvation will be introduced salvation that will bring a spiritual worship not a singing of hymns altogether but a worship in the spirit so as an example the song again I mentioned yesterday but way maker Miracle Worker promise keeper light in the darkness as that song Goes Forth begin to meditate how he made a way in your life and then it's not just a song that you just sing along with a song leader you then realize God you made a way for me and then what does that do it makes you lift your hands and worship and say thank you Lord thank you Lord for making a way for me in that situation Miracle Worker you think my goodness God healed me God saved my loved one God saved my parents he saved my children that was a miracle I couldn't see how that could happen but God you did it you're a miracle worker what does that make you do it makes you worship thank you Lord for being a miracle worker because then you worship him for being a miracle worker in your life it's you know someone gets up and testifies and we praise the Lord because we give him all the praise honor and Glory but whenever it's something in your life that he's done that's something altogether different it's more personal worship then when he kept when he's PR he's a promise keeper think of all the promises he's kept in your life when he's kept you when you couldn't keep yourself you then begin to worship him and you thank him for it God likes to be worshiped he likes to be he likes to be thanked and appreciated when you do things for somebody and they don't they don't act like they appreciate it very much it just kind of it makes you a little bummed doesn't it but whenever someone appreciates what you did thank you I appreciate that so how much more to God he said God likes to be worshiping when you worship him his brother him says in the power of transformation it just isn't exactly singing a song as we do but singing in the spirit of worship you see then you feel the Holy Spirit bounce back so when the spirit has fallen we worship him in the spirit he's a living God it's not like the idol just they the the pagans they prostrate themselves and they worship but not on the idol never talks back that it's never nothing God will talk back to you you feel the spirit bouncing back to you amen and many times that expression may be a shout maybe that expression will be nothing it'll just be silent crying what is that the spirit then begins to move and is brooding over you because you got out of your comfort zone because you chose to worship Him don't allow the enemy to make you crusty in your experience and so dry that you can't think of a reason a good reason to worship God if you're breathing you've got a reason to worship God because Satan will give you will give you spiritual Amnesia if you're not careful and when Satan comes and tries to bring up your past remind them of his future he brings up your past we'll say well use that as a reason to Worship the Lord when Satan tries to remind you of what you used to be and what you used to do was say well that's under the blood but since you reminded me thank you Lord I'm not that anymore you see how you turn that back around on him he reminds you of it and you take that as an example to put your finger in his eye and Worship the Lord [Music] because he reminded you that God delivered you from that while he's trying to make you feel bad about it turn it back on Satan you know you think the wise man traveled for two years to worship baby Jesus two years for a church service Queen of Sheba for three months on the back of a camel in the desert to hear the wisdom of Solomon in the Book of Revelations and we'll try and bring this to a close but in the Book of Revelations when Jesus Christ takes the book The Lamb the only one that was Worthy he takes the book let's read that in Revelations 5 8. and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb you see the effect that the opening of the word has it doesn't make it should never make us arrogant or puffed up or prideful the opening of the word makes us realize and brings humility right and it immediately brings about worship amen having every one of them hearts and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sang a new song a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to our God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and is made unto us our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand and thousands of thousands that's an innumerable amount of people and and because of the effect of the open book it leads them sane with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing worship worship worship worship because the opening of the word the instantaneous brother Louise the instantaneous reaction to the opening of the word was worship thank you Lord not cut somebody down with Doctrine not beat people over the head worship [Music] now listen he said here in Revelation chapter five brother I'm speaking now this is the time when everything must be worshiped he's breaking down the Book of Revelation here now remember how appropriate don't let us miss this now listen close when all the mysteries of the church age was finished when all the mysteries of the plans of redemption them Seven Seals was open right immediately after this now look it's time everything in heaven and everything on Earth to worship God now watch what takes place and they sung a new song saying thou worthy listen what a worship that was the elders the Beast everything fell right before him see like that when he made his complete plan so when the word opens it immediately brings us to worship because we see we can't be deceived amen we see what Satan did we see we're not going to fall like Eve did we're predestinated not to fall we're going to take a body change we're going to come back and Rule and reign with him for a thousand years we're going to sit in judgment with him why because the book is open amen the church age is not did not realize that but now that the opening of the word has come we realize that and what does it make us do worship Worship the Lord because after there in the Book of Revelation in verse 13 it now becomes John's turn hey John is seeing the Lamb come and take the book he's seeing all this worship going on and John can't say still so the prophet picks us up and he says in every creature which is in heaven and in the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying they heard John it was his time to worship he appreciated watching the Beast he appreciated watching the elders he appreciated watching all the angels of heaven worship but John wanted in on that worship just like when they're on a testimony on the sea the disciples to turn but they were they were itching they were wanting they were wanting to testify when's it going to be my turn Andrew sit down so because I I'm Peter and I've got something to say yeah yeah John wanted to turn to worship when we get on the other side it ain't gonna matter we get in his presence and we're going to worship him for 10 000 years a piece it's not going to be like you go to an amusement parking man this line is taking forever no you go in the drive-through Lane try and get a bite to eat and the drive-thru Lane is so long and you get impatient there's not gonna be any impatience there there's not gonna be any jealousy there man that that brother's taking forever what's taking so long I want to get to Jesus that's not going to exist there because when I get there I'm gonna take my time and when you get there I want you to take your time because it's not it's going to be all about worship during the Millennium it's gonna be all about worship we're gonna see what he did he's he's standing there lighting the whole city with his presence and it'll be worshiped when the prophet of God said whenever you see a log cabin and you hear somebody sing Amazing Grace he's not going to be on the front porch preaching he's already done that Amazing Grace is something we'll always sing all of our past and all the all the human elements of life is very temporal brother but there's two things that God's gonna allow on himself there as an eternal Memorial and that is the nail prince in his hands and the the scar in his side and no doubt when he raises his hands and we see the nail scars it'll always be a memorial for us to worship Him sorry brother that's what it's all about he created us for worship in the Book of Revelations in chapter four and and we're going to get ready to close but it says in verse 9 and all and when all the beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the Four and Twenty Elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne what is a count a crown a type of authority power dignity whatever and they get all of that and they cast It Before the Throne they give it all up because it's all about the Lord Jesus Christ used these words he said in all the celebrity of Heaven took their crowns from their heads and bowed and knowed that he was Worthy brother makes different comments about receiving a crown of life and you know and all these things I don't know I don't know exactly you know literal figuratively you know all these things is it's still the truth but regardless of what it is we're going to lay it all down on his feet the celebrity of Heaven you think about that all the beasts the ones that have guarded the Tree of Life throughout all ages all the seraphims it's all about him it's all about him it's not about the preacher it's not about the singers it's not about the who's who it's all about him and to give you an Insight many times the preacher that's standing up here don't even want to don't may not feel like preaching maybe they're in the office there yawning and tired in their flesh but it's not about them it's about him you may not always feel like coming to church but it's not about you [Applause] when you think it's about you that's being selfish it's about him the Widow of zeropath she wasn't selfish she was about her son that's what it was about so the the question I'd like to leave you with here is we bring this to an end is he Worthy is Jesus Christ worthy of all the worship all the Adoration all the praise and all the honor is he so if he is worthy then why don't we worship Him you say well I Do Worship Him we can all worship him more and I'm not just talking about church I'm not trying to don't don't misunderstand me I'm not trying to get you pumped up or or to do anything I'm talking about in your daily life worship Him think upon his goodness driving down the car think about how good he is to you because that will draw him to you let our lives worship him every moment of the day when you're in your hardest trial of your life like the Widow's air path and you had no idea on which way to turn and how Inns are going to meet or what's going to happen and how this is going to come to be or that just worship yes let him deal with it let him deal with it we worship him because he is worthy we should be the happiest people on the face of the earth when we were just here a few days ago we were visiting we're brother Bobby sister Monica took us there across the street from their house they've got like a little new shopping center they're building up and took us to little English place with some fish and chips they call it and we were in there and just we were you know a big group and we're just family we're just enjoying our company and our fellowship and we're just there ordering and we weren't act trying to act no weird way just be you and when we're just sitting there we get our food and it takes a while because there's about 100 of us so it takes a while for them to bring us our food so we're all kind of just sitting outside and we're eating and and you know chasing little kids around and right about the time we're about to wrap up just a complete stranger comes up to us and Kyle gives us the nicest compliments there that we look like the happiest people sure we didn't end out of track we didn't walk into the restaurant with a big cross necklace on our chest all we did just just be natural and the world is watching and they pick up very easy and for every person that tells you something very nice many think it but may not tell you but you're a light don't forget what a light that you are it's an evil day that we live in it's a very dark day and you may not think that your realm of influence is all that big but it don't take much light just the slightest bit of light and you light a place up right you light it up with your atmosphere when you walk into your workplace you walk on your job you don't have to tell people that you don't use bad language they notice that the darker it gets the more you shine so let's Worship the Lord with our lives let's be thankful in our heart because he's done so much for us he's so worthy to be praised hey man listening to our feet I sparrowheads and talk to the Lord the gracious Heavenly Father Lord God we thank you for these Lord moments father in your presence we thank you Lord Jesus for all your blessings Lord we thank you for your word Lord we thank you Lord for what you've done for us Lord and how it just makes us want to worship you and Lord many times in our the Frailty of our Humanity we get lazy Lord but help us father Lord that the spirit that's in us your spirit to overcome this flesh and even if we don't feel like it worship you anyway just because you're worthy it's not about what we feel like it's not about what we want to do it's about you we love you with all of our hearts we thank you for this word Lord we thank you for this group of Believers Lord that you've said even as a church here in Lula Georgia Lord to be a lighthouse and he stood upon your for many years and how wonderful Lord it is to see father Lord you grow in Lord and

forgive us of our sins and Lord if there's one father in this in this church this morning Lord that doesn't know you may this be the time that they get to know you Lord in reality Lord maybe they have been a little dry in their worship maybe they haven't been a little drawing their experience maybe a little dry in their love but Lord whatever the need in the situation we're all so needy we all need more of you we all need to be re-baptized with the Holy Ghost Lord may your fire fall may your spirit fall and give us exactly what we have need of we repent of all of our sins we thank you for each

you know William you you're talking about surrendering and getting you know getting getting all this stuff out of you and uh you know we and we talk about worship really true worship because we worship in spirit and truth so we don't worship frivolously we know who to worship what to worship and why all right so we got all that down so when we raise our hands when we confess with our mouth God has to come on the scene and honor our worship he doesn't have to honor the worship out there but he honors the worship of his children he takes care of his kids and then what do we do about give back to him we worship him there's nothing else in this world to worship except the Lord Jesus Christ that's the only man to worship the only person there is nothing else brother William and I were talking today this morning you know but but it's a strange thing about God God sometimes a strange he's a strange person uh to the world but it makes sense because he said he said even if you've done this to one of my little ones he said you've done it unto me so what does God want us to do true worship is as brother Brandon was talking about is loving your fellow brother loving your fellow sister loving somebody in the body of Christ the Lord's telling you to do that before you even worship him because you got to get right you got to get that brotherly kindness down we're fixing to head on to that brother kindness and that's pretty rough because you know Sam who how close is your neighbor Brother Sam you got a neighbor that's pretty close to you couple hundred feet you ever talk to him oh

Bible tells us we're supposed to love our neighbor as we love ourself amen listen as we love ourself now I like me pretty good but I'm supposed to love them the same amount that's the love of God is to love them and pray for them pray for the world pray for what's pray for what's going on in your life pray for what's going on in the other's life so we can bind together and I don't want to keep
