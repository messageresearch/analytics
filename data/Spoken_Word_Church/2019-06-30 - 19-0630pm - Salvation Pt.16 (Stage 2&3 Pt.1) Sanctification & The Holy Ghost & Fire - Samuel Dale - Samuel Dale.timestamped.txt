[34:14] that it the reading because it's not
[34:18] just we read something and we say well
[34:20] that's what it said but then we keep on
[34:24] reading and see maybe find out what it's
[34:27] talking about so look what he says I
[34:30] have taken you from among the heathen
[34:33] and gathered you out of all countries
[34:35] and will bring you into your own land
[34:38] that's natural happening right okay
[34:44] then once he brings them back to their
[34:48] land now this is back Dhara remember
[34:53] this is before this is not coming this
[34:55] is a promise to the end yes because it
[34:57] will transpire but this is mine Liebeck
[35:00] dire that he's telling them what's gonna
[35:02] come as iki was looking forward to the
[35:05] children of Israel coming into their
[35:07] land then I will sprinkle clean water
[35:11] upon you and you shall be clean from all
[35:15] your filthiness and from all your idols
[35:19] now cleanse you
[35:21] now watch he's gonna tell ya he's gonna
[35:23] do that code it's not talking about
[35:24] natural land and natural cleansing if
[35:29] the people and what's to take place a
[35:32] new heart also will I give you in a new
[35:37] spirit well I put within you and I will
[35:41] take away the stony heart out of your
[35:44] flesh and I will give you an heart of
[35:48] flesh and I will put my spirit within
[35:52] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[35:55] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[35:59] them and you shall dwell in the land
[36:01] that I have that I gave to your fathers
[36:04] and you shall be my people and I will be
[36:07] your God you may be seated
[36:10] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[36:12] the word now to try to pick up where we
[36:15] left off this morning and to continue
[36:19] our thought
[36:21] I like for you to get involved in the
[36:27] things and you know no brother Joe
[36:30] brought me a thing and you remember this
[36:33] morning we were talking about how that
[36:38] you come to that let's pull that up pull
[36:40] it up to the clean heart clean soul but
[36:44] they could pull that up and remember we
[36:48] were talking about how we come to this
[36:49] part of life and what happened and what
[36:51] caused that to change and be into the
[36:54] unclean you remember but we backed up
[36:58] like this is a baby and then the baby
[37:01] comes down all right and it gets worse
[37:05] and worse and worse all right see that's
[37:07] what happens to me and you when we come
[37:12] to a point if that unclean spirit goes
[37:13] out and we don't get it replaced it's
[37:17] gonna come back and it's gonna be worse
[37:20] than it ever was so listen to what he
[37:22] says I'll read one above that I told him
[37:28] but you remember what I read are just
[37:32] quoted here while back brother Brent
[37:34] them for the message believe in God he
[37:36] says in the only thing that kept me from
[37:38] being saved when I was twelve years old
[37:41] was the spirit hung over me a devil
[37:45] saying wait a little while longer that's
[37:49] the reason you wasn't saved when you
[37:51] become the age of accountability a
[37:53] spirit you got in the crowd and that
[37:55] hovered over you and kept hanging over
[37:58] you you wanted to do right there's not a
[38:01] man that's got his right mind
[38:03] well what wants to do right but there
[38:06] something won't let you do it is that
[38:08] right it's the devil on here's the one
[38:12] brother Joe gave me from Jesus Christ
[38:14] the same yesterday today and forever
[38:17] now there's two elements just for a few
[38:22] moments on this subject there's two
[38:25] elements that make up the human being
[38:30] one of them is your mind
[38:33] the other is your soul and the mine is
[38:38] your mental thinking not intellectual I
[38:41] mean your your intellectual and your
[38:44] soul is a part of God that's in you and
[38:48] when a man can when you're born into the
[38:49] world a child you grow into a living
[38:52] soul and we're going to grow into a
[38:55] living soul and at the age of choice
[38:59] you hear the Gospels in some way and
[39:01] something way down inside tells you to
[39:04] receive Christ well you say well I'm too
[39:08] young now I'll wait a little longer now
[39:11] there's where you make your first
[39:12] mistake right there for you grieve this
[39:15] person inside and he's describing the
[39:19] human being coming into the world that I
[39:21] was trying to and that was what I kind
[39:24] of ended up on of doing then I was asked
[39:27] a question they all stated this way
[39:29] that's the question what happens to that
[39:32] if that unclean spirit comes back into
[39:36] us brother Branham said the way back for
[39:41] a person as backslidden is the same way
[39:44] for a person that's lost you know I'm
[39:50] saying you'd have to come back to order
[39:51] and do this that years but he says the
[39:53] way that a person backslides then he
[40:00] said then that's the same thing it would
[40:02] have to be for a repentant sinner so you
[40:06] got to come back ask God to forgive you
[40:08] snakes in there you got to get him out
[40:10] all right now that's plain language to
[40:13] you because what the prophets say if
[40:15] that thing comes back when is it going
[40:17] to be a religious demon and you're not
[40:19] going to admit it's a wrong spirit
[40:22] you're going to think it's the Holy
[40:23] Spirit Cody's gonna tell you some good
[40:26] things if it's a religious demon it's
[40:30] going to tell you religious thing it's
[40:32] going to want to go to church come on
[40:36] now I'm sorry sorry for being blunt but
[40:43] anointed
[40:46] people religious anointed people who
[40:50] love the presence of the Lord will not
[40:55] lay out of services like people that are
[41:00] not anointed now did you get that and I
[41:04] need to quote that again see if that no
[41:08] Noi thing is on your spirit you're going
[41:11] to want to go to church you're gonna
[41:13] want to do not but what's wrong the guy
[41:15] inside he's gonna sit there no that
[41:19] ain't right
[41:19] tell it right I know what it is I know
[41:21] what it I know what this they don't want
[41:23] to listen to me I've got I've got it
[41:26] see that guy inside he'll override that
[41:31] guy outside you said brother they'll
[41:38] well okay that's where I stand because
[41:48] that will put it to the basis that I can
[41:50] follow it throughout the message but now
[41:53] listen the point that I'm getting to as
[41:56] I said this is to Ezekiel if speaking to
[41:59] Israel back dark pointing to coming of
[42:03] Israel to their homeland for number one
[42:06] and for the coming of the Holy Ghost to
[42:10] come on the day of Pentecost to the
[42:12] children of Israel all right so what
[42:16] does he say he says to two that he says
[42:20] I give you a white now look how hard it
[42:28] seats and we'll we'll use another
[42:29] scripture in just a minute but cast away
[42:35] from you your transgressions whereby and
[42:38] make you a new heart and a new spirit
[42:43] zekiel 1831 that's not 36 now 36 he's
[42:51] got another scripture I'm wanting to
[42:52] point to where you think he said in
[42:54] Ezekiel 1831 go ahead and pull that up
[42:56] if you want to that's number six
[43:00] just cast away from all your
[43:02] transgressions what about you transgress
[43:04] and make you a new heart a new spirit
[43:07] for why will you die o house of Israel
[43:12] now that's telling you read it
[43:19] cast away from you all your transmitter
[43:22] that's not talking about God just
[43:24] casting away all your trust it's you we
[43:29] need to cast away all our transgressions
[43:31] and things and make a new heart and a
[43:36] new spirit you said well that something
[43:37] for us to do that new heart a new spirit
[43:39] is something for you to do now back up
[43:43] one more scripture back up to Ezekiel 11
[43:47] 19 I think may not have this one's
[43:54] because it's cut off okay
[43:56] now watch what he says and I will give
[44:00] them one heart you can deal with all
[44:10] this other and you can get a heart you
[44:11] can Ollie say but when it comes to God
[44:14] he gives you one heart there's only one
[44:17] heart in the Bible I'm concerned with
[44:19] there's only one soul that word is heart
[44:22] our soul is totally interchangeable
[44:25] alright I give you give them one soul
[44:32] the only soul I'm interested in is the
[44:34] soul that God gave back that when he
[44:37] gave his soul a ransom it doesn't say
[44:42] the bible doesn't say he gave his heart
[44:43] a ransom they gave his soul see because
[44:47] he's dealing with the soul what now
[44:49] remember it's not but one heart watch
[44:51] that in a second now give them one heart
[44:54] and I will put a new spirit within you
[44:57] and I'll take away that stony heart out
[44:59] of their flesh and give them a heart of
[45:02] flesh okay all right
[45:08] so it was speaking of the coming of the
[45:10] Holy Ghost at Calvary in the Upper Room
[45:15] the experience and all like that code
[45:17] there's only one heart now read this one
[45:24] Malachi 4:6 that familiar with us milik
[45:35] I four sixes and turned the heart
[45:41] it does not say hearts it says turn the
[45:47] heart of the children to the father's
[45:53] that's the same heart as iki was talking
[45:55] about because that was what they were
[45:57] supposed to God and as the remnant part
[46:02] are the one true genuine Israelite they
[46:05] got that on the day of Pentecost right
[46:09] they got a new soul they got eternal
[46:13] eyes they got a new heart with that
[46:16] heart if not another heart it's a new
[46:19] soul it's God's own life okay God's own
[46:26] life all right now is that true now
[46:30] because there's only one heart now
[46:32] you're talking about and he doesn't say
[46:34] I'll give you new new hearts give you a
[46:40] new heart now go to Ezekiel 36 what we
[46:45] read our men to go and I will sanctify
[46:49] my great name which was profaned among
[46:52] the heathen which you have profaned in
[46:56] the midst of them and the heathen shall
[46:58] know that i am the lord says the lord
[47:02] god what when i have shall be sanctified
[47:05] in you before their eyes he's gonna do a
[47:10] work but i will take you from among the
[47:14] heathen together you're out of cut all
[47:17] countries and will bring you into your
[47:20] own land
[47:21] coming to Israel coming in a natural ok
[47:24] watch then I'll sprinkle clean water
[47:27] upon you washed by the water of the word
[47:32] that's Ephesians 5 of something all
[47:36] right because he says back that night
[47:39] with no he ain't out there sprinting
[47:40] water what I'm saying we read it but
[47:44] read it in this mind of understanding
[47:46] not what you're reading physical words
[47:50] I'll sprinkle clean was I could find a
[47:53] bunch of that don't you because of what
[47:57] he says and you shall be clean from all
[48:00] your filthiness and from all your idols
[48:03] and I'll cleanse you now then but one
[48:05] thing and cleanse you from your idols
[48:07] and your think and that's the baptism of
[48:09] the Holy Ghost right come on now let's
[48:12] get it and watch it says a new heart
[48:16] also I will give you and the new spirit
[48:21] well I put within you okay we'll go to
[48:25] it and read it in just a minute but
[48:27] around said that's where people made
[48:29] their mistake because when it says a new
[48:32] spirit did they say that's the Holy
[48:35] Spirit he said no that's not the Holy
[48:39] Spirit will read it on down a new heart
[48:43] will I give you that's what we won't you
[48:48] said well what's the new heart that
[48:49] white drawing in it perfectly clean
[48:52] right the heart drawing of the soul of
[48:56] the individual and it beautifully
[48:58] perfectly clean that's the soul I want
[49:00] to be able to come before God because
[49:03] that's the only one that dove can come
[49:07] into can't come in where there's an
[49:11] unclean spirit what won't dwell in an
[49:13] unclean vessel so don't think you're
[49:17] gonna put the devil in God in the same
[49:20] soul that's where I tried to tell the
[49:23] two so people that in the seventies I
[49:24] said show me that the Bible said he
[49:27] won't do it see they had two souls one
[49:30] from garden one from the devil he said
[49:33] well you're still fussing about that now
[49:35] you know what if I was overseas you know
[49:38] what they'd ask me the question about
[49:40] who started that doctrine cuz I happened
[49:43] to be over there one day then they asked
[49:48] something I said no you got the wrong
[49:49] name you got the wrong man claiming he
[49:52] preached that doctrine he said what are
[49:54] you talking about
[49:55] there's people all over the world that
[49:58] they still deceived by this part of
[50:00] understanding the soul the spirit the
[50:03] doings
[50:04] they still got that same doctrine listen
[50:09] a new heart
[50:10] I'll fill what I give you a new spirit
[50:12] when I put within you that's not the
[50:14] Holy Spirit watch that and I will take
[50:17] away that stony heart out of your flesh
[50:18] and I'll give you a heart of flesh clean
[50:21] that soul out make it pliable make it
[50:25] acceptable of God make it not stoning
[50:29] you know I bless God I got my way I
[50:32] believe what I believe you ain't gonna
[50:34] tell me no different I believe what I
[50:35] believe that right tires gonna send a
[50:38] lot of people to the wrong place yeah
[50:41] come on look what he does now a new
[50:46] heart also what I give you and a new
[50:48] spirit when I put within you and I'll
[50:51] take away that stony heart out of your
[50:53] flesh and give you a heart of flesh
[50:54] that's just cleaned now watch the
[50:56] scripture and I will put my spirit
[50:59] within you run said ours the Holy Spirit
[51:05] that's not your spirit we'll get to that
[51:07] point in a minute and I will put my
[51:09] spirit within you and cause you to walk
[51:12] in my statutes and you see I'll keep my
[51:14] judgments and do them and you still
[51:16] dwell in the land that I give you right
[51:18] back to the same park my because the
[51:22] world is to be redeemed as well as only
[51:26] others let's see I had one more
[51:37] No
[51:39] we'll leave that alright we back on
[51:43] where Wes was this morning the last
[51:47] thing we read was reading from and North
[51:50] it not where brother branham was
[51:53] describing the human being in describing
[51:57] the body with the five sentences the
[52:00] spirit were the five senses in the soul
[52:03] as one sense free moral agency he calls
[52:07] it all right now
[52:10] he said if you'd ever get this right
[52:13] you'll understand what the truth
[52:15] evidence of the Holy Ghost is now the
[52:18] Bible says as a man thinketh in his
[52:22] heart so is he
[52:26] no let's don't change the Bible and
[52:31] going there and race out words and put
[52:32] it let's just read it like it hit undo
[52:37] so not a new heart a new soul get there
[52:44] to get it right no one is speaking of a
[52:45] heart as a man thinketh in his heart as
[52:49] a man thinketh in his soul his being of
[52:53] what he is you don't think the Prophet
[52:57] says with your body you don't think with
[53:01] your soul that's why you can love God
[53:05] genuinely love God with your spirit and
[53:10] all kind of signs and wonders and still
[53:13] be lost in the soul now that's the
[53:17] mystery that the end time didn't get
[53:20] even then he hid when the Prophet come
[53:22] along I'm saying that is honest as I can
[53:26] say it they ain't getting it now and
[53:31] they ain't getting it cuz they don't
[53:32] know what it is okay
[53:35] now watch as a man thinketh in his heart
[53:45] the devil thinks through his mind to
[53:49] show him something with his eye but his
[53:53] heart will make him believe something
[53:55] that would be impossible to look at
[53:58] because it's the faith that he has in
[54:01] his heart it's off the message united
[54:06] under one head he believes in his heart
[54:12] the devil thinks through his mind to
[54:16] show him something with his eye but his
[54:21] heart will make him believe something
[54:22] that would be impossible
[54:25] what about it what do you think from the
[54:30] Bible said that a man thinketh in these
[54:31] are now you know the story the prophet
[54:33] went through many many times that's got
[54:35] here you want a word that they found a
[54:38] little inch square compartment in the
[54:41] human beings heart and said that could
[54:45] be the abode of the soul the heart of
[54:49] man is the soul of man the heart of
[54:54] anything watermelon what everyone is
[54:58] this seed of that fruit is what we call
[55:06] the heart huh as a man thinketh in his
[55:09] heart as he thinks from his soul being
[55:14] and what he is cause ain't nothin in the
[55:18] heart think with that's the thumping
[55:20] gizzard it won't work alright so then
[55:24] the Bible he said then see he said God
[55:27] he said I always said that the Bible was
[55:30] right as a man thinketh in his heart he
[55:37] said that's the way he believed it well
[55:38] I think that's the way were to all think
[55:40] about and believe it as a man thinketh
[55:43] in his soul his heart his being
[55:48] coz I've got him if you wanted I've got
[55:51] the definition of heart and the
[55:54] definition of soul
[55:57] even though there's a higher phrase
[55:59] difference between the two words they're
[56:01] basically the same word taking and
[56:08] showing it from the the concordance if
[56:11] you want then I'll be glad to give it to
[56:12] you but listen Church this is what I
[56:16] want to know I give you a new heart and
[56:25] a new spirit I told you the warning for
[56:33] old message was what the danger stage of
[56:36] sanctification is for the unclean spirit
[56:40] to come back and what to happen the
[56:43] people become anointed on their spirit
[56:46] and do all signs and wonders the yet
[56:52] brother Ron said it's still lost do we
[56:59] actually believe that or do we put our
[57:02] whole life upon some form of experience
[57:07] listen I found that one while ago that
[57:12] we'll have time to get to read it but I
[57:14] was ahead is it off the message why
[57:20] there's so many Christians it harder to
[57:22] live the Christian life
[57:24] he said brother Branham I got all the
[57:26] evidences that would be number four
[57:30] fifteen good enough he said I know but
[57:34] we're not talking about evidences we're
[57:38] talking about the product
[57:41] he said I've seen healer and shout all
[57:44] kinds of things but the product is the
[57:47] product and I love that part don't you
[57:49] alright but he said I'll give you a new
[57:53] heart all right do you see that part now
[57:59] they give you a new heart he takes away
[58:02] that old stony heart these you lead
[58:05] looking to sin what do you see the
[58:09] beautiful picture of a heart wouldn't
[58:10] oh nothing in it because he can't give
[58:14] you one that's got wrong in it so what's
[58:18] he gonna do work on what you got he
[58:22] ain't gonna give you a new soul you know
[58:26] he ain't gonna take your soul out no
[58:28] more than he don't take your heart out
[58:31] he's going to give you an opportunity to
[58:36] be saved
[58:38] redemption is not taking out and
[58:41] replacing is that doctrine is in the
[58:45] message also that they call it the
[58:47] exchange of the soul I asked them a
[58:49] simple question I said what's the
[58:51] difference in exchange or change they
[58:56] didn't know the difference to me it's
[58:58] the same thing when they're saying you
[59:00] take out something and put something
[59:01] back in play God has never done mankind
[59:03] out of what he's going to redeem he
[59:05] ain't told this world away right he's
[59:10] going to redeem this earth is that the
[59:14] whole message of future he's not going
[59:17] to annihilate your soul he's going to
[59:20] work on the nature of it the nature of
[59:25] it is what it is if the unclean spirits
[59:30] in there
[59:30] the nature of it is the devil if God is
[59:35] in there the nature of it is God that
[59:37] souls in prison is that the nature of
[59:40] your soul is God if you're born in sin
[59:42] if notice of the devil ain't no
[59:46] in-between no options but let's just
[59:50] take this let me just read some where
[59:54] you won't misunderstand me about this
[59:57] stony heart in this new spirit and then
[1:00:04] finally get to the point of put my
[1:00:06] spirit and listen to your prophet let's
[1:00:09] go to number 12 will start dire cold we
[1:00:12] got you were to see the stack I had on
[1:00:15] this one go to number 12 on the message
[1:00:19] called Intervale God promised through
[1:00:22] the prophets have said
[1:00:24] we'll write my laws in their hearts now
[1:00:29] how's he gonna write it allow any heart
[1:00:32] but there's what the Bible says he's
[1:00:36] gonna have to write it in your nature of
[1:00:38] you being what you are
[1:00:40] take away that stony part that's against
[1:00:42] everything and make it mellow in other
[1:00:46] words talking to that Jew take that
[1:00:49] nature away from that Jew that he right
[1:00:51] now hates us but one day he's gonna love
[1:00:57] us think about all of them ain't talked
[1:01:01] about no natural nation I'm talking
[1:01:04] about dogs that will finally receive
[1:01:06] Jesus Christ they're gonna love you
[1:01:08] cuz they're gonna find out what you
[1:01:10] doing I'll write my laws in their hearts
[1:01:18] now put it in the tables of their hearts
[1:01:21] showing that that would be the dwelling
[1:01:25] place of God in the human heart okay
[1:01:30] that's transmitted work so human soul
[1:01:33] okay not to human head but the human
[1:01:37] heart
[1:01:38] amen I'll write them in the heart and in
[1:01:41] their art and they'll keep my statutes
[1:01:43] and so forth saith the Lord God said in
[1:01:46] another place over in Ezekiel he says I
[1:01:47] will in that day take out your old
[1:01:50] fleshly stony heart and I'll give you a
[1:01:55] new spirit and I'll put my spirit in you
[1:02:01] okay now listen to a lot of people even
[1:02:05] Pentecostal people lots of time gets
[1:02:07] mistaken in there you get a new spirit
[1:02:10] that's not God's Spirit that's you
[1:02:20] that's what he said
[1:02:22] that's you that's not talking about God
[1:02:27] that's what he's saying that's where the
[1:02:29] people missed it they said the new
[1:02:30] spirit was God he said no that's you he
[1:02:35] said then he'll put his
[1:02:36] spirit in you is it now that's the holy
[1:02:39] spirit so read it you get a new spirit
[1:02:43] that's not God's Spirit that's you that
[1:02:45] isn't God you get it a little happy now
[1:02:48] you see why I'm hollered so much about
[1:02:50] justification chopping off you PI sin
[1:02:52] you come to order you're happy you go
[1:02:54] home rejoicing everything's fine and
[1:02:57] wonderful well after a while things
[1:02:58] start coming back and you become the old
[1:03:00] person you was right this is where I got
[1:03:08] it okay he said that isn't God you get a
[1:03:12] little happy because you get a new
[1:03:13] spirit you say where's that new spirit
[1:03:18] working on your spirit and trying to go
[1:03:23] into that person that's pure and white
[1:03:27] and work upon that but that's you
[1:03:30] remember the pure White's you now so
[1:03:33] this is you because you get a new spirit
[1:03:35] you jump up and down run around over the
[1:03:37] floor maybe it's out a little bit and
[1:03:39] speak with tongues run around a little
[1:03:41] bit and think you got the Holy Ghost
[1:03:43] that's not it that's a new spirit God
[1:03:47] gave you that's you then after he give
[1:03:51] you your spirit then he said I'll put my
[1:03:55] spirit that's what's the matter with
[1:03:57] miss me or Crouch you think you're right
[1:04:05] miss me was what he said miss me or
[1:04:07] crowns
[1:04:08] miss me or crams that's when you think
[1:04:11] you're right and it's wrong you got
[1:04:17] today that's right the reason you think
[1:04:18] here nowhere with God
[1:04:21] see you think you're right you have
[1:04:25] listen if you believe the Bible you have
[1:04:30] a new soul part of you God has taken
[1:04:35] your soul washed it out of the unclean
[1:04:38] spirit to God all of those things
[1:04:40] through sanctification chopped off your
[1:04:43] sins made you a wonderful person
[1:04:50] then a new spirit comes into view and
[1:04:54] you think you got to haul the spirit
[1:04:59] come on we read from Ezekiel do we need
[1:05:01] to read it again
[1:05:02] then it says I gave you a new heart a
[1:05:04] new spirit then on down it says and I

[1:12:14] times and there's been a terrible
[1:12:16] mistake the people it's thought

[1:12:58] isn't a new spirit God gives you a new
[1:13:02] why you couldn't even get alone with
[1:13:05] yourself with your old spirit now he's
[1:13:11] talking about cleaned out vessel
[1:13:15] sanctified vessel right with a new
[1:13:20] spirit in it come on we're gonna read
[1:13:24] some more in a second huh yeah you
[1:13:28] couldn't even get along with yourself
[1:13:30] with your old spirit how you gonna get
[1:13:32] along with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:34] now the Holy Ghost is God's own spirit
[1:13:37] right come on God had to give you a new
[1:13:41] spirit so you could get along with his
[1:13:44] spirit and some townspeople a new heart
[1:13:47] and a new flash so you will receive it
[1:13:51] then a new spirit in that heart then
[1:13:54] I'll put my spirit in that you see new
[1:13:58] heart and you spirit my spirit three
[1:14:01] things he spoke of well as soon as you
[1:14:05] get the new spirit then which one you
[1:14:11] talking about one two three
[1:14:12] which one is he talking about one is the
[1:14:15] heart new next is the spirit the next is
[1:14:19] the Holy Spirit right one two three well
[1:14:23] as soon as you get the new spirit you
[1:14:26] quit you're stealing you quit you're
[1:14:28] lying things like that you say Oh
[1:14:30] hallelujah I got it and you find out the
[1:14:36] first time anyone crosses your path a
[1:14:39] little bit oh mercy what a difference
[1:14:42] see you blow up like a frog eating
[1:14:44] buckshot and let me tell you brother
[1:14:47] that's the reason you never got God's
[1:14:52] Spirit Oh
[1:14:56] now remember back a few weeks ago you
[1:15:00] remember how we've tried to explain it
[1:15:02] the brother Branham says you have
[1:15:04] accepted Jesus Christ right but says has
[1:15:11] he accepted you do you remember that
[1:15:17] you've accepted Christ but as he
[1:15:19] accepted you right back sign statement
[1:15:21] go look that's the reason you never got
[1:15:26] God's Spirit the reason you never got
[1:15:30] the Spirit of God is because you get
[1:15:34] messed up in that new spirit part you
[1:15:38] stopped seeking God come on church and
[1:15:43] many times have I said it I'd rather
[1:15:46] seek God out of my life
[1:15:47] find out at the end that I got something
[1:15:49] then to get out the end find out I
[1:15:52] didn't have nothing because of my
[1:15:54] religious over brother della he's seen
[1:15:57] visions he sees angels he's heard God's
[1:15:59] voice he's done all kind of oh he's got
[1:16:02] to be that that don't mean a thing
[1:16:04] that's what I said
[1:16:06] brother Brennan says we talk about
[1:16:08] experiences he said I want the product I
[1:16:12] want that new spirit I don't want this
[1:16:15] the new spirit I want God's Spirit
[1:16:19] that's the Holy Spirit come on you say
[1:16:24] he stepped on my toe I'll just not put
[1:16:28] up well that shows what you got in you
[1:16:31] oh that's true I'll put a new spirit in
[1:16:37] there and then I'll put my spirit in you
[1:16:39] now the heart is the center of the
[1:16:42] emotions of the human being right
[1:16:45] translate soul in that your soul is the
[1:16:48] middle of you cuz that heart salts what
[1:16:50] you are that seems like it right
[1:16:52] so God puts a new heart in the middle of
[1:16:56] the old man he cleanses up the man right
[1:17:00] he sank justifies him he sanctifies him
[1:17:04] he makes him a new man he don't take it
[1:17:11] out throw it away he's still work you
[1:17:15] know and I said earlier emotions of the
[1:17:20] human being your heart is the middle of
[1:17:22] you that's exactly right
[1:17:24] so God puts a new heart in the middle of
[1:17:26] the old man and he puts a new spirit in
[1:17:30] the middle of the new spirit our heart
[1:17:36] and he puts the spirit in the middle of
[1:17:40] the new spirit
[1:17:41] now there's a Redemption it gives you a
[1:17:47] new heart you don't take it out throw it
[1:17:49] away right he cleanses that that you are
[1:17:55] then he puts his spirit in there
[1:17:58] Wow remember the drawing and asking what
[1:18:03] would you need something far or what
[1:18:06] happens between your justification same
[1:18:08] thing in the new birth if you don't get
[1:18:13] to hat Satan will come back so that's
[1:18:19] you right come on
[1:18:22] we get that one done 14 okay let's go to
[1:18:29] the next one
[1:18:31] forget it mark 15 we don't know
[1:18:33] sometimes I get the wrong numbers only
[1:18:36] cause like everything else when is it so
[1:18:39] many Christians find it hard to live the
[1:18:41] Christian life I live the life of the
[1:18:44] croc you get a new spirit you quit your
[1:18:49] drinking supposed to tell everybody you
[1:18:51] understand what I'm reading is far he's
[1:18:54] showing you under that new spirit that
[1:18:56] you get you turn out to be very
[1:18:58] religious and you wind up wanting to go
[1:19:02] to church you want him to live right
[1:19:04] you're wanting to do right but you're
[1:19:07] still not right well bless God I love
[1:19:12] God you can't tell me I love him I do
[1:19:15] everything that he says and don't do it
[1:19:18] Percy hypocrite the best way to say it
[1:19:25] now listen you get a new spirit
[1:19:28] you quit your drinking you get a new
[1:19:29] spirit you quit your drinking line you
[1:19:32] get a new spirit you can do most
[1:19:34] anything with that spirit ain't talking
[1:19:38] about a new spirit right but that isn't
[1:19:42] what God's talking about a new spirit he
[1:19:49] said I'll give you that once I give you
[1:19:52] a new heart and a new spirit why he'd
[1:19:55] have to give you a new spirit to live
[1:19:58] for him that's not the Holy Spirit
[1:20:02] that's the spirit my son that comes to
[1:20:07] you for to try to help you
[1:20:11] don't get helmets Oh cuz it says beer
[1:20:13] that's it
[1:20:16] you don't understand cause you don't
[1:20:18] want to understand you said in your
[1:20:20] bygone ways for all these years but get
[1:20:22] out of it what do you think we're here
[1:20:25] 50 years after the prophets gone and
[1:20:28] I'll tell you that judgment one way or
[1:20:31] the other I preached that 40 years ago
[1:20:35] 50 - matter of fact I've been screaming
[1:20:41] about all of this well I don't remember
[1:20:45] you preaching that that turns up my
[1:20:50] righteous indignation okay but that
[1:21:00] isn't what God's talking about a new
[1:21:02] spirit I said you know what forgive me
[1:21:04] for that I give you a new heart a new
[1:21:06] spirit well you have to give you a new
[1:21:09] spirit to live for him well you couldn't
[1:21:12] even live with yourself
[1:21:14] with the spirit you did here you
[1:21:19] couldn't live with your neighbor
[1:21:21] you couldn't associate it with the next
[1:21:23] man on the next corner
[1:21:24] you couldn't associate with these
[1:21:26] Christians why you've had an awful
[1:21:32] spirit so it has to give you a new
[1:21:35] spirit I give you a new heart a new
[1:21:37] spirit no once and I'll put my spirit in
[1:21:41] you there's the difference I'll put my
[1:21:48] spirit in you and there's where you find
[1:21:54] it so hard as you go down to the
[1:21:57] churches and you get a different concept
[1:21:59] you know what I believe I ought to go to
[1:22:02] church is that a religious attitude then
[1:22:06] you go back home and say hallelujah I
[1:22:09] got it no you haven't then you go down
[1:22:11] to church and yourself oh I believe that
[1:22:14] something's happened I don't look at
[1:22:18] things the way I used to
[1:22:19] hallelujah in a few days you find
[1:22:23] yourself right down
[1:22:24] into the same old rut he was doubting
[1:22:27] reasoning everything else well now if
[1:22:31] pastor Sancho said that was right I
[1:22:32] don't believe it right I just take his
[1:22:35] word for it I'll tell you I'm going I'll

[1:23:12] write an unknown tongue and the witch
[1:23:14] rise up and read it interpret it and
[1:23:17] tell the truth if a man could speak with
[1:23:21] tongues if a man could see out if a man
[1:23:23] could see visions if a man could do any
[1:23:26] of these that these other things that
[1:23:28] hope he can do without divine love they
[1:23:31] are lost in other words for you to do
[1:23:36] that without your anointed ones do you
[1:23:40] get it that's right
[1:23:43] Christ is in the heart don't get

[1:24:13] all right number 16 where did we get
[1:24:18] that far
[1:24:25] number 16 this is from the message
[1:24:28] impersonation of Christianity they say
[1:24:32] yes sure I don't want to go to hell I
[1:24:35] want to accept Christ that's alright
[1:24:39] that's good that's just your first step
[1:24:44] what's that a new desire I want to do
[1:24:50] right now I know I'm a Christian I go
[1:24:57] I'll smoke one more then I'll throw it
[1:25:00] away
[1:25:01] many of you live that ain't Timbo will
[1:25:06] you die on your head for me and you've
[1:25:08] been together and you try to quit these
[1:25:12] things but without him it don't work
[1:25:16] ain't picking on him I pick Adobe okay
[1:25:21] but now that's the new spirit excuse me
[1:25:25] he's stop just for a moment that's all
[1:25:28] she had to do but now that's the new
[1:25:31] spirit to notice the order of the
[1:25:33] scripture after you get a new heart and
[1:25:35] a new spirit he said that I'll put my
[1:25:37] spirit see oh that's what that's the
[1:25:41] what the scripture says here that's the
[1:25:44] order the numerix are in numerical order
[1:25:48] of the scripture a new heart a new
[1:25:51] spirit and in my spirit then God's Holy
[1:25:56] Spirit God's new heart then he put in
[1:25:58] you sets right in the center of you okay
[1:26:02] and that's that's your impulse or what
[1:26:06] motivates our makes you going is from
[1:26:08] the very end word part of you come on
[1:26:11] not just your second realm of your
[1:26:13] spirit listen your impulse for you your
[1:26:16] emotion goes out and the new spirit
[1:26:19] since right in the center of the heart
[1:26:25] your new spirit is going God's Spirit is
[1:26:29] going right in your it's gonna come into
[1:26:31] your heart before it works on to the
[1:26:34] next stage so don't just don't take that
[1:26:36] as him saying it's wrong
[1:26:37] he's saying it right then you spirits
[1:26:39] that's right in the middle of the you
[1:26:40] are because that is exactly what is
[1:26:42] invent explain it then where does it go
[1:26:44] and God spirit the Holy Spirit since
[1:26:49] right since right in the center of your
[1:26:52] new spirit and there it controls your
[1:26:55] emotions he says like a - praying of a
[1:26:58] watch
[1:27:01] they don't just read something and
[1:27:04] you'll read it in your mind or click new
[1:27:06] spirit sense right in the middle of the
[1:27:07] news new heart he said well that's what
[1:27:09] he was excited that's right but don't he
[1:27:14] went right on to explain it and God's
[1:27:16] Spirit watch this order new heart new
[1:27:19] spirit God's Spirit sometimes read by
[1:27:26] revelation instead of reading what you
[1:27:28] think it says but remember you're doing
[1:27:34] your own interpreting he said the minds
[1:27:43] praying and if I must watch it's no
[1:27:46] wonder you don't have to want it every
[1:27:48] day God's wound it once for all and he
[1:27:51] says right in the middle of your life
[1:27:54] the new life and as the minds frame as
[1:28:00] it really read leaves and ticks away the
[1:28:04] watch it controls every little organism
[1:28:07] oh that was too perfect okay we're at 16
[1:28:15] go to 17 still only impersonation of
[1:28:18] Christianity wrote it up oh excuse me
[1:28:21] let's back her down cuz that's where
[1:28:22] she's going the whole thing
[1:28:24] now watch the Bible I'll give you take
[1:28:27] the old Stoney Hardaway and give you a
[1:28:29] heart of flesh tender-hearted and I'll
[1:28:32] give you a new spirit then I put my
[1:28:35] spirit in you know what his spirit was
[1:28:38] different from your new spirit the
[1:28:43] spirit is different from your new spirit
[1:28:45] he gives you a new spirit then he comes
[1:28:48] in and his spirit lives in
[1:28:50] that's the new birth I'll put my spirit
[1:28:53] now watch his spirit was different from
[1:28:56] your new spirit and many people get the
[1:28:58] new spirit and think they got the holy
[1:29:00] spirit they get feeling happy and jump
[1:29:04] around and maybe do a few things
[1:29:06] religiously and they think that they got
[1:29:10] the Holy Spirit
[1:29:11] oh no the Holy Spirit makes you act
[1:29:14] different the Holy Spirit makes you
[1:29:17] think different the Holy Spirit was put
[1:29:20] right in the middle of your new spirit
[1:29:23] and your new spirit is put right in the
[1:29:26] middle of your new heart
[1:29:28] he's coming about backwards now come on
[1:29:33] the new heart the new spirit in the
[1:29:37] middle of the heart and God says I'll
[1:29:40] put my spirit in you now then God's
[1:29:43] Spirit gets right in the middle of your
[1:29:45] spirit your new spirit then you don't
[1:29:48] have to go out and act like mirror's
[1:29:50] Jones does and like mirrors you'd be
[1:29:53] like a sister told me one time she said
[1:29:56] I know my children how the Holy Ghost
[1:30:02] the baptism with holder goes she's
[1:30:05] called I was Darwin they receive the
[1:30:08] baptism I'll hold off and said every one
[1:30:10] of them come for speaking in tongues I'm
[1:30:16] not gonna go into an elaboration I'm
[1:30:18] will just make the statement I said do
[1:30:21] you believe your daughter doing what
[1:30:23] she's doing right now
[1:30:24] oh that's what she'd called me to talk
[1:30:28] to him I said you believe your daughter
[1:30:31] is doing what she's doing right now and
[1:30:34] you say she was born again by the new
[1:30:37] birth I said I don't believe it you
[1:30:49] never called me no more
[1:30:53] no she wanted me to tell her kids were
[1:30:55] safe I ain't gonna tell you you're safe
[1:30:58] nor your children are safe I ain't gonna
[1:31:00] tell my wife's I ain't gonna tell my
[1:31:03] kids are safe
[1:31:04] I ain't gonna tell my grandkids the
[1:31:06] great-grandkids and whatever they are I
[1:31:08] ain't gonna tell you your safes I'm
[1:31:10] gonna tell you you got to tell me so
[1:31:13] there's got to be your experience not
[1:31:17] mine so what'd he say
[1:31:23] Newhart Zico's exactly right he's
[1:31:27] explaining the plan of salvation now
[1:31:32] come on
[1:31:32] brother branham goes here from these old
[1:31:35] tapes back in the fifties and sixties
[1:31:38] and he goes to the future home and he
[1:31:40] said I've talked three stages from the
[1:31:44] beginning and never changed one iota so
[1:31:48] he always talked what Newhart no
[1:31:56] cleansing you out set in your side God
[1:32:00] putting his spirit in you a new spirit
[1:32:03] and then the Holy Spirit coming to live
[1:32:06] in you there's the new birth but I say
[1:32:11] this without the crying in the deepest
[1:32:14] parts of my heart the biggest part of
[1:32:17] our religious Society is based upon what
[1:32:20] he just said
[1:32:21] he said people believe that new spirit
[1:32:25] means they have the Holy Spirit but he
[1:32:32] said it's not it's his spirit put in you
[1:32:36] is your Holy Spirit hey where'd we get
[1:32:39] to okay
[1:32:48] listen church
[1:32:52] I'm sorry to be offensive in words I
[1:32:56] said to her the other day they don't
[1:32:58] wine in the world and I say that about
[1:33:01] the women in the advertisement and it
[1:33:04] was for sale maybe I didn't say it but
[1:33:06] they're so human being repented because
[1:33:10] I didn't outright say that because it's
[1:33:13] your right you want to go out and show
[1:33:16] yourself to the world and act like the
[1:33:18] world it's not my responsibility other
[1:33:21] than telling you the truth you go cut
[1:33:27] your hair women it's your responsibility
[1:33:29] not mine
[1:33:31] but if I tell you it's wrong it's not me
[1:33:37] telling you it's wrong that's a word man
[1:33:40] you go out and do something that's
[1:33:43] nothing for them in my brother Dale
[1:33:47] don't preach this clothesline and this
[1:33:49] that in the oven ever service you know
[1:33:51] is your wife worthy of the gospel you
[1:33:53] know is this let's get two women
[1:33:54] straightened up or you know if y'all
[1:33:56] would get straightened up we'd be ready
[1:33:58] to go what if everybody's waiting on me
[1:34:00] oh you base everything on dreams and
[1:34:05] visions inside hey you want me to tell
[1:34:09] you feel you want me to tell you when I
[1:34:12] had a dream and showed all of you gone
[1:34:15] in the rapture and me walking back into
[1:34:17] the world in the darkness what you don't
[1:34:23] know it was you know one thing for sure
[1:34:27] I had a happy heart because I saw you go
[1:34:35] on they don't matter about this old boy
[1:34:41] sister Barbara had a dream one time that
[1:34:46] each one around here was kind of needing
[1:34:48] to be carried a little bit and since
[1:34:49] she'd look and said wanted me said known
[1:34:51] brother Dale shoulder and said I had a
[1:34:53] wallet set that and down and pick up a
[1:34:54] nut and put it on his shoulder never
[1:34:56] that sister bar we'll see that's the
[1:34:59] happiness for me I can say from the
[1:35:03] bottom of my heart if I miss it
[1:35:06] I still am proud for what God has
[1:35:10] revealed to me but he hasn't made known
[1:35:13] to me all these 50 years that I can
[1:35:16] stand on it and still believe the same
[1:35:18] thing that I believe 50 years ago and it
[1:35:22] just keeps unfolding unfolding that's
[1:35:26] the way I know whether I'm born again or
[1:35:28] not it's because what I preach cannot be
[1:35:37] tore down oh you're exalted now I'm just
[1:35:47] telling you as far as I know the truth
[1:35:49] I've tried to bring you the plan of
[1:35:53] salvation from what the Prophet had to
[1:35:57] say but how many of you is the same as
[1:36:04] the prophets it where it says I give you
[1:36:06] a new heart
[1:36:07] father God I give you a new spirit you
[1:36:09] thought well that's the Holy Spirit cuz
[1:36:10] I got it from that altar I prayed and I
[1:36:12] cried and Gardner and I kind of learn I
[1:36:14] felt so good and I just went out and
[1:36:16] I've been living for the Lord ever since
[1:36:18] but I'll tell you this and one more time
[1:36:21] on sale you anointed ones will outshine
[1:36:29] you ain't gonna like this one look away
[1:36:32] anointed ones because they believe their
[1:36:35] anointing is what saves them and what
[1:36:37] happens they're going to outshine in
[1:36:39] life the real genuine because the
[1:36:46] genuine is not putting their life upon
[1:36:48] some works or Salvage I mean some
[1:36:50] something they've done what they've seen
[1:36:52] what they
[1:37:00] yes he I've seen the Lord through his
[1:37:08] opening of his word that's greater than
[1:37:11] to me than all the other things that
[1:37:12] I've seen because you tell me some of
[1:37:17] the point of the new work when you're
[1:37:21] prophet right to her message after
[1:37:23] message after message explained a new
[1:37:25] heart and that was the Stoney take that
[1:37:28] away explains give you a new spirit and
[1:37:32] he said puts that into your heart or the
[1:37:35] center of you but he said that ain't
[1:37:38] right then he gives you his spirit to
[1:37:41] put inside of there
[1:37:43] no wonder Paul said come on musician
[1:37:46] Paul summed it up by saying it's not I
[1:37:51] that liveth the Christ that liveth in me
[1:37:55] the life that I now live in the flesh I
[1:37:58] live by the faith for the Son of God
