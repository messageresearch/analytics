[23:47] tell you what um uh we got through that
[23:49] and here we are on the other side amen
[23:52] PR it didn't matter to us because he
[23:54] never stopped us the word never stopped
[23:55] going around the world Amen we were able
[23:57] to stream and praise God and on our
[23:59] property uh I never seen my little town
[24:02] so empty there wasn't nothing everything
[24:05] was closed and just I don't even know
[24:07] why I was there but I was driving
[24:08] through it was the only one there and uh
[24:11] amen so we had to do that but having our
[24:13] own property we could walk around and

[24:31] praise the Lord amen so it's just so
[24:33] nice to be with you and um things change
[24:37] nothing in this life stays the same and
[24:39] I'm sure you a lot of you are old enough
[24:41] to know that that life has changed
[24:43] things happen and we're just out of
[24:45] control of that but as brother Branham
[24:47] used to always say we can't stay here
[24:50] amen and we would reach the point when
[24:52] amen and sometimes it's younger than
[24:55] older amen you reach the point where God
[24:57] calls you home for whatever reason but
[25:00] the thing is to know that he is in
[25:02] control amen and the thing to know is
[25:05] I'm sure i' be talking to some people
[25:06] today that might not even think much of
[25:08] themselves but you are important to God
[25:12] he cares for you and you're important
[25:14] and you are here for a purpose amen you
[25:17] say well I don't feel like I mean what
[25:19] purpose the very fact that you're
[25:20] sitting there and you're fulfilling a
[25:22] purpose amen praise God we you know the
[25:25] Lord has has has ordained us and and I
[25:28] love that because in this message amen
[25:30] that we love praise God we can see that
[25:33] ordination in the things that we do and
[25:36] and what is happening and we look at the
[25:38] world and we can see the world for what
[25:39] it is and Putin for what he is in

[28:58] and the first one I came to to day
[28:59] Terrence and you know I never said it to
[29:01] him but my when I first came about
[29:04] that's the way brother deal looked
[29:06] brother Samuel that's the way he looked
[29:08] just you could see that that that and
[29:10] that's what I thought yeah just I can
[29:12] remember all them years ago he looked
[29:14] like that so amen and and and it doesn't
[29:17] really matter but the jeans are all
[29:19] there in the family and we're so
[29:21] thankful for that today so it's lovely
[29:23] we got to watch the the time and as i s
[29:25] say more about my dear wife later on but
[29:29] uh when we I did make a promise that we
[29:31] would get the I'll show you this
[29:33] surround and all that where um we made a
[29:36] promise to the Lord that I wouldn't do
[29:38] anything until uh we have it a bit
[29:41] little bit different in in Ireland uh in
[29:44] the churchyard which is buried to have a
[29:46] surround with it and and the nice Stones
[29:49] over that and then the two headstones
[29:51] one for her mama and one for her and I
[29:54] and uh that's the way it is the way we
[29:56] do it it's a lovely
[29:57] place and I've got a little photograph
[30:00] on my phone you you see it from there
[30:02] you can see it all and it's in the
[30:04] rivers beside it and uh and if if I if
[30:08] the Lord carries and I go I'll be right
[30:10] beside her I'll be right there with her
[30:12] so uh amen uh but as I say more on that
[30:16] later amen but I wouldn't come anywhere
[30:18] until that was all set up and now it's
[30:20] all done there's nothing more I can do
[30:22] physically for her and and we've been
[30:25] there a lot actually about three or four
[30:28] months it's about a a kilometer away
[30:31] from us and that would be about what a
[30:33] third of a mile or something like that
[30:35] so it's easy just to pop down and just
[30:38] reminisce with her and it's like my
[30:40] grandfather when his wife passed away he
[30:43] said now remember this he said it's not
[30:46] goodbye he said it's just good night he
[30:48] said it's just good night he said I will
[30:50] see you in the morning amen is that
[30:52] right folks praise God well Hallelujah
[30:56] Hallelujah wonderful to see and I can
[30:58] see a move in the church uh it's
[31:01] wonderful praise God that the sprits
[31:03] there and we're all uplifted and moving
[31:06] on and we are on a Higher Ground now

[31:10] high more Higher Ground than we've ever
[31:11] been on amen and praise God we're
[31:14] getting closer and closer to that day
[31:15] and that pull is there amen and we can
[31:18] feel it Hallelujah experience it amen
[31:21] and that Crystal is in tune with God
[31:23] hallelujah that soul is in tune with God
[31:25] and I tell you it's good things amen
[31:27] that the world's in darkness and we're
[31:29] in go we're walking in the light as he
[31:31] is in the light well um amen I suppose
[31:35] you wonder what you know about a pastor
[31:36] and how do you get your messages and
[31:38] what are you doing things just happen in
[31:40] different ways you can get a message in
[31:41] different ways but wasn't all that long
[31:43] ago I I was reading that little
[31:45] scripture in in in
[31:47] Galatians amen and it says uh for I am
[31:51] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[31:54] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[31:59] amen Christ liveth in me and the life
[32:02] that I now live in the flesh I live by
[32:05] the faith of the Son of God Amen now
[32:08] there's a man speaking about something
[32:11] that has happened in his life amen and
[32:14] that's the whole criteria of it amen
[32:17] something got to happen to you and you
[32:19] know it happened amen you were there
[32:21] praise the Lord and and and now you're
[32:24] living a different life and that would
[32:25] be the the title m message the life that
[32:28] I now live I live by the faith of Jesus
[32:31] Christ now you will forgive me amen
[32:35] because I'm going to come to that in a
[32:37] later point but uh it was just a few
[32:40] weeks ago that about 6:00 in the morning
[32:44] I I I woke up and you know a minister
[32:47] will tell you this sometimes when he
[32:48] gets real close and he starts to it
[32:51] comes like a machine gun you
[32:53] know and you're thinking about it
[32:55] sometimes you get it wrote down and
[32:56] you're thinking about it and this is the
[32:57] way it came to me and that's what you're
[32:59] getting this morning so you just
[33:01] understand that amen cuz I want to take
[33:02] you different directions amen but first
[33:06] of all I what did you call it sadoku is
[33:08] that what you call it over here Soko
[33:10] okay and I'm sure a lot of you maybe
[33:12] you're one I don't know but I'm sure
[33:14] we'd all know what that that game is you
[33:15] know soku amen where you've got your
[33:18] your box and you've got your three or
[33:20] nine n squares in it and your letters
[33:22] and you have to join them all up and one
[33:24] line and then the box and and all the
[33:26] words you know and and uh I never did
[33:29] that I mean I'm what 76 years of age and
[33:31] I and I never did that and only when
[33:34] when my wife passed away that that I I
[33:36] picked it up one of her books one day
[33:37] and I started to do it so I've been
[33:39] doing it ever since amen with varying
[33:42] degrees of
[33:45] success but but amen I I was thinking
[33:49] about that as we start off the message
[33:51] amen and and I was just thinking you
[33:53] know when this message came to me about
[33:56] about numbers
[33:57] you got to get your numbers right praise
[34:00] God and and and and and uh you know I
[34:02] would I would like to just talk about
[34:04] that for a moment for the younger people
[34:06] uh maybe not so younger people about the
[34:08] numbers in the Bible amen uh just for a
[34:11] moment amen like if you looked at say
[34:13] the first 10 up to 12 numbers but I'll
[34:16] not go into 11 but you know numbers are
[34:18] important amen and and the first number
[34:21] is that the Lord your God is one amen
[34:23] amen is one I preached just a message
[34:26] not that long a go to my own
[34:27] congregation that what you can't
[34:29] separate and what you should be
[34:31] separated so you can't separate the
[34:34] godhead this here I was looking at there
[34:36] brother we did this morning you can't
[34:38] separate that amen there's your morphe
[34:41] there Hallelujah there's the servant who
[34:43] thought it not robbery to be eagle with
[34:45] God and you can't separate it you can't
[34:49] separate Jesus from Christ or Christ
[34:51] from Jesus it is the one person amen and
[34:54] so praise God the logus you can't
[34:56] separate the logus from the amorph cuz
[34:59] they are one one part of it God I might
[35:01] even speak about a little bit I was
[35:02] often wondered about Divinity you know
[35:05] like divinity we know about deity he's
[35:06] God he's all powerful he's created but
[35:09] what is Divinity and and I thought about
[35:11] that and and maybe share a little bit
[35:13] about that you know but one one God
[35:15] hallelujah amen and and we see that when
[35:17] he Express that because that's important
[35:20] as we're going to go into this in a
[35:21] moment something that was lost but was
[35:23] found again and we've got it Hallelujah
[35:26] that's the great thing amen talk about
[35:28] what about in the 1840s or something the
[35:30] Gold Rush we've got the gold today amen
[35:33] we certainly got it Hallelujah and two
[35:35] witness you know uh the two is always
[35:38] the number of witness amen uh and the
[35:40] two witnesses that are to come and
[35:42] brother Bram was almost jumping like
[35:43] that when he said when I saw that he
[35:45] said he said it's not one it's alleah
[35:48] and Moses amen two he says coming and he
[35:51] said that was a real blessing that's the
[35:53] only time that the two came together
[35:55] that's how important it is to the Jewish
[35:57] people Amen in the Great Tribulation
[36:00] amen and so and the three which is a
[36:02] beautiful number the most beautiful
[36:04] number I I sometimes I would just use a
[36:07] Sunday morning and preach these things
[36:08] to my people and maybe I we're talking
[36:11] about the first SE I did that not long
[36:12] ago of got and you know and there's a
[36:14] lot when you read them things there's a
[36:16] lot there praise God and and tree the
[36:18] Perfection amen the three offices cuz it
[36:21] is three is divine Perfection that's
[36:24] that's his Perfection amen and his three
[36:26] offices amen and uh amen it's the first
[36:29] of the the perfect numbers one of them
[36:32] uh three and seven and 10 and 12 and if
[36:35] you multiply them all together you end
[36:37] up with 200
[36:39] 2,520 and that is the time of the
[36:42] dispersia across the world and then
[36:45] praise God that is the time of the
[36:46] Gentiles and we these are all all gone
[36:49] now the dispersia is over the dentil
[36:51] times virtually
[36:54] 99% over and praise God so these are all
[36:58] important amen and uh but you could say
[37:01] a lot about that you could make a
[37:02] message I've got it uh but but it's
[37:04] beautiful and and for the Earthly number
[37:07] amen you know I heard somebody say one
[37:09] time when as a young boy he says never
[37:12] get so Heavenly mind that that your feet
[37:14] is not on the ground amen so some people
[37:17] can have their head in the sky but
[37:19] that's not a good thing not all the time
[37:21] amen so praise God but four is the Four

[37:45] says it you can rest your soul on it
[37:47] because it will come to pass it has to
[37:49] come to pass so praise the Lord and and
[37:51] and and the five I'm not going to say

[40:35] things you know we sing a song and said
[40:37] you know it well love divine all lovees
[40:41] excelling amen and and we know that and

[40:54] praise God hallelujah and you say well
[40:56] what about this you can't divide them

[41:26] the distinctive nature uh uh or Essence
[41:30] of God what he is that's the Divinity
[41:33] amen what he is and it's a funny thing
[41:35] if I never give this uh to to to to Joe

[41:40] about that the the the the heavens up
[41:42] there declare his eternal godhead and

[42:10] Divine Healing amen because it's showing
[42:12] the essence of what he is hallelujah and
[42:15] praise God uh the Divine Authority that
[42:18] he gives us I'm going to speak a little
[42:19] bit about that in a moment and the
[42:20] divine revelation it's it's divine it
[42:22] has to come from that one person and
[42:25] that's Jesus Christ himself
[42:26] that's why the life that I I live I live
[42:29] it by that faith of Jesus Christ amen
[42:32] and me Christ liveth in me amen so

[42:54] amen and so Hallelujah there's going to
[42:57] be a n day there's going to be another

[43:03] day that will be amen and I can't wait
[43:05] there to to see that Crystal uh sea or
[43:09] Crystal water flowing clean pure and and
[43:13] what a place that will be all together
[43:14] we'll just cannot fathom what that's
[43:17] going to be like amen praise God and he
[43:19] has revealed it to us because John being
[43:22] our type he had a tour amen I love that
[43:25] you know you go over to is somebody take
[43:26] you on a tour around all the places this

[43:36] future home and uh brother we was
[43:38] telling me he' been speaking about that
[43:39] too well we speak about everything I
[43:42] think over this last many years we've
[43:45] covered nearly everything is to cover
[43:47] but praise God as regard what's there
[43:49] but it's getting into the the the ethos
[43:51] of at night it's getting into the power
[43:52] of at night the authority of at night
[43:54] and we'll talk about that just in a
[43:55] moment nine and the gifts of the Spirit
[43:58] amen so praise the Lord and and and 10
[44:01] or or didn't what God ordains to be to
[44:04] rule us like the Ten Commandments and
[44:06] you know these things and I was thinking
[44:08] about these things you got to keep them

[44:12] of Apostles of the lamb and and the sons
[44:15] of of of uh Jacob amen of Israel you got

[44:21] are amen and we've got the revelation of
[44:23] it and that's so important I want to
[44:25] speak
[44:26] uh just in a few moments about two of my
[44:28] favorite quotes now this is the way the
[44:30] Lord led me that's why I'm going this
[44:31] way but but uh just in a moment and so

[47:02] to the fathers man we understand that to
[47:05] be we're the children turn our hearts
[47:07] back to the Pentecostal fathers yeah we
[47:09] understand that amen and two he will
[47:12] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[47:15] thunders in Revelation 10 amen which are
[47:19] the Revelation contained in the Seven
[47:22] Seals now that's what he said and I love
[47:24] Simplicity praise God I love Simplicity
[47:27] when God just says it like that so you
[47:29] don't need to worry what's these is
[47:31] there seven more Thunders or anything
[47:33] that's exactly what he said that's
[47:35] exactly what he meant amen you know the
[47:38] arish people consider themselves playing
[47:40] speaking people amen and and you always
[47:43] say what you mean and you always mean
[47:45] what you say amen and that's the best
[47:47] way to do it so he meant what he said
[47:49] here praise God and and and amen it says
[47:53] it will be these divinely revealed
[47:56] mystery
[47:57] truths that will literally literally
[48:02] turn the hearts of the children to the
[48:05] Pentecostal fathers amen amen no and and

[48:30] hearts have been turned back we've got
[48:32] the same spirit that Paul had I said it

[48:56] just think about that today young people
[48:58] your heart has literally been changed
[49:01] back there's been a change in your heart
[49:04] back to what they had at Pentecost
[49:06] hallelujah amen woo I remember we were
[49:10] over we were I was over in uh Myanmar
[49:14] and um we we we we actually from popet
[49:17] you could uh take a place a little
[49:19] flight and it dangerous cuz it's going
[49:21] through the valleys you know and there
[49:23] was an N crash in it not long ago
[49:26] and um we went up to a place where the
[49:29] big prison was but it was also a tourist
[49:31] attraction place so we were there and
[49:34] that night it rained hard and when we
[49:36] arrived the pastor was brushing out the
[49:38] the water out of the the the basement
[49:40] and and that night the people came and
[49:43] they came in like a tractor and and a
[49:46] trailer and they were all on it and then
[49:48] there was another one and that's how
[49:49] they came now I of I often wondered
[49:52] about that you know is this like R the
[49:54] crowd have but it's not R to cred
[49:56] hallelujah it's as as many as wanted to
[49:59] come that could get on was there
[50:01] Hallelujah and I tell you what I'm sure
[50:04] they were glad they were there because
[50:06] uh at the end of that service and this
[50:09] woman there was there about a
[50:10] 14-year-old girl I think uh her age was
[50:13] and and I still got her testimony wrote
[50:14] down and wow uh when I went down and was
[50:17] praying for the people she said this
[50:19] girl uh her daughter she said she's deaf
[50:21] she can't hear nothing she's completely
[50:23] St deaf and I said well I pray for her
[50:26] sister and I prayed for her and nothing
[50:28] happened she just looked at me and
[50:30] nothing happened and she couldn't hear
[50:31] nothing and I said well that's that's
[50:33] that's fine amen I said um I just I want
[50:35] to apologize that we should have the
[50:38] power and I'm going to talk about that
[50:39] in a moment but we should have the power
[50:42] but uh amen and and that was it so we
[50:44] moved on prayed for that well the next
[50:46] night and I was only there two nights
[50:48] the next night uh that girl her mother
[50:50] brought her again into the par so I
[50:52] looked down and I said well my that's
[50:54] faith I love that you know something
[50:56] about prayer can I just throw this in
[50:57] here right now to you something about
[50:59] prayer you could have been praying I'm
[51:00] sure some of you have been praying for
[51:02] years year in year out about thing maybe
[51:05] it's a l one anything and you're praying
[51:07] or maybe about yourself something that
[51:10] you would like God to do and all them
[51:11] prayer seems to just hit the ceiling and
[51:13] back and you're never going to get an
[51:15] answer but well well Zachariah was like
[51:18] that in the temple he was exactly like
[51:21] God and and and Gabriel says and your
[51:23] wife will conceive and your prayer is
[51:25] here that's what he says he said what
[51:27] prayer like would you be talking about
[51:29] you know I mean you know come on let's
[51:31] get real here what what are you on about
[51:33] and he said you're going to have a child
[51:35] oh no I don't believe that that was
[51:37] maybe a couple of years back 10 years
[51:38] May yeah I don't believe that he said
[51:40] okay you don't believe it will you'll be
[51:41] de or dumb until until the de happens
[51:44] amen cuz I've come from God to tell you
[51:47] this message and and and amen so so God
[51:50] can hear the first day you can pray a
[51:52] thing it may take 15 years to answer
[51:55] answer but I'll tell you what the first
[51:57] day you pray it was heard in heaven you
[51:59] find out with Daniel you find out in the
[52:00] Book of Daniel okay and and that's the
[52:03] way it is amen and and I love this here
[52:05] may I just know this and before I get
[52:07] onto that other quote he said but could
[52:09] consider this also this Prophet Prophet
[52:11] Messenger will be in his nature and
[52:13] manners as were Elijah and John Elijah
[52:16] the tishbite and John the Baptist the
[52:18] people of this Prophet Messengers day
[52:21] will be as they were in Abraham's day
[52:24] and in John's day absolutely absolutely
[52:26] surrounded by unbelief amen praise God
[52:29] it's always going to be that way and I
[52:31] remember one guy I seen him there not
[52:32] long ago but I just didn't get a chance
[52:34] to talk to him and he's a kind of a he
[52:37] does this music and he said one day he
[52:39] singing which not sorry he wrote an
[52:42] article and it was nothing to do with
[52:44] anything that he was talking about he
[52:46] said and the people that believe and
[52:47] know in dark and all that that bunk them
[52:49] and all that there I said well I'd love
[52:51] to talk to you one day about it I'd love
[52:53] to talk to you about it because God said
[52:55] it happened sence has even tell him it
[52:57] happened that's not going to convince an
[52:58] unbeliever that ain't going to convince
[53:00] no you heard our brother this morning
[53:02] speaking about that that won't confess
[53:03] an unbeliever amen praise God but listen

[53:16] about the the seven Messengers in the
[53:17] Old Testament Church amen and they are
[53:20] there Hallelujah and praise God and it

[53:25] children whose Hearts will be turned
[53:28] right it's only the children who will
[53:31] listen right there you go folks there
[53:34] you go amen praise God and uh the best
[53:37] you can do is just hand it out do what
[53:41] you say and let it the rest with the
[53:43] Lord amen and witness and your life is a
[53:45] witness I know that so wonderful and
[53:48] then could I just go on this very fast

[57:40] because this is a very important thing
[57:43] for us all today that we've had a change
[57:46] from this message has done one wonderful
[57:49] thing many wonderful things but one of
[57:51] the Glorious things that it did is it
[57:53] acknowledged the supremacy the Supreme
[57:57] deity of Jesus Christ that this is a no
[58:00] second person this is the person of God
[58:03] hallelujah and the Supreme deity he said
[58:06] brother Bram said it's the greatest of
[58:07] all Revelations amen he that's what he
[58:10] said it's the deity the Supreme deity of
[58:12] our Lord Jesus Christ you can't get to
[58:14] first base now I know but I I I was at a
[58:17] a baseball match up there with brother
[58:19] Ron Spencer and uh I think it was his
[58:22] nephew or something was playing the
[58:23] baseball for the the school and we went
[58:25] to see it and I learned more lessons
[58:27] that night about I didn't know really
[58:29] but I learned some lessons you know and
[58:30] I know one thing if you hit that ball
[58:32] right and goes right of the out of the
[58:33] stadium well you got a home run baby it
[58:36] you know amen so I learned that much
[58:39] praise God and and of course you got
[58:40] your popcorn and all that there but I'd
[58:42] never bother with that that wasn't amen
[58:45] hallelujah and so he said you'll never
[58:47] get rid of first Beast Until you realize
[58:50] that that this that is supreme deity
[58:52] speaking to you every day amen and and
[58:55] taking the time to speak to you every
[58:58] day Hallelujah and so the first of all
[59:00] Revelations amen and you must know I'm
[59:03] going to spend a little bit of time here
[59:04] but not much but you must know who he is
[59:07] and when you hear his voice that's it
[59:10] like Samuel you know Samuel didn't know
[59:12] who it was and and and and and and Eli
[59:14] says no go lie down and he call him
[59:16] again he didn't still know and and the
[59:18] third time Eli was spiritual enough to
[59:20] realize look there more than just man
[59:22] here he said the next time he speak say
[59:24] Speak Lord
[59:25] for thy servant and that's your theop
[59:27] that's what he was standing on cuz the
[59:28] Lord stood there amen praise God he
[59:31] wasn't an invisible God at that moment
[59:33] he was in a theophany and he speaks to
[59:35] Samuel all what was going to happen amen
[59:38] and the same voice sounded on Mount
[59:40] Sinai the same V voice sounded on the
[59:43] Mount of transfiguration uh the same one
[59:46] one like onto the son of man amen right
[59:49] there in Revelation 1 and what is it it
[59:51] was the revelation of the Supreme deity
[59:53] amen being God himself no Hallelujah and
[59:58] you know where where where brother
[59:59] brandham talked about the in the church
[1:00:01] ages about uh Luther's time you know
[1:00:04] that was a wonderful move of God in
[1:00:05] Luther's time but the trouble was with
[1:00:08] his move is that so many just wanted to
[1:00:11] leave the Catholic Church get out of it
[1:00:13] they seen the Ridiculousness and there's
[1:00:15] people that got uh still moving out of
[1:00:17] it amen a lot of Catholics in Ireland
[1:00:20] have been shaken to the core about what
[1:00:22] they were doing with the children so
[1:00:24] amen and so uh a lot of them just left
[1:00:27] to do that and and not because they had
[1:00:29] a spiritual uh H uh thing with God no
[1:00:33] they just left with the rest amen it was
[1:00:35] the thing to do get out of that
[1:00:37] Blackness and and and you know and and
[1:00:39] it says that a brother Bram here he
[1:00:41] quotes it he says amen that he says that
[1:00:45] uh you have a name that you live but
[1:00:48] you're dead amen what a thing to say you
[1:00:51] have a name that you live amen praise
[1:00:53] God but you're dead right Hallelujah
[1:00:55] well he doesn't say that to this age he
[1:00:56] talks about the the lyan uh uh day amen
[1:01:00] lukewarmness in the churches and all
[1:01:02] that but not of the Bride Hallelujah
[1:01:04] he's talking to the Overcomers here you
[1:01:06] know and if you read the book of of uh
[1:01:09] The Song of Solomon come away my love my
[1:01:11] fair one my do that's not the Ludy in
[1:01:14] church AG that's the bride in the ludan
[1:01:16] church AG amen and so we're we're so
[1:01:18] thankful amen and and and and you know
[1:01:21] that was why why was that the god
[1:01:23] brother George because that's when they
[1:01:26] lost the deity of Jesus Christ they lost
[1:01:29] the name Hallelujah and they did it they
[1:01:32] did it and brought in a tri God at the
[1:01:35] Council of n that's what they did now
[1:01:38] the thing about it is this amen praise
[1:01:41] God uh uh to lose the name what they had
[1:01:44] I remember I I I I I had the book and
[1:01:47] you still get it on the internet today
[1:01:49] on the life of Columbo by adaman and
[1:01:52] adaman at that beginning of that book he
[1:01:55] says greetings in the name of the Lord
[1:01:57] Jesus Christ and that's the way he's
[1:01:59] writing the book and I think wow that's
[1:02:01] wonderful cuz you have not denied his
[1:02:03] name but amen before his life was ended
[1:02:07] and the Romans had made so much uh and
[1:02:10] Ina into Britain amen they got him to a
[1:02:14] point where they got him to change
[1:02:15] Easter and they got him to a point where
[1:02:18] he denied the name and he went to father
[1:02:20] son Holy Ghost well I'll tell you when
[1:02:22] he went back up to Iona how Hallelujah a
[1:02:24] lot of the monster wouldn't going to
[1:02:26] have that amen said if Columba taught it
[1:02:28] it was right and we believe it and you
[1:02:30] can go and do whatever you want but
[1:02:32] we're staying with what he said well
[1:02:34] that's that's wonderful but the name was
[1:02:36] lost amen it was lost Hallelujah and and
[1:02:39] the thing about it is amen hallelujah uh
[1:02:42] right here at this age praise God here

[1:11:45] we're exactly the same bride amen and
[1:11:47] he's ministering he's not ministering to
[1:11:49] one greater than another one or Sat one
[1:11:51] up higher than another one we're all the
[1:11:53] family of God the saints of God and the
[1:11:55] Bride of Jesus Christ amen and I love
[1:11:58] that and so here he was and and they
[1:12:01] missed it the Egyptians missed it the
[1:12:03] the Philistines missed it with Samson
[1:12:05] that his hair grew again amen and three
[1:12:08] times woo three times Moses raised that
[1:12:12] Rod Hallelujah and they didn't know what
[1:12:14] was happening they didn't know and you
[1:12:16] know when when it's a wonderful thing
[1:12:18] I'm not going to talk about the devil
[1:12:19] today but but woo amen there's only
[1:12:23] about times in the Bible that he's
[1:12:24] actually recorded as saying anything but
[1:12:26] you know amen we're not going to talk to
[1:12:28] him today but he he missed this he
[1:12:30] didn't know it was going on and when
[1:12:33] when brother Bram could look at you
[1:12:34] people and say the devil doesn't know
[1:12:37] what to do with you he can't handle you
[1:12:39] Hallelujah you've overcome him he knows
[1:12:42] you beat him Hallelujah he knows it he
[1:12:45] walks back there and said to all them
[1:12:47] demons they can't Lord we can't do it we
[1:12:49] can't break through that bloodline we
[1:12:51] can't break through that Holy Ghost amen
[1:12:53] and and it's wonderful so I I think
[1:12:55] that's a wonderful thing for to be told
[1:12:57] that the devil doesn't know what to do
[1:12:59] with me I'm sure he
[1:13:01] doesn't done tried many things you know
[1:13:04] praise God but Hallelujah and three
[1:13:06] times it's recorded bringing the plagues
[1:13:08] over the egyptions my raise up your Rod
[1:13:11] over that and and strike the river or
[1:13:13] whatever amen and and and he did it
[1:13:16] Hallelujah and something happened amen
[1:13:18] and uh then praise God when josa was
[1:13:22] fighting amen sorry when they crossed
[1:13:24] the Red Sea again don't cry speak just
[1:13:27] raise up that Rod again and tell them to
[1:13:29] go forward Hallelujah not backward
[1:13:31] forward Hallelujah and so there then
[1:13:34] when josa fought the amalekites and and
[1:13:36] he would had the rod up and he got he
[1:13:38] was older getting tired and so they got
[1:13:40] a rock s him on it and held up his hands
[1:13:43] while that Rod was there and the victory
[1:13:45] was given three times it's recorded that
[1:13:47] he did that there amen no Hallelujah and
[1:13:50] the Victory came and when he did that
[1:13:52] the final Victory but listen to this
[1:13:55] amen we've got a rod far greater than
[1:13:59] what Moses ever had we have got the name
[1:14:03] restored back to us the name of the Lord
[1:14:06] Jesus Christ restored back to us
[1:14:09] hallelujah and that'll do more than
[1:14:12] raising the Lord over anything but but
[1:14:14] that was God's way but now we've got the
[1:14:16] name and we don't use it enough
[1:14:19] Hallelujah we don't find the devil
[1:14:21] enough brother Ram says amen and we
[1:14:23] shoot because not let them get the
[1:14:25] victory over you Hallelujah no
[1:14:28] Hallelujah and so what a what a thing
[1:14:31] amen the Roman came and said to uh I
[1:14:34] said to Jesus now uh when when jarus
[1:14:36] came he said come and lay your hands on
[1:14:38] my daughter amen but when the Centurion
[1:14:41] came he recognized something and it's
[1:14:43] good to recognize hallelujah amen you
[1:14:47] know I didn't finish that story about
[1:14:48] the little deaf girl because on the
[1:14:50] second night when she was there I looked
[1:14:52] down and I said my that's that's faith
[1:14:54] and I went down and you know you know
[1:14:56] the scripture says it that Faith worketh
[1:14:59] by love and it means it it really means
[1:15:02] it Faith does work by love and and I
[1:15:05] looked down and I said well that's
[1:15:06] amazing that death girl and her mama's
[1:15:09] brought it again tonight well I'll go
[1:15:11] down and pray again tonight Hallelujah
[1:15:13] only this time it was different amen as
[1:15:16] I went up to that girl started to pray
[1:15:19] for her hallelujah amen what happened
[1:15:21] was I could feel a lovely sweetness come
[1:15:24] down and a love that went out amen for
[1:15:27] this child that was stricken in this way
[1:15:30] Hallelujah and I'll tell you what when
[1:15:32] we prayed for her amen and just as I
[1:15:35] finished praying she let her yell
[1:15:38] hallelujah amen and and and she run out
[1:15:41] of the place and I never knew it till a
[1:15:43] red brother R him on it amen he said
[1:15:45] that's what happens sometimes they've
[1:15:47] never heard for years and years or
[1:15:48] whatever maybe from birth I don't know
[1:15:51] but it wasn't me that opened her ears
[1:15:53] praise the Lord but by just giving the
[1:15:56] gift of faith Hallelujah and I'll tell
[1:15:58] you what folks you know when them things
[1:16:00] happen you don't need to wait for the
[1:16:02] Holy Ghost to come down he'll fall and
[1:16:05] he fell in all the people and people
[1:16:07] were falling all over the place he said

[1:16:12] was only there I seen it in Africa too I
[1:16:15] was only there when it happened amen and
[1:16:17] it was wonderful amen and and and and I
[1:16:21] I better go on I'll just leave that
[1:16:22] there can say a little more but I won't
[1:16:23] amen so praise God and that lovely name
[1:16:26] to have it amen what a name amen praise
[1:16:29] God in my name you shall cast it as a
[1:16:31] matter of fact the Bible says not only
[1:16:32] cast out devils and and I've done it
[1:16:34] many times amen but uh and and seen the
[1:16:38] sick heal from it but I'll tell you what
[1:16:40] amen the Bible says this and how could
[1:16:42] anybody believe in anything else when it
[1:16:45] says everything you do do all in the
[1:16:47] name of Jesus Christ now what that
[1:16:49] that's kind of Nar we better there don't
[1:16:51] it Hallelujah so you can't do nothing
[1:16:54] you can't receive your your drink of
[1:16:55] water you can't do nothing other than in
[1:16:58] the name of Jesus Christ amen and of
[1:17:00] course we know uh that is who the father
[1:17:02] Son and Holy Ghost is amen but that was
[1:17:05] to be a test for them amen no and so

[1:17:12] he said I can say that Soldier yep and
[1:17:14] he said now you speak Lord it'll happen
[1:17:17] and he said I've never found greater

[1:17:21] got that name oh my what a wonderful
[1:17:23] thing amen you know I just say this very
[1:17:24] quickly brother because some of you may
[1:17:26] heard this and some of you might have

[1:17:36] thought well we're going to have some
[1:17:37] Sport with this American evangelist and
[1:17:39] so he challenged him amen uh to prove
[1:17:43] his power and so he said now I'm going
[1:17:45] to do something here and I want you to
[1:17:47] undo it and brother B I'm listening very
[1:17:49] carefully mhm and he lifted the
[1:17:52] table off the floor he lifted the table

[1:18:21] and Holy Ghost come down
[1:18:23] nothing happened and know he was really
[1:18:25] smiling ey amen but then that Prophet
[1:18:28] you could just imagine him if you could
[1:18:29] see what it would be like he would just
[1:18:31] get real and the hers in his face would
[1:18:33] stand out and he would just tilt over
[1:18:35] and he would just turn around without
[1:18:36] Authority and he would say in the name
[1:18:39] of Jesus Christ come down Hallelujah and
[1:18:42] that table hit the floor so hard and
[1:18:44] nearly broke it amen there's the power
[1:18:47] that's what you've got never be afraid
[1:18:49] to use that name everything Lord I ask
[1:18:51] it in the name of of Jesus Christ amen
[1:18:54] so Hallelujah no and uh amen this coming
