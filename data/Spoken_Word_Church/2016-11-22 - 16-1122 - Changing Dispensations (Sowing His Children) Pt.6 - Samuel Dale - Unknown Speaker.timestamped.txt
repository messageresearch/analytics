[1:46] to see everybody in the house of the
[1:47] Lord if you'd like to turn in your
[1:48] scriptures turn where we've been reading
[1:50] in Ephesians
[1:52] 1 and then we'll go to Matthew 13 which
[1:56] is the scriptures we we're using some
[2:00] day and had to cause of company and
[2:03] things move over just a little bit but
[2:05] drop back in tonight and pick up our
[2:06] thought and we'll continue on because I
[2:09] don't like to just when somebody comes
[2:11] in I don't like to just drive on I've
[2:14] told you about that cuz you do that and
[2:17] and the people don't know what you're
[2:18] talking about hard to understand us
[2:20] anyway but then when you do that but I
[2:22] try to do it that way okay so we just
[2:24] thank you and I mean you know thank you
[2:26] for putting up with us and and all and
[2:28] changing it now remember as Terren said
[2:32] don't come tomorrow night cuz if you do
[2:34] there probably won't be nobody here you
[2:36] know but that's uh you know and on the
[2:39] internets and the things I hope they got
[2:41] to change over we try to do everything
[2:44] and I come out here every Sunday see and
[2:48] repeat most of the announcements you
[2:51] know to where to make sure that we we
[2:54] get it in the right order and all like
[2:56] that so just remember no service
[2:58] tomorrow night but then remember that uh
[3:02] I think the next would be the bible
[3:04] study on the 5ifth or not what is it not
[3:07] the fifth what is a Bible study it's on
[3:09] the first Saturday that be the third
[3:13] okay and then remember the eight
[3:15] together time for Christmas okay and
[3:18] remember brother fory will be with us
[3:19] the Lord willing ministering the watch
[3:22] not service so pray for him and the
[3:24] things that he still needs his license
[3:26] the last account I found from him was he
[3:30] hasn't got his license yet they uh you
[3:32] know they something through the way the
[3:35] doctor done that and then when the
[3:38] doctor got back into it the doctor don't
[3:40] want to sign it but he' already put
[3:42] forth and done everything but all it
[3:44] needed was his signature and that's the
[3:46] best I can understand he just didn't
[3:48] want to clear it up and go on he wanted
[3:50] him to go through some more tests well
[3:52] sister Johnny can tell you about that
[3:54] when you do like that and it happens it
[3:56] it ties up a lot of things all right you
[3:59] know and they don't want to put their
[4:00] hand of signature to the point okay but
[4:03] just pray for him God will give him that
[4:05] I can tell you a story about him I think
[4:07] it was was see he went to he was a bus
[4:08] driver to get his license for a bus
[4:10] driver he didn't even know period by a
[4:14] bus you know and really he was just
[4:17] seeing what to
[4:18] do and he walks in you know and talks to
[4:21] the people and the guy said just come
[4:23] right on over here and he just filled
[4:25] out his license from a bus driver and he
[4:28] didn't you know he he never even done
[4:31] nothing he just walked out with his
[4:33] license for bus driver you know so God
[4:36] can take care of a lot of things he he's
[4:38] a good God Amen all right just pray for
[4:41] him that the Lord would bless him father
[4:42] we thank you for your love and your
[4:44] grace unto us we thank you for
[4:46] everything and Lord we've come together
[4:48] tonight as T not a little early from our

[4:56] everything Lord and traveling backwards
[4:58] and forth so we we do the best we can to
[5:00] just try to help everybody and because
[5:03] we want to do right in that way Lord and
[5:06] and we're just concerned with the people

[5:20] grace as we read your word you come and
[5:22] speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen
[5:26] hey Ephesians
[5:32] one verse 8 wherein he hath abounded
[5:35] toward us in all wisdom and Prudence
[5:38] having made known unto us what the
[5:40] mystery of his will according to his
[5:43] good pleasure which he ha purposed in
[5:45] himself that in the
[5:47] dispensation of the fullness of times
[5:51] you know the end of all things has now
[5:53] come upon you and I so we ought to be
[5:54] able to believe in the the dispensations
[5:58] of where we're at is the point
[6:00] they might gather gather in one all
[6:02] things in Christ both which are in
[6:05] heaven and which are on earth even in
[6:09] him all right let's go over
[6:12] to
[6:14] Matthew 13 verse 37 remember this is
[6:18] explaining the parable of the S of the
[6:21] seed and he answered and said unto them
[6:24] he that sth the good seed is the son of
[6:27] man the field is the word
[6:30] the good seed are the children of the
[6:32] Kingdom but the tires are the children
[6:35] of the wicked one the enemy that sowed
[6:37] what the tires now not the good seed
[6:39] that what he sowed them is the devil and
[6:43] the Harvest is the end of the world and
[6:44] the reapers are the Angels you may be
[6:47] seated the Lord have
[6:48] his way with the reading of the word now
[6:52] I want to make a couple announcements
[6:54] tonight and I'll redo it
[6:56] Sunday so remind me to do
[7:00] that because we've been you know we
[7:02] we've kind of get slack about things and
[7:06] you know we we run into problems and all
[7:10] and we just kind of drift along and I've
[7:12] just always been that way I'm not one I
[7:15] I couldn't be uh they tried to get me to
[7:17] be a boss at where I was at Y and cotton
[7:20] mill I couldn't do that and I went to to
[7:23] I was work to Georgia Chair Company they
[7:25] were training me for that and I just
[7:27] couldn't do it when it come down for the
[7:29] time of General Motors they tried to get
[7:32] me to do everything there and I wouldn't
[7:33] do it cuz I'm not one I know you think I
[7:37] am but I'm just not one to rules rules
[7:42] rules and
[7:43] regulations I I'm not that way and I'm
[7:46] sorry and that kind of lets things float
[7:49] around to where that you have trouble
[7:53] now take what I'm saying and let it go
[7:56] okay we're coming up to the Christmas
[7:59] time
[8:00] time we always have a Christmas time for
[8:03] the people of the church all right now
[8:06] that Christmas time is dedicated for the
[8:09] people at the church those who call this
[8:13] their Church home okay it's not to say
[8:16] tithe payers or this that or the other
[8:18] because it it's you know you get into
[8:20] the kids you get into no it's for the
[8:22] people who count this their Church home
[8:26] we try to have a Christmas time to tell
[8:29] them our
[8:30] appreciation the giving of gifts for
[8:32] their offices and and things you know
[8:35] and and all of the things to try to do
[8:38] to get them to do that but I wish you
[8:42] would consider that on doing things and
[8:45] I'm just saying it see don't invite
[8:49] someone to come on those specified days
[8:53] that we said aside I'm just I'm not you
[8:55] said well you don't want them saved no
[8:58] see you get upset with him and go go
[8:59] ahead just remember you got all other
[9:03] the year to invite them why invite them
[9:04] that one day you can invite them any
[9:07] other time you have any other time or
[9:09] all the other time I'm just saying for
[9:11] that day only it's good to not invite

[9:23] have and you know and we and and we say
[9:27] it in love if you take it wrong you're
[9:29] you're the one we give away you know
[9:32] quite a few thousand at
[9:34] Christmas as gifts to people that's what
[9:36] we want to do that's always been my
[9:38] desire My Desire is not to save nothing
[9:41] I've always told you if I had taken the
[9:43] money that was due me from this church I
[9:46] would be a multi-millionaire that's no
[9:48] joke you know it's true that because you
[9:51] know what I've done we've took it in
[9:53] that way we can help the missionaries we
[9:55] can not have to worry about things we
[9:57] can help each other and do it cuz that's
[10:00] always been my desire all right but see
[10:03] we give gifts and we give them to those
[10:06] of the ones who count this their Church
[10:09] home those who work labor and do the
[10:12] things you know teachings and all of the
[10:15] things the ministers the deacons and all
[10:19] we we try to do that to show you our
[10:23] appreciation now we always have done and

[15:01] and everything will be right okay now
[15:05] there's been some confusion that I've
[15:07] been aiming to approach this and I just
[15:08] didn't CU like I said I don't like those
[15:11] things of rules there's been some
[15:15] confusion even about the property that
[15:18] brother Donnie and I lease for deer
[15:21] hunting now brother Donnie and I at
[15:23] least that we have never asked a dime
[15:27] from anybody we pay the full expenses
[15:30] we've asked you to come if you're going
[15:32] to hunt with us and put up stands and
[15:36] work and you know help us plant the
[15:38] stuff and
[15:40] everything we've never asked you to do
[15:42] anything other than come and help us we
[15:44] pay the full expenses we pay the full
[15:47] expenses of the fertilizer the seeds the
[15:49] thing we do that you say well I thought
[15:53] that you know see back years ago you
[15:57] thought I was paying the leas is from
[16:00] the
[16:03] church a lot of you didn't know it
[16:05] brother Donnie's always paid ever since
[16:08] we started leasing he's always paid High
[16:10] the
[16:12] bill we just didn't say nothing about it
[16:15] because he said Let It Go so we just you
[16:18] know we invite you to come and Hunt we
[16:20] invite the church people to come and
[16:21] Hunt but don't you go invite somebody to
[16:24] come and hunt you see where we get in we
[16:27] get us in trouble I mean we've we're
[16:29] inviting you to come hunt we take you
[16:31] hunting we'll go with you we'll put you
[16:33] on the stands I love it they life make
[16:37] fun of me we hunted in a hunting club
[16:38] one time and I put five people on
[16:44] deer that year alone and never killed a
[16:48] thing five good Georgia deer brother
[16:52] call got a big old 12p pointer you want
[16:54] to see the pictures of that
[16:57] one see
[17:00] we try to do what we can to help you say
[17:02] well I thought that it was the church no
[17:04] it's never been the church it's brother
[17:06] Donnie and I you said well we gave you a
[17:08] raise to take care of well did we give
[17:10] brother Donnie a raise to take care of
[17:12] his uhuh uh uh uh that come out of my
[17:16] money that comes out of my tax money
[17:18] that goes on my tax status and you
[17:21] didn't know it for all those years that
[17:23] always fil the
[17:24] taxes is one sitting right here we just
[17:27] don't say things we we kind of let it to
[17:30] be you know but you see the point you
[17:34] can't just say well I'm going to invite
[17:35] so and so check it with brother Donnie
[17:38] and
[17:40] I and then we'll look at those things if
[17:45] we got the room if we ain't got too many
[17:46] people hunting or whatever we doing
[17:49] we'll do everything cuz we want you to
[17:50] hunt it's
[17:52] there but don't get the idea that the
[17:55] church is paying for it so we're the
[17:57] church so we think we ought to have a
[17:58] right to use it because we're the church
[18:00] it's not the church paying for
[18:03] it it's never been that
[18:06] way brother Donnie just didn't want me
[18:08] to tell what we was
[18:10] doing but we've it's the way it's always
[18:12] been done okay see now that get those
[18:15] things clear off of our mind see you
[18:18] just don't go and invite somebody ask us
[18:22] and we'll
[18:23] invite and we will take care of them I
[18:26] love it I tell you I do it I've tooken
[18:28] many a time people put them on three or
[18:30] four stands and I'd be well after
[18:32] daylight get into my stand and a lot of
[18:35] times I'd just go sit down
[18:38] somewhere but the Lord's always blessed
[18:41] me I got a brother-in-law he's crazy as
[18:44] can be he'll take 10 people and put them
[18:46] in the woods he'll go sit down over
[18:47] somewhere by sale but he'll kill more
[18:50] deer than you will because it's just
[18:53] it's meant out way okay get those out of
[18:56] the way we get into the message all
[18:57] right see I don't Like rules and
[19:00] regulations I don't like to have to make
[19:04] statements because it hurts people's
[19:07] feelings well if I do I'm
[19:10] sorry but the statement is made so let's
[19:12] go from there okay now we're talking
[19:17] about changing
[19:19] dispensations we're talking about that
[19:22] there's been so many different
[19:23] dispensations all the way through and
[19:26] what I've been dealing with lately is
[19:28] the dispensation of the son of man the
[19:32] main thing I want you to
[19:34] see the son of man dispensation you
[19:37] would count that all if you're just
[19:39] saying a prophet if you're just saying
[19:41] Jesus was a prophet look what you're
[19:43] leaving out to me the son of man
[19:47] dispensation and where he was at and
[19:49] what he was doing now listen is the most
[19:53] important dispensation of the entire
[19:57] Bible
[19:59] because there will be nothing
[20:02] else if the son of man dispensation is
[20:05] not brought in
[20:08] order
[20:09] right you say well the Son of God and
[20:12] I'll give you brother BR he's inherit of
[20:13] all things right
[20:15] amen but you know there wouldn't be a
[20:17] Son of God to come and live in your soul
[20:19] today if the son of man had not given
[20:22] his life on
[20:24] Calvary
[20:26] right you see it's where it's at you see
[20:29] why we spent so much time talking about
[20:30] him as being a
[20:32] savior as being a
[20:35] redeemer as being God in
[20:41] flesh as being almighty God
[20:44] Amen that God was in Christ reconciling
[20:47] the world to
[20:50] himself and see then by doing that we
[20:53] can come down to the basis of
[20:55] seeing what part the son of man played
[21:00] in the Plan of
[21:02] Redemption you see where you'd be with
[21:05] the people of the message and 90% of the
[21:07] people click on right now and you say
[21:09] son of man that's a
[21:11] prophet you don't even read Matthew Mark
[21:14] Luke and John to see what that son of
[21:17] man was
[21:19] doing and would
[21:21] do and has continued to
[21:24] do and that's why he's got to return
[21:27] back in the end time amen
[21:30] as not just a son of
[21:33] man not just I'm going to be plain blunt
[21:36] not just brother brandom as a
[21:39] prophet that doesn't fulfill it that's
[21:42] right but he did have a what he came and
[21:45] brought us the
[21:48] message the message to
[21:52] be so everything is related to him
[21:58] you think I'm just saying this no the
[22:01] entire thing is related to the fact of
[22:03] whether or not Jesus Christ was almighty
[22:06] God all
[22:09] right and why he would call himself son
[22:13] of
[22:16] man brother brandham said I know twice I
[22:19] was looking at it today he said they
[22:21] didn't understand why he'd say
[22:25] that well do we understand why he said
[22:28] that
[22:29] then you don't
[22:33] listen Matthew Mark Luke and John deals
[22:36] with the writing of the life of the time
[22:37] of Jesus Christ
[22:39] right but none of the Apostles even John
[22:42] and them the writing of
[22:45] it John is the only one that has any
[22:49] connection to the son of man when he
[22:51] went to patmas and comes forth in
[22:53] chapter one and sees one La unto the son
[22:56] of man G about the PS and sees the
[22:59] the rest of them said nothing about it
[23:01] the great Apostle Paul in all of his
[23:05] teachings says nothing about doesn't
[23:07] mention son of
[23:12] man sure he knew who he was and what he
[23:15] was for he tells us about the Redeemer
[23:17] The Advocate the The God Who come in
[23:20] human flesh he tells all about that but
[23:23] why didn't he talk about him as son of
[23:26] man and like I said it see why would the
[23:29] Lord Jesus walk out there in the first
[23:32] of his ministry and start talking about
[23:35] son of
[23:37] man I still got another message to
[23:39] follow
[23:42] this but then why with brother
[23:47] brandham in 48 was the earliest I found
[23:50] where he mentioned son of man you
[23:54] know in 48 he starts talking about son
[23:57] of man
[23:59] I mean that's just an early record that
[24:01] we
[24:02] have there's no telling what he preached
[24:05] before then you know that was not
[24:06] recorded that's what's
[24:08] recorded isn't that very
[24:11] odd that he starts out with son of
[24:18] man why are those things there and
[24:21] what's the
[24:23] purpose e the son of man would have it
[24:26] while I was bringing it up Sunday but it
[24:28] just brought it up in a little different
[24:29] way to where I wanted to get and stopped
[24:32] off we're talking about the son of man
[24:36] and who he was the Savior the Redeemer
[24:39] the all and all the you know the
[24:41] fullness of the godhead bodily dwelling
[24:43] in
[24:44] him who in that man that walked on the
[24:47] shores of
[24:49] Galilee that
[24:51] body was created
[24:56] right that body had a
[25:02] beginning it was created not be it did
[25:05] it had to have a Redemption we'll read
[25:07] it in the minute not because he was
[25:09] sinful but because that he had a
[25:12] beginning God never had a
[25:16] beginning Son of God doesn't have a
[25:21] beginning see but people don't
[25:24] understand the
[25:25] godhead that's why you got all these
[25:27] River Jordans in these ideas see they
[25:29] look at him is like well there he was he
[25:31] just Body Spirit and soul of
[25:33] man and then he comes over here in his
[25:35] ministry and he gets up over here and he
[25:38] gets over there and all at once God just
[25:40] comes down and then God leaves him and
[25:43] lets him
[25:45] die now you ain't got no
[25:48] Bible but yet your people this Glory
[25:54] Hallelujah but you see then we become
[25:56] hot balls like we done it I know two
[25:59] times go one certain brother was up
[26:00] preaching in a certain meeting and
[26:03] everybody in the building was rejoicing
[26:05] and you could look down the line where
[26:07] we were sitting in a line and we were
[26:09] all sitting
[26:12] there but the problem was the next time
[26:15] it was done a certain brother wanted to
[26:18] make me
[26:20] comfortable and he pull my seat out in
[26:23] the
[26:27] aisle and when I sat down I was like a
[26:30] sore thumb and everybody in the building
[26:33] screaming and hollering about the idea
[26:36] and I'm sitting
[26:39] there I give an amen every once in a
[26:41] while something like good
[26:43] amen but you see that's why I believe in
[26:45] one true and living God to believe in
[26:47] one true and living God then that would
[26:50] have to be the thing that we brought out
[26:51] in the Life few services that who was
[26:54] that in body he was a man a creation
[26:58] amen but his soul was the very soul of
[27:01] almighty
[27:04] God it wasn't another soul that
[27:07] something happened to that soul and then
[27:09] this happened to that and his Spirit was
[27:11] the spirit of almighty
[27:14] god well you know what that makes him
[27:17] the fullness of the godhead
[27:21] bodily
[27:23] right they don't Seated on the River
[27:25] Jordan an anointing came on him for his
[27:29] ministry Amen to that you know brother R
[27:32] said that made him to
[27:34] fullness was that anointing but you know
[27:36] what that anointing left him in the
[27:40] garden Holy Spirit never left him in the
[27:42] garden or he
[27:43] dead his soul didn't leave him his
[27:46] Spirit didn't leave him that went out on
[27:49] Calvary he said into thy hands I Comm in
[27:52] my spirit right brother R said what he
[27:55] said his body went to the Grave he said
[27:57] his Spirit went back to God who gave it
[27:59] he said his soul went to preach to those
[28:02] souls in
[28:04] prison he said his soul his being his
[28:07] person of his
[28:11] theophany went to hell for you and I
[28:14] there is one true and living God that
[28:17] way you ain't got no problems with the
[28:18] Bible and who he's talking well I just
[28:21] don't understand because he speaks here
[28:23] and over here he speaks that's what I
[28:25] trying to bring out in that adoption
[28:26] series
[28:29] see no matter what you
[28:32] are you realize it ain't going to get my
[28:36] message tonight but you
[28:39] realize that all of your
[28:42] life that part of you that was called a
[28:45] soul a being a nature whatever you want
[28:47] to call
[28:48] it was motivated and directed into the
[28:52] line of this
[28:55] world right R around and say said those
[28:58] demons those angels that fell with Satan
[29:01] he said they give us a nature
[29:05] right now you think the day you got born
[29:08] again that that just clean out
[29:10] everything and you don't never have no
[29:11] more thoughts you don't never have no
[29:13] more problems you don't never have no
[29:15] more
[29:20] troubles you agree that you
[29:23] do all right then listen to see if you
[29:26] agree with this he lived that too that's
[29:30] right and even though he was almighty
[29:33] God the world and the
[29:36] things worked upon him the same as it
[29:39] works on you and I he oh no it didn't
[29:41] well then who was it when he was taken
[29:43] into the Temptation in the wilderness
[29:45] was
[29:47] Satan who was he that brother ROM would
[29:49] say he could be tempted he said even by
[29:54] women who is that could be tempted
[30:00] it certainly couldn't be the very God
[30:02] cuz my Bible said God cannot be tempted
[30:05] and that he tempts no man amen
[30:08] right see that
[30:11] body that's why he would be called a Son
[30:14] of
[30:16] God we see we look at the Son of God as
[30:19] a second person instead of looking at as
[30:21] Son of God as being God coming
[30:24] down did he send his son no he came
[30:27] himself amen amen but see that's just
[30:29] too simple for people they can make the
[30:32] great glorious thoughts and we just Oh
[30:34] Glory did you hear
[30:37] that
[30:39] well what about the
[30:43] truth is it the truth right
[30:47] amen well we just can't understand them
[30:49] things but this is what I think okay
[30:54] Glory but listen
[30:59] his life that he
[31:01] lived motivated him to the basis of who
[31:04] he was you agree he had to eat he had to
[31:10] sleep right he Gran with a headache when
[31:12] he raised who was it the little boy from
[31:15] the dead or
[31:16] something said he sat on a rock and
[31:19] grown with a
[31:20] headache that was that
[31:22] man and it don't matter how much you are
[31:25] born again
[31:29] the nature of that soul is gone
[31:33] yes but the rest of that being is still
[31:37] in a human element that's right and will
[31:40] be until the day the change comes that's
[31:43] right so the Plan of Redemption is not
[31:45] over
[31:47] yet it's going to take a connection to
[31:50] the son of man we even got there we got
[31:52] to go through the church ages now from
[31:54] where we're at we got to go through Son
[31:56] of God before we can come back the son
[31:58] of
[32:05] man but listen
[32:08] Church what about what this son of man
[32:11] plays in our
[32:14] Redemption we read this Sunday but I
[32:17] want to start back over on it so I go
[32:18] ahead with number
[32:21] one and let's just see what brother
[32:23] Brown said on the Revelation Chapter 2 I
[32:26] think what yeah 1961 Revelation chapter
[32:29] 5 right part number two
[32:32] 61 he said Jesus the name Jesus in The
[32:35] Gospel has four titles now remember he
[32:38] has three names Son of God Son of Man
[32:41] son of David but in the Bible he has
[32:44] many many titles Rose of Sharon lily of
[32:48] the valley bright and Morning Star so
[32:50] why would you have a prophet I mean have
[32:52] a problem with a prophet when he'd say
[32:54] there's four
[32:56] titles all right you're say Glory we
[32:59] know a little bit about it we found out
[33:01] something about another title that we
[33:03] didn't understand look at him said four
[33:06] titles of son did you know that Jesus
[33:09] has four titles as son in the gospel one
[33:11] of them is the son of David we know what
[33:14] that's for right where it goes one of
[33:17] them is the son of
[33:19] Abraham see that was his
[33:23] title he was the Seed of Abraham right
[33:28] he was before
[33:31] Abraham right but
[33:33] look one of them is a son of David one
[33:36] of them is the son of Abraham another
[33:38] was the son of man and another one son
[33:40] of
[33:42] God titles to his name now pull it on
[33:45] that where we because he talking about
[33:46] the Redeemer and how he come you read it
[33:49] as the son of David he's the air to the
[33:52] throne till he gets that in the
[33:54] Millennium he Jesus Christ not David
[33:59] the son of David sits on the throne in
[34:00] the Millennium not
[34:02] David it was promised to David to sit
[34:05] there but David's he's flat ain't going
[34:07] to walk up there and say boy bless God
[34:09] I'm here I'm I'm King he's going to know
[34:12] who it's really talking about well
[34:13] that's reserved for it ain't him look
[34:16] what he
[34:18] says as the son of Abraham he's there to
[34:21] the Royal
[34:23] Grant and what is the Royal Grant I'm
[34:26] glad he explains it he's an N to the
[34:28] Royal Grant Palestine and all that's in
[34:32] her Abraham's seed I thought we were the
[34:37] Seed of Abraham by
[34:40] faith am I right are we the Seed of
[34:43] Abraham by faith then the son would be
[34:46] relation to Abraham as you and I to have
[34:49] Palestine the say as anybody else come
[34:53] on look he was the son of Abraham I'm
[34:56] watching as a son of man what does son
[35:00] of
[35:01] man what did man
[35:04] lose watch it oh we lost this we loost
[35:07] come on just stay with him stay with me
[35:10] and don't run too
[35:13] far what does son of man what did man
[35:16] lose he lost the Earth right so as the
[35:21] son of
[35:22] man he's the heir to the earth I mean
[35:25] he's heir to everything in the Earth
[35:27] Earth all this he's got and he has to
[35:31] give it back to
[35:33] us so then who are we going to
[35:36] be we're going to be air to the Earth
[35:39] right well are we not related to son of
[35:41] man
[35:43] then
[35:44] [Music]
[35:47] oh there got to be some relationship to
[35:49] the son of man if we're going to be a
[35:52] come on I ain't the one that wrote it
[35:53] little brand you'll see them in a minute
[35:54] I got it in one of them he said that
[35:56] that sons of God was meant to be
[36:03] gods and the Earth is our rulership
[36:07] Heaven is for God the Earth is for man's
[36:10] rulership right come on going to give it
[36:13] back to us brother R said everything
[36:15] Adam lost Jesus Christ
[36:18] redeemed okay amen
[36:21] now evidently he hasn't given it all
[36:24] back to us yet
[36:29] right go outside and kick that dog
[36:32] that's over there at the neighbor you
[36:33] might find out you ain't back where you
[36:35] thought you back
[36:37] to right come on he has to give it back
[36:41] to us then he's returning back as he
[36:43] was oh then he's returning back as he
[36:50] was the son of
[36:52] man he's now then as the Son of God he
[36:56] inherits all things
[36:58] as a son of David he's our to the throne
[37:00] as son of Abraham he's our to the Royal
[37:02] gr as son of man he's our to the Earth
[37:05] as Son of God he's our to all things in
[37:08] heaven and in Earth so you can see we've
[37:11] got a way to go go we got to get to that
[37:14] and has got air of everything we just
[37:16] now dealing with air to the
[37:20] Earth in our Redemptive plan
[37:25] right watch him he's air of all
[37:31] things what did this son of man
[37:34] lose he lost the
[37:38] Earth well then the Earth's got to be
[37:42] redeemed
[37:44] right now just remember the Earth had a
[37:47] beginning and remember anything has a
[37:49] beginning it'll have an ending to
[37:55] it only that's eternal
[37:58] will be
[38:00] forever all right so then where are we
[38:03] what are we talking
[38:06] about Jesus himself had a
[38:09] beginning go ahead with number
[38:15] two Hebrews chapter
[38:17] 7
[38:19] 1957 and this male chesed was not
[38:23] Jesus then
[38:25] watching for he was God
[38:28] God and what who is God mzc
[38:32] right and what made Jesus and God
[38:38] different oh we're not
[38:40] trinitarians neither was he
[38:43] right what made him
[38:45] different see Jesus was the tabernacle
[38:49] that God dwelt in amen the flesh right
[38:54] see now mdic
[38:59] and watch it Jesus had both father and
[39:06] mother right now remember I've explained
[39:10] that to you
[39:12] before it wasn't a father and a mother
[39:15] like we
[39:17] think his father is almighty
[39:21] God the Creator his mother is the
[39:25] word not a woman
[39:27] amen Eve was not the mother of
[39:31] God
[39:33] right the word was the mother of God the
[39:37] word was the wound to
[39:40] bring forth the
[39:44] body well I don't get that well didn't
[39:46] pray about it cuz you tell me how I can
[39:48] be any other
[39:50] way Jesus had both father and
[39:53] mother and this man never had father or
[39:56] mother
[39:57] okay Jesus had a beginning of
[40:00] Life and he had an end of
[40:04] life what about who's he talking
[40:07] about well he talking about the second
[40:09] person that was over here you know the
[40:11] first person and the second see let's
[40:14] get away from our trinitarian ideas and
[40:15] let's get some
[40:17] thoughts Jesus had a beginning of Life
[40:20] and he had an
[40:21] end this man had no father no mother no
[40:25] beginning of days or end of life
[40:28] but it was the selfs same
[40:32] person who's mesic God Almighty in human
[40:36] flesh who's Jesus Christ God almighty in
[40:38] human flesh mzd is not his
[40:42] name his name is Jesus cuz that's the
[40:46] only name the father ever
[40:47] had was Jesus cuz he said I come my
[40:50] father's name okay watch MDC and Jesus
[40:54] was one
[40:58] but Jesus was the Earthly body born and
[41:01] fashioned after
[41:04] sin and say he was sinful now come on
[41:06] the Bible doesn't say that he knew no
[41:08] sin became sin what sin my sin come on
[41:13] right watching God's own
[41:19] body his own son born and fashioned
[41:23] after sin look to take the sting out of
[41:26] death
[41:27] to pay the ransom and to receive Sons
[41:30] and Daughters unto himself you get it
[41:34] that's the reason he had he had a
[41:36] beginning he had an ending
[41:39] why so he could
[41:44] die take the sting of death pay the
[41:48] price the
[41:50] body
[41:52] right then his body was made Eternal in
[41:55] the resurrection right right amen all
[41:59] right and here's one in communion go
[42:02] ahead and 28 we'll just read these down
[42:03] and
[42:06] all see these I had Sunday so I reading
[42:09] I put a 2A and a 3A and I'm that the
[42:11] other
[42:12] okay communion
[42:14] 1965 I it was sah no it was Joseph
[42:18] listen the other night said to me said
[42:21] me and brother Perry said daddy where
[42:24] when did God come on the S
[42:28] where did he come from see he had to
[42:31] have a beginning didn't he didn't he
[42:34] have to
[42:35] start and a little boy watch you I said
[42:39] no I just a little boy asked him
[42:42] question anything that has a beginning
[42:45] has an
[42:47] end but it's that which had not a
[42:50] beginning has no end but of course he's
[42:53] 10 years old he said that's a pretty
[42:56] good mouth he's asking questions
[42:59] right but he explaining it why anything
[43:02] that has a beginning has an
[43:04] ending so his body had a
[43:10] beginning his body was not
[43:13] Eternal it was made Eternal in the
[43:16] Resurrection The Chain
[43:18] ascensions now his body's Eternal amen
[43:22] right all
[43:24] right because that is the body of God
[43:26] because it's the blood of God right
[43:29] that's why man had nothing to do with it
[43:31] now watch him as he gets over here we've
[43:33] been through this before but I want you
[43:35] to see it go ahead to number three
[43:37] taking for the future
[43:39] home you talking about when he come out
[43:41] out of the water I saw the heaven open
[43:43] the prophet saw it he saw the heavens
[43:45] open and then here come descending Out
[43:47] of Heaven a form of a dove and a voice
[43:51] saying now we know the voice of saying
[43:54] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[43:56] pleasing to dwell right but what did
[44:00] that voice
[44:02] say now if you make this anything
[44:05] contrary to the
[44:08] Bible you're
[44:10] out but if he's explaining what the
[44:13] Bible is saying we're
[44:16] in now that's to me is the between the
[44:22] lines which not meaning something
[44:24] written in between the lines we need
[44:26] something secret to be able to find it
[44:29] it's something written that we need to
[44:32] have the Holy Spirit to interpret that
[44:35] to
[44:36] us as to see the in
[44:39] between are you with
[44:41] me watching Prophet saw it and a voice
[44:46] saying this is my part of the
[44:49] earth and remember this is River
[44:52] Jordan that I have redeemed and from
[44:55] this part of the Earth
[44:57] I'll redeem the rest of
[45:01] it my part of the earth that I've
[45:05] redeemed
[45:09] right now watch him as we get on later
[45:11] where he talks about even the city
[45:13] coming down the different night but just
[45:15] remember it don't change what's taking
[45:18] place this this is my this is my part of
[45:21] the earth that I have redeem from this
[45:22] part of the earth I'll redeem the rest
[45:24] of it for he is my word made
[45:28] manifest that's John 1:14 right and the
[45:32] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[45:35] right look what he says I spoke it into
[45:41] existence by my word what his
[45:46] body now we'll get to it in a minute the
[45:48] world was spoken into existence by the
[45:50] word right we're dealing with the
[45:53] body watch I spoke it didn't existence
[45:56] by my word he
[45:57] Satan has held the not the body of Jesus
[46:00] Satan's held the world right all this
[46:03] time I come to redeem it so much of it
[46:05] has made his body and I'm coming to
[46:07] dwell in
[46:08] it and what about God explaining
[46:11] something so wonderful through a
[46:15] prophet that we don't have to wonder
[46:18] what that
[46:22] meant we don't have to try to comprehend
[46:26] what that meant
[46:28] we can read what it
[46:30] meant it meant that there was a human
[46:34] sacrifice a human body a body created by
[46:38] God himself Hebrews
[46:40] 10:5 a body th has prepared
[46:43] me and that body would be our savior Our
[46:47] Redeemer all the things and he would
[46:49] come and live in that body to pay the
[46:52] price so that he could be released from
[46:54] that body to be the Redeemer
[46:58] now watch in a minute what happened to
[47:00] him there something happened to him on
[47:02] the River
[47:03] Jordan that is
[47:10] wonderful look John said I saw the holy
[47:13] city new to Jerusalem sending out of
[47:15] heaven
[47:16] born John he goes over to patmas to pick
[47:19] up the scripture but he's talking about
[47:21] Jesus on
[47:25] Jordan right
[47:32] patmas you know coming down out of
[47:35] Heaven 21 or what it is and he's putting
[47:38] it right into the River
[47:46] Jordan John talked about the city
[47:48] descending Out of Heaven as a bride ofor
[47:50] and where did it settle
[47:53] on just exactly like it did on D
[47:57] upon the
[47:58] Earth it settled on the redeemed Earth
[48:01] there but where did it settle that back
[48:02] there that's right on Jesus
[48:06] Christ the redeemed Earth and so John
[48:09] saw the holy city the New
[48:13] Jerusalem Jesus was part of that Earth
[48:18] that the Holy Ghost descended
[48:20] upon and he's got just to explaining the
[48:25] city no Holy Ghost the River Jordan is
[48:28] that right and remain upon him
[48:31] forever now watch this one where they
[48:33] said they left him in the I don't
[48:36] know it never can leave
[48:39] him it's always there he and God are one
[48:43] always has to remind he said but I just
[48:46] caught you because you were talking
[48:47] about that the anointing left Jesus in
[48:50] the garden you've always preached that
[48:51] to it amen and I still do the anointing
[48:54] is what left you not the life of God
[48:59] he's talking about the life of
[49:01] God that's right the Holy Spirit came on
[49:03] him that Holy Spirit left him on
[49:07] Calvary
[49:09] amen not in the garden it was the
[49:12] anointing for Ministry left him in the
[49:13] garden we've been through that cuz
[49:15] that's promised to come back in the end
[49:18] time there isy son of man if you get
[49:21] it
[49:23] look he and God are one always has to
[49:25] remind so John saw the holy city the New
[49:30] Jerusalem descending on a like a or a
[49:33] dove coming down out of
[49:35] Heaven settling setting Upon A redeemed
[49:39] Earth redeemed entire Earth to do what
[49:43] to claim every attribute he made the
[49:46] Earth
[49:47] far he's still on the River Jordan
[49:49] that's right every man that was
[49:51] represented in eternity every woman is
[49:53] redeemed in she has been scared didn't
[49:56] burn out by the fiery Temptation bring
[49:59] it up think of it the Holy Ghost
[50:01] descending upon
[50:03] Earth
[50:06] Jesus and that Holy
[50:09] Blood now watch and I hope you don't
[50:12] don't go too
[50:13] deep for you see the Holy Blood that was
[50:17] created by God the blood the life the
[50:21] creation of
[50:22] God Jesus was the beginning of the
[50:25] creation of God
[50:27] amen the one standing on
[50:32] Jordan right oh you see God made in
[50:38] creation he was Spirit the Bible said
[50:40] he's the beginning of the creation of
[50:42] God how did he
[50:44] begin back in Genesis where this began
[50:47] to no no that ain't th that's got its
[50:49] own
[50:50] story where did he begin in the wombs of
[50:54] a woman which is what
[50:57] the woman is not
[50:59] the the beginning of the creation of God
[51:02] started in the wound of a woman I've
[51:04] explained to you what I think he said he
[51:05] said wounds if you'll go to spoken words
[51:08] read no seed you'll find out that Eve
[51:10] had a virgin mind and a virgin wound
[51:13] there's your two
[51:15] wounds virgin mind wouldn't have brought
[51:17] it virgin wound wouldn't have brought it
[51:19] yet have them together so maybe he knew
[51:21] he what he was talking about Mary I said
[51:24] okay but Jesus was the beginning of the
[51:26] creation of
[51:29] God but Jesus had to die that's
[51:34] right I told them to hold their notes
[51:36] back there cuz I didn't know which way
[51:38] I'm
[51:41] going I'm going to go which way I want
[51:43] to go and then we'll get back to the
[51:44] rest
[51:45] of what about this
[51:48] man that we call
[51:51] Jesus this body we call Jesus
[51:57] that had a beginning with the wound of a
[52:03] mother and it had an ending when it
[52:05] ended on
[52:07] Earth hanging on Calvary and the life
[52:10] went out of
[52:13] it
[52:14] right so he had a beginning he had an
[52:20] ending he was almighty God in flesh the
[52:24] flesh was a creation
[52:28] the beginning of the creation of God now
[52:29] you know we've been through it I Y got
[52:31] it in here come on you know it he's the
[52:33] beginning of creation we're the
[52:34] continuation of the creation so come on
[52:36] that's where we got to get down to where
[52:37] we're at to get to the Sea and the point
[52:39] but I want you to see something here
[52:40] before we go any further and if we have
[52:42] two willion right
[52:45] here what about this one that walked the
[52:48] shores of
[52:50] Galilee that they would even
[52:53] say never a man
[52:57] spake like this man you remember that in
[52:59] the
[53:00] scripture never a man spake like this
[53:05] man why because there was never a man
[53:08] like
[53:10] that that's why the Bible calls him the
[53:13] only
[53:16] begotten the word was made flesh and
[53:18] dwelt Among Us the only begotten amen of
[53:22] God
[53:29] he had a beginning because he started in
[53:32] the wound of a
[53:34] mergin that God created egg and
[53:39] sperm he was just an incubator to bring
[53:42] forth that's why he didn't call her
[53:44] mother he didn't call her woman I mean
[53:46] he called her woman he didn't call her
[53:49] mother now don't be silly I've always
[53:51] thought people I'm just I don't like to
[53:53] be this way but that's the way I am and
[53:56] you you mean he was a little bit baby he
[53:57] run around war war war now he' have
[54:01] probably got knocked across the
[54:03] room you don't like that kind of
[54:05] language for me but you tell me
[54:07] something else he called her
[54:12] mother but when he entered his
[54:15] ministry she come up to that
[54:18] point she had already even rejected him
[54:21] by saying your father and I he said I
[54:23] got be about my father's business
[54:27] he called her
[54:29] mother come
[54:33] on but when he entered the point of
[54:37] understanding he called a
[54:40] woman when he knew where he come from
[54:42] and what he was doing he called her
[54:46] woman my
[54:48] mother goes it was no longer a
[54:52] mother you see he had a beginning of
[54:55] Life a time that he
[54:58] again he the body the
[55:02] man the man Christ
[55:06] Jesus the only body that God ever
[55:09] had that's what I've tried my best to
[55:12] preach it to you for 40 50 years
[55:15] now you say yeah but you make God this
[55:18] too much like a man my Bible says he was
[55:20] a man my Bible says Hebrews 7:4 I think
[55:24] it is it says m was a
[55:29] man if he built a man in Genesis
[55:33] 1 in the order of him in a spiritual
[55:37] creation would not the physical creation
[55:41] be in the order of who he was and what
[55:42] he was come
[55:48] on he said but you you just you just
[55:50] make him too too
[55:52] tangible you mean he created you and you
[55:56] can think about how tangible something
[55:59] is like this and think it's more
[56:01] tangible than he is remember this come
[56:05] by the word of
[56:07] God he created it so he's got to be more
[56:11] tangible what I've always tried to
[56:13] preach the godhead for people to try to
[56:16] get you to
[56:20] understand to see the one true and
[56:22] living
[56:23] God and see what it means and what he
[56:26] does
[56:28] God came down in a human flesh he didn't
[56:31] send a son he stepped down himself right
[56:34] that was the very soul of almighty
[56:37] God that was inside of that flesh and
[56:40] the Very Spirit of almighty God was
[56:42] inside of there now he didn't just have
[56:45] a spirit and then the spirit of God in
[56:48] him no he was the
[56:50] spirit you say but but but if he was the
[56:54] spirit he wouldn't be tempted you CL
[56:56] claim to have the Holy Spirit how can
[56:57] you be tempted solves a
[57:01] problem you see we think we're so
[57:04] smart but what about
[57:06] him Jesus had a
[57:09] beginning he was the beginning of the
[57:12] creation of
[57:17] God no no Adam was there's where you
[57:20] missing
[57:24] it it's not least of Adam that he's the
[57:27] beginning of the creation of God it's
[57:28] listed of Adam he's the beginning of the
[57:30] creation of the human race
[57:35] right he was the first son by creation
[57:38] Jesus was almighty God by
[57:45] begotten that's what I've always tried
[57:47] to get you to see look at it correctly
[57:50] here's a
[57:53] body the Soul and Spirit of God God
[57:56] steps into that
[58:01] body he's Son of God Son of Man son of
[58:04] David Son of Abraham bright and Morning
[58:06] Star alpha and omega beginning end Rose
[58:08] of Shar and Lily of the Valley he's the
[58:11] all in
[58:15] all but he changed
[58:17] dispensations to make a
[58:21] way go remember now I cut this part out
[58:25] I'll bring it back back in another
[58:26] message of how Adam was because Adam was
[58:29] God's first created son and he created
[58:32] Him special I won't try to go that way
[58:35] tonight we'll go Sunday onto
[58:38] that cuz come on I ain't the one that
[58:40] said it brother Randon says it
[58:42] Blasphemous
[58:44] names that Adam had eternal life and you
[58:48] argue with brother brandom do what you
[58:49] want to that's out on the Internet or
[58:52] anywhere he's the one that said it go to
[58:54] blasphemian names and get he said
[58:56] especially into
[58:57] Adam he said he made him an eternal
[59:03] person well then I I guess that's right
[59:05] we all come with eternal life no the
[59:07] fall put us in a
[59:11] problem but Adam
[59:14] fail we'll have to get to that later
[59:17] this is the point I want tonight just to
[59:19] get it to where we'll think about
[59:23] it what about this one
[59:28] it had a
[59:29] beginning began in the wound of a
[59:33] mother brought a body
[59:35] forth he had an ending hanging on a tree
[59:39] and the life left out of the
[59:42] body that body was
[59:48] dead it wasn't just something playing
[59:50] around he's waiting for three days
[59:52] hiding
[59:53] something and he was dead amen
[59:58] which dead means there's no life right
[1:00:02] he's
[1:00:03] dead the Soul and Spirit came out of the
[1:00:06] body the soul went to hell to preach to
[1:00:08] the spirits in prison come back up by
[1:00:11] paradise and picked up the Old Testament
[1:00:13] Saints the spirit went back to God who
[1:00:15] gave it he come and picked up those Old
[1:00:18] Testament saints that stood on
[1:00:20] Earth in a
[1:00:21] body sure I know what he said he said
[1:00:24] Mary don't touch me cuz I'm not yet
[1:00:26] ascended it wasn't
[1:00:28] complete but then about 2 minutes
[1:00:31] later he went up and come back right you
[1:00:35] could handle him do what all you wanted
[1:00:37] to and it was a glorified body amen an
[1:00:41] immortal Eternal glorified body
[1:00:46] right yet he could eat
[1:00:53] right no problems with that they
[1:00:56] shouldn't be CU that's been the Bible
[1:00:58] World know that in the
[1:01:00] Baptist you say that's a disgrace to us
[1:01:02] loow you're a
[1:01:03] disgrace thank you you ought to be
[1:01:07] because you ought to listen back
[1:01:09] then we studied these things we we
[1:01:12] believed in in that but we just couldn't
[1:01:14] get it straightened out how many persons
[1:01:15] we had that's it right there no we
[1:01:18] couldn't I told you over and over you go
[1:01:20] to the Baptist Church and ask them
[1:01:22] what's your Doctrine we believe in one
[1:01:24] true and living God
[1:01:28] God you say explain it well it's got in
[1:01:31] three
[1:01:32] persons that's all they do because he
[1:01:34] don't know how to explain
[1:01:37] it but
[1:01:40] listen he was the beginning of the
[1:01:42] creation of
[1:01:45] God and he had to make a way that you
[1:01:48] and I could become the children of
[1:01:54] God don't brother around said he's the
[1:01:56] beginning of the cre we the continuation
[1:01:57] of that creation right what is it is it
[1:02:00] God in human flesh is any
[1:02:04] problem is any problem with you thinking
[1:02:07] about yourself in a born again
[1:02:09] experience that that God is living in
[1:02:11] your soul and that you are an amateur
[1:02:15] God Amen and lost your right in the
[1:02:17] garden to ruling the
[1:02:21] Earth but at least you ought to have the
[1:02:23] rulership of the Soul
[1:02:30] but remember what your Prophet said if
[1:02:32] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:02:34] God with a continuation so there's got
[1:02:36] to be a made way made one day that we
[1:02:38] can come back Body Spirit and soul
[1:02:44] Eternal but we're not finishing the plan
[1:02:46] until then but this is what I want I let
[1:02:48] you go early just for this I hope I will
[1:02:51] I said that
[1:02:53] but go ahead to number 3A and let's just
[1:02:56] read something that your Prophet had to
[1:02:59] say about this
[1:03:03] man and what happened to this
[1:03:07] man we find that he was our kinsman
[1:03:09] redeemer and he took the book out of the
[1:03:12] hand of the original owner it is a title
[1:03:15] deed to Redemption we found that you
[1:03:17] remember the study it's a title deed to
[1:03:19] Redemption it's an abstract deed with it
[1:03:22] that God required life for death in the
[1:03:25] Garden of Eden was death is our he
[1:03:27] required life to come and give it then
[1:03:29] Jesus the righteous one
[1:03:32] died and took a title deed and was able
[1:03:36] to break the
[1:03:39] seals reveal what was in them and give
[1:03:43] the inheritance that belongs to him to
[1:03:46] his
[1:03:51] people now read the rest of that
[1:03:56] eternal
[1:03:58] life that he
[1:04:00] inherited by doing
[1:04:05] that by doing
[1:04:08] what that he could give the
[1:04:11] inheritance remember your Prophet said
[1:04:15] what he said Jesus never gave me an
[1:04:18] inheritance he said my inheritance was
[1:04:21] eternal life before the foundation of
[1:04:22] the world but said he come to make a way
[1:04:25] that had inheritance could come to me
[1:04:27] that's
[1:04:32] right Jesus made a way that the
[1:04:34] inheritance could
[1:04:36] come but that wouldn't just what
[1:04:38] happened this is a story go look what
[1:04:41] happened and give the inheritance that
[1:04:44] belong to
[1:04:46] him to his
[1:04:49] people eternal life that he
[1:04:53] inherited by doing that
[1:04:57] right now who inherited eternal life boy
[1:05:00] that's the reason you can't explain this
[1:05:01] message to anybody that trinitarianism
[1:05:03] or
[1:05:06] anybody remember his body was made
[1:05:09] Eternal in the resurrection amen so he
[1:05:11] did inherit eternal life but how to come
[1:05:14] it come because of doing what he
[1:05:18] done by doing what he done he gave his
[1:05:22] life right right and by the re W for him
[1:05:26] giving his life God gave him eternal
[1:05:28] life and the
[1:05:29] Resurrection come on he passed his own
[1:05:33] life back out at Calvary and divided it
[1:05:38] Among Us by the Holy
[1:05:40] Ghost see all you could get at Calvary
[1:05:43] was the Holy Ghost to come back
[1:05:50] right come on his body was redeemed
[1:05:52] right there on on River Jordan and he
[1:05:55] said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:05:56] pleased to
[1:05:58] dwell he was redeemed right there but
[1:06:01] three and A2 years later before it was
[1:06:03] ever made
[1:06:04] manifest or it could be brought into
[1:06:06] manifestation or
[1:06:09] expressed
[1:06:11] right you realize then the day you
[1:06:13] received the new
[1:06:15] birth your body was redeemed
[1:06:20] amen but it's just not made manifest yet
[1:06:29] I thought we believe the Bible those who
[1:06:31] Justified if already glorified I thought
[1:06:34] we believe the Bible sure that's what
[1:06:37] he's saying but that's that's where we
[1:06:39] ought to get around to something that we
[1:06:40] can start
[1:06:45] saying one we were talking about on the
[1:06:48] proving his word is where he says talk
[1:06:50] about that this is the beginning of the
[1:06:52] creation of God this is the the he's the
[1:06:56] beginning of creation god with this
[1:06:57] creation but look what it says said the
[1:06:59] Holy Ghost come down at the fire baptism
[1:07:01] and claim this
[1:07:03] creation talking about go ahead and pull
[1:07:06] that one up pull number for I'm sorry I
[1:07:08] said I didn't know get started on
[1:07:10] something I can't quit no you go home
[1:07:12] early if you want to I'll see you later
[1:07:15] Happy
[1:07:17] Thanksgiving I'm not upset when nobody I
[1:07:20] just preach you just do whatever you're
[1:07:23] LED of God to do I'm just trying to
[1:07:25] preach preach the
[1:07:26] truth see you go through water baptism
[1:07:29] then Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy
[1:07:30] Ghost comes down at the fire baptism and
[1:07:33] claims his
[1:07:35] creation the Holy Ghost comes down into
[1:07:38] the fiery baptism and claims this
[1:07:43] creation oh that's just a soul if he
[1:07:46] claims a soul that takes care of the
[1:07:51] body if you claim the body you got to
[1:07:53] deal with the soul find out what's going
[1:07:54] to take place but if you deal with a
[1:07:56] soul you come on look the same as it did
[1:08:03] him through the fiery baptism came down
[1:08:06] on him on the River
[1:08:08] Jordan and redeemed his body claimed it
[1:08:13] when you receive the new
[1:08:17] birth your body is
[1:08:20] claimed cuz if not folks you're going to
[1:08:23] have to get you another one amen now you
[1:08:26] see where the people of the messages
[1:08:28] went with it and all all organized
[1:08:30] religion basically believes you're going
[1:08:32] to get a new
[1:08:33] body they don't believe in
[1:08:36] Redemption
[1:08:40] look come through water baptism then
[1:08:42] Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost
[1:08:44] comes down at the fire baptism and
[1:08:46] claims his creation you say but that's
[1:08:48] the headstone I'm glad you said
[1:08:51] that cuz you just trapped yourself
[1:08:59] because there is to be a fiery baptism
[1:09:02] but if we ain't build up to th it ain't
[1:09:04] going to land on
[1:09:05] us all right see you trap Yourself by
[1:09:08] your own thoughts you ought to listen
[1:09:11] sometimes it didn't think
[1:09:13] later that didn't work too
[1:09:18] good the same as it did him claims this
[1:09:21] creation the same as it did him what
[1:09:23] happened to River Jordan claimed his
[1:09:25] body right three and a half years later
[1:09:28] or something to that degree he comes to
[1:09:31] a change so what are we worried about if
[1:09:34] we got 70 something years what are you
[1:09:35] worried what you wor sister C in 90
[1:09:38] years why it make no
[1:09:41] difference the day you receive the new
[1:09:44] birth he claimed your body that's
[1:09:47] right it's just waiting to be made
[1:09:50] manifest his was waiting three and a
[1:09:52] half years of horrible time look the
[1:09:55] Holy Ghost and God is the self is the
[1:09:57] same spirit and it comes down and claims
[1:09:59] this body for the
[1:10:02] resurrection Holy Spirit comes on you as
[1:10:04] a new birth claims his body see then
[1:10:06] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:10:07] God and with the rest of that creation
[1:10:13] okay let me get one more I wanted these
[1:10:17] two to come together read number
[1:10:19] five CU this is what I was trying to
[1:10:21] express to you the other
[1:10:23] day Christ a Myst of God
[1:10:27] I'm going to lay them down cuz I ain't
[1:10:28] going in the rest of there okay but what
[1:10:31] he wanted to do he L
[1:10:34] fatherhood he loved
[1:10:37] fatherhood or he was a
[1:10:41] father and the only way that he could
[1:10:44] express it bring it forth into
[1:10:48] manifestation
[1:10:50] right was to
[1:10:52] become a son of man
[1:10:59] that's the reason Jesus kept saying the
[1:11:01] son of man why because he
[1:11:06] was expressing a
[1:11:10] father he didn't know what he was
[1:11:12] talking about but now you get it
[1:11:14] congregation holler
[1:11:17] amen he wanted to express himself that
[1:11:20] was his one of his great attributes and
[1:11:22] that to identify in human beings but
[1:11:24] think about it
[1:11:27] now what you remember I tried to hear a
[1:11:29] while back to preach on it a little what
[1:11:32] in the world is brother around talking
[1:11:34] about that the only way he could express
[1:11:38] the fact of him being father was to be
[1:11:40] the son of
[1:11:47] man he the only way he could be
[1:11:50] father the way he wanted to be
[1:11:53] father Adam
[1:11:56] was a wonderful
[1:11:59] creation but not
[1:12:02] Eternal except in his soul then when
[1:12:05] that was lost mankind we'll pick this up
[1:12:07] Sunday when that was lost mankind comes
[1:12:10] all
[1:12:11] lost no eternal life and soul until the
[1:12:13] new birth am see he wanted a special
[1:12:18] creation he was the beginning of the
[1:12:20] creation if he was the beginning of the
[1:12:22] creation you know what that means do you
[1:12:24] know what it means when you say he's the
[1:12:26] beginning of the creation that means
[1:12:27] they got to be the rest of the creation
[1:12:29] somewhere are you saying it wrong it
[1:12:31] would say he's the creation Now when he
[1:12:34] said he's the beginning of the creation
[1:12:36] and that's Revelations what 3:14 isn't
[1:12:41] it what about a
[1:12:46] bride what about it
[1:12:50] folks you said well how did the son of
[1:12:52] man do this I thought we read the
[1:12:57] scripture that the son of man was the
[1:13:00] Ser of the
[1:13:05] seed and he sold the children of the
[1:13:07] Kingdom amen that's right which was his
[1:13:15] word you see where he started his
[1:13:18] family come on now you're going to be
[1:13:20] upset and follow it along if you won't
[1:13:22] get
[1:13:22] it see in the Old Testament was never
[1:13:25] the creation that God
[1:13:27] wanted it was never his intentions for
[1:13:30] those to happen that
[1:13:33] way he had to do it on the basis of
[1:13:36] allowing it to be done to bring forth
[1:13:39] the problems and the things but that was
[1:13:41] not his way of wanting to be
[1:13:45] father he was father by creating Adam
[1:13:50] right you know that everybody in the
[1:13:52] world today by God's creation
[1:13:55] is a Son of God
[1:13:59] right tell me who we're sons of what if
[1:14:01] it ain't him bringing us
[1:14:03] life everybody in the world adol Hitler
[1:14:06] you want to call
[1:14:08] it is a Son of God by natural creation
[1:14:12] because God is the only one that can
[1:14:14] bring a creation Satan can't
[1:14:17] create so all of that Old
[1:14:20] Testament as great as those people were
[1:14:23] as great as could happen
[1:14:25] still there was not what God
[1:14:28] wanted God wanted a family like
[1:14:32] himself so he just made sure you
[1:14:34] remember the quotes we gave the other
[1:14:35] night where brother rown said he didn't
[1:14:37] trust his Plan of Salvation with nobody
[1:14:40] else you remember that now ain't that
[1:14:43] something if there was trinitarianism
[1:14:45] somebody ought have got offended on
[1:14:47] that because if he didn't trust it with
[1:14:49] them you know that means they're not as
[1:14:51] equal as he is and then your Baptist
[1:14:53] will be out because they call them
[1:14:55] father son Holy Ghost co-equal and
[1:14:56] co-eternal so if you're co-equal
[1:14:58] everybody's supposed to know the whole
[1:14:59] story but if you don't know the whole
[1:15:01] story you've missed the problem you see
[1:15:03] where our trinitarianism is
[1:15:07] gone or should be
[1:15:10] gone he started a family right
[1:15:14] there he was the head of that family he
[1:15:17] was the one I've got him laying here in
[1:15:19] front of me but it take too long what
[1:15:22] about him speaking you into existence
[1:15:29] I just want to say this and we'll come
[1:15:30] back to it Sunday what about him
[1:15:32] speaking sister Gil you into
[1:15:36] existence now what's he talking about
[1:15:39] well Mom and Daddy brought you and
[1:15:42] that's not exactly what he's talking
[1:15:43] about speaking you into existence
[1:15:45] because we're going to go back where he
[1:15:46] said it like this brother R said he
[1:15:48] spoke you into existence before the
[1:15:52] foundation of the world
[1:15:57] poke you into
[1:15:59] being come on read the parable the
[1:16:02] parable is what the son of man is the S
[1:16:05] of the
[1:16:06] seed right the seed is the children of
[1:16:09] the
[1:16:11] Kingdom the other seed is the children
[1:16:13] of
[1:16:15] Satan
[1:16:17] right he brought them into being the
[1:16:21] biggest problem was that's where you and
[1:16:22] I was all at we was all in that cat
[1:16:24] category of what he brought into being
[1:16:27] not that he could create us and bring us
[1:16:28] in now God created he perverted
[1:16:32] us perverted us and made us to work but
[1:16:36] the beginning of the creation of God was
[1:16:37] the Lord Jesus
[1:16:39] Christ if you and I are any part of that
[1:16:42] creation and that's the Revelation to
[1:16:43] the seventh Church age is that he's the
[1:16:46] beginning of the creation of
[1:16:48] God and if we're the rest of that
[1:16:50] creation as he just said proven his word
[1:16:55] and truly he spoke us into
[1:16:57] existence cuz come on he spoke him into
[1:17:04] existence right right God spoke Jesus
[1:17:09] Christ into or Jesus as we'll call it
[1:17:12] the flesh to be holding it right CU you
[1:17:14] get Christ and it goes off he spoke
[1:17:17] Jesus in the beginning in in his own
[1:17:20] mind and then when he come into the
[1:17:22] world he spoke him right
[1:17:27] said Mary he said the holy spirit will
[1:17:29] overshadow
[1:17:33] you he spoke him into
[1:17:36] being now something's got to happen to
[1:17:38] finish the rest of the story because the
[1:17:41] rest of the story is that we've got to
[1:17:43] wind up in this story of redemption to
[1:17:46] have what the Bible said a body like
[1:17:49] unto his exactly right glorious body
[1:17:53] amen so we better be thinking about why
[1:17:56] a prophet would have to
[1:17:59] come and emphasize so
[1:18:01] much about people speaking the
[1:18:06] word and the Bible would not say brother
[1:18:09] Brandon would not say William brandom
[1:18:11] and Lord Jesus was the only one that
[1:18:14] could say unto this mountain it even
[1:18:17] covers it listen you listen to brother
[1:18:19] rown it even covers that to whosoever
[1:18:27] what about it Church come on these s
[1:18:29] what about
[1:18:32] it he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:18:34] God you're and I are the rest of that
[1:18:37] creation listen he was what God wanted
[1:18:41] ever son Adam was only an example of
[1:18:46] what he
[1:18:47] wanted he was ruler of the earth
[1:18:50] controller he was God of the earth he
[1:18:52] was all the things but he lost that
[1:18:54] position
[1:18:56] but Jesus Christ redeemed that position
[1:18:59] to bring it back to every son and
[1:19:01] daughter of God and come forth and speak
[1:19:03] the word
[1:19:06] amen I thought the emphasis of this
[1:19:10] message was the prophet trying to get
[1:19:12] the people to speak the word if you
[1:19:17] say but see we've got it if he said it
[1:19:20] I'd believe it why don't you believe
[1:19:22] that
[1:19:24] come on you trap yourself see you say if
[1:19:26] brother Brown said it I believe
[1:19:28] everything he said that's exactly like
[1:19:29] the children of Israel when they said
[1:19:31] God you tell us what to do and we'll go
[1:19:32] do it they were Liars right to the teeth
[1:19:35] you said you call me a liar no God
[1:19:39] did do you put all the emphasis up the
[1:19:44] prophet up at gains were years
[1:19:47] ago certain brother I won't call his
[1:19:49] name because some sudden here was there
[1:19:51] probably was the old bar bar Cafe what
[1:19:55] is it what was that big bear the one you
[1:19:58] know going out we were sitting there and
[1:20:02] this brother had brought a message about
[1:20:05] prophets of course his message was that
[1:20:09] he was the chief White
[1:20:12] Eagle I knew exactly what he was
[1:20:15] saying he was saying that he was chief
[1:20:17] White
[1:20:19] Eagle Brothers found it out later matter
[1:20:22] of fact I can tell you where they were
[1:20:23] at when they found it out
[1:20:26] they were
[1:20:28] overseas they found out that that man
[1:20:30] was saying that but he kept
[1:20:32] saying and he kept making this
[1:20:36] statement and after a
[1:20:39] while it just something inside of me
[1:20:41] rung a
[1:20:42] bell I don't care what you believe man
[1:20:46] you're off you've missed it I don't
[1:20:48] agree with you but said you made a
[1:20:51] statement you know that brother randam
[1:20:53] said he just come to make way for the
[1:20:58] Eagles how would you like that
[1:21:06] quote what's your Prophet said did he
[1:21:09] come to make way for the
[1:21:13] Eagles I thought we were little
[1:21:16] eaglets that's right I thought we were
[1:21:19] little
[1:21:21] Messiah you know what I didn't go home
[1:21:23] feeling bad I went won't happy I thought
[1:21:26] Lord
[1:21:28] hey I don't believe what that man saying
[1:21:30] but he sure struck home of
[1:21:34] quote that there's going to be eaglets

[1:21:43] being stand for before it all finishes
[1:21:46] up it going to be little Messiah am now
[1:21:49] may I say it this way where you'll
[1:21:52] think remember what I asked you to
[1:21:54] Listen to I ask you to listen to
[1:21:58] Masterpiece and see how far your Prophet
[1:22:01] went on the Masterpiece and where he
[1:22:03] stopped and then I ask you to go to

[1:22:08] he picked up right where he left off on
