buddy house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn to Hebrews 6 where we've been reading it I know brother board has announced but remember the fellowship time dammit tarek start the chicken house in in the play time and all with the children and I remember that and make sure that you bring you a chair to sitting in coach you know you may need to do it and why he said you better bring you a coke because it may be a little cool they gets up late the evening so remember that time and keep that in your prayers and then just not to the children um listen some of you been seen out there only our conditioner units climbing around on top of them I don't do that you can get hurt okay you know you can get hurt climbing around in places that you don't need me do it okay you get enough on the units and climbing around and doing tight and you know the bigger ones sometimes playing with a little kid stuff just you know make it right and do everything right you know and all I Kevin don't don't let it be something to where you turn up something on and then it's now parents if somebody corrects your child whether out in the parking lot I mean in the playground and you're not out there taking care of your children then now you don't be children okay and get your feelings hurt become someone that's corrected your child because they're trying to do it for the best of evolved and you know especially now getting out and getting on the units and thing that can be very very dangerous for you to follow and those units can fall and hurt people okay so just make sure you don't do that honey brother their legend you know it but to we've got to be straight and try to keep you protected you know helping you amen Hebrews 6 Lord Jesus we thank you for an opportunity of gathering here tonight we pray that you would just bless us with your presence and understanding Lord that we may come to the place of understanding you because that's the main thing because we can understand you then all is well with us and father it's you that was trying to hit that is trying to reveal yourself into it and to make yourself manifest among us come down and do that tonight with healing perjures and power Lord just bless each one bless those that are not here remember the reasons and take care of each one we love you and we commit everything into your hands we were hard to reach your word as we read your word then you come and speak to our hearts about that of what we need to say to the people have your way now and Goddess forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness in Jesus name Amen now we're going to read six versus tonight we've been just reading the first three verses we're going to read Hebrews 6 we're going to read six verses therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and a faith toward God of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and a resurrection of the Dead none of eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit part is not possible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and we're protected mayport acres from the Holy Ghost and I've tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again in repentance seeing that crucified to themselves to some got a fresh and put him to an open shame and you may be seated below head is blessing to the reading of the word now the this a very odd statement to make Wood Brothers please give those that that the Apostle Paul here is making to us we've covered a couple of messages about it trying to get an understanding and to see that we've had to go on in the Word of God now Paul was not saying leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ in other words let's destroy this let's get rid of that we don't need that anymore in no way could he say that when he was saying that the word you know there is the only thing that can take care of us but what did we find that he's saying he's saying that we must go on and not sit down on something in the Prophet called it that she look he said the Pentecost was cabbage down on the gift sometimes me and go on to perfection huh I mean that we we realized that he's speaking of a place or something to attain unto that were not at because when you say you know let us go on unto perfection it means that you're not at the place that you're saying are you wouldn't say let us go on you would say we're here you know we're here perfection p and he wasn't saying that and the prophet of God comes along and verifies the things to us that you know showing us the perfection that we need to go home unto all right now there's a rapture to be had in this last days you know a card away a change of these vile bodies you see we have enough time that yet All Right see what your sensible people we're not trying to do I remember years ago Amanda a big man you know to have it big name he comes lives hard row out and fixed it all up this way and begin to preach what they called in mortality in the flesh but you know that didn't make him a day younger no I mean that didn't happen one bit he could try to make it look good you can get facelifts not like that and that's your business i'm not wrong it's wrong to do I'm just saying that it's not going to make you any younger to get face-lift you know if they ever find a place to be able to change lives may be with my be able to you know we might talk about something to flop around but it's not going to do any good you know you can make yourself look younger and do whatever you want to but it doesn't make you a day younger they just miss to do it but the Apostle Paul was as I've tried to explain in no way was he saying leaving the pretzels of the doctor and a crashing and go like we think the because you can't leave the principles are the beginnings they will always be with you because they're the foundation that we stand on the one guard to water baptism the need the things but we must go on because if we don't go on then we can never see the truth of what has been tried to be said unto us you know that we need to to obtain to a higher place I gave you a quote in there where brother and said Powell's wanted he never wanted to stay in one place he wanted to travel on so that's the way it should be in the gospel our desire should be always to advance further and never to come to the place of sitting down and saying hey we've got it oh man we've got it could see that's what happened during the other ages but around instead of spirit got among the people in the days of Martin Luther and said that spirit begins to say we have the word now let's get it together and let's form an organization and let's print up what Luther has told the lest it get away from us well let let's do it but he said that was where they went wrong because see then they cabbage down the wit and they said Luther said this Luther said this Luther's the disc you might have said anything we don't know anything about that we just know what Luther said Lucy wouldn't that to save situation that existed when the Lord Jesus came that the scribes and Pharisees said we know what Moses said we know where he's at what he's doing but you we don't know and no matter what sign under wonders could be done before the people it would not convert it now that's something in it that even like Nicodemus admitting and saying we know that you're a teacher come from God admitted that the things he done could not be done by man but yet where would they turn then you believe it could we be in that same class can we set down there our cabbage down and say well we at lula now we have a great understanding of the message so we'll just relax and wait on everybody else to catch up with us my bud you got a problem there no I don't believe your tongue way I believe we need to keep continuing on I believe that not another message now not something out of the Prophet to come I believe that we need to progress in the word of the hour that we have in our you know giving them to us the tapes the books the thing and keep on going cuz I've never found that to run out yet you know 40 something years of preaching out of it I never found out you know anything about that it would go wrong I found it to keep on opening the word that it would would have made art but that's what we've been trying to say men and listen even to their Sunday now trying to bring a point out of no I'll get back to it later in the message we have time the prophet of God he said everything you have need us in your journey is in you when you receive a new birth well bless God I got it getting you Burt don't need stay don't need to pray I don't know they sup wrongly something wrong we mentally then because how could you say those things when the Holy Spirit the Prophet says is in you weigh on you to bring him the word well we just sat down a relaxed are we we've got the message in the hour huh but let's don't let this message become you know stale you remember what happened with the children of Israel they were given the manner they would go out and they would you know the matter was on the ground i'll head news gathering you see they got a little scared and they said well we better get there is enough for tomorrow coast we might not get any tomorrow so they gathered xtreme put it up you know what happened it rotten the very manner that would life-giving became rotten men will you mean to say the word are rotten I didn't say that i said the fact that we would try to hold it over when god says don't do that we are the ones that make it rotten you remember how we were trying to bring out that did works we all called it dead works there in Hebrews 6 and Hebrews 9 boo he called it dead works what the doctrine of baptisms and one God do the things like the truth he called it dead works the prophet of God called it carnal reform then how can you call the Word of God carnal reform how can you call how could poll call the truth of those things dead works something must be it must be being said to us that we need to study very carefully because it seemed like he would just say it works we just returned universal that were you know repentance from dead works you mean the revealed Word of God is that works no Paul is not saying that brother branham is not saying that you understand that is not dead works its principles this foundation mean but you can't go away from that all of those things are necessary because it's got to go on all right it's gotta got to go to a place to where that we can can look at it what you see look at number two in your notes where I gave it to you car brought around says it like this when Paul is reading that scripture let us go on unto perfection but about this message the sons of God 1965 and 18 what does the word unto me it means there something we're coming to unto so let us go unto own on to perfection that's the time of the message not let us go on unto perfection always trying to explain me that these things that we have are wonderful but we must go on and I just sat down and say you know oh we got it we got it let's write up the books we got it we got the prophets message now in every language in the world almost let's just say I on man wait no and thank God for those people that are putting out the books and the science where would you and I be had they not put them out but if that's all they know then what is that would that not turn out to be dead work cuz it'd be something you can do hmmm what see I say again where would we be if they're not done that thank God for the people that are putting out the books in bed maybe that's their job but that's not your job in line our job is to go on do not let that lazy leave you know in this setback and do it it is to go home the great Apostle Paul that well known in his message to preach and tell us of a change of the body no Lord exceptional that said from him on the shot voice of an archangel Trump forgot all of those scriptures explaining those things to us which you know he never attained to that position yet he saw it my revelation run around and look at all in what he preached but yet he never tied to these in the grave now waiting on you and I right hmm I mean whatever you say he's waiting home hey this he's in the grave no of course not a lot of people don't believe that day they believed you could go Brenda get up you wouldn't be tonight we'll see some work I mean yeah you know all right I'm not towing oakstone did anybody just trying to tell the truth Oh even though he explained to those things but he never reached that one because he was not permitted to do it right God didn't permit into my cuz they without us cannot be made perfect see then we got to go on he permitted him to see the things he saw right which Peter says are hard to understand greater things in the Apostle Peter so the Apostle Paul's all those and spoke to us about it but yet he was not permitted to go into the change at that time but he put him in a place the word that he was telling us the truth now I looked this up because I know a lot of times they can be a little difference in variation in things and I looked at that word let us go on to perfection all right now we say the word perfect is completing a full age that's fine I'm sorry oh that's what it is that's what it means perfection all right but that word is I got a little different meaning to it because watch what it is its number 50 51 in your strongest concourt it means now this word perfection means finisher a perfect term one who has in his own person raised forth to his perfection so that applies to possible problem he had raised for it in his day to the perfection but yet that was not enough to bring about their resurrection rector see so it's left up to someone else but a random would be like that he would be the prefecture one who within his own revelation received and saw all the way through the Bible the entire word and increased it in to us even all the way to the future home but yet he had to go out of the grave I'm because he was not permitted to go on but now listen don't misunderstand me the old people saw it just as though it was taking drugs when something is revealed to you as far as you're concerned as far as God is concerned you already had it right when Paul spoke in there in prophecy of the rapture in his spiritual condition of existence in the new birth he saw that just like it was real right there in front of it that's language speak like he would run around him what he would see something it was just exactly like that he would see it right there in front of it but yet he would have to come back to her earthly existence when he went beyond the curtain of time he but when I was finished in God was true with him done he had to come back and wait to a time that then he could go back beyond the curtain of time could I believe that's where he went we when he was killed her in the car rack no cheer what they see Paul was saying I don't have this so let us go on to that position you could see it it's like it would be standing right there but yet he says let us go home so if they say let us go it mean that you're not tired now what Paul needed was to live down to this time good I believe in this time you have must come to the place that we must reach that perfection within ourselves no not within ourselves like you know the ability to do it now don't misunderstand me there is no perfection outside of Jesus Christ you and I'll never be perfect I don't care how good you think you are you can think you're so goody-goody whatever you do you take your kids as goody-goody but just remember like I've always told you my kids and my grandkids and my great grandkids you know what their halo is held up by horns you know what metalworks you know what I mean there were kids kids are going to be kids didn't act like kids and do that kids God you did oh don't thank you as a goodie tissue no but see don't give us no excuse to run off and say well mom and daddy does so now much do it no need to get born again cuz we got morning even if your whole time all right all said that there's a place that someone will come to and like I've tried to tell you over and over Paul was trying his best to get out of the people's mind that Jesus Christ was coming right then cut he said he's gotta be a falling away and that falling away must come and only when the falling away qanskan these things take place just like where I read there in Hebrew sick yeah let us go on to perfection look at the very next time and whilst will do it got from it fart is impossible for those who were once enlightened and tasted the heavenly gift I remember when I first found that I thought because seaweed always thought and it's got that meaning to it did you know if we send will fly to receive the knowledge of the truth ever remains no more sacrifice and we'd be lost if we tasted the heavenly gift like a borderline believer the Old Testament then we'd be lost but then one day I read it like the Prophet when he told me in the Hebrew book page 215 I'm like a good rhythm Obama here he said Paul was saying it's impossible for a Christian to follow the money now that's going on to perfection that's going on to perfection to find out that you can be lost if you're ever bored any well then brother dev I'm born again itís girl in like I want to now you've proven you're a born again that solves that problem there's no arguments no discussion involved because everybody that would have every season you were has within them the person of Jesus Christ that wants to go on to perfection right never born again believer I was saying what I've got listen he's only a part of why i prophesied about because he didn't tell you I'll never attained of the change of the body right right come on he went to the grave he's still in the grey down but he said why I've got he's a park and there's no way in the world could he say what we think he said we think it he's calling it some kind of dead work when you got a revelation 21 through and living God that's not dead works but if we cab these down what we believe today and stop progressing you prove that we've got dead workers see Paul had a new birds when he was saying this so it's not just the new bird he said we brought it in what it was then the new bird makes you perfect I agree with you but why would Paul say that when he had a new birth my when he said go on to perfection when he had a new birth so he must be meaning i need to go all-in what I've already got I we've already got I've got the new birth I must go on it's my Peter with the statue of perfect man pointing back here behind it what is Peter saying growing in grace and knowledge going on to perfection going up the statue of a perfect man when you're born again by the new birth that makes you so perfect the brother brad says he only have the artists you got go on to perfection blowing up the statue of a perfect man glowing in what we call adoption in no way could probably be calling those things did work as something like wait think about it go on what go on to the rapture right are they gave you the cool pair of number one choice your father preach the night to end 53 907 where I gave it to you our Sunday where he said the rapture is in you now yeah but but but how could he say that 53 when the message hadn't come yet that was the message a man that was part of the message what he corrected is to not be part of the word that he preached we must accept that but if he didn't gret those times we must accept the fact that it must be true right so let us go on that's what they were doing that night Peter said ought to go there of like precious faith he said I've got that new birth but now let's go on right to perfection let's go on in the growth develop right good Paul in him I'll never preach the seals he never even mentioned me son of man he didn't race receives a night that was to be the end time that was to come down to this bag rapture with in motion back there yet just like I tried my best to preach for weeks and weeks and weeks about the coming of the Lord they started the second coming of the Lord Siva started work on the death penalty in that view birth but it's got a lot to do with it there's still unfolding see then Paul bringing it out to go on that's that was the thing about what to do could we don't go on we're the ones that makes it colonel that work came in we make it those things if we don't continue to go on me Luther's message was going on for the time you had to be in his message but when West become long preaching sanctification and you reject that then what you have turned out to be carnal reform or did work you understand what I'm trying to bring the message that we have claimed to believe can be the very thing that will destroy us if we don't go on and bring forth and manifest but it's for the hour that we're living if you don't get nothing out of the message that's what I want you to say we've got to continue your own in the message because we don't it will become stale it's time we got to go on I've got a kind of like a Bible of 26 translations and it shows you the things and you know where there's any difference in what one would say the other one is what to give it listen to what this stretcher says about in Hebrew six about going to perfection listen what it said and go forward to adult understanding right let's go on to perfection on unto it means you're not dr. like the prophet has given you a while to go where he said let us go into let us go into the water fountain that means you're not at the water family let us go on to the ridership and go forward to a dot understanding another one says and it passed on to our full growth another rider these are different Bibles since we let us advance to mature manhood that's what they interpreted as Paul is saying let us go on unto perfection and when they put it in their Bible they put it there see let us advance to mature manhood like I said about Paul standing there even though he could look forward into the future and see those things and come back and talk about some of it some of it he couldn't come back on you take it up into the third heaven and Brett around said I believe Paul was taking his earth he said I believe I only went to the first Hammond also these things here I can't tell you but he told us a lot of times we see when talking about let us go on you wouldn't try to get people converting to going to perfection you gotta get to being perfect before you go into perfection is it does that give you understanding what I'm trying to say you gotta have some place to start from so then you would throwing away the principles they're the very foundation that we rest on but let's don't diss keep on the foundation I gave you one quote in our somewhat lessly this number seven on your note we run around said we spend too much time studying on the principles too much time studying on the pretzels we need to go on to perfection but go on in the word d well didn't stay with your preaching one God water baptism no eternal hell what he went out and got open the seals in the open the seals to him he brought the message of the entire Bible interview when he brought that message into view of the entire Bible that was the thing the world has been waiting home that's the thing not let me see the world no I'm talking about the bride the thing the bride has been waiting on is the opening of the word but then you come in to question it the message even turn out to be dead works like I said the other day you talk to people about this message we don't need to understand and see of them design which is simple who is just simple well it becomes dead works we don't need to understand Daniel 70 weeks and in adoption and stature perfect man we don't need no standing fine we just need to be good Christians well then that's what your profits a waste in too much time studying the principles look the things that should be our foundation it's like I told you when i'm talking about the foundational part when you pour a foundation for a house you don't just keep pouring more foundations and more foundation after a while you get enough foundation lavigne if you don't get enough you got a problem goes in a cracking good but you let down the way they tell you to you put the rebar bein you put the six or eight into the concrete or what it required now for a foot in 24 inches wide or something you can build a good house on top of there unless something goes wrong do you hope why because it's been proven tested that access your foundation one God water baptism no eternal hell all that the prophets message up until you know the preaching up until 63 that's wonderful we need that in place we've got how that in place run around the seals would have never broke to that profit if you had not been standing in the word where the Apostle Paul had reached it would not open then you got people in the message you know what they say well the son of the Meseta the Son of Man comes straight to profit out literally like right around had it all wrong and all it wants something happened and somebody else come along straightening out within people started wanting to be who that was you know they started doing that and they can straighten out to message you know and they're still doing it around the world you know and they're telling you where the fallacies is that and the things that's wrong with the message now wonder people don't want this message but you going the internet run it up and look and see what kind of a garbage cans comes out in front of you me I'm sure some of you've done that but you don't have two scarecrows to try to keep you away from the real truth what you see through the opening of the seals come the full complete revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ runarounds message I preached it to you over and over go to the rapture message listen he said when this message would come forward but as message was not he had to preach those things before he could preach his message but his message begun in the opening of the seal it lasted only for about three years now hmm because that's the way the Lord Jesus was he's ministry on her life to about three and a half years would you see he's not doing away with something the understand we say leaving the principles that's not doing away with that when we don't need that anymore and run around would say that when he said we put too much studying on the principles what was he saying we need to go on to perfection alright but then he went to the next jerk d 1 d preach principled why because that turf didn't understand he said I wish we had time to stay here for a while you go to another turf what happened dude he kept laying principle plan because those people couldn't understand who when he come back to the tabernacle he's a capricious names out there he says you can't go out there and tell those people they've done he said cuz they don't believe it he would go out there and speak about the new birds in one God and water baptism yes because he didn't break down on it but then he come back to the tabernacle and preach great sermons then he have to be after the opening of the seals and he got into the message then he was running out of time and he started on his travels and he was on his travels he began to preach greater messages out dire one cuz he's running out of time he was trying to get us the message to were you and I can go on to perfection right all right first Corinthians 13 sin said Kim says what when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away what up none away that's what no that's not what it's talking about no more than leaving the principles means to throw it away no it's not saying that they see where these prophecies they shall fail well we don't need prophecies anymore then cuz they fail no we're supposed to go on if we're speaking in tongues today and that's wonderful and a part of the gift but we need to go on the Bible says what seek the most earnest and gift never stop that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away not done way like destroyed that's what it sounds like then so we don't need that anymore we do with that numb same profit that said we need to go home to the church without the gills will have to answer good work can you do away with anything of God well we don't need that I'm over without where did that come from that didn't come from me and that didn't come from God go we need everything God give show me where he ever took it away when he gave it to us show me where it took he took it away even a man come here one time he's preaching and he said the bread around said took a piece of paper written this is five fold ministry said Brett around said I full ministry nucleus blade up on the shelf well I didn't understand that first off because he claimed to be one of them and he went land up on the shelf he's up on the pulpit talking right so if you won't let on she'll get rid of it you know that's what you mean me that's only time I ever seen brother moment when he interrupted ebuddy you need is slightly told that brother he said hold it brother we don't agree with that because the fivefold ministry is to stay until the Lord Jesus come let's see the helm you just fold it up do it well why didn't he shut up I get kind of tickled at preachers you know I'm pretty sure they've come up to the pulpit well I'm the least one here and I but it I guess it just fell not a lot well said shut up did somebody hard like that's fake cuz they're not meaning that way they're not being sincere they're trying to show you that all it once you see them straightening out everybody right tell you what wrong in your eyes the letter words he too now they got to start with but give one save dunaway is not to be destroyed and that which is perfect is come then which is in part is done way now listen I heard that explained this way when they which is perfect is coming to straighten out every time I'm all right it was straighten out everything that's good we won't do away any time you ever start trying to do away with you thank God put in the body you've been doing away with part of the body that wouldn't work well that which is in part is that when the people wouldn't do they have exactly right okay on three that's time they didn't have it exactly right now I don't believe that's what it say I believe it saved just what it said in Hebrew sick leaving the principles of the doctrine the Christ let us go on to perfection when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part will fit into that you won't be annihilated it'll fit into that Martin Luther's message or the just shall live by faith sits right in the seals I think said no we don't lean on that there's wrong back there are no the message to the just shall live by faith wouldn't wrong it was God's Word it is the very foundation you and I stand on is the message you'll Martin Luther the truth what you see that's where people try to twist it all look I gave you where the Prophet said number nine of your notes paragraph 105 question that's your 6480 23 he said we have the perfect interpretation of the word of God with divine vindication are you ridden he said we have the perfect interpretation of the word of God looking at the next one way there when that which is perfect is made known there was a day that run around didn't have the perfect interpretation of the opening of the seals he said well he knew everything when he come well I thought I'd he said he didn't so I believe him he said he was fixing to preach that first seal wrong because the Holy Ghost had coming corrected it he said I don't know what the second seal is third fourth field he's gonna preach it wrong on the first one so it don't look like he must understood every time my because it had open them to it it hadn't been made known you can't go home now listen jerk you can't go on to perfection until professor it brought him to view in front of you it's time to be made known better instead back there and told us that you Burke you have that makes your soul that's it perfect is guardian we said now we got to go on woman why go on like Peter said of the statue of a perfect man through what through the opening of the word is why I so vital to break the word see if you can't breach it he can't be before the faithful and it certainly is not like a carrot stuck out in front of a donkey to try to get him to pull away it's the opening of the Word of God the Word of God was not opening his fullness until that profit stood on this earth the Lord Jesus had preached it yes but no one knew what it was he preached the seals in Matthew 24 right read your Bible Jesus pretty slick sale Matthew 24 but who you were that was sir i read that before then and we talked about it we talked about the sixth seal being the tribulation forever coming this message we talk to men but why didn't we know about it those things we could read see that which is perfect had not come when that prophet walked out that and preached the opening of those seals we had the perfect interpretation and God come behind him and vindicated it to be the truth right do not discard allottees so I said I'd advise you to read to see whoop start off and go in simplicity cuz if I ever get around to it with on right back through there again because I've never felt led to preach him over again one after the other because i believe when i finished it during 83 did I had brought it to the understanding that was right we're going to go back there and pick up some more times and bring it into view so I would start in the seal book and read and give you something to do for it whenever I get time to preach but you see church in building the body of Christ the body cord the Chrysler mr. God revealed is not perfect without to hate it will just give you that car that's where the Prophet covered in it go to be sensible to look at the body we was up in the store the other day me and Abby was walking around and you know she looked over there and showing them what do they call Americans or what the words are for you know when them statues 10 and Eric to put the clothes on you know and she said that no I don't hate me and while we come around 21 and she said they don't allow no ladies you know she was looking around and seeing tons well see it wasn't perfect the head and body has to unite the prophet of God said in the last days to bring the message that's not gonna be something different from what the prophets it it's going to be watching properties already college there's going to be revealed to you and I and then it becomes perfection now listen church please I'm trying to illustrate this get it so you've been in the message 10 years 15 20 years can you ever fit back and think about when you come in this message how much you understood huh the early sat down sometimes and thank God for what he's revealed to die it was just our kid and fussing ice always go home I've heard of the message of 66 come on in 67 and all I was doing with our again and fussing about what the Prophet tom well that's what I see still basically going on around the world there's an argument fussing over what the Prophet top now remember when the two sold message came out they really started going with it and I told him on the end I said while alive i was running around the country talking about how many souls you had you know as the lord was revealing to me when it's over it was right that's it my soul is a beating it's a person that's what you are right that's why Jesus can go to hell and freaks to the spirits in prison in being his soul but it was his soul that went ahead but it was the person of Jesus Christ the thank God forever they're less need to be error among you the scripture said that they better approve maybe many men offense when the two Lords begin to strike the view of the people then the Lord began to talk to me about Claire truly was woman and that would bring all the manifestations and not have to to deviate from any of the things the prophetess it amounted to bringing it down to the true understanding now if it's not going on to perfection i want to ask you one question you go back into the hebrew series 1957 run around preached great lifting messages about who melt says that it was he brought it down to being the person of Almighty God right and that Jesus Christ was that person right but when the seals broke he preached who is this melt inside right he was going on to perfection do you understand he was saying who it was back there but then would it become personally said who if this melts hasn't it you agree that he priests one true and living God back in the early ministry and up to 63 and he was preaching 1 through 11 God and never preached anything else but then he preached a message oh Christ is the mystery of God Raviv amen why did you have to preach that when he'd always preach that Christ was Almighty God was he city he saw who Christ is he where Christ was a right see Christ is not Christ was the Messiah Christ is the mystery man male Kennedy who melts azmuth is worried that go into the message that that you see of the prophet and even take the titles and read it sometime I don't need you don't get one of the books that this shows the titles and just read the titles and see if not after the opening of the seals I see they didn't break to the basis of where all went into an eternal message because that's where his macys begun he had to preach back over what piled on him and fries he had to try to bring the fight to the father's yet and he had to preach it for it to be in him and then God revealed to him what he was supposed to preach so he was going on to perfection this way cause it dead works way cause it Carla reform is because people just sat down and like he said we put too much study on the principles now if you've got a new group of people where you going breach principles right right you've got young people coming into the message why are you gonna break to a prince remote so we don't leave the principles but we can't just get down and say well of roots preachy time way I told her brother one time listen the rest said you don't have to tell her bride but one time he said yeah but I keep foods burden straight well I'm sorry I know I'm arrogant hey but I was as honest as I could be now love the brother he's dead and I stone I told him I said what brother if all you go preach to his foolish virgins I said you become a foolish virgin preacher I'm with Mary Goodman hateful just telling the truth if I we preach them like I said the other day of closing higher and stuff that's not even the pretzels that's the things we ought to do without having to be told you mean I gotta tell my wife every day only mmm thank you sure little bit too much no she needs one or two times she needs the gospel spiking early mr. Barrow Theissen one see your hateful no I'm not because she's got a right to look at me and say you're not lining up and she'll tell you that we've had those conversations and she's told me a lot of times I'm not lying another you mean you let your wife talk to you like that if it's the truth yes if they may I just walk out of the room if it ain't right i don't my daughter you're not talking about me when she's right you know what I do I go say God forgive me because I want to go on I want to go all to perfection the greatest perfection that there is would be people that will walk off the earth in a raster one we don't realize the rafters already in us by the new earth then we're looking somewhere else and we'll never be able to attain it like I said the Prophet said when that which is perfect is come damage to the parts because what he said we have not going to we have the perfect interpretation with divine vindication you know the problem same what he had would you understand so you will know seals broke to that profit What did he say he said the Bible became a new book now I don't I know I shouldn't even talk because he human again but I'm always open my mouth and saying things that don't come out good not seeing people be in the message too much you barely got him to baptism and no I thought they ain't got that done you they'll say when them seals broke that mob will come brand new book I'm sorry after all these years of studying it I'm beginning to find out this brand new boot I hey man there's still a lot that I don't understand it they made you knowing there by the end I'm trying to go on right when I preach the seals in 82 and 83 that ditch stands till today anybody want to listen to it and see if I was wrong what you see I saw that to church was not at that place that she needed to be you remember the war in Kuwait when it started and I walked out here that night and I had been told that the war and Kuwait had started and the people were saying this would be the final war that would go on to the war of Armageddon you know because it would be another world war when I walked out here I said courting the way the Lord revealed it to me we've got a lot to preach it sold our by if you'll pray with me will pray and God will bind the forces of the enemy that they will not be able to use them against our troops you remember that now you remember what happened we lost more people in friendly fire then we did from the enemy why because the Lord showed made it wouldn't tell me it wasn't finished up we had too much to preach you remember that but see people don't think about that they don't think that somebody could stand at your days of like that but she says what he told me I just come told you like he told me that it wasn't over yet because the people went into place all I've ever tried to do is get you a night to a place that we would realize realization of what we are who we are what we're doing you you remember here while back and this will be very important to you later you remember I don't know how long do what's being I told you this you want to see the bride of Jesus Christ look in the Book of Revelations the book he was told to stay away from because you couldn't understand it I told you said if because Jesus has never shown in the Book of Revelations by himself he's always there with the bride so that's going on to perfection the said Polly when he finishes up Hebrew said when he says let us go on unto perfection he said we will if God permit what was the next thing he done he went right up into a spiritual revelation and said it's impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and we're made for takers of the Holy Ghost to fall away see now what's what we do we make it carnal reform we make it dead works because we read that as I say well ago we read that as saying if you ever tasted this message and you walk away from that you're off you took the Word of God maybe the dead works the prophet of God said that Paul was explaining that it is impossible for you to have the new birth and follow away he had jumped up from being dead works now he's talking about heavenly principles he went out to perfection in that very versus then it's impossible your prophet of God said we talk about perfection i gave them do you write as if you talk about perfection he said only way to be perfect that's in Jesus crying man we see the new birth is not to completion of the individual right the new birth is only the baby form of the beginning and the principles right the growth development of the statue of a perfect man is going on to perfection the going home to a rafter a change is going on to perfection going on to the opening of the seals the preaching the great revelation the prophetess brow is going on to perfection let's see where's the preachers that want to preach on they hold the people spellbound by telling them how good they are not perfect you are but now let's go on let's get off and you know what your profit talking about sugar tits the old dayz some of the old one here know what the sugar tits would you put things in there and put sugar around it for some little bay for the baby to suck them when you needed you got the croup you know what you end up getting kerosene with sugar pudding put in your mouth or look at it down the throat it went you just watch out every bit of that slime and garbage it was enough you sugar tits you know we go off on people my mother used to tell me how they've done it I've told you this before you probably don't even believe it there on Sunday night they take an onion and put it in bake it and then get that grease out of that onion they bake it and they catch the grease out of the onion and they put it in the baby's milk to drink that night to where the baby would sleep to lunchtime on Monday where they could do the wash they give you a flat dose of opium holy my mama didn't do that nuts forget it forget it don't talk to me about junk maintain silence but then all we're in the day of a dope in winter how degree attach the way they got to work done listen church it's time to go on to perfection Lula George you I'm not talking two words out so you might have listen that's their business I'm talking to Lula Georgia after all that we've done scene and God is revealing to us and the signs and wonders has took place among us let us go to perfection let's don't settle down and stop told you this is this message that I'm on now is not backing up you think it is I've told you and pleaded with you don't think that pray with me that God reveal to you what brother Dale is trying to bring what I hide in Italian we got along to perfection in this century it's not to be revealed to us right but if we don't have a foundation how can it be revealed right I do believe at least we have the foundation brother Dale look at the great things that you preach the great position rather let's go to perfection could I not stop and sell them man i'm crying daily god what can i bring to get the people to see I've done at her sister see them grow in 83 to try to get the people to say what God is saying we are right but he's made us you don't want your children to stay little babies three they went born into Earth that purpose it was more than the world grew up you don't want him to stay little you want him to grown into perfection adulthood so this going on his children laying aside all the principles and the doctrines and I think take what we have and stand on it as a foundation and all it did God had revealed EU hi I'm say let's go to perfection he said with brother Dale Luke were these other people I don't even know nothing about this that man ain't got nothing to do with you and Nate right God has graciously opened his word to reveal himself to you and I because we try to make ourselves available to that position they cry out for that let's go home let's go into perfection somebody's going to reach your body change amen you know what you know that won't be the completion of it right car according to my understanding we get a body change here then we go meet him in the iron see there's more going on to perfect I going to my understanding I hope it's you heard that when we leave this world that will get a message of cheer down through the endless ages by the Lord Jesus himself what going on to perfection right you think what you see the day it's perfect way to the mall room pray pray we're going to reveal his word how many of you do that we see now a lot of you do it my face and thank God for that you pray for God to reveal his word to brother down well that's wonderful that's good thank you yeah but pray for God really do you good record neither come cause brother Daryl fans of the place it's when you and I get not come on when the bride of Jesus Christ around the world reaches that place come on probably the God said you gonna show her for just a short time didn't you become but you know what that'll be I'm only far those who've gone on to perfection now listen you take the old Indian he started up to it and we saw him doing it we took up the habit you know what we do we taken extra tree we'd hotter it out you know we might we might evoke right we made a canoe we could float up down the wrestler yeah we made a barge that we could float across the river and do great thing but how would you like to go back to that the Moke used to fish up and down on the Teddy to river you know how they got em down it with whole boat you know hope you had to push it out like brother Gary says you know about it the mold cars a nice thank you brother Gary the Donnie's got them away model sitting down there I look at him I won't even crank when I'm not far if I had to suck her at sell it before nighttime come oh it's nice to have but there's no air condition you're very little heater and a whole lot of rumbling blow up and down the road then quit here quickly realises damn hallways I'm not thought off on it hey man but I'm just telling you I'll just get in my little prayer laser and I'll turn the air conditioner on the heater on and I'm comfortable and I ride real good lead-in that's just the 2003 model alone what these brand new things are let's see what if man would have done that who was it in the comic strip October that that is nice that invented the wheel invited the kid is a comic strip kids you know bc then he finally invented the wheel well this the other day they put it out one where he's in admitted the car no but you see it did start from somebody but you know that wheel at the wheels life America needed inventor wit with that wheel that idea that somebody had you try to take them off of a car and run down the road with without them right so don't leave the principles let him hold us up and go with the message of the hour going until we've come to a place of perfection you'll all be in Christ and he is the word so let's go on in the word comb British stand together let's go on in the word let's take what we've got today but not look at it like tomorrow sufficient no there will be more revealed tomorrow give us this day our daily bread traveling on going on what we got today it's a wonderful thing but tomorrow comes more be required they took the horsepower that pulled the little buggy you know they have any the cars you know what they call that under the hood I'll let metal and junk it pushing you down the road they call that horsepower well then one day some guys decided and they made it our plane you know and they may took the horsepower and they flew with a hard one then the nvidia great are flames and you know what's called horsepower but it's going on to perfection one day that same horsepower lifted men of the earth the interplanetary travel that your prophet of God said that would be a type of the right shirt would be interplanetary travel so they had to have a natural interplanetary travel had to happen in our last days but let's go on to perfection because one day they set one up and they didn't have it exactly right you know what that could blow it up what you see we keep going on to perfection things keep getting greater and greater the old days when you got sick you go to the doctor you know what you're done hey Paul you think your nails out and things and bleeds you a good pint of blood that's medical doctor medical sonic they bleed you good pipeline because the recreational in the blood cells by the body would automatically cause a process of healing to be in the body so they were doing okay but now who wants to go down today and you your city can you go down today this okay stick up fingers and you don't nails and we'll just pull them all out no see we were going on going on to protection I hope you caught what I'm saying want to go when we leave this world there's still more to go so we're going on to perfection the
