[20:00] a uh another aspect of our ministry in
[20:04] the
[20:05] Philippines and uh it's about the
[20:07] demolition of the message Community a
[20:10] whole message community in Antipolo
[20:13] resel in the
[20:17] Philippines 60 families are now without
[20:20] a
[20:21] home and struggling to survive on a
[20:24] daily
[20:25] basis because they were demolished first
[20:28] slide
[20:32] please this is the church I'm talking
[20:34] about back in 19 uh I think 1996 is was
[20:40] when I led the whole group to the Lord
[20:43] you know we do Expo seminars which is uh
[20:47] nothing but uh message presentation
[20:50] seminars to denominational
[20:53] ministers and uh I met the former pastor
[20:57] of this church and so he set up a Mr
[21:00] Expo seminar for me uh he invited all
[21:04] his
[21:05] ministers uh because he start he started
[21:08] a uh mobile Bible
[21:11] school it's Bible school on Wheels they
[21:14] go from place to place and train the uh
[21:17] ministers and so they uh he invited them
[21:20] over to attend the seminar and at the
[21:23] end of the three-day
[21:26] seminar they all saw the light of the
[21:29] message and decided to be baptized as a
[21:33] whole congregation 87
[21:36] people thank the Lord for that
[21:39] right and uh this is a very vibrant
[21:43] Church you know they have many
[21:44] outreaches different part of our country
[21:47] and uh they have now been all been um uh
[21:51] influenced by the message a lot of them
[21:53] have come to the message because of
[21:54] their
[21:57] Witness
[22:00] that's me the next next slide that's me
[22:05] preaching to the congregation
[22:09] there
[22:13] uh 87 Believers were baptized in the
[22:17] name of the Lord as they saw the light
[22:20] of the message that I presented to them
[22:23] next
[22:26] slide but in March
[22:28] March 1 this
[22:31] year this thing happened the whole
[22:34] church was
[22:35] demolished along with 60 houses of
[22:39] people that live in the community it's a
[22:42] property um uh of about uh 14 acres and
[22:49] all every single house in that Community
[22:52] was demolished it is a case of
[22:55] a um land dispute
[22:58] it's between uh uh Bene beneficiary
[23:03] tenants of Our Land Reform program and
[23:06] Rich business you know in in a country
[23:09] like ours Rich business they have the
[23:13] power and the the brothers and sister
[23:16] they lost the case and the property was
[23:19] awarded to somebody that they don't even
[23:21] know they don't they haven't even seen
[23:23] this person but it was awarded to them
[23:27] by the judge so armed with a court order
[23:30] they start demolishing the church and
[23:32] instead in in spite of our pleadings you
[23:36] know they still went ahead and
[23:37] demolished the church
[23:41] next now this was what what left of the
[23:44] beautiful Church you know we helped that
[23:47] church a
[23:48] lot we uh drilled the well and made a uh
[23:52] water supply system for the whole
[23:55] Community but we can't have access
[23:57] access the people can't have access to
[23:59] that um as well the water
[24:04] supply see this is a case of poor farmer
[24:08] beneficiaries of land reform program
[24:10] versus Rich
[24:12] business
[24:15] next it was a whole day of
[24:19] Destruction it was
[24:21] a probably three dozens of people men uh
[24:27] which were the which was the demolition
[24:30] staff and they did it illegally uh there
[24:34] was a private Army not 50 yards away
[24:37] from the demolition side and it's
[24:39] illegal in our country to do that they
[24:41] were not given enough
[24:44] notice they were not even offered uh
[24:48] resettlement or even given any Financial
[24:52] assist assistant from the mayor's office
[24:55] no they they just uh destroy their
[24:58] homes
[25:01] next not a single house was
[25:04] spared
[25:07] next now this child wonders why people
[25:10] tore up their
[25:13] house and she said this they destroyed
[25:16] my my bedroom and in our bathroom and
[25:19] now I don't even know how I can take a
[25:22] bath
[25:24] yeah
[25:26] next Believers sto as scattered all over
[25:29] the place can you imagine 60
[25:33] families uh they say what what are we
[25:35] going to do with our lives
[25:37] now
[25:40] next uh this was the day after the
[25:43] demolition I came there and met with the
[25:46] people and asked them you know what they
[25:50] feel what they but they want to do of
[25:53] course they want to keep on serving the
[25:55] lord we're never discouraged
[25:58] but how can we do it we don't have a
[26:00] church
[26:01] now so we we talked together and came up
[26:05] with a plan
[26:10] next this is Brother Jose
[26:13] Cano is's an
[26:16] evangelist and we started uh having
[26:19] Services Sunday afternoon out on the
[26:23] street and this was one of the services
[26:26] and it said when we first moved in 37
[26:29] years
[26:31] ago in uh we had the hardest
[26:35] time
[26:39] um hard for me to be
[26:41] the text
[26:46] there
[26:48] okay he said often we had to sck Kon
[26:52] Roots that's Grassroots a
[26:56] saon uh
[26:58] to ease hunger pains while we wait for
[27:01] our first harvest of sweet
[27:03] potatoes other times we had to eat wild
[27:06] berries from The Lone Tree in the land I
[27:09] mean they had a hard time sure 37 years
[27:12] they till the land and planted all the
[27:14] trees there
[27:17] next and now they lost everything Sister
[27:20] Lisa here is one of the used to be a
[27:23] woman preacher by the way yeah you know
[27:27] I love women preachers because there are
[27:29] good women
[27:30] preachers once they find out they can't
[27:33] preach they
[27:33] [Laughter]
[27:37] stop so Sister Lisa testified that they
[27:40] planted every tree on on the 14 acre
[27:42] track of
[27:43] land we were the first settlers on this
[27:46] Wasteland she said which was later named
[27:49] Sito charismatic think about it the the
[27:53] village was named after the group their
[27:56] charismatic situ charismatic in
[27:58] reference to Believers known as
[28:01] charismatics
[28:03] next see the church equipment D dumped
[28:07] out on the street you you see the barb
[28:11] wire and they put the sign up no
[28:15] trespassing
[28:18] next so it was this was what was left
[28:21] the the believer's house 30 believing
[28:24] families now live in cramped spaces in
[28:27] near by Villages others were forced to
[28:30] pay high rent or move far from their
[28:32] jobs and schools to make ends
[28:35] meet
[28:38] next we started holding Services out on
[28:40] the street to manifest our indignation
[28:43] of the illegally illegally implemented
[28:47] demolition you see we were having
[28:49] service right on the street amen that's
[28:51] a tricle right
[28:54] there
[28:56] next
[28:58] it's illegal to demolish houses without
[29:00] relocation or financial assistance given
[29:03] to the affected
[29:06] families that's why we protested out on
[29:08] the street right
[29:12] next and Believers from different local
[29:14] assemblies plock to the streets to
[29:16] support the
[29:17] meetings because of the street services
[29:20] that we did we caught the attention of
[29:23] media some government and non-government
[29:26] agencies who are now helping the
[29:28] displaced families praise the Lord for
[29:31] that amen amen
[29:35] next yeah so the Bible says Rejoice with
[29:39] them that do rejoice and weep with them
[29:41] that that weep and be of the same mind
[29:44] one toward another amen mind not high
[29:47] things but condescend to Men of low
[29:49] estate and be not wise in your own
[29:52] conceits this was the very reason that
[29:55] we cancelled our anniversary me meeting
[29:57] not because by the way didn't show
[30:01] up but you know uh there's no point in
[30:05] celebrating well this thing happened to
[30:07] 60
[30:09] families and so I want you to just uh
[30:12] pray that uh the brothers and sisters
[30:15] can rebuild their homes especially their
[30:19] their church so uh they can continue on
[30:21] serving the lord amen and to be a
[30:24] witness to this uh Community am God
[30:27] bless you
[30:29] [Applause]
[30:35] amen and now we go to the word
[30:41] amen I'm going to preach
[30:44] on open
[30:54] heaven we can actually look heaven in
[30:56] the face how many believes that yes sir
[30:58] amen because of the message of the hour
[31:02] amen Heaven has opened widely right Amen
[31:05] to us and we can actually look heaven in
[31:08] the PA that's all
[31:15] stand read the word of God Hosea chapter
[31:18] 2:1
[31:22] 16 and it shall be at that
[31:25] day sayith the Lord Lord that thou shalt
[31:28] call me isi that's right and shall call
[31:31] me no more B
[31:35] Amen in case you don't understand what
[31:38] isi means it means husband that's right
[31:41] and Bali means Lord amen you know Lord
[31:46] to Servant relationship is a good
[31:48] relationship yeah but it wasn't good
[31:51] enough for God you know that's why in
[31:53] John 15:15 he said henceforth I call you

[36:10] concept of heaven but said chrisis is
[36:14] revealed in our in his own word you're
[36:16] going to find find out one of these days
[36:19] that when you go to heaven you don't fly
[36:22] off somewhere else you are still right
[36:25] here amen two just in another dimension
[36:29] faster than this Hallelujah you believe
[36:32] that hallelujah amen right amen only in
[36:37] this message have I heard this right
[36:39] I've never heard it from anywhere else
[36:42] no Theologian has ever said this amen
[36:46] that heaven is right here amen right
[36:49] it's just another
[36:51] dimension and the elements there move a
[36:54] lot faster than the than we do here amen
[36:56] in this world
[36:59] Hallelujah and and B says Heaven
[37:02] consists of the world of the word amen
[37:07] yes sir If Heaven is open to us what is
[37:12] in heaven right
[37:14] amen Heaven consists of the word yes sir
[37:18] amen as I said if God speaks and sends
[37:21] you did he send you amen right he backs
[37:26] out what you say whatever you say he
[37:28] backs it up see notice if you're an
[37:32] ambassador from heaven and I believe we
[37:35] all
[37:36] are we came from Heaven we're going back
[37:39] to heaven in the meantime we're
[37:41] representing heaven on Earth right and
[37:44] if you're ambassadors from Heaven All
[37:47] Heaven is behind you right right amen
[37:51] and Heaven is consisted of the word
[37:55] meaning it's made up of the word am
[37:59] Heaven is full of the word amen
[38:02] hallelujah Matthew 5 verse 18 says for
[38:05] verily I say unto you till Heaven and
[38:08] Earth
[38:09] pass one jot or title shall in no wise
[38:13] pass from the law till all be fulfilled
[38:17] and then he said Heaven and Earth will
[38:19] pass away but my words will never pass
[38:22] away this is what backs us up right amen
[38:27] yeah the
[38:29] word which consists of
[38:34] Heaven you see brass represents judgment
[38:39] but
[38:40] says in Deuteronomy
[38:44] 28:23 and thy Heaven that is above over
[38:47] thy head shall be brass and the Earth is
[38:51] that under deed shall be Iron right now
[38:55] brass represents Divine judgment amen
[38:59] right and this whole world is right for
[39:02] the Judgment of God that's right not
[39:05] Earthly judgment or mental judgment but
[39:08] Divine judgment see the brass altar the
[39:13] altar where where the sacrifice was
[39:15] burnt was made of brass right the Brazen
[39:20] Altar and all means that it was
[39:24] divine there is word the divine price
[39:26] was paid at the brass right right
[39:32] now uh why I showed you this quote is
[39:37] because I believe that heaven is full of
[39:40] he uh Heaven is full of angels
[39:44] right it's full of them Matthew 18:
[39:48] 10 take heed that you despise one of
[39:51] these little ones for I say unto you
[39:55] that in heaven
[39:57] their theophanies exactly their
[40:01] theophanies their Angels do always
[40:04] behold the face of My Father which is in
[40:07] heaven brother calls it our
[40:09] representation in
[40:12] heaven they always behold the face of
[40:15] the Father in Heaven as we sit here this
[40:18] afternoon we have something representing
[40:21] Us in heaven right amen hallelujah and
[40:25] we didn't know about this until we heard
[40:27] message right why because this message
[40:31] opened heaven to us
[40:34] amen Hebrews
[40:36] 12:22 let me show you what we have come
[40:40] to when we came to the
[40:42] message it says but ye are come unto
[40:46] Mount Zion right unto the city of the
[40:49] Living God unto Heavenly Jerusalem right
[40:54] and to an innumerable company of angels
[40:57] we have come to that
[41:01] right I'd like to hear an amen amen I
[41:04] mean I mean we have come to an
[41:06] innumerable number of
[41:09] angels and I can't get a reaction from
[41:14] you praise the
[41:18] Lord in Second Kings we can recall that
[41:22] Elisha was to be kidnapped by the
[41:24] syrians if you remember
[41:27] because they had a dilemma you know they
[41:30] set up an
[41:31] ambush but the Israeli
[41:34] soldiers they stay away from the Ambush
[41:37] side and the King started suspecting
[41:41] that uh uh one of his generals is is for
[41:44] the Israel Israelites and uh you're
[41:49] supporting Israel but they said no we're
[41:52] not we're not supporting Israel we're
[41:53] all for you our problem is they got a
[41:58] prophet in
[42:00] Samaria before we even set up our Ambush
[42:03] this Prophet tells them what to do to
[42:06] avoid these
[42:08] places that's why you know they always
[42:12] win right so the solution was to kidnap
[42:15] Elisha
[42:17] yeah and so a battalion of soldiers
[42:20] Syrian soldiers came to
[42:23] Elisha to try to kidnap him yeah we read
[42:27] and
[42:28] Elijah uh and and they were around the
[42:32] uh around the
[42:33] mountains thousands of soldiers probably
[42:37] and Elijah prayed and saw and said Lord
[42:40] I pray thee open his eyes
[42:44] because gesi he saw this all the Syrian
[42:49] soldiers and he thought that was their
[42:52] end you know we die right
[42:55] here but but Elisha doesn't seem to be
[42:58] concerned he said
[43:00] Relax there's more that are with us than
[43:03] are with them
[43:05] Hallelujah and Gesa Lo looked around and
[43:08] said but Master it's just you and me
[43:12] here and so Elisha prayed to God to Open
[43:18] the Eyes of his young servant his young
[43:20] man and then he saw and behold the
[43:24] mountain was full of horses and Chariots
[43:28] of Fire round about
[43:32] Elisha the Paradigm changed right there
[43:36] amen absolutely amen because uh there
[43:40] were more
[43:42] Angels chariots uh driving Chariots of
[43:46] Fire around them than all the Syrian
[43:49] soldiers
[43:51] amen that would want to do them harm
[43:55] Hallelujah
[43:58] and so and for
[44:00] instance Elijah when he went out and the
[44:04] skies was just brass and he s he said
[44:08] Divine judgment was upon the people
[44:10] because they went away from God in the
[44:12] days of Ahab and gesi went up to look
[44:16] and see that the skies what the skies
[44:18] look like and he come there and said it
[44:21] looks like brass see Divine judgment
[44:26] right isn't it amazing that God opened
[44:29] the eyes of
[44:32] gesi and he blinded the eyes of the
[44:36] syrians Hallelujah what am I telling
[44:40] you this world is right for judgment
[44:44] right Heaven is closed Upon This
[44:47] World hallelujah amen when they look
[44:50] upon the heavens they see
[44:53] judgment but we see something else amen
[44:56] amen we see the doors of Heaven open
[44:59] hallelujah hallelujah it's salvation to
[45:02] the
[45:04] bride but
[45:06] destruction to the people who don't know
[45:09] the
[45:11] Lord let's consider brother brandman's
[45:14] Ministry Angels ascending and descending
[45:17] upon the son of man
[45:20] Ministry let's take his
[45:23] birth you know in the in that kentaki L
[45:27] house where brother Bon was born an
[45:30] angel actually protected the mother and
[45:32] the child from freezing to
[45:34] death angel from heaven what about the
[45:39] first baptism in
[45:41] 1933 at the start of his
[45:45] ministry we we see that heaven opened
[45:49] and a great light Shone from heaven
[45:52] right and a voice was heard as John the
[45:55] Baptist was sent to forun the first
[45:58] coming of Christ so are you sent to
[46:00] forun the second coming of Christ what
[46:04] about when he was commissioned by the
[46:06] angel the angel said you have been
[46:09] called to bring a gift of Divine Healing
[46:12] to the world Amen and it's and he said
[46:16] if you can be sincere and cause the
[46:18] people to believe in you right then
[46:21] nothing can stand before your prayer not
[46:23] even cancer right
[46:26] Hallelujah and then the pillar of fire
[46:28] was photographed in
[46:30] 1950 what was that angel of the
[46:34] Lord
[46:35] hallelujah what about when he was caught
[46:38] behind the curtain of
[46:40] time Hallelujah Heaven actually opened
[46:43] to brother brandham right as the Lord
[46:46] showed him his
[46:48] converts I believe he saw me
[46:51] there you saw Brother Sam there you saw
[46:54] all of us there
[46:56] Hallelujah because heaven
[47:00] open what about the opening of the seals
[47:04] right A mysterious Cloud appears and as
[47:08] if you look at it the appearance of it
[47:10] is it it as if a hole was Bor through
[47:14] heaven and seven angels formed the face
[47:16] of the son of man in the clouds over
[47:19] Arizona it's like a big opening in
[47:22] heaven Hallelujah why because heaven
[47:24] opened to us yes sir right
[47:27] hallelujah what about the death of our
[47:32] Elijah he was taken away by a chariot of
[47:35] fire
[47:38] right I was told that the when the car
[47:41] accident happened that there was a birst
[47:44] of fire yeah and he our Prophet was
[47:48] taken away by by a charot of fire which
[47:50] according to the Bible was driven by
[47:54] angels do you see Angels ascending and
[47:57] descending upon the ministry of the son
[48:00] of
[48:01] man Hallelujah see obedience opens
[48:05] Heaven Mark
[48:08] 1:10 and straightway coming out of the
[48:11] water he saw the heavens open and the
[48:15] spirit like a dove descending upon him
[48:18] this happened during the baptism of the
[48:21] Lord
[48:22] Jesus you know John the Baptist
[48:26] uh was refusing to baptize the Lord
[48:28] Jesus yeah he said I can't baptize you
[48:32] you need to baptize me but the Lord said
[48:36] suffer
[48:37] it amen let us suffer it so we can
[48:40] fulfill God's righteousness all all of
[48:44] God's righteousness and because of
[48:47] John's obedience and the Lord's
[48:50] humility Heaven opened amen amen and
[48:54] that dove all lighted upon Him amen
[48:58] Matthew 3:1 15 And1 17 says and Jesus
[49:01] answering unto him said and said suffer
[49:04] it to be so now for thus it becometh or
[49:07] behooveth us to fulfill all
[49:09] righteousness and then he suffered him
[49:12] and Jesus when he was baptized went up
[49:15] straightway out of the water and lo the
[49:18] heavens were
[49:20] open unto him and he saw the spirit of
[49:23] God descending like a dove and lighting
[49:26] upon him and L a voice from Heaven
[49:29] saying this is my beloved Son in whom I
[49:33] am well pleased right right this means
[49:37] judgment to the world yeah but blessings
[49:40] to the believer
[49:43] amen and brother B told about the
[49:46] painting in Germany that he saw in
[49:49] Germany said once I saw a picture and it
[49:52] always stuck with me a German painter
[49:55] has painted a a picture that's called
[49:58] the the cloud land and when you see it
[50:02] off a distance it's the horriblest
[50:05] looking Gloom you ever seen just clouds
[50:09] matted together when you're looking at
[50:12] it from a distance but when you get real
[50:15] close to it it changes right it's Angels
[50:19] Wings beating together singing
[50:22] Hallelujah to the Lord amen so that's
[50:26] that's what the Gloom is sometimes if
[50:29] you look at it at long distance it's
[50:31] gloomy and dark but take God at his word
[50:36] and be certain that he's God and move up
[50:39] close to it and you'll find out it's
[50:41] just Angel swings are beating together
[50:46] hallelujah
[50:49] amen that's why we see the headlines on
[50:53] the papers and
[50:56] we read of the news
[50:57] online of the big one they say uh we've
[51:02] always talked of the big one taking
[51:04] place in California but one scientist
[51:07] said but now we can quantify
[51:10] it that's the difference we can quantify
[51:13] it when the big one
[51:15] hits at least 50,000 people will be dead
[51:19] right away right and it said 200
[51:23] billion pesos worth of Dage will
[51:27] be uh inflicted in California amen

[51:35] earthquake in
[51:36] California people are scared to death

[52:10] about it because that it would mean
[52:13] more mean the Muslim people will not uh
[52:17] will not let it
[52:18] happen it would mean
[52:21] War some people say that could even
[52:23] start the Third World War
[52:26] nuclear war Hallelujah but but when when
[52:29] we hear these things happening we
[52:32] remember better man I'm saying it will
[52:34] be
[52:37] built it will be built this is signs of
[52:40] the times this is prophecy being
[52:43] fulfilled hallelujah amen that's right
[52:46] amen judgment to the unbelievers to the
[52:49] world but blessings to the believer am
[52:53] Glory well now did didn't the bible say
[52:56] that uh Authority was both given to the
[53:00] Lord in heaven and on Earth amen by
[53:03] opening heaven to us God is given us
[53:08] access to
[53:09] heaven after
[53:12] Heaven uh you can alter you can actually
[53:15] alter heaven I'm Sorry by altering
[53:17] things on
[53:19] earth Matthew 16:19 says I will give you
[53:23] unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
[53:25] heaven and whatsoever thou shal bind on
[53:28] Earth shall be bound in heaven right
[53:32] amen you can alter Heaven by altering
[53:35] things on earth and whatsoever thou
[53:38] shallal lose on Earth shall be loose in
[53:41] heaven Matthew 28:18 says and Jesus came
[53:45] and spake unto them all power is given
[53:48] unto me both in heaven and on Earth amen
[53:53] hallelujah amen
[53:55] this kind of power is in the bride
[53:59] today you see Heaven opened because of
[54:02] Prophecy am Acts 2 verse 1-4 and when
[54:06] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[54:10] were all in one Accord in one place and
[54:13] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[54:16] as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[54:19] filled all the house where they were
[54:21] sitting and there appeared unto them
[54:23] clothing thongs like as of fire and it
[54:26] sat upon each one of them it's like
[54:29] heaven opened and these tongues of fire
[54:32] appeared and uh settled uh on each one
[54:37] of them amen and they were all filled
[54:39] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[54:42] with other things as the spirit gave
[54:44] them
[54:45] utterance
[54:48] Hallelujah why because all powers of
[54:50] heaven was poured down to earth yes and
[54:54] the Lord even said ye shall receive
[54:56] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[54:59] upon you exactly Hallelujah yes you see
[55:04] what happened God ripped his son apart
[55:08] yeah brother said I said but Jesus did
[55:12] die and Rise Again amen he sent his
[55:16] Spirit back upon the
[55:18] church that spirit that was in him is
[55:22] the very same spirit in the church now
[55:26] and it can and it will produce what
[55:29] Jesus produced I believe that with all
[55:31] my heart he said in John
[55:34] 5:19 the son can do nothing of himself
[55:38] amen but what he seeth the father do for
[55:42] what things soever he doeth there Al
[55:45] these also doeth the son
[55:49] likewise and then B says what was God
[55:53] showing what was he doing to
[55:56] Abraham God was showing that he was
[56:00] going to do by Christ was was making a
[56:05] covenant and God taking his own son to
[56:09] Calvary and he tore him apart and he
[56:12] took one part and set it in his right
[56:14] hand above which was his body and sent
[56:18] his Spirit back to earth right so this
[56:22] was what God did when Jesus Jesus died
[56:25] on the cross he ripped him his own son
[56:28] apart set his body on high but he sent
[56:32] his
[56:33] Spirit to
[56:34] us hallelujah and here's the same
[56:38] Messiah today he was then only without a
[56:43] Corporal body here on Earth he sent his
[56:47] Spirit back to use your body and my body
[56:53] oh my I say Amen to that
[56:56] yes amen hallelujah
[56:59] yes this is what the message did
[57:02] amen hallelujah and we're writing a book
[57:06] of Acts like I said this
[57:08] morning I'm saiding if that first Branch
[57:10] came forth that Branch out of the vine
[57:14] that wrote a book of Acts behind it if
[57:17] that Branch ever put forth a Vine put
[57:21] forth another branch that will write
[57:23] another book of Acts behind it because
[57:25] it's the same life if one of your grape
[57:29] wines out there brings forth blue grapes
[57:32] if it puts forth another Branch it will
[57:35] bring forth blue
[57:37] grapes
[57:43] Hallelujah you know what kind of Life
[57:45] they manifested right in the book of
[57:47] Acts Acts chapter 2: 43 and
[57:52] 47 and I read and fear fear Came Upon

[58:00] were done by the
[58:01] apostles and all that believe were
[58:05] together amen and they had all things in
[58:11] common don't get quiet on me
[58:14] now and sold their possessions and
[58:19] goods and parted them to all men as
[58:23] every man had need amen and they
[58:27] continuing daily with one Accord in the
[58:30] temple and breaking bread from house to
[58:33] house did eat their meat with gladness

[1:06:26] when you seem tired and weary and
[1:06:28] discouraged and ready to give up angels
[1:06:32] can now easily come to the rescue
[1:06:35] because the heaven has been
[1:06:38] opened
[1:06:42] hallelujah what happened in
[1:06:45] Gethsemane Luke chapter
[1:06:47] 22 and he was withdrawn from them about
[1:06:51] the stones
[1:06:52] cast Jesus was asking for
[1:06:56] strength from his
[1:06:59] disciples and he couldn't get them he he
[1:07:03] he couldn't even get them to pray not
[1:07:05] one for one hour and then so he was
[1:07:09] withdrawn from them about the stones
[1:07:10] cast and kneeled down and prayed and
[1:07:13] saying father if thou be willing remove
[1:07:16] this cup from me nevertheless not my
[1:07:19] will but thine be done what an Agony

[1:07:30] from
[1:07:31] heaven and strengthened him glory to God
[1:07:36] we believe in the strengthening power of
[1:07:38] the Holy Ghost but the Angels give us
[1:07:41] that extra push when we need
[1:07:43] it I believe that with know my heart
[1:07:46] Hallelujah I believe in
[1:07:49] angels sir before coming to this message

[1:16:47] Hallelujah but you need to prophesy
[1:16:50] again amen right Hallelujah yeah to many
[1:16:54] tongues this reminds me of the time that
[1:16:56] I went to taipe in Taiwan there was this
[1:17:01] Frenchman was working at the railway in
[1:17:04] taipe and he was a message
[1:17:07] believer and uh he looked around and
[1:17:10] there was there was not one message
[1:17:12] Church in
[1:17:13] taipe and so he heard about me doing the
[1:17:16] message presentation seminar and he
[1:17:19] wrote me and said brother roel will you
[1:17:21] be willing to come
[1:17:23] and hold a Mr Expo seminar here in taipe
[1:17:27] I have a lot of Minister friends here
[1:17:29] and I can gather them together and you
[1:17:31] present the message to them I said all
[1:17:34] right you know of course I prayed first
[1:17:38] and you know I felt good about
[1:17:41] it and so I went to Taiwan to
[1:17:45] taipe and he rented a nice uh Hall in a
[1:17:50] nice hotel like a four fourstar
[1:17:54] hotel and um ordered food for about uh
[1:18:00] how many 50 50 ministers he said easily
[1:18:03] 50 ministers will show up you know uh he
[1:18:10] printed advertisement in the paper and
[1:18:12] the announce over the radio and give out
[1:18:16] LIF flets to his friends and he was
[1:18:19] expecting 50 ministers to come well
[1:18:23] right when the date came we were all
[1:18:26] ready we were all set
[1:18:28] up nobody showed
[1:18:31] up not one Minister showed
[1:18:34] up but then there was one one man his
[1:18:39] name is I can never forget it David
[1:18:43] Chang and he showed up because of the
[1:18:47] money this Frenchman promised to pay him
[1:18:51] if he would interpret my presentation in
[1:18:56] Chinese so he was the only one that
[1:18:58] showed
[1:19:00] up but I was kind of having second
[1:19:03] thoughts because there was nobody there
[1:19:06] I said brother what are we going to do
[1:19:08] should we go on with the
[1:19:10] presentation and he said brother you
[1:19:13] know I have all the the the uh recording
[1:19:16] system set up because I want to to
[1:19:18] record your
[1:19:20] presentation and I want I want it
[1:19:22] Translate ated into
[1:19:25] Chinese
[1:19:27] Mandarin and so uh let's go ahead just
[1:19:30] pretend that there are
[1:19:34] people and it was the hardest thing to
[1:19:37] do
[1:19:40] you that no nobody there so I started uh
[1:19:45] with my presentation and and Brother
[1:19:47] David Chang he interpreted for me in
[1:19:51] Mandarin
[1:19:53] by the middle of the presentation but
[1:19:56] David Chang a learned man he is a
[1:20:01] theologian he said he stopped and said
[1:20:04] brother roel wait a minute where are you
[1:20:08] getting all
[1:20:10] this he said I spent 12 years in Bible
[1:20:13] School I've never heard any of
[1:20:17] this and so he went on with the
[1:20:20] presentation but David Chang
[1:20:23] ended up accepting the
[1:20:29] message
[1:20:31] Hallelujah one soul is worth 10,000
[1:20:36] worlds Hallelujah and this is our
[1:20:39] ministry right better Ben said you know

[1:36:28] okay just pray for the family that the
[1:36:31] Lord may do now I've got a little
[1:36:33] announcement to make on one thing uh
[1:36:37] we've had a little trouble with the air
[1:36:38] conditioner system and uh we come to
[1:36:41] find out it wasn't a problem with the
[1:36:44] air condition system somebody hit the
[1:36:46] wrong button so uh you hit the reset
[1:36:50] button
[1:36:51] on the air conditioner when you start to
[1:36:53] change things it automatically resets
[1:36:57] this air conditioner system is
[1:36:59] programmed to where during the week it
[1:37:01] runs like 68° 78° or something it's got
[1:37:06] a set on it then it comes in and runs up
[1:37:09] Wednesday night and Wednesday afternoon
[1:37:11] it starts running and brings it down to
[1:37:13] the cool Point Sunday it comes in it's
[1:37:17] 8:00 7:00 or in the morning it starts
[1:37:20] lowering the temperature here all right
[1:37:22] but if you hit that reset button and
[1:37:25] it's one right by the side of where you
[1:37:27] turn it to increase the fan to turn it
[1:37:29] on or off if you hit that you destroyed
[1:37:32] the whole system so that's what it's
[1:37:34] been doing we've been running our
[1:37:35] conditioner at night in heater in
[1:37:38] daytime okay so you somebody hit the
[1:37:41] wrong button so just don't touch the
[1:37:44] system unless you know what you're doing
[1:37:48] because you you say well I'll just click
[1:37:50] this and we'll you click the whole
[1:37:52] system and that's what it's been doing
[1:37:53] so please don't don't fool with it get
[1:37:56] with it with Richard or Aaron or
[1:37:58] something I can exist run it up or down
[1:38:01] temperature and I can check the fan but
[1:38:04] don't I don't like to fool with it
[1:38:06] either myself so it don't you know it'll
[1:38:08] mess it up but okay you got that in mind
[1:38:10] so you know if you need to move it up
[1:38:12] and down let somebody know and we'll
[1:38:14] take care okay now the brother made the
