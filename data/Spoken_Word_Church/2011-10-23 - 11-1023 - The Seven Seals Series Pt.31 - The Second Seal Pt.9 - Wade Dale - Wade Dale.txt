TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good to be in the house of the lord a good day yesterday and participating i missed two more moms that's 86 people were there yesterday 86. it's probably 90 because you've probably been here i padded it by four that i did okay so 86 people yesterday at the party and that was wonderful having a good time in the lord kids had a wonderful kids had a wonderful time the dog had a wonderful time had plenty to eat we got plenty to eat today oh they said praise the lord this morning the flies they were just so happy all 12 million of them at the party okay mama there were 12 million and 84. the flies were having their last party before they go into hibernation so they were happy and late so thank you and we fed them they come out yeah very much all right before we get started who all looked up well you don't have to raise your hand you're supposed to look up justification and sanctification the uh homework if you didn't shame on you reach over and take this hand if you're right-handed put it down like this take this hand and go thank you all a lot but if i'd have told y'all you need to been at the doctor and and get a prescription how many of you would have went every one of these so for those of you that did and those of you who didn't i'm going to read kathy's i'm going to use mine or read what sister kathy's got cause she wrote it with her own writing and wrote it by hand he didn't cheat on the computer and then hit prince print look on the internet okay no i didn't but it's just commendable that sister kathy did okay and i'm sure she didn't copy it brown on your nose kathy you want to come sit up here all right let's read kathy's and let's see what because i wanted you to realize what we were talking about in the seals the first seal and second seal being a type of justification and sanctification justification a forensic term i hope you spelled these right opposed to condemnation as regards its nature it is the just just just the file act of god by which he pardons all the sins of those who be loved in christ and accounts accepts and treats them as righteous as righteous as in the eye of the law in other words as conformed to all its demands she's not telling anybody you go search it for yourself she said in addition to the pardon of sins justification declares that all the claims of the law are satisfied in respect that's why i like to i like to read this listen in addition all right conform to all these commands that's justification justified in addition to the pardon of sin justification declares that all the claims of the law are satisfied in respect of the justified is the act of a judge and not of a sovereign the law is not relaxed or set aside but is declared to be fulfilled in the strictest sense in other words you sin you're not going to get away with it but if you go by what the law says the will the word of god then that sin is not counted to you all right and so the person's justified is declared to be entitled to all the advantages and rewards arising from perfect obedience to the law we know we're not we know everybody the law is dead as far as do's and don'ts but still it is do's and don'ts it still is dues and though i don't smoke and drink i do serve the lord now so he'll still do to know that's right but this is because you wanted to that's correct right the law in the old testament was that's the way it was just like today our natural law you break that law there's a penalty and this is see this right here is saying the same thing this is not negating that you did it because in baby form in the baby form justification you did do it you know you did it god knows you did it but somehow he put it in the sea of his forgetfulness but we can't we don't have a seed deep enough right right because the devil brings it right back up he goes fishing and digs it up and throws it at us again all right but now listen let me read this one more time because it says right here claims of the law are satisfied in respect of the justified it is the act of a judge and not of a sovereign the law is not relaxed or set aside in other words we got people in the message that says you know we're already in the millennium it doesn't matter if you have two wives or it doesn't matter if you commit adultery it doesn't matter if you do this it don't matter see that that goes to the extreme on this side the law is still there look the old testament laws are still in this book right eternal word of god never to be taken out but remember they were types and shadows of when jesus come right looking back wasn't done away with it sure it was done away with it just like we talked about paul she'd lay not laying again the foundation in other words let's don't go back and try to build the foundation of this church again it's already built let's just build on it well you know let's go this is not going to ever go away it's there right we're going to build on it if we were to build onto this church we wouldn't tear this foundation down we just build on to the foundation all right the law is not relaxed or set aside but it's declared to be fulfilled in the strictest sense in other words stricken from the record and so the person justified is declared to be entitled to all the advantages and rewards arising from perfect obedience to the law it proceeds on the imputing or crediting good grief katie to the believer by god himself of the perfect righteousness active and passive of his representative and surety jesus christ which is romans 10 3 through 9. justification is not the forgiveness of a man without righteousness but a declaration that he possesses a righteousness which perfectly and forever satisfies the law in other words none of us are any good we did it but christ never done it that's right so we look to him as our perpetuation we look to him as our judge jury and prosecutor so we can't lose because there's nothing held against him and if we are in christ there's nothing held against us that's what we have to realize right right that he possesses the righteousness which perfectly and forever satisfies the law namely christ's righteousness the soul condition on which this righteousness is imputed or credited to the believer is faith in the lord jesus christ that's right it all comes back to that simple thing called faith you got to believe that you justified when you come into that first seal you see the first seal white rice's church opposition what righteous church but you have a true white righteous church that's what this is talking about that's right you got to believe that if you've been justified then you've already been glorified you got to believe that regardless of what happens regardless of how many times you think you fall right right i said you think you fall you get back up and go okay because remember it doesn't do away with the law he doesn't do away with the what we're doing no sisters still don't cut the hat sisters still don't wear makeup brothers don't you know lust for women and smoke and drink do all stuff you understand we'll do it anymore don't do it that's right because that's do's and don'ts it is do's and don'ts but it's not do's and don't i do it out of love that's right but i still fall in this old guy right here this is the one that we're trying to destroy is get this guy changed i believe i've had a change on the inside but i need to change on the outside all right not an exchange that old nature's got to die a lot of our problems are is is even in baby form justification it's not it's not completely dead right the old sin is but brother brown said that old nature the man that made you do that is still there right but now when we come to the baptism of the holy ghost and fire clean this man out guess what's going to happen that old nature's dead not divorced we don't believe in divorce we don't believe in divorce we believe in killing right yeah don't take that to the natural sisters and brothers you don't like your husband that doesn't our wife that does not give you the opportunity to kill them but you'd be justified uh that doesn't you're still covered under man's law then okay does everybody get what justification is clean i'm not clean but your sin is forgiven that's all baby form justification is god has done this right here he has made you just as righteous as he is if you continue on but he did forgive your sins from there back now brother brown covers that emphatically your sins from this point backwards is covered right you did them you know you did them a lot of times they're fresh on your mind at that time because remember one week you were doing wrong things and the next week that old desire was going away so you're still looking back though but what is this justification all right let's read this the soul condition on which this righteousness is imputed or credited to the believer it's faith in the lord jesus christ faith is called a condition not because it processes any merit but only because it is the instrument the only instrument by which the soul appreciates or apprehends christ and his righteousness what you're doing is appropriate appropriate sorry i can't read it you've got a beautiful handwriting i just can't read good i got my contact hands down all right so justification what does somebody else got let's see what's good word for words circumstance or explanation that justifies an act of justifying the state of being justified also called justification by faith which is theological the act of god whereby humankind is made are accounted just are free from guilt repentance penalty of sin all right now though let me see the lessons notice all this that you're reading even goes back to it talks about act and and laws it's all got something to do with that even though it doesn't even though it may not say it verbatim in some of these most of these says something about law and when you justified i remember when i become justified i become a lawyer you become very very do's and don'ts at that time why because it's happening to you you're living through it you're the one that's going through and being justified all right because i'm going to read this and then we're going to talk about justification that we talked about in the first season justification is a divine act whereby an infinite god judicially they go back to judge judicially declares a believing sinner to be righteous and acceptable before him because christ has borne the sinner's sin on the cross and has been made unto his righteousness justification springs from the fountain of god's grace which is titus 3 4. it is operative as the result of the redemptive and propitiatory sacrifice of christ who has settled all claims of law so are we righteous no but god's righteous through christ so it's our faith our faith baby faith will you just come to the realization that god i am lost i'm a sinner i did this i did that so you go back to do no i did this i did this i did this i did this i did this and then you go to the altar or you pray or you talk to some christian and and what are they going to do they can point you to christ because there's nobody else we're not all justified to say that hey you're saved you're safe no it's only you and god all right justification is on the basis of faith and not by human merit of words so it wasn't something you got better than you decided to be justified you can't get good enough if you if you think you're good enough the devil got you that's right that's his trap to say that you think you're good enough and you know i know i'm not good enough all right a justified believer emerges from god's great courtroom with a consciousness that another his substitute has borne his guilt and he stands without accusation before the bar of god justification makes no one righteous i like that just what i said justification don't make you righteous neither is the bestowment or of righteousness as such but rather declaring one to be justified whom god sees as as perfected once and forever and his beloved son of course jesus christ right all right so let me read this other one it all has to do with being in a courtroom just justified law court judge jury justification proved to be just right proof when you do in the courtroom you prove something all right to be just right or reasonable dictionary bible announces a favorable verdict i think going back to courtroom favorable verdict declare to be righteous all right so justification you start your rightness with god your past sins are forgiven you start on your road but now what about this white righteous church that we were talking about in the first seal see you should already be at what i call from baby form justification to the second stage of justification that that stuff it's going to bother you don't let me get don't let me put that in your head that that you're just totally a walking um zombie of christ you're not that's right you're going to have the same problems you had at baby form justification this is my this is my quote you're now able to handle it you couldn't handle it at baby form justification because brother brown said if you were justified truly justified you were forgiven of your sins but the center center was still there so you would do it again now see if we come to that point now that's not baby form justification when we come up to justification we're talking about in the seals that person never done it you've got to realize that through the word through the revelation of your own heart not my revelation telling it to you no that's my revelation telling it to you but your revelation in the first seal that there is a white righteous church that never did it to start with never sinned because if there's a big word if if you're born again you didn't the real you the real you did not do that that person is dead and you like many times you see these examples where you know you dad says you go out to a graveyard and accuse his father of stealing two weeks ago well somebody come up and says sam dale stole uh something two weeks ago and then you would call a witness well the first witness would be the family my dad and his brothers and sisters all they'd have to do is walk in the courtroom and say sam dale died 48 years ago the judge will say what see you call the guy brought him in an idiot and probably put him in jail but how did you come up with it well that's what the devil does the same thing he accuses that dead person i've seen it good right just got that just man that dead person satan walks in the courtroom and he says do you see them two weeks ago of course god says that person has been dead forever how long have you been born again that person did how did he do that that's this that's the white righteousness that god's looking for now we're going to fall we're going to make mistakes people but remember the bible says we have an advocate if you have an advocate you need an advocate even after you're born again we need an advocate till this guy's changed and when this guy gets changed we'll know that the advocate's the one that did it it wasn't your mom and daddy and it surely wasn't you but see god's gonna god's gonna take everything that satan does if you're born again he's gonna take everything that satan does and say it's dead how are you gonna accuse the dead man to do something sam dale couldn't have done it he died 48 years ago if somebody did it two weeks ago it wasn't the real sambal right it did okay everybody understand that yes so the next time satan starts into you say hey you talking to a dead man you talking to a dead person dead justified one of them is yes you did it god forgive you okay then it's as if you didn't do it and then the real you didn't do it if you're born again the real you never did it that's right that real you to come in and vulcanized itself to you at the new birth that person is no more like i said it's dead not divorced our problem is is we we think it's dead but it's divorced and divorced some of you that are divorced you know one thing's for sure that old husband our wife is still there and i don't care how good y'all get along and i don't care how good everything goes they steal a sticker in there somewhere right that's why god said you should never do that because he knew us as humans couldn't handle it yeah as humans i'm telling you as humans we all have problems now i've never never been to morse i can't sit up here and say hey i know what you're talking about but i don't but i've seen families get torn apart i've seen families that it seemed like everything was fine and then all of a sudden it's not one person's not dead you got two lives you got living husband and wife and when you do i know all of you that have living husbands and wives there's always that little i don't care how good you get along i don't care if you're both born again if you're both born again you want a divorce born in people do not divorce you okay am i right brother ray i have amen for that they do not brother brown said you are one unless you're born again i told them many times i told them many times the bible doesn't say cleave to your parents and leave your spouse that's right that's what's happening now they're cleaving yeah they're cleaving to their parents and leaving their wife the bible don't say that genesis says you cleave to your wife and leave your parents come back visit bring your grandkids every once in a while but leave clean to your wife and leave your parents could you could you uh type the old testament boss as training a child because with these little ones and so don't do this do that no don't do that and you're trying to teach it how to in the christian sense you're trying to teach it to be christ because that's what the revelation of those commandments is that's right and then when you get old enough as an adult when when the jews when jesus finally came the jews were mature enough that they could make their own decisions to receive him right come to the to the age of accountability that's the same way with you and i he said well the age of accountability is 12 years old no i think there's several forms of the age of accountability because when you become a justified baby in christ god knows you're going to make mistakes because he's not residing in your soul okay so he's going to have those bumps and bruises and and things like that but now also when you become a son of daughter of god son and daughter of god same thing you're still going to have your ups and downs so but god's going to come one day this is the age of accountability right here when you come to the justification that you didn't do it and satan can't bother you he can bother you but he can't get his greasy hands on you that god has truly i believe that that down through the ages man has been born again and they have struggled to make it and made it but done things like luther smoking the pipe and drinking the beer they we don't do that we do it at justification still if you smoke the justification you can be justified and still be smoking you can't be still smoking and sanctified because remember the unclean spirit goes out at sanctification and you surely better not be you're born again because you'd be fooled because you're not you're right okay just don't fool yourself right all right but still in that justification that white righteous church then that makes you white righteous as righteous is who god is but now that comes like sister trudy says that comes from an understanding that you've been taught to that place it's not just you know people in the message go well i'm in the message and this the end time and this adoption and you know i've been preaching um when dad preached that sermon chosen in him several months ago i haven't got off of that i've been preaching in every church that i've been to because it just keeps opening more and more and more because we got to realize that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that's mature people that's not for babies and i tell them right up front i said look this thing this ain't milk this is not for babies when you come to that realization that you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that's not milk milk is this right here you were lost you needed to be justified you needed somebody to take your place that's milk but when you realize that that person took your place and then come to reside in you and didn't finish it he's continuing to work that's where you start chewing on some steak because once we realized we were chosen in him before the foundation in the world this is not going to matter he didn't choose this that's right but this has got to go it's got to be changed to fulfill this we which are alive and remain that the coming lord should not prevent our hindus something's got to happen to change our body that's what these seals are for they're for the body change they're not just that the seals are open and everybody can read the open book that's good but the highest form is when you really can look at yourself in the word we're not going to get the sanctification so some of you that didn't do your homework you can get sanctification because i gotta go hook brother jewel up and uh make sure he doesn't break our microphone look up sanctification that's the next one coming up sanctification but justification we'll cover a little bit but then we'll be finished with that
