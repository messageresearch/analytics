[34:12] but I want to read a scripture in
[34:15] Habakkuk Ibaka it'll be 2 and 2 and
[34:24] verse 4 in Ibaka - just pick up the
[34:27] thought to where we can continue on like
[34:30] we were this morning you know the new
[34:32] predator Lord would bless remember now
[34:35] the fellowship meeting will be at
[34:36] brother Homer Longoria's on this coming
[34:39] Saturday 3:30 so remember that
[34:42] Wade in June or coming back sometime
[34:46] probably this afternoon after the
[34:47] evening service and just remember them
[34:50] brother Bob and brother Lewis they had
[34:52] them on video while ago whenever we're
[34:55] going at it so they're going to be
[34:56] probably late getting in tonight so you
[34:58] just remember these that are traveling
[35:00] and everything - Lord would be with each
[35:02] one amen Habakkuk - father we thank you
[35:07] for this day and thank you for the love
[35:10] that you have been so gracious to extend
[35:13] to each and every one of us that you'd
[35:14] give us an opportunity to be able to
[35:17] just study your word that we'd have a
[35:20] chance to be able to hear from heaven
[35:24] and be able to walk in the light of the
[35:27] grace of the love that has been given
[35:30] unto us in this last days and Lord
[35:32] knowing that our word is true and that
[35:34] we walk in your life forgive our sins
[35:38] bless those that are traveling this
[35:40] afternoon and today toward and just give
[35:42] them a safe journey home and let us all
[35:45] walk in your light we love you and we
[35:46] thank you in Jesus name Amen
[35:50] now I want you to just think on this and
[35:54] then we'll get back to it the way the
[35:59] scripture is spoken now in Romans 1 in
[36:03] 17 it says the just shall live by faith
[36:07] Galatians 3 and 11
[36:10] says the just shall live by faith and
[36:12] Hebrews 10 and 38 it says the just shall
[36:16] live by faith but I want you to notice
[36:18] what it says here in Habakkuk behold his
[36:23] soul which is lifted up is not upright
[36:26] in him but the just shall live by his
[36:32] faith he's always talking about the
[36:37] faith the faith now it says by his faith
[36:39] Amen let's let's just you may be seated
[36:43] just remember Lord willing we'll be
[36:50] trying to if we can to finish up a
[36:54] little bit by this coming Wednesday on
[36:56] the the topics and things that we've
[36:58] been on about statue of perfect man so
[37:00] pray that the Lord would bless and give
[37:03] us the right understanding to be able to
[37:07] present it okay now we talked this
[37:11] morning we studied about the fact of
[37:14] knowing that if you're born again you're
[37:17] born again by faith because that's the
[37:20] only way the Prophet would tell us we
[37:22] are born again he said faith have faith
[37:25] statue of a perfect man how faith and be
[37:28] born again all right so then the the
[37:32] faith at the bottom of the pyramid as we
[37:34] see it is the new birth okay
[37:37] now that new birth is what it was has
[37:42] been within ever born again believer
[37:46] down through every age in time ever
[37:49] person who is born or was born again or
[37:53] is born again it's born again the same
[37:55] way and it's born again by faith by
[37:59] faith in God and believing all right
[38:01] accepting it and and you know realizing
[38:05] that he has paid the price done the work
[38:09] but unfinished everything up and then we
[38:13] can walk into the light of his love and
[38:15] see and as I said we've read we quoted
[38:19] from Romans Galatians and Hebrews that
[38:23] we know the just shall live by faith
[38:27] all right now that is not your faith
[38:33] your faith is really your faithfulness
[38:36] to believe God okay now follow the point
[38:39] your faith is your point of you
[38:42] believing God accepting him for what he
[38:44] has done for you and believing him in
[38:48] having faith in God all right now that's
[38:52] a wonderful thing but that will not save
[38:54] you it takes his faith to save you
[38:59] that's why I read hypocrisy for then the
[39:04] just shall live by his faith all right
[39:07] so it takes his faith to bring the new
[39:09] birth into being and his faith
[39:12] transmitted into you all right now it
[39:16] makes you and as we'll bring it back in
[39:19] a minute and go over it again it makes
[39:21] his faith living in you in a new birth
[39:26] all right now be in that new birth then
[39:30] it puts his faith in you alright now
[39:36] that's just not your faithfulness men
[39:38] it's by putting his faith in you then
[39:42] the just shall live by faith but it's
[39:46] living by his faith alright now when we
[39:51] finish the message we'll try to get back
[39:53] to that point in a minute you'll see the
[39:55] what I'm talking about that the just
[39:57] shall live by his faith when it becomes
[40:00] your faith then you got something to
[40:04] talk about okay so now let's hold that
[40:07] point the thought that we were trying to
[40:10] bring this morning to see what our point
[40:14] of the message and realizing you know
[40:17] the thing all right what did we talk
[40:20] about this morning the Prophet said the
[40:22] message paradox the new birth is a
[40:24] mystery he said just like the natural
[40:29] birth is a mystery the new birth is a
[40:33] mystery because we do not
[40:36] have it or keep it in line he said we
[40:38] belittle it you remember we belittled a
[40:42] new bird why because we don't count it
[40:45] to be what it really is it has to be him
[40:50] coming and living in us that gives us a
[40:55] new birth all right now that's his faith
[40:59] coming in to you to give a birth to the
[41:02] word or the revelation the and doing all
[41:06] right now what was our point this
[41:07] morning then all the virtues in the
[41:12] statue of a perfect man all right those
[41:19] virtues in the statue of a perfect man
[41:22] all are added to your faith yeah we'll
[41:28] get back to that and read it in a minute
[41:30] in the scripture that add to your faith
[41:33] all right now remember it's not just
[41:36] your faithfulness to believe God if
[41:39] something else has went beyond our
[41:41] faithfulness our confession we must do
[41:45] that we must confess him as our Savior
[41:47] we must believe him as our Savior we
[41:50] must walk in that and that is our
[41:52] faithfulness in ourselves you know are
[41:54] human beings of of believing God and
[41:57] accepting what God has done for us and
[42:00] giving us the new birth all right
[42:03] but then when here's when my faith if I
[42:08] can can hold on long enough
[42:10] see then God can come to that faith and
[42:14] quicken that faith and make it the alive
[42:17] word right and see then it becomes not
[42:23] his faith we'll get to back to this in a
[42:27] minute it becomes our faith you say yeah
[42:30] but you just twisted it around I said it
[42:33] the way I wanted to to see I we've got
[42:36] to have something that where he can come
[42:39] and live in us right that gives us a new
[42:44] birth but see you say well then it's his
[42:49] faith in me
[42:50] that's true that's exactly right is here
[42:53] faith living in you but then see we need
[42:57] for it to become our faith and not just
[43:02] our faithfulness to believe him we need
[43:04] for it to become us alright think on
[43:07] that now as we'll get back to the point
[43:09] now what was we talking about all the
[43:15] virtues are of the same material faith
[43:21] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[43:23] godliness brotherly kindness you don't
[43:24] know it's the same material you don't
[43:29] have something that a prophet said
[43:31] statue of a perfect man he said you
[43:33] can't have it to her that you tried to
[43:35] vulcanize a piece of rubber to a piece
[43:38] of metal he said it can't be
[43:40] see it's got to be the same all right so
[43:42] then each one of those virtues now watch
[43:45] what I'm saying if it was something
[43:46] different you would have a problem
[43:48] because you'd be trying to add it to the
[43:50] other and you couldn't say well add to
[43:53] your faith virtue we'll see don't try to
[43:56] make that something different make it
[43:59] the same material that may not be a good
[44:02] weight for you to understand but it's
[44:04] the best I can do to think about it that
[44:08] it's the same material all right see
[44:12] then if it's the same material then it
[44:14] will help us to be able maybe the Lord
[44:17] Wednesday to be able to comprehend how
[44:20] to that these virtues come and live in
[44:24] us in the correct way and give us a
[44:27] right understanding all right see then
[44:30] the new birth brings your soul to
[44:34] eternal life all right if your new birth
[44:39] which is the birth of the word the words
[44:42] you've took you held it you know and God
[44:45] has made it alive he's quickened it all
[44:48] right
[44:48] then as doing that then we know that it
[44:54] has to be the same and I want to
[44:57] emphasize this that the new birth is
[45:01] I've expressed to you over and over and
[45:03] over
[45:04] it can't be one thing in one age and
[45:07] something else in another age right if
[45:12] it is then you've changed somewhere the
[45:15] new birth is the new birth in each age
[45:19] probably even preached a message our
[45:21] whole thing gonna on the Holy Ghost in
[45:24] each age all right see the new birth is
[45:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in each
[45:30] age making the word that you've heard in
[45:35] that age come alive what not think
[45:41] simple now if that be true that the
[45:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the word
[45:52] being made alive right thing then and
[46:00] that everybody has the same new birth
[46:02] you're not looking for different things
[46:05] in different ages and see you look at it
[46:07] and that's I know how the human mind
[46:09] works and in all but mine don't work too
[46:12] awfully good but see if people want to
[46:15] try to make well Luther them just had
[46:17] this Western em just had this and these
[46:22] people had this for today didn't have
[46:23] this they don't get tied up into those
[46:27] things you would be belittling the Holy
[46:30] Ghost in whatever age you would put it
[46:33] by letting it not be of the same value
[46:38] the new birth is the new birth what is
[46:41] the new work justification
[46:43] sanctification and the baptism of the
[46:47] Holy Ghost is the new birth all right we
[46:51] must go through those three processes to
[46:55] have the new birth all right now so if
[46:59] it is right that each age has that new
[47:03] birth right then it would be a very
[47:08] simple matter to understand you know
[47:13] what has taken place in mankind
[47:16] those no matter what age it is God had
[47:19] to do the same thing he had to come down
[47:22] justify sanctify and fill the individual
[47:27] see I know the mind of people in how
[47:29] they cite yo but looking with them they
[47:31] just had justification their
[47:34] justification was the baptism of the
[47:36] holy ghost what else you going to make
[47:41] it are you prophets wrong when he said
[47:42] the Holy Ghost in each age you see what
[47:46] you're doing with it you're you're
[47:48] tiring it dying are belittling it to her
[47:51] that you're making it something that
[47:52] it's not and not thinking about how
[47:55] simple it is know how simple it is
[48:01] do you realize that if you want if
[48:05] you're gonna try to believe that that we
[48:06] must all go through justification st.
[48:08] encasing the baptism of Holy Ghost to
[48:10] have the new birth now I believe that
[48:15] and that's where I teach it I believe
[48:17] that's where the Prophet taught him
[48:18] that's why I teach that way because I
[48:20] believe it's what he said all right now
[48:22] if that's true look how simple it is
[48:28] see when I read it like I said it's more
[48:30] than reading that quote from the Prophet
[48:32] that the the new birth that you're born
[48:39] again by faith that's the new birth you
[48:46] say yeah but I didn't get no revelation
[48:47] I don't remember when I got a revelation
[48:51] I just was there this happen to me well
[48:57] don't do away with this happening to me
[48:59] all right don't think that I'm trying to
[49:02] do away with anything I'm trying to put
[49:04] it in order now you're gonna have to
[49:09] talk to the Lord about this cause it's
[49:11] between you and him not me I believe it
[49:14] if every new birth is justification
[49:17] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[49:19] Ghost then look how simple it is
[49:28] come down offered you eternal life right
[49:36] justification starting y'all
[49:39] sanctification to cleanse you set your
[49:42] side and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:45] you went through that now listen we went
[49:50] through those things and you know us
[49:52] Baptist Methodist Presbyterian etc we
[49:56] taught nothing about justification
[49:58] sanctification the baptismal old ago we
[50:00] never talked three works of grace are
[50:02] three stages of grace we just believed
[50:06] it we accepted it it was just a if it
[50:08] was that at least the Pentecostals was
[50:11] believing of justification
[50:13] sanctification the baptism an old ago
[50:15] and I don't mean them all I don't mean
[50:17] everything but the biggest portion of
[50:19] your Pentecostals believed in three
[50:24] stages of grace now am i right you older
[50:27] ones you that come through Pentecost at
[50:29] least some form or other you went
[50:32] through those talking about it nothing
[50:34] else all right let's see it was three
[50:38] things that happened but you didn't call
[50:42] the justification Saint case in the
[50:44] baptism home goes all the time what do
[50:47] you call it an experience with God well
[50:51] Arad God come down and called you right
[50:58] the no man can come to garden let's God
[51:01] Carlson right all right now if nobody
[51:04] can come let's go ecology what look how
[51:07] simple it is
[51:07] there's your revelation that's what I've
[51:10] drove that hard beaten is hammering it
[51:13] the faith that you can't be saved
[51:17] without faith you can't be saved without
[51:20] a revelation will re-enter got it now no
[51:23] revelation you come to the Lord didn't
[51:26] you you accepted Jesus Christ as your
[51:29] Savior didn't you well would that not be
[51:35] faith would that not be
[51:40] what I've been talking about a
[51:42] revelation then you realize that hey
[51:47] yeah you know I need to quit this I need
[51:50] to quit that I mean we did at least have
[51:52] enough badness about us to to be able to
[51:55] preach a little bit about those things
[51:57] to give up some of the things I mean you
[52:02] know we got delivered
[52:05] you know what delivered you the
[52:10] revelation that Jesus Christ had cleanse
[52:15] your soul now I'm trying to get you to
[52:18] see what I drove at it and it's what
[52:21] seemed like the blank all right to get
[52:25] you to see what a revelation really is
[52:28] then you're not having to say well what
[52:30] book do I need to read to get a
[52:32] revelation of the new birth well I
[52:36] showed you this morning to book your rig
[52:38] you're just read the Bible that's a good
[52:40] place to start and your prophet said
[52:42] read your Bible and pray alright so you
[52:46] don't realize you went through stages
[52:51] you know in other words I say okay come
[52:55] up and accept Jesus Christ as your
[52:57] Savior well so you come up and accept
[53:01] Jesus Christ as your Savior that's a
[53:05] revelation
[53:07] you're accepting the fact that he died
[53:10] for you there's a revelation to you then
[53:16] you were going through life and you
[53:17] realize hey I don't need to be doing
[53:19] these things somebody maybe preaches on
[53:22] it or something I said I mean you I
[53:24] don't need to be doing these things I
[53:26] need to quit this drinking smoking so
[53:29] it's you know well that's a revelation
[53:32] to you do you see the simplicity that
[53:37] I'm trying to make it and then you say
[53:42] well the baptism of the holy ghost Laura
[53:49] you believed it accepted it
[53:51] God accepted you and gay
[53:53] he's a baptismal oligos that's a
[53:55] revelation of Jesus Christ do you
[53:59] understand that
[54:00] that's what I'm trying to explain that's
[54:04] a revelation you're looking for
[54:07] something that you've walked through
[54:08] because I believe that I've always told
[54:13] you what was it this morning how's the
[54:16] canoe yes right through the baptism of
[54:19] the Holy Ghost just in one little
[54:20] message 3,000 outside right to the
[54:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost just by
[54:26] hearing a message but the disciples went
[54:29] three and 1/2 years right now do you
[54:37] understand what I'm saying some people
[54:39] go through real quick some people that
[54:43] takes a longer time I don't know what to
[54:46] express the wording of it but it takes a
[54:49] longer time I was two years in after
[54:51] coming into the message before I
[54:53] accepted anything to be called the
[54:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost well you
[55:00] believe the message you've done this is
[55:02] doing that you've baptized correctly
[55:04] what Oh because I knew that we we wasn't
[55:07] talking about what this prophet was
[55:09] talking about he said what's wrong
[55:14] brother Dale what what's your opinion of
[55:16] why that we're here 50 years after the
[55:19] prophets come what's your opinion you
[55:21] and me so you're not seeing what I'm
[55:28] talking about on the point what caught
[55:32] me in this message one thing was a man
[55:35] that was so honest that he'd tell his
[55:37] own stories of his life of the things
[55:42] that he'd done wrong you didn't get
[55:46] preachers to admit that they want to
[55:47] tell how good there was but I mean he
[55:50] didn't mind telling you how you done
[55:52] this and how you done that and things
[55:53] was wrong and he he had to repent here
[55:56] to do that was number one but number two
[56:01] was a man talking about a living God
[56:10] he was talking about something alive he
[56:15] wasn't talking about over yonder we're
[56:17] gonna get to heaven what's what we
[56:19] badness one day we'll get to heaven if
[56:21] we doing do it Methodists if we if we if
[56:23] we were okay if we don't we'll just jump
[56:25] up and down from justification
[56:27] sanctification and somewhere in there
[56:28] maybe we can get cleanse one day and if
[56:30] we happen to help fall rot and die we
[56:32] might go to heaven prophet never talked
[56:35] like that he talked of a reality of
[56:39] eternal life right here that was a
[56:45] wonderful thing to me I'm not looking
[56:47] for something to come if I never can
[56:52] quote anything else let me quote a one
[56:54] time brother unsaid and quote it for
[56:57] myself I'm not looking for the coming of
[57:00] the Lord I've preached it to you for 50
[57:03] years the new birth the Lord started his
[57:11] descending he started all the things he
[57:15] was doing when he come into you and a
[57:18] new birth you were on your way to heaven
[57:24] and didn't realize it everything was
[57:28] settled he turned a life had already
[57:32] begin here we Baptist will I hope them
[57:35] safe maybe I'm saved I don't know I'm
[57:37] but you know I'll hope so I feel like it
[57:39] sometimes sometimes I don't feel like it
[57:41] too good you saw I didn't talk like that
[57:44] well I hate to call you liar so many
[57:48] times but that's alright I'll just do it
[57:51] one more cuz I know the human mind and
[57:54] how we work we all come to basically
[57:59] some form of something like that looking
[58:01] for something way out in hope in one of
[58:05] these days to get to that place that
[58:08] prophet never talked like that when I'm
[58:13] listening to him I'm listening to him
[58:15] and it sounds like to me and my
[58:16] understanding
[58:18] it sounds like that we're up in heaven
[58:20] already and what's closer can you get to
[58:29] heaven than have an eternal life in your
[58:31] soul right well that's what you owe if
[58:41] you've got any turn a life in your soul
[58:45] there's no way to die there's no way to
[58:50] be lost I like the way brother Moe had a
[58:54] say in things and it don't sound good
[58:56] but it made a good point he said you
[58:59] can't sin enough to be lost if you're
[59:02] born again then or something you
[59:07] probably remember him saying that but it
[59:10] was just the truth you can't be lost if
[59:15] you're born again now here comes the
[59:17] point you might not be born again now
[59:18] that might be the whole case but that
[59:23] ain't got nothing to do with the
[59:24] statement of the truth of what it was
[59:27] think you said yeah but you're not gonna
[59:30] stand out to be in a Christian well now
[59:32] you own all evening to stay where the
[59:33] Prophet said we sin every day unless you
[59:37] want to say of him saying you backslide
[59:39] every day well you're throwing off on
[59:42] the Prophet now he's the one that said
[59:44] it
[59:45] and my Thor novel him no I'm saying what
[59:49] he said because that was the honesty of
[59:52] the man that caught me the basics of the
[59:56] Bible and the things I had a decent
[59:58] understanding maybe you don't understand
[1:00:01] what I mean would rather moat said if
[1:00:02] you just could you know knew much about
[1:00:05] a prophet then maybe we could talk on
[1:00:09] these things if brother Branham was a
[1:00:10] prophet I said look don't tell me about
[1:00:13] the things you saw he said I've seen the
[1:00:17] sick healed the dead raised the thing I
[1:00:19] said don't tell me that cuz I wasn't
[1:00:22] there but I said tell me what the man
[1:00:25] taught in the Bible
[1:00:26] I'll know whether or not he was a
[1:00:29] prophet by the Bible
[1:00:32] because at least had that much
[1:00:34] understanding you know the story oven
[1:00:39] they don't like me telling the things
[1:00:40] would forget it when I read the Bible
[1:00:44] the first time and I really read it on
[1:00:47] this basis from will be a Christian I
[1:00:48] need to know the word that was the
[1:00:51] places that took it oh and I started
[1:00:53] reading I come to Malachi for I told my
[1:00:55] wife I said according to my
[1:00:59] understanding what I'm reading here that
[1:01:03] in the end town there's gonna be two
[1:01:05] prophets come we'll see I hit Malachi 3
[1:01:08] Malachi 4 well they're gonna know where
[1:01:10] to straighten it out
[1:01:12] when brother Modi said brother Brad was
[1:01:15] a prophet I said word that Aetna Volvo
[1:01:17] see we've had this we didn't take too
[1:01:19] much on to being having prophets know it
[1:01:22] except a teacher occasionally we'd
[1:01:25] accept a pastor and an evangelist but we
[1:01:30] didn't deal with possible to prophets
[1:01:32] but they didn't exist to us madness so
[1:01:35] when he said that I said where's it at
[1:01:37] in the word and he told me Malachi for
[1:01:40] well you know what I've said I said to
[1:01:43] him I said all right we get this from
[1:01:46] Ellicott three I won't know about
[1:01:49] Malachi 4 or excuse I went through
[1:01:51] medical 4x they don't know about Malachi
[1:01:53] 3 he said that's John the Baptist okay
[1:01:59] so we got that stripe see I run into
[1:02:01] somebody they knew a little bit about
[1:02:03] the Bible he says that's Malachi 3 it's
[1:02:06] John the Baptist and he took me through
[1:02:08] the scripture look 117 or desert filming
[1:02:11] through that you know I had read those
[1:02:14] things and studied them and I knew what
[1:02:16] the Bible said about those time I'm just
[1:02:21] saying that to you was you looking for a
[1:02:23] prophet to God in your understanding of
[1:02:27] the Bible was you looking for a prophet
[1:02:29] to come I didn't know what I was looking
[1:02:33] for I just knew that if I will said it
[1:02:36] well then when I saw God when I was 11
[1:02:41] years old
[1:02:44] from that day I will own I wanted to see
[1:02:48] that God and when I heard this man
[1:02:52] starting preaching there was that man
[1:02:55] that was said that builded talking to me
[1:03:03] through a man's message that he was
[1:03:06] bringing I wasn't looking for that God
[1:03:09] anymore I could see him in my hand
[1:03:18] because at least there's one thing about
[1:03:19] it he talked about a God I could I could
[1:03:23] kind of so say I told you about it I've
[1:03:26] told some women and then I was a deacon
[1:03:28] 23 years old you know I told one God one
[1:03:31] day about some things and that God had
[1:03:34] spoke to them about and that's over
[1:03:35] deacon and he said you need to go to
[1:03:37] Pentecostal turn well see I didn't know
[1:03:40] what he was telling me the truth well I
[1:03:43] didn't know where knowing he was telling
[1:03:45] me the truth I never did get to the
[1:03:47] Pentecostal church I come right on to
[1:03:50] this message uh-huh now Church listen
[1:03:57] all those virtues are of the same
[1:04:01] material it's all the revealed word it's
[1:04:11] the word made alive now in doing that
[1:04:20] and it being that word made alive to you
[1:04:22] and I then think about what it says so
[1:04:28] go ahead a few well brothers and pull up
[1:04:33] 2nd Peter 1 because I want you to follow
[1:04:39] a line
[1:04:45] Simon Peter a servant an apostle of
[1:04:48] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[1:04:50] like precious faith now how long did we
[1:04:54] dwell on that like precious faith like
[1:04:59] precious faith means the same faith that
[1:05:03] recruiter alight precious faith means
[1:05:07] the same faith so now everybody's got
[1:05:10] the same new birth never new birth is a
[1:05:17] sign
[1:05:17] it's like precious faith come on man
[1:05:24] with us through the righteousness of God
[1:05:26] intersect Grace and peace and multiplied
[1:05:28] unto you through the knowledge of God in
[1:05:29] Jesus or save according had his divine
[1:05:31] power hath given to us all things that
[1:05:34] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:05:36] the knowledge of him that called us to
[1:05:38] glory and virtue or by our given unto us
[1:05:41] exceeding exceeding great and precious
[1:05:44] promises that by these you might be
[1:05:47] partakers of the what divine nature
[1:05:51] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:05:54] the world through lust the new birth
[1:05:56] gives you his divine nature it's the
[1:06:01] same like precious faith it's the same
[1:06:06] faith come on why don't we listen to
[1:06:11] brother Branham he said the baptism of
[1:06:13] the Holy Ghost then my name is quote
[1:06:15] there's a harbor to be closed he said
[1:06:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that you
[1:06:18] now have within you is the same baptism
[1:06:21] when the Holy Ghost that walked on the
[1:06:22] shores of Galilee the same Holy Ghost
[1:06:28] you have living in you is the same Holy
[1:06:31] Ghost he said that was in the early
[1:06:33] church see that's what we don't want to
[1:06:38] believe that there's something within
[1:06:40] our human abilities and it cuts off when
[1:06:42] that is stated why the Bible says it's
[1:06:49] one faith one Lord one baptism one God
[1:06:55] and Father of us all and in you all
[1:06:58] right to look those of like precious
[1:07:05] faith no words the same faith so ever
[1:07:09] born-again believer has the same new
[1:07:11] birth the same faith the same revealed
[1:07:15] word and each one of them had
[1:07:18] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:07:20] with the Holy Ghost which is the three
[1:07:22] stages and each one is a revelation in
[1:07:24] that stage I remember when God took the
[1:07:28] world from me I remember when I come to
[1:07:35] the Lord but you see that's why I know
[1:07:39] all of these things they said brother
[1:07:41] Brian said don't don't you know go back
[1:07:43] to somebody and try to get them to come
[1:07:44] to the church or don't come to the Lord
[1:07:46] I've told you about it my sister she
[1:07:50] came to me in the church hour one night
[1:07:51] in a revival with heaven and I guess was
[1:07:54] opened was already married yeah you know
[1:07:57] she said Samuel said you need to go to
[1:08:00] the Lord get to the Lord and said now
[1:08:01] you know JC which was her husband he got
[1:08:04] killed in a car wreck you know JC said
[1:08:07] he was lost now but said he won't never
[1:08:12] be saved that he is lost well you know
[1:08:18] what I thought more of his life and
[1:08:21] doing because I lived with him day by
[1:08:23] day sure he had his problems but I know
[1:08:28] she had more problems than he had
[1:08:30] problems so she wouldn't want it needed
[1:08:34] to be coming talking to me I've told you
[1:08:37] about the Deacons coming to my house to
[1:08:40] try to get me to come to the Lord and
[1:08:42] get saved and I told him I said look I'm
[1:08:46] living a better life than your Deacon
[1:08:48] board is living and they certainly
[1:08:51] didn't want me to tell us stories of all
[1:08:53] the things I knew let's see how serious
[1:09:00] but one day something struck within my
[1:09:02] heart and said you're letting the church
[1:09:06] get in your way when blood around them
[1:09:08] said that years later and I heard him I
[1:09:10] knew exactly what
[1:09:12] he said we let the church get in our way
[1:09:15] Oh God
[1:09:18] that's exactly what I'd done I'll let
[1:09:20] the church keep me from coming to you
[1:09:24] and I was already coming up toward this
[1:09:27] message time by the end you know getting
[1:09:30] close to coming into the message you see
[1:09:34] that's why I know what the new birth is
[1:09:35] I don't confess my new birth is just I
[1:09:39] walked up and shook the preacher at hand
[1:09:46] my new birth I can put it right through
[1:09:48] the Bible from where I started in in my
[1:09:51] whole Christian journey then walk right
[1:09:55] down to my Christian journey right out
[1:09:57] to where I am now and know that God is
[1:10:01] real I've met that God and I'm not
[1:10:08] talking about brother Brandon being that
[1:10:10] God I'm talking about run around and
[1:10:11] brought me to that God he's not that God
[1:10:16] but he brought me to God I don't care
[1:10:19] what you tell me he done or is you know
[1:10:22] or whatever you you can come up with all
[1:10:24] these tales all you want to I'm gonna
[1:10:26] tell you to get on leave me alone
[1:10:27] because the man brought me to God thank
[1:10:34] God for that and I can honor him on that
[1:10:38] basis and say I don't believe all these
[1:10:40] stories then and about it because I know
[1:10:45] what he done he was a human mortal that
[1:10:48] made human mistakes right when I was
[1:10:53] admit to this much he was the closest
[1:10:55] thing that we'll ever see the guard
[1:10:57] while in this journey of life I will
[1:11:00] admit to that because that's what I'm
[1:11:03] trying to tell you about trying to get
[1:11:07] you to see about well God is real and
[1:11:10] then he's give everybody the new birth
[1:11:13] that won't sit and receives it it's far
[1:11:16] you well how do I accept it what I do
[1:11:21] just start praying just ask God to
[1:11:24] forgive you
[1:11:25] just asking to accept you you've
[1:11:29] accepted him say Lord I've accepted you
[1:11:31] as my sniper now you accept me don't
[1:11:37] what he's saying when I got here I throw
[1:11:40] all that away
[1:11:41] look listen now let's get to the one
[1:11:48] point for this afternoon if it's true
[1:11:56] that everyone's faith is the same then
[1:12:02] everyone would have to go through
[1:12:03] justification same case in the baptism
[1:12:05] with Holy Ghost to get worth in a hat
[1:12:08] now if that's not true I want somebody
[1:12:10] to tell me illness I won't know a
[1:12:11] shortcut
[1:12:12] you know what I mean I want to know a
[1:12:17] shortcut to this thing if I can find one
[1:12:19] but I ain't gonna find no shortcut it's
[1:12:22] all the same everybody's responsible to
[1:12:24] sign make your calling and election sure
[1:12:31] right search out God for yourself you'll
[1:12:40] find out he's been searching for you the
[1:12:41] whole time right but listen see then if
[1:12:49] it's true then as we were reading coming
[1:12:59] down we didn't get all the way down but
[1:13:00] that's ok if you will pull that up
[1:13:03] brothers and we'll go over to verse
[1:13:04] eight and get started try to get get
[1:13:07] through like this giving all diligence
[1:13:11] verse 5 bruh add to your faith virtue
[1:13:18] and divert your knowledge and a
[1:13:23] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:13:24] patience patience godliness for these
[1:13:27] things be in you and abound they make
[1:13:29] you neither something neither barren nor
[1:13:32] unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord
[1:13:34] Jesus Christ have you ever read to not
[1:13:37] first
[1:13:41] and you put it on that brothers and get
[1:13:44] the ninth verse have you ever read to
[1:13:48] not first you know what it says but he
[1:13:56] that lacketh these things it's blind and
[1:14:00] cannot see afar off okay now watch the
[1:14:09] point if you're born again hey they're
[1:14:16] getting it we hit lack of these things
[1:14:19] is blind and cannot see afar off and
[1:14:21] that's forgotten that he was purged from
[1:14:23] his old sins
[1:14:24] now remember the point though if you
[1:14:28] have the faith the light precious faith
[1:14:32] the born-again experience you can never
[1:14:35] be lost so it's not saying what we're
[1:14:38] reading we read that for what we think
[1:14:44] but he that lacketh these things is
[1:14:48] blind how could you have the things how
[1:14:51] could Peter be saying of light precious
[1:14:54] faith and divine nature and adding these
[1:14:58] things to your faith virtue or knowledge
[1:15:01] temperance how could he be seeing saying
[1:15:03] that and then say what we think he said
[1:15:06] we think he said we can be lost that's
[1:15:14] not what he's saying it's impossible to
[1:15:19] be lost if you're truly born again so
[1:15:24] why don't you read it correctly he that
[1:15:26] lacketh these things is blind if I'm
[1:15:33] born again and all the half of us faith
[1:15:37] I'm still pretty blind so are you
[1:15:42] because you don't have eyes to see he's
[1:15:47] healing don't my huh
[1:15:48] we want to read it one way instead of
[1:15:50] reading it the correct way
[1:15:52] but he that lacketh these things is
[1:15:54] blind and cannot see afar off and that's
[1:15:56] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:15:57] old fence now come on if you have one
[1:16:04] virtue I know this is carnal but I'll
[1:16:11] give you the pulpit to explain that
[1:16:13] Scripture if you'll just give me the
[1:16:15] opportunity to ask you a couple of
[1:16:17] questions that's all I ask in return all
[1:16:22] I asked is if you have the divine nature
[1:16:27] if you have the like precious faith and
[1:16:29] Peter had it and then he turns around
[1:16:35] and tells us add to your faith virtue
[1:16:38] knowledge temperance patient alright or
[1:16:44] if these things be in you and abound
[1:16:47] heap up you know they make you that you
[1:16:51] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[1:16:52] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:16:54] Christ if these virtues are in you
[1:16:57] there's no way you could be lost I don't
[1:17:02] get the scripture but he that lacketh
[1:17:04] these things if I have one virtue I
[1:17:10] don't like these virtues I have one you
[1:17:16] say you sure are carnal you explain it
[1:17:21] he can't be saying that you can be lost
[1:17:24] you can't be lost it's just telling you
[1:17:29] he that lacketh these things is blind if
[1:17:32] I don't have some of these things I'm
[1:17:34] blind but if I have one that's all I
[1:17:39] need right
[1:17:43] if I have the new birth I can never be
[1:17:46] lost so he's not talking about me but if
[1:17:50] I lack all of these things don't have
[1:17:53] any of these things I am blind cannot
[1:17:58] see afar off and right but if I have one
[1:18:05] of them just to do path oh you thought
[1:18:11] about something that ain't bad this folk
[1:18:13] I think that old once saved always say
[1:18:18] thing they brother branham said if he's
[1:18:20] truly one saved he's in your face right
[1:18:25] come on let's quote him he that lacketh
[1:18:30] east thing if you like every one of them
[1:18:32] yes you're lost you can't see afar off
[1:18:38] but if you got one of them and that's
[1:18:43] who the man is talking to up here he's
[1:18:47] talking to the church or for the rather
[1:18:50] brethren give diligence to make your
[1:18:52] calling and election sure make sure
[1:18:56] you're saved now you can be upset with
[1:18:59] me all you want to about me hollering
[1:19:00] and screaming and repeating myself to
[1:19:03] you and you say well he just turned down
[1:19:05] mind you my experience that I had he's
[1:19:08] he's taken away my my hopes that I had
[1:19:13] with a much hopes if it's just fit if
[1:19:15] it's just built on something flim-flam Z
[1:19:17] and your prophet would call it that if
[1:19:20] it's built on any thing that you can say
[1:19:22] you've done if we put our salvation on
[1:19:26] anything we've done or didn't do
[1:19:29] where has he got anything to do with it
[1:19:35] do you understand what I'm saying here
[1:19:38] if you don't have these things sure
[1:19:41] you're totally lost cannot see afar off
[1:19:45] and forgotten that you was all purged or
[1:19:47] forgotten that you had a rechristening
[1:19:50] journey aren't you got justified or you
[1:19:52] gotta yell but he that lacketh
[1:19:56] but if I have one of them I don't like
[1:20:00] them
[1:20:01] buy of the new birth I can't be lost
[1:20:05] he's talking about salvation to a
[1:20:08] Baptist you talking about eternal
[1:20:11] security when I heard that prophet
[1:20:13] explained eternal security I wasn't a
[1:20:15] Baptist no longer I didn't have them
[1:20:18] ideas in my mind I had what he's saying
[1:20:22] he's telling me hey if you're truly born
[1:20:25] again you can never be lost
[1:20:30] well if you got one born in one thing if
[1:20:35] you've got what the new birth that's not
[1:20:37] talking about you now let's get down to
[1:20:44] the serious part of it now back up now
[1:20:47] brothers verse five come back down to
[1:20:52] verse 5 it says a very odd statement it
[1:21:03] says add to your faith
[1:21:12] don't say at his faith come on
[1:21:17] he says add to your faith what you see
[1:21:23] my faith of my human ability is just my
[1:21:27] ability to believe God and stay on to
[1:21:30] that so that's nobody's only add to your
[1:21:35] faith but can't you see if you have the
[1:21:46] new birth he has given you his faith
[1:21:52] right if you have the duper he has given
[1:21:58] you his faith but it says there to add
[1:22:02] to your faith
[1:22:13] but I ran them off of a message called
[1:22:16] oneness he's talking about Mary and the
[1:22:25] seed of the woman nor the seed of the
[1:22:31] woman number one wouldn't have no seed
[1:22:36] right so what it was back in Genesis
[1:22:39] I'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[1:22:42] seed of the woman that was a promise of
[1:22:48] the coming Messiah right now come on
[1:22:53] that was the promise genesis 3:15 again
[1:22:57] was the first definite promise of the
[1:23:00] coming Messiah
[1:23:03] I'll put enmity between thy seed the
[1:23:06] seed of the woman the woman doesn't have
[1:23:08] a seed she was given a seed but you know
[1:23:12] what once she was given that seed it
[1:23:14] became her seed coach Jesus Christ is
[1:23:19] the seed of the woman right he's the
[1:23:26] seed of the woman he it's not the seed
[1:23:28] of the woman that he give her no he gave
[1:23:33] her his seed it became her seed now in
[1:23:40] that sign the references of Mary he said
[1:23:44] he gave it or give it to her then it's
[1:23:49] her seed now watching this is my that's
[1:23:56] what I'm reading he said God gave it to
[1:24:00] me
[1:24:00] it's my he gave me my arm I'm reading
[1:24:12] this is my hand he gave it to me this is
[1:24:16] my voice he give it to me and the seed
[1:24:21] that was Mary had nothing to do
[1:24:25] it was something God did himself
[1:24:30] I'll put enmity twins I seem to see the
[1:24:33] woman the seed of the woman was Jesus
[1:24:36] Christ given to Mary it became her seed
[1:24:43] right this is my God gave it to me
[1:24:49] it's my now you reading add to your
[1:24:59] faith because God gave it to you
[1:25:07] well once he gave it to you becomes
[1:25:09] yours
[1:25:10] he ain't an Indian giver come on and
[1:25:14] then to get Ringo take it back that's
[1:25:17] why you can't be lost if you have it
[1:25:18] that's once then that can't be laying
[1:25:20] right or what are thinking he's it lock
[1:25:23] up these things you can't put that in
[1:25:25] the new birth this is my God gave it to
[1:25:37] me he gave me the new birth
[1:25:43] now you with he gave you the new birth
[1:25:47] it belongs to you now what's it be the
[1:25:55] same material it does not say that he
[1:25:58] gave it does not say in the writing of
[1:26:01] the Bible let's see this is faith add to
[1:26:08] your faith it doesn't say add to your
[1:26:10] virtue
[1:26:11] it doesn't say add to your knowledge
[1:26:14] brother Branham uses that away and it's
[1:26:16] correct but it doesn't say that there
[1:26:19] does it add to your faith virtue
[1:26:21] knowledge temperance patient why because
[1:26:24] it's emphasizing more that it's the same
[1:26:26] thing
[1:26:29] virtue is the same thing as faith
[1:26:34] because it is eternal life it is the
[1:26:37] word
[1:26:39] that is revealed virtue the word
[1:26:45] revealed knowledge the word revealed
[1:26:48] what it doesn't say add to your I do
[1:26:50] your add to your doesn't have to because
[1:26:52] it already give it to you when you gave
[1:26:56] you his faith you accepted that as your
[1:27:00] Savior then that's your faith it belongs
[1:27:08] to you why don't you take you to the way
[1:27:11] you see Church that's the positive point
[1:27:14] that I'm telling you then when I heard
[1:27:16] this prophet
[1:27:17] I quit looking out younger well I didn't
[1:27:22] look well maybe you didn't know how
[1:27:23] nothing about looking and I'm not being
[1:27:25] sarcastic I'm just trying to tell you to
[1:27:27] get out of that stage of trying to think
[1:27:29] different I'm just telling you the truth
[1:27:32] I quit looking in heaven I quit 40 years
[1:27:37] ago trying to go to heaven this son I'll
[1:27:41] go ahead with this I'm not looking for
[1:27:44] the rapture oh no because the Bible says
[1:27:51] the Dead's got to raise first so the
[1:27:55] resurrection has got to come before the
[1:27:57] rapture quit looking for the rapture the
[1:28:02] resurrection is a nice next thing then
[1:28:07] the rapture comes after that to get it
[1:28:11] right then you win an order or what
[1:28:14] you're doing I'm not looking for some
[1:28:17] kind of something here that old ones
[1:28:19] these days that rapture is gonna take
[1:28:20] place you hear the preachers preach and
[1:28:22] not even thinking about what they're
[1:28:24] saying
[1:28:26] you realize you bypass the resurrection
[1:28:29] if you're if you're not putting in there
[1:28:32] is importance and it must not be
[1:28:33] important to you what the resurrection
[1:28:37] is the next thing right don't know there
[1:28:44] the next one is the the triplet no no
[1:28:47] don't get over there now get off of it
[1:28:48] and get in the line
[1:28:50] the next thing to the bride
[1:28:52] is the resurrection we sure hope will II
[1:28:56] don't believe we're gonna be here in the
[1:28:57] tribulation no surely we don't believe
[1:29:01] that so the next thing is the
[1:29:06] resurrection now
[1:29:11] I'm gonna say this and I'll drop back
[1:29:13] and just quit they said why are we
[1:29:19] looking for something to come instead of
[1:29:24] looking at what's here the Prophet made
[1:29:29] a statement one day he said I'm not
[1:29:33] looking for his coming he remember that
[1:29:38] he said I'm not looking for his coming
[1:29:43] what because it was there to him see he
[1:29:48] had something positive
[1:29:51] he wasn't looking for something to come
[1:29:54] he was looking at what it was and
[1:30:00] knowing that was already there
[1:30:10] they've always said to you maybe don't
[1:30:12] mean anything I'm sorry but I just say
[1:30:15] it maybe don't mean anything some things
[1:30:19] the Prophet says would you realize he
[1:30:25] made a statement on the raptured miss
[1:30:26] wraps her message he said it has been
[1:30:31] spoken now let it come to pass now
[1:30:39] here's the way I think he was looking at
[1:30:43] something positive right he was looking
[1:30:50] for negatives no he was looking at
[1:30:52] something positive do you realize that
[1:30:54] he never said that that had never been a
[1:30:56] rapture he spoke it into existence
[1:31:03] that's how much I believe that he spoke
[1:31:08] it into existence it would be the
[1:31:14] capable of coming to pass when the
[1:31:19] people believe it now and quit looking
[1:31:25] for it but looking at it a lot of
[1:31:35] difference in looking for something
[1:31:36] looking at something what do you think I
[1:31:43] think we've been around here 50 years
[1:31:45] for the purpose of Almighty God to
[1:31:47] fulfill his word in somebody it ain't
[1:31:51] been no haphazardly no problems no this
[1:31:54] out of the other he knew before the
[1:31:56] world ever begun it was gonna be that
[1:31:57] away he hasn't had to add any time to it
[1:32:00] he hasn't had to take any time away from
[1:32:02] it it's all different exactly on line
[1:32:08] and when somebody realizes it may I
[1:32:11] quote it this way what are we supposed
[1:32:15] to do then brother Colley
[1:32:19] he's been diagnosis it
[1:32:22] huh he had a good point doctor said well
[1:32:27] sometime said you'll die with this or
[1:32:29] something told him some way he said why
[1:32:32] does it matter if I die with that or
[1:32:33] something else now I'm a mix up his
[1:32:34] words and get but it's pretty close he
[1:32:38] was plainly telling that doctor what
[1:32:40] that make any difference but I live
[1:32:44] right now that what make a difference
[1:32:49] huh I positive just put it back and just
[1:32:54] say thank you bye stops I'm healed and
[1:32:59] just walk into it well if they don't
[1:33:02] never come if they don't never come to
[1:33:04] PI so I'll meet you on the other side
[1:33:06] like what oh brother Howard Carroll said
[1:33:08] he said sage I'm getting he said
[1:33:10] somebody now for misquote it that's
[1:33:12] pretty close when he said he said
[1:33:14] something's gotta happen to me pretty
[1:33:15] quick god I'm going one way or the other
[1:33:16] no I think that's about a lot of his
[1:33:21] waitress what was he's reading other
[1:33:23] nights and brother Joe can probably give
[1:33:26] it to us but he was telling how many
[1:33:29] people here is 17 but above there's a
[1:33:34] lot of us it's almost the largest single
[1:33:39] group look I think it's it's 25 to 50 or
[1:33:44] something is the largest group you know
[1:33:47] amount of people that's a lot of people
[1:33:49] here everybody this 70 years old raise
[1:33:53] your hand hey I'm looking at least 30
[1:33:58] hands or something but what does that
[1:34:03] got to do with it
[1:34:10] I never thought I'd get this a home I
[1:34:12] never wanted to get this home and I
[1:34:18] enjoy life I do I enjoy living but I
[1:34:23] never thought I'd get here but that's
[1:34:26] the way the Lord made it so I'm supposed
[1:34:29] to be happy about it huh like I've
[1:34:33] always said don't told it in the
[1:34:34] fellowship meetings you know that if we
[1:34:36] didn't get away from here pretty quick
[1:34:37] we're gonna start having a fellowship
[1:34:39] meetings in a nursing home well if we
[1:34:42] don't get out of here pretty quick
[1:34:43] there's gonna be a lot of us and the
[1:34:45] nursing home well do you know one

[1:35:20] the gold is going to Rome he said if we
[1:35:26] just took ten thousand dollars and
[1:35:29] bought gold he said look where we would
[1:35:34] be right I mean you realize how many
[1:35:39] million that would be billions probably
