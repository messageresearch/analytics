[21:53] reading of the scriptures
[21:54] and things we want to do the lord's

[22:15] and your thoughts amen that the lord
[22:18] would bless each one
[22:20] father we thank you
[22:22] for a day and a time
[22:26] that we can really sing a song
[22:28] and think about the words of a song
[22:32] that truly you would open the eyes of
[22:34] our heart
[22:36] lord that we may see you
[22:38] because that's our desire and we know
[22:40] that we can't see you with physical eyes
[22:42] and things
[22:44] because that's
[22:45] can be faked by satan
[22:48] but yet we know for a certainty
[22:51] that you can open the eyes of our heart
[22:52] and we can see you have you away with us
[22:55] forgive our sins and guide us by thy
[22:57] grace and love
[22:58] and just keep us
[23:00] as we walk in you remember the sequence
[23:02] remember abby lord and that whole
[23:04] problem and just take away that
[23:06] vomiting and things that are bothering
[23:08] her today and let everything be all
[23:09] right
[23:10] we love you and we thank you
[23:12] god each one of us forgive our sins and
[23:15] keep us in your love in jesus name
[23:18] amen
[23:27] ephesians 1 verse 8
[23:31] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[23:33] all wisdom and prudence
[23:35] having made known unto us the mystery of
[23:37] his will
[23:38] according to his good pleasure which he
[23:40] hath purposed in himself
[23:42] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[23:44] of times he might gather together in one
[23:46] all things in christ but which are in
[23:49] heaven
[23:50] and which are on earth even in
[23:53] him all right
[23:55] gathering all there into him okay
[24:02] matthew
[24:04] 13 36
[24:06] he answered and said unto them he that
[24:08] soweth the good seed
[24:10] is the son of man
[24:12] the field is the world the good seed are
[24:14] the children of the kingdom but the
[24:16] tires are the children of the wicked one
[24:18] now that's
[24:19] self-explanatory
[24:21] or should be
[24:22] see the enemy that sowed them is the
[24:24] devil the harvest is the end of the
[24:26] world
[24:27] and the reapers are the angels okay amen
[24:31] so let's just go now and read from
[24:34] because we'll go from matthew six
[24:38] i just thought it's cause you'll see
[24:39] when we get into the to the message part
[24:41] you'll see what i'm talking about okay
[24:44] ready
[24:45] let's all quote it together then
[24:48] after this manner therefore pray ye
[24:52] our father which art in heaven
[24:55] hallowed be thy name
[24:58] thy kingdom come
[25:00] thy will be done in earth
[25:03] as it is in heaven
[25:05] give us this day our daily bread
[25:08] and forgive us our debts
[25:10] as we forgive our debtors
[25:13] and lead us not into temptation
[25:16] but deliver us from evil
[25:18] for thine is the kingdom the power and
[25:21] glory
[25:22] forever
[25:23] amen you may be seated lord at his
[25:26] blessing to the reading of the word
[25:31] now trying to
[25:34] continue i thought because
[25:36] i hope you understand it's not
[25:39] a lot of preachers they don't do that
[25:41] but i can't when company comes in very
[25:44] much i can't just
[25:45] continue a thought i have to back up and
[25:48] relate into that thought enough to
[25:51] maybe try to help somebody because you
[25:53] want to be a help you don't want to be a
[25:54] hindrance
[25:55] and then they come in and hear you and
[25:57] they
[25:57] wonder a lot what we say anyway so
[26:00] i pray that it was a brother and sister
[26:02] in christ
[26:04] and
[26:04] maybe they'll be back with us so
[26:07] you know
[26:08] but
[26:08] thinking about the things that we've
[26:10] been talking about this
[26:14] dispensation of the son of man
[26:17] all right
[26:19] then we know that when we finish this we
[26:22] will go into the dispensation of the son
[26:25] of god
[26:26] all right but the key to understanding
[26:29] the whole bible
[26:31] is we talk about
[26:36] god having three names son of god son of
[26:39] man
[26:40] son of david
[26:42] well you know
[26:43] uh that's true
[26:45] but there's more manifestations and i
[26:48] hope you've caught that part of us
[26:51] injecting it like that he's called the
[26:53] son of abraham
[26:55] all right
[26:56] and
[26:57] then
[26:58] realizing then that
[27:00] we've got to come back to a position
[27:04] of in our thoughts
[27:06] back to
[27:08] the son of man in the last days
[27:11] before there will be a rapture of the
[27:12] church
[27:14] all right then in doing it
[27:16] i know that
[27:18] it took me i don't know how many times
[27:20] seemed like it was four times that
[27:22] uh listening to
[27:25] the message the unveiling of god it was
[27:27] just a point that we used to each one of
[27:30] us would like bring a tape and we had
[27:32] one of those battery-powered recorders
[27:34] and we'd listen to tapes going to work
[27:36] in back you didn't have the cook up you
[27:38] know like into the cigarette lighters if
[27:40] you did you didn't even have a cigarette
[27:42] lighter in the old cars you know
[27:44] things like that but
[27:46] i remember it about the fourth time that
[27:48] we listened to the unveiling of god in a
[27:52] row
[27:53] then i knew that there had to be
[27:55] something connected
[27:57] and then i could see then from what he
[27:59] was bringing and i'll get to that later
[28:02] on
[28:02] that see you've got
[28:06] son of man
[28:07] son of god
[28:09] son of david all right
[28:12] see but now really what you've got
[28:13] you've got son of man son of god
[28:16] son of man son of david
[28:21] all right
[28:22] so you've got that to be you got to deal
[28:25] with it in that form or you'll never
[28:27] understand because
[28:29] now like what i'm trying to say to you
[28:31] you could not come to the son of god
[28:34] the baptism of the holy ghost the new
[28:36] birth the things like that
[28:38] until we first come what son of man
[28:42] all right then we can get the son of man
[28:44] out of the way then you can see because
[28:46] of the son of man
[28:48] a way was made that the son of god
[28:52] could come into
[28:53] the hearts of the people because he
[28:56] would give up his life and it would come
[28:57] back
[28:59] all right so it would make a way
[29:02] all right so now
[29:04] you just have to take this as my own
[29:06] thoughts because it's way i've always
[29:08] preached it and believe it
[29:10] so you come into the church ages we'll
[29:11] cover that the seven church ages that
[29:14] you've got at dealing with son of god
[29:17] all right
[29:18] but then how could you go to the
[29:20] millennial reign as son of david
[29:26] are you listening
[29:28] the only way you can come to the son of
[29:30] god
[29:31] the new birth
[29:34] now listen
[29:35] the only way you can you can come the
[29:37] son of god the new birth is for the fact
[29:40] that the son of man
[29:43] had to come
[29:44] and relink or give up that
[29:48] life that was within him to come back on
[29:51] you
[29:51] to make it in the son of god
[29:54] right
[29:55] all right well now how can you go from
[29:57] son of god
[30:00] the son of david
[30:02] and you'll see this message
[30:04] is so perfect
[30:08] until it just baffles my
[30:11] human i'm not that smart but it baffles
[30:13] my human intelligence
[30:15] to hear of a seventh grade educated man
[30:18] and he'd do like that he said okay
[30:20] in in the unveiling of god he'd say son
[30:23] of god son of man son of god
[30:26] he said then just for a little while
[30:30] he comes back as son of man
[30:33] and then you go to son of david and i
[30:35] said
[30:36] oh
[30:38] amen but remember son of man
[30:41] is earthly
[30:43] doings that's what we're trying to talk
[30:45] about this morning see man was what lost
[30:48] the world was you know we're going to
[30:49] cover it the the world and things is
[30:51] what was lost
[30:53] and man lost the world all right
[30:56] see now to return that back
[30:59] we've got to come back then in the last
[31:01] days the son of man
[31:05] to an earthly
[31:08] revelation part things manifestation
[31:12] dispensations whatever you want to call
[31:14] it before he could go to the israel
[31:17] as the son of david
[31:20] because now remember what he's going to
[31:22] do
[31:23] when he goes to israel
[31:26] look at the perfection
[31:29] and i'm just putting these in to let you
[31:31] think and we'll come back and hit some
[31:33] of it see when he goes to israel he'll
[31:36] go
[31:37] through two prophets right
[31:40] son of man
[31:44] now he can't be son of david to them
[31:45] just
[31:46] immediately
[31:48] he gives that 144 000
[31:51] eternal life
[31:54] right
[31:55] there's the son of god
[31:58] so when he goes to israel it will be son
[32:00] of man through the two prophets they'll
[32:03] preach the message the holy ghost will
[32:05] fall giving them eternal life and then
[32:08] they'll realize
[32:09] he's the son of david
[32:11] we'll see how the perfect part but we
[32:13] can't just do that in the church ages
[32:16] we've got to go son of man
[32:18] son of god
[32:20] son of man
[32:23] for a little while now keep that in your
[32:25] mind and just let that ponder in your
[32:27] hearts
[32:28] and your desires and you'll think about
[32:30] some things that you'll see
[32:32] then what we're trying to do
[32:35] all right
[32:36] now
[32:37] not to back up too much but to back up
[32:39] to
[32:41] excuse me where we were talking about
[32:42] this morning
[32:46] that on the future home the prophet said
[32:49] this is my part of the earth
[32:52] he's saying that's what god is
[32:54] saying come down a voice a dove and a
[32:57] voice saying this is my part of the
[33:00] earth that i have redeemed
[33:02] it's saying what it says there in the
[33:05] scripture
[33:06] this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[33:07] pleased to dwell
[33:09] but he said literally it's saying
[33:12] you understand what the prophet is doing
[33:14] he's breaking that down to literal
[33:16] understanding to the point that he's
[33:19] saying
[33:20] the voice was saying it
[33:22] this is my part of the earth that i have
[33:25] redeemed and from this part of the earth
[33:28] i will redeem the rest of it
[33:30] so his body had to be redeemed
[33:34] not because it was sinful
[33:38] but because it had a beginning
[33:42] the body was not eternal
[33:44] it had a beginning
[33:46] all right
[33:47] see then by doing that
[33:52] we come on over where brother branham
[33:54] was talking about
[33:56] jesus was part of the earth that the
[33:59] holy ghost descended upon
[34:02] see the human element
[34:04] that was a human element
[34:07] he could have given you a blood
[34:08] transfusion
[34:11] but just remember he's not just
[34:14] he's not just
[34:15] body soul and spirit
[34:17] jesus christ and then god comes down
[34:21] that soul and spirit
[34:23] was the whole soul and spirit of
[34:25] almighty god
[34:27] or else he was just a man now what are
[34:29] you going to deal with him if he was
[34:30] just a man
[34:32] this man was the lord jesus christ god
[34:35] made flesh
[34:37] verse 14 said and the word was made
[34:39] flesh
[34:40] all right see then seeing that we've got
[34:42] it in the correct order
[34:44] by way of the prophet
[34:47] that he comes down to that earth
[34:49] and man fell in the earth
[34:52] sure we fell in the soul in the garden
[34:55] but we lost more than that remember this
[34:57] morning
[34:58] we lost more we'll get back to it in a
[35:00] minute we lost these bodies
[35:05] that's what we lost in the garden
[35:08] because even though you could come back
[35:10] and you could if you could give eternal
[35:11] life somewhat to mankind
[35:15] adam's body was not eternal
[35:22] no way that you you can bring the full
[35:24] plan of redemption
[35:26] all right
[35:27] see then what did we lose
[35:29] as the prophet said it on proven his
[35:31] word
[35:33] he said
[35:34] where we go through water baptism
[35:37] in the holy ghost baptism
[35:39] then the holy ghost comes down at the
[35:41] fire baptism
[35:42] and claims his creation
[35:46] earth this
[35:48] listen
[35:50] the same as it did him
[35:54] the holy ghost and god is the self-same
[35:56] spirit see it cannot come
[35:58] see it comes down and claims
[36:01] this body
[36:03] for the resurrection
[36:07] you see when that holy spirit came down
[36:09] on jesus on the river jordan it claimed
[36:12] him
[36:13] his body
[36:16] when you receive the new birth
[36:21] amen
[36:22] right when you receive the new birth
[36:25] claims is made upon your body
[36:28] that's why we don't get a new body
[36:31] we get this body
[36:33] redeemed
[36:35] all right
[36:36] see now that ought to be dawning on us a
[36:39] that is of what god has done
[36:42] that when he gave you the new birth
[36:45] he not just gave you eternal life in
[36:47] your soul
[36:50] he laid claims on that body that you're
[36:53] living in
[36:57] then why shouldn't we
[36:59] think about it being quickened one day
[37:02] to be made eternal
[37:04] all right
[37:05] now
[37:06] when we got down the end of the park
[37:07] this morning hitting it just a little
[37:10] but brother branham was talking about
[37:12] in that future home
[37:14] on that river jordan
[37:16] he said think of it the holy
[37:18] ghost descending upon earth
[37:20] jesus and that holy blood now watch he
[37:24] said i hope it don't go too far that
[37:26] holy blood was created with god the
[37:28] blood
[37:28] the life the creation of god jesus was
[37:31] the beginning
[37:33] of the creation of god
[37:37] that's revelation 3 14 right the message
[37:39] to this age jesus was the beginning of
[37:42] the creation of god
[37:45] evidently then now listen
[37:48] evidently god was not satisfied
[37:54] i don't know anywhere else to say but
[37:57] he evidently wasn't satisfied
[38:00] with the way things was in the garden
[38:02] even
[38:06] if it just stayed that away
[38:10] you know if it just stayed right
[38:14] if it just stayed right you would had
[38:16] adam
[38:18] and we'll cover in a minute from
[38:19] blasphemius night adam and eve with
[38:21] eternal life
[38:24] but your prophet says blasphemous names
[38:28] but their body was not eternal
[38:32] so there still had to bend something
[38:36] and now watch
[38:38] that was the natural
[38:40] physical
[38:42] beginning of mankind right
[38:48] come on
[38:49] the natural beginning of mankind
[38:52] was in the garden
[38:56] well was that not called the beginning
[38:57] of the creation of god
[39:03] it was the beginning of
[39:04] the creation of god as mankind wasn't it
[39:07] but it was not what he wanted
[39:12] right
[39:13] he had other attributes remember so they
[39:15] would have to come forth
[39:17] man would have to be lost and need a
[39:20] savior
[39:21] then and only then
[39:24] could he come forth after 4 000 years of
[39:27] building a body
[39:29] by the word of god through those
[39:31] prophets
[39:32] would he be able to come forth with one
[39:34] standing on the earth
[39:37] that would be emmanuel
[39:40] god with us that in him would be the
[39:43] fullness of the godhead bodily
[39:47] and that he would be
[39:48] the beginning
[39:50] of the creation of god
[39:53] what god really wanted
[39:55] in the garden
[39:59] was made possible it's jesus christ
[40:04] and there he was
[40:07] soul and spirit okay eternal
[40:12] but not a body
[40:15] so then the beginning of the creation of
[40:16] god has to do with our body
[40:21] amen
[40:23] remember it had to do with his body
[40:27] but random is what'd he say
[40:30] how did this beginning of the creation
[40:32] of god begin
[40:34] in the wounds of a woman
[40:37] a flesh man
[40:39] now he's talking about something
[40:42] of being flesh man
[40:46] to deal with son of man
[40:48] and it would be the beginning of the
[40:49] creation of god
[40:52] that was the creation he wanted
[40:56] and he knew what he'd have to do
[40:58] so he couldn't come down
[41:00] and just make an eternal body
[41:04] right because he's got to have the
[41:07] savior the healer the redeemer
[41:11] then his body could be made eternal
[41:14] in the resurrection and ascension
[41:16] i put both of those together because
[41:18] of him raising and going up
[41:21] all right
[41:23] see then he's the beginning of the
[41:25] creation of god and the prophet of god
[41:27] said what about us
[41:29] we are the continuation
[41:31] of that creation what creation
[41:37] what was the what was the beginning of
[41:39] the creation of god
[41:43] god
[41:44] in human flesh
[41:51] living upon the earth
[41:54] in a body that he had spoken to
[41:57] existence
[42:00] and was not eternal
[42:05] lived just like you and i in that human
[42:08] body
[42:10] remember that human body wasn't sex born
[42:12] now that's the difference right
[42:15] okay
[42:17] it was a creation because he created the
[42:19] egg in the sperm
[42:22] but a special group of people
[42:30] there would be god in human flesh
[42:34] well no no that's just a little bit too
[42:36] strong
[42:37] why
[42:40] why is it a little too strong
[42:42] because what you've been taught
[42:45] what you've been taught is hindering you
[42:47] me too i'm not saying just you
[42:49] ain't me i'm saying us
[42:51] what's been taught us in our life
[42:56] but until we heard of this prophet
[42:58] we all believed we were going to get a
[43:00] new body
[43:01] we sung songs about it didn't we
[43:06] but then he began to talk about
[43:08] something that we
[43:10] had not considered
[43:14] he began to talk about
[43:16] a body to be made eternal
[43:18] but remember
[43:21] his body
[43:23] was made eternal
[43:25] right
[43:27] now when he stood on earth
[43:31] he was departed he was the physical
[43:33] creation
[43:35] but it was not complete
[43:37] but when he went up and came back to
[43:39] earth
[43:40] he stood here
[43:42] completely
[43:44] the full beginning of the creation of
[43:46] god that he wanted
[43:50] i know brother gary atkis and i used to
[43:52] talk like you ever notice
[43:54] that it's after the resurrection when
[43:56] jesus said
[43:59] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[44:00] in earth
[44:02] you'll notice the scripture
[44:06] we think well it was giving him sure it
[44:08] was
[44:09] but remember he said it
[44:12] when he stood here after the
[44:13] resurrection he said all power
[44:16] is given unto me
[44:18] in heaven and in earth
[44:21] and we're not have to worry about too
[44:22] much should we
[44:24] all right now to get our thought
[44:28] picking back up where we left off
[44:32] so it was on the gabriel's instructions
[44:34] again daniel they don't have to pull
[44:36] them up i'll just paraphrase it a little
[44:38] bit
[44:40] he's talking about
[44:42] how that he had to come and he had to
[44:44] die and all to do
[44:45] and get a title deed
[44:47] break the seals reveal what was in them
[44:50] and give inheritance
[44:53] that belonged to him
[44:57] to the people
[45:01] give the inheritance that belonged to
[45:03] him
[45:04] first off the full word
[45:09] is to give that to the people second
[45:11] part is what eternal life that he
[45:14] inherited by doing that
[45:19] what about
[45:24] that man that we call jesus christ
[45:27] was not eternal
[45:30] but by doing what he done and releasing
[45:33] the life
[45:34] out of him
[45:38] he inherited eternal life in that flesh
[45:42] come on
[45:45] he passed his own life
[45:47] back to his people
[45:50] eternal life that he inherited by doing
[45:53] that
[45:55] what passing his own life back to the
[45:58] people at calvary
[46:01] then he inherited eternal life
[46:04] you remember we went on to this one
[46:06] revelation chapter 5
[46:10] 1961.
[46:13] he said he breaks the seals
[46:15] gives us
[46:17] his inheritance
[46:19] to his people
[46:22] he gives the inheritance that he
[46:24] inherited
[46:28] becoming kinsmen redeemer
[46:30] and freely gives it to
[46:32] us
[46:33] it all belonged to him
[46:35] but he brings it back to us
[46:38] by doing what he done
[46:42] that flesh
[46:44] then inherited eternal life well i
[46:47] understand what you just you make it so
[46:50] confusing and we don't believe this and
[46:52] we believe he wouldn't we we don't
[46:54] believe he's eternal now we believe this
[46:55] is eternal
[46:56] take the stages and follow it
[47:00] while he was on earth his body was not
[47:02] eternal
[47:04] but in the resurrection
[47:06] and ascension
[47:08] his body was made eternal
[47:10] his body is now eternal
[47:13] right all right
[47:15] that's why brother brown says it on the
[47:18] adoption this is where we ended up
[47:20] he said jesus never gave you an
[47:22] inheritance
[47:25] you know you say yes he did he said no
[47:28] he didn't
[47:29] he said he come
[47:31] to he brought you to your inheritance
[47:36] he only come down came down and paid for
[47:39] your inheritance
[47:41] brought you to your inheritance but your
[47:44] name was put on the lounge book of life
[47:46] god gives you your inheritance your
[47:48] inheritance was first
[47:51] your inheritance was
[47:53] where your name was written in about
[47:54] lynn's book of life before the
[47:56] foundation of the world there's your
[47:58] inheritance
[48:01] the other thing that we really need
[48:02] right
[48:04] and to understand it that way
[48:07] to follow what he has done
[48:10] that he released his life
[48:15] the ransom was paid remember we went
[48:18] through that back in the scripture i
[48:19] found the ransom
[48:22] found somebody that could pay the price
[48:25] you remember job somebody that could
[48:26] stand between god and man and bring it
[48:29] together
[48:30] we found the ransom which was the lord
[48:32] jesus christ
[48:36] the soul never died
[48:39] the spirit never died
[48:43] right it left the body
[48:46] it was the body that died
[48:49] even you in your natural even if you're
[48:51] lost
[48:53] and you die
[48:55] your soul and your spirit don't die
[48:59] it goes to some position to wait
[49:02] your body is what dies
[49:04] so you ought to be able to see then what
[49:05] took place at calvary
[49:08] his body died
[49:10] the life went out of it that's why it
[49:12] was dead
[49:15] he didn't made a sacrifice
[49:17] all right
[49:19] because what he was the beginning of the
[49:21] creation of god
[49:24] and by the new birth
[49:27] in our
[49:28] soul we become a part of that creation
[49:35] right
[49:36] eternal life in our soul
[49:38] a part of the creation of god
[49:41] waiting for
[49:43] the plan to be finished
[49:46] for us to come forth
[49:48] to be the rest of the creation
[49:51] all right
[49:52] now
[49:53] we're back right where we started the
[49:55] other day
[49:56] because i don't want to lose this in
[49:58] your mind
[49:59] okay so go ahead pull up number eight
[50:01] now
[50:03] where we've been talking about and
[50:04] you'll see
[50:06] why we use the scripture or done the
[50:08] lord's prayer
[50:13] i use the lord's prayer for the purpose
[50:18] of doing exactly what i want to do now
[50:20] taken from christ is a mystery god
[50:22] revealed
[50:23] paragraph 143
[50:25] but what he wanted to do he loved
[50:28] fatherhood
[50:30] for he was a father
[50:35] and the only way
[50:37] that he could express it
[50:41] was to become
[50:43] a son of man
[50:46] now god was father in that he created
[50:49] adam
[50:51] right
[50:52] he created mankind
[50:55] every time a baby is born he's still
[50:57] creating
[50:59] right
[51:00] a soul for that baby a spirit the
[51:03] body comes from mama and daddy
[51:06] do you still creating
[51:08] that one but that's the old creation
[51:12] that could not be called as paul said
[51:14] the new creation
[51:17] but look at what he's saying
[51:20] what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood
[51:22] or he was a father
[51:24] and the only way that he could express
[51:26] it or bring it out
[51:28] was to become
[51:30] a son of man
[51:36] that's the reason jesus kept saying the
[51:38] son of man they didn't know what he was
[51:40] talking about
[51:42] many of them but now
[51:45] you get it congregation said amen
[51:47] he wanted to express himself
[51:49] that was his one of his great threefold
[51:52] purposes was to express himself identify
[51:55] himself with human beings to reveal
[51:58] himself
[51:59] in christ
[52:01] now what's what i'm talking about
[52:06] adam
[52:08] was the beginning of the human race
[52:13] but that was not the way god wanted
[52:16] it even if he left him in the garden
[52:20] without sin it would not have been the
[52:22] attributes of god fulfilled
[52:26] by coming the way he did
[52:27] he's fulfilling all the attributes
[52:30] then if he's the beginning of the
[52:31] creation of god
[52:33] and we are the continuation of that
[52:35] creation
[52:37] how did we get here
[52:44] i mean we were just here and he just
[52:45] come down
[52:46] no
[52:49] how did we get here
[52:57] what did it then that we would think
[52:59] about him being
[53:01] son of man
[53:05] but remember the scripture we used
[53:08] the son of man
[53:10] is the sower of the seed
[53:15] the son of man sowed the children of the
[53:18] kingdom
[53:20] you want to read that scripture again in
[53:21] matthew
[53:24] the children of the kingdom
[53:27] the devil sowed the tires
[53:30] that's not the children of the king
[53:32] that's to kill children of the wicked
[53:34] one
[53:34] we were all a part of that
[53:37] by our natural creation
[53:40] all
[53:40] right now think about it
[53:44] and truly is our father
[53:51] and when they ask jesus how to pray
[53:57] what did he say
[54:01] pray this away
[54:05] our father
[54:08] who art in heaven
[54:11] hallowed be thy name
[54:15] when mary had the resurrection
[54:21] and the lord jesus standing there
[54:26] he said don't touch me
[54:28] i've not yet ascended
[54:31] but where did he say he is gone
[54:38] i'm going to my father
[54:41] and your father
[54:47] right
[54:48] i'm going to my god
[54:52] and your god
[54:56] because he was not fully
[54:58] gone on into the full translation or
[55:01] what you want to call it the ascension
[55:07] but he said i go to my father
[55:10] and your father
[55:13] no wonder he could say
[55:15] they say teach us how to pray he said
[55:17] pray
[55:18] our father which art in heaven
[55:23] you ever noticed paul never had no
[55:24] trouble when he'd say something he'd say
[55:26] the god and father of our lord jesus
[55:30] christ bless you all god father lord
[55:33] jesus christ oh we've got about six gods
[55:35] running around
[55:40] it's not if the father is the same
[55:44] right
[55:45] so who is our father
[55:50] now if he sowed the children of the
[55:52] kingdom
[55:56] he sowed the word right
[55:59] but then truly the new birth is what
[56:02] the birth of the word
[56:05] that you took in hell
[56:07] and the holy spirit comes upon it and
[56:09] gives you the new birth
[56:12] no wonder we're the children of god no
[56:14] wonder paul in
[56:16] acts 1 19
[56:18] we are his offspring
[56:21] he said you said it and it's right
[56:24] we're his offspring
[56:27] now what about it
[56:35] now fleshly speaking
[56:40] the body jesus had a beginning right
[56:45] it had to be made eternal
[56:49] all right
[56:51] fleshly speaking
[56:53] we received the new birth you know what
[56:55] i'm talking about as we do in our
[56:56] natural
[56:57] we only receive eternal life in the soul
[57:00] not even in the spirit because it
[57:02] doesn't
[57:04] you got to deal with that sucker
[57:06] and that's our problem in that spirit
[57:10] now you never heard brother branham i
[57:13] said this over and over back in the
[57:16] prior messages
[57:19] brother branham said there was a seed
[57:22] sowed
[57:23] for every age
[57:28] and he said there was a people
[57:30] to make that word
[57:33] alive
[57:35] in that age
[57:39] come on read your bible then
[57:42] the son of man is the sower of the seed
[57:45] and what did he sow he sowed the
[57:46] children of the kingdom
[57:49] the word
[57:51] then when you receive the eternal life
[57:54] you know when you receive the the new
[57:56] birth
[57:57] it makes that word alive
[58:00] in you
[58:02] right
[58:04] that's eternal life
[58:08] then why would we worry
[58:10] and get so confusing
[58:12] into our mind
[58:15] that brother brandon would make some
[58:16] statements
[58:19] we've had these for about three weeks
[58:21] now i'm gonna finally get to read them
[58:22] today go ahead to number nine brother
[58:25] which is taken from the message
[58:26] expectation
[58:28] 1956.
[58:32] do you realize that
[58:34] that the very earth that you're sitting
[58:36] over tonight
[58:37] is nothing more than the word of god
[58:40] did you know god made the world
[58:43] out of his spoken word
[58:47] that enough
[58:48] roll it up he made the earth sitting
[58:51] over everything
[58:52] he made the chair that you're sitting in
[58:55] he's his spoken word
[58:57] brought the material into the earth
[59:00] right are you following with me
[59:02] he spoke it into existence
[59:06] now watch
[59:08] he spoke you
[59:10] into existence
[59:14] he spoke me
[59:16] into existence
[59:18] he said when you think of that he said
[59:20] there were doubters
[59:23] poke you into existence
[59:27] you're not talking about a human element
[59:29] like adam
[59:32] that part sinned
[59:35] he's talking about a new creation
[59:38] a new race of people
[59:42] and he was the beginning of
[59:44] that race of people
[59:46] and we as born again believers are the
[59:49] rest of that
[59:51] family
[59:53] all right go on to the next one law
[59:55] having a shadow
[59:57] pull on up i'm just getting the word to
[59:59] you
[1:00:00] as long as god accepted christ
[1:00:04] he accepted you with christ
[1:00:07] and when did he do it
[1:00:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:00:11] that right
[1:00:12] when he spoke it into existence
[1:00:17] he spoke
[1:00:18] you
[1:00:20] redeemed
[1:00:22] with him
[1:00:26] when he was redeemed you was redeemed
[1:00:31] because your name was put on the lounge
[1:00:32] book of life
[1:00:33] for the foundation of the world
[1:00:35] why don't we believe it
[1:00:40] why would it be such a problem to think
[1:00:42] about as coming away to the next one
[1:00:44] which is a message called the junction
[1:00:46] of time
[1:00:52] he's talking about according to another
[1:00:54] verse and all heavenly father we're not
[1:00:56] much to begin with lord
[1:00:59] we just come here
[1:01:02] because you spoke us
[1:01:06] into existence
[1:01:12] you just come because
[1:01:14] you spoke us into existence
[1:01:18] you fed us keep us
[1:01:22] he's focused
[1:01:24] into existence
[1:01:26] what about it
[1:01:28] number 12 the identified masterpiece
[1:01:32] coming down to the lounge book of life
[1:01:33] for the foundation world
[1:01:35] now that god had us in his thinking then
[1:01:38] we have eternal life
[1:01:41] because then he spoke us
[1:01:47] we were his children
[1:01:49] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:51] and we're certainly not talking about
[1:01:53] what you're looking at
[1:01:55] i'm not talking about what i'm looking
[1:01:57] at
[1:01:58] right
[1:02:02] it's the word
[1:02:04] the children of god
[1:02:06] are the word because our father now
[1:02:08] watch
[1:02:11] his father and our father is the same
[1:02:17] in flesh
[1:02:19] brother brown said
[1:02:20] jesus had a father and a mother
[1:02:26] huh
[1:02:30] now you'll see why that i've said that
[1:02:32] so much to you and just leaving it alone
[1:02:35] we know his father wasn't joseph
[1:02:38] we got no sense no better than
[1:02:40] we know his mother wasn't mary
[1:02:45] his father was almighty god hebrews 10 5
[1:02:49] a body thou hast prepared me i'll give
[1:02:51] you the quote where brother brown said a
[1:02:52] body said the father provided
[1:02:58] who was his father almighty god
[1:03:02] who is his mother the word
[1:03:05] not a woman the word
[1:03:10] who is your father
[1:03:12] if you have the new birth
[1:03:17] are you going to make jesus lying when
[1:03:18] he said i go to my father and your
[1:03:21] father
[1:03:24] to my god and your god
[1:03:27] see when he gave you the new birth
[1:03:30] there's your father
[1:03:33] your mother is the word
[1:03:39] that we're following on to meet him with
[1:03:42] the word
[1:03:47] we have
[1:03:49] eternal life
[1:03:52] because then he spoke us
[1:03:54] and we come in
[1:03:57] to existence
[1:04:02] he spoke us
[1:04:03] and we came into existence
[1:04:06] that's why i asked a question and i know
[1:04:08] i get
[1:04:09] offend people
[1:04:11] i asked a question here at the church
[1:04:13] about 20 years ago one day and at that
[1:04:16] time a lot maybe a little more than 20.
[1:04:18] a lot was being preached about son of
[1:04:20] man about the country
[1:04:22] and i asked a simple question
[1:04:26] i said you say you understand son of man
[1:04:28] i said do you even understand son of god
[1:04:34] it offends some of you it's it's
[1:04:35] especially some of the others
[1:04:38] for what i said i said when is the first
[1:04:41] time in the bible that the son of god
[1:04:43] came into being
[1:04:46] not one person stood up and said
[1:04:49] anything so i went ahead and said it i
[1:04:51] said because every one of you are
[1:04:53] thinking son of god was two thousand
[1:04:55] years ago on the shores of galilee
[1:05:00] i said no
[1:05:02] but around said the son of god was the
[1:05:04] logos that came out of god in the
[1:05:06] beginning before the foundation of the
[1:05:08] world the son of god is what created the
[1:05:10] world
[1:05:13] see we think oh yeah we understand i
[1:05:15] said there's no need to talk about son
[1:05:16] of man
[1:05:18] until we get son of god out of the way
[1:05:22] and for 20 something years we've been on
[1:05:24] that
[1:05:26] all right
[1:05:29] listen
[1:05:31] let's go back to that beginning now
[1:05:34] just for a minute and we won't take too
[1:05:35] long
[1:05:37] because i'll drop off and preach some
[1:05:38] more later on
[1:05:42] what did man fall from in the garden
[1:05:49] we'll read it but rome said he fell from
[1:05:51] eternal life
[1:05:57] now i ask you a simple question
[1:06:00] how can you fall from eternal life
[1:06:04] i don't care what dispensation
[1:06:06] the great brother in this message he
[1:06:07] said well that was back there in the old
[1:06:09] testament and maybe it could be there i
[1:06:11] said
[1:06:13] no way
[1:06:16] you can't fall from eternal life
[1:06:19] god is not an indian giver
[1:06:21] he doesn't give you something and take
[1:06:24] it away
[1:06:27] he can take you off the scene like he
[1:06:29] did the man in the hebrew book because
[1:06:31] he wouldn't line up with god
[1:06:33] and got off the word
[1:06:34] he took him off the scene
[1:06:36] he said he wouldn't let his child mar
[1:06:38] his name
[1:06:46] what happened to adam and eve in the
[1:06:48] garden
[1:06:53] what happened in that original fall
[1:07:04] did they just fall in soul
[1:07:11] or did they fall in body spirit
[1:07:13] and soul
[1:07:20] which one was it
[1:07:22] see then you'll see why he's our father
[1:07:27] the son of man
[1:07:30] is our father
[1:07:32] the only way the son of man could be
[1:07:33] father
[1:07:34] the way it could be father was to be the
[1:07:36] son of man which would speak the word
[1:07:39] into existence
[1:07:46] remember he spoke before the world but
[1:07:49] remember that's got to come down here
[1:07:52] and be spoke down here someway
[1:07:55] so then before the foundation of the
[1:07:57] world god in his mind
[1:08:00] saw what would take place
[1:08:02] are we right
[1:08:04] then one day jesus stood on the earth
[1:08:07] and spoke
[1:08:09] this new creation of people
[1:08:12] into existence
[1:08:14] the son of man is the sower the seed
[1:08:18] he said the good seed are the children
[1:08:20] of the kingdom he had to speak them into
[1:08:22] existence
[1:08:25] well he didn't speak me but he spoke
[1:08:28] eternal life
[1:08:30] into existence
[1:08:32] he spoke the
[1:08:36] word they would come down and be all the
[1:08:39] way
[1:08:42] see then the key is to understand what
[1:08:44] happened in the garden
[1:08:50] but we know all about it it was a sex
[1:08:52] act we we got it all figured out now we
[1:08:54] got the beast
[1:08:56] and all these things we know all about
[1:08:58] it
[1:09:10] can you fall from eternal life
[1:09:14] can god take eternal life away from
[1:09:16] anyone
[1:09:19] now if you got that settled then we can
[1:09:21] move on if you ain't we might as well go
[1:09:24] home
[1:09:28] if you ain't got that settled
[1:09:29] there's no need to continue the rest of
[1:09:31] the service
[1:09:32] if you ain't got it settled that god
[1:09:34] can't
[1:09:35] give you eternal life and take it back
[1:09:43] i'm not going to do anything he wants to
[1:09:44] this is what i mean see you might we'll
[1:09:46] go home
[1:09:51] but if you can see that god cannot take
[1:09:54] it back
[1:09:55] so there must be something
[1:09:58] that we've got to see
[1:10:00] in the way that it's worded
[1:10:02] and the things of what happened in the
[1:10:04] garden
[1:10:06] i've been on this 40 years so don't be
[1:10:08] concerned
[1:10:09] these very quotes
[1:10:11] quoting it for 40 years
[1:10:14] go ahead to number 13.
[1:10:21] this is taken from the breach
[1:10:24] paragraph 90.
[1:10:27] and when a person is struck with
[1:10:29] diseases aches and pains
[1:10:31] one time there wasn't that way but they
[1:10:33] were groaning why they're not right
[1:10:35] there's something wrong
[1:10:37] they're groaning and trying to get back
[1:10:38] to where they was when they had health
[1:10:42] and when nature had people
[1:10:45] and when nature and people
[1:10:47] as the bible said are groaning it shows
[1:10:50] there's something
[1:10:51] that they're not in their ought to be
[1:10:53] conditioned
[1:10:55] they are fallen from
[1:10:57] somewhere
[1:10:59] amen
[1:11:00] where'd we fall from
[1:11:03] okay
[1:11:04] go ahead that's paragraph 90.
[1:11:07] this is paragraph 91.
[1:11:10] now we don't need anybody to interpret
[1:11:11] that for us
[1:11:13] see of course we know it was eternal
[1:11:15] life
[1:11:17] they had fallen from
[1:11:20] brother dale
[1:11:21] you are correcting brother branham
[1:11:29] that's why i said we might as well go
[1:11:30] home
[1:11:34] you're correcting brother branham
[1:11:35] because you just said brother brown said
[1:11:37] or you just said it there's no way that
[1:11:39] you could lose eternal life
[1:11:42] brother others said they fell for
[1:11:43] eternal life
[1:11:51] you want to go home
[1:11:52] or you want to continue
[1:11:56] i get a few continues but a lot of you
[1:11:58] just looking like we need to go home
[1:12:03] okay
[1:12:05] now watch
[1:12:08] we know it was eternal life they had
[1:12:10] fallen from
[1:12:12] and they lost their claims
[1:12:14] on eternal life
[1:12:17] by the fall of adam and eve
[1:12:19] who fell from eternal life
[1:12:22] to death in the garden of eden and
[1:12:24] brought all nature unto them
[1:12:27] to death
[1:12:31] now
[1:12:35] does that make it then that god can give
[1:12:37] you eternal life and then take it away
[1:12:40] or what happened in the garden
[1:12:45] he said a tree never died before adam
[1:12:48] an animal wouldn't die before adam
[1:12:50] there's only one thing that cannot die
[1:12:52] and that's god because he's eternal
[1:12:55] yeah
[1:12:56] sold out our birthright
[1:12:59] and crossed the chasm
[1:13:01] now we're beyond the reach of god on
[1:13:02] this other side
[1:13:05] adam fell to death
[1:13:07] he brought death upon all creation
[1:13:10] now he was given free moral agency and
[1:13:12] it was given to him you know to make a
[1:13:14] choice
[1:13:15] see
[1:13:17] so now what do you think
[1:13:21] i'm going to say what the prophet said
[1:13:23] he said we fell from eternal life
[1:13:28] okay
[1:13:31] that's your choice
[1:13:35] but then you got god taken away so you
[1:13:37] got the possibility
[1:13:45] are you listening
[1:13:48] then that puts you in the category
[1:13:51] with the possibility if that's the way
[1:13:53] you're thinking
[1:13:56] that you can get eternal life today
[1:13:58] and lose it tomorrow
[1:14:03] that's the possibility you've just laid
[1:14:05] out
[1:14:06] if that's what you believe
[1:14:10] what are you correcting right around he
[1:14:12] don't need to be corrected
[1:14:13] he does his own correcting
[1:14:16] he said it the way he wanted to say it
[1:14:18] where it would hide it from the wise and
[1:14:20] prudent
[1:14:22] but would reveal it
[1:14:24] to the babes
[1:14:26] they're in christ
[1:14:29] okay
[1:14:31] we'd reveal it to the babes in christ
[1:14:34] adam fell
[1:14:36] to death
[1:14:40] in the garden
[1:14:43] while we're reading it let's just see
[1:14:45] some things that he lost
[1:14:48] then we'll get back to our point go
[1:14:50] ahead to number 14.
[1:14:54] he talked about adam's sin by eating his
[1:14:56] wife's
[1:14:57] you know then produced the product to
[1:14:58] adam and had him turning loose the word
[1:15:00] sold out he lost also his inheritance
[1:15:04] when he lost his fellowship
[1:15:06] and right to life
[1:15:09] remember the day you eat the other day
[1:15:11] you die
[1:15:12] and when he lost his life he also lost
[1:15:15] his inheritance in life
[1:15:18] because he had completely supreme
[1:15:20] control of the earth
[1:15:22] he was a god of the earth
[1:15:25] god's the god of the universe
[1:15:26] everybody's son had this earth under his
[1:15:29] own control he could speak he could name
[1:15:31] he could say he could stop nature he
[1:15:33] could do anything he wanted to
[1:15:35] but when he did that he lost his
[1:15:36] inheritance coming on down to what he is
[1:15:39] who was he was a minor god under god our
[1:15:42] father because he was the son of god
[1:15:45] okay but now look
[1:15:47] we could stop here for a minute and get
[1:15:48] a real sermon
[1:15:52] and then if the blood was cl has cleaned
[1:15:54] it back
[1:15:57] what about now
[1:15:59] look what the son of god the second adam
[1:16:02] did
[1:16:03] he said the word
[1:16:04] works i do
[1:16:05] so you do also
[1:16:07] see adam lost his inheritance
[1:16:10] the earth
[1:16:13] that was his inheritance
[1:16:15] he passed his hand to the one
[1:16:18] he sold out to what did
[1:16:23] if adam lost eternal life did he sell
[1:16:26] out and go to hell
[1:16:31] oh
[1:16:33] you're asking some questions
[1:16:36] that i'm not capable of answering
[1:16:39] thank you
[1:16:41] 40 years of studying it
[1:16:47] he sold out to satan he sold his faith
[1:16:50] in god to satan's reason therefore his
[1:16:52] eternal life
[1:16:54] is right to the tree of life
[1:16:59] his right to the earth belonged to him
[1:17:02] and he forfeited every bit to the hands
[1:17:05] of satan he passed it from his hand to
[1:17:07] satan
[1:17:09] the seed of abraham has
[1:17:11] destroyed the inheritance
[1:17:13] that adam should have had that's the
[1:17:16] earth
[1:17:18] why would there be so much connection to
[1:17:20] the earth
[1:17:25] why is there so much in relation to the
[1:17:27] earth
[1:17:32] why is it
[1:17:36] the important dispensation is the son of
[1:17:38] man
[1:17:40] the son of man's god of the earth
[1:17:46] right
[1:17:47] remember the quotes we gave
[1:17:49] so the man's god of the earth
[1:17:52] here he was that
[1:17:56] okay
[1:17:59] is it possible to
[1:18:02] get eternal life and lose it
[1:18:06] that's what i said
[1:18:09] if you say that
[1:18:10] you can have eternal life and lose it
[1:18:12] then you put yourself in the possibility
[1:18:15] that you'll never know
[1:18:17] who you really are and what you're doing
[1:18:19] because you'll never have the right
[1:18:21] you'll be listen you'll be just like the
[1:18:24] denominations
[1:18:28] you would never come through the baptist
[1:18:30] so you wouldn't know it but in the
[1:18:32] baptist they preached you one sermon one
[1:18:34] sunday the glory hallelujah you're
[1:18:36] sealed in everything's done you got
[1:18:38] eternal life then the next sunday they'd
[1:18:40] preach
[1:18:43] on that one no none good no not one and
[1:18:46] they'd send you to hell even though you
[1:18:48] claimed eternal life for 40 years
[1:18:52] now we say oh no
[1:18:55] am is any methodist in here
[1:18:58] i don't see any hands but
[1:19:00] you know what the methodists believe
[1:19:06] methodists believe that if you're living
[1:19:08] right when you die you're going to
[1:19:10] heaven
[1:19:12] if you're living wrong
[1:19:13] you've lost your sanctification
[1:19:15] that's identically the methodist
[1:19:17] doctrine
[1:19:20] that if you're living right
[1:19:23] when you die you're going
[1:19:26] is that what you think
[1:19:32] well i want to be living right that last
[1:19:34] day i want to live right every day
[1:19:37] don't you
[1:19:41] what about it
[1:19:42] but brother dale brother branham said
[1:19:45] adam fell from eternal life to death
[1:19:51] okay
[1:19:52] let's go to a little message go under
[1:19:55] number 15.
[1:19:57] call blasphemous names
[1:20:02] they say wrote it on up you can get all
[1:20:04] of it read all of it or not give it to
[1:20:06] you or you know the whole thing
[1:20:08] it ain't me just giving you parts
[1:20:11] look
[1:20:15] but what god
[1:20:16] did he breathed the breath of eternal
[1:20:19] life
[1:20:21] amen
[1:20:23] then he become a living soul
[1:20:30] erase that
[1:20:36] what did he say
[1:20:39] you want to read that with me
[1:20:41] a soul
[1:20:43] that can't die right
[1:20:46] so now something happened in adam right
[1:20:49] that we need to understand amen
[1:20:54] and why would brother branham say it he
[1:20:56] fell from eternal life
[1:20:58] to death
[1:21:01] and he says
[1:21:04] the soul can't die
[1:21:07] well he was wrong here and he's right
[1:21:09] over here well okay which one's right
[1:21:11] which one's wrong
[1:21:12] see now you've got yourself in the the
[1:21:14] devil's traps
[1:21:16] because you'll pity pattern through the
[1:21:17] whole message that way
[1:21:20] and you'll never house
[1:21:22] faith
[1:21:23] to be anchored
[1:21:30] see because most people never thought
[1:21:32] about
[1:21:33] that adam had eternal life
[1:21:39] right
[1:21:41] how many people in the message you ever
[1:21:43] heard preach much about much about adam
[1:21:46] with eternal life
[1:21:52] i've been around a long time
[1:21:55] i'm just telling you as far as i can say
[1:21:58] i've never heard no one preach
[1:22:01] that adam had eternal life in his soul
[1:22:06] maybe you have
[1:22:08] i hope you have i'm just telling you
[1:22:12] you don't like it
[1:22:14] well lump it whatever you want to do
[1:22:16] with it
[1:22:17] i don't have no arguments
[1:22:20] my soul is involved in this
[1:22:23] as well as yours
[1:22:28] he's talking about adam
[1:22:31] he breathed the breath of eternal life
[1:22:33] into adam
[1:22:34] then he become a living soul soul that
[1:22:36] can't die now watch we're going to get
[1:22:38] into honey plum up their elbows
[1:22:40] breathe the breath of eternal life
[1:22:42] into his nostrils
[1:22:44] and he became an eternal soul
[1:22:47] who's he talking about adam right
[1:22:51] because god breathed now watch
[1:22:54] not what nature done
[1:22:57] and why would your prophet say that
[1:23:03] we know that every baby that's borne
[1:23:05] into the world
[1:23:07] god has to give that baby life right
[1:23:10] but in the ba in the form of what we're
[1:23:12] doing without talking about eternal life
[1:23:14] that's what nature
[1:23:16] does
[1:23:18] do you understand we say nature done
[1:23:20] this
[1:23:22] nature gave
[1:23:24] life to mankind
[1:23:26] which was god himself doing it the
[1:23:28] animals have life
[1:23:32] that nature gives them
[1:23:36] so what's he saying
[1:23:40] god breathed now what nature done
[1:23:42] what god did god breathed the breath of
[1:23:44] life into his nostrils and he become a
[1:23:45] living soul
[1:23:47] you say to me adam died brother branham
[1:23:51] but remember
[1:23:53] before adam died
[1:23:54] he had a lamb
[1:23:56] that redeemed him
[1:23:58] okay watch it hallelujah those who
[1:24:00] before knew he's called he got allowed
[1:24:02] to redeem them he was the type adam fell
[1:24:05] then the lamb was provided for adam
[1:24:07] because already
[1:24:09] in the nostrils of
[1:24:12] his nostrils had become the breath
[1:24:15] of eternity eternal god
[1:24:18] and he become a living soul
[1:24:21] he was the son of god
[1:24:24] all right
[1:24:25] i'm going to pull it back down just a
[1:24:27] little bit
[1:24:28] is that right which one are we on
[1:24:31] 188 supposed to be
[1:24:34] there you go you're the son of god
[1:24:37] not his breath as the african word of
[1:24:39] more you know animal breeds are more
[1:24:41] your sinners breath ammonia
[1:24:43] then why would he struggle
[1:24:45] if it's just what you believe breathe is
[1:24:47] eternal life no that's not what it is he
[1:24:49] said it back forth
[1:24:50] but god especially
[1:24:54] upon adam
[1:24:56] breathe the breath
[1:24:58] of eternal life
[1:25:01] and he became become
[1:25:03] an eternal person
[1:25:06] with god
[1:25:07] he had a power like god he was an
[1:25:09] amateur god he was god of the earth he's
[1:25:11] got a day of it now what did he say
[1:25:12] someday the sons of god
[1:25:15] will again be gods
[1:25:21] so
[1:25:24] adam had eternal life right
[1:25:34] god breathed into his nostrils
[1:25:37] and he became
[1:25:39] the eternal life go ahead all we want is
[1:25:41] a little piece of this one go to the
[1:25:43] next one we want it's the top part so
[1:25:45] hold the rest of it
[1:25:46] the church is a mythical body because
[1:25:48] this is paragraph 2 32 of christ born to
[1:25:50] the breath of god well you get it
[1:25:52] congregation the church of god is born
[1:25:54] to the breath of god god breathed into
[1:25:56] the nostril spiritual of adam and you
[1:25:58] become a living soul did you know the
[1:26:00] pentecostal proof pentecostal church is
[1:26:03] born to the breath of god
[1:26:08] what happened then in the garden
[1:26:14] you've got mass confusion just laid out
[1:26:17] in front of
[1:26:20] you one saying
[1:26:24] you could lose eternal life
[1:26:28] another saying you can't lose eternal
[1:26:30] life
[1:26:33] and all of it's saying that adam had
[1:26:36] eternal life in his soul
[1:26:42] to what did adam fall from
[1:26:51] well he he just fell from eternal life
[1:26:53] well then he's lost
[1:26:55] right
[1:26:58] and before i go too far
[1:27:00] i want to make a blunt statement to you
[1:27:03] that you'll probably
[1:27:04] deny
[1:27:05] if adam had eternal life in his soul
[1:27:09] then you tell me eve didn't have eternal
[1:27:11] life
[1:27:12] we're going to go a long ways if you
[1:27:14] tell me that one
[1:27:15] because remember
[1:27:17] adam and eve
[1:27:19] had the same theophany
[1:27:22] that's what your prophet said
[1:27:28] oh i'm just going to say the way that i
[1:27:29] believe it always
[1:27:30] adam had eternal life in his soul eve
[1:27:33] had eternal life in her soul
[1:27:37] yeah but how could they fall
[1:27:40] i wish you wouldn't ask that one
[1:27:43] do you ever do wrong
[1:27:48] do you ever do wrong
[1:27:53] all right
[1:27:55] if you ever do wrong
[1:27:58] it's got to be something else doing it
[1:28:00] beside the soul
[1:28:01] we'll go there because that's the truth
[1:28:03] right
[1:28:05] so eve in the garden had the body and
[1:28:07] the spirit to deal with
[1:28:12] he just had eternal life in her soul
[1:28:15] she had her body and their spirit to
[1:28:16] deal with in the garden
[1:28:18] that was not eternal
[1:28:22] come on
[1:28:24] you would only eternal inner soul
[1:28:27] adam was only eternal in his soul
[1:28:30] come on adam had a body and a spirit
[1:28:34] the body and the spirit is what the fall
[1:28:36] fell in
[1:28:40] right
[1:28:41] you're a christian a born-again
[1:28:42] christian yet you have a wrong thought
[1:28:48] if you do wrong
[1:28:52] what is part of you that does the wrong
[1:28:57] that's to be the spirit working through
[1:28:58] the body
[1:29:00] can't be the soul if you're born again
[1:29:04] his seed remaineth in him and he cannot
[1:29:08] sin amen
[1:29:11] okay
[1:29:17] what happened
[1:29:21] adam
[1:29:22] standing in the garden with eternal life
[1:29:24] in his soul
[1:29:27] his body had a beginning
[1:29:30] his spirit had a beginning
[1:29:34] they were not eternal
[1:29:39] so what did adam lose
[1:29:41] he lost the right to the tree of life we
[1:29:44] read it
[1:29:45] what was the tree of life in the garden
[1:29:47] for
[1:29:50] now here's let me quote brother branham
[1:29:52] because you have to take this
[1:29:53] he said the tree of life was in the
[1:29:54] garden to remind adam and eve that their
[1:29:56] youth was being renewed
[1:29:58] now that's that's that's a direct
[1:30:00] statement it was being renewed
[1:30:03] adam's life was being renewed it wasn't
[1:30:05] eternal
[1:30:06] it couldn't be eternal because nothing
[1:30:08] had happened
[1:30:11] adam fell
[1:30:13] from the point of coming to eternal life
[1:30:17] in his
[1:30:18] body so he fell from eternal life
[1:30:24] so your prophet is right
[1:30:28] he fell from
[1:30:30] the fact that his body was never made
[1:30:32] eternal
[1:30:34] so he fell from eternal life away from
[1:30:37] it it was dire which was a tree of life
[1:30:39] but he couldn't do like i've always said
[1:30:41] what don't you never think about what
[1:30:43] would have happened had there not been
[1:30:44] no sin
[1:30:48] hypothetical but what what would have
[1:30:49] happened had there been no sin
[1:30:53] we ain't going to get in those sex acts
[1:30:54] no stuff like that because that's the
[1:30:56] wrong thing
[1:30:58] but you see adam and eve would have
[1:31:00] brought us here
[1:31:04] don't get into the wrong thing on that
[1:31:07] because you can prove one way and you
[1:31:08] prove the other way just say it like it
[1:31:10] is adam and eve would have brought us
[1:31:12] here
[1:31:15] if it was just speaking the word amen
[1:31:19] but it wasn't going to happen
[1:31:22] when i said hypothetical
[1:31:25] it wasn't going to happen
[1:31:27] so they would just forget it but the
[1:31:30] point is
[1:31:31] what if it would have happened
[1:31:32] that we could have all come by spoken
[1:31:34] word from adam and eve
[1:31:38] we still would have had a body and a
[1:31:39] spirit that was not eternal
[1:31:42] because mama and daddy would have been
[1:31:45] that
[1:31:48] the tree of life was there for us to go
[1:31:50] to and partake of
[1:31:52] but when sin entered the picture what
[1:31:54] was told them let's put them forth from
[1:31:57] the tree of life listen to your bible
[1:32:00] because we don't said they'll take of
[1:32:02] the tree of life
[1:32:03] and live forever
[1:32:07] because you couldn't live eternal
[1:32:10] that'd be an eternal sinner
[1:32:13] come on your bible's right don't do that
[1:32:15] read your bible
[1:32:17] put them forward from the tree of life
[1:32:18] let it be taken and live forever it
[1:32:21] didn't say and live eternally
[1:32:24] because it'll be impossible
[1:32:26] you'd have an eternal sinner
[1:32:29] so what happened to adam and eve
[1:32:34] they never attained
[1:32:36] to an eternal body
[1:32:39] they lost the right in their claims to
[1:32:43] an eternal body
[1:32:45] to satan
[1:32:46] and he took it over
[1:32:48] he took this world
[1:32:51] and the products from this world to a
[1:32:53] positional situation
[1:32:56] that something's got to happen one day
[1:32:59] before it can be eternal
[1:33:03] whether you know it or not i'm preaching
[1:33:04] about what the change really is
[1:33:08] you just ought to listen
[1:33:10] you see what i'm talking about
[1:33:12] blasphemous names tells you adam and
[1:33:14] eternal life
[1:33:18] the breach the seals city fell from
[1:33:20] eternal life to death
[1:33:23] now he didn't lose eternal life in his
[1:33:25] soul
[1:33:29] you can't do that now
[1:33:31] if you do then you've destroyed your
[1:33:32] whole bible
[1:33:34] and all your prophets try to teach all
[1:33:36] this time
[1:33:36] so put it like it is
[1:33:39] adam never reached eternal life in his
[1:33:42] body
[1:33:43] it was there in front of him which was a
[1:33:45] tree of life
[1:33:46] but he fell from it
[1:33:48] to sin
[1:33:51] satan came on the scene
[1:33:53] and remember the quote we were given out
[1:33:54] of daniel 70 weeks what is the son of
[1:33:57] man got to do with the son of man
[1:34:00] was ruler of the earth
[1:34:06] a certain man is ruler of the earth
[1:34:09] amen it's more than just talk about
[1:34:12] a prophet
[1:34:14] he's a savior healer redeemer father son
[1:34:17] holy ghost he's all in all and jesus is
[1:34:20] his name come on brothers
[1:34:27] my father
[1:34:29] was sam dale in the natural
[1:34:33] they say out of 13 i'm the only one that
[1:34:35] looks like him
[1:34:36] well i guess he saved the best of life
[1:34:38] that was 13. i'm glad he did i'm glad
[1:34:41] they never believed in birth control
[1:34:43] you ought to get my mama to tell you get
[1:34:45] the kids to tell you what my mother said
[1:34:47] the reason they had 13.
[1:34:49] i won't use that in the pulpit
[1:34:53] you know
[1:34:55] i'm glad
[1:34:58] they didn't believe in birth control
[1:35:01] i wouldn't have got here
[1:35:03] but they said out and this is honest
[1:35:04] they tell me that out of all of them i'm
[1:35:07] the only one that favors my daddy
[1:35:12] well
[1:35:14] i hope i'm the only one
[1:35:17] that favors my heavenly father
[1:35:20] but i want everybody else to come to be
[1:35:22] part of that
[1:35:24] because he's your father and my father
[1:35:26] he's your god and my god
[1:35:29] eternal life
[1:35:32] do you understand i know it's hard
[1:35:34] people out there are wondering what in
[1:35:35] the world they're saying but one time
[1:35:36] you got eternal aspect you lost you turn
[1:35:38] around and then you come back and you
[1:35:39] turn around get ready you just flip flop
[1:35:40] backwards and forth go back and listen
[1:35:46] adam never achieved
[1:35:48] the position of eternal life
[1:35:51] in his body
[1:35:53] so he fell from it
[1:35:55] and he died
[1:35:57] but he never lost the eternal life into
[1:36:00] his soul
[1:36:06] and all we're trying to do is come back
[1:36:08] to that same eternal life
[1:36:11] not just in soul
[1:36:13] but in our bodies
[1:36:16] i've said it
[1:36:17] but it's this morning or the beginning
[1:36:18] of this today
[1:36:20] you need to remember
[1:36:22] i ask you to read matthew mark luke and
[1:36:24] john
[1:36:25] remember in the gospels
[1:36:28] it speaks of the son of man
[1:36:32] it's the sign of the resurrection
[1:36:38] little man was in the heart of the earth
[1:36:40] three days a tree now
[1:36:42] about jonah you know
[1:36:44] but yet we argued how many hours that
[1:36:46] was and never thought about it here
[1:36:48] comes a prophet
[1:36:49] and he said here's this i said that's
[1:36:51] not speaking of this times and days and
[1:36:53] speaking of the resurrection
[1:36:56] the son of man
[1:36:58] the messiah
[1:37:00] is the resurrection
[1:37:03] i thought that was what we were looking
[1:37:05] for
[1:37:06] was a resurrection
[1:37:08] and then we were alive and remain shall
[1:37:10] be changed
[1:37:14] and remember
[1:37:16] your resurrection
[1:37:18] lays inside of you
[1:37:24] because inside of you is eternal life
[1:37:28] jesus said i am
[1:37:30] the resurrection and the life
[1:37:35] what about it what do we got let's stand
[1:37:38] i was going to end it a little quicker
[1:37:40] we was listening last night to brother
[1:37:41] around talking about he said here i am
[1:37:43] said made all these rules and said you
[1:37:44] ought to preach 35 40 minutes he said i
[1:37:47] had to because he had an excuse
[1:37:50] he did
[1:37:51] he said he was trying to preach the
[1:37:52] message to get it out
[1:37:54] and he even announced in that one he
[1:37:56] said you'll see the difference he said
[1:37:58] because they're in 63 on church order he
[1:38:01] said in other words paraphrasing what he
[1:38:03] said he said i'm gonna have to start
[1:38:04] preaching more out there
[1:38:07] he said that i said i wouldn't preach
[1:38:08] out there see he was running out of time
[1:38:13] then you'll see him as he
[1:38:15] from 63 on true
[1:38:17] he starts out in the world preaching
[1:38:21] major doctrines
[1:38:25] rapture wasn't preached at the
[1:38:26] tabernacle
[1:38:30] look at all those things that wouldn't
[1:38:31] preach at the tabernacle he began to lay
[1:38:33] it down because he's running out of time
[1:38:36] i don't have that problem because but i
[1:38:39] have had 40 or 50 years to preach about
[1:38:42] it eternal life is not a play party to
[1:38:45] me
[1:38:47] it's a person
[1:38:48] it is the person of jesus christ
[1:38:54] i want this body to be made eternal
[1:38:56] don't you go ahead
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:09] those precious
[1:39:18] remember you can't lose eternal life
[1:39:20] for
[1:39:21] all
[1:39:22] my sins so your prophet's got to be
[1:39:25] saying something
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:35] but what he said hid it from the eyes of
[1:39:37] the wise and prudent
[1:39:39] just blood stains
[1:39:43] i
[1:39:44] have a source
[1:39:47] what about
[1:39:48] [Music]
