[2:16] Cru going to Yep they're going
[2:20] to S the Caribbean so good to good to be
[2:24] able to do that
[2:28] so
[2:32] all right let's just let's just we're
[2:33] going to
[2:34] uh um just go over what we have
[2:38] previously caught on the four
[2:41] seal and then to uh not now next Sunday
[2:45] um Bob come to next
[2:49] Sunday I kind of forgot I was going to
[2:51] let y'all do them in between but uh you
[2:53] got you got it next Sunday brother Ernie
[2:54] will be here so we'll all be under
[2:58] anticipation of that so you do Sunday
[3:00] school and then the next time we have it
[3:02] we're going to start on the fifth seal
[3:05] so now we've
[3:06] got one 2 three and four right yeah all
[3:12] right we got to the four still and and
[3:15] obviously there's five six and seven but
[3:18] as we've shown
[3:21] before we can break this
[3:24] down into parts and it and you can
[3:27] understand it a lot better right okay
[3:30] cuz if you go see you can go here you
[3:33] look justification sanctification the
[3:35] Holy Ghost and then the word the word at
[3:39] its
[3:42] Capstone Revelation all the way up but
[3:44] that for
[3:47] seal look it took a prophet and tell us
[3:49] that there's nowhere in that for seal
[3:51] that tells us there's going to be a
[3:52] Rapture
[3:55] nowhere right it doesn't plainly say and
[3:57] after the fourth seal the Rapture is
[3:59] going to take the Gentile bride up no
[4:01] but when the prophet and look how simple
[4:04] it is though he's on the fourth seal
[4:06] well he gets to the fifth seal and the
[4:09] angel says well where's the combat
[4:11] be in other words I'm just saying that's
[4:14] what happened because brother BR didn't
[4:15] know it right he didn't know what the
[4:18] fifth seal was he said he
[4:19] did because I don't think that the angel
[4:22] that brought him the revelation of those
[4:24] seal or brought him the the word for the
[4:28] seal he couldn't reveal it to him cuz it
[4:31] was an angel Jesus Christ had to reveal
[4:33] it to him through his new birth so the
[4:35] angel couldn't say now the Rapture is
[4:37] going to take place on the four seal the
[4:39] prophet would say well how you know
[4:42] that in other words all he'd have to do
[4:44] is say look in the fifth seal and do you
[4:47] see any combat Beast now you being a
[4:49] prophet you know that combat Beast is
[4:51] what the Holy Ghost in The Believer
[4:54] right right the combat Beast actually
[4:56] the combat Beast is all the way from
[4:58] here to here right and then takes you
[5:00] all the way up what I'm saying is you
[5:02] got you lion ox man and Eagle that's the
[5:05] whole bride right that's not just us
[5:09] that's the whole bride of Jesus Christ
[5:11] from the day of Pentecost till the day
[5:13] we go home all right so
[5:16] now just in plain language if you don't
[5:20] see those combat beefs
[5:23] anymore then they must have went
[5:25] somewhere and we know if they're Eternal
[5:29] they didn't didn't die right they went
[5:31] somewhere right right right cuz they
[5:35] disappeared so the here is God through
[5:38] all the church agers through the L man
[5:40] and eagle and then all of a sudden they
[5:43] disappear well it's they is not the Lono
[5:46] man and Eagle they is the bride that the
[5:48] liono man and Eagle is working through
[5:51] so he comes up to the fifth seal and you
[5:54] know the angel could say well William
[5:56] brandom what' he
[5:58] say
[6:00] and he could have said I you know
[6:01] scratched his head well I I don't know
[6:02] anything about this he said well where's
[6:04] your combat be and being a prophet he
[6:07] absolutely first thing he put the word
[6:09] together and said Somebody's missing
[6:13] okay somebody's missing in this next
[6:15] seal that was in these other
[6:18] four something's missing so there must
[6:20] be something take place so then brother
[6:22] ban said take place when the for and
[6:24] that's exactly correct right but now
[6:28] look cuz we're when we get into five six
[6:31] and seven we must know one thing for
[6:33] sure that something's got to work in a
[6:35] higher order okay not
[6:38] just you
[6:40] know like we said before you got you got
[6:43] baby form justification sanctification
[6:45] and then the baptism of Holy Ghost right
[6:48] all right then you've got justification
[6:52] sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost
[6:54] what in the pyramid yes right then you
[6:57] got justification satification baptism
[6:58] of Holy Ghost
[7:00] in The Believer in The Headstone right
[7:02] okay it's the same justification is just
[7:04] working in a higher in a higher realm
[7:06] more work so then we look here and we
[7:10] take this here and we know what the
[7:11] Rapture takes place then we know this is
[7:13] definitely to the Jews
[7:15] right it's all to the Jews but we know
[7:18] we're gone and nothing in that fifth
[7:22] seal refers to me and you as a natural
[7:26] happening got it natural happening you
[7:29] hear what say now but supernaturally
[7:31] though what's God doing he's taking us
[7:33] right back through and we're going to
[7:35] see justification sanctification baptism
[7:37] of the Holy Ghost and remember we got to
[7:39] go into an eight which is what which is
[7:41] the future
[7:44] home why I say future home because see
[7:47] sometimes you can you can argue and say
[7:51] this and it but we know one thing's for
[7:52] sure when we walk in the gates of that
[7:55] future home there is no somebody left
[7:58] here somebody left here somebody left
[8:00] down here somebody left over under
[8:02] there's not of this there's none of that
[8:04] right right that's why I love that
[8:06] message to Future home cuz brother Brown
[8:07] says I've taught justification
[8:09] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost since
[8:10] the day I started and he said it looks
[8:12] like this city is going to be come from
[8:13] the same thing all right same three step
[8:17] same three steps all right but you have
[8:20] to look here that you have to add this
[8:21] because remember four is man's number
[8:23] and it's not a good number if you just
[8:25] use the four but if four like Brother D
[8:29] talking about it four death Messengers 1
[8:31] 2 3 4 ate it down are the horse
[8:35] riders
[8:37] right then there's got to be four life
[8:39] Messengers bring it back up and what
[8:42] take us up right so four is not a bad
[8:46] number in
[8:48] Redemption okay what is what is your
[8:51] number four your number four is one two
[8:53] and three mixed together
[8:57] right mixed with faith that's okay
[9:01] brings what the word or the Capstone The
[9:04] Headstone right here but then we must
[9:07] look and see that there's still these
[9:10] now there's not eight seals we know that
[9:12] for a fact right right but remember if
[9:14] you stay sevens is always seven seven 7
[9:17] seven 7
[9:18] seven cuz remember Jesus Christ was the
[9:21] seventh seal but he
[9:24] died he had to die so that you and I one
[9:27] day going to see that we don't have to
[9:29] that's right okay and then we're going
[9:31] to go into an eternal rest okay for
[9:36] Earth
[9:38] body All Souls yes all animals all
[9:42] plants all Earth is going to be in
[9:45] Eternal condition that has brought you
[9:47] out of a
[9:49] seven into the eighth day amen now but
[9:53] look you got but you get the eth day
[9:55] back here
[9:58] spiritually in your soul today if you're
[10:00] born again that's your future home
[10:02] you're done it can't go up down
[10:04] sideways it can't even be condemned
[10:07] that's our problem we don't really see
[10:09] what that genesis6 man is I don't think
[10:11] as much as we taught it and preached it
[10:12] and taught it and preached it taught it
[10:14] preached it it's still something that is
[10:17] if we ever see it that's what's going to
[10:19] take us to that body chain
[10:22] yes because in Genesis 126 man has never
[10:25] changed since
[10:27] eternity it's just continued all the way
[10:29] across we're the ones that drop down in
[10:32] time for Redemption purposes right but
[10:36] what if we're going back to we we're
[10:38] going we're doing the timeline not today
[10:40] but in a few weeks but that timeline you
[10:42] got eternity well eternity just as far
[10:44] this way as it is this way we just drop
[10:46] down in time for a little while okay and
[10:49] then we're going to go what go right
[10:50] back
[10:53] up
[10:55] right man fell on the seventh day cuz he
[10:58] wasn't in an eth day right right that
[11:01] right that's right man fell on the
[11:03] seventh day cuz he wasn't in an eighth
[11:04] day now Adam in his soul that's what
[11:06] we're going to talk about this afternoon
[11:07] a little bit Adam and his soul that was
[11:10] the man that that that ruled everything
[11:12] like we talking about Sunday afternoon
[11:13] that man ruled the whole world right
[11:16] storm wind move this over here if he
[11:19] didn't want this island right here he
[11:21] put it right over here the whole
[11:23] island
[11:25] right creative I mean he was a little
[11:28] Creator that's what the problem
[11:29] what what is the number of creation or
[11:32] the number of
[11:34] completion seven is completion seven is
[11:38] completion but you got to remember if
[11:40] you don't go over into that one like
[11:43] brother Dale was talking about if you
[11:44] don't go get in that Eighth Day you got
[11:46] to come out of that seven right that's
[11:49] right see you can be Eternal in a seven
[11:51] seven is completion all the church ages
[11:53] are completed in a seven but they're all
[11:55] dead right the body changes is that
[11:59] Eighth Day yes cuz God never come out of
[12:03] that Eighth Day right he's always been
[12:05] in that in that Eternal you know right
[12:09] condition he's always been an a we got
[12:11] to remember that he's never and he's
[12:13] never
[12:14] changed I U was reading some quotes last
[12:18] night and it's just amazing how the
[12:21] prophet words things and we'll get into
[12:22] them a little bit this afternoon about
[12:25] what Adam did and what Eve cuz
[12:27] remember
[12:29] Eve never got her name until she until
[12:32] the fall right she was Adam right her
[12:36] name was Adam yes when God talked to
[12:38] Adam he talked to Adam and Eve both and
[12:41] he was talking to one person cuz
[12:43] remember June and I or your your husband
[12:46] and wife can be so one and absolutely
[12:49] you share yourself I was telling uh Jun
[12:52] the other day and give you something to
[12:54] laugh about but we've been married 37
[12:57] years and I uh was delivering mail saw
[13:01] mom and daddy that day too but I was
[13:02] delivering mail wasn't paying no
[13:03] attention so I put mail in the mailbox
[13:05] and I looked up in the mirror and there
[13:06] was this red car com it didn't I didn't
[13:08] see the little yellow lights on top that
[13:11] nny pops old car that's how I tell if
[13:13] start Trailblazer CU you can't see that
[13:15] most TR lasers don't have anyway so I
[13:17] looked back and I didn't see anything so
[13:18] I just put the mail on the mailbox why
[13:20] something just caught my eye and I
[13:22] looked over
[13:23] and this goodlooking girl had pulled
[13:26] right beside of me left the window
[13:29] down and she said what are you doing
[13:31] after
[13:35] work and I about BW a
[13:41] cind I was happy from my day that time
[13:45] so late up in the evening I was happy
[13:48] what are you doing what are you doing
[13:50] after
[13:51] work but you know what but we're that's
[13:53] we're so
[13:55] one and that's wonderful but that has
[13:58] that is not even close to the agape love
[14:00] that we are that that we have with
[14:03] Christ I mean that really that just blew
[14:05] my I was about to have a
[14:07] fit and
[14:09] U still turns me
[14:12] on it ought to be that way y'all not
[14:15] lose that but remember but look June and
[14:17] I never DNA wise will never be one right
[14:21] right humanly will never we share each
[14:24] other we we share everything we have but
[14:26] we're never going to be one but now Adam
[14:28] and Eve when he said she's bone of my
[14:30] bone and Flesh of My Flesh he meant
[14:33] that she was
[14:36] literally his body that's right made
[14:39] manifest in another form now that's what
[14:41] we got to see with Jesus Christ we got
[14:43] to become the
[14:45] literal body of Jesus Christ cuz if not
[14:48] then we're just another person and we're
[14:50] just we're just infal love we just and a
[14:52] lot of people love the Lord Brother
[14:53] Brown I'll tell you A lot of people love
[14:54] the Lord but they love him and feel your
[14:57] love like we have love for each other
[14:59] but they don't if you love him in agape
[15:01] love that's what that agape love is
[15:02] that's number eight that's an eternal
[15:05] love that never had a beginning never
[15:07] had an end sometimes we don't understand
[15:09] it we have to go through highs and we
[15:10] have to go through lows that's not to
[15:12] say that me and you don't have problems
[15:14] we don't do that every day we don't pull
[15:15] on one side of the road and you know and
[15:18] U and uh proposition each other but we
[15:22] have our bad days but still this right
[15:25] here is not a bad day and a good day
[15:27] though right
[15:29] when we get to that point right body
[15:32] chains living in a cuz remember what I
[15:34] said last
[15:35] Sunday the reason
[15:38] Adam come into the
[15:40] fall was that his flu would stop what do
[15:43] he have to do he started have worrying
[15:44] about a wife he started worrying about
[15:46] children brother I'm we read it we'll
[15:48] read it again I think maybe I may have
[15:49] cut it out business Affairs home Affairs
[15:52] that's what I tell you 80% of the time
[15:54] we live in this world right we think
[15:56] about what money time time to do things
[15:59] work family wife kid daughter
[16:04] son-in-law you understand what I'm
[16:06] saying a lot of that time is wasted and
[16:08] not really wasted but it's put in into
[16:11] our brain that 80% of the time we're not
[16:13] really thinking about God I mean really
[16:16] if you be honest with youself there's
[16:18] only certain times that you'll see
[16:19] something and it'll spark it and you'll
[16:22] but now remember Adam wasn't that way
[16:24] before the fall right so that's what we
[16:26] going we're going back to that point to
[16:29] where we have and Paul told us to have
[16:31] the mind of Christ but you can't have
[16:34] that's why he also said Paul said that a
[16:37] double-minded man is unstable right and
[16:40] we are we're double-minded we have the
[16:42] mind of Christ and we have the mind of
[16:44] the nature that we were born under right
[16:46] the nature of of taking care of four
[16:48] girls and and you know you understand
[16:50] what I'm saying that's why that
[16:53] um that I don't
[16:57] uh I don't see how some of you you know
[16:59] some some sisters have the four kids and
[17:03] but you know Charles and John Wesley had
[17:06] what 19 kids and their mama had to wash
[17:08] clothes and everything else but she sat
[17:10] down and read the Bible with them and
[17:11] she studied with them and all that but
[17:13] um but just telling you the Human Side
[17:15] so we but we got to come out of that
[17:17] Human Side in our thinking and when we
[17:19] do think about God this is what I think
[17:21] about the other thing when we do think
[17:22] or have that 20% of thinking about God
[17:25] it's valuable right it's in Revelation
[17:29] that's right it's not in just you say
[17:31] well I thought about this well you may
[17:33] be thinking about something how many of
[17:34] you have beening fing thinking about
[17:36] something though and God just drop down
[17:38] and and bring it right into what you're
[17:40] thinking and it really not be thinking
[17:42] about it' be a situation or a or
[17:44] thinking about what Christ did for you
[17:46] you know you do something for somebody
[17:47] and then and then God say well that's
[17:49] what I did for you you know that's right
[17:51] so so that's what but that's what we're
[17:53] dealing with but we got to come closer
[17:55] now to the supernatural than we do the
[17:57] natural but really it's not going to
[18:00] change it's probably going to get
[18:03] worse you know down at the squeeze part
[18:05] where we don't have a job we don't have
[18:06] no money we you know what God's going to
[18:09] say you're just like Abraham Abraham
[18:12] thought he could help me during his
[18:13] whole life but when he got down to where
[18:15] he couldn't help me no more he was dead
[18:18] his body was dead he said
[18:21] then Abraham said I can't do it I'm done
[18:24] and that's what we're going to have to
[18:25] do just say look cuz we sat trying to
[18:27] figure things out and we do everybody
[18:29] does everybody say trying to figure
[18:30] things out but forget figuring things
[18:32] out just listen to what the word said
[18:34] all right so now we've got the four life
[18:41] Messengers all right we got the four
[18:43] life Messengers we got the four death
[18:45] Messengers eat it down four life
[18:47] Messengers brought what brought us back
[18:49] to the
[18:50] word under the prophet's message it was
[18:53] so eaten down even in the Pentecostal
[18:56] realm when he did that restoration what
[18:58] he was doing he was restoring right
[19:00] restoration of the Bride tree I think
[19:02] that might be why he preached that
[19:03] message cuz he was restoring the
[19:07] bride yes back to an original condition
[19:11] all right back to what the word and then
[19:14] what's the word got to do the word has
[19:16] got to then take us the rest of the way
[19:18] right cuz you're not going to go back
[19:20] you know you're not going to go back and
[19:21] say well is this justification where I
[19:23] quit smoking drinking cussing not no
[19:25] that justification is when you move into
[19:27] that one
[19:29] you realize once and for all that you
[19:31] never did any of that right that real
[19:34] Genesis 126 man' takes over realiz
[19:37] you'll realize that you never that you
[19:39] never did the things you did listen
[19:42] there's therefore now no condemnation
[19:43] now Paul picked up on something there
[19:45] even in the first church act yes cuz
[19:48] what's our problem we're condemned every
[19:50] day that's right what was the problem
[19:51] with the girl or the sister walking
[19:52] across to get her healing brother BR
[19:54] said Satan condemned her and she didn't
[19:56] get her healing cuz she was a Christian
[19:58] and then he' said you do this you did
[19:59] this you did this prostitute walks
[20:01] across you know what she did the night
[20:02] before she knew she what she did that
[20:04] night she knew what she was going to do
[20:05] the next night that's right but she said
[20:07] I believe what that man says and God had
[20:09] to honor that faith of that prostitute
[20:11] that she believed what that man had said
[20:13] well let's start believing what the man
[20:15] said okay not just in the prayer line
[20:17] let's start believing the the message
[20:19] you know that he brought cuz these seals
[20:21] I'm telling you these seals are are are
[20:24] not for are not for babies right right
[20:27] this is not baby food right this is the
[20:30] this is the um uh prime rib at uh at
[20:36] Texas Roadhouse or or Ruth Chris
[20:38] whatever you know I mean this this is
[20:40] the Meat part and we got to start
[20:43] thinking like that if we don't then then
[20:45] we're going to be left behind amen or
[20:47] we're going to have like Brother D said
[20:48] we have to go by the grave amen which
[20:50] lesson is not and that's what I don't
[20:53] understand
[20:56] people I confess in till the body change
[20:59] but if something happens and and and and
[21:01] I go you know one thing's for sure
[21:03] something I couldn't reach God knew that
[21:05] and he's not going to be he's not going
[21:07] to let his
[21:09] child go on see even in the Old
[21:12] Testament when he let who was um
[21:15] Hezekiah lived 15 more years now I don't
[21:17] believe he'd have done that if it had
[21:19] been a born again child son and daughter
[21:21] of God you understand what I'm saying he
[21:22] takes care of his children now not
[21:24] saying Hezekiah is not going to be there
[21:25] Hezekiah is not his child some we do
[21:27] that we're going what he going to hell
[21:29] no he'll be there cuz he was a prophet
[21:31] in the Old Testament but he didn't have
[21:32] the new birth in his
[21:34] soul right if he had a new birth in his
[21:36] soul it would have been different yes
[21:39] all right so God would have took him
[21:40] home just like he did that brother um
[21:44] Ramsey
[21:45] Ramsey cuz brother Ramsey said a few
[21:47] months later he was gone cuz he didn't
[21:49] want God didn't want him Mar his name
[21:51] what he he didn't let him go 15 years he
[21:53] let him go just a few months that's
[21:54] right to try to straighten up and then
[21:56] took him home yes sir right but you see
[21:58] what I'm saying with all these things we
[21:59] we must realize that as long as we're
[22:02] living and breathing then we can move up
[22:05] into these steps yes even up the statue
[22:08] of a perfect man and even into cuz
[22:11] remember look there's no now don't get
[22:14] me wrong here but listen there's no
[22:16] revelation of the seals from here down
[22:19] okay partial but not
[22:22] full those Seven Seals was that
[22:24] headstone that man Jesus Christ and what
[22:27] he had in his brain not a human
[22:30] brain God's got a brain I hope youall
[22:33] know that yes okay so he he's got a
[22:36] brain that can be in 7even billion
[22:39] places at one time amen so but that's
[22:42] that right there that's getting us back
[22:44] to that Adam condition right here cuz
[22:47] brother R said whatever Adam lost Christ
[22:50] brought us back
[22:51] to and he ain't got to come back to
[22:54] bring it again he brought it all while
[22:55] he was
[22:56] here
[22:58] Jesus ain't got to come back brother ra
[23:00] ain't going to come back Jesus ain't
[23:01] going to come back in the corporate body
[23:02] we know that we meet him in the air then
[23:04] we all come back later on right okay to
[23:08] live through the Thousand-Year
[23:10] Millennium Reign and then then it's
[23:12] going to be the8 day future home
[23:14] everybody got that yes cuz there will be
[23:17] time in the Millennium there will be
[23:18] daylight and dark time A Thousand Years
[23:21] somebody's got to live a th000 years
[23:22] according to the 30-day calendar not the
[23:25] Thousand Years of 36 5 and four right so
[23:30] and I'm not going to sit there with a
[23:32] calendar when we in the Millennium I'm
[23:33] not going to sit there in the calendar
[23:34] and start figuring things out no done
[23:38] we're done with time we're done with
[23:40] we're done with time that's right we're
[23:41] creatures of Eternity right we still
[23:44] have to wear watch though we Twi a time
[23:48] but uh but when we get into that Eighth
[23:51] Day or we're caught up in a revelation
[23:54] now see that's what that's the the whole
[23:59] secret that God has before the
[24:01] foundation of the world he was going to
[24:03] take an eternal
[24:05] thought and bring it into
[24:07] time so he could get the ones out of
[24:10] time and bring them back into eternity
[24:12] to me that's just that's why I said
[24:14] Redemption brother said if you don't
[24:16] forget it he said don't forget that word
[24:18] Redemption why he come out that Eighth
[24:20] Day and come down into our
[24:22] time died resurrected ascended and
[24:25] started pulling his children right back
[24:27] up
[24:28] into that Eighth Day and Paul caught
[24:30] that Revelation he said sitting in
[24:32] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but it
[24:34] was only a partial remember is a partial
[24:36] Revelation this is not Jesus wasn't
[24:39] partially God right you and I are part
[24:43] God cuz we have a Humanity side that our
[24:46] parents brought yes right all right
[24:49] Jesus was the fullness of the godhead by
[24:52] but now all of us
[24:54] collectively as brother Dale has been
[24:56] preaching all of us collect ly is the
[24:58] fullness of the godhead body gifts
[25:02] callings preachers teachers people with
[25:06] wisdom faith that brings the whole
[25:08] that's what Christ was he was all that
[25:10] together and that's what brought us the
[25:13] headstone came right down here he was
[25:15] rejected remember became the Cornerstone
[25:18] and started building his body back up
[25:20] why he started building the BR
[25:22] tree amen so now as we go through these
[25:25] seals when you see these four horse
[25:27] riders leave now that doesn't mean that
[25:30] Satan left right no cuz in this fifth
[25:36] seal you going to see somebody died and
[25:38] somebody's going to get killed so he's
[25:41] still
[25:42] there but he's not going to
[25:46] be I mean the bride is not going to be
[25:48] in this time
[25:50] period that all right the bride's not
[25:53] going to be here that's right when we
[25:54] get what we're talking about so
[25:56] everything that we talk about right here
[25:58] has got to lap back you heard that word
[26:01] lap over
[26:03] before lap back into
[26:07] here to catch a body chain cuz you can
[26:10] be the word made flesh and your flesh
[26:12] still
[26:13] be getting older and right greater
[26:22] grer but once you come to this eth day
[26:24] cuz that's what we've got to bring I
[26:26] told y'all last Sunday
[26:28] and that's what hit me eternal life is
[26:30] in what is in the Eighth Day
[26:33] right eternal
[26:36] life now we're here stuck in time and
[26:42] death why would that even want to come
[26:44] back
[26:46] here why would that whole six Dimension
[26:48] want to come back into this Dimension
[26:50] where there death death
[26:53] Reigns in this
[26:55] Dimension but when you find a group of
[26:58] people and it may not be but just a few
[26:59] just a little spot in this Dimension yes
[27:03] that brings eternity so real till
[27:08] death like well brother L said this way
[27:11] but you got you got to brush him off
[27:13] death this way you don't bring him on
[27:15] when you brush him off but when you
[27:18] brush death off then what that do that
[27:20] brings them back into this Dimension cuz
[27:22] they got to come back into this
[27:24] Dimension to pick up their bodies they
[27:26] can't get an earth ly body where they're
[27:28] sitting at now right right right they
[27:32] can't brother BR said what he said well
[27:34] we don't either they said we don't need
[27:36] a drink over here that's right we're
[27:38] waiting in other
[27:39] words they're not they and listen they
[27:42] may be in an eighth day and that may be
[27:45] that's their theophany but they're not
[27:47] in a 100% condition that they're
[27:50] supposed to be in okay right their souls
[27:54] under the altar crying how long but not
[27:57] to judge judge and avenge our
[28:00] blood cuz
[28:03] listen they were a human on this
[28:06] earth right yes they got a body laying
[28:09] somewhere they got to come back and pick
[28:11] up so they can eat and drink and enjoy
[28:15] being a human way more than somebody
[28:19] pulling up beside you and saying what
[28:21] you doing after
[28:24] work I mean really
[28:28] former things have pass away behold all
[28:29] things have become new that's right amen
[28:31] we're not going to they're not going to
[28:33] come back into this Dimension and go
[28:35] well we got to go work
[28:38] more well I wonder if uh no now brother
[28:43] told us they come back in the
[28:45] resurrection and we were here for 30 to
[28:46] 40 days you know what he said remember
[28:49] what he said he said God knew they'd
[28:51] want to find out who made it and who
[28:52] didn't so he gave them at 30 and 40 days
[28:55] without him being here and then we're
[28:57] going to be changed and caught up and
[28:58] then we're going to go meet Jesus Christ
[29:01] in the air at 30 to 40 days these people
[29:04] are going to walk around and going you
[29:06] made it you made it you made it how
[29:08] about old Susan well she didn't make you
[29:11] know
[29:13] so no offense to su su but
[29:18] U Joan
[29:20] or but you know you understand but
[29:22] that's what the prophet God said that's
[29:24] right he said that 30 to 40 days he said
[29:26] these people coming back
[29:28] in the resurrection God knew they'd want
[29:30] to know who made it and and re you know
[29:33] re reunite with their families and who
[29:35] made it and who didn't make it they
[29:36] figure all that out and then we go home
[29:39] or we go listen we don't go home right
[29:43] we go to a marriage supper that's not
[29:45] home that's right we we God just rented
[29:47] a banquet hall
[29:49] somewhere you ready cuz that's not our
[29:51] home that's right then when we come back
[29:53] here this is our home potentially but
[29:55] there's still stuff around here that we
[29:57] got
[29:58] that's right amen cuz we judge the 12
[30:01] tribes amen
[30:02] amen then we come to this is the home we
[30:06] always been looking for is that future
[30:08] home that comes down and when it comes
[30:10] down demons are
[30:12] gone everything swallowed
[30:19] up
[30:20] and as the Bible says Eye Has Not Seen
[30:24] ear is not heard but look we get a glimp
[30:27] of that though
[30:29] yes cuz you know Rapture is just just
[30:33] for a few minutes we talking about the
[30:34] Rapture Rapture is just an it's just
[30:37] because of an event that happened the
[30:39] Rapture will never take place until the
[30:43] Dead come out of the
[30:45] ground so we got to get the dead out of
[30:47] the ground first we got to get that
[30:49] Dimension here then we which are alive
[30:51] and remain shall be changed in a moment
[30:55] ey caught up together CAU caught up but
[30:58] Rapture really now you got to remember
[31:00] that word rapture is not always caught
[31:03] up it's it's an it's a euphoric
[31:08] condition Rapture is a condition that
[31:11] everything is just wonderful right right
[31:14] Euphoria just you know that's and what
[31:17] it is hey when we get when we get a body
[31:19] change and we look around and see all
[31:21] this other junk still going on around
[31:23] here and we're changing the moment twk
[31:25] of an ey and caught up out of this to
[31:27] another dimension and let them fight it
[31:30] out over here what a joyous time ain't
[31:33] got to worry about the
[31:40] IRS we ain't got to worry about having
[31:42] money in our
[31:44] pocket we can travel like a thought
[31:46] that's
[31:47] right listen we're not going to go set
[31:50] in a building for three and a half years
[31:51] and just eat no we're going to be the
[31:53] happiest fch people we're going to be
[31:55] all over the place that's right and like
[31:57] I said before even if we could come back
[31:59] into this Dimension it wouldn't hurt us
[32:00] a bit how you going to hurt a glorified
[32:03] body Jesus
[32:06] Christ you know if somebody gets blowed
[32:08] up the angel comes in and takes that
[32:10] soul out it don't bother one bit that's
[32:12] right but in this Dimension when we have
[32:14] this kind of solid Lifetime and matter
[32:17] or life life and matter the prophet said
[32:19] then that's the problem we've come into
[32:22] a dimension that there's boundaries
[32:24] that's right and Jesus had boundaries he
[32:27] never walked through a wall before
[32:29] before the resurrection it was never
[32:31] recorded that he did but bu after the
[32:33] resurrection he be seen over here be
[32:36] seen over here be seen over here and he
[32:37] come right through that concrete and
[32:39] just be as human as as this right here
[32:42] Thomas touch me that's
[32:45] right hold me that's right and that's
[32:48] what brother Brown said he went when he
[32:49] even when he went across a curtain of
[32:50] time even in their theophany condition
[32:53] he can hold
[32:55] them there's a a lot more to that
[32:57] theophany body than than we
[33:00] think what about God we'll read it this
[33:03] afternoon what about God killing two
[33:06] animals and and stripping them of their
[33:09] skin I ain't seen many ghosts do that
[33:12] right it must be somebody that's solid
[33:15] could come down in this Dimension slay
[33:18] two animals pull the skins off of them
[33:20] throw them back in the woods and say
[33:23] here put these on make that covering but
[33:26] that's some things that we need to keep
[33:27] turning around her mind because it's
[33:28] just not white horse riders it's not
[33:31] just red horse riders no this is a scene
[33:34] it's a happening Brother Brown said this
[33:35] is a scene Jans saw a
[33:38] scene that happened same thing
[33:41] Revelation 5 that was a scene what in
[33:43] another dimension he saw a scene of a
[33:45] lamb coming taking a book all right but
[33:49] I believe the lamb when he when he
[33:50] brought these seals he brought the
[33:52] complete plan Plan of
[33:54] Redemption and give it to a prophet has
[33:57] to first cuz the word comes to Prophet
[33:58] first then that Prophet distributes it
[34:01] out and and I was thinking today you
[34:03] know
[34:04] we sometimes we wonder why brother
[34:07] around said the things he
[34:10] did well don't we wonder sometimes what
[34:12] Jesus the things Jesus
[34:15] said I mean it's a hard statement to say
[34:17] eat my flesh and drink my blood and
[34:18] never say anything about it and then you
[34:20] go over there and this guy says well let
[34:21] me go let me go bury my mom he said let
[34:24] the dead bury the dead he said you let
[34:26] you come follow me now that's pretty
[34:28] harsh that's right and all the some of
[34:30] the things that You' seen now that
[34:31] wasn't just well that was the human
[34:34] Jesus no that was he was God Almighty
[34:37] all the time all right he wasn't that's
[34:39] right he didn't slip into a second
[34:41] person or a third person and then he
[34:44] jump back to the first person no he was
[34:47] that was the mind of God sure there was
[34:48] things like let's go eat or what we
[34:50] going to eat today absolutely that's the
[34:52] human part but what's written in that
[34:55] Bible I think the Bible said they was
[34:57] all given for
[34:58] examples everything not just pieces of
[35:01] it was given for examples you read in
[35:04] Paul's
[35:05] writings to
[35:07] timotheus and he talks about the other
[35:09] people and the Saints of the Ephesus and
[35:11] he's writing a letter and you say well
[35:13] that's the Eternal Word of God well it's
[35:14] in there for something for somebody to
[35:17] catch that and and how many times have
[35:19] you read something though and a preacher
[35:21] come in and preach on it and you say I
[35:22] never seen it like that before that's
[35:23] right I mean I'm going back to the
[35:25] little I like the little Gospels Timothy
[35:27] and yes and Titus and John Little John
[35:30] first second third John and I'm reading
[35:32] them now and man you it's just and all
[35:34] it is though is I mean I don't mean that
[35:36] Paul is sitting down and he's going I
[35:39] came to visit you and this is what I saw
[35:41] right right this is what you did and
[35:44] this is what a Christian should do I saw
[35:47] you at and I pray that God will preserve
[35:50] you and he's writing a letter just like
[35:52] I'd write a letter to to to brother
[35:55] Aaron if he was off in another country
[35:57] and God thought so much of that it was
[35:58] his Eternal Word coming down they put it
[36:00] in the
[36:01] Bible I'm sure when Paul was writing
[36:04] that he was writing letter that's right
[36:06] but somebody got a hold of that letter
[36:08] and somebody got connection with the
[36:09] almighty and the almighty says that's U
[36:12] that was me talking that wasn't just
[36:14] Paul that was me talking put that in the
[36:17] Bible hello I mean the 66 books of the
[36:21] Bible is not 67 that's right man has
[36:23] tried to put the book of Judas and the
[36:25] Book of this and the Book of my
[36:27] but see God never but he put them 66
[36:29] books together and he said here this is
[36:31] what you going to learn from this is
[36:33] what you're going to learn from and if
[36:35] it's Paul talking to Timothy over in
[36:37] Thessalonians to the Thessalonians
[36:39] that's my that's my Eternal Word of God
[36:41] that's me talking to you telling you to
[36:43] go talk to somebody else that's right
[36:45] you understand what I'm saying okay is
[36:47] that all right
[36:48] amen so before we go one more time you
[36:52] got your opening of the seals up to four
[36:56] for and then we take a Rapture combat
[36:58] Beast are gone but we have to lap this
[37:01] back let's get take that out for the
[37:04] moment we got to take these and we got
[37:06] to lap them back over here cuz to the
[37:08] Bride of Jesus Christ we don't get this
[37:10] in its natural form so we must get it in
[37:13] a spiritual form and see the different
[37:16] layers that this justification it's not
[37:19] brother Brown said he said if I didn't
[37:20] rob a
[37:22] bank I'm not guilty that's right right
[37:25] right he now somebody can say I did
[37:30] it remember we'll read it I I can't
[37:33] remember what book it's in but he goes
[37:34] through um you did
[37:39] it and then the real you and then you
[37:42] know you get it the number three we'll
[37:44] read it again and then I mean number two
[37:46] and then number three he goes the real
[37:48] you didn't do it start with he said you
[37:50] said brother you robbed the bank
[37:53] yesterday I wasn't there I didn't do it
[37:57] I was
[37:58] accused of doing
[38:00] it but I wasn't even there so that's the
[38:03] same thing with this justification right
[38:04] here that's not as it no it's as if you
[38:07] didn't do it is number two it's not as
[38:09] if you never did it the real you never
[38:12] did it in first place now when we come
[38:14] to that then you've come into this
[38:16] Revelation that this only does what this
[38:19] inside tells it to do only okay so it's
[38:23] not your flesh is your
[38:24] problem okay now know brother Brown said
[38:27] when God put Adam and Eve in flesh they
[38:30] fell why because they were finally in a
[38:33] form that they couldn't
[38:36] fall Genesis 126 man couldn't fall as
[38:39] long as they stay Spirit man there's no
[38:41] sex involved let's just be plain there's
[38:43] no there's no carnal mind there's no
[38:46] lust it's all um agape love right but he
[38:50] put them in in flesh to what to rule the
[38:52] ground so that some so that the animals
[38:54] could see their leader could see the
[38:56] person this that that they're dealing
[38:57] with the Beast and all that but God knew
[39:00] when he put them in human flesh they
[39:02] were they were going to
[39:04] fall and the flesh only manifested when
[39:07] she got the carnal mind her body
[39:09] manifested it but remember the seed was
[39:11] planted up here first before it was
[39:13] planted anywhere else all right let's go
[39:16] Bob you up next
[39:18] [Music]
[39:20] Sunday
