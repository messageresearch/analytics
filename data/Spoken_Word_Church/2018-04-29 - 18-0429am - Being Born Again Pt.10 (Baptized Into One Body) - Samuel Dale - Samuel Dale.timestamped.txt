[19:39] help the people to see because that's
[19:41] what it's all about
[19:42] we're here for that purpose to gain not
[19:46] just head knowledge Lord but to gain
[19:48] spiritual knowledge of the kingdom and
[19:50] in the growth developments and we know
[19:53] that that must come also by head
[19:55] knowledge so we ask you to open our eyes
[19:57] of our physical beings that we could see
[20:00] your word but then open our hearts that
[20:03] we may be able to receive it by
[20:05] revelation forgive our sins and bless
[20:08] each one and just keep us all together
[20:10] in you in Jesus name did his brother Bob
[20:17] did he get the message I guess he's in
[20:21] the back room
[20:23] I know the fact okay loans we got the
[20:25] message
[20:26] he's the Minister of Industry all right
[20:28] first Peter we've been reading these
[20:32] scriptures for quite a while and been on
[20:34] the thought but yet the Prophet said
[20:37] hold it up until the people get it and
[20:39] then move on so that's what we're trying
[20:41] our best to do all right so let's go to
[20:44] first Peter 1:18 for as much as you know
[20:48] that you were not redeemed with
[20:50] corruptible things as silver and gold
[20:52] from your vain conversation received by
[20:55] tradition from your father's but with
[20:58] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[21:00] lamb without blemish and without spot
[21:02] Hoover Li was foreordained before the
[21:05] foundation of the world but was manifest
[21:07] in these life's times for you who by him
[21:10] do believe in God that raised him up
[21:13] from the dead and gave him glory and
[21:17] that's your faith in your hope might be
[21:19] in God seeing you have purified your
[21:22] souls and obeying the truth through the
[21:25] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[21:27] Brethren see that ye love one another
[21:30] with a pure heart fervently being born
[21:33] again not a corruptible seed but of
[21:37] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[21:39] abideth which liveth and abideth forever
[21:42] now remember whatever your birth starts
[21:46] with it will end in that same point or
[21:52] thoughts if it starts with the word the
[21:56] birth will end in the word it won't
[21:59] change and become some other idea or
[22:01] thought along the way it has to be to
[22:04] that point okay
[22:05] so now we go to 2nd Peter 1 Simon Peter
[22:08] served an apostle of Jesus Christ to
[22:10] them that have obtained like precious
[22:12] faith with us through the righteousness
[22:14] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace
[22:19] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[22:20] the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[22:23] Lord
[22:23] according and His divine power have
[22:26] given them given unto us all things that
[22:29] pertain unto life and godliness through
[22:31] the knowledge of him that have called us
[22:34] to glory in virtue
[22:35] whereby are given unto
[22:37] us exceeding great and precious promises
[22:39] that by these you might be partakers of
[22:42] the divine nature having escaped the
[22:45] corruption that is in the world through
[22:46] lust and beside this giving all
[22:49] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[22:51] to virtue and knowledge you may be
[22:53] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[22:57] reading of the word now I know we have
[22:59] been we have been quite a while trying
[23:06] to hold on to the thought and in dealing
[23:10] with the new birth the baptism of the
[23:14] Holy Ghost and the different things
[23:16] trying to get that point anchored into
[23:20] our thinking and this past Wednesday I
[23:23] tried to speak just a point of of the
[23:29] new birth and what it is because you
[23:32] know we came up through in our thoughts
[23:34] and our studies and we found it of
[23:37] disciples that the church started off on
[23:39] the day of Pentecost with a hundred and
[23:42] twenty in the Upper Room receiving the
[23:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that
[23:47] placing them at the basis of where it
[23:50] says the Holy Spirit on the pyramid you
[23:52] know and the Prophet said they had these
[23:54] virtues all right but then there was
[23:57] 3,000 outside that only heard one sermon
[24:01] so you wouldn't place them positionally
[24:04] but you would put those people as to the
[24:08] thought now get it in your mind
[24:10] petering them they were at a certain
[24:15] position because they had been two to
[24:19] three and a half years all right
[24:21] then when the Holy Ghost failed see look
[24:23] we're positioned all right then they
[24:25] could teach others and that's what
[24:28] Peter's doing we'll get to that later
[24:30] Peter is trying to teach others to try
[24:33] to come to where he was now whoever the
[24:35] others see the 3,000 outside only heard
[24:39] one message you know or something to
[24:42] that order and they become born-again
[24:43] Christians all right into the body of
[24:47] Christ sealed by the Holy Spirit giving
[24:50] turn a life into their soul all right
[24:52] making them part of the body of Christ
[24:55] so that's the group of people Peter is
[24:58] dealing with now we'll keep emphasizing
[25:02] this point until we get it's anchored
[25:05] into our mind because we read it that
[25:07] Peter said that he was sending this
[25:10] message to those of like precious faith
[25:14] right now see then that light precious
[25:18] faith is not sending to 120 because they
[25:25] have gone beyond that in their growth
[25:29] development and been sealed in and and
[25:31] positioned because of the word they
[25:34] heard but it's to those that were in
[25:38] Christ as we'll get to in a minute and
[25:42] how do you get into Christ by one spirit
[25:44] should all baptized into one body right
[25:46] all right
[25:47] see then that Holy Spirit it puts us
[25:52] into the kingdom all right now we will
[25:56] review these letters we come back
[25:58] through but yet peter dinh and Paul and
[26:00] them would be speaking of babies but yet
[26:07] that have the earnest of the inheritance
[26:11] sealed into the kingdom but yet the
[26:15] growth development it's not dark all
[26:17] right see is I hope you follow that
[26:22] because I keep emphasizing that point
[26:25] that that one hundred and twenty ain't
[26:29] saying all of them it's whatever God
[26:30] does with them but I'm just saying this
[26:33] group of people that were used like
[26:36] Peter and them to write the word all
[26:39] right now see those that were there in
[26:43] the upper room were used to write the
[26:44] word you don't see a novice over
[26:47] somewhere with God giving them sure he
[26:50] can't but he always sends it by those
[26:53] who are anchored in the word all right
[26:57] so those people in the upper room were
[27:00] anchored as the Holy Spirit could
[27:02] quicken under the
[27:04] and Jesus said I'll call dear if the
[27:07] Holy Ghost would come comforter and will
[27:09] call to you remember it's watch whatever
[27:11] he's tall and the Prophet said even
[27:13] teach them things to come
[27:15] all right then it's left up to somebody
[27:20] to advance to a position to be able to
[27:23] teach us how to get tired and be like me
[27:25] saying to you no I said come on down on
[27:28] down to brother Donnie shop tomorrow and
[27:31] and I'm going to show you how to tear
[27:33] down a transmission and put it back
[27:35] together now I could show you how to
[27:39] tear it down right
[27:43] Richard tore a motor apart up in the
[27:45] building one day and he was turned down
[27:48] and this throwing blokes here and there
[27:49] and I said I'd have to ride on every one
[27:52] of them were it when I said you think
[27:55] that thing gonna run well you know
[27:56] surprisingly did you know he got it back
[28:01] together you know why cause he'd done it
[28:02] before he'd been there well that's what
[28:05] God is doing with the disciples see that
[28:08] become the Apostles disciple means a
[28:11] follower possible means one sent they
[28:14] became the apostles to bring the word to
[28:18] the people to show us how to get to
[28:21] where they were all right seeing that
[28:24] you understand what I'm saying then that
[28:25] three thousand needed somebody to teach
[28:28] them we yet they were born again and
[28:32] Peter was saying I'm born again well
[28:34] written a minute
[28:35] and he said I'm bringing this to those
[28:37] that are born again like I am but it was
[28:40] to show how to grow in grace and
[28:43] knowledge alright so then what I've done
[28:46] Wednesday night is drop back and just
[28:49] kind of like we're starting the point of
[28:53] you know the new birth all right what is
[28:57] the new birth we know it's the birth of
[29:01] the word all right now so then we start
[29:05] from that like them back there like the
[29:09] three thousand that heard the word
[29:11] receive the new birth when we receive
[29:16] the new birth that's what it does to
[29:18] in me it makes us babies in Christ they
[29:23] don't make us full-grown no more than a
[29:26] natural baby would be born full-grown
[29:28] all right
[29:30] see if we take the natural to top the
[29:32] spiritual when I see then once we are
[29:35] born again you realize that really the
[29:38] new birth just puts you into position to
[29:40] grow and just put you in position to
[29:45] grow in Christ all right see it doesn't
[29:48] do it
[29:48] oh we Baptists we got everything yeah
[29:52] yeah we got everything that's where it
[29:54] in the message I got everything I just
[29:55] come in the message I got everything
[29:58] well words you get it you know I mean
[30:04] it's that's just the point where did you
[30:05] get it how did you get it when I born
[30:08] into it see that's where people who tell
[30:11] you you can't tell me I don't have it
[30:12] all
[30:13] I've got quotes from the Prophet okay
[30:15] I'll go with you I know where the
[30:18] Prophet said when you receive the Holy
[30:19] Ghost you get all you need I don't agree
[30:23] with that when you receive the Holy
[30:26] Ghost you get all you need that's all
[30:28] you need right that's all you need
[30:32] because that's gonna take you through
[30:36] that's gonna give you the new Birds it's
[30:39] just like a baby when it's born into
[30:41] this world it's got all that it needs
[30:44] right but it certainly doesn't have all
[30:49] that it's gonna get of necessity to live
[30:54] right see then that's what I'm trying to
[30:57] get us to do now is to say all right now
[31:02] we're trying to place our point back
[31:05] because I keep quoting these and I gave
[31:08] them a bunch to you the other day you
[31:09] know where the Prophet said the Holy
[31:11] Ghost we receive the same Holy Ghost
[31:14] there was even with Abraham and let him
[31:17] through the same Holy Ghost that came
[31:20] onto their Pentecost is the same Holy
[31:23] Ghost new birth that you receive when
[31:28] you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior
[31:30] and listen member
[31:31] covering Wednesday and when he accepts
[31:34] you
[31:36] now we accept him as our Savior we must
[31:40] all right and we can't do that remember
[31:43] until God starts dealing with us
[31:46] okay but when he starts dealing with it
[31:50] he calls us to himself all right that
[31:53] call is what leads us home it's we're
[31:57] talking about Wednesday night go to
[31:58] future home and listen to what the
[32:00] Prophet had decided see you repent of
[32:05] your sins and God forgives you your sins
[32:08] all right when he said that does nothing
[32:11] to the future part of you all that does
[32:14] is remit the sins of the past all right
[32:18] now then he says we go on to
[32:22] sanctification cleansing and setting
[32:25] aside right and how is that done by the
[32:32] studying of God's Word
[32:34] I'm coming to church but I'm doing it
[32:36] following things that you're supposed to
[32:38] do getting away from things you're not
[32:40] supposed to do you know and seeing those
[32:43] stages you have something to do now
[32:46] listen when you repent of your sins
[32:49] that's something for you to do right so
[32:52] you have something to do with your
[32:54] justification your salvation starts by
[32:59] believing on Jesus Christ amen
[33:01] all right and as it does you have
[33:04] something to do with that now listen the
[33:09] thing when you come to sanctification
[33:12] the cleansing and set them aside for
[33:14] service you have something to do with
[33:16] that yet it is the work of the Holy
[33:18] Spirit
[33:19] it was the goodness of God the Bible
[33:22] said that leadeth us to repentance all
[33:26] right what you see it's you and him
[33:28] working now forgive me don't get all
[33:30] blue I know it ain't a sister listen
[33:33] what I'm saying justification is God
[33:37] coming to you just showing you that you
[33:41] need to be saved
[33:43] the goodness of God is calling you and
[33:47] you can't come unless he does all right
[33:50] now that's why I brought a rattling
[33:52] sight don't go back to my old or
[33:55] something like that and get to people
[33:56] try to talk them into coming up he said
[33:59] you'll make them a 2-fold child cuz
[34:01] they're gonna have a harder time the
[34:03] next time he said let God do the work
[34:06] yeah but I'm glad to you can't argue
[34:10] with people they're not gonna listen to
[34:14] you Lord told me to go do that I don't
[34:17] do what Laura told me all right I'm
[34:22] gonna do what the Prophet said okay
[34:26] I ain't going back darin gets you and
[34:29] bring you up here I've been there
[34:32] that's reason I ain't gonna do it
[34:34] he didn't doing good with me it drove me
[34:37] the other way but you see Church that's
[34:42] what it does justification our
[34:45] repentance leads us to Christ we repent
[34:50] of our sins realizing we're sinners all
[34:52] right so it's the work of God dealing
[34:56] with you to get you to repent but you
[35:02] got a part to do with it why you got to
[35:04] repent well I've got the other
[35:08] salvations in God ain't no come on
[35:11] listen to what I'm saying
[35:15] don't be so think you know you know well
[35:18] salvation of the Lord Amen but you got
[35:23] to repent it sanctification is dealing
[35:29] with that unclean spirit being driven
[35:32] out of us that ol Adamic nature coming
[35:38] into us as we were children and coming
[35:40] into the world and thing all right the
[35:43] salvation the sanctification starts
[35:45] cleansing that taking it out of us until
[35:50] we get new desires and you thoughts and
[35:53] all like that but that's the danger one
[35:56] cause when you start doing that see you
[36:00] start thinking well I'm saved what I
[36:03] need anything else
[36:05] I've had these desires to go away from
[36:08] me that's why I brought around them in I
[36:11] believe it's Chrysler mystery he said
[36:13] that's why you see scrap heaps of
[36:15] ministers and Christians he said piled
[36:20] along the way yeah but what do you want
[36:25] me to do you mean I want you to listen
[36:27] to the word the Holy Spirit starts
[36:33] working through sanctification cleansing
[36:37] us and bringing us to a place all right
[36:40] let's see your you are the one that's
[36:43] having to work in that room with God
[36:46] now listen because he's condemning you
[36:49] for do it and you repent and you try to
[36:51] get rid of these things and do these
[36:53] things right but then when salvation
[36:56] comes now that's you accepting him a
[36:59] justification sanctification but when
[37:03] salvation comes
[37:04] that's when he's accepting you joys all
[37:08] the work of the Holy Spirit but yet you
[37:11] the only thing you do in the new birth
[37:15] is accept Jesus Christ you accept him as
[37:20] your Savior you asked for forgiveness of
[37:24] your sins you follow after him through
[37:28] the cleansing of the daily lives and the
[37:30] times but then when he accepts you now
[37:35] salvation is of the Lord from in oh oh
[37:41] you gonna be doing is yielding yourself
[37:44] to that that's within you so it's not
[37:49] working up this or working of that one I
[37:51] was trying to get that Wednesday night
[37:53] cause like I said we we teach somebody
[37:58] said what what is the new work its
[38:00] justification same getting baptism
[38:01] although well if that's not explained if
[38:06] that's not explained
[38:09] what ideas do you have children what do
[38:13] you think about when you say
[38:15] justification more didn't I see that's
[38:20] why we need to explain what
[38:22] justification is that is you repent of
[38:27] your sins it's you accepting Jesus
[38:33] Christ as your Savior and crying out for
[38:36] repentance
[38:38] what is sanctification it's God coming
[38:43] in and working a work through you to
[38:46] drive out that unclean spirit No
[38:51] remember now listen real careful
[38:57] remember you can say justification is
[39:03] only the outward part of man no it's not
[39:07] that's what's wrong with the religious
[39:09] world because they do repent they do ask
[39:14] for forgiveness but if there's not
[39:16] something from that very inward soul of
[39:19] mankind
[39:20] now you're going to differ with Arabic
[39:22] go ahead repentance starts from the
[39:27] inward man not just your body in your
[39:30] spirit repentant that's what's called
[39:33] called caused the biggest portion of the
[39:37] world to be religious than never to be
[39:41] cleansed you say wait a minute you got
[39:46] Satan in there that's right but you're
[39:49] in there too right you said wait a
[39:57] minute no wait a minute devil ain't in
[39:58] me will you tell me is not then I'll
[40:00] tell you your own that soul of that baby
[40:07] that child a person whatever age
[40:09] whatever accountability God does not
[40:13] just deal with your body there's no
[40:17] salvation of that part he does not deal
[40:20] just with your spirit
[40:22] there's no salvation to that part it's
[40:25] just acquitting or doing a ritual or do
[40:28] it's something on the inside you say
[40:33] yeah but I don't understand how it can
[40:36] be something in there when Satan is
[40:38] there that's true but you were there
[40:42] all he's there is converting your nature
[40:47] making you think wrong and do wrong all
[40:53] right so see justification starts with
[40:58] the soul then sanctification drives that
[41:09] unclean spirit out of that soul that
[41:13] nature that part of you that was a damn
[41:15] it that's why we got to get it filled or
[41:20] keep it clean because if not then the
[41:23] unclean spirit will come back were not
[41:26] in your body forget all of that
[41:30] let it come from the inside out that's
[41:33] what we tried to do we tried to
[41:35] outwardly make Christians of people
[41:41] we've tried to do it in their body and
[41:44] you see them come to church do for a
[41:47] while but then you see them fall away
[41:51] but why is it that you see some that
[41:54] come they'll just keep coming they'll
[41:58] keep coming and after a while they get
[42:01] settled in and then going with the Lord
[42:05] but the biggest portion now you know
[42:07] yourself the biggest portion you get
[42:11] somebody to alter you get them to come
[42:13] and pray and they believe they're saved
[42:20] but they're doing they don't go on they
[42:22] don't have nobody to tell them how to go
[42:24] on and see then after a while you see
[42:28] them falling away without half what
[42:31] would it be the second time you try to
[42:33] get them to the altar
[42:36] see that's why this the Scriptures tells
[42:39] you the it's the goodness of God that
[42:44] leads you to repentance God not dealing
[42:46] with you brain he's got to work through
[42:48] that come on he's got to work through
[42:52] your ears would you realize right now
[42:55] through your ears in your brain that
[42:59] your two parts now you tell me on it
[43:01] right because the devil's on one side
[43:03] talking to these gods on the other side
[43:05] now we don't believe in them little
[43:07] devil sticking out over here somewhere
[43:08] right you know the pictures of all that
[43:10] we talk about junk we're talking about
[43:15] if you don't go on with God and know how
[43:19] to go on with God especially to the
[43:28] young ones you got to be justified safe
[43:31] I feel the Holy Ghost they know nothing
[43:33] about what you're saying and what I was
[43:37] trying to do Wednesday night because I
[43:39] wanted to start with just as simple as I
[43:42] could start of the new birth because
[43:47] that's what those 3,000 got was the new
[43:50] birth right but it was only from one
[43:54] sermon right how could they know very
[44:00] much about God but they believed because
[44:05] read the book of Acts of how that Peter
[44:09] laid down that scripture to us showing
[44:12] the things and what it was and how
[44:14] Christ died and all the things and then
[44:16] when they did they come under conviction
[44:19] and they said men and brethren what must
[44:21] we do to be saved
[44:25] then it was now like the Prophet said
[44:28] they asked what it was to do to be safe
[44:30] did we tell them what not to do well you
[44:34] need to quit this knee quit that would
[44:35] know that is what the Bible says the
[44:39] Bible said repent everyone else be
[44:41] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[44:43] the remission of sins and you shall
[44:45] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[44:48] right
[44:50] it puts it to a basis that you got to
[44:52] just get you just starting mental
[44:55] salvation will only make new converts
[44:58] but after a while they'll go away but if
[45:05] people would just that's always only
[45:07] thing that I've ever tried to do is get
[45:09] people to just sit down and listen
[45:11] because everybody that comes here when
[45:13] they start a brother Dell Sandeep I
[45:15] can't understand you well that's the
[45:18] deep I can't understand you sit down and
[45:22] listen for a while you've listened to
[45:26] everything else
[45:27] you remember the story talk about Rollo
[45:30] and that guy wanted to tell me about
[45:32] this statue of perfect land he said okay
[45:33] I got sixty five sermons I'll sing I
[45:35] ain't got time to listen sixty five
[45:37] sermons he said you've listened to
[45:40] everything else and ain't come up with
[45:41] nothing
[45:43] you think I'm Stern what is it true
[45:48] listen salvation does not work in your
[45:52] body it does not work in your spirit
[45:58] what good is it to have a good body in a
[46:00] good spirit salvation is in the soul of
[46:04] mankind and that soul of mankind is
[46:08] created now brother Branham on you
[46:12] arguing him he said everybody's born
[46:15] with the same gift
[46:19] come on yeah come on you like to quote
[46:24] but you don't want to quote at all
[46:26] everybody's born with that pool to God
[46:29] every person in the world is born with
[46:32] some form of drawing of them toward God
[46:36] that's why they worship a totem pole or
[46:38] an animal or this or that or the other
[46:40] or how some kind of a thing it's because
[46:43] of the desire that's within their soul
[46:45] not just in the body and spirit that
[46:49] just passes go to the n-word part of man
[46:54] go to the soul and talk to the soul I
[46:57] don't like to talk to bodies I don't
[46:59] like to talk to spirits cuz you said
[47:02] turn deceive me you shaky head
[47:04] yes and the heart you're gonna know I
[47:07] don't know what's going on in you when
[47:09] I'm breaching but if I see a constant
[47:13] development in the word and a change
[47:15] coming into the person then I say okay
[47:18] it's working let's see we just like all
[47:23] of the rest what is it to be safe I
[47:25] shout that spoken time to cry come on
[47:32] that's outward effect outward effect
[47:37] then I'll quote brother Branham did he
[47:40] say this he said if you need healing or
[47:43] something
[47:43] he said if you stand up and start this
[47:45] way he said now I'm paraphrasing it so
[47:47] it's close he said the biggest portion
[47:49] of the things over because he said you
[47:51] made up your mind back to her you just
[47:55] come in down here to be prayed for he
[47:57] said you made up your mind back to her
[47:59] what was it with a man it picked up the
[48:01] foot track and ready where will you
[48:03] spend eternity something started right
[48:06] there from work the brain no body no
[48:13] spirit no from that soul what is the
[48:18] soul of man that's what you are that's
[48:24] that part that's within you and brother
[48:27] innocent souls in prison he said that's
[48:29] the part that God is working home look
[48:33] into the soul he's not working into your
[48:37] head in your body
[48:38] let it come from the inside out
[48:42] he's working on that soul that's within
[48:46] you and that's why David look at him
[48:51] David said my soul thirsteth he didn't
[48:54] say my body he didn't say my spirit
[48:58] because he knew and both of them he had
[49:00] problems he said my soul thirsteth after
[49:05] the old God you know what brother run
[49:07] said he needed the baptism of the holy
[49:10] God was right he needed something to
[49:12] come and change that nature part that
[49:15] was within him
[49:16] because he was a sinner by Nature
[49:19] we're all sinners by nature and in that
[49:24] soul mankind is made to certain thirst
[49:29] after God he does it by you know serving
[49:34] and doing everything he work itself to
[49:36] death and well do I remember that coming
[49:40] up through the Baptist and well I do
[49:42] everything just like I do here if you
[49:45] need something to be done I'll go do it
[49:48] well because that's just always been a
[49:50] part of my desire you don't see me
[49:54] standing back well we need to go do
[49:57] something I just get up and go do it
[50:01] didn't think we're saying well if you
[50:03] hadn't got up went do it well you didn't
[50:04] get up and go do it for what you said up
[50:07] we'll talk about somebody else
[50:09] all right but listen salvation is in the
[50:13] soul of man it's not in your body in
[50:16] your spirit
[50:16] that's an outward of fact that's why
[50:21] within your soul the new birth is the
[50:24] birth of the world when that's trying to
[50:26] get over Wednesday then you shout then
[50:28] you cry then you speak in tongues then
[50:32] you have the great that was an
[50:36] aftereffect I got the new birth code I
[50:39] spoke in tongues I shouted I cried I
[50:41] felt this feeling amen praise God but
[50:47] did something happen on the inside the
[50:56] salvation is in the soul if that soul
[51:01] don't cry out to God then it's not gonna
[51:04] have any fact that's why Jesus knew what
[51:08] he was talking about when he said it no
[51:10] man can come to the Father but by me you
[51:20] see the people coming to the hour you
[51:21] see them coming in and do it
[51:23] but you see them the next time they're
[51:24] doing the same thing again
[51:27] you'll write back they'll do the same
[51:30] things again or you know and there's
[51:37] word you're wrong
[51:38] you think I'm against emotion sometime
[51:43] but you see you get people to the alter
[51:46] by emotions you're gonna get them the
[51:49] next time by emotion because all you're
[51:54] dealing with on emotion is a body in the
[51:56] spirit of an individual if I don't ask
[52:05] raise a hand on but how many of you
[52:07] believe the new birth is of Earth of the
[52:09] word I did if it's the birth of the word
[52:15] the births in the soul it's not in the
[52:18] body and spirit so it's the word the
[52:21] disciples took inhaled and they had an
[52:25] understanding the Bible says of it that
[52:28] Jesus explained the parables of the
[52:30] kingdom etc and the thing the sowing of
[52:33] the sea he explained all of that and
[52:35] these easy was explaining it see they
[52:39] were getting a knowledge of what they
[52:43] needed and what they needed was the Holy
[52:45] Ghost that fell under that Pentecost to
[52:47] quicken that that they had heard but are
[52:51] you understanding then three and a half
[52:52] years of what they heard but the other
[52:55] group only got one message I say one
[53:00] message come on folks those people
[53:02] around our to heard about Jesus and is
[53:04] that in the other but yet one message is
[53:09] all they heard but they accepted Jesus
[53:13] Christ and he accepted them he said what
[53:19] did they do they went through now listen
[53:21] this is what I've been trying to get
[53:22] across to you the new birth is
[53:24] justification same thing a baptism will
[53:26] hold ago the Prophet said he always
[53:28] talked in three stages justifications
[53:32] not the new birth sanctification is not
[53:34] the new work the baptism of the Holy
[53:36] Ghost is the new birth but you must be
[53:39] justified
[53:40] sanctified before you can be born again
[53:43] so then those people right there that
[53:47] day and so it's the house of Canisius
[53:50] you know cause you go right on them they
[53:53] heard one sermon and right there at one
[53:55] time they went through justification
[53:57] sanctification and the baptism of the
[54:00] Holy Ghost got it that one time you said
[54:07] well why don't it happen today look at
[54:09] brother Branham as an example
[54:14] come on Billy Graham went to all of
[54:18] those places and he couldn't get one
[54:19] convert come on the random went and
[54:26] showing the signs and wonders of an
[54:29] Almighty God the preaching of the word
[54:32] brought thirty thousand blanket ladies
[54:38] to Jesus Christ
[54:41] well they only got see that's you're
[54:43] making it now you say well they got
[54:47] justified are you making that that's
[54:49] your plans I'm saying what he said he
[54:54] said they accepted Jesus Christ and he
[54:56] said they acted the same way you acted
[55:01] when you got the baptism of the Holy
[55:03] Ghost come on do you see what I'm trying
[55:10] to get across to all of us what is the
[55:13] new birth it's the birth of the word
[55:14] yeah but that what you mean I just read
[55:17] it no it's when that word is made alive
[55:19] then you'll shout then you'll cry then
[55:23] you'll scream out to God and glory
[55:25] hallelujah and have a wonderful time why
[55:29] because the word has been made alive to
[55:32] you and you got something anchored that
[55:36] Satan can't get away from I mean can't
[55:39] get it away from you but he can get it
[55:41] away from that body in that spirit see
[55:45] salvation is in the soul of mankind all
[55:50] right
[55:51] see the
[55:52] why the preaching of the gospel what did
[55:56] the prophets say he said true prophets
[55:58] bring true burros
[55:59] he said false prophets rain falls first
[56:06] what see instead of listening to that
[56:08] and understanding and just accepting it
[56:10] well true prophets that there's only one
[56:13] true prophet but it rhymes only true
[56:14] prophet
[56:14] so he's the only one that can get a
[56:15] birth see you tell me the devil don't
[56:19] get in your mind and try to run around
[56:22] all of those things all over in that
[56:24] spirit being part of you you see why
[56:33] it's so hard to preach the truth you see
[56:36] why the new birth is the hardest thing
[56:38] to preach but to get people to realize
[56:44] first off you got to be saved
[56:49] alright but that's got to be from an
[56:53] inward part of you that's why I'm coming
[56:57] to church and doing brings you under an
[57:00] atmosphere Sunday School the teachings
[57:05] of little bitty ones coming up they're
[57:09] getting under an atmosphere sister Gail
[57:13] asked me when we started a Sunday School
[57:15] class years ago said what do you want me
[57:17] to teach them children
[57:18] I said teach them children one day got
[57:21] to be saved but I said teach them that
[57:24] the God that was with David and had a
[57:27] sling and took down a John and a bar you
[57:30] know that they can take what's in their
[57:32] heart so love them and they can tackle
[57:35] that same devil what if we'd been taught
[57:39] that all the way down no what have we
[57:41] been taught come to the altar you accept
[57:44] Jesus Christ as your Savior you believe
[57:45] Jesus died for you
[57:47] then little kid don't even know what's
[57:49] going on come on
[57:57] you were there or do like I said see I
[58:03] was 18 years old my sister came to them
[58:07] in the church and she started telling me
[58:12] she said you you know that my husband he
[58:17] died the car wreck you know he's lost he
[58:21] said he didn't have an opportunity which
[58:23] you got an opportunity well you know
[58:25] what I'm standing there thinking hey he
[58:28] got a better opportunity then you got I
[58:32] thought as much of his Christianity as I
[58:35] thought of hers when I've heard her tell
[58:38] it and I believe it that she had many
[58:41] times prayed and felt the very lags of
[58:43] the Lord Jesus and held on to him she
[58:47] was a spiritual woman in that formed of
[58:48] things but I thought as much of his
[58:51] salvation as I did of hers well because
[58:55] I'll live with them
[58:57] right but you see church back dark I
[59:01] just didn't have nobody to help me to
[59:04] try to find the truth that's what I'm
[59:07] talking about what's the truth now are
[59:09] we getting them as the Prophet said to
[59:11] Christ are getting them to a doctor or
[59:13] an idea he said what brother Dale you're
[59:23] just not emotional we need to get to
[59:25] people emotional get them born again
[59:27] they'll be emotional so what are we
[59:33] working on getting them emotional or
[59:37] getting them born again all right if you
[59:41] believe it that the new birth is a burst
[59:45] of the word then the whole statue of a
[59:48] perfect man is being born again until
[59:51] the headstone comes it'll be the opening
[59:55] of the word there's a new birth your new
[1:00:00] birth is the opening of the word making
[1:00:03] you a child of God
[1:00:08] let's see if we make it as to be some
[1:00:09] emotional thing we got to do and come on
[1:00:12] church I believe in every bit of it when
[1:00:16] God deals with you you're going to be
[1:00:18] emotional you're going to cry you're
[1:00:21] going to shout you're going to be happy
[1:00:24] don't lose that well I just don't
[1:00:28] understand it cuz brother do you say
[1:00:30] that the new birth of birth of the word
[1:00:34] well I didn't say that the Prophet did
[1:00:37] was still well I thought it had to have
[1:00:43] some form of emotion with it may I'll
[1:00:46] quote the Prophet a stillborn baby is a
[1:00:51] dead baby paraphrasing it right you get
[1:00:55] it
[1:00:56] stillborn baby is a dead baby so we
[1:01:02] think that we've got this that no it's
[1:01:04] the birth of the word what if the church
[1:01:09] is edit out that to us what did they
[1:01:14] teach you will get them to do this get
[1:01:18] them to do that get them to go here you
[1:01:19] don't go there get them there get this
[1:01:21] time we'll get that to happen now how
[1:01:27] did that work on the Deaf Pentecost when
[1:01:29] 3,000 people never got to go through all
[1:01:32] these time and it's a house of canoe you
[1:01:35] say they can get to go through the I'm
[1:01:37] using those quarters in the Bible right
[1:01:42] what happened they heard one sermon and
[1:01:46] become saved but you know what happened
[1:01:54] Satan took away then the knowledge of
[1:01:57] that and substituted feelings and signs
[1:02:06] and wonders and sits you know
[1:02:09] stimulations and all kind of thing you
[1:02:13] got to do this God do that gonna do this
[1:02:14] I think gonna get to even of the note so
[1:02:17] we're forgetting when I will quote one
[1:02:19] time brother Branham says there's no
[1:02:21] work in the Bible that it ever said are
[1:02:27] you speaking in tongues was the baptism
[1:02:30] of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:35] speaking in tongue but you know what it
[1:02:39] says every Church age that was what he
[1:02:45] was emphasizing there's no word in the
[1:02:47] church ages that it tells you this is
[1:02:49] speaking in tongues as evidence for Emma
[1:02:51] but you know ever church age has the
[1:02:54] same message to it you know what it says
[1:02:59] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:03:04] the spirit saith every church age read
[1:03:09] it every church age has got the same
[1:03:14] talk to it I just checked him while ago
[1:03:17] it's in there go read it will you
[1:03:21] realize what he's saying there's no word
[1:03:23] it said it and that's why I've always
[1:03:25] said it this is not the mystery as to
[1:03:29] the speaking in tongues it's the mystery
[1:03:32] of the hearing the hearing has always
[1:03:36] been the mystery how hear we ever man in
[1:03:43] her own tongue naming all the people of
[1:03:48] the nations we yet they were here in one
[1:03:51] language oh but we good Baptists we had
[1:03:54] it figured out it was about eight
[1:03:56] nations there and we had it figured out
[1:03:58] it Peter was talking in seven was
[1:04:00] interpreting you ever heard that one we
[1:04:06] had that figured out well that ain't no
[1:04:07] problem they just had seven interpreters
[1:04:10] and Peter was talking it doesn't say
[1:04:12] that said how here we ever man in our
[1:04:15] own tongue wherein
[1:04:17] were born the mystery has never been in
[1:04:21] the speaking the mystery has been always
[1:04:23] been in the hearing well the mysteries
[1:04:28] not in - shouting - crying - speaking of
[1:04:30] the the mystery is - hearing once you
[1:04:36] hear you have plenty to shout about if
[1:04:41] not you got a dead baby come on I'm far
[1:04:46] all emotional things but I'm for the
[1:04:49] word first get on know what to shout
[1:04:52] about there's no mystery in hearing I
[1:04:57] mean in speaking the mysteries in
[1:05:00] hearing and letting that word be made
[1:05:04] alive into your heart because that comes
[1:05:10] out words in salvation is in the soul of
[1:05:14] mankind it's not in your body in your
[1:05:16] spirit that's an outward working way to
[1:05:21] get you understand what I'm saying when
[1:05:23] it's trying to get across with see every
[1:05:25] person that's born into the world
[1:05:28] according to the Prophet you say well
[1:05:30] okay I just quote him every person he
[1:05:35] said was born with that desire to serve
[1:05:38] God he said we answered it by what we
[1:05:43] were doing of totem poles and animals
[1:05:46] and this and that and that's why I read
[1:05:49] that over and there and emphasized that
[1:05:52] Peter was saying it's not flesh it's not
[1:05:55] this that the other not silver and gold
[1:05:57] you're not regained by those things
[1:06:00] you're not redeemed by your doings in
[1:06:02] what's taking place you redeemed by the
[1:06:03] blood of Jesus Christ let's see you get
[1:06:13] the idea that I'm against this and I'm
[1:06:15] against that I'm for everything that God
[1:06:18] has got there I want it in the right
[1:06:21] order
[1:06:25] yeah that's why you come to me and you
[1:06:28] said brother Dale do you think I'm saved
[1:06:29] I can't answer that
[1:06:31] I can't answer that question you're the
[1:06:37] one that's gotta answer that question
[1:06:41] you're the one that's gotta know whether
[1:06:43] you're saved or not but do you know and
[1:06:46] do you understand what I'm talking about
[1:06:50] it's you're sitting in a church maybe
[1:06:53] somebody preaching now you tell me these
[1:06:57] well you got to be preaching on this
[1:06:58] country's don't have this no brother
[1:07:01] branham would be standing there
[1:07:02] preaching and preaching the deepest
[1:07:05] message using you ever thought and the
[1:07:08] altars would be full of people seeking
[1:07:10] after God I've tried to explain it to
[1:07:17] you and you don't listen but how is it
[1:07:20] God reveals something to you be setting
[1:07:23] in the preachers preaching on on some
[1:07:25] you know the predestination or something
[1:07:28] and all at once right in the middle of
[1:07:30] it something inside of you says that's
[1:07:36] why I got saved like sister Gail don't
[1:07:41] mind me been with her where she tried to
[1:07:43] figure it out try to do this that in the
[1:07:45] other word it didn't work within one day
[1:07:47] standing in the kitchen or somewhere in
[1:07:49] all at once was this that's one God well
[1:07:54] brother Gary Atkins he used to we used
[1:07:56] to talk day-in day-out about the new
[1:07:59] birth I said brother Gary you're trying
[1:08:01] your best to figure it out and I said
[1:08:03] it'll never work
[1:08:05] you're talking about a man that was
[1:08:07] living good doing right and tried to do
[1:08:09] everything he could right I said that's
[1:08:12] not it brother Gary I said just leave it
[1:08:15] alone I think you're trying to figure it
[1:08:18] out you're trying to find out what it is
[1:08:21] leave it alone he'll come to you one day
[1:08:26] he called me from we used to talk about
[1:08:28] the i-20 Battle of Armageddon you know
[1:08:33] because he's always riding at i-20 going
[1:08:35] to Alabama back on his
[1:08:36] he called me he said brother Dale it's
[1:08:38] over what I didn't have to worry about I
[1:08:40] need what he's talking about he's now to
[1:08:42] explain to me what took blood I knew
[1:08:44] what he's talking about see God had come
[1:08:46] to him and spoke to him with the only
[1:08:51] way he could speak to him was from what
[1:08:53] he had already heard faith cometh by
[1:08:57] hearing that's why it takes God to
[1:09:01] condemn you of your sins especially now
[1:09:05] you young children you think about it
[1:09:07] and you're saying well well I'm doing
[1:09:09] this wrong I'm doing this wrong I
[1:09:10] shouldn't be doing that
[1:09:11] that can be God dealing with you to get
[1:09:14] you to come to repentance come to
[1:09:16] salvation but then here's were they're
[1:09:23] always I've never taught it no other way
[1:09:27] than this if you are genuine of God
[1:09:31] dealing with you he'll keep dealing with
[1:09:34] you he won't stop he'll keep dealing
[1:09:39] with you because he that started a good
[1:09:41] work in you is willing to take you
[1:09:44] through that's our phrasing was right
[1:09:46] right see salvation then it's coming
[1:09:52] from that inward part of you that makes
[1:09:56] you realize that you are a creation and
[1:10:00] that for being a creation means they've
[1:10:03] got to be a creator that created that
[1:10:07] creation and then that means that that's
[1:10:10] what's drawing you is that part of you
[1:10:14] that's why I see brother Branham could
[1:10:18] preach those people didn't know what he
[1:10:20] was talking about probably physically in
[1:10:22] his wordings on a lot of it but when he
[1:10:25] began to tell him about Jesus Christ
[1:10:27] he said these Michener's has told you
[1:10:29] about this they've explained these
[1:10:31] things to you but said none of you come
[1:10:39] come on he asked for the girl that was
[1:10:42] there how many of you been they had one
[1:10:43] person they'd been over years you know
[1:10:45] to the country but then when he kept
[1:10:48] talking about God that Leo is still
[1:10:52] living God that's real something within
[1:10:55] their heart begins to long for that and
[1:11:01] when he did he says now to prove it he
[1:11:04] said let God come and God came and
[1:11:09] healed a man and done these different
[1:11:11] tonight
[1:11:11] thirty thousand blanket ladies come to
[1:11:15] Jesus Christ okay but listen jerk do you
[1:11:21] understand what I'm getting and what I'm
[1:11:23] trying to get at Wednesday night we
[1:11:25] talked to the children about salvation
[1:11:27] but what does they understand and I
[1:11:34] remember when we was over and I won't
[1:11:37] say was at a certain place one time and
[1:11:39] all these kids doctor you know there's a
[1:11:41] whole bunch of little kids rent her this
[1:11:42] one little boy he was up on this
[1:11:44] platform and boy he was just telling I'm
[1:11:46] off he was a preaching like everything
[1:11:48] and you know what he was preaching about
[1:11:50] he said y'all remember when we're back
[1:11:53] in Pentecost he's about ten years old
[1:11:59] y'all remember when we're back in
[1:12:01] Pentecost why because that's what the
[1:12:03] preacher preached y'all remember when
[1:12:05] we're back in Pentecost
[1:12:07] come on jerk get serious about our own
[1:12:13] matters of everything and realize God
[1:12:17] must deal with you as an individual
[1:12:20] that's that soul that he's dealing with
[1:12:23] you about trying to contact you and
[1:12:26] getting you to the place of your saying
[1:12:27] well Lord I'm sorry for what I've done
[1:12:29] and forgive me and then he begins to
[1:12:32] work in you of driving out that things
[1:12:36] that's bothering you
[1:12:37] we're out of the soul sanctification
[1:12:42] then comes in it's cleansing that soul
[1:12:45] burning it out and you
[1:12:49] even getting you desired new natures new
[1:12:52] things and you just have repented of
[1:12:55] your sins you become a cleanse to living
[1:12:59] by sanctification and you think you've
[1:13:01] got it the one way that I know whether
[1:13:05] I've got it or not is one time whatever
[1:13:08] got me has never stopped wanting me to
[1:13:12] seek after healing now that's a funny
[1:13:15] way maybe of saying it but whatever
[1:13:17] whatever contacted me when I was back
[1:13:20] there at ten years old I remember that I
[1:13:23] tried to explain that to people I've
[1:13:26] even tried to explain it in the people
[1:13:28] of this message when we come in he saw
[1:13:31] it I mean yeah what are you trying to
[1:13:35] you what you trying to be I don't try to
[1:13:36] be many more you but you see I can
[1:13:43] remember I've always told you try to be
[1:13:45] truthful to you that as a sinner I'd go
[1:13:48] out and do wrong then when I got a quiet
[1:13:52] moment those things would come up and
[1:13:57] I'd say Lord I'm sorry and I saw too
[1:14:03] much of the world of the people that's
[1:14:06] why I was 18 years old for it even
[1:14:07] accept Jesus Christ in the Baptist
[1:14:09] Church because I saw too much wrong with
[1:14:17] people that claim to be Christians when
[1:14:19] I realized they were something wrong
[1:14:20] because I was a sinner and didn't do
[1:14:23] that that's the church what are we doing
[1:14:31] what are we teaching our children what
[1:14:34] are we trying to bring salvation as a
[1:14:35] what not to get you to quit and don't do
[1:14:39] getting you to accept Jesus Christ and
[1:14:43] let Jesus Christ come within you and
[1:14:46] start working back out and cleansing you
[1:14:50] and driving out that unclean spirit and
[1:14:53] then putting the word into there into
[1:14:56] the soul not in the head in the by you
[1:14:58] know spirit into the soul bringing that
[1:15:00] word in the Darr into
[1:15:03] being as an N we're being as our
[1:15:05] thoughts and ideas and letting that keep
[1:15:07] that clean
[1:15:08] I don't even count the time in the
[1:15:14] Baptist Church when 18 years old up but
[1:15:16] I count it when I come in this message
[1:15:18] that everybody says oh you got it you
[1:15:21] got it you believe the message I could
[1:15:24] quote around them hold up better than I
[1:15:26] can today because that's all I done was
[1:15:29] read and studied right but you know what
[1:15:37] I realized I wouldn't born again how
[1:15:41] many of you ever ever realized that
[1:15:43] you're lost you know if you can't
[1:15:46] realize you're lost you can never be
[1:15:47] saved I mean you're out in the woods
[1:15:50] y'all are by yourself then you look
[1:15:54] around and you say I ain't lost I know
[1:15:57] right where I'm at yeah have you ever
[1:16:04] realized she's lost because only the
[1:16:09] word that can God help you and that's
[1:16:15] why the preaching of the word is so
[1:16:16] important that's why brother Branham to
[1:16:22] me when he got over into the life part
[1:16:25] of the seal that either in questions and
[1:16:27] answers or it's in the seventh seal he
[1:16:29] said going with the same simple message
[1:16:31] he said cause if you don't you work your
[1:16:33] way from work yourself away from it
[1:16:36] what's the same simple message when he's
[1:16:40] preaching across the mystery of God
[1:16:41] revealed after the opening of the seals
[1:16:43] that ties the entire Bible together
[1:16:44] right the one great message that ties
[1:16:47] everything together what did he teach
[1:16:49] the new birth he gets the invisible
[1:16:56] Union a great message on later why did
[1:16:58] he free the new birth
[1:17:01] what was he teaching all the way through
[1:17:04] the new birth what is the seals in the
[1:17:08] time the new birth
[1:17:17] see do we see it correctly into that are
[1:17:20] we trying to teach some other way the
[1:17:26] run says we're not getting them to
[1:17:28] Christ we're getting into a doctrine or
[1:17:29] an idea when do you believe the message
[1:17:33] yeah I believe the message
[1:17:34] well you must be saved in if it's in the
[1:17:42] body in the spirit there's no salvation
[1:17:44] - if it's coming from the inside we'll
[1:17:49] get to that we're brother Branham says
[1:17:50] these virtues everything works from the
[1:17:52] inside out right comes from the inside
[1:17:59] out
[1:18:00] so you got to gets what's right on the
[1:18:03] inside right and why was Jesus's first
[1:18:10] doctrine not the seals of the plagues or
[1:18:13] the vials of this without of the other
[1:18:14] what was his first doctrine though you
[1:18:17] must be born again because he knew there
[1:18:19] was no hope whatsoever of mankind
[1:18:21] without coming to an end word experience
[1:18:23] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it
[1:18:26] took him three and a half years to
[1:18:29] preach it enough that he finally would
[1:18:32] say do you now believe after all the
[1:18:44] years and the dead raised the sick
[1:18:45] healed and all the best you could say do
[1:18:47] you now believe well boy that's great
[1:18:51] believers yeah they were they run like a
[1:18:53] bunch of chickens when it comes to the
[1:18:55] time to meet the master in the garden
[1:18:57] right when they come in to capture him
[1:19:00] they all run even the great Peter
[1:19:03] I'll stay with me no matter what he said
[1:19:05] Peter you'll deny me three times for
[1:19:07] that crock rose or something to that
[1:19:09] degree
[1:19:09] he said you're oh I won't deny you he
[1:19:14] did that's why I like the Bible like it
[1:19:21] says you know it says when he told him
[1:19:23] when with our when he'd raised he said
[1:19:25] go tell my disciples
[1:19:27] and Peter he wanted Peter to know for
[1:19:33] certain that everything was alright but
[1:19:38] yet that he needed some more than what
[1:19:40] he had because he didn't have enough to
[1:19:42] carry him through right she don't ever
[1:19:47] stop seeking God I have never all of my
[1:19:52] life
[1:19:53] stop seeking after God ever prayer pray
[1:19:56] God to help me save me from myself I
[1:20:04] ain't gonna ask you to save me cuz I'm
[1:20:07] already saved and if I deny that I'm
[1:20:09] saved Old Glory with good Baptist I face
[1:20:13] that then was against it if you got it
[1:20:18] you don't have to worry about nobody
[1:20:19] putting it to the test but if you ain't
[1:20:22] got it you you don't want to be put to
[1:20:24] no test what do you understand what I'm
[1:20:27] getting at Wednesday night oh look this
[1:20:29] guy wanted that dog to come to where we
[1:20:32] could see that to just say what is the
[1:20:35] new work just going shameful in baptism
[1:20:37] I'll go well what is anyway so where's
[1:20:38] the word well what do you mean the birth
[1:20:42] of the word see they took the word and
[1:20:49] held it long enough until it did at
[1:20:52] least run that unclean thing out of them
[1:20:59] don't you ever think that you're gonna
[1:21:01] get rid of the devil either because you
[1:21:04] better read the future home you better
[1:21:08] get into the right studies you talk
[1:21:10] about the unclean spirit being driven
[1:21:11] out of a man
[1:21:13] what are you actress driven out oh I'm
[1:21:18] an empty vessel
[1:21:19] huh you better get something in place
[1:21:23] now because if you don't that old Devils
[1:21:26] coming back you ain't gonna be empty
[1:21:28] very long right and even all of them
[1:21:33] things you better be careful cuz the
[1:21:35] artists where you're anointed ones can
[1:21:37] come into being in a hurry because
[1:21:40] they're the
[1:21:41] the other right they cut out all the
[1:21:43] things right mm-hmm
[1:21:48] but they don't have the new bar what
[1:21:52] about having all of that having your
[1:21:54] spirit or knowing it with the Holy
[1:21:55] Spirit one set of genuine yeah brother
[1:22:10] Dale hey I've seen this I've seen that
[1:22:12] praise God Matt whoa Paul he said have
[1:22:19] you received the Holy Ghost
[1:22:21] hence I believe that's that ought to be
[1:22:24] preached a lot on Ryan have you received
[1:22:26] the Holy Ghost since you believed well I
[1:22:28] got it when I believed have you received
[1:22:30] it since you believe I like one
[1:22:33] scripture never have got around to
[1:22:35] preach on it but it says and we'll get
[1:22:37] on the statute permit since you shall
[1:22:39] receive power what after the Holy Ghost
[1:22:46] is come upon you so we go power that's
[1:22:50] why I said reducer power power power
[1:22:53] power power power after the Holy Ghost
[1:22:55] has come upon you strength
[1:22:58] serving God but I got it over to bleed
[1:23:03] yeah come on brothers now I'm still
[1:23:11] trying my best to get us to see what is
[1:23:15] the new birth yeah but brother where you
[1:23:20] gonna put it on the prophet said that
[1:23:22] Holy Ghost in every age and he said
[1:23:27] every age is the age of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:31] and he said ever born-again believer has
[1:23:36] the same evidence now where are you
[1:23:39] gonna put it you said well brother Dale
[1:23:41] we never heard until we come into the
[1:23:44] message and collect loool especially
[1:23:46] that the verse is the birth of you know
[1:23:48] the new birth birds are learned though
[1:23:50] we always thought it was II thought it
[1:23:51] was Aldo
[1:23:52] what does that make it wrong I didn't
[1:23:54] for months all the profits who want have
[1:23:57] done it the new birth is a birth through
[1:24:01] the word he said what we give it to
[1:24:03] other night God showed the word and he
[1:24:07] said the Holy Ghost irrigated it right
[1:24:13] having the word sewn down is good but
[1:24:17] it's got to be quickened or it's no more
[1:24:20] than a dead letter right what about it
[1:24:25] Church do we realize what really the new
[1:24:29] birth is now watch what it would be its
[1:24:33] if the evidence of the Holy Ghost was
[1:24:35] speaking in tongues what would be the
[1:24:36] evidence of the headstone would be
[1:24:41] speaking in tone do you understand you
[1:24:47] understand one of that prophet I was
[1:24:49] quoting him one ago that it never says
[1:24:54] to any age he that speaks in tongue but
[1:25:01] it says to every age he that hath an ear
[1:25:04] let him hear what the spirit saith the
[1:25:10] evidence has always been in the hearing
[1:25:14] but do we believe it that away well
[1:25:18] you're against me code I told you that
[1:25:20] that when I received the Holy Ghost I
[1:25:22] cried praise God they've got to be
[1:25:26] something or you got a dead baby right I
[1:25:32] believe in experiences I believe it all
[1:25:37] of the him because you're dead if you
[1:25:40] don't have them but I don't believe in
[1:25:43] that first I believe in the birth and
[1:25:46] then the evidences sometimes that we go
[1:25:48] with it come on if you're just going to
[1:25:51] say that this evidences believing to
[1:25:53] work you'd have to get born again for
