[0:01] [Applause]
[0:04] okay fine
[0:08] good morning again good to have the
[0:11] Trent singing the girls will go all the
[0:18] way from Jamaica to get here so much
[0:19] here it's good to have them with us
[0:25] they'll be here with a little wild yeah
[0:32] amen to that anyway all right there we
[0:34] go so now firstly in Chapter 12 we were
[0:38] looking after the great chapter in
[0:40] Hebrews 11 the faith chapter then we go
[0:42] to equal to 12
[0:43] last Sunday were talking about Hebrews
[0:45] 12 and there were yet once more signify
[0:48] the removing of those things that are
[0:49] shaken and the things that are made that
[0:51] those things cannot be shaken may remain
[0:54] and remember what we're talking about
[0:56] here and I was listening to the tape
[1:01] coming home to the other day of Illinois
[1:03] and brother ground was talking about
[1:05] this he said God's not only helpful in
[1:06] the future home he says I shaved out in
[1:09] the earth only but also the heaven so
[1:11] he's going to show you both them and
[1:12] enter in this end time right he's going
[1:15] to shake it off but if the things which
[1:18] cannot be shaken may remain but the old
[1:20] thing can't be shaking the gun the
[1:22] baptism the Holy Ghost a new birth we'd
[1:27] be afraid of many things but listen we
[1:29] got to come to a place to where it's
[1:31] settled in our salt and they might you
[1:34] know the world makes shaken tumble and
[1:37] rattle and roll but you still gotta have
[1:40] an anchor and you gotta know that God's
[1:42] in control but you won't even control
[1:46] here first Hebrews 11 that great faith
[1:49] chapter but remember we were talking
[1:51] about when we come
[1:53] look things that are shaken of what have
[1:55] no foundation things that are shaken the
[1:58] most of zero foundation to it all right
[2:01] but the thing to have foundation cannot
[2:02] be shaken because the faith like they'll
[2:06] come back faith does that foundation
[2:08] look down wide it is you've got to have
[2:10] a lot of faith that have cost as much
[2:12] space as we do growth economist but you
[2:14] don't have faith you forget about the
[2:15] kindness so where for we receive a
[2:20] kingdom which cannot be moved right well
[2:23] we know where's the kingdom of God it's
[2:24] not up in heaven it's in you you are the
[2:28] kingdom of heaven you're the kingdom of
[2:30] God let us have grace whereby we may
[2:33] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[2:36] godly fear for our God is a consuming
[2:38] fire and then also we know that Paul
[2:40] continues his writing is just a complete
[2:43] letter it's not a chapter 2 Paul man put
[2:47] these chapters in here so he's continued
[2:49] this thought let brotherly love continue
[2:54] we've told you many times they asked
[2:57] Jesus what was the greatest commandment
[2:59] he said love the Lord God with all your
[3:02] heart and love your neighbor as you love
[3:03] yourself those are the two greatest
[3:05] Commandments for a while you gotta love
[3:07] your brother just as much your brother
[3:09] not you not your brother I don't know
[3:10] about you got to let your neighbor
[3:12] Jesus says okay you love your brother
[3:15] but can you love your neighbor that may
[3:18] persecute you that like I said my two
[3:20] neighbors or dead guys and you know
[3:23] maybe that's part of what you gotta do
[3:25] you got to love them as much as you love
[3:26] you stop that hurts but still you you
[3:29] got to do that that's why I'm growing
[3:30] all the time this is way up there you
[3:32] got to get all these birches working in
[3:35] a lot before you come brother kindness
[3:37] because I'll guarantee you I can tell
[3:41] you who you like and who you don't like
[3:43] this food everybody in this congregation
[3:46] I can tell you who you like it knew you
[3:48] don't like but remember what Billy Paul
[3:50] said about brother around
[3:51] he said I did not know who the enemies
[3:53] were and I did not are its friends and
[3:56] enemies he treated exactly the same all
[3:59] right so that's what we got to come to
[4:01] and brother day left cover some of that
[4:03] you know about check your hands and and
[4:05] greeting people and being coordinate
[4:07] friendly because you gotta remember that
[4:11] let's stay on brother without for just a
[4:12] minute because brotherly love is not
[4:14] well I just love to be around that
[4:16] person know that ain't I'm gonna find
[4:20] that quote we're brother Brown said that
[4:22] you can have the baptism the Holy Ghost
[4:24] two brothers and can't stand to be in
[4:26] the same room together that's just
[4:27] personality that's humanity but when he
[4:32] comes to the Word of God you should be
[4:35] able to sitting all that time all day
[4:36] even if you barely disagreed you're
[4:39] supposed to love you brother
[4:40] alright that's a problem we come to a
[4:42] bitter disagreement and then we go glam
[4:45] up anything to do with em come on that
[4:46] well you're wrong according to that
[4:49] right there brotherly love is you love
[4:51] the person as you love yourself hard to
[4:55] do that's why says right they are
[4:56] knocked down here right but that
[5:00] brotherly love continue you know when I
[5:04] was doing the statute was perfect man
[5:06] when I got into brotherly love I read
[5:08] all the quotes for brother Brown was
[5:09] talking about what was brotherly love
[5:10] easy you go back to the Bible were you
[5:13] looking to book of Acts when they had
[5:14] all things coming they brought all their
[5:17] possessions they brought all their
[5:19] property but they brought all their
[5:21] money into a central location and Peter
[5:23] James and all them distributed the funds
[5:26] to everybody the Bible says they had all
[5:29] things common well remember I told you
[5:32] when I was standing upstairs I said
[5:34] y'all ready to do that you ready to
[5:38] bring me a brother nail all your money
[5:39] and get I'll tell you cars you talk to
[5:41] your house
[5:42] the tower that you landed all your money
[5:45] and they let us distribute it out so yet
[5:49] some people some people submit under the
[5:52] seat some people do you know so we're
[5:55] not going to do that though that was the
[5:56] time that they were distributing if
[5:58] you'll keep reading the quote brother
[6:00] Brown said that's what they were
[6:01] distributing the gospel and they needed
[6:03] to do that so it's really all bad idea
[6:07] but you'd like to I mean that's social
[6:11] reform and that just don't work that's
[6:14] socialism and that's I don't believe in
[6:17] that but if you do it with a cheerful
[6:19] heart if you do it out of love that
[6:20] makes a big difference all right be not
[6:24] forgetful to entertain strangers
[6:25] remember we were touched on this last
[6:27] Sunday for a minute for thereby some
[6:29] have entertained angels unawares we just
[6:33] don't know what's going on in this
[6:34] faster dimension this other dimension
[6:35] that's out here that we believe there's
[6:38] other dimensions brother Brown said God
[6:40] give you an angel at birth all believers
[6:41] have angels
[6:42] all right and the Bible says the angel
[6:44] of the lord encamps about those that
[6:47] believe or in other words the ones that
[6:49] are that are warning him because you
[6:52] know what the devil's got his eye on you
[6:53] any guys I won't cross you I already got
[6:58] her she's not born again with the one
[6:59] through the horn again it's that power
[7:01] that he felt when he touched talk to
[7:04] Jesus back in 2000 years ago that same
[7:07] power is inside of you if it is you've
[7:10] got a demo gun
[7:11] so when Satan comes up against you they
[7:14] ought to be able to feel something
[7:16] different now remember brother rod said
[7:18] if they can get you you went out to him
[7:22] he didn't get to come in your house cuz
[7:25] as we were reading the other day and
[7:27] brother Tim Tims
[7:29] the unclean spirit goes out of a man
[7:31] walks in dark places the unclean
[7:33] goes out but then he says I'm gonna come
[7:36] back to my house you read about saying
[7:38] says I will come back to my house in
[7:40] other words he came back to his house
[7:42] and found his weapon garnished and it
[7:44] was empty well if you fill it with the
[7:45] Holy Ghost he surely is not gonna come
[7:47] back in he's gonna try but he's not
[7:50] gonna come back in but if you don't get
[7:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you
[7:53] could all that jump run out of you it's
[7:54] gonna come back it's gonna come
[7:56] backwards it's gonna make you think you
[7:58] got something that you don't know but
[8:00] those who endure the end well my little
[8:02] baby into this thing if when we'll see
[8:06] we'll see the end or the culmination of
[8:09] this thing is who's going to stand into
[8:11] one because something's gonna you
[8:12] gonna be shoved don't worry to read that
[8:14] you're gonna be shook if Heaven consists
[8:17] of the word then the words going to be
[8:18] sure in you somebody's going to come
[8:21] with a false doctrine somebody's gonna
[8:23] come with an angle with this with an
[8:24] angle with that whatever it is whatever
[8:26] it might be and
[8:30] [Music]
[8:34] yes and then say you got that's not the
[8:39] worst deception worst deception is
[8:41] what's going on up north so I'm not
[8:44] gonna say more about that well people
[8:49] telling you that you've got to go press
[8:51] play and you don't have a middle pasture
[8:55] that's a billion DM I mean nothing in
[8:59] the end of somewhere see that's more
[9:01] deceiving there because churches are
[9:04] being shut down families are being broke
[9:06] apart I don't understand well I do
[9:08] understand because heaven on earth is
[9:09] gonna be sure but the Word of God like
[9:12] I've told you many many times before
[9:13] we're gonna read again today base base
[9:15] final resting places in the word God the
[9:18] Word of God tells us it takes a powerful
[9:20] ministry to perfect the Saints not one
[9:22] person and like I said last Sunday there
[9:26] were the two witnesses to Israel are not
[9:28] going to take tape recorders over there
[9:30] and play dates it's gonna be two live
[9:33] people with skin on them they're gonna
[9:35] go over there and they're going to
[9:36] preach Jesus Christ to those people okay
[9:39] so same way here and I only believe that
[9:44] in this church I just don't want people
[9:46] to get caught up in the I'm glad that
[9:50] brother Brown told us that every church
[9:52] was sovereign so I'll just take that
[9:55] close and I say okay whatever you've got
[9:56] to say to me your dad or brother Graham
[9:59] said every Church this topic will leave
[10:02] me alone don't leave me alone hey man
[10:07] it's not gonna bother me if you've got
[10:09] the baptism the Holy Ghost that's the
[10:10] problem you got the baptism of the holy
[10:13] go you'll know but if you don't if
[10:16] you've just got some kind of emotion or
[10:17] a feeling or a or even a dictates of
[10:20] sanctification you don't have enough
[10:22] token you learner people to run after
[10:24] signs and wonders in the end time we are
[10:26] we're hearing it now from preachers that
[10:28] we don't need teaching no more we need
[10:31] demonstration that's why I did what I
[10:34] did Sunday member I'm told to ask y'all
[10:36] to raise your hand the one
[10:37] in our since we're so glad I have
[10:39] teaching people that don't have no math
[10:41] let's say I don't know what they want
[10:42] well I do know what they want they want
[10:46] a prayer line coming across some people
[10:47] later and everybody the whole building
[10:49] gets healed it's not gonna happen not
[10:53] gonna happen it's not publish oh it's
[10:55] not gonna happen it's gonna and that's
[10:57] what's gonna be shook Satan is gonna say
[11:00] this in this message folks he's not out
[11:02] there he's in this message some ask me
[11:05] other day that I believe there was
[11:06] Jesuits in the message I said absolutely
[11:08] this preacher their rejection of a
[11:11] priest in this message so but listen it
[11:16] will not deceive the UA it's gonna try
[11:20] it just says it will almost deceive the
[11:24] very elect
[11:25] so if what's going on around the message
[11:27] continues as it is it's wrong but if
[11:30] it's just going through the phase then
[11:32] you know what God will bring his
[11:34] children back I promise you they will
[11:36] but if you don't children to start with
[11:40] it's not gonna it's not
[11:43] gonna be the same and and I was
[11:46] listening to Christ's mystery of God
[11:49] revealed brother Claude brought to my
[11:51] attention when that when people say what
[11:54] they do but they do say but we don't
[11:55] need a teaching we need manifestation
[11:57] they're talking about prayer lines again
[11:59] they're talking about you know taxers
[12:02] falling off people and and you know what
[12:04] that's happened that's happened in our
[12:07] congregation last Sunday almost 95% of
[12:10] the people held her hand up they go
[12:11] ahead and heal them while they've been
[12:13] going to church here oh I've seen cancer
[12:16] I've seen dead right I've seen blinded
[12:18] eyes brought the left what absolutely
[12:20] more family and what I'm gonna ask that
[12:23] person if I haven't seen my laughter
[12:25] what do you mean by weed manifestation
[12:26] so they will God will manifest himself I
[12:29] promise you be with you just hang in
[12:32] there
[12:33] you just hang in there those who endure
[12:35] to the end shall be safe
[12:50] well the whole church is going to be
[13:00] said so you're not going to say no whole
[13:06] church doing what they were thinking it
[13:11] might be a feeling I really don't care
[13:21] you know yeah
[13:23] and let me I'm gonna put this on record
[13:26] it's going to I love them you know man
[13:28] but we brother Dale the kind of guy that
[13:31] doesn't he doesn't raise babies he does
[13:37] a baby is there's a lot of people in
[13:38] this message that gets into everybody's
[13:40] business that makes sure you know oh you
[13:43] know and you know what I was thinking
[13:45] yesterday we not how to split in this
[13:49] church since it started we have made
[13:51] split we we've had people come to church
[13:54] here brother Richard Wilson then daddy
[13:57] said go start your church somewhere
[13:59] right go start your church somewhere
[14:01] there's been splits that way which is
[14:03] wonderful but just to say that well we
[14:05] don't agree with this and we don't agree
[14:07] with that so we're just gonna start our
[14:08] own church it's never happening why
[14:10] could brother Dale he may be harder than
[14:12] two and sometimes that sometimes you
[14:14] know I I get beat up too but but you
[14:17] know what you're not baby
[14:21] every 15 minutes ain't got call them one
[14:23] nowhere you pass with that one canning
[14:25] factory before you play he is the
[14:26] shepherd but you know what he's
[14:28] responsible to give you the work what
[14:30] you do with it a lot of stay babies they
[14:48] still desire Paul said he come to pulse
[14:51] it desiring the sincere milk of the word
[14:55] sincere
[14:56] yes very sincere but he said but strong
[14:58] meat is for those of them at or those
[15:01] who don't have to whine all the time and
[15:03] cry I know how the group that was in
[15:05] Ephesus 212 they were they were right up
[15:08] here they were right here those 12 men
[15:10] and women that were in the Church of
[15:12] Ephesus a very powerful church why they
[15:15] were on a tour they didn't have to cry
[15:17] to Paul it kind of mean they need to
[15:19] someday and have to cry to Peter every
[15:20] time they need something there's some
[15:22] brother Dale loves you more than buying
[15:23] this world everyone loved you I promise
[15:25] you one thing you gonna have to search
[15:27] out your own salvation we have come to a
[15:30] place in this message where we went
[15:32] right back to Catholicism preachers
[15:37] saved my kids
[15:38] preacher then the creatures lay your
[15:40] hands on me like what brought Klaus dead
[15:42] he suit he said be careful when you lay
[15:44] hands on the state because if that
[15:46] person gets healed God doesn't get all
[15:48] the credit he's right because you stayed
[15:51] brother somebody's name and that brother
[15:53] Dale prayed for me and I got healed so I
[15:57] don't share his glory with nobody but
[15:59] what am i if you're set in your seat and
[16:00] Roselle is preaching there's no contact
[16:03] then God healed you because you believe
[16:05] the Word of God you believe what God
[16:07] said and how many times does that happen
[16:09] in our service several pounds clean up
[16:11] only the other days you
[16:12] the other day but when we were preaching
[16:14] and brother I mean it sister Gayle has
[16:17] done the same thing
[16:18] Regina a lot of people have been sitting
[16:20] in our congregation not to me that's the
[16:23] greatest manifestations because you come
[16:26] up and be prayed for
[16:27] well I get part of the credit cuz I laid
[16:30] my hand how many times have you heard
[16:31] face I laid my hands on when we
[16:40] interface I read you all that quote if
[16:42] we can't you pay them tons of no I don't
[17:04] guess I'm not looking to get a bride
[17:07] ready we help people in our church that
[17:09] can get bride ready because they can get
[17:11] people say I want to get a wife ready
[17:13] hey the Bible says his wife has made
[17:16] herself right now Jim and I've been
[17:17] married 40 years she's my wife she
[17:21] understands things about me that nobody
[17:23] does thank God and nobody understands
[17:26] for her thank God because she's my wife
[17:29] we know every inch of our person I don't
[17:32] mean physically but everything that she
[17:33] can lead to what mom and David same way
[17:36] you've been going down the road you'd be
[17:37] saying something and you go that's
[17:39] thinking the same thing you know I mean
[17:40] you become so one was that's the way God
[17:43] wants us to be that he wants to be our
[17:45] husband and there's a time when he's our
[17:47] when he's our wonderful groom and when
[17:50] we first walked up the aisle and we
[17:52] first get saved and God gives us all
[17:54] these things but you know wife is like
[17:56] man Jim man Jim this coming up tomorrow
[17:59] I mean I'm leaving for four days to go
[18:01] hunting she's not gonna be home
[18:03] cleanie-cleanie
[18:04] calling me over five minutes to you
[18:06] me no thank you I don't want that
[18:11] that's a baby that's an immature bride
[18:14] now at first when we were first together
[18:16] maybe 40 years ago I cannot remember but
[18:19] we might have kept up with each other
[18:21] there was no cell phones back then snow
[18:26] Wow
[18:28] but you understand what I mean so what
[18:30] God's trying to do he's not going to
[18:33] wrap your baby babies are gonna go by
[18:37] the grave and have to die and be
[18:38] resurrected five mature Christians good
[18:42] when we stand one day and death comes to
[18:45] to bother us are to come to us in the
[18:49] anyway for the branch that you'll rub it
[18:51] off with your show plan because you're
[18:53] mature
[19:03] you won't have even
[19:06] no that's why I mean you look at Israel
[19:10] and when you looked at the whole of
[19:12] Israel you saw more mixed multitude than
[19:15] you saw the real godly Israel because
[19:17] you saw the hair in the pants you don't
[19:19] want to bring it up to now there's a
[19:21] mixed multitude in the congregation if
[19:23] that woman sent there with paint on her
[19:25] face and she's got bobbed hair she's
[19:27] number one she's not a believer or
[19:29] either she's a real early believer like
[19:34] we were talking the other day about
[19:35] Cindy Cindy came up here years ago or
[19:38] passed several times several times you
[19:39] don't want way to thin the back door and
[19:41] go hey don't you come to church again
[19:43] without a dress I'll not make dynamap
[19:44] talk about believe in but when you come
[19:48] to a revelation you don't have to worry
[19:50] about it yeah you don't have to worry
[19:52] about these things to me see that's the
[19:54] baby and we got in there and don't get
[19:56] me wrong
[19:57] like it was standing last Sunday there
[19:59] are teachers I'm stopped there are
[20:04] teachers of kindergarteners there
[20:07] teacher
[20:08] there's teachers of high school and
[20:11] there's teachers of college all right so
[20:14] you got a graduation times all the way
[20:16] up through there
[20:17] so what brother Dale I'm leaving myself
[20:19] to this is we've come to a place to
[20:21] where we're trying to we tried to get
[20:23] the people ready for a rapture not ready
[20:26] to be born again now he has brought back
[20:28] though and what's he preaching on now
[20:30] salvation
[20:30] Sampo salvation but in simple salvation
[20:37] if you'll start right if you start right
[20:41] yield yourself to God you'll come up to
[20:43] here but if you don't start right that's
[20:48] why they first Brown said he said it up
[20:51] born you woman won't will prepare plans
[20:54] for you won't correct well this is
[20:56] easier to walk around in our church with
[20:59] our hair tight trim or will make the
[21:00] bumper whatever more you want to say all
[21:03] that list of laundry list of things and
[21:05] she continued that she's been sitting in
[21:07] the church for 10 years
[21:08] Morrigan he's not listening it's going
[21:10] in one ear out the other and you know
[21:12] what you can't tell them people anything
[21:14] they're not ready to receive the truth
[21:17] because they want to walk but you know
[21:18] what I asked daddy one time I said how
[21:22] do you pull up with these people they
[21:23] felt long come back he said they'd pay
[21:25] the bill God can put you in this church
[21:31] and you be as dead as a hammer yet he
[21:35] wants you to fund part of what's going
[21:37] on in this church don't you think I'd do
[21:38] that yeah you'll do that he wants you to
[21:40] be born again but you know what God
[21:42] knows that you won't so he's gonna use
[21:44] you anyway it's gonna take he's going to
[21:46] help you he's gonna help us by putting
[21:50] that person in the scene
[21:51] don't tell me listen we got a hundred
[21:53] from some people in our church they're
[21:54] not all born again I wish I wish and
[21:58] there are like I said before we're not
[22:00] trying to leave them but there comes a
[22:02] time when thoughts in leaving the
[22:04] principles of the doctrine of Christ of
[22:07] laying on of hands and all these other
[22:10] things baptism you said well God do it
[22:12] baptism no it's that you don't have to
[22:14] be baptized again your baptism was right
[22:17] forget it sister Guinea was baptized the
[22:21] other day again but she she met she had
[22:23] she went to get a stable join he get
[22:26] settled in a line and that's fine ain't
[22:28] no problems they have to be do i I was
[22:31] supposed to be in Boca you know why I
[22:33] don't know
[22:36] you know here a bride is so long you
[22:39] know why it's a killing here without a
[22:43] wife Brooke I was a bride for a few days
[22:46] run that right back but you know you
[22:51] remember it's just like that it's like
[22:53] mom said you somebody hadn't been made
[22:55] don't know this but even with with
[22:56] Francine we met them how long you been a
[22:59] 31 years well we met you when she was a
[23:02] baby so she's 28
[23:11] any born-again young man with like
[23:17] moving to Canada but that's okay but 31
[23:22] years you know when I met Keith and
[23:24] Francine I mean they were just oh they
[23:26] were just little birds and they still
[23:27] are but you know what you don't have to
[23:29] you don't have to do that clinging on
[23:31] that it's like brother Brown said I can
[23:34] take the letter and open it up now if
[23:36] you've been born if you've been born
[23:38] again
[23:38] you've been yeah you've been born again
[23:40] but if you've been husband and wife for
[23:42] a long time I could be setting up in
[23:44] Illinois and Jim send me an email and I
[23:48] know exactly what you're doing at that
[23:50] time about what she's writing and
[23:52] exactly what she's thinking
[23:53] that's that love letter to him between
[23:56] the lines that God has wrote to this
[23:58] bride to his bride that we in any moment
[24:02] we can read this thing here that we call
[24:04] a love letter and we can read what God
[24:07] wants to me that them told you that
[24:09] that's the essence of the Bible and the
[24:11] essence of the message because Paul says
[24:13] the letter of killing this Bible in
[24:15] letter form is going to kill a lot of
[24:17] people literally kill a lot of people
[24:22] but if you take the essence of what
[24:24] God's talking about and you bring it
[24:25] into your heart and then you know what
[24:26] he say you know he said the my flesh and
[24:29] drink my blood what's going on we got a
[24:34] revelation we know because what we
[24:35] become life but I love that in
[24:39] revelation 19 where it says his wife is
[24:41] later
[24:42] now she wasn't we were always gonna be a
[24:44] bride but she's a wife brother Brown
[24:48] said the bride and the end of time want
[24:50] to know what he wants to do with the
[24:52] worst so if you don't know what to do
[24:56] with the words and go back down here I
[25:00] said you can't get right here without
[25:04] having this and that no that's right so
[25:11] you've got a really your three processes
[25:13] of grace continues on to the change of
[25:17] the money because your true day that
[25:20] you're truly baptized with the baptism
[25:22] of the Holy Ghost is the day when your
[25:24] body's change back to a young man and a
[25:26] woman and we step over in another
[25:27] dimension that's when it will culminate
[25:30] for us but it's not over remember he's
[25:33] got to go turn to the Jews and then he's
[25:35] got a plan 144,000 a nice guy
[25:37] v till June he's got the Millennium
[25:40] there thanks a lot of things goes on but
[25:41] you're not arresting as Paul said we're
[25:44] resting knowing that that we pass from
[25:50] death unto life okay but maturity we the
[25:55] problem with people they they caught the
[25:57] message of the hour I believe some
[25:59] people caught the message in the hour as
[26:00] do's and don'ts and that's coming out of
[26:03] Pentecost because I was thinking this
[26:05] yesterday and I've read his quote the
[26:08] other day we're brother Brown said when
[26:11] the bride begins to say and I am my
[26:13] father a1c you can take a message to
[26:15] people and preach it to them and they
[26:18] just they're like whoa what do you mean
[26:21] I am the I am what do you mean I am the
[26:24] resurrection what do you like I've
[26:25] preached here well I win preaches
[26:27] somewhere else and you can feel a little
[26:28] bit may enjoy the sermon but is like how
[26:31] you don't be far now we go for that when
[26:35] right begins to say I and my father and
[26:38] I read John 17d all the other day no I
[26:41] didn't read him him he said that we I
[26:44] pray that as you and I are one Jesus was
[26:49] praying to the father as the as the
[26:51] father and I are one so they should be
[26:54] one like we're one now house Jesus and
[26:56] father one too
[27:00] he's the very essence of the father so
[27:03] we must be the very essence of the
[27:04] father God we're going heirs with Christ
[27:07] we read that in Roman Roman day we're
[27:08] doing it that's right
[27:16] when hebrews hebrews hebrews 10 5 says
[27:20] the bodies now has prepared me embody
[27:22] you know that jesus not you in the
[27:26] beginning was work worth with God where
[27:28] was God well were you separate we just
[27:30] separate person and the Word was made
[27:33] flesh and dwelt among us Jesus yes first
[27:37] bridge yes but you know what being first
[27:39] fruit there's fruit behind that Oh feel
[27:42] free so see we leave but when you start
[27:45] staying on my father one brother after
[27:47] the show which is what Pentecostal
[27:50] people which is what shouting speaking
[27:53] in tongues dancing prayer lines they
[27:55] have to all come through that and you
[27:57] know what
[27:58] I don't know against it I'm just saying
[27:59] we don't need it I'm not against it I'm
[28:03] not against weighing don't bother to us
[28:04] they lay hands on the state but it
[28:05] doesn't say scream shouts laughs woman
[28:07] on the floor hey put them in a prayer
[28:11] line it says lay hands on the sick and
[28:13] they shall recover I've seen my daddy
[28:14] man time somebody say well I got a
[28:16] backache he'll work his way around the
[28:18] congregation or he'll be outside and
[28:20] he'll welcome to that brother and shake
[28:21] his hand he'll put his hand around on
[28:22] the back never say a word shake his hand
[28:25] please hammer-ons back then walk off you
[28:27] know what he's done he's prayed for that
[28:28] first so that's the way it should be and
[28:32] that's the way I like it for this church
[28:34] everybody you say we're drivin for
[28:36] debate I really don't care I'm getting
[28:38] something we're go
[28:39] somewhere somebody is going somewhere
[28:41] all right and maybe there's five of us
[28:44] or ten of us I wish it was all 100 but
[28:47] it's not going to be it's right now I'm
[28:49] sorry I'm sorry it's just not but for
[28:52] those that catch it then you're going to
[28:55] be a Christian life like I would let me
[28:58] finish my point I was listening to cross
[29:00] the mystery of God reveal coming back
[29:02] from Illinois that's a good thing
[29:03] because you know you can witness eight
[29:04] hours so you listen to two three our
[29:06] sermons gained and got home yet I listen
[29:09] to the future home Christ the mystery
[29:10] God revealed so but brother Brown says
[29:13] he stopped and he said he keeps saying
[29:16] he keeps quoting he keeps saying he
[29:18] keeps quoting and then he says look at
[29:20] the clock he said is exactly two o'clock
[29:23] the end of the second poll now what was
[29:26] the second poll first poll was taking
[29:29] the people by the hand second poll was
[29:31] the determinant thoughts and intents of
[29:33] the heart
[29:33] see that's what everybody wants now they
[29:37] want to go back to that he says that the
[29:39] poll is indeed and I'm like brother
[29:42] Claude said he said I don't know what
[29:44] they don't get about end but if he says
[29:47] the second poll has ended the third
[29:50] Apple is at hand which is the opening of
[29:52] the word speaking of the word speaking
[29:55] the word and let it manifest itself
[29:57] because remember remember remember all
[30:00] Israel is not Israel all bride is not
[30:04] bride there will be a bride there's no
[30:06] doubt but there is going to be a mature
[30:08] wife that you don't have to tell them to
[30:11] come to church you know I tell them pay
[30:15] their time you can see people you can
[30:17] stand and see people that struggle
[30:19] because of these simple things now
[30:21] paying your tithes not coming to church
[30:22] every Sunday you can see those people
[30:24] they struggle all the time all the time
[30:28] all the time I mean so obvious it's not
[30:31] obvious to them I guess but but just
[30:35] doing the simple things to ABC's
[30:38] foundation member is really wide a lot
[30:41] of things to work them down here as soon
[30:43] as you get a little bit further up here
[30:46] you're growing up to a point
[30:50] where Christ is the head that's Christ
[30:53] but you know what that's not only Christ
[30:55] this is his body and the body is what
[31:00] does the what the moving exercise the
[31:07] work yes that's the body that does the
[31:10] work well that's us that the body
[31:11] doesn't work and we've got to what verse
[31:13] to be not forgotten to entertain
[31:17] strangers for thereby some have
[31:18] entertained angels unawares remember the
[31:23] story about the guy wanting something
[31:24] God want something God he sends him this
[31:26] guy behind extensions a baker and it
[31:28] sends him up another guy behind he sends
[31:30] he miss guy behind and he said Lord that
[31:31] you haven't appeared to me and he said I
[31:33] sent you three people to hell to you it
[31:36] didn't you didn't take him so entertain
[31:39] angels unaware
[31:41] remember them that are in bonds as bound
[31:44] with them now that's nothing we tell my
[31:48] people they're in and and don't get me
[31:50] wrong we're not throwing babies you
[31:53] don't throw the baby out with the
[31:54] bathwater you try to nurture that baby
[31:57] but you only do so much because it's the
[31:59] two minutes if you're free of all
[32:01] agencies it doesn't you stop anytime you
[32:03] want to remember in balance and we do we
[32:07] try to break that bond brother man
[32:08] brother
[32:09] they all said just like Bill Graham
[32:10] chill we just try to break the spell
[32:11] over your eyes so you can see Christ not
[32:13] us that's the whole problem we go well I
[32:16] go to church I go to
[32:19] the work there's no glue no you go
[32:23] to church to see Christ remember Barry
[32:26] Bonds has bound with them and then which
[32:28] suffer adversity as being yourselves
[32:31] also in the body
[32:32] in other words brother brown stated
[32:34] brotherly kindness what do you say put
[32:36] yourself in that person's place all
[32:39] right marriage is honorable in all and
[32:42] the bed undefiled but whoremongers and
[32:44] adulterers
[32:45] he's talking about spiritual - marriage
[32:49] is honorable just talking about being in
[32:51] the body of Christ a bit to get nobody
[32:52] to cry to be a bride you gotta have a
[32:54] bridegroom I've never seen a bride going
[32:57] to the to the altar by herself
[32:59] we're saying this the world you got
[33:01] several different things going on in
[33:03] this world you got telling the same
[33:05] thanks going up there you know wet jump
[33:08] but marriage is honorable in all and the
[33:10] bed undefiled but whoremongers and
[33:11] adulterers God will judge let your
[33:13] conversation be without covetousness in
[33:18] other words everybody sit and it is a
[33:23] good example but let me finish my
[33:24] conversation I want to be like brother
[33:26] Dale I don't be like brother Dale won't
[33:28] be like Christ right and if Christ the
[33:31] den brother Dale then I'll see that in
[33:33] him and I don't want to because there's
[33:35] a lot of things dad does it I don't like
[33:37] there's a lot of things I do he don't
[33:39] like a lot less each of us do in the
[33:43] human part that we don't like but it's
[33:45] spiritually you got headship and brother
[33:48] Dale if the headship of the church but
[33:49] Christ is the head of mmm Christ is the
[33:52] head okay but thank God did he give us
[33:56] positions that you can depend on because
[33:59] you do need to put your faith in
[34:00] something if we put our faith in things
[34:01] that are not saying but then when God
[34:03] send us a message and send us a good
[34:05] pastor and a good teacher they didn't
[34:06] think when he sends us to good people
[34:08] here then you don't want to reap that
[34:10] benefit all reap that benefit remember
[34:13] them which have the rule over you who
[34:14] have spoken unto you the word garbage
[34:15] faith follow considering the end of
[34:17] their conversation to hunter hunter
[34:27] when I woke up this meant wanna cut it
[34:30] don't covet thy neighbor no cut it means
[34:32] I won't watch these girls have rights
[34:37] what I was just saying that was my whole
[34:39] point that was my whole point
[34:42] I don't covet this is not greedy of
[34:46] filthy lucre I'm not loaning money narc
[34:48] okay whenever is just what's mean I
[34:51] don't want I don't want to be you know
[34:53] and that's what happens in the world
[34:54] people go I want to have what this
[34:57] person has to they're rich and famous
[34:59] and they got a big car and they got to
[35:00] be how's me that's a Christian you
[35:02] should never want that you should be
[35:04] what your conversation what's Paul
[35:08] saying he's running up against people
[35:11] he's run up against people that says
[35:14] well Paul I want this you remember only
[35:16] people hung around Paul yes they will
[35:18] miss the sign of the sorcerer and all
[35:20] hymns that woman and all day always what
[35:22] following Paul said follow me as I
[35:25] follow Christ they weren't looking at
[35:27] Christ they were looking at also their
[35:28] conversation was coveting what Paul had
[35:31] okay I want what brother Dale's got but
[35:34] in Christianity not in all the other
[35:36] thing
[35:42] you connect someone else
[35:45] we're actually you're actually degrading
[35:50] what God's give you you know I when I
[35:54] first started preaching I thought well
[35:55] man if I had an airlock home-along Lord
[35:57] find the breach let Donny Reagan I'd be
[35:59] fine but you know what doc comon should
