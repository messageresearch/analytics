[18:41] that front is this a test
[18:46] inside inside okay in front of the
[18:49] church right here not out there it just

[19:01] misinterpret a is mr. turpitude theology
[19:04] brother Larry gets us in trouble
[19:05] right Larry OD all right let's turn up
[19:10] let's go and get started because we got
[19:12] a lot of things we got to cover today
[19:13] since it's been a couple of weeks I hope
[19:16] you still enjoying the the first seal
[19:18] will be finished with it I I thought we
[19:21] may be finished with it today but solve
[19:24] something else this morning that we need
[19:26] to cover that I believe will really help
[19:27] you so let's turn to revelation 6 good
[19:32] to have everybody here good to have a
[19:34] brother Brown and sister Joan with us
[19:35] thank you for getting here thank you
[19:38] very much and we pray that the Lord will
[19:44] bless you all and we've been on the
[19:47] first seal now this would be number
[19:48] eight for those of you that are looking
[19:51] for number seven part seven if you'll
[19:53] remember we were
[19:55] had a power failure and during the
[19:58] service the power went off well when the
[20:00] power goes off it resets the internet so
[20:04] we had nothing past that except the
[20:06] audio so but we're gonna try to cover a
[20:09] little bit more today and what we did
[20:11] back then and then going a little bit
[20:12] further some revelation 6 verse 1 let's
[20:16] bow our heads Hendley father Lord as we
[20:21] always say please be the active
[20:22] participant in this service you'd be the
[20:25] one that does the speaking you'd be the
[20:27] one that does the hearing and you're the
[20:28] only one that can give revelation I pray
[20:31] that you would anoint us all Lord not
[20:33] just the speaker but annoying everyone
[20:35] in the building so that we may hear from
[20:38] you today Father forgive us of our sins
[20:40] and our many mistakes that we make bless
[20:44] the missionaries that are on the foreign
[20:45] fields give them fruit for their labor
[20:47] or just be with each one around the
[20:50] country all the little bride of Jesus
[20:52] Christ is their symbol today that you'll
[20:54] give them strength and revelation also
[20:56] Lord because that's what we live off of
[20:58] we live off Revelation and we need that
[21:02] more than anything father just be with
[21:05] us take care of us in to further than
[21:06] this service may everything be done for
[21:09] your honor and glory in Jesus name we
[21:10] pray amen revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw
[21:14] when the lamb opened one of the seals
[21:15] and I heard as it were the noise of
[21:17] thunder one of the four beasts saying
[21:20] come and see and I saw him behold a
[21:23] white horse and he that sat on him out
[21:25] of bow and the crown was given unto him
[21:27] and he went forth conquering and to
[21:28] conquer you may be seated in the Lord at
[21:31] his blessing for the reading of the work
[21:32] I'm going to bring to get the chart out
[21:34] again today if that's all right I see
[21:37] mom put it up she doesn't like things to
[21:39] be stuck out all over the place so she
[21:41] put it back my mother says Amen here he
[21:46] does not like to have things stuck where
[21:48] they shouldn't be so I know I know you
[21:53] all you sisters do agree with her on
[21:55] that but us men are like it's a fine
[21:58] right where it's at it's not in the way
[22:00] right right brothers
[22:03] it's not in the way that ranch has been
[22:05] there for six months we'll need it
[22:07] eventually and if you move it somewhere
[22:10] else I've seen daddy look all day for
[22:12] stuff mama put up right Susan and Don
[22:17] ears fighting over the same thing at the
[22:19] moment so we're good to be here and we
[22:23] will I tell you what I did I found
[22:26] something the other day and I'm gonna
[22:27] look for it you see how Glary that is
[22:29] intense even in the back said you can't
[22:31] hardly see that well I was looking on
[22:34] one of my beach hats last night and the
[22:35] guy in Australia he uses a yellow
[22:37] background and it's it's not yellow it's
[22:40] more of an orange yellow but man you
[22:42] talk about seeing the the the the black
[22:44] just jumps out so I may try to either
[22:46] paint that thing or or try to find this
[22:49] one but some of you in the back I'm
[22:51] sorry if you can't see it but I'll try
[22:52] to write big so you can see it that we
[22:56] do the best we can with what we got all
[22:58] right so now we're in this seal where
[23:00] we're out still in the first seal and
[23:02] we're working toward just for a
[23:05] background for a minute let me get Joe
[23:09] go and pull that one up brother Joe
[23:11] let's let's show the one that we always
[23:13] do because I believe that that as we've
[23:19] said before the the breaking of the seal
[23:21] is not necessarily for the soul now
[23:24] don't get me wrong in you you that's
[23:26] been here know what I'm saying there's
[23:28] going to be millions upon millions of
[23:30] people in the bride of Jesus Christ that
[23:33] never had the seals open to them now
[23:35] they live through them amen
[23:38] they got revelation off of the seals
[23:42] that are in the Bible because the seals
[23:43] is the entire Bible but they never come
[23:47] to the revelation of the opening of the
[23:51] seals like we have amen so the breaking
[23:55] of the seals is not necessarily for the
[23:57] soul because the soul is redeemed by the
[23:58] new birth the blood of Jesus Christ and
[24:01] man not of the opening of the seals not
[24:03] that a prophet came amen amen
[24:08] it comes by believing on the shed blood
[24:11] of Jesus Christ at Calvary that's what
[24:12] brother Dale has been preaching on
[24:13] salvation
[24:15] through justification sanctification in
[24:17] the baptism of the holy ghost which we
[24:18] believe 100% amen but it will bring full
[24:22] fellowship back into manifestations that
[24:25] God and man can now commune or than
[24:29] they've ever been able to commune why
[24:31] because the devil's been exposed and
[24:35] he's riding away from your revelation
[24:37] and man he's riding away from your
[24:40] revelation so as we said many times
[24:44] before and we'll get into it real quick
[24:47] just the background that when the seals
[24:50] you know the property God told us he was
[24:52] talking about this and that
[24:55] back when the in John when he saw it
[24:57] when the seals were wrote they weren't
[24:59] written in a book brother Brian
[25:02] understands this because this is even
[25:03] the Torah
[25:04] now the original Torah is folded out
[25:07] like this has folded in folded ounce out
[25:10] like this the trains rolled out so the
[25:13] seal had whatever was inside sealed up
[25:17] where man couldn't see it so now we
[25:20] realize that the prophet of God come to
[25:23] what now not the prophet of God but God
[25:26] himself through the Prophet and then the
[25:30] God himself through the prophets stood
[25:32] there on those days of those seals and
[25:34] broke this part a man took the seal off
[25:45] but he told us what this seal was this
[25:49] seal is the Antichrist not Jesus Christ
[25:53] but in but I am sorry but we've been
[25:57] here 50 60 something years since the
[25:59] seals broke and the seals are the
[26:02] headstone to the church the the total
[26:06] redemption of body spirit and soul amen
[26:09] to change our body to get us out of here
[26:11] because no one else had this revelation
[26:12] because what you can't read that in this
[26:16] form something had it sealed up and it
[26:19] was sealed up under the mystery of
[26:21] iniquity like we were talking about this
[26:24] had to be exposed first
[26:27] so as the seal broke the problem with us
[26:31] is though we're weird like I said before
[26:34] where's we're we're so caught up with
[26:37] this and forget about this because
[26:48] remember I wrote you a quote we're not
[26:49] gonna read it today cuz I just pulled
[26:51] some a few quotes out this is not going
[26:54] to change your body this will change
[26:58] your body
[26:59] the revelation underneath the seal
[27:02] because just knowing that Satan as the
[27:05] Antichrist it's not going to change your
[27:06] body then you Satan was Antichrist in
[27:09] John's day back in the first church he
[27:12] called him an antichrist amen
[27:15] but Satan had it sealed up the prophet
[27:20] of God comes in the end time to break
[27:23] that seal and tell us that's the wild
[27:26] horse rider and there he goes riding
[27:28] through those church ages but now
[27:31] remember the quote that I read you that
[27:32] the seals and the thunders are two
[27:34] different things right
[27:37] I read you the closer the seals and the
[27:39] thunders are two different things so we
[27:41] have the revelation of the seals right
[27:43] there in the book property God preached
[27:47] seven messages Amen but the Thunder is
[27:51] what you and I which is the voice of God
[27:54] not seven men not polygamy how in the
[27:57] world can that be take a body change and
[28:01] have seven wives and I mean what's your
[28:02] body to have to change if you had seven
[28:04] one promised you that you'd be a mental
[28:09] cave and the dog said amen
[28:14] [Music]
[28:16] but the revelation was a revelation of
[28:20] Jesus Christ
[28:21] we saw the opposition we're going to
[28:23] look at in just a minute and I'm gonna
[28:25] show you next
[28:26] well I'm not snakes on you but the next
[28:27] honey what happened in those church ages
[28:30] because like I said before let's stop
[28:33] right here we know the prophet of God
[28:38] preached the church ages all right amen
[28:42] six seven everybody got that say man
[28:45] that's the church ages I'm not gonna
[28:47] draw the little what you know what he
[28:49] put it the light he put in there but
[28:51] this these was what this was the lion
[28:56] and look I'm gonna do like God does he
[28:59] makes overlaps a man that all right can
[29:06] we do that
[29:09] go this is the Ox the man and the white
[29:14] eagle I was thinking the other day now a
[29:21] lion is very strong but when it's a baby
[29:23] what does it drink milk then it
[29:26] progresses the meat they were pretty
[29:29] strong in this church age right
[29:31] now an ox when the Ox babies born it
[29:34] drinks milk but then it just eats Christ
[29:38] amen I'm getting somewhere with this the
[29:41] man even when the man you'll find out
[29:44] out in a little while sister the man has
[29:47] a baby and it what does it drink but it
[29:52] grows up and progresses to eat meat but
[29:56] now an eagle never drinks milk a baby
[30:02] eagle has mama preacher why you have to
[30:09] have faithful ministry mama preacher
[30:11] choose the big pieces of meat I wish
[30:17] this was true in the church and shoves
[30:18] it down the throat
[30:23] I'm asked what she does she shoved it
[30:28] down his throat but she breaks it up in
[30:30] little pieces so the Eagle can
[30:32] understand what they're eating that
[30:34] Alright saying man so the Eagle never
[30:38] drinks milk but now these others a lion
[30:40] boy tear you up and kill you but the
[30:42] baby starts drinking milk at first aid
[30:45] second age third age fourth fifth six
[30:48] right up even to number seven here in
[30:50] the Eagle Age you and I eat meat
[30:53] we are meat eaters even the baby eagle
[30:56] is born with the hook and born with
[30:59] talons amen because they're going to eat
[31:03] meat that's you and I we're gonna eat
[31:05] meat strong me then alright say man so
[31:13] in the first church age the first three
[31:16] ages now we're going to come up here
[31:19] like this and we're going to show you
[31:20] something if that's all right we're
[31:24] gonna do the same thing
[31:34] now brother branham told us that the
[31:41] rapture takes place on the fourth seal
[31:44] right we're getting a little head of
[31:46] ourselves but we need to do we need this
[31:47] some background the rapture takes place
[31:49] on the fourth seal why because all the
[31:52] combat beats are gone he says that all
[31:55] the combat beasts are gone so so we must
[31:59] not assume know that those four combat
[32:03] beasts or what that's the that's the
[32:05] inspiration of the Holy Ghost through
[32:07] the church ages and the property God
[32:10] really told us we needed all of them in
[32:12] this age amen
[32:15] but the lion ox man and Eagle after that
[32:17] fourth seal the fifth seal doesn't say
[32:20] and the fifth beast said come and see
[32:22] right
[32:24] it was four beats that said come and see
[32:26] and they came and they saw but brother
[32:29] Ram said yeah after the fourth seal you
[32:30] don't see those combat B so therefore
[32:32] the rapture takes place on one two three
[32:37] four seal when's the rapture takes place
[32:40] seven churches very simple but now
[32:44] people will you know throw a wrench well
[32:48] you've got three more seals we'll get
[32:50] into that but if the rapture takes place
[32:53] on the fourth seal or after the fourth
[32:56] seal then we must put them in two that
[32:59] the first seal types the first three
[33:01] ages brother Brown says this we already
[33:03] know that then you've got an overlap
[33:06] coming into the second then the third
[33:07] and then the fourth you got the white
[33:09] horse rider the red horse rider the
[33:10] black horse rider and the pale horse
[33:12] rider all right black red I mean sorry
[33:19] white black red and all those mixed
[33:22] together right there I got that same am
[33:24] all right so what we're doing is is
[33:27] we're looking at this seal when the seal
[33:29] break it shows us redemption because
[33:35] what what is uh let me put it this way
[33:40] doesn't matter what messenger come you
[33:45] know and in the Book of Revelations we
[33:46] read it next Sunday
[33:47] you got revelation
[33:48] two and three in there that tells to the
[33:50] church of ephesus i right now we know
[33:55] the property God put Paul Iranian Martin
[33:57] Columba Luther Wesleyan and himself in
[34:01] those slots but remember that messenger
[34:06] received a message from God and it just
[34:09] didn't seal him away it sealed the
[34:12] people away a man the bride was being
[34:15] built in these seven churches there's no
[34:18] other Gentile bride outside of those
[34:21] seven churches hey man because we're
[34:25] because when we leave it goes to the
[34:27] Jews no more Gentile Church ages amen so
[34:33] we've got seven church ages that builds
[34:35] the body and then the head comes and
[34:38] picks us up without the headstone here
[34:41] we're not going out and then because
[34:44] that's the problem with all these ages
[34:45] they didn't have the headstone message
[34:48] in other words they didn't have the
[34:51] opening of the seals because there had
[34:54] to come a prophet in the end time a
[34:57] divine interpreter of the Word of God to
[35:01] not only tell us what this seal is that
[35:05] had kept this hid but to also reveal the
[35:08] thunders the voice of God when the seal
[35:13] breaks there's something underneath
[35:16] there that you and I have got to have a
[35:19] man that okay and then it's been hitting
[35:26] the Bible it's not a new Bible it's the
[35:30] same Bible but it took a prophet a
[35:33] divine interpreter of the Word of God
[35:35] but our problem there's a lot of times
[35:37] we go you'll ask most people in the
[35:39] message you'll say what is the
[35:40] revelation of the seals awesome
[35:42] Antichrist it's an answer where is
[35:48] redemption in an antichrist the Thunder
[35:54] is the voice of God not the voice of the
[35:57] devil
[35:59] but it's not the voice of God to anybody
[36:01] it's to those who will listen he that
[36:06] have to hear let him hear what the
[36:09] Spirit says to the church hey man
[36:14] mama ego breaking down the meat giving
[36:18] it to you but you know why when you grow
[36:20] up you do the same thing with little
[36:25] Eagles that come up under you you chew
[36:27] the word you pull out a little piece
[36:29] here and there and you put it down the
[36:30] throat some choke but to restore full
[36:40] fellowship this is the only way it could
[36:42] go he was saved at 70 weeks of Daniel
[36:45] him he had to come in and break it for
[36:48] the Gentiles hey man there were 70 weeks
[36:52] determined of the Jews not to us amen
[36:55] but he broke it he broke the 69th week
[36:59] he broke it
[37:00] amen and then a Gentile church come
[37:03] there but when we leave that last week
[37:06] is to the redemption of the Jews and
[37:11] regeneration of the earth to put us in
[37:14] the Millennium that all right say Amen
[37:16] and you know as well as I do there's
[37:18] much contention about is it a half week
[37:20] or there's no half simbop in the Bible
[37:23] there's no half week he shall confirm
[37:27] the covenant with many for one week when
[37:29] is that one week gonna start when we
[37:31] leave amen
[37:33] well we believe that here Phil you know
[37:38] why I call this what the Bible says
[37:40] that's what the Bible says he said well
[37:44] I got quotes what have you got what the
[37:46] Bible says you can't make brother Brown
[37:49] say nothing what the Bible didn't say
[37:52] Amen just gotta have revelation right so
[38:00] you got that's why we feed off of that
[38:03] meat we feed off of that revelation we
[38:07] feed off of of strong meat we don't
[38:10] forget the milk
[38:12] I like milk my life state I don't think
[38:18] I've ever had Milt with my steak but
[38:21] I've had cornbread and milk that was
[38:23] good yeah but steak and baked potatoes
[38:26] good for you it'll make you whole but
[38:32] some of you more hold another but the
[38:36] doctor always told me said you need to
[38:37] get in shape I said doc round is a shape
[38:41] all right I make you laugh cuz you go
[38:45] fall asleep you everybody lost an hour
[38:47] last night well some did ones that
[38:50] didn't turn the clock back didn't but
[38:51] our go forward didn't but you see the
[38:55] layout so now we know that when brother
[38:58] Brown says the rapture takes place on
[39:00] the fourth seal we don't go bonkers cuz
[39:03] where's the end of the fourth seal right
[39:05] here at this church age because the Holy
[39:08] Ghost leaves the earth amen all right
[39:11] but you get we're gonna we got to stop
[39:13] right here with number one because in
[39:15] the first three ages it's parallel or
[39:19] tight with that first seal that all
[39:20] right say ma'am we've already been
[39:22] through this but just a little
[39:23] background so we're looking at the book
[39:25] of redemption excuse me the book of
[39:27] redemption has the names of all the
[39:29] redeemed right and where are the
[39:31] redeemed in those Church ages they're
[39:34] not out of the and the listen don't be
[39:36] technical the bride never was in an age
[39:38] but there were seven Church ages we are
[39:42] absolutely in a Laodicean Church age you
[39:45] know why cuz I'm sweating and I'm
[39:47] fishing to go turn the air conditioner
[39:48] on all right Richard you want to get the
[39:52] other thing about 71 but she asked lay
[39:54] out I said we live and lay out and see
[39:55] it but we've been caught up out of the
[39:57] age listen we don't paint like the age
[40:01] we shouldn't we don't think like the
[40:05] layout of scene age those people are
[40:07] weird and weird thoughts I'm talking
[40:12] about beeping the message you don't
[40:13] think I'm nobody blush under but let's
[40:17] get on the seal the characteristic of
[40:20] the first seal was what it was why horse
[40:22] rider it was a white horse which was a
[40:25] power
[40:26] it was white because he didn't want to
[40:28] make it any other dark ugly muddy color
[40:31] Satan wanted to be so close to win but
[40:35] look and to law of contrast as the
[40:38] property gardens teaches us the law of
[40:40] contrast is Satan never is an originator
[40:43] right Satan has nothing he don't even
[40:47] have a seed to reproduce yourself and
[40:50] why are we scared of somebody that don't
[40:52] even have he can reproduce yourself he
[40:57] can't make an original thought he can't
[41:03] you see how powerless he is he waits for
[41:07] God to step forward and then right
[41:09] behind him not less far behind him this
[41:12] far behind as soon as God brings
[41:14] something original Satan comes in and
[41:16] perversion join the first church age God
[41:18] had a white righteous church on the
[41:21] earth
[41:22] hey man you say oh no that was a wild
[41:26] horse rider he had to be in opposition
[41:29] to something he's not an originator so
[41:34] there was a white righteous church no
[41:37] denomination no Father Son Holy Ghost
[41:39] baptism no this eternal hell stuff all
[41:44] this other stuff that denominations have
[41:46] come up in the ages that was not in
[41:48] those first three Church ages
[41:50] sure it became them as I saying I'll
[41:54] read it in a minute if we get to it I
[41:55] may not get to it today the way this is
[41:57] going but I'm kind of background kind of
[41:59] refreshing everybody's memory but the
[42:02] first three ages they had water baptism
[42:08] right they didn't have to get up and
[42:12] preach and correct another denomination
[42:14] right they'd have a Baptist on the
[42:19] corner in the Memphis on this corner and
[42:20] presidency on this corner and Paul went
[42:22] and tried to convert them all no Paul
[42:24] was converting raw heathens like Lewis
[42:27] was talking this morning the Romans he
[42:29] said to the Romans like that said the
[42:31] Corinthians all these were idol
[42:33] worshipers Paul was going among the idol
[42:37] worshipers and he walks in that day and
[42:39] he sees that little place that says to
[42:41] the unknown God Paul says I want to talk
[42:45] to you about that one that's the one I
[42:48] know because it must be unknown to you
[42:51] but it's not unknown to me so in those
[42:55] first Church ages there was a white
[42:56] righteous church on the earth all right
[43:01] so in opposition Satan slides right in
[43:05] then go to the bar rooms and try to
[43:08] convert nobody he goes to the champion
[43:11] tries to convert people
[43:13] he starts sleeping impulses grievious
[43:17] wolves are among you now they men so
[43:23] Satan's seat walked right in and sits
[43:25] down beside of God amen
[43:30] and so powerful that at the end of this
[43:34] third church aids in there and that
[43:36] Nicean council listen to me I want you
[43:39] to listen to this he converts a world of
[43:44] Christians to a false doctrine
[43:49] did he not Colombo was a Trinitarian
[43:56] Martin Luther was a Trinitarian John
[44:00] Wesley was a Trinitarian and the first
[44:02] part of Pentecost was a Trinitarian God
[44:05] wing-tipped their ignorance though amen
[44:12] eternal hell all those things came into
[44:14] these church ages but not here they
[44:17] didn't have to deal with them it when
[44:18] this when these first three ages came
[44:20] out they were a pure Church they had a
[44:23] school
[44:23] they had the Word of God amen so Satan
[44:28] comes out and he he says life I kind of
[44:30] like this I'm gonna ride with him cuz
[44:32] remember he's anointed two more anointed
[44:36] than most of us hello
[44:40] so he gets on what a power the people
[44:43] and he begins to ride
[44:46] so now let's read the first one because
[44:52] I want you to remember too though you've
[44:54] got to show this opposition that Satan
[44:56] is riding in up here but keeping the
[45:02] back your mind there is a real church
[45:04] God's got a real group of people on the
[45:08] earth and he is presenting the plan of
[45:11] redemption and then this whole thing is
[45:15] Redemption Redemption Redemption brother
[45:18] Branson don't ever forget that word
[45:20] Redemption and then because the feast
[45:24] seals are going to redeem us to the apex
[45:27] to the height of Christianity it's not
[45:30] gonna be because Satan did it but it
[45:33] will be that we know his plan
[45:37] we know his mystery the mystery of
[45:43] iniquity 1961 look see what it's doing
[45:48] it's these seals opening up just begin
[45:52] to reveal the plan of the devil know I
[45:56] read that wrong I'm sorry just begin to
[46:00] reveal the plan of redemption how he did
[46:04] it right the total plan of redemption
[46:08] was the Thunder that was underneath this
[46:11] seal under seal number two under seal
[46:14] number three under sealing them before
[46:16] I'm the seal number five number seven
[46:17] number six number seven was the mystery
[46:20] of our Redemption so there so just about
[46:27] finishing that look it's all over now
[46:29] just about finish that worth the end
[46:30] time now we are that was 1961 look how
[46:34] close we are
[46:35] yeah we're 45
[46:37] 5060 years from that hey man so we're at
[46:42] the end time so that's why the things
[46:44] are being revealed the property got told
[46:47] I read it to you they're in the SEM and
[46:49] the sixth seal he says you're not
[46:50] getting it it's not for you now he's
[46:55] talking to them I'm not talking to you
[46:56] the day huh it is for us but he was
[46:59] looking down at 6l he said it's not even
[47:01] for you I'll read it again if you want
[47:06] me to but look in the sink sale he says
[47:07] right at the first probably right first
[47:10] 30 minutes of his sermon he said it's
[47:13] not even for you it's not even for you
[47:18] that's tough but see I can't say that
[47:22] today so this for us I'm talking to you
[47:25] know why it wasn't for them cuz I wasn't
[47:28] sitting in the congregation you wasn't
[47:30] sitting in the congregation you wasn't
[47:31] sending the congregation most do you
[47:35] weren't even born Lewis you weren't even
[47:39] born
[47:40] 1963 hey man that's what he was saying
[47:44] it's not for you it's for us coulda took
[47:49] sixty years to what quit worried about
[47:53] this and start worrying about this and
[47:56] then the thunders I want to hear the
[48:00] voice of God that's what the city that's
[48:05] what the thunders are there the voice of
[48:06] God when the seal breaks and I'm gonna
[48:09] say to you because that's an individual
[48:11] fair with God listen what you know what
[48:13] I do believe the seals are not broke if
[48:19] you say that they're not Amen somebody
[48:25] walked up to me and said I don't believe
[48:27] the seals broke I said okay now if they
[48:31] ask me they're gonna get a different
[48:32] answer cuz I say they're broke
[48:36] I say God's thundering now for 60 years
[48:39] he's been thundering through a group of
[48:42] Ministers live people
[48:48] hey man listen we play we match play all
[48:52] we want to but somebody's gonna have to
[48:54] look you in the eye and tell you what
[48:58] that prophet said it's not gonna bad
[49:04] tape recorders not gonna take me in the
[49:06] rapture hey man just wanted to touch on
[49:10] that a minute line ox man an eagle the
[49:16] holy ghost through the church agent now
[49:18] we've come to the First Church the first
[49:20] three Church ages in the first seal but
[49:23] we know that least that underneath those
[49:26] seals there is a plan of redemption that
[49:28] man has never looked into remember the
[49:31] prophet of God he whipped the top off of
[49:34] the white pyramid right took the cap off
[49:39] look down in there now look it wasn't
[49:42] stuff stuffed down in there did he
[49:45] didn't understand him say I look down
[49:48] there and it was written in a different
[49:49] language not at that moment not that
[49:51] time he looked down and he said white
[49:54] had never shown on this before so I
[49:57] learned a new Bible what a new
[49:59] revelation had come out of the Bible
[50:01] amen
[50:02] it was what was written in the Bible
[50:04] with light shining on it and then that's
[50:08] what we're sitting under right now we're
[50:12] not sitting in the manifestation of
[50:13] signs wonders and healing that comes
[50:16] with it that comes with it but I'm gonna
[50:21] tell you just like I told Clark last
[50:22] night we were talking on the phone pray
[50:24] for him and pray for ginger she had her
[50:26] Hitler play and she's having muscle
[50:28] cramps and boy without her I would say
[50:29] that hurts if you've had a hip
[50:30] replacement and your muscle started
[50:32] cramping so keep them in your prayers
[50:34] brother Claude has been a nurse and you
[50:35] don't have that anymore
[50:37] I hope he ain't watching this but anyway
[50:41] but just pray for him I told brother
[50:43] Claude and I've told him many times
[50:44] before you just wait Satan is not in the
[50:47] Baptist he's here he's trying to divide
[50:56] and conquer the bride of Jesus Christ
[51:00] so he's going to send Satan Superman
[51:03] riding our door no I'm not saying this
[51:05] door in the door of what we call the
[51:08] message you know what if he raises up a
[51:12] man that has so much signs and wonders
[51:14] and they all come to pass but he
[51:19] preaches you to Lord preach is just
[51:22] seventh under verse you Jesus wasn't God
[51:24] to the River Jordan he's only got to be
[51:25] off one word hey man one word is all
[51:29] he's got to be off and those signs and
[51:31] wonders to me would be nothing but you
[51:35] watch they're going to migrate to that
[51:38] person you wait and see because Satan
[51:39] Superman's coming here I'm sorry he got
[51:43] here for you did today he set his clock
[51:46] two hours ahead I came to look over and
[51:52] see him sitting beside you but I don't
[51:53] want anybody's feelings I no way it's
[51:59] okay but that's true we can't and that's
[52:04] why the seal was broke
[52:06] to show that sure yeah that Satan said
[52:09] Satan he's riding off but he was here at
[52:13] one time if he rode away from the
[52:15] Prophet he must have been pretty close
[52:17] when he started riding so I said he was
[52:21] real close in this church age when he
[52:23] started riding if this is all God's
[52:25] here's where Satan rode he rode right
[52:28] through the middle Evan you know what
[52:30] he's gonna ride all the way yeah brother
[52:36] Brown said he gets off the horse the
[52:40] horse keeps riding the horse keeps
[52:44] riding and I think I'll prove it to you
[52:48] next thing or Sunday afternoon so they
[52:50] got a little something there but anyway
[52:51] this is now I'm gonna go you're finished
[52:52] with this mystery of iniquity second
[52:55] Thessalonians 2 verse 7 says for the
[52:57] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[52:59] now let's just our solonian just already
[53:02] work only he now see it took a divine
[53:06] revealer of the word it took a prophet
[53:08] of God to tell us who that he was
[53:10] not only he God who now letteth will let
[53:16] he's letting this happen why is he
[53:19] letting this happen he's a just God and
[53:24] to be a just God he's got to give a
[53:26] choice amen
[53:27] for he now sorry one more time only he
[53:32] who now letteth will let until he now
[53:36] the prophet of God said that's us the
[53:38] bride be taken out of the way and that's
[53:42] true why because if when we're taking
[53:44] out of the way guess what happens right
[53:45] here we got the man standing here hey
[53:50] man we got the man which is called the
[53:53] Pope whenever you won't call him he's
[53:55] not a full manifestation until we leave
[53:57] and when we leave he's going to come in
[54:01] power amen
[54:05] because what's going to happen he's
[54:07] gonna incarnate the Pope you know why
[54:10] he's gonna incarnate the Pope remember
[54:13] he's a copycat Regina he has it God
[54:19] hasn't fully incarnated us yet we still
[54:25] got diverse talk about memories and
[54:27] conscious memories and conscious facts
[54:30] imagination that's where Satan does all
[54:31] this work we would talk about this other
[54:32] day but we're not fully retained okay
[54:37] but when we're fully redeemed God comes
[54:40] and incarnates a church a bride and then
[54:44] we take a body change and we walk over
[54:46] in another dimension Satan goes so
[54:49] that's how they do it hmm
[54:52] so that's how they do it I think now I
[54:55] go over there and I can get in that Pope
[54:58] memories a copycat he's gonna copy when
[55:02] God incarnates us and we leave he's gone
[55:05] Satan is gonna incarnate the Pope they
[55:08] been and he's gonna be the Beast
[55:14] to do his work but that's we're done we
[55:17] we got to get back here to the get back
[55:19] here to the first seal proverbs 16:6 is
[55:22] by mercy and truth iniquity is purged
[55:24] because remember they asked brother
[55:26] Branham said was the was second
[55:28] Thessalonians remember in the questions
[55:30] and answers on the seals it says brother
[55:32] Branham is second Thessalonians 2:7 the
[55:34] man of sin the breaking of the first
[55:36] seal he says yes okay so now how is he
[55:40] going to be destroyed proverbs 16:6 is
[55:42] by mercy and truth iniquity is purged
[55:46] amen when you purge the line something's
[55:49] in that line but you got to purge it you
[55:51] got to get it out Amen because remember
[55:54] we were born in sin shaping the iniquity
[55:56] alright and by the fear of the Lord men
[55:59] depart from evil all right so let's go
[56:02] to the next one and we looked up the
[56:06] word justification which as we were
[56:10] talking about before and we hit
[56:12] something the Bible study though tonight
[56:14] is you've got your holy holy
[56:16] I mean you got you out of court you got
[56:19] an inner court that's attached to the
[56:21] Holy of Holies and right here I'm just
[56:22] gonna make a big dot and I'm sorry it's
[56:24] black but that's the Holy of Holies
[56:26] that's where God is so you go through
[56:27] justification hello brother Dale see
[56:31] this is why I had to wait till he caught
[56:34] up I guess our God was waiting so that
[56:36] we can all be on the same page now he
[56:38] went through all that baby form
[56:40] justification sins chopped off right now
[56:44] he's got us right here at faith where we
[56:47] are now that to me this is this is that
[56:50] holy of holies that's what you're born
[56:52] again that's your faith that priest had
[56:55] to have so much faith and God said put
[56:58] on this put this color on put this on
[57:02] walk this way and if he did every bit of
[57:05] that he had faith that God wouldn't kill
[57:07] him when he walked in that holy of
[57:08] holies a man all right and when he
[57:11] walked in there the Shekinah glory came
[57:14] down and the whole nation was justified
[57:19] for a year talk about justification the
[57:23] whole nation was justified for a year
[57:27] but then that priest had to come out but
[57:31] in Old Testament he came out under blood
[57:34] of bulls and goats that look Richard I'm
[57:37] gonna grab this one put it back the
[57:39] blood of bulls and goats just covered
[57:41] what they were doing they were still
[57:44] under here doing the little sin right
[57:47] but when we go in that Holy of Holies
[57:50] now under the blood of Jesus Christ it
[57:54] wipes away
[57:55] it doesn't just justify us for a year
[57:58] hallelujah it justifies us for an
[58:01] eternity how strong is that blood but we
[58:07] don't stay in here we come out amen and
[58:13] in the statue of a perfect man we're
[58:16] going to walk right back through there
[58:17] again with what brother Dale is doing in
[58:19] this on Sunday morning so it's not it's
[58:25] not a justification that chopped off
[58:27] your past sins at this stage it's a
[58:31] justification to show that your being
[58:34] what being born again that God is moving
[58:39] stuff out of the way because look you
[58:41] got to remember if you're born again in
[58:44] your soul you're just as eternal as God
[58:46] is and if you pass away I hate the word
[58:50] die you know what you died in Christ the
[58:52] day you got the new birth hey man the
[58:55] Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise
[58:56] first
[58:57] no the dead in Christ that died before
[58:59] they fell asleep my brothers and sisters
[59:05] went home they're more alive now than
[59:07] they were I'm gonna tell you something
[59:09] folks I'm gonna put this in real quick I
[59:11] was sitting there's a guy on my mail
[59:15] route that he has a one of those you
[59:16] pick it places you know he has some
[59:19] muscadine Scuppernong blueberries
[59:22] strawberries blah blah blah and you just
[59:24] walk in and pick what you do and then
[59:26] walk out well he told me a couple years
[59:29] ago he wanted me to put some bees out
[59:31] there so I went yesterday for yesterday
[59:33] Friday was off and so I put five
[59:36] beehives out
[59:37] their new house and we were sitting
[59:39] there talking and he's just a really
[59:41] good guy nominal Christian he was
[59:43] sitting there weeping at what we were
[59:46] talking about and you know what he was
[59:48] telling me he says I know that my
[59:52] whatever it was aunt or uncle he's over
[59:55] in the place you know what he said that
[59:58] really struck me he said why wouldn't we
[1:00:02] want her to come back here well I would
[1:00:06] I'm talking about a nominal guy this is
[1:00:08] not about his believer he said she's
[1:00:11] that he said you know what he said God
[1:00:14] can't make her think bad thoughts over
[1:00:16] there I never thought about that
[1:00:18] when Gary Adkins went across the curtain
[1:00:20] of time he didn't he doesn't spend his
[1:00:23] days worrying what Rebecca's doing
[1:00:26] hey man why would you that's a place of
[1:00:29] bliss sure we know that we're gonna
[1:00:31] connect back but man what a revelation
[1:00:34] from a guy that we think well he don't
[1:00:36] go to Mexico so we got a revelation
[1:00:38] please you might have more than that
[1:00:42] staying here today but it was weeping he
[1:00:46] said she's not worried about my uncle
[1:00:49] she's and I thought you know what we
[1:00:52] don't think about things like that but
[1:00:54] when they go across the curtain of time
[1:00:55] they're not looking back going well I
[1:00:57] wished I was back there now my brother
[1:00:59] Brent went across the curtain time he
[1:01:00] didn't want to come back here so the
[1:01:05] former things he quoted me sketchy said
[1:01:06] the former things will pass away behold
[1:01:09] all things will be made new man so we
[1:01:13] might get a revelation everyone soif we
[1:01:14] listen to people he was just weeping
[1:01:17] sincere he said we'll see her one day
[1:01:19] he said she ain't hurt unless she was
[1:01:21] hurting before he I let him preach to me
[1:01:23] you know I'm a preacher but I shut my
[1:01:25] mouth listen for about an hour he did a
[1:01:28] good job all right so this justification
[1:01:32] we're talking about it's not this
[1:01:34] whether you go because look and hear to
[1:01:37] me and we gonna get nowhere and where I
[1:01:39] wanted to go but remember brother
[1:01:41] Branham said and I told you this is a
[1:01:42] wonderful revelation to me see the first
[1:01:45] seal broke to me you know what it told
[1:01:47] me I don't have to stand judgment
[1:01:50] I am justified in him and I don't have
[1:02:01] to stand the judgment so you can say the
[1:02:06] first seal revealed an across to you
[1:02:07] that's fine
[1:02:08] but it revealed to me that Jesus Christ
[1:02:11] so justified me till he took my soul
[1:02:15] cleaned it up and now the life of the
[1:02:21] very creator lives inside of me but now
[1:02:29] we're working towards something we can't
[1:02:32] do this don't stick your chest out and
[1:02:35] thank you something I'm something
[1:02:37] because God made me something I'm
[1:02:40] something because what he did because
[1:02:43] even in a type the whole of Israel Oh
[1:02:46] two or three million people depended on
[1:02:50] one old man to go back there not spill a
[1:02:55] speck of that blood to walk the way he's
[1:03:00] supposed to walk and to put that blood
[1:03:03] on the holy of holies and they were
[1:03:09] justified for a year but now that we
[1:03:13] went in the Holy of Holies we're not
[1:03:14] justified for a year those who he has
[1:03:16] justified somebody ain't not in the
[1:03:20] Bible okay alright so I'm quoting this
[1:03:22] in the Bible those who had testified he
[1:03:25] is already glorified but you know what
[1:03:30] I'm not satisfied with that because I'm
[1:03:32] still watch you stop I'm not glorified
[1:03:37] yet sorry I gotta get them go to work
[1:03:39] tomorrow some of you don't
[1:03:40] some of you a little more work fighting
[1:03:41] I am Barry I get them go to work
[1:03:42] tomorrow pay taxes and all those other
[1:03:44] things you know but in my soul I am
[1:03:47] redeemed completely but God is doesn't
[1:03:51] want you to stay that way he didn't want
[1:03:53] that he didn't want that priests to stay
[1:03:54] in there he didn't want me and you to
[1:03:57] stay in the holy holy no he broke the
[1:04:00] curtain back so that everybody sit
[1:04:04] so we come out into justification now
[1:04:07] what through the statue of a perfect man
[1:04:10] so he can burn out the trash if we're
[1:04:14] still alive if we're still breathing
[1:04:17] we've got a chance to make a body change
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:22] those are already going on they're
[1:04:26] waiting on us you know why because that
[1:04:30] place is full of faith we just have it
[1:04:33] spotty kind of like the old timey
[1:04:35] self-service we just had it every once
[1:04:37] in a while but over there they have full
[1:04:41] Wi-Fi because they're redeemed but their
[1:04:48] dead bodies waiting on to come back
[1:04:49] because they're not fully complete and
[1:04:53] then God wants us listen God wants us to
[1:04:57] live in a flesh body actually he does
[1:05:02] well he's already got he's he's leave
[1:05:04] anyone now it's glorified we're just
[1:05:07] detached from ours because you know what
[1:05:09] because we weren't the head he was and
[1:05:14] still yes I correct you somebody the
[1:05:18] other day they said oh brother branham
[1:05:19] was a prophet I said no he was not he
[1:05:23] still is we think they miss going on
[1:05:31] lost everything we lost our mind no he's
[1:05:34] still a prophet he said how do you know
[1:05:36] Samuel when the wind wind or brought
[1:05:39] Samuel up she sure recognized even a
[1:05:41] property guard said he still had his
[1:05:42] robe on his a his prophet robe own
[1:05:46] brother Bram didn't come down here just
[1:05:49] to be a prophet and then be nothing else
[1:05:50] no the millions of people said if you
[1:05:54] hadn't have come right but who did he
[1:06:01] point us to
[1:06:05] cuz that's the man he wanted to see I
[1:06:07] don't say you didn't care for the
[1:06:09] millions of people no it wasn't it but
[1:06:11] hit 40 say I want to see Jesus where's
[1:06:13] Jesus where Jesus said I want to see
[1:06:14] Jesus actually he wanted to see he could
[1:06:18] see these people but he couldn't see
[1:06:21] Jesus he said where's Jesus I want to
[1:06:22] see him he's always a little higher he's
[1:06:25] in another dimension in that seventh
[1:06:27] dimension he's up there with a glorified
[1:06:29] body but we come back out now we're
[1:06:31] going through the court again through
[1:06:32] justification so it has to be a higher
[1:06:35] form and we see the even baby form
[1:06:38] justification has to be a God work
[1:06:43] because remember one thing Satan will
[1:06:45] never forgive or forget your sin and
[1:06:52] he's not gonna let you forget him right
[1:06:56] man but we as the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:59] must have faith that in our soul is no
[1:07:04] sin zero just like the Genesis 1:26 man
[1:07:12] can you swallow this one I'm gonna chew
[1:07:14] it up a little bit Eagles just like
[1:07:17] Jesus what was in Jesus's soul is in
[1:07:21] your soul if not I told you before we
[1:07:30] beat people about one God and we'll get
[1:07:32] into it maybe later but we're the
[1:07:34] biggest bunch of tunas you ever seen in
[1:07:36] your life there's Jesus enough Jesus and
[1:07:41] us Jesus enough I thought through one
[1:07:44] this was what the Prophet said when God
[1:07:47] and Adam and Eve were in the garden that
[1:07:48] was one person we're gonna fill that new
[1:07:54] city we're gonna fill that new city and
[1:07:57] then people on the outside gonna walk in
[1:07:59] and they're gonna go you look like Jesus
[1:08:04] you look like your daddy you look like
[1:08:08] Jesus and they what they may want to
[1:08:11] talk to you
[1:08:15] huh aren't we little messiahs aren't we
[1:08:19] the Prophet laid a lot of labels on us
[1:08:22] that I don't think we believe yet
[1:08:25] Messiah well I want to see them myself
[1:08:31] now you can turn it look young turn look
[1:08:33] now turn look at the guy sister beside
[1:08:36] you amen
[1:08:37] little Messiah turn around look cuz
[1:08:43] there you are only Crocs this world's
[1:08:46] gonna season me and you that's why we
[1:08:48] had to come out and that's why we have
[1:08:50] to display that if the seals open amen
[1:08:59] alright let's cut through some of this
[1:09:01] stuff here we know that Isaiah 53 says
[1:09:05] by my righteous servant he shall justify
[1:09:07] many so it has to be a god thing God
[1:09:11] even in your baby form justification if
[1:09:13] he/she says Lord forgive me of my sins
[1:09:16] it has to be God that forgives you your
[1:09:19] sins amen
[1:09:21] and you'll never have to Lord a mercy
[1:09:25] like I said before many times I Drive by
[1:09:28] a place that I might have done something
[1:09:29] wrong and I go Lord forgive me and he's
[1:09:32] going wait wait come back we bring them
[1:09:38] back up I don't think God can't do he
[1:09:44] can't bring your sins back up amen even
[1:09:49] a prophet the prophet of God told us he
[1:09:51] said a few facts God to forgive your sin
[1:09:53] put it under the seal up under the blood
[1:09:55] I can't see it you know why cuz it ain't
[1:09:59] there Amen it ain't there that's why we
[1:10:06] taint justification is just a real weak
[1:10:08] form of the new birth it's a god thing
[1:10:12] and then as we get higher to show
[1:10:16] justification that the real one inside
[1:10:18] of you never did it
[1:10:19] Amen that's what we're heading toward
[1:10:22] but let's look at one more
[1:10:24] characteristic we know all this
[1:10:28] that in Romans 3 verse 19 I was telling
[1:10:33] you the other day that you know brother
[1:10:34] Brown
[1:10:35] he tells us he said justification baby
[1:10:38] form justification is when God chops off
[1:10:40] your past sins now he couldn't just get
[1:10:42] that from the air he had to get a
[1:10:45] revelation it was already in the Bible
[1:10:48] roll it up roll it on up but we've all
[1:10:52] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:10:53] God being justified freely by His grace
[1:10:55] through the redemption that is in Christ
[1:10:56] Jesus whom God has set for it to be a
[1:10:58] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[1:11:00] to declare his righteousness for the
[1:11:02] remission of sins that are past probably
[1:11:09] God didn't just grab it out of the air
[1:11:11] and say well I've just chopped off your
[1:11:12] patient no you read the Bible through
[1:11:15] the forbearance of God to declare I say
[1:11:19] at this time his righteousness that he
[1:11:21] might be just and the justifier that's
[1:11:25] you mean of him which believeth in Jesus
[1:11:29] hey man let's go let's skip a bunch
[1:11:32] because we remember we read this and
[1:11:34] cross the mystery we read an invisible
[1:11:36] union talking about that your sins was
[1:11:39] dead put away absolutely out of the
[1:11:41] existence even in the mind of God that
[1:11:44] you stand perfect but I want you to get
[1:11:46] something here one I want to read a few
[1:11:48] things on one God if you'll give me
[1:11:50] maybe ten minutes okay
[1:11:52] one guard Exodus 20 verse 1 through 5 go
[1:11:55] to that one brothers it's after quote
[1:12:01] number five we're gonna skip through
[1:12:04] five there ya go
[1:12:05] Exodus 20 verse 1 through 5 cuz we got
[1:12:08] look as brother Dale says many times
[1:12:11] before brother Branham tells us that
[1:12:13] this when the seals when the
[1:12:15] commandments came down the seals came
[1:12:17] down so that was the seals to the Jews
[1:12:21] was the ten commandments the Ten
[1:12:23] Commandments to the Jews of the seals to
[1:12:25] us okay
[1:12:25] just like the six fold purpose Daniel
[1:12:28] six full purpose does what redeems the
[1:12:31] Jews the six seals finishes our
[1:12:34] Redemption you saw no seven no the
[1:12:36] prophet said six seals finishes
[1:12:38] Redemption because he is the seventh
[1:12:40] seal and if the seventh seal breaks
[1:12:42] so are you will get that later
[1:12:45] all right look God spoke all these words
[1:12:47] saying I'm the LORD thy God which have
[1:12:48] brought thee out of the land of Egypt
[1:12:50] out of the house of bondage thou shalt
[1:12:52] have no other gods before me now look
[1:12:54] people this is in the Word of God the
[1:12:58] denominations read this every day every
[1:13:02] denomination and half of the
[1:13:03] denominations in this message you shall
[1:13:07] never keep me around long enough thou
[1:13:10] shalt not make unto thee any graven
[1:13:12] image or any likeness of anything now
[1:13:16] remember this is the first commandment
[1:13:18] right
[1:13:20] thou shalt not make any under the any
[1:13:22] graven image or any likeness of anything
[1:13:24] that is in heaven above that is in the
[1:13:26] earth beneath or that is in the water
[1:13:27] under the earth thou shalt now Bob bow
[1:13:30] down thyself to them nor serve them now
[1:13:32] look this got totally washed away in the
[1:13:37] church ages because they come up with
[1:13:40] sorry even maybe to like I said down a
[1:13:45] lot of people do to Lourdes I mean
[1:13:47] please people come on that's it -
[1:13:50] brother Brown said if you got - one has
[1:13:52] to be what Antichrist in Christ sorry
[1:13:58] thou shalt not bow down thyself to them
[1:14:00] nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am
[1:14:04] a jealous God now here see visiting the
[1:14:06] iniquity of the father's upon the
[1:14:08] children to the third and fourth
[1:14:09] generation of them that hate me that all
[1:14:13] right same answer that's your first
[1:14:14] that's your first pick it up here well
[1:14:21] now let's go to Deuteronomy 6 verse 4 I
[1:14:25] get my paperwork down here I'm gonna fly
[1:14:27] through this because we'll cover it in a
[1:14:29] couple of Sunday's here o Israel the
[1:14:31] Lord our God is to hear o Israel the
[1:14:37] Lord our God is two Lords three Trinity
[1:14:43] one the Lord our God is one Lord and
[1:14:48] thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[1:14:50] all thy heart with all thy soul with all
[1:14:52] thy might that are
[1:14:54] first john 5:18 very familiar we know
[1:14:59] that whosoever is born of God sitteth
[1:15:00] not whoa what he didn't say born here
[1:15:03] mama
[1:15:05] that didn't say born here mama that says
[1:15:08] he is born of God that's why you need to
[1:15:12] be born again cause yo you know what
[1:15:16] Jesus was telling Nicodemus he said look
[1:15:18] Nicodemus my birth was right
[1:15:20] yours was wrong so you need a new one so
[1:15:24] Nicodemus being carnal he says okay I
[1:15:26] got a googol back and do it over again
[1:15:28] getting my mama's womb come back no
[1:15:30] Jesus said no he should have said
[1:15:34] Nicodemus you made to be born of God he
[1:15:38] that whosoever is born of God now look
[1:15:40] there's your new birth then it's not
[1:15:42] there's no sin in the soul but he that
[1:15:46] is begotten of God keepeth himself
[1:15:53] there's the keeper my brother branham
[1:15:56] preached my god than not after that or
[1:15:58] they evening after that preaching that
[1:16:00] message he preached the God of my life
[1:16:03] that was his guide he preached the guide
[1:16:05] in the morning and the guide in the
[1:16:07] afternoon but he the begotten of God
[1:16:10] keeping himself and that wicked one
[1:16:12] touches him not in the soul he touches
[1:16:17] you in other words in other way memory
[1:16:20] reason continentally and we know that we
[1:16:23] are of God now looking John how pounds
[1:16:25] that we know that we're of God and the
[1:16:27] whole world lieth in wickedness and we
[1:16:30] know that the Son of God has come and
[1:16:32] have given us an understanding that we
[1:16:37] may know him that is true not three and
[1:16:41] we are in him that is true even in His
[1:16:47] Son Jesus Christ you so all I join
[1:16:49] you're a Trinitarian there's son and son
[1:16:51] of God and Son Jesus same one because he
[1:16:55] proves it right here this is the true
[1:16:57] God and eternal life I got all rights
[1:17:01] amen alright first seal watch this we're
[1:17:04] gonna get through these and maybe I've
[1:17:06] only been going in an hour the first
[1:17:08] seal
[1:17:09] brother Hao told me the other days to
[1:17:10] slow down so I understand what you're
[1:17:12] saying I'm slowing down a little bit
[1:17:14] more today not and they said now here's
[1:17:19] the wild horse now this is the first
[1:17:20] deal and a wild horse is the power and a
[1:17:22] charger a charger and he said the man
[1:17:24] who sat on him that was the white horse
[1:17:26] this now look this is what he's saying
[1:17:29] that the man that said on him that other
[1:17:32] people are saying the white horse was
[1:17:33] the Holy Spirit that went forth in the
[1:17:35] early Asian conquered that age for the
[1:17:37] kingdom of God he had a bow in his hand
[1:17:39] which meant like Cupid he shot the
[1:17:40] arrows of love into the hearts of the
[1:17:41] people the love of God he conquered roll
[1:17:44] it on all the way now that sounds very
[1:17:46] good but it isn't true it isn't the
[1:17:52] truth right he come to bring the
[1:17:55] property God come to bring us the truth
[1:17:57] amen
[1:17:58] not pursue me no it was a straight
[1:18:01] pipeline from God does a man that's why
[1:18:05] I said before brother Brian if you'll
[1:18:06] know no one I'm saying
[1:18:08] no one can correct brother Brennan no
[1:18:11] one except God himself
[1:18:12] there's no man stands between if you say
[1:18:14] brother Rams wrong then you put yourself
[1:18:16] between guarding him and what are you
[1:18:22] talking about an antichrist again look
[1:18:26] now watch why it does mean righteous and
[1:18:28] we realize that white means righteous
[1:18:30] the teachers taught it that it was the
[1:18:33] Holy Spirit conquering in the first page
[1:18:34] but now watch if this is a revelation to
[1:18:40] the first seal because he's fixing to
[1:18:43] tell you this it's not that Antichrist
[1:18:49] was the one horse rider but because he
[1:18:53] got the revelation that Christ in the
[1:18:57] Holy Spirit is the same person and only
[1:19:01] in a different form
[1:19:02] so here Krantz stands Christ the lamb
[1:19:05] and there goes a white horse rider with
[1:19:09] a rider on it this time tells us what he
[1:19:12] said my revelation of it by the Holy
[1:19:14] Spirit is not that way my revelation by
[1:19:17] the Holy Spirit is Christ
[1:19:19] and the Holy Spirit is the self-same
[1:19:21] person only in a different form so here
[1:19:25] stands Christ the lamb we know he was
[1:19:27] the lamb he stands here with the books
[1:19:29] in his hand and there goes a white horse
[1:19:31] riders see so it wasn't the Holy Ghost
[1:19:33] now that's one of the mysteries of the
[1:19:35] last day let me give you some strong
[1:19:41] meat if that first seal hadn't opened to
[1:19:44] you you can't preach God what Jesus
[1:19:47] wasn't God to the River Jordan you can't
[1:19:48] preach to lords you can't preach all
[1:19:50] these folks doctor you can't preach
[1:19:52] Father Son Holy Ghost is a Trinitarian
[1:19:54] doctrine but when that seal opens to you
[1:19:57] you can't when that seal opens you you
[1:20:01] see Christ and the Holy Spirit is the
[1:20:03] same person so what is the true
[1:20:05] revelation of the first seal
[1:20:07] Oh Brad the LORD thy God is what in
[1:20:14] Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same
[1:20:17] person now that's one of the mysteries
[1:20:20] of the last day of the Christ can be the
[1:20:22] three persons in one it's got three
[1:20:23] different perform people father son Holy
[1:20:25] Ghost being three gods as the
[1:20:27] Trinitarian tell us it is it's three
[1:20:30] extreme manifestations of the same
[1:20:32] person roll it up roll it up or you
[1:20:37] might call it three offices keep going
[1:20:39] and how could Christ be out there with a
[1:20:42] white horse conquering and standing here
[1:20:44] with a book in his hand it isn't so it's
[1:20:47] Christ notice now the Holy Spirit and
[1:20:49] the revelation and Christ the Holy
[1:20:51] Spirit is Christ in another form that's
[1:20:53] right notice it is a lamb that opened
[1:20:56] the book and the lamb is Christ and
[1:20:58] Christ is not seen any more from then on
[1:21:01] why he's in us the world will see me
[1:21:08] amore but you'll see me
[1:21:11] cuz I'll be with you even in you
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:19] sorry they mean to holler but there's
[1:21:23] the Thunder yeah yeah that's the thunder
[1:21:27] right the Thunder is a revelation
[1:21:30] contained in the seal not on the seal
[1:21:33] not the seal not this part Lord Satan
[1:21:39] done stole my seal he don't run off
[1:21:43] thank you he's gone he must have

[1:22:02] that was what came because of the
[1:22:04] revelation of that hey man so that's old

[1:22:46] raised two hundred fifty thousand people
[1:22:47] give their life to Christ and in one
[1:22:51] week he's preaching the greatest
[1:22:53] revelation since Jesus Christ walked on
[1:22:55] the face of there then he walks up on
[1:22:57] the sixth seal and he said y'all not

[1:23:39] was given him and went forth conquering
[1:23:40] and to conquer who did we find this
[1:23:42] fellow was Antichrist amen
[1:23:45] Matthew 24 now four and five and Jesus
[1:23:47] answering said unto them take heed that
[1:23:49] no man deceive you watch what he said
[1:23:53] for many shall come in my name saying I
[1:23:59] am Christ and shall deceive many listen
[1:24:02] they don't deny the name Jesus Christ
[1:24:05] they just slide him in as a second
[1:24:07] person of the Trinity that's what it is
[1:24:11] right there see it Antichrist
[1:24:14] there's your seal a man brother branham
[1:24:16] there's your seal but the revelation
[1:24:18] under that's what I want I want that one
[1:24:21] God revelation these fishing talk about
[1:24:23] right now hey man that's what I want I
[1:24:25] want to make sure that I have no other
[1:24:27] gods before me or behind me actually sin
[1:24:31] all right look here they open the seal
[1:24:36] and here he was just perfect now let's
[1:24:39] go the next one
[1:24:40] 1957 I will restore but they had to
[1:24:43] worship they had the worship of one true
[1:24:47] God now he's talked about the first
[1:24:48] Church agent in that little faction they
[1:24:51] set up in the program which maybe you
[1:24:53] historians know of making the Trinity
[1:24:55] three different gods they had one God to
[1:24:57] father with a long beard and I've seen
[1:24:58] this myself I seen the picture right at
[1:25:01] the Vatican I didn't see the Vatican but
[1:25:02] I saw the picture of the you know the
[1:25:04] father is the man with a cane like this
[1:25:06] the big long white beard I wouldn't want
[1:25:08] to go to a lockdown hey man when Jim
[1:25:12] backslidden went back to the Baptist
[1:25:14] Church one time she I said just one time
[1:25:19] we all know the story when the Lord
[1:25:22] saved my soul and brought me back to
[1:25:23] church the devil got in June and sent
[1:25:25] her out to the Baptist Church but it was
[1:25:28] it was a test and we both passed
[1:25:32] we both clashed hey man I plant for
[1:25:35] myself
[1:25:36] we both class that tail but she gave me
[1:25:40] a book one day they were it was they
[1:25:41] were going to do a series on
[1:25:43] experiencing God right and sure enough
[1:25:46] it man looked like he's about 150 years
[1:25:49] old like a Moses you know standing out
[1:25:51] like this with a long beard I don't want
[1:25:53] my guard to look like that my god looks
[1:25:56] like the gardener my man my god looks
[1:26:00] like the gardener that Mary Magdalene
[1:26:01] said what have you done with my Lord he
[1:26:03] looked 50 something years old he was
[1:26:08] changed back you think he's gonna be 150
[1:26:12] NS be eighteen to twenty no my god is
[1:26:15] eighteen to twenty years old if you call
[1:26:17] it old any of that but look that's the
[1:26:21] anchor that brings us back he's not even
[1:26:25] gonna look like that you said all about
[1:26:28] it now wait a minute that's what he look
[1:26:31] before he died but if that would have
[1:26:34] came back in front of Mary Magdalene
[1:26:36] because remember she didn't know him at
[1:26:37] eighteen to twenty years old that's why
[1:26:40] it was a hard thing for those disciples
[1:26:42] to walk with that man and then see a
[1:26:44] young guy walk up the - from a mass did
[1:26:47] not see an old man they saw a young man
[1:26:50] that's why they didn't I and he was so
[1:26:53] hid but he was hid in his youth this is
[1:26:58] Jeanne smiling we're getting older you
[1:27:00] know at 18 to 20 year old sounds good
[1:27:02] again but not on this side we're gonna
[1:27:06] bring it here a man with a father with a
[1:27:10] lone beard I see the picture in the
[1:27:11] Vatican they had another one god the son
[1:27:12] with a younger man and a little bird
[1:27:14] flying like a dove called the Holy Ghost
[1:27:16] now they lost sight thereof the true
[1:27:18] picture of the one true God God is not
[1:27:22] three guards now we remember that didn't
[1:27:24] happen right in here that happened as
[1:27:28] the saying
[1:27:29] then it became a deed then a doctrine
[1:27:33] man but it was a saying even in these
[1:27:36] streets the white righteous church that
[1:27:39] was on the earth had some people inside
[1:27:41] of there going
[1:27:43] now that Jesus he just can't he talk to
[1:27:46] a father so they must been some way up
[1:27:49] you know a tangible person up there in
[1:27:52] earth in heaven talking to this one and
[1:27:54] then on the river they was a dove look
[1:27:57] that was a dove came down and that made
[1:28:00] the three you see what I mean that's the
[1:28:04] saying then they went to Nicaea and it
[1:28:07] became a deed then it became a doctrine
[1:28:10] cuz I'm will read it to you in the
[1:28:12] church ages in the Bible the deeds of
[1:28:17] the Nicolaitans is not something brother
[1:28:18] Branham came up with read revelations
[1:28:21] two and three before two Sundays from
[1:28:24] now hazel off site God is not three
[1:28:27] guards guards one God God has three
[1:28:28] offices the Trinity I want to get to
[1:28:30] this I'm sorry for being a little own
[1:28:32] the Father Son and Holy Ghost but it
[1:28:34] isn't three different gods if it is
[1:28:36] we're pagan but that never started in
[1:28:39] the early church they no different from
[1:28:42] that it started in the middle age and
[1:28:45] other words coming up to here this is
[1:28:46] your middle age coming up to here it
[1:28:48] started when the unity of brethren was
[1:28:51] broken the love now of course we people
[1:28:53] today we believe that there's three the
[1:28:55] Father Son Holy Ghost is the three
[1:28:56] persons of one true God history officers
[1:28:59] not three guards but that same listen
[1:29:01] now we think that was ridiculous in the
[1:29:04] Catholic Church but we brought it right
[1:29:06] on down boy than Pentecostal started
[1:29:08] sliding under the bench he told them
[1:29:11] right there has come right down here at
[1:29:13] Pentecost and tore yourself to pieces
[1:29:16] because remember in the Pentecostal
[1:29:17] doctrine there's oneness trinity all
[1:29:21] kind of different things not one this
[1:29:23] I'm talk about Jesus only one like your
[1:29:25] finger one Amen set up another
[1:29:27] organization instead of coming like
[1:29:29] brethren we're brotherly love them with
[1:29:30] unity the first one began to see that
[1:29:33] the three persons of the Godhead was in
[1:29:36] one person Christ Jesus he was the
[1:29:38] manifestation of God in flesh not
[1:29:40] another man
[1:29:41] alright now let's read you think boy you
[1:29:45] know real wait y'all talk about
[1:29:47] denominations and Trinities and all this
[1:29:50] stuff yeah everybody believe God brother
[1:29:52] Brown was the Prophet right God sent
[1:29:55] that man to speak to us
[1:29:57] what was in the mind of God not his own
[1:30:00] thought right not his own thought when
[1:30:04] he was preaching the doctrines that was
[1:30:05] had to be straightened out that was God
[1:30:07] talking to us now I'm gonna take your
[1:30:10] scripture Matthew 28:19 go you teach all
[1:30:12] nations baptizing them the name of the
[1:30:13] Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:30:14] how would you baptize in the name of the
[1:30:16] Father and the name of the son the name
[1:30:18] of logos
[1:30:19] that's not even written in the scripture
[1:30:20] and I want some man now this is 1959 you
[1:30:25] say the Blessed Holy Trinity find me the
[1:30:27] word Trinity anywhere in the pages of
[1:30:29] God's Bible it's a man-made scheme an
[1:30:32] old dirty Church rag wrapped around to
[1:30:38] take the place of the SAP line of God's
[1:30:40] Holy Spirit there's no such a thing
[1:30:43] there's no such a thing you find it and
[1:30:46] come to me you're duty-bound to do it as
[1:30:48] a Christian if you find it it's not in
[1:30:50] God's holy writing and the Father Son
[1:30:52] and Holy Ghost is hatched out of hell
[1:30:57] there's no such thing as three God's now
[1:31:01] believe in the Fatherhood of God I
[1:31:02] believe in the sonship of God I believe
[1:31:04] in the Holy Ghost dispensation to God
[1:31:06] but it's the same God in every
[1:31:08] dispensation not three gone number 10
[1:31:12] let's go to number 10 and by all rights
[1:31:14] a man Revelation chapter 4 1961 this is
[1:31:18] 1961 now my precious brother I know this
[1:31:21] is the tape also and I don't get excited
[1:31:23] let me say this with godly love the hour
[1:31:25] has approached where I can't hold still
[1:31:27] on these things no more to close to the
[1:31:29] coming see trinitarianism is of the
[1:31:32] devil I say that thus saith the Lord who
[1:31:38] look where it come from it comes from
[1:31:42] the Nicene Council when the Catholic
[1:31:44] Church became in rulership the word
[1:31:47] Trinity is not even mentioned in the
[1:31:48] entire book of the Bible and as far as
[1:31:51] three gods
[1:31:51] that's from hell now look not two people
[1:32:00] look look right there he caught
[1:32:04] somebody's fault
[1:32:06] he caught somebody thought now do you
[1:32:09] say then do you believe that all these
[1:32:11] people that Trinitarians are of Heil no
[1:32:14] sir no sir
[1:32:17] I don't either but now telling you
[1:32:20] though if you become that right
[1:32:25] if you become that and you accept that
[1:32:27] as your doctrine and you've been taught
[1:32:29] truth
[1:32:29] well he's not but one place for that I
[1:32:32] believe they are Christians but the hour
[1:32:34] is approaching right now
[1:32:37] brother where they are sincerely wrong
[1:32:41] and brother Brown said you know that guy
[1:32:43] said I'm brother Ram I'm sincere he said
[1:32:46] you can be sincerely wrong right hey man
[1:32:51] let's go to number 11 second seal he's
[1:32:56] recapping the first seal but notice how
[1:32:58] they swap horse rider and I didn't
[1:33:00] underline any of these so I'll just have
[1:33:01] to read them with everybody all right
[1:33:02] say man ma'am all right number 11 let's
[1:33:09] read the whole thing now notice how they
[1:33:11] swap horse rider now we just background
[1:33:12] just a little till we hit this seal he's
[1:33:14] heading into the second seal now notice
[1:33:16] the wild horse rider when he went out he
[1:33:18] serves in three stages the devil as I
[1:33:20] proved to you the other night is Anna
[1:33:21] Trinity just like God but it's the same
[1:33:23] devil all the time in three stages
[1:33:25] notice his stages in the first stage he
[1:33:27] come in the Holy Ghost fell what no wait
[1:33:30] a minute the Holy Ghost fell we're
[1:33:31] Pentecost right here when the church age
[1:33:35] start that's what started the Gentile
[1:33:36] church age the Holy Ghost fell right
[1:33:40] here right hey your sleep okay I'm not
[1:33:50] talking that when I get finished I'm
[1:33:52] tired
[1:33:53] but I can't right now okay bear with me
[1:33:55] bear with me just a minute notice his
[1:33:58] stages in the first stage you come in
[1:34:00] the Holy Ghost fell and people had
[1:34:01] everything in common and the Spirit of
[1:34:03] God was upon them and the apostles went
[1:34:06] from house to house breaking bread with
[1:34:07] the people and there was great signs and
[1:34:08] wonders wrought and then the first thing
[1:34:10] you know here's your Wyler's writer the
[1:34:13] first thing you know Satan began to
[1:34:14] cause a murmur yeah I believe there's
[1:34:17] one God but now might be another person
[1:34:20] in there you know who's he talking to
[1:34:23] hey man I saw doctors get started people
[1:34:27] right
[1:34:31] my brother Dale said though when you sit
[1:34:34] in the service I'm gonna tell you how
[1:34:37] the Holy Ghost works you sit in the
[1:34:40] service and you hear some big-name
[1:34:41] preacher and most of them is big name
[1:34:43] preachers when you hear big name
[1:34:44] preachers preach a false doctrine then
[1:34:46] something inside of you doesn't rejoice
[1:34:51] and jump out and run out when something
[1:34:54] inside of you is like a light switch it
[1:34:57] clicked and what you've been taught
[1:35:01] comes to your head and it's the truth
[1:35:04] hey man we've been sitting where 600
[1:35:07] people got up and shouted about this guy
[1:35:09] preaching a certain doctrine about
[1:35:11] planting a natural seed and I like nasty
[1:35:14] stuff anyway there was a whole lot of
[1:35:17] people we just set there I wasn't gonna
[1:35:19] shout over nothing they shouted over a
[1:35:21] Trinity I'm not shouting over a false
[1:35:22] doctrine hey man I'm sorry you you'll
[1:35:26] learn one thing you stay in this church
[1:35:28] long enough we don't deal with false
[1:35:30] doctrine like most people do out the
[1:35:35] door cuz you know what false doctrine is
[1:35:42] what kept us here Satan began to cause a
[1:35:47] murmur to come up then after a while
[1:35:49] listen trust what's inside of you have
[1:35:53] you ever done something now they even
[1:35:54] out not like in the world but out doing
[1:35:56] something like your job or driving or
[1:35:57] something something go don't go that way
[1:35:59] don't do that
[1:36:01] right and
[1:36:03] I start talking to you just like you
[1:36:06] sitting here today and something saying
[1:36:08] that's right that's not and then because
[1:36:12] remember truth were always ringed with
[1:36:14] truth amen
[1:36:16] but if a trumpet brings an uncertain
[1:36:19] sound oh then after a while look these
[1:36:24] slaves and the poor of the land that
[1:36:25] received the Holy Ghost they went out in
[1:36:26] different places testifying they
[1:36:28] testified to their masters and after a
[1:36:31] while they began to come like army
[1:36:32] captains see the the people with a
[1:36:34] little authority and the different
[1:36:35] people the celebrity began to see the
[1:36:37] gallantry and the miracles and signs
[1:36:38] that these men done so they accepted
[1:36:41] Christianity well then you see when he
[1:36:43] embraced Christianity he goes there to a
[1:36:45] place where they're meeting in a little
[1:36:47] dark dingy hall clapping their hands
[1:36:49] shouting speaking in tongues getting
[1:36:50] messages why he could never take that
[1:36:52] back to his competitor or whatever it is
[1:36:54] in his business he'd never believe it
[1:36:56] like that
[1:36:57] certainly not so he's got to dress it up
[1:37:02] Satan attached itself to Christianity
[1:37:04] hey man so they began to get together
[1:37:10] and began to think now we'll form
[1:37:12] something a little different that's what
[1:37:16] a denomination means is a division a
[1:37:19] common what denominator now we'll form
[1:37:23] something a little different Jesus right
[1:37:25] immediately at the first church age he
[1:37:27] told them in the second chapter I have
[1:37:29] somewhat against you because these deeds
[1:37:32] of the Nicolaitans Nikko conquered the
[1:37:35] laity Nikko means conquer Lathan's is
[1:37:38] the lifting in other words they want to
[1:37:40] make instead of everybody be one they
[1:37:42] want to make some holy fellow they want
[1:37:44] to make some kind of they wanted to
[1:37:45] pattern it into paganism from where they
[1:37:47] had come out from and they finally done
[1:37:50] it now watch first nickel Alton the
[1:37:52] nickel anthem was called in the Bible
[1:37:54] Antichrist because it was against the
[1:37:57] original doctrine of Christ and the
[1:38:00] Apostles all right I know only once at
[1:38:03] the end time listen to this one now see
[1:38:07] this is a revelation under the seal that
[1:38:10] there's one true and living God and
[1:38:11] there is no compromise
[1:38:14] we've compromised down through the
[1:38:16] church agent there's no more compromised
[1:38:19] notice here's something real quick now
[1:38:22] we'll end up with our tall notice
[1:38:23] revelation 16:13 2:14 if you want to put
[1:38:26] that down I don't have time maybe to go
[1:38:27] into it and want you to be sure and see
[1:38:29] it now notice this is the sounding

[1:38:37] he'll put it in line now we'll close out
[1:38:39] just in a minute if you can just bear
[1:38:41] few more minutes longer thank you
[1:38:42] closing out now notice revelation 16:13
[1:38:45] I've got the prophets message said I'm
[1:38:47] going for a few more minutes okay
[1:38:48] between the sixth and seventh vial three
[1:38:50] unclean spirits we forget about that
[1:38:52] those three unclean spirits did you
[1:38:54] notice that went out of the mouth of
[1:38:57] someone now notice quickly you ready say
[1:39:00] man congregation says a trinity of
[1:39:03] spirit now denominational brother set
[1:39:07] still just a minute now this isn't only
[1:39:09] one this is 1965 now denominational
[1:39:12] brother set still just a minute don't
[1:39:14] get up and walk out of the room back out
[1:39:16] there on this radio telephone hookup
[1:39:18] don't turn your tape recorder off sit
[1:39:19] still a man listen you're born of God
[1:39:21] you will a Trinity of frogs a frog is an
[1:39:25] animal that always looks backwards he
[1:39:27] never looks where he's going he looks
[1:39:30] where he's come from see don't you see
[1:39:31] where was trinitarianism born at
[1:39:34] remember three unclean spirits
[1:39:36] individual spirits are you getting it
[1:39:39] congregation says they may have noticed
[1:39:40] they look back to the night and council
[1:39:43] where the Trinity doctor was born out
[1:39:46] not in the Bible there's no such a thing
[1:39:49] they look back to the Nicene counsel at
[1:39:51] Nicaea rome where the trinity was born
[1:39:54] at notice where they come from notice
[1:39:56] the Trinity of frogs come out of an old
[1:39:58] Trinity give birth to the new Trinity
[1:40:01] their mother what it come out of a
[1:40:03] Trinity the Dragons see the beast and
[1:40:05] the false prophet see that Trinity
[1:40:08] started as a saying they couldn't put it
[1:40:11] together they were just making
[1:40:13] statements then they got it together
[1:40:16] like brother L says you read you're not
[1:40:18] seeing the first 19 Council was not that
[1:40:21] whether Jesus was God they were talking
[1:40:24] about it but 300 years later they come
[1:40:27] up with Jesus
[1:40:28] being a separate identity from God and
[1:40:31] then if I would have stopped it
[1:40:35] it wouldn't went no further but they
[1:40:36] didn't cuz that horse rider had to do
[1:40:37] what he was supposed to do he had to
[1:40:39] ride through there because remember this
[1:40:41] age right here either began or ended
[1:40:42] around 300 and something ad so the
[1:40:46] Nicean council sit so you see now what's
[1:40:48] happening we're going into the ox and
[1:40:50] the second seal okay which is a labor
[1:40:54] which is the the red horse amen and the
[1:40:57] Trinity of frogs came out of an old
[1:40:59] training because remember listen what
[1:41:01] killed them people what killed them
[1:41:03] people in that Dark Age their doctrine
[1:41:07] the Trinitarian doctrine kill them
[1:41:11] people literally kill them and brother
[1:41:14] brown said nothing untold billions with
[1:41:17] their doctrine you don't have to
[1:41:21] physically kill somebody now just preach
[1:41:23] them a false doctrine and let them
[1:41:26] believe it we stand in a horrible place
[1:41:28] here I mean here if we're not preaching
[1:41:32] the truth then we're taking you to
[1:41:33] another God amen a trinity the dragon
[1:41:37] see the beast and the false prophet the
[1:41:38] Trinity knew why is it new because it
[1:41:41] didn't stay in the Catholic Church the
[1:41:44] Methodists accepted it the Baptist's
[1:41:45] accepted it the printe cultures accepted
[1:41:47] it they man but it wasn't manifested
[1:41:51] until between the 6th and 7th file just
[1:41:53] before the seals open to reveal it amen
[1:41:58] that's another hole that's another whole
[1:42:00] subject
[1:42:01] let's go last one and we're done
[1:42:03] anointing one same actually it's the
[1:42:06] same quote started where this is false
[1:42:10] prophet singular false prophet the first
[1:42:13] pope and from there came out the
[1:42:16] and the mother of harlots remember the
[1:42:17] false prophet is singular it was one but
[1:42:22] the mother of harlots is plural amen it
[1:42:28] was one man but when he started letting
[1:42:31] loose his doctrine it became the mother
[1:42:36] of harlots Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[1:42:40] Christian
[1:42:42] the whoring the mother of harlots the
[1:42:45] whole thing a false trinity was rising
[1:42:47] not in the early days wouldn't be made
[1:42:51] manifest in the early days it went right
[1:42:55] on through with it alright so he's still
[1:42:57] riding he's not got a whole lot of
[1:43:00] strength but he's fixing to gain more
[1:43:01] but he remember he's a bluff he's got a
[1:43:04] boat with no arrows he's a bluff he
[1:43:06] bluffed him into believing something
[1:43:07] they wasn't him in the Bible it went
[1:43:12] right on through it but when the seven
[1:43:13] seals become and opened those mysteries
[1:43:17] and reveal them that's when the frogs
[1:43:22] three unclean spirits like frogs came
[1:43:25] out to manifest itself because remember
[1:43:29] folks listen to what I'm saying if that
[1:43:33] prophet hadn't come and lined us back up
[1:43:35] to the word where would we be
[1:43:38] Presbyterian Baptist Baptist Baptist
[1:43:42] nothing Pentecostal and we'd still be
[1:43:46] going blessed holy trinity blessed holy
[1:43:48] trinity and somebody that we're in the
[1:43:50] Catholic sister Oh
[1:43:52] Anna's not here but you'd be going pray
[1:43:55] me out of purgatory claim out of
[1:43:56] purgatory I'm praying Oh youyou look
[1:44:00] excusing the Catholic Church plate
[1:44:02] praying to who marry a woman that's not
[1:44:05] throwing off on you guys I'm telling you
[1:44:07] but a woman being God the mother of God
[1:44:10] you see that unclean spirit what he done
[1:44:13] they came out to manifest himself a
[1:44:16] Trinity doctrine against the truth so
[1:44:21] when the Prophet and God opened that
[1:44:22] first seal this is just me I don't have
[1:44:25] a quote for it's just me this is brother
[1:44:27] Wade L quote when that first still open
[1:44:30] Trinitarian doctrine went out the door
[1:44:33] it wasn't accepted by God no more I
[1:44:39] ain't saying they weren't because look
[1:44:41] even FF Bosworth the old oak tree he's a
[1:44:45] Trinitarian but he had faith in what
[1:44:49] part of the word he could see hey man
[1:44:51] all those listen brother Brian was
[1:44:54] preaching to 90%
[1:44:55] trinitarian right and did they all come
[1:44:58] out no nois when he said on the six on
[1:45:02] the the questions and answers on the
[1:45:04] Silph he said go on as you are right
[1:45:08] don't try to twist this thing up cuz
[1:45:11] it's not for you
[1:45:13] but people it's for us we can if Paul
[1:45:20] was sitting here today he would not be
[1:45:22] asleep if I rainiest was here he would
[1:45:27] not be asleep you say oh poor old
[1:45:30] Columbo he just barely got through the
[1:45:31] age poor Oh Luther he's sitting a beer
[1:45:33] and sitting a pub and drink beer and
[1:45:36] smoke the pipe and talked about God you
[1:45:38] know what that was his time but if he
[1:45:39] was sitting around here today you
[1:45:41] couldn't you couldn't keep him in that
[1:45:43] seat he says so that's what that
[1:45:46] justification did for me I only saw
[1:45:49] about that much of it ball you broke a
[1:45:53] whole world open now see where did it
[1:45:57] come from see where it's going back to
[1:46:00] ecumenical council because that's what
[1:46:03] happened here it was an ecumenical
[1:46:04] council and what's it gonna end up as an
[1:46:07] ecumenical council but what they're
[1:46:11] gonna do then sorry what they did then
[1:46:13] was is they had a pope with successions
[1:46:16] and they thought this and they had to
[1:46:17] babish and they had this but listen now
[1:46:19] this ecumenical council now he's gonna
[1:46:21] put everybody together with one guy
[1:46:26] that's the danger but it's not danger to
[1:46:30] me in here because we're not going to
[1:46:32] see it right we're not gonna see the
[1:46:35] Antichrist incarnate the Pope will be
[1:46:37] gone but we're seeing the effects of it
[1:46:40] we're seeing these horses continue to
[1:46:43] ride even in this message they can't get
[1:46:45] one dog right they're all brothers
[1:46:51] anyway same spirits same thing and watch
[1:46:55] so deceiving musicians come so deceiving
[1:46:58] performing miracles that's why I just
[1:47:00] had performing miracles
[1:47:03] and these are Devils that go forth to
[1:47:06] all the gods of the earth working
[1:47:08] miracles to deceive them in the last day
[1:47:12] and we'll succeed in doing it but not to
[1:47:20] the true church not to the true bride we
[1:47:23] are sealed away from that like I said
[1:47:31] before keep this thing out of the way
[1:47:35] put that back in there for other reasons
[1:47:37] thank you we're gonna sit and watch this
[1:47:44] happen folks but we're not gonna be
[1:47:48] participating in it right we're not
[1:47:52] gonna be participating in it but we're
[1:47:53] gonna watch this happen but you know
[1:47:56] what we're gonna watch we're gonna watch
[1:47:57] with a full revelation we're gonna watch
[1:48:00] with the fullness of God like never had
[1:48:01] been before because remember Satan never
[1:48:04] never he tempted Jesus service is not
[1:48:11] over yet he tempted Jesus amen but Jesus
[1:48:15] never succumbed any of that right that's
[1:48:23] same spirits in you
[1:48:25] hello that same spirits in you that's
[1:48:29] what you get to overcome with that's
[1:48:32] what we're gonna talk about in a couple
[1:48:33] of Sunday's I'm gonna go one more time
[1:48:34] on the first seal but the first seal to
[1:48:36] me shows the true revelation of one God
[1:48:38] where the Trinity came from where this
[1:48:41] demon was and where he's going but also
[1:48:44] like I said Bible study the seals to me
[1:48:47] is very simple it tells me where I come
