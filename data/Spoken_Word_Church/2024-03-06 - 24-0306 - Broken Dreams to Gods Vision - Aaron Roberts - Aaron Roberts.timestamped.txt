[0:01] thank you all right get get over the
[0:03] nervousness right quick um I want to say
[0:06] this first my brother um my brother in
[0:08] Christ I was talking to him the other
[0:10] day and he said um he didn't know this
[0:12] was on my heart but I sometime I want to
[0:15] come up and testify but then that little
[0:17] feeling come over me like I want I want
[0:19] people think I'm prideful and it's all
[0:20] about me it's not but that came over me
[0:23] and um I was struggling for a while so
[0:25] my brother he didn't he didn't know I
[0:27] was going through this for a while so he
[0:28] said um he start saying he said you know
[0:32] sometime when you in church Satan make
[0:34] you feel like uh you know it's too much
[0:37] if you come up and testify he said but
[0:39] you know what you know what he tell
[0:40] everybody else that God isn't moving I
[0:43] said wow I didn't think about it that
[0:44] way you know so I said well I'm going
[0:45] make it my point to start trying to
[0:47] testify more all right
[0:49] so uh I had a customer I'm not with him
[0:54] anymore
[0:55] and uh a while ago I made a vow to God
[0:58] about something
[1:00] and um the lifestyle I was in when I was
[1:03] growing up I I went down the wrong lane
[1:05] and I got involved in
[1:08] prostitution and when I was dealing with
[1:11] different people I would see men give
[1:15] stuff to women they act like they care
[1:17] about you but they would give stuff to
[1:18] women and then when they get tired of
[1:20] you they move on to the next so that
[1:22] affected me that with my relationship
[1:24] with men I start feeling like oh they
[1:26] don't really mean what they say cuz
[1:27] they're just going to move on to the
[1:28] next so I couldn't respect gifts anymore
[1:31] and even up to this day I struggle with
[1:32] that like if somebody give me something
[1:34] not really a woman but if a man would
[1:36] give me something I would struggle with
[1:38] does he mean it or is it just you know
[1:42] that that just crazy feeling so
[1:45] anyway I was at a um the lifestyle God
[1:49] just got me out of when I came back to
[1:50] Christ I had certain I was dealing with
[1:53] a man and that's who I got my youngest
[1:55] son by and um he gave me a necklace and
[1:59] and it was a very nice necklace and I'm
[2:02] not really in the jury that much like I
[2:03] was but he gave me a necklace and when I
[2:06] came to Christ when God started dealing
[2:07] with me I got rid of it because it start
[2:09] I just didn't you know wasn't right I
[2:10] felt that way so I got rid of it and um
[2:15] I told God I said Lord I'm not accepting
[2:17] any more jury from any man unless it's
[2:20] my
[2:21] husband so um I kind of said it and I
[2:23] forgot about it well I was at a customer
[2:25] house and he said um one day I was I was
[2:28] cleaning up and he came in there he
[2:30] said' do you wear jewry I said' uh I
[2:32] said' no not really not too much anymore
[2:35] and I kind of told him um I always was
[2:36] sharing my testimony with him about my
[2:38] past and stuff and how God delivered me
[2:40] so I said um I said no I really don't
[2:42] wear a jewelry like that no more I said
[2:44] um and plus I'm healing over a lot of
[2:45] things too so if I accept anything it's
[2:48] going to be from my husband that's what
[2:49] I told the Lord so anyway I kind of left
[2:52] it at that and he called me he said hey
[2:54] come here for a minute um come sit right
[2:56] here so in my mind I'm like oh God you
[2:58] know okay what what what what you know
[3:00] sit in this chair just sit right here
[3:02] I'm like well what I don't like
[3:03] surprises he said well just sit right
[3:04] here I got something for you so in my
[3:06] mind I'm like oh Jesus you know help me
[3:08] whatever this about to be you know so I
[3:10] sat down and he came up from behind and
[3:12] put something on my neck and it's like a
[3:14] um a very pretty necklace so I'm like oh
[3:17] God I'm not really into it I'm not I
[3:20] don't need you know I just he said well
[3:21] I just want to help you to heal you know
[3:23] and I I appreciate your walk with Christ
[3:25] and I've been noticing how you know good
[3:26] you're doing and you know I'm like okay
[3:29] so my I'm reasoning I said well you know
[3:32] the Bible do say know at least you do
[3:33] under me you do it to you know you do it
[3:35] under God so I said maybe I can accept
[3:36] it under that but I got up and I said
[3:39] well thank you so I'm moving around in
[3:41] I'm moving around in the um I I get up
[3:44] and I go in the bathroom and everything
[3:45] and I'm looking at this necklace on my
[3:47] neck and it's glistening and it's
[3:49] shining I'm like man it's just it's
[3:50] funny I don't even feel right but it's a
[3:52] nice necklace you know it's shining and
[3:54] glistening and I said man but it don't
[3:56] feel right it feel heavy and I I feel
[3:58] burdening with it on so um I'm like well
[4:01] I don't want to hurt his feeling but
[4:03] anyway I was like well maybe I can just
[4:06] give it to Isaac or something you know
[4:08] so something came into my mind I was
[4:10] like man you remember that vow you made
[4:12] about you're not going to accept any
[4:13] jury from any man right that's not your
[4:16] husband so I was like oh yeah I did say
[4:18] that so um I was like okay well I'm
[4:22] going have to give it back to him so I
[4:24] took it off well first of all I was like
[4:26] man this necklace feels so heavy on my
[4:28] neck I'm feeling I'm I'm going through
[4:30] all these different emotions about it I
[4:31] said I ain't even got out the house yet
[4:33] it's been 10 minutes and I don't even
[4:34] the necklace feel heavy you know so um I
[4:37] said well I'm not going I'm not going to
[4:39] accept it I just took it off and I put
[4:40] it back in the box and um I went back in
[4:42] there where he was I said can I talk to
[4:44] you for a minute he said uh sure I said
[4:46] well I can't accept this um I said I I
[4:49] just want to remind you I made a vow to
[4:51] the Lord I said maybe if you was a
[4:53] female it might have been different I
[4:54] might have felt that a little different
[4:55] about it but you're a man and I told God
[4:57] I wouldn't accept it from any man that's
[4:59] not my husband usand so he said well you
[5:01] know I'm giving it to you as a gift and
[5:02] you know D I said well no I I can't do
[5:04] it so left it at that and that was it
[5:07] but um I just want to say God will test
[5:09] you when you make a vow to him somehow
[5:12] it'll come back around and you'll be
[5:15] tested based on what you told him you
[5:16] know so I thought about that like wow if
[5:19] you're going to make a vow he will come
[5:21] back around somehow and see if you
[5:23] really meant what you said so that's it
[5:28] you

[12:27] sister
[12:30] that girl she's been there for us for so
[12:35] many things y'all don't
[12:41] understand
[12:44] and she loves us so much oh my
[12:49] God God forgive me Jesus I'm so
[12:53] sorry anyway
[12:56] so
[12:57] um I've been having this um since I sung
[13:02] the last
[13:04] time I've been
[13:07] happy for some reason I don't know
[13:12] why I've just been happy and
[13:16] um I'm starting to understand how God
[13:19] works and things like
[13:23] that and um I've been there done that
[13:27] like um sister Rebecca said you know
[13:30] prostitution and all I never did that
[13:33] but you know I've been there I lived in
[13:36] Atlant I lived all that life but let me
[13:39] tell you all you young
[13:41] people you can have all the money in the
[13:43] world but that's
[13:45] nothing it's nothing I'm telling you
[13:48] you'll regret it it's nothing the only
[13:52] place I found safe is here and God Jesus
[13:56] if I could if I only listen to my oldest
[13:59] sister when she you know she would tell
[14:01] us to come to church I promise
[14:04] yall this is the only place you
[14:07] safe I promise you it might seem boring
[14:11] and all that stuff and it's okay they
[14:14] can say you're boring and this and that
[14:16] I can tell you right now it doesn't
[14:19] matter you'd rather be boring here but
[14:22] as long as you know you're going
[14:25] to heaven that doesn't matter amen I
[14:30] promise you really doesn't I should have
[14:33] listened and looked at my sister for a
[14:35] long
[14:36] time anyway my thing
[14:40] is we and I know we probably have to
[14:43] leave early because she has to go early
[14:46] but anyway
[14:50] um she's my older sister is the reason
[14:53] why I moved down here and I had to move
[14:56] down here because Atlanta was not for me
[15:00] and I don't have any children and I had
[15:03] all the money in the world to do
[15:05] whatever I wanted to do that girl would
[15:08] tell me listen just do the right thing
[15:12] just come down here all you young people
[15:15] listen to
[15:18] me partying and doing all that going to
[15:22] the clubs and all that I've done it
[15:24] all there's nothing in it
[15:29] I promise you there's nothing in it you
[15:32] will regret it and then being a female
[15:35] oh I promise you you'll regret it I have
[15:39] found peace
[15:42] here I promise you I have found peace
[15:45] here I'm still struggling with things

[16:15] disappeared I don't even want to do like
[16:18] everything I do I don't want to do
[16:20] anything wrong
[16:22] like and me being military I'm a veteran
[16:25] I have really bad PTSD like that's tough

[16:31] me
[16:32] before ever thank you Lord ever and last
[16:38] night God showed me that my oldest
[16:42] sister

[16:52] know anyway let me stop and just I'm
[16:55] going to sing as a dear pan for we we
[16:58] have to leave has to go home but I just
[17:02] had to say that

[17:12] older sister being an angel trying to
[17:15] protect this whole
[17:18] building

[28:22] uh I'm not saying
[28:25] anything I'm not thinking I'm not
[28:27] thinking anything either praise the Lord
[28:30] but anyway um we's see how this thing
[28:33] works but uh tonight if you have your
[28:36] Bibles we're going to go Genesis chapter
[28:41] 37 and
[28:44] uh want to look at a little thought
[28:47] tonight but
[28:50] uh want to say uh I appreciate all of
[28:56] the all all of the Brethren here our
[29:00] deacons and the work they put in amen

[29:12] and and our uh our new pastor
[29:16] here appreciate
[29:22] him
[29:24] amen so uh
[29:27] I want to look at a little thought
[29:28] tonight um this is uh looking at the
[29:32] life of Joseph but uh I was I was
[29:34] reading something and uh this this
[29:37] thought come to me and uh I I like this
[29:41] but uh Broken Dreams to God's
[29:45] vision and uh before we read the
[29:48] scripture not can y'all see that does
[29:50] that look good does that look
[29:52] okay well good I trying to make sure it
[29:55] got big enough but then the problem is
[29:58] is you got to keep making and and
[30:01] PowerPoint you got to keep making
[30:03] more screens because you just got to
[30:06] keep make adding more of them because
[30:08] everything gets so large you got to keep
[30:10] changing
[30:13] everything I can scroll
[30:18] sideways so and the problem is is the
[30:21] problem I was having is usually on
[30:23] PowerPoint you can see the pre the next
[30:26] line of screen I can't see any of
[30:29] my so I don't know what so just show you
[30:32] just show y'all how to do this what I
[30:34] done was when I get to a certain spot I
[30:37] just put a blank screen in that's where
[30:38] I know that's I'm supposed to
[30:42] stop it's like take a
[30:45] break so that's that's how I figured it
[30:47] out but you know brother Anderson W I
[30:51] told I promised brother and said I was
[30:53] going to do this tonight so it didn't
[30:54] matter what I was going to do this even
[30:57] if I had to draw it on or Draw it on a
[30:59] chalkboard or something hold it up it'd
[31:01] be it'd be different they wouldn't be
[31:02] doing it in the back so uh but the
[31:06] Lord's good to
[31:07] us like where they say where there's a
[31:09] will there's a
[31:11] way amen so let's just all bow our heads
[31:14] and uh speak to the author tonight
[31:17] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord this
[31:19] time Lord to be in your house Lord to
[31:22] gather with those of like Precious faith
[31:23] and Lord we just pray that you have your
[31:25] will and way with us tonight come on
[31:27] them scene Lord Jesus we know that
[31:29] you're here because you said where two
[31:31] or three are gathered in my name I'm
[31:32] there in the midst and Lord we know that

[31:46] we just commit all things to you in the
[31:48] name of Jesus Christ amen amen Genesis
[31:53] 37 beginning at verse one it says and
[31:56] Jacob dwell in the land where wherein
[31:58] his father was a stranger in the land of
[32:00] Canaan these are the generations of
[32:03] Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was
[32:05] feeding the flock with his Brethren and
[32:07] the lad was with the sons of BHA and
[32:10] with the sons of Zila his father's wives
[32:13] and Joseph brought unto his father their
[32:16] evil
[32:17] report now Israel loved Joseph more than
[32:20] all his children because he was the son
[32:23] of his old age and he made him a code of
[32:26] many colors and when his Brethren saw
[32:29] that their father loved him more than
[32:31] all his Brethren they hated him and
[32:33] could not speak peaceably unto him and
[32:36] Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to
[32:38] his Brethren and they hated him yet the
[32:40] more and he said unto them here I pray
[32:43] you this dream which I have dreamed for
[32:45] behold we were binding sheaves in the
[32:47] field and lo my sheath arose and also
[32:50] stood upright and behold your sheath
[32:53] stood round about and made OB asence to
[32:56] my sheath and his Brethren said unto him
[32:58] shalt thou indeed Reign Over Us and
[33:01] shalt thou indeed have dominion over us
[33:04] and they hated him yet the more for his
[33:06] dreams and for his words and he dreamed
[33:09] yet another dream and told it to his
[33:12] Brethren and said behold now that's what
[33:15] it's interesting you tell a dream
[33:17] somebody and they get mad and it's like
[33:20] um I ain't telling no more
[33:23] dreams it's like you know I'm stirring
[33:25] up stirring up trouble
[33:28] but you know you know brother R was
[33:30] talking about
[33:32] Joseph and all the midst and everything
[33:35] God Joseph could see in his life through
[33:38] the things that he went through that God
[33:40] was with
[33:41] him we know that he was a spiritual one
[33:44] he was a type of Christ but God began to
[33:46] deal with Joseph in a way that when he
[33:49] saw these things take place it wasn't
[33:51] about him but it was but he was showing
[33:54] them the vision of God what God's plan
[33:57] was but they didn't but they didn't see
[34:00] that they just saw he was trying to make
[34:01] him make something out of himself and he
[34:04] said I Dreamed a Dream more and behold
[34:06] the Sun and the Moon and the 11 stars
[34:08] made obeisance to me and he told it to
[34:11] his father and to his Brethren and his
[34:13] father rebuked him and said unto him
[34:16] what is this dream that thou Hast
[34:18] dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy
[34:21] Brethren indeed come to bow down
[34:23] ourselves to thee to the
[34:25] Earth and his breath
[34:27] envied him but his father observed the
[34:31] saying amen God bless you this evening
[34:33] you have your
[34:34] seats and uh just want
[34:39] to look at this for a little
[34:43] bit and
[34:45] uh we all know the story of of Joseph
[34:48] and
[34:49] his and his Brethren and the life that
[34:53] he lived and but just to kind of give a
[34:57] little bit of a background and you know
[35:00] we look at
[35:01] the understanding the life of Joseph and
[35:04] we go back
[35:06] to uh looking at his mom and
[35:09] dad and you know you see Jacob and and
[35:15] Rachel and you know we see the the the
[35:18] situation that
[35:21] um when when Jacob was running from Esau
[35:25] and he went to go see his his uncle laan
[35:29] and met met some more of the family
[35:32] there and he began to uh as he was
[35:35] staying there began to uh live in
[35:37] fellowship with them you know laan
[35:40] wanted
[35:41] to bless him and uh wanted to have
[35:45] something for him and and in the midst
[35:47] of all that you know uh he asked him you
[35:51] know what kind of wages would he want
[35:53] and you know they worked out they worked
[35:55] out an agreement that Jacob was going to
[35:57] work because he had met Rachel and you
[36:01] know he was in love with her and and no
[36:03] doubt she was in love with him and you
[36:05] know he worked out a deal to work you
[36:07] know work the seven years that that time
[36:09] for uh Rachel and we know that in the
[36:13] midst of all that time he was working to
[36:16] gain Rachel you know the scripture tells
[36:18] us that you know it was just like a few
[36:20] days it just a short period of time that
[36:22] he worked those years to gain Rachel but
[36:25] we know that his father-in-law pulled a
[36:27] quick one on him and he ended up with
[36:31] Leah and you know and you know because
[36:34] laan said well you know that's that's
[36:36] not customary to for the younger one to
[36:38] get married before the firstborn and so
[36:41] you know he had to he had to take that
[36:44] and you know you you look at the life of
[36:47] of
[36:48] Rachel and you see that you know here
[36:52] you here you are because the scripture
[36:55] never really tells us that much about it
[36:56] but you think you know you are in love
[36:59] with this
[37:00] man and you know you you want to get
[37:03] married and then all of a sudden your
[37:05] sister ends up in the place that you
[37:07] want to
[37:09] be and there she is standing there
[37:11] looking at this situation where you know
[37:15] she's in my place and that's where I
[37:17] want to
[37:19] be and no doubt that was a heartbreaking
[37:21] thing for Rachel to be there to be in
[37:24] this situation that Leah's where she was
[37:26] at
[37:27] and and you know but then you know he
[37:29] went and Jacob went and talk to laan
[37:32] about it you know he's like why did you
[37:34] deceive me and he's like well if you
[37:37] want if you want Rachel you're going to
[37:38] have to work another seven years and so
[37:40] you know he he works it out where he
[37:42] works another seven years to gain
[37:45] Rachel and you you see all the way all
[37:47] through the scripture between laan and
[37:50] and Jacob there's always this contention
[37:52] going on we see how they're all the time
[37:54] working you know because even in the end
[37:56] Jacob stand standing up there saying you
[37:57] know I've worked for you for seven years
[37:59] for Leah and seven years for Rachel and
[38:01] six years for cattle and you've changed
[38:03] my wages 10
[38:05] times right and it's like you know like
[38:08] they say you know don't do business with
[38:12] family because you know sometimes that's
[38:14] that's the hardest people to try to deal
[38:16] with but you know he worked all the way
[38:17] through that but you you see how that
[38:20] was a it was no doubt a heartbreaking
[38:22] situation for Rachel to be in and then
[38:24] when you see later on that when
[38:27] God recognized that Jacob loved Rachel
[38:30] so much more than Leah that he opened
[38:33] her womb and closed Rachel's when she
[38:36] became bar and and Leah was able to Bear
[38:39] children well you know that was a
[38:40] heartbreaking thing for Rachel to go
[38:42] through because here she is and and even
[38:44] she comes to Jacob at one time and tells
[38:47] him says give me children and he's like
[38:50] can I take the place of God that's
[38:52] something that God does I don't have
[38:53] anything in control over that but he saw
[38:57] that but you know when she began to cry
[39:00] and she had this heartbreak that she was
[39:01] going through this travail that she went
[39:03] through and after all those different
[39:05] five or six Sons that came through that
[39:08] that Leah had born and then she come up
[39:11] with this great idea I'll just give my
[39:14] handmade over to Jacob so I can have
[39:18] children through
[39:20] her and then when you if you want to see
[39:23] sibling rivalry you begin to read the
[39:25] scripture and you see and then all of a
[39:27] sudden Rachel says well I'm going to
[39:29] have children to to bring unto me
[39:31] through my handmade well then Leah sends
[39:33] her hand made to Jacob and says well I
[39:36] can do the exact same
[39:40] thing and what mean she already had
[39:42] children what was what was what was the
[39:44] motive behind doing that
[39:47] right but it was like it was like just
[39:50] like I'm this something I can stick I
[39:52] can stick you with you know I can put
[39:54] this in front of you you know it's just
[39:55] like always time poking and so here she
[39:58] is she's doing this but you know it
[40:00] never satisfied Rachel she still had
[40:03] that longing for
[40:04] children and she after after she went
[40:06] through all this and all the things that
[40:08] she had went through and saw all these
[40:10] things then the scripture tells us that
[40:12] God opened the womb of Rachel because he
[40:14] hearkened unto her because of what she
[40:16] had been through she had seen all these
[40:17] things and he opened her up opened up
[40:20] her womb and she brought forth a
[40:23] son after all she had been through all
[40:25] the struggles all the pain all this and
[40:27] she brings forth a son
[40:30] Joseph and she was so happy that she
[40:33] received a son Joseph and she said now
[40:35] God has rolled away my reproach because
[40:37] now I'm able to bring bring forth
[40:41] children and you know we look at we look
[40:43] at the great matriarchs of of the Old
[40:46] Testament of of the children of Israel
[40:48] we look at the lives that they live but
[40:50] you know you look at the struggle and
[40:52] the pain that she went through I mean
[40:54] here's here is a a woman woman that had
[40:57] went through all of this and no doubt
[41:00] she had spent many nights walking away
[41:04] crying because she wanted something and
[41:07] everybody else had that she didn't
[41:10] have and here she is but she was able to
[41:14] bring forth the son and then she brings
[41:18] forth one son and the scripture tells us
[41:21] that Jacob loved Joseph more than he
[41:23] loved any of the rest of
[41:25] them now you know parents you know they
[41:28] always talk about parents not having
[41:30] favorites well you know what Jacob
[41:33] didn't hold that back he didn't he
[41:35] didn't try to hide the fact that he
[41:37] didn't have a
[41:39] favorite oh I just love all my children
[41:42] the same you
[41:45] know but Jacob saw there was something
[41:47] special about
[41:49] Joseph the script you know brother Brown
[41:52] said one time he was talking about all
[41:53] the all the Patriarchs were good men but
[41:56] he said there was something different
[41:58] there was something special about Joseph
[42:00] he was a he was a special man but you
[42:02] know Jacob saw all of that and here she
[42:05] was she went Rachel went through all
[42:06] this brought forth a
[42:08] son and you you look at here he here he
[42:11] was she she brought
[42:13] forth this son watched him grow up to be
[42:16] 17 years old the scripture here talks
[42:18] about him being 17 years
[42:20] old just just in the prime of his
[42:24] Youth and you know his his father had
[42:26] give him a a coat of many
[42:29] colors but God had had a work for him to
[42:32] do and had a special place for him and
[42:34] we know that through the scripture God
[42:36] began to show him things and he began to
[42:38] speak to the family of the things that
[42:41] he had seen and you know as he begins to
[42:44] tell about the dreams that he saw about
[42:47] what was going to take place and you
[42:50] know then everybody be his his brothers
[42:53] didn't like him to begin with because
[42:55] you know he was he was the like the
[42:57] youngest and you know that's Daddy's
[42:58] favorite he's Daddy's pet and you know
[43:01] he can't ever do any wrong and you know
[43:03] then you know he always gets the best of
[43:05] everything you know Dad gives him this
[43:07] coat of many colors and none of the rest
[43:08] of us you know we just get hand-me-downs
[43:11] or whatever else but you know Dad gives
[43:12] him the top knot stuff and you know we
[43:15] we just do without you know we like the
[43:17] old saying is we're playing second
[43:18] fiddle to a Ste
[43:22] guitar and you know you look at you look
[43:24] at the kind of condition that's this all
[43:27] goes through and you know even you know
[43:30] that it just it just builds up more and
[43:32] more and more to the you know they they
[43:34] couldn't even talk to him they couldn't
[43:36] talk to him in a pleasant tone they they
[43:38] W have anything to do with
[43:40] him but you know when when Jo when Jacob
[43:43] sent Joseph down there to send him to go
[43:47] check on his Brethren and and and see
[43:49] them to check on where the where the
[43:51] flocks were and everything and he went
[43:53] down there and you got you got to think
[43:56] think them them boys them boys hated
[43:58] him they were ready boys was
[44:01] like thank you
[44:03] Daddy he done something for
[44:06] me and it's like we get rid of
[44:09] him and Reuben stood up and we know the
[44:12] scripture Ruben stood up and said you
[44:13] know what we can't kill him now we can
[44:15] get rid of him we can do something to
[44:16] him and he's like we put him in the
[44:19] pit cuz he was just trying to get their
[44:21] anger under
[44:23] control but you know when when they when
[44:25] ru was gone and had his back turned next
[44:27] thing you know they had him sold into
[44:29] into
[44:31] slavery and you look and you look at the
[44:33] life of Rachel here's Rachel she'd went
[44:35] through all this struggle all this pain
[44:37] she's she has a
[44:39] son only son she's ever
[44:42] had 17 years old and next thing you
[44:47] know her
[44:49] sons uh and uh nephews since Leah and
[44:55] Rachel were sisters
[44:56] so sound like something come out of
[44:58] Alabama but
[45:00] um you see you see these brother but but
[45:04] these Sons came back with an evil
[45:07] report and they had killed they had
[45:09] killed a kid and had dipped the coat of
[45:11] many colors in Blood and brought back
[45:14] this evil report to
[45:17] her and here she here she is after she'd
[45:20] went through all of this pain all this
[45:22] struggle all of this time and they
[45:24] saying you know here she is the son that
[45:27] she had longed for all this time was
[45:29] gone from
[45:30] her and do you know that in the
[45:33] scripture you know there's no place in
[45:35] the scripture you know Rachel never knew
[45:38] what happened to
[45:39] him she never learned what happened to
[45:42] him she went she went to her grave
[45:46] thinking that he
[45:48] died and never knew the
[45:52] truth she had she had another son later
[45:55] on
[45:57] and and here she was waiting to have
[46:00] another son going after after Leah had
[46:03] all these Sons After the handmaids had
[46:06] sons all the things that they had
[46:09] done she lost the one thing she wanted
[46:12] was a son he's gone God blesses her
[46:15] again you know what she didn't even get
[46:17] to raise
[46:19] him she named him benomi the son of my
[46:23] morning she dies in childh
[46:27] birth Jacob names him
[46:30] Benjamin so here's Rachel and she never
[46:34] she never comes to the place that she
[46:36] wants to come
[46:38] to right and can you imagine here's
[46:41] here's Joseph growing up away from
[46:46] everybody and then when he finds out you
[46:48] know what your mom passed away she only
[46:52] had two
[46:53] sons you and she never never saw you
[46:56] grow up she never saw what took
[46:59] place and your son and your brother she
[47:03] died giving him
[47:05] birth and you see and you see the
[47:07] Heartbreak and the and the TR troubles
[47:10] and and the trials that she went through
[47:12] and no and no doubt you see the life
[47:14] that Joseph
[47:16] lived and it had you know because it
[47:18] it's a it has an effect on
[47:22] everybody and here and here's Joseph
[47:24] being sold by
[47:28] Brethren and here here he is being sold
[47:30] into a foreign country and no and no you
[47:33] don't know anybody and you don't know
[47:35] the customs and and you know maybe every
[47:38] once in a while he's in he's in Piper's
[47:40] house and maybe every once in a while
[47:42] he'll see somebody that's a Hebrew and
[47:43] he understands the language and he's
[47:45] like hey you know there's somebody from
[47:47] my part of the
[47:49] world but most of the time it's it's all
[47:52] this heathenism and all kinds of other
[47:53] things that he lived with
[47:56] but you know what God had called Joseph
[47:59] to a place and called him into this into
[48:02] this and you know it was it wasn't the
[48:05] the place that he wanted to be there's
[48:07] there's there's no you know you know who
[48:09] wants to be sold into slavery by your
[48:12] brethren right and go and living in a
[48:15] Strange Land with strange food and
[48:17] strange customs and all that and not
[48:19] having your own
[48:21] freedom but you know the one thing about
[48:23] Joseph Joseph was the son of
[48:27] prosperity everywhere he went he it
[48:30] prospered God was with him and God
[48:32] prospered his hand in everything he did
[48:34] am right when he went into Piper's
[48:37] house and and it showed the scripture
[48:40] tells us that Piper knew that God was
[48:43] with with Joseph and he put him over
[48:46] everything put him over the whole house
[48:49] and here he is taking over everything
[48:52] and he controlled everything and you
[48:54] know here's Piper I don't have to to
[48:55] worry about what takes place in my
[48:58] house because Joseph is in
[49:03] charge but you know what after all the
[49:05] things that all the struggles and the
[49:07] strain and the and the problems that
[49:09] Joseph had went
[49:10] through his life was just beginning his
[49:13] troubles were just beginning he thinks
[49:16] well guess what I'm in a good place now
[49:18] and everything's starting to work out
[49:20] now he's got now he's got this woman
[49:21] after
[49:24] him
[49:26] and she didn't come she didn't come you
[49:28] know Piper's wife didn't just come one
[49:30] time you know it was constantly
[49:33] constantly
[49:35] constantly and he had to put up with
[49:37] that every single
[49:39] day and having to having to keep his
[49:42] distance away from
[49:43] her until she put his took the move on
[49:46] him and next thing you know he's in
[49:48] prison yeah here he is he's he's locked
[49:52] up well you know what it just goes from
[49:53] bad to worse he just keeps you know
[49:56] because you know it's it's just like one
[49:57] thing after another after another yeah
[50:00] and it never
[50:01] changes and it just continues to get
[50:05] worse but we see how all this takes
[50:07] place as as it continued to
[50:10] unfold that when when he was in in the
[50:15] prison and here here he is going into
[50:17] this prison and you
[50:20] know nothing looks like looks like it
[50:23] the way that you want it to go
[50:26] but you know in the midst of all that
[50:28] the Prisoners the prison guards the
[50:31] captains when they saw Joseph God showed
[50:35] them that Joseph was a right man he was
[50:38] a man of prosperity and all of a sudden
[50:41] when he come to that place that God put
[50:44] him over everything of the
[50:47] prison he was put in all in in charge of
[50:52] everything and here he is being in
[50:54] charge of all this and and and when he
[50:56] saw all the place that he had
[50:58] been then you know when they see all in
[51:01] the time that he was there and he took
[51:03] over the prison still being a
[51:06] prisoner and you you think about
[51:08] somebody you know like like they always
[51:10] say that the the patients running the
[51:12] Asylum well here you got here you got
[51:13] the prisoners running the
[51:16] prison but all of a sudden this prison
[51:19] begins to uh Prosper here all these
[51:23] things taking place
[51:26] because they saw what kind of man Joseph
[51:29] was and you know you you look at all the
[51:31] things that he went through and all all
[51:32] the struggles and the strains and and
[51:34] all these type things and and you look
[51:36] at all this like what what good would
[51:37] come out of
[51:40] this well I don't I don't see any I
[51:42] don't see how any of this would would be
[51:44] any good I don't see how any of this
[51:46] would ever come to
[51:48] anything well in the midst of all of
[51:50] that you see that here comes the Baker
[51:52] and the
[51:53] Butler and all of a sudden here come
[51:55] here comes these men that are there that
[51:57] are placed in this
[52:00] situation you know here's here's Joseph
[52:02] in this situation and here these men
[52:04] have dreams and they're trying to
[52:06] understand what's going to take place
[52:07] and they're wanting to know what did
[52:09] these dreams mean and they're looking
[52:12] for somebody that can interpret this and
[52:14] understand these things and you know
[52:16] it's really interesting because you know
[52:18] Joseph never tells them that you know I
[52:20] can do these things he said no but I
[52:23] know one that can because you know God
[52:26] is the one that can reveal these things
[52:28] God's the one that reveals dreams and
[52:30] makes Visions
[52:32] known and so when he began to make these
[52:34] things on and then all of a sudden here
[52:36] he comes and and the Butler and the
[52:38] baker you know they come and they tell
[52:39] him their dreams about what's going to
[52:41] take place and here they are when they
[52:43] come and and so he tells the butler you
[52:45] know you're going to be restored because
[52:47] the dream shows that you're coming back
[52:49] to the place that you were formerly and
[52:51] you're going to be beside the Pharaoh
[52:52] and you're going to be handing him his
[52:54] cup and all those things and you're
[52:55] going to see how all that that you'll be
[52:58] restored but the baker was going to lose
[53:01] his life because he was because the
[53:03] dream that he said you know he saw the
[53:05] bread being eaten and all the birds
[53:06] devouring everything he's like well
[53:08] you're it's a loss for you and but but
[53:11] you know he saw what took place and all
[53:12] of a sudden you know there's Joseph in
[53:14] the in the in in the prison and in the
[53:18] midst of all that and he tells he tells
[53:20] the butler he said when you come back
[53:22] and you're restored don't forget about
[53:24] me amen don't forget what I've
[53:27] done don't forget what's taking
[53:30] place but you know what nobody nobody
[53:32] remember
[53:34] Joseph so he's back in the same place
[53:36] doing the same thing and he's like man I
[53:38] thought this was going to be the way
[53:39] it's going to work out I thought this
[53:41] was going to be my way out I thought
[53:43] this was the
[53:44] ticket and you know what he's down
[53:48] there and now it's just right back to
[53:50] the same old thing same old grind
[53:51] everything looks the
[53:53] same and don't look like like anything's
[53:55] going to
[53:56] change and it don't look don't look like
[53:59] there's anything any promise in any of
[54:01] that but you know what God was still
[54:04] dealing with Joseph God still had his
[54:06] hand on Joseph and at that time at a
[54:08] certain appointed time God began to deal
[54:10] with the Pharaoh and began to tell
[54:12] Pharaoh listen through the dream you
[54:15] know he began to deal with him in these
[54:16] dreams and he saw the the ears of corn
[54:19] that were large and the small ones and
[54:21] all dried up and everything and and
[54:23] seeing the cattle how they're how
[54:25] they're fat and you know good got seven
[54:27] good ones we got seven bad
[54:30] ones and the and the bad ones eat up the
[54:32] good ones and nothing changes and and
[54:34] he's trying to figure out and understand
[54:35] what all this
[54:38] means and you know here he is when when
[54:40] the Lord begins to deal with him in
[54:41] these dreams he's looking for somebody
[54:43] that can answer these dreams and you
[54:45] know what none of none of the the the
[54:47] prophets of of Egypt none of none of the
[54:50] wise men none of none of any of those
[54:52] learned men could answer the question
[54:54] that he
[54:56] had and he began to look Pharaoh's like
[54:58] is there anybody in the Kingdom that can
[55:00] answer this is there anybody that can
[55:02] come and answer these questions I've got
[55:04] to because I've got to have an answer
[55:06] for
[55:07] this and that's when the butler comes
[55:09] back and says oh yeah God forgive me my
[55:12] faults but you know what there was a man
[55:14] that done that just exact same thing
[55:16] I've seen him do that exact same thing
[55:19] I've seen it take place because he
[55:21] answered
[55:22] mine he answered my dreams
[55:26] and so they sent for Joseph to come and
[55:29] when Joseph came he began to speak to
[55:31] the Pharaoh and tell him what was going
[55:32] to take place listen you're going to
[55:36] have good years ahead of you you're
[55:38] going to be blessed the next seven years
[55:41] you're going to see great reaps great
[55:43] harvest but the problem is is beyond
[55:45] those seven years there's going to be
[55:47] seven years of
[55:48] famine that's never you've never seen
[55:51] these years of famine that's coming on
[55:53] right and now's the time to prepare for
[55:57] those seven years of famine that's
[55:59] coming
[56:00] amen and when he said you got to prepare
[56:04] then when Pharaoh saw that Joseph told
[56:07] him said you need to find somebody that
[56:09] you can put in place that has wisdom and
[56:13] understanding that can stand in the
[56:14] place and guide the people and do what
[56:17] needs to be
[56:19] done and Pharaoh's looking around and
[56:21] he's
[56:23] like guess what
[56:25] I don't think we're going to find
[56:26] anybody that's going to be qualified to
[56:29] do this job as the man that's just
[56:32] brought us the word of what to do so
[56:35] then he turns to Joseph and he tells
[56:37] Joseph listen Joseph you're going to be
[56:40] my right-hand man you're going to be
[56:43] second in all of the Kingdom only in the
[56:46] in the throne will I be greater than you
[56:48] but in every other aspect you're going
[56:50] to be great you're going to have the way
[56:52] to lead the people and however these
[56:54] people people will go from here will be
[56:56] your
[56:58] way what you tell them to do that's how
[57:01] they'll
[57:03] go and he and so he begins to lead the
[57:06] people and tell them store up the food
[57:09] you need to prepare
[57:10] now because Now's the Time to
[57:14] prepare and when you get ready because
[57:17] the years are coming that are going to
[57:18] be
[57:19] lean and because you see these things
[57:22] that's going to take place you've got to
[57:23] get ready now amen and have you got
[57:26] ready
[57:29] now because I I I wanted to I I wanted
[57:34] to say because I I'm sure y'all probably
[57:36] understand where I'm going with all this
[57:38] because it's not too
[57:40] hard
[57:43] amen but I just want I just want to
[57:46] say you know because you
[57:53] know you look back over your
[57:57] life and you know what I've been
[58:01] in prison and I've been in Dungeons and
[58:05] I've been in
[58:06] famines and I've been in
[58:09] heartache but let me tell you I come to
[58:12] a
[58:13] place I've been I've been brought to a
[58:16] place where there's
[58:20] plenty I have been blessed above measure
[58:23] amen
[58:25] I I I just tell you what my my
[58:26] experience is what what I see what God's
[58:29] done for me to bring bring us to this
[58:32] place to to have the ministry that we've
[58:35] had to see the things that we've seen
[58:37] and the things that we've heard God has
[58:39] blessed us to be
[58:41] hereen but you know things happen when
[58:44] things happen we don't understand why it
[58:46] happens but you know what God's hand is
[58:48] still in it and all of the struggles and
[58:51] the pain and the problems whatever it is
[58:53] God's still in it
[58:55] just as I was speaking last time when we
[58:56] were talking about the Potter see when
[58:59] the when the clay is on the wheel and
[59:01] he's working it and he and the clay is
[59:03] enduring all of the pressure and all
[59:05] those things that has to be done it's
[59:07] whatever's in The Potter's mind is
[59:09] coming to be made brought
[59:13] forth because you know we don't see what
[59:15] what's in The Potter's mind we don't see
[59:17] but you know what he sees what he's
[59:19] going to do just like just like when
[59:21] brother bam was speaking of Michelangelo
[59:23] and Michelangelo was looking at singing
[59:25] Moses he saw that great piece of granite
[59:27] there of marble and he saw Moses and
[59:30] when he saw Moses he said how did you
[59:32] get Moses out of that he said I chipped
[59:34] away everything that was in Moses that
[59:37] wasn't in the vision that I saw and he
[59:39] said when I began to heue all of the way
[59:41] away everything that wasn't Moses then
[59:44] Moses came forth because it was exactly
[59:48] the vision that he had of Moses and he
[59:51] was so moved by the vision that
[59:54] Michelangelo had of Moses that he struck
[59:58] Moses and told him to
[1:00:01] speak and that's what brother Ram said
[1:00:03] and that's what made it the
[1:00:04] Masterpiece why because it was exactly
[1:00:07] what God had in what Moses Michelangelo
[1:00:09] had in his mind and it's the same way
[1:00:12] with you and
[1:00:13] I we we see the struggles and the pain
[1:00:16] and the
[1:00:18] heartache well guess what it God's still
[1:00:21] in control and it's still God's plan
[1:00:24] amen that's right
[1:00:26] brother and know and so we see these
[1:00:29] things well then guess what God brings
[1:00:30] up another
[1:00:33] man in our
[1:00:36] day now nobody no y'all forgive me but
[1:00:41] you know nobody nobody wants to see what
[1:00:45] happened nobody nobody wanted to lose
[1:00:48] brother
[1:00:50] Dale right nobody no I mean
[1:00:57] right who who would have traded places
[1:01:00] with
[1:01:09] him as many times as he stood for
[1:01:14] us he's been Our
[1:01:17] Shepherd he's been our intercessor yes
[1:01:20] sir
[1:01:23] amen he's he's he's been our
[1:01:28] backbone he's been everything we've had
[1:01:30] need
[1:01:33] of but you know
[1:01:41] what God does all things right and God
[1:01:45] does all things in his own time and God
[1:01:47] don't God don't God don't ask us our
[1:01:50] opinion right and he don't he don't want
[1:01:53] he don't want any of our
[1:01:55] ideas CU he said my ways are higher than
[1:01:58] your ways and my thoughts are higher
[1:01:59] than your
[1:02:01] thoughts you know because we don't we're
[1:02:03] not even in the same ballpark as
[1:02:06] him but you see but you see what God but
[1:02:09] he left us
[1:02:11] something I mean I I thank God that you
[1:02:14] know when you when you look back all
[1:02:16] through through
[1:02:18] history when you when you look when you
[1:02:20] look at all through the history of of
[1:02:22] the of the church and and through the
[1:02:25] Bible you know God blessed us to live in
[1:02:28] this
[1:02:30] day because the scripture tells us in
[1:02:32] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:02:34] angel and here and here we are in this
[1:02:39] day you know those people back there
[1:02:41] they never got to hear Paul right Paul
[1:02:44] wrote them letters and sent them but you
[1:02:46] know there some people they never saw
[1:02:48] Paul's
[1:02:50] face there's people that never saw
[1:02:52] Peter's face all all they had was some
[1:02:55] scroll some parchment that had been
[1:02:58] written on by
[1:03:00] somebody and had sent them and somebody
[1:03:02] stood up and read them what Paul wrote
[1:03:06] right and that's all they
[1:03:09] had all of the all the way down through
[1:03:11] history you look at all these people
[1:03:13] what they what they didn't
[1:03:16] have but look and our day we were we
[1:03:19] were blessed to be in this day we
[1:03:21] actually get to hear Brother bram's
[1:03:23] voice all we because you know to me that
[1:03:27] literally is the voice of God because
[1:03:29] it's God behind that voice it's God
[1:03:32] veiled behind the human flesh and it was
[1:03:35] God speaking to us through
[1:03:38] a a five foot whatever
[1:03:42] Kian I mean there was there was nothing
[1:03:45] there was nothing about brother brandham
[1:03:47] you know he was he wasn't a looker he
[1:03:49] wasn't
[1:03:51] handsome you know you look at a short
[1:03:53] man with bald holding hair and bad teeth
[1:03:56] and his HS and totes and fetch and carry
[1:03:59] and didn't know how half the words
[1:04:03] couldn't speak good
[1:04:06] English but you know what God used that
[1:04:09] man and he used that man to speak to us
[1:04:13] and he spoke to a group of people that
[1:04:15] were predestined to hear that voice in
[1:04:18] this day and it was move us to the place
[1:04:21] where God called us to he he called
[1:04:24] every every group to the to their place
[1:04:27] and they and they ran their race because
[1:04:29] there was a group that picked up that
[1:04:31] message just from like when Paul
[1:04:33] preached his message and they ran with
[1:04:35] the message that Paul had and then the
[1:04:37] next thing you know there was one that
[1:04:38] came on and irenius came and began to
[1:04:40] carry the gospel further beyond that
[1:04:43] when all of the when all of the false
[1:04:44] Doctrine began to come in and creep in
[1:04:47] and they began to try to turn them away
[1:04:48] from what Paul said but there were some
[1:04:51] that were full of the Holy Ghost that
[1:04:52] stood up and began to Pro claim exactly
[1:04:55] what Paul said and even even when you go
[1:04:57] back and look in the in the in the
[1:05:00] history they are parts of the history
[1:05:02] that back then there's no written record
[1:05:05] of it but irenius stands up and quotes
[1:05:07] exactly what the Bible says in Mark 16 I
[1:05:09] believe it
[1:05:12] is here these are these men are full of
[1:05:14] the Holy Ghost pointing back to what the
[1:05:16] the apostles had
[1:05:18] preached why because there's always
[1:05:20] somebody that has a voice that's
[1:05:22] standing up and proclaiming ex what what
[1:05:25] God had
[1:05:26] said no matter how many devils in Hell
[1:05:29] began to stand up and come against it
[1:05:31] and proclaiming that it was wrong and it
[1:05:33] was false there was somebody that stood
[1:05:35] up and was given the word of God and
[1:05:37] they spoke by the Holy Ghost and told
[1:05:40] the people exactly what the truth
[1:05:43] was and here we are today sitting here
[1:05:45] with 1100 plus sermons of brother
[1:05:48] brandham speaking to us thus sayith the
[1:05:50] Lord and we have books and tapes and we
[1:05:53] have every kind of social media and
[1:05:55] every kind of form
[1:05:57] of media there is in the world that has
[1:06:00] this message on
[1:06:02] it and sometimes we fail to realize
[1:06:05] because sometimes we allow this to
[1:06:06] become common to us well because
[1:06:09] sometimes we we allow the devil to beat
[1:06:11] us down don't realize that we have
[1:06:13] everything that we have need of has been
[1:06:15] given to us in this Earthly Journey
[1:06:17] because we've had we've had a Vindicated
[1:06:20] message come we've had a Vindicated
[1:06:22] Prophet come in our day and began to un
[1:06:25] unfold these messages to us and tell us
[1:06:28] exactly what the scripture
[1:06:32] says and what happened because when when
[1:06:35] the prophet's message came he called a
[1:06:38] five-fold
[1:06:39] Ministry to pick up this
[1:06:45] message why
[1:06:47] because even in the Old Testament God
[1:06:49] had men that were under Moses that done
[1:06:52] the work he had he had a high priest he
[1:06:55] had a priesthood he had Levites that
[1:06:57] were called to do a
[1:06:59] job why because Moses couldn't do it all
[1:07:02] but it wasn't moses' job to do it all
[1:07:04] they were men that were ordained and
[1:07:06] anointed to do a job and that's what
[1:07:08] they were called to do and then when he
[1:07:10] continues on he always had prophets all
[1:07:13] the way down his through history that he
[1:07:15] spoke to but in the end time Mo Paul
[1:07:19] picks it up and he begins to talk about
[1:07:21] and he call and he gave some yeah right
[1:07:24] Apostles prophets pastors teachers
[1:07:27] evangelists they are to do the work of
[1:07:29] the of the to the ministry they are the
[1:07:32] five-fold ministry why because they are
[1:07:34] to do this work to continue on until the
[1:07:39] people are
[1:07:43] perfected so there is a work that has to
[1:07:45] be
[1:07:47] done well guess what there's the same
[1:07:49] thing that took place under Paul's
[1:07:50] Ministry there was men that were called
[1:07:52] to do the exact same thing
[1:07:55] then in our day when brother BR brother
[1:07:57] brandham never done away with a fivefold
[1:08:00] Ministry but God called a group of men
[1:08:02] under the fivefold
[1:08:04] ministry that they were called to come
[1:08:07] to this place that they were going to
[1:08:08] take this message and carry it
[1:08:11] on yes that's
[1:08:13] right amen there was a group that would
[1:08:16] carry this message on that would that
[1:08:18] would make the word known to the people
[1:08:20] right and if you don't have and if you
[1:08:23] don't see that it takes a fivefold
[1:08:25] Ministry you're missing a portion of the
[1:08:27] word you're missing an important part an
[1:08:30] important aspect of the word you're
[1:08:32] missing out on what needs to be
[1:08:34] done because if you can see that you've
[1:08:37] got to be under
[1:08:39] headship
[1:08:40] right and it's not like it's not like
[1:08:43] people like to make it like it's an
[1:08:44] umbrella well you know what I can just
[1:08:46] run around under this big umbrella cuz
[1:08:48] this big umbrella is my headship I just
[1:08:49] run around and do no you've got to have
[1:08:51] a place right amen you've got to be
[1:08:54] you've got to be settled You' got to be
[1:08:58] established because you know the Bible
[1:08:59] says you know we are to be sitting in
[1:09:01] Heavenly places that means there's a
[1:09:03] position brother R said it's your
[1:09:05] position in Christ so there's a position
[1:09:07] for you to be
[1:09:10] in you know it's you know so it's not
[1:09:13] all willy-nilly and just you know
[1:09:15] whatever but there's a place for you to
[1:09:18] be then when brother bam said you know
[1:09:20] you need to find you a pastor and get
[1:09:22] under him because he's or of God to lead
[1:09:24] you
[1:09:26] through well then there was they were
[1:09:29] they were God called pastors there's God
[1:09:32] called evangelists but you know and and
[1:09:34] teachers but you've got to have a pastor
[1:09:37] you've got to sit under a pastor that
[1:09:39] knows how because and I thank God that
[1:09:42] we have had a pastor we've we've had one
[1:09:46] of the best in the world but you know me
[1:09:48] tell you but God has has blessed
[1:09:52] us but you know not only do we have all
[1:09:55] of those sermons that brother Brandon
[1:09:56] preached but you know we still got all
[1:09:58] the messages that brother Dale
[1:10:02] preached so you know what when all of
[1:10:04] that was done away when just because
[1:10:07] he's not up here preaching anymore
[1:10:09] doesn't mean you
[1:10:10] can let me tell you there's a lot of
[1:10:12] people around the world they're still
[1:10:17] gleaning right God may take his man but
[1:10:20] he don't take it but he don't take that
[1:10:21] anointing he don't take he don't take
[1:10:23] that word
[1:10:28] away but you know
[1:10:31] what I I you know I don't know the
[1:10:33] future I don't know but you know what if
[1:10:34] brother Dale has done his part we praise
[1:10:36] God I want to thank God for what he's
[1:10:39] done he done his portion he done what
[1:10:42] God called him to do and if he never
[1:10:44] preaches another sermon then we can say
[1:10:47] we've heard the word pure and
[1:10:50] unadulterated the word has been preached
[1:10:52] in its entire I believe in the entirety
[1:10:54] in the
[1:10:56] truth and you know we've had that we've
[1:10:59] got the we've got the tapes we've got
[1:11:01] all of I mean praise God I mean you
[1:11:05] think you know we don't even get to see
[1:11:07] brother brandom but we get to hear him
[1:11:09] but here we still got videos of brother
[1:11:13] Dale that we can we can hear all these
[1:11:20] things but when we see all these things
[1:11:22] take place
[1:11:24] here here we are we've received all
[1:11:27] this well if if if things change if if
[1:11:30] things happen well guess
[1:11:32] what as brother Dale told us and I've
[1:11:35] said many
[1:11:36] times it's not a man leading this
[1:11:39] church it wasn't a man in the beginning
[1:11:42] and it's not a man
[1:11:43] now that's
[1:11:46] right and so if God has been leading us
[1:11:49] all this time then guess what he will
[1:11:50] continue to lead us hallelujah it's
[1:11:54] still God in
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:12:00] control and that's the reason that's the
[1:12:02] reason why I I I want to say I
[1:12:04] appreciate brother Wade I appreciate his
[1:12:08] servant's
[1:12:10] heart I know it's a I know it's a
[1:12:16] struggle but I appreciate
[1:12:19] him and I believe God called him
[1:12:25] I believe this I believe this is
[1:12:28] God's place I think this is God's
[1:12:33] plan and God has blessed
[1:12:43] us so we don't know what with what the
[1:12:47] future holds but we know who holds the
[1:12:49] future we know what lies
[1:12:52] ahead because because you know what
[1:12:54] God's led us today he'll lead us
[1:12:56] tomorrow he'll lead us the next
[1:13:01] day yeah there might be some changes
[1:13:04] on I don't know what's going to take
[1:13:07] place but you know anytime anything
[1:13:08] changes there's always
[1:13:10] changes just like brother Wade said he
[1:13:13] said I'm not he said I'm not my dad and
[1:13:16] I can't be my
[1:13:17] dad but he's going to be who God called
[1:13:20] him to
[1:13:21] be thank you Lord
[1:13:24] exactly and and I and I hope I hope this
[1:13:26] is
[1:13:28] okay
[1:13:30] amen but that's what's that's that
[1:13:32] that's what I I I want to share
[1:13:37] tonight you know we all go through hard
[1:13:40] times we all Broken Dreams we've all had
[1:13:44] them but you know what we don't see that
[1:13:47] when was all the things that was like
[1:13:48] well I don't understand why this
[1:13:49] happened I don't understand why that
[1:13:51] happened and we don't understand all
[1:13:52] these things but you know what in the
[1:13:53] midst of all that just realize God's
[1:13:55] still leading
[1:13:56] you God's vision is still in front of
[1:14:00] you in the midst of all the things that
[1:14:03] Joseph had went
[1:14:04] through Joseph was a was a perfect type
[1:14:07] of
[1:14:09] Christ that he was being
[1:14:12] led well you know what your sons and
[1:14:16] daughters of
[1:14:18] God right and guess what you're a type
[1:14:20] of Christ
[1:14:22] also
[1:14:24] yeah all the struggles and all the
[1:14:26] strain you know it's amazing when you
[1:14:28] when you look about all the things that
[1:14:29] you went through in your life and you
[1:14:31] say you know there's a lots of things
[1:14:32] you go through in life and you don't you
[1:14:33] want anybody to
[1:14:35] know right you know everybody thinks
[1:14:38] thank God for the blood it's under the
[1:14:41] blood and nobody has to know about it
[1:14:43] right but you know what it lives rentree
[1:14:45] in your mind because the devil likes to
[1:14:47] remind you of it
[1:14:49] right good at but you know the problem
[1:14:52] is is you know we have to get overcome
[1:14:56] that but see s Satan wants wants to try
[1:14:59] to hinder you with everything but thank
[1:15:02] God the blood covers these
[1:15:06] things that we don't have to worry about
[1:15:08] what took place in the
[1:15:09] past to go on
[1:15:12] forward to move on from where you
[1:15:16] were that God knew all the things that
[1:15:18] you were going to do wrong all your all
[1:15:19] your sins all your mistakes all your
[1:15:21] problems everything and you know what
[1:15:23] and God still chose you the Lord and put
[1:15:26] you in the place that he wanted you to
[1:15:28] be in that's right because you know what
[1:15:31] I don't know about you but I wouldn't I
[1:15:33] wouldn't be here
[1:15:35] today I don't because it wouldn't
[1:15:37] because I want have ended up here
[1:15:43] myself because if it was it wasn't for
[1:15:45] God's grace to us we wouldn't be
[1:15:52] here
[1:15:54] you know lots of Us come from other
[1:15:57] states and other countries and you know
[1:16:00] long way away and all we all end up in
[1:16:01] this one
[1:16:03] spot why because God knows what he's
[1:16:06] doing and it all works
[1:16:09] out and when he when he brings all these
[1:16:11] things to pass and he works all these
[1:16:14] things we all end up in this one place
[1:16:17] as one big family
[1:16:19] amen and everybody has their own faults
[1:16:22] and failures and quirks and you know and
[1:16:26] and you know lots of times you just have
[1:16:29] to overlook people that's
[1:16:32] right and I know it's kind of hard for
[1:16:35] y'all to do that
[1:16:38] um I know people say oh I've overlooked
[1:16:41] you and it's like no y'all just ignored
[1:16:44] me there no there's no way somebody this
[1:16:47] big and you overlook
[1:16:52] them
[1:16:54] so oh bless him
[1:16:56] Lord but hey you know that's a that's
[1:16:58] one of those crosses you have to bear
[1:17:00] that's but you know everything happens
[1:17:03] for a reason and everything works out
[1:17:05] the way God wants it to work
[1:17:08] out when when when here was
[1:17:12] Joseph and all of the things that Joseph
[1:17:15] had went through and all of those things
[1:17:17] and here's
[1:17:18] Joseph and the famine just all of the
[1:17:21] whole area all around was under this
[1:17:25] great Great
[1:17:27] Famine and everything was dried up
[1:17:30] everything was gone there's nothing to
[1:17:31] be
[1:17:33] had and then all of a
[1:17:36] sudden his Brethren Jacob finds out hey
[1:17:39] there's food in
[1:17:42] Egypt hey we can go get food in Egypt
[1:17:45] and and live we can we can be
[1:17:48] sustained cuz you know the one thing is
[1:17:51] they didn't know how long the the the
[1:17:53] famine was going to last they just knew
[1:17:55] that there was a Great Famine on the
[1:17:58] land because you know when the when the
[1:18:00] when his Brethren they all came and and
[1:18:02] he began to make himself known he told
[1:18:04] him we still got five years of
[1:18:07] this but when he when he came through
[1:18:09] all this and his Brethren came to get
[1:18:11] the
[1:18:12] food here they are been all through this
[1:18:15] and here they are they show
[1:18:17] up coming to get
[1:18:20] food well you know what Jake Joseph
[1:18:24] recognizes his Brethren but they don't
[1:18:25] recognize
[1:18:27] him and it's amazing here he is he's
[1:18:30] standing there and he speaking to them
[1:18:31] through an interpreter when he
[1:18:33] understands what they were
[1:18:35] saying he knows what's going on he knows
[1:18:37] who they are but they don't know
[1:18:39] him and he begins to speak to him and he
[1:18:42] begins to check them and test them to
[1:18:44] see what was going to take
[1:18:47] place when they when they came in and
[1:18:49] they're like oh we we're we're all the
[1:18:51] sons of one man and and one of our
[1:18:53] brothers is gone and we've got a younger
[1:18:55] brother and he's still at home and and
[1:18:58] you know and Joseph knows who they are
[1:19:01] but he wants to test them and he goes up
[1:19:04] there y'all a bunch of spies y'all come
[1:19:08] to spy out the famine in the
[1:19:10] land and you know and it's like oh and
[1:19:13] he you know he begins to put the screws
[1:19:15] to them a little bit you know oh and
[1:19:18] Ruben's up see see if y'all hadn't done
[1:19:20] this to Joseph we wouldn't be facing all
[1:19:22] this right look at the condition we're
[1:19:24] in right
[1:19:25] now he thinks we're a spy he's going to
[1:19:28] keep one of us and the rest of us we can
[1:19:29] go
[1:19:31] back now now he wants wants to see our
[1:19:34] younger
[1:19:37] brother and it's like Dad ain't going to
[1:19:40] like this we're not going we're not
[1:19:42] there ain't a good way this something
[1:19:44] with
[1:19:44] this but here they are there they're
[1:19:47] worried and and you know they're all
[1:19:49] talking amongst themselves trying to
[1:19:50] figure out what's going on and Joseph
[1:19:52] understands EX exactly what's going on
[1:19:54] he knows what's going to take
[1:19:56] place and he sends them out with the
[1:19:58] with their
[1:20:00] provision and to add another mystery to
[1:20:04] this mess he like we travel all this way
[1:20:07] to get food in this famine and the and
[1:20:09] the in the in the pharaoh's right-hand
[1:20:11] man he he thinks we're trouble down here
[1:20:14] he's keeping Simeon and we got to go
[1:20:17] back and then all of a sudden they open
[1:20:19] up their sacks that are full they're
[1:20:21] headed back and next thing you know was
[1:20:23] like oh great we're in trouble now all
[1:20:25] the money's in the
[1:20:28] bags so now if they catch us now they
[1:20:31] can just kill all of us they were all a
[1:20:33] bunch of
[1:20:35] Thieves it's like there ain't no there
[1:20:37] ain't no good thing coming out of all
[1:20:40] this and they go back and you know they
[1:20:43] wait till the very last minute wait till
[1:20:45] the very bitter end when there ain't no
[1:20:47] more
[1:20:48] food and they're up there arguing and
[1:20:50] trying to talk to jok
[1:20:53] it's like Dad we got to get some more
[1:20:55] food and Reuben's like Dad you can kill
[1:20:57] my two sons we got to do something
[1:21:00] Simeon still down there we got to do
[1:21:03] something and he become the shity for
[1:21:06] Benjamin we got to go down there we got
[1:21:07] to take him with
[1:21:10] us and he takes
[1:21:14] Benjamin and you know the whole way down
[1:21:16] there you know they're sweating bullets
[1:21:20] oh it was bad last time
[1:21:23] maybe it'll be better this time but it
[1:21:25] don't look
[1:21:26] good and next thing you know Joseph
[1:21:29] comes out there and he sees
[1:21:33] Benjamin and you know and he's and he's
[1:21:35] trying to make it hard on on them and
[1:21:37] he's trying to hold it
[1:21:39] together to let them know who he
[1:21:43] was and here he going through all of
[1:21:45] this and and you know then he goes to
[1:21:47] send them
[1:21:48] out and he puts his drinking cup in in
[1:21:51] Benjamin's bag you know oh man we're in
[1:21:53] trouble now we got
[1:21:57] caught but you know he went through all
[1:21:59] of
[1:22:00] that to put to show where his brothers
[1:22:04] the condition his brothers were
[1:22:07] in after all the things they had been
[1:22:11] through you know because all those years
[1:22:14] they didn't know what happened to Jacob
[1:22:15] I mean
[1:22:16] Joseph their brother's gone they don't
[1:22:19] know what happened to him he probably
[1:22:21] dead
[1:22:23] and they don't understand that years
[1:22:27] before that Vision was spoke over them
[1:22:31] amen and they don't remember there was a
[1:22:33] vision that was
[1:22:34] made and and when he went through all of
[1:22:37] that and he
[1:22:38] began and he called you know because he
[1:22:41] begins to tell his Brethren after they
[1:22:43] came back you know he began to speak to
[1:22:44] them and tell them
[1:22:47] listen I'm
[1:22:50] Joseph does my father yet live
[1:22:54] and it says and they were troubled at
[1:22:55] his
[1:22:57] sayings you know here he is he's trying
[1:22:59] to hold it together he left and wept and
[1:23:01] come back and he's trying to hold it all
[1:23:02] together and trying to tell him listen
[1:23:04] how is everything how's the family is
[1:23:07] Dad
[1:23:09] okay and they were troubled by it but
[1:23:13] you know the first thing he done was he
[1:23:14] grabbed a hold of Benjamin and he began
[1:23:15] to cry on Benjamin's shoulder and
[1:23:18] Benjamin began to cry on
[1:23:21] his and then you know he come and it
[1:23:24] says he came and he kissed each one of
[1:23:25] his
[1:23:28] Brethren and he told them he said listen
[1:23:30] he said y'all meant this to be evil
[1:23:33] y'all meant this to
[1:23:34] be for good I mean for evil for
[1:23:38] bad but you know God ordained all of
[1:23:42] this for good God done all of this to
[1:23:45] preserve
[1:23:46] life look what he's done he's he's done
[1:23:50] all this and knew what was going to take
[1:23:52] place and he worked all of this
[1:23:55] out till y'all could be
[1:23:58] here right now
[1:24:02] feasting and you didn't realize what you
[1:24:04] were
[1:24:06] facing standing right here
[1:24:09] feasting and sometimes we don't realize
[1:24:11] what what we've
[1:24:13] got that God had brought him all this
[1:24:17] way and then they brought the word back
[1:24:19] to Jacob and and they told him said
[1:24:21] listen
[1:24:23] Joseph's
[1:24:26] alive all these years you thought he was
[1:24:28] gone you thought he was
[1:24:30] dead it looks so
[1:24:33] Bleak how many years you sat there and
[1:24:36] cried and thought about your
[1:24:41] son oh if if I only knew where he was oh
[1:24:46] if he was still
[1:24:49] here just like a lot of people you know
[1:24:51] oh if brother Brandon was
[1:24:53] here oh oh if oh if if it was just like
[1:24:56] it used to
[1:24:58] be and not realizing that the same
[1:25:03] one that was here before am he's the
[1:25:06] same yesterday today and
[1:25:09] forever the one that was here in the
[1:25:11] past is here today he's still here
[1:25:15] that's right so what so what if the if
[1:25:17] the conditions
[1:25:20] changed we don't we said well it's it's
[1:25:22] it looks bad it looks
[1:25:26] bad it don't look bad to
[1:25:30] God every we we people look at the at
[1:25:33] the condition that the world is in oh
[1:25:34] it's bad it's
[1:25:36] bad you know what it looks good the
[1:25:39] scripture says when you see all these
[1:25:41] things take place look up because your
[1:25:42] Redemption Draw
[1:25:45] N why because we know these are the
[1:25:47] signs to look for because now we see the
[1:25:49] condition the world is in we see the
[1:25:51] things that are taking place but praise
[1:25:53] God we were told ahead of time what was
[1:25:55] going to take
[1:25:58] place so if we see these things taking
[1:26:00] place no matter what takes place God's
[1:26:02] in control amen amen and God is the one
[1:26:06] that's leading
[1:26:08] us you know what the same one that led
[1:26:11] us
[1:26:13] here wherever wherever you were out out
[1:26:16] in sin wherever wherever you were at
[1:26:19] come
[1:26:20] on whether you was out in a bar
[1:26:23] somewhere or you sitting on a on a
[1:26:26] church
[1:26:27] pew just as dry and dead as you could
[1:26:32] be like talk about people come to church
[1:26:35] you know it's like people just come and
[1:26:37] have sat in churches and they're just as
[1:26:39] dry as dust and people sit in there and
[1:26:42] they don't do anything and they've been
[1:26:44] there for years and all of a sudden you
[1:26:45] just walk pass them and and the dust
[1:26:47] blows off of
[1:26:51] them
[1:26:53] well because because they they they they
[1:26:55] don't know anything about the move of
[1:26:56] the spirit they've never had God lead
[1:26:58] them anywhere they just come to church
[1:26:59] and they just go through the ritual do
[1:27:01] the motions and they just come to church
[1:27:03] and it's all been
[1:27:06] dead but how many times have you sat in
[1:27:08] church and you didn't understand the
[1:27:10] first thing about what the and all you
[1:27:12] knew was what the preacher read out of
[1:27:14] the Bible because maybe you knew about
[1:27:15] that and then you don't know anything
[1:27:17] else they said it but you know what
[1:27:20] there was someday at some point in time
[1:27:23] God crossed your path and spoke to your
[1:27:25] heart and brought you up out of that
[1:27:27] deadness that coldness out of out of
[1:27:29] your Fallen estate and called you on a
[1:27:32] journey to bring you back to the place
[1:27:35] that he always wanted you to be
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:38] in and all of a sudden you began to walk
[1:27:41] in in the newness that you had never
[1:27:42] seen
[1:27:43] before and you know what you began to
[1:27:45] talk to everybody around you and you
[1:27:47] know what nobody understood what you was
[1:27:49] talking
[1:27:50] about when you began just like when was
[1:27:53] Dwight Moody when he was out there and
[1:27:55] he run out into the road and you know he
[1:27:56] asked him he said do you know Grace
[1:27:59] Grace who the grace of God the amazing
[1:28:02] grace of God have you don't do you know
[1:28:04] anything about it
[1:28:06] yes and they just stand there and look
[1:28:08] at him like
[1:28:10] what but there was something that was
[1:28:12] bubbling up inside of him that I got to
[1:28:14] tell you about
[1:28:16] something when you begin to tell people
[1:28:19] that what God can do what God has done
[1:28:21] in your life what what you see what God
[1:28:24] has revealed to you and and they look at
[1:28:25] you like you got two
[1:28:27] heads it's not for
[1:28:31] everybody but you know what it crossed
[1:28:33] your path why because you were
[1:28:34] predestinated to hear it and you were
[1:28:36] predestinated to come to this place God
[1:28:39] knew that you would hear it recognize
[1:28:41] that it was Eagle food and take a hold
[1:28:44] of it and you would eat
[1:28:46] it and it would bring you to this
[1:28:50] place but well it's the same if it if he
[1:28:53] called you out of Darkness into this
[1:28:56] Marvelous Light if he started you on
[1:28:57] this journey then it's the same way he's
[1:28:59] going to continue all the way and if he
[1:29:01] started in one time then he will take
[1:29:03] you all the way to a body
[1:29:07] change amen why because if it's on the
[1:29:10] inside it's going to carry
[1:29:14] you there's a draw that takes place amen
[1:29:19] amen let's all stand have the musicians
[1:29:21] come see if there's a drawing on the
[1:29:22] inside of the deep brother R said that
[1:29:24] deep calls to the Deep he said there's a
[1:29:27] deep to
[1:29:29] respond there was something on the
[1:29:31] inside he was talking
[1:29:37] about all the way through the scripture
[1:29:40] all those men that were God
[1:29:42] called he began to show them through the
[1:29:46] word and they didn't they didn't have
[1:29:48] all they didn't have books and tapes
[1:29:51] that's right
[1:29:53] but you know they they began to hear and
[1:29:57] God began to speak to
[1:29:58] them and show them
[1:30:02] amen you know all all Moses all Moses
[1:30:06] had was what God told
[1:30:09] him all Noah had was what God told
[1:30:14] him 12 years of Noah
[1:30:18] preaching now all all Moses had cuz
[1:30:22] Moses didn't have Moses didn't have
[1:30:24] Abraham's Revelation he didn't have
[1:30:26] Isaac he didn't have ja he didn't have
[1:30:30] nobody's he didn't have his mom and
[1:30:32] daddies he just knew what everybody
[1:30:36] said but when God began to speak to
[1:30:39] him and after all the struggles Moses
[1:30:42] been through God spoke to him on the
[1:30:44] back side of the desert through a
[1:30:46] burning
[1:30:49] bush and God and brother brandom said
[1:30:51] you know we all need to have
[1:30:54] that every Minister needs to have a
[1:30:57] sacred sands on the back side of the
[1:30:59] desert a burning bush experience where
[1:31:01] it's just you and
[1:31:04] God when God begins to speak to you and
[1:31:07] deal with you right because you know
[1:31:11] what there's no there's no man that can
[1:31:13] take that and give you that right every
[1:31:17] well you know I you know because the the
[1:31:19] worst the worst thing that somebody
[1:31:21] could do

[1:31:32] Holy
[1:31:36] Ghost we we're just we're just going

[1:31:40] if you if you're looking at a
[1:31:42] man then you know what you're not going
[1:31:44] to make it you're not you're not going
[1:31:47] there's no stability
[1:31:49] there and all of the all of the preach
[1:31:51] ing that he done just like everybody
[1:31:53] trying to trying to look at brother
[1:31:54] brandom and and looking at a
[1:31:59] man not looking at a man looking at
[1:32:02] Jesus
[1:32:06] Christ here all the all the faults and
[1:32:08] failures that Noah had and all the
[1:32:10] things that he went
[1:32:12] through here 120
[1:32:15] years being ridiculed all the time
[1:32:18] trying to build an
[1:32:20] ark
[1:32:25] that man need to be need to put in a
[1:32:27] straight jacket and put in a looney
[1:32:30] bin he needed a rubber
[1:32:33] room think it's going to
[1:32:38] rain well you know what all the
[1:32:41] naysayers didn't think
[1:32:46] it when it when it came time people
[1:32:48] started to see the evidence of it it was
[1:32:51] too late
[1:32:52] right when the clouds started to roll
