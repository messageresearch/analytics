[0:54] amen so this morning I'm not I'm not uh
[0:58] unless they pull it up on the back but
[1:00] this morning I want to read from Psalms
[1:02] 27
[1:04] 1-5 and
[1:06] U the scripture
[1:08] says David says the Lord is my light and
[1:11] my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord
[1:14] is the strength of my life of whom shall
[1:16] I be afraid said when the wicked even my
[1:19] enemies and my foes came up upon me to
[1:22] eat up my flesh they stumbled and fail
[1:25] though and host should encamp against me
[1:27] my heart shall not fear though War
[1:29] should rise against me in this will I be
[1:32] confident one thing I have desired of
[1:34] the Lord and that will I seek after that
[1:36] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:38] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:40] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[1:44] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:46] me in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[1:48] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:51] me upon a
[1:53] rock and this morning I want to take a
[1:56] little my title is my light and my
[1:58] salvation and uh I just want to look at
[2:02] a few things this morning and U
[2:05] something been I'd actually had started
[2:08] working on this some time
[2:10] back and uh just with some of the recent
[2:14] events that we've had with uh the school
[2:17] shooting and and different things this
[2:20] just came back to me but uh I just want
[2:23] to look at a few things this morning
[2:26] and um might uh I know the young people
[2:30] aren't up here the kids up here but this
[2:32] may be something for the kids to uh
[2:35] listen to might be something for the
[2:37] kids but uh you know the word light is
[2:42] one of the defin you know is to
[2:44] illuminate to
[2:45] Enlighten to shine
[2:48] upon and so says the Lord is my
[2:52] light and you many times we have
[2:55] especially recent but in life you know
[2:57] we have a lot of times that are dark and
[2:59] Gloom ly and u a lot of things come
[3:03] against us and things don't uh come the
[3:06] way we want them to but you know God is
[3:08] our light and no matter how dark the
[3:10] world gets or how dark our situation
[3:13] gets God is our light and he lights our
[3:16] paths he shows us the way we should
[3:19] go anything that happens God is the one
[3:23] that's going to lead you and show you
[3:25] which way to
[3:27] go and the word salvation
[3:30] you know means to means to uh to rescue
[3:35] or bring from one position to another
[3:37] because you know we were all in sin we
[3:39] were all in darkness and we were brought
[3:42] into Marvelous Light and salvation is is
[3:45] to bring from one place to another but
[3:49] it also means to
[3:51] rescue and so but it also means our our
[3:55] safety it means our welfare our
[3:58] prosperity it means means our Victory
[4:01] all these things have to do with our
[4:03] Salvation so when when we talk about God
[4:06] being our our Salvation God is our
[4:08] safety he is our deliverance everything
[4:12] that we have need of it's in it's in a
[4:14] part of God being our Salvation so when
[4:17] he says my the Lord is my light and my
[4:19] salvation of Whom Shall I Fear when when
[4:22] David's talking about this and all the
[4:24] things when you look at David's life all
[4:27] the things that David went through
[4:30] uh you know the one thing I I thought
[4:32] about when you when you look at David's
[4:34] life and you know David had had a great
[4:38] opportunity to to really stand out in
[4:42] the things that he
[4:44] done but you know it's the things that
[4:46] he didn't do are some of the most
[4:49] remarkable things that people look at
[4:52] David's life about you know when when
[4:55] King Saul tried to kill David and kept
[4:58] coming after him
[5:00] him you know it was the Integrity of
[5:02] David's heart not to kill Saul he said
[5:06] God forbid that I touch God's
[5:09] anointed even though Saul had been
[5:11] rejected as king and had turned the word
[5:14] of God down and the Judgment of God was
[5:16] upon Saul David still held Saul in
[5:21] regard to the anointing that God had
[5:23] placed upon him and he said God forbid
[5:26] that I touch his
[5:28] anointed but to show the Integrity of
[5:31] David's heart Saul was put in David's
[5:34] hands more than
[5:36] once but he wouldn't touch him right
[5:39] even when he was urged to take Saul's
[5:44] life he said God has placed him in your
[5:47] hands now take your
[5:49] enemy and do you know that he would not
[5:51] do that because he still held Saul as
[5:54] the King right because he realized that
[5:58] the Judgment wasn't his
[6:00] it was God's judgment right and so he's
[6:03] like no I will not touch him and when he
[6:05] cut the skirt Saul's skirt he went back
[6:09] and apologized to
[6:12] Saul he said I want to show you that I
[6:14] had the opportunity to take your life
[6:16] and I
[6:18] didn't but but he had done he had done
[6:20] an offense to
[6:21] Saul a minor offense and he was so he
[6:24] was so moved by that that he called out
[6:26] to Saul to tell him I cut your skirt
[6:30] and it's an amazing thing sometimes
[6:32] because we allow such small things
[6:34] happen in our lives and we just let them
[6:36] pass by and not realize the the little
[6:40] fox is spoil of Vine the small things in
[6:43] your life that you allow to pass by
[6:45] those are great offenses
[6:49] sometimes we allow such small things
[6:51] happen but see it was the it was the
[6:53] Integrity of David's heart to understand
[6:55] who God was and he said I I don't want
[6:58] to put anything before me that would
[7:00] displease
[7:02] God and so we see the things that David
[7:05] done that he had such a
[7:08] great um love for God he he had such
[7:12] great love for God's word that he would
[7:14] not allow these things to take place but
[7:16] he had this great opportunity and you
[7:18] know a lot of people like well look at
[7:20] look at David's life well he held he
[7:24] held the word of God in such high regard
[7:26] that he wouldn't touch Saul
[7:29] and it's so and it's just like that that
[7:31] you know when you have these things God
[7:33] is
[7:34] my light and my
[7:37] salvation of Whom Shall I Fear right you
[7:40] know you see the you see the life that
[7:42] David lived and you know here he is in
[7:44] all these things the things that he had
[7:46] seen God do in his life so many times
[7:49] we'll read several different uh passages
[7:52] from from Psalms this morning maybe U
[7:54] but here's one of them Psalms 112:4 says
[7:57] unto the upright there ariseth light in
[8:01] the darkness he is gracious and full of
[8:04] compassion and
[8:06] righteous so we think about the things
[8:09] that all the things that are the
[8:11] darkness that covers the earth today we
[8:14] see a lot of even in politics and
[8:18] different things we see the we know that
[8:20] the time that we live in we we
[8:23] understand how these things are to take
[8:24] place and you see the things that's
[8:26] going on but you know we we see these
[8:29] things we know that there's supposed to
[8:31] be darkness in the land but you know
[8:34] there's light
[8:36] right and you
[8:38] know you know David said the Lord is my
[8:41] light but you know Jesus said ye are the
[8:44] light of the
[8:46] world and it's not just not just to
[8:49] be
[8:51] that we're to walk in the light but
[8:53] we're supposed to be the light
[8:55] also John chapter 3 19 and 20 he says
[9:00] and this is the
[9:02] condemnation that light has come into
[9:04] the world and Men love Darkness rather
[9:07] than light because their deeds were evil
[9:11] for everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[9:13] light neither cometh to the light lest
[9:16] his deeds should be
[9:19] reproved so we see that the light has
[9:21] come into the world the light of the
[9:23] word has come and in every age there was
[9:26] a light God brought light in every age
[9:29] every group that was alike there was a
[9:31] message that came forth to them we
[9:33] received our message in our day right
[9:36] the fullness of the word is coming our
[9:38] dayen and we see many people have have
[9:41] rejected the word and turned it down
[9:42] they walked away from it but we realize
[9:45] that's what they're supposed to do but
[9:47] we see that how God is is light and he's
[9:50] brought us this light and you know
[9:53] there's there's many people that have
[9:54] walked away from the light and we see um
[9:58] I I was thinking the other day and I
[10:01] kept trying to think of the name of the
[10:02] song but I could I I I had part of it in
[10:04] my mind but I couldn't think so I had to
[10:07] do a little research and it was called
[10:09] getting used to the
[10:11] dark and I don't know if any of y'all
[10:13] it's an old southern gospel song but you
[10:15] know it's you know the condition of the
[10:18] world today the the things that we see
[10:21] and it's just like you know there's so
[10:23] much darkness in the world and it says
[10:25] for Christians are to be the light but
[10:28] instead of instead of standing up and
[10:30] being the light to the world and showing
[10:32] the light of the word of God we're
[10:35] starting to just get used to the
[10:37] dark because if you compromise on the
[10:40] word or you just let things go well this
[10:42] is just the way things are going to be
[10:43] well I I'm sorry but you know I I going
[10:47] stand up for what's right and I want the
[10:49] world to see that there is truth and
[10:51] this is what the truth is and you know I
[10:53] I want I want the world to know these
[10:55] things because many people that they've
[10:57] got to the place Well it Well
[10:59] we can't change
[11:01] anything but you know there was a little
[11:03] story years ago about that little boy
[11:04] that was going down the beach and he saw
[11:06] all the little starfish and little
[11:08] things that were on the b beach and you
[11:10] know he was going down through there and
[11:11] he was throwing all of them back
[11:13] in the old man watch that little boy
[11:15] throwing starfish and little aquatic
[11:18] things back in there you know and he's
[11:20] like you know son he said you can't do
[11:23] any good doing this he said look all the
[11:25] way down through the beach you see all
[11:27] these little creatures up on the beach
[11:29] they're not in the water they're not
[11:31] going to make it but it didn't stop that
[11:34] little boy he was determined everything
[11:36] that was all the little living creatures
[11:38] that were stuck on the beach he was up
[11:39] there throwing them back
[11:41] in and he stopped and told that old man
[11:43] he picked up a little starfish and held
[11:45] in his hand he said well I can't save
[11:47] all of them but it's important to this
[11:49] one and he threw it back in the water
[11:51] and he just kept on going down through
[11:54] there we can't save the whole world we
[11:56] can't change
[11:58] everything but you know that God puts
[12:00] you across somebody's path for you to be
[12:04] the light to that one that's right be
[12:08] the light where you
[12:10] are and you know you know you never know
[12:12] why people cross your path why things
[12:15] happen the way they
[12:17] do but you sow the seed you be the light
[12:20] to that person right because you never
[12:22] know what when God is going to reach
[12:24] that
[12:26] one just like I was thinking of the the
[12:29] brother that was in
[12:31] the the brother in South Africa brother
[12:34] Keith and uh he uh was witnessing to
[12:38] this
[12:39] lady and he said the Lord just impressed
[12:42] me to go over to this lady I started
[12:43] talking to her and I was telling her
[12:45] about the Lord and everything he said I
[12:48] just stood there and talked to her and
[12:49] he said I didn't understand he said she
[12:51] wasn't interested in one bit she was an
[12:54] older lady she said she was not
[12:55] interested in any of this one bit but he
[12:58] said I just went over there he said
[13:00] because this the way I felt led to go
[13:03] but she had a young caretaker with
[13:06] her and he said I began to share the
[13:08] gospel and talk about God and the word
[13:12] and he said I just started giving part
[13:14] of my testimony just began to speak to
[13:16] this lady and he said just in a moment
[13:18] he said that young lady started crying
[13:20] she was moved by that and he said it
[13:23] wasn't that I was talking to that older
[13:25] lady it was God he said it was because
[13:27] that young lady was with her and he said
[13:28] I had to stop that elderly lady because
[13:31] she was the one that was that was the
[13:33] one in charge you know but when I
[13:35] started talking to her because she
[13:37] stopped to listen I then that young lady
[13:39] was the one that was moved by the gospel
[13:41] was able to be saved because of the of
[13:44] his testimony of them speaking so you
[13:46] never know what God and you say why why
[13:48] are certain things happen just be
[13:50] faithful to what God calls you to do
[13:52] right God moves you on your heart to say
[13:54] stuff to something somebody you know
[13:57] like brother M says always check it by
[13:59] the word but you know if if it if it's
[14:02] uh if it's right if it's
[14:06] uplifting you know if it's scriptural
[14:10] then yeah we ought to share
[14:12] it and whether whether you know it
[14:15] offends people or not well the word's
[14:16] going to be
[14:18] offensive but the word but the people
[14:20] need to hear the truth
[14:22] amen so we see here speaking of the
[14:26] light proverbs 18:10 says the name of
[14:29] the Lord is a strong tower the righteous
[14:32] runneth into it and is
[14:35] safe so you know God has us a place for
[14:38] us to come to the name of the Lord he's
[14:42] given us his name and we have a place to
[14:45] run to in times of
[14:48] need times of trouble
[14:52] problems so you just go and see you know
[14:56] people are looking for many things in
[14:58] the world but they're try trying to find
[15:00] it the wrong way
[15:01] and this is uh one of the what really
[15:05] got me started on on going down this
[15:07] line was I was listening to brother
[15:09] Brown and he was preaching in the
[15:10] message the time tested Memorials of God
[15:12] and he's talking about being there at
[15:14] the a lot of yall probably remember this
[15:16] he was talking about being at the Statue
[15:17] of Liberty and he goes out on the on the
[15:22] uh the island where the where the statue
[15:25] is and you know he goes up there and
[15:27] he's in the he's in the statue they're
[15:29] showing him around and he's talking to
[15:31] the uh some of the people there and and
[15:33] he sees all those dead birds laying up
[15:35] there on the Statue and and he asked him
[15:38] you know he's like why are they up here
[15:41] he said they did they get electrocuted
[15:43] while they they were sparrows and they
[15:44] were all dead and he's like no he said
[15:46] those little fellas they got caught in a
[15:48] storm he's like yeah I know there was a
[15:50] storm here last night he said when they
[15:53] got into this light they tried to beat
[15:55] the light
[15:56] out see they just HIIT against this
[16:00] glass and beat he said instead of using
[16:03] the light to go to safety they tried to
[16:06] beat the light
[16:08] out and he said they beat their brains
[16:10] out trying to get trying to put that
[16:13] light out and they
[16:15] died and he say see and he said then the
[16:18] inspiration struck me he said that's
[16:21] right men and women who are trying to
[16:23] beat out the light of God are just
[16:24] beating their brains out he said why
[16:27] don't they use it to go to SA safety in
[16:29] this in the stad of beating their brains
[16:31] out trying to deny it saying the days of
[16:34] Miracles is passed there is no such
[16:36] thing as Divine Healing old heart felt
[16:38] salvation these things they're just
[16:40] beating against the
[16:43] post but see so they spent all their
[16:46] time and he was sitting there listening
[16:47] and watching those seeing all those dead
[16:49] birds where they' went out there and got
[16:51] caught in a storm and they' beat their
[16:53] themselves to death because they saw
[16:55] that light and instead of trying to use
[16:57] it to go to safety they wanted trying to
[16:59] beat it
[17:00] out and you know and that's the way it
[17:03] is today we see many people they want to
[17:05] try to deny the the light of the word
[17:07] they want to deny the word they want to
[17:08] try to put the the word down they want
[17:10] to try to do away with it but that's the
[17:13] only safety that you have your only the
[17:16] only salvation that you're going to have
[17:18] is the word of God the only protection
[17:21] you're going to have is the word of God
[17:23] and they try to put this out because 2
[17:27] Corinthians 37 17 says because it's
[17:30] speaking of the spirit of the Lord he
[17:31] said now the Lord is that spirit and he
[17:34] said where the spirit of the Lord is
[17:36] there is
[17:37] liberty so there's Freedom so you can be
[17:40] free of these things he said where we
[17:42] are we all with open face beholding it
[17:46] as a glass in the glory of the Lord are
[17:49] changed into the same image from glory
[17:51] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[17:55] Lord so where the spirit of the Lord is
[17:58] see it's going to it's it's going to be
[17:59] a it'll take a change it'll cause a
[18:02] change in you it'll bring you to the
[18:05] change that you want to come to it'll do
[18:08] whatever you have need of that is where
[18:10] there is freedom in that there is
[18:12] Liberty in that and so when you see all
[18:15] these things that are taking place
[18:17] there's safety in that right he said the
[18:20] righteous run into that are safe so all
[18:23] these things that you go through in life
[18:25] here they
[18:26] are if you just come to the right place
[18:30] Place see you know we we see a lot of
[18:34] times people today they they have they
[18:36] have their ideas backwards and I was
[18:40] thinking about how people want to try to
[18:43] you know they they want to try to
[18:45] justify themselves they want to look at
[18:46] things but you know I I was thinking
[18:48] about Abraham Lincoln you know when they
[18:50] asked Lincoln about um um you know he's
[18:55] like why why is it that both sides of
[18:57] this war he said you know they both pray
[18:59] to the same God they both believe the
[19:00] same you know they're both praying for
[19:01] an outcome and and he like you know they
[19:04] say that God's on their side and we say
[19:06] God's on our side Lincoln told him said
[19:10] no he said my greatest concern is not to
[19:13] is not whether God is on my side is on
[19:17] our side he said my greatest concern is
[19:21] to make sure that I'm on God's side
[19:23] right he said because for God is always
[19:26] right right amen and some times you know
[19:29] we have it backwards we're trying to
[19:30] look at it as whether God's on our side
[19:33] well I I want to be on his side I want
[19:37] to make sure that I'm doing the things
[19:38] that is pleasing to him and not trying
[19:41] to use my own ideas or on my own ways
[19:43] because I want to be on his side right
[19:46] because if I'm if I'm where he's at and
[19:48] I'm following the way he's going then
[19:50] I'll never be wrong I'll always be
[19:54] right and see if we if we follow the way
[19:57] that God has the way that God made the
[20:00] god the way that he showed these things
[20:02] if we follow his plan then all that
[20:05] comes to pass everything will be
[20:08] fine you know in the in the Old
[20:11] Testament when when they God told them
[20:14] that they had to take the lamb and and
[20:17] slay the lamb and they had to cook it
[20:19] and and they had to eat and they had to
[20:21] prepare themselves to leave Egypt and
[20:23] they had to have their shoes on and all
[20:26] that and you know they had to go out
[20:27] there and they had to take the blood
[20:29] from the lamb and they had to put it on
[20:30] the lentil on the doorpost and and
[20:32] prepare themselves to leave Egypt and
[20:34] you know they were they were under a
[20:37] death warning right because you know the
[20:40] the warning had been sent out that
[20:42] listen he said prepare yourselves
[20:45] tonight and he said there's the way of
[20:47] Escape made but he said come tonight the
[20:50] death angel will pass through and kill
[20:53] all the firstborn and you know he said
[20:55] but there is a way of Escape that was
[20:57] made but the death the the death angel
[20:59] was coming
[21:01] through and there was only one way that
[21:03] they could bypass that because it was it
[21:06] was either you followed the way that was
[21:08] played out or there was death there was
[21:10] no other way right you had to follow
[21:12] that and you know he was talking about
[21:14] brother R was talking about how that
[21:16] father was sitting there and you know he
[21:17] was just sitting there resting and and
[21:19] relaxing you know just going through the
[21:21] things and he said but his son was
[21:23] standing there and you know his son was
[21:24] so worked up he's like Daddy are you
[21:26] sure about this Daddy are you sure about
[21:29] this because it's my life that's hanging
[21:32] in the
[21:33] balance he said are you sure about this
[21:35] Dad and he said son I want you to come
[21:38] here and
[21:39] look he said God told us there's one way
[21:45] and if we would take the blood of that
[21:47] lamb and the hisp and we would put the
[21:50] blood on the
[21:51] door he said this the death angel can't
[21:54] touch
[21:55] you you're free from this
[21:59] God's brought us all this
[22:01] way when you see them all of the plagues
[22:04] that they had went through all the
[22:05] things that had taking place in Egypt
[22:08] but you know here they are Egypt was in
[22:11] darkness but we know that there was
[22:13] light in
[22:14] Goan all of the fleas the Flies the
[22:17] frogs all the things that they had went
[22:19] through but you know what God protected
[22:21] his
[22:22] people and it's like and now we're going
[22:25] to see this great thing that's going to
[22:27] take place but after after this and we
[22:31] eat this lamb and we prepare ourselves
[22:34] then you know what we're leaving Egypt
[22:36] we're not going to be in this bondage
[22:38] anymore and so you know Harry is
[22:41] standing there telling his son listen
[22:42] you don't have to worry about all this
[22:44] because we're following God's
[22:46] plan God has made a way and we put our
[22:49] full trust in God that he's going to
[22:51] bring us
[22:52] through there is no second way there is
[22:56] no we don't have we don't have a as they
[22:58] say we don't have a Ace in the Hole or
[23:00] you know any kind of other you know we
[23:02] ain't got plan b or or nothing else we
[23:05] got we got
[23:06] God and we got our full trust in him we
[23:10] don't have no other way there's no
[23:11] second way you
[23:13] know because it's either God's way or
[23:17] it's death right you know we see you
[23:21] know in Psalms
[23:23] 23 it says yay though I walk through the
[23:26] valley of the shadow of death I will
[23:27] fear no evil
[23:29] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[23:32] staff they comfort
[23:33] me you know brother bram's talking about
[23:36] in the in the message the great warrior
[23:37] David he's talking about the shepherd
[23:40] and the shepherd has a script bag and he
[23:42] has this script bag and it has all of
[23:44] the things that a Shepherd needs that's
[23:46] inside there and he's talking about you
[23:48] know he said here's God's script bag He
[23:51] said Each traveler Shepherd out there
[23:53] has a script bag so you know if you want
[23:55] something out there some purchasing
[23:57] power if if you're sick reach out here
[24:00] and let's see what's in the script back
[24:03] he Saidi the Lord that Health thee all
[24:05] right take it out it's a power that buys
[24:09] he said whatsoever thou believest When
[24:11] you pray believe you receive what you
[24:14] ask for if you desire if you desire it
[24:18] pray and believe you get it you shall
[24:20] have it that's in the script bag so
[24:24] whatever you have need of is in that
[24:26] script bag so if he's our Shepherd and
[24:28] he's the one that shows that we shall
[24:30] not want and whatever whatever condition
[24:33] that we go through in life what however
[24:36] dark and dismal it may look but you know

[24:54] protection amen so whatever you go
[24:56] through realize that you are
[24:59] protected we're walking as as brother
[25:02] Bram was talking about the condition
[25:04] everybody wants to build bomb shelters
[25:05] and they want to have this kind of
[25:07] protection and that kind of protection
[25:09] but he said the believer is under
[25:12] feathers right the greatest place that
[25:15] you can be is under the wings of that
[25:18] Jehovah Eagle almighty God be under his
[25:22] wings and no matter what happens if
[25:24] we're there then we don't have to worry
[25:27] about the condition the world is in
[25:29] things that happen because we have the
[25:32] best protection that we can have so we
[25:36] can have he said and the
[25:37] eagle he said and the eagle can have
[25:40] confidence in his god-given
[25:44] protection you know he was talking about
[25:46] how he went down in that blowdown
[25:48] brother BR was standing out there in
[25:49] that field and he saw that eagle and he
[25:51] had he was flexing his wings you know he
[25:54] said I can shoot you I can put you down
[25:58] but he said that eagle never never
[25:59] flinched never was scared because he
[26:02] knew that the wings that he had was his
[26:07] protection and he said if if that give
[26:10] him confidence he had strength to
[26:11] believe in that confidence that God
[26:13] given that that God had given him that
[26:16] he could do that he said how much more
[26:19] the church by the Holy Spirit can have
[26:22] confidence in the wings he said your
[26:25] god-given protection and tutor when sick
[26:28] strikes or when trouble
[26:31] strikes when all these things take place
[26:33] then you know what you can put your
[26:35] trust in
[26:37] him and whatever condition that happens
[26:40] whatever things goes then you put your
[26:42] your faith and confidence in those
[26:44] things you've seen God work in your life
[26:47] then if God's done one thing for you
[26:49] then you know what he'll continue to do
[26:51] the same
[26:54] thing and I I I want we'll have the the
[26:57] musicians come I'm I'm going to finish
[26:59] here just in in a few minutes but I I I
[27:02] want to finish this morning with this
[27:04] you know brother bam talks about the
[27:06] story of the little the little boy in
[27:08] the
[27:10] storm the little boy came in the storm
[27:13] and you know he's at home and he got
[27:15] real nervous about the storm and he
[27:18] stood there and he's
[27:20] like Mom I'm afraid of this storm it's
[27:22] getting too close and it really made him
[27:26] nervous and his mom was like listen the
[27:28] WS our protection you don't have to
[27:29] worry about it you know but but he never
[27:32] he never would he never could get
[27:34] comfortable with that he never could put
[27:35] his trust and that and the next thing he
[27:37] like well Mama all these things have
[27:38] taken place and I'm more more worried
[27:41] about this today and I'm a little bit
[27:43] con you know concerned about these
[27:45] things and she kept telling him said
[27:46] listen said we believe God and and and
[27:49] all these storms or whatever Co he said
[27:52] God is our protection and his mama kept
[27:55] trying to comfort him he said yeah Mama
[27:56] he said I believe that'
[27:58] but he said I want a god with skin on it
[28:01] right you know he wanted he wanted a god
[28:03] with skin on it well I want to say this
[28:06] morning brother BR and the Mighty God
[28:08] unveiled he said we are the god with
[28:10] skin on it you're looking at the people
[28:14] this is god with skin on it when you're
[28:16] looking for somebody that you're that
[28:19] you're wanting somebody that lay you
[28:21] know that you can touch that you can
[28:22] give a hold of well that's that's your
[28:25] brothers and sisters that's the people
[28:27] in this church church that's the the
[28:29] Believers these are this is this is the
[28:31] ones that you can touch because God is
[28:34] veiled in human
[28:37] flesh and if God has has veiled in human
[28:41] flesh s you know fall short of the glory
[28:45] of God and all those type things but you
[28:47] know what God still is hid in our
[28:51] flesh we are god with skin on it and
[28:55] that you know that little boy you can
[28:56] have confidence in these things and you
[28:58] know the the scripture talks about a the
[29:01] the scripture I just want to I know
[29:04] there's several scripture here in Psalms
[29:06] but I'm not going to be able to get to
[29:07] them this morning but it says that you
[29:08] know the angel of the Lord encampeth
[29:10] round about them that fear Him and
[29:21] deliverthat was here the same God that
[29:24] brother bandam talked about that he
[29:26] preached about the one he served is here
[29:29] this
[29:29] morning and he's the ones that brought
[29:31] you all this way and has kept you every
[29:35] day of your
[29:37] life and I I've talked to several people
[29:40] this this week and one of the things
[29:43] that really stirred me up you know
[29:44] because so many people walk in in they
[29:47] walk in fear of the
[29:50] unknown and I you know and it's and it's
[29:53] real easy just to say well I just walk
[29:55] by faith
[29:58] but you you you look you look moms in
[30:00] the eyes and they're sending their kids
[30:02] to school and it's like I don't know
[30:04] what's going to happen
[30:06] next right but you know what I know
[30:09] where I came from and I know where I'm
[30:11] at this
[30:13] morning because you know what I know I
[30:15] passed from Death to life
[30:19] right every day of my life I've come all
[30:23] this way because of God Amen all my
[30:28] shortcomings all my figures but you know
[30:29] what God has never failed me he's
[30:32] brought me all this
[30:34] way I've got a son that I got to send to
[30:38] school but you know
[30:42] what I placed him in the hands of God
[30:45] yes and I can't do anything else but do
[30:47] that
[30:49] right because that's true I was thinking
[30:52] about this morning how many children are
[30:54] sitting here in this building that we've
[30:56] dedicated to God
[30:58] that brother Dale dedicated you to
[31:02] God well then how much more I mean what
[31:05] else do you
[31:07] want don't think well I'm so worried I'm
[31:09] so nervous I I don't know what's going
[31:11] to take place you're in the hands of God
[31:14] we dedicated you to God yes so you know
[31:18] what you don't have to worry about those
[31:22] things and the other thing is is every
[31:24] single year we come up here and we give
[31:27] y'all prayer clo walls and we pray over
[31:29] every one of you right so that guess
[31:33] what when you walk out of here and you
[31:35] get up to go to school and everybody's
[31:37] like well I don't want to go to school
[31:38] today and they're so afraid and they're
[31:40] so worried well I want you to realize
[31:42] that the angel of the Lord is still
[31:43] there with you why because we prayed
[31:46] over you we dedicated you to the Lord
[31:49] and we send you out there as walking in
[31:52] faith amen you walk in faith you don't
[31:54] have to worry about what's going to take
[31:56] place that's right why because Isaiah
[31:59] 54:17 tells us he said no weapon formed
[32:02] against you shall prosper Glory that's
[32:05] what God Said right and that's what we
[32:08] spoke over you and when we do these
[32:11] things and we pray over you and we give
[32:13] you prayer Clause listen this ain't some
[32:15] kind of Hocus Pocus this ain't some kind
[32:18] of ritual that we go through this is
[32:20] enforcing the word of God righten
[32:23] because we take God at his word and we
[32:25] enforce it amen then guess what the
[32:28] devil is defeated right so don't worry
[32:32] about what takes
[32:37] place I'm not
[32:40] worried because you know
[32:43] what even if I had an army around
[32:47] me I wouldn't have more confidence in
[32:51] that than I do in the word of God
[32:54] right because though I walk through the
[32:56] valley of the shadow of death I will
[32:58] fear no evil for thou art with me amen
[33:01] God bless you this morning and if you
[33:03] have if you don't have a prayer cloth
[33:05] this morning if you want a prayer cloth
[33:06] then guess what we will give you one
[33:08] pray over you this morning whatever you
[33:10] have need of we want you to be have have
[33:13] confidence in God's word and realize who
[33:15] you are and where you're standing
[33:18] at because so many kids will go out and
[33:22] they'll be worried about what's going to
[33:23] take place tomorrow next
[33:26] day it's all in the hands of God Amen
[33:29] that's right so I want you to be
[33:31] comforted be a good cheer this morning I
[33:34] am with you and I'll be with you till
[33:38] the end of the world Amen God bless you
[33:40] this morning
[33:42] [Applause]
