[2:53] out there that kept the road safe for us
[2:55] and U you probably you didn't get any
[2:58] mail today because the mail didn't run
[2:59] we didn't have any uh we didn't have
[3:01] anybody want to get out in all that deep
[3:03] snow we

[3:15] wonderful time brother Daryl just got
[3:17] home right before dark and he already
[3:19] had about 2 and 1 half inches of snow on
[3:21] the ground and uh he sent me a message
[3:24] it was like
[3:25] 12° that morning and we were 18 so I
[3:28] told him we we had a heat w going on
[3:30] down here so he made it back safe and he
[3:33] really appreciated the the pulling of
[3:35] the gift and all that thank you bud
[3:37] appreciate it and we sure appreciate
[3:39] everybody that helped man y'all did a
[3:41] real good job so so we had a had a real
[3:43] good crowd and we were able to feed
[3:45] everybody on Saturday and then had a
[3:47] real good time on Sunday um brother Bob
[3:50] will be preaching for us next Wednesday
[3:52] night and this not this coming weekend
[3:56] the next weekend February the 2nd all
[4:00] right the second service we're changing
[4:02] it to a worship service I only have a
[4:05] couple of questions and we were going to
[4:07] have a Q&A but we going to have a
[4:09] worship service um I know brother Lis is
[4:12] going to be gone but but the song
[4:14] leaders musicians will'll get together
[4:17] and we'll just have a worship service
[4:18] you can work on your keys you can work
[4:20] on uh uh uh we got some new brothers and
[4:23] sisters that are that are want to play
[4:25] instruments so we want to get together
[4:28] that weekend I think that's a little
[4:30] more imperative now that we do that than
[4:33] answering a couple of questions so but
[4:35] we'll still have pizza we'll still have
[4:38] uh something to eat between service and
[4:39] then we'll start at
[4:41] 2:30 straight into the worship service
[4:43] and song service at 2:30 all right so
[4:47] song leaders bring you some new songs um
[4:50] somebody wants to practice the song then
[4:54] or with a group or or if you want to
[4:56] practice singularly that's fine that's
[4:59] what it's for it's for everybody to get
[5:01] together and start off in the right key
[5:03] and keep the right key and and and have
[5:06] um just some really good Harmony and
[5:08] we've got some new ones sister Emma did
[5:10] a wonderful job this weekend on that
[5:13] cello man good job and um we want to uh
[5:19] let her feel comfortable and then in
[5:20] different ones feel comfortable with
[5:22] playing instruments and U I know we
[5:24] don't have room for everybody here but
[5:27] we maybe we'll do a run and shift or
[5:28] something I don't know but I want
[5:30] everybody to exercise their gift I don't
[5:33] want to have a gift sitting somewhere
[5:36] and not being used and you not you want
[5:38] to use it and we don't have enough room
[5:39] to use it well we're going to try to do
[5:41] our best to get some room maybe and uh
[5:45] later on but just remember that also the
[5:47] Valentine's banquet will be on the 15th
[5:51] the 15th of
[5:53] February at 3:00 sign up sheets
[5:56] downstairs uh we've got the group coming

[6:01] our house and a few different places and
[6:04] then we will have uh Brother Richard
[6:06] Douglas and his wife coming so they
[6:09] called and said they were they were
[6:10] going to come and be with us so we sure
[6:11] do appreciate that brother Burley
[6:13] Williams will be with us and he'll be
[6:14] speaking for us that Saturday just for a
[6:16] few minutes and then on Sunday he'll be
[6:19] here speaking for us so all M's clear
[6:22] you love the Lord you want to hear the
[6:25] word of God that's what I want to hear I
[6:27] want to hear the word of God I don't
[6:28] want to hear myself
[6:30] speaking I want to hear God speaking to
[6:31] us tonight so we're going to start
[6:33] tonight and we're going to stay in the
[6:35] transition to Perfection part nine but
[6:37] we're going to talk tonight about
[6:39] restored
[6:41] Doctrine restored remember last time we
[6:44] preached we talked about the Mysteries
[6:47] and there was Mysteries that came about
[6:49] that we didn't um I'm not plugged in
[6:52] that's why they don't have it on there
[6:54] it would help if y'all could see what I
[6:57] see sorry about that
[7:06] maybe
[7:09] now if you got your Bibles go and turn
[7:11] to First Corinthians there we go 2 ver9
[7:14] but we're going to talk about restored
[7:15] Doctrine now listen Doctrine is
[7:19] important true Doctrine is
[7:23] imperative everybody with me everybody's
[7:26] got a Doctrine tonight the Baptist has a
[7:28] Doctrine the Methodist has a Doctrine
[7:30] the Pentecostal has a Doctrine the
[7:32] Oneness has a Doctrine the Tess has a
[7:34] Doctrine this one has everybody's got a
[7:36] Doctrine brother brand said a church
[7:37] without a Doctrine is not a church so
[7:40] the church the doctrine that we have
[7:42] here is we believe in adoption we
[7:44] believe in being more mature in our
[7:47] Christian walk and in our fellowship and
[7:50] then God told us here in Corinthians
[7:52] we'll read it 2 verse
[7:55] 9 he has opened the door
[8:00] for us to know the Deep things of
[8:03] God you just got to be able to get in
[8:06] there yourself and make yourself
[8:08] available to it all right remember I
[8:11] read y'all that quote where brother
[8:12] Brown said it's not just reading verse
[8:14] by verse not just reading the Bible
[8:16] though that's good but a deeper
[8:19] understanding of what's going on is what
[8:20] we need in the end time to change our
[8:23] bodies it's not going to be just normal
[8:25] preaching sure it's going to be
[8:26] preaching the word of God but you've got
[8:28] to react to it and it's got to change
[8:31] you all right the word's going to have
[8:33] to change you you can't change yourself
[8:35] I can't change it the word is going to
[8:36] have to change you all right 1
[8:39] Corinthians 2 verse 9 let's bow our
[8:41] heads Lord be with us tonight give us
[8:44] strength Lord to speak to you people you
[8:46] do the speaking father and let us all
[8:48] listen to you tonight Lord the things
[8:50] that laid on our heart I pray that you
[8:53] be willing that her sick Lord be with um
[8:56] ana Lord getting close to that baby
[8:57] coming Lord I pray that you'd give her
[8:59] strength strength and Lord just be with
[9:00] them in the time lord and just be with
[9:03] the family Lord and bless each one
[9:04] father forgive us of our sins and our
[9:06] mistakes be with the ones that have to
[9:07] travel on the highways Lord that you'll
[9:09] keep those roads clear for each one
[9:11] father I pray these things in Jesus name
[9:14] amen 1 Corinthians 2:9 but as it is
[9:18] written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[9:21] neither hath entered into the Heart of
[9:22] Mine the things which God had prepared
[9:25] for them what that love him or that
[9:28] Agape him
[9:30] not FOH him Agape him know who he is
[9:33] know what he's doing know what he's
[9:34] saying and know what the revelation of
[9:36] it is all right everybody with me but
[9:39] God hath revealed them unto us by his
[9:43] spirit so without the Holy Spirit you're
[9:46] not going to get the full revelation of
[9:48] God all
[9:49] right cuz Satan I don't believe Satan
[9:51] can give you a revelation you know that
[9:54] amen for the spirit searcheth the spirit
[9:57] searcheth all things yay the Deep things
[9:59] of God so the holy spirit is out there
[10:01] searching the Deep things of God and if
[10:03] you got the Holy Spirit guess what
[10:05] you'll be searching for the Deep things
[10:07] of God for what man knoweth the things
[10:10] of a
[10:11] man save the spirit of man which is in
[10:13] him like I said before we can all
[10:15] communicate with the world we used to
[10:17] have the spirit of the world amen amen
[10:20] and we acted like the world we didn't
[10:23] act different we acted just like the
[10:24] world
[10:25] acted because if you have a spirit of
[10:27] man you're going to act like that even
[10:29] so the things of God knoweth no man but
[10:32] the spirit of God that's why we're all
[10:33] odd that's why we're different that's
[10:35] why people look look at you different or
[10:36] ask you question why don't you do this
[10:38] why don't you do
[10:39] that now we have received now
[10:42] watch not the spirit of the world but
[10:46] the spirit which is of god that we might
[10:48] know the things that are freely given to
[10:51] us of God you may be seated the Lord add
[10:53] His blessings to the reading of the word
[10:56] we talked about in The Book of Matthew
[10:58] we'll just review here just a second
[11:01] Matthew
[11:03] 13:5 this is the soar of the seed now
[11:05] what is the seed the seed is the word of
[11:07] God Amen the so is the son of man all
[11:11] right so some fell upon Stony Stony
[11:14] places where they had not much Earth
[11:16] they had Earth it went into something
[11:21] right
[11:21] amen and forth with they sprang up or
[11:25] sprung up okay so they had life
[11:29] they sprang
[11:30] up but what
[11:32] happened because they had no and forth
[11:35] with they sprung up because they had no
[11:37] deepness of Earth and when the sun was
[11:40] up they were scorched and because they
[11:42] had no root they withered away remember
[11:45] that word deepness means the depth of
[11:48] God and we know it's a parable that the
[11:50] so the the seed should have been stwn
[11:53] deeper into the Earth naturally but
[11:56] that's the same thing spiritually it's
[11:59] the seed of God planted deep in your
[12:01] heart and that's what's going to keep
[12:03] you as the Bible says rooted and
[12:05] grounded in God not coming to
[12:13] church know why you
[12:15] come know why you have that desire to
[12:18] come know why you don't want to like
[12:21] brother brandom and I see he he wor he
[12:23] he he had the same thing to worry with
[12:26] he said y'all sit home and watch I love
[12:28] Susie well
[12:29] put your in you 2025 whatever y'all stay
[12:33] home for and I don't mean y'all I mean
[12:35] people will stay home for anything and
[12:37] brother brandham dealt with it too he
[12:38] said you'll sit home and watch I love he
[12:40] can't he never did say Lucy he always
[12:42] said Susie so U you can tell he didn't
[12:44] watch it but he knew that's what they
[12:46] was doing they were sitting there
[12:48] watching it and not going to church so
[12:51] anyway so they had no deepness of Earth
[12:54] in other words the word was not swn down
[12:57] deep enough to when the Sun s o n began
[13:01] to
[13:02] shine some people are going to walk away
[13:05] when they see the s o n began to shine
[13:07] in the end time because you know what
[13:09] happened when the s o n began to shine
[13:12] 2,000 years ago the people walked away
[13:15] from him and literally killed him
[13:19] amen so they didn't know the depth of
[13:22] God you and I is a requirement that we
[13:25] are not in grammar school anymore now
[13:27] some may be that's okay okay but we
[13:30] can't stay there this is a progressive
[13:33] gospel this is the gospel that brings us
[13:35] as we were talking about transition to
[13:37] Perfection that means there's got to be
[13:39] a
[13:39] move we've got to move we got to be a
[13:43] Church on the Move we got to be
[13:44] individuals on the
[13:46] Move Matthew
[13:48] 17:9 they came down from the mountain
[13:50] Hallelujah and Jesus charged them saying
[13:54] tell the vision to no man until the son
[13:56] of man be risen again from the dead
[13:59] and his disciples asked him saying why
[14:01] then say the scriptures or the scribes
[14:03] say that Elijah must first come and
[14:06] Jesus answered and said unto them Elias
[14:09] truly shall first come look and restore
[14:12] all things so we're looking at restored
[14:14] Doctrine now listen Jesus Christ was the
[14:19] doctrine of God he wasn't a Doctrine he
[14:24] wasn't part Doctrine he wasn't right
[14:27] every once in a while
[14:29] he was the attribute of God because he
[14:33] was godl okay so he didn't make a
[14:36] mistake now I wrote myself a note right
[14:38] here he didn't change the
[14:42] doctrine Elijah's not going to come to
[14:44] change the doctrine he's going to come
[14:46] to restore the doctrine that's already
[14:49] there we'll prove that here in just a
[14:51] minute their Doctrine had to be restored
[14:54] under the first part of brother bram's
[14:56] Ministry it had to be restored back to
[14:59] where they believed it in the first
[15:02] place right and then in the seals open
[15:05] which was something nobody had ever seen
[15:07] which is something that you and I just
[15:09] we we know what it is we know when the
[15:11] seals broke that brother brandham said
[15:12] this became a brand new Bible he'd read
[15:14] it probably thousands of times but it
[15:17] became new has it become new to you have
[15:18] you opened a
[15:20] book have you opened the Bible and said
[15:23] man I never seen that before somebody
[15:24] told me something downstairs uh Sunday
[15:26] and I kind of chuckle because
[15:29] how many times have you ever done that
[15:30] yourself you've read the Bible and read
[15:31] the Bible like eight or 10 times
[15:33] somebody quote a scripture and you go I
[15:35] didn't read that or I didn't get that it
[15:38] wasn't your time that's what makes an
[15:41] eternal book it's an unfolding it's a
[15:43] continual unfolding something may not be
[15:46] anything to me Romans 6 verse1 so what
[15:48] shall we say then shall we continue in
[15:50] sin that Grace May abound well I don't
[15:55] sin according to God but I sin according
[15:59] to me everybody with me so we're going
[16:02] to have to start believing what he said
[16:03] because it says right here there's
[16:04] therefore now no
[16:06] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[16:08] Jesus so brother brandom in this first
[16:11] part of his ministry before he brought
[16:13] the great mystery because remember the
[16:16] Bible tells us in Revelations 10:7
[16:18] there's only one
[16:20] mystery the mystery of God will be
[16:23] finished not the
[16:26] Mysteries the Mysteries is the ones that
[16:28] we that we listed and we'll get to them
[16:30] in just a second but remember every
[16:32] doctrine of every Church of every
[16:36] denomination comes from the four
[16:40] gospels of the Bible now we know there's
[16:43] a book of Acts but what's the book of
[16:45] Acts doing tell them what Jesus said
[16:47] what's Corinthians doing tell them what
[16:49] Jesus said or even Paul going back in
[16:51] the Old Testament Isaiah said this one
[16:53] said that one said everybody with me so
[16:55] they didn't get it from another book
[16:57] they got it from they didn't even have a
[16:59] Bible at that
[17:00] time scripture was not written until
[17:03] 1500 years ago or put together sure
[17:05] there were Scrolls there was things they
[17:07] read and and you think it's you think
[17:10] it's hard you take somebody like the
[17:12] Apostle Paul now we know Paul was a
[17:14] learnning man he was very very
[17:17] smart and he took those Old Testament
[17:20] Scrolls he took the Torah and the Old
[17:22] Testament say of uh prophets and he
[17:26] wrote 80% of the New Testament from
[17:29] those scriptures that's right that's why
[17:33] he was a prophet he got it straight from
[17:35] God and he interpolated or didn't change
[17:39] it he made it come alive to me he made
[17:42] it come alive he made the Old Testament
[17:44] come alive cuz that's what the New
[17:46] Testament is it's the Old Testament come
[17:48] alive all right cuz in the Old Testament
[17:50] we stay condemned in the New Testament
[17:52] we've been
[17:52] delivered all right everybody with me so
[17:55] he didn't come to change the this Elijah
[17:57] that's coming didn't come to to change
[17:59] any Doctrine he came to restore the
[18:01] doctrine that was already there all
[18:04] right then bring the mystery now we not
[18:06] get to that mystery yet all right cu the
[18:08] seals didn't open till 1963 so all that
[18:11] first church age all the people in the
[18:12] first church age the one where he says
[18:14] here behold I will send you Elijah the
[18:16] prophet before the coming of the great
[18:18] and Dreadful day of the Lord he shall
[18:19] turn the heart of the father to the
[18:20] children and the Heart of the children
[18:22] to their fathers what heart of the
[18:24] children to their fathers what the faith
[18:26] of the fathers is the doctrine
[18:29] that the whole church should be based
[18:32] on you hear me should be based on
[18:36] because the first three Church ages it
[18:38] was based when you went to a church on
[18:40] the corner over there they were
[18:41] preaching the
[18:42] gospel if you'll read back in your
[18:44] history and I read back and I can't
[18:46] remember the book I was reading but it
[18:47] was a historian he was talking about the
[18:49] change oh it's called anatomy of a
[18:52] hybrid brother um um tic gave it to me
[18:57] it's anatomy of a hybrid what how the
[18:59] church got
[19:00] hybridized right because just as now you
[19:04] see all kind of doctrines on every
[19:05] corner before
[19:08] NAA 99% of the churches were from that
[19:12] original church at on the day of
[19:14] Pentecost they were everywhere and they
[19:17] were preaching the correct Doctrine now
[19:19] you had certain ones we know Paul said
[19:21] Grievous wolves and people like sthus
[19:23] and different ones brought their own
[19:25] Doctrine in but in a whole the first
[19:27] three ages you when you went to a church
[19:29] you heard the teachings of Paul you
[19:32] heard the teachings of Peter you heard
[19:34] those teachings you didn't hear false
[19:37] Doctrine but what happened was that
[19:39] Doctrine began as you brother Brown
[19:41] tells us in the U restoration of the
[19:43] brid tree and and spoke the word
[19:45] Original Seed he said the word was eaten
[19:47] down now listen the word's
[19:50] powerful but the word polluted or
[19:53] diluted is not
[19:55] powerful I said the word diluted we make
[19:58] it a none effect what Jesus tell them
[20:00] you've made this word of God of none
[20:02] effect cuz you brought your Traditions
[20:04] what so let's take that word tradition
[20:06] out and put Doctrine in same thing their
[20:10] traditions and tradition is something
[20:11] they did every time they did every day
[20:14] they did every week they did every year
[20:17] right but he shall turn the heart of the
[20:19] fathers to the children now that's what
[20:20] John the Baptist did and we know the
[20:22] heart of the children to the fathers
[20:24] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[20:27] curse so now
[20:30] Isaiah I want you to read this with me
[20:33] Isaiah 28:5 now this is the Old
[20:35] Testament but this is Isaiah in that day
[20:38] shall the Lord of hosts be for a Crown
[20:40] of Glory now we're going to talk about
[20:41] Doctrine tonight restored Doctrine how
[20:44] it kind of got eroded and how it been
[20:46] has been restored okay is everybody with
[20:47] me and that day shall the Lord of hosts
[20:50] be for a Crown of Glory and for a diadem
[20:53] of beauty unto the residue of what his
[20:56] people and for a Spirit of judgment to
[21:00] him that sth in judgment and for
[21:02] strength to them that turn the battle to
[21:04] the gate now
[21:06] watch but they also have aired through
[21:10] wine and through strong drink are out of
[21:13] the way the priest and the prophets
[21:16] didn't say the
[21:17] people didn't say the people right the
[21:21] priest and the prophet have aired
[21:24] through strong drink they are swallowed
[21:26] up of wine they are out of the way
[21:28] through strong drink they Heir in
[21:32] Vision they stumble in
[21:36] judgment for all tables are full of
[21:38] vomit and filthiness so that there's no
[21:40] place
[21:41] clean Whom Shall he teach
[21:44] knowledge and Whom Shall he make to
[21:47] understand
[21:51] Doctrine them that are wean from the
[21:53] milk and drawn from their breast in
[21:57] other words coming from a baby coming
[22:00] from your baby nourishment up until what
[22:03] being an
[22:04] adult all right listen kids don't
[22:07] understand Doctrine right come on right
[22:10] sure they can tell you about one God
[22:11] they can tell you about different things
[22:13] but they unless they get an experience
[22:16] but they still have that mind now I've
[22:18] seen some kids that were smarter than us
[22:20] so I'm talking about worldly smart but
[22:23] but as far as being in the in the
[22:25] message of the
[22:26] hour sometimes it is hard hard for for
[22:29] young kids even young kids that just
[22:31] started in the message I'm talking about
[22:32] older
[22:33] people to listen and and know what's
[22:35] going on but listen you got to stay
[22:38] there long enough to let God work
[22:40] through all of your I say your and mine
[22:44] issues that's between this ear and this
[22:47] ear okay let him continue because listen
[22:50] we were all born what contrary to God
[22:54] right born in sin shap iniquity spouse
[22:57] for my mother's womb a liar
[22:59] doomed and on our way to hell right
[23:02] putting several scriptures together we
[23:03] know that amen so we are born contrary
[23:08] to God from the
[23:09] beginning so God's got to change as Paul
[23:12] says having a newness of mind having a
[23:16] newness of speech having a newness of
[23:20] thought because this is all contrary to
[23:23] God all this that we were at the
[23:25] beginning because we were all contrary
[23:27] to God listen you didn't God when you
[23:28] was a kid you didn't really know
[23:29] anything about
[23:31] it but you grew up and that's where we
[23:33] have to come to we have to come to a
[23:35] place where we
[23:38] graduate from the elementary school
[23:40] middle school to high school to
[23:44] college so them that are wean from the
[23:46] mil look wean from the milk that means
[23:48] they were drinking milk and now they're
[23:50] wean from it everybody with
[23:53] me and drawn from the breast in other
[23:56] words come away from the Mama's breast
[23:58] come away from from depending on Mama to
[24:00] give you your
[24:02] nourishment everybody with me now watch
[24:06] for precept must be just a little bit
[24:09] upon precept precept must be a sometimes
[24:12] precept no the Bible says precept must
[24:15] be upon must be upon precept right
[24:18] precepts upon precept he says that twice
[24:21] line upon line line upon line here a
[24:24] little and there a little for with
[24:27] stammering lips and another tongue will
[24:29] he speak to this people remember Paul
[24:31] tells us that it would be great to speak
[24:35] with tongues and and Paul set that in
[24:36] order that that we could have diversity
[24:39] of tongues and speaking in tongues he
[24:41] said but what' he say give me five words
[24:43] in other words spoken by
[24:45] Revelation give me five words inspired
[24:48] by God that we can all understand he
[24:51] said I'll take that over that any
[24:53] day you say I don't I've never spoke
[24:55] with tongues yeah you have when you you
[24:58] talk about God doing something in your
[25:00] life and it's a revelation and you tell
[25:02] somebody out there about it you're
[25:04] speaking in tongues to them right
[25:06] because they're not understanding what
[25:08] you're talking
[25:09] about but that's okay there's an
[25:12] interpretation there that's
[25:15] yours hallelujah it's an interpretation
[25:19] that's yours personal
[25:21] interpretation remember the Bible even
[25:23] tells us if you stand if you speak in
[25:25] tongues and there's nobody to interpret
[25:27] it it's for you
[25:29] it's for you to have right
[25:32] Hallelujah so when don't get hung up
[25:35] with I've never spoke in tongues you
[25:37] speak in tongues all the
[25:39] time tongues is an unknown
[25:42] language
[25:44] right you speak an unknown language when
[25:47] we go downstairs and we talk about
[25:49] serpent seed or we talk about one God or
[25:51] we talk about water baptism that is
[25:54] speaking in tongues right you are
[25:57] speaking in a heavenly language that man
[25:59] cannot understand you ought to be happy
[26:02] for that that God's give you
[26:06] that to whom he said this is the rest
[26:09] wherein you may cause the weary to rest
[26:12] and this is the refreshing yet they
[26:15] would not
[26:17] hear but the word of the Lord was UN to
[26:20] them precept upon precept precept upon
[26:23] precept line upon line line upon line
[26:25] here a little there a little look that
[26:28] they might go and fall backwards be
[26:32] broken snared and taken even though they
[26:36] heard it line upon line precept upon
[26:38] precept they didn't receive it right so
[26:41] it was a stumbling block amen it was
[26:44] they were broken they fell backwards
[26:46] they were snared and taken that's what
[26:48] happened if you'll keep reading the
[26:51] early history of the church and brother
[26:53] R covers it some with the Nan counsel
[26:55] that that the true that prophets went to
[26:58] nah men of God went to NAA to try to get
[27:02] them to understand and he said they got
[27:04] there and they couldn't do it why cuz
[27:06] Satan was taking over and God was
[27:08] allowing that to happen because there
[27:10] had to be a dark ages there had to be a
[27:12] dark time so that you and I could come
[27:15] out of that dark time listen you and I
[27:17] have dark
[27:19] time you and I go through seasons and
[27:22] dark time but remember it's just a
[27:25] season it's just a season right amen
[27:30] don't make it a year just go through a
[27:33] season Brother Anderson would love for
[27:36] winter to be three days
[27:40] long he look like Sasquatch back there a
[27:42] few minutes ago with all that garby had
[27:44] on to keep yourself warm but that's all
[27:46] right I told you know brother you're up
[27:48] there this tall you ought to be a little
[27:49] bit warmer than the rest of
[27:52] us but that we go through a season
[27:54] listen how are we going to really really
[27:58] appreciate
[28:00] spring without this right
[28:02] here you're not going to appreciate
[28:05] spring you're going to appreciate spring
[28:07] when we come in here and go man it's 70°
[28:09] outside and I don't have to bundle up
[28:13] now look at this let's just for a
[28:17] second said who shall make them
[28:20] understand Doctrine shall teach
[28:21] knowledge and understand Doctrine cuz
[28:23] what we're doing is is we're looking at
[28:26] a restored Doctrine right now today
[28:29] today you have been restored back to the
[28:32] faith of the first church
[28:35] age you can get excited about it or you
[28:37] don't have to get excited about it but
[28:39] I'm excited that God has put me in a
[28:41] place where I can that I can walk like
[28:44] Paul I can walk like Peter I can walk
[28:46] like James and John all the different
[28:49] ones and listen we can listen now at the
[28:53] Bible read the Bible understand what the
[28:55] Bible says because of their teaching and
[28:58] that do that Doctrine through the
[29:00] prophet through the Elijah number four
[29:03] has been restored back to the faith of
[29:06] the fathers
[29:08] right but now remember we got to keep
[29:10] going on we can't stay there though
[29:12] right all right so look let's look at
[29:14] what I looked up this word teaching that
[29:18] which is taught are Doctrine so even
[29:20] Jesus they they talk about his teaching
[29:22] and he talks about his teaching he's
[29:24] talking about his
[29:26] Doctrine right concerning something you
[29:29] got to have a specific Doctrine you say
[29:32] well I just believe anything that's not
[29:33] a
[29:35] Doctrine you got to believe the truth or
[29:38] you believe in error listen there's only
[29:40] you only got two ways you got right and
[29:43] wrong now you may be in transition from
[29:46] wrong to right or you even may be in
[29:49] transition from right to wrong we've
[29:50] seen people do that but they never had
[29:53] anything to hold them over here like the
[29:55] scripture says they weren't rooted and
[29:57] grounded they didn't have good teaching
[30:00] they didn't have the depth taught to
[30:01] them so that their Roots now listen how
[30:03] does a root get further down into the
[30:06] ground the Wind
[30:08] Blows the wind blows in big pecan trees
[30:11] in my
[30:12] yard pray that don't ever flip them over
[30:15] but every time I see him do that I think
[30:18] man about 20 feet under that ground that
[30:20] Root's moving and what it's doing is
[30:22] it's loosening the dirt up so that now
[30:25] in septe or in or in March when the
[30:28] growing season starts they can start
[30:29] shooting up again because they've got
[30:31] what they've got root they've got
[30:33] they're grounded and
[30:35] settled so number two look the act of
[30:37] teaching now this is Doctrine
[30:39] instruction in religious Assemblies of
[30:41] the Christians to speak in the way of
[30:44] teaching so in other words you can't
[30:46] just say I've got a Doctrine and not be
[30:48] able to tell
[30:50] it
[30:51] hello come on you the doctrine you have
[30:54] is you you are the doctrine
[30:58] Amen to speak in the way of teaching
[31:02] remember the Bible Paul tells us you got
[31:04] to give a reason of the hope that lies
[31:06] inside of you if you can't explain why
[31:09] God saved you if you can't explain how
[31:11] you're not why you're in this
[31:14] message and the Mysteries that were
[31:16] restored back that they had already
[31:19] right it's in the Bible right then you I
[31:23] don't know where you're at I don't know
[31:24] where you
[31:24] been amen that's right
[31:29] it doesn't hurt my feelings for you to
[31:32] explain what you
[31:35] understand
[31:38] okay doesn't hurt my feelings at
[31:41] all I've had people call and say hey can
[31:43] you come talk to this
[31:45] person I thought man if you can't
[31:47] explain water baptism you got a problem
[31:50] right I'm telling you don't be calling
[31:52] me to explain water baptism to somebody
[31:54] you better be able to do it yourself you
[31:56] better be able to understand and be able
[31:58] to tell that's your Doctrine Hallelujah
[32:00] are we just sitting here like brother
[32:02] Daryl was saying we just come here and
[32:04] we're instead of Standing on the
[32:06] Promises we're just sitting on the
[32:07] premises
[32:09] Hallelujah yeah Hallelujah when you get
[32:11] that interpreted you'll understand
[32:14] it I mean really that's right to speak
[32:18] in the way of teaching in distinction
[32:20] from other modes of speaking in public
[32:23] do you know what's going to change our
[32:25] body our Doctrine that's right yes our
[32:29] Doctrine is what's going to change our
[32:31] body it's going to literally change you
[32:34] from a from
[32:36] a some of us that are old but from a
[32:39] corrupt body to an incorrupt
[32:42] body and it doesn't matter if you're
[32:44] buried in in in the
[32:47] grave that doesn't go
[32:49] away you just take the doctrine from
[32:52] here and that Doctrine is what takes you
[32:54] there but you know what's going to
[32:55] happen that Doctrine is not going to go
[32:57] away that doctrine's going to bring them
[32:58] back here right amen I just believe that
[33:03] 100% they're not sitting over there
[33:05] brother D all the they're not just
[33:06] sitting over there
[33:08] going no they're having a Hallelujah
[33:12] time and they know that they're not in
[33:15] their right to be conditioned they know
[33:18] because of their Doctrine because
[33:20] they've been taught right that they're
[33:22] going to come back here pick up their
[33:25] body and we're going to take a Rapture
[33:29] and a moment in the twinkling of an
[33:36] eye to teach one to impart
[33:40] instruction what did Jesus do when Jesus
[33:42] came on earth look right here Luke 4:3
[33:46] 32 and they were astonished at his
[33:50] Doctrine for his word was with
[33:55] power in other words what he said he
[33:57] lived it and what he said happened now
[34:01] remember remember though there there was
[34:04] a
[34:05] mystery because the son of man had a
[34:07] mystery to him that wasn't revealed when
[34:10] he was here on
[34:13] Earth that was withholding for this day
[34:16] when the son of man be risen again from
[34:18] the dead he's going to tell us how to
[34:20] get our body changed he's going to tell
[34:22] us how to live a life exemplary to God
[34:28] and not this world so they were
[34:30] astonished at his Doctrine what they
[34:32] were astonished at his
[34:33] teaching to teach one to impart listen
[34:36] he was trying to instill if you those of
[34:39] you that are still watching
[34:41] chosen Jesus was a human
[34:44] man and he had
[34:47] frustrations he said they're not getting
[34:49] he told his mom he said they're not
[34:50] getting what I
[34:51] say because of this remember she said
[34:53] well I know you're a human I to change
[34:55] your diaper right but he was so much
[34:59] human but he would he every day he would
[35:03] expound on
[35:05] something and they might have been days
[35:07] he was on vacation it might have been
[35:08] days he didn't feel good hello
[35:11] somebody but when he spoke he spoke with
[35:14] a man of as a man of authority but they
[35:17] weren't getting it because without the
[35:19] Holy Ghost you can't get but just the
[35:20] surface of what Jesus was teaching
[35:23] that's right and he said it in Parables
[35:25] so nobody can understand it but the
[35:27] disciples but they weren't going to
[35:29] understand it until the Holy Ghost
[35:31] come wait from power on high from on
[35:33] high remember being DED from with power
[35:35] from on high then you'll understand
[35:37] these things but what they had to do is
[35:39] they had to pack it into their heart
[35:41] they had to go to church they had to
[35:43] they had to go with him everywhere he
[35:45] went everybody with
[35:48] me the thing taught to explain or
[35:51] expound a thing or to teach one
[35:54] something listen Jesus might have got
[35:57] frustrated ated but he knew his work was
[36:00] not what cuz see remember they kept
[36:02] asking
[36:03] him when's the kingdom
[36:06] coming when you Resto you say you're
[36:08] leaving uh you're you're you said thy
[36:11] kingdom come thy will be
[36:13] done that's what he said to pray told
[36:15] them to pray that right right they
[36:18] thought it was right then because they
[36:19] were carnal right they had carnal
[36:22] interpretation but I'll promise you on
[36:24] the day of Pentecost they didn't have
[36:26] that anymore right they walked out
[36:28] inside and said look our work's not over
[36:31] it just now
[36:32] started the work of Jesus is not over it
[36:35] just got
[36:38] started so Luke 4:32 says they were
[36:42] astonished at his Doctrine for his word
[36:45] was with
[36:47] power John
[36:49] 7:16 Jesus answered them and said my
[36:53] Doctrine is not
[36:55] mine but his that sent me
[36:59] If any man will do his
[37:01] will he shall know of the doctrine
[37:04] whether it be of God now watch If any
[37:06] man do his will in other words what and
[37:08] if anybody do does the father's will if
[37:11] you're doing the will of the father
[37:14] you'll know the doctrine's right whether
[37:16] it be of God or whether I speak of
[37:19] myself he that speaketh of himself
[37:22] seeketh his own Glory you got to come to
[37:24] see me because I'm the only one that's
[37:25] got the Revelation we've heard heard
[37:27] that before right that's
[37:31] garbage garbage what do you do with
[37:33] garbage you throw it in
[37:34] trash he that speaketh of himself
[37:37] seeketh his own Glory but he that
[37:39] seeketh his glory that sent
[37:42] him we as ministers don't seek our own
[37:46] Glory right amen we're telling you about
[37:49] our father amen we're telling you
[37:52] expounding our Doctrine about God not
[37:56] us right brother randam did the same
[37:58] thing he never said sure he said this is
[38:00] my Doctrine sure he said this is my
[38:03] Revelation but that we know he was a
[38:06] prophet and God spoke straight to
[38:09] him I wish God would speak straight to
[38:12] us every once in a
[38:14] while amen well praise the Lord anyhow
[38:17] I'm sorry pray for
[38:23] me but he that seeketh his glory that
[38:25] sent him the same is true now watch and
[38:29] no unrighteousness is in
[38:31] him look how strong that Doctrine is and
[38:34] you know where it comes from listen we
[38:36] know we heard this we heard these great
[38:39] mysteries from brother randam when he
[38:41] spoke them because what happened was and
[38:44] we'll look at in a minute down Through
[38:45] the Ages it got all
[38:49] changed right and listen God winked at
[38:52] their ignorance but there was no power
[38:55] in false Doctrine there is no power in
[38:57] false
[38:58] Doctrine they think now Satan will give
[39:01] them a permitted power cuz remember they
[39:03] speak in
[39:04] tongues they do all these things right
[39:08] right but they can't put the word
[39:11] together that's the whole thing they
[39:13] can't put the word together Satan cannot
[39:15] put this word together he can take a
[39:16] piece over here what he do in the
[39:19] garden he took a piece of the word added
[39:21] a word and killed
[39:24] everybody but he that seeketh his glory
[39:26] that sent him the same is true and no
[39:27] unrighteousness is in it did not Moses
[39:30] now
[39:31] watch what's Jesus standing there saying
[39:33] you're not listening to me I am telling
[39:36] you the truth I am telling you about my
[39:39] father and you're not
[39:41] listening because what does he say in
[39:43] verse 19 did not Moses give you now he's
[39:46] pointing to the he's pointing to the
[39:48] Pharisees and
[39:50] Sadducees did not Moses give you the
[39:53] law and yet none of you keepeth the law
[39:57] right why go you about to kill
[40:02] me acts
[40:04] 238 Peter said unto them repent and be
[40:07] baptized every one of you in the name of
[40:08] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[40:10] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[40:12] Ghost that's pretty clear for the
[40:14] promises unto you and to your children
[40:18] and to all that are far off even as many
[40:20] as the Lord Our God shall
[40:22] call every bit of that got diluted every
[40:25] bit of that got erased out it got looked
[40:28] over and if people could do it they
[40:30] would tear that page out of the
[40:33] Bible brother Robert Tatum said that he
[40:36] when he was a Pentecostal said he look
[40:37] he'd get to acts two and he just flip
[40:39] over to acts three or four he didn't
[40:42] want to see
[40:43] that because he couldn't explain it but
[40:45] praise God one day God shined light on
[40:48] it and he didn't do away with it
[40:53] anymore and with many other words did he
[40:56] testify in his saying save yourself from
[40:59] this untour generation then they that
[41:01] gladly now watch they gladly received

[41:33] Doctrine right they didn't waver from
[41:36] it they understood it and with the Holy
[41:38] Ghost they understood that that was the
[41:41] truth and in Breaking of bread and in
[41:44] prayer oh Fellowship

[42:48] to follow it because of their what
[42:50] previous doctrinal
[42:52] teaching what brother rown tell us
[42:54] marriage and divorce he said the reason
[42:56] we're in the sh par in is because of one
[42:59] thing

[43:17] false right
[43:21] amen his servants you are to whom you
[43:24] obey whether of sin unto death or of
[43:27] obedience unto righteousness but God be
[43:30] than that you were the Servants of sin
[43:34] but you have obeyed from the heart watch
[43:37] heart
[43:38] soul you have obeyed from your soul that
[43:42] form of Doctrine which was delivered
[43:48] you being then made free from sin you
[43:53] become the Servants of righteousness
[43:56] listen Doctrine will either kill you or
[43:59] it'll change your body one of the two
[44:03] amen people are going to go to hell
[44:05] because they hold on to a Doctrine
[44:06] that's
[44:08] false right people are going to go to
[44:10] heaven because the doctrine they hold on
[44:12] that's
[44:13] true so what is Doctrine important
[44:15] uh-huh yes it is very Romans 16:1 17
[44:20] we're going to walk through the
[44:21] scripture a little bit tonight now I
[44:23] beseech you Brethren watch this
[44:27] now listen we should exercise brotherly
[44:31] kindness to
[44:32] everyone right
[44:34] right but now watch what Paul the
[44:38] prophet messenger said to do to somebody
[44:41] that had a false
[44:43] Doctrine now beseech you Brethren mark
[44:46] them which cause Division and offenses
[44:50] contrary the doctrine which you have
[44:53] learned and avoid them amen
[44:58] and avoid
[45:00] them for they that are such serve not
[45:03] our Lord Jesus Christ but their own
[45:06] belly and by good words and fair
[45:09] speeches deceive The Souls of the
[45:15] simple those people in NAA got their
[45:18] soul deceived by the devil through those
[45:21] priest and all the different
[45:23] things everybody with me
[45:27] Ephesians
[45:29] 4:11 and he gave some Apostles and some
[45:31] prophets and some evangelists and some
[45:33] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[45:36] of the Saints for the work of the
[45:37] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[45:39] Christ look till we all come to the
[45:42] unity of the fath so we got to come to
[45:43] that Unity of the Faith by what the
[45:46] doctrine of those five ministers
[45:48] fivefold Ministry
[45:50] amen till we all come to the in the
[45:53] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[45:55] now what teaching
[45:57] teaching of the Son of God unto a
[46:01] perfect man unto the measure of the
[46:03] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[46:05] we henceforth be no more children watch
[46:08] tossed to and fro carried about with
[46:11] every wind of Doctrine
[46:15] amen that's what blue in the Dark Ages
[46:19] is a wind of Doctrine blew over here and
[46:22] they well we'll take this and then then
[46:25] you got somebody like Constantine that
[46:26] said say I can't defeat him with my Army
[46:30] but we're going to take all that and
[46:32] we're going to defeat them now he didn't
[46:35] say that but the devil inside of him was
[46:37] doing the same thing he was a tool in
[46:39] the hands of the devil to get those
[46:41] people to believe that now they're very
[46:44] religious because of him seeing a vision
[46:46] or whatever more but it was totally
[46:49] false all
[46:50] right that we henceforth be no more
[46:53] children tossed to and fro and carried
[46:54] away with every wind of Doctrine what by
[46:57] the slight of men by the slot of the men
[47:00] of those five-fold Ministry that we were
[47:02] talking that are
[47:05] false where does false Doctrine come
[47:07] from it doesn't come from the air it
[47:11] comes from somebody teaching you
[47:13] that by the slot of men and cunning
[47:16] craftiness whereby they lie in weight to
[47:21] deceive so it's not some Fly by Night
[47:23] something the preachers got in a pull
[47:25] pit and they started preaching what
[47:26] happened
[47:27] in NAA that everything got changed to a
[47:29] father son Holy Ghost Doctrine we're
[47:31] going to now baptize in the name of
[47:32] father son Holy Ghost we're going to say
[47:34] there's an eternal hell there's a
[47:36] Purgatory all these different things
[47:38] Mary Mary resurrected with
[47:41] Jesus you know that's what the Catholic
[47:43] believe
[47:46] right that's why they glorified or deif
[47:49] deified Mary and you know what you ask
[47:53] the Catholic they'll die for what they
[47:55] believe CU they've been told it since
[47:57] they were a
[47:58] kid what told it doctrinally told
[48:02] it but speaking the truth in love may
[48:07] grow up into him in all things which is
[48:09] the head even Christ from whom the whole
[48:12] body fitly joined now look fitly joined
[48:15] together not clay
[48:17] and iron not flesh and
[48:22] wood fitly joined the whole body fitly
[48:25] joined together your body to today is
[48:27] made out of Flesh right all right
[48:31] there's no wood Parts some of you may
[48:33] have operation you got some metal Parts
[48:35] but that's not
[48:38] original and compacted by that which
[48:41] every joint suppli according to the
[48:43] effectual working in the measure what of
[48:45] every part
[48:48] body maketh increase of the body until
[48:51] the edifying of itself and love this I
[48:54] say therefore in testifying the Lord
[48:56] that look you henceforth walk not as
[48:59] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[49:02] their
[49:04] mind H look now watch having the
[49:08] understanding having the
[49:10] doctrine
[49:12] darkened being alienated from the life
[49:15] of God through the ignorance that is in
[49:19] them because of the blindness of their
[49:23] heart amen Jesus didn't didn't Jesus say
[49:27] give sight to the blind right that's
[49:29] what he come to do he come to do all
[49:30] these
[49:32] things 1 Timothy
[49:35] 1:3 and I besought Thee to abide still
[49:38] at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia
[49:41] that thy look now
[49:43] watch that thou mightest charge some
[49:47] that they teach no other Doctrine that's
[49:51] right neither give them heed to fables
[49:55] and endless geneal ologies which
[49:57] minister
[49:59] questions rather than Godly edifying
[50:02] which is in faith so do in other words
[50:03] he's sending somebody to go straighten
[50:06] out of Doctrine and tell them you're
[50:08] wrong Welly that'd work in the message
[50:10] wouldn't
[50:13] it 1 Timothy
[50:15] 4:6 if thou put the brethren in
[50:17] remembrance of these things Thou shalt
[50:19] be a good minister of Jesus Christ
[50:22] nourished up in the words of faith and
[50:25] of good Doctrine
[50:27] whereinto thou Hast attained you got to
[50:30] get
[50:32] it but refuse profane and old wives
[50:36] fables and exercise thyself rather unto
[50:39] godliness 1 Timothy 4:16 take heed unto
[50:43] thyself and unto the doctrine now this
[50:46] is Paul speaking and unto the doctrine
[50:49] continue in them for in doing this Thou
[50:52] shalt both save thyself and them that
[50:56] hear thee
[50:59] amen 1 Timothy
[51:02] 6:3 If any man Teach otherwise and
[51:06] consent not to the wholesome words even
[51:09] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[51:11] to the doctrine which is according to
[51:13] Godliness he is proud knowing nothing
[51:16] but doting about questions and Stripes
[51:18] of words whereof cometh Envy Strife
[51:20] railing and evil surmising perverse
[51:23] disputing of men now watch perverse
[51:26] disputing of men of corrupt minds and
[51:29] watch what he said destitute of the
[51:32] truth amen suppose that gain is
[51:38] godliness from such withdraw
[51:43] thyself second Timothy 3:16 all
[51:46] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[51:49] and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro
[51:53] for correction for instruction and
[51:55] righteousness that the man of God may be
[51:59] perfect thoroughly furnished and to all
[52:02] good works Doctrine is important true
[52:05] Doctrine is the only way you're going to
[52:07] get out of
[52:09] here that's why God winked at the
[52:12] ignorance down through the church ages
[52:13] but when we come to this age right here
[52:16] this is the age that ends everything
[52:18] this is the age that Gentiles will be
[52:20] finished up and God will go to the Jews
[52:23] so there had to come a restoration even
[52:25] back to where God can deal with the
[52:28] people like he dealt with them in the in
[52:30] the first church age second Church age
[52:32] Third Church age
[52:34] amen and brother R stood and prooved he
[52:37] said the proof of the Resurrection you
[52:39] got the healing campaigns you got the
[52:41] the the um Discerning of the thoughts
[52:43] and intents of the heart just what Jesus
[52:45] did when he walked on the face of the
[52:47] Earth and and I just want to say this
[52:50] those people that thought he was God if
[52:52] you walked with him every day you might
[52:54] say it too I'm about brother brandom
[52:57] amen because of all the miraculous
[52:59] things and all the spiritual things that
[53:01] he he just worked in a world that was
[53:03] completely totally different from
[53:05] anything we we try to be we try to be
[53:07] spiritual and we ain't even
[53:10] close man will walk up to you and say
[53:12] hey if you want to find those deer go
[53:16] that way there'll be seven of them over
[53:18] there on that hill just pick the one you
[53:20] want and shoot
[53:21] it don't go over here your car keys are
[53:25] over there
[53:27] we'll get that for you everything will
[53:29] be fine don't you worry and it all came
[53:32] true it all came true you would have
[53:35] thought Jesus Christ was back on Earth
[53:37] again but we know it wasn't we know
[53:39] that's false but see that's how close
[53:42] that Satan can
[53:44] get even doctrinally get to where you
[53:47] look with your natural eyes and you see
[53:50] somebody that act so much like God they
[53:52] think they're God but listen there's one
[53:54] quality that you and I don't have that
[53:56] Jesus had
[53:59] one we were all born by
[54:02] sex he was
[54:04] not period every person since Adam Eve
[54:08] Cain Abel they were well not Adam and
[54:10] Eve but Cain and Abel the product of
[54:12] were born by sex he was
[54:14] not if you can if you can claim you're
[54:17] not then we'll we'll talk about
[54:20] it but I doubt that very
[54:23] seriously preach the word be instant in
[54:26] season out of season reprove rebuke
[54:29] reprove rebuke exhort with all what
[54:32] longsuffering and Doctrine what reprove
[54:35] rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and
[54:39] Doctrine for the time will come when
[54:42] they will not endure sound Doctrine they
[54:45] will not endure the
[54:48] truth but after their own lust shall
[54:50] they Heap to themselves teachers having
[54:53] itching ears and they shall turn away
[54:55] their ears from the truth and shall be
[54:57] turned unto fables the Bible talks about
[55:00] fables sever time several times it's all
[55:02] connected to Doctrine listen if it's not
[55:04] truth it's a
[55:08] fable Titus 1 ver9 holding fast the
[55:12] faithful word as he ha been taught that
[55:15] he may be able by sound Doctrine both to
[55:18] exhort and to convince the
[55:21] gainsayers for there are many unruly and
[55:24] vain talkers and deceivers
[55:27] especially they of the circumcision
[55:29] talking about the
[55:30] Gentiles I mean the Jews right right who
[55:34] so mouth Must Be
[55:37] Stopped who subvert whole houses
[55:42] teaching things which they ought not for
[55:46] filthy luker's
[55:48] sake amen pretty tough old
[55:51] Paul Hebrews 6 verse1 now watch
[55:57] this has come to the end right here Paul
[55:59] gives us all that we read in Romans we
[56:03] read in Timothy we read in Corinthians
[56:05] he's talking about Doctrine exhort talk
[56:07] to them this this this this so Hebrews 6
[56:10] verse1 he says therefore leaving the
[56:13] principles of the doctrine of
[56:16] Christ I'll explain that in just a
[56:18] second because you go to the Greek and
[56:19] you'll see exactly why he said it the
[56:21] way he said it let us go on into
[56:24] Perfection not laying again the
[56:26] foundation of repentance from dead works
[56:28] and of Faith toward God he's not saying
[56:32] that we must do away with those
[56:35] principles everybody with me we can't do
[56:38] away with the doctrine of baptism we may
[56:40] have a baptism not too far in the future
[56:44] laying on of hands we still believe in
[56:45] that can't take it out of the
[56:47] Bible and of resurrection of the Dead
[56:50] absolutely and of Eternal judgment and
[56:52] this we will do will we do if God permit
[56:57] now that word leaving now watch leaving
[57:00] now if we come to this church and we
[57:04] leave and go home does that do away with
[57:06] the
[57:07] church church is still here so that word
[57:11] leaving according to the strong
[57:12] concordance in order to go to another
[57:16] place so he's saying leaving not leaving
[57:19] and doing away but leaving this building
[57:22] the building's still going to be here
[57:24] and go on to perfection yes to leave so
[57:27] that what is left May
[57:30] remain leave
[57:33] remaining not doing away
[57:35] with the word
[57:37] principles that by which anything begins
[57:40] to be the origin are look the active
[57:44] cause so the active cause of us standing
[57:46] here today the only reason we're going
[57:48] to understand the seals and we're going
[57:50] to understand what brother Brown talks
[57:52] about the the three PS and and the
[57:55] Thunders and all these great Mysteries
[57:57] is because we have left the principles
[58:00] but we have went through the
[58:01] principles we've went through the
[58:03] principles of the doctrine of Christ we
[58:05] have not done away with them but we have
[58:08] come this building just for say this
[58:10] building is
[58:12] partial this building got a sleepy
[58:15] Spirit on it bless y'all's
[58:18] heart this building is partial just
[58:21] say now with that building over there is
[58:24] perfect you got to go go through this
[58:27] first you got to go through first grade
[58:29] second grade third grade fourth grade
[58:30] fifth grade right then you go into
[58:32] another building so you're
[58:34] leaving grammar school but you're not
[58:36] doing away with grammar
[58:39] school everybody with me so that he's
[58:41] not saying leave like leave it we don't
[58:43] need to teach no they still there's
[58:46] still people coming in there's still new
[58:48] people that need to learn that need to
[58:50] go what you went through what you went
[58:52] through and have patience long suffering
[58:56] I read you the scripture a minute ago
[58:58] longsuffering with people right all
[59:04] right so therefore leaving the principle
[59:06] of the doctrine of Christ let's go into
[59:07] Perfection listen if we just preach on
[59:10] what if we preach on water baptism today
[59:13] and then Sunday we preached on water
[59:15] baptism and then Wednesday brother Bob
[59:17] gets up and he takes his scripture acts
[59:20] 238 it it'd be a little it wouldn't be
[59:24] it would be exciting for some but others
[59:26] would say give me some more there's more
[59:29] to that because remember the Bible says
[59:31] there's a
[59:33] promise the promise is to you what
[59:35] promise tell me about the
[59:37] promise the promise is God's going to
[59:40] take you to this
[59:41] doctrine of the message of the hour and
[59:44] he's going to change your
[59:45] body amen second John 1 ver9 who so
[59:50] transgresses and watch who so
[59:53] transgresseth and not abides not
[59:56] in the doctrine of Christ hath not
[1:00:00] God this is
[1:00:02] John second John he that abideth in the
[1:00:06] doctrine of Christ he has both the
[1:00:08] father and the
[1:00:12] son cuz we understand what we understand
[1:00:14] they're the
[1:00:16] same we understand there's an IMM
[1:00:18] morphing from father to son amen but not
[1:00:21] doing away with the
[1:00:23] father we understand that right the
[1:00:27] trinitarian says look there's a father
[1:00:28] there's a Son and the Holy Ghost must be
[1:00:33] somewhere false Doctrine versus
[1:00:37] truth y now
[1:00:39] watch if there come any unto you and
[1:00:44] bring not this
[1:00:47] Doctrine receive him not into your
[1:00:52] house this is John John the Revelator
[1:00:58] receive him not into your house neither
[1:01:03] bid him God speed I'm reading the Bible
[1:01:06] y'all don't CL don't clam up on me I'm
[1:01:08] reading the Bible this is the Bible it's
[1:01:10] not my
[1:01:11] opinion amen neither bid him God speed
[1:01:15] for he that bth him bth him God speed is
[1:01:21] partakers of his evil
[1:01:24] Deeds I can say that again partakers of
[1:01:28] his evil
[1:01:32] Deeds let me read that one more time for
[1:01:35] he that bth him God's speed is partaker
[1:01:39] of his evil
[1:01:42] Deeds acts 20:
[1:01:46] 27 Paul's saying but for I have not shun
[1:01:49] to declare unto you all the counsel of
[1:01:52] God in other words all the doctrine of
[1:01:54] God take heed therefore unto yourselves
[1:01:56] and to all the flock over the which the
[1:01:59] Holy Ghost has made you overseers to
[1:02:01] feed the Church of God which he ha
[1:02:04] purchased with his own blood for I know
[1:02:06] this that after my departing now this is
[1:02:10] right before he dies after my departing
[1:02:13] shall Grievious wolves enter in among
[1:02:16] you not sparing the flock now look you
[1:02:18] would think if you stopped right there
[1:02:20] you think well now Paul will be will be
[1:02:24] aware cuz cuz somebody's going to come
[1:02:26] in and try to bring a false Doctrine
[1:02:28] somebody's going to come in the door
[1:02:30] somebody
[1:02:31] going verse 30 takes care all that also
[1:02:36] of your own
[1:02:40] selves shall men arise speaking perverse
[1:02:45] things to draw away disciples after them
[1:02:51] amen also of your own self in other
[1:02:53] words he's speaking to a congregation
[1:02:55] maybe he's having a a Minister's
[1:02:57] meeting yeah let's make it a little more
[1:02:59] personal maybe he's having a Minister's
[1:03:01] meeting he said oh be care beware them
[1:03:04] Grievous wi I'm sure they're all going
[1:03:05] yeah we need we're good we're good here
[1:03:08] Paul we're good we're good he said also
[1:03:10] of yourself shall men arise speaking
[1:03:14] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:03:16] after them now that's what happened in
[1:03:17] the message this great glorious message
[1:03:19] that all the all the doctrines have been
[1:03:21] restored and everything has been wide
[1:03:24] open amen yet that's happened already
[1:03:28] many many
[1:03:32] times couple of quotes and then we'll be
[1:03:36] done he must be born again 1961 now God
[1:03:39] bless his word and I want to take the
[1:03:41] subject this morning of Jesus's first
[1:03:44] Doctrine the first doctrine of Jesus was
[1:03:47] you must be born again that was his
[1:03:49] first Doctrine now listen he's preaching
[1:03:52] in 1961 sure he's in Jeffersonville but
[1:03:54] there's Methodist
[1:03:58] that says sprankling gets me in the body
[1:04:00] right there's Baptist that says shaking
[1:04:03] of hands and and a letter and good
[1:04:06] standing I told sister Rebecca Calhoun

[1:04:10] just one of us your letter still
[1:04:14] here but we we laugh but I'll promise
[1:04:18] you they hold on that letter amen and if
[1:04:22] they get mad at this one and go to the
[1:04:23] other place they demand their letter
[1:04:26] right cuz their Holy Ghost is going with
[1:04:29] them remember we had that who was it was
[1:04:34] it Judy Judy's sister somebody was
[1:04:36] sitting in front of us remember she
[1:04:38] turned around she said fact guy Don't
[1:04:39] Preach what in other words Don't Preach
[1:04:41] what I like I'm moving my letter like
[1:04:43] you know like the whole place is going
[1:04:44] to collapse because she's going to take
[1:04:46] her letter she said that she turn she I
[1:04:49] don't like his he keeps on what he's
[1:04:50] doing I'm just going to take my letter
[1:04:51] and go somewhere
[1:04:52] else like Daddy said that brother that
[1:04:55] son and and father and son got mad at
[1:04:57] General Motors and said Come On Son
[1:04:59] let's go home I'm tired like the whole
[1:05:00] place is going to
[1:05:02] collapse
[1:05:04] yeah it ain't going to collap no sir
[1:05:08] your letter the Letter's not going to do
[1:05:10] you any
[1:05:11] good so look the first Doctrine Jesus
[1:05:14] preached was you must be born again now
[1:05:16] how many different ways of being born
[1:05:17] again has there
[1:05:21] developed that was his very first
[1:05:23] Doctrine he told Nicodemus not you must
[1:05:26] believe the
[1:05:30] message not you must speak in tongues as
[1:05:33] the Pentecostal say to get the Holy
[1:05:35] Ghost false Doctrine out of a
[1:05:41] truth right Baptist like I said Shake
[1:05:43] hand y'all may think it's strange but we
[1:05:46] have a lot of Baptist friends and if you
[1:05:48] ever make that decision and they shake
[1:05:50] your hand and turn you around and feel
[1:05:52] like that little letter I was talking
[1:05:53] about you don't have to darken the the
[1:05:55] doors of the church again they believe
[1:05:57] in eternal security that once saved
[1:05:59] always saved you can go out and live
[1:06:01] with 25 women Smoke Drink cuss and run
[1:06:03] around and die 50 years later and
[1:06:05] they'll put you in the ground as a good
[1:06:07] Baptist now that is their Doctrine and
[1:06:10] it's absolutely
[1:06:12] false there's people going to their
[1:06:15] grave that's going to say
[1:06:19] oops I said the worst oops moment moment
[1:06:22] is when those terrorists and they're
[1:06:24] supposed to get 72 birdg and they're
[1:06:26] supposed to have all I don't why it's 72
[1:06:28] they get 72 virgins and they're going to
[1:06:30] have all this eternal Bliss when they
[1:06:33] blow when they pull that trigger and
[1:06:35] their body comes completely apart and
[1:06:37] their soul goes over another dimension
[1:06:38] that's the first thing going say is a
[1:06:42] whoops
[1:06:44] what but the doctrine is what made him
[1:06:46] pull that
[1:06:48] trigger false Doctrine is what M oh well
[1:06:51] true to
[1:06:53] him true listen will you give your life
[1:06:56] will you pull the trigger for your
[1:06:57] gospel I ain't talking about literally
[1:06:59] pulling I'm talking about if God didn't
[1:07:01] he's not going to do it but listen there
[1:07:03] was a man one time he told God he said
[1:07:06] thank you for all the things you've done
[1:07:07] he said the first thing comes through
[1:07:08] that door I'm going to sacrifice it
[1:07:12] right what was the first thing come
[1:07:14] through that door his
[1:07:17] daughter and listen even his daughter
[1:07:20] didn't pitch a
[1:07:21] fit she said give me a month or two to
[1:07:24] go and whail my my virginity in other
[1:07:26] words she was a young lady and then we
[1:07:28] come
[1:07:30] back some of us wouldve been screaming
[1:07:32] and going to a different
[1:07:34] country we we'd be under the um what
[1:07:38] Witness Protection
[1:07:40] Program 1962 restoration of the brid
[1:07:43] tree where did that first Doctrine come
[1:07:46] from outside of the Bible you historians
[1:07:49] know where it came from now look where
[1:07:50] did that first Doctrine come from
[1:07:52] outside of the Bible
[1:07:55] you historians you know where it comes
[1:07:57] from from Rome exactly where it started
[1:08:01] there they started accepting Dogma
[1:08:03] that's how irenius St Martin polycarp
[1:08:06] all of them after John's death for
[1:08:09] translating the word of God was on the
[1:08:10] aisle of patmas they burned him in
[1:08:13] Greece for 24 hours brought him back and
[1:08:15] he still wrote the Bible God was
[1:08:17] determined that this Bible would be
[1:08:19] written that's the word of God we can't
[1:08:22] take away from it or add to it it's to
[1:08:24] lay just the way it is the word now look
[1:08:27] notice when they got back when these
[1:08:30] saints of God trying to hold up that
[1:08:32] word now watch Rome came right in and
[1:08:36] accepted Dogma
[1:08:37] instead now let's just see what she did
[1:08:40] some of her false Doctrine what you done
[1:08:42] water
[1:08:44] baptism where they were commissioned
[1:08:46] Peter said on the day of Pentecost under
[1:08:48] the influence of the Holy Ghost the word
[1:08:50] of God repent every one of you baptize
[1:08:51] in the name of Jesus Christ for your
[1:08:53] remission of your sins what did Rome do
[1:08:55] with it turned it around and said be
[1:08:57] baptized in the name of father son Holy
[1:08:59] Ghost making it a Creed not a doctrine
[1:09:02] of the
[1:09:03] Bible
[1:09:05] right what did he do that's that
[1:09:08] cankerworm eating sprinkling instead of
[1:09:11] immersion he's talking about the
[1:09:13] Methodist all
[1:09:17] right so you see where brother Ram had
[1:09:19] he stood from 47 to 63 we know there was
[1:09:23] a healing campaign going on but he was
[1:09:25] as as John not John as of the second
[1:09:29] first Elijah Elijah had to restore the
[1:09:31] altar back because what happened on that
[1:09:34] day those 400 prophets of Baal brought a
[1:09:36] false
[1:09:38] Doctrine and their false Doctrine
[1:09:40] produced
[1:09:42] zero right nothing they just broke the
[1:09:45] whole altar apart they broke the church
[1:09:47] apart that's what happened and the day
[1:09:49] of nah they broke the church apart right
[1:09:52] they broke the doctrine of God apart so
[1:09:55] God had to start right there with a
[1:09:57] restoration Prophet Elijah in the end
[1:10:00] time to restore these
[1:10:03] doctrines one God not a trinity amen
[1:10:07] water baptism we know for a fact why
[1:10:11] water baptism had to be the way it
[1:10:13] is we know we're doing exactly what the
[1:10:16] Bible said but 99% of the world will
[1:10:19] almost fight
[1:10:21] you over that
[1:10:24] doctrin and The
[1:10:26] Trinity they got Trinity
[1:10:29] everything right and it ain't nowhere in
[1:10:32] the Bible it's say it is a coed up
[1:10:37] lie then brother bandam say the spirit
[1:10:39] that brought that water B that brought
[1:10:41] water baptism name Father Son and Holy
[1:10:42] Ghost come from the pits of Hell
[1:10:47] amen they even believe in Eternal oh
[1:10:49] don't worry about it you talk to the
[1:10:50] Baptist about eternal hell they will
[1:10:52] fight you about that one oh yeah hell's
[1:10:54] eternal hell's Eternal
[1:10:58] right so the Catholics what they did
[1:11:00] they just inserted a place to where you
[1:11:02] can go into a spot there called
[1:11:04] purgatory and if you got enough money
[1:11:07] you can pay and get yourself into heaven
[1:11:09] cuz you're going to
[1:11:11] hell
[1:11:13] right and what happened with Holiness
[1:11:15] conduct and dress brother random stood
[1:11:17] there and he just kept preaching it
[1:11:18] preaching it preaching it bringing out
[1:11:20] the Jezebel spirit bringing about all
[1:11:22] these different things telling us how to
[1:11:24] dress
[1:11:25] but
[1:11:27] remember he did that for 40 years
[1:11:31] almost and there in in streetport on the
[1:11:35] the when he preached invisible union he
[1:11:38] said I come here and every year you
[1:11:39] Pentecostals you cut your hair more
[1:11:41] short you wear in other words he wasn't
[1:11:43] doing any good they were believing the
[1:11:46] doctrine that was false rather than the
[1:11:48] doctrine that was
[1:11:49] true cuz I believe the doctrine that
[1:11:52] William man Brandon brought was truth am
[1:11:54] truth of Church order we know Paul give
[1:11:57] us Church order in the Bible we that's
[1:11:59] where brother Brandon when he do when he
[1:12:01] comes up and says all right we're going
[1:12:02] to talk about church order today
[1:12:03] ordination of deacons how this trustee
[1:12:05] Works how the deacons are supposed to
[1:12:07] work and how this is supposed to work
[1:12:08] and how this is supposed to work well he
[1:12:10] was just reading it straight from Paul
[1:12:12] right it really didn't need an
[1:12:15] interpretation but they had got so much
[1:12:17] away from it till they made the word of
[1:12:20] God of none
[1:12:22] effect serpent seed talk to somebody
[1:12:25] about serpent
[1:12:29] seed the people in the first church age
[1:12:31] knew about
[1:12:33] that they didn't have a false Doctrine
[1:12:37] remember now body change for Abraham and
[1:12:39] Sarah that had to be something in the
[1:12:41] end time cuz nobody else preached that
[1:12:45] before but you could look inside the
[1:12:48] Bible and without changing the Bible you
[1:12:50] know that's what happened we read
[1:12:52] between the lines
[1:12:56] Paul preached on Body Spirit and soul I
[1:12:58] believe Paul understood because he said
[1:12:59] I pray that your whole body spirit and
[1:13:01] soul be held
[1:13:03] blameless in other words under the word
[1:13:05] of
[1:13:06] God I don't believe I believe they
[1:13:08] didn't they didn't they didn't believe
[1:13:10] in a tribulation for the
[1:13:12] bride
[1:13:14] no no why Throne judgment for the
[1:13:17] bride John even said he said Thrones
[1:13:21] there were people there that were on the
[1:13:23] righteous side
[1:13:25] so there were people that didn't have to
[1:13:27] stand judgment they were righteous in
[1:13:29] other words without spot without
[1:13:33] wrinkle righteousness righteous
[1:13:37] people Paul says speaking the truth in
[1:13:40] righteousness let us grow
[1:13:43] up the church ages now I understand one
[1:13:48] thing that Paul irenius Martin Columba
[1:13:51] and different ones they didn't come on
[1:13:52] this Earth and say I am Church AG
[1:13:55] messenger number one I am Church age
[1:13:58] messenger number two no they come in and
[1:14:00] they live their life and they preach the
[1:14:02] gospel they fell under the anointing of
[1:14:05] that book of Revelations 1 through3
[1:14:07] everybody understand what I'm saying and
[1:14:09] they lived their life but it took a
[1:14:11] profit in the end time to reveal who
[1:14:13] those Messengers were cuz brother R even
[1:14:15] said he said now polycarp you would
[1:14:18] think he'd be the
[1:14:19] one but he wasn't militant enough in
[1:14:22] other words he was a compromiser he
[1:14:24] leaned a little fit toward
[1:14:26] organization so God didn't accept
[1:14:29] him statue of perfect man we know it was
[1:14:31] we know the statue of perfect man was
[1:14:34] preached in the early church ages
[1:14:35] Peter's the one that did it right amen
[1:14:38] when he wrote them letters when Peter
[1:14:39] wrote those letters he was preaching to
[1:14:42] somebody and what a man to do that a
[1:14:45] naked fisherman that
[1:14:47] cussed anybody else want to add
[1:14:50] something
[1:14:50] else he cut off somebody's ear he had a
[1:14:54] temper
[1:14:55] about every one of them right there he
[1:14:59] wasn't right right but God picked
[1:15:03] him not us not what you thought about it
[1:15:07] or your neighbor thought about it it's
[1:15:08] what God thought about him and said
[1:15:10] Peter you a you're a changed man you're
[1:15:13] the only one that can tell them
[1:15:15] how to have these virtues
[1:15:20] amen the 70 weeks of Daniel we know
[1:15:23] we're going to study them in a little
[1:15:24] while but that wasn't in the first
[1:15:26] church age they knew Daniel they knew
[1:15:29] all the things that was going on um they
[1:15:32] had an understanding but now we compile
[1:15:36] all this to
[1:15:38] today all right musicians come on we're
[1:15:42] going to compile this all to
[1:15:45] today today we set under the
[1:15:49] understanding of the great Apostle
[1:15:51] Paul right believe his Doctrine which is
[1:15:55] the doctrine of
[1:15:56] God everybody with
[1:15:59] me the doctrine of
[1:16:01] Peter we preach it we teach
[1:16:05] it right amen but you and I got to have
[1:16:09] plus because they're
[1:16:12] dead they had to go to a grave because
[1:16:14] of the word that told them they had to
[1:16:17] go to the
[1:16:20] Grave remember if that seed didn't fall
[1:16:23] on the ground that scripture couldn't be
[1:16:24] full filed so the seed fell in the
[1:16:26] ground at n brother Brown said and then
[1:16:29] have the resurrection or had or come
[1:16:31] back up through the reformers which
[1:16:33] reformers only reform
[1:16:35] people you and I are under a restoration
[1:16:38] which changes us and it will change us
[1:16:41] at a moment in twinkling of an eye we've
[1:16:43] got to have the true doctrine of God I
[1:16:47] believe we have it I believe we are
[1:16:49] standing let's stand to our feet that we
[1:16:52] are standing in the time that all these
[1:16:56] Mysteries are made
[1:16:59] known and then going on to
[1:17:03] Perfection not doing away with
[1:17:06] these but using these as a
[1:17:08] foundation because when the seals open
[1:17:11] none of this changed
[1:17:15] except except brother Ram had a deeper
[1:17:19] understanding of all those
[1:17:21] doctrines remember he preached why I
[1:17:24] against organized religion 1959 then he
[1:17:26] comes up on the first seal he says now I
[1:17:28] know he said I always knew I there was
[1:17:29] something about those denominations he
[1:17:31] said I know why
[1:17:33] now first or second third fourth seal by
[1:17:35] the time that fourth seal come he knew
[1:17:36] where Satan was he had an idea but he
[1:17:40] knew where Satan was he knew those four
[1:17:42] horse riders were the devil not God not
[1:17:45] the Holy Ghost but the the Devil Himself
[1:17:49] disguised as a writer r i d e r writer
[1:17:53] and and a writer w r
[1:17:57] are so brother
[1:17:59] brandham listened to him not too long
[1:18:01] ago he
[1:18:02] said thank God for the opening of these
[1:18:05] seals now he had preached 47 to 63 and
[1:18:09] seemed like he' preached
[1:18:11] everything where it was supposed to
[1:18:14] be but then he comes up and preaches a
[1:18:16] message and says thank God for the open
[1:18:19] of the seal is my prayer he said it many
[1:18:22] many times thank God that the seals are
[1:18:24] open
[1:18:25] why because it settled a lot of things
[1:18:27] in his in his even in his ministry it
[1:18:30] settled he knew listen the greatest
[1:18:33] thing he knew was brother John he knew
[1:18:35] God was breaking those seals cuz he
[1:18:38] couldn't do
[1:18:40] it he preached the seals a long time ago
[1:18:43] he preached Church ages a long time ago
[1:18:45] he preached him in one night he preached
[1:18:47] at the white horse
[1:18:49] rider was a mighty conqueror 1957 or 59
[1:18:53] he preached a mighty conqueror and rest
[1:18:54] Revelation 6
[1:18:59] verse1 but
[1:19:01] he understood right then I
[1:19:05] believe that that was it there was no
[1:19:07] more there was no more that was already
[1:19:10] settled all these great doctrines was
[1:19:11] settled but there was something new
[1:19:14] coming that book was going to be
[1:19:16] open and thank God I say for the opening
[1:19:21] of the
[1:19:22] book Thank God for the opening of the
[1:19:24] book in the end end time so that we can
[1:19:25] delve in dive in and you know what we
[1:19:29] can dive in with
[1:19:32] confidence I have confidence this
[1:19:34] message is
[1:19:36] right I have confidence that God has a
[1:19:40] people that will live this message that
[1:19:42] is right on the Earth today there's a
[1:19:46] group of people that will live this
[1:19:48] message out to the very end not go down
[1:19:52] not going in defeat we're going out of
[1:19:56] here so there's your restored
[1:20:01] Doctrine he had to restore that Doctrine
[1:20:04] he had to restore us back to the faith
[1:20:05] of the
[1:20:06] fathers so that we could understand and
[1:20:09] then use that for a platform to when he
[1:20:11] opened the seals it didn't he didn't say
[1:20:15] I see a different book he said that book
[1:20:18] I'm looking at is a brand new book he
[1:20:21] didn't say he got another one what was
[1:20:23] in this one was finally open and he
[1:20:25] could see what the Love
[1:20:28] Letter
[1:20:31] 100%
[1:20:33] meant because the son of man was
[1:20:37] 100%
[1:20:39] correct and if that Ministry is supposed
[1:20:41] to be back here somebody's going to be
[1:20:44] 100%
[1:20:45] correct do you believe that let's sing a
[1:20:48] song God bless
[1:20:50] you oh I am blessed

[1:21:38] hours 6 hours and listen two the
[1:21:42] preachers the pre read that off those
[1:21:45] scoll that's how much they wanted to
[1:21:48] hear from the word of God and his is
[1:21:51] that the desire in our heart
[1:21:54] to get to this world more than anything
[1:21:57] Set Me
