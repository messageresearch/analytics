$106,000 that they took up for the for the uh missionary uh people things and and you know it would help it wouldn't enough cuz they had a couple $1,000 request but you know still it's enough to to take what we could and do what we could you know in the church we always do and we always tell you when to come back where you won be wondered we always put in at least $3,000 offering into that from the church okay so everybody would know that you know and we do that and they I know they certainly appreciate it amen we're glad to have brother Quinn with us he'll be ministering for us today and

it coming up this morning or the other day I probably wouldn't be where I was at if my wife hadn't wanted to go to church so when we got married she wanted to go to church cuz you see I wasn't a Christian of any form back then and I just you know she wanted to go to church so we went to church and I thank God for that so the family's built on that part of going to church there's never been a question of whether to go to church or not or what to do it's always been settled and finished so we we thank God for that amen and I appreciate my wife I want to give her a hand for putting up with me for 58 years and it's not been fun I'll agree but that's all right okay we're glad to have brother Quinn with us any other announcements we gener miss something but I hope we got all of that part

again brother wied all of you amen and uh to Fellowship again around the precious word of God and we certainly we certainly expect God to speak to us this morning that's why we've come here amen and we really expect him to speak for us praise the Lord the Lord we've uh since we last left you we did go back over to India amen and and it's wonderful it's always a wonderful time in India that we have amen and uh to see the the the briad go on because you know we're really not back it's like I was thinking this morning like a little legal you know and the little legal getting tossed out of the nest and learning to fly well we far beyond that today amen we're not getting tossed her the nest I mean we're up there we're on the Rock today amen so uh it's it's wonderful to see the bride all over the world growing and coming in the full stature amen uh because it means that we're we're getting closer amen and uh you know yourself and what's going on in the world and watch Israel and things are kind of quiet over there at the moment you know but but Russia like they the Russians are into Syria they've got their big base they're right on the border of of of Israel that's where they are and so uh it doesn't matter uh worry us or anything like that nothing worries us today and uh uh when we were over in uh uh at Easter time when we always celebrate uh our morning service you know the uh uh Dawn Service uh my people love that and uh we were just saying to them you know that uh even death does not scare the Seed of Abraham death does not scare the Seed of Abraham because we know death has lost its thing amen see so it's it's wonderful praise the Lord and uh we were also over in uh with brother Nester this week uh brother is a good man amen and I love brother Nester and I love the brothers over there and uh praise God uh we could show you even on my tablet today if you wanted to see it uh when we were in non pan with him in in Cambodia I haven't been in Cambodia for about 10 years but he said would you come down and help me and I said I will so we both went down and uh there's no no big eye and small you with Brother Nester we're just workers together and I tell you what he took us out about two hours of non pan and we came to this little house and he said to me I don't think anybody will be here but the pastor but all the people that could come had all walked in the hot sun just like that there how would you fancy a two-hour walk in that Sun out there and they do it they had all you could see them all with their covers on to keep keep cool and there they were uh ready to hear the word so we we preached amen a preacher will preach not right with and uh we had a lovely time and right outside where the house was and funny enough they have stilts the house is built on stills and you might think why that cuz if you're standing underneath that it causes a a draft and you can feel a nice cool wind hitting you there you know and right beside the house uh we took the photograph of it is where uh the church was going to be built and brother and Ester was signing the official papers for the government and whatever not the next day and uh we left them some Finance to try and get the place all tidied up and leveled up and uh now we can show you on the tablet uh that lovely church that's there amen and it still needs to be finished off and I'm sure God will provide that need amen but to see them in it it's just it's just wonderful amen and I can show you both things and in in in the time we were there so we had a lovely time there lovely time with the brothers in LA and um amen they're coming on well they're beginning to get books printed and there's things happening you know we see we take things for granted folks amen you know what I mean like you know I mean nobody could take your car if you didn't have a car what would you do you know amen and I'll tell you what but you see we take things for all of us and these folks don't have these things and what we've had for years and years you know they don't have it and now they're just getting books in their own language what a wonderful thing to read the message in your own language so we had a wonder wonder wonderful time there you know and uh we went over to the Philippines again and uh it's wonderful to see what God's doing in the Philippines he's moving among the people and um and we really love them people over in the Philippines praise the Lord so uh we went down to uh Indonesia as well and one of the things I always do amen um praise the Lord is to help the pastors that's always been a little thing uh you know you can't everybody can't print books everybody can't build churches but you can do something and what I always like to do is I always like to make sure people are fed I was I don't I don't like to see hungry people you know John Wesley was the same he said I feed them first and preach to them you know it's good idea good amen and so praise the Lord uh you know when we went down into Indonesia again the in somatra uh there's a big lake and it's all to do with their volcanoes and all you know so uh around that Lake there's a good number of little small churches they're quite far apart but um I was out in the lake on one of their boats and it was great and uh they all came together and it was great I would say there would been more uh there that day than and is here but there was a number of churches you see and we had a wonderful day we had a wonderful time and a wonderful time up in midan and they're going to have a h an awesome meeting this year when the Asian people be coming from all over uh that part of the world enter midan in Indonesia in November they brother and es said we're praying that you'll come I said well I hope to be in India he said well we'll pray that you'll come so I said okay we'll see we'll see who wins the the prayer prayer battle amen well it's wonderful to be here and you know we give time to the precious word of God hallelujah certainly we have enjoyed our visit here so far and the camp meetings it does more than one thing you know you can help the people that's a wonderful offering and it's still I I went back very disappointed last year I thought Joe had said 47,000 and uh it was 67,000 and I was a bit disappointed but there again with the hardness and of times and and you know uh the economy and all and I said to brother Joe I said brother Joe I said God will give you what he wants you to have and that's always been my policy when I go away I I'm not going to say now Lord if you give me this amount I'll go I no when I'm ready to go whatever the Lord has put on my hands that's what I'm going to use and so praise the Lord uh then it it multiplied within two days you know went up there about wo 169,000 last year so that's and they've spent it all we spent it all all on the work of God and we are uh coming to a time now when uh it's all starting to fill up you know it's all starting to come to a head we know that we can see it cleanly cleanly and so praise the Lord um for that there but I love to hear the brothers from the other countries and bringing in uh brother uh Danny delondo preached the other morning not just to take him out but he was saying at the closest you'll come to God this morning is right from this puet right you know so like I mean there's something really really something there and uh we we've enjoyed all the preaching uh brother uh Ronald uh Spencer from from Virginia he preached on Thursday night and he just come down from uh from Canada and I'll just say this I'll just take this moment to say this and uh my every time he turned around the devil had a a road work in front of him you know I mean he couldn't even get down they put him over to New York and to put him up overnight which he didn't want he wanted to get home and get prepared for the and he didn't want that and then they flew him down to Atlanta then he was asking on the email please play it or make my connection and I know what that's all about you know I I know what that's all about and uh you just could see the devil trying to hinder you know and and I I brother I'll tell you brother Samuel I knew uh on Thursday night this boy's going to come with sword drawn and I'll tell you I'll tell you what he came with sword drawn folks and he preached a message he said gats of hell stand back amen praise the Lord see they will not the Gates of Hell will not Prevail amen and uh and it was wonderful and I'll tell you how wonderful it was I was numb for a whole hour after that meeting that's how wonderful it was amen and you know if if if if if I may just uh actually bring us up to this morning because we need to get into this morning actually last year at the camp service and the the boy said to me this year that he had it in his mind to have a you know everybody come out or whatever whoever wanted to come out on the Thursday night but God changed that and I love that I love a servant of God who's sensitive enough to know what the Holy Spirit wants to do amen and he did the same thing he just handed it over to the Lord you couldn't do any better than that I remember when we did it in Africa and the brother said to me afterward you did exactly the right thing he said Lord I don't know what to do now I said I'm giving it back to you well he knew what to do praise the Lord I tell you he certainly did and uh amen so last year we went uh they were called out to the front and I went out to that front and folks I'm not joking you I don't know where I was amen but I was somewhere that I wanted this message this morning that's where I was where I wanted this message this morning and I'm going to preach to you now and this is not a sermon this is not a sermon this is the Cry of the heart amen so let's go to the word of God Amen praise the Lord and we will go to the book of Hebrews I think you're going to see it there amen and we we'll read right away said God who at sunry times and in different manners speak in time past unto the fathers by the prophets he surely has hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son hear ye him whom Heath appointed heir of all things all things everything Hallelujah all power by whom also he made the world's how did he make the world's Church by his son Hallelujah n who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high Hallelujah being made also better than the angels as he ha by an inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they For unto which of the angel said he at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of God worship him which they did when he was born Hallelujah they they rejoiced in the heavens and came down and said in the city of Bethlehem amen today a savior which is Christ the lord amen and again when he bringeth yes and the angels He said who maketh his Angel spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but unto the son he saith thy Throne oh God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou H has loved righteousness and hid it iniquity therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy fellows amen and you can read on right down to the end but time is passing on Amen and so we want to carry on and while you're standing if if if you may uh I think we I've got the Book of Genesis here so would you turn to it just a moment Genesis chapter 1 and we could actually quote it verbum amen but in Genesis chapter 1 we'll just read the scriptures and it says and God said let us make man and our image after our likeness are you glad Hallelujah let them have dominion over all the fish of the sea that's the human form amen and let the fil of the air and over all the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his IM own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and just one last scripture if you may please uh just come with me to the Book of John the Gospel of John amen amen praise the Lord and we want to go to the high Priestly prayer amen praise the Lord the high Priestly prayer and I'm just getting it on my tablet now amen and praise the Lord uh we'll read from verse 20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they may also be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou givest me I have given them that they may be one as we are one glory amen i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one so that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me glory amen father I will also I'm just putting this in I will also that they also whom thou H has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world let us stand gracious Heavenly Father Eternal God lord we just thank you for these precious words we've read from your holy book this morning and Lord we just ask now that you come on the scene again Lord we're here on this Sunday morning to honor the resurrection of our precious Lord Jesus Christ and we ask Lord that you will anoint your word to every hearer this morning meet every need Lord may we all go home and bless people today and we ask it Lord bringing glory to you alone in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated and God bless you this morning praise the Lord amen praise the Lord um we had a I'm just going to start off with us amen we had a a I was over in Scotland there uh in June and uh praise the Lord uh there's a young man I know there he's not a preacher or anything like got but he's a lovely boy amen he's about 40 and uh he uh gets comes everywhere I remember the first time I went to Switzerland I went with him amen and so he was over uh up in Jeffersonville and he's talking to different ones and that then he went down to uh brother Charlie Cox down in Kentucky and when he was down there amen uh he was talking to Charlie Charlie was a we bit you know nervous you know stand offish and but anyway Chris is a very easy going fell so Charlie kind of eased up a bit you know and uh uh so they they went down to see where the uh cabin had been where brother Branham lived and he was surprised it's way off the road you know and then when they come home that night they were just sitting having fellowship and brother Charlie made a comment that I as far as I know you it's not a public comment amen maybe he said on his tips but I don't know I don't get his tips but you know he said something to brother Chris that really struck out very very very much he said you know when brother Bram created them squirrels he said said that night or the the next night whatever it was when they at them amen he said that is the first time in my life I ever saw a squirrel without a belly button I think about that amen now you you going to get you're not you're not going to get this in the New York poster or you know what I mean the Washington whatever post whatever they call it you're a going to get it but we've got it folks say Amen the first time because it was a spoken word squirrel hallelujah how could it have a belly button amen that's right and he said that and that was just a comment so what I want to say is this is the god that we worship this morning an awesome God now my my daughter says you're being Americanized she they' Americanized you you're awesome this awesome that you know but it is awesome hallelujah praise God we got a wonderful message Hallelujah it doesn't stop when you see amen the things that God did through that Prophet Hallelujah to put us on the right straight track Hallelujah and that's where it's going to take us because it'll take us somewhere amen and so we do serve a wonderful Creator this morning sir amen and uh this morning I want to speak praise the Lord on Oneness that's the title of the message I don't know if it comes up here or not I don't know but amen Oneness that's what that's what I want that that night when I stood in the presence of almighty God in the throne room that is what I wanted amen that was my heart's cry that I would be one with God hallelujah one with God Amen and that's what I want to speak about this morning uh uh Oneness of God and his people just Oneness Hallelujah one with God and uh you know it's a deep desire it's a deep desire now the thing is this morning if you had a questionnaire and you were asked in this life we're all human beings amen you get up in the morning you have to eat your breakfast you know you go to work you do whatever you have to do we're all human beings but if I ask you really what is your heart desire that's that's the question what is your heart desire what is your goal in life right because I was listening that we were at the at the uh uh cracker barl yesterday and you know they got this kind of uh division and on the other side this guy was talking about business and he was talking about hard we're going to get the business you do this you do that this will do and you know on big business and I thought that's that's that's that's their goal Hallelujah get the business up make multi-millionaires here to themselves and well that'll be their goal if they have changed that that's up to them amen but that's not my goal Hallelujah my goal is not to become a millionaire I don't want to be a millionaire I wouldn't know what to do with a million dollars folks I have to give it away or do something Hallelujah but you see there's a desire in your heart and that's why you're here this morning brother Gary that you can't you can't even maybe explain it Hallelujah but it is there Hallelujah it is there and what is your goal you know some people might say well to get to heaven that would be nice to be in the Rapture that would be nice amen that would even be the wrong goal because your goal must be God himself and I'm going to try and explain it to you explain it to you as best as best I can amen it must be God himself amen now that would be the correct goal praise the Lord uh we know we know there's no question even the the most humble person here this morning would know that we're born with a thirst we're born with a thirst brother Len for God we can't explain it but we're born with that thirst all over the world the natives and you know uh are born without thirst they want to worship something sometimes they don't know but you can come and show them the true way to show them the true worship that's what Jesus said to the woman that God wants those who will worship Him in spirit and in truth that's what he desires so there's a that that hunger that thirst amen for God even as a child we were talking about it yesterday and I just didn't say anything at all but amen as a child you know there was something there you may be playing out there with the other children and you just feel something around you and you what and then you just carry on plane you didn't even know what it was Hallelujah something just there with you there was always it was always there amen and there was a deep calling onto a deep Hallelujah I said to brother Samuel this morning it was good that sister Peggy I wanteded to go to church praise the Lord but God would have got him some way Hallelujah uh you're you're a Son of God Amen you didn't become a Son of God the day you got saved Hallelujah you were a Son of God way back in the thinking of God before the foundation of the world he's going to get you somewhere amen under that token Hallelujah and so there's that thirst that hunger we couldn't even explain it couldn't even explain it Hallelujah even his children amen and you know a deep calling onto a deep we didn't even know what's happening Hallelujah but God was working on us hallelujah cuz he had plans the plans that I believe the brother read it Isaiah 55 today but there again and and Isaiah the plans I have for you are good their plans that are good plans Hallelujah and and so it's wonderful and and that deep amen like the little boy eating the the the the the the are suck in the pedal when it used to be made of rubber don't know what they're made of today I could H you but anyway you know now what was it what science could explain that to that little boy right see you know he didn't go to the doctor and say oh I know what's wrong with you son go and start licking the pedal of your basic go that'll swort you out you think oh that's a quack doctor you know but you see that little boy there was something in him he couldn't explain it the doctor couldn't explain it but then when they found out that he was lacking in that vitamin D or whatever it was that's what was in the Rubber and that's what his little body was so that's how the circle works that's how it works hallelujah amen and it's wonderful praise the Lord and uh so it had to be there you've got to need this morning it has to be met you desire to go to that City there has to be a city to go to it has to be that way there's a deep calling onto a deep and it doesn't matter what the President says or doesn't say we're past that Hallelujah you know I'm sorry just to use this this expression but if I was in a restaurant and and maybe Michael Jordan I think it's basketball that to tell me anyway is basketball I great you know if he comes in and says do you know who I am well I wouldn't know who he is and Not only would I not know who he is I wouldn't care less who he is you see do you know who who I am I'd say to him do you know who I am hallelujah amen so and that's only an illustration there plenty of other illustrations there you know but that that deep calling on to a deep amen now and the thing is folks that man actually wants Oneness with God he really does Hallelujah with his creator with his maker it's deep in the psychic of man that's his desire and it certainly is and that's why they when they talk about uh you know making man God but you see it's still if you boil it down it's the same idea

verse Lord Jesus amen We Appreciate You amen GL we love you we adore you and we bow down before you amen so praise the lord we sing it in that three-fold way amen amen the Lord is our Helper and my friend and we'll talk about that later now so the word Oneness means to be one with amen United in Union with praise God and now he said brother Brown said this is quite a subject Hallelujah and uh you can get it in your computer amen the uniting time and sign has brought Oneness with almighty God Amen it certainly has that's what the the message has done we've all heard the voice we had a near to hear what God was saying to his church because we were predestinated to hear it amen and uh we're not go into that because I'd be I'd be away so praise the Lord amen the uniting time and sign brought Oneness with almighty God the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ with the bridegroom and that's what we love today and that's what we where we are why you say well what are you married to we're married to this word hallelujah we are one with this word praise God Amen and that is wonderful now let me just go on because he said be one as I and the father are one yeah be that kind of one amen that kind of one then how will that be the word in us would be the anointed word amen hallelujah amen and you see everybody we know it everybody's got their anointing praise the Lord everybody's got their anointing but we've got this anointing in us hallelujah that we are one with God because his word is in us and that's what the scripture says that's what the prophet's telling us we know it to be true and it's an anointing word am that's the key hallelujah we're not wling about there in some Lutheran church this morning as dead as a door Neil Hallelujah we are one with the word the anointed word is in us this morning amen he said this is Oneness with God see the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you see and when you become a son a messiah a messiah of the age Imagine amen you're gods and who the who the word of God came to we I'm mat your Gods folks Hallelujah we knew who we are praise God Amen yeah Hallelujah and so of the age the anointed in our age every one of us could tell us yes brother Bram preach the the false anointed ones at the end time which is perfectly correct it's a real anointing brother you know it but Samuel hallelujah amen The Vessel themselves is not right amen but it's like the rain that falls on everybody praise God if you're in the meeting it'll fall on you that don't mean nothing Hallelujah it don't mean nothing amen see but we're talking about not the false anointed ones but we're talking about the true anointed ones that has the word of God in them amen amen see because Judas sat sat through it we were talking about it yesterday he sat through all the messages saw all the Miracles and actually did them himself when they went he of the sick cast out devils and and no doubt old Judas was going bubbling too oh wonderful Wonder you know but he couldn't come to the Holy Ghost he couldn't receive that new birth he couldn't receive it because he was a son of predition yes sir okay I might get a little quote on that praise the Lord amen so that's what we are today that word anointed in us the allotted word for our age that's the most important where we see ourselves like like Samuel was saying uh Revelation is our book Hallelujah they're telling me that the Catholics are trying their next Edition they're trying to get the Book of Revelation out they don't like it probably they see themselves there in Revelation 17 that's probably why they don't like it amen praise God so amen and and and so hallelujah what kind of Oneness no the elot word for our age the age of the Overcomer right my when I look at people this morning to see that you are an overcomer that's what you were born for you were born to overcome Hallelujah you don't have to worry about nothing that's the way you were born and when you received that word God has been anointed that word in you ever since Hallelujah and you're a messiah of the age you might realize it like my sister she might realize she the strength put you heart to get the 80 years of age Hallelujah and so what kind of Oneness amen the bright age that's the anointed word in us today this morning and I'm not a b ashamed of that and I'll tell you one thing either I'm not a b ashamed of brother Bram hallelujah praise God to give them the place where God placed them as a prophet of our day when we were up talking to the the brothers in uh in Laos and I got my turn and I just felt to say to them why did God have to send Elijah what does it mean and we went right through a whole series like that with him to show why God had to send allei because he said he would destroy the world if if if allei didn't come but Elijah did come and he came to restore that's what he came to do and that's what he did right amen amen well if the Baptists don't agree with it then they haven't got the same anointing as I have right amen right hallelujah amen so and thinking about that uh we are not we are not uh talking about the oness denomination brother Bram says that's not the kind of Oneness I mean see Jesus only Jesus only that's all there is Jesus only well that's not all there is Amen in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily Hallelujah amen and when they baptize in the singular of Jesus name only Jesus a baptizing name of Jesus there is far away from it as Father Son and Holy Ghost sir amen and why will people I can't understand it myself why Cann not people read plain English amen hallelujah and do something say we've got the Revelation amen I was Pastor a church there couple of days back and it said that you know repent be baptized and you'll be saved and I said my my I bet you if I went in there you'd be talking to me about at Trinity next week okay Hallelujah you know baptismal regeneration folks I told you last time I was here I'd been in a Turkish bath 34 degrees hot I was hot and not father wanted to be baptized we baptized him in a Turkish bath but I'll tell you I've been in places where I come out where I thought my legs were never going to get the heat in them again they were that cold amen I've been a nice streams you know I've been over in India I've been in places where I could feel something sealed by my leg don't know what it was never asked that's the best thing to do one night I was getting into one one one day I was getting into you know they talk about a well in India but what they mean is maybe 40t wide you know and a way maybe 20 ft deep uh that's what they call a well then they've got the pump and it pumps up to the village and whatever not but uh you know I was getting all already for the baptism and there's a commotion and I said what's going on and they said oh we just got a snake here but it's all right we're I you just got to snake you know and here I'm I'm getting under the water and I'm not joking I'm waiting for another snake to bite me you know said well Lord here I am it's going to happen it's going to happen oh my and you see it's not the water it's not a bapt in clean water a baptized in dirty water cuz that's all we had water will not regenerate you but we are regenerated by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit alone okay I will be in you even to the End of the Age amen one body Inseparable I go with you I'll be you'll be part of me you'll be my bride my life will be in your body my life you know I'm looking at a whole lot of people here this morning where Christ's life is in your body today Hallelujah that's wonderful amen praise the Lord and when that is the case one in will one in mind one in heart amen that's what we're going to have that his will will be our will actually I preached a series on three on the will of God and one of them messages I was telling the people actually you are the will of God you are amen every person's born I I've got a little on my tablet here if any of you would like to see it it's where I was in India and the Pastor said I'd like you to dedicate a little baby and it was a little baby girl and of course I had to give it a name so you could see it all there H just in case you don't believe it when I tell you but it is real Hallelujah and H it's wonderful amen uh that this is where we are and if you'd like to say that there's wonderful things in that but one in will see I said about that little baby girl this little baby girl has been born according to the will of God right cuz that's what the prophet of God said Hallelujah okay amen and one like a husband and wife is one person you and I are going to be one at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you and you in me a new creature in Christ and Christ in us the hope of glory he said I love that Satan just get so angry at that well let him get angry Hallelujah I don't care amen ain't going to do me any harm why you see brother George you you've got the pillar fire around you and in you you'll not have to worry if the devil's mod or not let him be mod Hallelujah you'll defeat him any time anywhere any place Hallelujah I told you that's what the young fell did the other night 55 I said you watch he's going to pull out the sword tonight amen and he said kids of Hell yield Hallelujah and they did yield that's all I can say praise the Lord amen now sit angry see it's Oneness of God all that God was he poured into Christ that was his intention an invisible God and he takes that form in the logos amen and he pours it all into Christ everything he is hallelujah and all that Christ is he's poured into you and I amen and that's a lot that's a lot you know what I mean that's like saying uh you know somebody's left you an inheritance of a couple of million dollars and you don't know it I tell you what you'd regret that at the end of your life said I had all that and I didn't know it well that's the the same as of the Lord everything that he's got there's nothing folks that I can say this morning that you haven't got inside you today nothing hallelujah praise the lord and there you are see it makes them one that what Christ has poured in to us now you can see it behind me this is where we're coming up to in this pyramid Hallelujah that amen the the partakers of the divine nature amen right one with God in his nature his character and his person right completely not just a we bit here and there completely amen one with him oh my and see the virtues the faith you know what is it you know brother B said Rapture and faith is laying in the messages that's where it's lying and we're building right up the virtue the life Hallelujah the the amen the quickening power uh that that that's there and it's taking us somewhere we're certainly claiming that pimit that latter we certainly are amen and then the stature of a perfect mind new wine and new wine skins amen and the husband and wife being one Christ and his bride are one now I want to show you something here when you talk about the stature of a perfect man I at back home praise the Lord that we were thinking about the seed on the path or the trail of The Serpent and that's why thing a lot of people will emphasize that they'll emphasize the trail of The Serpent and you can follow it you can follow it you can follow it through Kean right on down H amen and uh right in the Nimrod my B you can H right through the flood you can brother Samuel tell you and probably preach it to you you can follow it the whole way through Ahab right into Judas right into Alexander the coer Smith done me much harm why is that in the Bible amen why did he have to tell us that you see cuz he let you know see the serpent seats here right beside me exactly that's what he's telling you amen and you can follow it right through the seven Church ages all through the seven Church ages there's only had been two seeds I listened to it yesterday in the record amen see the seed of the serpent that came down by K nourished by doctrines and Creeds but what about the seed of the woman and you can come right through to see that seed of the serpent as a thought then that that Bishop comes over from Babylon right into what thara whatever whatever it was and you know the Catholic church has it it was born in Babylon I tell you one thing folks if you could have heard a message by Nimrod and heard a message by by the present Pope you wouldn't know the difference they're preaching a bloodless religion oh my that's what they're preaching there's no blood religion in the Catholic church it's a bloodless sacrifice well you how do you do that uhuh how do you do that okay so and then when you go right on through the right up to to the end it becomes what the Beast then the Antichrist that's that group but what about the seed of the woman hallelujah what about that seed amen that came through Seth amen then came through Enoch Hallelujah who walked with God and was not because God took him amen then Noah himself following on the seed of God Amen coming right through and ham sham and jao and then right in to Seth and right on through amen and to Abraham Hallelujah see you can talk about the seed of the woman the seed of the serpent but here's the seed of the woman coming right through and he tried to destroy it so many times but he cannot see you can stand up this morning or this evening or anytime you want to and you can quote to the devil hurt not the oil or the wine he cannot do it you can challenge him anytime you want he cannot hurt the oil or he cannot hurt the wine the Revelation on the Holy Ghost cannot hurt it amen and you can come right on through praise the Lord King David King Solomon right on down through until the day that maray brought that little child and give it in the hands of Simeon and Simeon could have said as easy as he could have said anything behold the seed of the woman and he shall bruise that Serpent's head Hallelujah HJ praise God I think they would find it hard sitting through a meeting like this you know demon Spirits at least they wouldn't be very comfortable amen I put it that way okay and I'm glad I don't want them here anyway praise God so and we're talking about this the stature of a perfect man coming right up Amen to that headstone and praise the Lord the same works the same signs everything The Works that I do shall you do also now the divine nature we were talking about that this divine nature would be in you and you know I came on a little poem and I'm sorry but I came on this little poem and I put it in into my notes and I want to couple it up with with Philippines and just a while I read that book of Philippines let this mind be in you the amorph of God taking the form of a servant but he never left his divine nature behind though he was a servant the deity never left him you know that Hallelujah when he was placed as a son there on that mountain Hallelujah that adoption amen this is my son I am in him Hallelujah I'm pleased to Dell now the human the divine nature and the reason I'm saying this is because this is what we want am this is what we want Hallelujah see this is the poem who had weekness without weakness everybody thinks alarm is weak but alarm is not weak right but its nature is weekness right right and that's what I want folks I don't want just be a part of it I want it all to be in its fullness the way it was in Jesus Christ Hallelujah weekness without weakness tenderness without feebleness amen you know you see a feeble person that's that's not what we're talking about we're talking about that tender heart that heart that knows that you're human right amen that knows that you're human right that's the one that reaches down to you praise God and you know I put in another little one myself gentleness without hardness you can be a gentle and you should be a gentle person without hardness you say well

reasoning he said okay if you've got no sin you throw the first stone and from the oldest to the youngest they left and he bent down to right as I say you'd love to know what he wrote wouldn't you he may just have wrot circles I don't know what he wrote but he made have wrote that man's name right cuz he was a phy you can believe it he they were caught in the act so he was let go but she was going

himself and that's what I want to be everything that I've read down and you can take the boxes to see where you were at this morning amen you can take the boxes amen praise the Lord okay I've got about another couple of minutes left anyway praise the Lord and you know two pages out n's not bad praise God M you know I tell you what and I might say this and and I mean it with all my heart that one of the sisters said to me brother George you know you could preach without notes somebody came and preached without notes you know and I said yeah what did they say without notes what did they say well they said praise the Lord yeah praise the Lord and they said Hallelujah Glory the Breads and you know Hallelujah I heard that I heard that yeah what else did they say well well we really don't really know what it said and that's why we use notes because it lays it word for word bed by bed lays it out for you that's why I use them amen do you think I couldn't preach here for an hour without notes but if I asked you going home tonight now what was the thrust what I said today you'd probably say well I don't know that's why say so praise the Lord amen that they may be one yes as we are one as the father art in me and I in thee amen remember he is the high priest of our confession the true and the faithful witness that is one of his titles amen now when we were talking about the stature of a perfect man godliness godliness is one of them Hallelujah and godliness brother Bram said means to be God yeah right and I want to be Godly I want sister TR I want just to be like God that's what I want to be you say a little bit like him no everything am everything it is he's poured into me and I want that I want that manifested in its fullness of its power hallelujah what is it to be like God that we made attain that we made attain the stature of a perfect mind Hallelujah and the stature of a perfect mind Christ the very image of God Amen that's what it all boils down going to Hallelujah that's what we with what he is we attend to that amen praise God wonderful in harmony with God and with each other and when Jesus prayed that high Priestly prayer that they would be one nothing less for us than absolute Oneness with him amen nothing less as he is one with the father What He Is We Are what he thinks we think the same thing am what he does we do Hallelujah folks I tell you I see it in my Ministry amen you say to me well brother George how many people did you pray for I don't know maybe hundreds of people and when I come home I don't even know what's happened and then maybe I'll hear Larn over the email or something that that there was a woman that had TB and she went back and she got the x-rays after prayer and and it's all clear that's all I know was it me did it How would how could it be me I can't even remember praying for it's it's much beyond that folks hallelujah it's Christ in us hallelujah doing the works as he said it's the father and me doing the works the things that please the father that's really the Oneness the things that please the father Amen to be United to him and in this prayer of Jesus our high priest it has to be answered because he pray it that's right so it will be answered you look at yourself and you say well brother brother quen you don't know me I tell you but he knows you and he said you'll be one with me amen as I am one with the father hallelujah it's wonderful amen praise the Lord and you know that's the godhead and I'm not I'm not going to go into the godhead we we certainly don't believe in no Trinity amen but what I would like just to say in the closing up of of the message amen that in the book of Philippines amen where we read amen that I and the father are one praise the Lord and here he was he took the form of a servant he could do that Hallelujah he humbled himself even to the death of the Cross wherefore God has highly exalted him that at his name every knee shall bow everyone and glory and Heaven and Earth amen and as I said nothing in that passage teaches the Eternal Word emptied himself of his divine nature or his attributes cuz he proved that he proved who he was Hallelujah you know if it had have been 10,000 people at that Seaside that day he would have fed them everyone right would it been anything to him and that's what people say that they always talk about the historical Jesus the hisorical Jesus you know that was the word made and flesh standing there and he could do it Hallelujah cook food don't matter it wouldn't matter Hallelujah he could do it cuz he was the word made flesh well what about us on hallelujah what about us amen praise God we've got this word anointed in us to be one with him Hallelujah folks we're just stripping at it at a minute but he said it will come into its full power it will come in hallelujah it's coming to this bride amen well you know class participation how would you like a little bit of class participation before we close up that's a good thing isn't it Hallelujah you're brother Bram in this message when he was preaching the spirit that you've got agrees with the word and that's never going to change you cannot change truth truth is always going to be truth hallelujah and the spirit the holy spirit is always going to amim in the word he believes it and he's in us and we believe it praise God we've got no problem with that at all none whatsoever Hallelujah and then praise the Lord he says and that manifests the word and makes the word power to act the same way as he did now here it is so brother Bram says let's say it together okay so we're going to say it together and I'm going to say Oneness and you say Oneness come on Oneness okay Oneness with god with God God is to have is to have God's spirit God's spirit and you and you agreeing agree with the word with the word all the word all the word the whole world the whole world and to make it and to make manifest it in power that's class participation I love that that's what we are the spirit and us hallelujah amen and that mieses one you know when you look at that there you can see godliness there and godliness is a a commodity that you don't find right right you don't find very very rare to see godly people but yet of all every time I go no matter where I go brother sister in the world I see godly people in this bride they're Godly the things of this world aren't their aren't their absolute this is their absolute there's a cry in their heart to be one with God to be like Jesus amen to be like God everything that he is hallelujah amen that we that godliness pleases the father and if I hadn't run out of time I I could have talked about Adam and Eve how they please God in that Garden amen a beautiful type you know of

estation hallelujah amen and praise the Lord uh you can I can spend time on that there you know the perfect one Perfect Harmony perfect Oneness and we know how sin broke that up Hallelujah and how he could speak lip to ear with Adam oh my amen do you know I'll tell you something last night we were talking just talking and I never said this to these people but I could see that lovely milky Cloud over us brother yeah I could see it that's the truth if you believe me you'll believe me if you don't you don't don't matter I can see it there's just maybe five of us or four of us whatever it was

with his family hallelujah amen Oneness with our creator it's the only gr of Fellowship Hallelujah to be United with him forever amen and I could read so many quotes here but just I want to finish up of a May the dispensation of the age of the Holy Spirit that's why we read in Hebrews this morning and I just want to read this of a May if you just give me two more moments he said he PID a debt of sin now in order to get Oneness between God and man Jesus could not do it as long as he was here in a body of Flesh so he had to become the complete sin offering to take away the guilt of the believer so we ain't got no guilt is that right hallelujah amen amen we ain't got no guilt so praise the Lord and he says so that the Holy Ghost could come into mine and make mine and God oness again see there had to be something to reestablish see when we see this the penalty must be paid and know the highest form of animal life is a human being and the human being fail itself so how could one human save another it taking God and God is a spirit but could not die so God had to bring himself a little lower than the Angels Hebrews chapter 1 that's why we read it amen had to do it himself lower than the angels in order to take death to pay the penalty to bring the Oneness between God and my and I can tell you this morning folks I am one happy man I am one happy man this morning that God has done that and I've got it Hallelujah tell you what I love what brother Ronald you know you can you can understand he's a very he was supposed to come over actually but with his wife and his his father-in-law

table this is what I'm bringing to the table this morning hallelujah amen and it's God's only plan for believers to bring himself into true runess is to receive the Holy Ghost Amen period and you know
