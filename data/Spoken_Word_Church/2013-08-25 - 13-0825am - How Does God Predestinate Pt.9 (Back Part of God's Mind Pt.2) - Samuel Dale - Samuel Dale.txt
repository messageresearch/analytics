TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I won't receive D Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I'll you really mean that yes I want to see you shining in the light of your glory anymore after power and love ly you'll find shining in the light of your glory amen As we sing foreign amen and amen and amen I want to see you don't you good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you like turning your scriptures turn to Romans 8 where we've been reading you know I'm glad to have a visitor back there with us I don't think she's been here before but she has and still say welcome but we always say to you welcome just make yourself the home and we're to have nothing to join up with we're just part of the body of Christ so we say welcome to you amen you won't get a welcome on the next time if I can remember it my member is not that good but Romans 8. just remember that prayer request has been given in remember the little baby there the Martinez baby and we're still going to claim that everything's all right we're not going to accept it anything that they're saying is wrong with it that's what they're doing medically but we believe in the Healer the deliverer of the Savior the all in all and Jesus is his name amen just remember that remember Wade in June to be flying back tomorrow from Kansas pray to the Lord would bless him there today in the services amen any other announcements I generally forget most of the time anyway let's just pray father we thank you for this day and the hour that we have we thank you for your love and your grace unto us thank you for Calvary because that was where all things were made possible we pray that you would just bless and guide each one of us now as we talk about you as we read your word and meditate upon the thoughts Lord that you've given unto us that we can deliver our hearts to the people and we ask you to forgive our sins guide us by your grace and love and keep us bless each one remember the little baby is our Lord and just reach down and touch it and they they have to come back and say all of their tests were wrong because we believe you father and we we keep on praying and believing remember the sick among us because there's many here but you said you sent your word and healed us so as we lord speak about you you come on the scene to manifest yourself because that's the desire you've always wanted to be we love you and we thank you to have your way now and keep us in Jesus name amen Romans 8. 28-31 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose and whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover of whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified let me also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been studying for quite a while about how does God predestinate and we've been covering the the points and trying to get to it and uh you know moving on into our thoughts and all and I pray that that you will listen to what's being said and and you know pray about it and ask the Lord to reveal it because I believe we're in the last days I believe we're here at the fine the winding up of all things and I sure hope so because if not uh then I get to go by the grave because you know you get on up in age and you realize that hey I hope the Lord will hurry up and come quickly maybe maybe we need to see it that way at least because John when he got on Patmos he wasn't too old but when he got down to the end of it that's what he said he said even though come quickly Lord he's saying the end and seen that that was what it was and seen all of the things and he just said come quickly well that should be our thoughts and our minds but I said we've been talking about how does God predestinate he predestinates we read here in the scripture by his foreknowledge all right now for knowledge is knowledge before and I'll repeat this two or three times today the Lord willing but for knowledge is the fact of knowing something before it transfires all right but it means also that what is foreknown must one day transpire you know it must take place because he knew it he saw it all right so that's not cutting anything short everything that's in the word of God must be fulfilled you know and you know and he saw who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved by his foreknowledge in that way then he could predestinate you know he could set it or or say it because you remember how we've been doing it the prophet said what predestination looks back to foreknowledge all right then for knowledge looks to Destiny well that's simple isn't it that makes foreknowledge stronger or greater than predestination so we've all you know been in our lives studying of predestination and thinking that God just stamps this and he's going to save a certain amount of people and and and all of this that and the other and some people were just made into the world just to be lost and things well I don't believe it that way I I don't believe I believe by foreknowledge he knew who would be saved and who wouldn't so he could say Jacob have I loved and he saw how I hated even before they were ever born he said well he didn't give them a change no you're not listening foreknowledge means knowledge before did you understand that so then by knowledge before he knew what Jacob would do and what Esau would do so he didn't make them wrong he made them correct but he knew which way it would go by his foreknowledge all right then when they were born into the world they were just fulfilling his foreknowledge you say well it didn't give them a change no that's the thing that we we don't follow he all he gives everybody a change like even as I said our winds didn't have before that I really appreciate the prophets saying that even the people in in the Heathen in these countries that don't even hear the gospel but yet they'll be judged by their laws and tribes and things because there's no uh judgment can be made of them about Christianity well that's a wonderful God to me you know I I just don't leave anybody out was he then trying to get us to the foreknowledge part getting us to look back and quit trying to see if well if I was predetermined then I'll be there well that doesn't that's not even common sense unto us and that's why I love foreknowledge because foreknowledge then God looked down and seen that I would want to be saved but he looked down also and seen a lot of other people would not want to be saved well then he's just in his doings because he knew what our choice would be and we we sing that old song you know wait a little longer please Jesus do we get our families in or something well there's no such thing and they ain't even scriptural because if he's if he left us here another million years upon the Earth you know and you and I could live that million years without aging they'd never be another person saved that was not in the foreknowledge of God as to be saved see so then it's not Assumption of a haphazard thing that God is just doing this or that or the other and we're no but we are living out our predestination we are the ones who choose then when we look back we can see that he could go ahead and choose us because the Bible said we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world all right but remember many are chosen right right see many I mean many are called but a few are chosen all right so then we get it in the correct order to understand what life is about and what we're doing God never wished that anybody be lost he wouldn't everybody be saved amen but he knew who wouldn't who would not and see then that to me then is looking down and seeing us making our journey and seeing us choosing to be Christians when others will not choose to be that right and in that way we can see that he could put us then on a uh an equal basis now even with him you remember that Wednesday now we're not on equal bases trying to be a God right get that off your mind but when God gave us a choice that makes you unequal basis with God because if he overrides your choice he's up here you're down here right see but if he gives us a choice and making that choice equal it simply means that he's not going to override it he's not going to override your free moral agency he won't make you be saved I don't care what you've been taught you get in the word of God and let's talk about it we've been taught this that or the other you know things down through there but what does the Bible say those who we foreknew he did predestinate is that we just what we just got through Reading yes right then we take the Bible for it and and don't worry about the rest all right but now remember election looks back to foreknowledge for knowledge then looks on to the destiny of where you're going so it's all in God's foreknowledge then in his foreknowledge we've covered a lot of things that would be dealing with in his foreknowledge and then we can put it down to the basis of understanding where we're at and the day that we're living and knowing that as I said I'm going to repeat this because I want to keep it in your mind foreknowledge is knowledge of what will be all right and God having that before it would ever take place well see then that's not him making you choose as him knowing your choice all right now is everybody with me on that I don't want that thought even in your mind to think about what we used to believe about it well you know if I'm predestinated to be saved I will be and if not I won't you know well you know what you want that's the best way to say it because you hung up on the idea see if God making you do something all right then we'll go back in there and try to prove by the Bible or something they have by like Paul being struck down on the road to Damascus but remember Paul wasn't saved when he was struck down that was just his contact with God come on he wasn't saved until ananiasical to the Bible went over and baptized him and then he received the Holy Ghost because see that way we're not making it a stamped thing but we're also not making it it's just a haphazard well you know let's do the best I can and maybe the Lord will meet me somewhere and you know maybe he's good enough he might save me yeah the prophet of God said we don't even do our business like that you know we don't do it on that basis all right but follow with me now because that's where we we've got to the point now and I was trying to cover there Wednesday night how that there was a time that God dwelt Alone and when he dwelt alone there was nobody with him right now let's get out of our mind one thing for any thoughts whatsoever into our minds because you can go into Mormon doctrines and different doctrines that has come down and plenty of them in this message of trying to make us some kind of a something up in heaven you know making us some kind of a people little identities running around up in heaven well let's get that away from us that'll be the thought for the day is to get away from the fact of believing anything of you and I in our relationship of this world which is Body Spirit Soul living people Etc none of that was before the world that was what he for Saul come on the lives we're living He foresaw it doesn't put us back there which you see we want that idea because it makes some makes us I don't know I guess we're human beings and we we so want to uh be connected in life but why be connected in life with what I don't want to be connected in life once in life we better be connected with what's in God what's in life is a lost situation the best we could do but see we want so much to be something that's that's the ego of human human mankind or people just want to be something and we'll always want to be something greater than anybody else right I mean it's never that people wants to just be happy to be who they are yeah we want to be better than somebody else we want to be something greater well what good is all of that even if you have all that the Bible says it's it's foolishness don't you think the Rich Young Ruler would have been glad to have traded places with Lazarus right amen even to be raised and things he would have sure been gladly loved have been doing that you know well yet he was a good guy he was a good person but yet he was lost all right you see God knew that and he knew whatever he would do with that Rich Young Ruler he talked to him he he communicated with him he offered him salvation but he knew where to hit him at his ego what was his ego money riches what's the ego of mankind to be better than somebody else greater than somebody else richer than somebody else well what if you have it all and lose your soul what good is it that's right and we're not going to go out and burn our money we're not dumb maybe a little bit not a whole lot we're going to live and do the best we can while we're here in life and there's nothing wrong with riches the Bible doesn't say money is the root of all evil does not say that says the Love of Money it's when you let the money override your your life and that's all you got in your mind is money don't worry about it a local he's going to get it pretty quick anyway he's doing all right now taking most of it and but he ain't getting the gas company is getting but think about it now we've been dealing with a a point on predestination that I wanted you to follow me and and let me restate it if you don't get nothing today out of the message all right get this one point I don't believe and never talked don't believe the Bible does I don't believe the prophet does that we were some kind of a people up in heaven somewhere and we're going to get to a point to see the eternal life that we have always was eternal all right now that eternal life that we have now by the new birth was a part of God right all right then that is eternal but you and I as Body Spirit Soul people were lost we have to be born again and even in a born-again experience the new birth is the only the birth of the Soul it's not the body and the spirit you're not born again in those and even if you are anointed on your spirit to do great wonders what are you accomplished confused was a high priest wouldn't he typhus prophesied it was better for one to die for the sins of the people than for a whole nation to die you might have thought that was just him talking but he wouldn't he was under the anointing because that anointing could come on him and you can have that anointing on you every day of your life and die and go to hell and love God the whole time amen amen but what's the main thing it's whether or not that Spirit In You agrees with this word if it don't agree with this word it's not the Holy Spirit if it is the holy spirit it'll agree with this word right if not see then what are we oh yeah boy boy look brother Dale I just shout Glory were wonderful I do too but I want to follow the word that's what I shout about I Rejoice over the word being opened because that word is God himself amen all right and that's why I'm so happy about the word that that's been revealed to us all right but now watch three times four times for knowledge is the knowledge before something takes place all right and knowing that will take place and there's no way to change it from taking place because it's God's foreknowledge no see I I don't agree with mankind on their thoughts even when big brother in this message one time said uh bill and I were talking about how some of the scriptures wouldn't even be fulfilled well I don't believe him because I know where the Prophet said all scriptures got to be fulfilled amen you say you're calling the man alive no he called himself one I didn't have anything to do with it all right but you understand now so remember I want to to bring it up you remember the little drawing that I made just for the purpose of understanding so go ahead and uh and brother pull up the drawing Brother Anderson because I made a drawing specifically these were because they say a picture is better than a thousand words well I done blabbered a whole lot so you can look at one picture maybe you can understand what I'm talking about but you see all over on this side of the line that I've drawed and I made it specifically of the Mind where we'd understand and going through to seeing that God buys foreknowledge he knows all the time we know the lamb according to the Bible was slain before the foundation of the world in all names it would ever be written in the book of life you know the last book of life was written at that time we know all of that but that has to do with your Earthly Journey come on the writing of the lounge Book of Life has to do with your Earthly Journey that's why I quoted it over and over and over now four times knowledge four knowledge is a knowledge before see they wouldn't be no need of having a lounge Book of Life with names written in it if it wasn't going to be a connection to an Earthly Journey we would have just bypassed all of this went right on over and there wouldn't have been any situation but God knew if he made us we would fall you have any problems with that he knew if he made mankind he'd fall take the baptism of the Holy Ghost away from any individual you me brother Branham any individual outside of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're nothing but a mortal Beast subject to Satan now well you'll know how to say that my brother well he wanted to smoke that cigarette you want to talk a little bit we can talk a whole lot see we want to make him some kind of up up above all of us no we don't make him no lowering or nothing he was just God we'll get to it in a minute he was a prophet of God just like Moses Moses had a lot of faults and failures but there's one thing about it Moses done something you and I can't do he went back in the back part of God's mind and wrote the whole book of wrote Genesis Exodus Leviticus number Deuteronomy even wrote of his own death before he died come on it's in the Bible is any problem with that if he could write the beginning my brother's messages preacher he said how can you write of your own death I said you tell me how he knowed what happened in the garden that's right and that's easy to find out he could rot because I could write down right now if the Lord don't come pretty quick I'm gonna die he's had any problem no problem with knowing that part of it but how did he know that beginning where did he get that from what you see everything then your election make your calling an election sure you're calling the mind of God predestination choosing foreknowledge for Saul for no all of that is dealing with cedar word The Plan of Redemption and you could come in and see not moving it on over but just showing that this is God's mind that he knows this will take place then it drops down into time and takes place upon the Earth that's where you get your free will you get your free moral agency we didn't have a free moral agency back here in God's mind wait just a minute now hit a little something didn't I you show me your free will in God's mind Free Will was God knowing now God knew we would have a free will don't misunderstand me he knew but that's his foreknowledge remember for knowledge number five is the knowledge before it happens but by the knowledge it's going to happen so whatever he had here is going to come here right he saw that I've tried to make it see down here we become the word down here we receive the baptism of the Holy and here we receive eternal life all right now when we get to it and the message a little later especially this afternoon and maybe Wednesday night we start talking about how we always was eternal didn't just remember what we said the only way you can have eternal life is to receive eternal life gold if not you did not need a savior Jesus Christ died in vain if you think you always was eternal well I got 49 quotes well don't worry about it we're going to see what it means right was everybody following me now God in his foreknowledge and all of the things that was in his mind the book of life was written through the lounge Book of Life was written but when he wrote the Lamb's Book of Life and you say well there's only names in that right amen all agree with you because we're not talking about a book like a piece of paper with names on it God don't have to have that to keep records the computer shows that right you can go some of you I can't even remember your name you see you're crazy no I can't remember nothing I'm sorry but my you know my computer never forget all I got to do is it it'll come up that's greater than a piece of paper to write on but God don't need that he's the one that helped him design the computer but Iran said it broke into God's laboratory right look at what they're doing you explain to me how that computer works you explain to me how that over on the other side of the world right now 12 hours away of course they're in a different day but they can sit right there and watch your service you explain that to me and you know we don't have to talk about the rest of it but look see here's where we have the Redemptive plan we have the the word of God coming forth here's where we have over here in life is where we have the whosoever will the predestination is dealing in our lives so watch it now I was going to title a message and hadn't done it yet the condescending of God because that's what he's doing here to here to here then that way we can see where we're at and realize this is so I ask you the question I'll ask you this many times over the 40-something years did God sit back there and look down or is this what he's looking at he said well this is what he's looking at we know for sure well then was he back there or is he here now come on you know the brother Dale I thought he sat back there and looked at it you know why have him sit back and look at it when he knows all about the whole thing did he have to think it over before he would come into being now come on we're talking about an infinite God a God that knows all things and we're not going to pull anything over on anyone our smart ick ideas so we might as well forget it and just settle down all right see then there was a time that that we could only have in the terminologies of of of the authors and and the theologians ETC and the writings of Bringing Down the Bible to us the word god is where you come into Genesis 1. in the beginning God created all right that word god at that point is coming downward our condescending and the best you can do there is to use the word Elohim or him every how you want to pronounce it meaning self-existing right now if he's self-existing then how could we be up there with him so let's get all that out of her mind see even the thoughts about it how could he be self-existent if we were there with him now the only form that anything connection to the human being has to what would be self-existing we would have to receive the life of the one that self-existing are you with me that would be the only way you can talk about self-existing you can't talk about it as Little People's little deaths and little doubts now you can only talk about it as that eternal life that you have was in God before the world all right now but that's what we're trying to get to to find out see to see the day and the hour that we're living and we believe do we not believe that this is the end time you know not making no dates times or Seasons we never have I proved to you years ago we comprised 2026 for the prophet's message and still not have no problems all right you can calculate that that means we've got about 13 more years 13 more years I'm going to be pretty old and so are most to you all right there's going to be a lot of little bat little Mounds up a dirt pushed out to me you know because and we ain't going to make it that far and the way things is going now I don't think we will make it that far but now get the point we what we talk about what I've always heard preachers try to preach is dealing with these realms here thinking they're back here now if you're dealing with rims of this being God's mind and his foreknowledge you got a part but what about when you get over here to seeing yourself you can't bring yourself back here he would no longer be self-existing I mean I got a ninth grade education that's sensible to me maybe with too much education is what messes us up we don't have anything against it I wish I could have got more but I played a mule all day I wasn't able to go to school but listen if he dwelt alone that was the end of the message Wednesday that God dwelt Alone see he was self-existing there was nobody dwelt with him he created angels first and they worshiped him and that gave him the word God in Genesis 1. because God means an object of worship there was nothing to worship him when he was self-existing he said well what was his name there's no way to put a name there I'll tell you what his name was if you want to know because it takes about 40 years to understand it but his name was Jesus so Jesus dwelt alone he said no that can't be called g-a-e-s means us with him now that's coming this way that's coming on down this way all right that gets us over here but remember Jehovah's not a name I'm talking to a Jehovah Witness people one day and they were saying Jehovah's tonight I said would you tell me the scripture says by my name Jehovah's I never know I mean that's Bible he said by my name's Jehovah has never known all right Jehovah was put on as to give understanding because really it's jvhv or jvhu as some will use and that way then you're bringing it j v h v as having no vowels Etc in your English Majors you know you can't pronounce it see there's no way to pronounce it all right so they put on to that and made it Jehovah into the English language bringing it down but I love the meaning of Jehovah because Jehovah means like a father with his family I love that meaning you've got to put Lord God together in Genesis to come out to the correct understanding see the Elohim the self-existing one created angels and they worshiped him now you got the title of God all right but just remember he was still existing alone he said wait just a minute now you trapped yourself there because he created angel s are not people you never had anybody like himself he created angels first and they worshiped him that made him God then you've got to get over about Genesis 2 to where you pick up the word Lord God meaning Jehovah Elohim he created man in Genesis 1. right let us make Manning on him then when he did you pick up the title Jehovah I love it when the prophet will get to it in a minute we have time where he said he'll never be self-existing but those angels were not like him he wanted somebody like him but just remember you say well how did you come up with the name of Jesus because that's what according to the Bible that he was to be called Emmanuel which was God With Us and said you'll call his name Jesus no Jesus means Jehovah's savior Jehovah see running all the way back to Joshua because the word Joshua actually deals which with Jesus coming down as an understanding and you won't Bible now all right we'll get in the Bible Jesus said one day he said I come in my father's name now what would be the name of the father then no no no no no no no no you don't matter that means a brother Carly went in my name that's human terminologies we can't deal out of the way in Bible terminology he said I come in my father's name didn't he tell us to ask all in the name of Jesus then he turned around one day and said ask the father anything in my name well what's the problem with understanding Jesus is his name to me that means a great deal you see yeah but one of these days you're going to have a new name I ain't worried about that I'm worried about his name Jesus because Jesus has to do with Redemption so until that we're here in this form until we're changed and going out of here we don't worry about a new name well now what it is we've got to get a new name to be able to be changed uh according to my understanding the name of Jesus is the name of redemption so that would cover your entire Journey and the change and then you could talk about a new name yeah but you just I know it I'm just that dumb I just I just like to stay down here on Earth because we're here that's what I've always said about the people people are in this message are too Heavenly minded to be of any sensible use on Earth right place this brother's got have you heard that have you heard the tapes on so-and-so well just keep watching him after a while if he's writing a lineup if not he'll go get mad three or four times mess it all up or take a bunch of girls I ain't throwing no jokes it's true every one of these seed doctrines you name a Seed doctrine I can tell you where the head of it went but everybody wants to talk about a seed we ain't even got back to talk about a seed he said brother I believe in a predestinated Eternal seed if I'm going to believe in eternal life but I also believe as human beings and Mortals we came into a world had lost and doomed and on the way to hell and we've got to be born again before that seed can catch up with us in any way me the prophet said about the little woman at the well said she had representation from predestination another time he said by predestination all right this representation from or by predestination then predestination is by what for knowledge which means knowledge before of what's going to be on earth all right so you keep ourselves down here and get an understanding so let's go ahead brother news number four and we'll start with it this is where we we had a couple of quotes Wednesday night but I don't want to get this off of you I want this to stay on your mind until you see it and look what the prophet of God had to say about these things this is from Christ's mystery God reveal 1963 728 paragraph 102 and 103. now God's secret mystery he had before the world begun now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was going was trying and was going to achieve he had a motive in doing it what was his motive in order to let himself be expressed all right but think about it in the back part of God's mind I wrote my own self a note where we'd make sure not to miss it you say well brother so and so preached two souls and others two Lords others perusias all kind of doctrines they all said that they had the mind of God right they said God told showed it to him come on all right right they said God revealed it to him then it was a great mystery the only thing I want to know is because see I don't claim to have that I want to know how you got it how did you get a great great revelation of what this is or that is that's all I want to know well I got it from the Holy Ghost well why didn't the Holy Ghost use you are we supposed to follow you you see that tears up doctrines don't you but he should tear up our little bitty pity ideas in her mind of what we think we are just remember Amos 3 and 7 says that he'll do nothing but reveal his secrets to His prophets well I've got the Holy Ghost you mean he can't reveal it to me no he can't is that plain he didn't right what's with you or not I'm not throwing off on people I'm trying to make it right where you can understand but with your Holy Ghost did you know what took place in Genesis no we all thought Evie to Apple and gave adam an apple and had a bellyache foreign oh we know it was unbelief sure what you think about Moses and you'll see what I'm talking about that Moses could write Genesis Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy from the mind of God that was the back part of God's mind I tried to explain it Wednesday night as a human and being the best I can do the front part of your mind is your intelligence that is known as your conscious part of you the front part is your intelligence your your your ability to communicate and operate to do in the back part of your mind is called a subconscious and in that subconscious is where you dream where you do and when you go to sleep that's what keeps you alive is a subconscious all right we can have dreams and Visions right because we have a partial connection to a subconscious part of us but a prophet they told brought around said you could dream a dream and stand there Wide Awake they could prove it by their machinery see because the prophet's conscious conscious and subconscious is right together that's the way he explained it so Moses could go back in the back part of God's mind and tell what happened in the garden with Adam and Eve we know some of the other things he could record as he was living because he lived out through it going down through the journeys we went here we went there we done this but what about getting the mind of God go back in the back part of God's mind into that subconscious part of you call it or whatever and bringing forth those great things see those prophets had a connection that's why they could not deal with them mankind couldn't deal with the prophets sure they could kill them they done everything but they couldn't deal with them what about Isaiah standing there one day how would you like to been one and walked out in front of a whole group of people like this instead of Virgin shall conceive would you like to done that would you like to do it now walk down the street out here you're going to be in a straight jacket before long but you see Isaiah could say from the mind of God a virgin shall conceive and I shall call his name Emmanuel look how those prophets could pick up as great as John the Baptist was like I've always tried to explain to you the prophet of God made a statement one day that really helped me to understand he said that John was told said when you see that Holy Spirit come down and remain I thought oh God there's just give it all because John could stand out there and see Caiaphas and under the anointing of the Holy Spirit to prophesy right come on even Saul went down under the Sprout spout as we call it and come out prophesying John look at that and he could see that anointing strike at high priest he's wondering is this the guy I'm supposed to introduce because that's what he was told the one you see the Holy Spirit descend and remain is the one you introduce so we can seek office he could come in and go out he knew those High priests were under the anointing of the Holy Spirit remember his daddy was priests coming down he knew the lineup but when he seen Jesus and he's seen the Holy Spirit descending on the River Jordan and it never left him he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world the mind of God had become into a reality through a man's lips God put the thought into John's mind and brought it down and John spoke it it become word see what are we talking about we've had a prophet to bring us the word of God yet look what they're trying to do with this message didn't denying it and cutting it into pieces that's all right they got their judgment because that before knowledge before the foundation of the world had to be because it can't be no other way the Bible says there must needs to be heresies among you it didn't say maybe they'll come or you know the Bible says they must need to be heresies among you why that they that are approved are correct or right shall be made manifest the best way to know truth is to go talk to somebody that's telling you a lot of error and then if the Holy Ghost in you can't set that thing astray and say wait a minute I don't know how to answer but there's something wrong right it's just something the person said ain't right that way you'll get away from all these doctrines and you won't be falling after him but you see go back in the back part of God's mind that God had a plan and a purpose in doing it to let himself be expressed all right in him was attributes as we call it what is an attribute your children or your attributes displayed down because they were in you into the mail you know coming down you got to have a female too but attributes now a prophet would use an illustration about an attribute and he'd say uh you're an attribute of your father said you was in your father before you ever come into the world then he makes an outstanding statement and he says every Apple that will ever be on that tree was in that one little seed that brought forth the apple tree thousands of bushels of apples come off of the tree now how was they all in there oh they was packed in there oh yeah yeah go ahead do you realize what he's just saying that you were in your father that you were in your grandfather they can prove by DNA who you belong to who your daddy is who your granddaddy is who's your great granddaddy is I can just keep running your genealogy all the way back right they can do the same thing with the woman's out of it but you see then an attribute is not something standing there with you like my kids they were in me when I was born or where'd they come from that's why I always tell them they're not mcgillicuddies come on now I hope nobody wouldn't be guilty Angus they're not Miguel cuties they're Dales well they can prove it by the bloodline but you see then that way if we can even get one bit of a fathom of a thought of however Apple could ever be on a tree would be in that one seed when it was planted or how that you could be in your daddy your granddaddy your great granddaddy or just keep going on back if we can even fathom that as a thought you know any comprehension of whatever could be and we just begin to see how God was when he dwelt alone but in him dwelling alone in him he had attributes in him he had thoughts true and in him he didn't have eternal life I want that the coast good he was eternal life so you're going to see when I get back to it to the point maybe this evening sometime I don't want to be just in the mind of God right because everybody in the world in some form or other has been in the mind of God or his thinking I said this 40 years ago what is it I don't want to be part of his thoughts I want to be part of the Thinker the one who done the thinking because that's the only way you can have eternal life be part of that Eternal God Amen see ya and now you make it pre-existence I certainly am pre-existence of eternal life tell everybody that brother Dale believes in pre-existence of eternal life but don't cut the tape off when I said pre-existence make sure you put eternal life with it and made a statement and sister asked me the other day and I've tried to explain it but I said be careful how you start all this predestination Doctrine you're going to predestinate yourself out of existence if you have to agree and you must that there was a time he was self-existing then if we can't go back to that part and get to that state of being that would be there then you would predestinate yourself out of existence Come Home Folks them thoughts don't come from well forget it see we've been dealing with what would take place here the foreknowledge is the predestinations dealing with the things that are reality life existence now we're looking back by the prophet of God to speak of the mind of God as the back part of God's mind and then Wednesday night we went through and through and through trying to show the point in reading the thing were the prophet of God would use it that God dwelt Alone then there's no capability of us in any form that's trying to be back there and one thing I've never understood human ego I've never understood that about any others because why is a human ego not wanting God to be number one now you tell me human ego wants God to be one I'm going to tell you you're a liar to your face no ain't no life about it human ego is nothing to do with you trying to make God great human ego have to do are you trying to be great that ought to be enough to to annihilate all of the thoughts of egos you know I preached that first bless God I'm I'm the first one okay what kind of an ego you got you got a number one guy first ego now let's go look a step further but I didn't mean to go this way on this part but all right we'll go why is it the human ego don't deal with the spirit that's within you think a second you understand what I'm saying the human ego of the inward part of man the soul does not want God to be number one unless he's born again that changes the ego of the Soul right the ego of the soul is what the new birth you've got to change that right then it puts God first but even after you put the new birth within the soul changing the ego of the person I'm looking at a display of egos because I cannot see your spirit Realm you can deceive me you can be set in our wishing I wish you'd hurry up and other would be sitting there I wish he'd explain what he's talking about so I'm saying well dinner's getting ready that's all in your spirit Realm but why is it that every ego boosts this man now you tell me it don't ever ego that's ever been in the world is this wanting to boost this man this flesh Ponce de Leon sail the world to try to find what the Fountain of Youth right nobody wanted it and somebody was able capable of spending a lot of money he wanted to find something or somebody sent him out looking for it why didn't he go down to the church and talk to them oh brother Dale had this through her for their soul all right you just caught what I'm talking about now Ponce de Leon wanted something for this this is what we want this is what we won't satisfy this is where we want our this is our ego is our bodies and you tell me that ain't right then I'll ask you the question why is it every doctor in this message that's when after human egos hadn't went to the flesh come on you've been around long enough many of you know all about it you've heard about it and you know about these doctrines and how they go where did they go does it lift God up does it even get into the spiritual Realm it's into this man here he said wait a minute because this man ain't working I'll agree with you I got sense his body can't work without it but why is that Spirit working back up on this body even as we're born again Christians you understand where I'm going Born Again Christians come on ain't nothing wrong with looking nice we are too I wish I could but I'm not throwing off on it I'm just trying to tell you the truth there's more muscles been strained in front of a mirror then lifting weights right we listen to the tape the other day I got tickled ribbon run around and we're talking about the Christian Life and how it comes in and takes over things in any evidently was just in his beginning because of what he was saying he's just a young boy you know he wasn't married and you know he was standing there and he was talking about the Lord and how great it was and how the Lord had come along he said this girl walks by and said she drops her handkerchief well you know what that is come on that was the way the girls are old days now young girls you're different now you don't do it that way right you just go right after him right the old days the girl would drop a handkerchief or something you pick up oh Ma'am you dropped your handkerchief back to her she's oh thank you you'd unhooked you got a date for the night and everything going on right but brother random said he was standing there and said just let you walk my girl and dropped her hands he said ma'am you dropped your hand could you I said well something was done took over that man you know he wasn't interested in the date but why is that ego I didn't mean to maybe go to title isn't he called brother show but just leave it an ego in an individual in life that we're living and we think that's more important than anything else now answer me this one today answer me what do you call that big old word hypothesis or what is it what is that big old thing where you make a great big story out of something okay y'all pronounce it I can what if today that they put in a paper or brother Joe could read it off the internet and come out here and pass out to everybody in the church a piece of paper that up in Hall County Hospital they just found an instant cure for old age make everybody 18. instantly just you got to be there at two o'clock how many would be here right do you understand not making a joke making a truth s were more interested in the ego of this part I hear than we are the soul and the individual that could receive eternal life and hearing the word of God to be able to be changed in made 18 20 year old and never never have to die again what about it I've heard Brother Gary back there say we get one of them migraine headaches he said just take a pistol and blow somebody's head off to get rid of that headache and you'd think about doing it that's just human egos but listen Church there's no part of us in an ego form up in heaven as we start approaching the things I try to get a little bit Wednesday night to line up to just think about it we're not trying I I quit trying a long time ago to go to heaven because I found out that all of it's got to take here placed here before I can go up to her well I'm interested in what's taking place here the dead in Christ who rise first and we which are alive in our mind be changed and won't require I'm interested in what's taking place in here we're not going to heaven to be made eternal we'll get out all out of your mind then quit trying to figure out how you was back there Napoleon I just believe I feel like I was but listen Church there is no part of us as a human mortal of a body spirit and soul of a human mortal now when I come back to it later don't carry down on me and say you said so I said as a human mortal soul that is lost and doomed and everybody was except the Lord Jesus Christ there's none of that in heaven he said well what about this we get to the soul that's right so you better get to the soul in the correct way all right see God had attributes that he wanted to be displayed but he dwelt alone I gave them to you Wednesday where he said he didn't intend for no man to ever to be lost he never intended in any form for us to be lost so what were we back there what were we back there let's start on nine I'll try to read real fast okay go to number nine brother and we'll try to get it who do you say this is preached in 1964 paragraph 67. that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself God dwelt Alone with his stalks he'll never do that again I love that if you don't get nothing out of it you get that little statement he'll never do that again he'll never be self-existing there is no name to be tied on to him as a new name or some kind of a self-existing you can only start off by Elohim self-existing one but when he created Mankind and made a man like himself he'll never be self-existing again can't be what is it because his thoughts are being made manifest and that's why we are right here this day Lula Georgia he is God fellowshipping with his thoughts being made manifest oh yeah how many times have we went over that where the prophet of God said what look at number we'll go ahead with number 10 let's read five taken who is this melted in the beginning God dwelt Alone with his attributes as I spoke of this morning that's his thoughts now he dwelt alone with his attributes that's his thoughts well now why are we going to try to be back there well I want to be an attribute an attribute of a Healer a savior now come on there wasn't nothing sick In Heaven There wasn't nothing lost in heaven see we could spend hours on this thought if not see Satan and him fought in heaven but there was nobody there fought it with him they wouldn't know Souls joining up and battling Satan ain't a soul he's not a person he's a created being he can never be saved thank you thank you thank you sin originated in heaven through the Angels but not us are you reading it there's nothing but God alone but he had thoughts just like an architect sets down you know and he draws out his talks he's explaining it like his thoughts the way he's thinking but yet remember one thing while he was thinking you and I was not in existence he was only thinking about us even all of the line that went over this away coming down is only him thinking about us it's not us up there he was only thinking about us the lounge Book of Life was written for the foundation world we wouldn't slain in heaven I mean he wasn't slain in heaven and we didn't die in heaven everything's down here but he was self-existing he dwelt alone just his thoughts now let me end it I won't read the rest of these we'll pick up this evening let me ask you something about God's thoughts let me ask you a question are your thoughts a part of you don't raise your hand because I don't got some more to go behind you okay see because I like to trap you that away but I like what you think do you think your thoughts is a part of you and where's a dirty one come from come on well me and my thoughts are the same you better be careful you just thought the wrong thing because if you and your thoughts are the same and Satan comes in and puts the thought in oh no just explaining a thought so we know that our thoughts are not like his thoughts as the Bible said and our ways are not like his ways that's what the scripture says you see I can be doing wonderful with thoughts how many agree and all at once Here Comes something then it's just even dirty thoughts amen you brother there you have dirty thoughts yeah you do too so quit lying quit critical super religious you're a human if Satan can't tempt you you would have to be God could he even tempted Jesus Christ come on read your Bible turn these stones into bread he was hungry prophet of God coming along and adding it to her to say that Jesus was even tempted by women you say well I don't like that statement well let's forget it then it's the truth but he didn't yield to his temptation there's a lot of difference in it nothing wrong with the thought it's entertaining the thought right Satan's thoughts coming in is going to be an automatic part of life day but yet turning them down and not entertaining them see then what is my point you say Judas Iscariot was a part of God in his thinking now I didn't say part of God like Born Again experience I used it the way I wanted to he was in Jesus in God's thinking Adolf Hitler was everybody everybody ever come in the world was in God's thinking but none of those that I named off in real life you know doing none of those were a part of God they were part of God in his thinking part not a part of God in his being part come on I tried to write down something I hope I can get it you see why I used it as our thoughts our human thoughts we say are our thoughts Brother Gary you don't have my thoughts thank God see I can't have his thoughts that's his thoughts but you admit that sometimes as thoughts comes in there that you don't want is that part of you or is it something you thought of or is it something Satan placed in you is his thoughts using that as a carnal comparison or understanding to try to think about God's thoughts God's thoughts are Eternal and he can never have another thought see we can have all kind of thoughts and keep thinking but God can only have one thought about something when he thought about what was going to happen in the world and the thing it was settled you can never have another he could change his mind so don't try to deal with him can you change his mind well now Lord if you'll do so and so I'll do so and so you better be careful how you're dealing with him you better be ready to keep your thought at the end of it the point you've pledged to him for one thing for sure but think about it God's thoughts being eternal you can never have another thought whatsoever so Judas could be in his thinking but Judas wasn't a part of him everybody in the world was in his thinking of what we would do right there's that for knowledge again we've got the knowledge of knowing before that something will take place I don't want to do this what he thinks about because he thinks about everybody and you know his thoughts about the Rich Young Ruler ever consider those scriptures the Bible says he loved him that Rich Young Ruler he had great attributes in him right but yet he hit him where he was nobody could hit him and didn't work and he hit him in his money do you understand what I'm saying everybody in the world was in God's thinking that's why he could write the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundational world that's why he could write the Books it is called in Daniel and in the Book of Revelation they're called books which is The Book of Life which is the book of the The Book of Life to cover many things and then the Lamb's Book of Life they're books to be at the white Throne judgment and see there's a lot of difference between being in God's thoughts and being in God that's doing the thinking does everybody understand what I'm saying I'm not asking you to believe it I'm asking you do you understand there's a lot of difference in something you think about and it actually being a part of you everybody knows I love banana pudding but I don't have to have it as long as you got something else foreign what about see it's hard to comprehend God's talks that he can never have another thought he can never never change but see I want to be inside of that one not outside of him thinking about me for him to think about me could send me to hell because he'd know much of us but if I have the same eternal life in me this day that he had in him right I can never be lost amen you see eternal life is a whole lot different than just a good thought but Stan come on brother or going to church or being good see the thoughts of God are eternal we were not up there as little people running around in heaven and at the same time listen at the same time Judas was being thought of the lamb was being thought of that would die for the sins of the world that Judas would betray right it was the same time Judas was there John and Peter and those were there too and what did Jesus mean when he said I had fellowship with thee before the world when he said to Jeremiah said I knew you and ordained you a prophet before the world what's he talking about pre-existence I believe in pre-existence of eternal life that's the only pre-existence I'm concerned with I've always said they come up to me and told me today said you wouldn't have held you was born to Jones or a Smith or something he said by you denouncing your name and taken the name of Samuel Jones or something you'd become inheritance to a billion dollars what would you do not change my name so you're interested in the money you come along and tell me my real name wouldn't Dale I'll tell you my family adopted me if nothing else if I wasn't born into the family they adopted me and they gave me their name and they gave me the Dale nature and all which is laughing and talking and going and you come to Gillsville and you don't even have to look around you can pick out my family because all of us are done away happy I wouldn't want to change this to Gail I've been a day or too long he said well what are you getting at what's all in the world got any value to it I'm not concerned whether or not I was up in heaven my concern is what am I doing now because what I'm doing now is displaying what God taught back there why wouldn't we want to be happy and be a Christian yeah but brother Dale I'd figure out some way where I could get the money see that's what I mean say ego what good is it what do you think about it when he dwelt alone did you dwell with him or in him a lot of difference in the statement if you dwelt with him you'd be like everyone dwelled in him there's only one way to dwell in him and that's our eternal life because he always was eternal you just go and think about it and listen I invite you to we we sat down and listened to tapes and we we just put on a tape and we run through tapes going starting about 19 and 63 and go through 63 64 65. especially 64 and 65. and notice what brother Brown was talking about eternal life when I listened to bro so and so he said always was eternal if you always was eternal why are you getting old now right so there must be something else besides this ego go ahead 261. anybody have anything 261 in the spiral book anybody have a need just come in let's believe soon this life will all be over here soon we'll take our heaven burning me at home amen amen brother's got to go tomorrow for test on his prostate we believe it's all well what do you believe some sweet day we're going over all the beauties just a little while to stay always strange let's remember if this statement in healing and he said you step out of that aisle and start this way he said 50 or 60 percent already done he'll even say you're healed already why called you you believed it he said I'll just stay here let's bring it he bring it to me that's all right walk up here just a little while to stay here just a little while to wait just a little while believe and see when you step out walking you're making an effort foreign do you believe in God's phone to you you're making an effort well step out and believe it again leave it see if God is real or not together again what a blessing remember the service this evening pray one for another you're dismissed it's all in your customers foreign
