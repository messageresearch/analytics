[21:57] and every one of you here today
[21:59] Lord bless your heart bless your effort
[22:01] it was an effort to get up and come to
[22:04] church you had to overcome something
[22:09] something the devil sure didn't want you
[22:13] to come so you overcame him hey man
[22:16] devil they want you to be here today so
[22:18] you overcome that that's enough happy
[22:23] birthday buddy knowing you for a long
[22:26] time I remember when I graduated high
[22:31] school 1978 did give me $5 $5 bill hey
[22:41] in 1978 $5 was a miracle but to come
[22:45] from him was a double miracle we just
[22:53] all kind of grew up and got all together
[22:54] had me but I can remember that I can't
[22:58] remember nobody else give me anything
[22:59] but I remember brother dick gave me five
[23:01] dollars it was just a shock I guess good
[23:05] to be in it huh 40 yeah I know our 40th
[23:08] anniversary of our graduation we got to
[23:12] go I got to go want to get finished here
[23:13] and we got to get all that stuff
[23:15] straightened out ready to go for 40
[23:18] years
[23:20] Lord you were still 42 years old 40
[23:23] years ago in the doses I figured that
[23:31] $5.00 I figured that $5.00 came from you
[23:34] period not here okay yeah I figured
[23:39] okay well was I smart was I did you not
[23:42] tell her you gave me top dollar did you
[23:46] not tell her that you get oh she okay
[23:48] she that's what I figured anyway so
[23:52] y'all made it through 40 something years
[23:54] later so you didn't the Lord brought you
[23:57] through that five dollars he he doubled
[24:00] it tripled it quadruped little bit and
[24:04] that's right that's right
[24:08] absolutely and I believe that never seen
[24:12] it fail never saying fair you can't
[24:14] outgive God he can do more with our ten
[24:15] with ten percent and we can do with
[24:17] ninety hey man so you don't have to
[24:20] worry about that so if you got your
[24:21] Bibles or you want to follow along let's
[24:23] turn the revelations and get started
[24:29] before we get started
[24:31] Joyce said she forgot to put in a prayer
[24:33] request at Terry mote which is her

[24:42] your prayers this week some of you I
[24:44] don't know if anybody in here but boy
[24:46] people go through the open-heart
[24:47] surgeries it's rough on the spirit a lot
[24:50] of times more than it is on the on the
[24:52] body so I just keep him many prayers

[24:58] how much seventy one unit gracious we
[25:03] need to get out of here well get no I
[25:05] I'm gonna tell you when he was just a
[25:08] boy so let's go to Revelation six and we

[25:42] him so we kind of put in a little
[25:44] vacation time and there's a commercial
[25:47] beekeeper out there and we're gonna get

[25:51] we'll all be a good time just keeps any
[25:53] prayer so we'll be going next Sunday and
[25:55] Bob will be doing Sunday school and if
[25:57] any of you want to I'm going to do a sit
[26:02] I'm doing a series on the book of Romans
[26:03] downstairs and Sun Tzu class and we're
[26:05] gonna take the book of Romans and we're
[26:06] gonna break it down and go scripture by
[26:08] scripture so if you want to join us you
[26:11] can join us then we'll be doing that for
[26:14] a while down in sunday-school class so
[26:15] just keep sitting in prayers it just
[26:17] came to my attention that the book of
[26:20] Romans is sectioned into several
[26:22] sections one would be justification and
[26:24] one is sanctification so it's going to
[26:26] tie in right with what we're all talking
[26:29] about I was telling a class this morning
[26:30] I cannot for the life of me see how
[26:35] somebody can say that I always was
[26:38] eternal that I just came to this
[26:40] knowledge that I always was now listen
[26:43] we're coming to the knowledge that that
[26:45] inside of us always was but how are you
[26:48] gonna fit justification and
[26:50] sanctification what are you gonna do
[26:52] with bringing the Holy Ghost what are
[26:54] you gonna were you going to put that to
[26:55] me that just that just zeros out the
[26:58] Bible the Bible is for my Redemption and
[27:03] it's because I got lost right I got lost
[27:11] and then God found me but I got lost so
[27:16] I lost something a loss coming the way I
[27:19] should have come but now that we come to
[27:21] this realization and seals now that
[27:23] we'll see that yes it that there's a
[27:26] there's a part of God always followed
[27:29] you the whole time of your life but he
[27:32] wasn't in you he wasn't in you he but he
[27:35] was following right along and when you
[27:37] come to meet the word boom there comes
[27:41] same way with Paul Paul could not
[27:43] persecute those Christians and have any
[27:45] kind of eternal life in his soul or in
[27:49] his being at all because bride can't
[27:53] persecute bride he couldn't make those
[27:55] Christians blaspheme and him be standing
[27:58] there with any kind of eternal know he
[28:00] had representation though because that's
[28:03] what God God was just waiting says okay
[28:05] Paul I'll get you you got to go to
[28:07] Damascus first but I'll get you and
[28:09] you're going to respond and then you're
[28:11] going to turn around from all that and
[28:13] you're going to put people in the
[28:15] kingdom not put them you know try to
[28:17] kick them out of the kingdom so you know
[28:19] that's the same way with with us that
[28:21] Paul's conversion is no different ours I
[28:25] persecuted Christianity you said not by
[28:28] not being a Christian I persecuted
[28:30] Christians by not being one by living a
[28:35] contrary life to God
[28:38] amen so my conversion was just like Paul
[28:42] he knocked me down on my road to
[28:44] Damascus he knocked you down on your
[28:45] road to Damascus a man and you know what
[28:48] did I do I didn't go back to the world
[28:50] to find God Paul didn't go back to
[28:53] gamellia to find God he was sent to a
[28:57] brother that was already born again that
[29:01] had to life in him so that he could pray
[29:04] for Paul and then Paul could be
[29:06] quickened to life that's the way and I
[29:09] just see that I was telling them to
[29:11] Sunday School class that way I don't
[29:12] have to deny anything I can take the
[29:14] whole Bible Genesis to revelations I can
[29:16] take the whole Bible I know I was lost I
[29:22] just don't I to me to deny that it's
[29:25] just to didn't I what Christ came today
[29:28] just and and now I know we do come to a
[29:32] realization that we always was eternal
[29:34] that part of us was the word always was
[29:37] eternal and you were a part of that but
[29:41] we got lost that's why they call it a
[29:45] fall we fell from something alright
[29:49] we'll get started in just a minute
[29:50] revelation 6 verse 1 let's bow our heads
[29:54] do heavenly Father we pray today that
[29:55] you'd be with us not as a bystander but
[29:59] Lord to be the active participant in the
[30:01] service you take over Lord the hearing
[30:04] the speaking as we said this morning
[30:07] Lord now let's listen to what the Spirit
[30:10] says to the churches either has an ear
[30:13] let him hear we're here Lord to hear
[30:15] from you father not from an individual
[30:17] or one person but Lord we're here to
[30:19] hear from you father the person the Lord
[30:22] Jesus Christ everyone else is unworthy
[30:26] but you are worthy and now through you
[30:28] you've made us all worthy father forgive
[30:31] us of our sins bless us be with the
[30:33] missionaries on the foreign fields give
[30:35] them fruit for their labor father be
[30:37] with the ones that are not here the ones
[30:38] that are traveling ones that are sick
[30:40] Lord just bless them take care of them
[30:41] we ask these things in Jesus name Amen
[30:45] now the seal revelation six we really
[30:48] the last time a couple of weeks ago you
[30:50] know we really didn't get into it but
[30:51] world will
[30:52] try to get into a little bit more today
[30:54] and I saw him when the lamb had open one
[30:56] of the seals and I heard it was a noise
[30:57] of thunder one of the four beasts saying
[30:59] come and see and I saw him beheld a
[31:01] white horse he was selling him out of
[31:03] bow and a crown was getting given unto
[31:04] him and he went forth conquering and to
[31:06] conquer and when he had opened the
[31:09] second seal I heard the second beast
[31:11] which was the Ox
[31:12] say come and see and there went out
[31:16] another horse that was red and power was
[31:18] given him that set thereon to take peace
[31:20] from the earth and that they should kill
[31:22] one another and there was given unto him
[31:25] a great sword you may be seated in the
[31:27] Lord at his blessing to the reading this
[31:29] word you got that brother's name brother
[31:35] Danny and I came to a great revelation
[31:37] last weekend we are too old to play
[31:44] softball I think he might have had to
[31:49] stay out of work I didn't but I sure
[31:51] felt like I could have here little older
[31:55] than me that's right just a little
[31:56] though not much but we you know once
[32:02] working once that was revealed I ain't
[32:04] got to ask no more questions I'm done
[32:08] right
[32:09] that's what Danny said the other night
[32:11] is that they said they'd one thing for
[32:12] sure I ain't playin no more softball but
[32:16] we got then tried to act like kids and
[32:19] something that don't work out very good
[32:22] it actually really didn't work out well
[32:24] at all a lot hobbled around for a week
[32:26] and somebody oh boy huh
[32:30] still hobbling about got over mine
[32:32] almost but you never know you could you
[32:37] get old now where you sneezing something
[32:39] goes out a joint so tell me about okay
[32:45] well it's the truth into him so but you
[32:49] know what we're heading toward something
[32:51] we're heading towards something because
[32:54] this is look to be honest this is the
[32:56] fall what we're looking at you go back
[33:00] and look at your pictures twenty years
[33:01] ago and then look at it now you know
[33:03] something fell either you belly or you
[33:06] eyes or your mouth or you know something
[33:08] that ain't in the same place he used to
[33:09] be so but remember that thing inside of
[33:14] you though never got a do never got one
[33:18] second old it is eternal and it's what
[33:22] God saw and you know what if he saw it
[33:25] he's gonna have come to pass I don't
[33:29] have to worry about it he's gonna make
[33:30] it come to pass because that's his word
[33:32] his word said this is what's going to
[33:35] happen and you know what you know our
[33:37] connection is believing I was telling
[33:41] the son just good class downstairs I
[33:42] said look we do we we have to be a
[33:46] believer because we did not see most of
[33:51] us didn't even see brother Branham much
[33:53] less I never saw Jesus on the cross I
[33:55] never saw an empty tomb now dad went to
[33:58] a tomb but taste three or four tombs
[33:59] they say which one they could have stole
[34:01] the body you understand what I'm saying
[34:03] so we have to be a believer in something
[34:05] that we we don't even can't say Amen but
[34:09] now Jesus told us if we go back in the
[34:11] Bible though and he says the world won't
[34:13] see me no more but you will see me for
[34:17] I'll be with you even in you so the
[34:19] world's gonna see Jesus Christ through
[34:20] you and I and that's why we're that's
[34:23] why the word Redemption as we're going
[34:25] to pull up again Redemption means to
[34:27] what bring us back to a place to where
[34:29] Adam Adam and Eve were in the garden and
[34:32] had perfect harmony with God that's the
[34:35] same thing these seals go and pull that
[34:37] up if you want to just one more time
[34:38] just kind of give us a a refresher
[34:42] course because I we need to see the plan
[34:44] of redemption we need to see the full
[34:47] plan of redemption not just one like
[34:49] what you know brother Dale so much
[34:51] justification I was telling them
[34:53] downstairs amen
[34:54] justification is chopping off you past
[34:56] sin but when you come to this
[34:58] justification that we just got finished
[35:00] talking about then we realize that we
[35:03] must believe that that person inside of
[35:07] us did not do that did not do that one
[35:12] time that Genesis 1:26 man never sinned
[35:15] today because that's a piece of God
[35:19] amen that's it that's why Adam could be
[35:23] the lesser gone cuz he had gone in him
[35:27] working with no flu stopped up with no
[35:33] hindrance Jesus didn't get have to get
[35:37] up every day and say am i God today you
[35:40] know probably in the body he didn't feel
[35:42] like it a lot of times but he knew who
[35:45] he was and he knew that his work was not
[35:52] going to be in just that one body he
[35:58] knew he was going to come back and come
[35:59] into our body cuz that's what he wanted
[36:02] because remember nice thinking the other
[36:05] day you know Jesus standing on earth he
[36:08] said before Abraham was I am
[36:10] so what the mind that was in Christ was
[36:14] God okay he's like I found brother join
[36:20] him the other day kind of getting off
[36:21] the subject but I think I'm gonna stay
[36:22] on this just for a few minutes but Jesus
[36:25] when he got up when he got got up to
[36:27] adulthood see your problem and my
[36:30] problem is is I'll promise you one thing
[36:32] every human you see since you were a
[36:37] child till the day you pass on are we
[36:39] going to rapture we were all born in the
[36:42] same way rich poor big short fat ugly
[36:47] doesn't matter we were all born one way
[36:49] and we hold to that old nature because I
[36:56] came from my mom and daddy hey man see
[37:00] Jesus when he walked on earth he didn't
[37:02] have that he didn't have that carnal
[37:04] mind he didn't say I act this way
[37:07] because he didn't have nobody to pull
[37:09] him back to except who the Father that
[37:13] was in him the father that was in he was
[37:16] Almighty God so it's why he could say
[37:18] before Abraham was I am in other words I
[37:23] can remember now this is Jesus Jesus
[37:24] standing there you know hey I can
[37:27] remember when me and Adam walked in the
[37:29] Garden of Eden
[37:31] Jesus Christ was a tree of life folks
[37:33] it's not to people I think another day
[37:35] you know what do you think about when
[37:37] the Bible tells us that Christ came back
[37:40] in the form of the Holy Ghost
[37:45] no what do you think it's not a it's not
[37:52] a puff of our sheep blowing in the wind
[37:56] it's a person the Holy Ghost is a person
[38:00] it's the same man that walked on the
[38:02] face of the earth just take away the
[38:05] flesh body but being able to take away
[38:08] the flesh body he could get in your body
[38:11] amen so the Holy Ghost is not a no it's
[38:17] a person it's the same man in another
[38:20] form so that he can divide itself listen
[38:25] Jesus couldn't divide itself he was one
[38:28] man he couldn't divide itself as much as
[38:31] he wanted to help everybody in the world
[38:33] here's no way he could divide itself and
[38:35] get into the people so they can
[38:37] understand what he said he said but you
[38:39] go up to Jerusalem and you wait to be
[38:43] endued with power from on high
[38:45] because I'm going to come back not into
[38:47] one I'm going to go into 120 at one time
[38:50] then 3,000 and then several million ever
[38:53] how many million they are but the
[38:55] breaking of the seals then is not
[38:56] necessarily for the soul the soul was
[38:58] redeemed by whole I just say about the
[39:00] new birth by the shed blood of Jesus
[39:02] Christ but we'll bring full fellowship
[39:04] into manifestation
[39:06] our problem is it's what we were talking
[39:09] about last Sunday or 74 left is the
[39:11] flues now the inside man God Himself
[39:17] inside of you does not need Redemption
[39:23] he is the Redeemer okay so he's inside
[39:28] of you so who needs redemption that old
[39:32] Adamek nature that's attached to you in
[39:36] your spirit realm that's what needs I
[39:39] will just read and sister Shepherds
[39:41] dream again we're brethren with
[39:42] something like the trash
[39:43] let me read this real quick blasphemous
[39:45] names he's given the interpretation this
[39:50] man who was pouring the water the
[39:51] messenger to the church pouring the
[39:55] message into the church but what was the
[39:59] water doing it was boiling out all the
[40:02] trash that was in it that's what the
[40:06] Holy Spirit does balls it up balls the
[40:10] trash out none of your soul we must
[40:15] believe that your soul your soul doesn't
[40:18] need anything at the moment that's not
[40:22] the only problem is it's encased in all
[40:26] this junk that we are right it's like a
[40:30] capsule you know you you got medicine
[40:32] inside the capsule but until you take
[40:35] your capsule ain't gonna do you no good
[40:37] until what until that capsule dissolves
[40:43] until that capsule dissolves that
[40:46] medicine insides not gonna do you any
[40:47] good so to me that's what the breaking
[40:50] of the seals is it shows you that you
[40:52] are eternal but we're still here and
[40:57] there's a place we have to come to a
[41:01] full Redemption I got some quotes I may
[41:04] read them a couple of Sundays from now
[41:06] where brother Brian was talking about
[41:08] Luther and Wesley Park they had Park
[41:10] yeah they had part they had their part
[41:13] which was a fullness of their time but
[41:15] it only put them in a place of what
[41:18] their soul was redeemed by the new birth
[41:22] the what the age that we're coming into
[41:25] now which would be the fourth age which
[41:27] would be Columba it was it was coming
[41:30] out of that Nicean council all these
[41:34] doctrines were heading in father son
[41:38] Holy Ghost
[41:39] Trinity all that was heading into that
[41:41] age if you didn't believe that they
[41:43] killed you
[41:44] just like I showed and just like we're
[41:46] in
[41:49] Matthew Matthew 24 he talks about what I
[41:54] read it real quitting then we'll get
[41:55] back to it and you shall hear of wars
[41:57] and rumors of wars see that you be not
[41:59] trouble for all these things must come
[42:01] to pass but the end is not yet you were
[42:04] thinking that church age that 4th church
[42:06] age you would think those people in that
[42:08] age thought the world was coming to the
[42:09] end
[42:11] sixty-eight million so you know they
[42:14] heard from another and heard from
[42:17] another and heard from another that hey
[42:18] if you say you're a Christian you're
[42:20] dead so they figured the world was
[42:23] coming to an end but the Bible says no
[42:25] it's not coming to an end what the quart
[42:27] of wheat had to go down in the ground
[42:29] just like my brother nails done about
[42:31] two for combat beef or in the for one
[42:36] for eat it down for combat beasts
[42:37] brought it back up so they in this
[42:40] fourth church age that had to go down
[42:41] into the ground after Nicaea everything
[42:44] went what there was a suppression there
[42:46] was a dark time on the earth because
[42:51] what remember the next seal that we get
[42:53] into is going to be white color black
[42:56] it's going to lap over into these ages
[43:00] but remember what we're talking about
[43:02] now is read the Red Horse but when you
[43:06] go to the Black Horse now it's not so
[43:09] much physical death man's ideas got in
[43:13] and killed the people in Martin Luther
[43:16] and John Wesley's age and then with
[43:20] spiritual death not so they went to the
[43:22] physical death in this for church age
[43:24] but that doctrine that started at 6:06
[43:28] it came and it kept eating and kept
[43:31] eating in it it's still eating we think
[43:35] well no that was backed in denominations
[43:37] are still have the Trinity still alive
[43:41] the eternal hell is still a lot that's
[43:43] all still alive that's what I mean these
[43:45] horse riders they're still riding they
[43:48] have not been conquered now they got to
[43:54] be conquered in you
[43:59] they got to be conquered in you cuz that
[44:02] to me is the whole point to these seals
[44:06] now seeing your soul is conquered it's
[44:09] done it's finished I want us to see that
[44:11] when you wake up in the morning you're
[44:14] just as eternal as God is in the soul
[44:16] when you go through a bad day you're
[44:18] still just as eternal as God is in your
[44:20] soul when you have a good day you're
[44:22] still eternal as God is in your soul and
[44:25] then so were you having a bad day not in
[44:28] your flesh your flesh your flesh is just
[44:30] getting old and wearing out right knee
[44:33] that hurt to do that but now that spirit
[44:38] guy that's the one that we live in 100%
[44:42] of the time I said 100% time cuz this
[44:46] 99.99999 we let God brother direct pop
[44:49] up every once in a while I'm sorry but
[44:53] that's our problem because when Adam got
[44:56] up in the morning he knew who he was and
[44:59] he just went right Hey look he didn't
[45:02] have a quote book he didn't have so and
[45:06] brother stone so he could call and get
[45:08] some encouragement
[45:09] he went straight to God if he needed
[45:13] anything he said God in other words in
[45:15] other words just like the Bible says
[45:16] before you asked what he say God said
[45:18] are in you you'd ask me already got it
[45:20] ready for you don't you think that's
[45:21] right and with Adam soon as Adam thought
[45:23] it garden you had already thought it so
[45:25] he'd give it to him that's what you and
[45:27] I got to come to because listen God's
[45:32] always wanting to fellowship with you in
[45:34] flesh always that was his intended plan
[45:39] it's to fellowship with you in flesh you
[45:42] as a person you as an individual
[45:46] he wants to fellowship with you in your
[45:49] flesh you say how do you know that so
[45:52] that's what we're going to an eternity
[45:53] to do
[45:57] so in this age of sanctification we got
[46:02] to see let's go to Revelation let's go
[46:04] to the first quote Revelation chapter 5
[46:08] we've read these before we'll read them
[46:10] over again see it's these seals opening
[46:13] up but just beginning to reveal the plan
[46:15] of redemption how he did it it's all
[46:18] over now just about just about finishing
[46:20] up so we're at the end so that's one of
[46:22] the things are being revealed that's why
[46:24] I took a profit in the last days last
[46:27] age to bring all this together hey look
[46:30] Martin Luther yes he came to
[46:32] sanctification but he wasn't sanctified
[46:36] as you an hour I mean we can't drink him
[46:42] I don't want to drink a beer but you see
[46:45] what I'm saying his desire was not that
[46:47] deep but God was pleased to dwell in
[46:50] Martin Luther because he took that piece
[46:52] of the word to just shall live by faith
[46:54] I've been studying the book of Romans
[46:56] and do you know that Martin Luther's
[46:57] favorite one of his favorite books of
[46:59] the Bible was Romans because it talks
[47:01] about justification the just shall live
[47:04] by faith he quotes it several times in
[47:06] the book of Romans so I'm gonna read
[47:08] through that and read some of Martin
[47:09] Luther's commentary about that but see
[47:10] that was his message just shall live by
[47:14] faith
[47:15] john wesley you gotta live a sanctified
[47:18] life clean and set aside for service and
[47:22] then the pentecost come in with the Holy
[47:24] Ghost but now see and I don't like to
[47:26] say we're beyond that or above that but
[47:29] we have to be in a progression we do
[47:31] have to be above that because none of
[47:34] that works for us just just living a
[47:36] sanctified life it's the worst thing you
[47:38] can do my brother now saying you read
[47:43] Ezekiel you get a new spirit of
[47:45] sanctification the prophet of God said
[47:47] so you can what live with yourself
[47:54] so the unclean spirit goes out come here
[47:57] for singing you're gonna be an unclean
[48:00] spirit okay
[48:01] stand behind me all right give me a hand
[48:05] all right the unclean spirit goes out of
[48:07] a man cool
[48:09] the unclean spirit goes out we'll see
[48:11] who's left me I'm still here me my
[48:16] persona Who I am what I'm doing is still
[48:19] right here that in clean spit unclean
[48:21] spirit is dripping out Lord I can't deal
[48:26] with this cigarette smoking anymore
[48:28] whatever you want to call it because you
[48:30] know some of us didn't have problem with
[48:31] that some of us did some of didn't I did
[48:34] other things so what name your demon huh
[48:39] zach is my date no but that unclean
[48:43] spirit goes out well there's nothing
[48:45] there but you right now you get where
[48:50] God what does he do he brings a spirit
[48:54] that's what the ezekiel says you watch
[48:56] brother branham he says he god gives you
[48:59] a spirit of sanctification that show you
[49:01] can deal with yourself and then another
[49:03] quote he says where that God can start
[49:05] dealing with you because what God can't
[49:07] come closer when you got this demon
[49:09] inside of you God won't dwell in an
[49:12] unclean vessel so he's got to get rid of
[49:14] the unclean spirit some of y'all are
[49:19] like this I got rid of him I got rid of
[49:24] him I really didn't I got rid of him
[49:29] no I got rid of him God got rid of him
[49:33] for me but it was by the washing of the
[49:35] word and then the word came and washed
[49:38] what the trash sorry man you were just
[49:40] sitting up front the trash the trash out
[49:45] but now look that's cleaned and set
[49:48] aside the glass is clean but he liked me
[49:57] he liked being in here he was he had fun
[50:00] man we had all kind of fun you know we
[50:03] did things together so he comes back and
[50:07] he attaches itself to me again
[50:10] but you know what I let him
[50:13] I let him back in even though I was
[50:17] given a spirit of sanctification because
[50:21] that's what happened to Judas Judas if
[50:23] the unclean spirit went out of Judas
[50:25] healed the sick raise the dead
[50:27] right but what happened whatever that
[50:31] spirit was that left Judas see he likes
[50:37] coming back you see smiling see you like
[50:39] you notice he likes it
[50:41] see that's what that devil does that
[50:42] then was going I'll be back in a little
[50:43] while right but now what if he comes
[50:46] here and whatever a void that was in me
[50:50] is filled with God that's the Holy Ghost
[50:55] because see when the unclean spirit goes
[50:58] out of a man washing drunk places
[51:01] seekest read find us know what he
[51:03] doesn't it's kind of like a baby being
[51:04] born man this thing's been worn for nine
[51:07] months and it's been all good now all of
[51:08] a sudden I'm cold you know sorry that's
[51:11] what he's doing he's after going I don't
[51:13] understand if you don't keep that thing
[51:17] washed out keep it clean he's going to
[51:21] come back and attach yourself and he's
[51:23] going to be worse because he's going to
[51:27] bring seven of his other friends and
[51:32] they're all gonna be smiling like that
[51:41] but that's it that's what sanctification
[51:44] does it now you say well what about in
[51:47] them in the seals when I see in the
[51:49] sanctification in the seals
[51:50] this guy's not anywhere in my soul he
[51:55] has moved to the second man he can't get
[52:01] in my soul anymore if I'm born again but
[52:05] he does have access because I was born
[52:08] in sin shaving iniquity I got a nature
[52:10] of this world he can step into my spirit
[52:13] realm amen
[52:15] he can step into my spirit realm and try
[52:19] his tactics again right now we know one
[52:22] thing for sure if we've got the Holy
[52:23] Ghost were sealed so the things I do I
[52:26] don't do no more but now what about the
[52:31] preacher
[52:33] what was it Ramsey now see that demon of
[52:38] alcohol he may have had to Falk that
[52:41] before he was a Christian he became a
[52:43] Christian started preaching the met
[52:45] preaching the met his message right
[52:47] brother Brahm tells the story amen then
[52:50] he what does he get what he done was he
[52:52] got us he led a spirit come back and
[52:55] attach itself to him in his spirit realm
[52:58] and he went to drinking again amen
[53:02] that's what the Prophet said the Prophet
[53:04] said he had to take his servant homes
[53:06] with wouldn't Mars name why he couldn't
[53:08] get the soul of brother Ramsey but he
[53:11] attached himself so much to the spirit
[53:13] realm to what there was a desire there
[53:15] our desire must be for God
[53:18] our desire must be like I was talking
[53:21] downstairs we have you know Paul when
[53:24] Paul walked into car rent because
[53:26] remember Paul well I want to tell you
[53:28] this or not Paul was in Corinth when he
[53:30] wrote his letter to the Romans okay he
[53:34] wasn't in Rome he was going to Rome but
[53:36] he was writing to the Saints that were
[53:37] in Rome but he was writing to the Romans
[53:39] but he's in Corinth but remember when he
[53:41] walked into car rent here's our statue
[53:43] for this one statue for that one
[53:48] mother-in-law's living with their
[53:51] son-in-law remember that in the Bible
[53:54] all these other different lists of
[53:56] things that I think I read one day up
[53:58] here that they what that was sitting in
[54:00] Polish congregation now what did he do
[54:01] he didn't go in there and just start
[54:03] knocking idols down he preached the
[54:06] gospel he preached the gospel and the
[54:09] washing of the water of the word that
[54:12] Idol was still on the pole but it didn't
[54:17] have any effect on that person anymore
[54:18] once that person was converted amen
[54:22] but remember Satan don't stop there
[54:25] he'll give you another Idol he'll give
[54:29] you whatever you are to make you Idol is
[54:32] your idol right amen IDL e hey I do
[54:38] Elle's make you ID le so the idols that
[54:44] Paul had to deal with and the idols that
[54:46] we have to deal with the problem with
[54:49] Cara I'm not the problem but the
[54:50] glorious thing about Corinth was to the
[54:53] Corinthians he wrote that book of
[54:55] Correction and remember they turned to
[54:58] God Paul says such were some of you but
[55:01] you are what washed washed by what
[55:05] Paul's word washed by the water of the
[55:08] word through Paul through preaching the
[55:13] washing of the water the word is what
[55:15] not only sanctifies you because once
[55:18] you're sanctified filled with the Holy
[55:20] Ghost that part of sanctification you
[55:23] don't need anymore because it's not in
[55:24] the soul we got to realize something and
[55:28] when I get finished will come to this
[55:29] seventh seal your soul can't be changed
[55:33] it's eternal it's not up or down it's
[55:39] not in or out you're sealed in you got a
[55:45] ticket to glory
[55:46] you oh don't you're not heading toward
[55:49] eternal life you walk you're with
[55:51] eternal life
[55:52] amen now walking with eternal life the
[55:56] vessel that we are
[55:58] has to come under the washing of the
[56:00] water of the word to keep us clean and
[56:04] make us what the Bible say clean every
[56:11] with in other words I die daily a daily
[56:17] sanctification a daily washing the
[56:21] messenger pouring the water in the
[56:22] bucket and driving out all the trash
[56:25] because remember we all still have
[56:30] problems and if you don't have listen if
[56:33] you don't have a problem that you can't
[56:36] tie back to that message the statue of a
[56:38] perfect man what are you sitting here
[56:41] for well you're sitting here for you
[56:46] need to be your aperture don't out of
[56:47] here I don't understand these people
[56:51] that that think the fact you're a
[56:53] perfect man is just it's not we don't
[56:55] need it we meet we don't need it what do
[57:00] you mean we don't need it to me that's
[57:03] one of the most important messages to
[57:05] get us out of here now I didn't say to
[57:07] get us save I said to get us out of here
[57:09] to get us out of here that has to that
[57:13] trash cannot dwell in that vessel and
[57:16] that's not a pyramid that's you and
[57:22] that's what we're trying to do by the
[57:25] washing of the water the word system it
[57:28] doesn't matter if it moves you that much
[57:29] you've moved the things I used to do I
[57:34] do them no more why that part has died
[57:40] that unclean spirit has tried it's best
[57:42] to get back in and you know what use
[57:46] like brother Devils talking about you
[57:47] have something to do with this now
[57:51] there's one thing you can't do you can't
[57:52] justify your past life but you have to
[57:56] ask for forgiveness to trigger to
[57:58] trigger God to get rid of that path all
[58:01] right but now sanctification you got to
[58:04] stand and say I don't want that no more
[58:06] I don't want this no more I don't want
[58:09] you know you something pop up and you go
[58:11] I just don't want that anymore you get
[58:15] sick of it the things used to love you
[58:19] know I didn't mind going to place them
[58:20] sitting in a bar before but you know
[58:25] what means you've got setting the bar
[58:27] the other night we drink all we wanted
[58:30] to wish the drunk when we left we
[58:33] couldn't find the door we drunk on each
[58:35] other but you know what there was no
[58:40] desire for me to order a beer even
[58:44] though I was sitting in Longhorns in the
[58:46] bar
[58:46] I'm not Longhorns I don't go to
[58:48] Longhorns takes the road ham Texas
[58:50] Roadhouse sitting in Texas Roadhouse
[58:51] they put us in a bar but you know what
[58:52] that didn't make me uncomfortable I
[58:54] didn't do like what daddy said I'd say
[58:56] bless God I'm a preacher don't put me in
[58:58] that I play good grief
[59:02] come on now you know why that guy said
[59:07] that he's afraid to go in that bar he
[59:11] might have still had one of them Zach's
[59:13] attached to him he had a sack attack I
[59:17] just came up with that that was funny
[59:20] the others that so from now on when the
[59:23] devil bothers you you have a sack attack
[59:28] [Music]
[59:33] but you know what though we can have fun
[59:35] because you can be so serious you can
[59:37] kill yourself you can be so serious but
[59:41] what I do is is is when I look at
[59:43] something I look at it and say well if I
[59:46] did do that here's the repercussion and
[59:50] I ain't gonna get into my notes again
[59:51] but you know what that's okay don't
[59:52] worry about we'll get it next week
[59:54] couple weeks but I look at the
[59:56] repercussion I'm not I'm not looking at
[59:58] drinking smoking gambling running around
[59:59] when women pornography no I'm not
[1:00:01] looking at that
[1:00:02] I'm just looking into general things
[1:00:04] that I do but you know what I do best
[1:00:09] thing for you to do we we were talking
[1:00:12] about something the other day remember
[1:00:15] when I did that Family Matters series
[1:00:18] several years ago remember what I told
[1:00:21] you
[1:00:22] teenagers to do if something got a
[1:00:24] little let me put it this way hot and
[1:00:27] bothered and little got a little close
[1:00:29] best thing to say
[1:00:31] brother let's pray boy you talking about
[1:00:37] but you know what that's using the Word
[1:00:39] of God as a shield and you know what
[1:00:43] God's not over I going hey shouldn't
[1:00:45] have done that
[1:00:45] no gods over going that's what I put it
[1:00:50] there for I put it there for you to use
[1:00:52] it power of prayer amen
[1:00:57] so in this sanctified life that we're
[1:00:59] talking about though like you said it's
[1:01:01] not whether it's not what other I I'm
[1:01:05] going to heaven or not I'm sealed
[1:01:10] I'm sealed in you know what God may have
[1:01:15] to do us like brother Ramsay
[1:01:17] if we keep misbehaving he'll just
[1:01:20] shorten our life amen that's just the
[1:01:23] truth about it but you know what he's
[1:01:25] doing he's saving your soul he saved
[1:01:30] your soul amen
[1:01:32] your soul saved but he won't let you do
[1:01:35] anything because you are truly a dual
[1:01:37] person that's just any way on say it
[1:01:40] you're a dual person you have the Holy
[1:01:44] Ghost
[1:01:44] you're a Holy Ghost filled person you're
[1:01:46] perfect never had a bad fountain day you
[1:01:49] life but you still living this person
[1:01:52] that you're looking at me that just had
[1:01:53] a bad talk all right so that's where we
[1:01:58] live because we go back to that old
[1:02:00] Adamic nature that we were born under
[1:02:02] cuz we can go back to my say up mom and
[1:02:04] daddy grandma and grandpa remember what
[1:02:06] brother Brown said he said that after
[1:02:07] left the epileptic child came from
[1:02:10] great-great-grandparents how the world
[1:02:16] there's schools that teaches you about
[1:02:18] epilepsy and all these things that go on
[1:02:20] and the prophet of God said it came from
[1:02:22] a mixed gene too you know two
[1:02:24] generations ago see that was God telling
[1:02:27] him to say that to tell you that see how
[1:02:30] he's watching over all this amen he's
[1:02:33] watching over us listen he knows
[1:02:36] gonna make it who's not he absolutely
[1:02:39] known you before the foundation world
[1:02:41] but you know what he didn't do it say if
[1:02:43] I'm not gonna make it to change he's not
[1:02:46] gonna he's not standing there going
[1:02:47] ain't gonna make it there's only one
[1:02:51] person gonna tell you ain't gonna make
[1:02:52] it now Satan why would God be negative
[1:02:56] to his own children and why would God be
[1:03:00] negative now to this generation of
[1:03:02] people that's going to see the change
[1:03:05] that's going to see the end that's going
[1:03:07] to see it so sanctified life that God's
[1:03:12] going to be pleased to dwell in us all
[1:03:14] the time Church pleased to dwell in you
[1:03:18] sure in your soul you're just as eternal
[1:03:20] as God did because you are God now
[1:03:24] that's a good person that's why I said
[1:03:26] most people in this message or two or
[1:03:28] tunas cuz they make you a second person
[1:03:31] you're not a second person you are the
[1:03:34] person of God made manifest in a form
[1:03:38] called whatever your name is and then if
[1:03:40] you're born again if you're not then
[1:03:43] keep working toward it keep working
[1:03:46] toward it cause in sanctification like I
[1:03:48] said my psyche attack if it was drinking
[1:03:55] he's not gonna bring seven drunk Devils
[1:03:59] back with him he's gonna go over and
[1:04:01] talk to seven religious demon and say
[1:04:04] hey I need some help turning this guy
[1:04:07] cuz I couldn't it's obvious he likes to
[1:04:10] drink but now you don't want to know
[1:04:11] more because he's having another
[1:04:12] different desire so I'm just going to
[1:04:15] bring seven more devils and bring them
[1:04:16] in and you're gonna put him on the front
[1:04:18] row you'll put him on the front row
[1:04:22] you'll never sit here again with you and
[1:04:25] play them on the front row and call him
[1:04:28] a Christian amen
[1:04:31] that's why I said I'm telling you the
[1:04:33] sanctified life is good but if you stay
[1:04:35] there it's the worst condition you can
[1:04:37] be in cuz Satan will say you're fine you
[1:04:42] just got to sit there and endure a
[1:04:43] couple of hours of sermon and then go
[1:04:46] home and then do what you want it
[1:04:49] but not in this sanctified life when you
[1:04:52] take these people right here man they
[1:04:55] were giving their life for the gospel
[1:04:56] that's the same thing with me and you
[1:04:59] cleaned and set aside for service right
[1:05:03] when we received the new birth we were
[1:05:06] put in service all right so let's move
[1:05:09] that out of the way we're already in
[1:05:11] service for God when we have the new
[1:05:12] birth in our soul were already where God
[1:05:14] wanted us to be to begin with now what
[1:05:19] does he want to do he wants that full
[1:05:20] fellowship to come back by what by the
[1:05:24] word washing of water by the word
[1:05:29] pouring the water in property God there
[1:05:32] was a box sitting right here it was a
[1:05:35] box the Prophet are the messenger of the
[1:05:38] hour he said I just read there was
[1:05:40] pouring water in the box the trash was
[1:05:43] running out and running down and she
[1:05:44] said she said it was running past her
[1:05:47] feet that was getting rid of the extra
[1:05:49] stuff like right now come on people if
[1:05:56] we if all we needed was just to be born
[1:05:58] again why don't we have to get up and
[1:06:00] get ready drive an hour drive two hours
[1:06:05] why did we have to do this if we were
[1:06:08] born again I mean you're you brought hey
[1:06:10] listen you Brody turn alive with you
[1:06:12] this point right you brought it up but
[1:06:15] why did then why did you what the effort
[1:06:17] why the effort why because the desire
[1:06:21] inside of you to know more there's a
[1:06:23] desire inside of you because that red
[1:06:25] hole even when that red horse rider was
[1:06:28] riding and he was doing his killing I
[1:06:31] want God to ride through my life and
[1:06:34] kill what's in my life not just bury it
[1:06:38] I want his head chopped off I want to be
[1:06:41] able to see it they have bad people they
[1:06:43] come back to life I'm gonna come back to
[1:06:45] life but haven't come back out I want to
[1:06:47] see the thing dead right here because
[1:06:51] without this we're not gonna take a body
[1:06:52] change when we still have these doubts
[1:06:54] of who we are brother Branham says what
[1:06:58] will know what who we are and what we're
[1:07:01] doing here
[1:07:03] so we have Satan's answer the problem is
[1:07:07] is we don't give him the answer right
[1:07:13] that's why I like sitting in a church
[1:07:16] where that that we take the major
[1:07:18] doctrines when we take these things huh
[1:07:19] you go talk to people and they're like
[1:07:21] oh I don't know what my pastor believed
[1:07:22] what do you mean you don't know what
[1:07:24] your pastor bleep you better sit him
[1:07:27] down and ask him
[1:07:29] your souls involved in this because the
[1:07:32] prophet of God said you won't go no
[1:07:34] higher than your pastor goes I didn't
[1:07:37] say that he did because how could Peter
[1:07:40] how in the world could Peter the day
[1:07:44] before Jesus was crucified he said I'll
[1:07:48] never forsake you like what Dave was
[1:07:51] telling this morning I'll never forsake
[1:07:53] you jesus said Peter in other words he
[1:07:57] probably just sniggered and since in
[1:08:01] less than 12 hours you'll deny me three
[1:08:03] times and you think Peter well if they'd
[1:08:07] be me or you I'd be mad at Jesus what do
[1:08:11] you mean yeah we'll ask that shows who
[1:08:13] the are Peter up there right but Peter
[1:08:19] was chosen to tell us what we needed
[1:08:24] because he had them and then Paul gave
[1:08:31] us the whole scene of what happens when
[1:08:34] we give them you when you receive this
[1:08:38] you get a schoolmaster that's why I
[1:08:39] don't understand people think we get
[1:08:41] sure we got everything we need but why
[1:08:43] do we need the Bible in Glacius that we
[1:08:45] need tutors and governors we need
[1:08:47] teachers we need people to teach us to
[1:08:51] bring us out why would we need that for
[1:08:54] that spirit guy
[1:08:58] we don't need it for Seoul remember your
[1:09:03] sole signed sealed and delivered you can
[1:09:06] be blown up in a nuclear explosion and
[1:09:08] they couldn't find one molecule of your
[1:09:10] physical body but your sole standing in
[1:09:13] that six dimension just as solid is that
[1:09:15] right there and never never will it go
[1:09:19] back into a sinful body again you hear
[1:09:21] what I said never go into a sinful body
[1:09:23] again because the next thing it touches
[1:09:26] this going into a glorified body a man
[1:09:31] that all right so the sanctification
[1:09:34] we're talking about it's not just
[1:09:38] cleaned and set aside for service
[1:09:40] waiting on God to come and fill me up
[1:09:43] he's already filled you up in this part
[1:09:45] that we're talking about but what he's
[1:09:48] waiting on he's waiting on cleaned and
[1:09:50] set aside he has the same jar it's full
[1:09:53] of the Holy Ghost but he wants to put
[1:09:55] you in more service he wants more
[1:09:58] fellowship he wants more of his self to
[1:10:02] show through you amen
[1:10:04] and but that red horse rider what was
[1:10:07] his remember we got contrast remember in
[1:10:11] the first church age we had the contrast
[1:10:12] we had a white righteous church on the
[1:10:15] earth through Peter Paul James and
[1:10:19] although that was a white righteous
[1:10:20] church bringing the correct doctrine but
[1:10:22] there was a white horse attached itself
[1:10:24] to that that was false and he just kept
[1:10:28] teaching false and kept teaching false
[1:10:29] and kept teaching false until finally he
[1:10:32] got to a place to where what he said
[1:10:34] well I can't join them I'll just kill
[1:10:36] him and that's what he did but he
[1:10:41] couldn't physically kill him all off see
[1:10:44] Satan smart enough to know he does read
[1:10:47] the Bible worthy and I don't think he
[1:10:49] believes it but he says there's a people
[1:10:51] on the earth that's gonna believe in
[1:10:54] this God named Jesus guy you know a hey
[1:10:57] there on the earth here somewhere and
[1:10:58] I'm gonna try in other words he couldn't
[1:11:00] just destroy all 7 billion people he
[1:11:04] said I'll get in their church
[1:11:08] I'll get in there school I'll get in
[1:11:12] there textbook
[1:11:13] I'll get in there Bible and I'll teach
[1:11:17] them a doctrine that's not even in the
[1:11:18] Bible the Bible says that the devil's
[1:11:22] believe in one God and tremble and them
[1:11:26] same devils teach you a trinity not you
[1:11:28] but why look 9 times in the world 99% of
[1:11:34] the world believes that there's three
[1:11:36] gods or a Trinity doctrine so they must
[1:11:41] be right it's 99 vs. 1 no give me one
[1:11:50] remember God and do better with 10% that
[1:11:53] we can do with 90 all right so let's
[1:11:57] refuse just review just a second and
[1:12:01] let's look what God is doing let's go
[1:12:03] through Daniel 9:24 let's go to that one
[1:12:06] and then we'll because remember going
[1:12:14] through this seal we're also going
[1:12:16] through the six seals or the redemption
[1:12:20] for us and then the 6 fold purpose is
[1:12:25] the redemption of Israel right 6 full
[1:12:29] purpose is the redemption of Israel
[1:12:30] after we're gone because you don't make
[1:12:34] an end of sin until after we're gone you
[1:12:35] don't make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:12:37] because they're over they don't have the
[1:12:39] holy go Holy Ghost is only to the
[1:12:42] Gentile dispensation right now sure
[1:12:44] there is one or two let me be clear with
[1:12:46] this there's one or two Israelites that
[1:12:49] may be bribed but God promised that's
[1:12:54] telling the guy the other day God
[1:12:55] promised in the Bible can't take it out
[1:12:57] that they'd be 144,000 12,000 out of 12
[1:13:02] tribes
[1:13:03] plus 2 prophets and that's it no more
[1:13:06] that's all God promised though that he
[1:13:09] would take that trip those tribes and
[1:13:10] bring them out what give them the Holy
[1:13:12] Ghost after we leave now look God won't
[1:13:16] dwell in Israel now as the people
[1:13:22] because they're unclean God won't go on
[1:13:26] an unclean vessel right just like he
[1:13:28] won't dwell in your unclean vessel all
[1:13:30] right but Daniel 9:24 does away with all
[1:13:34] that seventy weeks are determined upon
[1:13:38] thy people and upon thy holy city to do
[1:13:40] six things finish the transgression look
[1:13:44] watch this finish make an end of sin and
[1:13:48] reconcile iniquity he's cleaning him up
[1:13:53] just like he cleans you up he's cleaning
[1:13:56] them up same way through justification
[1:13:58] sanctification a baptism of the Holy go
[1:14:01] amen then he what brings in everlasting
[1:14:05] righteousness seal up the vision and
[1:14:07] prophecy and anoint the most holy
[1:14:10] we know what those are because we've
[1:14:11] studied them but that's the sixth full
[1:14:13] purpose but what's the second one finish
[1:14:16] the transgression we covered in on the
[1:14:18] first seal second seal make an end of
[1:14:20] sins now watch when did that happen when
[1:14:25] did they do their most horrible sin but
[1:14:30] remember only a small group of people
[1:14:34] said this but it affected a whole nation
[1:14:37] right okay listen now number two write
[1:14:43] that down Gabriel this is six full
[1:14:44] purpose number two write this down on
[1:14:47] your paper we could stay a long time ago
[1:14:49] the next quote please number three okay
[1:14:55] now number two write that down on your
[1:14:56] paper we can stay a long time on that
[1:14:58] but I don't want to go to preaching I
[1:14:59] just want to talk to you so you can get
[1:15:01] it closed when we get into these seven
[1:15:03] seals now watching puts it to get to
[1:15:04] together when we get into these seven
[1:15:07] seals then we'll just move right through
[1:15:08] the church through the seals through the
[1:15:12] plagues and know where we're standing
[1:15:14] all right number two make an end of sins
[1:15:17] now let's read again Daniel to finish
[1:15:19] the transgression and make an end of
[1:15:21] sins that's his second purpose of coming
[1:15:23] first it's to finish
[1:15:25] Israel's transgression what chopped off
[1:15:28] their past sins
[1:15:29] wanting to go together what
[1:15:33] we scroll it up please wait a minute
[1:15:38] up to us this is up scroll up I know
[1:15:43] it's down but well no no no no go back
[1:15:49] now it's writing that back there
[1:15:51] a little bit further down right there
[1:15:56] when we get these seven seals then we'll
[1:15:58] just move right through the church to
[1:15:59] the seals through the plagues and know
[1:16:00] where we're standing
[1:16:03] but it but he didn't know what he's
[1:16:05] talking about and am saying week that's
[1:16:08] what people say I think he was
[1:16:10] absolutely perfect in what he was
[1:16:11] preaching number two make an end of sins
[1:16:13] now this number two is what we're
[1:16:15] talking about here the second horse
[1:16:16] rider because sanctification is bringing
[1:16:21] us to what Redemption
[1:16:22] so whatever brings us to Redemption has
[1:16:25] got to bring them to Redemption our God
[1:16:27] changed his mind all right to make an
[1:16:30] end of sins now let's read again Daniel
[1:16:32] finish the transgression to make them in
[1:16:33] the sins that's his second purpose of
[1:16:36] coming first is to finish Israel's
[1:16:38] transgression and to make an end of sin
[1:16:40] where did Israel sin where did they do
[1:16:43] their vile sin where did they separate
[1:16:45] their self from God now listen close
[1:16:48] let's turn to st. Matthew 24 here's
[1:16:50] where Israel made her fatal mistake
[1:16:51] here's where she'd done her last sin so
[1:16:55] it must have been a big one and God
[1:16:59] didn't forgive them until we get out of
[1:17:00] here all right watch Matthew 27 he means
[1:17:05] not Matthew 24 and that's the reason
[1:17:07] she's in the condition today Matthew the
[1:17:09] 27th chapter of the 25th verse of the
[1:17:11] 27th chapter let's begin with the 21st
[1:17:13] verse the governor answered and said
[1:17:15] unto them whether the Twain will ye that
[1:17:17] I release unto you and they said
[1:17:18] Barabbas now remember that's Israel
[1:17:20] Barabbas Pilate said unto them what
[1:17:22] shall I do with Jesus which is called
[1:17:23] Christ listen to them they all said unto
[1:17:26] Him let him be crucified now remember
[1:17:29] that's their Messiah that Daniel said
[1:17:31] would come you remember this morning the
[1:17:33] lesson he'll be cut off not for himself
[1:17:35] not nothing he did they didn't be
[1:17:38] crucified and the government said why
[1:17:39] what evil has he done but they cried out
[1:17:42] to more saying let him be crucified
[1:17:44] hey listen why was he crucified because
[1:17:46] of them no he's crucified cause of me
[1:17:49] he was crucified because of me I don't
[1:17:51] know about them I don't know about you
[1:17:52] he's crucified because of me because my
[1:17:54] sins is what he put on the cross that's
[1:17:56] what I have to believe he put my sins
[1:17:58] away I can't talk about yours he did
[1:18:00] mine then Pilate saw that he could
[1:18:02] prevail nothing but rather a tumult was
[1:18:04] made and he took water and washed his
[1:18:06] hands before the monsters he thought he
[1:18:07] was gonna wash his hands by the water
[1:18:09] the word being how the word he was
[1:18:11] fixing to kill the word
[1:18:12] I am innocent of the blood of this just
[1:18:14] man listen here's their mistake
[1:18:17] here's their sin then answered the
[1:18:19] people said his blood read beyond us and
[1:18:23] our children on us would have been fine
[1:18:28] and it would have been over with but
[1:18:29] when they said and our children that's
[1:18:32] perpetual generation for 2,000 years God
[1:18:35] has not dealt with Israel because of
[1:18:37] that right there but watch that's where
[1:18:41] they done it he was making an end of sin
[1:18:43] for them how could he do anything else
[1:18:47] but forgive them knowing that he had to
[1:18:49] blind their eyes that we could come in
[1:18:52] amen it's like his own children calling
[1:18:55] for his blood and they were blinded he
[1:18:58] knowed they were blinded that's the
[1:19:00] reason he cried for forgiveness with
[1:19:01] them Father forgive me Father but they
[1:19:03] don't know what they're doing they were
[1:19:04] blind for our sake they were made blind
[1:19:07] in their unbelief they did this what
[1:19:10] they didn't believe there's Messiah and
[1:19:12] you know what you didn't either until
[1:19:16] you're born again who can call Jesus the
[1:19:19] Christ except by the Holy go amen but
[1:19:22] when they see him again they men what
[1:19:24] are they going to see him through two
[1:19:25] prophets in Israel right they're gonna
[1:19:28] see that they gonna see this that six
[1:19:30] full purpose is going to come right
[1:19:32] through the first three is going to come
[1:19:33] right through that three and a half your
[1:19:34] message is about all right confuse you
[1:19:38] the three-and-a-half-year message of the
[1:19:40] two prophets as to what save Israel give
[1:19:43] them the Holy Ghost through the
[1:19:45] preaching of two prophets that's what
[1:19:47] we're talking about right here because
[1:19:49] you got to make an end of that end of
[1:19:51] forgiveness for end of he's cut not same
[1:19:55] way staying with you listen when he
[1:19:59] forgive you your sins he don't ever
[1:20:00] bring them up in the moment he can't
[1:20:02] bring Israel's up either the only
[1:20:04] problem is here's the problem
[1:20:06] Israel was married to God in the Old
[1:20:10] Testament first bride she went whoring
[1:20:13] so he can't take her back as a wife go
[1:20:17] see if my wife goes and commits adultery
[1:20:19] and comes back I didn't forgive her but
[1:20:21] I'm not supposed to I'm not supposed to
[1:20:22] marry her she's defiled right I'm
[1:20:26] supposed to divorce her and put her away
[1:20:27] and I'm marrying in that's what that's
[1:20:29] what God did
[1:20:31] but that but that she can't be restored
[1:20:34] back to my wife not supposed to be
[1:20:36] anyway
[1:20:37] okay according to the Bible so that's
[1:20:39] what Jesus Jesus couldn't bring Israel
[1:20:41] back in now she he brings them back in
[1:20:43] under the 144,000 and under the two
[1:20:46] witnesses and under the servants but not
[1:20:51] his bride this is not bride but this is
[1:20:55] the called out of Israel that's going to
[1:20:57] get their sins forgiven their iniquity
[1:20:59] done away with and all those great
[1:21:01] things put an end to sin what is sin
[1:21:03] unbelief they did not believe that that
[1:21:07] was a messiah they could not see him as
[1:21:09] the Messiah yet he don't ever sign the
[1:21:11] Messiah was supposed to do but they
[1:21:13] could not see it they were blind
[1:21:17] he made an end of their sinned sin is
[1:21:21] what unbelief not smoking drinking
[1:21:23] cussing and all those things but they
[1:21:25] didn't believe he was a messiah
[1:21:26] so they put him to death what they
[1:21:29] killed him and they counted his blood
[1:21:32] not worthy listen folks those people
[1:21:37] even conflicts of the great religious
[1:21:40] leaders of the day sure they're standing
[1:21:42] there watching the crucifixion they just
[1:21:44] see Amanda they just see Amanda I
[1:21:48] stopped them aside to them that's just a
[1:21:51] man they were ready to get rid of ya he
[1:21:54] run his mouth too much he was against me
[1:21:57] and my religion and the religion of the
[1:22:01] day they didn't know that was gone even
[1:22:07] though he said Father forgive them for
[1:22:08] they don't know what they're doing
[1:22:10] whoever that was in that crowd shouted
[1:22:13] that day I said let his blood be on us
[1:22:15] and our children that's what brother
[1:22:18] Brown said that's where they made their
[1:22:19] fatal mistake that red horse rider rode
[1:22:23] right through that crowd red is blood
[1:22:27] but now remember red is blood but
[1:22:30] remember we we read and we may have time
[1:22:33] to read one more that what happened
[1:22:38] red also as the red heifer which means
[1:22:41] Redemption
[1:22:42] because remember be redeemed this to be
[1:22:45] brought back right how can you be
[1:22:47] brought back if you've got all these
[1:22:49] little trashy things you can't have
[1:22:52] little trashy things and be brought all
[1:22:54] the way back you'll be brought back to a
[1:22:56] certain place hey listen you know what
[1:22:58] you can do you close your thing you can
[1:23:02] go to right here you can go right here
[1:23:07] you choose how far up you go you choose
[1:23:10] how much water you want you choose how
[1:23:13] much words you want
[1:23:15] that's why Satan said I'm gonna get on a
[1:23:17] red horse and I'm gonna ride through the
[1:23:21] longest age and I'm gonna say I'm the
[1:23:26] most powerful Christian organization
[1:23:28] there ever was
[1:23:29] amen but I'm gonna kill all them other
[1:23:33] people them 68 million I'm gonna kill
[1:23:36] them and I'm not gonna kill them just
[1:23:39] because they're Jews Gentiles Greeks I'm
[1:23:41] gonna kill them cuz they don't agree
[1:23:43] with me they don't agree with my
[1:23:47] doctrine so I'm gonna kill him
[1:23:48] so that's exactly what happened when
[1:23:51] Satan got off of that white horse he got
[1:23:53] on that red horse and he said hey if I
[1:23:55] can't join them I'm gonna kill him hey
[1:23:59] man I'm gonna kill him I'm going to
[1:24:01] physically kill him and then while I'm
[1:24:04] physically killing them I'm still gonna
[1:24:06] attach myself to that church and I'm
[1:24:09] gonna spiritually kill him and I'm gonna
[1:24:11] kill them all through that 15 hundred
[1:24:13] years and you know what when they come
[1:24:15] out even under luther and wesley even
[1:24:18] when they come out i'm still gonna be
[1:24:19] riding i'm still gonna be killing them
[1:24:22] with my doctrine amen
[1:24:24] cuz he was giving a what he was given a
[1:24:26] sword a short is a word i all he's got
[1:24:29] to do is look all satan's got to do the
[1:24:32] difference in god's word satan's word is
[1:24:34] one word the difference in Satan's word
[1:24:39] and God's Word is one word off that's
[1:24:42] how close it is amen that's how close
[1:24:46] we're coming with these seals I mean wow
[1:24:49] let's care for one more and then one
[1:24:51] stop that all right we've been going
[1:24:54] just an hour
[1:24:55] but in numbers we talk about the red
[1:24:57] heifer now really glad that that that
[1:25:00] brother brought that out let's go to
[1:25:02] number Punk number four we know about
[1:25:05] the red heifer so let's skip a little
[1:25:06] bit but I want you to watch how God did
[1:25:10] something and that brother did a real
[1:25:13] good job with Rahab amen
[1:25:18] did a real good job preaching on Rahab
[1:25:20] no ma'am
[1:25:21] hey listen let me let me just be plain
[1:25:27] she needed a real work of sanctification
[1:25:32] physically she was totally unclean think
[1:25:36] of the men she had in that City
[1:25:38] she was totally unclean according to
[1:25:42] man's ideas
[1:25:43] according to her carne our flesh hey man
[1:25:47] that's what your brother was bringing
[1:25:48] now according to her flesh no hope no
[1:25:52] hope same way with me and you know hope
[1:25:56] I was just pure as I could be your mind
[1:26:00] was black your soul was black yeah Amen
[1:26:05] I watch oh if you know this red heifer
[1:26:07] notice being female coming to church so
[1:26:10] where's redemption going to come to not
[1:26:12] the church nominal but the bride
[1:26:15] redemption will only come through the
[1:26:17] bride of Jesus Christ and then read the
[1:26:20] color couldn't be spotted now had to be
[1:26:23] a solid color see that's what the
[1:26:25] problem with today now in the
[1:26:27] denominational world you can't come to
[1:26:30] full sanctification like God wants you
[1:26:32] to because you're spotted Trinitarian
[1:26:35] doctrine father son holy go eternal hell
[1:26:39] all these different things there's spots
[1:26:42] brother the Bible remember talks about
[1:26:44] spots in your feast but this has to be a
[1:26:47] solid color red red always gives us
[1:26:51] signifies redemption you say red always
[1:26:53] signifies danger it does to us in a red
[1:26:55] light but it's always redemption to
[1:26:57] don't run it so red has always been the
[1:27:01] sign through the Bible so look at Satan
[1:27:04] is going starting his ride he thinks
[1:27:05] he's going to kill these people
[1:27:07] you know what God's saying I'm
[1:27:09] sanctify people I'm gonna make them so
[1:27:11] sanctified because they're gonna be
[1:27:14] clean and I'm gonna put them in service
[1:27:16] like never before
[1:27:17] I'm talking about us because the seals
[1:27:20] are us the second seal didn't open in
[1:27:22] this church aid but it is a parallel or
[1:27:24] a type ii still didn't openings in the
[1:27:30] four churches right physically open like
[1:27:34] that no no it's in symbol form it's a
[1:27:36] symbol but now we look back and we see
[1:27:39] it but it's always redemption to don't
[1:27:42] run it so red has always been assigned
[1:27:43] through the bible the harlot Rahab let
[1:27:46] the spies down to a scarlet cloth or
[1:27:48] scarlet cord which was a sign that God
[1:27:51] left her house standing the story of
[1:27:56] Rahab the story of Rahab is an
[1:28:00] impossible story to follow if you don't
[1:28:03] understand in sanctification Amen
[1:28:09] sanctification is clean and set aside
[1:28:11] for service right cleaned and set aside
[1:28:14] for service how can God clean me I've
[1:28:18] never asked God how can he clean me up I
[1:28:21] know how he can clean me up word listen
[1:28:26] to the word I know how he can do that
[1:28:29] but listen before let's close on that
[1:28:32] before we go I told the brother in the
[1:28:37] study there I said have you ever thought
[1:28:39] of this and when Rahab let those guys
[1:28:45] down and there was that red rope hanging
[1:28:47] think about this that city was so big
[1:28:51] until they said you could run chariot
[1:28:53] races around the top of the wall so
[1:28:58] think about how wide that wall would
[1:29:00] have to be at least from that door to
[1:29:03] that door for even maybe three chariots
[1:29:05] to run a race around it and the city the
[1:29:08] the city residents were built against
[1:29:11] the wall
[1:29:14] amen all right so after all this is left
[1:29:22] that the children of Israel look out and
[1:29:26] they see one little red cord hanging off
[1:29:31] of a piece of wall way out in the
[1:29:34] horizon think about it I saw what was
[1:29:37] left of that wall was Rahab's house and
[1:29:42] a red cord hanging down and I can think
[1:29:46] of that Israeli general listing that
[1:29:48] Israeli general salmone he sees Rahab
[1:29:54] different than any man he'd ever seen
[1:29:57] any woman he'd ever seen and she
[1:29:59] probably looked at him different from
[1:30:01] any man she had ever seen because oh she
[1:30:04] had been with a lot of men like that
[1:30:05] brother talking about but one day Rahab
[1:30:18] walks up to Salman and says Salman do
[1:30:22] you really want me do you really want me
[1:30:27] I'm not clean I'm not in condition to be
[1:30:32] your wife because I'm an unclean person
[1:30:36] can't do it
[1:30:39] you know what Salman said someone says
[1:30:43] all I see on the horizon it looks like a
[1:30:46] cross it looks like a cross in the
[1:30:51] horizon was something red hanging down
[1:30:53] from it that's all I see and he said by
[1:31:00] the way where are your accuser
[1:31:07] right she said they're all dead there
[1:31:13] are no witness he said I didn't see you
[1:31:18] do it remember Jesus the woman caught in
[1:31:24] the act of adultery they threw her down
[1:31:27] and said we caught her in the very act
[1:31:29] what do you say you know the story he
[1:31:33] gets rid of him
[1:31:35] he says Rahab where are your accusers
[1:31:39] right she looks around and she says I
[1:31:43] don't have any he said I didn't see you
[1:31:47] do it I didn't see you do it go and sin
[1:31:54] no more
[1:31:54] Salman said Rahab I didn't see you do
[1:31:57] those things
[1:31:58] bring me one man cuz everybody Jericho
[1:32:02] died everybody Jericho was dead her hold
[1:32:06] her sins were gone her old past was gone
[1:32:10] talk about sanctification oh my lord man
[1:32:14] she's standing that night yet nothing
[1:32:16] listen hold on a minute she definitely
[1:32:18] wasn't a virgin okay but she was
[1:32:22] forgiven for what she had done right
[1:32:24] amen
[1:32:29] is that okay but you and I were Rahab
[1:32:33] ourselves we prosecuted ourselves to the
[1:32:37] world whatever you want to name it you
[1:32:40] put your whole list down it doesn't
[1:32:42] matter if your list is this higher this
[1:32:44] high it says sin at the top amen
[1:32:48] but when you get finished and all your
[1:32:52] accusers are dead you do like Salman you
[1:32:55] walk out of that tent you go all I see
[1:32:59] is red I don't see your passion no more
[1:33:04] all I see is a red string hanging out of
[1:33:07] a building that saved a group of people
[1:33:11] so that God could save you
[1:33:13] hey man you know the Lord
[1:33:16] when we see a real act of sanctification
[1:33:19] that's it and God did the same thing to
[1:33:22] you he had to because how is he going to
[1:33:25] attach yourself to an unclean vessel
[1:33:27] he can't that's why you got to go
[1:33:31] through justification you can't be
[1:33:35] sanctified with your past sins still
[1:33:37] hanging on your understand is one day
[1:33:41] that's singing so you'll see what God's
[1:33:45] really done I have learned to trust in
[1:34:00] Jesus
[1:34:02] [Music]
[1:34:14] all that you've done through all that
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:19] there was a place she came to that God
[1:34:23] thought so much of that oneness through
[1:34:26] he brought a ladies to bring David out
[1:34:29] of
[1:34:30] [Music]

[1:34:43] believe it it's true
[1:34:46] [Applause]
[1:34:48] all
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:53] to depend upon his
[1:34:57] [Music]
[1:35:00] and this through it all more time to
[1:35:04] have a name all through
[1:35:09] I have learned to trust in Jesus
[1:35:16] to trust him
[1:35:20] little
[1:35:23] Oh
[1:35:26] I have learned
[1:35:29] to depend upon his and it's true
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:44] I've learned to trust in Jesus
[1:35:49] I've learned to trust in God he ever got
[1:35:58] up swore to give her peace
[1:36:01] you just remember he learned to depend
[1:36:05] upon his race for time
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:20] they said I have to trust in Jesus it's
[1:36:23] gone it's out of here
[1:36:28] God don't even remember it all through
[1:36:36] [Music]
