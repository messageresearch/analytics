anybody saying anyway I'll see sister Pam backer hey maybe she can make me that purse saying but I like to say I appreciate being here with you and the fellowship this afternoon it's just good being a how the Lord with us you know that's the main thing we come to serve and to worship Him I I'm just thankful for him and I like the song that brother Marty son Gaara living in the sunshine you know we're in a day that the sun's shining spiritual speaking we're in a day that we all look at til the world is dark and it's going to get darker and I think brother BAM said it's gonna get worse and worse until they tell the bride's took out you know and all these guys tribulations and so I'm looking from the bright side and the Word of God is so good to us in this hour I appreciate him that what he has done for me you know he allowed me to recognize one day I was a sinner Paul so Paul said he was cheap but Jesus come to save sinners and I'm starting to thankful he saved me and you know as I went along I come into the light of this word and even in time I'm just so thankful for it because it shines so bright and I think it was in song it marty was singing there we wonder why ribbon says you know and trying to do God's service without his will he says reason Ahab prospered and everything and had prophets and all he said he let their hearts to be to be hardened and that's why I lots of things taking place that people say why it's the difference in because the world's got to get hard to it but you know the bride she's got light to shine in a lot of the word is shining this hours and seven strengths the church ages down through the time we live in great time to live in and you know we can live as low as we want to and or as high as we want to what God has done to it and I'll just take just a few minutes okay but be alright and I thought you know my grandpa told me one time I was out with him in the woods he says Joe he says just don't look down he said it's more than looking just down where's jin-sang hung up in the mountains and he says look up he said because when you're looking down you can't see what's out there and he said just don't look out there he says look up he said these things down here he's things out turn these things up fire and I thought that's the way the Word of God is just don't look down where we had where we going what we see but use the Word of God is faith to pick us up and you talk about the stories in oh that's that's a good thing to go through ain't it to experience I think you know when I was a little kid my grandpa says you know we believe in God I didn't know what God was he trusts him airplane and I was thinking when I was a 5 year old boy you know how kids boys do they get out mama she worked and daddy has worked and I was all home by myself out of your own I was in the woods and come up a storm I says I'm gonna go out and get on her tree and watch it lightning I went out on a cedar tree and it was a lot in a thunder I said oh it makes me scared but it says trust in God that says oh my grandpa said I could trust in God so Isis got on there watching it lightning thunder says I'm trusting in God if I die I'm trusting in God if I live I'm trusting in God you know and I went through the storm and when I was got into teenagers I was in a service and we just going to go through a typhoon and we went into the typhoon and we stayed in a typhoon and we come out of typhoon I was 18 year old I thought oh I could die in here but the captain the ship he says it's made to go through the typhoons I said I hope he knows what he's talking about because I've never been here before you know that's the same way with us today we've never had this journey before but it's a bright day to just shine in and you just don't look down just don't look that way but look up because Jesus is here to come and get us and one of these days it's going to take place when we think not and we're gonna be gone ain't that a glorious

introduce these brothers if you don't know who they are by now you're in bad shape I don't never do it brother Tony come on hey ma'am do you love Jesus I always think about him and I was thinking about him this morning how God is so great but I bomb say he's so great that he reveals himself in the flesh you know so I look back about 30 years ago and I brought a friend you know in vitamin C brother Tony just I was like at Lake you know come on let's visit my church one day you know so that's okay I'll visit so I follow him to the church they used to have it in the classrooms so I said what kind of church is it few people here and there I used to be in Saint Peter's Cathedral really big huge sit at the back there then the preacher man step beyond the pulpit and he said today we're gonna study the hybrid religion so what's that hybrid religion you know I said back and this guy started preaching recently came here to minister for us and he baptized me the same day then he kept preaching by Jesus and the Spirit of God I'll go can became flesh and different things everything lined up with the scriptures and I begin to cry you know so eventually by the end of the service I gave my life to Jesus already and I never went back to the nomination and ever since the Lord began to reveal himself you know he doesn't do it one day he's gradually you know you get to know him more the more you know him the more you love him it's it took a while sometimes take really some time and every single day I was really very shy person so I got a message gabab ties I was a businessman and I was going to our crime from my city to a crime and then take the balls to Lagos and I was in a big you know long boss a lot packed a lot of people and a voice spoke to me stand up and tell people about Jesus that was the hardest thing in my life how can I do it then I look at the people here what's a lot I can do this then I feel something like pulling me up and I stood up and you know I shared the Lord Jesus Christ to the people a little bit and I said how again it wasn't easy and it happened again when I was in the college the professor didn't come so we were there everybody talking talking about girlfriends and pains the same voice came again this time in the class I stood up and so I didn't understand why the Lord is doing that to me then it took a long time for me to realize that he's the same yesterday today and forever and if you have him in your heart and if you are predestinated you don't matter where you are so I really want to thank the Lord this morning they'll all give me a little scripture in Romans chapter 9 and I felt like okay I'll share that Scripture Romine chapter 9 verses 29 and it says i said the lord of the sabbath has left us a seed we would have been like this Sodom so the scripture really strike me hard and I was thinking about Jesus he gave us Jesus and a seed the royal seed of Abraham there has kept all of us except that all of us would have been lost you know I look back and I say Lord how do you come to Africa all the way to get me so we thank the law for the message of the alwah it's true is vindicated I've seen it myself is God is in the message God is in its world and God is in his people we have to continue in the faith because the prophet of God said watch Russia watch Russia we said coming a lot of people don't watch these things but we see it coming we see the North Korea coming very close and it become like a bait to United State of America and North Korea is like a bait is a Russian bait and as soon as you will swallow it from that day things going to happen but I believe that a bride will be gone so we have to look up and see our Redemption Asya god bless you and our licensee Josephine to come and there was a song here that I love so much he said Jesus is the winner man and I want to sing it are the musicians who come before sister Josephine will come and she has a special too so Jesus is a winner man

pastures I missing the pasture we always try to rake it out on over to the homers Lions he he'd always winds it up but we just recognized the pasture part of each one you know but we do recognize churches you know as far as come to fellowship with us and if brother Wes if you'll come up and sing for us because brother Yancy they're down around where the ante is now with them and come on up and the only thing we tell them tell those the ones that are not pastors you don't get to preach you just think [Music] practice this song with the sisters but I kind of backed out on a little bit it's unfamiliar territory they've got to get used to that a little bit I guess so greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then we trust that God has been good to you amen he's always good seasoning man I was sitting there in my seat and I was thinking you know I see a lot of familiar faces and we don't get to see each other too often but you know the main thing is that we still see each other I mean as a lookout I'm so thankful for his saving power first but even greater his keeping power that we can look around and see each other here in this room amen and we're just so thankful to be counted among those Amen that have been called out amen he's gonna sing the chorus to set your wings amen [Music] Sancho - the winds up [Music] in a higher plane dude [Music] it's my grade [Music] whoa sent you - the winds are fake you can't play [Music] stop please oh joy to the winter do not struggle in our struggle it's fine set your way [Music] do not do that trouble [Music] [Applause] hey man I just I'm not gonna preach the Samuel but I am gonna give a testimony a man last night I felt like I should share this with you I was I was not able to move at all I was totally it seemed like I was paralyzed I mean my back was was completely seized up and I guess I through it somehow maybe on on Thursday and Friday it just was completely out and it just got progressively worse throughout the day and then last night I I couldn't heard leave and just make it to my bed and by the time I laid down I didn't want to get up and I couldn't get up and I was kind of grunting and groaning my family was looking at me and weren't sure on what level because I guess I do have a low pain tolerance or whatever you might want to call it so you know they were Amanda was sort of gauging me a little bit I'm happy to have Amanda with me and and we're also happy to have my daughter's male and Naomi and sister Rachel and sister Anna Andrews they're from the church as well and so next time we'll have to get them to sing but anyway I just I was just burdened over this and it had me very very concerned and you know without exaggerating truly I was in a lot of pain and I thought tomorrow was gonna be even worse you know in your flesh the Satan wants to get you thinking that way you know and so I just texted some of the brothers some of the Deacon brothers in our church and I said pray for me I'm in a lot of pain and I can't move and they just started replying this and now but I didn't see the last text come in and about 3:00 in the morning I had to use the restroom and I got up and I couldn't hardly move I was just I was just in so much pain and finally made it there and came back and could barely lay down but I got in the bed and then I didn't want to move after that and you know how it's been if any of you had back problems I guess but I don't really have those kind of problems helps you understand how other people are feeling sometimes when you go through something like that and that could have been what that was I don't know but I woke up this morning about 6:30 and I looked over and it was my phone was right there on the on the side table and I picked it up and I looked at it and it was a text my brother he said you'll be fine in the morning and put that phone down and when I got up I hadn't tried to get up yet but it it started to hurt and I just spoke those words I said I'll be fine in the morning and I stood on my feet and by the grace of God I'm sitting here in this seat tonight I could not move last night but I was completely totally healed 100% better this morning I'm so thankful for God's healing power and healing touch amen amen so we're just singing the song and I trust it'll be a blessing to you I once was lost but now I'm found I once was lost but now I'm found so far away but I'm home now I once was lost but now I fell and now my Lifesong seeds I once was blind but now I see I once was blind but now I see I

you can just preach the word and it's received and and and it's taken an apply to the life and that's what the words got to be done in this thin town and we know that Jesus Christ is the word and our attitude toward this word is our attitude toward Jesus Christ himself so if the words in us if the words in you in the words in me then we must treat each other like Jesus Christ amen as the body of Jesus Christ right we just certainly appreciate and the Lord for watching over you as this storm blew through and we're thinking about y'all and praying for y'all and we're from Mobile Alabama so we're have our share of storms come through there at different times but the Lord is always faithful because you know whether it's a literal storm like a hurricane or for it fits a storm in your life one thing where we have the assurance of is that Satan can do nothing except he get the nod from our Father he cannot give you a trial he cannot let the storms blow he cannot attack you without getting past your Savior amen we're so grateful an appreciate y'all again we just greet you for mobile and we just love the Lord there where's where we're studying the the message we believe the message with all our hearts and we know that it's only the message of this hour that's gonna get us out of here not the message of any other days a message of this hour because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen if you would we won't keep you standing for too long if you'd go with me to the book of st. John we read in two different places Saint John chapter 3 let's begin with Saint John chapter 5 524 just take a few minutes here he-man st. John 5:24 reads verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life and in st. John chapter three just one page over a cup of pages verse 3 jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Amen let's bow our heads and our hearts they're kind of gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful to you Lord for these moments that we can come and and Lord Dargis look in this family album Lord and reflect Lord and just see our reflection this word father Lord and we thank you for your truth we thank you for your word we thank you for your spirit that quick is it to our hearts we ask your blessings over each one Lord that made the sacrifice tour and the drive to come and be a part of us Lord and fellowship we thank you Lord God for all the songs that were sung Lord and all the testimonies Lord all the words of encouragement we just pray now Lord that you just settled our hearts Lord for these next few minutes so we look into your word speak to us and teach us father we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you're seated I'd like to title this this evening he that understandeth and it's very important as I heard one of the brothers expressed you know the you know how wonderful it is that God has sent a prophet and what a difference of the different ages and how people have their own ideas of what God was and they had their own imagination and they look into the word and they just scratched their heads about what the Bible is saying but God only has one interpretation to the word and he interprets his word I bringing it to pass so God sent an i and eagle that could fly above me and see things and to hear the voice of God the Bible teaches us that God's word comes to a prophet so it's important that we listen to what God's mouthpiece says but it's not enough we've come to a day where it's not enough it's not you can't we cannot hide behind God sent a prophet anymore it must take a personal relationship where you meet God himself where you literally because it's the Prophet gives us a very important key here the key that the Prophet gives us is that the word CE means to understand and it's important that as we go and as we express these things for a few minutes this evening as we look into these things to not get overwhelmed or to misunderstand the thought tonight it's not about intellectual conception it's not about learning upon learning because the Bible tells us that there's people that are always learning but never able to come to the truth because remember Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life so it's a very the word that we have is very dangerous to try and learn it an intellectual conception and then remain in the church non born-again that is a dangerous place to be in and we've come to an hour we've come to a point where it gets a razor's edge brother Dale amen it comes to a point where we've got to meet him because if you meet him then you can understand properly and then you can't understand the word we believe the word but belief has got to give way to understanding it must give way to understanding Jesus himself said verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again you've got to be born again before you can understand properly and there's multitudes of people that confess the truth that are not born again there's multitudes of people that confess that Jesus Christ rose from the dead but they themselves have never experienced it because the Bible says that no man can say that jesus is the christ but by the Holy Ghost no one here see the napkin that was on his head no one here seen the stone that was raised but every person with the Holy Ghost can testify that he rose from the dead because had he not risen from the dead you wouldn't have the Holy Ghost so if you have God's given you the born-again experience then you know he rose from the dead it's proof of his resurrection this message is proof of his resurrection it's proof that the church agent that the Dark Ages could not keep the truth bound anymore but there's been a rising of the Sun there's been a resurrection there was that Roman seal on there that kept that kept the truth hidden from man when they could even have their own Bible but there's been a resurrection and it's not enough to just believe there's been a resurrection of the ages got to be a resurrection in your own life and then lining up to this word will be like everyday living to you but as long as as we try and do something in our own strength we'll always mess up somewhere we'll always brother and call it find yourself wrecked up somewhere but you get to him first don't try and learn or understand the message without the Holy Ghost it's not possible that's why there's so many false doctrines get the Holy Ghost first meet him first get on them they're sacred that they're sacred grounds that the Prophet talked about meet the pillar of fire for yourself and then God the inside teacher will come to you right and then he'll do just like he said he'll lead you and guide you in all truth people get wrecked up because they handle the word without the Holy Ghost whether it's behind the pulpit whether it's their own life whether it's in their own home they'll find themselves with a cow on top of the tree and grass because when we went out when a believer becomes born again their baby in the Lord they're a baby they have that potential the same Holy Ghost that's in a born-again Christian that was just born again let's say five minutes ago is the same spirit that was in Christ it's the same spirit that was in the Prophet that's in that's in those that have been there have been a Christian for decades it's the same spirit but if that the potential is in you like a seed the raptures in you everything you have need up in this life's journey is in you at the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you've got to water it you've got to feed on the word you've got to grow into that statue of a perfect man but it's the Holy Ghost doing it if it's not the Holy Ghost doing it then how are we any different than than just denominations how are we any different than good works God didn't send the Holy Ghost to make you a better neighbor God didn't send the Holy Ghost to the Jew just so you don't drink it's just so you don't smoke he said the Holy Ghost for a resurrection so every born-again believer believes all the Word of God but you can't camp there there's God just like every born-again Christian should be able to look back and say I'm not what I should be today but I'm not what I was I know more of him I love him more because with understanding comes love you know when you have little ones and you try and explain things to them they can but they're they have to believe you because they don't understand why you tell them don't hang out with this type of people don't do this just trust me you'll know when you get older but trust me and they take your word for it because they love you and they believe you as your parent but there comes an age where they become mature and they start to think for themselves and say that's why mom and dad told me this now I'll understand that makes me love them even more before it may just seem like rules but afterwards you begin that love comes that love comes that with that perfect faith with that perfect understanding that comes a love you mean that God loved me so much he would actually let me see this in his word he would speak to me this is a family album if you look if your mom and dad said son daughter here's our family album looking to it and you looked into it and you seen mom and you seen dad and you seen Grandpa Joe when you seen aunt Susie but what if you didn't see herself in there you'd begin to think am i part of this family why is it that everybody's in there but I don't see me where's the picture of me so when we look in this word it's not enough to just see Jesus it's not enough to just see brother branham you see them but do you see yourself in the message do you see herself in the word then it becomes personal and only the Holy Ghost can show your your own picture where you can look you remember that little boy that was in the mirror when he was a country boy and he went to the city and he's seen a mirror and what he did that's what the reflection was and the little boy got a reflection and said mommy that's me and when we look into the word and we see and we see a Rahab or we see the widow woman that they entertained Elijah and all these things we should be able to look to our father and say Lord that's me that's me it takes the Holy Ghost to do that it's not enough to just say I believe the message I believe the word whatever it says I don't know what it says I don't understand what it says but I believe it that's fine to a certain point please don't misunderstand me that's great that's what believers should be told when they're born when they're starting out but there should be some growth somewhere you should be a better Christian today than what you are five years ago you should have more understanding you shouldn't know more about your father there's got to be some understanding and belief is there and the more you understand the more you believe Lord I don't know that part yet but I believe it and in your grace and in your time you're gonna leave me there because I have the insight teacher and thence I teach it will lead me and guide me in all truth so let's not misunderstand revelation for just knowledge because Eve lusted for knowledge if she would have waited for God timon God would have given the revelation to Adam and Adam could have preached it to Eve but Eve try to bypass Adam enlisted foreknowledge apart from revelation there's a big difference between knowledge and in Revelation brother Branham says I'm afraid today too many of us are not getting people to Christ think of that he said we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get into Christ he is the only one in the only one that has life he has he that has the son has life and I believe in this our God / we need to pray that God help us to keep us from indoctrination we need revelation there's a difference especially in this our saints whenever people can get indoctrinated and sit on the Pew and being indoctrinated and message believer and not have life and not have the resurrection power not be able to overcome but they know that God sent a prophet they can tell you the seven churches they can tell you all these different facts the message is more than stories there there's revelation behind them stories there's revelation behind them sentences there there there's life in there because the letter killeth but the Spirit gives life remember to bring a birth you need a seed in seed is not just a jar by itself it's not just the egg by itself this seed is a seed when it comes together so a person cannot be born again by just a letter you can't get born again by just a letter you need the Spirit to quicken the letter to you and then it becomes life when the Spirit gets in that letter and it quickly then it quickens you to eternal life and that's the only thing can bring life they've had the letter for 2,000 years and God sent the spirit and quickened the elect of every age behind that letter and it became real to them it became flesh and blood to them the word has got to become flesh it's got to this letter of the Bible is not gonna go up in the rapture and be translated but the Bible in you if it's in you that will be translated that will quicken you if the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you he goes on in the sermon beyond the camp brother Joe I'm sorry I got I got this after I gave you all the quotes but he says as I look and preach across the nation and watch the people I am fully persuaded that people are not getting to Christ prophet of God talking he said and I believe that it's the enemy that's throw this hindrance because the reason I believe is or he said I believe this he is not the object that they have been pointed to they have either been pointed to a dogma a doctrine or a party or experience or a sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to Christ alert as long as they may believe certain certain doctrines in there then they're just bless God you're a believer you're going in the rapture because you believe God sent a prophet no no no the bride believes God sent a prophet but the bride believes more than Jay what the Prophet said is flesh in you that's who's going in the rapture right he's got to be real he goes on he said that's why I think that people are resting their eternal destination upon some dogma or some sensation like some say I danced in the spirit I spoke with tongues I felt fire running over me and do you know all of those those things can be impersonated by the devil he says there's just one thing that he cannot impersonate - that's the word in a debate between he and Jesus each time Jesus defeated him it is written the word it's got to be the word it's got to be not like I said not learning upon learning this isn't intellectual discourse this is life it's got to be the the spirit has got to quick on that word in st. John 8:24 let's turn there real fast if you will eight st. John 8:24 I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if he believed not that I am he ye shall die in your sins think present Tansen let's drop down to verse 31 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if he continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free it takes more to be a disciple than just to believe that God sent a prophet or that Jesus came in flesh the true disciples were in the upper room the true disciples follow Jesus every step of the way every step of the way and found themselves in the upper room God did not sin unseal all these mysteries he had for 6,000 years unseal them just for head knowledge just to know something there's a purpose behind it because we have to do something that has never been done by a group of people Mary had to be had to believe something in brother Graham said it's never been done before she had to conceive in her womb as a virgin and God provided the word and the spirit he provided the seed both together so the bride the word is in the bride as it was in Mary she's got to do something that has only been being and type and shadow by individuals Elijah Titus he was translated but now as a group that we've got to be changed and then translated as a bride something's never been done before but the but we believe it as Mary did you know something like this would literally take months and months to preach so if the spirit reveals thinks to you that I might not be referring to just holding down y'all write them down go back and reread them and study them because this is just high points we just you know we're just trying to hit some high points so much can be said about this whenever Jesus refers to the parable the sower when he starts to break it down of what the meaning of that is whenever those that fell by the wayside Jesus broke that down and said those are they that hear the word but they don't understand it and before they can get understanding the enemies then birds go in that evil spirits going to may take that seed away because there's no understanding the understanding is not fruitful the Holy Ghost must quicken the word only and make it power and demonstration in our lives because remember Paul say the word came not aboard only but a power and demonstration you say well well well the the you know the dead aren't raised and the sick may not be miracle miraculously healed in every service that's not just that's not the only kind of power the kind of power is that while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard it that was power behind the words what if on the day of Pentecost whenever they were there staggering around like drunk me and they said you know what is this what if Peter would have said the Lord thy God is gonna build an ark and he's gonna float it down the LORD thy God is gonna drop a plague of fleas and he's gonna he's gonna destroy this place by fleas the Holy Ghost and I have quickened them but when he said this is that and he properly identified the word for the day then I only goes quick and those that heard the word a person can get the Holy Ghost you if your trust in the Lord for the Holy Ghost can get the Holy Ghost right or brother Dale one of these brothers are or any any minister while you listening to a tape while they heard of the word that power and demonstration can come and say that's for me that's how you can get healed that's how you can get delivered is when that spirit charges that word charges that letter and then it becomes life that's the work of the Spirit that's power and demonstration that's whenever when seeing the power sing gets broken off your life when the influence of the world gets broken off your life when that word it means something when that word whenever you hear your name calls that's the difference when it's your name then you don't care what your friends think you don't care what your mom and dad may think you hear your voice you hear his voice call your name rather in first Corinthians 8 want Paul says now as touching things offered into idols we know that we have not all had knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity love edifies now he didn't say revelation puffs without knowledge puffeth up because remember that grain of wheat the heavier that head gets the more boughs right as that wheat matures the green ones they stick straight up but as they mature in that grain that heavy grain brother Dale gets heavy full maturity in the presence of the son it against the bow humility there's nothing to be there's nothing to boast about our boasting is in him and him alone so true revelation brings the realization of love because paul also said though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries because remember the prophet taught us that Judas partook of the mysteries there was a certain level we could get to we've got so much truth and it's so plain in this hour people can come right up to the truth and they can see serpent seed they may be able to see Malachi 4:5 they can see it it's there in the Bible it's plain they can partake of some mysteries and still not be with it that is why I'm preaching to you this evening that you've got to meet him first meet him first don't you know and I think it's especially good for for people that are raised in the message and clear you know that's how I was raising the message and you raised up you know listen the Prophet it becomes a second nature you hear it in your home and and you hear you go to church every Sunday you you never smoked you never drank you never done them things but you're still a sinner you hear them things and becomes a second nature so you can find yourself if you're not careful you can find yourself being in a message church for years and years without the born-again experience because you can hear statements that say you know in brother Graham himself said hearing the word for your day that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost but there's so much more to qualify that there's so much more that you can't isolate that statement because remember the Bible says that the devil's believe in tremble remember in the Bible whenever whenever whenever them their mom the men over there in the book of Acts try to cast out Devils by Jesus whom Paul preaches they knew who Paul was and then then people that try to cast him out knew that Paul was a man of God but they didn't have that that power so revelation you should read the church age book what brother Graham said about revelation because when you desire revelation which every Christian should and does it's not the same like your it's not a lust for knowledge it's God's love letter to you every Christian if the raptures a revelation the born-again experience is a revelation your healing is a revelation everything is based on that revelation and that's what we must cry for the revelation the hunger for revelation is a deep crying to the deep and that deep is gonna respond so let's quickly move on think about whenever that when Peter said that day went on the day of Pentecost he said you know this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel you had the same you had people in the temple reading the letter of the word while Rome was surrounding them they were killed because they had the letter of the word but missed the manifestation of that brother branham did not come and preached from 47 to 65 just to take up just to fill our heads with facts he came to introduce him and have he not come and introduced him we could go nowhere we would just live our lives and just die like everyone else but it's connected the word and the translation is connected brother Ram says it takes a union to make a seed is that right doctor has to be you got a whole lot of pulp out here don't one didn't have no life and implanted it had never come up lay it there and rot lay there and right and you couldn't plant the life without having the pulp so you see the whole thing is a union I'm trying to tell you now about Christ and the church it's a union both collectively and individually you've got to be personally have a union I brother Lewis was saying you've got to have them in your house and the reason that he's in this building is because you're supposed to have brought him that's why when it when the church went one that when the licks of a fire gone it's just a shell so he goes on he says so you see the whole thing's a union I'm trying to now about Christ in the church there's a union see if the woman is the seed of herself then she doesn't need a male she can have the baby by herself have her baby herself but she can't be she can't have the baby until she's been with the male because it takes the two together to make a seed is that right it's not enough to just have the letter of the word brothers and sisters you got to have the word in the spirit if you want a birth if you want a new birth just like you couldn't come here the first time without both neither can you come here neither can you go up there and be born again without both the word and the the Pentecostals may have the spirit the anointing but they don't have a word they don't have it into Wales people can have them the word but I have the spirit to quicken to it and there's no life let's quickly go on to the next one and the Easter still he says it's the Holy Spirit coming down too quick and make alive those people that's for ordained of God to be in the rapture notice that is if he is a true eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true eagle now the little Eagle problem the barnyard was eating all right but he knowed he wasn't it wasn't just exactly right but then when he heard the truth then he received this truth John 5:24 rather Jesus said speaking this way he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the judgment but has passed from death unto life just think of how simple that is he that believeth now the correct way of saying that he that understandeth now you go out here on the street and say to this prostitute you believe sure you believe he's the son of God certainly been baptized sure go down to the drunker do you hear that hear the preacher preach yeah you believe that sure see but he that understandeth he that knoweth his place in this hour he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me present-tense eternal life shall not come into the judgment but it has already passed from death unto life so you can even put in there you believe you know you can go out on the street people knew brother Aaron personally you believe brother ends profit yeah sure you believe that woman that was in the wheelchair that she that you know no older man that you you seen that one raised it from the from the wheelchair sure do you believe us God sure but they not understand they not have a revelation of why God sent a prophet let's go to 2nd Peter about to bring it here to a landing like I said Saints just trying to hit some high points and encourage you to just seek out and and study and and just trust the Lord cuz he'll lead you and guide you if you don't have the Holy Ghost yet get the Holy Ghost first get born again because it's a promise don't attempt to try and understand and get revelation apart from the Holy Ghost in 2nd Peter 1:20 knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation brother Aaron quoted that Scripture a lot and when I hear that script you know I think well praise God that's true God it's not just one you know God's Word comes to the Prophet but then those that have an ear to hear will hear but I want us to notice and that's very true but I want us to notice what Scofield put here if you have a Scofield if you look at the margin reading it has a little H and it says its own interpretation for example not isolated from all that the word has given elsewhere that puts a whole new meaning on what the private interpretation is you cannot isolate it one single scripture it's got to run from Genesis to Revelation and back and forth you can't isolate one quote of the Prophet it's got to go from 47 to 65 back through Genesis all the way back to Revelation when we listen to the Prophet we should have our Bibles open it's like when God told Moses about weaving the curtain the veil it's in and out all them colors in and out that's how this words got to be that's how the revelations got to be in our hearts then we know where we stand and don't get don't don't get overwhelmed and say praise God I was born again last year and there's just so much it's not about learning you know you're born again today and he comes tomorrow you're going to the rapture he'll lead you and guide you in all truth he'll take care of that that's why I'm saying get born again first and then he'll take care of the rest and all the things you may not understand you believe it you believe it think of Shamgar and closing Shamgar believed Shamgar was an israelite he believed he was in the promised land he believed that God sent Moses God sent a prophet that God sent Joshua and placed him there and it was his inheritance be it the Philistines would still come every year and take his hard-earned work all of his food would take it from his family but one day Shamgar got a revelation so compared to when Shamgar only believed and he was right in his belief but when he got a revelation then he said wait a minute I'm Abraham see this is my inheritance then he got that off stocks gold and killed a thousand Philistines by himself that's the difference between revelation and just under intellectual just believing Satan can be bossing you around and pushing you around on your emotions and coming and taking your joy like to fill us things all the time but then one day you get a revelation and then you slay them evil spirits you slay that influence in your life you slay the influence and that's trying to wreck your family ask God for revelation because nothing is of such prevailing power eyes revelation on the word in Revelation is 229 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches every person that God creates if they're born normally has an ear has to but just a very few can hear what he says by his Spirit to the churches so whenever we read and and we and we hear and we and we see that we remember see think about many times brother would preach II go see see see means to understand one less quote in perfect faith talking about Jesus he had faith with his power how did he he said I can do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was he relied and knowing that he was the word he had faith in God who made him the word he was the word he was God the word and they was in him and that give him faith because he understood his position he knows what he was because the scripture had said he was this and here every scripture taught him to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that they can't we rely upon what God made us as believers Jesus himself had to understand the scripture he was the word and by God's help we'll get into tomorrow but Jesus had to look into the word and find what was written about him and when he found that nothing could stand in his way in the bride I believe by God's grace the elect the bride is beginning to and has but God is beginning to show her her place in the scripture and then she can sit there and when she realizes that and by revelation how many of us have heard the tape same tape over and over and over how many of us have heard one of one of the minister brothers preach the same thing but one day it strikes is different God's given you a revelation reach out and grab it because it belongs to you don't be like that servant that had that gold that deity and buried his talent under the earth invest it take what God is giving and share it with others invest that revelation invest that deity live for others and that's eternal life they may accomplish your Saints pray that the Lord has spoken to your hearts in some way this evening and just just there's so much more that could have been said there's so much more that brother round taught on studying and on understanding and like I said Saints please don't let it overwhelm you don't misunderstand that has got to be some Oh goodness I've got two there's people that could have PhDs in this message and just be as void of the Spirit of God as ever and there can be people that are that are chock full of the Spirit freshly born again and gotten and they may not know very much but do you know what one can be led one can be taught true revelation the other ones just head knowledge head knowledge is in the tribulation period revelation is bound for the rapture hey man god bless y'all tonight there's just bow our heads and I'll turn the server's back to brother Dale do you most gracious Heavenly Father Lord God in
