[6:18] amen
[6:20] revelations
[6:24] 1.
[6:26] we've been reading this scripture and
[6:27] one of these days we'll get over far
[6:29] enough you'll see why i've been reading
[6:31] revelations
[6:32] 1. says the revelation of jesus christ
[6:36] which god gave unto him
[6:38] to show unto his servants things which
[6:40] must shortly come to pass
[6:42] and he said and signified it by his
[6:43] angel and to his servant john
[6:46] and by record of the word of god and of
[6:47] the testimony of jesus christ and of all
[6:50] things that he saw
[6:52] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[6:54] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[6:56] those things which are written therein
[6:59] for the time is at hand so one of these
[7:02] days we'll get over there i think it's
[7:04] about 21 or 22
[7:06] he comes back to that and says the time
[7:08] is at hand right so we appreciate that
[7:11] okay revelations eight
[7:14] one and when he had opened the seventh
[7:16] seal there were silence in heaven
[7:19] about the space of half an hour you may
[7:21] be seated lord that is blessing to the
[7:24] reading of the word
[7:27] now
[7:28] we have been
[7:30] quite a while on this and just
[7:33] getting everything down and
[7:35] you will understand maybe a little later
[7:37] on when we
[7:39] we we try to get on over pisces chapter
[7:42] 10
[7:43] because we really got up to
[7:45] the reading eight one but we're over
[7:46] basically in chapter 10
[7:49] in our studies in the book of
[7:50] revelations
[7:52] and
[7:52] you know after this part that we get
[7:54] through with this
[7:56] dealing with the
[7:58] uh
[7:59] the 11 12 13 14 i don't know how much
[8:02] we'll put into each one
[8:04] uh as understanding
[8:06] but i want you to think about it and i
[8:08] wish you would go back and read the book
[8:10] of daniel
[8:12] and and read that and then and think of
[8:15] that in relation to what
[8:18] uh we will try to be covering because to
[8:20] me the book of daniel is
[8:23] uh it's
[8:24] not many different visions now i know he
[8:27] had him covered over a period of time
[8:29] like john was writing two years on
[8:31] patmos you know
[8:32] it only took him two days to write the
[8:35] whole book you know if he was just
[8:37] sitting down writing but he was two
[8:38] years and getting it and writing it down
[8:41] and see the book of daniel the end of me
[8:43] i've always loved it because
[8:46] it's a continuation of opening
[8:48] up of things to show you
[8:52] after the prophet has brought us the
[8:54] understanding
[8:55] showing us the end times showing us the
[8:58] journey of life and things in the book
[9:00] of daniel and it's a wonderful story but
[9:03] it just to me it's like you see this and
[9:05] then you see more and then you see more
[9:07] and then you see more
[9:09] and it's all one vision then one
[9:12] uh thing that's or transpiring one uh
[9:16] whatever you want to call it
[9:18] uh scenes or whatever
[9:21] and to me that's the way i see the book
[9:23] of revelation
[9:25] because especially
[9:26] as we'll get on over now a little bit
[9:28] later
[9:30] and you'll see that
[9:32] like
[9:33] showing you for instance what i'm
[9:34] talking about in chap in the sixth
[9:36] chapter where the opening of the seals
[9:38] especially say the sixth seal
[9:41] and it just talks about an earthquake it
[9:43] talks about things that are transpiring
[9:46] and and we know that the prophet brought
[9:48] us those
[9:49] understandings of it
[9:51] to see those signs but then when you
[9:53] read the 11th chapter
[9:55] or something like that that's actually
[9:57] just a repeat of the sixth seal
[10:01] because what it is it's just telling you
[10:03] there
[10:04] about this hundred and forty four
[10:06] thousand that's where the prophet got
[10:08] the understanding to preach on the sixth
[10:11] seal
[10:12] you know
[10:13] and then preaching on the sixth seal he
[10:15] would carry it and bring in all about
[10:17] the 144 000 the ceiling and the
[10:20] foreheads and the different things
[10:22] and see you'll find out then basically
[10:24] from chapter 10 on over
[10:26] to uh
[10:29] the white throne about the 17th chapter
[10:32] that is actually a three and a half year
[10:34] period right
[10:36] now you know it it will trans it will
[10:39] tell about how these begins and
[10:42] ends but
[10:43] it's dealing with this tribulation
[10:45] period
[10:46] is what it will be dealing with and
[10:48] that's what i said that's where the
[10:49] prophet then
[10:50] when he preached the sixth seal
[10:54] see he knew already the story behind the
[10:57] two witnesses and so he brings that out
[10:59] and he tells you about this and he
[11:01] brings that out and
[11:03] and things and if we can get there this
[11:06] afternoon i want to make one
[11:08] um
[11:09] message kind of showing you
[11:12] uh what i think that he saw and why he
[11:16] spoke the way he did
[11:18] and and covering the things that he saw
[11:22] and then see if we can see
[11:24] ourselves amen
[11:27] now because we're going to start moving
[11:28] up some in our we've just worked
[11:31] basically been grinding
[11:33] to get the foundation
[11:36] all right and that's just my way of
[11:37] doing it but now we want to pick up a
[11:39] little
[11:41] and we'll be repeating a lot of what
[11:43] we've said but i want us to pick it up
[11:45] into
[11:47] what is what does it mean to you and i
[11:49] yeah right
[11:51] you know
[11:52] i mean we can study the book of
[11:53] revelation it's like i told you uh
[11:56] anybody today
[11:58] uh they say oral roberts university has
[12:00] a complete set of brother brown's
[12:02] message well you know what they know
[12:03] what brother brown said
[12:07] you know you could call them up and if
[12:08] they see anybody studied that right
[12:11] you know you could call them up and say
[12:13] well what did brother brown say on the
[12:14] first seal well that's that was the
[12:16] bible's writer and they would tell you
[12:18] the things that he said all about it and
[12:20] give you verbatim
[12:22] the statements of what it is
[12:25] right and you can say well what did he
[12:27] say about this and they could tell you
[12:29] that why because they have it right
[12:32] but because that we have it
[12:36] doesn't mean we have the revelation
[12:39] that's what i've been trying to drive
[12:41] home
[12:42] and i want to drive that harder and
[12:44] harder because people are saying we have
[12:45] the message yes
[12:48] well
[12:50] anybody that wants to go on the internet
[12:52] that's right that's right
[12:54] right
[12:55] can search the message right man
[12:58] it's not just because we've got it in
[13:00] our hands
[13:01] everybody's got it
[13:04] once it was made public domain see then
[13:06] anybody can download a sermon
[13:09] anybody can do a search thing because
[13:12] you can go on their internet systems and
[13:15] and and it's not just that you can
[13:17] search to see what brother branham said
[13:20] anybody in the world today can search
[13:23] to see what the prophet had to say
[13:25] there'd never been a day like this
[13:28] even in the days of the lord jesus there
[13:30] was no way that the world could have
[13:33] seen everything it was only just a a
[13:36] small group of people
[13:38] right around
[13:40] one said something like one-tenth to one
[13:41] percent or so maybe like that so small a
[13:44] number of people that actually knew that
[13:46] jesus christ was on the earth
[13:49] but you realize that whether they want
[13:51] to agree with it or whether they're
[13:53] looking up to argue about it or trying
[13:56] to to whatever that anybody in the world
[13:58] today that has a computer can
[14:01] right get the message
[14:04] and tell you exactly what brother brown
[14:06] has taught
[14:08] and if they don't even have a computer
[14:10] they can get the
[14:12] mp3s the cds the cassettes and you know
[14:16] any kind of thing to to do and all they
[14:18] got to do is just write them
[14:20] and people send it to them
[14:23] so it's not the distribution oh we're
[14:25] wonderful people because we have the
[14:27] message that's true
[14:29] amen
[14:30] that's true
[14:31] but we can't rest in the basis of just
[14:34] saying we have the message the world
[14:36] don't have this message now that's where
[14:39] your people are wrong today
[14:41] the world has this message
[14:44] you don't believe me go back and turn
[14:46] the computer on
[14:50] anybody in the world that has a computer
[14:51] has the ability to tell you what run
[14:53] around saying right man
[14:56] that can be a good thing or it can be a
[14:58] bad thing
[15:00] because there won't be no argument when
[15:01] you if you're called into judgment
[15:04] there won't be no excuse of saying
[15:08] y'all don't know what we're talking
[15:10] about
[15:11] if y'all just knew this message
[15:15] they said what do you want to know about
[15:16] it
[15:17] yeah you know what you want to know what
[15:19] right around taught on one god throws
[15:21] you all the quotes
[15:23] you want to know what he told a marriage
[15:24] in divorce there's the book
[15:26] yep
[15:29] it's a wonderful day amen
[15:32] but yet they can take the message down
[15:35] twist it earn it do whatever
[15:38] that's right and make it say what they
[15:40] want to do
[15:41] and they'll ask you to say well did he
[15:43] say this
[15:46] it kind of reminds me i remember a story
[15:48] seeing it
[15:49] that when they were asking martin luther
[15:52] you know
[15:53] he said will you recant for what is
[15:55] written
[15:58] you know
[15:59] he said what i've written
[16:01] i won't
[16:03] right
[16:04] no
[16:05] yeah go see there was a lot of other
[16:07] people done added a lot of things to
[16:08] what he said but he said well what i've
[16:11] written
[16:12] that's right
[16:14] i am no way can recant from that
[16:18] what did you say is all right to burn
[16:20] all the catholic churches he said no
[16:24] i didn't say that that's right well we
[16:26] got a book here that says you sitting
[16:28] there i didn't say anything
[16:31] see they couldn't argue the point that's
[16:33] like i told you years ago was up in
[16:35] indiana and i remember it this is
[16:38] probably about 1970 might have been a 68
[16:42] and brother bill paul said that the
[16:44] world council of churches ordered a
[16:45] church age book
[16:47] when anybody could get a true
[16:50] i mean all you had to do was just go to
[16:52] somebody said believer and they gave you
[16:54] a church
[16:55] they were just all over the place but
[16:58] you see they ordered one
[17:00] which means they can use it as evidence
[17:04] because you could claim well we didn't
[17:06] write that
[17:07] and so here is your publication
[17:10] you see church we're living in a
[17:12] wonderful day
[17:14] but we're sitting here facing
[17:16] the things that can destroy us
[17:19] right out of the message itself by being
[17:21] out on the internets and the things like
[17:23] that but what a wonderful day
[17:25] all right thank god but it's the same
[17:27] time i can search to find out what
[17:29] brother brown said anybody
[17:35] it's not just because we've got the
[17:36] message
[17:39] it's whether or not it's been revealed
[17:43] see then with that in mind i've tried to
[17:45] make that point over to us see we used
[17:47] to say we we have the message
[17:50] people don't know what we're talking
[17:51] about right
[17:55] now having the message in it being
[17:56] revealed is too different right
[18:05] all right it's not something that you
[18:06] don't know about
[18:09] right
[18:09] it's whether or not it's been revealed
[18:11] right amen
[18:12] there's the main thing right brother
[18:15] said we need a revelation more than
[18:16] anything
[18:19] now
[18:21] we've been as i said in this
[18:24] talking on the seventh seal
[18:26] found the prophet said a lot of things
[18:28] about the seventh city
[18:31] and we say well it's just silas in
[18:32] heaven for space a half hour
[18:36] but we found he said a lot of times
[18:39] he's told us what it was
[18:44] he said it was the end of all things
[18:50] he said it was those seven thunders of
[18:52] revelations 10.
[18:56] which is a revelation containing the
[18:58] seven seals
[19:00] he's told us that this messenger of
[19:01] malachi 4 will do two things one turn
[19:04] the hearts of the children back and
[19:06] other reveal the revelations of the
[19:08] seven thunders which is a revelation
[19:10] containing the seals
[19:13] he's told us it's the coming of the lord
[19:17] now those things we went through right
[19:20] you know
[19:21] to look at it
[19:25] but he's told us that you cannot add to
[19:27] the word
[19:30] you cannot take away that's right
[19:34] then you say well well then my idea the
[19:36] seventh seal or someone what does it
[19:38] make you different what your idea is my
[19:40] idea whose idea
[19:42] what did the prophet say even oral
[19:43] roberts university tell you what he said
[19:46] they wouldn't say this is our idea about
[19:48] it you ask us what he said we give you
[19:50] we'll give you the
[19:53] but you see in the message we're
[19:55] revelated people
[19:57] we're always looking for some form of of
[20:00] a great understanding that
[20:02] nobody else don't have
[20:05] you know and in doing that see then we
[20:07] wind up
[20:09] come find out most time we wound up not
[20:11] having it or sailed
[20:13] but still listen
[20:20] after something that the prophet said
[20:23] and the bible says
[20:25] that they're silenced in heaven
[20:30] we've had over the years
[20:32] emphasis placed upon
[20:36] by a lot of preachers and things that
[20:40] and using quotes from judge brown
[20:43] that would say that
[20:46] see there are the seven seals not even
[20:48] written
[20:58] well it says there's solace in heaven
[21:02] there's not a blank in revelations 8 1.
[21:08] he says there's silence in heaven right
[21:10] amen
[21:13] all right then we went through where the
[21:15] prophet would say
[21:18] this is my revelation of it
[21:22] program 245 of the seventh seal he said
[21:25] this is my revelation of it
[21:28] well that is like i told you then we we
[21:30] we we say well out seal one two three
[21:34] four five six
[21:37] you know then it comes at seven he said
[21:39] well this is my revelation he told us
[21:40] what his revelation was on seal number
[21:42] one
[21:45] i have to be dependent upon him to
[21:48] to be able to understand what seal
[21:50] number one is don't you
[21:53] but he said this is my revelation
[21:55] right when he come to the seventh seal
[21:57] it wasn't his revelation of a revelation
[22:00] of a revelation and had no revelation
[22:02] all right
[22:04] i hope that come out right i'm trying to
[22:06] put enough
[22:07] points into it
[22:13] when it says a silence in heaven that's
[22:15] written in the bible amen
[22:18] so that means the seven seals in the
[22:20] bible amen right there was a problem
[22:22] with the brother brown coming along then
[22:24] and we gave the quote where he said he
[22:26] said this seven seals even spoke up from
[22:28] genesis all these seals that spoke of
[22:30] coming down from genesis
[22:33] well it's not an addition to the book
[22:36] that's right you remember they said to
[22:38] it run around with your abilities and
[22:39] you could write a 23rd chapter of
[22:41] revelation he said they're trying to
[22:42] trap me
[22:46] he said no he said you can't add two
[22:51] well those seven thunders brother adam
[22:53] won't that be something that will be
[22:55] given to someone he said watch what
[22:57] you're saying right right
[23:01] see because you're saying that someone
[23:03] is going to receive something that is
[23:05] not
[23:06] written that's your implication
[23:10] and then that way you can make it
[23:11] anything you want it to be
[23:13] i can say my big toe is a seventh seal
[23:18] what you can say is yours is
[23:22] well that's being silly no it's just
[23:24] i have no scripture for my big toe being
[23:27] god
[23:31] but we do have a message that is
[23:35] the message is perfect amen
[23:38] sure the messenger had flaws in his
[23:39] human abilities in the speech and that
[23:42] but the message is perfect
[23:44] that's right
[23:48] but it's just written in all this in the
[23:50] same basis to me that's why it's so
[23:52] wonderful to read and study
[23:54] is because it's just like the bible was
[23:56] written that's right
[23:59] then we have the people in the message
[24:00] say you know and it's fine line these up
[24:02] and get them lined up well that's good
[24:04] but
[24:05] if you don't know how to get this one
[24:07] lined up with that one all right man
[24:12] i mean you guys all you want to about
[24:13] the two sides on the gun thank you
[24:16] yeah
[24:19] and if you lay that gun down in the vice
[24:21] and clamp it down and buckle it down and
[24:24] right get down there and look down
[24:25] through there it's going to show the
[24:27] same thing every time right
[24:29] but if you hold it up in your hand it's
[24:32] going to float around
[24:34] right and you ain't going to be hitting
[24:36] at a harsh breath at 100 yards
[24:39] you're going to be lucky with iron
[24:41] sights in a 2 inch group at 100 yards or
[24:43] something
[24:44] you know
[24:46] but you see that's the way we try to
[24:48] make it something
[24:50] why worry about making it something
[24:53] amen
[24:54] that's right if we're going to depend
[24:56] upon one two three four five six
[24:58] of the seals for you know the prophet to
[25:01] reveal it then we're going to depend
[25:02] upon marriage and divorce and we're
[25:04] going to depend upon this
[25:06] the serpent seek the one god the all of
[25:08] the things then why can't we depend upon
[25:10] what he says about it
[25:18] but yet they're arguing whether the
[25:19] seals broke or not
[25:23] the bible says it didn't matter
[25:27] right yes but we just don't know what we
[25:29] we know what them other signals are
[25:31] that's right now how did you know what
[25:34] they are
[25:35] right how did you come to the ability
[25:38] right of understanding seal number one
[25:42] because of the quota i'd love to give to
[25:44] you
[25:45] brother reynolds said
[25:47] they'd be a prophetic gift
[25:49] yeah we've been over at and overnight on
[25:52] questions and after it on the seal
[25:54] he said
[25:56] the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything
[25:58] right
[26:00] what's going to happen to it
[26:02] because at the end of that church age
[26:04] has become a prophetic gift
[26:06] to reveal this time
[26:08] so we're totally dependent upon him for
[26:10] everything well we better be totally
[26:12] dependent upon the seventh trim to the
[26:14] seventh seal to tell us what it is right
[26:16] that's right then when he says this is
[26:17] my revelation of it
[26:21] all right amen
[26:23] and then he'll say it's no seventh
[26:25] thunders
[26:26] of revelations 10.
[26:28] then he'll say it's the end of all
[26:30] things then he'll says the coming of the
[26:32] lord
[26:34] the thing that even jesus didn't know
[26:35] when he would return
[26:41] now we can go through the message and
[26:43] understand
[26:46] and see what is being said to us
[26:48] to help us to understand what does it
[26:51] mean to you
[26:56] to find out what it meant to him
[26:59] we must do that and we'll deal more that
[27:01] this evening
[27:03] with what it meant to him
[27:06] but if we don't find out what it means
[27:08] to us amen yes
[27:17] sorry no no different than oral roberts
[27:20] university with the tapes and books live
[27:22] in front of me
[27:24] that's right
[27:27] you certainly don't get to message
[27:28] reading grier's almanac
[27:38] faith truly must come by hearing amen
[27:43] and hearing by the word of god
[27:48] i kept emphasizing something to you the
[27:50] other day that i want you to get this
[27:51] morning
[27:55] he says there's silence in heaven
[27:59] perspective
[28:03] i know that what the prophet has said
[28:05] and can quote with you
[28:07] about it so the reason i say that is
[28:09] just for not to be smart ethically but
[28:11] to be truthful
[28:13] i know that brett around covers when it
[28:15] comes to seal number one he kind of
[28:16] drops back to earth and
[28:18] brings things but remember seal never
[28:21] want number one never broke on earth
[28:27] it broke into heaven
[28:32] amen
[28:35] was given to john brother branham said
[28:37] right
[28:39] and then was handed down he said to the
[28:43] seventh angel
[28:45] to proclaim
[28:46] all right
[28:51] so you're not on an earthly journey just
[28:53] because that you can see
[28:57] that's right
[28:59] that's why then it turned out to be as
[29:01] we've been over to chapter 10
[29:04] chapter 10 you find this mighty angel
[29:07] standing on earth
[29:09] amen which is christ right right around
[29:12] said that seventh angel has to be on
[29:15] earth at the time of this coming
[29:18] talking of revelations 10 1 and through
[29:20] there
[29:22] now you're dropping back to earth
[29:27] because dropping back to earth means
[29:29] we're dropping back to the point of
[29:30] where that can be revealed to us amen
[29:32] that's right
[29:36] john went up over in revelations
[29:38] 4c
[29:41] 5 6 7 8 9
[29:44] 10.
[29:49] it's things that are transpiring in
[29:51] heaven
[29:54] we want to get to earth on a lot of it
[30:02] when i said what it did a moment ago
[30:03] that chapters when you get into the
[30:05] sixth seal it just says there's an
[30:07] earthquake and this happens and that
[30:08] happens this happened when we run around
[30:10] covered what happened
[30:12] he said this is the tribulation period
[30:15] and he said this is where the 144 000 is
[30:18] called out well it doesn't lift 140 one
[30:20] thousand in chat and
[30:22] the sixth seal is riding out
[30:28] he's giving you his revelation amen
[30:31] but he's got scripture for it right
[30:36] it's not just his thoughts
[30:40] he's telling us the scriptures
[30:43] the seal breaks in heaven
[30:53] chapter 5 is in heaven
[30:57] chapter 4 is in heaven
[30:59] amen
[31:01] the breaking of chap in chapter 6 of
[31:04] the first seal is in heaven
[31:08] preach your bible
[31:14] see then it's revealed and brought down
[31:16] to us by way of the seventh angel
[31:21] amen
[31:22] right to tell us about these things amen
[31:27] how many years have we preached to where
[31:28] the prophet said in chapter four of the
[31:32] book of revelation that the bride goes
[31:34] up
[31:35] amen
[31:36] and not seen until chapter 19.
[31:49] you see we're seeing by revelation
[31:52] what transpires in heaven
[31:57] now remember we were trying to bring out
[31:59] about the the prophet said that was
[32:01] silenced in heaven he goes right over to
[32:03] revelation 10 and he brings out it's
[32:05] those seven thunders
[32:10] then you back up to a message called
[32:13] is this the time just prior to the seal
[32:19] he said those seven thunders don't sound
[32:21] in heaven
[32:27] amen
[32:29] people said john was translated up and
[32:31] heard the thunders right
[32:33] fine sure
[32:35] but brother ryan said daniel heard the
[32:37] thunders that's right but daniel wasn't
[32:40] translated into heaven
[32:44] he was on earth writing about divisions
[32:46] that was coming to it
[32:50] see those seven thunder sound on earth
[32:52] amen
[32:56] why is there silence in heaven
[33:00] and where would that silence be related
[33:03] to in the scriptures
[33:06] you remember how i was bringing out and
[33:08] i hope you've listened
[33:10] at least you snore or not or whatever
[33:12] you know you have just to hire enough to
[33:15] understand
[33:20] i keep repeating things because it's
[33:21] very valuable to me
[33:26] the sixth seal has no mention of 144
[33:29] 000.
[33:32] there's no mention of two prophets
[33:35] in the writing of the sixth seal it's an
[33:36] earthquake it's things that happen
[33:38] transpired upon the earth right
[33:40] but the prophet goes over into the 11th
[33:43] chapter 12th and on through
[33:46] and picking up that
[33:49] two witnesses and 144 thousand right so
[33:52] that he's tied with the scriptures
[33:57] so when he comes to revelation 8 1 he
[33:59] says they silence in heaven
[34:02] because i'm going to tell you my
[34:03] revelation jumps right over to
[34:04] revelation 10.
[34:09] come on read the book
[34:11] 245 of the
[34:13] seal book i'm sitting or looking at if
[34:15] you want me to read it
[34:20] he goes immediately to chapter 10.
[34:24] all right what
[34:28] because it says the silence in chapter
[34:30] eight
[34:33] in chapter 10 it says
[34:35] seal up
[34:39] the things that the seven thunders said
[34:41] and write them not
[34:44] so then the bible is sealed with the
[34:45] seven thunders
[34:48] no no no brother daley seven seals
[34:51] the boy you
[34:52] you really
[34:54] oral roberts can say that right
[34:58] i hope they don't mind me using those
[35:00] terms
[35:01] you know because anybody with a book can
[35:02] read that
[35:04] i can ask you anything and you can go in
[35:06] there and sit down on the computer just
[35:08] type in thunder that'll come to you
[35:09] eventually
[35:11] and you can read it
[35:12] that's right right
[35:15] but listen
[35:16] he goes right straight to the thing
[35:19] that there's related to silence
[35:23] what
[35:25] if something is sealed up
[35:30] it's silent
[35:32] the book of daniel it comes to the end
[35:34] and daniel says he's told by the angel
[35:37] to seal up the things
[35:40] and write it now
[35:45] will not be made known until the end
[35:47] time when the prophet would come to
[35:49] bring us the message amen
[35:51] then we can understand the book of
[35:52] daniel in the book of revelation
[35:59] you see why the prophet would
[36:00] immediately go to that
[36:03] what's that this afternoon now when we
[36:04] tied together the lord willing when we
[36:07] come down to the tent vision the throne
[36:09] in the hand the third pull the things
[36:12] and and watch that again be repeating
[36:14] that's what i'm saying
[36:15] so it'd be good to
[36:17] write it down
[36:19] then when the prophet comes over to
[36:20] revelation 8
[36:24] 1. and it says silence in heaven
[36:30] he immediately goes to chapter 10
[36:35] because he knows
[36:37] by chapter 10 the seals have already
[36:41] been broken by the lamb
[36:44] amen come on read your bible
[36:48] eight one comes before ten okay
[36:51] i'm not good in math
[36:53] if i get above that i'll take my shoes
[36:54] off but
[36:55] i can't at least get the pin
[36:59] but listen
[37:02] why would he immediately go
[37:05] to something that is
[37:07] sealed up right that's right
[37:13] brother adam what is revelation 8 1. you
[37:15] said revelation 10
[37:18] yeah
[37:21] it's the thing that's sealed up
[37:25] those seven thunders
[37:27] the book is sealed with the seven
[37:29] thunders remember
[37:31] he said no no no no no you don't
[37:32] understand that we got a quote here
[37:34] we're good
[37:36] just keep quoting you'll find a good one
[37:40] where the prophet said the seals are
[37:41] sealed with their seven thunders
[37:46] sure he said until those to understand
[37:48] we don't know what these seals are
[37:53] he even said that if the seventh seal
[37:56] wasn't broke
[38:00] and all week long he had said this is
[38:02] thus saith the lord right come on and he
[38:04] said it throughout the week of the seals
[38:06] and all you know this is not saith the
[38:08] lord
[38:10] he gets over to the
[38:12] questions and answers he says if god
[38:14] don't come and break that seventh seal
[38:16] we're only presuming amen
[38:19] right
[38:22] what about having that said the lord and
[38:23] you're only presenting me yeah
[38:26] come on you explain that now if you if
[38:27] you want questions you know people got
[38:29] questions what is this and what is that
[38:31] i got a lot of good ones
[38:34] i don't mean yours ain't a good one i
[38:36] just mean i got a lot of good ones
[38:41] but why would you immediately go from
[38:43] revelation 8 1 over to revelations 10.
[38:50] he said there's silence in heaven for
[38:52] the
[38:53] place a half hour
[38:55] to seal up those things which is seventh
[38:56] underground and write it not right but
[38:58] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[39:00] angel when he shall begin to sound
[39:04] the prophet said not in his years of
[39:06] preparation as he was restoring the
[39:09] faith of the fathers
[39:10] but he said when he begins to sound his
[39:12] message
[39:14] amen the brother around his message
[39:16] began with the opening of the seals
[39:17] right he preached about three years
[39:21] the other was a restoration back to the
[39:23] faith of the fathers that was written in
[39:25] the book
[39:28] seals is not an addition to the book or
[39:30] he would be the false prophet amen
[39:34] to try to tell us his revelation of
[39:36] something is not even written at all
[39:38] he just says they silence in heaven
[39:41] brother adam if they silence in heaven
[39:44] i can understand and go with you and
[39:46] believe you jump over to revelation 10
[39:48] to find and show me something there that
[39:51] is sealed up that nobody don't know
[39:52] anything about
[39:54] and that would make definitely a silence
[39:57] huh
[39:59] a lot of blabbering about what it is i
[40:01] hope i get down to the description in a
[40:02] minute but
[40:04] you know
[40:08] but that brought around i want to know
[40:09] one thing
[40:14] when you got to this
[40:16] part of explaining it
[40:22] and you said all in heaven stood in all
[40:24] you remember that
[40:30] he said they didn't move
[40:32] because he did said he'd give away the
[40:34] secret
[40:38] i'm brought around them where are you at
[40:40] certainly not on earth because there's
[40:41] too much blabbering going on
[40:45] right
[40:47] i think you see this i think is that
[40:49] blah blah blah blah blah you know
[40:53] so he's certainly not on earth
[40:58] who is in heaven
[41:02] now i ask you a simple question where is
[41:05] there silence in heaven
[41:10] where's your scriptures brother branham
[41:11] that you're going to you're a scriptural
[41:13] prophet
[41:15] where are you going to tie it to
[41:21] he said all them cherubims
[41:26] and all them angels
[41:30] i'm paraphrasing but i'm quoting him
[41:32] come on
[41:37] almost 24 hours
[41:47] standing in awe
[41:51] now where's he at
[41:55] he's in revelations four and five right
[41:59] come on
[42:00] you understand
[42:02] i hope you're catching on
[42:05] that brother around had scripture for
[42:07] things
[42:09] we must have scripture
[42:13] by way of him see not our own but our
[42:17] own's gonna twist it like crazy so if
[42:19] i'm gonna depend on him to help my tell
[42:22] me his revelation i'm certainly gonna
[42:24] depend upon him tell me the scripts
[42:25] right
[42:26] all right
[42:27] i may be dumb but i ain't stupid
[42:30] all right
[42:31] but
[42:33] you go to chapter four and five
[42:36] like i said i got a lot of questions
[42:43] what
[42:46] is the bride does she go up in
[42:47] revelation 4 1 is that the words of the
[42:49] prophet
[42:54] well i want to ask you a simple little
[42:56] question
[43:01] how can there be 24 elders
[43:04] in chapter 4 and time
[43:11] a simple question
[43:19] right around who are those 24 elders he
[43:21] said to 12 apostles
[43:26] and the 12 patriarchs
[43:29] that's right right
[43:35] now i can understand because of rapture
[43:38] in chapter 4. bringing it in john type
[43:41] in the rapture
[43:43] to be able to go up to heaven to see
[43:45] things
[43:48] but how can those 12
[43:50] patriarchs be there
[44:00] i got questions too
[44:03] right
[44:08] but also like something else that was
[44:10] said one time about me
[44:12] you know
[44:14] we were speaking one time on marriage
[44:16] and divorce and
[44:17] a certain man he
[44:20] was up speaking and i got up behind him
[44:22] and
[44:24] i asked a few questions and
[44:26] he raised his hand and the end of it and
[44:29] he said uh
[44:33] i hate it when a man asks a question
[44:35] when he's the only one in the building's
[44:36] got the answer
[44:38] i said i wouldn't ask the question if i
[44:40] didn't have the answer
[44:47] you want to sit down and talk
[44:49] we talk
[44:50] i don't ask the question that i don't
[44:53] know the answer
[44:55] you say well i ask questions because i
[44:57] don't know them
[44:58] you don't study long enough
[45:01] if you study a long time you'll find out
[45:04] there's an answer all right
[45:06] just like brother branham now there's
[45:08] silence in heaven for a space of half
[45:10] hour
[45:11] where have you got a scripture for that
[45:22] he said well okay he says
[45:26] all those elders and
[45:28] all those angels
[45:31] and all those chirpings and things are
[45:33] standing in awe
[45:39] now where's he at he's in chapter five
[45:42] he has a scripture he knows where he's
[45:44] at
[45:52] but still brother branham i want to know
[45:53] one thing
[45:56] because in chapter 5 all at once it
[45:58] becomes a from a situation of
[46:02] standing in awe
[46:07] it comes to a time of a
[46:09] highly
[46:12] glorious
[46:14] elated
[46:16] wonderful
[46:18] shouting glory hallelujah time
[46:23] in chapter five
[46:29] right
[46:31] even john said everybody in the world
[46:34] heard me hollering that's right amen
[46:36] right
[46:40] but you better read your bible
[46:44] john wooden hollering
[46:46] until the lamb took the book
[46:48] all right
[46:57] are we in the scripture
[47:00] do we need to read chapter five for you
[47:02] to know what i'm talking about is in
[47:03] there
[47:08] john sees actually all lost without a
[47:11] lamb to come forth
[47:12] amen
[47:16] is that chapter five
[47:18] he sees all law
[47:23] without a lamb
[47:26] pull it up brothers we might as well get
[47:28] all this out of the way while we had it
[47:30] brother joe pull up chapter five i know
[47:32] you can do that in hurry
[47:34] while i talk a little bit
[47:38] see there's a silence in heaven
[47:47] for a special half hour
[47:50] then there's a rejoicing in heaven
[47:56] i don't really know how long that lies
[47:58] do you
[48:00] ain't going to worry about it right
[48:02] but look
[48:06] i saw on the right hand of him and said
[48:08] on the throne book written within on the
[48:09] backside
[48:10] sealed with seven seals
[48:13] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[48:14] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[48:16] the book in the loose to seal thereof
[48:22] proclamation goes out
[48:26] is there anybody that steps up and tells
[48:28] you now wait a minute you don't read
[48:29] them down here but just stay with me
[48:32] where i'm at okay brendan said we'll
[48:34] pull it up just read it
[48:40] when you see a book
[48:45] and a proclamation
[48:47] and he says no man in heaven
[48:51] nor on our earth
[48:53] neither under the earth was able to
[48:58] open the book needed to look their own
[49:00] right
[49:03] okay
[49:08] jordy much going on
[49:11] and i went much because no man was found
[49:14] worthy to open and to read the book
[49:15] neither through the god
[49:18] now you know what the prophet said
[49:19] happened there was he said
[49:21] and this is a man that's had the baptism
[49:23] of the holy ghost for 60 years
[49:28] he's not wondering about
[49:31] whether or not he's saved right
[49:34] right
[49:38] he ought to know by now pretty well that
[49:39] he is saved because he wouldn't be taken
[49:41] up to where he was
[49:43] if he hadn't been saved and you know he
[49:45] didn't use somebody else he used john
[49:49] but when john comes to this point of
[49:51] seeing things
[49:56] he knows there's something about the
[49:57] plan of redemption that is not complete
[49:59] yet
[50:01] right
[50:07] he has already written his gospel
[50:12] come on he wrote john right
[50:14] we you're with me
[50:17] same one that wrote john the same one
[50:18] went to pat my scene 1995-96 right
[50:22] right
[50:24] he's already wrote about the savior
[50:27] he's already even said
[50:30] and wrote that john the baptist said
[50:33] behold the lamb of god that takes away
[50:35] the sin of the world
[50:38] amen so he knew he was a savior
[50:44] he knew he was god
[50:45] he explains him in john 1 1. in the
[50:48] beginning was the word word was with god
[50:49] and the word was god and the word was
[50:51] made flesh and dwelt among us
[50:54] he's writing this somewhere around 80 50
[50:57] according to the records
[50:58] it wasn't actually pinned as they went
[51:00] along
[51:02] somewhere close to 80 50 the four
[51:04] gospels were written
[51:06] you remember luke and mark was not even
[51:08] one of the originals
[51:11] and
[51:12] john has already written about these
[51:14] things
[51:17] he's already seen maybe millions saved
[51:20] under his ministry
[51:23] right
[51:24] or either two wouldn't make a difference
[51:26] right two or two million don't matter to
[51:28] god
[51:29] just get the point
[51:31] that's what you say you say something to
[51:33] people
[51:34] how did he know they were familiar
[51:36] then you're buying dumb gone and you
[51:37] ain't heard nothing else i'm saying
[51:40] you're gonna erase it all out your
[51:41] computer went blank
[51:44] your brain
[51:45] hold it back up and
[51:48] i say those things that make you think
[51:53] i'm talking brother ron spencer last
[51:55] night about
[51:56] something i said
[51:57] he said something about your smart man
[51:59] that's no ain't smart
[52:01] i said a smart man is not one you think
[52:03] knows everything
[52:06] i said a smart man is not the one who
[52:07] knows everything cody's got his brain
[52:09] full of junk
[52:11] a smart man is a man that knows where to
[52:13] go get what he needs
[52:15] you've heard me explain that a lot of
[52:16] times
[52:18] you know what he said einstein said
[52:22] he said einstein said why to try why try
[52:25] to remember what you can write to him
[52:27] i didn't know he said that i said well
[52:29] he's a pretty smart guy me and him get
[52:32] along a little bit
[52:35] don't put me in that gotta go with it
[52:36] but what
[52:38] but listen
[52:42] and i wept much because no man was found
[52:44] worthy to open and read the book needed
[52:46] to look down so there wasn't nobody
[52:48] running around screaming and hollering
[52:51] it's in a quiet mode
[52:54] nobody's saying i know who can do it you
[52:56] know that brother random said the sages
[52:58] were there
[53:00] the prophets and things was there right
[53:02] now you take over 24 elders and get down
[53:05] in there with it and you'll find out
[53:06] there's a lot of things in there
[53:09] they were there
[53:10] but he said they wouldn't worthy
[53:15] so that get pretty quiet if i said
[53:16] around here is anybody worthy
[53:19] to take the book that's right
[53:21] i wouldn't raise my hand and you
[53:22] wouldn't do yours either because you
[53:24] know you'd be wrong that's right
[53:26] so things was pretty quiet
[53:29] in heaven
[53:33] but then he wept much
[53:35] and watched
[53:36] one of the ever said to me we not behold
[53:39] the lion of the tribe of judah the root
[53:41] of david has prevailed to open the book
[53:43] in the loose the seven seals thereof
[53:48] okay
[53:49] a proclamation is made of one that can
[53:51] do it and watch the next verse
[53:53] and i'll be held in lord in the midst of
[53:55] the throne into the four beasts and in
[53:56] the midst of the elders instead of lamb
[53:59] as it had been slain
[54:01] having seven horns and seven eyes
[54:03] which are the seven spiritual gods set
[54:05] forth into all the earth
[54:07] and he came and took the book out of the
[54:09] right hand of him that set up on the
[54:11] throne
[54:15] there's your deadly huss silence right
[54:17] there
[54:22] even though the lamb has the book in his
[54:24] hand
[54:25] he hasn't said a word
[54:36] i asked a person a question the other
[54:38] day which was not even a christian
[54:41] they just come across
[54:43] not derogatory to anybody
[54:46] and i just asked a simple question
[54:51] i said why would there's silence in
[54:53] heaven first place a half hour
[55:02] there's no answer we'd be able to reply
[55:11] i said what would cause you
[55:15] now first we've got to get to standing
[55:17] all then we get to rejoicing okay
[55:18] everybody understand how we're going to
[55:20] divide the book of revelation
[55:22] this is off the message i need during
[55:23] page two so we'll get to see
[55:27] but what can you think about
[55:33] what can you think about
[55:36] that would make you stand in oh
[55:43] no the about it you think with me
[55:46] you know write it down if you want to
[55:47] whatever
[55:50] what would cause you
[55:52] to stand in total all in reverence for
[55:55] 30 minutes in heaven which that could
[55:57] mean
[55:58] i'm telling what on earth because that's
[56:00] what everybody's trying to figure it out
[56:01] they got it down to 21 years and they
[56:03] got it down to this and they got it down
[56:04] to that oh my lord it says silence in
[56:06] heaven don't say unto about earth
[56:09] what's silence in heaven when heaven has
[56:12] no time
[56:14] right ain't no days and times and
[56:17] seasons in heaven
[56:20] nobody tried to figure out 30 minutes on
[56:22] earth
[56:25] well it's about 21 years so it ought to
[56:27] be well it's over with by now about the
[56:29] 21 you had figured out
[56:32] yeah but listen
[56:35] what could happen robbie that would
[56:37] cause you
[56:39] to stand in awe
[56:45] and afraid to move a muscle
[56:49] afraid to battle an eye
[56:55] what could happen
[56:58] well now what it is brother david
[57:00] i i just walk up to him and i hand him a
[57:03] million dollars
[57:07] he's smart enough to know that ain't
[57:09] right
[57:10] that's right because you know what to do
[57:12] if i started handing out million dollar
[57:14] bills this day
[57:15] there'd be a stampede up this way
[57:22] and they'd be screaming and hollering
[57:28] are you getting the point
[57:32] sure wouldn't be silence would it
[57:36] there won't be no afternoon service yeah
[57:41] because there wouldn't be nobody here
[57:47] everybody be gone to pay the bills to
[57:49] buy the car to buy the home to do the
[57:51] what
[57:52] surely wouldn't be silence
[57:59] the woman calls you
[58:04] what would cause you because remember in
[58:06] chapter five
[58:08] you are supposed to be there that's
[58:10] right
[58:12] maybe not in a corporal body
[58:15] because i don't personally believe
[58:17] revelations 5 is physical
[58:20] corporal believe it's john in heaven
[58:23] seeing the future that can become
[58:25] physical and corporal
[58:33] what would cause you to stand standing
[58:35] on
[58:45] remember those in heaven must be looking
[58:47] down the earth
[58:52] i made a little point a moment ago i
[58:53] didn't know where you followed it or not
[58:55] but
[58:58] the seven thunder sound on earth
[59:06] that's right
[59:10] what would be that would cause you to
[59:12] standing on
[59:25] okay brother dale you tell us what you
[59:27] think it is
[59:29] the thing that would cause me to stand
[59:31] in perfectly all in a condition
[59:34] would not be no materialistic nothing or
[59:36] any form
[59:46] you realize that a revelation
[59:49] is eternal
[59:55] you ever noticed that god revealed
[59:56] something to you especially say you
[59:58] preachers you know to think about it
[1:00:00] god revealed something to you
[1:00:02] it takes you five years to preach what
[1:00:04] he showed you in a split second
[1:00:07] right right
[1:00:10] what about something sister gail when
[1:00:12] you were standing in the kitchen there
[1:00:14] and
[1:00:18] he was mopping or whatever he was doing
[1:00:19] and
[1:00:21] you know what happened
[1:00:27] something spoke to he didn't
[1:00:30] you said that ain't nothing but the
[1:00:32] truth
[1:00:33] but you're just one god
[1:00:36] you know that time stood still sure
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:42] now that was only a blink between we try
[1:00:44] to figure out all those things you know
[1:00:46] twinkling of an eye or this twitch or
[1:00:48] what whatever
[1:00:52] how long that is or what it is it's a
[1:00:54] wink or the but i've got something in my
[1:00:56] eye
[1:01:03] revelation is eternal amen amen
[1:01:07] there's no beginning
[1:01:09] has no ending
[1:01:15] when you saw this message was true
[1:01:18] you believe that right around with the
[1:01:20] prophet god sent a prophet
[1:01:23] a split second was what it was right
[1:01:26] right
[1:01:27] i heard people tell about you know that
[1:01:29] god told him to do this and i heard a
[1:01:31] man one time saying and he said god told
[1:01:33] him go fish over here and he said no
[1:01:34] road i'm gonna get you over here because
[1:01:35] there's water over here ain't nothing
[1:01:37] over there he's god just kept god kept
[1:01:39] telling him he said go over here and
[1:01:41] fish
[1:01:43] now you don't argue with god
[1:01:46] if you think you do you're arguing with
[1:01:48] the wrong one
[1:01:50] you got the guy with the horns talking
[1:01:52] to you
[1:01:54] god don't argue with nobody
[1:01:56] run around and say come down there in
[1:01:58] that room and meet me
[1:02:01] and tell me this and he said the rest of
[1:02:04] the day
[1:02:05] i spent it checking out to see whether
[1:02:07] it was true or not
[1:02:09] am i quoting from the syllabus
[1:02:14] you realize when something is revealed
[1:02:16] to you you're in heavenly places in
[1:02:18] christ
[1:02:18] jesus you agree
[1:02:22] how long
[1:02:25] earthly time only a split second
[1:02:32] now i know god deals with the rest of
[1:02:34] the day we're doing it but get what i'm
[1:02:36] saying
[1:02:37] he deals with you for months he does
[1:02:38] with me and i'm preaching on something
[1:02:41] that he spoke to me one split second
[1:02:45] right
[1:02:47] am i talking about that
[1:02:49] i'm talking about how long it was when
[1:02:51] he revealed it to you
[1:02:55] you saw one god you saw water baptism it
[1:02:57] was just
[1:03:00] that was it
[1:03:06] are you catching on
[1:03:09] what would cause you to stand in all
[1:03:19] i think i can say this about everybody
[1:03:21] here amen
[1:03:24] at least i'll say it for myself
[1:03:29] and i'm going to say it in a way that's
[1:03:30] a question
[1:03:37] if god would drop down right now
[1:03:40] and reveal to me in a split second
[1:03:44] that i'm just as righteous as he is
[1:03:48] by being in jesus christ
[1:03:52] you can have all your money
[1:03:55] you can have all your shoes out and
[1:03:57] hooplas
[1:03:59] you can have all the things
[1:04:06] i burned a million dollar check right
[1:04:14] but even by telling you
[1:04:18] okay we're going to give you a million
[1:04:19] dollars this morning when everybody here
[1:04:21] take a check million dollars
[1:04:24] i said you need to come back to see me
[1:04:26] it might be something else
[1:04:29] how many would come back
[1:04:36] i said your only condition is you got to
[1:04:38] burn that million dollar check
[1:04:44] you'd think about it
[1:04:52] i just talked
[1:04:56] i'm trying to get a point cry
[1:05:02] john saw
[1:05:07] the one that could take the book
[1:05:10] was he screaming and hollering no
[1:05:15] he waited till he got through taking the
[1:05:17] book then he started hollering
[1:05:20] that's secondary right
[1:05:28] i thought we believed the
[1:05:31] seals and the things was his prophet's
[1:05:34] message
[1:05:36] it was the plan of redemption that's
[1:05:37] right
[1:05:40] and even though they were back there and
[1:05:43] as they were bringing out while ago that
[1:05:44] the disciples they preached those great
[1:05:46] wonderful things but yet they never
[1:05:48] brought this
[1:05:49] into manifestation or an opening of the
[1:05:51] scenes and times it was left for the end
[1:05:53] time to be here with the bride of jesus
[1:05:55] christ and a prophet of god
[1:06:03] the plan of redemption
[1:06:11] now remember those that are in heaven
[1:06:14] whether you want to make it literal what
[1:06:16] you want to do with it i ain't going to
[1:06:17] argue with nobody i'm done
[1:06:20] i've already flushed around horror of
[1:06:22] all these years
[1:06:23] and they've done no good
[1:06:25] i'm going on down the road
[1:06:28] i preach what i believe
[1:06:31] you want to know what i believe go back
[1:06:32] and get the tapes when i bleed
[1:06:34] just don't accuse me of saying things
[1:06:36] that i don't say
[1:06:38] the tapes are there
[1:06:40] i'm going down the road one time
[1:06:46] this message has brought us the plan of
[1:06:48] redemption
[1:06:55] and you don't understand what you're
[1:06:57] doing if
[1:06:58] if you don't believe that seventh seal
[1:07:00] is open
[1:07:03] then you're not even into the silence
[1:07:05] right
[1:07:06] you're not even capable of understanding
[1:07:09] the plan of redemption
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:11] that's right
[1:07:12] now how many of you been around here for
[1:07:14] quite a while heard me about 82 and 83
[1:07:18] 79
[1:07:20] we don't have the tapes but
[1:07:22] we have the 82 and 83
[1:07:26] where i preach what i believe those
[1:07:27] seals were
[1:07:29] never chose to go back and try to preach
[1:07:31] them over again did during 2005
[1:07:34] just as a review for people here
[1:07:38] but i don't believe in arguing about
[1:07:39] anything
[1:07:41] i believe in preaching it and then going
[1:07:43] on down the road
[1:07:44] look to god to whether it's true or not
[1:07:49] but how many of you remember all down
[1:07:51] through there brother gary was here he
[1:07:53] could tell you the tape it was on and
[1:07:56] the day i preached it
[1:07:59] that these seals revealed the plan of
[1:08:02] redemption
[1:08:06] and that the disciples understood the
[1:08:08] plan of redemption
[1:08:10] for soul and spirit right
[1:08:14] but he didn't bring a dot bring it to an
[1:08:16] adoptional form
[1:08:18] to where that it would be to with the
[1:08:20] redemption of our body
[1:08:23] to understand the redemption of the body
[1:08:25] it would take this end time message to
[1:08:27] bring forth and review the whole entire
[1:08:29] plan of redemption
[1:08:32] but then the prophet's message would
[1:08:34] start
[1:08:35] and he would bring us the message to
[1:08:37] take to the change
[1:08:40] of these bodies
[1:08:42] the seventh seal then doesn't reveal
[1:08:44] anything about redemption
[1:08:48] the six seals to redemption
[1:08:51] what your prophet says
[1:08:55] six seal book of redemption how many
[1:08:57] measures of barley did he give ruth amen
[1:09:02] how many seals did jesus preach amen
[1:09:08] in matthew 24
[1:09:12] he didn't have to preach the seventh
[1:09:13] because he was the seventh
[1:09:16] come on you want to argue the point
[1:09:18] he was seven
[1:09:20] he didn't have to preach it right
[1:09:22] he was just standing there
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:25] so i told you over and over when i read
[1:09:27] the seal book the first time
[1:09:30] when i got over to the seventh seal and
[1:09:32] all i could see that brother around were
[1:09:33] talking about himself
[1:09:36] and that throwed me for a look and i
[1:09:38] said lord i don't understand what the
[1:09:39] man is doing all he did talking about
[1:09:41] himself
[1:09:43] he supposed to be telling me about you
[1:09:46] yeah come on so i better back up because
[1:09:48] i don't understand
[1:09:50] i backed up and went to the church age
[1:09:52] book stayed in it for years studying
[1:09:56] and then finally came forth and preached
[1:09:57] it and could see
[1:09:59] you know what he was doing he was
[1:10:00] talking about himself
[1:10:04] i was right all along i just didn't have
[1:10:06] it lined up in revelation
[1:10:09] but he was telling us what happened in
[1:10:10] his own life right right amen
[1:10:14] now what about in my life in your life
[1:10:17] amen amen
[1:10:21] prophet said it
[1:10:23] in the
[1:10:24] first paragraph for the seventh seal
[1:10:31] he said have we heard the voice of god
[1:10:35] speaking to our hearts through the
[1:10:37] opening of these seals
[1:10:42] he said have we heard the voice of god
[1:10:46] see church
[1:10:49] the thunder's the voice of god
[1:10:55] yet all we want is some kind of a
[1:10:57] thunder or some kind of a great
[1:10:58] revelation that nobody else don't have
[1:11:00] and try to
[1:11:02] if you think that's what brother dale's
[1:11:03] done
[1:11:06] i'm sorry for you amen
[1:11:09] i only try to preach what god reveals to
[1:11:11] me
[1:11:14] but
[1:11:17] you see
[1:11:19] the thunder is the voice of god
[1:11:24] that's what jesus said when he said
[1:11:27] it is this thunder now i've got these
[1:11:29] all written down your brain if you want
[1:11:30] them you can read my notes
[1:11:34] you know the story
[1:11:39] a voice from heaven spoke and said i'm
[1:11:41] glorified thy name and will glorified
[1:11:43] again they that stood by john 12 said
[1:11:45] heard it under it
[1:11:48] he heard a voice
[1:11:52] elijah one day was pulled back in a cave
[1:11:55] and he heard lightning
[1:11:58] wind
[1:12:01] he hurt thunder
[1:12:07] but he wouldn't get up walk out of the
[1:12:08] cave
[1:12:10] until he heard the still small voice
[1:12:15] am i right is that scripture
[1:12:21] the still small voice the prophet said
[1:12:23] that's what we need to hear
[1:12:25] he said that's god speaking in authority
[1:12:29] to you and i
[1:12:30] right
[1:12:31] a still small voice
[1:12:35] what does it matter whose voice is being
[1:12:37] used
[1:12:40] at the time
[1:12:47] are we listening to the voice are we
[1:12:49] listening to the still small voice that
[1:12:51] speaks with inside of us
[1:12:54] but remember voices are speaking outside
[1:12:56] of you
[1:12:58] can always be questioned
[1:13:01] lord spoke to me brother now told me
[1:13:09] is it contrary to the word that's right
[1:13:15] if it is then it wasn't god amen
[1:13:19] i don't care how much loud it got
[1:13:24] it thundered at mount sinai
[1:13:28] it scared the people to death
[1:13:30] but moses heard the voice of god
[1:13:39] they may have heard of lies going off
[1:13:41] out there in tucson
[1:13:54] have we heard his voice yes
[1:14:00] speaking to us by the revealing of the
[1:14:01] word
[1:14:03] are we just still listening for thunders
[1:14:06] and
[1:14:06] loud things and so and so
[1:14:13] elijah
[1:14:15] heard a still small voice right
[1:14:19] brother random heard a still small voice
[1:14:22] and then tried to tell us what that boy
[1:14:23] said to him
[1:14:25] thank god for that right
[1:14:29] but have you heard his voice
[1:14:32] speaking
[1:14:36] sister one time here years ago had a
[1:14:38] dream
[1:14:40] and she said brother dale said
[1:14:42] there was a voice in my dreams that it
[1:14:44] was speaking
[1:14:46] about the sick seal and bringing it down
[1:14:48] in the dream and telling what it was
[1:14:53] she said then i realized it was your
[1:14:55] voice
[1:15:00] well you see
[1:15:06] does that make anything out of you no
[1:15:09] if it did the donkey got just as much
[1:15:12] and the rooster too
[1:15:15] right are you in the bible
[1:15:17] you know a donkey spoke to a prophet one
[1:15:19] day
[1:15:25] it don't matter about what's speaking
[1:15:27] that's what's revealed
[1:15:31] that's why i asked the man i said
[1:15:35] what would cause you to stand in law
[1:15:43] for god to reveal the plan of redemption
[1:15:45] to me
[1:15:47] because you see the prophet didn't say
[1:15:49] he said they silence in heaven he didn't
[1:15:51] say they were silenced on earth
[1:15:53] if you go ahead and read the rest of
[1:15:55] what i
[1:15:56] was there in chapter five you'll find
[1:15:58] out in a few minutes they started
[1:16:00] rejoicing that all of those people are
[1:16:02] screaming and hollering and they're
[1:16:03] having a glory hallelujah time what
[1:16:06] after the lamb took the book right
[1:16:10] not before
[1:16:12] right
[1:16:15] after the lamb took the book heaven went
[1:16:17] to rejoice
[1:16:18] that's
[1:16:19] john said everything on earth hurt him
[1:16:22] yeah so it must have been transmitted
[1:16:24] down right
[1:16:26] so it must be right that the prophet
[1:16:28] said it was given to
[1:16:32] john
[1:16:35] and john handed it down right amen come
[1:16:39] on you say no i said i ain't your which
[1:16:40] one you want
[1:16:43] and the angel give it to john and john
[1:16:45] give it to
[1:16:46] an angel how many angels you want what
[1:16:49] do you want to deal with it
[1:16:51] just get the point
[1:16:54] if john hadn't wrote it down it couldn't
[1:16:56] have been transmitted to earth right
[1:16:59] but then once it comes to earth
[1:17:04] and just for a split second god revealed
[1:17:06] something to you
[1:17:07] you're standing in heavenly places
[1:17:13] amen
[1:17:16] think on these things
[1:17:18] what do these seals and things mean to
[1:17:20] you
[1:17:26] what about the rejoicing
[1:17:34] see i've been in a revival ever since i
[1:17:35] came in this message
[1:17:38] i hear everybody else talk about revival
[1:17:41] no you just don't know what you're
[1:17:42] talking about you ought to say as far as
[1:17:44] i'm concerned or revival
[1:17:47] don't say it's over with for everybody
[1:17:52] i just got started in one when i heard
[1:17:54] this message
[1:17:56] because revival to me is not shouting
[1:17:58] glory hallelujah and hoopla that's
[1:18:00] wonderful that's after effects
[1:18:04] revival is when
[1:18:06] god is revealing his word
[1:18:10] and i'm saying thank you lord
[1:18:15] so there's silence in heaven when he
[1:18:17] looks down
[1:18:19] those in heaven are looking down right
[1:18:21] now
[1:18:24] come on do you want me to get in the
[1:18:27] prophet's message with it he said mom
[1:18:29] was looking over the banister this
[1:18:30] morning
[1:18:33] he wants to do that
[1:18:36] they know the thunders will sound for
[1:18:38] the thing pretty soon
[1:18:40] who's he talking about amen
[1:18:44] i know we'll do it with the two
[1:18:45] witnesses to the
[1:18:47] israel
[1:18:49] and i know we've had a rejoicing time
[1:18:51] bringing it to the gentiles don't you
[1:18:54] but what about you and i receiving the
[1:18:56] same message by way of the prophet
[1:19:00] that the same voice of god is speaking
[1:19:03] right
[1:19:06] amen see they took where brother around
[1:19:09] and says thousands of little voices
[1:19:11] thundering out which is in the church
[1:19:13] age book right
[1:19:15] and they made a doctrine called the
[1:19:17] seventh under virtue
[1:19:21] but you see that was before the seal
[1:19:23] never broke
[1:19:28] over the thousands of live forces i
[1:19:30] think there ought to be thousands who
[1:19:31] live foreign
[1:19:36] if god ever speaks to your heart
[1:19:39] my revelation
[1:19:44] you'll know
[1:19:45] that's right
[1:19:48] see what does it matter about the vessel
[1:19:50] that's used
[1:19:52] amen as long as the ultimate end is
[1:19:55] reached that's right
[1:19:58] a good old baptist brother preached all
[1:20:00] you do and word indeed do all in the
[1:20:02] name of jesus christ
[1:20:05] and i said thank you lord i'm going to
[1:20:07] the water
[1:20:08] because i can get there
[1:20:13] as quick as i can get with brother
[1:20:15] molten say i'm ready come on let's get
[1:20:17] in the water
[1:20:19] the good old bag is creepy
[1:20:26] what does it matter about the dumb
[1:20:27] donkeys and the things you know
[1:20:31] as god spoke to our hearts go ahead what
[1:20:33] are we gonna we're gonna
[1:20:35] try this little pores
