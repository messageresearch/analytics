[0:54] always said it's something so precious
[0:56] as soon as you get it you want to give
[0:58] it away that's a paradox in your mind in
[1:00] your mind you'd think more no remember
[1:02] we're preaching on selfish a little bit
[1:04] here you know you're a little selfish
[1:05] when somebody gives you something you
[1:07] know it's mine
[1:09] no when God gives you something first
[1:11] thing you want to do is give it away
[1:12] amen because that's just part of of the
[1:15] giving heart that he gave his life for
[1:17] me and you it's only a small portion

[3:23] minutes or something okay all right
[3:27] not gonna happen
[3:29] all right remember brother Bob will be
[3:31] speaking for us this Wednesday night I
[3:33] remember the Bethel Youth Camp coming up
[3:35] the 27th through the 30th
[3:37] that is one of the questions that one of
[3:39] the youth asked is
[3:40] how to approach youth camps which is a
[3:44] good question all right what you know
[3:46] let's see what are they for what are
[3:47] they good for why should they go and and
[3:49] all that so we'll answer that this
[3:51] afternoon now there'll be there'll be no
[3:53] bible study on the fifth we we're now
[3:56] getting into heading into November
[3:58] because
[4:00] there will be a wedding the next day on
[4:03] Sunday at four o'clock
[4:07] Lily and Zach make sure you RSVP if
[4:09] you're going no kids under 15.
[4:12] there'll be no bible study on the fifth
[4:13] also remember change the clocks
[4:16] that Saturday fall backwards on November
[4:19] the 5th fall back one hour you get one
[4:21] hour extra sleep
[4:23] all right so it'd be only one service on
[4:25] the sixth then at four o'clock there'll
[4:27] be a wedding then on November the 13th
[4:29] it'll be the church dinner and then I
[4:31] think the first Sunday of December is
[4:33] when we're going to have our church
[4:34] Christmas dinner so if anybody's got a a
[4:38] play or anything that we're gonna that
[4:40] some of you kids want to do

[4:45] it it's very early in December it won't
[4:47] be close to the 25th it'd be very early
[4:50] so we need to get it done that means
[4:52] that's only about
[4:54] seven weeks away
[4:57] so just remember that and also after
[4:59] this service

[5:04] the youth will practice a song before

[5:08] the song get it done all right
[5:09] immediately after the service everybody
[5:12] got that say Amen all right and just
[5:15] remember each one in prayers one's a
[5:17] sick good to see sister Freedom back
[5:18] good to see brother Paul back with us
[5:19] and good to have everybody here
[5:23] helping out alert so let's go to
[5:27] John 1 1 where we've been
[5:30] before and I was
[5:32] studying a little bit last night and
[5:34] continuing on but something struck me
[5:36] just a few minutes ago so we're going to
[5:38] uh
[5:40] anybody ever said
[5:43] it's all in your head
[5:48] it's all in your head oh come on man
[5:50] it's all in your head
[5:51] we're gonna talk about that a little bit
[5:55] because remember
[5:56] memory reason conscious affection and
[5:59] Imagination comes from where
[6:01] your head
[6:03] you're stinking thinking but I'm going
[6:06] to read you here in a few minutes that
[6:07] we got to have a renewing of your mind
[6:09] or we must have the mind of Christ so
[6:11] something's got to transfer when we
[6:14] start with these virtues it's got to be
[6:16] something so abnormal
[6:19] from what your everyday
[6:21] oh we got to be virtuous we got to stay
[6:23] a virgin that's fine
[6:25] but that doesn't it's not what that
[6:26] virtue means that means power that means
[6:28] strength that means something coming
[6:29] from you that means Silver and Gold Have
[6:31] I None yeah but such as I have give I
[6:34] unto thee look how selfish unselfish
[6:37] Peter and John were such as I have give
[6:40] unto you that's where we talk we're
[6:43] going to talk about that we got to get
[6:44] our mindset first because remember we
[6:47] know one thing's for sure your flesh is
[6:48] never perfect we know that I've told you
[6:50] that taught you that many many times it
[6:52] doesn't sin it's motivated by what's
[6:55] inside of you now listen this was born
[6:57] in sin and it's going to die if we don't
[6:58] take a body change but that doesn't have
[7:01] anything to do with your soul that's
[7:03] right and if your soul is redeemed and
[7:05] then we get the memory reasons conscious
[7:08] infection imagination heading toward God
[7:09] then the flesh will have to become under
[7:12] subjection to that
[7:14] because now your flesh is under
[7:16] subjection because you said you didn't
[7:17] want to come to church
[7:18] you took your flesh somewhere else amen
[7:22] you took your flesh somewhere else you
[7:24] held a beer with this hand not a Bible
[7:25] right but now what happened the one
[7:28] inside of you were changed was changed
[7:32] to bring us to a
[7:34] not just a it's all in your head
[7:38] and it's not just so much but it is a
[7:40] mental adjustment we've all got to come
[7:42] to a mental adjustment from being humans
[7:45] to being Eternal in the same body all
[7:48] right we got to learn to separate it we
[7:49] gotta learn how to put it back together
[7:50] because that's what these virtues are
[7:52] amen that's living through your spirit
[7:55] realm to get to the outside guy all
[7:57] right to get to where the moving part is
[7:59] all right so we'll speak about that in
[8:02] just a little while let's buy our hands
[8:04] Lord thank you for this day we ask you
[8:05] just be with us
[8:07] help the ones that are sick Lord the
[8:09] ones that are not with us the ones that
[8:10] are traveling maybe still be on vacation
[8:13] we ask the Lord to just be with each one
[8:15] father just anoint us for this journey
[8:17] that we're on
[8:18] Lord we're not going to leave anybody
[8:19] behind Lord we want everybody to go with
[8:21] us father we pray that you would just
[8:23] give us spiritual Insight We Are
[8:26] Spiritual people
[8:27] Lord you told us that we love revelation
[8:30] so father reveal yourself to us today
[8:33] Lord beyond anything else reveal
[8:35] yourself through the word of God just be
[8:37] with the ones Lord that are not here the
[8:40] ones that are sending sick father we
[8:42] pray that should be with each one Lord
[8:44] and just bring them back to you father
[8:46] we're praying for all of the ones our
[8:48] our wayward children and loved ones and
[8:50] different ones Lord we're praying
[8:51] earnestly
[8:52] because that door is going to shut on
[8:54] that Ark and you're going to shut it
[8:55] Lord we're not going to be able to do it
[8:57] you're going to be able to be the one
[8:58] that shuts it but it's got to come when
[9:00] we come to a place where we can say it's
[9:02] not all in our head that it is become a
[9:05] reality father we pray that you'll just
[9:07] bless us now and take care of us in
[9:08] Jesus name in the further of this
[9:09] service amen in the beginning was word
[9:12] words with God and Word was God and the
[9:14] Word was made flesh that's what we're
[9:16] trying to get the word was made flesh
[9:18] right but by Listen by the transforming
[9:20] power of God he's turned he's turning
[9:22] your flesh when we take a body change
[9:24] folks it's not going to be a body from
[9:26] your mom and daddy
[9:28] this did but it's going to be changed
[9:31] something's going to be changed and the
[9:33] atoms of your body and you're going to
[9:35] become the word just as Jesus is now the
[9:38] fullness of the word made flesh in a
[9:40] glorified body thereby waiting me that's
[9:41] what we're heading toward we're not
[9:42] heading toward anything else that's what
[9:45] we have a mandate in this end time is to
[9:47] have a body change
[9:49] nothing else
[9:50] all right you say oh bro
[9:53] nothing else
[9:55] listen if it wasn't for the opening of
[9:57] those seals in 1963 I'll read it to you
[10:01] in a few minutes the greatest battle
[10:02] ever fought he said now the battle
[10:04] begins
[10:05] now is when the battle begins today is
[10:09] when the battle is going to begin what
[10:10] the battle for a body change nobody's
[10:12] ever conquered it
[10:14] but a bride's going to conquer it we're
[10:16] going to give the equipment to do it
[10:17] with and what is it is the word of God
[10:19] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[10:21] among us and we helped beheld his glory
[10:22] the glory the only begotten of the
[10:24] father
[10:24] full of grace
[10:26] and truth you may be seated in Lorde's
[10:28] blessing
[10:29] to the reading of the word
[10:31] foreign
[10:33] let's read first Thessalonians there
[10:34] while you're getting your seat suggested
[10:37] and all warm and cozy and
[10:39] yeah I don't fall asleep that every one
[10:42] of you should hey Kay while you standing
[10:44] here here I'll give these out
[10:49] there's about 50 of them so don't give
[10:51] everybody if there's a family let you
[10:52] know like sister Rebecca and sister
[10:54] um
[10:55] whatever her name is let them watch I'm
[10:58] horrible sorry sister Anna it's just a
[11:01] it's just an uncommon name Anna
[11:04] that every one of you should know how to
[11:06] possess his Vestal look in
[11:07] sanctification honor you're going to be
[11:09] possessed by something
[11:10] so let's be possessed by God all right
[11:13] you're going to be possessed by
[11:15] something we've read that many many
[11:16] times so let's go to Romans 12. be not
[11:19] conformed to this world but be what
[11:21] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[11:25] that what that you got to do something
[11:26] not just while I'm I'm here no you got
[11:29] to prove you're going to prove to Satan
[11:31] that you can live a Christian Life
[11:35] In the Flesh body
[11:37] exemplary
[11:39] not an imagination not something that's
[11:42] in your head it's going to be something
[11:45] that is a reality brother Branham when
[11:48] he told those visions and when he told
[11:50] those people you're from so and so and
[11:51] your name is so and so and you live on
[11:53] so-and-so street that was not
[11:55] imagination even though that did come
[11:57] from his mind
[11:59] it was a vision that was true and it had
[12:02] materialized either before or after he
[12:05] either says I saw you in the doctor or
[12:07] he said I see you so he was projected
[12:09] either both ways backwards and forward
[12:11] and you know what it came to pass so
[12:13] that made him real how many times did we
[12:15] have though an imagination in our mind
[12:17] and that thing never even come close to
[12:18] coming to pass
[12:21] they just didn't
[12:23] I had a dream the other night me and
[12:25] Thomas was doing something he's been
[12:26] with us all week and we I don't know how
[12:28] this thing came together but he was in a
[12:30] D.O.T truck
[12:32] Department of Transportation there were
[12:34] signs everywhere yield and stopped and
[12:36] you know and then the food then it went
[12:38] away
[12:39] well that dream I hope I don't know
[12:41] whether you're going to work for the dot
[12:43] or not but that dream it doesn't have a
[12:46] lot of validity I'm not going to put my
[12:48] I'm not gonna put everything I got
[12:52] Thomas no don't do that you go dude
[12:54] don't be a deal to you ain't nothing
[12:55] wrong being dealt but this
[12:59] we have dreams and imaginations
[13:01] but this is not a dream and an
[13:03] imagination
[13:04] this is going to come to pass this will
[13:07] materialize it has already materialized
[13:10] in the mind of God so being that it
[13:12] materialized in the mind of God
[13:14] okay if you got any left over too you
[13:16] got some left over but if anybody wants
[13:18] another copy you can have one it's going
[13:19] to be scriptures that we're going to
[13:21] read here in just a little while do not
[13:22] read it now
[13:23] read it in a little while but listen may
[13:25] you be transformed by the renewing of
[13:27] your mind listen to The Very life we
[13:30] live the very things that we say the
[13:32] very things that we do if we do it
[13:34] according to the word of God you will be
[13:36] different how many times have I told you
[13:38] that you're not going to say well I'm
[13:39] going to try to be different I don't
[13:41] want to be like the world no if you got
[13:42] the new birth you're heading in the
[13:44] direction and not be like the world
[13:45] because remember only the bride has the
[13:47] Holy Ghost that's right only the bride
[13:49] has the New Birth
[13:51] we got to get to
[13:53] a place to where
[13:57] God is going to separate us
[14:01] we're not if you try to separate
[14:02] yourself you just turn yourself away
[14:04] from God I believe
[14:05] but you just be who you are be the word
[14:07] of God for your day and you will be
[14:09] different Luther was the word of God for
[14:12] his day and he was different amen
[14:15] Wesley all the great ones when you see
[14:18] those men when you see those men come
[14:20] out of the world what made them
[14:22] different
[14:23] they're Doctrine
[14:25] they're preaching it made them different
[14:27] it put them in a book to where we could
[14:29] read a history about somebody amen
[14:32] so that's the same way with me and you
[14:33] because remember brother Brown said if
[14:35] another book will be written to be
[14:36] another book of Acts all right and then
[14:39] we are written Epistles known in red of
[14:41] all men we are written in this Bible all
[14:43] the way from as old black man said from
[14:45] Kimber to cover we're all the way we're
[14:47] we're the Holy Bible made manifest not
[14:50] just well y'all lived in the Old
[14:51] Testament we live the new I've heard
[14:53] that before you know and so have you
[14:56] I believe it's all right to live on both
[15:00] why are you excluding one or the other
[15:02] all right but you're going to prove
[15:04] what's that good and acceptable and
[15:06] perfect will of God
[15:07] Luke 8 verse 45 and Jesus said who
[15:10] touched me when all denied Peter said
[15:12] they were with him said Master the
[15:14] multitude throng the impressed and saith
[15:16] who touched me and Jesus said somebody
[15:18] hath touched me for I perceived that
[15:20] virtue that's that virtue on the pyramid
[15:22] has gone out of me I just wanted to read
[15:24] that to you because listen this
[15:26] afternoon if we get to it and we don't
[15:27] have any more questions there's a time
[15:29] where that woman touched His Garment and
[15:32] she got something right that was a there
[15:34] was a contact right but now there was a
[15:37] time though that when a gentile Soldier
[15:39] walked up to Jesus and never touched him
[15:42] never got close to him and said whatever
[15:45] you say that's what will happen
[15:47] whatever you say I'm a man of authority
[15:49] you're a man of authority what happened
[15:50] was that virtue that dunamis or that
[15:53] power went from Jesus right to that
[15:55] person and he was healed it wasn't that
[15:57] the it wasn't that the the Centurion or
[16:00] or the he was a gentile Roman soldier he
[16:02] had to have his hands laid on because
[16:04] you know what Jesus said the first thing
[16:05] we'll read it this afternoon maybe first
[16:07] thing Jesus said is okay I'll go
[16:09] look how good Jesus was okay I'll go and
[16:12] he said no I don't want you to go right
[16:14] you're a man of authority you don't in
[16:16] other words he he was a centurion he had
[16:18] 5200 men and he'd just give an order and
[16:21] he didn't have to go with the guy said
[16:23] all right come on you got to tell this
[16:24] guy right here no he give the order
[16:27] he stayed where he was at and he sent
[16:30] that order or that power went with what
[16:32] the messenger
[16:35] and that messenger is gave the order but
[16:38] the power behind it was well who'd that
[16:40] come from that comes from the Centurion
[16:42] who that comes that come from Brother
[16:43] Brown
[16:45] that come from Jesus Christ amen that's
[16:47] the authority and that's why I believe
[16:49] that brother Branham in the first part
[16:50] of his of his ministry remember it was
[16:53] not in the years of preparation it
[16:54] wasn't in the prayer lines it was that
[16:56] wasn't his message that was to get
[16:58] people to see that he was a prophet to
[17:01] see that he was a messenger of God so
[17:03] when he became the messenger of God all
[17:05] that background we could say that ain't
[17:07] nothing but the truth just like Eddie
[17:08] Wright did and that's what we're trying
[17:09] to do now we're trying to say that ain't
[17:11] nothing but the truth not putting the
[17:12] man on a pedestal listen God's going to
[17:14] do that
[17:15] God will give him we don't get God will
[17:18] give him everything
[17:19] give him crowns and and we give him
[17:21] accolades here and and we give him
[17:23] reverence here but he's not our savior
[17:25] but we know where our savior got
[17:27] spoken
[17:29] like no other man he spoke about Jesus
[17:32] Christ than any other man on the face of
[17:34] this Earth nobody understood him
[17:37] nobody's gonna understand you
[17:39] we're just going to be an oddity to the
[17:41] world Listen the world don't get born
[17:43] again like we do

[17:50] world don't act like we do so look let
[17:54] God do the separating you don't have to

[18:05] God or the devil want a house you say
[18:07] something and sell people get ill about
[18:09] it
[18:10] amen
[18:14] and it's not you a perfect man
[18:16] brother Bram said look that's the way it
[18:18] is to try to manufacture Christianity
[18:20] you can't do it the first thing you got
[18:23] to do is be born again all right so
[18:25] we've read this many times but I want
[18:27] that to sink in if you are not growing
[18:30] in virtue and knowledge and Temperance
[18:32] and patience please say God save my soul
[18:37] because that's where it's Gotta come
[18:39] from it's gonna come from that soul and
[18:41] Bloom out
[18:43] and if it what if it's dark it's going
[18:45] to bloom Darkness if it's light it's
[18:48] gonna Bloom light there is no in between
[18:50] there is no gray area there is no well
[18:52] I'll wait for a little while and and uh
[18:55] no
[18:57] you've got to be changed and when you're
[19:01] changed you become a new creation now
[19:03] you're getting right now you're getting
[19:05] right
[19:06] see now you don't have to worry about
[19:09] the feathers it'll take care of itself
[19:11] when you're born again yes sir now
[19:13] notice you must be born again that is
[19:15] what changed years there's got to be a
[19:18] change your body change started on the
[19:20] day you got born again amen and if you
[19:23] don't continue on it you're still born
[19:25] again you will come to your body change
[19:26] it's just you're gonna have to die
[19:29] a fleshly death
[19:32] to come back up in a resurrection you
[19:35] know what brother Brown said even about
[19:36] the foolish virgin they're gonna have to
[19:37] die give their life for the gospel and
[19:40] then come up in the resurrection and be
[19:41] given eternal life I don't want to do
[19:43] that
[19:43] I want to get it here thank you thank
[19:46] you brother dirty he said I don't want
[19:47] to do that either
[19:48] I want to get it now you know why
[19:50] because that gives you a you know how we
[19:53] always played Monopoly you always love
[19:56] that one card that says pass go collect
[20:00] 200 or or pass jail you don't have to go
[20:03] to jail
[20:04] we went past that we lays one over there
[20:06] in the corner that says death
[20:09] there's one that says death I want that
[20:11] past that says bypass amen bypass death
[20:14] and that's exactly we're in the game of
[20:16] life right well I want that card you've
[20:19] got it today
[20:20] it's called the baptism of the Holy
[20:22] Ghost and growing as brother Ram says in
[20:24] a few minutes that we just get started
[20:26] growing when we get born again not that
[20:28] we're already grown all right we're
[20:30] babies in Christ it's not bad to be a
[20:32] baby it's bad to stay a baby
[20:35] Romans or Hebrews 6 is therefore leaving
[20:37] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[20:39] as we were talking now the other day let
[20:41] us go on into Perfection not laying
[20:43] against the foundation of repentance
[20:45] from dead works and a faith toward God
[20:47] see that's what had happened down
[20:48] through the church ages
[20:51] get born again
[20:53] live a good Christian Life
[20:55] die human death
[20:57] go over in the sixth dimension
[20:59] waiting for what waiting for the body
[21:01] change
[21:02] but somebody the Bible says according to
[21:05] Paul says we which are alive and remain
[21:07] to the coming of the Lord shall not
[21:08] prevent or hinder those which are asleep
[21:09] but the trumpet of God's trumpet is
[21:12] sounding
[21:13] didn't cross your eyes first
[21:15] and we which are alive and remain will
[21:17] be changed all right so that's the part
[21:19] I want to say I don't and and and we got
[21:22] to get off this Foundation
[21:25] to come to a place where God can use us
[21:27] of the doctrine of baptism laying on our
[21:29] hands Resurrection the dead of Eternal
[21:31] judgment look and this will we do if God
[21:33] permits amen listen God sent an end time
[21:36] Messenger to permit you to do that amen
[21:40] he didn't just open the seals he opened
[21:42] the whole Bible he opened the whole way
[21:44] he was supporter he was the one that
[21:47] stood in the door and said hey come in
[21:49] it's for you I don't care about me it's
[21:51] for you
[21:52] build it for you
[21:55] that's where you get to that selfishness
[21:57] brother Brown was the most selfless not
[21:59] selfish selfless person there ever was
[22:01] because everything he got he gave it to
[22:02] us amen I like what brother Claude said
[22:04] one time brother Brown said one time he
[22:06] said I just can't keep a secret well
[22:07] thank God he didn't keep a secret what
[22:10] he kept was for him but what was for me
[22:12] and you he's just kept telling us and
[22:13] get
[22:14] even the angel said hey quit explaining
[22:16] it
[22:18] you know what he was saying in his mind
[22:20] they're babies they gotta understand
[22:22] what I'm saying yeah because the angel
[22:25] said look just tell them and if they
[22:26] don't like it don't worry about it
[22:28] but he was a human being
[22:31] and he had what the most unselfish
[22:33] motive in the world is to get a people
[22:35] ready
[22:37] Ephesians 4 11 said he gave some
[22:38] Apostles and then what did he do he give
[22:40] it to me and you he didn't keep it to
[22:41] himself
[22:43] he gave it some Apostles prophets
[22:45] evangelists pastors and teachers what
[22:46] for the Perfection of the Saints amen
[22:48] for the work of the ministry for the
[22:50] edifying of the body of Christ look till
[22:52] we all come to the unity of faith we
[22:55] can't do that brother wait well the
[22:56] Bible says we can yeah
[22:58] the Bible says we will all right and of
[23:02] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[23:04] perfect man until the measure of the
[23:05] Statue of the fullness of Christ and
[23:07] that's what this is behind me is the
[23:09] stature of Christ the fullness that we
[23:12] henceforth be no more children
[23:15] babies
[23:17] amen
[23:19] I want us to realize
[23:22] when we say something that brother
[23:23] Branham said it's like brother Dale said
[23:25] he always said he said Paul says if I
[23:27] become your enemy because I told you the
[23:29] truth
[23:29] the truth of the matter is brother Rob
[23:31] says every time you come to the altar
[23:32] you get weaker
[23:34] you want me to bring you that coil I've
[23:36] already read it two or three times here
[23:38] the more you come to the altar the
[23:40] weaker you get
[23:44] I'm just telling you what he said wow we
[23:46] need to grow up not be children
[23:48] every little thing
[23:54] you know why don't you don't go to God
[23:56] yourself because you're not right
[23:57] somewhere
[23:59] sorry
[24:01] didn't mean to hurt your feelings but
[24:03] look tossed to and fro and carried away
[24:06] with every wind of Doctrine you see
[24:08] people leaving and come back leave when
[24:10] they come back
[24:13] look by the slide of men preachers
[24:17] preachers
[24:18] where'd you get your Doctrine somebody
[24:20] told you that from the pulpit where'd
[24:22] you get to where you can cut your hair
[24:23] out in the world the preacher behind the
[24:25] pulpit said oh that's just Old Testament
[24:27] stuff we're living in the New Testament
[24:29] and he needs to read his Bible because
[24:30] it's in the New Testament
[24:32] about her hairs her glory amen by the
[24:35] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[24:37] whereby they lie in weight to deceive
[24:39] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[24:42] up into him in all things which is the
[24:44] head even Christ for whom also the whole
[24:46] body fitley joined together and
[24:49] compacted I told brother Joe that we
[24:51] would come and pray just a few minutes
[24:52] ago I said I'm just glad everybody got
[24:54] together back together I don't like it
[24:57] when the body's scatters I scattered man
[24:59] all different ones you know Aaron and
[25:00] him they were scattered not scattered
[25:02] sheep well maybe
[25:05] but we scattered but we come back and
[25:07] you come back together and it's like
[25:09] it's safety
[25:10] with sheep their safety and numbers what
[25:13] does Satan do he tries to cut one of you
[25:15] what cut one of you out of the herd you
[25:18] watch them you watch go watch a document
[25:20] of lions and tigers and different ones
[25:22] they'll find one weak
[25:24] they'll find one that's limping just a
[25:26] little bit to find one that kind of gets
[25:29] away from the herd a little bit guess
[25:30] what that's the one they go after so
[25:33] that's the one Satan sends the hounds of
[25:34] Hell after is that one is kind of
[25:36] separated herself out somewhere else I
[25:38] don't know where that came from but
[25:40] it was worth something for him the whole
[25:42] body fatally joined together and
[25:43] compacted today we're compacted back
[25:47] together right by that which every joint
[25:49] supplies according to the effectual
[25:50] working in the measure of every part
[25:52] making the increase of the body of the
[25:54] edifying of itself in love now we see
[25:57] that we're not got to that son of man
[25:59] part yet we're right here where it says
[26:00] the Son of God we now have the new birth
[26:03] we now are starting with what the faith
[26:06] of God he's given to you so now it's
[26:07] your faith yes now bye with me it's your
[26:10] faith all right brother Brown said this
[26:12] is my eye God gave it to me so because
[26:13] it says that to your faith didn't say it
[26:16] had to be God's faith and said that to
[26:17] your faith and to your faith virtue in
[26:19] all this Temperance of the Son of God so
[26:22] now we're off of that we got to get off
[26:25] that foundation and we will
[26:27] and he said unto them if any would come
[26:29] after me let him deny himself and take
[26:30] up his cross it's just something I want
[26:32] to remind you remember this is a
[26:33] cross-bearing group of people amen it's
[26:36] not somebody that you give it to the
[26:38] preacher and you give it to you know
[26:40] brother Branham or you give it to the
[26:42] priest and well they'll carry it for me
[26:43] no you got to carry your own cross and
[26:46] it might be rough that old cross you
[26:48] know it's called an Old Rugged Cross for
[26:50] a reason they didn't sit there and shine
[26:52] it up like this right here
[26:55] no they heated out of a round log and it
[26:57] probably has splinters that's long
[26:59] sticking out of it and that's the way it
[27:01] is with me and you you me and you in
[27:03] life I'm sorry that may not be deep but
[27:05] this is a life lesson yes
[27:07] for whosoever will save his life shall
[27:09] lose it there we go with selfishness but
[27:11] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[27:13] the same will save it then Paul tells us
[27:16] that you need to Die daily there's
[27:18] something in your life that needs to die
[27:20] every day
[27:23] 365 demons needed to die
[27:26] in your life
[27:28] much less mind in somebody else's life
[27:31] all right
[27:32] and I like this scripture I've come to
[27:34] learn it a little bit more
[27:36] we're so is the will of God that with
[27:38] well-doing
[27:39] with well doing you may put to silence
[27:42] the ignorance of foolish men listen you
[27:45] don't have to say you're foolish and
[27:46] you're ignorant just live the life
[27:48] you're gonna like I said you're going to
[27:49] be different you're going to be country
[27:50] you're going to think different you're
[27:52] going to act different you're going to
[27:53] talk different so you put your put to
[27:56] silence the ignorance the foolish man
[27:58] there'll come a time when those foolish
[28:00] virgins
[28:01] foolish men
[28:04] are going to come to who to get oil
[28:06] the ones that have it
[28:08] they're not going to go back to the
[28:10] denomination try to get it come on
[28:11] somebody they're going to what come to
[28:13] somebody they think they knows got it
[28:15] through
[28:17] and that's got to be the bride amen for
[28:20] strollers the will of God with
[28:21] well-doing you may put to silence how
[28:23] are we going to put to silence the
[28:24] ignorance of foolish men we are going to
[28:26] what come to this what now we've got to
[28:29] come to full Doctrine
[28:31] full Doctrine
[28:34] not just parked
[28:36] full Doctrine
[28:38] I like good shouty meetings I do too
[28:40] where we just clap our hands and shout
[28:42] and have a good time there's a place for
[28:44] all that have great powerful services
[28:46] and things dance on the bubble as it
[28:47] were but now what is he saying he said
[28:49] all right come back here though
[28:51] but wait then when The Showdown time
[28:54] comes that's when you and the devil are
[28:56] toe to toe and you don't have that
[28:57] atmosphere you don't have that bubble
[28:59] dancing you don't have that uh anointing
[29:01] that that makes you feel good it just
[29:03] gets you all warm no you may be outside
[29:05] on the backside of a desert somewhere
[29:07] like Jesus was by itself for 40 days
[29:09] didn't have nothing to eat or drink that
[29:12] was kind of a miracle you can't live
[29:13] without so many days without water amen
[29:15] the Bible said he didn't have
[29:18] bread or water
[29:19] but wait then when The Showdown time
[29:21] comes you don't know where you're
[29:23] standing
[29:25] come on you went out and had a good time
[29:27] in the meeting that was good that was
[29:28] shouting that was whatever speaking in
[29:30] tongues you got hands laid on you got
[29:32] prayed for same way we're talking about
[29:33] we're going to talk about that a little
[29:34] bit about youth camps tonight
[29:36] but you gotta know where you're standing
[29:38] at your home Church your day-to-day your
[29:41] home wherever you're living at where
[29:43] you're working at you got to know where
[29:45] you're standing let's go back and find
[29:47] out let's find out what's making us do
[29:50] that
[29:50] let's get back to the foundation see
[29:54] where we're at that's what we're doing
[29:55] now we want the open book but have we
[29:58] got all of our eyes open
[30:00] oh
[30:04] preach it somebody oh we live in that
[30:06] open brother we gotta open but we're
[30:09] hoping but well there are both of our
[30:10] eyes open
[30:12] are we living that open book because you
[30:15] know what if it was closed you can have
[30:17] a little bit of ignorance
[30:19] and you'll get by with it because the
[30:21] book's closed
[30:24] but if that book's open and you have
[30:25] full access
[30:30] that's it
[30:33] what's your excuse
[30:42] that it's not something you're thinking
[30:43] about no it's the word of God yeah amen
[30:47] we'll read it tonight the Bible says
[30:49] cast down imagination
[30:54] we got to do that
[30:56] now look it says it's easy to feel the
[30:58] power of God to see when you believe but
[31:00] when it comes to The Showdown are you
[31:02] able to possess the thing that you
[31:04] profess to have we're in time bride
[31:07] we're uh and you hear it all over the
[31:09] message where we're in the message of
[31:12] the son of man well they don't even
[31:13] can't even get the Son of God right most
[31:15] of them
[31:19] are they making a two Soul seven Thunder
[31:21] virtue they're making this they make him
[31:23] wanting God to the River Jordan
[31:26] come on people are you able to possess
[31:29] the thing that you profess to have
[31:30] that's the thing brother we've got to
[31:32] get it you've got to take it it's yours
[31:34] but you'll fight for every inch of it so
[31:38] it's a fight remember it's a battleship
[31:40] not a cruise ship
[31:43] I love going cruise ships they're just
[31:45] really nice but boy could you imagine
[31:48] being in a battleship in the middle of a
[31:49] battle
[31:50] you got all them guns blaring and you
[31:52] got somebody with a 50 caliber doing
[31:54] this and you got uh airplanes diving
[31:56] trying to kill you
[31:58] Devil's trying to kill you but God has
[32:01] given you the equipment we're going to
[32:02] talk about a little bit later on there
[32:04] is no way that the United States of
[32:07] America is going to send their
[32:09] soldiers to war
[32:11] with a toothpick that's right and a and
[32:14] a butter knife
[32:16] and just a loincloth
[32:19] no
[32:20] they're gonna put everything in a can on
[32:23] him they're gonna train him forever how
[32:25] many weeks a lot of you been in the
[32:27] military you know they didn't just
[32:28] brother Johnny they didn't say oh you're
[32:29] in the military here you need to go
[32:30] fight no you die the first day
[32:33] so God has equipped us for this battle
[32:35] before the battle even begins
[32:39] we're all tried every Christian every
[32:42] son every child that comes to God is
[32:43] Tried by the word he's tried by the word
[32:46] he's not tried by your enemy
[32:49] he's tried by the word of God
[32:53] to see if you'll be loyal to it they're
[32:56] loyal
[32:58] well I think I might well I think I
[33:00] might not
[33:01] know you got to be loyal to it when The
[33:04] Showdown comes what decision are you
[33:06] going to make that's it he that cannot
[33:09] stand chastisement but goes on with the
[33:11] world he's an illegitimate child
[33:15] and not a son and daughter of God
[33:16] certainly not but the spiritual minded
[33:21] we're talking about mine today the
[33:23] spiritual minded
[33:25] catches the word
[33:28] lines up with it sister Hattie Wright
[33:30] that ain't nothing but the truth
[33:32] and the spirit comes down under the shed
[33:36] blood and takes that person take me Lord
[33:39] yes that's what you ought to say this
[33:41] morning take me Lord wherever you're
[33:43] going to take me take me
[33:46] paradox 1964.
[33:48] I like this quote some of you
[33:51] giggled at it and so did I when I first
[33:52] read it but it's very true
[33:54] it was a paradox when the Hebrew
[33:56] children was thrown into the fiery
[33:57] furnace how the three men could walk
[33:59] into a furnace so hot that the intense
[34:02] heat even kill the men that were pushing
[34:03] them in and yet they've stayed in that
[34:05] it only delivered them now he's going to
[34:07] explain it that's the only thing it did
[34:09] see it delivered them from the bounds
[34:12] that they were bound with it was a
[34:13] paradox
[34:14] you understand what he's saying they
[34:16] thought it was going to be the end of
[34:18] their life they were bound up with
[34:19] change or whatever it was it didn't
[34:21] matter if it was Fetters and they were
[34:23] doing this and they were heading toward
[34:25] this thing it was a glowing red hot and
[34:26] they probably could feel the heat at one
[34:28] time but all of a sudden there was a
[34:30] cool breeze went by
[34:32] now when the Cool Breeze went by and
[34:35] they just said all right we're good
[34:37] walked right on in and they watched the
[34:39] they watched the Rope
[34:41] brother John at that hot it just
[34:44] disintegrated those ropes
[34:45] turned them to ashes
[34:47] so what bound them the situation they
[34:50] were in the hotness of the battle or the
[34:54] Heat or the heat of the oven it's what
[34:57] delivered them that's what's going to
[34:58] deliver me and you the heat of the
[35:00] battle it's what's going to deliver me
[35:02] and you sometimes in our own lives that
[35:05] Paradox repeats sometimes you're brought
[35:07] to a showdown where you have to make a
[35:09] decision listen God's gonna make us make
[35:12] a decision whether it's the foolishness
[35:13] of preaching or where if you hear it
[35:15] from Brother random or you read it in
[35:16] the Bible you're going to come to a
[35:18] place to where you're going to have to
[35:19] make a decision
[35:21] you have to stand on that decision
[35:23] though like they did and it all works
[35:25] together for the good what did it do it
[35:27] never hurt them it loosed them the
[35:29] battle that you fought should loose you
[35:31] not hurt you
[35:33] because if we're children of God
[35:35] we're going to be put into situations by
[35:39] God
[35:42] by God
[35:44] to try you I just read that quote to try
[35:46] you
[35:49] Abraham
[35:52] go kill your son the one I gave you by
[35:55] promise
[35:56] go kill him
[35:58] and he didn't just do it in an instant
[36:00] he had he made Isaac get the wood they
[36:04] traveled so many miles
[36:07] Isaac put the wood on his shoulder he
[36:09] said no we're going to make a sacrifice
[36:10] today
[36:11] we're going we're going to try to get to
[36:13] church
[36:17] Abraham says we'll be back in a little
[36:19] while
[36:20] me and the boy
[36:22] look at the faith me and the boy
[36:25] are going to go worship and me and the
[36:27] boy will bring our amen body change
[36:31] that's what you got to look at there was
[36:33] a change when Abraham went up there he
[36:35] was going to kill that guy which was his
[36:37] son
[36:41] and he come down and when he come down
[36:43] that angel went
[36:45] and what what did what did the Bible say
[36:47] the Bible says God said now I know now
[36:51] God all knowing
[36:54] God knew before the foundation of the
[36:56] world
[36:57] now I know Abraham that you're my son
[37:00] you're my child no well we know that was
[37:03] what he said but what he was really
[37:05] saying was Abraham
[37:07] you know
[37:10] what you are and what you're going to be
[37:12] he let Abraham know
[37:15] sometimes we're caught in that position
[37:17] first thing you've got to do like the
[37:19] man drowning in the river you got to get
[37:21] the man out of the river before he can
[37:23] get the river out of the man
[37:25] come on yeah that's something what a man
[37:28] has to do it comes out and makes him
[37:30] stand get the thing out and get him out
[37:33] of the thing so he can get the thing out
[37:35] of him
[37:37] that's what we're looking at we you say
[37:39] I don't have a demon in me well that's
[37:40] the first demon you need to get out
[37:43] everybody with me
[37:47] you need to get the line devil off of
[37:49] you first
[37:51] everybody with me if I hurt your
[37:54] feelings sorry
[37:55] but we all we all have demons
[37:58] everybody's got them it's just how you
[38:01] handle them everybody with me look now
[38:05] there's a perfect way listen to this
[38:06] there's a perfect way and a permissive
[38:09] will we know that all right there's a
[38:10] perfect way God wants to do and there's
[38:12] a permissive will he'll allow you to go
[38:13] this way just to show you that he's boss
[38:17] all right and I feel that if God here on
[38:20] the platform I'll listen to this can
[38:23] show me things that has been and in my
[38:26] rooms and so forth now what you talking
[38:27] about he's talking about private
[38:28] interviews
[38:30] remember he had private interviews they
[38:32] come in and God would actually answer
[38:34] the question before the people would get
[38:36] there so I got four questions brother
[38:37] Graham said okay ask him and brother man
[38:39] I'm gonna take out a sheet of paper and
[38:40] say look here's your answer God's
[38:43] already told me the question now what is
[38:44] that that's the mind of God that can't
[38:46] be the mind of man so there had to be
[38:48] that builds your faith to believe that
[38:51] brother Brian was a mouthpiece of God he
[38:53] was and had the mind of Christ that's
[38:55] what Paul said we had to have a long
[38:57] time ago
[38:58] can show me things that has been in my
[39:01] rooms and so forth he's able to tell me
[39:03] just where he wants me and what he wants
[39:06] me to do look how submissive but I feel
[39:09] as long as I've got it all hooked up
[39:11] watch this I feel like then he won't put
[39:14] his hand on it as long as I'm doing it
[39:18] wow
[39:20] watch this right here
[39:22] and that's the way it is with anything
[39:25] as long as you're gonna do it if someone
[39:28] talks about you and you talk back about
[39:30] them oh that hurt
[39:34] God can't fight your battle
[39:38] I'm gonna read it one more time
[39:40] if someone talks about you and you talk
[39:42] back about them
[39:44] what that's that selfish thing
[39:46] he said this about me so I'm gonna say
[39:48] this about him
[39:50] God can't fight your battle you're
[39:52] fighting it yourself
[39:53] everybody with me
[39:55] I want this to cut but cut real good
[39:57] look just let loose
[40:01] loose and just commit it to him that's
[40:03] what we've been doing come commit our
[40:05] kids to God commit her Wayward people to
[40:07] God just straight put them and listen
[40:09] whatever happens don't put your hand
[40:11] back on it
[40:13] take your hand off oh it's going to be
[40:16] rough
[40:17] as long as they make it
[40:19] if I'm with me
[40:21] look the greatest weapon
[40:25] that I know of a Christian today
[40:27] is a committal to God
[40:31] everybody believe brother Brown was a
[40:32] prophet all on this side does and this
[40:35] side doesn't
[40:36] well a few up here in the front I'm
[40:38] sorry those in the back are asleep the
[40:40] greatest weapon that I know of of a
[40:43] Christian today is a committal to God
[40:46] commit it to God
[40:47] because you know what we do we get our
[40:49] mind involved and we used to go through
[40:51] our memories of contraception
[40:52] imagination and think this is the way we
[40:55] want it done
[40:57] hold on a minute I'm sorry this is the
[40:59] way God ought to do it
[41:03] the Almighty omnipotent I'm the
[41:07] president omniscient Eternal we're
[41:10] trying to tell them how to do it
[41:13] the greatest weapon so listen you gotta
[41:15] have weapons because we're gonna end the
[41:17] battle brother Brandon we're going to
[41:18] talk about right here the greatest
[41:19] battle ever fought
[41:21] is it what a committal to God
[41:24] what a soldier does is he when he
[41:26] commits himself to the Army like brother
[41:27] Donnie and some of you there that were
[41:29] in service you committed yourself to an
[41:32] army that's supposed to be the best
[41:34] not the worst
[41:36] but you committed yourself that the
[41:39] United States would stand behind you and
[41:41] give you the best equipment made well
[41:43] what about this Army that we've got into
[41:45] now this Army of God if if America can
[41:49] equip their
[41:51] if America can equip and give them
[41:53] everything they need
[41:55] what about God Amen
[41:57] he already knows how the battle is going
[41:59] to go he already knows what equipment
[42:01] you need to get through the battle
[42:03] we're just guessing America's just
[42:05] guessing that's why America is going to
[42:07] get blown off the map
[42:09] we're just guessing
[42:11] when you can't do nothing about it just
[42:14] commit it to him
[42:15] and God will take care of it
[42:20] everybody with me greatest battle ever
[42:22] fought it was kind of my thought I was
[42:25] thinking on this other day we need a
[42:26] mental adjustment and that that phrase
[42:28] comes up it's all in your head so
[42:32] watch what happened
[42:34] so as an Army first and getting ready
[42:36] for a battle
[42:37] first there's got to be look select some
[42:40] soldiers
[42:41] not just everybody
[42:43] remember there's a process when you go
[42:45] up there they check your eyes they check
[42:46] your ears they check your nose they
[42:48] check your your joints they check how
[42:49] many of you been in the military
[42:51] okay well
[42:53] real recently
[42:55] um
[42:56] Sister Mary back there but you go
[42:58] through this thing and they start and I
[43:00] look it doesn't make you inferior but
[43:02] they weed out they want the best right
[43:04] right if you can't see
[43:06] you're not gonna be a pilot
[43:10] yeah
[43:12] disaster
[43:18] that's why I said people you're the best
[43:20] of the best if you got the new birth if
[43:22] you've got the new birth he's changed
[43:24] every bit of that he's brought you up to
[43:26] what first in line he's weeding out all
[43:28] the rest he's brought you up put you
[43:30] first in line give you the best
[43:32] equipment The Shield the swords
[43:34] come on somebody
[43:36] some soldiers select they've got to be
[43:39] dressed for fighting not for a picnic
[43:43] you dress a whole lot different to get
[43:45] on the battleship than you do a cruise
[43:47] ship
[43:48] yeah somebody
[43:50] you've got to be trained for fighting
[43:54] and I believe that the greatest battle
[43:56] that was ever fought
[43:58] is now 1962.
[44:01] 3 11
[44:04] 1962 almost exactly one year
[44:09] before the seals were preached in 1963
[44:11] in March
[44:13] he's telling them to get ready for a
[44:15] battle oh he fought many about listen
[44:18] what about a prophet that stood and he
[44:20] fought many battles 300 000 people got
[44:22] saved hundreds of of people got healed
[44:25] all these different things and now he
[44:27] said the Bible just now getting ready to
[44:28] be fought
[44:30] wow he knew that it would become
[44:33] spiritual and it would become that not
[44:36] everybody could make it
[44:38] because look it's now ready to go into
[44:41] action I believe that God has been
[44:44] selecting his soldiers
[44:46] I believe he's been dressing them
[44:49] training them and the Battlefront is now
[44:52] set getting ready to start where is it
[44:54] brother Branham
[44:56] there has to be a place selected you
[44:59] know they had to select a place for the
[45:01] Battle of Gettysburg they had to select
[45:03] them even there's a select place for the
[45:05] battle of Armageddon but people select
[45:08] places you just don't go in and start
[45:09] fighting randomly no you pick your place
[45:12] you pick your battle you pick your spot
[45:14] well the greatest battle ever fought we
[45:16] know where his ass in our mind that's
[45:18] why we're going to talk about here just
[45:19] for a few minutes if that's all right
[45:20] there has to be a place selected and
[45:23] this look there's a mutual ground
[45:27] both parties Mutual ground
[45:31] no man's land and they fight here at
[45:34] this place
[45:35] they just don't want fight over here one
[45:38] down over here one run over here there's
[45:40] a Battlefront where they meet and test
[45:43] their powers where each Army tests its
[45:45] strength against the other Army a mutual
[45:47] meeting place now look he said I don't
[45:49] miss this hey when this great battle
[45:52] started on Earth there had to be a
[45:54] mutual meeting place
[45:56] there had to be a place elected for the
[45:58] battle to begin for the battle to rage
[46:01] and that Battleground begins in the
[46:03] human mind
[46:06] not this
[46:08] not how much you can how much human
[46:10] knowledge or human tempers or human
[46:12] virtue you have is how much God
[46:14] knowledge God tempers God patience you
[46:17] have
[46:17] and that battle begins in the human mind
[46:20] there is where the Bible starts the
[46:22] human mind was chosen for the place of
[46:25] battle where it was begin and that is
[46:27] because that decisions are made from the
[46:31] mind the head
[46:34] now they never started it from some
[46:36] organization
[46:37] they never started it from some
[46:39] mechanical affair the grounds never
[46:41] started there therefore that
[46:42] organization can never never do the
[46:45] works of God
[46:46] because the Battleground where you've
[46:48] got to meet your enemy is in the mine
[46:50] yeah
[46:51] you've got to make your choice it meets
[46:54] you yes yeah
[46:56] you got to make a choice
[46:59] now let's look
[47:01] that's what the phrase it's all in your
[47:03] head
[47:05] oh man come on that's all in your head
[47:08] what do you mean this on it's all in
[47:10] your head it's on you it's all in your
[47:12] head let me read you this now you've got
[47:14] your we're going to read scriptures
[47:17] I want you to read I'm gonna read this
[47:18] to you
[47:21] what does it's all in your head mean
[47:24] all right Shake Yourself wake up just a
[47:26] little bit
[47:28] look at least look alive
[47:31] some of y'all are paying eyeballs on the
[47:32] back of your eyelids so you I think
[47:34] you're awake
[47:38] they'd be putting on makeup wouldn't it
[47:46] listen we know that the body is weak the
[47:49] flesh
[47:51] but but as a minister of the gospel and
[47:55] the others that come here and preach it
[47:57] just it tears in our heart that this
[47:59] doesn't excite you
[48:02] and you let that override
[48:06] it's just like going sleeping why who in
[48:08] the world would go to sleep at a ball
[48:09] game
[48:11] how many of you have ever seen ESPN has
[48:14] not lived by this
[48:20] touchdown
[48:21] no the dudes got on his Garb he's got on
[48:24] his Sunday best
[48:26] he's got his favorite team tattooed
[48:29] across his chest it's 12 below zero and
[48:31] he's naked
[48:36] please don't try that
[48:39] hey
[48:40] but listen folks it's what you enjoy
[48:44] listen I enjoy watching ball games I do
[48:48] but it's on my time not God's time
[48:51] all right look now look the meaning of
[48:53] it comes from your head that's from the
[48:54] internet so it must be true
[48:58] it's imaginary made up psychosomatic
[49:02] while it indeed is from your head
[49:05] it implies it's implied that it was
[49:07] created by your mind
[49:10] not
[49:12] that it's from your brain
[49:15] it's from your psyche
[49:18] listen
[49:22] it's not uncommon for people to say this
[49:25] about diagnosis conditions illnesses
[49:27] that don't have visible or physical
[49:29] symptoms I do this all in your head
[49:33] listen another meaning
[49:34] if something is all in your head you
[49:37] have imagined it and it's not real
[49:41] think about that
[49:45] I love the quote one time because you
[49:46] know what we get all we get all nervous
[49:48] and bent out of shape we think people's
[49:50] talking about us all the time
[49:52] come on somebody
[49:54] we think we thank all my freedom she see
[49:57] I see her she's over here whispering to
[49:58] Paul because I got something on my nose
[50:00] or something you know it's something my
[50:01] hair's not right or something that's
[50:04] about some them kids back there they
[50:06] Whispering about me because I'm ugly
[50:09] well that's true me
[50:11] ugly
[50:12] not you free to me
[50:14] not at all
[50:17] when they're not even talking about you
[50:19] one second
[50:22] a psychologist said one time he said you
[50:24] spend about 80 percent of your time
[50:26] listen to this eighty percent of your
[50:28] time worrying about what somebody's
[50:31] saying about you when that person don't
[50:32] spend two percent of their time thinking
[50:34] about you
[50:37] all right brother Kylie I got too many
[50:40] problems of my own I don't well I have
[50:41] to deal with some of y'all in this
[50:43] position I'm in for the temporary moment
[50:44] but we've got to get it out of our head
[50:49] into our heart yes right
[50:52] because we got to have the mind of
[50:53] Christ
[50:54] and the greatest battle is up here so
[50:56] what is the Battle of it's me and you
[50:58] know the Bible is us
[51:01] not like I said you're not going to make
[51:03] it you're not not gonna make it
[51:07] a preacher is not going to make you not
[51:09] make it or make it
[51:11] you're going to individual now you're
[51:12] going we need guidance we need help
[51:14] don't don't all go home we need that
[51:18] but your choice in your mind
[51:20] it's what you got to make up
[51:22] whether you want to what
[51:25] raise your hand
[51:27] scream when you want to scream shout
[51:28] when you want to shout
[51:30] right let's read these let's read these
[51:32] here in the Bible just a little bit and
[51:34] then we'll we'll stop right here I
[51:36] wanted to get to something else but
[51:37] we'll stop
[51:39] we'll get to it next Sunday or this
[51:40] afternoon look at the Bible in Genesis 6
[51:43] 5 and God saw that the wickedness of man
[51:45] was great on the Earth
[51:48] and listen he doesn't list prostitution
[51:50] he doesn't list
[51:52] what has he left one thing
[51:56] that every imagination of the thoughts
[51:58] of his heart was only evil continually
[52:01] it came from right here
[52:03] and then they did what they did because
[52:07] of what they were thinking
[52:09] remember stinking thinking
[52:11] Genesis 8 verse 21 and the Lord smelled
[52:13] a sweet Savor and the Lord said in his
[52:16] heart I will not again curse the ground
[52:18] anymore for man's sake for the
[52:20] imagination
[52:22] remember we got to cast that down memory
[52:24] reason conscious affection imagination
[52:26] that's part of the five senses in that
[52:29] Spirit realm the Lord smelled a sweet
[52:32] Savior and the Lord said in his heart I
[52:34] will not again curse the ground anymore
[52:35] for man's sake for the imagination of
[52:37] man's heart is evil from his youth
[52:39] neither will I against might anymore
[52:42] everything living as I have done he's
[52:44] talking about the flood Jeremiah 7 verse
[52:47] 23 said but this thing commanded out of
[52:49] them saying obey my voice and I will be
[52:52] your God
[52:53] and you shall be my people and walk in
[52:55] all the ways that I have commanded you
[52:57] that it may be well unto you but they
[53:01] hearkened not nor incline their ear but
[53:04] walked Walked
[53:07] walked through life
[53:10] they walked what
[53:13] look at that in the council and in the
[53:16] imagination of their evil heart and went
[53:19] backwards not forward
[53:22] nothing good about this is going to
[53:24] happen nothing
[53:25] instead
[53:27] keep going
[53:28] everybody with me Matthew 15 verse 19
[53:31] support for out of the heart perceive
[53:34] evil thoughts murders adulterers
[53:35] fornication theft false witness
[53:37] blasphemies things you think of in your
[53:39] mind Luke 2 verse 35 and I wrote us a
[53:42] note here yes sword shall pierce through
[53:44] my own soul also that the thoughts of
[53:46] many hearts may be revealed that's this
[53:48] age that's why brother random could
[53:49] stand and say
[53:51] I see you were at a
[53:53] somewhere yesterday and you said a bad
[53:56] word and you need to get that
[53:57] straightened out why he was looking
[53:58] right at it he was looking at not an
[54:00] imagination they can call him whatever
[54:03] they want to call him he was not an
[54:05] imaginary Prophet that's right he was a
[54:08] mouthpiece of God and God spoke to him
[54:11] used his lips and told you your problems
[54:14] just like he's doing the same thing now
[54:16] yeah
[54:19] out of the heart perceives evil thoughts
[54:21] murders adulterers fornication thefts
[54:23] false witness blasphemies Luke 2 verse
[54:25] 35 is what we're talking about now the
[54:27] thoughts of many hearts may be revealed
[54:30] how is that by the opening of the word
[54:32] amen amen amen
[54:34] Romans 1 verse 20 for the invisible
[54:37] things of him from the creation of the
[54:38] world are clearly sane being understood
[54:41] by the things that are made even his
[54:42] eternal power
[54:43] and God had so that they are without
[54:46] excuse watch because that when they knew
[54:49] God they glorified him not as God I'll
[54:52] give you an example that just in a few
[54:53] minutes neither were thankful but become
[54:57] what vain in their imaginations listen
[55:01] every false Doctrine is an imagination
[55:04] it did not come from God and bye with me
[55:08] God has no imagination
[55:13] he don't imagine things and they don't
[55:15] come to pass
[55:16] no he thanks him they come to pass so we
[55:19] wait a minute
[55:21] back up here everybody
[55:23] we gotta have
[55:26] we gotta have the mind
[55:28] if there's no imagination in it that's
[55:30] why we're going to read in a minute cast
[55:31] down imagination
[55:33] that's our problem and really it is an
[55:35] issue that I see
[55:37] we think too much about whatever people
[55:39] think about us
[55:40] amen you need to worry about yourself
[55:49] but became vain in their imaginations
[55:52] look and their foolish heart was
[55:55] darkened
[55:57] there ain't nothing good left folks
[55:59] nothing good with that
[56:03] nothing their foolish heart was darkened
[56:06] second Corinthians 10 but I beseech you
[56:08] that I may not be bold oh let me back up
[56:11] here to Romans
[56:14] 1 verse 20.
[56:16] because that when they knew God they
[56:17] glorified him not as God we were coming
[56:19] to it's kind of strange how God works
[56:22] well it's not strange to him strange to
[56:24] us here we go imagining things
[56:28] we never listened to 106.1 because we
[56:30] usually listen to The Fish I'm just I'm
[56:32] laying it all on the altar
[56:35] r105 K-LOVE everybody I know y'all do
[56:39] because you say you sing songs that was
[56:40] on it
[56:44] secret centers
[56:46] but we listened it was it was on 106.1
[56:49] because George game was on yesterday on
[56:51] that station
[56:53] but they played gospel music
[56:55] southern gospel music for like an hour
[56:57] on 106.1 up here in Cornelius some of
[57:00] you already listed well we're listening
[57:01] to it coming up the road and I was
[57:02] thinking on this very thing about the
[57:04] imagination of mind all different things
[57:06] and they sang that song Liar Liar
[57:10] talking about the devil being a liar
[57:13] but they just don't know
[57:15] they're being deceived
[57:17] by that same lie
[57:20] do you see the deception they're singing
[57:23] The Very songs by inspiration they know
[57:27] Satan's a liar but he's got them believe
[57:30] in his life
[57:32] and we believe it could agree
[57:35] do we get it all knocked out of us but
[57:38] that's how deceiving that is because
[57:40] that when they knew God they glorified
[57:43] him not as God Amen
[57:46] what is the great deception
[57:48] Satan sitting in the temple of God
[57:51] showing himself to be as God
[57:54] in this age yes and they sing the songs
[57:57] and they're condemning their own self
[57:59] thank him that they're what that they're
[58:02] oh well the devil's over there because
[58:03] I'm singing about him over there Liar
[58:05] Liar
[58:07] and then they go to church and the
[58:08] preacher stands up and says well we're
[58:09] going to baptize you today in the name
[58:11] of the father son Holy Ghost Lord we
[58:12] love this Blessed Trinity that's a lot
[58:15] of the devil folks
[58:17] they're living a lie but they think
[58:20] they're living in truth now I just feel
[58:22] sorry for them I'm not trying to kick
[58:24] the guy out but when I was listening to
[58:25] that song I thought my God
[58:29] do you remember
[58:31] do you remember
[58:33] brother Brown I'm saying well when they
[58:35] hung Jesus on the cross the very word
[58:37] himself they hung Jesus on the cross
[58:38] right they were in the temple
[58:41] singing The Very songs about that and
[58:45] they're the ones that put him on the
[58:46] cross and they're singing to get the
[58:48] Messiah here they're singing these songs
[58:50] from the Psalms and from the songs of
[58:52] Solomon they're singing The Very songs
[58:54] that's condemning them
[58:57] right
[58:58] come on people that's how close it is
[59:01] that's how we came perhaps we got to
[59:03] cast down imagination but I beseech you
[59:06] for second Corinthians 10.
[59:09] then I may not be bold when I am present
[59:11] with that confidence look
[59:14] wherewith I think to be bold against
[59:16] some
[59:17] right nope don't put people down
[59:20] which think of us as if we walked
[59:22] according to the flesh now keep reading
[59:25] for though we walk in the flesh
[59:29] we don't walk by the flesh we walk in
[59:32] the flesh
[59:33] we do not war after the flesh it's not
[59:37] your flesh is fault
[59:39] how many times can I get that in your
[59:41] head quit blaming your flesh no it's
[59:44] that Spirit that's motivating your flesh
[59:48] for the weapon of our Warfare are not
[59:51] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[59:53] pulling down of strongholds look casting
[59:56] down imagination
[59:58] and every High thing that exalted what
[1:00:00] itself yes
[1:00:02] itself yeah against the knowledge of God
[1:00:06] that's right which is what the truth and
[1:00:08] look and bringing into captivity
[1:00:11] every thought yes
[1:00:14] to The Obedience of Christ amen
[1:00:17] read that one more time casting down
[1:00:19] imagination and every High thing that
[1:00:22] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[1:00:24] God and bringing into captivity yes
[1:00:29] I want to be a prisoner
[1:00:32] I want to be a prisoner and
[1:00:34] you know what prisoner has no rights
[1:00:37] prisoners locked up prisoner has no
[1:00:40] rights Paul said it 100 times in the old
[1:00:43] in the New Testament Paul a prisoner of
[1:00:45] Christ Paul a prisoner in my bonds I
[1:00:49] glory in my bonds
[1:00:53] bringing into captivity every thought
[1:00:56] yes to The Obedience of Christ
[1:01:01] wow
[1:01:02] you need to post that on your fridge
[1:01:04] instead of the
[1:01:06] something from James Dobson
[1:01:09] just saying just saying
[1:01:13] it's all in your head let's stand it's
[1:01:15] all in your head
[1:01:17] is it sure that's where it's got to
[1:01:18] start
[1:01:20] but as a man thinketh in his heart so is
[1:01:23] he that goes down into the soul yes but
[1:01:25] it has to come back through that filter
[1:01:27] of your what of your gray matter your
[1:01:30] five senses your brain that's right
[1:01:34] everybody with me on that
[1:01:37] cast down
[1:01:39] yes we need a mental object a mental
[1:01:43] adjustment
[1:01:45] but it has to be by the word of God
[1:01:48] not by what our own look right there
[1:01:50] selfishness lovers of their own self
[1:01:54] I don't want to live for myself a
[1:01:56] selfish life I want to live for others
[1:01:58] and give that strength I have not to
[1:01:59] myself
[1:02:00] but to the benefit of others it'll build
[1:02:02] the kingdom of God
[1:02:04] talk about our own selfish being our own
[1:02:06] ambition
[1:02:07] if we could completely surrender
[1:02:09] ourselves and be yoked to him what
[1:02:10] prisoner be open to him no matter what
[1:02:13] the rest of the world thinks I do not
[1:02:15] care what the world thinks about me
[1:02:17] whatever you lead I'll follow Lord I'll
[1:02:19] be a prisoner see
[1:02:23] wow
[1:02:25] then you have to suffer to reign
[1:02:27] listen the Bible says the present
[1:02:30] suffering of this time cannot be
[1:02:32] compared to in other words let me let me
[1:02:35] interpolate to the eternal life that we
[1:02:37] have
[1:02:39] everything you see in your human life
[1:02:43] has an end
[1:02:45] except
[1:02:47] eternal life
[1:02:48] everything everything
[1:02:50] has an end everything's getting older
[1:02:54] everything's getting wore out
[1:02:57] but if we'll suffer
[1:02:59] you'll Reign because character is a
[1:03:01] victory
[1:03:02] not a gift
[1:03:04] it's not something God gives out and he
[1:03:05] gives gifts
[1:03:07] Gifts of healing Gifts of Prophecy Gifts
[1:03:10] of different things but you got to
[1:03:11] suffer to get character
[1:03:14] coach characters what character was not
[1:03:16] the character was inside of you was your
[1:03:18] old nature when you get that out of you
[1:03:20] you still got what you got a lot of
[1:03:22] things you got to get out of you
[1:03:25] because a man without character can't
[1:03:26] Reign because power apart from character
[1:03:29] is satanic but
[1:03:31] but
[1:03:32] power with character is fit to rule and
[1:03:34] that's what God wants he wants number
[1:03:36] one
[1:03:36] well at least he'd rule over my neighbor
[1:03:38] I wish he'd rule over my preacher or
[1:03:41] Milestone later
[1:03:43] no he needs for you need to get yourself
[1:03:45] ruled over first
[1:03:46] when you get yourself into subjection
[1:03:48] hey man well I get myself into
[1:03:51] subjection then what then God's gonna
[1:03:53] work power with character it's fit to
[1:03:56] rule
[1:03:58] you love the Lord
[1:04:01] it's all in your head
[1:04:03] it's got to start there don't let it
[1:04:05] stay there
[1:04:07] right if the three Hebrew children would
[1:04:08] have what if they would have leaned
[1:04:10] toward their
[1:04:11] human imagination and human emotion you
[1:04:15] know what they do uh we really will bow
[1:04:17] don't worry we we got no their resolve
[1:04:20] was I don't care
[1:04:23] live or die sink or swim
[1:04:25] I'm heading toward the problem everybody
[1:04:27] all of us have got problems head toward
[1:04:29] it not away from it
[1:04:30] and man head towards the problem not
[1:04:33] away from it because if you're a child
[1:04:35] of God you got to go through it amen but
[1:04:37] when you get on the other side you look
[1:04:39] back and say
[1:04:42] that was all for me
[1:04:44] it just broke me out of the bonds that I
[1:04:46] was in
[1:04:47] that's the way you got to look at all of
[1:04:48] it let's sing a song God bless you
