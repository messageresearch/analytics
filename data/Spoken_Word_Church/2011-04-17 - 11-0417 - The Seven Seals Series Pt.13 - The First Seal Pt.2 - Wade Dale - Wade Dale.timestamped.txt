[0:02] matthew 24 don't worry everyone Matthew
[0:12] 24 what we're going to start in now is
[0:14] the first seal want you to keep in mind
[0:18] a few things we're going to go through
[0:20] these seals very slowly may take us all
[0:24] year but that's fine the Lord comp will
[0:27] talk about later but there's a few
[0:31] things I want to cover number one we're
[0:34] going to cover the natural aspect of the
[0:36] seal what's going to happen because the
[0:38] natural feel open that rider really does
[0:41] riding in a what you might say a pogrom
[0:44] I think our Nate Pope when we're gone as
[0:50] far as the seal being open my closet on
[0:53] the mat last Sunday that fifth seal
[0:55] doesn't really opened the sixth seal
[0:57] doesn't really open until of two
[0:58] prophets are standing on the earth and
[1:00] they open the seal preparing so there's
[1:03] a natural happening alright then there's
[1:07] an happening to the jews during that
[1:10] time and then there's a spiritual aspect
[1:13] that you anomalous catch okay so there's
[1:16] three things we're going to cover on
[1:17] each seal some of them more than others
[1:20] because i'll be true full with you out
[1:23] there sum of money other thing as much
[1:25] as i did the other all right there but
[1:27] if you ever have any comments we know
[1:28] this is open for for discussion but the
[1:34] first seal remember Claude read verse 3
[1:38] last Sunday but let's go ahead into the
[1:41] other three questions work when shall
[1:43] these things be once you'll be the side
[1:45] I'm not coming
[1:46] the end of the world right okay jesus
[1:49] answered and said unto them take heed
[1:51] that no man deceive you that's the first
[1:53] thing you said all right God in
[1:56] simplicity the first thing brother
[1:58] ground priests with God in simplicity
[2:01] first seal before the first deal before
[2:04] the break he preached God and simplicity
[2:07] take heed that no man deceive you
[2:09] someone comes with our evaluation that's
[2:12] not in the word that compared with the
[2:14] Bible I'm gonna believe one thing he's
[2:17] come to deceive you okay alright so now
[2:22] take heed that no man deceive you for
[2:24] many shall come in my name and say I am
[2:27] Christ and shall deceive many there's
[2:32] your first seal hmm Christ come as
[2:39] Christ saying I am Christ and show the
[2:42] scene many many shall come in my name a
[2:46] lot of things are done in the name of
[2:48] Jesus that are not true they're false
[2:53] meaning shall come in my name so the
[2:55] deception is they're going to come in
[2:57] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:00] they're going to say I am Christ but
[3:04] they're going to be deceiver all right
[3:06] see middle for many shall come in my
[3:10] name saying I am price now let's turn it
[3:15] over and expound on that just a little
[3:17] bit to verse 24 4.3 let's go to 22 so
[3:25] this is where we pick it up so I'm going
[3:29] to go another way in this scripture just
[3:31] popped up
[3:35] very very fitting that we read this
[3:39] Matthew 24 22 remember the first seal
[3:49] let's just run through this deal real
[3:50] quick all the seals the first seal is
[3:53] first five going to mark this in your
[3:55] Bible of marking them second seal
[3:57] brother branham read first six third
[4:03] seal is verse seven and eight and they
[4:07] all overlap so don't just say that is
[4:08] all that's going to happen though they
[4:10] all overlap each other all right if I
[4:12] understand about an overlap God doesn't
[4:14] just stop start something to stop it and
[4:16] begin something else he had an overlap
[4:18] in the church edges one age would blend
[4:21] into the other really the church changes
[4:23] should have been drawn like this
[4:24] according to what the Prophet said this
[4:26] is the way the church ages should be
[4:27] drawn okay because there's not a big dot
[4:33] then there's a gap no dude right here is
[4:37] where that quarter comes and they were
[4:38] preaching on that the quarter stands
[4:40] here these people fell away God brings a
[4:44] profit on this thing or messenger on the
[4:46] same page restores back and bring this
[4:49] message I think the gut that so every
[4:52] time writing this lap over its when that
[4:54] Porter comes in was not like this you
[4:57] got a gap now there's leftovers to the
[4:59] agents because some of the people but to
[5:02] me you know what this is right here you
[5:04] know what this will place it grace
[5:08] that's the grace of God to let the
[5:10] people that had the mindset of Luther go
[5:12] right over into Wesley and Wesley be the
[5:16] messenger to the age God should have
[5:18] said that's it if you don't believe
[5:19] Wesley you're dead but no the Lutheran's
[5:22] were still alive they have not
[5:24] denominated all the way yet there was
[5:25] true people in there same way when
[5:28] brother
[5:28] I'm came he said you kind of cost for
[5:30] people when there was at in a constable
[5:31] age and then brother branham brought his
[5:34] message but he had these people in this
[5:38] age were coming on through into the 60s
[5:41] look at that fence Bosworth fffff
[5:44] Bosworth was not a part of the message
[5:46] of the island it's hard to say but Beth
[5:50] haven't been one of the greatest brother
[5:52] I'm said one of the greatest man of
[5:53] healing the old old tree but he was not
[5:56] part of the message of the hour he was
[5:59] back in caught in Pentecostal aids
[6:01] because he never accepted the baptism
[6:03] and they Lord Jesus Christ but he would
[6:06] ever wear brother Brent you know I mean
[6:08] he probably I would say accepted it
[6:10] later but as far as one God they
[6:12] probably still had a Trinitarian idea i
[6:14] know for a fact that Smith Wigglesworth
[6:16] and some of those were not in the name
[6:19] of Jesus Christ they were fought all
[6:21] back in that father son Holy goes
[6:22] baptism right you have to listen to
[6:25] brother around the way he preaches
[6:27] spectacle especially back in the early
[6:28] 50s I'm going to say this online he was
[6:34] a compromiser then because he was trying
[6:37] to bring these people i was reading in
[6:39] nineteen even in 1959 he said i believe
[6:41] in denomination he said I just don't
[6:45] believe in saying this is the only
[6:47] denomination because he was trying to do
[6:49] what Graham this tree on this side of
[6:51] this tree on this side planted together
[6:52] and make one beautiful tree but as he
[6:55] got closer to the revelation of these
[6:57] seals he said now I know why I've always
[6:59] been against organized religion and he
[7:02] preached hard against it you live from
[7:05] 62 to when he passed away he lost all of
[7:08] his influence he preached a raptor
[7:11] message one of the greatest message
[7:12] you'd appreciate preaching in a trailer
[7:14] with a Bible many people are sitting
[7:15] right here what about a man had preached
[7:17] before thousand hundreds of thousand the
[7:20] people and at the end of his ministry
[7:23] he's sitting here talking to 20 some
[7:25] people preaching some of the greatest
[7:27] sermons that man has ever heard since
[7:29] Jesus
[7:32] that's right he sure did how he wondered
[7:36] why he he always he'll tell you in the
[7:37] sea okay so now I know why I was against
[7:39] that thing when he saw that first Hill
[7:41] open and saw that white horse rider and
[7:43] riding through those denominational
[7:44] systems and the father son Holy know
[7:45] about Desmond all that he knew right
[7:48] then he said when that steel broke he
[7:50] knew that all back before that was wrong
[7:53] and for sure when that seal broke when
[7:56] these things broke to that prophet
[7:58] anything from their forward is against
[8:01] organization is against
[8:02] denominationalism right not to people
[8:06] but the place they're stuck in alright
[8:11] so the first day of the fifth verse
[8:12] second seal 6 verse third seal the
[8:16] seventh I mean third seal seven and
[8:19] eight fourth seal 9 15 10 to about 14
[8:32] then you then you're going to read what
[8:35] we read that's what I'm going to do this
[8:36] and then the six cell basically starts
[8:39] verse 27 28 29 30 31 they got to
[8:43] remember it's actually mostly verse 29
[8:45] 30 and 31 then what does he do Jesus
[8:49] starts into the parable of the fig tree
[8:53] alright and that would be a key later on
[8:57] but let's read right here in verse 21 so
[9:03] that should be Great Tribulation such as
[9:05] not since the beginning of the world to
[9:06] this time nor ever shall be and except
[9:09] those days should be shortened now
[9:12] they're saying that they've been
[9:13] shortened by a couple of milliseconds
[9:15] because the earthquake has pushed the
[9:17] world back up to the top of this axis so
[9:21] guess what our days are being shortly
[9:23] all right there shall be no there shall
[9:26] no flesh be saying we're looking for a
[9:29] body tank this is flesh good but for the
[9:34] elects sake those days you'll be short
[9:36] then if any man shall say unto you lo
[9:38] here in Christ or there
[9:42] believe it not for there shall arise
[9:47] false Christ's and false prophets and
[9:49] shall show great signs one of them is
[9:51] much that if it were possible they shall
[9:55] deceive the very elect the old I told
[9:58] you before now God remember God mother I
[10:01] said God says something twice he wants
[10:04] you to hear it cuz he don't repeat
[10:06] itself but this must be very important
[10:08] behold I've told you before wherefore if
[10:11] they shall say unto you so they is not a
[10:13] system than people then hmm they is
[10:16] people if they shall say unto you behold
[10:20] he is in the deserts going on for behold
[10:23] his in a secret chamber believe it not
[10:26] and I wrote in my Bible because he's in
[10:30] the bride nowhere else you know you
[10:35] that's hard to say my brother round him
[10:37] started heart started really going hard
[10:39] on denominations and they turned away
[10:41] from him because he realized they
[10:43] realized exactly what Jesus was the same
[10:46] Ministry of Jesus with brother branham
[10:48] same ministry with Jesus here Jesus is
[10:50] in Matthew 24 he's come to the end of
[10:52] his ministry and he's breaking the seal
[10:54] keep reaching six tables right here all
[10:56] right brother branham comes the end of
[10:58] his ministry the same thing that you
[11:00] watched Jesus they kill him because of
[11:02] his doctrine how come he heal the sick
[11:05] and brother drowned by collecting the
[11:06] greatest night the greatest thing that
[11:08] say about him on the internet is the
[11:09] Brent brown was the great faith healer
[11:11] and he started them or not the faith
[11:13] healer but the movement of faith inning
[11:15] and he was a spearhead but when he got
[11:17] the teaching doctrine he started messing
[11:20] up in God took him off the same in other
[11:22] words in 1965 because he was teaching
[11:24] false doctrine when he got into the real
[11:26] opening of the word guess what happened
[11:28] same thing happen is the Pharisees and
[11:31] the Sadducees and the scribes of old and
[11:33] Jesus's time they said we don't we can
[11:36] do it actually we want to kill him you
[11:39] know and I'm sure they sometime if I
[11:41] could've got by with it and
[11:42] let them they'd probably kill for the
[11:43] round even when the great Gordon Lindsey
[11:48] that went to Africa with its all the
[11:50] great things and wrote two books a
[11:51] prophet sent to South Africa turned
[11:53] against him because of dr. and he's one
[11:56] of the big ones that says in that book
[11:57] about God's generals that he had that he
[11:59] really messed up by going into doctrine
[12:01] and I'm standing for God had told him to
[12:03] be but they just didn't understand that
[12:05] brother on his message was progressing
[12:07] just like Jesus's message was
[12:08] progressing Jesus's message progressed
[12:11] he said the kingdom have repent 14 of
[12:13] heaven his hand but what'd he do he
[12:16] starts healing the sick raising the dead
[12:18] casting out Devils all through while he
[12:21] was doing his teaching but when he came
[12:22] up to the very end right here he was
[12:24] with nobody but the disciples on this
[12:26] mountain all right now the Mount of
[12:30] Olives before remember when the Mount of
[12:33] Olives he taught the Beatitudes there
[12:35] was one hundreds of thousands of people
[12:37] there but now what about right now
[12:39] though his disciples came unto him to
[12:43] showing the building the temple and he
[12:45] SAT upon amount of other than the verse
[12:48] 3 and this I post came unto him
[12:50] privately he was getting part of the
[12:52] time now where the disciples did him
[12:54] hardly won't be around and remember when
[12:57] he was crucified there was none of them
[12:58] around him Judas went and hung yourself
[13:01] and the other 11 just scattered like a
[13:03] bunch of chickens but then we're born
[13:06] again so they didn't have nothing to
[13:07] hold him but for many verse 5 shall come
[13:14] in my name and say I am Christ and shall
[13:16] deceive many low hit Christ is in iron
[13:21] movement Christ is in this moment look
[13:23] at the signs and wonders that's what to
[13:25] me that's why it says the mystery of
[13:27] iniquity now just iniquity is the
[13:30] mystery of iniquity all right there's a
[13:32] mystery behind that that we can sit in
[13:34] this age and we're going to read some
[13:36] more scripture let's turn to Psalms 2511
[13:40] and read their
[13:43] Psalms is full now look what did what
[13:46] was David David was a prophet but David
[13:49] was not a born again Christian like you
[13:51] and I'm with a holy ghost in his soul he
[13:55] was an anointed prophet and the old but
[14:02] his heart was in the right place he
[14:04] wanted to be right with God but there
[14:06] was nothing there that the blood of
[14:08] bulls and goats could not take away his
[14:10] sin it just covered then it Psalms 25
[14:19] David even in the condition that David
[14:22] within he said in verse 11 for thy name
[14:25] sake o Lord pardon mine iniquity it is
[14:29] great what man is he that feareth the
[14:31] lord himself each in the way that he
[14:34] shall choose his soul shall dwell at
[14:35] ease and his seed shall inherit the
[14:37] earth the secret of the Lord is with
[14:39] them that fear him and he will show them
[14:41] his covenant let's go to John 51 I just
[14:47] kind of put some of these together this
[14:52] is the one we always quote which clip
[14:54] them two scriptures together but watch
[14:59] David on man burst one of 51 now go
[15:05] phils you guys go feel Bible psalm 51
[15:08] was written when Nathan the Prophet came
[15:11] unto him after he had gone in to the bad
[15:13] about Sheba so he'd already committed
[15:16] adultery with his best friend and he was
[15:18] fixing to have his best friend killed
[15:20] when Nathan the Prophet came in and told
[15:23] David said hey there was a man that had
[15:25] many sheep remember many cows or goats
[15:27] or whatever I said but there was one man
[15:30] only had one and said the man that had
[15:33] many goats killed the man who could go
[15:35] and David said that man I'm sure they
[15:37] won't die and Nathan said you're the man
[15:40] because in other words you had five
[15:42] hundred wives your I had one and you
[15:47] wanted her and you killed him to get
[15:50] hurt but he said David you won't die
[15:52] because God has saw the inside
[15:55] the Inside Man God had grace in that old
[15:58] testament that's pretty bad you know to
[16:03] have your best friend killed no but I've
[16:05] hundred beautiful wives you have a
[16:06] minute at your beck and call five her
[16:10] mother-in-law flan five wives at your
[16:17] beck and call but yet you want this one
[16:19] woman but remember one thing
[16:23] predestination is in work here David had
[16:29] to be with Bathsheba so the Solomon can
[16:33] be born so God saw that line and through
[16:38] permissive well he allowed best sheba to
[16:40] marry your eye but in God's perfect will
[16:43] he had Isaac had become in the Solomon
[16:46] had to come through that as a type of
[16:47] Christ well you know why we were all
[16:50] born in sin I'm gonna read you right
[16:51] here shapen in iniquity should have been
[16:55] divorced should have been thrown away
[16:56] but I want to have something from us
[16:58] right so we come to a permissive well
[17:02] with the word brought us back to perfect
[17:03] the perfect little duck because we stand
[17:05] today within your birth that's what i
[17:06] wanted it was a beautiful time and raise
[17:10] up Solomon which that's what we do we
[17:11] give birth to Jesus Christ okay well
[17:15] that have mercy upon me O God according
[17:16] to thy loving kindness according to the
[17:19] multitude of doc tender mercies blot out
[17:20] my transgression wash me thoroughly from
[17:24] my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[17:26] fried knowledge David acknowledged watch
[17:31] David all the time he is a very
[17:32] repentant man very pennant even when you
[17:37] know the best Sheba the first child that
[17:39] they had an adultery does it it won't
[17:41] live but still David if you'll read
[17:43] there in
[17:44] in King's David right up until the baby
[17:46] died I mean got cold and babies on that
[17:48] soon Nathan nobody's going to die but
[17:51] he's still he laid on the floor he cried
[17:53] sackcloth and ashes to try to you know
[17:55] to try to get God to turn and turn
[17:57] around with God was going to do it
[17:58] probably knows my transgression in my
[18:00] sin is ever before me David couldn't
[18:02] forget you now don't forget our sin I
[18:05] wish we could because you got somebody
[18:09] nevermind besides yourself the devil
[18:13] people there when you did it to my sin
[18:16] is ever before me against the the only
[18:21] have I sinned and see David understood
[18:24] this is something to you and I've got to
[18:26] understand let me be real plane because
[18:29] we'll talk about our lives about
[18:30] iniquity the things that we did wrong
[18:33] maybe went out come into daughter had
[18:35] affairs whatever it doesn't matter but
[18:36] remember we sinned against God yeah i
[18:41] know we send against our blog or whoever
[18:43] we got to make that right but watch
[18:45] David against thee thee only have I
[18:47] sinned we got to come back with that
[18:50] repentant heart knowing that God didn't
[18:52] wants to do that we got to repent even
[18:56] though we're Christians now let's come
[18:57] up bringing up to two now even being
[18:59] born again ditch the whole things you do
[19:01] wrong will allow you to tell something
[19:02] that you don't you know that you don't
[19:03] do that you should have done or didn't
[19:05] you shouldn't done against the only have
[19:08] I sinned and done this evil in my side
[19:11] then thou mightest be justified we're
[19:18] going to talk and put that first seal
[19:20] we're going to see justification when we
[19:24] talk about the spiritual part all right
[19:27] that thou mightest be justified when
[19:29] thou speaketh and be clear when thou
[19:31] judges behold I was shapen in iniquity
[19:33] and in sin did my mother conceive me
[19:37] behold our desires truth in the inward
[19:40] park and then the hidden part i shalt
[19:42] make me to know wisdom purge me with
[19:44] hyssop and I shall be clean washing me
[19:47] and I shall be whiter than snow then he
[19:50] keeps going hi my face made me to hear
[19:53] joy and gladness at the bones which now
[19:55] is broken may rejoice I've got face from
[19:58] my sins and blot out all mine iniquities
[20:01] create in me a clean heart O Lord this
[20:04] is the song that we think every newer
[20:06] right spirit within me cast me all the
[20:08] way from thy presence and take not the
[20:09] Holy Spirit for me restoring to me the
[20:12] joy of thy salvation and uphold me with
[20:14] our free spirit then will not teach
[20:18] transgressors thy ways and sinners shall
[20:22] be converted unto thee watch what
[20:24] David's doing he's not only saying god
[20:28] I'm sorry for what I did but I'm going
[20:32] to teach others why did brother Brian
[20:34] say that Abraham was chosen over anybody
[20:36] else remember I read the quote I very
[20:38] long ago he said because Abraham he knew
[20:41] Abraham would pass that faith on to the
[20:44] next generation into the next generation
[20:45] that he would tell his children what had
[20:48] happened in his journey so God don't
[20:51] want us to keep this thing inside will
[20:53] tell tonight right all right now let's
[20:58] go to Psalm 79 and eight
[21:10] Oh remember not against former
[21:15] iniquities let doc tender mercy speedily
[21:22] prevent us for we are brought very
[21:24] little help with oh god of our salvation
[21:26] for the glory of thy name and deliver us
[21:28] and purge away our sins for thine name's
[21:32] sake then for some 1033 I put an order
[21:39] so you have to pull them back to switch
[21:40] back and forth to the bottom
[21:49] you
[21:53] there's another song that we wrote on
[21:55] saying a lot here but what's the Lord on
[21:57] my soul and all that is within me bless
[21:59] His Holy Name first one verse to bless
[22:02] the lord o my soul and forget not all
[22:04] his benefits who forgiveth all mine
[22:07] iniquities forgive it I wrote I circled
[22:10] that th forgive it that's an ongoing
[22:15] happening forgiveth believe it all right
[22:22] he'll forgive us all that iniquities who
[22:25] healeth all thy diseases who redeems the
[22:29] life from destruction to crown it d with
[22:32] loving-kindness and tender mercy all
[22:35] right let's go to Isaiah 6 just keep
[22:38] flipping on three bottles there right
[22:40] after proverb we ever get withdrew with
[22:49] a sealed I think we're gonna take the
[22:52] Book of Isaiah and starting the first
[22:53] chapter in this goes to the prophecy in
[22:55] the book on today at this table because
[22:57] of 66 books in the Bible in there 66
[23:00] chapters in Isaiah now it's not step by
[23:04] step he skipped around could you see if
[23:07] you think but but still in the first of
[23:09] the Bible you'll see on the first of all
[23:10] there you'll see him building like in
[23:12] Genesis Exodus Leviticus middle of the
[23:14] Bible here comes Jesus in the end of the
[23:16] Bible you'll see the future home so I
[23:18] bad as I complete program today
[23:20] commentary of the Bible in 66 chapters
[23:23] so like I said if we we get prisons with
[23:28] a steel wheel that's what I think we'll
[23:30] do I that six verse 7 but I don't want
[23:33] to dwell on that let's go on this let's
[23:39] go to verse 6 then flew one of the cell
[23:41] phones now this is this is isaiah little
[23:45] young boy he is being he is going to the
[23:50] temple and this is where he says here am
[23:54] I send me ok las leyes got this burning
[23:57] desire to serve God with God just O king
[24:00] uzziah died because what happened with
[24:03] keen use on
[24:05] remember he tried to mess a little bit
[24:06] with with some of the holy things and he
[24:09] was a king he was breached but but
[24:12] Isaiah was a mentor of use I so God had
[24:14] to take his eye off the same solely so
[24:16] that I was there to see this right here
[24:18] in the year the kingdom's I died I saw
[24:20] the Lord sitting upon a throne pilot
[24:22] lifted up his train filled the temple go
[24:24] to verse 6 then flew one of the cell
[24:26] phones under me having a live coal in
[24:28] his hand which I take them with the
[24:29] tongs from both the altar elated by my
[24:31] mouth and said load this has touched our
[24:33] lips and thine iniquity is taken away
[24:36] and I sin purged wow you got to know you
[24:42] more again the guy's just being covered
[24:46] by the blood of bulls and goats what God
[24:48] is going to so purge this man called out
[24:50] loud that I was going to write one of
[24:53] the greatest commentaries of the Bible
[24:55] but he's one of the greatest prophets
[24:57] but he was a young boy remember if
[24:59] you're very young I there was a very
[25:01] young man when he began this began his
[25:04] ministry and also i heard the voice of
[25:06] the Lord saying whom shall i send and
[25:08] who will go for us then said I here am I
[25:10] send me so now let's go to Isaiah 40
[25:17] we're going to read this and get get
[25:19] some of the scripture
[25:35] first two verses comforts you comfort
[25:39] you my people that your God speak he
[25:42] comfortably to Jerusalem now remember we
[25:45] are spiritual Jerusalem right there
[25:48] could you then crying to her her her her
[25:51] her her bribe her that her warfare is
[25:56] accomplished that her iniquity is
[25:59] pardoned for she has received of the
[26:02] Lord's hand double for all her sins in
[26:05] other words she's paid for her sin in
[26:07] other words this is isaiah them are in
[26:11] captivity and they're getting ready to
[26:13] go out and even the commentary of
[26:16] Schofield says looking beyond the
[26:19] captivity chapter forty to sixty six so
[26:22] he's saying that israel is getting ready
[26:24] to break forth into something but her
[26:27] iniquity had to be pardoned because of
[26:29] her double sin that she had committed
[26:31] before that's why she was in county
[26:32] that's why you and I go into captive you
[26:35] know I captivity for us here backslide
[26:37] if your back slid you're in captivity
[26:40] because Israel would come out with a
[26:42] mighty hand of God got adolescent they
[26:44] would absolutely just prosper for years
[26:46] and then all of a sudden what would
[26:48] happen they'd get a little axe they quit
[26:52] going to church and quit reading their
[26:53] Bible they quit studying they let the
[26:55] cares of the world takeover hello
[26:59] character in the world takeover you know
[27:01] what gotta do gotta throw into captivity
[27:03] one bribe does better under persecution
[27:06] so Israel did better under persecution
[27:09] okay so everything in Israel yes brother
[27:13] instead Israel with God's time Pete well
[27:15] if we taught them then whatever is
[27:17] happening to them is happening does
[27:18] alright God said he would bless Israel
[27:22] never would forget her
[27:29] but here is a point out all this and
[27:33] then we'll then don't stop maybe got any
[27:37] questions I want you to ask questions
[27:38] more than you ever have is I want you
[27:40] leave without you know with a question
[27:42] in your mind but what we've read today
[27:44] is from Psalms a man David and Isaiah
[27:48] two great men of the Old Testament have
[27:50] read anything in the New Testament we're
[27:54] going to look at the three aspects
[27:56] you're going to look at one go back over
[27:58] to Matthew 24 all right what many shall
[28:16] come in my name and say I am Christ and
[28:18] shall deceive many now let's read before
[28:21] we go let's go to revelation 6 and once
[28:24] you put a marker in there because we're
[28:25] going to go back and forth from
[28:27] revelation states Matthew and a lot of
[28:30] lot of other scriptures Revelation
[28:36] chapter 6 verse 1
[28:42] right and I saw when the lamb opened one
[28:46] of the sealed I heard as it were the
[28:47] noise of thunder one of the four beasts
[28:50] saying come and see and I saw and behold
[28:54] a white horse and he does that only had
[28:58] a bow and a crown was given I want you
[29:01] to watch this word given
[29:23] power was given unto him that crown was
[29:29] given unto him and he went forth
[29:30] conquering and to conquer so this person
[29:35] that wrote out he didn't just conquer it
[29:38] says and conquering ok see if like
[29:44] Napoleon he went and conquered France or
[29:46] wherever not France but maybe Spain well
[29:50] he went on in Concord other places but
[29:53] there was a time when he stopped right
[29:56] brother Randall said that this horse
[29:58] rides on right on into eternity now the
[30:00] horse and the rider is not eternal okay
[30:03] but he rides on off because he's going
[30:07] into perdition because it's not the good
[30:10] guy this is the bad guy but see it's the
[30:12] mystery because he's here on a wild
[30:14] horse that was the great mystery was the
[30:18] first unfolding because let me let me
[30:21] try to explain something brother Brown
[30:23] said there's a mystery and then there's
[30:27] a supernatural element oh and I'll bring
[30:29] the quote next Sunday there's an element
[30:31] underneath that mystery see so it's like
[30:35] you know everybody so all the climbers
[30:37] right was the Antichrist that's the
[30:38] opening of the first field that's part
[30:41] of it that's part of it but it ain't all
[30:45] it but it actually what it does is it if
[30:50] you roll those things up and put a seal
[30:53] on it when you pump at first seal off
[30:55] its not just one page its many pages you
[31:00] just keep peeling them back because when
[31:03] the Prophet preach the seals he didn't
[31:05] just go off the saint or I his start
[31:06] preaching go by preaching one back then
[31:09] and then Jesus Christ no he broke the
[31:10] revelation that was known for no man
[31:13] underneath that remember
[31:15] he had the vision of the of the pyramid
[31:17] and you got that crowbar and he pulled
[31:19] it off and he said I he said I saw
[31:21] things that man had not seen before but
[31:25] if you were going to read that Sunday he
[31:27] said if I can give it out the way it was
[31:29] given he said it would take a long time
[31:30] he said but I'm just going to hit the
[31:32] high spot well what was he doing him
[31:33] saying there was a group of people that
[31:35] was coming that would feel anything
[31:37] after understand what was going on so I
[31:39] don't think brother branham this is my
[31:41] my thoughts on this brother branham
[31:45] brought the revelation this book was
[31:49] sealed up with seven seals okay but once
[31:54] he popped that seal open to me it
[31:57] revealed the whole Bible but there was
[32:00] still other seals to me open the only
[32:02] thing one thing he did this old one
[32:04] stealing oh well only but that much of
[32:07] the Bible was revealed no because he
[32:11] said the Bible can brand new book
[32:13] alright so that's what I that's just
[32:17] what I see of the field it's not just
[32:19] because listen once brother Brennan
[32:24] spoke that and said the white horse
[32:26] rider was the Antichrist that did not
[32:29] throw the devil in the fifth he knew he
[32:36] was the writer he he knew he was the one
[32:40] that I was talking about he had just had
[32:43] everybody so bamboos without through
[32:45] time when John wrote this Satan remember
[32:49] is right there he's not off somewhere
[32:51] off in the garden somewhere with his
[32:52] feet kicked up he was right there with
[32:55] John on the Isle of Patmos and when he
[32:57] saw that white horse go out same you
[33:00] that was him but he knew that if nobody
[33:03] ever revealed that that he could he
[33:05] could keep deceiving the people into
[33:08] believing that that white horse with a
[33:10] white righteous church that's why in the
[33:14] end time it says I am God not a lot god
[33:17] I'm god i'm going to send
[33:18] temple of God okay so this first seal
[33:22] mystery is not just at the white horse
[33:23] rider I preached it one time in the
[33:25] church and the guy never asked me back I
[33:27] really don't care but that doesn't
[33:31] bother me Liam really bothers being my
[33:35] in my spirit but it doesn't bother me as
[33:36] a person I really you know I think
[33:39] people didn't want anything that's okay
[33:41] but that's not the mystery it was a
[33:45] mystery before now brother Brown said
[33:48] the mystery is history but you just
[33:50] don't say well the white horse rider was
[33:51] was the Antichrist and we know that now
[33:53] boy let's go on to steal number to know
[33:55] there's there's there's little bitty
[33:57] revelations under that that we gotta
[34:01] pull the pages back brother item open
[34:03] that first seal and listen brother Brown
[34:20] picked first seal this is just an
[34:21] illustration this is the first field now
[34:23] not to or seven were sealed nobody's
[34:28] ever looked at they always read that
[34:29] scripture just like I read it and
[34:32] thought that white righteous church was
[34:34] was God and the Holy Ghost even brought
[34:37] round then put my brother Clem brother
[34:39] I'm cooked and broke that seal and open
[34:41] that book he saw there was volume inside
[34:47] that book but he only skimmed over i'll
[34:51] read it to you next Sunday when the
[34:52] first hill he said he said if I hit it
[34:54] he said he'd take months for me just on
[34:56] the first seal but what he done he hit
[34:59] the highlights what we calling this a
[35:01] bullet points everybody I want a bullet
[35:04] point ends they'll go if you do a resume
[35:06] or whatever it'll go bullet point one
[35:09] graduated bullet point to first job for
[35:14] the point three you know 20 years
[35:18] experience but inside that 20 years
[35:20] experience what you do you work for 20
[35:22] years you get this you did this you
[35:25] this you went to school but you put 20
[35:26] years experience then when they ask you
[35:28] the question tell me about this 20 years
[35:31] experience well that to me that's the
[35:32] way to say before God came in and said
[35:34] okay double one run around you don't
[35:37] have time to do it on number two the
[35:39] people that are needing this it's not
[35:41] even alive some of them yet so you could
[35:44] put this out because brother I'm cities
[35:46] right here on the books and the tapes
[35:47] right why did he say God like to do you
[35:52] like for you to read between the line
[35:54] and that's what we did while horse rider
[35:57] Antichrist mystery of iniquity we'll go
[36:01] through some of these things but we've
[36:03] got to get in between this because the
[36:07] mystery of iniquity goes all the way
[36:12] that mystery of iniquity goes all the
[36:14] way to the white throne judgment called
[36:18] if iniquity is found in you you will not
[36:22] go to heaven that's what David said he
[36:25] said hide my nickel to do away with my
[36:27] iniquity get rid of this thing let's get
[36:30] rid of this thing to start with okay do
[36:32] you understand what we're going to go
[36:34] the seals I think the seals and even
[36:35] even that preaching them in 1982 he
[36:38] preached like seven sermons on the first
[36:40] seal but inside those seven sermons you
[36:43] can preach a thousand other sermons
[36:45] because of what went on in between that
[36:47] that was something that was open that
[36:50] book was opening and what that did is he
[36:52] took this book God did through a
[36:54] messenger the book was already open so
[36:58] he just started paid one h2 h3 h4 h5
[37:04] brother ground just went you know like
[37:06] section 1 section 2 section 3 and when
[37:11] it broke open what did it do it let men
[37:13] of God go in there with these great big
[37:16] nuggets and you start hacking off a
[37:18] little looking at a time and breaking it
[37:20] down to the people and that's what the
[37:22] seals are to me brother ground preach
[37:23] that in one night he preached the first
[37:25] seal second nineteen freeze the second
[37:28] seal that's not the end of it
[37:31] that's just the beginning that was
[37:34] something that when he whipped that top
[37:35] off he never said he put the top back on
[37:38] he said I went that top off and looked
[37:41] down and saw things that man had never
[37:43] seen before and remember you got to
[37:46] remember one thing to keep the vision of
[37:49] him and brother Gene goat remember when
[37:51] he went out he was out here somewhere
[37:53] brother gene was trying to climb up
[37:54] there brother Brandon without here
[37:56] MacLeod he said he stood around how can
[37:58] I get out there he said only God can
[38:00] take a man out there that wasn't just
[38:05] for the problem it might oughta member
[38:09] jingo but it was for our people in the
[38:11] end time to get out there on that
[38:12] platform because we got stand with that
[38:14] problem stood any question but this
[38:18] first see like I say it might take a
[38:20] while we're going to go through a lot of
[38:21] them we're going on you know a lot of
[38:23] avenues going steady we're going to
[38:24] still stay in the first sale remember
[38:26] once a bullet one mystery of iniquity
[38:29] wild horse rider okay remember those
[38:33] things power was given imma leave it
[38:37] right there
