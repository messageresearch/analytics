TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] shining in the light of your glory holy holy holy holy lord [Music] amen is that your desire this morning to see him amen to lift his name above every other name amen well just welcome you all and uh it feels good to be here and uh welcome from russellville kentucky and we've had brother wade visit us quite a few times and so we're just trying to even the score a little bit and get down here and visit we were supposed to be on vacation this week and uh we we did take a little bit of a vacation so we're kind of ending that and uh just coming and spending a little bit of time with friends amen and it's good to be here and with the bride of jesus christ amen well i won't take a lot of time here getting prepped because i know that the first service is a race and uh so we will uh we'll just jump right into our scripture turn with me to ezekiel chapter one and we've been doing a study at home on the seals and uh this morning i just want to talk about the four beasts or the four gospels and the power of the gospels uh those things were open and brought out and expanded upon in the seals brother bannon mentioned them many times earlier in his message uh but in the seals he really brought out those things and so i just want to spend a little bit of time and being a pastor when i teach these things or speak about them i like to bring them down to shoe leather a lot of times when we talk about the seals and we talk about the mysteries of god it's just this high thing that's way up here and people are struggling to understand it but when you bring it down to your everyday life and you understand the influences that are surrounding you and that are pushing you and prodding you and trying to make you make the wrong decision or guide you towards the right decision it'll help you and so we just want to look at these and and see what god would say to us this morning and i've got about 30 sermons i'm cramming down to get some high points on just a narrow topic so uh you pray for me and i looked and behold the world one came out of the north a great cloud and the firing and folding in itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber and out of the midst of the fire also out of the midst therefore came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and everyone had four faces and every one had four wings and the feet were their feet were straight and the sole of their feet was like the soul of a calf's foot and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass and they had the hands of a man under the wings of the on their four sides and they four had their faces and their wings their wings were joined one to another and they turned not when they went and they went everyone straight forward as for the likeness of their faces the they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion and on the right side they had the the four had the face of an ox and on the left side they four had the face of an eagle thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of everyone joined one to another and two covered their bodies and they went everyone straight forward whether the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went amen lord we just thank you for your goodness and thank you for your mercy we thank you for your word we thank you for a message in this day to guide us in an hour that is so gray it's neither light nor dark but we know that in the evening time there shall be light and the bride has a light to walk by and i pray father that it would shine upon us this day it would shine upon your word you would direct us and guide us and lead us in all things in jesus name amen you can have your seats now if you take your bibles and you turn over revelations chapter 4 we see the picture of the throne and we see this same image that was in ezekiel rendered again and it says after this i looked revelations 4 1 looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard as it were the trumpet talking with me and said come up hither and i will show thee things must be hereafter and that's a good place to be to be drawn up a little higher to see what's coming down the road and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like jasper in a sardine stone and there was a rainbow around the throne and in sight like unto an emerald and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders clothed in white rain men they had on their heads crowns of gold so we're getting a picture of the throne room and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like under crystal and in the midst of the throne round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and these are the same four beasts in ezekiel and the first beast would liken to a line the second like unto a beast like a calf and the third the face of a man and the fourth was as a flying eagle the four beasts each of them had six wings about them and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day or night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come and we'll start stop right there with the scripture and brother graham says this in the seals talking about we're going to describe these four beasts i know that this is a church that has very good teaching very good foundation so i know that this is nothing new there's nothing new i can preach if you're looking to hear something new i'm sorry i'm going to disappoint you because it's all been covered but peter told the saints he said i'm going to put you in remembrance and that is our job as pastors and evangelists and teachers and prophets and apostles the fivefold ministry is to put you in remembrance of what has been before and and sometimes because we've come from a different walk of life and different experiences we can see the same picture from a slightly different angle and help you get a more uh full view of what god is doing but there's nothing new i can preach i'm sorry to disappoint you if i did it would be my own ideas and you all might as well just pack up and walk out right now so brother branham he says although the the actors in these of these seals begin at the first church age and brother braham is going to describe uh and you know when in chapter 5 of revelation as the seals begin to open each one of these beasts calls out and a rider rides forth and as that that occurs brother bram is going to describe kind of what's taking place there he says although the actors of these seals begin at the first church age now remember so you'll get the background of it thoroughly if we can or as thirdly as possible the actors i'll place it like that because an actor is a man who changes masks see it's the same rider on the on the horse and each of these four beasts it's the same anointing the same person behind each of these four powers now a beast in the bible is a power you all know that right and so we see that these actors they're changing masks and in this act tonight we're going to see if it's satan changing mass and all actors christ acting the part he did when he became from a spirit to man he only put on an actor's garment human flesh and came down on the form of man in order to be a kinsmen redeemer he had to be he had to be one of us melchizedek couldn't do it he didn't come the way we came jesus came the way we came even though they're the same individual we see christ acting the part he did when he came uh all right now you see it's only an actress form the reason they're all in parables the way they are here like beasts and animals and so far so forth is an act and so when we see these beasts it's an act it's a it's a mask it's a disguise and that's important to remember as we go on these actors begin in the first church age because it was christ revealing himself to the seven church ages now you understand it all right christ revealing himself to the seven churches though through these churches there's a great mess up comes along that's why we have to bring you to remembrance a great mess up comes along then at the end of the church age the seventh angel message to pick these lost mysteries and give it to the church see now we'll notice that but not then revealed in their true state now in the bible times the mysteries were there they seen these things happen the way john saw it now he said there is a white horse rider but what the mystery of it is there's a mystery that goes with that rider now what it is they didn't know and it's to be revealed and it's to be revealed after the lamb leaves the father's throne of his intercessory as kinsmen redeemer now if you stop right there that's a terrifying a sentence but we're not going to stop right there we're going to we're going to read more what brother branham had to say but there's a lot of people who think that after the priest the seals were open in these things that that christ is no longer in an intercessory role he's still in an intercessory role i want you to understand that i wouldn't preach if he wasn't in an intercessory role because it would be fruitless and it would be pointless there would be but i know that he's still on the throne i know because i have loved ones that i have not seen come in yet and until i see them come in i know he's still on the throne that's the way i have to believe it and that's the way the spirit and the bride say come as long as the door is open we're we're saying come come to him but when he says here that it is to be revealed brother bram's not uh he's not uh uh going in a different direction but what he's saying is they're revealed to the world the masks are to come off someday there's going to be an antichrist that rises up he's going to be wearing a mask and the world's going to think it's his their savior but at the end the mask will come off and they'll see who he is and the mask will come off christ and the world will see who he is even those who pierced him they'll see who he is so brother branham is talking about when that happens when it when when the man of sin is revealed to the world the masks will be off and christ will no longer be on the intercessory throne when the world sees who jesus is and every knee shall bow and everyone proclaim that he is lord the mask will be off everybody will know who he is but we see that he's he's still there he's still in the mercy seat amen all right so when he refers to this he's not talking about mercy being over amen i know there's some people who who preach that mercy is over i don't know why they bother amen just sit back and wait for the world to burn if that's your deal you're under a jonah anointing not an abraham anointing because when the world was going to burn abraham interceded on behalf of sodom and gomorrah but jonah popped some popcorn and sat underneath the gourd and waiting for it to happen i don't know what song we often sing about jonah you know what jonah and the well we often sing that's the only song we sing about him but jonah was an angry fellow maybe one day we'll preach on that but now so can you bring up that image of israel so when we talk about these four beasts yeah we got up there the four beasts that are arrayed around this throne are representative of the 12 tribes of israel and you can see here this i didn't do this so i can't take claim whether it's good art or bad art i can't i stole it all good preachers do but we see that we have the tabernacle of the wilderness in the middle and we see that we have the tribes arrayed in the north south east and west and the way these tribes are arrayed they each have their own individual tribal banner but then to each direction there is a banner under which they will will uh um uh uh sit and and depending upon which direction that's the the group that will lead the way but i want you to understand that no matter which direction and we see here in ezekiel they go they're never retreating they're never going backwards god never retreats and there was a famous general in in the korean war oliver oliver p smith i think his name was and there was a battle the chosen river and he got surrounded uh by uh the north koreans and he was in the middle of a battle there got completely surrounded and they said are you going to retreat he said we're not going to retreat we're going to advance in a different direction and that is what the army of god that is what the gospels do they never retreat god never retreats he may have you go in the same direction you've gone before because you have to finish a battle you have to finish you have to overcome if you don't overcome the test he's going to take you back around until you conquer the test there's this is not a pass fail the bride of jesus christ is going to pass every test she has to and and wha so long as we're here we're going to be moving it and in each one of these gospels represents a a frame of or or a phase of christ's ministry because brother branham refers to to uh uh when he talks about the the horse rider he talks about the phases of satan's ministry those dark those horse riders that's satan in different phases of his ministry and he begins his ministry in a religious phase as a white horse rider all right for the sake of time you're just going to have to ride with me here because i got a lot of hay on my fork and i don't want to be i don't want to be here till midnight i love you all but not that much and i know you all don't care for me that much so you just have to bear with me but we we we see that satan's always an impersonator and when that white horse rider of revelations chapter five when he rides forth uh and six revelation six i think it is as he rides forth and the beast cries out and he calls out he's revealing what that horse rider is and it's in counterpoi brother braham says whenever the enemy comes in like a flood quoting scripture that that god raises a standard against it and each one of these gospels was in place the ministry of christ to counter the ministry of satan satan only has four plays in his book that's it the opening of the seals was showing us the devil's playbook can you i i i'm not a big football fan but i know last week was the the super bowl i guess that's why you all got these big tvs i don't know but but what an advantage it would be to a team to have the opposing team's playbook to know what they're going to call to know what they're going to do and to have prepared in advance for every trap for every trick for everything that he can bring against you what what an advantage it would be and god in this day came down and through the voice of a man spoke to us the devil's playbook so that we could see every trap every trick everything he had unfolded we're not acting in ignorance anymore we're not guessing and groping in the darkness but there has been light in the evening time that can show us what's down the road and we can look back in history and see the hand of satan working and the hand of god working to counter it all through history we see that first 300 years of church history how that's not the trump is it all right we don't have to finish it right now we can but that first 300 years of church history he comes out impersonating christ that white horse rider looking forward to revelations 19 when christ comes back on a white horse satan's impersonating him trying to take that role trying to take worship to himself and his play is to get between you and god that's his play he wants to to interrupt that flow he wants to he wants to in the stead of god stand there remember his original his original thing was i will be like the most high he wanted to be worshipped as god and that's his play and so he sneaks into the church and for that first 300 years and we're we'll get back to this in a minute that for that first 300 years his riding down through time and he's intertw intertwining himself in the church he's getting involved in the church and brother branham said sayings became traditions which became doctrines and the doctrines of men made the gospel of no effect and that was his play in that first age and so we're going to focus here on a little bit on this first age and and and what was taking place here because you when we look at the progression of and go ahead and keep this up here for now when we look at the the the the trajectory of these four beasts we know that the first beast that cries out is matthew it's the lion the first beast that cries out because each one of these beasts is represented in the ministry of christ and each one of the gospels represents one of these beasts a different aspect of jesus's ministry have you ever wondered why you know in chronicles and kings we have we have kind of two separate views of the same event but for the most part paper was precious you know up until a couple hundred years ago uh not many of us had printing press we didn't have access to pens and now i still love my paper i still love my books but now we got electronics we got all this high-tech stuff you know and i imagine when they went from from leather hides to paper people were like it's just not the same and now that we've gone from paper to electronics there's still some of us it's just not the same but it's not the medium anyway god is not on these pages per se it's not the paper it's the words of life that are within them that were never meant to stay on paper or leather or electronics but to be in the heart of man that's where they were meant to be i've got so much hay on my fork i'm chasing too many rabbits but all right so we see that that each one of these gospels goes out to counter and each one of these gospels has a different view of christ's ministry paper was precious so so to have four books written sure it's the life of christ not trying to discount that at all but there was a purpose behind it there's a reason we don't have the gospel of timothy there's a reason we don't have the gospel of judas or or any of the other apostles or any of the others who came along along the way because there was a judas who wasn't a betrayer as well there's we didn't have a gospel of silas or barnabas we didn't we don't have what we have these four and according to history mark who was the cousin of barnabas wasn't even one of the twelve apostles who wrote the gospel of mark most people think that it was peter's account that mark wrote down that's a little history for you you can check that out if you want to or discard it i don't really care one way or the other i just thought it was interesting but it makes sense when we understand that the gospel of mark is about service and it's about but works and it's about what christ did and that's what peter was all about and why peter didn't mention himself very much or he's not mentioned much in the book of mark but anyway we'll get to to that later so we see that each one of these gospels has a different view it has a different representation of christ's ministry but it's the same christ it's the same god but just as we wear many hats i'm a pastor but i'm also a husband i'm also a father i'm a son i'm the same fella but i treat my wife different than i do my friends in my congregation and my parents and my children it's a different but it's the same guy and we see that christ through through the windows of this we see different aspects of his ministry and it's a fulfillment of all who he is and gives us a clear view of who he is and who you are and how you you fit into christ's grand plan amen so we we look here at the the the these uh uh representations here it says now uh brother graham says now this down here i'm on uh you'll find it just leave this up here while i read it dan was an eagle and this uh dan was an eagle reuben was a man's face e from and ox now you get the picture here that's the way they camped in the bible so this is what we're seeing here dan is the head of three tribes judah is the head of three tribes reuben's the head of three tribes ephraim's the head of three tribes three fours is twelve the twelve tribes of israel see each one with their banner and the banner of judah was under was the lion the band of reuben the man the banner of ephraim and ox and the banner of dan was an eagle now look back here john said one had the face talking to revelations let's read here see if it isn't the same in heaven first beast was like a lion second like a calf third like the face of a man fourth beast like a flying eagle just exactly the tribes of eagle camped guarding the earthly guards of the ark the god the gospel guards the mercy seat amen hallelujah don't you see it here mercy mercy seat nothing could come anywhere around it without crossing those tribes right in the middle there and that ark is the mercy seat you're not getting to god any other way than through the gospels the good news the good news is you don't have to fight your way there christ made a way for you amen there were angels in eden protecting the way to the tree of life that man would not touch it in his sinful condition and live forever the world wants to live forever how why would you want to live forever in this condition she could live to be 300 years old stooped shouldered arthritis all over the place knuckles death would be a mercy and as we go on life gets more and more corrupt and the older and longer that people go they'll either become better or bitter and without christ they'll become bitter amen we've got bill gates and all these guys investing money and trying to figure out a way with cloning and all these things to live forever it's the same spirit that was in babylon trying to escape the judgment of god through technology spirits don't die friends they don't die but god has provided a way to the tree of life that we might live eternally but it's through the gospels and the shed blood of jesus christ that cleanses us from all sin and the effects of sin amen crossing what crossing uh the lion crossing the man the intelligence of man crossing the workhorse is an ox or crossing the eagle in the swiftness of it heaven earth in between all around you see they were the guards and it was the pillar of fire brother nothing touched that mercy seat without approach the only thing that could approach it was through the blood aaron went in there once a year with the blood now you see it watch each head of the three tribes guarding the mercy seat the mercy seat of the old testament now have you got that down everybody there's a brand new one brother listen then we'll go uh that was the guards of the old testament how many has ever read it in the bible you know if that's right the guard's the old testament now we're living in another age glory oh i love this age don't you and that's just not because we have electricity and running water and all that good stuff we've got the fullness of the word revealed brother braham said if he could choose any age to live in i would love to have seen noah build in the boat i'd love to see moses been on the trip with him across the desert and seeing the plagues and seen it would have been miraculous i would have loved to have been there sitting at the dinner table with jesus but this age this time we have an understanding and an ability to look back and see what the devil has done and see what god has done and know we're right at the precipice of eternity not hoping but but seeing our faith in sight i love this age don't you god has a mercy today to be guarded do you believe that where's the mercy seat found in the heart of man the mercy seat is in the heart of man and that's important we talk about the intercessory whether or not he's off off the throne and whether or not he's interceding if the mercy seat is in the heart of man it's not in every man it's in the bride of jesus christ and if it's there in the cry and the bride of jesus christ is still here then there's still mercy to be found amen and i'll preach that to my dying day as long as the bride is here there's mercy to be found and first second you want a scripture for that second thessalonians 2 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only who he who now let us will let until he be taken out of the way and who is the he he'll be taken out of the way the bride of jesus christ i didn't get the quote we talked about it last night brother branham and the quote in the seals where he talks about the scripture he said he says the church comma the bride comma christ that's who the he is that has to be taken out of the way he's clarifying as he goes down it's the church has to be taken up well not the whole church the bride and who is she she is him so there's mercy to be found amen all right so we'll we'll just jump ahead here so when we see that we look at the gospel of matthew so so each direction that that they would go they would be led by one of these tribes and they would they would go in that direction whichever way god would have them to go and each one of these these represents a gospel and we see the progression in the church matthew mark luke john and the early phases of the church in the book of acts we see we see that early church was under a lion anointing now that doesn't mean that there wasn't aspects of the of the eagle anointing there wasn't aspects of the oxidation there wasn't aspects of of the other anointed man anointing but what we see is that was the predominant anointing that led to church there's a progression in the church there's a there there is a a a a lion age and then we progress to an ox age and then to a man age during the reformation and to an eagle age which we're in now amen you believe that and so i to break this down and make it some put some shoe leather on it i'm still good for time all right to put some shoe leather on it if that's the progression of the church that's the progression of you you're a microcosm of the grand plan of god god loves to do his grand things on a small scale his plan of redemption he just picks some farmer out in the middle of nowhere calls him out takes him to himself says i know you're 75 years old but you're going to have a child i'm going to build a nation from you god's grand plan and a little family nobody else knew what was going on he calls in the book of hosea calls hosea and gomer and and through their their their marital struggles their little microcosm of marital struggles and infidelity and all kinds of other things god is playing out for israel what's taking place between him and them so there's always a type being played out to the grand scheme if it happens up here it happens down here that's awaited whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven there's a connection there and so we see that the the the the gospel of matthew as it goes forth uh it's full of boldness and there's some quotes here brother brahm talks about it uh he says gospel goes forth as a lion it's stern it's bold it's brave like a lion it's a king like a lion that's the aspect of that that anointing that power of the gospel that goes forth and if you turn with me well if you've got a scofield bible if you read the preface in matthew now i know most of you skip that don't don't there's some good stuff in there but he says this the theme this is what scofield says the scope and purpose of the book are indicated in the first verse matthew is the book of the generations of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham this connects him at once with two of the most important old testament covenants the davidic covenant of kingship and the abrahamic covenant of promise of jesus christ and that two-fold character then matthew writes following the order indicated in the first verse he writes first of the king the son of david then of the son of abraham obedient unto death according to the isaac type but the prominent character of christ in matthew is that of the covenanted king david's righteous branch matthew records his genealogy his birth in bethlehem the city of david according to micah the ministry of the forerunner according to malachi 3 1 the ministry of the king himself his rejection by israel and his predictions of the second coming in power and great glory only then does matthew turn to the earlier covenant and record the sacrificial death of the son of abraham this determines the purpose and structure of matthew it particularly the gospel of israel it is particularly the gospel for israel as following the death of christ and the and and following the death of christ a gospel for the whole world the phrase the kingdom of heaven is mentioned nowhere else in the bible but it's mentioned 33 times in the book of matthew it's it's announcing the king it's announcing the king this is who he is and he comes in his boldness he comes in that and with courage he comes and it's not to say that in the other gospels he's not mentioned to that a matter of fact in pilate's hall pilate and jesus have a discussion on whether or not he is the king and jesus says for this purpose came i into the world but if my kingdom was of this world then would we fight but it's not of this world the kingdom of god is in the heart of man and he's breaking it forth here in the gospel of matthew breaking it forth and and we look at matthew and and we we look at matthew and mark all right we've got the the ox and the lion we've got the king and we've got the priests we've got the sacrificial animal he hath made us kings and priests even as christ was a king and a priest that was the the nowhere else was there that dichotomy nowhere else was that that paradox melchizedek and christ were the only kings and priests recorded in the bible until we get to revelations 5 when the seals are open and he hath made us kings and priests us now not someday but now can you see i get excited on this stuff i get excited i'll keep yelling to wake you up german chocolate cake is that what it is keep you all awake but we see the the gospel of matthew as it leads we see it in power and demonstration in the book of acts and we see that acting out in that first church age and we as a christian a new christian that's the same anointing you're under you're so bold when you first get saved you want to save the world you don't care what people say you don't care what they think you're so you're so on fire for god you just want to share it with everybody it's part of that lion anointing you're bold you're courageous you'll lay somebody says i got a headache you don't even go look for a tylenol you just smack them in the head and say be well in jesus name do you see something that's just not oh something in the church just not right i'm gonna go we're gonna get with a pastor we're gonna get this straightened out we're gonna get it fixed and you forget brother abraham said the pastor will sit on that sometimes for a long time waiting for the right moment like paul did with that girl who's behind him proclaiming these are men sin of god there's a man son of god brother brahma said he did it until he he had enough of it and the holy spirit said now turn and rebuke it there's a time and a place but that you know those of us who are a little bit farther down the road you got to have some grace for the lions you have to have some grace from for people who are in that stage you don't want to don't quench the spirit friends they're on fire don't do anything to slow them down you look you pray that every once in a while you get a little lying anointing on you god lead me in that way because there's sometimes when you need to face a devil head-on and you need the boldness of a lion to do it when a lion roars in the jungle everybody else shuts up now he's not the smartest monkey can trick him he's not the strongest that elephant can toss him around but he's fearless there's a boldness and strength to him and we see you look in acts chapter 3 and you see this and peter especially you see peter walking out and he's walking into the to the temple one day and he sees a man who's been begging and and the fellow is asking for alms and peter stops and and he says look on us now he doesn't say let's fast doesn't say let's call prayer meeting and get the elders let's get the pastor and the high priest we'll anoint you with oil it says look on us that's boldness silver and gold have i none the man was expecting one thing and god answered his need the need he wasn't even asking for the one he didn't even expect an answer to it wasn't his faith brother wade it wasn't his faith that did it it was the boldness of peter under the inspiration of the holy ghost he said rise up take up your bed and walk and the fellow began dancing he began shouting it raised a ruckus in the church lions don't mind ruckuses in the church look if it's under the inspiration of the holy ghost and it's it's it's not humanity but it's divinity in you oh get excited don't be afraid to dance don't be afraid to sing don't be afraid to shout don't be afraid to praise his name you're under the anointing of a lion be bold that's the gospel and peter in chapter four of acts they get called before the council because of it and peter peter who denied jesus three times just lays into him the same jesus whom you crucified lays into him and the council says in verse 13 it says they took the they noticed the boldness of peter and john it specifically mentions the boldness and recognize that they had been with jesus and they go back they get scourged they get told look whatever however this man got healed whatever happened jesus didn't raise from the dead he didn't heal him so just be quiet about it and don't share the name of jesus and peter just turned and looked at him and said i cannot help but share the name of jesus to speak his name and he went back and they told the saints on what had happened and how they'd been abused by the council and the church all got together and they cried and they boo and they asked god to deliver them and and to help them through such difficult trials no that's not what happened turn with me over to acts chapter 4. there is a boldness that takes place under this anointing under this gospel and being let go verse 23 they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them and when they had heard that they they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hath made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in it who by the mouth of thy servant david has said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against christ for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom now has anointed both herod and pontius pi pilot with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done and now lord behold thy threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth a hand to heal that the signs and wonders may be done in the name of the holy child jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they had assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness i i can't help but think you know there's a couple places where the ground shook the other place speaking of boldness with paul and silas were in prison and they they were locked up and they were shackled and their chain there and and they could have been boohoo and they could have been asking for deliverance but they begin to sing they begin to praise god and the bible says that the jail house was shaken and it's just me but i can't help but wonder if god in this instance and acts and later on with paul that god got so moved that he said that's my child that's my kids he got so excited he had to shake the earth because nothing else god got excited seeing the boldness of his children in practice be bold with the gospel oh don't be don't brother braham said this is a this you gotta remember brother brahms the one who preached the oddball but he said don't be odd don't be rude if they won't accept it dust your feet and walk on but don't be afraid to share what god has given you and when you're under that lie and anointing you feel that boldness upon you and especially if you're a new christian don't let anybody totally let anybody steal your joy don't let anybody steal that fire share what you got because it's a and anointing didn't last long for the church didn't last a whole long time it was about the first 300 years now that's not to say that there weren't times i believe that luther under the anointing of the man had a little bit of the lion when he walked down to the church house one day when his with his thesis under the anointing of the man he wrote it but under the anointing of the lion he nailed it to the door these god can change directions whenever he wants whichever way he directs under that anointing matthew under that lion anointing you'll go that way sometimes and sometimes he'll switch and go a different direction and and you know that lion anointing we talk about the five-fold ministry the the lion anointing is the evangelist that's just it doesn't mean he's not doesn't have some of the other anointings but predominantly an evangelist is underlying anointing hey he don't have to stick around and and see where the chips fall he comes in he preaches he lays it out he he he's got boldness he's on fire the whole church is praising they're jumping all over the place he's under a lying anointing you got sick among you come up here boom meanwhile the pastor is under a knocks anointing brother ram said he was the ox of the of the team he carries the weight he's the one that picks up the chips he's the one that after peter cuts off an ear puts the balm on he's the one he's under under predominantly an ox anointing the teacher is under a man anointing it's not to say that teachers can't get bold i love it when a teacher gets so excited about what he's preaching he just forgets he's a teacher and just becomes an evangelist for a while or a pastor does doesn't mean you're stuck in any water there's a there's a there's an overall progression of the church heading towards an eagle anointing but in different times we don't throw the we don't throw the other three gospels away just because we're under the eagle anointing do we we'll get to the eagle and anointing this afternoon well we'll talk i think i got enough time to at least break open on the oxen ointing here well we see matthew the kingdom of heaven that reference over and over again all the parables setting up the kingdom letting us understand that the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violence taketh by force and we see this because he's preparing the way for the next horse rider that red horse rider where war is going to break out and he's going to be red with the blood of the saints and jesus makes this proclamation he says i didn't come to bring peace but a sword doesn't mean that jesus is the one who declares war but when the gospel comes there's going to be a battle when god opens opens the door when god begins to move when god begins to enter into your life that's when the fight comes there's a quote brother branham says you know somebody asked him i said you know when you get the holy ghost can you make small mistakes can you can you do things that are wrong and i'm paraphrasing here she'll forgive me if i don't get it just exactly right but brother braham says oh certainly he says that's when the battle begins until you have the holy ghost you have no defenses you have nothing to withstand the assault of satan you will give in you will fall you will be pulled under eventually but god raises a standard against it through the new birth through the holy ghost to to carry you through to get you through whatever's coming down the road amen all right now remember the first age was the lion age the lion age of the tribe of judah christ is his own influence of life taken that age that's the first beast which means power that answered the human voice the next was the ox age the dark horse riders age see now the reason the first age was a white age i always heard people say that the first rider the white was the power of the church going forth to conquer we found out he was given a crown and that was it it was the church it was a church but where did it go went to rome that's what he did he received the crown now the second age was a red horse rider which is the dark age now and brother branham being in the role of a restorer remember i said i can't preach anything new william branham didn't preach anything new when he preached the seals where did he go back to matthew 24. he went back into the bible people are critical from him because because he didn't pull something out of the air if he had pulled something out of there they just said you can't add to or take away from the bible which is absolutely true which is why he went into the bible and connected the dots and we see irenaeus the second church age messenger we got church age yeah right there radius there he is right there right above paul arena said this he said for the cherubims two were four faced their faces were the images of dispensation of the son of god the first living creature was like a lion symbolizing his effectual working his leadership and royal power the second was like a calf signifying his sacrificial and sacred order and the third hat as it were the face of a man an evident description of his advent as a human being and the fourth was a flying eagle pointing out the gift of the spirit hovering with his wings over the church and therefore the gospels are in accord with these things among which christ is seated he had a pretty good revelation back then but we had a prophet who came in this day who took that and and and opened it to us and help us to see even more what was going on and we have the benefit of looking back in time and seeing that that first age for about 300 years that white horse rider went and at the end of that first 300 years he gets a crown right now i want you to understand he was given a crown jesus earned the crown remember satan offered him one ban down and worship me and i'll give you all the kingdoms of the world jesus said you're not giving me anything right amen when that crown of thorns was placed upon his head he could have at any moment that's right separated eternity and and time and allowed the angels to pour out of heaven into this world and cleanse it clean but he allowed the thorns to be placed upon his head and those scars will be there through all eternity he earned it but satan was given a crown here at the at the at the around 380 the fourth century two uh major events take place that that switches over from the lion age into the ox age and that was first the the council of niacia actually i'm getting my dates mixed up here i think it was constantine maybe first the constantine or or nicea that was first i don't remember they were within a few years of each other that's all that matters i'm not a historian friends but in that that fourth century what takes place is constantine gets a vision and he says under this sign you will conquer and he places the cross upon his shields and he switches pagan rome to papal rome and the roman empire that put thousands of christians to death in the lion's dens and in the gladiatorial arenas who who paul worked with and for to persecute the church suddenly became its biggest hero and what happened is satan jumped from his white horse to his red horse he'd secured at niacia he secured his religious goals the first stage of his ministry we've got a and this is how he works and i want to break this down for you we'll get into the other stuff this afternoon but we can look at the catholic church and we can say yeah you got off track here you got off track there but remember with things became traditions became doctrine which rendered the gospel of no effect don't think it doesn't try to get in to message churches brotherham did this brother did that show me a quote and not an isolated quote but show me his life that went with it and and it's fine you want to wear an eagle boat buckle that is fine but if you think that you have any spiritual significance to wearing an eagle belt buckle that you're getting an extra star in heaven you're rendering the gospel of no effect but the gospel says that you weren't good enough so christ did it for you and now you're accepted in the beloved the whole world is looking for acceptance accept me accept me as i am i i'm a man who wants to become a woman so i can win a gold medal at swimming accept me as i am even though i couldn't accept who i was oh we're gonna get kicked off youtube for this i don't know it's the truth anyhow but people are looking for acceptance and and and we'll we'll get to it maybe later but we'll just open it now brother bram skipped all around on the seal so i do it too so they the church makes merchandise of hope oh you can be accepted you're homosexual god will accept you the way you are and there's a truth there he certainly will but he won't allow you to stay the way you are [Applause] peter said some of you were effeminate you were man stealers you were adulterers you were killers you were you were all these things some of you were those things but god you know those are the two the two greatest words in the entire bible the entire human language the two most important words in the entire human language are these but god i don't care what situation you're facing i don't care how the devil comes against you you introduce those two words under the anointing of a lion and boldness or the anointing of an ox of god i've carried about as much as i can stand but god will step in satan you've come against me but god will prevail with with with the intelligence of a man devil you've done this before and it never worked out for you so guess what but god is going to going to help us or you can step in one of the anointing of an eagle but god is watching over me but god meant this for good what you meant for eagle all these different anointings playing all right i'm winding down i got that clock's right right okay all right so we'll break into the to the uh uh to the ox here we'll get into that because we see that that first 300 years that's where we're going the first 300 years we see that and the red horse rider starts to ride and from 300 a.d to about 1500 a.d that red horse rider rides and it's all at war what was kind of under the covers before remember in the first church age you hate the deeds of the nicolaitans now they're sneaking into the church and now now it's open warfare now christians are dying for their faith all these things are taking place and we enter into this ox time and and as we talk about this and i'll reiterate it this afternoon the ox time i know the the ox age is the probably the least glamorous we don't think of an uh an ox or a calf as being that powerful but i don't think any of you any of you would willingly jump into the bull ring in madrid or mexico city an ox has got some power when he needs it it's not the strength of a lion you don't hitch a lion to your your cart you hitch an ox to it there's some strength and power there i've seen ox's fling lines there's some strength there but it's a persevering it's an enduring brother branham preached perseverance or persevering that message 14 times more than any other message that was you know as preachers we have pocket sermons if i go somewhere and i don't know what to preach i got two or three of them that are always when i'm in a jam i know god works for him he always shows up when i preach those sermons perseverance was brother branham's because he knew we would be going through some ox ages we'd be going under an ox anointing 1200 years the church spent under an oxen window it's not the most glamorous time there's going to be times in your christian walk where you don't feel the power of god abraham went 25 years brother graham said without hearing the voice of god most y'all go 25 days and you ain't talk to god you're in so much deep trouble i know i am 25 years but it's an ox age we'll read the opening and mark because schofield has i'm not i'm not a great speaker obviously i'm enthusiastic i've got energy uh i'll make a a joyful noise i i preach slightly better than i sing which is awful i heard amen out there somebody heard me saying brother wade have you been listening to me singing if i could have been called to do anything we don't get choices in this life i would love to be able to sing like the angels i croak like a frog but the writer the second gospel mark also called john was the son of the new testament testament mary's and the nephew of barnabas he was associated to the apostles apostles and as mentioned in the writings of paul and luke lists all the scriptures you can look it up yourself date of mark has been placed between a.d 57 and 63. the scope and purpose of the book are evident from its contents in it jesus is seen as the mighty worker rather than the unique teacher it is the gospel of jehovah's servant of the branch as matthew is the gospel of the branch unto david jeremiah 33 15 everywhere the servant character of the incarnate son is manifest the key verse is 1045 for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister the characteristic word is straightway a servant's word there is no genealogy for who gives the genealogy of a servant the distinctive character of christ and mark is set forth in philippians 2 6 through 8 who thought it not robbery amen to become a servant but this lowly servant who emptied himself with the form of god was found in fashion as a man was nevertheless the mighty god as mark distinctly declares in one one and therefore the mighty works accompanied are authenticated and authenticated his mystery ministry as befits the servant gospel mark is characteristically a gospel of deeds rather than words james was a reader of mark james was under an anointing uh a a an ox anointing fakes faith without works is dead there's there's times in your christian walk i i'd love to be a prosperity preacher i'd love to be so easy but i'm one of those ministers who's been called to preach the truth and certainly there is some prosperity to the gospel god promised to bless you absolutely but you're not getting a crown without a cross there are things you're going to have to give up there are sacrifices you're going to have to make there are going to be loved ones that you lose along the way there are going to be friends that turn their back on you there's going to be heartache there's going to be pain that is the reality of life we know this and i guess we'll end here and i don't know if i shared this with you all before but a christian never loses really loses anything you know that never lose anything brother brown had a chair him and his wife bought making payments on it times got hard they couldn't make payments on that chair got taken he had a dog when he was a 16 year old boy fritz he loved that dog we get attached to animals you know that's that's part of our uh some some of y'all that aren't animal lovers some of us are just fulfilling the six day commandment to oversee god's creation and take care of his critters all right that's all right we'll take care of that part but that he had a dog fritz and a horse prince when he went beyond the curtain of time that dog that a policeman had killed i was waiting there for him his horse prince was there and when he went in the house there was a chair sitting there [Applause] he said his wife said they won't take this one so we get into the ox age you know this there's going to be sacrifice there's going to be pain there's going to be hard times if i if i told you any less i wouldn't be an honest preacher but know this god will carry you through and a christian never loses anything i have not seen nor is it entered into the heart of man or his imagination what god has prepared for his children i don't know what's waiting for us there but i'll tell you this there is not a single one of you that's going to be disappointed remember those brothers said brother branham is going to be hunting there is going to be hunting they live for hunting brother bram live for hunting he said you won't even miss it don't get too attached to the stuff here god knows the desire of your heart you never know what it might be waiting for you on the other side let go of it amen we'll pick this up this afternoon won't the musicians come you love him today i hope this was a help to you [Applause] [Applause] man and eagle amen the holy ghost you got in your soul it's not something you got to look for it's there if you got the holy ghost what did i tell you at
