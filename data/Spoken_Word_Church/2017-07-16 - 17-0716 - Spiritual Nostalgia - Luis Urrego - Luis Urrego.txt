TRANSCRIPT
========================================
don't want to stay later time they'll leave down that cord a custom yeah all right we cannot discuss how many know what nostalgia is right hey everybody always have experienced nostalgia at some point or another I tend to be a very rustic type person I can leave it at the Latino and you know yes you know feelings and all that stuff you know this but uh still careful okay yeah you wish for better times and uh you know some of the things that make me nostalgic and of course childhood memories and you know for me it was a it's music it's a video game that I used to play you know sometimes I have fun you can have access to video games now that used to be Jewish to play and sometimes I get into that and like wow but then it kind of leads to a point where like man it doesn't lead anywhere right it doesn't really fulfill you fulfilled you for a moment but then it doesn't really bring anything - you can't relive those days again right right same thing with I don't know maybe a smell of cologne or perfume or something like that you smell that and I you think mine that takes me back to when I was with such-and-such girl or with such as that guy where I used to wear this trying to impress yeah such and such a part of you know yeah but wait does it have that right it's another very what you got there you know sometimes you're at a restaurant and you hear a certain song and you remember oh my that was at such a place this was happening my not that's a feeling of nostalgia now the feeling of nostalgia there's nothing wrong with it within itself right but it's you dwelling in that feeling thinking that that feeling is going to change your present situation when it's never I change or you're in the situation and I think I broke in and so sometimes we uh you know we grab things to fulfill that but we realize it only brings temporary pleasure now the Webster's dictionary of the words of saga means a wistful or excessively sentimental yearning for return to or of some past period or irrecoverable condition you can't bring back you can't recover those times back certainly you can recover things that were recorded from that and kind of live it in the moment but you can't you can't fully live back those days again right now and also a pleasure and sadness that it's caused by remembering something from the past and wishing that you could experience it again I was questioning that God wants to be said the other time trying to live in the past now we're going to look at something here in a moment that God does want us to remember and the past is very important because that's where we grow that's where we learn things right now I want to get ahead of myself but this is what Solomon said in Ecclesiastes say not thou what is the cause that the former days were better than these for thou does not enquire widely concerning destroy my question is to you do you think that Solomon is saying that is that nostalgia's is bad come as you obviously he's talking about uh nostalgia we haven't rust out or thinking about the former days right but it's nostalgia that within itself no but it's bad when you try to think that going back to that time is going to change your present condition right that's what's wrong the atonement is not talking about the actual feeling of nostalgia but the foolish attitude that nostalgia can lead someone to have you know sometimes we don't feel that the past is there in some way or another than your present condition especially if you're going through some trial in your life or you're some sickness in your life you think my things were better back then but you have to realize that God has you in in a in a position in our place that you are right now if you're a Christian if you're one of his children he's trying to mold your character right he's trying to make you into his very image whereas right now you're closer to the very image than you were 10 15 20 years ago but where at least you should be Roger 7 so dwelling in the past our thinking the things were better back then it's not going to make things better now you have member Christ is a living Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a ever-present God and he wants us to recognize that he's always present ever-present help in the time of trouble it's what the Bible says right and and you know not not trying to be critical but you know I've heard testimonies of people especially older older individuals where they said I wish we could go back to the good old days the good old days not you know and I'm cinder thinking you know and it kind of make you feel like my good old days what about my good old days this now I have teared old things - yeah my my good old days don't matter but their good old days is just if you're not there but what if I feel young people for a young person now about oh my they're nothing like my good old days you know they'll think what about my fiddle didn't what about my days my former days you know so it almost makes you feel it makes me make you look a little bit self-centered when you talk about how my days were better than yours and your present situation now so so that's just uh that's just something we got we got to be careful to be mindful of people's situations now you know be mindful of people's present conditions but now what they're experiencing now certainly what you had it was was great and that's your experience that's what you experienced but also remembering there's other things that people experience in now or that the words very important to other people as well even younger than you right right I don't need that be critical and saying I don't know if anybody here has done that just I just heard of people other people in the past kind of like the attitude they take but now let's bring it down home spiritually the agree that living in the past is a form of losing touch of reality of the present today get in and unfortunately that's how many Methos believers live we live with a spiritual nostalgia exactly how they live a lot of room left and you see it now even more than ever go I've talked to two to two believers who believe this madness for a long time who lived in the times of brother Branham I noticed that just say man I wish we could just get back to those times not realizing that you're never going to relive those days in Contra but you are going to live should be living the message that was preached there you know that's what we need to be concerned about level brother Bob was talking about you know on Wednesday I want to know what he said not just what he did but I don't know what he said that's right because what he said is what's going to change me into what he is in manhood see it as if we're trying to relive the day and you have a lot of people nowadays they're trying to relive those days back Lederman's listening to the tapes we're going to get back to the tapes yes definitely we got to get back to the taste we currently do over to win we got to listen to the tapes we've never I don't think anybody here has ever stopped listening to the tapes but to try to use the tapes to join right to try to relive moments in the past even listening to them in places where there or even preach that to think that that's going to bring you know things and stir a revival of some sort that's not going to do it if it's not Christ in you the hope of glory it's not going to stir revival no matter how much how much the tape won't change where the brain is message the screws through the tape won't change you if you just have it up here but you don't bring it down to your heart you can do it that to appetit to our present day right because Christ wants us to remember Christ wants us to the unwanted stuff to be stolen in the past just as well in the factor but he wants us to dwell on the past in order to learn from the past and to it - to our to put it into practice - that right there amen so a lot about you know messes believers that you know they live in their lives looking at what was the good old days of the message and telling to live what the message is producing today but there is you know some some some of us we get criticized for saying for being like Jesus Christ I'm saying I I'm a father of one yeah and you're going to get criticized that's really revealed to you and that's really a revelation that has come from here down to here and that you're living that you're going to get criticized then you're going to even get persecuted not by the world my people is claimed to believe his mattress Brooke food if the people within it was Judas trip within the disciples that Jesus said this thing would be so close that it will deceive the very life if it was toxic that's right it'll come down so close they'll believe the same message is my cue I believe that God sent a prophet in their families our prophet just like you but they think but they can't produce what God has revealed to you which is you are one of your his you are God amen amen that's very powerful sure that's very powerful saying yes so there's some scriptures some scriptures that dumb actually here in Ephesians is that wherefore he says awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead in Christ shall give thee life see them that ye walk circumspectly not as fool's but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil so when you're constantly brother just dwelling in the past and thinking that the past is going to change you is that redeeming the time now you're living in the past that you're not living in the present than what God is doing now right my god and you know these days are evil this part we need to do whatever we we can we can in order to redeem the time in order to to to to to two things that will help us to grow into as well as to help people in in the present time right wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is now what the will of the Lord was but the will of the Lord was is always it wasn't a beginning it was now right okay so then entertained all these things I'm not saying you know I'm not I'm not trying to be critical lucky prophet or nothing like that that he had this place just as Moses had this place and he fulfilled they fulfilled their pledge subject but it was there was a time that Joshua had to move on with the payment right right really midnight and that's the same thing that the holy ghost wants it's trying to do with his people with his bride it's to carry them on to another to another position I'm into it - Canaan right not to have your tent put your tent there in the 1950s in the 1960 and leave it there no but we're living in 2017 but it's guys doing now that tent need to go up then their nail to get rusty in this states again trust the unit we need to bring them up and move on this Christ is moving on it if you don't you don't move the crowd huge is going to be left there you gonna be left there and that's the thing I like about Donnie the gentleman he's not going to force you to do anything that you don't want to do if you like living in the 1950s and the 1960s and was in the glory days of the Prophet and all these things but that's up to you but Christ is moving on era right the message is still here and that now one economist I want to say something about that here just a moment because it has to do with the voice not the not not not the not the actual messenger but the voice of the seventh angel what the Bible says right right this what brother Brennan says here and in it I can't find really a good good quote about this I'm I'm not the best at the at the search software and I know evolving Joe and several ways probably better than it that I didn't than I am but rather when I mentioned this a lot of time he said now we find out that the churches to are always promising something like television so for that they never get to the thing they promised as I have often said an old quotation man is always praising God for what he did praising God for what he will do looking forward to what he will do and then ignore what be doing better see they failed that's the way they become history after a while of the polluted sea because they fail to recognize now you can talk of the comfort Christ yet once you talk about the things that that does it through brother branham point right and say that that that a comfort he will give it in the ages to come but refuse the comfort that he's got here now for you that's terrible see it's on the same basis we find that amen now so so so spiritually nostalgic believers you know they're just living it and that they'd gone by and you want to find a lot of I went especially who lived during that time and and it's great to be able to reminisce and for them to be able to tell us their experiences with the Prophet and things like that but for them to not move on with what this message has was was really all about because we're a brand appreciation for him this message to us for you in there amen you know he came to his position we got to come to our pepper and it was this word that brought him to that position is the same word that's going to bring us to that same position right amen so try to relive the days of the Prophet again you know plain tapes and even claim them in the same place of those tapes were recorded at but they fail to bring the word preached in those days into their present lives ever that's it a lot of I would say I would venture to sell the majority of message believers so-called masses relievers do that and you know I think we can only learn from the past you can't learn from the present you can't learn from the present you can't learn from because we're living it now now what I just said is in the past you can learn from that but you can't learn from the present you can't learn in the future because it hasn't happened yet but you can learn from the past right and all of the tapes the Bible was even written in the past were special right the physical body so that's what we learned from men we learn from this media and all you think everything a video that you watch it took place in the past therefore you can learn from so I'm not saying we need to get rid of the tapes or anything like that there's nothing we need those tapes amen we need the Bible even though it was written the past and there's a history behind us those things right and we can only learn from those things but a lot of people take the past to bring up grudges or to bring up a sadness and things in their lives that bring them to a standstill and they can't move on anymore but God doesn't want us to bring the past to bring us to a standstill to sadness and to to have a you know jealousy and all the things not what's not for that it's to learn from it and to give us faith for the future evident in it and to give us faith and to bring us to repentance true and all those things God wanted because there are many scriptures that got in the scripture many scriptures that God says to remember remember remember but it wasn't for them to reminiscence and just have that nostalgic feeling but you know it was for them to remember to learn from it to move on with what they've learned from right that's what God wants us to do they're not just to be spiritually nostalgic right right so so to have those feelings it's not the purpose for us to revisit the facts we need to pass amen and here's some scriptures of there's some scriptures just dip it just as a example Deuteronomy 7 thou shall say in thine heart these nations are more than 9 how can I just possess them thou shalt not be afraid of them but shall shop well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh and unto all each of my 1st chronicles said if they come to the lord call upon his name make them make known his deeds among the people sing unto him sing song something I'm talk to you of all his wondrous works glory in the Holy Name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord in his trench seek his face continually remember his mark remember his marvelous works that he has his wonders and the judgments of his mouth man but when you remember it causes you to seek the Lord to seek his face continuously Revelation 33 this is this is Jesus talking to the Church of Sardis remember therefore how thou has received and heard and hold fast and repent that's the purpose of remembrance so skipping out here so those resources there the message and all those things that were there for us to teach us and do I just have nostalgic feelings over those packs but I'm into future so that we can have we repent now we need to repent now and to give a safe for the things that we need faith now to give us faith for the things that we need them in the Tetra right now to dwell in the past or to obsess over former days when brother Brendan was allowed and his works is to yearn for something we can never attain we'll never live those days again right but we could certainly live the message he preached that's what we can live right Dave I'm gonna try because if you try to live it not the step but in any any other way if you try to live in the past or bring the past back to try to get satisfaction out of it it's just going to lead to a heartbreak you know you're not going to lead you anywhere and so the Bible doesn't say but in the days of the messenger right revelation 10 7 I said but in the day to avoid a become a seventh danger now that voice is the same voice that's going through you and me as well and I know right because this is the same God working through brother random as it is working through you and me and it's the same Holy Spirit and this bride has just as much of a voice not the same position that brother Baron had as a prophet but has just as much of that voice as the Prophet had because it's Christ it was it it was Christ speaking through those tapes I tried it was in its Christ speaking to us and that's right it's it's uh it's not your own word the brides and I'll speak her own thing neither the brother branham speak his own saying but of course he has it his opinions just as a man and that's what a lot of people felt to see to that he was a man just like me who had opinions who had thoughts who had who had ideas but when he came to the Word of God it was the workshop and I it was dust that the Lord the truck and he wasn't infallible he did you know we're not we're not we're not him felt a certain style building righteous or fallible estate you can make mistakes it was an empowering we're not infallible but spiritually through him we know we are talking if we've been born again inside America the soul is empowered amen they took taken us back to that Genesis 1:26 man right where's others working so well when I'm talking to my trying to say is it's pointing us back to that so put it there right absolutely because he is they meant so now you look like my train itself I'd okay I got a little is okay never for me I went for you fell for me I got something okay going so if I will extract the Prophet yes and probably the top thank you think if you think these people again no no so that's what that's what crisis is trying to is that's what Christ well that's what a lot of people you know feel that you know they've been programmed in a game of dates and one as a man he made it mr. old yet another person that didn't make mistakes of human was there anything that I do otherwise he wouldn't been able to die for a second and the Savior that he is for cement demanding Great God but so in Revelation 10 sentences but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shrinking things on try and it's that voice that we need that we need to listen to a pay attention to it and take in our lives again not for not to just reminisce not to just wish those days were back again but to move forward with what God is trying to show us now timing things gracious every time you go now there's the less scriptures Paul said here delicious 3:13 brethren I count on myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus and that's the same thing when you can do they meant take your things politics everything that was in the Old Testament and the thing that happened in through Christ is alive of Christ and and moving forward and then but not just what nice to always what if Paul would have just stayed I wish I was living in the times of Christ again you know what I wish I you know I wish I didn't do to whatever whatever with with Stephen you know when he was stoned what if he was distraught I'm sure that probably bothered him was right you know him being a compass of Stephens death with it Stephen right sure it was Stephen but he had to move forward because he had to attain amen Christ you know thinking with what talking to people I think I'm wanting to go back to that ethnic peace in World War II and you had a lot of miracles happen the word was going out and that's not here today in that tradition they didn't individual gold around the world filled your pockets not beer yeah so he tears that's right well I guess the word go important and add to what you're saying on the guest one point a glance of the lecture what you're talking about what we think of the things we think of it sometimes we don't want to think of but we build on that see those are those are those have fallacies they're they're fallible they're very things that we made mistakes because that's the first thing our members the mistakes I made well but the infallibility of God's Word takes you all day all the way back that Denson 1:26 man and it never we go back to that it never had a beginning never had em but it is develop this so those thoughts are eternal and really you're not because Paul's telling us east and you say in here he said forget those things which are behind in other words not to take that - well Paul said now we need to forgive the old testament that just living use it as my way saying perteet it forget the things in other words this bothering you that hinders you from behind the temporal things but the infallible thing we have to build on that because they all God's Word is infallible so as far as we look back it's okay to have because I read in Corinthians they were model said Paul tells us that the Old Testament giving does for example and their examples but for us to live on are for us to change shadows correctly but it's but it could be even being shadowed this a reality yet because God's Word how a shadow is a reality so what we're looking back is creating and building on things that are returned build your hopeful thing you but we look back those the things that we look back nostalgia would jump music and cars on that temple all that's temporal even the things you did is a center that temple and you're watching it I think you know that I've done I was talking to Lord open or not I'm sorry but what I did in the past you know and I didn't have to list them you know what came to my song he's ever going we go doesn't mean hope you began to panic we don't I'll really sit in your business sit on the throne somewhere you know he's there Lord forgive me my family yes we believe that there's a sea of forgetfulness that has because that's why it's got something like this 126 man is infallible we hear that he was all these things but he's no power because it's infallibility of God boarded what mate is what produces that destined one conceived and that's what we must live there's got to be empowered because it's the Holy Ghost themselves man is the is that bear believe believe it better be empowered yeah but the things we look for behind it where the human that stuff goes away but there is a spiritual nostalgia that is good because because it takes back in and you learn from the things of the Old Testament even the things in the prophets life even thing to the prophets man that's what we learn from yes so we have to look back you had that is we have to look and really if it's hard on you don't look like but it is this is the continued no they just know but forgetting the things which are behind Paul should know he killed Stephen he persecuted the Christians that's what he taught he talked about let's forget about the word that was preached you know no because it's really not flash is here is here never present work so it's good to do the bucket you're gonna vote with the in 2010 we but that second time that costs about I was there my instead of me okay look at that until unknown and we got loud min so you don't have my momentum all right not good good good looking wishing real able teach about what answers [Music]
