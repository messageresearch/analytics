have him here on Tuesday so uh we'll just uh I'll keep announcing it and I'll give it to brother Ryan and let him announce it but just pray for all these pray for the ones that are not here today the ones that are sick the ones that are traveling uh Zach and Anna are traveling be gone for a few days so just remember them and all the different ones so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this afternoon Lord the morning's done as we were thinking the other day when I wrote down 8 31 23 . that's the last one we'll see there won't be another day every time of day he goes by that day is gone Lord I pray that you'll help us spend that day sometimes somehow praise in your name Lord either lift in our hands reading the Bible praying for someone speaking to someone helping someone in need because that day will never get back we'll never recover that Lord I pray that you'd be with each one Lord just bless us here now in September we've got a few months coming up around all the November and December hustle and bustle Lord let us not forget you but let us Lord make everything be centered around you and father just bless this day keep us safe give us their daily bread we were the ones that are sick brother Dale sister Dale Terence got all a little stomach trouble I prayed should be with him Lord touch their bodies just bless each one now in Jesus name Amen in the beginning was the word where it was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh endorsed Among Us he didn't mind that so I don't mind being in flesh and him being in me all right and he don't mind being in your flesh or if you'll let him and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 3 3 says Jesus answered and said verily verily I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God then we're going to continue on with this thought a little bit from Revelations 19 6. and I heard I heard as it was The Voice voice of many of great multitude a voice of many Waters voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent all-knowing King reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready you may be seated in the Lord has blessings and to her was granted that she should be a raid and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is a righteousness of the Saints you know you you read that scripture and you you it looks like we're going to get something there but thank God for a prophet that told us we're going to get our robe here we're not going to get our robe there when you talk about robes getting robes there you're talking about foolish version you're talking about um 144 000 you're talking about the souls under the altar they're going to get a uh uh not a robe of I'm sure we probably will be wearing white but the robe is robe of righteousness not a robe of cloth all right so the robe of righteousness when he gives you the new birth then he gives you that rope hey man because you're just as Eternal as God is if you're born again today so you have that righteousness but you still have to get yourself ready what it says and then she if you didn't have to make yourself ready we just become righteous no we have the righteousness of God inside of us but we do have a spirit realm that we have to work with and that Spirit realm is what we're working on now all right you must be born again there's no way around it there's no way to get by it you've got to be born again or you're lost there's no gray area all right but then as we get we're born again as newborn babies in Christ and we'll get to it maybe a little bit we still have to grow the Bible is always in a growth development it always talks about seed and it always talks about plants and it always talking about spring summer fall and winter and it's always talking about the evolving and changing of man God never changes thank God all right so he's he's steady he's constant but we change but he knows that we were going to change so he put that in his plan that he allows us to change but he compels us to change into His Image not change here on Earth but change into His Image we're definite Listen Listen by default you're gonna look like your parents oh my God by default by default you're gonna look like your parents and not by your fault but by default you are going to look like your natural parents but you have a you have a choice whether you want to look like your heavenly parents all right and then what does that do that changes us into that image puts us in a different family and then what it does it literally changes the way we look puts us in a whole different family you look at the family out there look at your family that's not born again you don't look like them you don't have the tattoos you don't have the earrings you don't have the makeup you don't have the cut hair you don't have the long hair you don't have the beard drinking or just you see what I mean even that even that little bit you've been separated and even though genetically you're not changed but you're changing your appearance because of what's inside hey man your appearance changes listen you can tell brother Louise and I were talking about something in here a few minutes ago and I'll elaborate on it but you can tell when something's wrong with somebody or when something's going on kind of a little bit off you can see it in your face you can tell it by your demeanor that because you know what generals say all right what's wrong because she's known me for 44 years well longer than that but 44 years we've been married she said what's wrong we got a problem what's wrong why I never have to say a word because my demeanor changes and yours don't okay well then it's just pray for me and sister Jim amen you don't have to say it so loud okay you got ear plugs down like Gina okay just hard of hearing okay remind me never to use that again but but I mean but we're changed into the kingdom of God what are we supposed to do God is supposed to and he will understand you better than you understand yourself right because you're not two separate people if you're born again you're one person June was born from a different family from me and word genetically we're different but coming together we brought forth children but God is Not genetically different from something else of his own self he is he can't genetic he can't I can't say un he can't uh he didn't go marry somebody and then have something that looked kind of like no God we were made in His image so anything he produces anything he produces is in His image and you know what praise God he can't help it either you or your parents couldn't help you I mean look at Ruth bless your heart she's looked like that for 40 something well she's not really that old you know maybe 15 to 20 years here we go I'm bouncing from this one somebody help me [Music] help him Lauren yeah before stuff starts getting thrown at me but but look at Ruth Ruth looks just like her daddy and mama kind of mixed but she looks a lot like her dad she always has she can't help that she can stretch pull you know get older you ain't got a wrinkle on your face stop it of course you know what your dad don't have any either so see you understand what I mean though you can look at that and say well boy that's that's the fan that's the Hamptons family why because they look like each other well now why can't we as the family of God when we come together look like each other and discern that you're either in the family or not now listen there are people in your family that you don't like to deal with too much I don't know why I looked at you Esther but bless your heart um I'll get over here and get somebody over on this side next time but there are in your family there's always that one cousin hey hey man there's always that one cousin you know do you know Terrence still no but I know Jim do you know Samuel my dad no I know Marshall well see there's always that one that stands out well same way in the gospel I don't know why I'm doing this but anyway but that's the way we are in the gospel we're all in the same family but we all have our different and I took it out but I should have brought it back in here our diversity of gifts all right our diversity of gifts is not like I was explaining the other Wednesday night you know if it said brother Louise gets a an unction from the Lord and he stands up and prophesies that may be the only thing he does his whole life never prophesy again that's a gift that's excusa that's that's something that that God has given him and then took back away from it but he can't give him the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then take it back away from him all right so that puts us all in the family but we have diversity of gifts just like your hands and your feet they all have everything functions if you really think Even in our fallen condition our bodies are are almost perfect how can you get a machine to run for 80 something years even though we might have our issues and problems but that heart pumps and you don't even think one thing but you have never in your life ever had to say our heart our heart there might be times when you might have thought that in your head but you never had to say that why because God made a machine that was right he made a machine that was perfect a man but now we know we you know brother Kali right we're in a fallen condition and that heart don't pump it's actually like it used to pump but it still pumps all right and we're still here but we have diversity of gifts just like our hands and and your body is like a uh you know they tell you to use your legs and not your back well that's because there's a there's a mechanical connection with all that that God's built in what are you trying to say God built your body perfect now if he built your natural body almost perfect what about the spiritual body he's building he's building a spiritual body that's not like perfect it is perfect so when we get into this talking about the the placing of in in adoption is you're placing let's talk about that because you can just say placing well what is that that's putting you that's putting you to where if you're the finger you've got to be there as that finger you got to be something a part of somebody get their hand cut off we had an uncle that got his hand cut off well I mean he adapted but you couldn't shake his hand wasn't nothing there to shake right so the body was what the body was a little bit off same way with anything else it happens to your body if there's something a little bit off you maybe can't walk right or something that's the same way it is in the body of Christ we have become sold out of joint I've been I read it to you this morning Satan got into Pulpit he disconfigured the word he he got it all out of joint and we just kept it that way because God but God said I will restore I'm gonna put this body back together and this body is not going to be a so much as we look in our neighbor as a perfect body but it's going to be a masterpiece because remember what made that Masterpiece the Masterpiece it was the flaw on its leg is what made it the masterpiece bringing God through human flesh to defeat the Devil is the greatest masterpiece like I said we have Satan's answer we now know where God resides we now know what God wants it's not to just do we're trying to think that well I ain't perfect you ain't perfect you don't like the world and like I said before they can put Jesus on the cross they can get him off the cross they can get him Resurrected but they can't get them back inside of themselves huh like we were talking about um sister Regina or somebody was talking about reformation or reforming you don't reform you can't reform people denomination oh Kathy denominations that is Reformation like I said this morning they'll reform you you'll get into AAA or you'll get in there we don't reform people right the new birth changes you see that you're still what you were until you're actually born again you can suppress it you can push it down you can do a a and praise God for those people they have helped millions of people but I always say what's an alcoholic always an alcoholic don't get around it don't smell it because you may go back no I tell you what you get born again one time with the spirit of God you get the Holy Ghost in your soul and they can pour alcohol on your body and you won't want it that's the god I want to serve that's the god I want to take care and eradicate that not under Reformation but restore restoration to restore everything back not just the gifts I want the word restored in power back into our life because remember signs follow the Believers if you get to believe in part right science will follow you but you're still what you were until you're actually born again the new birth is an experience just like I said something that takes place all right it takes you out of a situation and puts you in another one remember out of and into right it takes you out of a situation and puts you into the family of God sure we still have our traits of our old family we have a traits of our old nature even from the Devil think about it in your spirit realm the devil can still somehow connect his self to your memories and conscious affection and Imagination but that's what we've been trying to say that but once you're born again in your soul Satan cannot touch that space it is off limits he can't even he even if he tried it burn him up you talking about a burning hell he ain't seen nothing brother Ryan said he hasn't seen nothing until he touched that 200 million bolt of Jesus on the cross when he was in the Tomb he said I got you buddy he said oh he didn't know what he got a hold of because Jesus came out of the Tomb well guess what where's that guy living at today where's he living today he's living inside of you you got to believe that though but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you because it will be I permitted power I kind of stuck this in from from the this morning there is a permitted power brother Dale many years ago preached on permitted power because Satan has no power he is powerless just as he has made the formal Church powerless he is powerless he cannot do one thing he can't move until God tells him he can praise God I'm glad I'm not on his side no more he's a loser but in Revelation 6 forces that went out another horse that was red now remember what is a horse horse is a power and power was given to him he didn't have his own power Revelation 6 verse 7 when it opened a fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see I looked and behold a Pale Horse what another power and his name that said on him was white death and hell even death and hell has no power God had to give him the power that's right power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword hunger death and beast of the earth Revelations 13 7 it was given unto him to make war with a saint given and to overcome them and power is given him overall Kindred tongues and Nations but not over the bride listen we're gone that's what makes him powerless to us but this world is all listen all this world is held under his control I don't care who you I'm sorry this is where you have to be you know you it has to be a separation if People's not born again they are under the power of Satan regardless two Powers that's all and one really ain't a power it's permitted but Paul was given over all Kindred tongue in Nations then brother Brian tells us trying to skip to I want to get to something here in a minute how the Antichrist Spirit now look coming to the church defile it make it look more formal and Powerless now remember it didn't come into the bar room it didn't come into the Juke Joint as for y'all that live in the country you know what a juke joint is all right because there was a jukebox in it and you played remember brother random went into one one time and he got spanked by the Lord for being a little bit arrogant toward that sister that was in there and the cop and all that other stuff so but that was the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church he's not in the listen if you have to worry about the bar rooms and you need to get bored again but what he's done he's come into the through the walls of the church and tried to make it defiled lukewarm formal and Powerless because as I'm fixing to tell you there is no power in false Doctrine God does not have to honor anything that's false now look he winked at the ignorance of of Luther Wesley you know why because he had to get us he had to get a group of people as we were talking about this morning the Bride of the end time had to come on the same according to the Bible so God couldn't cut it off at Luther he couldn't cut it off at Wesley he had to and you know what I mean by winking you know sometimes you somebody tells something or you know it's like that cousin that I was talking about you know you just go that's just Jim you know so I just said well he didn't say well that's just Luther no he he needed Luther during that time or he wouldn't have called him he needed Wesley during that time listen their bride they're waiting on us so let's don't belittle I'm not trying to belittle him but they had their place Satan crap then remember brother Brown said the messenger went off the scene Satan Creeps in puts a denominational uh sticker on it and they died right there well God didn't do it Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth talking about the truth of one God and when they were blinded to it it wasn't long until the Church of Rome stopped baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Resurrection 1953 see I don't want to blame you people it's the pulpits where it started no wonder that's the damnation of the country when this is 1953 you'd think they'd be a little brother Aaron they'd be a little credibility in 1953 people still went to church and wore the sister still wore dresses and and tried I guess to live a better life than we do now but Lord look at it now no wonder that's the damnation of the country when Satan got in the Pulpit it's the truth failing to preach the unadulterated word of God Amen they failed to preach it and the word of God will produce just exactly what it said it would do but we explain it all away it's for some other day now here's one about the Masterpiece when Satan got a hold of it the deceiver he broke through the walls he marred the Masterpiece I'm going to paraphrase and he took what he took the family and he pulled the family apart the family was once fortified by the word of God or fortified by this word but it broke apart by Eve and what she did Adam went with her but listen the great sculptor thanked God when I read this I see grace I see so much grace and mercy God didn't have to do that he could have just let it fall but he didn't he had a purpose because he see he was going to use that he was going to use that Masterpiece he went to work immediately to build it up again and he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he's God and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately to build it again in unto his own image a man we know that was Jesus Christ but then where is it now it's in the body of Believers I believe we are the Masterpiece of the end time as the evil one deceived the first two Brides who Eve and Israel he will try to deceive the Bride of this last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself through Creeds are just plainly turned from the word to any sign that suits her wow but God never placed signs ahead of the word signs follow the word is when Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord when she did that the proper sign came come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word is energized by the spirit How can any messenger these people want to tear the message down messenger first actually How can any messenger sent from God believe only a part of the word and deny some of it the true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the whole word now he's making a pretty bold statement denominations will hate him his words may be as harsh as John the Baptist who called them bipers but the predestinated will hear remember what they'll hear the voice not a voice they'll hear the voice of God to turn away from that come out of her my people but the predestinator will hear him be ready for the Rapture that means they went through justification sanctification baptism in the Holy Ghost and come to adoption and come to the headstone we'll get into that and I know those words sometimes we throw them out there we don't explain them but we will be able to do that if the Lord tarries the Royal Seed of Abraham with light Faith as Abrahams will hold to the word what he held there for 25 years we can't hold on five minutes especially with our eyes closed for they are predestinated together 1963 this is the first sea on a watch and and I want you to see the the significance in this because he keeps saying church he keeps saying Church keeps saying church church I'll read it down through here you know you see I read it this morning it says Church but then he kind of pauses he said oh that just makes me tremble he says not Christ but the church it'll be revealed to the church listen Christ don't need to be revealed to himself he knows who he is we just don't know who he is and we don't know who we are now we do he says now but to the church notice oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it see what I mean you people he got to pause this he said I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand it in other words he said I'm talking to you I'm not talking to them out there amen Christ The Mystery of God revealed said then we stand justified in the presence of God that's a drop of ink dropping into a tub full of bleach you'll never find the stain event no more that's where you get the righteousness our robes are white by the blood bleach of the Lord it went somewhere but it'll never come back again and when man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it now look there's two there's two you got to see it and accept it sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished it's gone it's separated it's dropped into the ink of the blood of Jesus Christ and it's never to be remembered God forgets it and he stands you he stands that son and daughter of God in the presence of God talking about us amen and amen no we will be we are redeemed we have Satan's answer God has Vindicated who himself through what his bride God proves himself where his bride to his promise in this day Hallelujah the headship is here Christ the Risen Lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was oh no bro Wade brother Brandon took that with him well in the words of somebody that lived around brother random hogwasher that's just a lie of the devil but that the answer we have to the devil is I want you to really believe this never since the Lord Jesus walked on this Earth has Satan had any kind of a of an opponent yeah yeah he's had some opponents here and he's had a few here but nothing like you and I if we're to defeat him he's never been defeated before now sure he was defeated before the foundation of the world but remember these people dead laying in the grave waiting on you and I to come out waiting on you and I to get them out all right so the formidable opponent is you and I because remember what Jesus did and I sure Jesus died he had to die yes he had to die to release his life so that he can come back and me and you but he did that so we don't have to die he destroyed deaths right death Hell In The Grave has no part with us we just got to believe that and walk into it so we have Satan's answer we have the people we have the players on the field all of them Pros won't have no Waterboys anymore and we we know we've read this many times but there's been churches churches Brides Brides churches Brides brides he's making a point but there's got to come in other words that is that Luther Wesley all the way up that was a bride that was predestinated to be in that time and was the bride they had the Holy Ghost in their soul but as brother Ram said in one other quote he said they couldn't get all the way out of the denomination listen Luther come out but he didn't come all the way out he was a reformer he was trying to reform the Catholic Church but I'm going to read you here in just a few minutes that God said I hate that system you say God hates Bible said he did he said he did in the Book of Revelation he said he hated it he hated the doctrine of the Nicolaitans he hates false Doctrine listen God can't stand false Doctrine but there's got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride not to not that the other Brides were not real just like the Bible says to faithful and true witness not that he was false at one time because you're talking about Jesus Christ but the trueness of the day he needs to be in you and I can live in Pentecost we can live in Luther we live in Wesley but you will not mature as the Bride of Jesus Christ for the end time you've got to move up into this age to this time to this word to this updated Revelation not just coming from this church but this whole bride is moving yes if you're not moving you're behind backslid we got to keep moving even if it's one inch one step there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics makes that church live move and the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job when there's no Dynamics into it no matter how much the mechanics proves to be right there's got to be Dynamics to make it work all right that's what I want us to see that we we've got both but do we have the car over here in the can over here I mean that's gas I hope not it's water but it's gas this is Carr if that stays over here and this stays over here we're not going anywhere someone has to take the gas pour it in the car and who's left the bride denominations can't do it remember brother Brown said hey you all got plenty of money and no checks some of you Pentecostals has got plenty a big old checkbook and they got a dime in the bank he said if y'all ever get it together take the one that's got the chat take the one that's got the money put them together start writing checks same way with you and I to the bank of Heaven and I heard it was the voice of multitude voice of many Waters voice and mighty Thunder he's boys boys for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad to rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready now look the marriage of the Lamb has come comma and all right when you get married you when you get born again you get married to Jesus Christ right but you've got to make yourself ready that's the statue of perfect man amen that's the statue of perfect man we're talking about that's the getting ready part oh no bro wait I just got it and I'm ready I doubt that very seriously you gotta make yourself ready and it says Made herself and to her was granted that she should be a raid and find linen clean and white for the fine linen it's the righteousness of saints the comforter in 1961. we were talking about the drugstore and the diagnosis and all that this morning let's continue on now we have a sacred Trust you know what he's talking about you sisters that are not married that are virgins you have a sacred trust that no one brother Brown talks about it marriage and divorce I'm not going to hit it so deep but you do have you all have a sacred trust your body is sacred come on somebody please help these kids your body is sacred should be Untouchable until you get married because that sacred trust it's all through the Bible well listen aren't we supposed to be the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ not manhandle brother Brown said one is being manhandled denominational Doctrine false teaching that's being manhandled by Satan but we have a sacred trust you know what that trust is and we have an inheritance an inheritance that we inherit as believing children it's a sacred trust and that sacred trust in our sacred Heritage is the word of God that's been given to us the full word of God the word itself is the vitamin the word itself God's word that's where reason I'm so dogmatic we had a dogmatic preacher too brother Dale was dogmatic about the word of God and it being right and it being taught amen all right that's the reason I'm so dogmatic as I would call it on standing on this word no matter what anyone else says if it's not with the word then I don't believe it see if you want to believe it that's all right but to me it takes the word because heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never fail therefore it takes that word the token 1964. and we can when we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we have been accepted in Christ and that is our token that all we have met look all we have need of is already purchased by him we are identified with our token the token must be ready the blood Covenant blood is not recognized without the token all right the word assured us of the promise the token is the sign that the promise has been made for us full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to that token our token is a token to get out of here our token's not just to live right do right and sure it is it's all included but our ticket is not to a destination that we stop at it's a destination that we continue on over into another dimension no other way is there that you could ever be entitled look you've cut yourself off you can never be entitled to the token what the price that's been paid until you fully obey the word not what somebody's put into it and add it to it but what God said about it when he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down to the altar that don't mean walk back shake hands with a pastor that don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done I bet that hurt a lot of people's feelings it don't mean putting your name on a church book it means Death to Your First being and Life to your second being that's pretty plain it means that the blood has been applied and you're identified by the life of Jesus Christ like I said before you've moved over into another family you start acting like your real daddy all right and if he'd be divine we be the branches the life that's in the branch is also from the mind it will bear the fruit this is kind of where we stop this morning have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe I keep saying that because there listen there's a group of people that were sincere they had a pastor wherever that was Apollos Paul Pops in on a service he hears this great sermon but there's something missing there's something missing because the prophet Paul or the Apostle Paul is sitting in that congregation he passed through the upper coast of Ephesus finding certain disciples so if you found him he didn't just say hey God bless you I'll see you later now he fellowship with him went church with him listened to a sermon and he said after the sermon was over he said if you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe y'all doing really good he didn't condemn them so much he said you're doing good but if you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe what you're preaching our teaching our living and they said I hadn't heard that message before ain't no way he said we have not even heard whether to be a Holy Ghost that's kind of it's kind of strange for us to see but but you go and say that we did go somewhere else and you sat down and you walked into this message or church and you listened to what they said and you said if you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you you're you're a nice bunch of believers but if you receive the Holy Ghost there must have been had to be something Paul discerned that was missing because they said they said we have not so much as heard about this teaching of the Holy Ghost In other words we hadn't heard a sermon preached Paul said you got a few minutes you got a few minutes I'll tell you about this God that I serve I'll tell you about this holy ghost that you need and remember the Bible continues on with Paul laid hands on when they received the Holy Ghost well but then they became a powerful Church remember that was a church of Ephesus there's only about 12 people but brother Brown said it was a very mature Church a powerful Church Ephesians 4 says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good the use of edifying now that may be ministered that Minister Grace into the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God is thinking today in between services we have all this list of things that we would think of and we know that we can greet the holy spirit of God by the way we act by the way we maybe say something to somebody or my false Doctrine let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth you say oh no brother that's cussing you should have got rid of that a long time ago you should got rid of that bad conversation a long time ago so what's Paul talking about corrupt communication false Doctrine false teaching your own ideas God will absolutely be grieved listen he can't be happy with false Doctrine so if he's not happy with false Doctrine he's grieved he does not like it I'm gonna read it to you right here in just a second bitterness wrath anger clamor evil speaking there we go again speaking but you count one to another tenderhearted as God for Christ's sake and forgive one another as for Christ's sake has forgiven you possessing against the enemy brother round said now be real Reverend everybody is coming to a prayer line he said keep quiet see the holy spirit is so timid how many knows that just real timid Holy Spirit just any little Interruption bothers him Revelations 2 verse 15 says so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine where's that coming out of evil speaking that whole the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing I hate it he said that's your problem and in one place he said if you don't get away from that I'm gonna pull your Candlestick out oh he's such a good God yeah he's good you know why he's good he does what he says and he can't do anything but what is that but what he can't do anything but what his word has already said all right repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword word of my mouth how do you cure false Doctrine with truth and listen false Doctrine can't hang around truth we know that that's some of these ministers they get more mad at you people anyway Matthew 7 verse 21 many will say to me Lord Lord have I not prophesied in thy name cast out Devils now look what is this though what is this scenario I didn't cover it the other day it's all works it's all works didn't brother Brown say word first word word first then the works the the lesson the anointed ones at the end time is just that's what they are that works first working up stuff and listen I don't mean stuff the working out though but see the Holy Ghost has to honor his word though because it says right here many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have I not prophesied in thy name cast out Devils the devil can't cast out the devil so it has to be the Holy Spirit they're doing the work and in thy name done many wonderful works sounds like a pretty good group of people then I will possess possess it profess unto them I don't even know you I might have heard of you but you're not one of mine you Pro You Preach false Doctrine you approach the word different says depart from you you that work iniquity see notice the anointed ones only the word will separate them not the signs oh no they'll do the same signs but the words what separates them listen can we stand along can we stand long enough to hear the word or do we want the signs and then run off we've had a lot of people picked a sign up and just run off with it word first word first and um bless Julie Hart she she tried to soften me up a little bit today she said you know you want us to say Amen she said I'm just thinking about what you're saying and she didn't say then I said amen after that either you didn't say that Julie you she walked off went to the bathroom so I couldn't ask her no she's she's a known Julie since she was a kid and she's always been a good she's always been a people pleaser so I thank you so very much but um but I want you to think about I want you to chew on it but don't get choked on it so you can say Amen let's try that one time amen one more time I just want to see Julie's lips move but thank you I appreciate that and yeah and and I apologize if I was a little quick this morning but you know Dad's taught in this church for years and years and years and and man when he lays it out you gotta chew it you got you it so you can't say Amen with your mouth full all right and he throw a mouthful out there I guess I'm just trying to give you a little tidbits and then want you to get a little happy about it in between so just something you got to deal with all right they all prophesied they all done this that and the other let's move on just the same Jesus said they would do it so listen it's going to be here they are going to put signs first I say they I mean people that are not taught well or people that don't have the Holy Ghost they're going to take the anointing every time because you and I listen that's why and I don't want to sound dogmatic but you know brother Branham he was real harsh on women about not being preachers and but I mean the Bible he was just saying what the Bible said because you sisters you take the emotional every time yeah you do y'all can chew on that if you want to but you live that way so you can just go ahead and say man then your man can just be quiet for a minute we can say Amen inside but aren't ain't that true so you take the emotional side eve took the emotional side because she didn't sure didn't take the word of God that says if you eat that you'll lie she took the emotion over what she was told over what the word said the word for their day right so that's why I said it's not that we have anything against sisters they're beautiful wonderful Holy Ghost Phil sisters can help you if you'll listen to them but not to get behind the pulpit and try to lead a group of people not by emotion first okay so I just wanted to throw that in there we it's not that we just don't want women to to to teach us so women's teach us all the time we have women teachers here and we learn for like Julia I learned from that I learned it y'all just not gonna say Amen all the time because you're chewing on what I said uh-huh let's move on Revelation 16 15 says behold I come as a thief blessed is he that watches and keep us his garments now we were talking about garments being white but we are also talking about getting dressed so you've got to dress yourself okay keep his garments lest he walked naked and they see a shame it was a shame for people to walk naked and and ought to be now they don't care anymore but he's going to gather them into one place called Armageddon and listen as we were talking about the natural battle is going to happen over here to clean the Earth off it is happening to us according to the force seal when it opened for us it showed me that there was a battle of Armageddon right here before the Rapture you're going to have an Armageddon you're going to have a battle of Good and Evil a place of great Slaughter the scene of a terrible retribution upon the wicked praise God I mean you want to keep the wicked go right ahead I don't want to keep the wicked I want the wicked out so I want to have my Armageddon to where to clean the Earth off clean that sister Kathy says this Earth this earth right Kathy this Earth God's Gonna clean this Earth off listen he's not going to destroy the Earth see there's another teaching of denominations that this this world is just going to get and we're going to live up yonder somewhere on a puffy cloud that wouldn't be good I'd need a big one broccoli need a big old Cloud too but we're going to live on this Earth thank God for a prophet and it's playing in the Bible that the Earth is just going to be burnt off just like you were burnt off just like your soul was burnt off at the new birth and now God's trying to work on your spirit realm to be burnt off and then he's going to really burn your flesh when you take a body change it's going to change you and what changes more than anything fire that's why you're going to get the Holy Ghost and Fire that's going to burn all that out what's the most cleansing thing in the world right fire kills germs and everything else now the battle started in heaven it'll finish on Earth it'll actually finish in Earth in the form of Armageddon watching see it unfold we're seeing it unfold now but as we said before in Daniel 12 verse 1 there's a promise we know this is to Israel amen but since Israel is going to be over here on the other side of the bringing in the 144 thousand the bride's going to leave 144 000 is going to come in and then there's going to be a battle of Armageddon amen all right then it says at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and he's going to fight listen let God fight your battle give it to Michael give the fight that he promised right here this is toward the end it's just at the battle of Armageddon if we're in that battle of Armageddon right now right now there's going to be as brother round said one time Armageddon means a termination of forces now today there's two forces this battling in this Sanctuary right now and inside of you Good and Evil it's battling there's going to be a head up of that battle and somebody's gonna win and we know who wins so if you got the winner inside of you you're going to win but Michael's going to stand up folks let me tell you something and promise you he's going to stand up for this bride first I know he's going to stand for Israel right here I can see it but he's standing up for me and you right now because Michael is who Michael is Christ where's Christ Paul says Colossians were exactly where that fighter is Christ in you the hope of glory there shall be time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book listen real quick that was a battle in Luther's age there was a battle in Wesley's age there was a battle of forces everybody with me all right there were some physical battles like in the Dark Ages you could just say you were a Christian and they killed you sent you to the lines but those battles were not like the very last one because there was more battles afterwards okay Luther had a battle and then his battle was over he went into the other dimension and now um whatever your name is Ruth said that she had that battle now it was hers you were thinking you didn't say amen that's good see it all works together I'll try to understand y'all after a while but she said it's in me well that's where it comes it comes you just say hey it's in me the valve Armageddon the Battle of Antietam the battle that you know when they dropped the bomb and Hiroshima and Nagasaki just a few days later Japan said I had enough of this all right so what are we going to say we've had enough of this got better Tommy bomb of faith on the end of me and he's going to say I just can't even stand to touch y'all no more I just wished one day he could do that I wish I could say hey devil I'm gonna be over here but I'm gonna really be over there and he show up over there and hope a train hits him you like him okay just wanted to make sure neither do I he don't like you either you know why because if you ho if you know in your mind right now that you are Christ in you the hope of glory that you are the final battle of the Gentiles now you hear me as the Gentile battle this is the final battle he's gonna have to face in flesh in your flesh the other battle is going to be physical battle they're gonna be actually killing each other dropping atomic bombs and all that stuff but see but Satan has a he wants to be that spiritual person though but see he wants to take over you first if he can take over you he's got all the other battles that's the only battle he's looking at but he can't do it he's got a bride that he he wants to touch that soul but he can't touch it and now now look there was a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation and I'm going to declare there never was a time of trouble or a battle since the church ages began I want you to think you don't have to say Amen Hey listen if this is the final one we're standing in the final battle there were many other little battles but they never culminated into that D-Day or whatever you wanted that that dropping the bombs you know it if we if we look at the the natural part of it uh you know Roosevelt died and the war wasn't over so Harry Truman took over and he sat down with his with his um advisors his generals and he said okay how long is this thing going to last if we just fight we just fight like we are we're on two fronts now we're on Japan and this is life lesson there's one in Germany there's two fronts now one in Germany and one in Japan if Japanese don't like us they still don't they didn't like us back then but we kind of got this one under control Hitler commits suicide we go in and take over Germany Berlin and all that but you still got the Japanese he said all right he said how long will the war last and how many lives he said they said well we don't know it could be two to four more years to get them under control and it's going to be you know a hundred thousand more lives they said or we can drop this bomb and it'll be about a week if they don't submit we'll drop another one they said it'll be about two weeks it cost them about 250 000 lives and us none well Harry Truman said what drop the bomb what are you saying see that was a control you look at you look at the situation you got even in your life folks kids all of us you look and see how long this is going to last how long sin is going to carry you and take you you better get over here where this atomic bombs at get over here whether it's atomic bombs that to take over quick because listen then another 20 years left I don't believe I just don't believe there's another 20 years of this world left so let's get this war over with let's get this battle that we have been given we have been given every weapon we need to fight this battle so let's end it let's end it together let's end it with no lives lost on this side hey man is that all right is that okay we do that so brother Rams tells we've had many great battles spiritual battles he says then he talks about v-day Victory day it'll finally wind up in the battle of Armageddon that'll be the last of it when she comes to the battle Armageddon that'll sell the whole thing don't you want to come to a place where the whole thing gets settled oh some of you are not even have to think about that I want it done and over with amen now we know that we talk about the egg caterpillar people let's don't do that y'all know what metamorphosis is I was reading something yesterday about uh butterflies and it really Thrills you you know because like I said before if if you start with the the adult butterfly that lays an egg that looks nothing like the adult but inside of it it is it goes to the next stage still ugly old caterpillar still the butterflies inside there what's happened is though is the is the DNA of that butterfly is separated it's inside that worm and as that worm eats those cells start breaking and when they start breaking they come together they make a wing and another wing and a body and legs all inside of that caterpillar and you really don't see it until the very end then what happens is what is born the parent is born all over again justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost and adoption it's when your name is as good on a checkbook as the fathers during this time and then when you come to the very end stage you write the check you just hand it to whoever you need to hand it to listen to this adoption just for a few minutes and we'll close now what is adoption and we're going to talk about this just for a second because that adoption is the statue of a perfect man everybody with me all right but look it says your adoption is not your birth so brother Branham thank God for a prophet that separated it your adoption's not your birth your you can be born again and not be adopted but you can't come to adoption full Authority without being born again all right so that's why the new birth is very important all right your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing and like I said before the master builder when when your body is forming in a womb remember it comes from just a couple of cells right sperm and egg then all of a sudden they come together then all of a sudden the spine comes then all of a sudden an arm comes and it was all in there to begin with but it had to come through stages man those cells had to be placed you think how wonderful God is you know when I'm when I was being formed in the womb a long time ago that it made sure that I had a torso that had many cells wrapped around it but when it come out to the end of my hand now why didn't why didn't these cells attach to them and that be together why won't your mouth just one unit some of you maybe you wish that would be good thank you brother Louise he said yes but why did I do that because your sales knew where to migrate by God by his design that cell wouldn't attach to that finger it wrapped around and made my finger same way with us same thing with us in the body of Christ you have a place that cell had a place to go when you're born again look when you're born again the spirit of God we are sons of God what in other words you're a body you're you're being formed all right in the image of God but we were predestinated now here's what I'm trying to get to you for the sons of the last day now look last day not Luther not Wesley last day we were predestinated in other words let me not let me interplay we were predestinated to be placed to know where we were to know what our job is and stay in that job we were predestinated unto our placing for as many years were led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God all right you're born again you're a son and daughter of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry daddy daddy cry because you're a baby the spirit itself bearing witnessed with our spirit now look that we are the children of God in other words why we start acting like our parents and if children than heirs Heirs of God and join heirs with Christ look if so be that we have a Garden of Eden have no problems at all oh no it says if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together Ephesians 1 verse 4 according as he has chosen us where in him when before the foundation of the world God's going to have a bride God's going to have an adopted bride God's going to have an end time bride that lets God have so much of their life till they're going to change their whole body is going to change that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now Matthew 17 verse 5. now Jesus when he was born as a baby we read it several weeks ago you know there was a spirit like a Dove came down and and lit on Jesus and there was a voice that said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell at your new birth that's exactly what God says to you he turns to the angels and he says hey I'm pleased to dwell in that guy right there y'all watch after him he's special he's mine while he gets paid Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them now this is Matthew 17. I just told you what happened in first of Matthew now Jesus is almost walked for three and a half years almost he's getting toward the end of his life and they went up on a mountain and a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him so in other words I'm going to revert everything that you need to hear I want you to hear you're going to hear it from this guy right here that's why that that we see that I see that brother Brown when he went to the out in Arizona and the cloud came down if we would have been standing there I believe we could have heard the same thing hear ye him you got to hear this man this is my prophet and if you want to be literally that's fine with you but not toward the eating no give me this this is good I'll take this Luke 9 verse 33 says it came to pass as they departed from him Peter said unto Jesus Master now this is another view it is good for us to be here and let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one from Moses one for Elias not knowing what he said all right now watch while he just spayed that came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud now Matthew didn't say anything about them entering into a cloud it just said a cloud came down but they feared as they entered into the cloud and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son hear him and when the voice was passed Jesus was found alone and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things we stayed sane and I wrote myself a note remember brother random sat on the sixth sale on questions and answered the seals he said it's not for you there's no way you're even going to explain what's going on so Peter James and John they made they made one mention of something being on the mountain Peter did but there was no mention of this anywhere else none we wouldn't know we would have known none of this without Matthew being there and God's showing Luke this part of it so it wasn't for them the adoption part of Jesus was not for them come on because remember did they hear him even the 12 that was up there didn't know what he was saying so it wasn't for them they kept it in their heart and they pondered it around and maybe by the time they got born again they might have figured out Peter did later on he said having a more sure word of Prophecy I was on that mountain but I got a more sure word now because I got him in my heart he's not standing there looking at me he's in my heart Ephesians 4 11 says he gave he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers why for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ which is behind me here that we henceforth be no more children now listen the Bible compels us not to stay kids do not say sure do not stay children it's okay to be a child it's okay to drink milk it's okay to want the things of of a child but you got to move out of that that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro now this is what's going to happen if you stay a child you're going to be tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine what we were talking about brother Louise for people that you see people they just like like a ping pong machine or a weight calling thing pinball machine and then somebody hits them real good with that flipper and they're gone you'll get what I'm saying in a minute toss to and fro and carried away with every wind of Doctrine look by the slight of men preachers sorry to say and cunning craftiness whereby they lie awake to the seed they are going to be there do not kid yourself today in our little town of Gillsville that was a thief lying in wait and he broke in the Dollar General they're everywhere they said all they stole was candy so look for a kid or an adult with suckers I don't know but but what am I saying they're going to be there they're going to be here someone told me a long time ago somebody got scammed well somebody actually in our in our little town got scammed a couple last week out of a hundred dollars and they wouldn't give her money back venmo or somebody it was but there's people on this Earth that literally get up like me and you we get up we set our alarm clock my alarm clock not tomorrow but Tuesday will go off at 6 30. I'll get up I'll read a little bit I'll study a little bit I'll drink some coffee and drink some more coffee and drink some more coffee and go get dressed and and go to work and I go to my cubicle and I put my mail in and that's my job right there are people in this world that get up to do the same thing but to deceive you out of your money they treat it just like a job because folks they good at it I ain't gonna ask how many people been scammed in this building but somebody probably has or even tried I know they've tried I just do like Josh I go huh you want to talk to my mama the best way to do it don't talk to my mama nothing against Jim but speaking the truth and love look the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ the Bible talks about edifying the act of one who promotes another's growth in Christian wisdom party happiness and Holiness I hope that we in this church and we as Believers and as as we converse with each other that we we do promote another's growth in Christian wisdom piety happiness and Holiness all right one more before we close and then we'll take communion brother Brown tells us for in the Bible it said there was set Apostles Prophet evangelist teachers pastors all these for the Perfection of the church God set them in the church now there's nine spiritual gifts and they separates the two there's nine spiritual gifts what brother Bob was talking about this morning that we can lay on hands and so forth but remember that really is exclusive that is a power that's given but not everybody gets it everybody don't have the gift of Prophecy everybody know how the gift of Divine Healing and by with me all right it's severally given as the Bible says so God set them into church now there's nine spiritual gifts that will lay on hands so forth pray earnestly for the best gift so forth but these others see God predestinated this five-fold ministry to get a bride ready and you can say whatever you want to sitting at home ain't gonna do it God sets them in the church here you him 1958 brother Brown said he's he has said in the church gifts first apostles are missionaries Apostle Apostle means one cent missionary means one cent Apostle prophets teachers evangelists pastors they're all predestinated gifts of God gifts and callings are without repentance they're placed in the church to bring the church together hold it together for the glory of God hahaha let's read this right and then we'll close let's get ready take communion right after this second Peter 1 verse two now this is what we were reading way back a long time ago this is the uh what brother Brown reads for the Statue of a perfect man but let's read it in three parts we're not going to get to the Chart but we'll get to it later on Grace and peace be multiplied and this is Peter unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according has his divine power hath given unto us now Satan doesn't have a divine power right there's only one Divine amen and there's only one divine power and that's the Holy Ghost all right that's Jesus Christ all right so that just kind of narrows it down to one person right according as his divine power hath given unto us so whatever it is he giveth us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to go in virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding grain precious promises now look it gave us the promises it didn't say we were going to automatically get them come on somebody they're there they're there to get yes but you gotta want them you got to get them make yourself ready whereby are giving unto us exceeding grain pressures promises that by these brother Brown said these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature now not your nature not your daddy's nature down here neighbors nature but divine nature that's got to be the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's got to be you've got to be born again before you begin any of this process of going up the statue of perfect man because look having escaped the corruption that is in this world through lust all right there's a break verse five and besides this in other words besides this new birth that we've been talking about giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness love or charity okay there's your there's your model all right we're gonna take another break verse 8 though says 4. if these things be in you and abound overflow that's what I was saying this morning I love what the Bible says they make you I like to read it like that they make you in other words you get these virtues you can't help but be a Powerhouse of God they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ in other words you'll know more about God than that first part sorry you will but look but he that lacking lack at these things is blind now remember don't take the Christianity away don't take the new birth away you can't throw them out of the Kingdom once you get that DNA of God you're stuck but you can lack these things and be blind and cannot see it far off in other words your Revelation is not going to be much further than your nose at the end of your face and cannot see it far off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence Here We Go Again Peter was a diligent he was a fisherman he fished he fished he throwed a net out remember he told Jesus he said I throw this net out all night pretty diligent he said I've not caught one thing Jesus said how about throwing it on another side of the boat you remember what happened right they couldn't pull the fish in well they weren't all just laying over here because Peter was over here Jesus was making a point he created him fish wherefore the rather brother and give diligence to make your calling not your pastor not your brother not your sister not your neighbor your calling find out who you are and what you're doing here calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall what a promise if you do these things this formula brother Brown said this prescription you shall never fall pursue an entrance shall be ministered unto you you know what God's Gonna pour out the windows of Heaven if you'll just make yourself available for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly look at all these adjectives that that this sorry this dumb fisherman that couldn't even sign his name where's he getting these big words brother Kylie he was a dumb fisherman that's what brother Brown said ignorant Bible said ignorant even the Bible called him ignorant ignorant none learned I can't say some of these words couldn't spell them anyway but the Holy Ghost is telling us through Peter what to do it's not just a dumb fisherman talking to us it's God Almighty in human flesh for showing entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly and to the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent this this church this ministry is not negligent amen that you could have saved so they could have said amen a little bit quicker I'm gonna say it one more time wherefore Legend reach it to you for 50 years 60 years I'm gonna preach you the same identical thing over and over again until you get it wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present day message of the hour less than our feet Ephesians 4 verse 14 says we that we henceforth be no more children Tosh to to and fro with every wind of Doctrine like we was talking about a ping pong Machine by the slot of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ who's doing the it's up here it's up here in the office anybody have a need before we take communion I know we we um sometimes we hurry into the communion but but we also that's why we do in the communion we always tarry just for a minute or so so you can clear your mind ask God to forgive you if you have a sickness you know we sometimes we don't read that part of the Bible the Bible tells us remember the Bible tells us that if we pray if we ask forgiveness if God forgives us we ask him for healing and he gives us forgiveness right and know what the Bible says so you come praying to be healed he said your sins will even be forgiven and you're not praying for that you're sick as a dog but somehow he clears your slate I'm just reading the Bible so that's what we need to do every once in a while when we get healed you just say oh thank God my Slate's clean you get a headache or something somebody pray for you and you get healed or or you have a something going on in your life and you have prayer and that thing goes away or brother John say not just thank God for my healing thank you God that all my sins have been forgiven amen what sins you talking about right anybody have a need before we take communion let me get over here to the communion scriptures give me a moment oh they got it up here so let's just let's just read it off the screen all right First Corinthians 11 verse 23 uh if you'll go ahead and start it we'll read it we got uh thank you Adams back there running the show today Adam and Levi for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this dude in remembrance of me remember the remember the lord it's not just something that you know Lisa made the bread and we made the wine and we're gonna this is something you know it's kind of a catch-up day no you think about the Lord what he did for you like I said before you want to get healed all right then you want to get your sins forgiven let's remember the Lord after the same manner he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood let's do you as often as you drinking in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily Jesus is making a point shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord now what is the body and blood of the lord it's the Saints it's the body but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup before I he that eateth and drinketh unworldly Edith and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves as what brother the Bible was talking about this morning we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world praise God see that's that separation from family all right we get into this family where there's no condemnation and then we or we stand the ones where there is all right wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come out together in the condemnation the rest I'm going to say in order when I come visit you all right so let's take just a moment of Silent prayer pray for our ministry here pray for them people here and then ask the Lord to be with us dear Lord we're a needy group of people father and I pray that you just meet our needs today let the sick be healed let the loss be saved and Lord may we continue on with you Lord in this growth development that we've we've started in Lord I pray this should help us now help us to grow in you Lord that we not be babes that we'll move on with you Lord and and be adult Christians Lord for we can the Bible says ask what we will and you'll give it to us Lord thank you for the time we have Lord thank you for the opportunity to to stand in front of a group of people Lord that loves you Lord I pray that you just bless us now in the furthermore of this part of the service in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Bible said he bless the bread Lord thank you for this bread we know that many times Lord we we go back to to what happened years and years ago Lord how they used to keep the bread and put it back in the freezer and oh it was just it was horrible and then you look at Moses when they would hold over the bread that Lord you were so you were so adamant about doing what you said that you would make it just be have wiggle tails and and maggots all in it well Lord this Bread is made with holy hands this Bread is made that's going to be destroyed what's left of it tonight Lord and be burnt to where nothing else will be held over nobody will be able to eat it again Lord because we want fresh revelation we want fresh Manna From Heaven every day Lord we ask you to bless this bread Lord in Jesus name amen yeah man could you imagine you know you you beat children of Israel and I'm sure these like all of us we have Rebels remember that guy snuck out of his tent on Sabbath that time and started picking up sticks now you think what the harm is to pick up sticks I'm cold I need a fire well guess what what happened God struck him dead because you're not supposed to work do anything on the Sabbath day and he was just picking up sticks but he disobeyed the word of God that's how serious God is because remember God's a good God but he also hates false Doctrine he also hates us not doing what his word says but with a loving hand he loves us there's no way you know we we think about what happened in in the upper room I mean he had 12 people with him that was it him and 12. and what I'm was going to betray him he's still handed the cup to Judas the bread to Judas and wash judas's feet knowing in a few hours what he was going to do that's brotherly kindness dear heavenly father thank you for this wine Lord has been prepared months and months maybe even years ago but lord it's like your word it just keeps getting stronger and stronger and better and better father I pray that you should sanctify it and the partakers in Jesus name amen Come Morning how warm by the river how rationy ever green tree I will carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I'll walk by the river how ration is he ever green tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight Darkest Hour come morning there's Glory for me you know Jesus was standing there and there is a song and I want to try to find it that that they actually sang when they went out of the the upper room into the garden and we've sang it before and I'm gonna try to find it we'll sing it again but that's what tradition says are are Israel the the Jews say that this song was sung as they come out of the garden brother dick used to sing it but we'll find it but but there was Jesus he knew who was going to betray him he knew that the devil was gonna was gonna act through Judas and and he may not have known exactly the whole thing may not have you know may not have seen everything but he knew he was coming to his death and he said you do this till I come you do this right here this is an ordinance that I want you to do and and it's like brother Dallas um many times we you know you every church is Sovereign you can take communion whenever you want to but they're there's certain churches that I've been to they said well we we take communion when we feel like everybody's ready well I said Well we'd never take communion if we felt every person was ready at the same time but we're going to have it the first Saturday if we can of every month and that way checking up time Sunday sorry first Sunday thing about Sabbath sorry about that well they were it yeah I knew what I was saying y'all knew what I was saying okay all right now now they're all confused but um We're Gonna Take It the first Sunday of every month because that makes us get ready the bride hath made herself ready we're going to make ourselves get ready start praying the day before because we're going to take communion and we're gonna have foot washing amen you love the Lord let's partake if you'll pull up the foot washing scripture we'll read it while they're supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas this character Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and then he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel girded himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel over with he was girded in cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said Lord do you wash my feet Jesus said what I do thou knowest not now Peter but Thou shalt know hereafter yeah Peter said Thou shalt never wash my feet don't ever tell Jesus never okay because he's fixing to dump something on Peter right here Jesus said if I wash thee not you ain't got no part with me the man I know sometimes we may have issues with our feet and stuff but if you just take communion and walk out the door and don't wash feet I'm just reading you what he said if the god of Heaven can wash feet you can swallow your pride and wash it too amen all of us if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said Lord dump it on me not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said he that is Washington either is not saved to wash his feet but it's clean every wet and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken this garment was set down again he said unto them know you what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example now if God gives you an example all right pretty good example I would say it's probably a perfect example for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither had his sin he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things everybody say that with me happy are ye if you do them let's bow our heads Lord be with us in the furthermore this service as the sisters go downstairs Lord may we show reverence Lord to you father in washing the
