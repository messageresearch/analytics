[2:25] the kingdom of God and and I used the

[2:44] were so enthused about after that's that
[2:45] service that they said but Louise could
[2:48] we have those notes could you give us
[2:49] that PowerPoint presentation could you
[2:51] get several people asked me for the for

[3:08] straight I'm free and came to the
[3:10] message not too long ago but he said but
[3:12] Louisa I'm getting to a point now where
[3:14] I feel like I need I need more teaching

[3:20] he said and he said so he said this is
[3:22] this is fresher breath a breath of fresh
[3:25] air to me so so God knows what he's
[3:28] doing and so we just thank God for for
[3:32] that a man who I appreciate all of your
[3:34] prayers and thank God for using brother
[3:36] Wade as well cuz he's kind of shared
[3:38] some of the same same things with me
[3:40] when he was while he was gone this past
[3:42] weekend they met
[3:43] praise the Lord Jesus you love the Lord
[3:45] hey man so let's just go to the word
[3:48] Amen we're just gonna read this one
[3:49] verse and then I'll have you be seated
[3:51] in Zechariah chapter 4 verse 7 very
[3:55] familiar scripture to us in Zechariah
[3:58] chapter 4 verse 7 amen who art thou o
[4:04] great mountain before zerubabbel thou
[4:07] shalt become a plane and he shall bring
[4:10] forth the headstone thereof with
[4:13] shoutings crying not just grace right
[4:17] elbow grace like jesus said verily
[4:21] verily I say unto you a man grace grace
[4:24] unto it amen I find that very
[4:28] interesting regarding the of what we're
[4:30] gonna talk about I want to be speaking
[4:32] about the eleventh hour of grace amen in
[4:35] this hour amen praise the Lord so let's
[4:37] just go to the Lord in prayer our
[4:38] Heavenly Father as we come before you
[4:40] Lord Jesus we thank you Father for your
[4:42] word thank you that we have the
[4:44] privilege to even open back the pages of
[4:47] your word but Lord God we know Heavenly
[4:49] Father that we're part of you Lord so
[4:51] father God this is this is this is part
[4:53] of us Lord where you said Lord if my
[4:56] word abides in you and you abide in me
[4:58] Lord God and that's what we will father
[4:59] so Lord God we ask that you now Lord
[5:02] take full control Lord of the service
[5:04] Lord you take full control of my lips
[5:06] Lord that I may just say something Lord
[5:09] to help somebody Lord maybe they may not
[5:11] grab get everything but Lord God I
[5:14] believe that you can reveal it unto them
[5:16] Lord
[5:16] in due time even at this moment you can
[5:19] do so father well because I can't give
[5:21] no one of Revelation but you can Lord
[5:23] Jesus so I pray now that you would just
[5:25] bless your people meet every need
[5:26] amongst us and father God even those
[5:29] that are out Lord bless them Lord where
[5:31] they're at this moment
[5:32] sick ones Lord God be with them Lord we
[5:35] pray we commit this time into your hands
[5:37] now and ask you these things in the name
[5:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[5:41] praise the Lord st. you may be seated
[5:45] amen amen we want to we've all heard
[5:51] about the eleventh hour and the 11th
[5:55] hour workers and we're gonna get to that
[5:57] to that scripture here in just a moment
[5:58] that parable where Jesus was talking
[6:00] about there was it was it was actually
[6:03] the parable of the laborers in the
[6:05] vineyard amen and so and it's very
[6:09] interesting you know for because we only
[6:11] really grasped one verse of that parable
[6:14] and that's the 11th hour worker right
[6:16] which we are at which we are we are
[6:19] those 11 while our workers there's many
[6:21] types in there one of them being that we
[6:24] are those 11th hour workers in this hour
[6:26] amen we are we should be working to
[6:30] build up the kingdom of God in this hour
[6:33] eman and so there's so much to do and so
[6:37] much and so little time
[6:38] amen now how many feel that way amen but
[6:42] you know what Saints God has made us
[6:44] laborers in his vineyard and he's
[6:47] invited us Amen to go work in his
[6:49] vineyard and not to stay idle not to be
[6:52] idle in this hour amen because Saints
[6:54] there so is so much to do in this hour
[6:56] so but before we get there I wanted to
[6:59] show you guys something to just kind of
[7:00] perk up your interest and so the
[7:03] brothers in the back and they could they
[7:05] could bring up well I'll just I'll have
[7:10] them they got a few pictures that I want
[7:12] I wanted to show but very interesting
[7:14] regarding the number 11 and I'm just
[7:16] gonna read this right here for you says
[7:17] in numerology the number 11 is
[7:20] considered the master number the reason
[7:23] is this number carries a vibrational
[7:26] frequency of balanced number eleven
[7:29] signifies invention refinement
[7:32] fulfillment vision and congruence in a
[7:35] person amens are you reading right there
[7:38] and you can read the astrology astrology
[7:40] part of it as well but the number eleven
[7:43] has
[7:44] has very interesting meanings one of the
[7:47] meanings is that there there are there
[7:52] are eleven a hundred eleven days from
[7:54] the time that it's September 11th to
[7:56] December 31st if you didn't know that
[7:59] all right very interesting because then
[8:01] you got you got the end of the year
[8:03] right and when we are at the end time
[8:07] right it took it took going back to to
[8:10] 9/11 which we're about to come to an
[8:13] anniversary here but it took 11 years to
[8:17] build the World Trade Center 1966 when
[8:21] it was started it started to be built
[8:23] and to 1977 when it was completed as you
[8:27] can see there it took 11 years to build
[8:29] a World Trade Center the sunspot cycle
[8:32] or the solar cycle lasts for 11 years as
[8:36] some of you may already know this but
[8:38] but if you don't know well that's
[8:40] another wrinkle in your brain September
[8:44] 11th is the 250 fourth day of the of the
[8:48] year and so if you if you take those
[8:52] numbers 2 plus 5 plus 4 equals 11 the
[8:58] world trade center trade center
[9:01] resembled the number 11 as you see there
[9:03] New York where the world trade center
[9:05] resided is the 11th state in the
[9:08] Constitution for those of you who like
[9:12] sports in many popular sports around the
[9:15] world such as American football cricket
[9:17] field hockey and soccer there are 11
[9:19] players in each team the flag of Canada
[9:24] my wife might like this the flag of
[9:26] Canada features a maple leaf having 11
[9:30] points that's very interesting now for
[9:34] those of you who might know what these
[9:36] movies are the most Oscar Awards for any
[9:41] movie is 11 the feat was achieved by Ben
[9:45] Hur in 1959 great movie by the way
[9:48] Titanic in 1997 and and and I thought it
[9:53] was interesting that it the Lord of the
[9:55] Rings The Return of the King in 2000
[9:58] kind of interesting that that the return
[10:01] of the king then we all know this one
[10:04] because brother branham mentioned their
[10:05] World War 1 ended on the 11th day of the
[10:07] 11th month in the 11th hour I don't
[10:11] think that's coincidence amen
[10:14] and of course world war 2 is usually
[10:16] displayed as world war 2 but that's one
[10:19] plus one which is 11 C so there are many
[10:23] other things you know I just wanted to
[10:25] add a couple of wrinkles there to your
[10:28] brain just kind of perk your interest
[10:30] but there's a lot of significance in the
[10:32] number 11 right so it's very interesting
[10:34] that God amen when Jesus was talking
[10:37] about this parable that we're about to
[10:38] read here in Matthew chapter 20 he talks
[10:41] about the 11th hour workers all right
[10:44] amen so so if we if we read it we read
[10:49] here when before if you actually before
[10:51] you start reading Matthew chapter 20 if
[10:55] you start reading Matthew chapter 20 you
[10:57] have to get the context of what Jesus
[11:00] was given that parable and you really
[11:02] can't get the context that context of
[11:04] why Jesus was was talking about that
[11:07] parable about the laborers working in
[11:09] the vineyard unless you read Matthew
[11:11] chapter 19 in the last three to four
[11:14] verses and in those last three or four
[11:17] verses in the other believe it's in
[11:18] Matthew 19:27 Peter tells Jesus and he
[11:22] tells him this he said master we've left
[11:25] everything we've given up everything to
[11:27] follow you what are we going to receive
[11:31] as they're interesting he asked that
[11:33] question because to me that's kind of
[11:36] like that attitude that we some of us
[11:38] take that you think that you're gonna
[11:41] get closer to God by how many brownie
[11:43] points you have or how or what you've
[11:46] done Amen or what you can do or but you
[11:49] know what says God is not interested
[11:51] about what you can do or what you have
[11:53] done or what you were even doing now
[11:56] amen because this whole thing is about
[11:59] the mercy and the grace of God amen you
[12:02] were never seeking God amen
[12:04] it was always grace seeking you
[12:07] amen because I you know st. I just
[12:12] thought some of you who were out and
[12:14] lived in the world and things like that
[12:15] I mean I'm sure you when I was partying
[12:19] I wasn't thinking about God I was
[12:22] thinking about satisfying the flesh amen
[12:26] and doing and doing the things of the
[12:27] world so it wasn't you were never
[12:29] seeking God it was always Christ seeking
[12:31] you amen
[12:32] but sometimes we think Amen that there's
[12:35] something that we can do to get closer
[12:37] to God and we get this maybe this
[12:39] Catholic mentality that there's some
[12:42] maybe if I could stay 15 extra minutes
[12:45] on my knees maybe I maybe pray as I'm as
[12:49] I'm walking around on my knees yeah man
[12:51] the whole the whole house and then
[12:53] praying like this and the whole place
[12:55] maybe I can get some merit from God but
[12:58] you know what Saints there's nothing
[12:59] that you can do to merit the grace amen
[13:02] in Salvation and in the Holy Spirit amen
[13:05] the only thing he asks of you a menace
[13:07] to believe his word amen praise the Lord
[13:10] so Matt so so Peter took this attitude
[13:14] that there's something that they did
[13:15] because we left our family we left
[13:18] everything to follow you what do you
[13:21] have what do you have in store for us
[13:22] Jesus what do you have in store for us
[13:25] amen and of course Jesus he replies to
[13:28] them there in the next few verses and he
[13:30] tells them verily of course yeah if you
[13:33] give up the world and if you give up
[13:36] your family your parents your your your
[13:40] brothers and your sisters for my sake to
[13:43] follow me yeah you're gonna be rewarded
[13:46] he tells him he tells him that you shall
[13:50] receive an hundredfold and shall inherit
[13:54] everlasting life or eternal life of
[13:57] course but but what he's but it is not
[14:02] because of the fact that they gave up
[14:05] those things amen you see that they're
[14:09] gonna inherit eternal life and then
[14:12] that's when he goes and then and in the
[14:14] next chapter before he says for many in
[14:17] verse 30 there Matthew 19:13 but many
[14:19] that are first shall be last and
[14:21] shall be first then he goes on in
[14:23] chapter 20 and starts talking about this
[14:27] parable and so what we're gonna do is we
[14:29] want to take just try to go out a little
[14:32] verse by verse and we'll just see how
[14:33] the Lord leads amen
[14:35] I have so much content here so I I would
[14:38] appreciate it if you try to just pay
[14:40] attention amen
[14:41] I know it's Wednesday night but I
[14:43] believe God has something in store for
[14:44] us say man you just try to pay attention
[14:46] try not to fall asleep and if you fall
[14:48] asleep and then shake yourself amen in
[14:53] Matthew 20 verse 1 it says for the
[14:56] kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
[14:58] that is in householder which went out
[15:01] early in the morning to hire labourers
[15:03] into his vineyard amen I want you to
[15:06] notice that in that verse that the that
[15:10] its distinction is made between the
[15:14] kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of
[15:16] Earth amen
[15:17] this parable that Jesus is about to talk
[15:20] about is is is gonna is going to talk
[15:22] about is the Kingdom of Heaven or the
[15:25] kingdom of God or the kingdom as the
[15:28] scripture calls it at times they had
[15:30] this has nothing to do with the kingdom
[15:32] of the world of this earth is this all
[15:34] about the kingdom of heaven amen praise
[15:38] God and and one of the characteristics
[15:42] of this kingdom of heaven is that the
[15:44] higher the the householder here the
[15:47] owner of the vineyard went out looking
[15:51] for servants to hire you see so that's
[15:58] the reason why the servants were not
[16:01] looking for him it's Christ seeking the
[16:04] servants amen it was Christ seeking you
[16:07] amen it's not you seeking God
[16:09] you see praise the Lord in John 4:23 it
[16:14] says Jesus said but the hour cometh and
[16:17] now is when the true worshipers shall
[16:19] worship the father in spirit and in
[16:22] truth
[16:22] in truth for the father seeketh such to
[16:25] worship Him amen Christ is always
[16:29] seeking a man because Saints let me tell
[16:31] you what in John 3:16 he says
[16:34] for for God so loved the world that He
[16:36] gave His only begotten Son that
[16:37] whosoever should believeth in him should
[16:40] not perish but have everlasting life
[16:42] eternal life amen
[16:43] God's given the whole world the
[16:46] opportunity but God also knows and he
[16:49] may says it in another scripture that
[16:50] Christ died for many so really it's not
[16:54] everybody that's going to accept him but
[16:57] God offers and brings and gives the
[16:59] offering to everybody come and receive
[17:02] amen that's the reason Saints why we
[17:06] should we should not we should be
[17:08] careful about looking down on people you
[17:14] don't have a right to look down on
[17:15] somebody just because they're wearing
[17:17] earrings or because they don't look just
[17:18] like you you don't know that person
[17:22] three four or five ten years down the
[17:25] road will probably be whole lot better
[17:27] off than probably what you are at that
[17:29] moment thinking it that way do you just
[17:33] don't know in Saints we have to think
[17:36] think think that the grace of God is is
[17:39] is is more than what you think it is we
[17:44] think that the grace of God and just
[17:46] encapsulates God's the way God dealt
[17:50] with us but that the way he dealt with
[17:53] us he can't deal with the drunker of the
[17:56] rock star out there he can't deal with
[17:58] the with the with the man that's heavy
[18:00] on drugs with the pablo escobar's out
[18:03] there he can't deal with none of them
[18:05] but I'm here to tell you Saints that he
[18:07] can and that he has and that he's still
[18:11] amen saving amen in this hour so there's
[18:14] no case that is lost amen he can't lose
[18:18] no one that's his amen praise God we
[18:21] know that there's some there are part of
[18:23] the bride and some that are part of the
[18:25] church amen but still it's all God's
[18:28] grace
[18:30] it's not anybody it's not Satan's grace
[18:33] hey man
[18:34] praise the Lord amen now in John 6:44
[18:41] the Bible says no man can come to me
[18:43] except the Father which hath sent me
[18:45] draw him so you can't come to Christ
[18:49] unless he draws you unless he's pulling
[18:52] you amen unless unless he's pulling amen
[18:56] you amen closer to and how does he pull
[18:59] you through his word amen he pulls you
[19:04] through his word amen you have to hear
[19:05] the word first in order for you to grow
[19:07] closer to Christ amen you just think
[19:10] come one day the trake up one day so I'm
[19:12] just going to go to church and they're
[19:14] at church I'm gonna get saved now it
[19:18] didn't happen that way right amen maybe
[19:21] it has before but but but you know what
[19:23] for the majority of us it probably never
[19:25] happen that way amen
[19:27] you for some ways huh somebody needed to
[19:30] talk to you somebody needed to say
[19:32] something you needed to pick up a tract
[19:34] you needed to pick up read a turn open
[19:37] the Bible there in that hotel room where
[19:38] you were doing whatever in that hotel
[19:40] room you picked you opened up the Bible
[19:42] and you saw that in John 3:16 where he
[19:45] said for God so loved the world God so
[19:47] loved me that He gave His only begotten
[19:50] Son a man the word had to draw you at
[19:53] some point in time Amen praise the Lord
[19:56] Jesus I'm just gonna bring this over
[19:57] here so I don't have to go back amen
[20:00] now and in John 6 65 he says and he said
[20:04] therefore said I unto you that no man
[20:06] can come unto me except if it were given
[20:08] unto Him of my father amen praise God so
[20:12] you don't have permission to go into the
[20:14] Lord's vineyard a men without first him
[20:17] calling you right now you really
[20:20] wouldn't want to you really don't want
[20:22] to because you're not seeking to go into
[20:24] the vineyard how many understand what
[20:25] I'm saying man you're not looking for
[20:28] God he's always looking for you amen
[20:30] praise God now these men that that that
[20:34] the labor that the owner of the vineyard
[20:37] was hiring they wanted to work I mean
[20:41] they they
[20:42] they were they were waiting but they
[20:44] didn't they didn't know who it was that
[20:46] they were gonna go to amen they wanted
[20:48] to be hard and we know that this
[20:52] householders Jesus amen praise the Lord
[20:54] now in verse 2 it says and when he had
[20:56] agreed with the labourers for a penny a
[20:59] day he sent them into his vineyard amen
[21:03] now you notice how the the the owner of
[21:06] the vineyard he had to make an agreement
[21:09] with them for this penny a day whatever
[21:14] how much that was worth back then after
[21:16] a penny a day here and I mean this is of
[21:19] my goodness yeah you're below the
[21:21] poverty line for a penny a day so we
[21:25] know it's not talking about one cent a
[21:27] penny that like but it's another type of
[21:30] money amen
[21:31] that they had back then we know that
[21:34] these laborers they represent Christians
[21:37] we are Christians amen and the lord of
[21:41] the vineyard he had to bargain with them
[21:43] in order to get them to work amen I'll
[21:46] give you a penny if you come and in
[21:49] labor with me here in this vineyard so
[21:52] they agreed and they went to go work for
[21:54] him right amen
[21:56] now this penny Saints to me it
[21:58] represents the token the Holy Ghost
[22:02] eternal life amen that's what it
[22:05] represents amen praise the Lord which is
[22:08] directly what Jesus said in Matthew
[22:10] nineteen twenty nine which we were just
[22:12] read they said they said that and
[22:15] everyone that had forsaken houses or
[22:17] brethren or sisters or father or mother
[22:19] or wife or children or lands for my
[22:21] name's sake shall receive an hundredfold
[22:23] and shall inherit everlasting life
[22:26] so these laborers amen they they gave up
[22:30] what they were doing for that day to go
[22:32] work for the father or go work for this
[22:34] for this man right which represents the
[22:36] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[22:38] praise the Lord Jesus now in order for
[22:41] you to be a candidate of any of God's
[22:44] benefits you must agree with the Word of
[22:46] God first
[22:48] amen you have to agree with the word
[22:51] amen in order for you you have to
[22:55] believe you have to agree that that Holy
[22:57] Ghost is for me in order for you to get
[22:59] the Holy Ghost
[22:59] you have to agree and believe that the
[23:02] healing is for you in order for you to
[23:04] get healing right you have to believe a
[23:07] man that the promises of God are for you
[23:09] and that their yay and amen if you want
[23:11] to receive any of its benefits so that's
[23:14] the same thing these labors they had to
[23:16] agree with the with the owner of the
[23:18] vineyard in order to get to work in the
[23:20] vineyard we agree with you so we got
[23:23] that's one reason what we're gonna work
[23:25] for you amen amen
[23:27] praise the Lord Jesus as a reason saying
[23:30] is why many many they want Christ and
[23:33] they want Christ as their Savior but as
[23:37] you've heard a lot many times before but
[23:39] they don't want him as their Lord
[23:41] everybody wants Christ to save them Oh
[23:44] cry oh Jesus saved my soul saved me and
[23:48] he'll save you but then when it comes
[23:51] time to giving up things in life giving
[23:54] up your pride giving up your filthy
[23:57] mouth giving up cigarettes giving up
[23:59] video games so that you can spend more
[24:02] time with God that was one of the things
[24:07] I had to give up video games because why
[24:13] I saw that these things was not drawing
[24:17] me closer to God
[24:19] so that was I gave up these things I
[24:22] don't you know pick them back up a few
[24:25] years later but you know but I mean you
[24:30] know again there's nothing wrong with
[24:32] the video game nothing wrong with those
[24:34] things only if you let those things take
[24:36] over your life take over your marriage
[24:39] take over your your spending time with
[24:42] your family bringing them to church
[24:45] that's when it's wrong that's that's
[24:48] when it's that's when it's become a
[24:49] problem amen
[24:51] then you can be put you put you put your
[24:54] input that you fill in the blank
[24:56] video games whatever it is for you a man
[24:59] praise God because my battle is in your
[25:02] battle and your battle isn't my battery
[25:03] man we all have we all struggle with
[25:05] different things they men but amen
[25:08] greater is he that is in you than he
[25:10] that is in the world amen
[25:11] praise the Lord Jesus amen so hmm so
[25:17] these these are these men now it says
[25:20] here then the last part of that verse he
[25:21] sent them unto his vineyard amen
[25:24] so now that they agreed with that with
[25:27] the with the master of the vineyard they
[25:29] he went ahead and sent them to the
[25:31] vineyard you see there it reminded me of
[25:34] that scripture in the Bible where Jesus
[25:36] tells Peter and he says in Luke 22 verse
[25:40] 31 it says and the Lord said Simon Simon
[25:43] behold Satan hath desired to have you
[25:46] that he may sift you as wheat but I have
[25:49] prayed for you man isn't that awesome
[25:53] that Jesus would pray for us you know
[25:54] this week this week where it was last
[25:56] week we had a devotional with her with
[25:58] the girls and I told him who started the
[26:00] devotion I said hey do you know that
[26:02] Jesus Christ prayed for you you want to
[26:06] read the prayer that he made for you you
[26:09] know and they didn't probably had never
[26:10] thought of it that way but Christ
[26:13] there's a scripture in the Bible there's
[26:14] a whole chapter dedicated to Christ's
[26:16] prayer for you right in John chapter 16
[26:19] or 17 amen yes and so and so here Jesus
[26:26] prayed for told Peter hey I'm praying
[26:28] for you Peter
[26:29] amen wouldn't you just love to have that
[26:31] amen
[26:33] and he already did though that's the
[26:35] thing he's already prayed for you just
[26:37] read John 17 and you'll see and all you
[26:40] got to do is just put your name wherever
[26:42] he wherever he says thee or wherever he
[26:45] says them just put your name in there
[26:48] and that's the prayer he prayed for you
[26:51] if we had time we'd read the whole
[26:53] chapter man cuz that's a good chapter
[26:55] but he says I have prayed for thee that
[26:58] thy faith fail not and when thou art
[27:01] converted then strengthen thy brethren a
[27:05] man when you have been convinced when
[27:08] these laborers work
[27:10] Vince that the mass this master is right
[27:12] there gonna get I'm gonna get a penny
[27:14] eternal life so that I could I could go
[27:16] work amen I'll be working in this
[27:18] vineyard amen
[27:19] then I can go ahead and strengthen my
[27:22] brethren amen
[27:23] it's when the whole when you receive
[27:25] Christ amen the Holy Ghost will put you
[27:27] in action they meant that eternal life
[27:30] will put you in action to go do
[27:32] something amen
[27:33] not to stand idle not not not not not to
[27:36] say well well I said before we're just
[27:39] gonna sit back in and what wait for the
[27:41] train to come by no these Labor's were
[27:44] put to work these Labor's had something
[27:46] to do a men that's the reason why they
[27:48] got eternal life amen to go work amen
[27:52] God is expecting for us to do something
[27:55] in this hour a man not just to sit
[27:58] around and wait Amen there's something
[28:00] that you and I must fulfill you and I
[28:02] need to find out what is it Lord that I
[28:04] need to do in this hour Lord what is it
[28:08] that that maybe you're just to be a good
[28:11] farmer or you know or maybe you're just
[28:13] a good that's fine but Lord even with my
[28:16] farming tools or with my farming trade
[28:18] what is it that I can use this event for
[28:21] your glory and for your honor maybe as
[28:23] I'm working with somebody in the field I
[28:25] can bring somebody to Christ I don't
[28:27] know but since we were put here to serve
[28:31] Him and to serve others amen
[28:34] not just to serve our pockets not just
[28:38] to fill our pockets in our in our and
[28:40] our bank accounts amen because all
[28:42] that's going to perish
[28:43] oh that's going to go away as it's been
[28:48] said before you have never seen a you
[28:52] know that cart a hearse is it a hearse
[28:55] pulling a u-haul truck I've never seen
[29:00] that out in the streets I've only seen
[29:05] the hearse and then a couple of several
[29:06] cars when sometimes it's be like 30
[29:08] minutes worth of cars that you're
[29:10] waiting because of family members you
[29:12] know but there's no money no money I
[29:19] don't I never seen it no belongings you
[29:22] know the Egyptians back then they
[29:23] thought they
[29:23] could be bared with their belongings and
[29:25] their money and they're just as much
[29:28] dust as anybody else has died the dust
[29:32] never went over there and grabbed a
[29:33] couple of cents you know to do what I
[29:37] know that sounds silly but but sometimes
[29:41] we think silly now and that's why God
[29:45] said amen let this mind of Christ being
[29:47] you right when the mind of Christ is in
[29:49] you then your your priorities are gonna
[29:51] be different your mindset is going to
[29:53] change regarding the way you live life
[29:55] and the way you think about others and
[29:57] the way you even treat others now your
[30:01] your your your your priority is what can
[30:04] I do for you Lord how can how can I be
[30:07] of service to my people too but to the
[30:09] Brethren to the people out here so that
[30:11] you can give me glorified Lord Jesus
[30:13] amen
[30:14] praise the Lord because you can only
[30:17] truly serve Christ when you've really
[30:20] gotten an experience with Christ and
[30:23] I've just read in just a few of these
[30:24] verses in Romans 8:28 and we know that
[30:26] all things work together for good to
[30:28] them that love God to them that are
[30:30] called according to his purpose they man
[30:33] see these laborers were called and there
[30:37] and and and because they were called
[30:39] they went to work so you have to be
[30:40] called amen
[30:41] first corinthians 1:9 says God is
[30:43] faithful by whom you were called unto
[30:46] the Fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ
[30:47] our Lord I appreciate the brothers
[30:50] pulling the Scriptures up second
[30:53] Thessalonians 2 13 and 14 says but we
[30:56] are bound to give thanks always God for
[30:59] you brethren beloved of the Lord because
[31:01] God hath from the beginning chosen you
[31:03] to salvation through sanctification of
[31:06] the Spirit and belief of the truth we're
[31:09] on to he called you by our gospel to the
[31:12] obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
[31:14] Christ how many 1 obtained the glory of
[31:16] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[31:18] well the Bible says that he who has he
[31:21] who he's called he's already justified
[31:23] and he's already justified he's already
[31:26] sanctified and he sanctify he's already
[31:27] glorified amen and in the mind of God
[31:31] it's already been done
[31:33] and I know we're waiting for the
[31:35] manifestation of it that's why you got
[31:37] to keep eating that's why you got to
[31:39] keep drinking that's why you got to keep
[31:41] feeding and keep laboring hey man praise
[31:45] the Lord
[31:46] Hebrews 9:15 says and and for this cause
[31:49] he is the mediator of the New Testament
[31:50] that by means of death for the
[31:52] redemption of the transgressions that
[31:54] were under the first Testament they
[31:56] which are called might receive the
[31:58] promise of eternal inheritance
[32:00] 1st Peter 2:9 2:10 but you are a chosen
[32:03] generation a royal priesthood an holy
[32:06] nation a peculiar people you're not like
[32:09] the whole world so so you don't need to
[32:13] look like the world because you're
[32:15] peculiar amen as far as what God has
[32:18] given you amen the world doesn't have
[32:22] that right and it's gonna manifest on
[32:25] the outside that that God has given to
[32:28] you amen on the inside you see if God's
[32:31] giving you eternal life he's giving you
[32:33] this token amen then yeah it's gonna
[32:35] manifest on the outside though other
[32:38] people will see this token on display
[32:40] praise the Lord a royal priesthood an
[32:43] holy nation a peculiar people that ye
[32:45] should show forth the praises of him who
[32:46] hath called you out of darkness which in
[32:50] times past were not a people but are now
[32:52] the people of God yeah praise the Lord
[32:55] now here in verse 3 we continue here
[32:59] with the parable so these these laborers
[33:03] they agreed with the master to work for
[33:05] a penny and they went out to work and he
[33:07] went out about the third hour now who is
[33:09] the heat this is the master of the
[33:11] vineyard he went out about the third
[33:13] hour and saw others standing idle in the
[33:16] marketplace so now the third hour if you
[33:19] look at the Jewish the time time time
[33:22] the third hour would be around 9:00 a.m.
[33:24] somewhere around that time and the lord
[33:27] of the vineyard even at this time
[33:29] because he hired his the the first set
[33:32] of laborers around 6 a.m. to start
[33:35] working now it's 9 a.m. now he's got a
[33:38] higher no some more amen the lord of the
[33:41] vineyard he's still looking for laborers
[33:42] amen
[33:43] he hasn't stopped seeking
[33:46] he knows that there's people out there
[33:48] there that are his Amen praise the Lord
[33:51] aren't you glad that he didn't stop
[33:53] seeking you what if he said oh it's 9:00
[33:56] a.m. I already got everybody that I need
[33:58] you know I already got it no he has
[34:01] attributes that were part of him that he
[34:03] knew before the foundation of the world
[34:05] in the back of his mind they were that
[34:08] you are part of them you are one of
[34:10] those attributes I mean they had to come
[34:12] here on earth to manifest him amen so
[34:16] he's not going to lose not one and these
[34:18] attributes all make up the body of the
[34:21] the body of Christ which is the bride
[34:23] Amen the bride in this hour praise the
[34:25] Lord and verse four it says and he said
[34:29] unto them when he went out to those to
[34:31] those there at 9:00 a.m. and he said
[34:33] unto them go ye also into the vineyard
[34:35] and whatsoever is right I will give you
[34:38] now you notice the wording here here is
[34:41] different than the word then then the
[34:43] wording from the first for the first set
[34:45] the first ones that he had asked around
[34:47] 6:00 in the morning he bargained with
[34:50] them and told them hey you work for me
[34:53] for a penny all right but here these
[34:57] he's telling you go to the vineyard and
[35:00] whatsoever is right
[35:02] in other words whatsoever is fair I'm
[35:05] gonna pay you so if you if you think
[35:08] about the laborers you know the laborers
[35:09] these laborers were standing around idle
[35:12] you know they were not doing anything
[35:13] they were just standing around you know
[35:15] waiting for somebody to come hire them
[35:17] so you know being that it's 9:00 a.m.
[35:20] they probably think well hey I'm sure
[35:23] he's gonna give us something fair you
[35:24] know fair he knows it's 9:00 a.m. so
[35:26] let's just go go go and work amen
[35:29] praise the Lord and so he didn't tell
[35:33] them how much they were gonna get paid
[35:34] he just told him that they were gonna
[35:35] get paid go work whatever is right
[35:38] that's what I'll pay you a man these
[35:40] laborers they had confidence in him that
[35:42] they were he was gonna pay them the fair
[35:46] a fair pay amen
[35:48] then in verse 5 again he went out about
[35:51] the sixth and ninth hour and did
[35:54] likewise in other words he did the exact
[35:57] thing at 12:00 p.m. and that 3:00 p.m.
[36:01] that day I was getting hot you know
[36:06] 12:00 1:00 p.m. my goodness man is
[36:08] scorching outside
[36:10] I can't wait for cool weather man and so
[36:14] here is that time and he's still looking
[36:17] for Labor's to go work amen
[36:21] as they say the heat is on hey man but
[36:26] you know what Saints things can get hot
[36:28] and things can get pretty pretty hard
[36:31] and tough amen but there's nothing that
[36:33] God can't do amen there's nothing that
[36:35] Christ they met it's not too tough that
[36:38] too tough for him that he can't do it or
[36:40] that he can't handle amen
[36:42] he still a man expects that he knows
[36:46] that you can do all things through him
[36:49] who strengthens you amen
[36:51] no matter how hard it is no matter how
[36:53] the situation looks bleak look scorching
[36:56] Amen
[36:57] he said that all you can do all things
[37:00] through Christ who strengthens you hey
[37:02] man now that's a promise that he made
[37:04] and if we believe that promise you'll
[37:08] fulfill it through our lives a memory in
[37:11] about the eleventh hour in verse six
[37:14] about the eleventh hour he went out now
[37:18] this 11th hour this is 5:00 p.m. now
[37:20] sun's about to go down it's the evening
[37:24] time amen and about the eleventh hour he
[37:29] went out and found others standing idle
[37:32] and said unto them why stand ye here all
[37:36] the day idle right now you notice now
[37:39] that he even treated these on the 11th
[37:42] hour differently than even the ones at
[37:44] the at the at the 12 p.m. and the 3 p.m.
[37:48] hours because now he's asking them a
[37:50] question why why are you standing here
[37:54] idle in other words it's almost the end
[37:58] of the day it's almost time for
[38:03] everybody for the whistle to blow and to
[38:06] go home
[38:07] why are you see
[38:10] here standing not doing anything right
[38:13] that's why he's asking him the question
[38:16] weren't you supposed to be working all
[38:18] day here at 6 p.m. we stopped working
[38:22] because that was around 5 p.m. the 11th
[38:24] hour for them and the Jewish time was
[38:27] around 5 p.m. 6 p.m. you know it was it
[38:30] was it was everything's you know they
[38:32] sleep during that time a man it was it's
[38:34] getting dark everything stops why are
[38:38] you standing here idle and saying I'd
[38:41] like to I'd like to think that Christ is
[38:44] asking some of us that same question us
[38:48] the 11th hour workers we're supposed to
[38:51] be the 11th hour workers why are we
[38:54] standing around waiting on the bus why I
[39:05] you can hear a pin drop on this carpet
[39:12] Saints I have to ask myself the same
[39:14] question why are we doing in this late
[39:18] hour that we're living rain Saints what
[39:21] is it that you are doing amen the day is
[39:24] far spent the hour is late we know the
[39:28] coming of the Lord is soon at hand we
[39:33] know we know the end time is here why
[39:37] are we doing about that oh I'm just
[39:42] gonna play more video games I was gonna
[39:44] go watch more TV I'm just gonna go get
[39:47] involved in more things and more money
[39:49] money-making schemes and more business
[39:51] thing things that take you away from
[39:52] from from from from God not knocking
[39:56] none of those things they have their
[39:58] place but what are you doing amen to
[40:01] remember this all has to do about
[40:04] lifting the kingdom of heaven up what
[40:07] are you doing about lifting the kingdom
[40:09] of heaven up or are you just worried
[40:12] about yourself or are you worried only
[40:15] about what you can get out of this life
[40:18] because let me tell you sayings that is
[40:20] not the Spirit of Christ
[40:23] what are you doing in this late hour a
[40:25] man you see it was 5 p.m. the day was
[40:30] almost gone and they had only one hour
[40:32] left I know could you see the master was
[40:35] surprised to see them standing amen
[40:38] so what ask that question what part am i
[40:41] playing in the body of Christ now you
[40:43] really can't play a part if you don't
[40:45] have the Holy Spirit as simple as that
[40:49] if this word is is not a reality to you
[40:53] Saints if it hasn't become a reality or
[40:57] revelation to you that has that has
[41:00] sunken down and then and then you're
[41:03] anchored in this word and nothing can
[41:05] move you then you can't really pay a
[41:08] player a role in the body right we want
[41:14] you to be around I'm not talking I'm not
[41:16] saying you know here at the church but
[41:18] I'm just saying we want Christ wants you
[41:20] to be around
[41:20] amen Christ wants you to hear his word
[41:24] Christ wants you to to pay attention to
[41:27] what's going on amen but sometimes we
[41:29] get in the way of him doing something in
[41:33] our lives you know when when when
[41:39] sometimes we tell it we tell our kids
[41:42] you know to do something in the house or
[41:44] clean the house or do something or or
[41:46] we're all cleaning the house together
[41:48] right and sometimes Thomas says if
[41:53] better they just go over and sit sit
[41:56] over there cuz it's almost like they're
[41:57] just getting in the way of you doing
[42:00] what you're supposed to do because
[42:03] they're just standing there and you've
[42:05] told them go do this go do that go to
[42:07] that and they just stand there amen but
[42:12] you see we want to make sure he meant
[42:15] that we're we're not standing amen when
[42:18] just sitting idle it man why are you
[42:20] doing what are you doing for Christ in
[42:23] this hour praise the Lord so here we
[42:29] continue reading in verse 7 and this is
[42:32] the answer that the 11th hour workers
[42:34] the 11th hour workers gave them
[42:36] I say unto him because no man hath hired
[42:39] us see the intention of these men they
[42:42] wanted to be hired amen but nobody would
[42:46] hire them they waited all day long and
[42:48] nobody hired them praise God
[42:53] amen he saith unto them go ye also into
[42:57] the vineyard and whatsoever is right
[42:59] that's all you receive now he didn't
[43:02] bargain with them for a penny he just
[43:05] told them the same thing he told the
[43:06] previous ones whatsoever is right that's
[43:08] what I'll give you
[43:10] so to go work for one hour my goodness
[43:15] it's almost time to go home it's almost
[43:18] time it's almost time to to you know to
[43:20] go ahead and just clock out you know but
[43:25] really they weren't working so there's
[43:26] nothing to clock out amen still even at
[43:33] this late hour this labor this this
[43:35] owner this vineyard wanted them to go
[43:37] work I mean it doesn't matter the far
[43:40] the day is far spent there's still
[43:42] something for us to do in this hour amen
[43:45] you know brother Branham said always
[43:47] remember what brother Branham said he
[43:48] said you know work as if Christ is
[43:54] coming in a thousand years but live as
[43:57] if he's coming tomorrow amen
[44:00] do what you need to do in your physical
[44:03] life amen save up do whatever it needs
[44:07] to be done amen
[44:08] there's nothing wrong with those things
[44:09] but live amen as if he's coming tomorrow
[44:13] amen as if this thing culminates
[44:16] tomorrow at 6:00 in the morning
[44:18] all right 9:00 in the morning amen
[44:21] because Saints you don't know the day in
[44:23] the hour amen reunion you don't know
[44:26] that the time when may may be your time
[44:28] a man your time to go
[44:31] we're not assured of this life this life
[44:34] isn't given to us with with an assurance
[44:37] we have our life is fragile amen and you
[44:42] may not make it down those stairs
[44:44] tonight
[44:47] you know something could happen amen but
[44:52] he's in it our our life is in his hands
[44:54] and now praise God that's what we put
[44:58] our trust in him so these labors these
[45:01] 11th hour workers they gladly accepted
[45:04] to offer no questions asked
[45:06] they didn't ask him any questions they
[45:09] just okay that's fine we'll go work
[45:11] because it was better to start working
[45:14] in the eleventh hour than then to not
[45:15] work at all it was better it was better
[45:20] to do something even in that late of the
[45:22] hour than to not do anything at all amen
[45:25] so moving on here says so when even was
[45:28] come the lord of the vineyard saith unto
[45:30] his steward now you notice that it says
[45:33] there the evening they even the evening
[45:36] time came a man and the lord of the
[45:40] vineyard saith unto his steward amen
[45:42] who is that Stewart the Holy Ghost amen
[45:46] call the laborers and give them their
[45:49] hire in other words give them what they
[45:50] were there owed what their what the what
[45:52] the what the pay but look out what he
[45:55] says he says beginning from the last
[45:57] unto the first amen now you we think
[46:04] that there should be the other way
[46:05] around because you know give the other
[46:07] ones that he started to started working
[46:09] first give them the pay a man and then
[46:12] and then at the light do you know the
[46:14] last ones that came in in the eleventh
[46:15] hour then they get paid last but this
[46:18] labor this owner this vineyard wanted to
[46:20] fir the last ones that came in to get
[46:22] paid first amen praise God amen now in
[46:31] John 9 for says I must work the works of
[46:35] him that sent me while it is day the
[46:38] night cometh when no man can work
[46:40] Amen so this is the time Amen they
[46:43] couldn't work any more and it was
[46:45] evening time no they couldn't work any
[46:47] more amen
[46:48] so here we see that the laborers they
[46:51] were going to get paid now if we
[46:53] continue reading here in verse 9 it says
[46:55] and when they came that were hired about
[46:57] the eleventh hour they received
[46:59] man a penny it was the exact same pay
[47:03] that the first one say Mandic they were
[47:05] hired were bargained with the with the
[47:09] owner of the of the vineyard to get paid
[47:11] these 11th hour workers got the same pay
[47:13] now we all know that we all know this
[47:15] sense but here what's well what's
[47:18] interesting is that if you think if
[47:22] you're one of these labors if you're one
[47:23] of these workers what do you think
[47:26] Amen that here you were going to work
[47:29] and you're probably thinking well you
[47:30] know I'm gonna pay don't get paid only
[47:32] for just working one hour but here when
[47:35] you're getting your pay you're getting
[47:37] the exact same pay that the other ones
[47:39] are getting how do you think you're
[47:42] gonna feel a man as the labor that only
[47:44] worked for one hour as at 11th hour
[47:46] worker how do you think you'd feel what
[47:48] do you think that you'd think about that
[47:50] that master that owner of that vineyard
[47:52] oh my goodness yeah that's a good guy
[47:57] man I'd love to work for him I'd love to
[48:00] continue working for him
[48:01] my goodness only works for one hour and
[48:04] and and and and here he's paying me the
[48:07] exact same thing that he paid the others
[48:10] that have labored all the whole day my
[48:14] goodness and you know what you're so
[48:16] excited about it and you're so happy
[48:18] about it you probably go and tell the
[48:20] others tell other people about it Amen
[48:22] my goodness God gave me this this this
[48:27] eternal life amen God gave me this grace
[48:30] say man this this pay that he gave me
[48:33] amen and and in this in this late hour
[48:36] amen he's still filling with the Holy
[48:38] Ghost amen
[48:39] he's still doing great things in our
[48:41] lives amen
[48:42] he's still doing mighty things amen it
[48:45] wasn't just for back then but it wasn't
[48:47] just for the time when brother Branham
[48:49] was here Amen God is doing great things
[48:51] in this house God is doing great things
[48:53] in your day God is doing awesome things
[48:58] in each and every one of our lives and
[49:01] sometimes we overlook that pay or though
[49:06] or the benefits of serving Christ
[49:09] a man we overlooked a man I woke up this
[49:12] morning feeling fine I woke up with
[49:16] having on my mind I hope so didn't wake
[49:22] up with hell on your mind cuz if you
[49:26] wake up with Hell on your mind you gonna
[49:27] manifest hell
[49:31] Amen but God has given you such great
[49:35] things in this hour he meant so these
[49:37] laborers I'm sure they were excited they
[49:39] were happy amen praise the Lord each
[49:44] servant needed to be paid at the end of
[49:47] the same day they worked because see
[49:50] they needed it now if you read I just
[49:53] want to read this here invert
[49:54] Deuteronomy chapter 24 verse 14 through
[49:57] 15 if they they could bring that up and
[49:59] they have it up this is the law that
[50:04] that that was given to the two to them
[50:08] back then it says thou shalt not
[50:10] oppressed and hired servant that is poor
[50:13] and needy see so these laborers there
[50:17] were needy they needed to work they
[50:19] needed to be hired whether he be of thy
[50:22] brethren or of thy strangers that are in
[50:24] thy land within thy gates at his day
[50:27] thou shalt give him his hire in other
[50:29] words at the end of the day you're gonna
[50:32] pay him so Jesus is bringing this this
[50:36] this this parable amen incorporating
[50:39] this in you know going back to what this
[50:42] says his day thou shalt give him his
[50:45] hire neither shall the Sun go down upon
[50:47] it in other words you're not the day's
[50:49] not gonna be over and you're not gonna
[50:51] pay this man because back then they
[50:54] would get paid the same day that they
[50:56] worked see today nowadays we work and we
[51:00] get paid maybe bi-weekly every two weeks
[51:02] or every week or every month I get paid
[51:06] every month but is it something you get
[51:12] used to it you have to budget your very
[51:17] wisely neither shall the Sun go down
[51:20] upon him for he is poor look
[51:23] this late for heat this labor is poor
[51:25] and setteth his heart upon it in other
[51:28] words he's waiting for it you see st.
[51:32] he's waiting for this pay a man he he's
[51:37] working in his desire a man is for this
[51:39] pay a man at the here at the end time
[51:41] amen and you have something that you
[51:44] desire in this our Saints amen your hope
[51:47] is in Christ amen
[51:48] you know amen you keep walking a man you
[51:51] keep serving the Lord you keep
[51:53] struggling you keep you keep fighting
[51:55] and then you keep Lavery you keep
[51:57] working but you know that at the end
[51:58] time amen there's gonna be is gonna pay
[52:00] off it's gonna be worth it praise God
[52:06] it's gonna be worth it your heart is set
[52:13] upon it
[52:14] right look what it says lest he cry
[52:18] against thee unto the Lord and it be a
[52:21] sin unto thee for so you see this owner
[52:24] this vineyard wasn't gonna allow for
[52:26] these men to say man this this man man
[52:29] he's goodness gracious you don't pay you
[52:32] go work for him and he don't even pay
[52:34] you hey you weren't gonna say that about
[52:36] him no and nobody's gonna say anything
[52:39] like that about the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:40] amen
[52:42] about his benefits you can't say nothing
[52:44] you can't say you can't ever say that
[52:46] God has ever failed you never I can't
[52:51] ever say that I've always felt him but
[52:54] he has never failed me amen
[52:56] I felt to do what I'm supposed to do I
[52:59] felt to be involved with what I'm
[53:01] supposed to be involved or do what I'm
[53:02] supposed to do but he never one time has
[53:05] ever failed me amen
[53:07] his mercies are great a man they keep it
[53:10] there abounding amen he has never failed
[53:13] me yet and I don't think he'll ever
[53:16] failed me right I'll probably fail him
[53:19] many other times I don't want to a man
[53:24] but he that's why he's mercy and grace
[53:28] is there amen
[53:30] now we're getting to a point here Saints
[53:32] I appreciate you listening so kin so
[53:35] intently
[53:37] so you see Saints that grace is the main
[53:42] theme of the Christian life yeah because
[53:49] those that came in first or those who
[53:52] come in last needed it just the same
[53:58] they all needed that page just the same
[54:01] amen
[54:02] but it's the it's it's it's what it's
[54:05] the amounts you see humanly thinking
[54:09] you'd read this and you think my
[54:11] goodness the ones that started working
[54:12] at 6:00 a.m. should get paid more but
[54:15] that's not what they agreed for that's
[54:18] not what they agreed with up with the
[54:20] lay with the master of the vineyard they
[54:23] agreed for one penny and then the other
[54:26] ones that came in well they're like what
[54:28] it's better than slates it is you know
[54:30] standing around so we're just gonna work
[54:32] for a couple of hours then either we're
[54:33] gonna get something they just didn't
[54:35] know exactly what but here they're at
[54:38] the end time amen they all get a penny
[54:41] they all get the same pay the Bible says
[54:47] for by grace are ye saved amen we don't
[54:51] deserve it but we need it
[54:55] hey man we need that grace we need that
[54:59] pay amen
[55:01] we need it in this hour my goodness that
[55:04] one of the darkest hours is this hour
[55:08] amen just the angel of the Lord just
[55:13] aloud just a little sliver of light
[55:15] there in there and that church age for
[55:20] you that's for you and me darkest hour
[55:23] that we live in we need the grace of God
[55:25] ma I need His grace I don't know about
[55:28] you but when the first came verse 10
[55:32] going back to the parable says but when
[55:33] the first came in other words the ones
[55:36] that were hired at 6:00 in the morning
[55:37] they supposed that they should have
[55:41] received more they saw that the last one
[55:45] the 11th hour worker came in and he got
[55:47] to see the world he
[55:49] paid the same thing I'm getting I'm
[55:51] supposed to get paid are you only been
[55:53] working for one hour that's saying right
[55:56] man
[56:00] I can't believe this no Pam goodness you
[56:08] know they were and they were all excited
[56:10] you know get ready to get paid you know
[56:12] back then when they used to give out the
[56:14] paychecks at the end of the workday you
[56:15] know and you're excited and then
[56:18] something like that happens man getting
[56:21] paid the same thing I'll get petty he's
[56:23] all he been yet he's making the same
[56:25] that I'm making he's only been in here
[56:27] six months I've been here six years
[56:33] you know how many of us work with people
[56:36] like that
[56:36] [Laughter]
[56:40] hey murmuring and complaining amen
[56:44] you better be glad you got somewhere to
[56:46] work out hey man you better be glad that
[56:48] you got is giving you even the strength
[56:50] to even go to work man praise God's
[56:54] either things that we take take for
[56:56] granted even the health that you God
[57:00] gave you to wake up in the morning so

[57:24] work I'm grumbling complaining for what

[57:49] needs something right that I can offer
[57:51] them today amen praise God God has you
[57:55] where you're at for a Pacific reason
[57:58] specific reason
[58:00] hey man don't look at it any other way
[58:03] amen
[58:06] so they supposed that they should have
[58:09] received more and they likewise received
[58:11] every man a penny amen
[58:14] so here at the end time and all
[58:16] throughout the church ages Amen this
[58:18] broad that has been coming up through
[58:20] all the churches is the exact same Holy
[58:22] Ghost no different Holy Ghost that
[58:25] Luther got than what we got Amen there's
[58:29] just more light on the word now thank
[58:31] God for that and you know Saints it
[58:34] makes me thinks it makes me think you
[58:37] know the people back then they struggled
[58:39] to even even be able to have a Bible to
[58:42] read in their language now we have the
[58:47] Bible over 1100 messages and much more
[58:55] in a device like this that we can carry
[58:59] around and we still don't read the Bible
[59:04] and we still don't don't don't don't
[59:07] study or listen to the word read the
[59:09] message and those people back then they
[59:12] struggles they labored throughout that
[59:14] hot Sun yeah amen and here we are God
[59:18] amen still giving us the same pay that
[59:21] they got back then amen praise God
[59:24] because it's the same Holy Spirit
[59:26] because it's the same grace amen praise
[59:30] God because Saints we are all equal in
[59:34] the sight of God amen there's no bigger
[59:38] eyes or little use amen we're all equal
[59:40] in his sight and when they had received
[59:44] it verse 11 they murderer against the
[59:46] good man of the house amen
[59:49] I mean how many of us sometimes Amen we
[59:52] see somebody being blessed and instead
[59:56] of you being happy for them you
[59:58] criticize it my goodness they're doing
[1:00:03] something for God right that church over
[1:00:06] there they're doing something for the
[1:00:07] Lord oh my but they're holding youth
[1:00:11] camps over here and they're doing this
[1:00:12] and that for the other
[1:00:14] and instead of us a man praying for them
[1:00:16] we criticize when Jesus told the
[1:00:23] disciples and he told him and he said it
[1:00:25] there for us amen
[1:00:27] and they're not against us if they're
[1:00:30] for spreading the kingdom of God amen
[1:00:32] they're not for against the kingdom of
[1:00:34] God so why why why kick it on the side
[1:00:38] of the curve and say it's nothing hey
[1:00:41] man if somebody's doing something for
[1:00:42] God amen let's see what we can do to
[1:00:44] help amen because maybe in turn that you
[1:00:48] can you're helping them you might be you
[1:00:50] might be to helping the cause you might
[1:00:52] be able to help even the ones that are
[1:00:54] working in that area you see what you
[1:00:57] just look at it that way Saints amen
[1:01:00] they murmured against the good man of
[1:01:02] the house
[1:01:03] same verse 12 these last have these last
[1:01:06] have wrought but one hour in other words
[1:01:08] they've worked for one hour and you have
[1:01:10] made them equal unto us well that's the
[1:01:13] what God is in the business of doing
[1:01:16] you're not bigger than me and I'm not
[1:01:18] bigger than you amen we're all equal in
[1:01:22] the sight of God
[1:01:23] we all need Christ just like anybody
[1:01:26] else needs Christ amen
[1:01:29] praise God which have borne the burden
[1:01:32] and heat of the day amen it reminds me
[1:01:35] of the prodigal son remember when the
[1:01:38] prodigal son he went out he took the
[1:01:40] father's inheritance and he went out and
[1:01:43] spent it and and women and bought a
[1:01:46] bunch of Xboxes and ps4s and a bunch of
[1:01:50] Nike shoes and a bunch of all kinds of
[1:01:52] stuff and and they just bend it and you
[1:01:55] know and then didn't even have a budget
[1:01:56] or anything I just thought that they
[1:01:59] could just you know he just spent it you
[1:02:01] know and one day he came to a point
[1:02:04] where he couldn't charge that that
[1:02:05] credit card anymore that debit card
[1:02:10] because he thought he had infinite funds
[1:02:14] he was getting ready to go buy some
[1:02:17] drinks for his friends there at the bar
[1:02:19] or wherever he was at come to find out
[1:02:24] he couldn't
[1:02:26] this is the the lady came back I said
[1:02:28] listen I can't I can give you one more
[1:02:30] drink
[1:02:31] that's for you guy came but you can't
[1:02:34] buy anymore you have no more money
[1:02:36] I can't charge the rest of this on your
[1:02:38] car but if it was nowadays they'd still
[1:02:41] go through cuz you know they want you in
[1:02:42] debt so I'd still go through but back
[1:02:46] then you know he couldn't continue and
[1:02:49] his riotous living because his money is
[1:02:52] all gone now so here he goes I've been
[1:02:55] getting off the dog track but he goes
[1:02:57] back to this house
[1:02:58] his father shows him grace right and
[1:03:01] here's his brother who then do that that
[1:03:07] he did with with with the money with his
[1:03:09] father's money he stayed at home he was
[1:03:12] faithful to God attitude to his father
[1:03:14] he was faithful and he obeyed him he did
[1:03:17] everything he was supposed to do and
[1:03:18] instead of his brother being excited
[1:03:21] just as excited as his father was to see
[1:03:24] his son come home from living riotously
[1:03:28] from living that way from from being in
[1:03:31] sin and eating with pigs no his brother
[1:03:34] gets upset with him and his brother gets
[1:03:38] upset with his own father - and says

[1:04:42] against the 11th hour workers that's why
[1:04:44] they reminds me of a man those
[1:04:46] complainers complainers always
[1:04:48] complaining about something a man well
[1:04:51] they're just not doing it exactly the
[1:04:52] way I like it
[1:04:53] we'll get over your man it's not all
[1:04:58] about you amen
[1:05:00] it's about advancing the kingdom let's
[1:05:02] let's see what we can all do amen to
[1:05:05] advance the kingdom of God amen
[1:05:07] what can we do all of us do we all have
[1:05:10] a part to play amen you remember when
[1:05:16] Jesus rebuked John for his intolerance
[1:05:19] one time in mark chapter 9 verse 38 he
[1:05:23] said in John answered him saying master
[1:05:26] we saw one casting out Devils in thy
[1:05:29] name and he did not follow us he doesn't
[1:05:32] follow us he doesn't come to our church
[1:05:36] he doesn't he doesn't believe the
[1:05:38] message and and we and we forbad him
[1:05:42] because he followeth not us we told him
[1:05:45] to stop because he doesn't he doesn't
[1:05:47] believe the message but jesus said
[1:05:51] forbid him not in other words don't tell
[1:05:55] him to stop amen
[1:05:57] for there is no man which shall do a
[1:05:59] miracle in my name that can lightly
[1:06:02] speak evil of me for he that is not
[1:06:06] against us is in our part sunday is on
[1:06:09] our part amen
[1:06:11] let's let's not be quick to criticize a
[1:06:14] man church next door is having a
[1:06:16] function praise the Lord before our
[1:06:18] church when they're having an
[1:06:20] opportunity to hear the Word of God at
[1:06:22] least John 3:16 hey it's the Word of God
[1:06:24] I'm criticized we all get we all we all
[1:06:29] get critical spirits amen and it's
[1:06:33] something that is it's an attitude
[1:06:36] that's lacking grace grace is more than
[1:06:43] you think again
[1:06:45] and by you being critical it attitude
[1:06:51] that doesn't have grace in it at all
[1:06:53] amen but he answered one of them the the
[1:06:59] parable here almost done but he answered
[1:07:01] one of them and said friend I do thee no
[1:07:03] wrong hey I was fair with you I didn't
[1:07:06] do you wrong
[1:07:07] they didn't you agree with me for a
[1:07:10] penny now the the labor the the one that
[1:07:15] started 6:00 in the morning you'd have
[1:07:16] to say yes I did agree with you for a
[1:07:18] penny
[1:07:18] I didn't do you no wrong take and take
[1:07:21] verse 14 take dine take that dine is and
[1:07:25] go your way keep going I will give unto
[1:07:30] this last even as unto thee now look
[1:07:33] what he says continue it is not lawful
[1:07:36] for me to do is it not lawful for me to
[1:07:38] do what I will with mine own amen hey
[1:07:44] God can do whatever he wants to with
[1:07:46] with with his with with with what's his
[1:07:50] God can save the worst sinner if he
[1:07:53] wants to God can do whatever he wants to
[1:07:58] a man and who are you and my man to to
[1:08:00] to say God you shouldn't do it this way
[1:08:02] you can't do it this way now this can't
[1:08:05] be done this way that's not up to you to
[1:08:07] decide God's the one that decides that
[1:08:10] right God's a more gracious God than you
[1:08:14] and I Oh we'll ever be
[1:08:15] you won't you don't understand the grace
[1:08:18] of God until you really experience the
[1:08:21] grace of God and even then you won't we
[1:08:25] don't fully understand it is it not
[1:08:31] lawful for me to do what I will with
[1:08:33] mine own this dine i evil because I am
[1:08:37] good see are you thinking evil because
[1:08:43] here I am I did something good I gave
[1:08:46] these 11th hour workers a penny just
[1:08:48] like you guys got a penny you should be
[1:08:52] happy that they'd received the same the
[1:08:54] same that you that you received in other
[1:08:58] words is what if
[1:08:59] that's what Jesus was trying to tell
[1:09:00] them you should be happy but no instead
[1:09:04] you're not I want this I want us to
[1:09:08] think about this and consider our lives
[1:09:10] consider where we're failing it we're
[1:09:13] failing God in that in those areas
[1:09:14] grumbling and complaining and not happy
[1:09:17] when somebody's prospering spiritually
[1:09:20] when somebody's prospering spiritually
[1:09:22] amen no matter who it is amen we should
[1:09:25] be excited and happy amen oh oh well
[1:09:28] they don't come to church but once a
[1:09:30] year well praise God they're here
[1:09:33] praise God they're here to hear the word
[1:09:35] at least one day hallelujah and treat
[1:09:40] them that way
[1:09:43] amen he don't serve the Lord she don't
[1:09:47] serve the Lord look what they did they
[1:09:49] did this this and that of the other
[1:09:52] praise God they're a church amen
[1:09:56] God's in control God knows that by each
[1:10:00] and every one of our lives God knows
[1:10:03] what's best for us he can't deal with
[1:10:05] you the same way he deals with hair or
[1:10:07] him you know praise God I hope you know
[1:10:11] you know what I'm talking about
[1:10:13] His grace can cover anyone and there is
[1:10:16] nothing you can say or do about it
[1:10:18] because you know what Saints is His
[1:10:20] grace it's not your grace your if it's
[1:10:24] your grace my good that is probably
[1:10:25] there's no grace at all
[1:10:27] but is His grace so he can do whatever
[1:10:30] he wants to Amen it covers a multitude
[1:10:33] of sins amen you should be glad that he
[1:10:39] can show others the same grace he's
[1:10:41] shown to you amen so then in verse 16 he
[1:10:45] says so the last shall be first and the
[1:10:47] first last for many be called but few
[1:10:50] chosen a man that's the reason Saints
[1:10:54] that I believe Saints in this hour and
[1:10:57] I'll just tell you as my personal my
[1:10:58] personal testimony but here in the last
[1:11:01] few years and I thank God because God
[1:11:04] had a purpose for us to come here in
[1:11:06] this church God had a purpose for you to
[1:11:09] come here to this church
[1:11:10] God knew what I needed spiritually amen
[1:11:14] but in the last few years I believe God
[1:11:17] has been revealing more things to me
[1:11:19] than I ever I came to the message in
[1:11:21] 1999 and I'm not I'm not saying that
[1:11:25] it's it's bits brother Dale Amen it's
[1:11:28] the Holy Spirit in the ministry amen
[1:11:30] I tribute and I thank God I mean but I
[1:11:33] thank God I thank brother Dale and I
[1:11:35] think for these brothers here they who
[1:11:37] submit themselves to the Holy Ghost they
[1:11:39] meant to give us exactly what we need us
[1:11:42] food and spiritual in due season they
[1:11:44] meant well I heard that 20 years ago
[1:11:47] well you need to hear it again because
[1:11:51] you don't have grace of God in your life
[1:11:53] the way you should I know about the
[1:11:56] grace of God but you need to have learn
[1:11:59] how to have it on others amen praise God
[1:12:06] and so Saints that's the reason why the
[1:12:09] first shall be last unless I hear
[1:12:10] blessed are those who have not seen and
[1:12:13] yet believe I was not there at the
[1:12:17] meetings with the Prophet I did not see
[1:12:19] now one miracle never shook brother
[1:12:21] branham's hand I wish I could have
[1:12:22] shaken his hand I wish I could have been
[1:12:24] there I would have loved to but you know
[1:12:27] what's Saints I really believe that
[1:12:30] brother Branham would right now be
[1:12:32] cheering for those of us say men who
[1:12:35] have come up amen and said those those
[1:12:38] those people really believed the message
[1:12:40] the message that I preached the message
[1:12:43] that I preached they're really believing
[1:12:46] what I'm what I'm saying
[1:12:47] what I said amen why because though now
[1:12:50] that message that he's preached is be
[1:12:52] coming into manifestation in in and God
[1:12:55] has been doing such a powerful and quick
[1:12:59] work
[1:12:59] Amen in these last few years then he has
[1:13:02] for for the ages of the Christian of the
[1:13:06] the Christian you know the Christian
[1:13:09] walk Amen God is doing something quick
[1:13:12] right now amen and powerful in this hour
[1:13:17] amen and only those who are gonna be in
[1:13:20] tuned my man with that Holy Spirit amen
[1:13:22] are able to
[1:13:24] and pick it up some of us are still
[1:13:28] looking back 50 feet 50 feet 36 56 years
[1:13:30] ago a menace but some of us amen God's
[1:13:35] doing quick working us and I thank God
[1:13:37] for that I know
[1:13:38] praise the Lord so that's why Jesus said
[1:13:42] the first shall be last and the last
[1:13:43] shall be first amen
[1:13:46] the last that we have come in a man here
[1:13:49] in this late hour a man those of us who
[1:13:51] really love God and really want to serve
[1:13:53] God and really want more of God amen
[1:13:55] we're receiving quick bursts of that
[1:13:57] word and it's not just for head
[1:14:00] knowledge but it should be to change us
[1:14:02] amen more and more into the image of
[1:14:04] Christ amen it's not for head knowledge
[1:14:08] not that not not to say that I know more
[1:14:10] than you or no than that amen you see
[1:14:13] the labor that brother Dale has had has
[1:14:15] has had to go through since he came into
[1:14:18] the message he's labored a lot in the
[1:14:21] word he didn't have these things that we
[1:14:24] have nowadays you know now we can get a
[1:14:28] revelation from God quickly if we wanted
[1:14:31] to even if he wants to reveal it to us
[1:14:34] we're back then they used to take hours
[1:14:37] and maybe days to just find one quote
[1:14:42] now I'm not I'm not saying that's why
[1:14:44] Jesus said to first shall be last and
[1:14:46] the last shall be first that's not
[1:14:48] that's not a that's not a slam on
[1:14:50] brother Dale he gets the same grace that
[1:14:53] I get even that I came in in this last
[1:14:57] hour amen
[1:14:59] it's the same God is the same Christ is
[1:15:02] the same grace is the same forgiveness
[1:15:04] is the same Holy Spirit amen
[1:15:08] praise God so those here in the end time
[1:15:13] Amen seem to be getting it quicker than
[1:15:15] those who have come in at the earlier
[1:15:18] time amen which is what we see amen
[1:15:22] praise God now we see here that just
[1:15:28] real quick it said that we as the
[1:15:30] eleventh hour workers have been shown
[1:15:32] that grace and you know what Saints the
[1:15:35] closer we get to the top of the capstone
[1:15:38] the more grace we should be showing I
[1:15:42] remember that when we read therein in
[1:15:44] Ezekiel a man that that capstone comes
[1:15:47] down crying grace grace amen
[1:15:50] I love grace the fullness of Christ the
[1:15:53] fullness of the word a man as we're
[1:15:56] coming up amen that grace should be
[1:15:58] coming closer amen amen as we're doing
[1:16:01] our part he's doing his we should be
[1:16:03] more gracious more than you were 15-20
[1:16:09] years ago we should be more gracious hey
[1:16:11] man we should have more grace in our
[1:16:13] life and then also for the life of
[1:16:14] others hey you man because to me that's
[1:16:18] like a magnet amen
[1:16:20] that a magnet that headstone is like a
[1:16:22] magnet when when when when when you when
[1:16:25] you have a magnet and you have an object
[1:16:27] that's that can they can be pulled by
[1:16:29] the magnet the closer you get it to the
[1:16:31] magnet the quicker is going to get to it
[1:16:33] so if it's over here it's going to take
[1:16:36] a little bit longer to get to the object
[1:16:38] right but if it's closer to it it's
[1:16:40] going to come to it quicker amen so as
[1:16:43] we're scaling up a man in the stature of
[1:16:45] a perfect man amen we should be more
[1:16:47] gracious we should be reflecting that
[1:16:51] grace more and more amen
[1:16:54] praise the Lord that's crying grace
[1:16:59] grace amen
[1:17:00] and do you remember Saints and I'll
[1:17:03] finish with this do you remember the
[1:17:04] story of Joseph what a story of grace
[1:17:10] but do you know do you know we all know
[1:17:13] the story and I'm not gonna go but Matt
[1:17:14] - I'll just be quickly man but do you
[1:17:16] know that Joseph was the eleventh son if
[1:17:21] you count all the sons that were born he
[1:17:24] was the eleventh one that was born and
[1:17:27] we know that he was hated by his
[1:17:29] brethren he was he was he was he was a
[1:17:32] they hated him by his but his older
[1:17:35] brothers because he had visions he had
[1:17:37] dreams he was spiritual and he was very
[1:17:42] loved by his father and the reason why
[1:17:43] he his father loved him is because he
[1:17:45] was the first son of Rachel which his
[1:17:48] father's was his father's preference
[1:17:51] Rachel was you know he married both
[1:17:53] Rachel and Leah but Rachel was the one
[1:17:55] he'd worked for man for such a long time
[1:17:58] and here is this first son and he loved
[1:18:01] him and so the sons the other sons they
[1:18:04] saw that no and they were jealous and
[1:18:06] they they ousted him out so much they
[1:18:10] even sold him to Egypt no grace there
[1:18:15] and here's this young man 17 18 19 years
[1:18:19] old how old he was in sold amen and and
[1:18:24] and had to go through this and came up
[1:18:27] grew up in this other land in Egypt and
[1:18:30] he and it's Sean and he's shown Joseph
[1:18:33] is shown grace by Potiphar because
[1:18:36] Potiphar takes him in and he works for
[1:18:39] him and he treats him like his own son
[1:18:40] and then later on he's shown grace by
[1:18:44] even Pharaoh himself
[1:18:47] so Joseph is now acquainted with grace
[1:18:52] he's fully acquainted with grace but the
[1:18:56] grace he didn't deserve none of this
[1:18:59] well he thought there originally when he
[1:19:01] was thrown into a pit and being sold to
[1:19:03] these these these people that were gonna
[1:19:06] buy slaves he thought that that was the
[1:19:08] end of his life but he sees God is
[1:19:11] raising him up and it's not just
[1:19:14] Potiphar showing him grace and it's not
[1:19:16] just Pharaoh showing him grace but his
[1:19:17] God showing him grace the whole time
[1:19:20] amen for a purpose and so here comes
[1:19:25] Joseph gets married and has all has
[1:19:28] children and now he's in a position
[1:19:30] where he's second in command of Egypt
[1:19:33] and the famine comes in under in the
[1:19:36] land and here comes his brothers and now
[1:19:40] he realizes and we all know the story
[1:19:42] but when it comes time when he asked him
[1:19:45] about his their younger brother Benjamin
[1:19:49] now we know Benjamin is a represent a is
[1:19:52] a representative of the Jew of the Jews
[1:19:54] of the 144,000 amen so here is Joseph
[1:20:00] Amen full of grace
[1:20:03] and really amen he was fighting the
[1:20:06] whole time because you know in his human
[1:20:09] ways he wanted he wish he could get back
[1:20:11] but he knew that he couldn't do that
[1:20:13] that wasn't the right way amen
[1:20:16] probably news humans why he thought that
[1:20:18] so here's Benjamin Amen and he tells his
[1:20:21] brothers to bring Benjamin and when he
[1:20:23] sees Benjamin he something happens to
[1:20:28] him because you realize Benjamin was the
[1:20:31] second child of his of his mom of
[1:20:34] Joseph's mom you see all the other
[1:20:36] children had different mommies and their
[1:20:37] moms with Leah and in other other other
[1:20:39] other maidservants that Jacob had
[1:20:43] children with Amen but Benjamin and and
[1:20:46] Joseph were born from the same mother
[1:20:48] Rachel
[1:20:49] so hid something something happened to
[1:20:52] him something was special about him and
[1:20:54] and when they sit down and eat and
[1:20:55] everything hey the Bible says that he
[1:20:57] gave him five times more to Benjamin
[1:21:01] then what he gave them what he gave to
[1:21:04] his other brethren not that he loved
[1:21:06] them any less he gave them just the
[1:21:08] exact same food everything like
[1:21:10] everybody he just fed him more MORE
[1:21:13] amen to you Benjamin because he
[1:21:16] something happened to Benjamin so he
[1:21:18] loved Benjamin we know the story we see
[1:21:20] the story and we realized that at the
[1:21:22] end when he when he shows reveals
[1:21:25] himself to his brothers who does he hug
[1:21:27] first
[1:21:28] who does he kiss first he kisses
[1:21:31] Benjamin first Benjamin that he shows
[1:21:36] grace to a person that had not even met
[1:21:41] Joseph Benjamin had not even met Joseph
[1:21:47] and yet he has shown all this grace and
[1:21:51] then later on we if we see that he
[1:21:54] Joseph shows grace to the rest of his
[1:21:56] brothers and I but that's just to show
[1:22:00] Saints that we're supposed to be here in
[1:22:05] this grace and this grace amen that we
[1:22:08] are here a men should be spilling over
[1:22:10] because the same grace that we receive
[1:22:13] here
[1:22:14] this in this end time is going to go
[1:22:16] over to those Jews the 144,000 amen
[1:22:19] later on praise God exact same grace
[1:22:24] Benjamin didn't deserve none of those
[1:22:26] things that he - what did he do
[1:22:29] same thing with those 144,000 and you
[1:22:33] know what that really goes to show that
[1:22:35] those 100 that the first shall be last
[1:22:36] and the last shall be first because
[1:22:40] really God was the one who came to to
[1:22:42] Israel to the children of Israel for the
[1:22:45] first you remember they rejected him and
[1:22:50] yet God gives the Gentiles a man shows
[1:22:54] them grace the first shall be last and
[1:22:57] the last shall be first and those
[1:23:02] 144,000 they're gonna come in and
[1:23:04] they're gonna come in with the same
[1:23:06] grace and the same Holy Ghost that you
[1:23:07] and I receive them amen
[1:23:09] no they're no different the same pay
[1:23:13] that you and I got that's the same pay
[1:23:15] they'll get as a matter of fact their
[1:23:17] grace the grace that even the the the
[1:23:21] the fifth seal Jew brother Wade has
[1:23:25] talked about it but the deal is talked
[1:23:27] about it that's that's grace great
[1:23:31] unmerited grace my goodness do you see
[1:23:36] that we don't even understand that the
[1:23:38] grace of God that there are people who
[1:23:42] said have your blood be put on us amen
[1:23:46] let your blood on us we'll be in charge
[1:23:49] will be responsible for this man Jesus
[1:23:51] dying lay that blood on us and on our
[1:23:53] children yet God shows that those faiths
[1:23:57] he'll Jews that grace grace grace
[1:24:01] wonderful grace amen so st. I hope that
[1:24:07] you see the the 11th hour workers in a
[1:24:11] different light it's all about grace
[1:24:14] that's what Jesus was trying to bring
[1:24:16] out during that whole time his mercy and
[1:24:18] His grace in this hour right man there's
[1:24:20] other things we could talk about in
[1:24:21] there but but this thing amen culminates
[1:24:24] with grace amen
[1:24:27] and brother branham said and I read this
[1:24:30] this last quote I appreciate you all
[1:24:32] being so patient and being so gracious
[1:24:36] unto me and I'll be gracious unto you
[1:24:40] now I still have to be gracious even if
[1:24:43] I don't be shown grace right praise God
[1:24:47] Brabham says here truth then also grace
[1:24:51] is the truth then when then why could

[1:25:10] does for you works is what you do for
