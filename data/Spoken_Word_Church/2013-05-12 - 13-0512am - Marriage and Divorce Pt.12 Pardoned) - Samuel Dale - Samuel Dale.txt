you would give us understanding ears that we may hear what you'd have to say unto us but let's wade them flying back this afternoon from new jersey there the lord just have your way we love you and we thank you keep us in jesus name amen let's read our scripture we've been reading in matthew 19 and then we'll go into romans 8. the pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying unto him and remember they wouldn't want to be right or whatever they were tempting him all right so is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause in other words for just anything he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this call shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more twain but one flesh what god therefore had joined together let not man put asunder so that was his answer can you do it for just any cause he says no it wasn't so in the beginning all right verse 7 they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and to put her away he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and i say unto you now listen whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away doth commit adultery all right let's go over to romans now 8. we begin reading with verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to whom are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed see to be conformed something coming later on or it would have said predestinated them and they're already see it's pointing forward to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren or over whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called thee then he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god has done all of this what can you and i say if god be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yet rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now i want you to thank with me today and to make sure this one point thoughts in your mind the bible is positive in what it says no it's not negative it's not uh you know halfway it's perfect but you and i must accept it that way you know let's have a brother back here with us he's been here before he's ain't no visitor though he's a long way from home he ain't no visitor but see that to me is the one thing that all christians should remember when god says something he cannot back up now if he says it about his curses or whatever you know if he condemns then he condemns all right but then if he sets free then he sets free and the bible said he that the son has set free is free indeed that word indeed means there's no limitation whatsoever placed upon that or it wouldn't be called it indeed it'd say in part all right so then that way we can look at the word and be sure when we read it but the main thing of today is for me to get over to you one point if we can't believe what god has said to be true about us then it's not for us is that plain enough you know i mean if i stood up here and i said i got a million dollars up here for one person in the building that wouldn't be everybody in the building would it we've got to believe all right how did the prophet say it he said we've got to believe that there's there's only one going to make the rapture we've got to believe we're that one we can't just say well i i believe i'm gonna i think i might make it but i believe my pastor will well now your pastor might be totally lost he might not be even in the story whatsoever well i don't believe it that way well i don't either but i'm just straight and honest if we can't believe we're the only one you know if there is only one going and we can't believe we're that one see then we're not believing correctly we're only taking it on the basis of a of an understanding from somebody else a thought or an idea or even reading the bible of what somebody says see it's got to be personal all right if we get nothing you get nothing now the message today you get that part that what we're trying to do and what we're trying to speak on now i will not back up too much because the tapes are there if you want to hear them but this is message number 12. that we've been speaking on marriage and divorce in other words covering what a marriage is what a wedding marriages and things like that and then on the divorce situation of who can divorce for what reasons or whatever and we've been through that covering it and i will not back up other than make the statements uh jesus made it plain the only divorce could be made for a man was what that his wife was committed fornication adultery is the same word interchangeable all right fornication is technically a before marriage uh you know before becoming engaged because that's what we've covered what is a wedding an engagement when you ask a girl to marry you and she accepts you're married now we went through that brother and said it's not the preacher that marries you it's your vow you go to some of these foreign countries and they just talk to each other about getting married they come back later and lay down maybe a half a dozen cows or a couple of goats or something which we don't do that in america but i didn't have one daughter so that would have been all right i'd had to pay double for the other but for them see they just do and they just walk up and they don't necessarily have a preacher or whatever they just have a house and step over a stick and and they're just as married as anybody that went through a long lengthy ceremony why because you're married by your vows the bible says by your word shall be justified by your words you'll be condemned all right see then if we expect god to keep his word and we do don't we well he expects us to keep our word all right see then that that way it should be a settled fact to what we're doing when we see the man is not for just any cause he read that in the script jesus makes it plain he said there was not that for any cause because in the beginning it was just one man one woman and the prophet said in the end it'll wind up being that away because we're in the antetype we're not in typing we're in the antitype which means a fulfillment and see when jesus christ come and paid the price polygamists and things ended with the old testament form of doings and and as it did then you come into the new testament and you got one man one woman it's not to be you know one man a half dozen women or one woman the way it is today and i have a dozen men or something it's just getting all perverted but see we're we're talking about bible terminologies we're not talking about man and his ideas or what you think about it or what i think about it i don't give a hoot what you think but this word says and what it says that's what i'm going to say because it says then the man can only put away his wife for fornication i use the word adultery in there because the word adultery and fornication is the same word but then the bible says fear not to take told joseph fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife they were only a spouse right engaged the old testament if you as a spouse even under the law of polygamy i gave where the prophet covered it even under the law of polygamy under the old testament the prophet said if that boy asks that girl to marry him he doesn't keep his word and jumps over and marry somebody else he said he's committing adultery and said he's put out of the camp now that was his words because that's how strong it is it's just not a play party that the man is the hooty dude good guy you know he can do anything he wants to and get by but the girl can't no no it's plain about him so then you understand what i'm trying to say but now for the woman there is no grounds for a divorcement why because she was the one that brought the cause of the fall there's no ground her husband according to romans 7 will get to it this evening more her husband must be dead right see you can't you can't have two living husbands and be right all right see that was what the problem was the problem in the garden wasn't adam and a bunch of women because nobody there but eve but it was eve and adam plus the beast which was not a snake and it wasn't a hurry monkey it was what darwin couldn't find his missing link i mean it was one that could cross and the monkeys won't cross into the human race the beast was taken the bible says the serpent was the the beast was the most subtle serpent see went to the ground crawling on his belly from then on because of the fault all right just a few words to get a point to what we're talking about but we saw then man down through time then that every time you get together and you talk to people on religious matters the fact of marriage and divorce comes up just like we use darkness jesus see when it comes up the people want to talk about it you say but but brother dale that's just too hard we can't live according to that i'll agree with you i agree with you we can't we didn't so then it would be up to god to have to make a way it'd be up to him to have to make a way for us and he did but the way has to be made perfect now we'll get to that in a minute and it has to be lined up correctly all right we wound up speaking a couple of messages or have about three messages talking about the grace to be given about these marital situations that we have and it follows right through the scriptures and the things and we will review a little more this afternoon of just like rahab the harlot coming and marrying into an israeli general and from there came the lineage right down to boaz from boaz down to jesse and on down to david and all of the things and see god has made a way before on a lot of situations but we've got to go at it according to the scriptures we can't go at it because we believe it it's like i said the prophet of god stood there said in 64. he said i've got the scriptures on marriage and divorce he said but if i preach it it'll bust every church in the world and see he couldn't just because he knew that moses had given a grace and he knew paul had given the grace and he believed they would be one in the end time but you can't just walk out and say this is it unless you got something to put it on you could say well the end time was to get a message amen but if you and i don't believe that message don't believe that message is personal that's why i like that scripture it says behold i send you it didn't say everybody it said behold i send you elijah i'm that one that it was sent for amen that's the way i'm believing it i'm the only one in the building saved right right as far as i know that's right the rest of you got to sit there and say well he missed that because i'm the only one all right that's fine because we've got to make it personal that's the thing we got to do is keep everything lined up and make it something personal to us all right but see i preached the last message there a couple of them on trying to bring out some points of understanding that see grace has to be revealed all right the prophet of god said on marriage and divorce progress 272 that this grace had to be revealed all right it's not that you were even sitting there you could have been sitting there yourself you and your wife and all the problems yeah and then go back home in the same situation you went if you didn't believe it was revealed if you didn't believe as i said the basis if we don't believe that god sent a prophet in the last days i see the brother shakes his head a little bit so evidently he must be familiar with a little bit what we believe all right so we believe that god sent a prophet we don't believe that man was god no way that's antichrist but we believe that god used a man to bring a message to us all right we believe god is still using man to bring messages to us but it can't be brought contrary to that original one and that one took and turned us right back to the word amen all right now in the message you got people around the country said i'm to take over now well go follow it do what you want to constitution gives you a right to believe what you want to but the bible don't show me that in the bible all right now but getting on with the matter see grace must be revealed now and unless it's revealed you and i cannot stand on it and it's not like i told you and i don't the whole but the brother kind of got away from me one time when i said this is my revelation and he said i don't have a revelation my revelation is that brother branham had the revelation well i thought that sounded like he said the same thing i did you know i wasn't blinded on that part because he said he had a revelation i said i had one all right but the point is he said when the prophet said it that's the revelation now i don't agree with that what he said was already in this bible well then you'd be saying this is the revelation and that's true it is but it must be revealed to you and i am just because it said it doesn't make it right like the prophet always emphasized the bible said in one place judas went and hung himself take another scripture and said you go do likewise now what are you going to do you you got to get it together what it's talking about all right then when you get it together what it's talking about then you can understand now truly we know that these things of the end time was not to be made known down through time because man had taken god's word and so gotten away from the truth of it until when you come into the dark ages of martin luther and them that all god could do was take a man like martin luther which was a trinitarian you know said the jews ought to be taken out and be killed because he was a man he was just under the man time of the combat beast but yet he did preach that just shall live by faith and we believe that john wesley came along preaching sanctification i believe that pentecostals come along preaching the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts i believe that all right but see it was to come in the end time that this prophet he said wouldn't have no certain mystery but he would gather up all the mysteries of the entire bible well if we believe that's happened then we're here in the end time to be able to stand upon the word of god and say we've had a message all right now see it must be revealed the whole bible the prophet said on a message called patman's vision paragraph 69 the whole bible is a revelation it must be revealed if not we're just saying what somebody else said amen well the bible says this the prophet said eyes free and i believe it well amen if that's revealed to you right if not you're just saying what he's saying that's right if somebody else has got to tell you what you are then where's the personal revelation unto you it's wonderful for helps and things you know to tell us these things right but for me to just come up and say well brother branham said he saw me there all right and people lay on that well you better remember he went to both places and he saw people in the regions of the lost and he saw people in the regions of the blessed so now where did he see you at oh but brother you're just too negative no i'm positive you're the one's negative because you're not believing the word all right but now watch you remember how he's bringing out from patmos vision the prophet of god said you can only be saved by revelation you can't be saved by just intellectual understanding or thoughts or believing this and most of people say i know i'm saved because i believe god sent a prophet well now that's not what the bible says or even what you know the prophet of god said he said the only evidence really that you can link it on is whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word amen now you could put on everything believing god sent a prophet believing that this was right believing that was right like i say i believe martin luther when he preached to joshua lived by faith that was the bride of jesus christ in that day and that was all that was required so luther wasn't responsible for understanding about the jews and how they would come in and what was to be done he wasn't responsible about being because he was come up through under the trinitarian concept and he was he couldn't be held responsible for that but once truth comes we can't rely upon something that we believed like the prophet said mama might have told you that hell was eternal he said but we found out it's not eternal and see then that way we know that it's the truth will set us free all right so now watch so you can only be saved by revelation everything we get from god according to the scriptures must come by faith we must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him right now we don't believe that he was that won't save you come on he died for me but well all right if i didn't come up to where you're at then you're still back there talking about something somebody else said exactly all right what is the antichrist according to the little john's he that confesses that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god but he that says that he has not come in the flesh is the antichrist what come in your flesh come in you or right now the christ the new birth into our hearts and souls to set us free all right then the prophet of god went on to say it like this he said faith according to the rapture message progress 66 faith is a revelation something that's revealed unto you amen now just because it's revealed unto me don't make it revealed unto you i don't care how long you've been sitting here listening you need a revelation amen see that's as blunt as i can make it plain as i can make it but while the any problems with it because i say it don't mean that it's right but when somebody ever regardless if it's a dumb donkey in the bible you remember rebuked a prophet right you see saved his life amen all right but you see church we've got to base it there's got to be something personal to you and i not something we can talk about or or we believe it amen that's why we've been around here nearly 50 years since the death of the prophet what do you think all that's been for well just waiting on other people get lined up because i lined up start with you yeah okay okay but now listen see then whatever it would be whether it be grace for the salvation of the new birth which comes by grace by grace are you saved through faith that not of works lest any man should boast or whether it would be that we would talk about the grace of marriage and divorce that was brought in the last days unto us see that can only be brought unto us by revelation or else we're saying what somebody else said they remember in the scripture no man can call jesus the christ right what except it be by the holy ghost in other words something personal to you or if not you're quoting what somebody else says and no problem will quote what somebody else says right amen i'm glad we've got it i'm glad we got a bible right i mean i thank god for it and i'm glad it was brought down to us from not left in greek in in hebrews and and i mean it was brought down to where we could understand it you know all right and i thank god for that why because this bible is the revelation according to revelations 1 that i preached for what 90-something sermons and we read revelations 1 1-3 this is the revelation of jesus christ this bible the prophet's message that we claim to believe not the parts where he would say seven hundred or seven thousand or or you know be off of this or that or the other but the revelation of the word he said this part of this message is human right around made human mistakes that's why he wasn't god you can't find jesus making human mistakes because dumb people today are trying to say he did but that's all right let them stay on with their dumbness but you see we're trying to go on and not rest upon something like that if brother dale are you built on a man according to my bible paul said for you to say only what he said that's right paul said if you say anything contrary to what i say what did he say galatians 1 8 he said let you be accursed you see this can't be something contrary to what paul brought that's right it can't be something contrary to what moses brought come on you ever heard the prophet called moses said the ten commandments came he said the seals came down he could take the seals and put them right back in the old testament with the ten commandments by his help i can do a little of it not all the way through but i used to be able to preach pretty good out of the seals but that's been a long time ago you get over about seal number four or five you're going to find some great revelations of marriage and divorce right you bring in israel that don't even want to be saved right you need to get in the word and study it did not the prophet of god said that marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals is that not true yeah but that was 63. he didn't preach it till 65 that's right because he had to wait as i was saying a moment ago just because he could see moses had it just because he could see paul had it he couldn't walk out there and say i say unto you until god spoke to him personally it had to be a personal revelation look what peter had to say about it one day peter said i've been on the mountain go over in timothy and read it i believe this one is he said i've been on the mountain i was there and saw god come down he said but i have a more sure word of prophecy why because the baptism of the holy ghost came on the day of pentecost and he had something personal right how about you and i all right so let's get into the thought with it now go ahead with number one first peter 1 13 i wanted to start with this scripture because it's a beautiful scripture to me but look what it says wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ i love that then go over the book of revelation i said there was 1 3 i think it is where it says the revelation that god give to jesus to give to john this is the revelation of jesus christ this prophecies we'll get to it this afternoon prophecy a setting an order of scriptures surely we believe that god sent us a prophet to do those things right it's not you and i but what's the problem if i can find where the prophet said it why you want to get mad at me about it you know i've had people to get offended to me because i told them what brother branham said well i didn't say it he did why didn't they get offended at him oh no they're afraid to do that that's all right so truly then that there's to be a grace that is brought unto you and i went at the revelation of jesus christ not at the revelation of who we are that's good that's part of it but it's a revelation of jesus christ now put christ in you the hope of glory as paul said and now you've got it all back together in the right place but it's a personal revelation to you and i that's right not by what somebody's taught us but what god has revealed yes you remember i gave it to her the other day he said the scripture is what it is it's to be first revealed and it's been made manifest god doesn't require the word in in the basis until it's revealed amen right luther could be a trinitarian they went down through the ages teaching the trinity and god went right on saving them but then the bible said he come to a place that he would no longer wink at man's ignorance but would command all man to repent see in other words follow the truth that's right so we're in the end time we have no excuse anymore saying well i don't know and i don't want to get confused that's the big thing of the people of the message right they don't want to get confused i don't want to study those seals i might get confused i don't want to study on marriage and divorce i might get confused no what you're saying is you're already confused you don't want to be right but you don't want me to say it that way you don't want somebody to tell it to you like that you want to sugarcoat it make it sweet and nice i wish i could you know i mean i repent every night and i go home from preaching i repent for being so hard and sarcastic i do that every day because i know what i am but i know how hard it i try to make it that way the prophet said if i make it hard enough you won't think i'm trying to pull something over on you but you just sweet and humble and nice you don't know whether to tell you the truth or not at least you know what i believe how many of you come from the churches where you're at or in or whatever that you know what your pastor even preaches or did preach i've asked people personal questions that came here after we and your wife what did your pastor say about senator i don't know he never taught on it well what did he teach on you know come on all right all right see grace then for salvation of the soul must be accepted no brother dale grace is unmerited favor well that means everybody's saved and you got the devil's idea come on that's right mormon doctrine come on the mormon doctrine i've talked with them i know what it is the mormon doctrine was that the devil wanted to save everybody that's the mormon doctrine go ask him he wanted to save everybody was up in heaven wanted to come to earth and glorify our father and satan wanted to save everybody but jesus come up with a plan to just save so many and god accepted jesus's plan well i'd rather how the devil's that way you could save everybody right but you see we know that ain't true he paid the price for everybody right everybody in the world today has offered salvation seven billion people everybody in the world could be saved today if they do one thing what believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved because it's not just for a certain amount of people it's for them that will believe them that will receive it but it's a revelation you remember about abel we talked about the other night it was revealed unto abel that it was blood he had no bible to read he had no prophet's book to quote from he believed it by revelation but you know what cain believed his revelation he got it from somewhere maybe he listened to his mama a little wow come on because he had the point that it was works what did she have come on it's hard to preach because you you know one line try to go all right but now listen the grace of god is extended only to those who believe it we'll get to it in a minute where they declared what that a pardon is only a pardon if accepted as a pardon right that's right remember the man that was going to be shot and he got abraham lincoln the brother and man did and he signed the paper and he said i won't do it they shot him the next day all right well look what were they going to do they had a man killed with the words of abraham lincoln that he was pardoned so the the supreme court had to make a ruling they made a ruling a pardon's not a pardon unless received is one see then salvation is not for everybody because everybody won't receive it that's right and here's the worst problem is the biggest portion of the world today you would have to agree with this statement that the biggest portion of the world is deceived by the preachers into thinking about salvation and what it is would you go along with that not arguing with nobody just being telling it like it is or what i think you say yeah but brother dale they're preachers the bible says that they're as ministers of righteousness but they're satan's angels or ministers he's the one that started the deceiving part all right so then if we come down from the the grace of marriage and divorce we have to believe that has to be revealed and it's not just because you're born again that would make you right in your marriage and divorce situation we've been through that that's what a lot of people are trying to believe that's a good thought but it won't work why'd the prophet have to preach the grace of marriage and divorce if that was true that's right see why did paul have to preach about it if that's true why not just say you're born again it takes care of everything well you sure don't know a lot about the new birth i don't but i've experienced it so i ain't worried about the rest sure when it's all finished and we go out of here it's all based on that because remember i put a whole sermon in that if we don't have the new birth we cannot talk about the grace of marriage and divorce right the new birth is the first thing because we don't have the new birth we are sinners how can a sinner accept the word of god is not to a sinner the word of god is to the bride of jesus christ it only tells the sinner he's lost and see that's by people that's still telling him he's lost because that's who wrote the bible right all right now think about it a pardon go ahead and put up number one let's just take a few things a few quotes then we'll get down to our main point all right this is taken from the message pardon 1963 10 28 but we will take one thing that he has given us and that is pardon and i think that's a glorious word to be pardoned because we're all guilty of sin remember the bible said all have sinned and come short of the glory of god is that scripture no not brother dale i was so good what do you don't need a savior jesus christ died in vain as far as you're concerned we've all sinned and come short of the glory of god and god through his son has pardoned us from this guilt of iniquity and sin okay pull up the next one where we'll get the point this is the message behold greater than solomon is here 1963 1962 612. the court the federal court when the man was shot and all the things they had it there where that he actually lincoln signed the papers gave it to a man but it wasn't on this great big beautiful stationary you know so they wound up and shot the man the next morning because he wouldn't go free he wouldn't accept it so the supreme court made a decision or the federal court a pardon is not a pardon unless it is accepted as a pardon so that's the way god's word is right are you listening we just read that a pardon not a part but look that's the way god's word is right that's the way all the word is it's the word of god to all those who will accept it as the word of god if it's not well then it isn't so remember the point i started off talking about we've got to believe it's for us when you're talking about salvation of the soul or salvation of the grace of marriage and divorce or whatever you're talking about you're gonna have to believe it's for you because if you don't believe it's for you what good is it yeah but brother dale i sinned so much i'm glad you thought of that you know cause i wrote these down yesterday let's see if your thoughts are there yeah but what about is there any grace for me well i wrote these down yesterday all right so let's see if god could put it down here yesterday to tell you what your thinking us today not to try discernments and things like that because we don't need those parts we've got the word i believe in discernment i believe in those things because i believe in all the gifts and i believe sometimes god will give people as a preacher sometimes something before you get here right to be able to answer it see church we must accept the pardon of grace for the new birth for the soul and we must also accept the grace of marriage and divorce for the bodies the spirit the things that are left of us it must be accepted or it's no pardon we've got the papers in our hands we've got the bible we've got the prophet's message in our hands but what good is it in our hands is like blood if it's in your hand on your hands you got you've got a problem with it you better get it off the hands and into the heart right now that'll that'll save us all right but now watch this point we can say we have accepted his grace for the new birth of the soul but we've been so wrong or mixed up in these old bodies and things that we just can't accept the grace for the rest of us all right now so if you're sitting there thinking i'm too bad to do and i can't do this and i can't well then you let's just see if the lord let me write it down for you well you thought it this morning all right why would we think anything like that when the problem never begun in the bodies we've been through that even say accepted satan's lie in her spiritual being part of her her mind her spirit realm her reasoning factors or things and then that brought death right right it was not first the act and then you had to then she got to thinking about it you're all messed up a woman don't commit adultery doing that she first thinks it over right she first accepts a man in her mind then the body follows after that all right now why would we think on those things so let me write let me just see what it will wrote down remember the problem started in the soul because there is a place of unbelief for sin that's where your sin is from all right what are you saying i wouldn't save to do things well we'll get down to that in a minute so do we think that god can save the soul and make our wrongs all right you know can he save the soul and make our wrongs all right but we're bound by these old bodies in these marital situations meaning he would have enough grace to save the soul but he cannot save the rest of us what kind of god are you serving oh you said yes only for the believers okay we i've got that written down too so we'll just keep reading all right but do we think that god can save the soul make our wrongs all right but we're bound by these bodies in our marital situation god has extended the grace to us to the soul why can't we accept that he has extended it for the rest of us all right now i'm trying to preach grace not laying down sloppy grace greasy grace and ungrace and what kind of grace you want to call it i've we've done been through the scriptures all right we say but look at the mess i'm in in this fleshly part that i am look at the mass that i'm in but we still think that the mess of the soul was made all right what kind of a mess was we in before we received the new birth do you understand why i keep saying it you know that the the religious world and even some of the people in the message they believe that we're going to get a new body you know that it's not this body redeemed that we're going to get a new body well now i want that in the scriptures and i want the prophet's message when the prophet said if he drops a book you pick up the book you don't pick up something different jesus went down with nail prints in his hand and raised with nail prints in his hand now come on did he get a new body no he got his body redeemed well i can't understand that because got nail prints that's because of you and i to where we can eternity look at those things what he'd done for us i don't believe in eternity he'll have those erased it's for you and i to see and what it's we we made doubt i put them nail prints sorry what no roman it was my sins that held him to the cross see we can accept the grace of god for the soul but fail to accept it for the rest of us now god has provided the way that we can accept but it's just like a lot of people won't receive the baptism of the holy ghost why because number one they don't believe it's for them only they think it's a blanket blanket thrown out across the world to just anybody under there the bible said that he come to seek and save them to their lost i agree with you he wouldn't all be saved i agree with you the bible agrees with you but we know by his predestination we know that everybody won't be saved right because they won't accept it a pardon is not a pardon unless you accept it as one see now talking to people who claim the new birth but then wonder about the rest of them you know the rest of your being all right we don't believe in disgrace i don't put out where i stand so i don't have to worry about that anybody don't hear me say something they said well go back to please if you have any thoughts whatsoever and want to argue about it come and talk to me about it but go back and listen to what i've said what i've taught jesus said a man cannot divorce his wife except it be for fornication if he does he's committing adultery because she's going to marry again and he said a woman can never in no way whatsoever divorce her husband that's plain and blunt he's got to be dead and a man has got to marry a virgin i've been through that but how many of us you know thought about that when we were marrying or we just thought about the lust that was within us come on be human and sensible i talk plain and when i do people think i'm sarcastic or nasty you married first by lust the second time you might have got married by love you learned to love oh no it was love at first shot no it was lust brother dale you're just mean is it true you see church we just pity pattern play around instead of being straight and honest people think brother dale don't preach he don't preach like everybody else on women hiring clothes and dress no i just say it like this if you can't get right in your clothes and your hair and your dress you lost if the men can't get straight in the way they're supposed to be the loss but i don't preach on it every service run around him every service yeah he was preaching to the world all right now watch but we say look at what i have done is there any hope for me not if you will not accept it as being for you amen there is no hope for you if you want to accept it that's right people have come to me and come to this church and say brother dale i got this problem this and that and the other i said well sit down and listen to a while sit down and listen a while you might find out things are a whole lot different different what you think he said i don't listen to why because i thought we believe faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word now i thought we started off talking about faith as a revelation of god's will that was written in his word the prophet even there in 64 he said if you'll believe who i he said don't do nothing until you hear from me he's because they've been places made before for these things he had the scriptures but when he come out of there and said i say unto you that was thus saith the lord that was even greater than thus saith the lord you know the point of what i'm getting at paul didn't say thus saith the lord paul said i say that's stronger than thus saith the lord come on are we in the message everybody wants to get into these great third pools and say and you know uh paul said it's not the lord but i say that's pretty strong in it then turn around and say if you don't believe it the way i said it that's right let you be accursed that's right amen but we don't want to talk like that do we see we must believe that god died for us right to take our place yes the prophet of god said when a fall came he said god saw the mess with his end said he had to make a wave he's going to save us and said he did said he came himself to take our place well my god can't die well mine didn't die physically but the life left out of the body and went up i have no problem with that because this is what he said into thy hands i come in my spirit that body died that's right to take my place amen so i went to hell to make sure i didn't have to follow it dark all right but you see what i mean do you believe god has saved your soul amen by the new birth do you believe that you know if not the altar is open that's the one thing we need to get straight whether or not we're born again if we can't believe we're born again it's not even talking about the rest of the word of god it's not to us the bible is not written as head to the center it says to the saints at ephesus it doesn't say to the world it's not written to our world it's written to those that are in christ jesus because they're the only ones can understand it all right would you believe that god has saved your soul and that you have the new birth i'm asking you a personal question to everybody in here i can start the front nine nine nine take all day but get around every night do you really believe that you're born again if you're not that's the one thing you ought to be dealing with you don't have to worry about the rest of yourself the rest of yourself can be taken care of but if you don't believe you're born again that nothing can be taken care of so then the new birth as the prophet would say is the most important thing in your life if you're not satisfied with that then there's where you're hung out because there's no need of trying to deal with the flesh you can't straighten out we'll get to it on the invisible union where the prophet of god said she can be forgiven but can never be justified he said because she done it now we got to get in there and cover something on that then he turned around and said she's not only forgiven said she's justified he said the real you never did even do it we got a lot to call but think about it you realize that if god has set has accepted you and given you the new birth he has accepted your faith come on he's accepted your faith in him or else he would not give you the new birth you know do things haphazardly that's why a lot of people don't get the new birth one off they're not told by the preachers they need it oh we're in the message all you gotta do is believe the message well the devil believes it that makes him saved no you shouldn't be that away brother dale you should give us grace grace for what grace is a revelation of god's word grace is not your ideas or my ideals or opinions or thoughts or what grandma said her mama said i told you about it where my mom messed up my mom messed up telling my wife one day that daddy was 45 years old before he got married that's just plain there's 13 of us and i'm the 13th but there's reading the bible or studying it one day and mama said eve ate an apple he just laughed at her he said that wasn't an apple he told her what happened now my daddy wasn't no prophet i don't claim to be a prophet i ain't said nothing about that i'm saying he was just old enough and settled enough and an old man if you don't believe that old men and old people don't know a lot about it i invite you to go by the newsstand this afternoon and pick up you a playboy magazine they'll tell you in a hurry what happened in the garden even to the snake crawling around the women i've seen that on the pictures of them you remember the story i told you about it i said it to a little cubicle office for about 10 by 10 there planting a little wall on them you know i had a lot of time to study and to do things and i just kept all my books in my boston office and you know he was fine with me but boy told me that playboy magazine had an article on the pyramids of egypt say hey i'm studying on that would you mind getting me one i didn't want to go get one because i knew what everybody say oh look at the prey trick i don't think man on there but he brought it to me and i was sitting there reading it pretty good article on it you know guy comes over and looks down in there where i was at and he said uh-huh we caught the preacher he's reading the playboy magazine that black guy was named beck because he knows him brother didn't even know it he was hollering at everybody there was a white guy this black guy grabbed him and slammed him against the office so i didn't get up and argue with him because i wasn't going to work he slammed that guy against that office and he said let me tell you something i brought the book to him because he's studying on the pyramids of egypt and there's an article in there you know that nobody never said another word that's afraid to say anything because he told them what happened tell you something else he told tom tom asked him said you know sam daley said yeah he said what scale do you put sam dale on he said from one to a 10 said he's an 11. he was a great guy we had a lot of understanding a lot of talk no joke sitting on the table no wider than this one end of it i had the bible in books on the other end of it he had playboy magazine no joke i wouldn't i didn't care what he's written hey i'm a human i don't care what he's reading that didn't have to do with me pictures don't do no good except cause your problem but getting back to what dad was dad told my mother said i know what happened there so a little time went on we'd come on into the message and got come into it and my mom was talking to my wife again one day and she said i just don't believe that what y'all believe she said what said well what happened in the garden about eve having a relationship with that beast my wife told her said mom did you said that mr dale told you what happened mom never mentioned that again why because she was the one that trapped her own self you see plain common sense will tell you what happened in the garden you read in a newspaper and there's a man and woman put on an island and ain't nobody out there but a snake and he's a beast and she winds up pregnant and has two kids your papers will tell you exactly what happened well yeah we're so spiritual we don't want we don't want to talk about stuff like that it's true come on getting back to the point if we can't if we can believe that god saved the soul by the new birth that means he accepted your faith in him or he would not have saved you all right now you say well i don't know whether the grace of marriage enforces from me or not i never try to tell nobody who is far i tell you about it you must go before god and plead your own case i cannot plead your case to god and i will not tell you you're okay right i'll tell you to go before god and seek god for a revelation well i i think that the lord could forgive just a little bit but he can't forgive mine it's too big now you're not saved in the soul to start with because hey that's where my problem was at i don't know whether you believed it or not and my problem was that i was a self-righteous hypocrite i guess you'd go because you see i didn't drink smoke stuff like that quit all dating whatsoever over a year before i'd marry my i wife you about these things brother carly he kind of rebuked me one time because i was up here talking about it and i said as paul said i'm a chiefest of sinners and that's what i said i'm the chief of the sinners see paul was the closest to the truth he was a guy without a flaw in his life that's close i had flaws but you see i accepted him as my savior and it took me two years for that to come to pass i just accepted the lord and i got everything at one time i'm okay you start arguing about the word and i'll tell you you didn't get what you're talking about is that plain enough plain enough i'm running late but you see if we can accept salvation for our souls why can't we accept it for the body let me get this point and i'll just quit it you said well wait a minute brother dale said the grace of marriage and divorce we're quoting brother brown is for his followers only you remember that over and over now this is the point that i wrote down because it's what i want us to talk about we know that salvation is for everyone but everyone won't receive it is that true all right then if everyone now listen to me very carefully you on the internet listen don't quote me wrong say it the way i say it then if every one would receive the new birth come into this message proving that's a new birth because it will bring you into the message then that would mean everybody in the world would be following this message if they had the new birth you agree with that if you don't you got a problem you want me to state that again you say the greatest american divorce is only for the followers if you get everybody born again that means they're followers i don't know where i would divorce this evening but that's all right i can cough drop it enough and holler but you see if everybody get the new birth and hear of this message they would come in this message and they would be followers of the message which brother random say it was only for the jeffersonville group come on no he said it was those who follow in the message if you don't have the new birth you can't follow the message come on you can't follow the message if you don't have a new word you just line your clothes up get your hair dressed right but that don't mean you're saved the prophet said you can have your dresses dragging the ground you're hard dragging on top of that and still be lost he said don't say that's mates you say because it doesn't that is an attribute remember sin was not eve having a relationship with the beast sin was when eve received satan in her mind and paul said that i fear lest satan through his sentiment amen take you away from the revelation of the simplicity of jesus christ that's where you remember the lady brother random kept talking about said drinking is not a sin gambling is not a sin smoking not our sin adultery is not a sin the lady father pray tell me brother random what is sin he said it's unbelief there's only one sin it's unbelief that's what he's done in the garden she disbelieved god you know when the quote brought around he said he was messed up on hebrews 13 8. you need that quote because she couldn't see that he was the same yesterday today and forever or she would have done what she done you should have seen it that way you see the point i'm trying to get us to if everybody would receive the new birth everybody would be followers of the message come on you mean god has made a way but you know you mean brother dale i've got to accept it yes it's not a pardon listen but russ said if you can't believe this is from fellowship don't pull these up going down to go to number six and number seven all right get these on the screen and i'll just quote these up e30 of the fellowship 55 8 13 brought around says you can't believe he said no wonder says you've never been born again all right that's what he said jesus calling jesus on the scene go ahead with number six numbers 14. because grace said you must accept it now the children of israel got into trouble and got to cadence barnea now this is not where he says blot out my name you know out of the book that's over in exodus and numbers they've gotten in trouble and as they'd gotten in trouble there moses stood before them and said lord if you read back up above him he said lord i said if you don't take these people in because he god said just separate yourself i'll just kill every one of them he said if you don't take these in lord said it'll be said that you could bring them out but couldn't take them in now that's before this so what did he say now go ahead going up number six all right number 14 19-20 this is moses pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt until now back up before the industry you read it he's talking about that they he said god brought them out but can't take them in he said now lord don't let your enemies say that in other words it's going to be out fighting against them all the time well look look what the lord the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word now you think moses didn't give a grace i have pardoned according to thy word isaiah 55 and 7. i didn't give him that but he says he will abundantly pardon pardoned do we have the new birth if we have the new birth then we're pardoned there can't be any marks left against your soul and you call it you know if you have the new birth because that would be satan living inside of you but we have these bodies in spirit realm of us that are causing us problems but if we can't believe god made our soul free how can we believe he made the body free but if we can believe he made the soul free then there's hope there is hope only if you can believe it are you offering a grace do i blanket no i'm not offering anything because i don't have it i didn't stand there and say tell them to go on as they are that was brother branham now i do have the scriptures i do have the prophet's message that can show that we're in certain ways things are covered how did ray have the harlot come in and marry an israeli general and wind up coming from there with jesse and boaz in them somebody had some grace somewhere somebody had some understanding of god somewhere you think about a clone musician you just think about it moses he'd been in the presence of god so many times and he knew that nothing could stand in his presence and things like that he knew those things right but he knew that if he could in some way he knew that it had been done before who was it was it abraham dealing with god and said if there's 50 down there everywhere it was in the bible you put the one supposed to be he said face 50 down there will you spare him he said i'll spare him for 50. he got thinking about it hey i probably can't find 50. that's going to be a bad number he said lord if he's 40 lord said okay that's 40. if it's 30 okay if it's 30. he wound up and said if it's 10. well she wasn't 10 because you only got lot and his wife and a couple of kids right so there wasn't 10 of them down here but still god said yes for 10 i'll do it listen folks why can't we believe in the grace of god now remember one thing brother dale preaches is straight honest and flat grace does not cover future things if you're thinking that away grace covers the past there is no grace for a future that's catholicism that's the catholic church who sold the right to go out and do what you wanted to and pay for it before you ever started that's wrong grace is for the past well i'll go out and and i'll go get married and then i'll come back tell brother dale you come back tell brother daley don't tell you you're wrong if you'd already went through something like that me and you might be able to talk some ways but not grace is not for future sins there is no such thing in the bible grace is for the past pardon is a pardon unless received is not a pardon unless received as a pardon the pardon meant the man had done done what he done how about it have we been pardoned but yeah we like to make talks of the man that put out the movie no pardon twice you know he's pardoned from sin or then and brought then he was pardoned out of prison that's a wonderful story but you see church i don't care about getting out of prison he said well that was good to get out that's good to get out that was that would go to some governor or somebody to sign him out that's fine that was good but you let me be pardoned once i want to praise the glory of god whether i'm in jail or out of jail amen where i'm at let me praise god let me be like brother louis over in jamaica they locked him up for a false thing because the they just couldn't handle a case right then on a friday and if somebody else had done something wrong they talked to brother lewis up he's a preacher over jamaica well he gets in there and he gets to preaching to them old sinners and prisoners that as mean as a rattlesnake and kill at the drop of a hat and he got to get them converted and through the weekend they wound up and they had all that rhaegar hair and all that stuff and and they go get the guard to go get a barber and get the guard it comes in he's cutting them god's hair off and everything's happening he's the only fellow they know of in jamaica has ever been invited to come back to a jail they let him out on monday because they don't you know he wasn't guilty somebody else that was guilty about a parts or something had been stolen what's he don't that sound like paul wherever you're at just preach might find somebody in there that needs it right i love to hunt but i'd rather talk about the lord you know go ahead brother what do we got let's stand 2 11 let's just sing a minute if anybody has a what need the grace he was you get anybody else it's what you believe see we've been taught all of our life that we're so messed up well i agree with the devil we're all messed up but he can't agree with me that said jesus christ has made a way but if you can believe it if you can believe it all things are possible to them that believe yeah but look what that's what happened i've done this i've done that i've done this are you saying that he's capable of saving your soul because you've done this done that doesn't have done that but he could save your soul but he can't make possible other things you know marriage and divorce is not the unforgivable sin the unforgivable sin is the blasphemy of the holy ghost when you turn down what god had brought be careful you can blaspheme he that the son is set free it's free indeed if we believe it pardon not a pardon unless we receive it as a pardon what about it anybody else foreign morning brother bob watch and pray finding me thine all in all jesus paid it all to him i owe lord no matter what it is or to anybody let us be what you want us anybody he's coming let's believe in the blood in jesus name we just ask you to come to our little sister and be unto her what her needs is whatever it would be for somebody else no lord let her be what you wanted to be in jesus name just accept it anybody else think about it a pardon is not a pardon unless received is one amen father we thank you for this day and we ask you now to go with us as we eat a natural meal bring us back together this afternoon in you lord and just bless each one we love you and we thank you we ask you again lord to be brother rocky there lord and we try to find out something between the services about him lord but we believe that you're going to make all things well no matter what we're going to
