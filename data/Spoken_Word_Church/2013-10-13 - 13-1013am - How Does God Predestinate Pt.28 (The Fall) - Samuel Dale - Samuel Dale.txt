is over at brother Dutch is for preaching this morning so remember them and as they traveling they and back Romans 8 2 Corinthians 11 Heavenly Father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you for being you and revealing yourself unto us and we pray that you would just guide us now as we attempt to speak about you and that your love and understanding would be each with each and every one of us bless those that are not here remember the sick among us you sense your word you and healed us and delivered from destruction so we believe you we just ask you now to have your way with each one of us and teach us to wait Lord upon you because in waiting we can trly come to a place of patience and we need that so much forgive our sins as we keep saying unto you because we want to be clean and left in you as white guide us now and keep us in Jesus name amen Romans 8 we've read this scripture now 28 times so you ought to know it by heart but uh we just keep on going and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things all of that's right what can we say if God be for us who can be against us right so let's turn over to um 2 Corinthians 11 beginning with verse one would to God you could bear you could bear with me a little while in my Folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espouse you to one husband that I might present you as a Chase virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I keep saying we're and we read there in Romans all the time about the the predestination and uh knowing that now in our studies we've got over far enough that we can talk about as we did this past Wednesday about predestination and how that you know we're getting down to the uh Garden of Eden the time of man the creation and things and we can can talk about those things that uh you know are pertaining unto us and we can see then that God does predestinate but how does he predestinate he said he predestinated by for knowledge all right so that's simple for knowledge is God knowing before what would take place upon Earth and if he doesn't know that then why worry about worshiping him what kind of a god do you think you're serving if you if you can't put it all to confidence in him to know all things before the world would ever begin you know and all of that then why would you worry and be in any form or concerned about uh life just go on eat drink and be merried because tomorrow you die but I believe that God who knows all things could before the world look down through time and see who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved so he could predestinate by his full knowledge right then we've covered over and over how that that the the prophet of God covering the message of showing us that for knowledge comes first God doesn't predestinate by his desires because he desired that everybody be saved all right so for knowledge comes before predestination then that way predestination is not a bad word because predestination is Destiny determined beforehand all right looking at it that way we can see that there is nothing happens without God knowing it my way of expressing it is kind of carnal but it gets to point across but see God he never had to go to the moon and be on the moon CU it wouldn't anybody up there but when man first traveled there and back then his journey was there and back with them to record that because that would make him having all of it but he knew before the world what we would be doing in this end time and and and the way things would be all right but then this past Wednesday we got down to coming to the Garden of Eden and talking about what would be happening in the Garden of Eden and then we we picked up to the point that if we can look at something to happen or going on then we can cover predestination we can talk about God forne all things we can see that he did and that he had everything ready you know before mankind came he also had the the point is we was trying to bring out Wednesday he also had the part that uh we don't like to talk about would be the Fallen condition of mankind he knew that if he made Satan Lucifer son of the morning is who he made he knew if he made him that he'd fall he said well then what he do he permitted it to be that way he didn't make him that way he makes no one wrong that's right right we make ourselves wrong that's right see we are the ones when we come to a time of called free moral agency coming to a time of age of accountability uh whatever the words you want to use uh we come to the places that we can start making our own choice and that's where the problem is is when we choose because we a lot of times we choose as as we covered Wednesday we choose off of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and and it is a knowledge of Good and Evil it's enough good to be good you know but then it'll be evil to go with it you know I appreciate as I always say I appreciate riding to to church in a in a car I don't want to ride in a wagon and M and wagon you know I appreciate but yet there's more people killed with cars every year than killed in a war so what have we made we've ate off the tree of knowledge and wound up being a scientific world but it's killing everything you know and and and doing that then we don't want to keep eating off of that tree we want to get on to the tree of life because we covered there in Genesis where it talks about there was two trees in the garden one was a tree of life the other one was a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all right now then knowing that God didn't just put those things there by accident you know and why would be he be so specific as to speaking of of calling them trees because in the Bible we we read there you know and talking about in the scriptures where I believe it was balum he called man trees we see we know that because we know that that John was said about him said the ax was laid at the FR at the root of the tree he wasn't talking about cutting down the timber he was talking about the Pharisees and Sadducees the religious leaders of that day all right then man is referred to in the Bible as trees you know walking as as being those trees all right then we know that the tree of life would have to be Jesus Christ all right that's simple that's that's no problem to comprehend a tree of life because Jesus said that he was that tree or he was the bread that came down in the wilderness he was the life so there'd be no problem considering the tree of life being there but who is this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now if the tree of life was a person which was Christ then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil would be a person also and that was the person of Satan in his Fallen condition we call him the devil Satan uh he's called many things in the in the scripture and he's called to actually started out as being the anointed cherub he was created perfect in his creation but then he went in his own reasoning because he was given the ability to reason right all right and that ability to reason would make him fall okay now see then he comes to the garden and what does he do what is the first thing he does we'll get more on this afternoon of picking up the point uh of of what took place in the garden and uh I tell you right up front I don't believe they ate an apple and found out they were naked I just never have you know what about 50 years now I haven't believed that uh because if apples make you know your naked then we'll we'll just plant a bunch of apple trees but that's not what lets you know you're naked it's the it's the other parts and all you say well what happened in the garden we we'll get back more on that this afternoon because we've got to see first what happens in the spiritual realm right before the Physical Realm comes into being see and that's way most people would just cover you your physical happening and and tell you this happened and that happened and and all like that but I will tell you this much as I said Wednesday night if man had had have even listened to the Bible in in a sensible way then Darwin wouldn't have had his problem and I'm glad he didn't because it might have caused a lot of other trouble but you remember Darwin brought up the theory of evolution and it this animal evolved Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher and he came to the monkey but when he got to the monkey he couldn't get between the man and the monkey because he could not get the relationship to connect between those two but if he went back in the garden and read there in the Bible he would have found the Bible said that the serpent was the most subst of all Beast right a beast is an upright creature a serpent is a snake or a lizard formed crawling on the ground and if it if Darwin would just known that and remember that Beast could talk it talked to Eve all right so it was not just uh you know some form of doing but the main guy that I want you to deal with we'll get to that this afternoon but the main part I want to deal with is that Satan what caused him to fall he became exalted within his own thinking you would have to say that and he said I'll extend above the clouds I'll be like the most high see he wanted the the he had the ability in heaven to control a lot of things in his creation but then when he was cast out he came to Earth and in that he's began to try to get us to do the same thing that he did is to do what reason reason out things well brother Dale don't you think that it's that it's all right to reason yeah if it's according to the word right cuz the Bible said come let us reason together though your sins be as Scarlet there'll be white as snow that's fine reasoning is fine if it's based upon the word but when it gets off the word we get into our own reasonings all right Satan became exalted in his own thinking and he wanted to take over heaven so what did he do he went out and he be to talk to the angels and the Bible says a third heard of him listen to his reasoning that's right and what was that reasoning about he was trying to show those angels his knowledge his understanding his great wisdom right and and he did he had a great understanding right because of being there when God created the world and and all of the things and and is the prophet said one day he had a knowledge of the principles of life so he knew what was going on on Earth and how it was brought down and and go look at your scientific side of mankind and you'll see that it's constantly in the form of reasoning it says there in Genesis the imagination of man's mind is continually evil now where did he get that from where did he get the evilness from why did it wind up to be that Cain and Abel would be in the garden and they both come to a worship time you've read that in the scriptures you ain't go over to Genesis 1 2 3 4 and all through there and read it and you find that Cain offered his beautiful offering of the flowers the Earth the things and Abel offered the blood of a lamb well Cain got mad right and he wind up killing able the first murder was caused by reasoning knowledge Satan wanted to inroad into Mankind and he got an inroad as we'll get to in a little bit and that inroad is still here today that's why I read that in in Corinthians there Wednesday and read it again today is that Paul would say that let Satan through his subtility deceive us like he did Eve all right so now it had to begin in the garden in some way that would tie together in what Paul is covering and if we'll look at it correctly we'll see but if you you're following the point now now so here in the garden you you see the situation you see Adam and Eve and you see the animals you see everything in perfect order all right and then when you do you see that there's a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and all at once this Beast upright creature not a monkey dragging his knuckles or a snake crawling on the ground he was made a snake read your Bible off that off your your legs will come off and you'll be on your bedet crawling so he must have walked some other way but he began to talk to Eve he began to reason with her and that was her problem was listening to her reasoning all right you see that's the worst thing in the world but the greatest thing could ever be thought of too as I said on one side if we reason we're like Eve we fall but on the other side God says come let us reason all right as long as we stay on the tree of life which is the word of God we can talk about those things study those things out and all but when we get over onto the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil we wind up like mankind is today and and the world you know and all of the things it's so scientific until you know it's just almost uh unbelievable what mankind can do you know he he he can take you in now and lay you on a bed take this machine and run over you and it just covers everything and and shows every little flaw you've got and and and every little bump you got inside of you or any kind of a a of of a cancer or anything you know that they can just view the whole body you know it's amazing all right but now listen this comes from the Tree of knowledge that we've grown used to all right but in the garden as are saying Wednesday you had the tree of life and the tree of knowledge so it was told at Eve as we'll get back this afternoon that you know Adam and Eve you can eat of every tree in the garden but you can't eat of that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all right so they were able even to eat of the tree of life because Adam's youth was continually being renewed each day you know his body was not Eternal his his soul is was eternal because God breathed into his nostril he became a living Soul all right but then as we see it we look at that tree there and we see if the tree of life is Jesus Christ and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil would be Satan and the scripture says there in Ezekiel said talks about the devil and said you was in the garden all right now so now we're watching it come to the point of seeing life and that's what we want to look at this morning to look at life and see it in the correct order because right up here in this part we call the brain the head that's our trouble that's the Avenue that Satan can use to talk to you and I he could even use that to talk to Jesus out there in the desert because he can enter through that realm of reasoning and to try to get us to think about things you ever heard the old isn't it reasonable well that's a good point but most of the time when you say isn't it reasonable is you're going contrary to what is reasonable right you're going to turn away from something that's reasonable to being something that you're reasoning out yourself okay so now think about it we won't cover much about it but Adam in his condition he would not listen to Satan in history of knowledge but Eve did she listened to him all right see Adam was the original creation but Eve was in Adam right and she was taken from Adam if you read your Bible and made him a help meet all right and when you see him then coming into being you see Adam as being the original creation back to Genesis studied a little bit he made male and female he made the dog he made the cat made the horses made the animals you know male and female but then when he come to Adam he only just made a man but he made him male and female that's your Bible read it and when he did he took that feminist part out of Adam and and made Eve so she was not in the original Creation in physical form as the animals were but she was in Adam that was a beautiful place for her to be and as long as she had stayed with what was right there wouldn't have been any trouble because her spiritual being her soul was in Adam all right the prophet says even her theophan soul was in Adam all right now but her physical body was not a body running around inside of Adam it just simply is explaining it so he took a rib from Adam and he made Eve and when he made Eve a free moral agent made Adam one all so remember we don't blame e for everything the Adam of Bible says in Adam all die so you'll find out we had to take our part too all right but now knowing it see we can watch it unfold in the garden what God is doing and how that his original creation can't go wrong you look out at the animals you see them still just like they've always always been male and female but yet because of the Fall you wind up with a with a a polygamy point that come into view and then you wind up with one buck and many Do's but that's still original because of the way they were brought but Eve was made not in an original condition but being in Adam then when she was taken from Adam and her spiritual being taken from Adam and placed within the body she became her own identity person whatever you want to call it but yet when Satan begin to talk to her to bring his knowledge she accepted that knowledge and that's where the trouble is today we hang on the tree of knowledge amen now that's why you have Bible schools that's why you have over a thousand different denominations and beliefs that's why you have close to that many and what's called end time message people you know different ideas and opinions is because of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now there wouldn't be but one B one uh church if everybody had the same understanding right that's right but by God permitting us to be able to reason things out then we would wind up being to where we would take our own thoughts instead of God's word all right and doing that then it would cause many many churches to come into being that would differ with each other and we all claim to be going to the same Heaven you know but I guess when we get up there there's going to be a little place for this group and a little place for that one I don't think so but I'm not concerned about that what I'm concerned about is what we read that Satan through his subtility would be able to do in the end time the same thing especially here in the end of it all that he started out in the garden by getting people to reason trying to reason it out we'll say I think right well it's okay if it's according to the word but when we say I think and it doesn't line up with the word then we already to know what tree we're eating off of right because the tree of life there's only one tree of life and that's Jesus Christ there's only one word of God but mankind has Twisted it into every form it could be thought of until now you you you know people can't even hardly trust the reading of the Bible why because they got their own ideas I think see now you show me where we got a right to think you said but now wait a minute now we're supposed to be no Christians have no rights whatsoever right we give up our rights to accept Jesus Christ am our rights and our things is our problems because that's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's come by Satan talking to you and I you say well he's not too powerful he can't well he was powerful enough till he offered Jesus the whole world and all of the governments and the things and he said I'll give it to you if you fall down worship me that's right well see then off of that tree of knowledge God knew that if he gave us the ability he knew first as I said Wednesday if he gave Satan the ability Satan would fall for it if he gave him free moral agency he'd fall for it he knew if we were placed on free moral agency we would fall for it because we begin to reason and can't you see that beautiful little girl walking around in the garden you know what about a beautiful place a Utopia you you know or something you'd call it no problems no the animals were there no problems dinosaurs were in the garden you cannot annihilate those things because they got enough bones to put together to show you they were somewhere all right so all of that was there but no problem the line was there the tiger was there the bar was there but there was no problem why because sin had not come into being all right but what about a beautiful little girl that's that said she's in the garden and you know her and Adam and they're having a wonderful time cuz time is not counted back there so they wouldn't aging they wouldn't go older you know they were just having a good time but yet here come the devil Satan and he begins to try to get to Eve cuz he knows he can't get Adam but he gets to Eve and he begins to get her to reason don't you think and what if she said now she done a good job she told him that we're able to eat of every tree that's in the garden we said we're not able to eat off that tree of knowledge like I said we get to it more this afternoon but that's a funny looking tree I I've never seen an apple tree where it said underneath the bottom of it a sign and said this is the tree of knowledge if you you get a belly a from eating apples you don't get knowledge all right and see then when you come down to it then that tree of knowledge was Satan reasoning with Eve and she began to listen to him she began to take what he was saying and he was telling her said you can do this you she said no no no no as long as she stayed with that word everything was okay so she started out telling him no no no we can't do this we can eat of every tree in the Garden but this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil we can't eat of that because we do God has said we'll die well all satan said was is you shall not surely die right right just a little simple point that he brought in and she began to reason she began to listen to what he was saying how far how far off are we today in our listening it wouldn't be any problem preaching if everybody had the same thoughts that's right but we're human beings we're permitted to the right to think I said permitted God allowed us to think out things but see what does the word say if the word says that there's one God then where would we have any right to think about well I think it's a trinity now that's the devil's lie cuz there's no Trinity in the Bible it's not there it's not nothing but yet we think that we have a right right to reason things out see that's what what happened in the garden when you come to Cain and Abel Cain reasoned it out he thought mama ate an apple or fruit or some form so he works like everything a good man worked day in and day out and raised a garden a crop trees of you know and he brought an offering that was beautiful and God rejected it and they said well to go then he gets all mad because Abel tells him said now listen mom and daddy didn't eat no apple said you're born in your blood from your Mom and Daddy's blood blood coming from the daddy said you're born that way well Kain just got all tore up about it if you want to get people upset with you cross their Doctrine right just cross what they think and you'll see them raise up yeah but and then they'll say to you know you do to me I know I I don't have to have discernment I read I look at faces enough a lot of times here and say he's saying I don't agree with that well come and show me where I'm off the word and if I ain't off the word then what right are you got to think any other way right that's why I preach as hard as I do with a challenge to you if you can see see that I'm off the word come to me and tell me about it don't go tell everybody else cuz I ain't helping nothing all right but even she begins to reason and in her reasoning doing it put a situation into mankind that we say is lost or situation no you know and if we keep on reasoning folks those say goes we going to die right I mean that's just plain language right we going to die why because we're still eating off that tree of knowledge right but if we lay that down and take the word of God yes sir now I've never been one that tried to make you believe anything I've never been one to even try to make my wife or my kids uh grandkids and great grandkids coming on now I've never tried to make you believe anything all I've asked you to do is just pray am and read your Bible right and see what it says right if I tell you what it says then there's no problem with it right now if I lie to you but you see that's up to you I I've never worried about preaching because of one thing it's up to you to keep your end of the line straight you can reason all you want too but you better remember one thing you're going to have to come back to the word see wasn't it reasonable there in the garden I mean there in the The Temptations of the Lord Jesus he said make these stones to bread you're hungry that was reasonable cuz he was he told him said get behind me why because he was getting all for the thing he could have turned that stones into bread but yet he wouldn't go to let it be a reasonable Factor he said it is written Now Eve told the Beast the serpent the snake the things you want to call it whatever you want to bring it he could talk and it did Eve told him said we can't eat of that tree if we do we'll die Satan through his subtility begin to talk to her and say now God loves you you he's not going to kill you you know no no no he's not going to do that he's going to he he loves you too much to do but yet he did she did die all right reasonable factors see we go back and learn reason it says the day you eat thereof that day you'll die well she ate and the devil said see you're not dead right that added more reasoning to her reasoning said you're not dead but see the Bible says a th000 years the day and the day is a th years no man's ever lived the oldest man is meusel 969 years all right no man's ever lived to be a thousand years old yet all right see then we reason Eve could reason and say but I didn't die I ate it I didn't die Adam said eve you're wrong to do that I didn't die see there's reasoning without taking the Bible to be the answer to all things right we want to reason it upon our abilities to think things out to make it look more beautiful right you see Satan's approach to Eve was through the ability to get her to reason get her to think about some things all right now let's just read a little bit we believe God sent a prophet but I make it plain to you I always make it plain to everybody I don't believe the man was God right right no don't believe that we don't have no such thing but yet there is followers of this message around the country that believe he's God well he died so that order took all that out but that's all right he got killed and a car wrecked but that didn't solve that they're still believing it why because they're still eating off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil all right we believe that God was promised in his word to send us a prophet Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 days are the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mysteries of God would be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets I believe that but I also believe one thing that I wish I could talk to everybody that claims to be the followers of the message about it it's fine to say what brother Brown said but you could kill yourself doing that I'm going to show it in just a minute here in the quote because you reason out what he's saying and you're going to die why because he was a human mortal that spoke as human Mortals but yet the message he brought is perfect but yet the human man himself was not the message he brought to us I wanted i' I've spent all of my time almost 50 years now showing people to where the things are not incorrect we just need to wait a little while amen and God will reveal it to us all right but you see then by sin originating in or Heaven as we call it Satan in his disbelieving when he came down he started get Eve to disbelieve and when he did he brought her to a state and I want you to think about it not just women now but I want you to think about all mankind see one when truth is presented to you what is the first reaction when truth is presented to you what's your first reaction I don't believe that that's right right that's right why because the word of God is not the tree of knowledge as I said you go in the Bible and you find out knowledge is only used where it says knowledge puffeth up but you look the rest of it up and run the word knowledge it has a lot of good meaning to it why because we need the knowledge of God we need understanding of God we need the truth but think about it now in your own Sal what's the first thing that happens when somebody presents something to you that you're not accustomed to you haven't heard it I don't believe that right I mean we all done it come on but see then after a while you begin to read and you begin to see hey that's true but yet still in the human mind see God lives in a realm called faith we live in a realm called reality the Bible said it was revealed unto Abel all right but it doesn't say it was revealed under Cain there's a lot of difference in a revelation and a natural head knowledge all right so then when it comes down that we see Mankind in the way he's made and what he is as I said to start with then your battle starts right here now irregardless of what you think about how great a revelation you got remember it started in your head no it was in my heart how did it get there the Bible says faith cometh by what hearing and hearing by the word of God so it's the best to go back somebody talks to you about something and you you look at it and you say well I don't see that well I don't just throw it away take it and sit down and read you know and the basic thing too is to ask somebody said well where's it in the Bible Well I I can't find it but it's in there well you might have the wrong idea too you know what get a Bible and start reading it that's why I love for people to read the scriptures I love for you to read the Bible cuz in that you'll find a lot of things but you see just to look at a natural person that's why that we've covered it when God made the animals and things see the animal has a spiritual part of his life he can do certain amount of reasonings Etc but he still goes right on building the same bird nest that he built 4,000 6,000 years ago it doesn't change we mankind have taken them and got dogs to talk and horses to count and everything else but pigs to run to the right stall but it's all on account of feeding and petting and and stuff like that that you train them uh you can't just walk up to a dog and say hello dog how you doing well ain't you going to talk to me no they can't do that that's the part of the human being that were that what man has a soul within him and that soul is the is the ability to do a lot of things look at mankind as I said a while ago and what they've done with the fact of being able to think things out see I talk to the soul of the individuals not to your body and your spirit because your body and your spirit is that's just part of you but the real part is the inward part of you whether you're saved or lost the Soul at in the individual is the real you but yet let's look at a Mankind and see what he is go ahead pull up number seven brother uh Anderson glad to have brother Anderson back he was out in California for a while and uh we missed him done a lot of juggling to the books in the back room to get everything to where they could run their internet system but look at number seven I'd invite you to read the message called the greatest battle ever fought over and over and over and over and over and then read it again right because that's what I do with the Bible but let's think about Mankind now now to see what approach Satan can use upon you and I and it's used the seventh grade education man to explain it to us all right let's look at paragraph 68 when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battle Ground begins in the human mind the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was began and that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head all right now the mind the head I like the way the prophet will explain things because we use the words as we want to and when he'll say something he'll say the mind we see a lot of people Jo I got the mind of Christ well you don't have have the mind of Christ if you're not born again and you still don't have the head of Christ you can call old head you want to and say he's my head all you want to but that old head of your still running like mine right it's a bunch of garbage can your human brain ain't nothing but a uh highly Technical Machine anyway because it it's just the greatest computer could ever be as a human brain CU it never been a computer if it have been a human brain for for it to work with all right but think about it now to see ision are made in the mind so where did he attack Eve with reasoning in her mind her head all right now being the head part let's go on down this little bit brother go on paragraph 72 cuz I like the way a simple terminology man can explain things really don't know Bring It On Up paragraph 72 number eight all right now if you'll sit down when you get home and you draw three little rings you'll find out that the outside body has five senses is contacted by that c taste feel smelling here that's your body see you you got that to contact the world all right that's the five senses that controls the human body all right now what's inside of the body is a soul and we're going to show something in a minute so hold on to that all right and that soul is controlled by the second realm of man is controlled by what imagination conscience memory reason affections so you don't love with your body you display love with your body you love with your spirit all right now now but the spirit is only has one sense the spirit let's get it the spirit has one sense and that sense is either dominates it is Faith or doubt all right that's exactly there's only one Avenue to it that's free moral agency you can accept doubt or you can accept Faith either one you want to therefore Satan begin at the principle part to cause the spirit of man to doubt God's word God begins to get a to straighten it up all right the three Realms of man outside body C taste feel smelling here inside of the man in the second realm is memory reason conscience factions imaginations Etc right second real of man the Third Realm of man is the center part of you and I which is either Faith or doubt if we're lost it's doubt if we're born again it's Faith right if you're saved it's faith if you're lost it's doubt so that's the the reasoning factors are part of mankind now to just show you how that even we are let's bring some something up right here because as I said Satan tries to get us to reason that's his ability is to make us reason you say I don't reason brother Dale I live by faith well pray for the rest of the world cuz you're the only one that's doing that rest of the worlds living in a realm here that we live every day you know every day we live off of sea taste Feld smell in here right that's your contact that's what you're doing right now the second realm of the individual is memory reason conscience affections and things and in that is where that we start our part of understanding but then there's a realm of mankind which is the center realm that as I said has Faith or doubt out to it one or the other it's it'll dominate us it's Faith or doubt all right see Satan can get us to reason where's that at you don't reason with your brain your brain is I said just a highly mechanized computer system of a bunch of cells and things that don't ask me how it works and science don't even know that works but they still know it works I know it works too cuz I'm looking at it all right see Tes field smelling here is just your Earthly realm well Satan didn't have to bother with that that came later as to the body bringing into being the things he went straight to the second real of mankind which is memory reason conscious affections Etc and he began to try to get Eve to reason as he did he he got contact with her all right it's impossible to do wrong with a body the Bible says a body is without the spirit is dead that's right right I mean this body you say well you know my body I do no you don't love with your body you display love with your body amen you got to love with the second realm which is the spirit realm of mankind are the reasoning factors all right if not then why is it that you hit a man in the head and the body's paralyze and that takes care of him he's laying there totally paralyzed can't do anything right but he can still think his memory reason conscious and things is still working right see there's where Satan attacks he attacks in that second real of mankind to get us to reason upon the word of God that's right but yet is the same thing as I've said that we when somebody contacts us we say they present something to us we don't have understood before haven't seen before a new doctrine his man would say we say well I don't believe that but how come it is after a while something that I said you begin to read for yourself that's right and study and think it out and as you do you come to a place that you say well you know there's no other way it can be than what that brother told me you know I mean he told me the right way to be baptized is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said all of my life we've been taught it was Father Son and Holy Ghost see but that's reasoning cuz I can show you in your encyclopedia just go home and read it you show me in the Bible anywhere that anybody was baptized father son Holy Ghost I've offered $110,000 for that you say you're a smart e no I ain't a smart etic I'm sincere my whole life is built on whether the word of God is true or not amen I don't know what you think that's right and if it's true I want everything put behind it right but you see in the Bible they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ or Lord Jesus Christ the Catholic Church came along and about 3:25 ad they begin to talk about it it developed by 606 that's in your history at the Nan Council they begin to get the mood of baptism to Father Son and Holy Ghost right we're not the only group of people in the end time that baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you got a lot of Pentecostal people today or has been doing that ever since back in the in the beginnings that back in the 30s and all the 40s they become to developing from the Oneness idea coming on over to the uh some of the other churches and they baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're not the only little group of people there's plenty of people out there in denominational churches that's been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but most of them are baptized father son Holy Ghost why because they reasoned it out but the words tell us what to do see if we're reasoning then it's not according to God's word so since somebody present something to you you say well I don't I don't I don't believe that but then you go read a while and then something happens and you say well you know irregardless of what I think about those people you know they're telling me the truth right see you've got into the reasoning factors you got into the ability to think things out for yourself but most people you know they say well I was baptized this way and I'm going to stay this way okay go ahead I ain't trying to convince you of nothing I'm just illustrating of what I'm talking about the reasoning factor of the of the devil just illustrating in a common little form to us to think about God's word is the only thing that's reasonable ain't nothing else reasonable you think that they're crazy in the medical realm I was reading here the other day I probably told you about it but somewhere around 4,000 years ago they was already Drilling holdes in people's head to try to let them the pressure off is what they were doing but they thought there was devils in there that got in there and they drill holes in the people's head to try to you know George Washington's today they get sick what they do pluck your toenails and your fingernails and bleed your pint killed a lot of people but that was a tree of knowledge you know what a lot of people got better because the body started supplying more blood cells and things you know all right you think they do that now you know no you see they they've learned too much all right but it's about time we've learned something the word of God is either right or wrong it's right let's believe it if it's wrong let's get away from it and if the word of God cannot be kept correctly let's eat drink and be merry CU what are we worried about it right you know why are you concerned about it if you don't believe the word of God Is Right W worry about anything else go live like the devil why because there is no God evidently if he can't keep his word straight but see if we do believe he is and we have something something within us that that leans to the point of of Desire iring to learn the truth and thank God for that desire that thought you know and it'll bring a lot of things into being but you see we try to reason that part out and as Eve you begin to reason with Satan and if you got a scoffield Bible there where it's talking to the Beast look down there and read it scofi is I don't go all with scofi but it is a good point he had a little knowledge you know what let's see if I can find it in a hurry I just wanted to read you what little knowledge Scofield had he said the serpent in his adamic form listen is not thought to be of as a w you know wiggling ring reptile that is the effect of the curse from Genesis the creature which lent itself to Satan May well have been the most beautiful as it was the most subtile of creatures less than man traces of that beauty remain despite the curse every movement of a serpent is graceful and in many species are beautifully colored and that's what a author is writing the Scofield bible is not done by scoffield you know he didn't write it he he he just took the King James and began to expound upon it all right so that Beast was not a snake it was made a snake all right so we can look at that and say hey that's reasonable you understand what I just done I just done what I was saying that I've been trying to preach about doing is to take your mind and to show you that see when you first think about it you said no I don't believe that but then somebody reads something simple to you or Express something simple to you and then you begin to move into a realm of thinking well you know they've got a point let me bear with this a little while and see what goes on all right but listen let me get this point right here in while I'm on the thought and and then this afternoon we'll pick back up with the other but remember Eve began to reason okay now I just read you from the screen you out on internet and in 1962 311 1962 was the greatest battle ever fought priest in Jeffersonville Indiana that the prophet Prophet was explaining the three Realms of man and he explains them as the first Rim the body see taste feel smelling here the second real the soul but he says it's got five senses memory reason conscience affections Etc did you read that then he said then the spirit of man is the center of man all right that's the five senses that control the body c tast f all right inside the body is a soul and the soul is controlled by imagination conscious memory reason affections that's the things that controls the soul are you looking at it right but then the spirit has only one sense so he's saying Body Soul Spirit okay now I got a bunch of them written down here but we won't use them all so brother uh Anderson to save trouble jump all the way to 21 going to be hard to do now remember this is one realm this is one Rim this is one Rim Body Soul Spirit okay now look what he's going to say this is taken from leadership 1965 1207 now look here you are an outside person you have five senses that control the outside body God gave you five senses to contact him you're EXC not excuse me five censes not to contact him your Earthly it's your Earthly home you contact see tast feel smelling here then you have a spirit on inside of that it has five Outlets conscience love so forth five Outlets that you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit your physical contacts are physical your spiritual contacts are spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul and that soul is that Gene that come from God all right so now here is reasoning I gave you two quotes one reading contrary to the other one seemingly so now you're going to reason that out you know what you're going to reason with you're going to reason it with whatever you want because you believe that your soul is the second real and your spirit is the center you're going to reason that you believe that your spirit is the second rim and your soul is the center Rim you're going to reason with that that's what I don't understand about the people of the message they've tried to find so many contrary things seemingly in the message but they don't even really go after the truth that's it amen I'm just making a point you say well which one's right brother Dale both of them you just ain't reading right you're in Satan's lie and listening to him reason with your factors that's right up until about 65 brother random taught it Body Soul Spirit then he changed and he taught Body Spirit and soul and you know he was correct both times you say how could that be because you don't understand go in the Bible and run the word soul and show me the difference between the soul of man or the soul of God or take the word spirit and run it to see whether there's a difference in the word spirit for God or the word spirit for man the only way you can Define it is to find out what it's talking about right when you find out what it's talking about then you can Define it right all right so then the prophet was defining it as Body Soul and Spirit then he was defining it as body spirit and soul but my Point's always been one thing see a revelation will bring it all together and you'll say that he wasn't wrong and didn't have to correct it why because he always gave realm number one see taste feel smell and hear real number two no matter matter what he called it he gave it memory reason conscience affections realm number three he always gave it one sense Faith or doubt now you got it together you don't have to tear up the message and throw it away but see then when you get into the doctrines of the people of the message with the two Soul Doctrine people they quoted a lot of old tapes as soul and trying to make that to CER Rim when brother rner was making it to Second R so it corrected a lot of things if you'll just simply read it like reading the Bible in the basis of read the Bible the Bible says in Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus told him to go baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost right that's Matthew 2819 that's Bible a few days later Peter is standing on the day of Pentecost and they said men and Brethren what must we do to be saved Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and then you read all the way through the Bible that they use Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ and they never use Father Son and Holy Ghost till they Catholic Church come along later and started using it why would those disciples in direct Disobedience to what Jesus had said why would they not baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost they did they did cuz when you baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're baptizing Father Son and Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ that's simple ain't it but you see our wisdom will make it go to what we want that's right yeah but the Catholic Church they're thousands of years old and and you know they got the truth well go with it right forget it but if something bothers you amen that's it about that that you read one thing here and you read this here if it does in the message people as who I'm talking to now if you read something that sounds contrary one to the other sit down and think about it amen you might find out that is right but you might also find the devil in his reasoning ability has tried to bring you to a place to where you can't accept truth because that's the fall see what happened in the garden later is just a manifestation a physical happening an act that took place but what happened to Eve first was Satan got to her mind and got her to reason right that's exactly what's happening right here today to you and I we're reasoning out things in our reasoning factor that our our mind is our brain but yet our memory reason conscious affections and things has to work through that brain and that's called the spirit realm of mankind and see that way you can take the message and it's right you can take the Bible and it's right Paul says that you're justified by faith but we read James and it seemed like he says we're justified by works both of them is right true CU Paul is talking about what God sees of faith and James is talking about what man sees or what we see in each other so both of them's right see you don't have to change the Bible or you don't have to read and say well that don't sound right to this over here just sit down there and think about it for just a little while you might find out that's the only way it could be said to be right come on Brothers you might find the truth laying there amen the Bible says there's just one true and living God but yet the world teaches a trinity where did they get it from because of people reasoning reasoning Factor develops into it not the Bible sit down with the Bible and read it read it for yourself but don't just read one page read it all the way through and then come show me it's wrong he come show me the word of is wrong ah you just hard-headed well good I'm hard-headed so what are you two old hard heads run together joce and Danny looking at each other grinning they said they know two hard heads runs together but you know it works out after a while I mean they're still together but think about it so the word of God is true it tells us what happened in the garden but first it tells us what happened to Eve in her thinking ability and you know she still thinks she's right right the church still thinks he right not arguing with nobody I'm just trying to preach the truth and just read it right out of the word and see what it says but also know that Satan can enter in to your mind and mind and try to get us to reason try to get us to think about these things but God said come let us reason there's only one way God will ever reason with you that's with the word he W reason with you he just tells you what it says then we find out it's the only thing that is reasonable let's stand think on these things 231 231 is power 231 anybody have a need one Glorious Day Jesus came and made me he so completely then satisfi my soul now as I my I wonder is satisfied with I want my Lord to be satisfied with me and I want my life to be what it have it be and when I come to that great ET we believe in the scripture that Paul are that they took aprons from his body and the people were healed so we believe in 19 Lord and we just ask you now that you'd go as we believe with our sister that this will make all for her sister We Believe far in Jesus name work body else but is my Lord fully satisfied with the word of God is the only thing that's reasonable Lord to be satisfied with me and I want my life to be what it have it me then when I come to that great eternity Duncan so let's believe father we send this prayer CLA our sister Lord is sick we just ask you to reach down and touch her deliver her from all the things in Jesus name that I having trouble with an old coal and things and problems we just ask you touch in Jesus name amen anybody else to be satisfied with and I want my life to be what it is that what you want when I come to that great eternity will say he is satisfi is that what your desire is right oh I want my Lord to be satisfied with and I want my life to be what it have it be then when I that remember the service this afternoon 2:00 me pray one for another
