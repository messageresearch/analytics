everything that we no more okay Romans 8 John 6 Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us and thank you for the day and the hour that we have the time upon the Earth and we pray that you would just bless each one of us with your understanding Lord that we may see what you would have for this day and the hour for the message for this day CU truly we can recognize our day in this message and believe we've heard a message from God but now Lord that message must be quickened into our hearts for us to be able to have it as the revealed word Lord forgive our sins cover us and keep us and grant us Lord your grace and love and we commit it to you now just bless Wade and June on the way home Joe and Rachel and him Lord and all the traveling and make all the weather conditions be okay that they can travel and get back to us safely in your love we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen something else I was going to announce and I can't if I don't write it down I don't uh you you know you got what do they say the the the shortest pencil is longer than the greatest memory uh ever what the word but just remember that U maybe I'll think of it in a minute and I'll but Romans 8 and John 6 think about what the word is saying now we're trying to you know we're trying to bring forth uh a thought to you and all of this now is background material I'll be St stating this for the next two or three services all that I'm doing doing is background material because if we don't have the background and then you just go say something then people wonder what you're saying you know and what the point you're trying to cover but this is the background material to help us to understand why the prophet would say that we come here with a seed in us right then we're trying to find out what that seed is and find out how it's in US amen that's simply that I can be and and I'm trying to cover it but trying to let you know where we're going and what we're doing Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against usen John 6 we've been on this scripture for a couple of services verse 60 many therefore of his disciples when they heard this you know about the coming down from heaven in the manner of the different said this is a hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that the disciples murmured at it he said unto the to them does this offend you now what then he asked them a question what if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life you may be seated to the Lord at is blessing to the reading of the word I'm going to try in this year if I can that was one thing I was going to say to uh quote a lot instead of maybe having to read so much but to quote you know as much as I can to help you and some of them said the other day that the last message I preached it woke everybody up for me to walk down the aisle so I may be walking up and down the AIS you know I'll go sit down in the back and preach you know I can run up here every once in a while read my notes but you know all right but now what have we been trying to cover now think about the words that we just read amen Jesus said and I know know now there are arguments about that there's a Rema and a Loos and one was Jesus speaking and the other one was God speaking and and I understand that you know but remember Jesus said my words they are spirit and their life now we'll get back to that in a minute because there is no man in the world could make that statement you can't do it our words are not spirit and life they can become right spirit and life but he did not say my words can become he said my words are all right now that's a drastic statement made and only could be made by God alone so you say but brother Dale I've spoke the word with amen that's fine that's good but just remember you had to get it before you can speak it amen now he didn't say he got it no I know the scriptures you know the father speaking I know all about that but I'm just making a point to you that is very interesting to me that a man could stand here on Earth and say that and it could only be the man Christ Jesus you don't hear brother brandham saying my words are Spirit in life well if we were going to go with anybody could say it we would try to go that way wouldn't but just remember everything we have we must receive that's right all right now that'll keep your mind in the thought of what we're talking about but we've been speaking about the that what is the seed of God and we say well it's the word of God all right that's that's wonderful that's a good thought but remember Paul said the letter would that be the word you know the written the letter kth but the spirit giveth life all right now what is the seed of God then it would be the alive word amen I mean the prophet even said it he said as long as it's laying on these Pages it can be questioned but he said once it's revealed made known to you and I he said you can't question it anymore amen all right now then being that way then the alive word word the Quicken word the revealed word whatever thought you want to use would be the seat of God all right and Jesus now no well let me cover it this way see when Mary as we were trying to cover the other day the angel of the Lord said to Mary you know so and so and so and so and happen Holy Ghost would overshadow you and Etc now what she said be it unto me according to Thy word all right but we'll get back to it more later in understanding more this afternoon or later oh there is what I was going to announce okay I knew it'd come back by the weather conditions and Etc this afternoon we will start at 2:00 by 2:15 I want to be in the pull pit and that way we can at least cut 15 minutes off and we can run through and I'll try to be in a hurry uh as much as I can to get us out of here it's not weather's not supposed to be bad until way later it's supposed to be in the 40s and that would be fine but we won't take no chances I'll try to cut short this afternoon even if I got to preach half the message the other half wins that doesn't bother me but Mary when she said be it unto me according to Thy Word all right see that angel that delivered it even though that was Gabriel he could not plant that seed into her wound you know physically all he could do was speak to the outwards parts of her through her intelligence and dropping down I believe into her soul being and then that way she could speak back and say be it unto me according to Thy word but see then the Holy Spirit had to come upon her and overshadow her and God had to create but the angel couldn't do it that's right an angel cannot you know now we're talking about Heavenly angelics we're not talking about Earthly with the word Angel we're talking about Angelic beings they cannot bring the angel of the Lord spoke to ananas and told him to go down and and open Paul's eyes but the angel didn't go open Paul's eyes it had to be Anan which his name there he had to go pray for Paul all right we'll get back to that is to see and understand but what is the seed of God God you say well it's just a word all right now a letter of the word until that is made alive it is a word just like any other book that you read as far as letters off the page that's right all right now we'll read it after we get time brother he said I've read the Bible many times and he said every time I read it something appears andu you know all right off of it all right now but think about it and my point is what is a seed and why would Jesus say the words that I speak unto you our spirit and their life amen all right what is a seed all right we we take a grain of corn I've tried to explain that and I want to make sure you understand it we take a grain of corn and we hold it up you know and we say we have and see in our terminologies we use it as the word seed but it's really a grain because you can't see the seed of the Corn you can see the hull the things but especially corn does it all seeds do it but you can see it better in corn go out there this year if you ever noticed the the crows love to go along when the corn gets about that high and they pull that up because they know down on the bottom end to that is that grain of corn as we call it it's still hooked on and until it grows out of it it's still there so just pull one up and look at it and you'll see what I'm talking about about the the outside is the hull part all right now we say we've got a a seed now remember the seed is in the corn in the inside of that grain H you you can crush the grain you know the the outside hole but the seed is really the germ I'll get more on that the Lord willing this afternoon but really the the the seed of God is the germ because it has to have as Jesus said when he said my words if he said my words are just like anybody else's words that that would have been you know have been left but he didn't say that he said my words they are spirit and they're alive in other words they're alive amen he was God see it wasn't somebody else now wait till we get to the prophets with that way do we get down to the real message that we're going to you know when those prophets would receive from God and then speak out they didn't go speak their own thoughts see because their words were not spirit and life their words were alive to them right they were alive to God but they were not alive to anybody else that's why it's got to be sown to understand and the only question I've ever asked of people to try to get an understanding of everybody saying you were born with this seed in you it's got this it's a word it's this that and the other all right I believe all the quotes the prophet said but I asked a simple question the new birth is it the birth of the words you hear after you come into the world or is it the birth of the words you claim you got when you come into the world you know which one is birth right and see then that runs into a lot of thoughts and you know if if it's just quickening of the words you already have you don't need anything that's right that's the old two Soul Doctrine and people don't believe it but all right that's up to them but you see we look at a grain of corn as they say we say I got a seed of corn or beans potatoes whatever you know all right if that seed has not been gerti it is no good all right now planting it don't germatize it right it's got to be germatize because you remember you can make a grain of corn look exactly everything perfectly the same the only difference it doesn't have the life it doesn't have the German tized part within it that can make it all right now that's why that when we'll get to it eventually but I'm trying to lay down some thoughts see if I preach my ideas about the word then I'm not showing the seed of God I'm showing my ideas that's right all right and that's why the prophet is I was covering the other day says don't teach the word he said preach the word now was he doing away with teachers when brother brownon spent half of his message saying I'm teaching no he's just saying don't just try to beat on the letter preach by Revelation what God has given to you right and then see then Noah wouldn't preach Moses's message right amen see we we incorporate all of it but we don't preach Luther's message but we incorporate what he said but we we we don't preach it like that we we go on Beyond but yet we incorporate that into what we're saying of Wesley Pentecost Etc and all but to look at at what is a seed all right then God's word must be made alive right right right and no matter the greatest of all I believe the prophet in our day was the greatest of all don't you you know to be able to bring us the word that's right but yet he could not reveal the word that's right he could only speak what God had given him to say all right now in doing it then it takes before you can call it a seed it takes the Egg The Germ like in a chicken whatever you know and you call that deceit all right now I got it written down in here somewhere what Webster say and what I think it's in the evening message but uh the word seed in the Scofield means Offspring the word seed means Offspring it means descendant it means children that's the definition word Webster says it's the germ of a prop Pro p o p r o p uh o g a a t i v e in other words reproduction right source of anything all right it means sperm or Sean the word seed so seed has got a lot of you know meaning in the points of what we're looking at but when it comes back to the word see then are we showing seed and that's F that's word in come on are we really trying to seow The Germ of the word because you can seow the seed of the word and it only be letter that's right but if you s The Germ of the word it means you have it alive first and remember you got to have it before you can speak it when I first come into the message everybody wanted to speak the word speak the word one day I'll speak it you know I said well the only thing that I've understand about it is you you got to have it before you can speak it that's just you know I'm sorry that's my way of looking at it I know I'm not very uh nicely about the way I say things but I I I try to say them as best as I can you know without it being uh horrible but yet still trying to say what I believe a preacher gets up and he preaches and brother Brown said you can preach a denominational seat come on run it the message he said you can preach organizational seat Well it evidently is organizational word it's organizational thoughts you know right that can be done and it still have nothing to do and not be the word of God but see it takes a union to make a SE amen all right the grain of corn must be put in the ground and here's what you don't get people to talk about much you put it in the ground and brother around said you go back out the next day you dig it up and see okay you put it back in the ground you dig it back up he said that grain of corn means whatever has got to rotten and he said you can't take a microscope and find the germ of life he said but throughout the things and like flowers he said will lay there through the winter and it'll come back up in the spring well because it's got the germ of Life all right so now if the word is the same way of talking about a seed and things then you see why that the word must be sown and you say but but brother Dale I got it without anybody telling me where'd you get it right well I got it outspoken word book somebody wrote the book besides brother Brandon was the one that spoke it that's well I I just got mine right out of the Bible Well somebody wrote it oh my I know that's hateful to people they don't like for you be that blunt CU it doesn't leave you playing room you know everybody wants to well this this this is the way I think it is I don't care what you think I care what God thinks right now then think about it it takes a union to make a seed just like it takes the egg from the woman The Germ from the man is put together reproduces either one of them by itself won't reproduce right because it takes the two together to come out with a seed which is Offspring or reproduction all right but we're dealing with the word we're not dealing with um you know the other things but I like what the prophet has to say so let's just read I've read you this before but let's go over this go ahead with number one it's a message called Oneness 1962 to11 paragraph 89 and 90 and listen what happened I said all right I want to ask you the qu ask you something the woman has no egg she has no seed he said now he said not an egg he said thy seed he says to the woman not an egg all right he said thy seed right he's talking about Genesis what 3:15 and to thy seed all right so what she had to be given a seed all right now what was she given when she said Mary right remember Eve baced it messed it all up when Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word she accepted what was said by the angel and it become a germ in her thinking as we'll say it that way do you know that brother R said she received that seed from her mother an be glad to show you that and this is another thing wife and I were listening the other day and where he said it he said when that angel begin to speak to Mary he said it already had been she had other words paraphrasing she had studied the word she knew Isaiah of what it had said and said when that angel said you know the Holy Ghost had overshadowed the and these things said her mind went straight back to the scripture of the Virgin shall conceive it the angel didn't come and bring her a great big sermon God had prepared her that's right right for this event and she had received from her mother the seed you know of understanding I quoted that to a man one time and he let me have it good he said I'm tired of this old mother doctrine of the woman bringing the seed I said well I didn't say it you going to have to fuss with brother brandom CU he said she received it from her mother but brother R said as quick as it was said her mind went back into scripture see a germ begins to develop in with her something that could be made alive so she said be it unto me in other words if that is Isaiah 9:6 whatever what the scripture there is right then let me just you myself and whatever you do you bring it forth amen the angel couldn't do it as I said while ago but he said the Holy Ghost will overshadow thee now when he came to her she already had a thought a jourm then he quickened that Isaiah 9:6 right he made it alive that she was the one doing that and see that's what we got to do as I said how many times Martin Luther might have preached sermons or discourse of messages or great things on the just you live by faith but one day he read it and God he already had the jourm part laying there of the thoughts but but yet God had to make it alive that's right all right now Mary never produced if you're listening to me don't get confused The Germ was in Mary stinking she never produced an egg God created both because what now all right what are we talking about egg sperm make a seed that's right eggs not a seed sperms not a seed you got to put them together and makes a seed that's that's what happened to Mary when she said be it unto me according to Thy word God created egg and sperm germ whatever you want to call it into her physical wound all right and it become a seed the seed of the woman that's what he's explaining see and to thy seed and she had no seed so he gave her a seed right now what he's explaining it takes a union to make a seed is that right doctor he's talking to somebody there has to be if you got a whole lot of pup out here didn't have no life in it planted it out here it won't never come up lay there and right you couldn't plant the life without having the pup so you see the whole thing is a union I'm just trying to tell you about Christ in the church it's a union all right now what is it cuz it takes two to make a seed he goes on to say now are you listening there I've got a seed of corn brother Dale now you got a grain you can't prove that it's a seed you know what I mean te it apart do what you want to dissect it you can't prove it they make one looks just like it they tear it apart looks just like yours because you can't find the germ of life right The Germ of life is in that grain that's right but that germ of life has got to go through a process right before it becomes a seed that's simply what I'm talking about people saying well you know I come here with this I come here with that what did you come here with where's it at you know all right think about it but I'm still trying to drive a point go ahead to the next one number two I'm still still trying to drive a point to you and I my wife says I need to explain a lot of things so I'll try the best I can I may preach 20 sermons off of one message but I'll try to explain it all right talking about the word there was a large Congregation of people that heard Jesus you agree oh many witnessed signs and wonders but yet what he said to them even though they would say now we know that thou H has the words of life but remember Nicodemus said we know that God has to be with you cuz no man can do what you're doing see they heard the son of man so deceived right is that The Parables right you remember the other day the parable one of them says that and they sprang up but the cares of life now if you're meaning anything in sense when they sprang up it meant something was made alive right so would it be possible to start out with something of the word and it be taken from you I will remind you that it was not the spirit taken away in the ages it was the word that's right now don't think it can't be taken from you and don't take it and try to put things on to it that's right take what it says no matter what you understand when God speaks to our hearts come on are you with me with this when God speaks to you the first thing he said is almost as bad as Isaiah 9:6 right you know what I mean by that brother around and said he thought who in the what in the world am I saying that a virgin shall con receive he said that's impossible when God speaks something to you the first reaction is what that can't be or I don't understand how that can be all right then you hold on to that and God can develop it in you all right but look what he says the word itself is Spirit now to me this is the only way that we can understand how Jesus said my words are Spirit in their life maybe you understand maybe it's it's all right but see he didn't say my words maybe or someday will be when he spoke it it was alive it may have been a prophecy of thousands of years but to him it was alive when nonon saw chariots jostling in the streets running like Lightnings you know light to him he saw Buick and old mobiles and Cadillacs running to each other in on the highway with lights on he didn't know how to explain it no but that's what he saw all right cuz it was alive now when we get back to the this remember a point Moses got the thought from God it was Moses's thought right and then he spoke it and it become word right but what about the writing of the five books very close he had to get to thought and he wrote it but he didn't speak it he wrote it follow the wording now the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form now if it's spirit it's alive right are you with me yes if it's spirit it's alive okay now it's spirit in word form it's brought down from this being Spirit downward toward word word and what is it uh it's not in this one there one next or two oh okay we'll get it right here and this is God's thought that he has placed in the word you can't add two or t away right that's right that's right all right well watch the word itself is spirit it's spirit and word form and then you see when it's quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts because that now look a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word and then when a thought is presented it is a word now we'll get to some in a minute where where he covers what John 1:1 remember John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and brother Brandon places that beginning in Genesis 1 because that's where you hear God begins to speak right he places John 1 in Genesis 1 as he begins to speak now think about it this is God's thought that he has placed in the word and when we receive it from him it becomes a word right well know was word all the time word was always word now I I need to go back and preach on the godhead for about another sermon right to reminds you that it was first God's thought he DW D alone with his thoughts and then he began to speak it becomes a word you said well brother Dale I don't understand how that could ever be that it wasn't a wasn't a word all the time that you're trying to figure it out instead of taking what the prophet says that God dwelt Alone with his thoughts he said he condescended down word that you and I could comprehend him right and said he spoke it it become the logos the speech the word all right now but then he started creating when we receive it see God revealed to Moses what to do Moses spoke it and it happened but he had to first get it as a thought that's right and so Moses got the word come down the correct way well there just too much technology into that too much uh too much old letter of the word well I'm sorry that's just the way I am because I didn't get where I'm at just by flying by night I got there by studying what the prophet has said what the Bible has said all right now think about it this is God's thought that he's placed in the word right it's still a thought till it comes to you right I don't care if the prophet explained it I don't care if I got it wrote on the side of the page thank you of what he said and come on it's St right but when that's revealed to me amen it must come to me first as a thought oh now you're trying to no it comes to everybody that way the prophet's message must be a thought to you and I right then it can be revealed what he's saying amen all right see then we can come to the right place look what he explains the next one I know I won't get through with this message this morning so we'll finish it this evening look at the next one number three take from spoken words Original Seed 1962 318 paragraph 161 and all of God's Sons must be the same amen now go read back or forth what yes sir to be born of the word and spirit right now now what is to be born to the word and the spirit you hear the word and it's made alive right right is that the new birth born of the word and the spirit Paul says in what at Romans 6 or 8 that you believe in your heart and you confess with your mouth all right now to be born of the word and spirit look bring us back to the spoken word again you remember I asked you to listen to that message over and over the spoken word is the original seat he didn't say the letter of the word the original seat come on he spent four hours preaching on the spoken word is the original seat it's got to be spoke by somebody or we don't get it but I I need all I got to it was spoke by somebody in the Bible but think about it bring us back to the spoken word again what like in John 3 John 3 what is John three in my house there many mansions if it were not so I would have told you and go to prepare a place for you if I go to prepare a place for you I'll receive you under myself that where I am there you may be also he said back brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 see to be born to the water and spirit what does it do it brings you right back again unto the place of where you should have been at the beginning brother tale do you mean the new birth is that what he's explaining about being born again to be born again in your soul not your body your spirit now because the birth not there in your soul by the new birth if you have eternal life you back like it should have been had it been no fault that's why to me when Brother randam begin to talk like that I said I don't have the Holy Ghost he's talking about but see everybody said oh I come in the message I know I got the Holy Ghost got to come in the message I was the message two years before I received and I'll read to you this evening why I get down to it where brother brownon said them demons he said I should have been saved when I was about 12 years old he said but them demons kept me from being saved well you know my point is them demons and them preachers is what keeps most people from being saved right why because they bring you false hopes all right see if you're born by the word and spirit the new birth your soul is backward it would have been had been no fault that's right like in the beginning it brings you right back again to the place where you should have been at the beginning see that's the reason of Christ death brings us right back again to we're sons of God brings us right back to sons of God sons of God that can understand the word all right now think about it think about what Jesus was saying think about what the prophet just now said if you're born to the word and spirit word must be swn into your heart Spirit must Quicken that word right there's never been nobody saved in the Bible that didn't hear the word first I want that somebody to show me that so if it if you come here with it why did somebody have to show it of course you know what they're saying now I knew they was going to get smart enough one of these days I say that sarcastically I knew they going to come up with the idea one of these days cuz you got to have an answer what are they saying the new birth is now do you know what they're saying it is that God just come down done everything he done and all it was to do was brother col to let you know you always was eternal the new birth is just you got a knowledge you always was eternal I knew they was going to come up with that I said that 40 years ago that that's what they'd come up with and say it and that's what's what they're saying other words the whole message the whole Bible everything is to just to get you to realize you always was short tore Nicodemus out of the frame didn't it Nicodemus said you're a man sent from God we know it we've listened to you we've seen the Miracles yes why didn't Jesus turn around Nicodemus you always was I'm just telling you you always was I don't have to die I just tell you you always was there's no need of a death of Jesus Christ if it's a knowledge of always was what kind of a statement would a man make when he could say my words are Spirit and their life but yet he was the man that turned back to Nicodemus and said you must be born again right right why was it not just Escape reading the word you know you got it you know the letter no that man and that person that could say that would have to be almighty God cuz I want it I want you to show me I want you show me any man outside of Jesus Christ almighty God in human flesh that could say my words are Spirit in their life I believe brother Brandon could say that show me where he said it my Bible says everything we have what we received why then would Jesus say that you and I must be born again to understand what he was saying is that the scripture is that the scripture that he said we must be born again to be able to understand what he said if your words my words were spirit and life if brother Brandon's words were spirit and life then you don't need Jesus to get you a new birth that's right amen if you always was eternal you don't need the death of Christ amen well that's what I said now they well brother Dale all that was done to just tell us who we are you mean Jesus died on the cross and all he had to do was say you are what you are I'm telling you you say I know I'm sarcastic hateful and arrogant 73 years old but there's one thing about it I was preaching this when I was 30 years old shortly thereafter about 1971 because see I've believed it 10 and how much more do I believe it now like we were talking about last night in the Bible study and I told him you know my favorite statement I'd rather go through life searching for God praying and seeking him for an answer to my human being that I can know that I'm saved and one day get there and find out about the man that brother brandham told up you remember he read the track and he went here and he went here and he went here and here and here and brother around when he went he said you got it when you back there I'd rather God to tell me that one day but i' sure hate to be that I well if I deny that I'm saved I didn't say nothing about denying you're saved I said confess you're saved until you come to it amen what about when you get there what about the woman that was anointed with the Holy Ghost you get on to that she Tau to Sunday school and things you couldn't tell her she was lost but when she come down to her dying hour everything broke forth and her real Soul come up she's begin to scream she's lost wouldn't it be something to wind up one day realize you're lost and that you wouldn't seek God why wouldn't any Christian is there ever a man you've ever heard of that sought God and cried and laid before him and more than your Prophet did don't you believe he had the new birth but yet he would constantly say Lord I hope I'm saved that's right I believe I am what about it what about it Church see the man that said my words are spirit and life said you must be born again he said to be able to understand what I'm saying right now is it in the scripture that no man can call Jesus the Christ what except by the holy ghost or Holy Spirit Every Which Way it says and what is the prophet's definition of that he said by the new birth a personal experience all right why would Jesus say say what he did go ahead with number four John 8:43 why would Jesus say this if we were all so spiritual all so knowingly and all so got so much and look what he says why do you not understand my speech now if my words are spirit and life if your words is spirit and life when he speaks I'd get it spirit and life right come on he said even because you cannot hear my word now the Bible goes and said to hearing the word went out to all the world why they're not saved why is it you can't understand my speech was it Japanese Chinese or now you got more sense than that but he said you can't understand what I'm talking about didn't he say to Nicodemus you must be born again wouldn't that exactly what he would be saying to him he said Nicodemus you can't understand what I'm saying why he said I've already put it in my word how to be born again Ezekiel 36 give you a new heart and a new spirit then I put my spirit in you is that in the word there'd come a time when it wouldn't be said that the fathers ate grapes and the children's teeth were on edge right the whole Old Testament was pointing to the new birth that's right he said you don't understand my speech Nicodemus you must be born again he said I don't understand your speech you're speaking strange things he said the reason you don't understand my speech is you don't understand my word you've heard it but you have no faith is that's what it says in the in Romans about the children of Israel that they sought it not by faith they knew the letter of the word right Nicodemus the teacher in Israel Jesus said you studied the word you've been in the word you've lived in the word but said you don't understand what I'm talking talking about and said all that's been said before me is speaking that I must die to give my life to where it can come back in you that you can understand you get it why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word they heard it to the letter but they never got it off the letter and when he begin to speak of you must be born again that was strange language it's strange today to tell the people of this message you must be born again you know why I believe the prophet I believe everything Prophet says well Hallelujah and that's where that God did choose a few old hardheads like me to be able to bring out a few things and said what do you think about that what do you think about Daniel 70 weeks being so perfect well I think he was wrong here who gave you the right to say he was wrong amen right the Bible still speaking his brother Brown said whe what was that people you know that said we speak where the Bible speaks and we're silent where it's silent he said the Bible's still talking you remember they said there only 12 got the Holy Ghost he said well Paul got the Holy Ghost 30 years later and was still ordaining throughout the church down to there and he said besides said there was 3,000 on the day Pentecost come on let got the Holy Ghost he said the Bible's still talking why is it the people of this message don't understand because they don't know the word you mean I come up through you mean you come up through all of your life through the word being taught that you must be born again come on you see why did I get I know I get statements and it's hard but I'm trying to save your soul I don't give a hoot what you think about this outside you're looking at if I can stand there that day and present you to Christ we won't have no problem about bodies in words but you see the word has first got to be sown amen before can be quickened look at John 16 and13 he tells you what will happen right how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come you don't understand now you can't call Jesus the Christ I know I'm putting another scripture over there and another man making it but he's still the same Holy Ghost right he will guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come brother brandham said he not only Quicken what Jesus said but said he told them things to come what about it see our words are not spirit in life do you understand me our words are not spirit and life the Quicken word is spirit and life right the quickened word is the seed of God that's right not natural letters well I just go sewing seed what kind uh there's a group of people there one day that evidently thought they were so in seed but a certain man stood up one day and said you stand in the door and said you won't go in you remember Jesus saying that and said you won't let the people go in and said you won't go in yourself how about it see you and I must hear the word now what did it say about to the parable they took the word and it sprouted up a little bit in one group the other one that just choked it out and this one done that and but it says they kept the word one of them says held I think is the original didn't say anything those disciples took the word and held it and you know what happened on De Pentecost the Holy Ghost quickened right he was seen of over 500 Brethren Brethren it says so evidently they must have been Believers but we where they at on the day of Pentecost when it only 120 in the upper room right evidently 380 didn't value the word they heard it was not being mixed with faith Peter and him at least come out with one thing that's what I can't understand about you and me why can't we just come down to it and say that's it see that's one thing you can't get out of preachers if for them to tell you what they believe they want to preach it and then when you get it they won't tell you what to believe you can't say that about me that's right everything from marriage and divorce to se to serpent seeds to seals to Danel 70 weeks I told you what I believe why because I'm trying to se the seat of the word but I realized as I tried to explain to you the other day like I said you see something right brother Coler you see something oh it's beautiful you just man you can just you can lay there the other day I was down there in the woods and I just sat there I didn't give a hoood about a de I just sitting there in my mind I just let it run through the message amen of what I was thinking on you know two hours later I was wondering what I thought that's right do you ever do that amen you try you see something it's so beautiful oh oh I just got you go you know I really can't explain it like I said brother randam said you walk away and say I should have said so and so he said God didn't want you to say that or he would have brought it to your attention right come on but don't worry about it just keep on pounding on it it'll come back I like what brother Woodby said one time he said if you can explain it real good said I doubt it's a revelation and that's a good point why because it becomes words words you so words you so see his words are Spirit in their life his words are Spirit in their life look let's get this one more and then we'll quit and we'll just start this evening on the message that's no problem go to number six this is taken from Investments 1963 803 to be in paragraph 137 is really where it's at remember this is God in letter form you're talking about eternal life policy it like to he said this is God in the letter form my words are Spirit Jesus said and they are life did he say it congregation says amen he also said this in St John the first chapter the Bible tells us in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word word excuse me the in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh as I just got through telling you and dwelt Among Us taking words our spirit and Life to John 1 cuz you see when he said that as far as he was concerned it was alive right when those prophets spoke they spoke in the first person the psalmist David said they pierced my hands and my feet the dogs barked and wagged at me not a bone was broken David said until they could asked is this man even in Isaiah the the the Ethiopian unit is this man speaking of himself or is he speaking of another remember the words that I'm saying when a prophet receives the thought from God he must speak that thought for it to be a word but to him it's Eternal but to the person it spokes to it becomes letter right it becomes letter I'll emphasize again even though the angel could tell Mary what would take place she had to say be it unto me according to Thy word then and only then could she have the seed of the woman that God created egg and sperm both and placed it within her even her own confession never brought a seed right her own confession never brought a an egg right right it took God to create amen that's right oh if I can just tell you where I'm headed to one of these days you're going to see it this message can only come to you and I as a thought it's up to you brother randam said these ministers will pick this up and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord that's right do we believe that amen are you depending on somebody to speak the word to you or are you just going to get it yourself and just remember when you think you're getting it yourself you got to read what somebody said cuz you're reading the prophets message here in the tape are you're reading the Bible that somebody said right so don't come up with garbage can that I can just get it myself see we want to speak the word let me say this and you'll see where I'm headed about 15 sermons away or maybe sometime the end of the end of this year brother Brandon spoke five times is that right he spoke other times we know that but five times he recorded you know what he said he said every time was sovereignly given now don't you think that his wife having that tumor and getting larger and larger don't you think that brother brandham tried his best fasting and praying and seeking God to take that away and if he could have just come up with thus sayeth the Lord you know just if he could have got it but yet he could say the Bible is thus sayeth the Lord but he knew better than to say it letter on the page was going to heal her don't you think that he would have tried to speak it right but see then one day God dropped down see we want to make brother random as being the one that just speak the word anyway he couldn't speak it till God gave it yeah but I thought speak to this mountain I I thought the same Bible that said speak to this mountain said it's not you that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in you he's one that's doing the speaking that's kind of I thought the Bible said that my brother there you're just destroying everything CU we thought we would just build on one of these days we just going to walk in here and we just going to call for a a porter housee steak and it'll just be laid out in front of us right you say you don't believe it will happen yeah I've seen it happen so I don't have to worry about it I don't have to worry about what I've seen we had a service here one time we didn't have enough food for half the people that was here they begin to talk to me about what we going to do I said put it out for the people there'd be plenty it took place yeah but you don't like to talk to somebody that's got enough Goods to be able to talk back to you do you want to be in that category that you ain't got nothing and I ain't got nothing we're all just sitting around cuz we ain't got nothing I like kind of what brother Hal Thomas said one day he's listening to this and he knows it's right he needed prayer thought come to him same God is here today as he was with the prophet let me just go up and be prayed for you know what he's delivered right but you see folks we've got it all figured out but you know if it don't come our way come on musicians if it don't come our way what have we got figured out I think it's this way okay I don't mind putting what I believe on the line I think you ought to be willing to that's why you don't come out hear me come out here and say I think so and so is going to happen I think maybe it'll be this way I don't say maybe if I ever speak to you I speak it because maybe can be questioned like one one man one brother said one time he said let's just watch them and said something will happen to them like a car wreck or something well you know after maybe 40 50 years driving you're probably going to have a wreck right brother random didn't speak like that you tell me something going to happen I want to know the date I want to know the time the season where it's going to happen well I didn't see that Brother D I just seen people that got sick that ain't nothing tell me who's sick what you going to do about it see that's why we try to speak our own words by our own thoughts and what does it wind up being I hope you understand one thing this morning nothing else Jesus said my words are spirit and life when he spoke it it was alive but when we we think our words are spirit and Li when we get it from God and it's quickened by the Holy Ghost Mary could go out and say I'm pregnant right why because she took God's word and he could Quicken it she had something to show for it you see we think we're so spiritual right what we got let's Stand Together 231 231 we'll pick this up and finish the message this evening glor he so completely then satisfied my now as I face dark and troubl SE I wonder if he is satisfied with me I want my Lord to be satisfied with me then we just keep walking in the word what it the prophet told us what will happen that great eternity he said we going to walk off this Earth I believe that he said to stick of be here by word I believe that he said the bride will become the word I believe that he said the bride is to vindicate I looking at this morning the bride is to vindicate Malachi 4 I my I thought that brother brand I I thought it said that he turn the parts of the children back to the fathers I thought that mean you what about it do we believe it give me strength me courage make me go that I might lead some sheep thy that I might stand unraid un the that you might be fully satisfied with me I want my Lord to be satisfied with me and I want my life to be what it me and when I God to that great eternity his smile will say is satisfied with me oh I want my Lord to be satisfied with me and I want my life to be what it have be then when I come to that great eternity I will say he is satisfied with me I want my Lord to be satisfied with me I want my life to be what it have beenen our sister was was talking about it yesterday brother Bob come on and she said I want to baptism of the Holy Ghost I want to know I got it I said okay we pray with you you but now listen you've heard the word right you've been baptized because the word says it you followed the Lord okay now all we need to do is pray for the Lord to Quicken it the new birth is the birth of that word you heard okay now here's what you got to do though you got to confess it right because that's scripture believe in your heart confess with your mouth okay now so from now on you can't say I'm not saved if you do you've come back out from where we're praying you've pulled yourself out and then you're lying see this plain language you're not doing it right so from now on you say I wish Brother Gary Atkins would here maybe he listen in today and he could tell you two i' done it two years and confess God's word before I got the Holy Ghost he went a year and he kept coming to me and he kept coming he said brother Dale but I see the one God I see this I see that I said that's fine that's all right that's good that's the seed being planted but I said one day day God will speak to you and you will know and for one year he confessed it he called me one day he'd call me constantly from Alabama riding the road because he was carrying films to be developed Etc back forth but one day he called me from the rest area he said it's over with he said it was settled right here you mean it was settled in a rest area or on a I20 driving down the highway well brother tat him my remember him tell him he said I sit that on that apple tree and he said it just like raindrops you can't make it happen when you want it to happen that's our problem but we can believe it so never confess no more you drive it down right now Satan comes back and said you didn't get saved said okay I was there and there was five People Prayed with me plus the whole church they prayed for me and I'm going to say that I am born again all right now you say well brother does that automatically make me no I didn't say that I said you keep confessing it until one day you'll tell me you're born again but you got to tell God because you got to say what he says he said believe in your heart confess with your mouth you remember what we talking about last night even brother Brown talking about his daughter-in-law Lois she receive the Holy Ghost one night the next night she was doubting it now that's on the message you mean that that you can get the Holy Ghost and doubt yeah because you're still human that's right but when that word is revealed and you say by that word is revealed the word and the spirit Has Come Together be it unto me according to Thy word and it'll have to take place around say when the bride begins to say that he said you'll see Sparks are flying when we begin to say what he says all right do you understand what I'm saying but brother Dale do I need to feel anything what feeling do you want now I can quote brother random because he says if you desire to speak in tongues and you lay under the spout long enough God is good to let you speak in tongues what are you going to say say you ain't saved you speak in tongue no we're going to say it right here we're going to say today right at this time about 3 minutes till 12 on my watch we're going to say you are born again we're going to say that you've received the Holy Ghost this day and whatever God does that's up to him you say yeah but no you ought to get me emotional and sing me up and pray me up I I didn't know they was prayed up I I mean I thought in the book of Acts that it says they were in the upper room and probably doubting what was going on and the Holy Ghost came the Holy Ghost is Promised is unto you your children the many of are far off and even the Lord thy God shall call it's a promise repent everyone of be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you what shall receive the gift gift of the Holy Ghost all right let's settle the problem but don't you go now and say well I ever didn't they didn't get it because that's going to mean you didn't get it but when you go and say I've received it this day now whatever comes with God all right let's believe it okay let's lay hands on our sister and believe and our brother wants the same thing so let's believe thanes and accept it father we're not built on emotional situations we love them they are wonderful Lord and I believe in them we're built on what you say in your word you said repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the prophet said we wind up saying when they say what must we do we try to to tell them what to do and not to do quit this and quit that he said that wasn't a question or the thought we believe that Lord you died for our sister to receive the Holy Ghost she has heard your word she sat down here and listened when even she probably wanted to leave she didn't want to hang around because it wasn't according to her previous thinkings and thoughts but yet Lord she stayed she believes it our brother's here too Lord and he he's believing you so now we're going to say that they are this day a born again Christian and they're confessing it but their confession has got to be continual he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved if we stop believing Lord we're not saved but if we keep confessing it confessing it confessing it every time the Devil comes to you sister and brother just say but the words says it God said it I believe his word you have given me the new birth because Lord it has to start as a thought if they would get the thought of what I'm trying to say it has to start as a thought in their mind when they walked down here the prophet said that was 50 or 60% of the whole story for them to walk down here and say I want the baptism of the Holy Ghost and most people will say I already got it I already got Lord we love you and we thank you Father that you've give our brother our sister the baptism of the Holy Ghost now Lord you give them a little tug on their heart right now or whenever you want to in the middle of the night when they're crying out unto you that they can see you Lord and they can say I believe I am a born again Christian go we confess our way into everything we must believe it and we confess it we believe it now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen and amen then go confess it now don't let the devil get anything to say and he will as quick as you start right back through there he's going to say you didn't get it well now why would he say it got it now I've already explained this to everybody here because that's what I believe the Lord ain't going to tell you that you don't have something because if you just repented of your sins you got something so he's not going to tell he tell you you need more okay all right but the devil's one that's going to tell you you didn't get it and see if he can make you doubt it then he'll take it away from you but you confess your way right into it I wish I could stand here all afternoon and talk about two years taking and reading as many as six books a day and listening to two tapes man sitting right there he telling it the other night brother collie when he know I sat right down there that's all we done is read and talked about the word but see one day it was quickened I had seen angels I know two times and one is questionable about the time El because we were already over where we live but that would have been 73 but I had seen all kind of things but I can't make that an Evidence it's whether or not my spirit agrees with that word keeps on agreeing you mean you won't never have a doubt oh yeah cuz the devil's going to try to make you doubt but I'm like Abraham I'm going to doubt my doubts Hallelujah remember Abraham didn't have the Holy Ghost to believe right but you can have the Holy Ghost when you just confess your way right into it but don't never just Mark the Spot and say right there this day January the 5th is finished hallelujah what else you going to do well I I want to shout and scream go right ahead I told a man down y go ahead I told a man down in Atlanta one day he said when when the spirit strikes me he said I just or somebody here maybe then I just start running I said don't slow down I might run into you you yeah I said just don't slow down I might run into you cuzu you know it's whatever the Lord Stripes but you said but the new birth will you explain to me now they were sitting in the upper room it says in one mind and one Accord but yet your Prophet is already explained it to you that one of them said I don't I think we already got it one of them says no we don't have it so there was evidently a lot of problems but he promised it and it came right it'll come to you that the same way you believe it and accept it father we just believe your word we believe that if we just keep confessing then in somewhere it'll be made manifest and we'll look back and you'll say well you you got it right back there you just needed to keep confessing till you got out of the way CU we believe it Lord we believe what that Prophet has taught unto us we also know that it's got to be revealed and that's all we're trying to do have your way with us dismiss us now as we go eat a natural meal come back together this afternoon Lord to continue the thought we love you and we thank you blessed waiting them on their way home today maybe Joe and them we just pray that you'd take care of them because if it's not meant for them to leave out they need to stay there until it clears up but that's up to you Lord so you just come and make it manifest we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen your dismissed they told me sweetest story
