[9:58] Amen god bless you tonight let's stand
[10:01] look into the scripture tonight amen
[10:09] praise the Lord he will deliver us and
[10:14] you know there's one thing about it how
[10:17] many can say that he has delivered Amen
[10:20] that you've seen him come on the scene
[10:24] that's kind of one of the things I won't
[10:26] talk about tonight I don't know how this
[10:29] is gonna go but y'all just y'all just
[10:33] pray for me and what's the what's that
[10:36] lead follow or get out of the way so you
[10:42] know I don't I don't know I'm I'm a I'm
[10:44] a jump up and down I'm a shout I don't
[10:46] know what I'm gonna do I don't know what
[10:49] I'm gonna do I may cry I don't know but
[10:51] you know I you know tonight I want to I
[10:55] want to look at something tonight the
[10:57] title of this is called a book of
[10:58] remembrance and and though in the word I
[11:01] want to look at tonight is called
[11:02] rehearse I want to look at this word
[11:04] rehearse because there's times in the
[11:06] scripture that we look at and God talks
[11:10] about rehearsing and one of the the
[11:13] scripture we're going to read from is
[11:15] Exodus chapter 17 but I want to look at
[11:17] this word where Moses writes a book for
[11:20] Joshua and he says to rehearse it in the
[11:23] ears of Joshua and that's what I want to
[11:25] talk about not because you know the
[11:27] thing is you know God has been so good
[11:31] to us and you know what if we don't
[11:34] praise God he said the rocks would cry
[11:36] out and let me tell you what I don't
[11:39] know about the rest of you but I got a
[11:40] lot to thank him for and you know I mean
[11:43] you go back to your life and you look at
[11:46] things that God's done for you and where
[11:48] he's brought you to and where he's
[11:49] brought you from I tell you what if you
[11:51] can't shout you're dead
[11:54] and I makes you up tonight I may cry
[12:00] don't know what I'm gonna do but you
[12:05] know when you sing God work you know you
[12:10] can't thank him enough
[12:17] hallelujah oh I feel good to know so
[12:23] appreciate this opportunity to speak and
[12:26] but they wanted me to speak last
[12:28] Wednesday I had to go I had a whole
[12:30] surgery and I had a sinus infection so
[12:34] it would have been very good last week
[12:35] so it all worked out I didn't want to I
[12:39] didn't want to tell him no but i had to
[12:41] sew but the lord worked it out so I'm
[12:43] clear and I'm okay so thank the Lord for
[12:47] that and the Lord is the Lord is good to
[12:52] us and I know there's many there's many
[12:54] needs tonight but you know I want I want
[12:56] to look at this and I want to look at
[12:58] faith brother Donnie says brother you
[13:01] like to preach on faith well you know
[13:02] that's that's that's the it's the fight
[13:05] it's the resting place it's the firm
[13:07] foundation of the Word of God
[13:09] it's to have faith you gotta have faith
[13:11] and I know there's many many needs and
[13:15] you know tonight when we looked before
[13:17] we read the scripture I want to pray and
[13:20] I want each one of us no I don't want
[13:23] this just to be another prayer but I
[13:25] want us to be real sincere about what
[13:27] we're praying about I mean really think
[13:29] about what we're praying and I have a
[13:31] friend of mine that his son is in
[13:34] Children's Healthcare of Atlanta tonight
[13:37] and he's got bronchitis and same for
[13:39] Bryson so we're gonna pray for him
[13:41] because his wife Hillary sent out a
[13:44] message earlier send y'all for everybody
[13:47] to pray so you know everybody was going
[13:49] to church tonight so I was like well
[13:50] we're definitely gonna be praying
[13:52] because we gathered in a house of God
[13:54] tonight so we're going we're gonna talk
[13:56] to him cosa you know the one thing where
[13:58] he said where two or three are gathered
[14:00] in in my name I'm in the midst and a guy
[14:06] that I work with

[14:32] families really taking this hard as
[14:34] anybody would and you know we believe
[14:38] that they can find her alive and
[14:41] everything but you know I pray when I
[14:44] see people have when there's missing
[14:46] people you know always praise like Lord
[14:47] if if they don't find him alive at least
[14:50] let them find them I've had I've had
[14:56] friends where they lose a loved one and
[14:58] they don't recover the body it's it
[15:02] brings closure to the family even when
[15:04] you lose somebody at least you have you
[15:06] have them with you and it helps with the
[15:09] grieving process so we just want but you
[15:11] know it's not gotten to that point yet
[15:13] but you know we still want to believe
[15:14] God he's miracle working God and he can
[15:17] take care of all things we just wanted
[15:18] to pray to him and let him come on the
[15:22] scene because he always he always does

[18:26] all to you in the name of Jesus Christ
[18:27] we pray amen amen
[18:31] Exodus chapter 17
[18:34] beginning at verse 8 I'm starting to
[18:38] leak already y'all pray for me says then
[18:45] came Amalek and fought with chip with
[18:49] Israel at refitted him and Moses said
[18:54] unto Joshua choose I'll choose us out
[18:57] men and go out and fight with emilich
[18:59] tomorrow I will stand on the top of the
[19:01] hill with the rod of God in my hand so
[19:04] Joshua did as Moses had said to him and
[19:06] fought with Emily and Moses Aaron and
[19:08] her went up to the top of the hill and
[19:10] it came to pass when Moses held up his
[19:13] hand that Israel prevailed and when he
[19:14] led his down his hand Amalek prevailed
[19:17] but Moses hands were heavy and they took
[19:19] a stone and put it under him and he set
[19:21] their own and Adam in her state up his
[19:24] hands the one on one side and the other
[19:26] on the other side and his hands were
[19:28] steady until they going down to the Sun
[19:30] and Joshua discomforted amalek and his
[19:34] people with the edge of the sword and
[19:36] the Lord said unto Moses write this for
[19:38] a memorial in a book and rehearse it in
[19:41] the ears of Joshua for I will utterly
[19:43] put out the remembrance of Amalek from
[19:45] under heaven
[19:46] and Moses built an altar and called the
[19:48] name of it jehovah nissi for he said
[19:50] because the lord has sworn that the lord
[19:53] will have war with amalek from
[19:55] generation to generation and then
[20:00] Malachi 3 verse 16 and it says then they
[20:06] that feared the Lord spake often one to
[20:09] another and the Lord hearkened and heard
[20:11] it and a book of remembrance was written
[20:12] before him for them that feared the Lord
[20:15] and that fault
[20:17] upon his name amen god bless you tonight
[20:19] you may be seated
[20:22] like I said I don't know how this is
[20:26] gonna go but we're going somewhere so
[20:30] y'all just pray for me tonight but I was
[20:36] thinking of the in the in the in our
[20:42] Constitution of the United States
[20:46] our founding fathers wrote a wrote a a
[20:51] passage in there that says that we hold
[20:56] these truths to be self-evident that we
[21:00] have been endowed by our Creator certain
[21:03] unalienable rights and that which is
[21:08] life liberty and the pursuit of
[21:11] happiness
[21:12] that was given to us and you know I was
[21:16] I was thinking on those lines and you
[21:20] know it was so amazing that that the
[21:24] founding fathers wrote that that we have
[21:26] been given these rights by God by our
[21:32] Creator we were given these and you know
[21:34] even though the government has tried to
[21:36] take them away and they tried to do many
[21:38] things but yet these things have been
[21:40] given to us and they even said it was it
[21:43] self-evident that we realized that we've
[21:45] been given these certain rights by God
[21:49] that we have life liberty and the
[21:51] pursuit of happiness and you know it's
[21:54] it was the same way today
[21:56] even though and in the skirt in the
[21:58] Constitution tells you that's what
[22:00] governments came for to watch over these
[22:03] things and you know help protect our
[22:06] rights but you today we have these
[22:10] rights we have we have rights and an
[22:15] alienable inalienable means that they
[22:18] cannot be taken away it means that they
[22:21] have been given to the possessor and
[22:24] there's no way that they can be taken
[22:26] away from the possessor and you know
[22:28] it's the way it's the same thing within
[22:31] the word of God because even when we
[22:33] look it's in the scripture you know what
[22:36] we have these rights that we talk about
[22:38] in the country that we have like rights
[22:40] but you know we have rights not as as
[22:43] citizens of the United States or
[22:46] anything we have rights because we are
[22:48] children of God and we have these rights
[22:51] and you know it's we have been given
[22:53] these by God we have the right to do
[22:55] these things we have a right to come
[22:57] bowed
[22:58] before the throne of grace we have a
[22:59] right to claim what's in the scripture
[23:01] we have been given these rights and I
[23:03] thought it was great the way they said
[23:05] it's in alienable why because you cannot
[23:07] nobody can take these rights away from
[23:09] you if you're a child of God you've been
[23:11] given these rights they belong to you
[23:14] and there's no way that they can be
[23:15] taken away from you God's not an Indian
[23:18] giver
[23:19] they give you these rights and then you
[23:21] can stand on these rights and it says we
[23:23] have been given life well you know we do
[23:27] have life why because we have eternal
[23:29] life he said I come that you might have
[23:31] life and that you might have life more
[23:34] abundantly and not only because he said
[23:36] wherever the Spirit of the Lord is there
[23:39] is Liberty so we have we're living in
[23:42] the time of Liberty when everybody's
[23:44] trying to live in and darkness and
[23:46] bondage but yeah we have Liberty we are
[23:49] living in a time of light we are living
[23:52] in this great freedom that we have
[23:54] because God has given it to us but as
[23:57] children of God because the Bible tells
[24:01] us said we are heirs of God and
[24:03] joint-heirs with Christ that we might
[24:05] suffer with him but we possess the same
[24:08] things that he possesses so if he was
[24:10] free that we're free if he was not he
[24:13] was not bound by anything that we're not
[24:15] bound by anything but thing is as if you
[24:18] don't claim your rights then you can be
[24:20] bound but if you claim your rights then
[24:22] you don't have to be bound and so we can
[24:25] be free and we can pursue happiness or
[24:28] we can pursue the life of God we can we
[24:30] can take the leadership of God and go as
[24:33] far as we want to because you know he
[24:36] said he said that he was or
[24:38] predestinated by our desire because it's
[24:41] not what he wants because it's what we
[24:43] want God's not gonna override your free
[24:46] moral agency he's going to give you that
[24:48] opportunity but you know what if you
[24:50] want to go to a body change then you
[24:51] have the opportunity to go to a body
[24:53] change but you know if you don't want to
[24:55] you don't have to go to why because the
[24:59] scripture Galatians tells us that a
[25:01] child that was born was born a son but
[25:03] you know he had to be tutored he had to
[25:05] be raised up he had to be governed - to
[25:07] come to a place that he could come to me
[25:10] dirty but he was always a son when he
[25:13] was born and you and I are the same way
[25:15] we're born as children but we can be
[25:17] raised up in the image of God we can
[25:19] come to full maturity and God but you
[25:21] know it's our desire we're that we want
[25:23] to make that or not so we have we have
[25:30] that opportunity it belongs to us we
[25:32] have been given those rights and you
[25:36] know here when when Moses was speaking
[25:39] to you know it was so interesting when
[25:41] when Moses is when God tells Moses to
[25:44] write this and write this in a book put
[25:47] this in a memorial to mother and he said
[25:49] he said and rehearse this rehearse this
[25:52] in the ears of Joshua you know right
[25:55] before this time right before the Amalek
[25:58] attacks Israel they are out there in the
[26:01] wilderness if you go back and read the
[26:02] first part of the chapter they're in the
[26:05] wilderness and they're complaining that
[26:06] they have no water they're sitting there
[26:10] drying and they want to go back to Egypt
[26:12] and they're wanting to stone Moses
[26:15] because you've brought us out here in
[26:17] this wilderness to die and wish we could
[26:20] just go back and live in bondage the way
[26:22] we did before when not realizing that
[26:25] God was on the scene God was there to
[26:27] meet and do a miracle in their midst but
[26:30] they didn't see that they didn't see
[26:32] even though God had already done
[26:34] miracles in their midst
[26:35] here he come another time to do another
[26:37] miracle in their midst and they did not
[26:39] realize it and they did not believe it
[26:41] that he had already done miracles in
[26:44] their midst and here he come and then
[26:46] Moses talks to God prays to God and he
[26:49] said take the rod and smite the rock and
[26:52] see if water doesn't come forth and so
[26:56] he smoked the world with the rock in the
[26:57] water came forth but you know what there
[26:59] were a whole bunch of ungrateful
[27:00] Israelites standing in the desert
[27:03] watching water flow out of a rock and it
[27:05] couldn't give God praise and they
[27:07] couldn't thank God for the miracle that
[27:08] happened in their midst and then all of
[27:13] a sudden here comes a maleic attacking
[27:15] them when they'd seen God happened
[27:17] before and then here he said choose men
[27:19] to come and fight and he said write this
[27:23] miracle
[27:24] a book and and go and rehearse it in the
[27:27] ears of Joshua there was something that
[27:28] happened there that that God wanted
[27:31] Joshua never to forget what happened
[27:34] here what happened here because Moses
[27:38] stood on the rocket he told me said I'm
[27:39] gonna go set on the rock and I'm gonna
[27:41] raise my hands and you're going to see
[27:42] you overcome Amalek by the miracle of
[27:45] God with him raising his hands and he
[27:48] wrote that in the book and he said
[27:49] rehearse that rehearse that in their
[27:52] ears why because there was something
[27:54] about that situation that he never
[27:56] wanted Joshua to get away from he wanted
[27:59] Joshua to remember this and brother and
[28:01] sister God wrote these things in the
[28:03] scripture for our examples he said it
[28:06] was to whom the ends of the world are
[28:08] come to this right here what God wills
[28:11] us to deal in this because there's
[28:13] something to us that we need to capture
[28:15] we need to understand we need to realize
[28:18] why because God is the same yesterday
[28:20] today and forever if he done it one time
[28:23] here we'll do it again and so he said
[28:28] write this in a book and he said I would
[28:30] utterly destroy the remembrance of
[28:32] Amalek but he wanted them to write this
[28:36] in a book and never forget what was done
[28:38] here and the word and the word rehearse
[28:47] the word rehearse now when we think of
[28:50] the word rehearse we think the word
[28:52] rehearse means to say again to act out
[28:59] rehearse to say again to repeat to
[29:03] recite aloud in a formal manner to
[29:05] present an account of relate like to
[29:09] rehearse a familiar story to recount in
[29:11] order enumerate something but when you
[29:15] go back and look in the scripture when
[29:17] you look up the word rehearse in the
[29:18] scripture it has a deeper meaning it has
[29:22] a greater meaning when it says go back
[29:24] and rehearse that to in the in the in
[29:28] the Hebrew and from from I don't know
[29:33] how you pronounce it because it looks
[29:34] like sa WM so how are you
[29:37] soum whatever that is but it means to
[29:41] put it means to place means to set a
[29:47] point to make it means to direct to
[29:53] direct to extend something it means to
[29:57] ordain establish found a point
[30:01] constitute make determine fix it means
[30:04] to station means the set in place it
[30:06] means to plant it means to make make for
[30:09] transform into fashion work bring to
[30:13] pass a point to make for a sign to give
[30:18] or to be said so what it means to
[30:22] rehearse something it's not just meaning
[30:24] for it to just to be saying you know
[30:28] because the scripture tells us faith
[30:30] comes by hearing and hearing by the Word
[30:33] of God so it's not just you know when we
[30:36] read that scripture it's not just about
[30:37] hearing the word but it's something that
[30:40] takes that takes place from that there's
[30:43] a transforming power behind them so when
[30:46] he said to rehearse there's a greater
[30:48] meaning in the word rehearse in the
[30:51] scripture when we go back and look at
[30:53] scriptures that talk about the word
[30:55] rehearse when you look that up in the
[30:57] Hebrew a few scriptures so we talked
[30:59] about number one it says that Genesis
[31:03] 2:8 says and the Lord God planted a
[31:05] garden eastward in Eden and there he put
[31:08] the man whom he had formed so work the
[31:12] word put meaning to place him somewhere
[31:14] is the word rehearse and and just just
[31:18] give you a few other ones Genesis 415
[31:20] says and the Lord set a mark upon Cain
[31:23] lest any finding him should kill him so
[31:27] any place the mark upon Cain is the same
[31:29] word as rehearsing there was a placing
[31:33] there in Genesis chapter 22 and verse 6
[31:37] and it says and Abraham took the wood of
[31:40] the burnt offering and he laid it upon
[31:42] his upon Isaac his son and took the
[31:45] knife in his in his hand took the fire
[31:49] in his hand and a knife
[31:50] and they both went and they went both of
[31:53] them together and then in verse 9 says
[31:56] and Isaac a blade the wood in order and
[32:01] bound Isaac his son and laid him on the
[32:03] altar so that's the same word all those
[32:06] are meant have the same meaning as being
[32:09] rehearsed being placed being established
[32:11] being being formed all those different
[32:14] things in Genesis chapter 24
[32:17] when Abraham talks to Eliezer he tells
[32:21] Eliezer he said come and put your hand
[32:23] under my thigh
[32:25] he said eldest servant in his houses
[32:28] that ruled over all that he had but I
[32:29] pray thee thy hand under put I pray the
[32:33] hand under my thigh and you know the
[32:37] thigh in the scripture when you look at
[32:39] the scripture because the Bible says
[32:42] that God was riding on the white horse
[32:48] and on his thigh it was written king of
[32:50] kings and Lord of lords showing power
[32:52] that's where s where your power because
[32:54] if you try to lift or move or anything
[32:56] all comes from the pelvic region which
[32:59] comes from the thigh so that's the
[33:01] reason that was showing authority or
[33:03] power that Abraham had that he was
[33:06] swearing that over showing that he was
[33:08] subject to Abraham this reason he put
[33:11] his hand under his thigh so that's
[33:13] reason he swore that oath that way but
[33:15] all those have to do with having placing
[33:18] something and so it's not when we use
[33:21] the word rehearse it's not just
[33:23] rehearsing something not like we're just
[33:24] talking and telling a tall tale but it's
[33:27] something that we rehearse something we
[33:29] want to place this we want it to be
[33:32] established in you we want the Word of
[33:34] God to be stablished because we want
[33:36] something to take place from that so
[33:38] when we read the scripture it's not to
[33:40] be reading the scripture because we're
[33:42] reading about Moses and Elijah or Joshua
[33:46] or the Hebrew children or anything like
[33:48] that because we want to see those things
[33:50] take place but we want to see ourselves
[33:51] in the scripture we want to see
[33:54] ourselves they're who we are as in the
[33:57] scripture why because those were
[33:58] examples to us that we can see and draw
[34:01] from exactly what they went through
[34:05] now this is from the message raising
[34:09] Jairus daughter brother Branham says he
[34:13] said he said now our subject tonight is
[34:16] a great understanding instance in the
[34:19] Bible and this is where he talks about
[34:22] Jairus coming and coming to Jesus about
[34:26] his daughter and then you know the they
[34:28] come and said don't trouble the master
[34:30] your daughter's dead but you know Jesus
[34:32] said that doesn't matter said when you
[34:34] go home you'll find her she's well he
[34:38] didn't worry that she was dead I mean
[34:41] whether whether she was sick or where
[34:43] she was dead he was still the one in
[34:45] control he was still the giver of life
[34:47] so when he spoke it didn't matter the
[34:49] devil had to leave anyway she had to
[34:52] come back to life he says I love to
[34:55] rehearse his words here on earth and
[34:57] when we when he was here in a corporal
[34:59] body as he hath said that he would be
[35:03] with us and manifest himself to us until
[35:05] the end of the age and the Bible says
[35:08] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[35:10] today and forever and if we can rehearse
[35:12] some of his sentences just before we
[35:15] pray for the sick and declared to the
[35:16] sick that he that do all that he's not
[35:20] dead but alive for we see of his actions
[35:23] and his attitudes in the days gone by
[35:25] then we could expect the same thing in
[35:28] this day now don't you think so if he is
[35:30] the same and he says he said now I want
[35:35] to speak of this I would to God with
[35:38] this lovely feeling of spirit this
[35:41] little group of people here a little
[35:43] group of people tonight if each one of
[35:46] you would get in your mind into your
[35:48] heart that our Savior is not dead but
[35:50] he's alive and present now just as
[35:52] president as he ever was in any age gone
[35:55] by just as present as he was with Noah
[35:58] just as president he was with Abraham
[36:00] just as president he was with the Hebrew
[36:02] children present as he was with the
[36:04] patriarchs and all the apostles and all
[36:07] down all through the age he's the same
[36:10] yesterday today and forever the same he
[36:13] said now let's get that in our minds and
[36:15] remember that he is ever present
[36:17] and there's no creature that could be
[36:19] omnipresent except for God himself no
[36:21] other creature he said the devil is a
[36:23] great force the devil has a great power
[36:27] and the devil is great in his power but
[36:29] he's under the power of God and the
[36:31] devil can only be at one place at a time
[36:33] his imps can be everywhere scattered out
[36:36] his his demons his co-workers but God
[36:38] Himself is alone in his field of
[36:41] omnipresence not an angel but God
[36:43] himself hallelujah then that gives us
[36:46] courage wherever two or three are
[36:47] gathered together I will be in their
[36:49] midst
[36:50] that's universal everywhere so we know
[36:56] that wherever two or three are gathered
[36:58] in his name he said he would be there in
[37:01] the midst and he is in our midst tonight
[37:04] so he is here to meet our needs if we
[37:06] could get that in our mind to realize
[37:08] he's just the same as he was back then
[37:10] he's here to do the exact same thing you
[37:13] know you can't as brother I'm said you
[37:15] can't get worn by a painted fire but you
[37:17] know there's a fire that's here tonight
[37:19] that's just as real as it ever was
[37:21] anywhere else and he's here to meet your
[37:23] needs if you have a need then he's here
[37:26] to meet your needs and you know because
[37:27] if we if we go back in the scripture and
[37:30] we go back in our own lives because
[37:32] that's one of the things I want to talk
[37:33] about tonight if we go back in the
[37:35] scripture and look to see what God done
[37:37] if you will dwell on the things that God
[37:40] has done and not on your problems and
[37:42] not only your obstacles and not your
[37:44] troubles but you meditate on his word
[37:46] day and night and look at what God has
[37:49] said in his word and what this is what
[37:51] the answer is then you know he will come
[37:53] on the scene and the message testimony
[37:56] on the seat you know brother M talks
[37:58] about how the disciples were in the boat
[38:00] together and they began to discuss the
[38:02] things that they had seen with God and
[38:04] because you know and it talks about
[38:06] Peter and the different ones talking
[38:07] about you know there was a time when
[38:09] daddy told us about what went on in the
[38:12] past what what they said and they said
[38:14] we read the scrolls and how they talked
[38:16] about how a messiah was coming and you
[38:18] know we always go back to what daddy
[38:20] said and what mama said but you know
[38:22] today we saw and when he come and he
[38:24] spoke to each one of us individually and
[38:27] how do we have a testimony of exactly
[38:29] what
[38:30] took place and when we you know we were
[38:32] looking for him and then he come visible
[38:34] among us and as they were oh they're in
[38:36] that boat speaking of that thing that he
[38:38] came visible among them and come and
[38:40] spoke to him in the midst of their storm
[38:42] they were sitting there and then he come
[38:44] and spoke to him and said you know don't
[38:46] be afraid it is I why because they were
[38:48] speaking of him and they had their mind
[38:50] on him and you know he came on in the
[38:52] midst no matter what this is what the
[38:54] situation looked like you know he came
[38:56] to their men in their myths and he met
[38:59] there needing done a miracle in front of
[39:01] them so he's the same yesterday today
[39:06] and forever and you know many times we
[39:08] go back and look and we wonder what took
[39:10] place in the past and what took place
[39:13] back there and the different ones but
[39:15] you know the thing is he's the same and
[39:17] we can go back and it really one of the
[39:20] things I want to talk about it I think
[39:22] is very important is to us to share with
[39:26] the young people with our children to
[39:28] what God has done in our lives and why
[39:31] what has happened in our family why
[39:33] because if you can see what God has done
[39:35] you know what God has done in your life
[39:37] then you know he's the same yesterday
[39:38] today and forever you know the scripture
[39:42] Joel 1:3 says tell you your children of
[39:44] it and let your children tell their
[39:46] children and their children another
[39:48] generation so it's important why because
[39:51] he wanted them to expound all of these
[39:54] things never let this drop never never
[39:56] fail but to continue in generation after
[39:59] generation after generation he said that
[40:02] he said what the Palmer warm left the
[40:04] kegger 1:8 and he said they shot all the
[40:06] way down and it continued and you go
[40:08] through joel chapter 1 and can see how
[40:10] bad everything just continues to get
[40:12] worse and get worse and get worse and
[40:15] get worse but you know there's a time
[40:17] and you and Joel chapter 2 but he said I
[40:19] will restore all the years of the
[40:21] cankerworm aid and the locusts and the
[40:23] caterpillar everything has been eaten
[40:25] down he said my great army but he said
[40:27] I'm going to restore that and you know
[40:30] many times we can go back and we can
[40:31] look and see all the things that's
[40:33] happened and yet everything continues to
[40:35] get worse and continue to get worse but
[40:37] let me tell you God is here and he's
[40:39] going to restore he is here to restore
[40:41] because he ascends the word
[40:43] restoration and he's put it in the midst
[40:46] of the people and you know what if you
[40:47] can believe it then everything that you
[40:49] have can be restored it's not just about
[40:55] having bank accounts and having fancy
[40:58] cars and everything like it but let me
[40:59] tell you something you and I have the
[41:01] ability have the spoken word and we can
[41:04] speak life and you know we can have our
[41:06] children we can claim our children we
[41:08] can claim our loved ones we can speak
[41:10] and God will honor our faith and will
[41:13] answer our prayers why because he said
[41:16] he would when we said we talk about what
[41:25] God has done in the past you know we
[41:29] fail to realize what God has done in our
[41:32] midst
[41:32] you know Gideon Gideon was there and
[41:39] chapter six of Judges you know Gideon
[41:43] talks you know and I'm just gonna read
[41:46] part of this and it says and Israel was
[41:47] greatly impoverished because of the
[41:49] Midianites and the children of Israel
[41:51] cried unto the Lord and he came to pass
[41:53] when the children of Israel cried unto
[41:55] the Lord because of the Midianites that
[41:57] the Lord sent a prophet under the
[41:59] children of Israel which said unto them
[42:01] thus saith the Lord of God of Israel I
[42:04] brought you up from Egypt and brought
[42:07] you forth out of the house of bondage
[42:09] and delivered you out of the hand of the
[42:11] Egyptians and out of the hand of all
[42:13] that oppressed you and drave them out
[42:16] from before you and gave you their land
[42:19] and I said unto you I am the Lord your
[42:22] God fear not the gods of the amorite
[42:25] sand whose land you dwell but ye have
[42:27] not obeyed my voice and there came an
[42:29] angel unto the Lord of the Lord and sat
[42:33] under an oak which was in Ofra that
[42:37] pertained under Joe s the ABA's ached
[42:39] and his son Gideon Thresh wheat by the
[42:41] winepress to hide it from the Midianites
[42:44] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[42:46] him and said unto Him the Lord is with
[42:48] thee thou mighty man of Valor and Gideon
[42:51] said unto Him o my lord if the Lord be
[42:53] with us why then is all this befallen us
[42:57] where be all his miracles which our
[42:58] fathers brought us of told us of saying
[43:02] did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt
[43:06] but now the LORD hath forsaken us and
[43:08] delivered us into the hands of the
[43:10] Midianites and the Lord looked upon him
[43:13] and said go in this thy might that thou
[43:16] shalt save Israel from the hands of the
[43:18] Midianites have not i sent thee and he
[43:21] sent unto him o my lord wherewith shall
[43:23] I save Israel behold my family is poor
[43:26] in Manasseh
[43:27] and I am the least in my father's house
[43:29] and the Lord said unto him surely I will
[43:31] be with thee thou shalt smite the
[43:34] millions as one man I tell you what know
[43:38] that if I don't light your fire your
[43:40] woods wet because here is here is a man
[43:45] that's living and you know a year after
[43:48] year after year the Midianites came in
[43:50] and stole from them and they were
[43:51] impoverished and they're starving to
[43:54] death and they have nothing and here
[43:56] there they keep going through all of
[43:58] this and they're crying out to God and
[44:00] all of a sudden a prophet comes into the
[44:03] land and the prophet speaks unto Him and
[44:05] he tells them exactly what took place
[44:08] before here he is he brings up the word
[44:10] it says did you not come out of Egypt
[44:12] did you not come out of bondage did you
[44:15] not come out from all of these things
[44:16] and you came into the land and not only
[44:18] did you get victory over your enemy but
[44:20] you received their land then here you
[44:22] are in this midst and now you've allowed
[44:24] another enemy come in and take
[44:26] everything from you then he said an
[44:29] angel of the Lord come before Gideon and
[44:32] stood in his mess and told him that he
[44:34] was a mighty man of Valor and Matt
[44:36] Gideon couldn't believe it
[44:37] look oh look at look what condition I'm
[44:40] in oh we're starving to death
[44:42] my family's poor in Manasseh and I'm the
[44:44] least in my father's house he said how
[44:46] can i how can these things meet but he
[44:48] told him he said you know what he said
[44:50] I'm giving you the word that you can
[44:52] overcome that you're gonna be the one
[44:54] that's gonna do these things and he said
[44:56] it's gonna be just as if there was one
[44:58] man
[45:06] it's so amazing that here we are and we
[45:08] received the word we've we've had a
[45:11] profit in our age we've received and in
[45:14] the angel of the Lord in our day and
[45:16] he's come and he spoke to us and he's
[45:18] given us the word of overcoming
[45:21] everything that you have need of the
[45:23] answers of every question has been given
[45:25] to us all the things that you need for
[45:27] this earthly journey has been given to
[45:29] us you know there was a there was a time
[45:32] you go back and look and you look and
[45:33] see what what leuthar went through and
[45:35] what Wesley and the different ones you
[45:37] know they had mad problems and and
[45:39] things and they didn't have the full
[45:41] word and all there but you know what
[45:42] we've been given a full word in our day
[45:44] we've been one because God has called us
[45:47] to this God has called us to be the ones
[45:49] there's not going to be another group
[45:51] come up behind us we're the ones that's
[45:53] going to carry this thing home to the
[45:54] rapture
[45:55] why because it has been spoken God has
[45:58] given us the word he's given us that
[46:00] Commission to take it home there's not
[46:05] gonna be another another group come
[46:07] behind us we're not looking to another
[46:10] age why because we need to realize this
[46:12] is aging which God is dealing with
[46:14] people say oh I wish I lived in Bible
[46:16] days you're living in the greatest Bible
[46:18] day that you can live in why because he
[46:22] laid everything out for this day this is
[46:24] our day and he come to this one and you
[46:26] know what brother Branham said if I
[46:28] could live in any day he said I want to
[46:30] live in this day I'd want to live in
[46:32] this day well you know what brother
[46:33] Branham came and done his part he can
[46:35] field fulfilled his Commission and now
[46:37] you know what he laid a commission out
[46:39] before each one of us and you know it is
[46:41] our day to do the same we after we have
[46:45] to come and fulfill our Commission you
[46:51] know we can be just like just like
[46:53] Gideon you know why is all these things
[46:54] but following this why do we have all
[46:56] these different problems and why we have
[46:58] all these things why because God wants
[46:59] you to get to a place that you can get
[47:01] to a place that God can come on the
[47:03] scene when your brother Graham said the
[47:06] church always the bride always done
[47:08] better under persecution why you've got
[47:10] to have problems you gotta have stress
[47:11] you gotta have things lay down before
[47:13] you why because if you don't you don't
[47:15] trust God
[47:18] there ain't no there ain't no
[47:20] such thing as an easy war there's no
[47:22] such thing as an easy battle I always
[47:27] talk about Abbott and Costello which
[47:31] everyone was a habit to I guess they're
[47:33] Costello I can't matter which one it is
[47:35] but you know the comedian little short
[47:37] felt God you know he's all otome out he
[47:39] was in the army and you know how turned
[47:41] he was told him he told the other guy
[47:43] said you know he said he said I was in
[47:45] the battle he said I was where the
[47:46] bullets were the heaviest he said oh
[47:49] really he said where was that he said
[47:50] under the ammo truck yeah people want to
[47:58] be people want to be there but you know
[47:59] they don't want to be where it's where
[48:01] the where the battles going on they want
[48:03] to try to find someplace to hide but
[48:09] unity they would you know what they you
[48:11] got to realize you've got to go through
[48:12] troubles and trials and heartaches and
[48:15] problems why because God wants to work a
[48:20] miracle in your life and those are the
[48:22] things that takes place that you have to
[48:24] trust God
[48:25] you know nobody nobody wants to thank
[48:28] God when they're on we're on the front
[48:29] side of the the trials and the
[48:32] tribulations but you know when we go
[48:33] back and you look and you see what God
[48:35] has done for you you know we can we can
[48:37] worship God on the other side but we
[48:39] can't see that God's working on this
[48:40] side when he's working on the front side
[48:43] of these when God is working on this
[48:48] side and we can see the things that's
[48:49] taken place what God is doing we don't
[48:53] we don't see that God is working in our
[48:55] midst and
[49:04] you know there's many things that I want
[49:07] to look at tonight but I don't want to
[49:10] be here too long but you know I want I
[49:13] want to get to this point because I
[49:16] wanted to look at one thing because you
[49:18] know if we can see what God has done in
[49:20] our lives and what God has done for us
[49:23] then you know we need to rehearse that
[49:25] we need to bring that up and you know
[49:26] the thing is is you you have children
[49:28] sometimes and they and they they read
[49:30] the stories of the Bible you have young
[49:33] people they read the stories of the
[49:35] Bible and they wonder where that God is
[49:37] is that God real and you know many times
[49:41] we don't we don't express in our own
[49:44] family what God has done that God you
[49:47] know because we think well you know I'm
[49:49] the only one and we fail to realize what
[49:51] God has done in the past in your own
[49:53] personal families you know many times we
[49:56] don't we don't look back and we think
[49:58] well you know why does God done in my
[50:00] life what God has done in my family and
[50:04] you know sometimes when you sit down and
[50:05] God shows you things that's taking place
[50:07] you know and then you realize you know
[50:09] God has been all along the way how did
[50:14] you get here
[50:17] you know if you know because you had to
[50:21] come to look a certain way there had to
[50:24] be certain people meat for you to come
[50:27] to be where you are today and you know
[50:30] if it hadn't been for for the grace of
[50:32] God and the mercy of God the leadership
[50:34] of the Holy Ghost to do the things that
[50:36] he done you wouldn't be here right I
[50:41] mean you know there's people come from
[50:43] other countries that that come to come
[50:46] here and all of a sudden they meet and
[50:48] and you know all of a sudden and then
[50:49] you're here how did how did that take
[50:52] place you know people who don't realize
[50:56] that you know I think about my
[50:59] grandfather my dad's dead you know he
[51:04] served in he served under General Patton
[51:06] in World War two he was a combat
[51:08] engineer Richard can tell you some of
[51:10] the stories he landed on a beach and
[51:14] Europe I think it was 53 or 50
[51:17] four men hit the beach and he was there
[51:20] was only one or two of them that
[51:21] survived of that whole thing multiple
[51:25] times they were building they built a
[51:27] bridge back three or four times and
[51:28] every time they had it built the Germans
[51:29] would bomb and they had to go in there
[51:31] rebuild the bridge and he had a steel
[51:33] plate fall on him and land it on him and
[51:36] he had to lay under that and pretend he
[51:37] was dead after everybody else was dead
[51:39] and laid there until the Allied scum and
[51:41] got the metal off of him so he could get
[51:43] up he told us about being in a battle
[51:47] where the bullets were flying at them
[51:48] and he said the angel of the Lord stood
[51:50] before us and he said he said because
[51:52] the bullets were coming in our direction
[51:54] and he said the bullets were going to
[51:56] the left and to the right he said you
[51:58] could hear the ricocheted off the
[51:59] bullets going out of our direction he
[52:01] said it he said it should have been us
[52:07] and say we think you know how did how
[52:10] did I get here why because it was the
[52:12] grace of God that I'm here why because
[52:16] he had to survive that for me to get
[52:20] here and we and sometimes we don't we
[52:25] don't think and stop and think you know
[52:27] what miracles that has happened in our
[52:29] lives that God has to come and you know
[52:32] and then we start to look and you see
[52:34] how God has moved in your life and we
[52:36] sometimes we fail to give God praise and
[52:39] glory for the things that he's done in
[52:40] our lives well because we can see help
[52:45] my dad in the situation he's in you know
[52:48] when my mom when when Levi was little I
[52:51] don't know how many years ago it was but
[52:52] you know I mean they told they told my
[52:54] my dad to go ahead and make her funeral
[52:57] arrangements you know because when she
[52:59] got that infection in her neck and got
[53:01] so low that she had organ failure and
[53:03] everything else and you know and they
[53:05] wanted they wanted to write her off and
[53:07] you know dad that wouldn't do that and
[53:10] you know and and the doctor told and
[53:12] said I don't even know how she's still
[53:14] alive and dad told him said it's because
[53:17] of the prayers of the saints that she's
[53:19] still alive and the doctor said you got
[53:21] to keep doing that because that's the
[53:22] only thing keeping her alive well you
[53:25] know what's the same it's the same God
[53:27] that was there that they're protected my
[53:29] grandfather there was
[53:31] Stover my mom that's in the hospital
[53:33] with my dad tonight now we can sit there
[53:35] and we can say you know and when we
[53:37] don't we don't understand how well he's
[53:39] going to get you know what God's already
[53:41] come on the scene when they tell you
[53:42] that if they don't do surgery he's gonna
[53:45] die and they're not even sure if you do
[53:47] surgery that he's gonna survive and all
[53:49] of a sudden that man's laying in a
[53:50] hospital bed and he can talk to you and
[53:52] he knows who people are and he knows
[53:54] things that he you know and he still got
[53:56] a long way to go but you know he's a
[53:57] miracle laying in that bed when a man
[54:00] wants to live when a man wakes up every
[54:01] single day and only thing you can talk
[54:03] about is going home and eating food you
[54:05] know the man's ready to go but you know
[54:13] we fail to give God praise and glory for
[54:16] the things that have happened in our
[54:17] lives because many times we don't take
[54:19] and sit down and take a count of what
[54:21] God's done for us and actually sit down
[54:23] and look and count our blessings you
[54:26] know there was a there was a song years
[54:28] ago and it said if you take a piece of
[54:29] paper and and you draw a line down the
[54:32] middle of it and you know you need to
[54:34] write all your problems on one side and
[54:36] all your all your blessings on the other
[54:38] and it says you'll always find that your
[54:40] blessings outnumber your troubles every
[54:43] time you know many times we have we
[54:45] don't ever take an account of doing that
[54:47] and see what God has done for us and
[54:49] actually putting down in paper what God
[54:52] has done for us I was thinking about
[54:54] brother Ryan writing those little books
[54:56] of testimonies of what people have done
[54:58] and you know one little testimony what
[55:01] people wouldn't God has done in people's
[55:03] lives and you know many times we have
[55:05] failed to sit down and actually take a
[55:07] full account of what God has done for us
[55:09] every single time in our day and our
[55:12] daily lives to see what God has done you
[55:15] know I was thinking about when Adam was
[55:17] Adam before Adam was born you know Sarah
[55:20] had a lot of bleeding and you know they
[55:23] really thought that she might have
[55:24] miscarried and you know we didn't know
[55:26] if he was gonna make it or not but you
[55:28] know what we committed him to the hands
[55:30] of God we told brother Dale and you know
[55:32] we prayed and we believed and you know
[55:34] what God brought Adam here he's here
[55:37] tonight but you don't we didn't have we
[55:39] did not know what was going to take
[55:40] place but you know what it's not not
[55:43] living in fear it's knowing who's got
[55:45] everything in control who who's holding
[55:47] tomorrow who's holding you who's holding
[55:50] everything and you know you trust God
[55:52] that he can come on the scene and meet
[55:54] your needs
[55:55] why because you know you can you can
[55:58] worry and you can fret but you know what
[56:00] there's nothing good and worried there's
[56:02] nothing good and fretting there's
[56:03] nothing worried and worrying about
[56:04] anything
[56:05] why because you've got to put in the
[56:06] hands of God and watch him come on the
[56:09] scene you know I think I told I told him
[56:14] I said we went through trying to get a
[56:15] mortgage on this new house and I told
[56:17] him I said you know when we get through
[56:19] this thing I may just get up in the
[56:20] church and run around for a while I
[56:23] wanted a shout so bad it was why because
[56:25] you know you deal with one mortgage
[56:27] company and they don't they don't know
[56:28] split peas from coffee grounds and
[56:30] they're trying to loan you money and
[56:32] it's like how in the world y'all in
[56:33] business and finally we just we just
[56:38] dropped in we don't listen we got to go
[56:39] find someone else somebody else in this
[56:41] world's got to be better than them well
[56:42] you know what anyone much better I told
[56:46] Sarah I was like hey you know what if we
[56:47] don't get the mortgage we're just gonna
[56:49] go rent a place because you know what
[56:50] God don't want us to have this house but
[56:54] you know what
[56:55] there was a ho you know we prayed about
[56:56] I prayed right as like Lord if this is
[56:59] your will weed then you work it out
[57:00] right but you know we sit there and two
[57:05] days with our second mortgage company
[57:07] and I mean they wanted everything they
[57:09] wanted so much stuff from us that I've
[57:11] never heard some all the stuff that they
[57:13] wanted Sarah finally sent her shoe size
[57:14] with him when the Nate won one of the
[57:16] emails they listed everything else that
[57:18] she won't and she put what size shoe she
[57:20] wore the guy that worked for the
[57:21] mortgage company he wrote back ha ha ha
[57:26] there's like well everything's online
[57:28] they know everything about you they know
[57:30] what you know you go online and look
[57:32] look up something you search the next
[57:34] thing you know then you get emails home
[57:36] stuff that you looked at nobody else
[57:37] knows about but they know it they know
[57:39] more about you than you you let them and
[57:41] when they run a background check on you
[57:44] when they run your name and everything
[57:46] for your for your mortgage and it says
[57:49] this person is known by all these other
[57:51] names in something I didn't know people
[57:54] knew me by that
[57:57] but you know what somewhere in some
[57:59] computer that's what you're listed but
[58:02] you you look at all the things that you
[58:04] that you have to go through and I was
[58:06] amazing then in two days before two days
[58:08] before we closed
[58:10] they said everything's good you're good
[58:12] to go everything's great okay praise the
[58:13] Lord we finally went through this way
[58:15] you're wiping switch great sigh of
[58:18] relief then they come back and said oh
[58:19] no you owe us some more money it's like
[58:23] you know what the wells run dry I don't
[58:27] know where you plan on getting any more
[58:29] money and it's like well guess what
[58:31] we're gonna have to postpone as like
[58:33] listen we've already been down this road
[58:35] because originally the way it was set up
[58:38] we were going to close on one house and
[58:41] buy the other one so we were going to
[58:43] sell our house in the morning and buy
[58:44] the other house in the afternoon and
[58:46] guess what we wouldn't have to do
[58:47] nothing move from one house - together
[58:49] well they didn't work out that way next
[58:51] thing you know we're having to find a
[58:53] place to rent for three weeks trying to
[58:55] get this resolved then we had to drop
[59:00] the mortgage company and get another
[59:02] mortgage company and they were like well
[59:04] we're gonna try and get you by the 10th
[59:07] of October where we're not sure work and
[59:11] he's like well you know what we've done
[59:12] a lot of prayin and Sarah would come
[59:16] home and she's like well I don't know
[59:16] what I'm gonna do I don't know what you
[59:18] gotta calm down you got to calm down
[59:20] she's like well I'm so worried I'm just
[59:23] you gotta calm down and you know because
[59:27] as soon as she would come in the house
[59:29] and she would be so frustrated with
[59:32] stuff that you know it just feets
[59:34] through the whole house then everybody's
[59:36] frustrated and everybody's like I know
[59:42] y'all don't have to deal with that but
[59:42] we do
[59:44] but you know it's like just calm down
[59:46] you gotta trust God but you know it's
[59:49] hard to trust God when you when you see
[59:50] the things and it's like is there gonna
[59:52] is there any light at the end of the
[59:54] tunnel is there no way out of this mess
[59:56] are you ever going to get anywhere and
[59:59] then after you go through I'll listen
[1:00:01] then two days before you close
[1:00:03] everything's good and they call you back
[1:00:04] so oh we need more money it's not gonna
[1:00:06] work out
[1:00:08] but what do you mean and it's like we
[1:00:13] didn't then they were saying wait we're
[1:00:14] gonna have to wait till Friday it's like
[1:00:16] no we're closing on Thursday
[1:00:18] it's Thursday or no deal we got to close
[1:00:21] on thirsty and they told us well that
[1:00:25] don't look like it's gonna work out that
[1:00:26] way I was like well you know what we're
[1:00:28] just gonna put this in the hands of the
[1:00:30] Lord and let the Lord deal with it they
[1:00:36] told us we needed more money so we have
[1:00:38] a very generous brother here at the
[1:00:40] church who decided to make a little loan
[1:00:43] to us till we get everything
[1:00:44] straightened out pop it on over here but
[1:00:51] you know and then it's like well you
[1:00:53] can't do that because he's not related
[1:00:56] to you
[1:00:58] money's money they didn't want that they
[1:01:02] liked that idea so here we go we're go
[1:01:04] back to square one what are we going to
[1:01:06] do
[1:01:06] but we haven't we had an awesome realtor
[1:01:09] and she's like I'm going on vacation
[1:01:11] this lady that's selling you're selling
[1:01:16] the house to you is in the process of
[1:01:18] buying one and she's got everything
[1:01:20] lined up and the only problem with all
[1:01:22] of this working out is your mortgage
[1:01:24] company so she told us that this ain't
[1:01:26] going to work she calls a mortgage
[1:01:28] company and tells them listen y'all cut
[1:01:30] my commission on the selling of this
[1:01:32] house by enough money to cover the extra
[1:01:37] money that they need to close on this
[1:01:40] house and she said I'll take less money
[1:01:42] in the mortgage on my commission so we
[1:01:44] can get this thing worked out because
[1:01:45] everybody else is waiting on y'all to
[1:01:47] get your act together well next thing
[1:01:50] you know the mortgage company called us
[1:01:52] back and told us the man that was doing
[1:01:53] the mortgage he called me back he said
[1:01:55] I'm almost in tears he said I thought
[1:01:57] that was so
[1:01:58] your Realtor account and she wanted to
[1:01:59] take cut her Commission and get all this
[1:02:01] thing worked out and then she said he
[1:02:04] said well we're going in there and
[1:02:06] they're reworking the numbers so it's
[1:02:08] like oh well good we'll see what happens
[1:02:10] see if this thing will work out they
[1:02:14] tell you how God moves not only did our
[1:02:18] realtor get her full Commission the
[1:02:21] amount of money that we had to take to
[1:02:23] closing was three thousand dollars less
[1:02:25] than what they originally told us what
[1:02:27] our mortgage closing cost would be that
[1:02:31] comes from them telling us you can't
[1:02:34] close on Thursday because you don't have
[1:02:36] enough money to them giving her her full
[1:02:39] Commission and we were three thousand
[1:02:41] dollars less than what we had though and
[1:02:50] I tell you what if you don't if you
[1:02:51] don't yeah if you go through all that
[1:02:53] and you and you're just ready to wring
[1:02:55] your hands and you just and I told
[1:02:57] myself we're just done with this I said
[1:02:59] we're ready to walk away from this house
[1:03:00] I just not gonna deal with it I'm just I
[1:03:02] just can't and all of a sudden next
[1:03:04] thing you know that worked out I was
[1:03:05] like you know what I go to church I
[1:03:06] think I'm gonna dance the challenge in
[1:03:08] the in the aisles I say you know you go
[1:03:12] through that and fight two mortgage
[1:03:14] companies and go through all that and
[1:03:15] eggs saying you know you you feel like
[1:03:17] you know you all of a sudden God comes
[1:03:19] on the scene and works things out and so
[1:03:21] I praise the Lord I want to get up and
[1:03:22] dance awhile because you know God it was
[1:03:27] it's a miracle what God done for me and
[1:03:29] you know you you can't you can't thank
[1:03:31] God enough and it's you know things like
[1:03:34] that that you know we don't give God the
[1:03:35] glory we don't give him enough honor we
[1:03:38] don't give him enough praise of the
[1:03:39] things that he's done you know I want to
[1:03:43] give him all the praise the honor and
[1:03:45] glory all the things that he's done for
[1:03:46] me why because he has done so much and I
[1:03:50] have been so blessed that I if you know
[1:03:52] words cannot be expressed we don't have
[1:03:54] the human language you've never
[1:03:57] expressed what God means to us but you
[1:03:59] know if we can sit down and we think
[1:04:01] about what God has done for us all the
[1:04:03] blessings that we have received in this
[1:04:05] life all the things that we that we have
[1:04:07] been through in this world you know you
[1:04:11] think about
[1:04:12] I think about where that man was brother
[1:04:16] Ram told that man about how hard it
[1:04:17] wasn't difficult for him to come come to
[1:04:19] the meeting or come to come to where he
[1:04:21] was that and you know that I asked him
[1:04:23] said well what was the problem he said I
[1:04:25] got in the car and I drove there but
[1:04:27] brother branham could see in that other
[1:04:29] dimension what took place you know many
[1:04:32] times we don't we don't say we just we
[1:04:33] just think well you know we wonder why
[1:04:36] things happen the way they do and you
[1:04:38] know many times we don't realize that
[1:04:40] God's been protecting us and the things
[1:04:44] that God has done to watch over us and
[1:04:46] many times we find out later that God
[1:04:48] has protected us and you know because
[1:04:50] you know there's times at work you're
[1:04:52] working on something and you don't see
[1:04:55] the danger you know it's just like
[1:04:58] brother been talking about Branum
[1:05:00] tabernacle he said he said where they
[1:05:02] had the fire the furnace in the end the
[1:05:05] church originally he said the rafters
[1:05:07] and everything were burnt back for
[1:05:09] several feet and he said how in the
[1:05:11] world he didn't fall under all that snow
[1:05:13] and everything he said it should have
[1:05:14] collapsed and you know you're at work
[1:05:17] sometimes you're working on something
[1:05:18] and you don't see the danger and all of
[1:05:19] a sudden you just walk around like
[1:05:21] nothing's going on and all of a sudden
[1:05:22] realize you know that thing should have
[1:05:24] fell on me sometimes it's not braced
[1:05:27] right sometimes sometimes you forget to
[1:05:29] bolt something up sometimes you put
[1:05:33] weight on on a frame or something that's
[1:05:35] not bolted right I've had I've had
[1:05:42] acetylene torches malfunction
[1:05:49] they had a man in Charlotte many years
[1:05:52] ago that had a malfunctioning acetylene
[1:05:58] torch and it backed up into the from the
[1:06:01] torch head it backed up into the the
[1:06:03] regulators and it calls one of the say
[1:06:06] the regulator's to explode and they said
[1:06:09] the knob on the front of the regulator
[1:06:11] when it blew off had the velocity of a
[1:06:13] 30 off six and killed him
[1:06:17] and you think and you think about the
[1:06:20] little things like that and you know the
[1:06:22] data is that you know we think that
[1:06:25] they're little but you know what there's
[1:06:26] a there's a real danger there you know
[1:06:30] and there's things that happening and
[1:06:32] and all of a sudden you realize later
[1:06:33] you know what God was watching over us
[1:06:35] that these little things have happened
[1:06:38] all the things that God has done in our
[1:06:40] lives where God is watching over
[1:06:41] sometimes we know that God has protected
[1:06:44] us in Oh times we don't realize the
[1:06:45] danger that we've been in we don't know
[1:06:48] until when these days that we're gonna
[1:06:50] see the other side and see all the
[1:06:51] things that our guardian angels had to
[1:06:53] do for us that how many times God has
[1:06:55] protected us and watched over us and all
[1:06:57] the things that God has done for us how
[1:07:00] blessed we are you know not just not
[1:07:03] just in our and our daily walk but in
[1:07:05] our Christian walk how God has blessed
[1:07:07] us and and brought us to the place that
[1:07:09] we are today because God has given us
[1:07:12] eternal life he spoke to us and come and
[1:07:15] went found us and brought us and drawn
[1:07:17] him to us to himself and then he gave us
[1:07:20] his own life you know filled us with the
[1:07:24] Holy Ghost and then blessed us at all
[1:07:26] spiritual blessings brother and said we
[1:07:28] are now sitting in heavenly places
[1:07:30] because we are a child of God because
[1:07:33] God has given us because he said because
[1:07:34] we are heir of God and joint-heirs with
[1:07:37] Christ and now sitting in heavenly
[1:07:39] places how blessed we are to see who we
[1:07:43] are and what God has done for us
[1:07:45] and you know and not just not just to
[1:07:48] talk about what God has done for us but
[1:07:51] to really lay a hold on what God has
[1:07:53] done for you and know what God is doing
[1:07:56] for you and what God wants to do for you
[1:07:58] God wants to bless you and you know

[1:08:06] God is here to meet your need you know
[1:08:12] we are so we're such a blessed people
[1:08:13] and sometimes we become relaxed to what
[1:08:16] God wants us to do
[1:08:17] we don't have the fervency as brother
[1:08:20] branham said the angel the Lord told him
[1:08:22] said and you need to be more sincere and
[1:08:27] you're looking at looking at the life
[1:08:29] that brother Branham lived you know he
[1:08:30] didn't say well you know I'm doing this
[1:08:32] and I'm doing that no look at all the
[1:08:33] stuff he said lower Lord let me be more

[1:10:17] this passage of Scripture forward for we
[1:10:19] sing it says blessed the Lord
[1:10:21] Psalms 103 says bless the Lord O my soul
[1:10:23] and all that is within me bless His Holy
[1:10:25] Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget
[1:10:28] not all his benefits who forgiveth all
[1:10:31] thine iniquities who healeth all thy
[1:10:33] diseases who redeemeth thy life from
[1:10:36] destruction who crowns thee with
[1:10:38] loving-kindness and tender mercies who
[1:10:41] satisfies thy mouth with good things so
[1:10:43] that thy youth is renewed like the
[1:10:45] Eagles the Lord executed righteousness
[1:10:48] and judgment for all that are oppressed
[1:10:50] he made known his ways unto Moses his
[1:10:53] axon to the children of Israel the Lord
[1:10:55] is merciful and gracious slow to anger
[1:10:57] and plenteous and mercy he will not
[1:10:59] always chide neither will his anger keep
[1:11:03] his anger forever he has not dealt with
[1:11:05] us after our sins nor rewarded US
[1:11:07] according to our iniquities for as the
[1:11:10] heaven is high above the earth so great
[1:11:12] is his mercy toward them that fear him
[1:11:14] as far as the east is from the west so
[1:11:16] far hath he removed our transgressions
[1:11:17] from us
[1:11:19] like I say father pitieth his children
[1:11:21] so the Lord Pelias them that fear him
[1:11:24] for he knoweth our frame he remembereth
[1:11:26] that we are dust for as man his days are
[1:11:28] grass as a flower of the field so he
[1:11:31] flourished it for the wind passes over
[1:11:33] it and it is gone and the place thereof
[1:11:36] shall know it no more but the mercy of
[1:11:38] the Lord is from everlasting to
[1:11:40] everlasting upon them that fear him and
[1:11:41] his righteousness unto children's
[1:11:44] children to such as keep his commandment
[1:11:46] and to those that remember his
