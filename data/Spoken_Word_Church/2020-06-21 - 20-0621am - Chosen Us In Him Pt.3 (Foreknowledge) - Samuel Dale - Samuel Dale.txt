your scriptures turn to Ephesians where we've been at one we will try to continue our own from dark - there were once a Happy Father's Day for all the father's appreciate it they have a visitor I guess back there a couple of visitors so we say to you welcome you know always to come one time here you're welcomed as a visitor two times you just part of us because we don't have anything to join or anything like that all right but we had a real good time up at the mountain there with all of the kids and the fathers and not things and doing and I'm from heard the sisters had a good time over where they're doing so they got to get out and and go to this time so we're we appreciate it and you know glad they did that everything's going to do that remember brother Bob will be ministering for us Wednesday keep that in mind and then waitl announced the services for not just coming up weekend but it'll be the next when the fourth of July and getting all of that together Josh wants to meet with the ministers back at his bench back there evidently you just want to get it prayed for or some I don't know hopefully you've got something for him okay and he didn't explain it he just said he wanted to meet with the ministers and you know I probably we need to do that and need to do that part of the brain okay but remember that okay that should be all of the announcements for the that we just appreciate the Lord being so good to us in the day and time that we're here and you know having a good time in it okay visions one the Lord Jesus we thank you for all things and thank you for your love and your grace you're honest on to each one of us thank you for you and we just asked you to guide us and keep us and I love and let our light shine into our hearts that we may see you as the word unfolds unto us that we may walk into that word and have Lord joy and peace in our heart with you as we're fellowshiping one with another around the word of the hour that we're allowed to hear have your way forgive our sins lead us by that understanding bless the sick among us just remember each one in order that your love and grace be there we committed to you now in Jesus name I mean visions one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ this would be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him remember dice are thought chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word have a good good crowd this morning glad to see everybody out that the Lord would would open our understanding and help us all to to see alright we've been on this in Ephesians a couple of services where you own it for a little while continuing on but I want you to think about what we've been talking about and you know to give lined up and get everything in order to understand called we read in the scripture that it says that that he has chosen us in him if we say but yet but we chose him now we didn't choose him he chose us you say yeah I did I accept no you accepted him as your Savior you didn't choose him you accepted him as your Savior and doing that then that puts you into the body of Christ and puts you as part of the chosen but remember now that what we're dealing with is trying to get an understanding to be able to follow the line of and going into adoption and that you know with a little bit we got last Sunday but we'll try to get a little more today and then just continue on gradually as we're going along because that's what we want to cover all right what was ours what has been our thoughts though to cover bringing about the part of really dealing with predestination everybody's scared of that word you know the word predestination it means destiny determined beforehand that's the definition of predestination and see everybody thinks well well what is the predestination are we predestinated this way what are we predestinated here what are we alright we're going to get to it today and I want to make sure that you follow it in the line to where we'll know because to me there's only one way to understand predestination and that's by the basis of what it is that God never predetermined anything to be other than his word now hold that until we get back to that later other than his word caught is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word our seed all right we believe in a predestinated see the predestination word okay but people have to receive eternal life to have eternal life you didn't come into the world with eternal life cause if he did then Jesus Christ died in vain that put us in to a different position all right but now in doing that then we've used the background of a couple of messages to try to comprehend a little thought that you have two basic thoughts in the religious realm it's called Calvinism and Arminianism all right that's basically big so it builds up the religious rim you know this has this this has this all right Calvinism and Arminianism two thoughts to where we can understand why we're here and what's going on to me that's the only way we're gonna understand predestination because we can't put predestination as we'd used to do basically that's a Baptist Presbyterian even into the Catholic doctrines and things of predestination and everybody wants to make it predetermine this way for you sir all right but now remember one thing God does not predestinate by his desires he desired that everybody be safe he made a way for everybody he left it for everybody to work that they can do it that's one of the emphases that you place upon it in Calvinism and Arminianism is Calvinism is a put it on a basis that you know it's a you know how nothing to do with it he just God just chose you and took you and and made you what you are and and put you to a point and then just predestinated and just pushed a button and sent you through life him making you do all right then arminianism will cover on the basis of what we would call works I don't do this I don't do that I don't we'll cover those signs a little more as we go along but the main point I want you to think on is C we say Paul was the Calvinist I want that thought Paul was a Calvinist because he believed in this he believed it in in salvation you know vind are all right but now listen to what Calvinism says Calvinism says that only a chosen group of people are to be brought to salvation I'm just giving you an overall view from looking at the dictionary and looking up to walk Wikipedia ever how you doing and picking up the thoughts but the Calvinism puts it to the basis that you know it's this finished it's done it's a set thing and God just picked who he wanted and only the predestinated are considered in salvation all right now our median is imported on the basis of that all our is open for everybody now this that's two of the thoughts you'll have to get in your dictionary sometimes if you want to do it but that's that's the point that it'll make that they see Calvinism says all right I'm just gonna save certain people and only the predestinated elect is included in salvation in any form well now let me give you a thought see there's truth to those signs Calvinism has truth arminianism has truth all right Armenian is and see on the other side basis that the salvation is for everyone and and but you must bring yourself into that situation of understanding it I just want to give you a thought now if if it's only further predestinated are the elect then what are you going to do with your foolish version virgins Matthew 24 25 what are you gonna do with your fifth seals you what are you gonna do with your people of that form and understanding so you can't have it as a stamped thing that's it it's done it's finished only the elect it's considered in Redemption there'll be Redemption when we leave out of here God will turn from us as the Gentiles and turned back to the dispensation with the Jews and it bring in those people and you'll bring in though the part there's a foolish version of us it that will be brought into that point to be given eternal life one day and I like that so you can't stamp it on the point of Calvinism I was just saying only the elect can be saved now you run into that into message people so that's what I'm asking you the question what are you Calvinism arminianism which one are you well I didn't know what this underneath I didn't know it mattered well we're on the basis of one side of the other so you know the understanding of most most of people of the message I come here with this predestinated seed I'm this I'm a seed I was this before the world I was that see making it a Calvinistic form of salvation whereas then you got the other groups in the message part that would argue we you know it has to be on the basis that we all choose and we've got to fulfill our religion and live our salvation and do it and both of those things are true they're both true but yet brother Branham now I'll give it to you later brother Brown says the book of Ephesians is the most wonderful book he said because it takes the two sides and brings it together in the middle all right now see then Calvin had his doctrine but that wasn't what Paul was teaching Kalvin probably claimed part out that but that was not what Paul was teaching Paul was teaching the truth of salvation the Calvinism and in the basis of of doing it well you see it had never been a doctrinal issue until they come up to the ire and it wasn't a Peter I mean excuse me it wasn't James and Paul arguing over predestination or anything like that it was the truth of the gospel of the hour they were living okay the Apostle Paul was taking it and looking from the side of what God was seeing of Abraham and how he would accept him and do what he was doing and it brought that in and that's the truth see James was taking it on the basis that he said show me your faith without your works he said I'll show you my faith by my works alright people want to argue that point they think James were saying one thing and Paul was saying something else no both of them were teaching salvation because there's a truth to the point that the chosen is the chosen right there's a truth to the fact that we must work out our own salvation with fear and trembling there's a truth to each side but putting it together by the book of Ephesians he said that's the most wonderful book of all he said called it takes that and brings it together alright now we're going to see the Lord willing in the next few messages picking it up and going into predestination we're going to see that the book of Ephesians is a valuable book because it shows the truth of predestination it shows what God was dealing with but remember my point now I'm trying to make a point with something because see people don't think I don't know about his own life see if we get our ideas our concept we have blamed Paul as to the basis the religious world says he was a Calvinist because he was rich laying a lot on grace and in salvation of that way and then they say well James was a legalist see an Armenian well both of them had truth all right but yet you got to put them together if you can get it together in the middle of the road then you don't have to worry about cause if you don't you're gonna go off one way or go off the other way all right see there's a truth to salvation to the point that God chose us right but then there's the truth to salvation to the point that you accepted God as your Savior all right you accepted what his editors were supposed to live a Christian life huh that's not legalism that's not that way but God has to use those things see Martin Luther was leaning more over onto the Calvinistic form of salvation all right here comes John Wesley as a legalist in his works because John Wesley had a lot of you know don't do this don't do that and all in his teachings all right because it was sanctification all right and see one was taking it one way and one was taken to the other one but both of them had truth that's my point that's what I want us to look at the Bible as as we see the Bible as it it doesn't take a one-sided view of something it gives you the straight truth of it salvation is of the Lord Jonah 2 & 9 okay we we believe that the fact that you say well I chose God well you didn't choose God God chose you cause no man saw God at any time the Bible says you say yes I did I've been a whole service on that trying to explain it to what we look at or what we're talking about yes we did cry out we prayed we fasted we sought after God we done no signs our butt it was the goodness of God that led us to do those things because we were not that's not the salvation upon alright the goodness of God leads us to do those things okay and that's that's fine but that doesn't save you because God is calling you remember only the called can be brought forth okay alright but putting that C together now we can get a picture and that's what I want us to take with the book of Ephesians is to take a look in there and follow that line not of Calvinism and Arminianism that was just a background for you to get to understanding out the way that I believe in well look the Bible has one way of saying something but we have blamed it for a lot of things we have taught it said this and we've taught it said that and it don't even teach you I've heard people say the Bible says and every trouble set on its own bottom well where's that in the word it's an illustration no point but where's it in the word no see we've said the Bible taught this and that's my point of sailing mankind have said Paul was more of Calvinistic and then they try to pick out what church would fit into that and basically the Baptist would fall in under part of Calvinistic works alright those men had great understanding but remember they were in their day and time they did not have it put together in the right order so they would take one side of it no they would take the other side and then to argue their points and how meetings and and all kind of things to to discuss it but it didn't work out but here comes a prophet in the last days to be able to show us the truth from God's Word and said at all in order and that's why we believe it like that and believe that God sent Malachi for promised it because it would straighten out the the fallacies of mankind and his religious belief well I wanted the Prophet say he said Calvinism is the point that looking at what God sees and he seen the faith of Abraham and a different thing he said but Arminianism is the basis of what man sees about what Abraham done our Deborah Ham did do this and didn't do that but remember both of them is telling the truth but I want D to write C then we can take the book of Ephesians and and put it in there and in a parallel Joshua because Joshua and the Old Testament was a setting a part of the land and getting the children of Israel divided up and putting in position to be the people of God so part it parallels that in that it explains it but see then there's the truth to it then you say well what about predestination well Steve what about predestination it's in the Bible we just read about the predestination in Ephesians yeah but I don't believe in predestination now what it is you don't believe what mankind mankind has taught you about predestination mankind has taught predestination until on some sides of it it is just a it wipes out Christianity you know and then you follow the people of this message and they come right on up into believing those times and will quote you things to try to show you that there was predestinated well okay that's fine it's in the Bible it's a truth that there is a destiny set in the Bible for each one of us but yet if we don't get it together in the correct way of understanding we make it God doing something when it's not what he's doing see then you you you you hang up on predestination this Mike you hang up on Calvinism and Arminianism you can't figure out what's going on but remember put them together and they'll come forth with a beautiful picture of the the plan of redemption God had a plan and a purpose we'll get back into that chrysler mystery if you'll read it God had a plan and a purpose he was going to see it achieved but then he turns right around and says now God didn't predestinate by his desire because he desired everybody to be saved but he knew everybody wouldn't right then he could say but for some reason whatever in the book of Romans where he said you know but Paul bringing out out Jacob have I loved and he saw how I hated alright now we got that figured out he hated did he hate Jacob where can you bring the word hate from a eternal loving God right see people don't think like that where can you were can you fathom our bring some word to be able to in the English language or any language in the world to be able to bring it to the point that God could hate Jacob no love Esau hey Jacob I mean hate he saw where can you put it so you don't think like that you don't think you think well I just I've got the Bible says it then he loved Jacob and hated Esau well now you've got me to argue with you on one point cuz hang on argue with you about what's being said Oh Jacob and Esau I'm going to ask you a question where did the word hate come in for God where did you get the right to put a word in our that would be have anything to do about hate no he hated the ways of Jacob he's coming he's owning and love the way to check them because of their doing and that's where you pick up your army in and and Calvinism but you see you got to get it in the right order because if you don't it's got to be put together where can you bring any form of hatred from an eternal God well God hate no no no God hates the sinner no God don't hate us in him he died for he loves the sinner he hates his ways right see then East all God could look down and see what he saw would won't and that's what God hated but he could see what Jacob wanted and that's what he loved do you when you bring it together it'll bring a beautiful picture but the book of Ephesians brings that together to where that you don't deal with the word P destination in what we'd think about it well it's predetermined for me to be that way and I can't do nothing about it now where's that in the Bible where's there anything in the Bible that God predestinated something to the basis that he didn't give them a choice he gave Cain a choice the God doesn't predestinate by his desires really in essence he predestinated by your desires because he looks at your desires of what you won't he looked at Jacob and saw what he wanted he wanted to birth rock he saw didn't care he didn't have no value to him what but you see then we we get to the point then of looking at predestination well there's got to be something about predestination that excuse me for coughing they'll get preaching sometimes and the whole call first starts working okay but listen what are your ideas about predestination well I believe I'm a predestinated seed I come straight from God be careful now cause that's Calvinism well I believe that I was so good and I live my life so good until God come down to save me now you're Armenian and neither one of them will put together the picture but both of them together will bring out the picture of what salvation truly is so then as we start off on this I want you to - now I want this message to be laid in there of understanding how does God predestinate he can't predestinate by his desires because he would be a UH he wouldn't fit the picture of God because He desires everybody to be safe so they can't be on the basis of what his desires is he didn't like you better than like the others like that's something that we think we're worth were so good you know we're so goody-goody we didn't know what Calvinism we didn't do this we didn't I I didn't drink and smoke and chew and and do all of those things so God saved me now that's Arminianism - you're gonna follow one side of the other but if we get into the truth of it we can see it and then follow the line there's only one way I make that statement with with the point of the prophets message to back up the Bible to come out to make one statement there's only one way God could predestinate and not be contrary to his own word or will he said boy you're making a strong side I'm making a strong statement because I invite you to come and let's talk about it so then you say well how does God free - God predestinate by his foreknowledge now which come first ain't in the chicken and the Thunder which come first this predestination come before or for knowledge or for knowledge before predestination which way is it see that's why I don't mind saying and putting out to you what I believe because I want you to know what I believe [Music] well I believe so and so I've always believed this about this on predestination I've always believed I just a predestinated person I can just feel it I was just I know I was back there well how did you get back there all right but God predestinate by his foreknowledge now he can predestinate Jacob and Esau run by his foreknowledge and he doesn't have to pick one and reject the other he allows mankind to do his own life he doesn't make you do anything the Lord made me get saved no he didn't he just made you to the point that you wanted it he didn't make you get saved there was no such thing but God did predestinate in a way that the thing the Bible says the thing formed can't say why did you make me this way because God never made us that way that's what I've always told you my brothers Methodist minister but he believes he said God made me a sinner with desires and lust and said he can't condemn me for having him I see didn't make you like that he made your own self mortal life puts you into a situation but yet you got a lot a choice to do away with those things and get away from it but see God predestination by his foreknowledge those who he foreknew he did predestinate alright which comes first then predestination no foreknowledge foreknowledge has to enter the picture and as it does for knowledge takes the book of Ephesians and puts it together to show you the truth of understanding the predestination it's not a bad word once you understand what it is it simply means destiny determined before him well God determined to save me so I can't help it I'm gonna be saved it don't matter what I do now be careful you're walking on thin ice you can't blame God for the situation that we're in you know I know Cosi that was always been a doctrine among religious people is predestination that is is one thing that has split the probably the one thing most of all to split up the churches is the doctrine of predestination and see that's what I'm saying some some people believe that well well God saved me I don't do it well you got a crew there but what if you didn't accept it what if he didn't accept it so let's just think about it let's read some things and then we'll we'll get to it and you'll know that that's at least we know where we stand on what we believe you know we have company back there and hope that they understand what we believe without me having to explain I believe that God sent a prophet in the last days promised it in Malachi 4 Luke 1730 revelation 10 7 etc etc and you know we don't make the Prophet God he's not God he is the prophet of God or was he's passed on but he taught us a message and that was what he was coming to do was from Malachi 4 to return the faith of the fathers back to the original Word okay that's what we're wanting to do is to turn back to the book of Acts in other words turn back to the book of Ephesians to where we can take the book of Ephesians and and put together predestination to the basis that it it it will be a beautiful picture but just remember where it's all comes from and then when you finish don't ask me later well brother you know you're gonna know caught them on read to you that I'm a firm believer in God's foreknowledge I believe that's the only way God can predestinate without being a respecter of persons as I said in the scripture that I was quoting a minute ago the same form can't say why did you make me this way so you can't argue with God about how come you're here what we are we made our own choices we chose our lives ourselves we're choosing them right every day in our own sails but don't you think that if there is an eternal God if there is that's a question to you not to me if there is an eternal God can he not keep his word straight if you can't keep his words straight then ain't no need in serving him why serve him if he can't keep his word straight if he's not uh you know setting that's the word is it but we need to get it together in the truth so I so according to Ephesians that we read it says that he chose us in him chosen us in him before the foundation of the world having predestinated us unto adoption now let me make a statement is going to be a slap you know how I do it I'll slap it out real quick sometimes to get you to think we notice what it says are he predestinated us unto adoption well the Dobson is welling up in the statue of a perfect man you don't start your journey as an adopted child of God you start your journey as a child a baby walking in the word but he predestinate sus unto adoption in other words he knows what's going to take place right so let's just think about predestination and let's take what the prophet has to say and then that way at least you'll understand what I'm talking about so go ahead with number one I'm an excuse me number five according with number five on the notes that we got because I want you to take these things I want you to listen to what he has to say these are questions and answers in jeffersonville any in it alright my precious friend now you can read up back and I put it all out to her predestination before the world begun alright my precious friend let us turn to Ephesians the first chapter for just one place we won't take too long all right let's start reading here to fees in the first chapter the first thing I want to say that that predestination is a bad word for a minister to use before an untrained congregation now watch what he said I like that the way says it's not a bad word to use when the congregation is trained so when I get through with this you'll understand one thing you may not agree with me but in the next few services you're going to learn one thing I believe in for knowledge I believe we are predestinated by foreknowledge I believe for knowledge comes before predestination predestination is a destiny going that away coming from your foreknowledge all right so you're gonna know what I'm talking about you know you may not agree with it but that's alright we're gonna have it it's gonna be we'll be trained for one time you can match the kids say what brothers they'll believe he believes for knowledge you know they'll at least be able to say it that way sometimes here at the church without an out as he's talking about I always use the word for knowledge because predestination is only the foreknowledge of God Jesus is claiming straight on predestination is only the foreknowledge of God God be an infinite by foreknowledge he knew everything or he is an infinite thing he knew what would happen so by foreknowledge he could predestinate that's the reason that I believe that God you know does it like that so what are we starting off as to be in how does God predestined by his foreknowledge now he predestinate cause he loaded now that making predestinate and by his desires then you desire to everybody to be saved so you're in trouble but he can predestinate you say yeah but I I believe predestination was just hold on we're gonna have a long series of services back through predestination to eventually learn what foreknowledge is really talking about alright so think about it by foreknowledge he could predestinate now for knowledge is knowledge beforehand is that as a Webster definition I mean we just being plain that means for knowledge means a knowledge is beforehand are before taking place all right so then God predestinate not by the desire he wanted you saved he paid the price for everybody in the world right but what's wrong with any predestinated is certain on weightless let's don't make him predestinate that away let's take it and stick on what we're talking about predestination means a destiny is predetermined alright I'll bring that I believe the Bible speaks of a predestination I believe that there are some predestinated unto election and some predestinated under reprobation right I believe that because the Bible says that but if they ain't careful I'll cross my own self up and see I believe that he loved Jacob hated Esau but that's what my point he didn't hate Esau as we know we take the word hate when I like it over in Genesis our worry repented that he made man you remember that well who do you repent to if we just believe in one God who did he repent to but it says it repented God he what he sees that he didn't make him wrong but he sees our wrong right he knew what we would do the minute he created us that's the infinite God he knew Adam and Eve would fall no no he had see the arsy pre-business he had to wait let's fail for he knew anything about it ours your your pre destinations from your Calvinistic and Armenian doctrines alright but think about it go ahead let's read a few go ahead Jehovah Jireh now there's a doctrine of predestination which is rotten nonsense I like evil he just like me I try to be like him because I try to be plain in that way you don't have to worry about it you don't have to worry about what I you don't have to worry well well what brother Dale what do you believe I done told you what I believe I believe in predestination by foreknowledge and I believe that's the only way God can pre determine anything to be without being a respecter of persons is to be by his foreknowledge he then that'll come together in the whole truth in whatever really is a true predestination God by for knowledge could predestinate because he has foreknowledge God is not willing that any should perish but being the interval and God knew who would perish and who were not that's the reason he said before and before Jack Evaristo was born he hated Esau and lo Jacob his foreknowledge let him know that he saw was a shyster and he let him know that Jacob respected that birthright you know what I like away we've read a Wrentham talks about thing he puts it into the places at one time I'm just straighten honest now so just listen Jacob was a better guy than he saw her I was just getting my words right he's always a better guy peace all loved his daddy took care of his daddy worked herself to death with his daddy he was a greater guy so when he says that he saw was a shyster you know Jacob was a shyster his very name is tripper up her he was a he was he do anything him and wanted to laymen and oh brother Ernie gets into about laymen and and Jacobs getting into dealing with each other you know but listen get the point of what you're talking about he saw was a shyster the only thing you got against he saw us he didn't care about his birthright now you gotta admit that he was a good guy he done everything right except he didn't care about the birthright now you know me anything else that he saw was guilty of see that's where we don't get it in the right order you know that came was a great guy you know that came love God you know they came worship God came brought an altar he worked yourself to death and Abel late over under a tree and let the Sheep grow then went and slit his throat and paid the price but the point of it is one of them knew the story the other one he was just human right let him know the D sold of shyster let him know that Jacob respected regardless of how he got it he stoled it now see that's that's what gets me yeah I I'm sorry what's the island when I bring it out like that I think about you mean God was setting up start looking downing and he says he saw you're the finest guy you've done everything right everything's perfectly in order but I hate you and then he sets up there and all in the world Jacob is doing is a tripper upper or Steeler a thief a con artist and God looks down and says Jacob I love you you know I don't make God sound too good but is it true did it happen I mean is it true but see then we've get into the story of realizing God was looking at those two boys to see one of them had his mind on the birthright he didn't care how he got it he stoled it he tripped up he done everything in the book to get that birthright that birthright is the top of the baptism with the Holy Ghost right I used to tell him I said I'm a when it comes to this message I'm a I'm a shyster we used to go to Jefferson building and they'd be the printed of books and we'd have be there for service you know and and they'd print of five hundred books and they'd be a thousand people well you know we never went that we didn't get a book or two yeah I've done it many times look up there and see him running out of books and I just deliberately walk off the back and I like I was looking for a seat you know trying to do something you know looking around trying to find something and they'd be taking those books out of the things and hand out and they'd just get him a handful of books and I just reach over to get a handful of books and I would go back up to where I come from and I pass them out down the aisle we got books every time you know why because I'm a shyster I wanted that book but I swear I look at Jacob and Esau he you know he give away what one was his birthright and the other one was the inn and he just come away well here comes Jacob and he had one thing in mind I'd love to have all the benefits that goes with this I won't have but my main idea is to get that birthright because if I've got it I've got everything I wanted well you know what I love about God you know maybe you don't think I love to read the Word of God like this you know what it was all said and done oh he saw man if Jacob would have hung around I regret when it first happened he'd have killed him I mean he's after him he to kill Jacob for what he done but you know what Jacob goes off gets over here goes through the whole line brings up a family comes to walking back and hears Esau Jacob the whole time thinking I gotta face that oh boy he gonna cut my throat he gonna kill me said maybe I can appease him you don't read the Bible like that he said maybe I can appease him so he had his family divided up in bands I don't know what that meant how many was each one but he said okay send this group before it's in this group next rescind this group maybe after getting a little wild me giving him all this stuff he won't cut my throat well you know what I'll I take it was a tripper upper yet God looked at his heart Esau he wanted that old boys throat but somewhere in that journey some started dealing with him the god of glory started dealing with him and you know he wound up to be a pretty good we want all this predestination we went all this seeds these ideas and time when it's all finished Esau comes running to his brother Jacob says take all of this I'll give it he said look I got more you got I don't need your stuff let's just hug each other's neck and get over this you know something took that he wound up not being too bad a guy we don't see those stories we'll attack a one-sided story about oh hey Garwin no earner son and we look at it wha that's unsavable that's him oh that's the mold surface seeds and whoa things predestinated Hagar sound learned she says son takes him over and sets him down we're doing right about the middle of her pity party she's having and being done and finished God says hey y'all wait up look over there look over there so there's some water and says now what I want you to do now check your Bible see if I'm right he told Hagar he said you go back down there now Sarah done run her out right you know I don't think she's nice to her I said you go down there and you be under subjection see we don't read the whole story I'm sorry that's just my way of looking at things because see I'm looking at like Calvinism and Arminianism which one are we are we grace and disgrace are we works and same time which one are we you know the brother brother said Martin Luther said he was more on the side of Calvinist because that's why I got so far down you know what they really got down there where they wouldn't even have revivals the Calvinistic doctrine got so tired of hmong they wouldn't even have a revival because they was afraid God might save that kid and him not wanting to save him that's the doctrine of Calvinism now how would you feel if you say well we're gonna revive we have no revival God might say some of our kids well what do you mean that's what you won't let's say we don't look at it that way we study the one-sided view of what we won't we study it to the point that we want to follow Jacob God this puts a wheeze on right in there and it scared him along and blesses him and gives him all oversight and turned his heart to where he don't want to kill his brother then we don't read the whole Bible we read what we want to read yeah but I I can't see nothing in that I mean how can you see anything well Hagar when she was just that old bad woman well God told us if you go get the water let's then go back down the owner and set under Saira gonna be obedient to it you know what you don't hear anything thrilled about eh well turns out to be a good guy see that's what my point is what are you getting at I'm getting at one thing we can argue all day long on predestination well I've got these quotes and I got these scripts I got this we'll have you got a truth that lines up so I can take predestination and if though you are way out and send us all over to here and realize we're all up in heaven we're running around up in there little bitty people just having a good time before the world all lean into it cuz only in God's mind that's what's your prophet saying so we're gonna have to hold that we're going to hold a port then when we come into predestination that you're only going to be dealing with God's mind now you've got it different than what people try to teach it oh if I was dark and then mmm others had to serpent seeds in time they're not dark what about it see I believe firmly that is one thing about it God's predestination can only be by foreknowledge anything outside of that I'm getting on the wrong side of that word I'm pre determining and I'm doing things that I shouldn't be doing with it but if I can keep it by his foreknowledge well that's bad this we talked for knowledge in the Baptist Church we talked predestination in the Baptist Church if brother dick Addison was sitting here today he'd say we taught it in the Presbyterian because that was one of their dog French that's predestination but a lot of people think about predestination they walking along in life and someone will fall down so I'm glad I got through with that because that was God predestinated me to fall well I'd rather think about that he's always trying to keep me from falling you know it's the better way but that's alright alright so we're we're let's go to number what do we get number six or let's go to number six place here we get because this is the point that I want there really is a true predestination godbye for knowledge could predestinate because he has foreknowledge God is not willing that any should perish but being the infinite God knew who would perish and who would not that's the reason he said before and Oh Jacob have a love Esau hated what about it what about it going to number seven let's get a few this from either this is taking trying to do God a service without his will but God has his word set and has in all ages now what's him his foreknowledge has caused him to set in the church his for knowledge caused him to set in the church there is some things in the church that are said come on we're going to get back to it one of these day you know that the gifts of God you got nine spiritual gifts in a church that's not predestinated eternally but you've got a fivefold ministry that's predestinated you better study your prophets message if you don't want to study that way you better study Malachi 4 because Malachi 4 is predestinated come on because it's not a person it's a word it's the seed come on and the people certain things that he did from the beginning and then the gospel that's being preached to that age is only revealed to that certain people the rest of them don't see it that's true thank thee father that I have hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed it to such ins would learn see that's predestination not that he did it by you say I'll choose you and don't choose you by his foreknowledge he knowed what you would do now he's got it on the basis of foreknowledge go ahead number eight things that are to be the foreknowledge of God can predestinate make everything work to his honor when that predestinated seed that you wish to be and God called you and that little ego of a seat in there oh this is all we want to read we don't want to read anything of foreknowledge all we want to read is a little Eagles and little stories and how he was and what we was before the world and what is doing but remember one thing here's what he's talking about they heard the Word of God it will build on top one word on the other just remember if there's anything about you that's worth anything it's this word ain't nothing else worth into you you and me it don't matter we all come from the same mold we may be different colored skins we may be tall and short and fat and ugly but we all come from the same mold right God has a reason he has a reason any predestinate succour denies foreknowledge God had a plan I keep going across the ministry God had a plan and a purpose he was going to see it and see okay where does it go to go ahead to the next one I want you to notice he does it in that way in every age now listen to it he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers and then in order to how believers to meet that word I want you he's got to predestinate it to that age there's no problem well I mean he said it to it I know he said it the word you see he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did it get it did you feel it did you see it do you understand it that's what happened what happened today he predestinated it to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestinated anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so when he predestinated anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's going to be there going to be a rapture she's going to be there he predestinate sit by his foreknowledge see there's nothing going to stop it 1 the foreknowledge the foreknowledge lay on foreknowledge let's get a few right here that connects together go ahead which one well number 10 all right look at the wording now watch the wording we didn't come through all of it you know that God knew from the beginning in and God is to make it everything the clock tick you know but remember God's clock will be just exactly on time all these things has to be that way it has to all be done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge four-by-four knowledge he could predestinate not by his desire but by his knowledge God doesn't predestinate by his desire he's not willing that any should perish but by foreknowledge he knew who would accept it and who wouldn't see he predestinated by foreknowledge so he could predestinate he can set a destiny well now if he sets the destiny I don't have to do it Oh remember one thing he saw it before you've thought it so don't get all tied up and how goody-goody things are running he knew before the world what you and I would do because he knew in his mind his foreknowledge then he could set a destiny he could have a seed forever age his last couple we read a seed forever age predetermined yes be called that he knew what they do he knew you'd want the word so you know what he had it for you he knew you'd want salvation you know already had it for you he knew it okay go ahead number eleven hold it up you can read all in between I just give you that part God's not willing that any should perish but they're all would come to repentance but in order to be God he had to know and the word predestinate is used in Ephesians predestinate there isn't a good word it means in speaking of predestination to the people sometimes leads them to the thing that God has predestinated you to push you through a little pop or something that's not right predestination looks back to what foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destiny now how does he know your destiny he predestinated my destiny I've got to do this I can't help it uh-uh wrong thing he saw you do it I said simple to me foreknowledge is God before the world knew he was going to make mankind a whole thing he had in his mind we'll get back to that from Christ's ministry I ask you to read that message and and it'll it'll tie together to show you the whole beautiful picture that God before the world he looked down and seen what you'd want just like he knew what Jacob would want he knew what you'd want he had it for us by his foreknowledge then he could set a destiny sure we ever one of us everybody in the world has a destiny a determined point at the end you would call it or whatever everybody has it because what God's foreknowledge he knows what we're gonna wind up and do but he knows why we're doing it cuz come on therefore God being God before the foundation of the world knew that who would be saved and who would not Roman Dave he could say that he hated Esau and loved Jacob before either child was born for by foreknowledge he knowed what a little shyster there that he saw would be and how he would save Jacob so therefore by foreknowledge God knew those things he for knowledge everything is for knowledge okay alright let's read a couple then we'll quit go ahead what do we got now it's number 12 as well stated look predestination looks back to foreknowledge now get that in your mind we're gonna give you about four or five quotes of the same statement the point to get it in your mind which comes first did he predestinate and then his foreknowledge coming or was his foreknowledge and then he would predestinate an end by his foreknowledge of knowing what that end would be which one is it which comes first for knowledge always comes first predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks own to destiny God in the beginning could see all things and that way no come on foreknowledge he wasn't willing that the left side would be wrong coffee knew that this would be he didn't want that to happen but so so therefore he could foretell what would be and he knew the end from the beginning that wonderful and to think that ever born again child of God deny has that privilege and assurance to know that God knoweth his own you say yeah but but brother Dale to discipline it note for knowledge I don't get no thrill out of just this foreknowledge you're not reading when he's saying for me to realize that God before the world ever begun in his foreknowledge you ever NAT that would ever bad it's I that's an infinite God and he would know whether I'd want to be saved or not and you know what he would come to the basis of what I want I like oh brother Tom far boys had a way of saying it like there he said you trigger your predestination that was this point you trigger your predestination you know how you trigger your predestination he knows exactly what you're going does but is what you're gonna do yeah I'm gonna for the next few services I'm gonna be laying heavily on one line you say but brother Dale we didn't have nothing to do with it God done it all you got a truth what you see if you didn't accept it God is not going to override your free moral agency and make you accept it so I draw the house of desire for God a desire and realize that before the world ever begun God would look down and see my desire you don't never think about time he was talking the other day about it you know I'm not bragging I just didn't drink I didn't smoke I didn't do those things he just it just wouldn't nothing for me I had the opportunities of doing out of all people around with with liquor or beer stuff in my car to keep him getting caught set it out and I'd go on my way Lissie I just didn't want it we ever thought about that God was setting the fire looking at that and said well you know what he didn't want that he's gonna wait a minute now you're crossing the line no I'm not crossing the line I'm her I'm walking the line I'm walking a line between works and grace grace is what God does for us works is what we do for him put them together and what you got a fine line that God looked down and realized what you would want and he come down to give it to you that's gonna be nicer for services okay so foreknowledge looks back and says that he foresaw this and knows that the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning and therefore knowing that all those marvelous days that we're living in now and to stand and witness and see the things that we've seen God had to make a preparation for it you realize they some sitting in this building today that sit and saw prophets all the works and the signs and the wonders that's a wonderful thing I would love to been able to do that they might not have changed their partner but I'd love to have done it that's a joy you know what what if that has something to do with your salvation no salvation of the Lord no God don't pick and choose as we make it he picks and chooses by his foreknowledge as to know what you will do right he knows what you will do what you won't do as always a type of person that I could understand how that maybe this is a point of thought I could understand how that you've liked in the old days you know they take a handkerchief and they get mad at each other and they slap each others face with a handkerchief next morning they get out what turn shoot each other well I used to think about that I always had a problem and I couldn't couldn't keep that problem straight in one because I didn't want you slap in my face man our woman it was just I didn't because that's a disgrace that's I can understand why they kill each other because that's a disgrace they're just disgracing your name to think they're doing that because they're slapping you and I always wondered I forgetting save was my salvation good enough to keep me from if somebody slapped my jaws and I start work one day and the man he got to pinching me on the legs and doing I sitting on the table running a job he worked for me because I was the inspector and he'd come by and pinch me I said don't do that I said don't do it and he just live long well I caught him sitting on the table I walked over there and I said now don't pinch me no more do you understand these looked at me and I just took my hand on his knees if you ever had anybody do that to you if you don't hurt somebody sitting on the table just put you hand it on the knees and just come up real and snap it real quick and they'll come off the table because they're hurting in their legs and I meant to my point was I meant for him to understand don't pinch me no more he came off that table and he slapped me and I thought hmm and I stood out and looked at it he looked at me that's while he just turned walked off cuz I was standing there thinking hey I believe now I understand it I don't want nobody else laugh in my face again you know the prove the point I just I just got to the point I believe my point was proved that that I could take it a little while he came back up her and we just was friends from then on but you know what he never paints me again you see you say well what are you doing I'm saying one time sometimes God allows us to go through trials to find out about how much how well we said we are and don't you think his foreknowledge brings that up before you his foreknowledge that allows you to go through things to her that he can let you see who you are you know it wasn't for God that he gave Abraham the trial right he wasn't a benefit of God for Abraham to have a trial to offer his son it was a benefit of Abraham because Abraham found out he would do what he would do and God found out he'd do it and what I love about brother Brown saying about Abraham he said God knew Abraham and he said he knew that he teach his children oh that's always better you realize you're raising your children do you realize that you're instilling in your children the nature you want them to hell you realize this is within your hands to do those things so do it right for God okay come on he's not willing that anybody but get the point I've got the others here but if you want but just remember I'll he ended up saying this which comes first then did God predestinate something to be no he looked down through time and saw what would be he didn't predestinate it to be he saw what it would be but he saw that he could change us and fit us into a mold because that's what I believe about Christianity I believe the statue of a perfect man is molding you into an image of Almighty God that's the reason I believe what it says there to start with he says he what predestinated us unto adoption adoption of the statute perfect man he predestinated a group of people in this last days to come to that maybe everybody else didn't get that but this group today has got it she will come forward she'll be that come on musician but think about it cut it all on pointers I want you to say please come first godbye for knowledge for knowledge he could look down through time and see what you want he saw what Jacob was he saw what he saw was he saw their desires of what they wanted then he worked according to that we were to thank God for a trial that he would allow us to go through it allows us to go through trials and things to build our character in times and we ought to thank God for it let somebody ring you jobs to see whether you can take it on let somebody say something to you to see whether or not you pray for the person around back up the God by foreknowledge predestinated a destiny now are you listening foreknowledge predestination then if it's said of any form you think then it's automatically got to first go back to his foreknowledge because you can't predestinate you a sinner and then condemn you for being a sinner I agree he can't predestinate you to be a sinner but he can for about for knowledge allow you to go through life and seeing what you would be he can set a final destiny because he knows what you do you know what maybe you ought to think about your salvation there's people that would kill you at a drop of a hat there's people that would do anything in the world for you which one is God looking at you say yeah but now wait a minute you're making the owner work no no I've done been through all that we don't go that away but he knows exactly what your end will be but you know what you don't know it you don't know it until you come to the end of it then when you're finished you'll look back and say God was with me all the time he was there all the time and all of my heartaches and troubles he didn't predetermine it to be he knew it would be he's there because he knows what you have need of you don't get nothing out of the message get one thing predestination if anything you look at and think about it being predetermined just remember it automatically got to go back to its for knowledge because dire is where it comes from that's it's in order the motion and if you follow that line you might find out that there is a lot to do with us and the Bible says to work out your own salvation but it says we can't we can't work out our salvation but it says we've got to work out our salvation then we've got a lot of things in the Bible that takes looks like it's just splittin going in every direction but it'll come together to make a beautiful picture you work out your own salvation you have something to do with your life every day no God no no no God allows you and I a life to be lived he likes to see what we're gonna do with it so what are we let Stan you say yeah but use a funniest guy I've ever heard of salvation cuz you sound like one thing it goes this way no remember they'll come together they'll come together if you just give it enough time and work it out okay go ahead run breezy Heavenly Father I appreciate you of you bow down before Heavenly Father i apprec holy spirit anybody got a need to me holy spirit you're a bummer to me leave me [Music] Jesus just touched our little buddy take away the hurtin and the things we know they had to do this for heaven now you come on the scene take away the pain and the agony isn't a thing that everything be all

know that's kind of sold in the throats and this pray that God will take care of that pain you know just take care of that pain and things that he has and it'll all be alright those God knows what we have need uh see that's it's for knowledge which one you drew the how the destiny set and something mark no let me live let me live my life walking one day at a time walking into the word of god I'd rather go that away than have it set in predetermined because that way he's given me a choice choose you this day whom you will serve he's given us a choice let's walk in it father we just thank you
