[10:26] amen and uh well we really appreciate
[10:30] brother Samuel Dale for his uh
[10:32] continued burden to the bride of Christ
[10:35] in the Philippines and uh
[10:38] I know you are always part of it and let
[10:42] me tell you this morning that we miss
[10:45] brother Wade's presence last year we
[10:47] were expecting him to speak for our
[10:49] church anniversary meeting but we always
[10:52] do that every year but by the way the
[10:54] End
[10:55] Amen so you still have another year if
[11:00] the Lord Paris we do that every second
[11:03] Sunday of March
[11:05] and also better Nestor that's it first
[11:09] week of March and uh it always go use uh
[11:14] good to go there end of the month
[11:16] because every first Monday of the month
[11:19] weekend monthly ministers meeting and in
[11:22] that way you're going to meet a lot of
[11:25] ministers more amen so of course I
[11:28] appreciate about the team Whitener for
[11:30] accommodating me because I've been
[11:33] otherwise I will be hanging for a week
[11:35] somewhere
[11:37] amen and he drove me here uh I just
[11:41] realized it's it's not it's not close
[11:45] amen so
[11:47] uh
[11:49] because there are certain things I
[11:51] always stay here you know and this is my
[11:55] second home away from home and I always
[11:58] stay with brother Sam's Place and of
[12:01] course I missed that I missed that Bass
[12:03] Pro Tour this year
[12:07] amen but if the Lord tires I'm gonna
[12:10] make it next year
[12:11] Hallelujah so well uh the the harvest is
[12:17] ripe amen and uh everywhere we go God is
[12:21] always guiding us to new open doors and
[12:26] uh
[12:27] the the things that he had opened not
[12:30] only in the Philippines but also in many
[12:33] parts of Southeast Asia where I have
[12:35] been involved well as I have been
[12:37] telling you I have been involved in
[12:39] Indonesia for uh say more than 10 years
[12:43] 2003 we started going there
[12:46] and uh we started having three
[12:49] establishers at that time in separate
[12:52] Islands too far from each other but for
[12:55] the very first time at that time we were
[12:56] able to conduct joint meetings and that
[13:00] started the role and in 2004 we
[13:03] conducted this mystery Exposition and it
[13:05] earned a lot of good result and now the
[13:08] good thing the Brethren are doing they
[13:10] were out of their shell doing the
[13:13] Mission Works and uh that's the main
[13:15] purpose that we always do because as the
[13:17] prophet said let the native save and get
[13:20] the native save and let the native
[13:22] preach to his own people you know so we
[13:24] don't we're not building any Kingdom we
[13:27] just want to promote God's kingdom
[13:28] everywhere we go and the way I see it in
[13:31] Indonesia now we have more than a dozen
[13:34] churches over there and uh well uh
[13:38] rooted ministers God has produced or uh
[13:41] for years and uh now they're they're
[13:45] willing and sacrificing also to reach
[13:47] out and out of the 90 percent of 250
[13:51] million uh yeah
[13:54] Muslim amen we have churches over there
[13:57] and more than a dozen probably more than
[14:01] 20 we include some of the small house
[14:04] meetings
[14:06] but the Lord has opened up new doors
[14:10] I think two weeks before my trip to the
[14:13] U.S I was able to make a follow-up in
[14:16] Myanmar and there's a lot of good things
[14:18] going on in Myanmar because way back
[14:21] three four years ago it was still under
[14:24] military Junta and you see soldiers
[14:28] everywhere and it's not easy to travel
[14:30] because the moment you step on the
[14:32] immigration you have to you should have
[14:35] a fixed itinerary and you cannot stay in
[14:39] the believer's house you need to go back
[14:41] and they check you if you go back in the
[14:43] hotel and it is so expensive to go there
[14:45] but the Lord has opened up recently just
[14:49] last year
[14:50] the U.S is so active now in uh in in
[14:54] Myanmar it has opened up a lot and I
[14:56] believe it also opened up doors to the
[15:00] to the message of the hour and uh praise
[15:04] the Lord this is all God's doing
[15:07] and that trip uh provided us a a very
[15:14] wide open door because one one brother
[15:18] helped me sat down with with you know I
[15:21] would say experience Minister also
[15:25] but in the denomination and we were
[15:28] talking and just the Lord has you know
[15:30] that's that that meeting and and that
[15:33] brother invited me to preach in his
[15:35] church and I was committed to the
[15:36] message uh church already but I I talked
[15:40] to the brother you know this is one
[15:42] opportunity that we do not want to miss
[15:45] and uh so that the brother let me go and
[15:49] I ministered to that Pastor he's uh I
[15:51] think he's 62 years old and uh by God's
[15:55] grace you know uh we shared some simple
[15:58] thoughts some simple things in the
[16:00] message but right after the the meeting
[16:02] by God's for God's glory he was
[16:04] rejoicing and somebody was interpreting
[16:07] he said that this uh old Minister said
[16:09] you know I have been 20 years in the
[16:12] ministry and uh Pastor Danny read the
[16:17] same scriptures we have been reading
[16:19] most of the time but by God's grace uh
[16:24] we were enlightened the this is the only
[16:26] time I have seen those scriptures being
[16:29] shared the way it was this morning and
[16:32] so pray for this we need your prayers
[16:34] and so after that meeting he pulled me
[16:37] in his office and in that office
[16:40] he showed me a map and in that map there
[16:43] are I counted probably 33 stars and in
[16:47] those Stars he said you know of my 20
[16:49] years in the ministry this is the fruit
[16:52] that the Lord has given me
[16:54] 33 churches in different islands and
[16:58] then the next thing that he did he
[17:00] pulled the calendar and he said brother
[17:02] Danny in November I am willing to invite
[17:05] the workers ministers
[17:08] and a market he said I can gather at
[17:13] least 150 workers out of this because
[17:16] they're under my Ministry and they will
[17:19] listen to the message that you're going
[17:21] that you are saying
[17:23] so please amen please include that in
[17:27] your prayer will I we will keep you
[17:29] posted on those things and also Japan I
[17:33] have been to Japan twice and I am
[17:35] scheduled to be back there uh in in
[17:38] October uh
[17:40] and last time I was there I baptized at
[17:43] least two young young people and and his
[17:46] mother
[17:47] and there are also Filipino working in
[17:51] Japan they are believers and now the
[17:54] Lord has provided me some contact
[17:55] because when I was in brother Gerald
[17:57] Duke's Church there is a there is a
[18:00] family there that uh the mother of
[18:06] of the sister was a Japanese and he he's
[18:10] just married to uh to an American
[18:13] brother
[18:14] and they will be there in October at the
[18:17] same time I will be there so I believe
[18:18] this is all God's doing and he said we
[18:21] will we will uh you know our family and
[18:23] we will be there and Lord willing or I'm
[18:25] going to gonna be busy in Japan so in
[18:28] other words little by little I'm fading
[18:30] out in Indonesia maybe I used to go
[18:34] there twice three times a year but maybe
[18:36] I'm going to do it uh once a year
[18:39] probably little by little you know
[18:41] because the Lord is opening up more new
[18:44] doors you know I've been I've been a
[18:47] burdened so much uh for Japan because
[18:50] when I read you know when brother
[18:52] Branham said we know he has I mean he's
[18:54] making some itineraries and said maybe
[18:56] we're going to drop by the Philippines
[18:58] and next Japan you know he mentioned
[19:01] that once but when I read it you know
[19:04] he's not been to Japan or to the
[19:06] Philippines but the message went to the
[19:09] Philippines and now you know the Lord
[19:11] has opened up a door and said Lord if
[19:13] you uh I can find favor and if you're
[19:15] going to use me in Japan just provide
[19:17] the way for me and Lord willing in
[19:20] October that will be my third trip to
[19:22] Japan so with all these things there's a
[19:25] lot of things to to talk about the
[19:27] mission field that just I'm giving you
[19:28] just a peep on those things because I
[19:31] know you have been praying and you have
[19:33] been part of and uh of course this
[19:35] brother but the team is also helping
[19:38] quite a bit in providing Bibles for the
[19:41] new converts and with the disaster that
[19:44] we had and we certainly appreciate all
[19:46] the uh all the help that you're doing
[19:50] amen so but on top of that this morning
[19:53] let's let's all stand up in respect to
[19:56] the reading of the word
[20:00] Hallelujah
[20:02] amen so
[20:04] I'm always encouraged to be beside
[20:07] seasoned and
[20:09] experienced ministers like Brother Sam
[20:12] amen he always make makes me feel
[20:14] comfortable
[20:16] amen so let's read in second Samuel
[20:21] chapter 11.
[20:23] this is a very familiar scripture
[20:27] foreign
[20:30] but I know we're going to to head on
[20:34] with the rest of the scriptures this is
[20:37] very familiar with us but may the Lord
[20:39] give us uh
[20:41] point of view
[20:43] to see what he Wills on this now he says
[20:45] in verse 1 and it came to pass after the
[20:50] year was expired
[20:52] the time when kings go forth to battle
[20:57] that David sent joa
[21:00] and his servants with him
[21:02] and all Israel and they destroyed the
[21:06] children of Ammon and besides rabba
[21:10] but
[21:11] David tarid still at Jerusalem
[21:15] amen I believe that makes the problem
[21:17] for David let's bar heads in prayer dear
[21:21] heavenly father we thank you this
[21:22] morning we give ourselves and uh
[21:26] we we submit and Lord we recognize that
[21:30] we cannot do anything Lord once again
[21:32] this morning you just have your own way
[21:34] Lord and you speak your word with
[21:37] liberty and uh uh may this little sermon
[21:42] God be a help and an encouragement to
[21:45] your people in Jesus Christ's name we
[21:47] thank you everybody say amen amen
[21:51] hallelujah God bless you
[21:53] amen you may be seated
[21:57] thank you Lord for his Mercy amen so we
[22:01] just want just want to give
[22:04] a title to this sermon
[22:07] recognizing the value
[22:10] of our position amen I believe so much
[22:13] has been uh said and told about this
[22:16] portion of the scripture where David you
[22:18] know fell in fell in scene and uh he
[22:22] suffered a lot of consequences because
[22:25] of that you know but uh there's just a
[22:28] simple thought
[22:30] that I would like to drive you by God's
[22:33] help that led uh David
[22:37] to suffer all the consequences that
[22:40] happened after which amen so you see in
[22:44] this verse
[22:47] uh
[22:49] of course Israel is always at War amen
[22:52] just like right now I once again they
[22:55] are at War but in this kind of War this
[22:58] is a different War as we see in the
[23:01] scripture he says and it came to pass
[23:03] after the year was expired at the year
[23:07] when kings go forth
[23:10] to battle amen so this is not an
[23:13] ordinary battle this is not an ordinary
[23:15] War
[23:16] but this is a kind of War as I
[23:18] understood in the scripture that even
[23:21] Kings has to leave their Throne has to
[23:25] leave the palace and join the battle
[23:27] amen so that means they uh this is the
[23:31] kind of war that they have to risk
[23:33] everything because once the other
[23:36] Kingdom you know uh get the king and and
[23:40] the king of one kingdom is being killed
[23:43] that means that kingdom is being
[23:44] concurred amen so you see this is some
[23:48] kind of a war that takes great men in
[23:54] the field
[23:54] and including the king himself
[23:57] Hallelujah and so that's why we come to
[24:00] a point that we need to recognize uh the
[24:04] value of our position right so David
[24:09] recognized amen all his life the value
[24:14] of the position we knew we knew David
[24:16] even when he was young you know
[24:19] he had that kind of character he showed
[24:22] that the courage when nobody wanted to
[24:26] stand against Goliath he was there amen
[24:29] a teenager and uh uh uh realizing he was
[24:33] he he was the king he was already
[24:35] anointed as the next king to Israel but
[24:39] somehow he was able to risk his life
[24:42] because he could not take that that
[24:45] uncircumcised Philistine like like
[24:47] Goliath would insult God Amen before
[24:50] their face amen and so what have
[24:53] happened and along along the way we see
[24:56] how how David uh displaying that kind of
[24:59] character Soul was so uh insecure and he
[25:04] even wanted to kill David but David
[25:07] showed character amen but all these
[25:11] things at this point in time everything
[25:14] was gone
[25:16] in David you see it's this is a
[25:19] different David and and the way I see it
[25:21] is that David was not in his right post
[25:25] of Duty
[25:28] amen amen so now when we recognize the
[25:31] value of our position you know the Bible
[25:33] said in in Revelation we were made Kings
[25:36] and also we were made priests that we
[25:39] will be but we were made Kings and
[25:41] Priests so uh uh uh and in that point
[25:46] as the the the bride the wife of the
[25:49] Lord Jesus Christ we should fully at
[25:52] this point in time recognize the value
[25:54] of our position being the bread of the
[25:57] Lord Jesus Christ amen the value of this
[26:00] message in our lives amen uh now this is
[26:03] not some kind of a simple thing that's
[26:05] why we don't believe that this is this
[26:07] message is another religion another
[26:09] organization another denomination we
[26:12] look beyond that we value this message
[26:15] more than this word could offer right
[26:18] Hallelujah that's why we give our lives
[26:21] to the message of the hour I mean I
[26:23] remember that uh that little kid you
[26:25] know one time that uh
[26:27] uh
[26:28] uh
[26:29] every day they they they they were
[26:32] expecting that ice cream man to pass by
[26:35] and uh but one day his mother could not
[26:38] give him something to buy you know even
[26:40] a a single Cent to buy a cup of ice
[26:43] cream amen and so this this uh this lad
[26:47] was so disappointed and and because all
[26:50] his Playmates were were online you know
[26:53] already buying buying ice cream cups of
[26:56] ice cream but he alone at that very
[26:59] moment he didn't he didn't have anything
[27:01] to buy with so but he remembered brother
[27:04] Barnum said he remembered one thing you
[27:06] know he went up the attic and then
[27:08] pulled that old uh uh luggage and you
[27:11] know because he remembered there was a
[27:14] stump there and then uh he because he
[27:17] knew there is a stamp collector on the
[27:19] other on the other side of the road and
[27:20] he took the Stop and he just uh went
[27:24] straight you know while the ice cream
[27:26] man was waiting you know he he presented
[27:28] the stamp the stump collector and he
[27:30] said how much you will give me for this
[27:32] amen and brother Benham said the first
[27:34] thing that stamp collector said well I
[27:36] can give you a dollar for that yeah amen
[27:39] and because he's scared he's young he
[27:41] said that dollar at that time is
[27:43] something you know he thought of uh
[27:46] that's already 100 cups of ice cream
[27:49] that's how far that young boy could
[27:53] think of that stump amen just a hundred
[27:56] cups of ice cream and so you know he got
[27:59] excited and then he he gave the stam and
[28:01] here comes another you know a dollar you
[28:04] know handed to him and he ran and then
[28:07] he called all his Playmates come on
[28:09] lined up again I'm going to treat you
[28:11] this day amen I've got a lot of cups in
[28:13] here amen but the next thing that have
[28:17] happened is that stamp collector aiming
[28:19] closed his store and went to the town
[28:21] and because uh uh the stump collector
[28:24] you know could give him more than that
[28:26] yeah amen and he said you know the next
[28:28] thing it costs hundred dollars the next
[28:31] it was 500 and brother Branham said the
[28:34] last the last amount I heard amen was
[28:37] that stamp cost a quarter of a million
[28:41] dollars
[28:42] and it's going on yeah yeah amen because
[28:46] people realize the value of that stamp
[28:50] amen it's more than a dollar it's more
[28:53] than 500 bucks it's more than a thousand
[28:56] amen it's even more than you know a
[28:58] quarter of a million dollars for that
[29:01] stump because it's so valuable for those
[29:03] who understand right amen for those who
[29:07] knows what it is amen but you see amen
[29:10] this kid don't understand the value
[29:14] that's how far he could think of it a
[29:17] hundred cups of ice cream amen brothers
[29:19] and sisters it's the same thing with the
[29:21] message of the hour Hallelujah for other
[29:25] people this is just a membership
[29:27] but we go beyond that this message of
[29:31] the hour is life of Jesus Christ in the
[29:33] bride Hallelujah so that's why we
[29:36] realize and recognize the value and then
[29:39] when we when we realize and recognize
[29:41] the value of something that we hold in
[29:44] our hand then we know how to conduct
[29:46] ourselves
[29:47] we know how to live our lives amen we
[29:50] know amen we know how to to to take care
[29:53] amen and be always right about right on
[29:56] our post of Duty amen but remember amen
[30:00] this point in time David amen David
[30:04] found himself in such a condition he
[30:08] never expected right
[30:10] right he would have been right
[30:13] Hallelujah
[30:15] and the reason for that
[30:18] because although he was a king
[30:23] at that time he was supposed to be not
[30:26] on his throne right
[30:28] right he was supposed to be in the
[30:30] battle
[30:32] amen but instead he said he uh instead
[30:36] of being there David sent Joe up and his
[30:39] servants with him and all Israel and
[30:42] they destroyed the children of Ammon so
[30:44] you see even if he wasn't there
[30:47] because God was with his people yeah
[30:50] amen his Warriors kept on advancing amen
[30:55] Killing Children Killing uh Killing
[30:58] Children of Ammon and besides rabba amen
[31:02] but David buried in Jerusalem yeah
[31:06] so while David was there and his
[31:08] Warriors
[31:09] were winning the battles
[31:12] David was fighting his own battle
[31:16] and he was gradually
[31:19] losing it
[31:21] right because he was not in the rightful
[31:23] position
[31:24] Hallelujah so that's the main thing and
[31:27] so amen he went down and down and and
[31:30] the thing Beyond you know when Beyond
[31:33] his control Beyond his expectation
[31:37] Hallelujah
[31:38] and now it sees uh so we know what the
[31:42] next thing that ever happened it came to
[31:43] pass in verse 2 in an evening time that
[31:46] David arose from up his bed and walked
[31:48] upon the roof of the King's house and
[31:50] from the roof he saw a woman washing
[31:52] herself and the woman was very beautiful
[31:55] to look upon Amen to have that kind of
[31:58] description that that woman was very
[32:00] beautiful he must look so closely with
[32:03] it he focused so much in it until the
[32:06] curtain was closed
[32:07] amen and then the next thing that have
[32:10] happened you know the following day the
[32:12] following day of course the king you
[32:15] know the president of the country the
[32:16] president that he could think of Amen
[32:19] when he wakes up amen of course his his
[32:22] soldiers his Warriors are in the battle
[32:24] you know a normal King should ask what's
[32:27] going on in the battlefield amen are we
[32:30] winning do we still have enough supplies
[32:33] amen do we we still have enough Warriors
[32:35] or armies over there shall we send more
[32:40] amen but the following day it was
[32:43] totally different the person that he
[32:45] asked was who is that woman right
[32:49] amen so is who is that woman and and and
[32:53] and and his soldiers around him he said
[32:57] and he said it's not this Bathsheba the
[33:00] daughter of Ilium
[33:02] the wife of Uriah the type
[33:05] amen so David should have stopped right
[33:07] there yeah it's the wife
[33:10] of his loyal faithful Warrior exactly
[33:15] amen
[33:17] but nobody would expect amen that the
[33:20] next thing that he did David sent
[33:21] Messengers to get Bathsheba and David
[33:24] had amen had a child to to cut the story
[33:28] short amen so it's it's gradually David
[33:31] was drifting and drifting amen and now
[33:35] that he was he made he made he failed
[33:39] you know uh he he sinned against God and
[33:43] he knew it
[33:44] and now because David knew the mind of
[33:46] God because David is a man after God's
[33:49] Own Heart he knew God is is graceful in
[33:52] your he knew God loved him so much amen
[33:55] but but now David wanted to to do
[33:58] something
[34:00] he wanted to make a remedy to make it
[34:02] right
[34:03] amen and so there is something that was
[34:06] working behind his head now to justify
[34:09] himself he could not take Bathsheba
[34:11] totally as long as Uriah is alive right
[34:15] amen and so he had to do something and
[34:17] he has to do it upon himself in his own
[34:21] hand
[34:22] Hallelujah
[34:23] and that's the same thing but praise the
[34:26] Lord you know when we are in the will of
[34:28] the Lord God is always in control he's
[34:30] the one doing everything for us amen he
[34:33] will do amen David
[34:36] was working to justify himself right
[34:41] now that's the problem you know that's
[34:43] the problem when we when we when when a
[34:45] person goes away from the will of the
[34:48] Lord he has to make all remedies
[34:50] you know he has to try all avenues you
[34:53] know uh plan a plan B you know all this
[34:57] stuff was to be made
[34:59] by a person that goes away from the will
[35:02] of the Lord hallelujah now but praise
[35:05] the Lord
[35:06] amen uh uh God God knows and God is
[35:09] taking good care of us but just let's
[35:11] just let us just see amen how the Lord
[35:14] has dealt with David and then we we know
[35:17] the rest of the story and and you see uh
[35:20] he's now he sent message to joa to to
[35:24] bring him Uriah and and look at Uriah
[35:27] you know when when he went back to the
[35:29] king and and and and and and hypocrite
[35:32] David said are you not going to visit
[35:34] your wife yeah
[35:36] amen
[35:38] and the words of Uriah was so clear why
[35:41] should I you know why should I visit my
[35:44] wife while my fellow Warriors are
[35:48] fighting on the battlefield some of them
[35:50] dying some of them wounded
[35:53] and why should I take pleasure I'm not
[35:55] that selfish Uriah was not that selfish
[35:58] and also amen he stayed you know not far
[36:02] from his King
[36:04] amen he was still doing things in favor
[36:06] of his King because Uriah recognized the
[36:10] value of his position amen and so now
[36:13] the next thing you know uh uh Uriah
[36:17] David wrote a letter and this letter was
[36:19] handed to uh to joab and job you know
[36:23] you could imagine well job was reading
[36:25] that letter and he was looking at Uriah
[36:27] and then in that letter says amen send
[36:29] Uriah to the hottest battle and when
[36:32] when you are engaged amen you just uh uh
[36:36] you just leave him there and make sure
[36:38] he will die
[36:40] it's a murder
[36:42] right right there right
[36:45] right and job realizing his position
[36:47] also he knew amen I believe he knew
[36:50] something he knew something was going on
[36:53] but somehow because of his loyalty and
[36:55] somehow he he remained in his position
[36:57] he gave due respect to his King and he
[37:01] has to obey the word of his King right
[37:03] Hallelujah and and so amen it happened
[37:06] then and and you see all these things
[37:09] have happened Beyond
[37:12] anybody's normal
[37:14] thinking right yeah
[37:16] yeah and yet it happened
[37:18] Hallelujah it happened now let me read
[37:21] the scripture a quotation here we have
[37:24] the first quotation
[37:26] and it's quoted in the exposition of the
[37:29] seven Church ages
[37:31] now
[37:33] of course this is about the church aides
[37:35] he said now the very name Ephesus
[37:38] has a strange compound meaning aimed at
[37:42] and relaxed
[37:44] the high aspirations of this age that
[37:47] had begun with the fullness of the
[37:48] spirit the depth of God whereby they
[37:52] were aiming at the High Calling of God
[37:54] began to give way to a less watchful
[37:56] attitude
[37:59] a less Arden following of Jesus Christ
[38:01] began to manifest itself as an omen that
[38:04] in the future ages the physical vehicle
[38:07] called The Church would sing to the
[38:10] awfulness of the depth of Satan
[38:13] it had become relaxed and was drifting
[38:16] right right amen David relaxed yeah yeah
[38:20] amen he just opted to stay David taried
[38:25] amen he just relaxed a little bit maybe
[38:28] you know I believe David wasn't a coward
[38:33] he was willing to to go to the battle
[38:36] being the king but by just little time
[38:39] of relaxation maybe he said you know I'm
[38:41] going to follow me next day or next week
[38:44] I'm not going to be long but in that
[38:46] little less watchful attitude and Satan
[38:50] knows that oh yeah
[38:52] amen Satan knows that and you know that
[38:54] we believe that in the message of the
[38:56] hour brother said Satan knows our
[38:58] position right and that's why Satan is
[39:02] trying his best
[39:04] for us not to be in our rightful
[39:07] position
[39:09] because the moment we are in our
[39:11] rightful position man we are we are
[39:13] invincible Army
[39:16] Hallelujah so that's why Satan is trying
[39:19] Amen to to make us a way to hinder Us
[39:23] number one he he doesn't want for us to
[39:27] recognize our position
[39:29] amen and the next thing is amen if he
[39:32] knows we recognize our position the next
[39:34] thing that he he know he doesn't want is
[39:36] for us to occupy our position
[39:39] so it will do everything and so now amen
[39:43] realizing Satan knew this
[39:45] now that David was not in his rightful
[39:49] position he remains to be the king he
[39:51] was but he was not functioning the way
[39:54] he should be because the king Amen in
[39:57] this kind of War this is the the word
[40:00] the Kings
[40:01] go for it for battle
[40:03] Hallelujah not only not only generals
[40:07] not only Warriors but Kings amen so now
[40:11] it had become relaxed and was drifting
[40:14] already the age was backsliding and it
[40:17] had left its first love the Tiny Seed
[40:20] amen the tiny seed planted it that
[40:23] Ephesian aids would one day grow in the
[40:26] spirit of error until all foul birds of
[40:30] the air would Roost in its branches
[40:32] so in offensive to human reasoning would
[40:35] that little plant appear to that new EVE
[40:38] the new church that again she would be
[40:40] deceived by Satan
[40:42] the efficient AIDS had presented to her
[40:45] the opportunity for God's best
[40:48] and for a while she prevailed
[40:50] and then relax
[40:53] and in that unguarded moment
[40:56] Satan planted the seed of complete
[40:59] ruination
[41:01] that little tiny seed amen went on and
[41:04] on and on for that complete realization
[41:07] ruination ruination
[41:10] Hallelujah so
[41:12] a lot of things and then it continued on
[41:14] and and so now after all these things
[41:18] amen we know that during this this time
[41:22] that that now David realized where he is
[41:27] because something
[41:29] has taken place
[41:31] the joy
[41:33] that he used
[41:35] to experience
[41:37] now he was in search of
[41:40] he knew he remains to be a son of God
[41:44] amen because in that song you know uh uh
[41:48] he wrote in Psalms 51 you know he knows
[41:51] you know he restore there is something
[41:53] he knew something has left him that's
[41:55] why he was saying restore unto me the
[41:59] joy of thy salvation
[42:01] salvation you know God is not an Indian
[42:04] giver
[42:05] you know
[42:07] he remained to be a Son of God he knew
[42:11] he's saved
[42:13] salvation is there
[42:15] he believed God to be his own Savior and
[42:18] yet something is missing right there he
[42:22] was looking for something because it
[42:24] wasn't there anymore he said Lord
[42:26] restore to me the joy
[42:29] he was there in his throne but there's
[42:32] no joy
[42:34] he's in the palace he remained all the
[42:37] possession he he keep all these things
[42:40] upon himself and yet there was no joy
[42:42] and what is that what what what is the
[42:45] beauty of of having all this kind of
[42:48] stuff without that kind of joy
[42:50] hallelujah amen but praise God
[42:53] hallelujah so that that's the main thing
[42:55] why we continue to serve the Lord amen
[42:58] because the joy is there you wake up
[43:01] early you travel long you go you go you
[43:04] come here not of course we want to see
[43:06] each other we want to meet each other
[43:08] and seek one another's hand but somehow
[43:10] there is a joy higher than that and that
[43:13] is the joy of hearing his word
[43:15] amen the joy of his presence
[43:18] Hallelujah but there are there are
[43:21] people that can sit on the pews
[43:24] but never have that kind of Joy right
[43:27] right because somewhere somehow they're
[43:30] hiding something
[43:32] amen like David
[43:34] he was sitting in his throne maybe that
[43:37] is your rightful position maybe you know
[43:39] every time you're sitting right there
[43:41] amen but if you feel that the joy isn't
[43:44] there anymore I mean it's the time once
[43:47] again to pray kneel down and appeal to
[43:50] God Lord hallelujah something is wrong
[43:52] somewhere
[43:54] Hallelujah because that's the key
[43:57] when we have the joy of serving the lord
[44:01] amen that's the key when we have that
[44:04] kind of Joy service is all is all over
[44:06] the place but where's the joy
[44:09] amen that's why you know when uh uh uh
[44:13] said when you have that kind of joy you
[44:15] know you cannot wait for them doors to
[44:17] to open we'll be right there
[44:19] amen because there is something that's
[44:21] that keeps pulling you
[44:23] amen
[44:25] so thank God
[44:27] so now uh but every time every time Sons
[44:32] and Daughters of God
[44:34] now this is something we're preaching
[44:37] this
[44:38] to the Sons and Daughters of God the
[44:41] serpency could not understand this right
[44:44] amen you tell them you know I'm a
[44:46] predestinated Son of God your God is
[44:48] unfair
[44:49] amen but God is always Fair
[44:52] amen because he is always giving me
[44:54] favor right and that's fair
[45:06] when you always enjoyed the favor it's
[45:08] fair
[45:10] amen and that's my Lord
[45:12] amen because when when when you know
[45:15] when during the time when I don't know
[45:17] him during the time when I was a sinner
[45:19] yet he loved me
[45:21] amen and that's the greatest favor in
[45:24] his blood covers everything during the
[45:26] time and even in the uh even in the
[45:29] person he said you know his blood was
[45:31] covering the ignorance of the people and
[45:33] who's that people the bride because he
[45:36] we don't we didn't know who we were or
[45:39] who we are amen so you see amen now amen
[45:44] God always has a remedy for his people
[45:46] right you remember Abraham you know he
[45:50] told a lie to abimelech and yet with all
[45:53] these things you know Abraham reap all
[45:56] the favors
[45:58] amen and and said Lord why why should I
[46:02] why should I have this kind of treatment
[46:04] with all the Integrity of my heart
[46:08] amen but but you know God said amen go
[46:11] back to my to my Prophet
[46:14] amen speak to him amen ask prayer for
[46:18] him let his hand lay lay upon you and
[46:21] let him pray for you and give him gifts
[46:26] amen so you see amen it's the same thing
[46:29] with David
[46:30] right right
[46:31] it's the same thing with David and so
[46:33] God was there and the only thing no
[46:35] person no officer in the palace
[46:39] not a single person in that Kingdom
[46:43] would correct David right
[46:46] right except a prophet right
[46:48] right Hallelujah so every time there is
[46:52] a major error
[46:54] God will send a prophet
[46:57] amen and so Nathan amen he he called
[47:01] Nathan and and what have happened in
[47:04] chapter 12 when the Lord sent Nathan and
[47:07] to David then he came unto him and said
[47:08] unto him there were two men in one city
[47:11] the one rich and the other poor now this
[47:13] is wisdom
[47:15] amen you know they're so close Nathan
[47:18] knew David so well
[47:22] and the moment Nathan was there
[47:26] by just looking at David he knew
[47:29] something is wrong
[47:30] the glory wasn't there anymore right
[47:33] Hallelujah
[47:36] you know
[47:38] and the rich man had exceeding many
[47:40] flags and hurts but the poor man had
[47:42] nothing saved one little you lamb which
[47:44] he had bought and Norris up and it grew
[47:46] up together with demon with his children
[47:48] it did it of his own meat and drank
[47:50] Robison cup and laying his bosom and was
[47:53] unto him as a daughter and there came a
[47:55] traveler unto the rich man and he spared
[47:57] to take of his own flock and knob his
[47:59] own herd to dress for that wayfaring man
[48:01] that was common to him but took the poor
[48:04] man's lemon dressed for the man that was
[48:06] come to him and David's anger was
[48:08] greatly kindled against the man and he
[48:11] said to Nathan as the Lord lived you
[48:14] know sometimes people even when they're
[48:16] they're in the room they can still quote
[48:18] God
[48:19] they could still quote brother branham's
[48:22] statement you know they're so you know
[48:25] proud and you know we know the message
[48:27] we know God you know and they're easy to
[48:29] judge
[48:31] they're in the wrong and yet they're
[48:32] easy to judge
[48:35] amen like David
[48:37] and David's anger was greatly kindled
[48:39] against the man and he said to Nathan as
[48:41] the Lord liveth the man that had done
[48:43] this thing shall surely die
[48:45] and he shall restore the lamb fourfold
[48:48] because he did this thing and because he
[48:51] had no pity right
[48:53] yeah
[48:54] amen Nathan said you're right
[48:58] amen and that man David is you right
[49:03] Hallelujah but you know what good thing
[49:06] in David that's why he is a man after
[49:08] God's Own Heart Right
[49:10] you know
[49:12] he respected the prophet of God right
[49:14] yeah
[49:15] and because of that respect
[49:19] David made it right yeah yeah you know
[49:23] something have taken place and and in
[49:26] that moment you know in that in that
[49:29] single moment of relaxation you know
[49:32] spiritual Amnesia came in to David and
[49:37] look at the mess that have happened
[49:38] after which
[49:40] Hallelujah but also in that single
[49:43] moment
[49:45] amen that he respected the prophet of
[49:47] God right amen just right there
[49:52] David humbled himself
[49:54] and once again the man after God's Own
[49:57] Heart
[49:58] who knew how to Humble himself who knew
[50:01] how to respect God's Prophet who knew
[50:04] how to uh uh you know to to to to to to
[50:07] take necessary steps
[50:10] to be back to the Lord hallelujah and
[50:13] and I believe David repented so hard
[50:18] and repentance is the king amen amen
[50:21] repentance is the key
[50:23] amen no no no
[50:25] justification on our side because
[50:27] justification only comes from the Lord
[50:31] and by sending that Prophet was already
[50:33] a justification in favor of David
[50:36] because God knew
[50:39] that the frap the prophet is the only
[50:42] way for David to get correct
[50:45] Hallelujah
[50:46] and so amen so we know what have
[50:49] happened even the even the the child of
[50:52] uh uh of David to Bathsheba he got sick
[50:57] and you know until he died amen and uh
[51:03] we're not going to go on details on that
[51:05] but let me just tell you something in
[51:07] here
[51:08] in verse 29 of chapter 12.
[51:12] second chapter second Samuel chapter 12
[51:16] verse 29 when all these things have
[51:18] happened David was restored and so now
[51:21] you know when when he wrote this song in
[51:24] Psalms 51 you know it it is it was
[51:27] specifically
[51:29] uh that was specifically about his
[51:32] experience about Bathsheba and all the
[51:34] things the incidents that surround amen
[51:37] surrounded that that
[51:39] that experience that failure amen but I
[51:44] just want to go move forward on verse 29
[51:48] well well David was just right there
[51:50] fighting his own battle
[51:53] losing
[51:54] everything
[51:58] the war on the other side was advancing
[52:01] little by little amen
[52:05] now in verse 29 after David made himself
[52:08] corrected get himself corrected you know
[52:12] he wore the right clothes amen he
[52:14] started to eat cleaned himself up
[52:18] because now he recognized well I was
[52:20] pleading to the Lord because you know he
[52:23] might give me favor to give back the
[52:25] life of my son but now that he made the
[52:28] decision so you see now the good thing
[52:30] in David is coming back because now
[52:33] after recognizing amen now after
[52:36] recognizing the prophet now he
[52:38] recognized whatever
[52:41] he recognized whatever happens he loved
[52:44] that child so much and yet God took that
[52:47] right
[52:49] but he was not hurt
[52:51] now all things work together for good
[52:54] amen because he did the person he
[52:56] recognized the prophet he had great
[52:58] respect for him and now he recognized
[53:00] whatever God does it will be on his
[53:02] favor so he recognized the up God being
[53:05] absolute in his life so his people ask
[53:09] him how come amen before you were you
[53:11] were passing you were praying amen
[53:13] you're not cleaning yourself but now
[53:15] when your child die him and you you
[53:17] clean up yourself now you're eating you
[53:19] seem to be normal yeah
[53:21] amen he said what's wrong with you God
[53:24] made the decision he's my absolute now
[53:26] once again
[53:28] Hallelujah and so now amen that's why in
[53:31] verse 29
[53:33] and David guided all the people together
[53:37] and went to rabba and fought against it
[53:40] and took it
[53:43] but prior to that there's one good
[53:45] scripture in verse 28 on the side of of
[53:49] job and I really appreciate this verse
[53:52] 27 I would say
[53:53] let's read and job sent Messengers to
[53:56] David and said I have fought against
[53:57] rabba and have taken the city of waters
[54:02] now therefore gather the rest of the
[54:04] people together and income against the
[54:07] city and take it lest I take the city
[54:10] and it be called after my name what a
[54:14] man
[54:15] what a word you're under the king
[54:18] what a faithful
[54:20] servant or Warrior of David amen he had
[54:24] all the opportunities to advance
[54:27] he had all the opportunities to make a
[54:29] name for himself right and yet with that
[54:32] kind of respect he knew the value of his
[54:34] position he knew amen he cannot go
[54:37] beyond that right and he stayed in his
[54:40] position and he said King David amen we
[54:44] will keep our Advance amen we're winning
[54:46] the battle and we're just close to that
[54:49] and he sent Messengers to David and he
[54:51] said King David come over amen because
[54:53] amen if you if you if you delay your
[54:56] your your
[54:59] when you join us amen I might take yeah
[55:04] the kingdom
[55:06] and it will be after my name
[55:09] what a respect right
[55:12] on the side of job right so he stood
[55:15] right there waiting for the king to come
[55:17] amen and take on the kingdom and David
[55:20] was there right on the time amen and so
[55:23] you see that's the same thing in the
[55:26] ministry that's the same thing in the
[55:27] mission field amen we go in a place
[55:29] where winning the battle we're winning
[55:31] we're winning Souls not for ourselves
[55:34] amen we're winning souls for him amen
[55:37] they were not taking names Upon Our Own
[55:39] but we give all the glory upon the Lord
[55:43] Jesus Christ
[55:44] I believe that's the right attitude amen
[55:47] that we should help amen that that the
[55:49] Bride of Jesus Christ continue to
[55:51] magnify in this hour
[55:53] we're not lifting up any name we're not
[55:56] lifting up any organization but we're
[55:58] lifting up our King and that's Jesus
[56:01] Christ and I believe that's the same
[56:02] thing that brother Branham said I did
[56:04] not uh uh I was not able to give this to
[56:07] the brother but let me read this script
[56:09] this quotation and I like this also in
[56:11] EX in the church ages brother Benham
[56:13] said not for one moment
[56:16] do I bring a message to the people that
[56:19] they may follow me
[56:20] or join my church or start some
[56:23] fellowship and organization I have never
[56:27] done that and will not do that now right
[56:29] right I have no interest in those things
[56:32] but I do have an interest in the things
[56:34] of God and people and if I accomplish
[56:38] just one thing right I will be satisfied
[56:41] that one thing is to see establish a
[56:44] true spiritual relationship between God
[56:46] and Men wherein men become New Creations
[56:49] in Christ filled with the spirit and
[56:53] live according to his word I would
[56:55] invite plead and warn all to hear his
[56:58] voice at this time and yield yourselves
[57:01] completely to him even as I trust in my
[57:04] heart that I have given my all to him
[57:06] God bless you and may his coming Rejoice
[57:08] your heart oh I love that Hallelujah
[57:10] that's why I see this thing in job amen
[57:13] his respect upon King David King David
[57:16] come
[57:17] because this is yours
[57:19] Hallelujah
[57:21] that's why I see
[57:23] when I was reading this scripture I just
[57:26] close for a while my Bible
[57:29] then I said ah
[57:32] if only second summer chapter 11 verse
[57:36] 1.
[57:38] and then you proceed on because this is
[57:42] the time when kings go for it for battle
[57:44] and then you read second Samuel chapter
[57:47] 12 verse 29 when King David was already
[57:51] in the battle
[57:53] and then he took the king he took the
[57:55] crown
[57:56] amen
[57:57] and so you see
[58:00] verse 2 of chapter 11. until verse 28 of
[58:05] chapter 12. these were all permissible
[58:10] simply because David
[58:14] did not accomplish His function as the
[58:17] king
[58:18] amen
[58:19] so this is the same thing in our lives
[58:22] amen amen
[58:24] but God through his blood
[58:27] amen
[58:29] remove all these things
[58:31] Hallelujah
[58:32] so only because you know David was not
[58:38] in his right place
[58:41] I believe
[58:42] I believe
[58:44] that
[58:46] Solomon
[58:48] was predestinated by God
[58:52] to be the son of David
[58:55] and not upon any woman
[58:58] it must be true Bathsheba
[59:02] Solomon true Bathsheba right
[59:05] but Uriah could not produce a Solomon
[59:09] out of Bathsheba right
[59:11] because it's not the perfect
[59:13] will it's not the perfect will of God
[59:15] although Uriah was good
[59:18] Uriah was faithful
[59:21] amen
[59:22] and yet he's not the predestinated
[59:25] father for Solomon it must be David
[59:29] and it must be true Bathsheba
[59:31] Hallelujah we saw that in in Sarah and
[59:35] Abraham
[59:37] Sarah tried to interpret God's word and
[59:39] give agar you know and and that made the
[59:41] problem
[59:43] it must be Abraham and Isaac through
[59:45] Sarah no matter what it is right so it
[59:48] must be Bathsheba Solomon and David no
[59:51] matter what right
[59:52] but
[59:53] David
[59:56] was there
[59:58] in the wrong time right
[1:00:00] right simply because he was not in the
[1:00:03] right place
[1:00:04] if only I believe if only David went
[1:00:07] ahead or went just just the way it was
[1:00:10] designed when kings go for it for battle
[1:00:12] amen somewhere along the way something
[1:00:15] could have happened to Uriah it would
[1:00:17] happen somehow because it was God's
[1:00:21] predestinated for Solomon to be the son
[1:00:23] of David
[1:00:25] Hallelujah
[1:00:29] but it happened though because David
[1:00:31] wasn't there
[1:00:32] and he went ahead of God's timing to
[1:00:35] Bathsheba
[1:00:36] right you know
[1:00:38] God's never late
[1:00:40] even when you know he we were talking
[1:00:44] about him and myself you know we're
[1:00:45] talking about you know uh uh uh he was
[1:00:50] in late four days when when he was there
[1:00:52] in front of the tomb of Lazarus that was
[1:00:55] the time right
[1:00:57] that he designed
[1:00:59] that will give him glory
[1:01:02] amen so David
[1:01:05] use his own time
[1:01:07] and that made all the problems he was in
[1:01:10] in the wrong place at the wrong time
[1:01:14] Hallelujah
[1:01:17] so we cannot go ahead of God
[1:01:20] neither we can be late
[1:01:22] and if we are always you know people
[1:01:24] they just go ahead so much
[1:01:27] amen but sometimes people get too late
[1:01:33] amen sometimes you know we're supposed
[1:01:36] to be there and sometimes we just keep
[1:01:38] waiting because we do not want to take
[1:01:40] the risk you know you know we do not
[1:01:42] want to make mistakes somehow
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:46] and and gets a little delay
[1:01:49] amen but I believe if we put these
[1:01:52] things two things together
[1:01:54] too late and too Advance
[1:01:57] there is always middle of the road if we
[1:02:00] can put these two things together and go
[1:02:03] right there at the middle of the road
[1:02:04] then we got started
[1:02:06] amen and we can we can aim amen our
[1:02:09] rifle to the Target and pull the trigger
[1:02:11] and here Satan bullseye
[1:02:15] amen because we are in God's timing
[1:02:18] that's the main thing that's the main
[1:02:20] thing that happened to David and you see
[1:02:22] in another statement let us read this I
[1:02:26] believe this is in the third code
[1:02:27] brother he said
[1:02:29] in the message Elijah in 1953
[1:02:33] I said God loved Israel and said so in
[1:02:37] the Bible
[1:02:38] and he never did say that he loved us in
[1:02:41] that way when I said that was his first
[1:02:43] love was Israel and yet when Israel got
[1:02:46] out of the will of God God poured out
[1:02:48] the judgments of Heaven upon Israel
[1:02:51] and we will not escape the judgments of
[1:02:53] God if David was a man after God's Own
[1:02:57] Heart and when David sinned before God
[1:03:00] God made David reap for what he sold
[1:03:04] and we will never come short of that
[1:03:07] right
[1:03:08] right whether it's individual
[1:03:11] Church community
[1:03:14] or a nation like America right
[1:03:17] exactly
[1:03:19] where are we at now
[1:03:22] amen
[1:03:25] your nation started Detroit you know you
[1:03:27] know your history more than I know it
[1:03:29] amen but look where it's at now so that
[1:03:32] the prophet of God said whether it's an
[1:03:35] individual like David
[1:03:36] like me like you
[1:03:38] amen a church when he left its first
[1:03:42] love yeah
[1:03:44] a community
[1:03:46] a nation like America like the
[1:03:48] Philippines
[1:03:50] God will require Judgment of sin
[1:03:54] Hallelujah you know what the Philippines
[1:03:56] we have we we made
[1:04:00] I would consider the greatest decision
[1:04:03] in our history
[1:04:05] some of you may have not known it but
[1:04:07] you see during the time when Israel was
[1:04:10] was supposed to be voted as a nation
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:15] sometime during that year the Secretary
[1:04:18] General of the U.N happened to be Carlos
[1:04:21] P romulo who was beside general
[1:04:23] makhartur you know when General
[1:04:26] MacArthur fulfilled his premise to the
[1:04:28] Philippines that famous statement I
[1:04:30] shall return Carlos piromulo was with
[1:04:32] him and and he he's among uh uh the the
[1:04:36] the the the the brightest uh uh uh men
[1:04:41] that our country have braced and he
[1:04:43] became the Secretary General to the U.N
[1:04:45] and at that time all the members of un
[1:04:48] should decide whether Israel must be
[1:04:51] accepted as a nation
[1:04:53] amen and you know what have happened
[1:04:56] there was a tie
[1:05:00] the score on both sides were the same
[1:05:04] and only at that particular incident the
[1:05:08] Secretary General has to vote
[1:05:14] and their stood Carlos piromolo the
[1:05:19] Filipino representative who happened to
[1:05:22] be the Secretary General and our
[1:05:24] president you know he he called the
[1:05:26] president and he they had the same
[1:05:27] decision vote for Israel
[1:05:31] so we broke the tie
[1:05:37] amen and you know just
[1:05:40] immediately after that the Philippines
[1:05:43] was blessed
[1:05:45] it even happened to be our nation became
[1:05:49] number one in Southeast Asia in terms of
[1:05:52] economy
[1:05:53] amen because after the war Japan used to
[1:05:57] be number one but after the war you know
[1:05:59] everything gone and we became number one
[1:06:01] but shortly after that the Philippines
[1:06:04] little by little little by little
[1:06:05] because we are a Catholic nation and so
[1:06:08] forth and so on you know now
[1:06:12] we are you know I'm a Filipino brother
[1:06:15] Branham said no matter what I'm an
[1:06:16] American so you see no matter what I'm a
[1:06:18] Filipino somehow but I have the greatest
[1:06:21] citizenship and I'm citizen of Heaven I
[1:06:23] believe hallelujah amen but you see amen
[1:06:28] that's why brother Benham said whether
[1:06:29] it's an individual Church community or a
[1:06:32] nation God will require Judgment of sin
[1:06:35] right amen that have happened to to
[1:06:38] David
[1:06:39] and what I'm pointing out brothers and
[1:06:41] sisters is that we need all the time
[1:06:46] by God's grace and health
[1:06:49] to be right on our post of Duty
[1:06:54] when you find your position in the body
[1:06:56] of Christ
[1:06:59] it's more than 100 cups of ice cream
[1:07:02] right
[1:07:10] right and for me I can testify
[1:07:15] I love his word
[1:07:17] I love this message
[1:07:21] and we should only have to do what we
[1:07:25] are supposed to do
[1:07:28] not just recognizing our post of Duty
[1:07:31] but to be an active living part of the
[1:07:35] body of Jesus Christ
[1:07:36] the function
[1:07:38] amen because it takes amen a deposition
[1:07:42] amen when we recognize our position
[1:07:45] responsibility comes after which
[1:07:49] there's always a responsibility in our
[1:07:51] post of Duty it's not just a position
[1:07:53] you know it's good to be called the
[1:07:55] pastor evangelist missionaries somehow
[1:07:58] it's good amen but the function the
[1:08:01] responsibility behind it is the most
[1:08:03] important thing
[1:08:04] and and in that unguarded moment David
[1:08:08] failed Amen to be in his rightful post
[1:08:11] of Duty amen fulfilling His function as
[1:08:15] uh as the king amen because during the
[1:08:19] time that the king should go forth into
[1:08:21] battle and see all these things have
[1:08:24] happened
[1:08:25] Hallelujah so it's always my prayers
[1:08:28] brothers and sisters amen that in every
[1:08:32] moment of Our Lives
[1:08:34] amen
[1:08:37] we should be in our right post objects
[1:08:40] that when he comes back and I believe
[1:08:42] all this thing all these things that are
[1:08:44] happening around us amen the prophet of
[1:08:46] God said all these things
[1:08:49] there is only one thing that the bread
[1:08:51] of Jesus Christ is waiting for
[1:08:53] and that's the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:55] Christ
[1:08:56] and that's the body change
[1:08:58] amen it's not anything that this world
[1:09:01] can offer we're still working we're
[1:09:04] still feeding providing our as fathers
[1:09:07] we need to provide for our families amen
[1:09:09] us you know as as students you know it's
[1:09:13] not bad to have ambition of some sort
[1:09:16] amen but make sure amen anything you
[1:09:18] know if you want to prepare better
[1:09:19] balance if you want to prepare something
[1:09:21] for your life 10 years 20 years or even
[1:09:23] 100 years amen but make sure whenever he
[1:09:26] comes you are prepared glory and when he
[1:09:29] comes we are on our rightful post of
[1:09:31] June right Hallelujah so we have placed
[1:09:34] amen this message has placed us so much
[1:09:36] that's why we believe that this message
[1:09:39] will not make us Sons and Daughters of
[1:09:41] God
[1:09:42] amen because in the mind of God we were
[1:09:46] already
[1:09:47] we were already in his mind amen this
[1:09:51] message only amen gives us the
[1:09:55] revelation of Who We Are
[1:09:58] amen there's nothing added to it all
[1:10:00] right Amen in Jeremiah chapter 29 says I
[1:10:04] know the thought for I know the thoughts
[1:10:05] that I think toward you
[1:10:08] and these thoughts are good
[1:10:10] amen not of evil right
[1:10:13] all right amen and he said he gives us
[1:10:16] an expected end
[1:10:18] amen amen and this is only for his own
[1:10:21] Glory
[1:10:23] and I thank God for that in my life you
[1:10:26] know there's a lot of things also that
[1:10:27] have happened all of us have our own
[1:10:29] testimonies before we came back to the
[1:10:32] Lord and the Lord starts Our Lives you
[1:10:34] know all of us have something to tell
[1:10:37] right
[1:10:38] we have entered in that verse two of
[1:10:40] second Samuel
[1:10:42] amen when we are where we are supposed
[1:10:45] to be in verse 29.
[1:10:48] amen but we experience verse 2 of
[1:10:51] chapter 11 until verse 28 of chapter 12
[1:10:55] of David's life right
[1:10:57] Hallelujah but praise God Amen well when
[1:11:00] we go when we go under the blood anytime
[1:11:04] this you know uh Satan will always uh
[1:11:07] point us to that part of our Lives amen
[1:11:10] but every time he looks and open it
[1:11:12] because of the blood there's no record
[1:11:14] on file
[1:11:15] Hallelujah there's no record on file
[1:11:17] amen David remains to be the the man
[1:11:21] after God's Own Heart I remain to be the
[1:11:24] son of God
[1:11:25] amen and and these and this does not
[1:11:28] give me a a license you know to get to
[1:11:31] get to go out of the way
[1:11:36] you know
[1:11:38] but this only gives me liberty to ponder
[1:11:41] and to appreciate the grace of the Lord
[1:11:44] you see when we come to the full
[1:11:46] revelation of the grace of God Amen we
[1:11:49] will not go beyond what we are supposed
[1:11:52] to do amen as much as possible we will
[1:11:54] stay in our post of Duty because we
[1:11:58] recognize God Amen brother was
[1:12:00] confronted with question you know
[1:12:02] between between this Armenian and
[1:12:04] calvinistic jury you know where you know
[1:12:06] we're saved by works and we're saved by
[1:12:08] grace somehow amen remember there is
[1:12:11] middle of the road you know it does not
[1:12:13] mean that we're not working
[1:12:16] because we recognize the grace of God
[1:12:18] but the only thing is we don't believe
[1:12:20] that by doing good works we're saved
[1:12:23] right amen but the message of the hour
[1:12:25] even gives us enough Revelation about
[1:12:29] God's grace
[1:12:31] in fact it is beyond our understanding
[1:12:35] but as much as we can understand at
[1:12:38] least
[1:12:39] amen we we we have come to a point Amen
[1:12:42] to appreciate God's Amazing Grace and
[1:12:44] because of this that puts us to do good
[1:12:47] works
[1:12:48] not to be saved but we do that in
[1:12:51] gratitude because we are grateful
[1:12:54] we are grateful for what God has done
[1:12:58] for us
[1:12:59] Hallelujah and that puts us to work
[1:13:02] amen
[1:13:04] Hallelujah and so you know this message
[1:13:06] plays Us in such a position and now as I
[1:13:09] have said you know
[1:13:11] people somehow you know they just went
[1:13:14] ahead
[1:13:15] and some are
[1:13:17] too late to fulfill God's word yeah
[1:13:21] yeah that's why brother the scripture
[1:13:23] says you know when when you hear his
[1:13:25] voice heard the natural hearts
[1:13:28] amen so the moment the opportunity is
[1:13:32] there and we know that it is the will of
[1:13:34] the Lord
[1:13:35] don't let it pass by
[1:13:37] otherwise it will go into some other's
[1:13:40] hand
[1:13:41] Hallelujah because God will fulfill his
[1:13:45] own word
[1:13:47] no matter what
[1:13:49] it will fulfill that's why all these
[1:13:51] things you know the permissive will we
[1:13:53] recognize is the permissive but the
[1:13:56] perfect will of the Lord overruled
[1:13:59] all the permissive will that have
[1:14:01] happened to David the same thing with me
[1:14:03] the same thing with you and me
[1:14:06] hallelujah thank you Lord I love him so
[1:14:09] much the more I the more I serve him the
[1:14:11] more I love him
[1:14:13] so in Psalms 51 let us just read this
[1:14:23] in verse 7 let's let's proceed Purge me
[1:14:25] with his up and I shall be clean wash me
[1:14:28] and I shall be whiter than snow
[1:14:31] make me to hear joy and gladness that
[1:14:34] the bones which thou has broken May
[1:14:37] rejoice
[1:14:39] right huh right amen so sometimes God
[1:14:42] has to break our bones
[1:14:44] you know sometimes we enjoy too much
[1:14:48] and we forget him
[1:14:51] we take risk in leaving our position and
[1:14:54] try something else
[1:14:56] amen and God Amen sometimes we go too
[1:15:00] far and guide us to break our bones
[1:15:02] it hurts God to break us
[1:15:06] amen but that's the only way
[1:15:08] to bring us back to himself
[1:15:11] right and he said you know amen and
[1:15:13] that's why now David said uh uh make me
[1:15:17] to hear joy and gladness that the bones
[1:15:19] with thou has broken May Rejoice hide
[1:15:21] thy face from my sins and black out all
[1:15:24] my iniquities creating me a clean heart
[1:15:27] o God and renew
[1:15:30] it's not a new
[1:15:32] it is a renew
[1:15:35] renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me
[1:15:39] not away from thy presence
[1:15:42] and take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1:15:45] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1:15:48] and uphold me with thy free spirit
[1:15:50] then now this is a testimony now we
[1:15:54] recognize why God has to allow these
[1:15:56] things
[1:15:57] amen because when David recognized and
[1:16:00] was able to was for God to restore him
[1:16:03] and in verse 13 He said then
[1:16:06] will I teach transgressors
[1:16:09] thy ways
[1:16:11] you know sometimes it's good that there
[1:16:13] are people who went ahead of us and
[1:16:15] share experiences
[1:16:17] amen that somehow we cannot go we should
[1:16:20] not go their way because they have tried
[1:16:23] it already
[1:16:25] and this is what I can advise to the
[1:16:27] young people that are here listen to the
[1:16:29] elders
[1:16:32] because they have passed those ways
[1:16:35] already right
[1:16:36] don't ever try
[1:16:40] amen it's just good you know that God
[1:16:43] you know like Joseph was was being
[1:16:46] preserved
[1:16:47] amen and and so and so restaurant to me
[1:16:51] the joy of thy salvation and uphold me
[1:16:53] with thy Prince Spirit then will I teach
[1:16:55] transgressors thy ways and sinners shall
[1:16:59] be converted unto thee
[1:17:01] amen so now David becomes a testimony
[1:17:06] right and he could win souls and give
[1:17:08] good advice
[1:17:10] amen
[1:17:11] so now
[1:17:15] it's on in in occupying our position
[1:17:18] because we recognize our function
[1:17:21] their God will bless us amen right
[1:17:24] right and now
[1:17:26] we are already in the position all the
[1:17:28] scriptures all the prophecies have been
[1:17:31] fulfilled that's why he said you know
[1:17:33] because in this days you know there's a
[1:17:35] lot of things that are going on even in
[1:17:37] those people that used to
[1:17:40] be so cold
[1:17:42] believing the message
[1:17:44] amen
[1:17:45] before believing the sign but now they
[1:17:48] disbelieve the sign right
[1:17:51] amen so I would say the battle is on
[1:17:55] amen
[1:17:56] because there is already a falling away
[1:17:58] that's going on and it has been
[1:18:00] prophesied already amen so people are
[1:18:03] you know just uh you know in the
[1:18:05] Philippines we I know it's all over the
[1:18:07] world you know this is strange doctrines
[1:18:09] that are going around you know that they
[1:18:11] believe that they're already in the uh
[1:18:13] in the Millennium some already in the
[1:18:15] eighth day uh enjoying eternity and you
[1:18:19] know the the spiritual application of
[1:18:21] those things amen but we believe I
[1:18:24] believe personally that there are
[1:18:25] natural fulfillment of these things
[1:18:27] there has to be a a literal Rapture that
[1:18:31] will take place a body chain somehow
[1:18:33] amen but there are people who believe
[1:18:35] that they're already enjoying eternity
[1:18:38] but I just wondered how how how how how
[1:18:40] they're not they could not enter the zoo
[1:18:45] in a fellowship with the lions and
[1:18:47] tigers over there
[1:18:53] amen for me they're too advanced
[1:18:56] that's too advanced
[1:18:58] amen but then there are also people that
[1:19:01] always look back
[1:19:03] amen that the only thing that they could
[1:19:05] say that all the things I mean I'm not
[1:19:08] saying against it amen I really
[1:19:10] appreciate that the only thing they
[1:19:11] could that they could Rejoice are the
[1:19:13] things that have happened in the
[1:19:14] ministry of brother Branham amen I
[1:19:17] believe all those things are true all
[1:19:19] those things are testimony amen but for
[1:19:22] me that's too late right
[1:19:24] right I mean it's good to Pander on
[1:19:26] those things proving that God is alive
[1:19:28] amen
[1:19:31] but listen
[1:19:34] Elijah said to Elisha
[1:19:37] I want Elisha said I want double portion
[1:19:39] of what you have
[1:19:42] right and Elijah said
[1:19:44] Elijah
[1:19:45] if thou see me go right
[1:19:49] then ye shall receive what you ask for
[1:19:53] amen
[1:19:54] now we have seen the Prophet come
[1:19:58] but we should accept the fact that he's
[1:20:00] gone right
[1:20:02] right but that does not make us
[1:20:03] unbeliever
[1:20:05] Amen in fact amen he has introduced us
[1:20:08] to Christ and the message that he has
[1:20:11] brought and that's why I'm still quoting
[1:20:13] his message
[1:20:14] because this is Christ in word form amen
[1:20:16] Hallelujah so so these people and yet
[1:20:20] people are too late and then they they
[1:20:22] instead of now they're on the other side
[1:20:24] that instead of pandering and enjoying
[1:20:26] this testimonies they criticize it
[1:20:30] you know criticizing the cloud Chris is
[1:20:33] decising the prophet and all this stuff
[1:20:35] for me that is too late also
[1:20:38] it's too late for me yeah yeah amen now
[1:20:41] what would Rebecca say you know what
[1:20:43] would Rebecca say if his neighbor would
[1:20:46] tell amen do you believe that Elisa
[1:20:50] you know that ilyaser we know him he
[1:20:52] made a lot of statements
[1:20:54] that we don't we don't believe what
[1:20:57] would Rebecca say well I don't care yeah
[1:21:00] all I know is that Elisa introduced me
[1:21:02] to Isaac and now I'm married to Isaac
[1:21:05] oh yeah
[1:21:07] so Rebecca will say you're too late
[1:21:09] buddy
[1:21:11] so if you say anything against my
[1:21:12] prophet he means to be my Prophet then I
[1:21:15] would say you're too late amen so you're
[1:21:18] too late it's either you're too late and
[1:21:20] you're too ahead amen but I am in the
[1:21:23] middle of the road I'm in God's timing
[1:21:25] Hallelujah and God is fulfilling his
[1:21:28] word in our midst and I what and I only
[1:21:30] do amen is to just enjoy where God
[1:21:34] placed me amen and enjoy it and live the
[1:21:37] way I should be and conduct myself as
[1:21:40] the son of the king
[1:21:42] Hallelujah but we are in the battle
[1:21:46] we were made Kings and Priests
[1:21:49] and if we were made Kings and Priests
[1:21:51] then this is our time
[1:21:54] this is the time you know just like in a
[1:21:57] ball game you know we're we're the best
[1:21:59] players are being placed
[1:22:01] right and this is the same time the
[1:22:03] kings that were made you know should be
[1:22:06] in the Battlefront
[1:22:08] that's why when brother Branham was
[1:22:10] there in the mountain and when he raised
[1:22:12] his hand he was given the sword the king
[1:22:15] of the the king's sword amen why you
[1:22:18] know he was not given anything else
[1:22:22] he was not given something he was given
[1:22:24] the king's sword and that sword you know
[1:22:27] when you have the sword in your hand you
[1:22:28] know you better prepare for battle right
[1:22:31] you're not in the party we're not on a
[1:22:32] holiday we're not an Excursion we're in
[1:22:35] a battle every day of Our Lives
[1:22:38] by receiving this message amen because
[1:22:41] we know the moment we receive this
[1:22:43] message all hell is up against us
[1:22:46] Hallelujah and so it's better all the
[1:22:50] time to be right in our rightful
[1:22:52] position thank you Lord hallelujah and
[1:22:56] God will never fail God will never fail
[1:22:59] and every time you know every time there
[1:23:01] is there is a meeting if we're going to
[1:23:03] meet him up there in the air every time
[1:23:06] you know Abraham
[1:23:09] overcame the Kings
[1:23:12] during the time of lot
[1:23:14] and after who overcame Kings
[1:23:17] he met Melchizedek
[1:23:20] and after we have fought our fight
[1:23:24] in this day
[1:23:26] because this is the King's battle
[1:23:29] and I believe the king of all Kings is
[1:23:32] here in Armenia
[1:23:34] Hallelujah I remember those those those
[1:23:36] archangels you know and there was a
[1:23:38] conference in heaven and they would look
[1:23:40] down and see what's going on in Babylon
[1:23:43] and these three young people stood their
[1:23:45] ground and they want the king wanted
[1:23:47] them to to bow down you know so these
[1:23:50] three young people were up against the
[1:23:52] king of Babylon
[1:23:53] Hallelujah they were up against the king
[1:23:56] but they stood their ground
[1:23:58] and so because they stood their ground
[1:24:00] now notice when we stood our ground
[1:24:03] amen you know it's there's there's just
[1:24:06] holes of angels
[1:24:09] not just friends that will be around us
[1:24:12] when we are in the midst of our own
[1:24:14] battle amen because the king is on our
[1:24:19] side remember it's not just us fighting
[1:24:21] our battle right
[1:24:23] because we are fighting against King
[1:24:26] this is Satan's kingdom
[1:24:29] and we're fighting against the king of
[1:24:31] this Eden and so these three young
[1:24:33] people they were they they they stood
[1:24:35] against the king of Babylon
[1:24:38] and so because of that amen it only
[1:24:41] created not only their friends
[1:24:44] Amen to to be around them but there is
[1:24:48] something a conference that have
[1:24:49] happened in heaven and God was there
[1:24:51] looking down and the archangels where
[1:24:53] they're looking down below said I could
[1:24:56] imagine how you know how wormwood amen
[1:24:59] could could pull that that sword and
[1:25:03] said Lord I cannot stand it anymore amen
[1:25:06] can you can you send me once again as
[1:25:08] you send me during the time of Noah
[1:25:10] where I sent flood I can I can do it
[1:25:13] once again at your at your at your
[1:25:15] instruction and I can change this in
[1:25:17] right now
[1:25:18] amen and the King said I really
[1:25:21] appreciate your concern to my children
[1:25:24] wormwood but this is not your battle
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:30] sit down
[1:25:31] amen
[1:25:32] and then Gabriel also appealed to the
[1:25:35] Lord Lord send me now if it's not
[1:25:37] wormwood maybe me
[1:25:39] amen and the King said I appreciate that
[1:25:42] but you better sit beside wormwood
[1:25:45] and probably
[1:25:46] Michael also
[1:25:48] amen but he said I appreciate all your
[1:25:51] concern upon my people but they're
[1:25:53] fighting against the king of Babylon
[1:25:56] and so I need to come down and so that
[1:25:59] poor man in the Perry furnace was the
[1:26:01] king himself Hallelujah why because we
[1:26:04] are
[1:26:06] during the time that this is the fight
[1:26:09] when kings go for battle and I believe
[1:26:12] that Ancient of Days come down the king
[1:26:15] of glory has come down Hallelujah to pie
[1:26:18] this kind of battle and there's no way
[1:26:21] we're going to lose
[1:26:23] as long as we are in our rightful
[1:26:25] position
[1:26:26] Hallelujah and we just depend upon Him
[1:26:28] upon upon himself and we should always
[1:26:31] look at that portion you know that that
[1:26:34] we are always amen under the inspiration
[1:26:37] of this holy word you know so you see
[1:26:41] you're just right here
[1:26:44] you pray for us yeah
[1:26:46] when we are on the field
[1:26:48] we do our position
[1:26:49] we fulfill
[1:26:51] our own objective and that is for soul
[1:26:55] amen so this message just like brother
[1:26:58] Branham just like I said you know it's
[1:26:59] good to talk about those things that
[1:27:01] have happened
[1:27:02] but God I believe is placing us in our
[1:27:06] rightful position I remember one time
[1:27:09] when brother Branham of course we
[1:27:11] remember Sister Haiti right so much
[1:27:13] when brother Branham was just right
[1:27:15] there and God was pleased because this
[1:27:19] woman said the right thing upon the
[1:27:21] prophet
[1:27:22] just like what David said he he
[1:27:25] respected Nathan and here comes the
[1:27:27] bride Here Comes Haiti right to a great
[1:27:30] respect with the prophet of God he said
[1:27:32] the right thing and in that very hour
[1:27:35] there was a voice and brother Branham
[1:27:38] testified that as clear as I heard those
[1:27:41] voice when those squirrels appear
[1:27:45] when the resurrection of that fish
[1:27:48] that was the same similar voice that I
[1:27:50] heard
[1:27:52] that said tell that woman whatever she
[1:27:55] says
[1:27:56] it will come to pass
[1:27:58] now I believe you know it is somehow a a
[1:28:02] a type we can we can bring it wider in
[1:28:05] such a view that God is placing Us in
[1:28:09] such a position that the prophet of God
[1:28:12] is speaking to the bride
[1:28:15] to speak the word
[1:28:17] because the bride has the spoken word
[1:28:20] amen and so in that rightful position
[1:28:22] with the right character
[1:28:25] amen God has pulled trust in that woman
[1:28:28] right right that that he can speak to
[1:28:31] his prophet and give that message that
[1:28:34] whatever this woman say it will come to
[1:28:36] pass amen remember in the mind in the
[1:28:39] mind of the prophet he he had so much
[1:28:42] compassion about about this woman
[1:28:46] she was so poor
[1:28:48] and she had the sick loved one
[1:28:52] it's in the mind of the Prophet she
[1:28:54] might have chosen
[1:28:57] either one
[1:28:59] amen but you see the bride
[1:29:04] that with the woman
[1:29:07] with the right character
[1:29:09] with the right Pure Heart Right
[1:29:12] and the Bible said I'll
[1:29:15] of the abundance of your heart right
[1:29:19] our hearts speak
[1:29:22] so it see it it just came natural and he
[1:29:25] said this woman said I don't know what
[1:29:27] to say
[1:29:29] what will I say
[1:29:31] what will I ask
[1:29:33] and the prophet of God said whatever
[1:29:37] and out of the abundance of the word is
[1:29:40] spoke and she said
[1:29:42] the Salvation Glory
[1:29:45] the souls
[1:29:47] oh my voice
[1:29:51] and that's and that's you know that's
[1:29:53] the condition of the bride's heart
[1:29:56] we always have passion for Souls
[1:29:59] amen
[1:30:01] and God will not back out back off from
[1:30:04] his word
[1:30:05] and the way
[1:30:07] as the bride said it came to pass
[1:30:11] so I believe we look beyond that that
[1:30:13] now the bride amen is just knocking
[1:30:16] right there on the door
[1:30:18] amen the potential is here available in
