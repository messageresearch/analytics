[1:15] it's good to be back in uh in in the
[1:17] Georgia Heat again
[1:19] yeah so winter hasn't officially
[1:22] finished up in Canada yeah uh when we
[1:25] got there the day we got there it snowed
[1:27] about five or six inches and uh
[1:30] and they said they they they had been
[1:33] about two or three weeks since they had
[1:34] gotten any snow of course they they had
[1:36] already were you go around they say I'm
[1:39] so tired of this snow that's what people
[1:41] tell you you know but then they had not
[1:43] gotten about two or three two or three
[1:45] weeks they had not it had not snowed
[1:46] even though it been cold temperatures
[1:49] and they said well you came from Georgia
[1:51] and you must have brought snow with you
[1:54] I said from
[1:56] where but at least I got to see some
[1:59] snow this year
[2:01] I had to go to Canada to see it cuz you
[2:02] sure didn't see it this year Harley so
[2:06] uh maybe some of you that live closer
[2:07] here to the mountains probably but not
[2:09] up there in brazzleton and those areas
[2:11] we didn't get anything so but it was
[2:13] nice and so we certainly enjoyed our the
[2:16] trip you know visiting my wife's family
[2:18] and seeing the little the the little
[2:20] baby that new family member that's come
[2:25] and uh she's healthy she's doing good
[2:27] and my sister-in-law she's doing good
[2:29] they're all doing doing good and uh I
[2:32] was able to uh I got to uh preach at
[2:35] brother John Dana church over there uh
[2:38] in Toronto and we really had a good time
[2:41] we had a we had a it was a blessing and
[2:44] uh I certainly think that the Lord you
[2:46] know uh he speaks you know you not
[2:50] knowing anything CU you don't go to the
[2:51] church that's right and he's he he
[2:54] speaks and for you know directly to
[2:57] needs that need to be met so we
[2:59] appreciate the Lord for doing that and
[3:01] so we certainly had a good time those
[3:03] people up there you know it's just
[3:05] majority of them are Africans so you
[3:07] know they're oh yeah they they love
[3:10] worship so you just you get along with
[3:13] you get along in there with you and you
[3:14] just get right on in amen there's no way
[3:17] for you to stay
[3:18] still but we had a good time and they
[3:21] all send greetings to you all amen
[3:23] praise the lord well let's uh let's go
[3:25] to the word this afternoon and uh I'm
[3:28] going to try my best not to keep you too
[3:30] long tonight but uh I have a little
[3:33] something I want to bring
[3:36] out and uh I hope that you enjoy it and
[3:41] that may get a blessing out of it amen
[3:45] amen so sometimes it's difficult for me
[3:48] to there's some messages you know that
[3:50] you just preach you'll preach but then
[3:52] some you know you just kind of wrestle
[3:54] with but uh I got this uh I just started
[3:58] thinking on this thought coming back
[4:00] from Canada I was listening to the seed
[4:02] is not air with a Shook and uh I just
[4:06] Lord just put this thought on my heart
[4:08] so you pray for me and see how the Lord
[4:10] how the Lord leads Amen in Luke chapter
[4:12] 2 verse 40 uh start at verse 40 it says
[4:16] and the child grew and waxed strong in
[4:19] spirit speaking of Jesus Christ filled
[4:22] with with wisdom and the grace of God
[4:24] was upon him now his parents went to
[4:27] Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the
[4:29] past Passover and when he was 12 years
[4:31] old they went up to Jerusalem after the
[4:34] custom of the feast and when they had
[4:36] fulfilled the days as they returned the
[4:39] child jesus carried behind in
[4:42] Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew
[4:45] not of it am that's really
[4:50] strange that's their their
[4:53] child and they knew not where he was
[4:56] at and they knew that he wasn't just any
[5:01] child Mary knew what what because the
[5:04] angel came to her and told him this son
[5:05] is going to be conceived by the Holy
[5:07] Ghost it wasn't even wasn't even
[5:09] Joseph's uh uh son amen but they
[5:13] supposing him to have been in the
[5:15] company went a Day's Journey a Day's
[5:19] Journey and they sought him among their
[5:21] kins folk and
[5:23] acquaintance and when they found him not
[5:26] they turned back again to Jerusalem
[5:28] seeking him
[5:30] and it came to pass that after three
[5:33] days so now we're about about four days
[5:36] here right cuz if it was a Day's Journey
[5:39] when they realized that that that they
[5:41] had lost him then it's a Day's Journey
[5:43] going back to Jerusalem and then they
[5:45] got to Jerusalem they couldn't find him
[5:47] then 3 days later they found him and
[5:50] after three days they found him in the
[5:52] temple sitting in the midst of the
[5:55] doctors both hearing them and asking
[5:58] them questions
[6:00] and all that heard him were astonished
[6:02] at his understanding and answers and
[6:05] when they saw him they were amazed and
[6:07] his mother said unto him son why H has
[6:10] thou thus dealt with us Behold thy
[6:14] father and I have sought thee
[6:19] Sorrowing and he said unto them how is
[6:22] it that you sought me wish ye not that I
[6:26] must be about my father's business
[6:29] and they understood not the saying which
[6:31] he spake unto them and he went down with
[6:35] them and came to Nazareth and was
[6:37] subject unto them but his mother kept
[6:40] all these saying in her heart and Jesus
[6:43] increased in wisdom and stature and in
[6:45] favor with God and man praise the lord
[6:48] lord add a blessing to the reading of
[6:49] the word let's just pray before we get
[6:51] seated our heavenly father we thank you
[6:53] Lord Jesus for this for the word Lord
[6:55] that you uh allowed us to read tonight
[6:57] father now Lord I just give myself
[7:00] father God to you Lord that you speak
[7:02] father God what needs to be spoken and
[7:05] Lord you say father God the things that
[7:06] need to be said Lord to edify the body
[7:09] of Christ Lord and to bring you glory
[7:11] and honor father God I'm subject to you
[7:14] lord I can't do nothing unless you
[7:16] you're the one that does it father and
[7:18] so Lord I ask father that you would just
[7:19] also be in in our midst and meet every
[7:21] need amongst us and we commit the
[7:23] service into your hands open our ears of
[7:25] our understanding that we may understand
[7:27] your word this evening in Jesus Christ
[7:29] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[7:31] seated tonight praise the
[7:37] Lord amen I just want to title this if I
[7:41] give it a title it's a must to be about
[7:44] the father's business it's a must
[7:47] because it's what Jesus said I must be
[7:49] about my father's business right amen
[7:52] and so we see here that in in in
[7:55] starting here at verse 42 that that
[7:57] Jesus was 12 years old very young amen
[8:00] and I have a 12-year-old daughter and
[8:03] and I can imagine you know how you know
[8:06] Jesus at that age was already growing
[8:09] and and had a certain knowledge because
[8:12] remember he came amen he came uh he came
[8:16] already he was the Messiah amen H but we
[8:19] know that he he he was anointed amen at
[8:22] the River Jordan amen but he was God the
[8:24] whole time amen and so we see here that
[8:27] at 12 years old he was already
[8:28] manifesting this to the people amen even
[8:31] to his parents and it says here in verse
[8:33] 42 and when he was 12 years old they
[8:35] went up to Jerusalem after the custom of
[8:37] the feast in other words they went to
[8:40] church amen that's right and they took
[8:42] their children to church too you see and
[8:45] they took Jesus to church amen they they
[8:48] were there doing exactly what they what
[8:50] needed what what they needed to do amen
[8:53] amen and um and so in verse 43 it says
[8:56] and when they had fulfilled the days as
[8:58] they returned the Child Jesus J carried
[8:59] behind in Jerusalem amen and Joseph and
[9:03] his mother knew not where uh knew not of
[9:05] it amen praise the lord it's it
[9:08] astonishes me that they didn't realize
[9:11] that what at one moment Jesus was with
[9:14] them and then in the next moment it
[9:15] wasn't with him
[9:17] no that's right and so we we we see
[9:21] because in the next verse we see that
[9:22] they were trying to search with him
[9:24] because what happened during that time
[9:27] and I'll show you a map here in just a
[9:29] moment but during that time people would
[9:30] travel long ways in in almost like
[9:33] Caravans and the reason why they would
[9:35] do that was because there were so many
[9:36] thieves and so many robbers and so many
[9:38] people that would want to hurt if you
[9:40] traveled individually you might get
[9:43] robbed you might you might get you know
[9:45] a lady might get raped or something you
[9:48] know something wrong would happen but if
[9:49] they would travel uh in in a caravan
[9:52] right we hear that word a lot nowadays a
[9:55] caravan amongst amongst a group of
[9:58] people then the people would feel much
[10:00] safer so it must have been a lot of
[10:02] people that were traveling with them
[10:03] because they were traveling with uh
[10:05] maybe Joseph's and maybe Mary's family
[10:07] members they were all going to Jerusalem
[10:11] to partake of of the feast and
[10:14] so all of a sudden they did what they
[10:17] did needed to do in
[10:19] Jerusalem and as they were traveling
[10:21] back to
[10:22] Nazareth they traveled the whole day and
[10:26] Jesus was not
[10:28] around so Joseph and Mary started
[10:31] looking for him amen their son started
[10:36] looking for
[10:37] him and sometimes Saints I wonder if if
[10:40] uh if they if they could do that with
[10:43] with Jesus amen how much how much
[10:46] sometimes are our our own children if we
[10:47] don't pay attention to what's going on
[10:49] in their lives right amen right
[10:53] sometimes if we don't if we're not if
[10:54] we're not involved in our in our in our
[10:56] children's lives right
[10:59] they're lost and you don't even realize
[11:03] it because you're consumed by what by by
[11:06] by by your own goal oh yeah you have a
[11:09] goal in
[11:10] mind oh my children are fine but you
[11:13] don't realize something Satan might be
[11:15] working behind the
[11:17] scenes you think everything is fine and
[11:20] dandy but Satan might be working behind
[11:22] the scenes
[11:24] right and so they started looking for
[11:27] Jesus amongst their kin folks and
[11:30] amongst their acquaintance looking among
[11:31] the
[11:33] Caravan where is Jesus where is he have
[11:36] you seen him isn't he I thought I
[11:38] thought I thought when we left he was
[11:40] right there walking behind you well he
[11:43] was but then all of a sudden he's not
[11:47] yeah well so they they they were
[11:49] searching they were probably got frantic
[11:51] so frantic that they the Bible says that
[11:53] they return back to Jerusalem to look
[11:54] for him right righten amen praise the
[11:57] Lord so just moving along amen so we see
[12:01] here that when they got to Jerusalem
[12:04] that after 3
[12:05] days amen after three days they found
[12:10] him in the temple right right amen
[12:14] sitting in the midst of the doctors both
[12:17] hearing them and asking them questions
[12:20] right amen now I like that because you
[12:24] know Jesus wasn't just there just just
[12:27] just to talk to them amen
[12:30] he wasn't just there just wanting to
[12:31] give every you know he's the one who's
[12:33] got I'm I'm God so you got to listen to
[12:35] me no he was there asking questions and
[12:38] listening right amen praise God and you
[12:41] know what Saints if you want people to
[12:42] listen to you you listen to them right
[12:46] you want people to respect you and to
[12:48] listen to you listen to them amen but
[12:51] sometimes we're so stuck on our word and
[12:53] what you know and we don't let nobody
[12:55] else say anything while we're while
[12:57] we're talking with them you know and and
[12:58] and and it's just it's just what I what
[13:01] I think and then when it's time for us
[13:02] to give uh what we want to say well you
[13:05] can't because they're overriding
[13:07] you but Jesus that wasn't Jesus right
[13:10] Jesus was right here he was listening
[13:12] and asking questions amen but of course
[13:15] the Bible says here in verse 47 and all
[13:18] that heard him were astonished at his
[13:20] understanding and
[13:22] answers which must have me meant that he
[13:25] was also being asked questions and he
[13:28] was giving them them answers right
[13:30] praise the Lord that's right now going
[13:33] back to verse 45 and they found him uh
[13:35] back to verse 45 and when they found him
[13:37] not when they were amongst their the the
[13:39] looking amongst their kin folks they
[13:41] turned back again to Jerusalem seeking
[13:43] him amen I wonder sometimes saints that
[13:45] if you know uh uh uh with our own with
[13:48] our own children or with our own you
[13:50] know we've given them to the Lord you
[13:53] know we've we've committed them to the
[13:56] Lord this just goes for all all of our
[13:58] parent all the parents you know
[14:00] including me because Saints you know I'm
[14:03] I'm not if my if my children they don't
[14:05] have their own experience with God I
[14:06] can't I can't I can't lead them I I can
[14:09] lead them up to a certain point but they
[14:11] have to have their own experience with
[14:12] God Amen but don't think because they
[14:15] come to Lula that they're going to just
[14:16] automatically get the Holy Ghost or
[14:19] because they go to a to a to a youth
[14:21] camp that that's it you know God's going
[14:23] to I I I I am for anything that will
[14:27] help them get closer to God God Amen
[14:30] youth camps including everything you see
[14:32] bring them to church amen do whatever
[14:34] you need to do amen but it's ultimately
[14:36] up to them to serve the Lord and make
[14:38] that decision you can't make that
[14:40] decision for them and you can't be their
[14:43] Holy Ghost the the rest of their life
[14:46] amen sometimes sometimes we we we we get
[14:49] so so comfortable in our ways and and
[14:54] and forget that our children need God
[14:56] right amen
[14:59] our children need the baptism of the
[15:00] Holy Ghost in their life that they need
[15:03] a new birth just like you and I had to
[15:05] get a new birth amen oh my here comes
[15:08] brother Luis
[15:10] again oh we were so it was fine when
[15:13] brother Dell and brother Wade we were
[15:15] But Here Comes brother Luis now
[15:20] oh I got to preach whatever God puts in
[15:23] my heart
[15:24] right amen
[15:29] so it's uh it's our responsibility I was
[15:31] telling the church up there saints that
[15:35] you know God has given us the
[15:37] responsibility of our children you see
[15:39] he's given them to us right to nurture
[15:41] them to take care of them to train them
[15:43] in the way that they should
[15:44] go and God you're going to answer to God
[15:47] if you don't that's right if you don't
[15:49] train them in the ways of the Bible if
[15:51] you don't train them in the ways of the
[15:52] word you're going to have to answer for
[15:53] that right right
[15:56] amen but if you've done everything you
[15:59] could and they still go astray then
[16:01] that's between them and God you see
[16:04] that's between them and God they'll have
[16:06] to answer for that amen so I'm not
[16:10] saying here that nothing like that would
[16:12] ever happen to my to my daughters it
[16:14] could but I'm just putting them in the
[16:16] hands of God and that's all we can do as
[16:19] parents and do everything we can on our
[16:22] part to help them grow in in in in in in
[16:26] God Amen to let you know get them
[16:29] involved in things that that that would
[16:31] help them grow in the Lord amen you see
[16:34] what I'm saying I said last time I said
[16:37] you know brother Joe I appreciate what
[16:38] he's doing with these tape quizzes right
[16:41] that's awesome but really really how
[16:44] many how many of you are really involved
[16:46] doing these tape quizzes with your
[16:51] children amen so it's up to you Saints
[16:53] to to realize and to understand what are
[16:56] your kids in involved amen right because
[16:59] I because God gave them to us and so oh
[17:01] well I I got to give them their space I
[17:05] I got to give them their their their
[17:07] time you know their space and and and
[17:10] they have to have you know you know what
[17:12] as long as they're living in your house
[17:14] Saints yeah you do what I do here what I
[17:17] do here and if you don't like it you go
[17:19] find your own place if you can that's
[17:22] right if you
[17:25] can because I'm the one who has to
[17:27] answer for you amen
[17:29] before God you see you go astray because
[17:32] of me
[17:34] no no you're not going astray because of
[17:36] me amen you go astray because you want
[17:38] to go astray right but as long as you're
[17:41] here amongst our home amen you're going
[17:43] to do what the things that we do at our
[17:45] home right amen that's the then that's
[17:47] the way it should go because Saints
[17:49] we've gone Satan's gone to one
[17:51] extreme right he's gone to the he's gone
[17:54] to the Other Extreme and we are we need
[17:57] to go to the Other Extreme amen right
[17:59] Amen in order to protect our children
[18:01] amen the most that we can praise God
[18:04] Amen and so let's just continue reading
[18:07] here and when they saw
[18:09] him in verse 48 and when they saw him
[18:12] they were amazed and his mother said
[18:14] unto him son why H has thou thus dealt
[18:16] with us Behold thy father and I have
[18:20] sought thee Sorrowing amen um the
[18:23] brother brother Joe if you could or some
[18:27] whoever's back there can can you bring
[18:28] up
[18:29] the map that and you apologize Saints
[18:32] I'm going back and forth different
[18:35] things
[18:36] but I just want you to get a visual to
[18:38] show you how long Nazareth is from
[18:41] Jerusalem here's Nazareth this is where
[18:43] they started from and this is Jerusalem
[18:45] right down here now the Bible said now
[18:48] according to Google Maps that's about 95
[18:52] and a half
[18:53] miles and it's in car you can get there
[18:56] in about an hour and 45 minutes but they
[18:59] didn't have cars back then obviously so
[19:01] you see they had to go through
[19:04] mountains and really from the things
[19:07] that I was reading a lot of them they
[19:10] they avoided they would avoid going
[19:12] through
[19:12] Samaria because they didn't they didn't
[19:14] want to have anything to do with the
[19:16] Samaritans so they would take long ways
[19:19] to get to uh usually around this route
[19:22] to get to Jerusalem so that's the reason
[19:24] why the Bible says that they had already
[19:26] went a day Journey so really probably
[19:29] they might have traveled even longer
[19:31] than than a than a day I don't know
[19:33] maybe a Day's Journey uh walking and
[19:36] riding on on on on donkeys could have
[19:39] been just right here to Ephraim you see
[19:42] so they they traveled a long way but a
[19:45] Day's Journey they
[19:47] traveled and they had left Jesus
[19:50] behind I wonder how many sometimes
[19:52] Saints if we're traveling on this road
[19:54] and we and we forget that we left Jesus
[19:57] behind brother
[20:00] traveling on this uh you know to our
[20:02] goal our goal is heaven right our goal
[20:06] is to be like Christ am our goal is to
[20:08] be more like this word am and we forget
[20:12] the the the basics of this word amen the
[20:16] the the things that that really matter
[20:18] because we get so consumed with
[20:20] everything
[20:21] else and I'll get consumed with the
[20:24] things that really matter that's going
[20:25] to help us grow and and one of those
[20:27] things is coming to church
[20:32] amen one of those things is coming to
[20:34] church every day I mean every you come
[20:37] to church every day that'd be great but
[20:39] but whenever these Church doors are
[20:42] open how are you going to grow in Christ
[20:45] Prophet said read the Bible and pray
[20:47] every day right amen listen to the word
[20:52] praise
[20:53] God not just not just one day out one
[20:56] day out of the year amen but every every
[20:58] single day be engaged in the word
[21:00] Brothers can turn that off amen so 92
[21:04] and2 miles that they
[21:08] traveled amen so we see here that
[21:11] Jesus even as a child as a child he was
[21:16] putting a higher priority in his
[21:18] father's business right over his even
[21:22] over his mom and dad's
[21:25] business now that doesn't mean that that
[21:28] he didn't obey them and he didn't
[21:31] respect them because we see there in
[21:32] later on in scriptures that he he obeyed
[21:35] them in in in everything he was subject
[21:36] to them right but he had something to do
[21:40] there in Jerusalem right that he needed
[21:42] to stay back and listen and and and be
[21:45] there to what to be about his father's
[21:48] business right amen now his father
[21:51] wasn't Joseph
[21:53] right his father was Goden the Holy
[21:56] Ghost right amen amen praise God
[22:01] glory and
[22:03] so we need to understand Saints what is
[22:06] the father's business amen right because
[22:09] whatever the father's business is that
[22:11] must mean that that's his will right
[22:14] right amen whatever the father's
[22:17] business is that must mean that that's
[22:19] his will and what is his will is his
[22:21] word right amen so when you are involved
[22:25] in the father's business that means you
[22:27] must be for you must must be involved in
[22:29] something having to do with the word
[22:31] amen and that's all Jesus cared about
[22:34] even at 12 years
[22:37] old all about fulfilling the father's
[22:40] business right well you say well I'm not
[22:43] when I get to be 16 years old I'll I'll
[22:45] be about my father's business
[22:48] no oh well Jesus did that at 12 years
[22:51] old because he was
[22:54] God you've been trained properly yeah
[22:57] you know better
[22:59] better and like I said before I know
[23:02] I've been around young people and I know
[23:05] young people who have said the exact
[23:06] same thing oh yeah I'll serve God later
[23:09] and two years later they were in a jail
[23:11] cell right I know that's for a fat y
[23:16] they were in a jail cell and in the jail
[23:18] cell they they they said they said I you
[23:21] know now okay you were right the whole
[23:23] time or my parents were right the whole
[23:25] time and it was too late then yeah you
[23:28] see don't wait to that young young
[23:31] people don't wait till you commit some
[23:34] atrocity in your life or something
[23:36] happens to you for you to go serve God
[23:39] right amen you need to serve God now
[23:41] while he while he can still be found
[23:46] amen well he can still yet be found you
[23:49] are you're you're alive and you're
[23:51] breathing and you're here because God of
[23:54] his because of God's mercy and Grace on
[23:56] you amen
[23:59] it's because you have something to
[24:00] fulfill y you have something to do Jesus
[24:04] at 12 years old he was in the father's
[24:06] business amen so at 12 years old amen I
[24:10] believe a kid can be in the father's
[24:12] business as well amen amen obviously we
[24:15] can't push them amen but we can train
[24:17] them in the way they should go right
[24:20] exactly amen praise the Lord and create
[24:23] and and allow those atmospheres for them
[24:25] to be in those atmospheres that will
[24:27] help them to be in the father's business
[24:31] right
[24:33] amen so in order for you to be able to
[24:37] uh uh partake in the father's business
[24:40] or to be able to tell others about the
[24:41] father's business uh you know let's like
[24:45] let's say for example you were trying to
[24:46] sell a product you know and uh and
[24:50] you're trying to sell it to the people
[24:52] and you're trying to tell them how great
[24:53] this product is and oh it's wonderful TR
[24:57] try it but you have never tried it
[24:59] yourself yeah come on brother
[25:02] amen how in the world are you going to
[25:04] be uh uh um how are you going to uh uh
[25:08] let them realize that this product is
[25:11] wonderful if you have never tried the
[25:13] product yourself amen you need to test
[25:16] him for yourself amen you as a parent
[25:19] need to test God for yourself amen
[25:22] before you can say well you know I I've
[25:24] I've I've preached in different churches
[25:27] and and you see reactions and you say
[25:29] something and you're you're going a
[25:31] certain line and all of a sudden you see
[25:34] a a a mom or or a father I was on they
[25:37] look over at their
[25:39] child
[25:40] yeah oh yeah and the child and and yeah
[25:45] and and you know that they LED them to
[25:47] that place wherever whatever it is there
[25:49] it was their fault that they're in that
[25:51] position the parents fault it wasn't
[25:53] their
[25:53] fault but they're over there looking at
[25:56] them
[25:59] yeah it happened to me this past
[26:05] Sunday and you and you're like my
[26:08] goodness and and you know it was that's
[26:09] what brother Brown said it's parent
[26:12] delinquency parent delinquency it's what
[26:15] US parents lack to do we we we we we
[26:19] we're not involved with with the word
[26:21] like we should but we expect our
[26:22] children
[26:24] to see how can you tell them about the
[26:27] product when you haven't even tried the
[26:28] product yourself that's right how can
[26:30] you tell them that you must be about the
[26:32] father's business when you haven't
[26:34] you're not even in the father's business
[26:36] at
[26:38] all
[26:41] amen praise the
[26:43] Lord so again we know that the father's
[26:47] business is his will amen and his will
[26:49] glory is his word amen right now Jesus
[26:54] said uh to his disciples in in John
[26:56] chapter 20 in verse vers 21 he says as
[26:59] the father sent me so send I you amen
[27:04] and um I want to stay
[27:06] with this thought you know about the
[27:09] father's business but I want to switch
[27:11] gears here just a
[27:14] moment I just wanted
[27:17] to encourage the parents there for just
[27:19] for just a moment just taking that story
[27:21] but I want to stay within the same story
[27:23] but I want to I want to address
[27:25] something amen because Saints we're
[27:27] living in an hour that
[27:30] uh uh it's a
[27:32] Sly the spirit that that is creeping in
[27:36] amen it's very Sly Amen in this hour you
[27:40] know we live in the in the age of the
[27:41] pel horse rider right and he's mixed and
[27:45] you don't know what's what and what's
[27:47] what you know it's hard to decipher you
[27:49] see it's a very difficult thing in this
[27:52] hour and that's the reason why people
[27:53] are going straight I you know if you
[27:55] knew some of the things that I've that
[27:57] I've that I've uh that I've realized and
[27:59] and and that I've come to find out uh
[28:03] people are just just dying spiritually
[28:05] like flies and people that you don't
[28:07] think that that that would that would go
[28:09] certain directions and and yet they're
[28:12] in that that's right yeah and uh and so
[28:17] I was talking to a brother up in Canada
[28:19] and he he was telling me how you know he
[28:22] he he a he was an African brother and uh
[28:24] he lived in in in Hong Kong for a while
[28:27] and and uh he told me he was telling me
[28:31] how there's some there there's I thought
[28:33] that there was only just one church over
[28:35] there which was brother Ro's church but
[28:37] apparently he said that there was there
[28:39] was other there was two other churches
[28:41] there but but they were churches they
[28:43] were uh churches that uh they were tape
[28:46] churches and so and
[28:50] so wherever wherever I go you know
[28:53] there's there seems like it seems like
[28:54] you know churches that seem to be
[28:56] established yeah
[28:59] now going to a certain
[29:03] direction they don't they don't go to
[29:05] they don't go to church
[29:07] anymore and so it's a very sight spirit
[29:10] in this hour saints that is is not only
[29:13] it's say Saints it's attacking the
[29:16] messag in the name of the
[29:19] messag it's exactly what it's doing amen
[29:22] yeah and
[29:25] uh you know and I the Saints I'm not
[29:28] here to attack individuals and that's
[29:30] not what that's not my purpose and I'm
[29:33] you know I'm not here no name calling or
[29:34] anything like that but I'm here to
[29:36] attack spirits and expose Spirits amen
[29:40] and uh because Saints this is right now
[29:43] it seems to me that this is probably one
[29:44] of the most prevalent Spirit that's
[29:46] going on right now you know doctrines
[29:49] that have come and gone from the 70s and
[29:51] the 80s and brother Dale you've you
[29:53] you've you've experienced some of these
[29:55] things um they've come in gone yeah you
[29:59] don't hear much about you know Thunders
[30:01] and and the Thunder movement and all
[30:03] these different
[30:04] things now it's it's about just staying
[30:07] with the tapes staying with the
[30:09] tapes and I hope I'm not overstepping my
[30:12] boundaries but I want to get I want to I
[30:13] want I want to make a point amen amen
[30:16] that I believe I believe in staying with
[30:18] the tapes I believe in in in in
[30:20] listening to the tapes amen amen cuz
[30:22] that's the message amen praise God and
[30:27] one of the things that they seem they
[30:28] seem to to to to use as a quote in in
[30:32] the church age book I believe it's in
[30:34] the sardan age where brother randam
[30:37] talks about that every a uh that at the
[30:40] last day the messenger came in the last
[30:42] day to restore back everything that the
[30:46] that the five-fold ministry had gone
[30:47] astray
[30:49] in and and uh and that that that
[30:55] restoration you know that that that
[30:57] meant that that needed for us to stay
[30:59] just exclusively with the with with with
[31:02] the tapes but say I you know if it was a
[31:06] complete restoration back to the word
[31:08] and if it was a complete restoration
[31:09] back to what Paul preached Paul believed
[31:11] in
[31:14] preaching so he believed in preaching
[31:17] and so and so that's the reason if it
[31:20] was a restoration back to the word of
[31:22] God Amen it wasn't a restoration to do
[31:25] something that's that's outside of the
[31:27] word of God amen no praise the
[31:31] Lord
[31:33] amen so it's a SL it's a Sly spirit in
[31:36] this hour and you know the Bible says
[31:37] saints that in this in this day there
[31:40] they would they would kill you yep
[31:44] thinking that they're doing God a
[31:45] service amen that's not the Catholic
[31:49] church in this
[31:50] hour that's not a Baptist and that's not
[31:53] a
[31:54] Pentecostal
[31:55] no I believe it's within the same same
[31:58] ranks
[32:00] am and you and you don't believe me you
[32:03] go to YouTube you go to uh some of these
[32:06] websites and they just
[32:08] attacking churches that have a five-fold
[32:12] Ministry like like it's gone out of
[32:15] style yeah like it's gone out of style
[32:17] it's it's incredible to
[32:19] me but we see that all it is Saints here
[32:24] we are here we see people leaving the
[32:25] message right
[32:29] saying that that brother Brandon was not
[32:30] a prophet and that and that he's uh you
[32:33] know false and all these
[32:35] things uh attacking the message yeah but
[32:39] then here's another group
[32:41] that try staying saying with the message
[32:44] but yet attacking it at the same time
[32:47] because that's not what brother Brandon
[32:49] preached completely misconstruing quotes
[32:52] to fit their own
[32:55] agendas man yes so to me it takes away
[32:59] from the scriptures am you have to get
[33:03] away from the scriptures in order for
[33:05] you to believe a certain thing like that
[33:07] that's right you you have to you have to
[33:10] deny certain scriptures one of the
[33:12] scriptures I'm going to say right now is
[33:14] 1 Timothy chap 2 verse one amen if they
[33:16] want to bring that
[33:21] up this is Paul speaking to Timothy thou
[33:25] therefore my son be strong in the grace
[33:27] that is in Christ Christ Jesus and the
[33:29] things that thou Hast heard of me among
[33:32] many witnesses the same commit thou to
[33:36] Faithful Men amen who shall be able to
[33:39] teach others also amen right so Paul was
[33:43] saying in other words Paul was saying
[33:45] whatever I'm preaching Timothy I want
[33:47] you to go uh commit uh these things to
[33:51] Faithful Men to faithful witnesses to
[33:53] preach these same things that I was
[33:55] preaching y right
[33:59] and obviously they didn't have any tapes
[34:00] back then so they couldn't play what
[34:03] Paul was
[34:05] saying it was for them to go out and
[34:07] preach the word and teach the word
[34:10] right who shall be able to teach others
[34:13] also thou therefore endure hardness as
[34:17] good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that
[34:20] worth entangleth himself with the
[34:22] Affairs of this life that he may please
[34:25] him who ha chosen him to be a soldier so
[34:27] Saints one that's really Waring for the
[34:30] Lord in other words he's in the father's
[34:32] business doesn't entangle himself with
[34:35] things like this amen doesn't entangle
[34:37] himself with the things of this world
[34:39] Amen you know I respect you more if you
[34:41] say I don't believe this message anymore
[34:43] and you just go out and don't serve the
[34:44] Lord anymore that's right but when you
[34:46] come and you and you come against this
[34:48] message and that 24/7 that's all you do
[34:50] online
[34:52] yeah I I guess you you have you have
[34:55] nothing else to do that's right you must
[34:57] live a pretty boring life
[35:00] yeah amen
[35:02] amen and that's what some of these
[35:04] people do but saints that is that is the
[35:06] spirit of this hour that's attacking the
[35:08] the the message amen that's attacking
[35:10] the word of God coming from this Ang
[35:13] from this side people leaving the word
[35:15] and saying oh because of preachers such
[35:17] and such they uh I I got I got uh my mom
[35:21] was beat up and I got beat up and and
[35:24] and and this this and that and the other
[35:25] but then here's on this side
[35:28] because of preachers such and
[35:31] such we have to stay home and just
[35:33] listen to tapes it's the same Spirit
[35:36] that's right it's the same Spirit just
[35:39] working in different angles one of them
[35:41] just has more of a smile that's right
[35:43] the other one just has more of a grading
[35:45] of the tea oh yeah that's right brother
[35:47] amen that's
[35:51] right look what brother brandom says
[35:53] here in the in the message we would see
[35:55] Jesus they would bring that
[36:02] up that we you know saints that like I
[36:05] said we're not we're we don't fight
[36:06] these web you know do doctrines anymore
[36:09] and the and these things that you know
[36:11] but this is the thing right now that
[36:13] that's that's prevalent in this hour and
[36:15] and Saints it sounds so good it sounds
[36:18] so enticing oh
[36:21] yeah oh yeah that's that's that's right
[36:25] yeah I could just stay at home and just
[36:27] I go to church I could just hit
[36:32] play
[36:36] man that's what leads to it leads to
[36:38] laziness that's right
[36:41] amen now let's see what he did let's
[36:43] follow his ministry just a few moments
[36:45] we find him the first thing after John
[36:47] had baptized him the Holy Spirit coming
[36:50] from heaven and descending upon him and
[36:52] remaining in him John said upon whom
[36:54] Thou shalt see the spirit descending and
[36:56] remain he is the one that will baptize
[36:58] with the Holy Ghost and now notice we
[37:01] find immediately after his temptation he
[37:03] went straight to the father's business
[37:05] exactly what was the business preaching
[37:08] the gospel and Healing The Sick amen if
[37:11] any day any age
[37:14] right
[37:16] amen that now that's just one of the the
[37:20] the the one some of the ones that I got
[37:22] here amen if they if they go question
[37:24] and answers on Hebrews next one
[37:28] I appreciate them I I gave them these
[37:31] these things and and I didn't give them
[37:33] in in the in the outline that that that
[37:35] we usually give him so brother Joe I
[37:38] appreciate he's
[37:40] always he always has my
[37:43] back all of our back father it is noted
[37:47] that when you were 12 years old you were
[37:48] found in the temple with the scribes and
[37:50] the sages discussing with them the
[37:52] scriptures and they were they were
[37:55] astonished at a man of old and
[37:56] well-trained in the scriptures and yet
[37:58] see a little boy of about 12 years old
[38:00] could just confounding in the in the
[38:03] explaining of the scriptures you was
[38:06] about your father's business right
[38:09] that's right again he he he he he's he's
[38:12] he's referring to the explaining of the
[38:14] scriptures right amen
[38:17] amen because Saints as I said before I
[38:21] you know I've traveled different parts
[38:22] of the world and people have the same
[38:25] message that you do but they some they
[38:28] don't they don't understand it the same
[38:29] way that that maybe God has revealed it
[38:31] to you why because they don't have
[38:34] somebody there to explain it to them to
[38:36] teach it to them sir and maybe the
[38:39] pastor or the the minister uh has gotten
[38:43] up to a certain Revelation and that's as
[38:45] far as they can they can
[38:46] go and maybe maybe some maybe uh God
[38:50] sent you or God sent brother Wade to go
[38:52] to the Philippines Amen to bring certain
[38:54] things out that helped amen that's
[38:57] that's what a minister does is to take
[38:59] the the scale out out of our eyes amen
[39:01] so that we can see the scriptures better
[39:03] that's right but taking the word of God
[39:05] that brother Brandon preached amen
[39:07] taking the message Amen to them and just
[39:09] opening that up a bit more to them amen
[39:13] but you can't give him the
[39:14] Revelation I can't reveal nothing to you
[39:17] neither can brother Dale nobody can
[39:19] reveal anything to you it has to take
[39:20] God to reveal it to you
[39:23] amen through the explaining of the
[39:25] scriptures amen praise God
[39:31] Amen so we see here saints that um you
[39:35] turn that off for just a
[39:43] moment now we know that that when the
[39:46] angel
[39:47] Gabriel came to came to Mary and we know
[39:50] that he was the messenger right Angel uh
[39:53] came to Mary and to give her the
[39:56] message the word for that day right amen
[39:59] of what she needed to to to hear amen
[40:02] and
[40:04] uh neither the angel messenger nor the
[40:08] message he gave her could do nothing for
[40:11] her unless she believed it y she had to
[40:16] receive it amen exactly and believe it
[40:19] even though she couldn't explain it yeah
[40:22] that's right now
[40:24] remember she said to him how can this be
[40:28] sin that I know not a man she she did
[40:30] question it and she had all the right to
[40:33] because that had never happened before
[40:35] amen it wasn't anywhere in the Scripture
[40:38] it was only in the Old Testament as a
[40:41] prophecy but they the describes and the
[40:43] Pharisees and all of them that they
[40:45] couldn't they couldn't explain
[40:47] it and so she questioned and said how
[40:50] can this be I've not not been a man and
[40:53] so the angel proceeds to explain to her
[40:55] that the Holy Ghost will overshadowed
[40:58] you amen and that that Holy thing that
[41:00] is to be that is to be birthed in you
[41:02] amen is of the Holy Ghost amen praise
[41:05] the Lord so we see there we see there
[41:08] that that messenger came and gave her
[41:11] amen the message amen she had to have
[41:13] faith in it and accept it the way it was
[41:16] brought right right amen right and I
[41:20] totally agree that we need to accept and
[41:23] receive the way the message was brought
[41:25] to us amen yes sir amen
[41:27] I I I believe it with all my heart
[41:30] amen but that doesn't the message
[41:32] doesn't go override the Bible amen it
[41:35] goes along with the Bible you can't say
[41:38] I believe the message and then and then
[41:41] it's in some way or another it's
[41:42] overriding the Bible it can't amen and
[41:46] that's what's happening in this hour the
[41:48] the people preaching these things or
[41:51] preaching saying these things or
[41:54] admonishing the people of these things
[41:58] it's what they're
[42:00] saying you you've got to override the
[42:02] Bible in order to believe that way right
[42:05] brother you because that is not what
[42:07] brother brandham taught no it's not amen
[42:10] it's not what brother brandham taught no
[42:13] that you
[42:15] know the tapes only and and and and
[42:18] that's it and and that the five-fold
[42:21] ministry has there's no use for the fful
[42:23] ministry then you just like brother Dale
[42:25] I said before let's just take that page
[42:26] out of the
[42:28] Bible let's just take that out of the
[42:30] Bible because it doesn't need to be
[42:32] there there's no use for the fal
[42:33] Ministry anymore let's close up and
[42:35] let's just go home yeah
[42:38] why but you can you know there's
[42:40] lemonade at your house and you can sit
[42:42] back and let's just listen to a tape you
[42:45] don't need to be
[42:48] here
[42:50] amen but now Saints when the seed was
[42:53] placed uh in Mary by God
[42:58] which is the Holy Ghost the scripture
[43:00] I'm trying to go slow so that we can get
[43:03] what I'm
[43:04] saying we know that brother bam spoke
[43:07] about Mary being the carrier of that
[43:09] seed
[43:10] amen she carried that that that that
[43:13] that son in her
[43:15] amen and in this hour of saints amen
[43:18] there's a bride that is to give birth to
[43:20] the son
[43:21] amen this bride is carrying the son amen
[43:25] that has been that that that God has
[43:28] placed in her
[43:30] amen by the by the Holy Ghost amen and
[43:34] it has to come through the word of God
[43:36] Amen again I cannot give you a
[43:39] revelation brother Dale brother Wade
[43:41] brother Bob brother Aaron nobody can
[43:43] give you a revelation no man it has to
[43:46] be God himself to give the Revelation
[43:48] and even not even brother brandham can
[43:51] give you a revelation through through
[43:52] the
[43:54] tapes that's the reason why the people
[43:57] out there amen they listen to the
[43:59] message but some things they cannot
[44:03] explain but then here comes a brother
[44:05] that God has given him some uh uh some
[44:09] some I guess some light into the into
[44:11] the word taking the message amen right
[44:14] and shed and they can shed some light to
[44:17] the people amen and yet we don't want
[44:20] that to go out to the people that really
[44:22] need it
[44:23] right no just you you don't need that
[44:26] just stay home and listen to the
[44:34] tapes so that son Saints it was being
[44:37] formed in her right just as the son is
[44:41] being formed in this bride today
[44:43] amen now I want you to look at this amen
[44:46] because she she get she she was pregnant
[44:49] with the word right right she's pregnant
[44:51] with the word absolutely now Joseph the
[44:54] Bible says that Joseph was going to was
[44:57] going to tell her uh you know I I don't
[44:59] want to live with you I I don't want to
[45:01] marry you right right but if it wasn't
[45:03] for a dream that and a that that God
[45:06] gave him amen he was going to he was
[45:09] going to uh uh uh uh privately let her
[45:12] go that's right amen not to make an
[45:14] example of her Amen to the
[45:17] public so Joseph he continued and stayed
[45:20] with her married her and everything
[45:21] right
[45:22] right now Joseph amen obviously and you
[45:26] just think about this obviously Mary had
[45:29] to tell Joseph what the angel had told
[45:31] her her right sure exactly and so just
[45:34] as much as Mary had to believe that
[45:36] Joseph had to believe that as well
[45:39] especially if it was part of the word
[45:41] amen exactly right if it was part of the
[45:44] word my yeah because I Joseph knows I
[45:47] didn't have anything to do with
[45:49] it right you see amen so he had to also
[45:54] believe it supernaturally as well that
[45:56] it was a Supernatural event that had
[45:58] taken place in his wife's uh uh body
[46:02] amen and so here they go and it's almost
[46:05] time they go to to get to get taxed and
[46:07] so she Joseph had to nurture her had to
[46:12] help her that's right had to had to
[46:15] minister to her there you
[46:18] go Amen on brother just as
[46:23] much as I had to do it when my wife was
[46:26] pregnant yeah
[46:27] yeah that's right I don't think he just
[46:30] kind of you just let he just left her
[46:32] you know and didn't didn't you just f
[46:34] for your own no because the Bible says
[46:36] that when they were traveling to go get
[46:39] taxed she was on top of a beast right
[46:44] that represented to me represents the
[46:46] Holy
[46:47] Ghost Joseph pulling her Joseph wasn't
[46:51] doing the Joseph was not the one doing
[46:53] the work she was riding on top of that
[46:55] Beast amen but it was the Beast that was
[46:58] had the power to carry her amen where
[47:00] she needed to go all Joseph was doing
[47:02] was just kind of stir leading her to
[47:04] where she needed to go right pregnant
[47:06] with this with this word of God amen
[47:09] amen right now we know that brother
[47:12] brandom spoke about the same thing this
[47:14] almost the same thing when he spoke
[47:15] about
[47:16] Rebecca when elzer came to her right and
[47:21] he said listen uh you want to go meet
[47:23] Isaac and she said yes I do so she got
[47:27] on top of the camel and brother Brown
[47:30] mentions this and says that represented
[47:32] the holy spirit that power amen eler all
[47:35] he was there was just guiding the the
[47:38] the the the the the bride that was on
[47:40] top of the camel guiding it to to take
[47:42] her to Isaac amen but he was not doing
[47:45] the work it was the camel the the Beast
[47:48] that was actually doing the he the heavy
[47:50] work amen and it's the Holy Ghost in you
[47:53] in this hour that's doing the heavy work
[47:55] amen right but there needs to be a
[47:58] minister in the in the midst right not
[48:01] just one minister right it's a five-fold
[48:04] Ministry amen amen
[48:07] amen so there was
[48:10] Mary she needed to be ministered too she
[48:13] needed to be encouraged because
[48:15] sometimes I'm sure as you s some of you
[48:17] sisters who have who have had children
[48:19] have gotten to a point like I don't know
[48:21] if I could have this baby or
[48:24] not oh God help help me oh help me and
[48:28] Joseph had to be right there Listen
[48:30] sweetheart listen honey you can do it
[48:32] amen remember what the what the angel
[48:34] said the the word of God says this and
[48:37] you are the one to fulfill this you are
[48:39] the one to come to this position to give
[48:42] birth to this son right isn't that what
[48:45] the fful ministry is doing in this
[48:47] hour amen amen we're not adding anything
[48:49] to the word or anything to the message
[48:51] we're just complimenting to out make you
[48:54] uh uh uh bring the message to you to
[48:56] remember
[48:59] amen praise
[49:02] God so if we were if we are doing this
[49:05] amen why are we being attacked yeah just
[49:09] because some some ministers some
[49:12] preachers went astray and and took five
[49:16] wives and and did this and did that that
[49:18] doesn't mean that all the ministers are
[49:20] like
[49:22] that there's some bad apples that's
[49:24] right that but that doesn't doesn't mean
[49:27] but they're still good apples amen that
[49:29] that that that doesn't mean that the
[49:30] whole batch you just need to throw away
[49:32] the whole batch amen because that means
[49:35] you just have to throw away the word of
[49:37] God you know there's things in the word
[49:40] of God that talk
[49:43] about about the ministry amen that's
[49:46] right praise the
[49:49] Lord
[49:52] so let's let's look at Luke chapter 2
[49:55] verse 48 amen
[49:57] we we already read this or just go
[50:02] back brother Joe this is the beginning
[50:05] the the the scripture at the beginning
[50:07] I'll just read it and he'll pull it up
[50:09] and he says and when they saw
[50:12] him they were amazed this is going back
[50:16] to the story of when Jesus was being
[50:18] sought after their mom and dad and his
[50:21] Mo and his mother said unto him son why
[50:24] H has thou dealt with us
[50:27] Behold thy
[50:29] father and I have sought thee
[50:32] Sorrowing now here is Mary saying that
[50:36] Joseph was Jesus's
[50:38] father
[50:41] yeah now think about this Mary
[50:45] Mary it went through what she did the
[50:48] angel spoke to her Joseph know what what
[50:52] what the angel said but here's here's
[50:54] Mary saying
[50:58] or or or or
[51:01] proclaiming that Joseph was her
[51:04] father and so Jesus says and he said
[51:07] unto them how is it that ye sought me
[51:09] Wiis ye not that I must be about my
[51:11] father's
[51:12] business amen and so that's how the Mary
[51:16] of today which is the bride of Christ
[51:19] Saints who is supposed to know that the
[51:21] father of Jesus Christ is Jehovah God
[51:24] Amen the Holy Spirit
[51:26] amen and that her father is Jesus Christ
[51:30] a
[51:32] husband amen they are now looking for
[51:35] another
[51:39] father they they know who the father
[51:43] is now they're looking for for for for
[51:46] somebody else to lead them along
[51:49] yeah knowing who the who who the father
[51:52] really is amen
[52:00] instead of staying with the leading of
[52:02] the holy spirit amen right through the
[52:05] message that God already gave us through
[52:08] the prophet amen right
[52:10] amen they're looking at somebody
[52:14] else they're looking at they're they're
[52:16] looking at at a
[52:19] Joseph to be in the
[52:22] father think about that
[52:24] Saints I'll let you I'll let you chew on
[52:27] that for a little
[52:30] while as as Mary knew who the real
[52:33] father
[52:35] was you see and now she's proclaiming
[52:38] here that that that that Joseph is the
[52:42] father now look what brother brandham
[52:44] says here in the message Shalom 1964
[52:48] this is after the
[52:52] seals the brothers will bring it up
[53:01] notice how Mary is so wrong but his word
[53:04] is so perfect am yeah she said to him
[53:08] when she found him in the temple at 12
[53:11] discussing with the theologians he
[53:14] astounded them as a 12-year-old boy not
[53:17] even in school or if it is we have no
[53:19] record of it but a 12-year-old lad
[53:21] confounding the sages in the temple at
[53:24] his wisdom she said thy father and I
[53:27] have sought thee with tears thy father
[53:31] the mother herself supposingly said thy
[53:33] father Joseph and I have sought thee
[53:35] with tears what did he say to her know
[53:38] ye not that I must be about my father's
[53:40] business if he had been about Joseph's
[53:42] business he'd have been making houses or
[53:44] in a carpenter shop but he wasn't
[53:46] Joseph's son amen I about my father's
[53:50] business correcting these denominations
[53:52] and Creeds and things I hear of and let
[53:54] me tell you saints that these things are
[53:56] going on today is just as much
[53:57] denomination amen that's right as any
[54:00] other denomination yes yes abolutely if
[54:03] you say if you say just do this and
[54:07] that's it that's a denomination to me
[54:13] brother see I'm about my father's
[54:15] business he never admitted Joseph was
[54:17] his father but Mary did and he turned
[54:20] back around and straightened her out she
[54:23] said your father and I have sought you
[54:25] he said I'm about my father's business
[54:26] business showing Joseph wasn't his
[54:28] father am his words are perfect see but
[54:31] Mary and them listen to this but Mary
[54:33] and them just presuming
[54:36] that well see what it was she got
[54:38] carried
[54:40] away I believe that's what's happening
[54:42] in this hour yeah people are getting
[54:44] carried away with the spirit of the hour
[54:47] right
[54:48] man and if you're not careful Saints
[54:51] you'll be right there with
[54:53] that oh yeah you're right don't need
[54:56] Ephesians chapter 5 why is that in the
[55:01] Bible and Mary was was the whole time
[55:05] believing and walking and and believing
[55:07] that the right thing all of a sudden
[55:09] things
[55:10] changed well see what it was she got
[55:13] carried away she got she wanted to show
[55:15] before these priests and things that
[55:17] that she wasn't the type of woman in
[55:19] other words uh that she that she she
[55:21] didn't begot Jesus you know in a in a
[55:24] out of wedlock and she endured doing
[55:26] that she absolutely tore the foundation
[55:28] out from under her testimony after she
[55:31] had testified that an angel had come to
[55:33] her and said Thou shalt conceive and
[55:35] bear a son knowing no man a virgin born
[55:38] son and here before the high Sanhedrin
[55:41] she says Jose of your father here and I
[55:43] have sought you and that 12-year-old boy
[55:46] said I'm about my father's business he
[55:48] rebuked her that isn't my father right
[55:52] that's right keep
[55:54] going see the church today carried away
[55:57] with counsels and things of the world
[56:01] now she's blacked out and God is
[56:03] rebuking
[56:05] her exactly believe that amen
[56:08] now I believe God there I believe in
[56:12] every denomination and in every movement
[56:14] and every God has children of God Amen
[56:18] I'm not saying that people who who
[56:19] believe this way are lost or nothing
[56:21] like that right amen may may be going
[56:24] through a phase
[56:26] amen but it's it's it's it's interesting
[56:29] amen that that they are believing in and
[56:34] and saying these things in the name of
[56:35] the message oh yeah completely
[56:38] distorting what the me what the
[56:39] messenger said right amen amen and call
[56:43] and saying
[56:45] that I guess the call that brother Dale
[56:48] received in his life and that brother
[56:50] Wade received it I guess it's fake
[56:52] [Laughter]
[56:54] then the minister that have that have
[56:57] they preaching this word the pastors
[56:58] that are that are preaching word around
[57:00] the world I guess that's not a real call
[57:03] and then we should only just listen to
[57:05] one man and look up
[57:10] North but you know what Saints I I I I'm
[57:13] I'm I'm totally against that amen
[57:16] because that's not that's not Bible
[57:18] based whatsoever and that's not what
[57:20] brother Brandon preached that's right
[57:22] that's that now there's even splits
[57:25] among them
[57:31] there's even splits among them well
[57:32] should should we play the tape that
[57:34] they're playing up there or should we
[57:36] listen to our own
[57:37] thing you know all these things now yeah
[57:41] must stay with the word of God am stay
[57:43] with the message amen come back to the
[57:46] message come back to the word amen the
[57:49] pure word
[57:50] amen praise God
[57:57] Amen in the message God's word calls for
[57:59] a total separation from
[58:02] unbelief they want to pull that up
[58:04] brother Bram says here as I said last
[58:06] night of Jesus when he was only 12 years
[58:08] old and being a mistake of his mother
[58:11] who is claimed by people to be the
[58:13] mother of God and how that the woman
[58:15] said why thy father I have sought thee
[58:17] with tears and quickly he being the word
[58:20] said knowest thou not that I must be
[58:23] about my father's business see she was
[58:26] was declaring him to be Joseph's son but
[58:28] he wasn't Joseph's son if he'd been
[58:31] Joseph's son he'd been with him that's
[58:33] right but he was his but but he was with
[58:36] the father about his business so the
[58:38] word is always corrective and always
[58:43] right amen it says the word he said the
[58:46] word is always corrective and always
[58:48] right amen I don't care who it is that's
[58:51] right it's always the word is always
[58:53] right amen amen
[58:56] and the word will correct every wrong
[58:59] always am yes sir amen I believe that's
[59:02] that's wrong
[59:04] amen I don't I don't believe that to be
[59:08] correct it's a
[59:10] spirit it's a spirit that that again
[59:13] it's taking the people away from the
[59:15] from the EST from the foundational
[59:18] things of the word of God and Paul was
[59:21] completely for ministers amen preaching
[59:24] yeah but
[59:27] that gospel is taking that away from the
[59:30] people oh yeah it's it's taking it away
[59:33] from the people I agree that there's bad
[59:37] apples in the batch yeah I totally do
[59:41] but there's good apples too amen that we
[59:44] need to listen to amen that we should
[59:46] listen to
[59:52] amen now we know in Revelations chapter
[59:54] 10 I want you to look at this we're
[59:56] almost finished Revelations chap
[59:59] 10 verse verse
[1:00:02] 7 we start at verse
[1:00:06] 7 no actually verse eight start at verse
[1:00:10] eight but we'll read verse 7 here in
[1:00:12] just a
[1:00:15] moment I want you to notice something
[1:00:17] here and the voice which I heard from
[1:00:20] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[1:00:23] and take the little book which is open
[1:00:24] in the hand of the angel
[1:00:26] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:00:29] earth I want you to pay attention to
[1:00:30] that because that angel is the angel
[1:00:33] that was in verse one that's right corre
[1:00:35] in verse one if you read the ver verse
[1:00:37] one it says the I saw another Mighty
[1:00:39] Angel come down amen with a open book
[1:00:42] amen and we know that that was Christ
[1:00:44] the message declares that that was
[1:00:46] Christ brother brandham said that that
[1:00:47] was
[1:00:48] Christ amen that wasn't that wasn't
[1:00:51] brother Brandon no that was Christ now
[1:00:54] we know that that that that later on in
[1:00:57] verse 7 as we read as we read as we read
[1:00:59] there we we're very familiar with this
[1:01:01] scripture in verse 7 we know what it
[1:01:03] says but in the days of the voice of the
[1:01:05] seventh angel
[1:01:07] right but now let's read here in verse 9
[1:01:09] Revelation 109 and I went unto the angel
[1:01:12] and said unto him give me the little
[1:01:14] book and he said unto me he said unto me
[1:01:20] take it and eat it
[1:01:22] up you take it and eat it up he said
[1:01:25] said unto me who is that he it wasn't it
[1:01:28] wasn't Revelation 10:7 that wasn't that
[1:01:30] he no it was that Mighty Angel right
[1:01:33] still speaking to John and we know that
[1:01:36] John brother Brown said John represents
[1:01:38] the bride amen amen speaking to
[1:01:42] John in verse
[1:01:44] n go back back down to verse
[1:01:47] 8 and the voice which I heard from
[1:01:50] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[1:01:51] take the little book which is open in
[1:01:53] the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:01:55] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[1:01:57] went unto the angel and said unto him
[1:01:59] give me the little book it's almost like
[1:02:02] you know he told him to take the book
[1:02:04] but then a angel uh John interpreted as
[1:02:07] oh I got to go ask for the book it's
[1:02:09] almost kind of like what we do yeah he
[1:02:11] tells us to take the book do what you
[1:02:14] need to do with the word take the word
[1:02:15] take all the word in but we we just kind
[1:02:18] of beg for the word yeah that's what
[1:02:21] John did gave me the little book and he
[1:02:24] said unto me that same voice take it and
[1:02:28] eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[1:02:31] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[1:02:33] sweet as honey and I took the little
[1:02:35] book out of the Angel's hand that's
[1:02:37] correct who who what Angel is that the
[1:02:40] mighty Angel and ate it up amen was the
[1:02:44] book that was open in his hand wasn't
[1:02:46] open in the in the Angel's hand of
[1:02:48] Revelation 10:7 cuz he couldn't have
[1:02:51] opened it it had to be that the uh that

[1:04:39] was in the father's business in the day
[1:04:41] of Jesus when he was 12 years old there
[1:04:43] at the temple telling Mary and Joseph to
[1:04:45] do what they were doing I must be about
[1:04:47] my father's business then you and I must
[1:04:49] be about the father's business in this
[1:04:51] hour must be about the father's business
[1:04:54] right amen

[1:05:08] at what that word prophesy
[1:05:11] means brother brother Joe if you could
[1:05:14] if you could bring that meaning
[1:05:20] up it's the word in in Greek it's day
[1:05:27] it says it is necessary there is need of
[1:05:30] it behooves is right and proper right
[1:05:33] necessity lying in the nature of the
[1:05:37] case necessity in reference to what is
[1:05:41] required to attain in some
[1:05:45] end it's a necessity you must a
[1:05:48] necessity of Law and command of Duty
[1:05:51] Equity necessity established by the
[1:05:54] councel and decree of God especially by
[1:05:57] that purpose of his which relates to the
[1:06:00] Salvation of Man by the intervention of
[1:06:03] Christ and which is disclosed in the Old
[1:06:05] Testament prophecies now we know that in
[1:06:08] the Old Testament there's prophecies in
[1:06:09] Daniel if you read in Daniel about the
[1:06:12] saints that taken that taken the you can
[1:06:15] read that I believe it's in Daniel 11 so

[1:11:22] of what brother Brandon preached we are

[1:11:29] Revelation 101 is right
[1:11:32] here amongst his bride we are the
[1:11:35] Vindication of that word amen that's

[1:12:02] Jesus said I must be about my father's
[1:12:05] business you must be about the father's
[1:12:07] business think they would receive it
[1:12:09] they want to be dignified and say our
[1:12:11] denomination don't teach us
[1:12:13] that but the Bible does amen that's
[1:12:16] right God vindicates it to be true sure

[1:12:26] that's another one of the father's
[1:12:27] business to prove and the father's
[1:12:30] business now is to show you that them

[1:12:38] amen again you have in order to accept
[1:12:41] something like that you have to deny the
[1:12:43] word that's right right
[1:12:45] Amen to accept something like that you
[1:12:47] have to deny the word you have to go
[1:12:49] over the word and and and take out
[1:12:51] certain scriptures of the Bible Amen to
[1:12:54] to say
[1:12:56] that we don't need preachers anymore
[1:12:57] that's right
[1:13:01] amen that that's
[1:13:04] that you know and in one place brother
[1:13:06] Brandon says no mechanical devices is

[1:13:24] just wanted to just put that out there
[1:13:26] Saints to for you just to be careful in
[1:13:28] this hour amen yeah because wherever I
[1:13:32] wherever I go I've been to several
[1:13:34] countries and you hear the exact same
[1:13:36] thing well brother such and such they
[1:13:38] were they were a powerful Ministry they
[1:13:40] had ministers and everything like that
[1:13:42] and now they just sit around and play
[1:13:43] tapes
[1:13:45] yeah and you don't you don't hear from
[1:13:48] them like you're you're not invited by
[1:13:50] them to to go minister to
[1:13:53] them no
[1:13:56] right but at one point they they they
[1:13:58] were for the ministering of the word and
[1:14:01] then all of a sudden that changed I
[1:14:02] don't you know again you have to leave
[1:14:05] the word of God in order for you to go
[1:14:06] that way amen I'm sorry amen but so
[1:14:11] Saints we we must be about our father's
[1:14:13] business in this hour that is the
[1:14:14] father's business in this hour it's for
[1:14:17] us the bride of Christ to fulfill the
[1:14:19] word of God in this hour amen again
[1:14:21] brother brandom did his part y you and I
[1:14:24] are here that we must do our part Saints
[1:14:26] there's a part that you and I must
[1:14:28] fulfill amen right amen find the part
[1:14:31] that you need to fulfill amen that's
[1:14:32] right stay in the word amen stay in the
[1:14:35] message because the message and the word
[1:14:37] are the same thing
[1:14:39] amen no nothing different nothing
[1:14:42] separate it's the exact same thing amen
[1:14:44] every time I put on a tape and listen to
[1:14:46] brother brandom I always get I always
[1:14:49] get uh it draws me closer to Jesus
[1:14:52] Christ and it should not draw you you to
[1:14:55] some other man should not even draw you
[1:14:58] to brother brandom himself right it
[1:15:02] should draw you to Jesus Christ and I
[1:15:04] wholly believe that that's what brother
[1:15:05] brandom's intentions were brother
[1:15:08] brandom's know look the first time I
[1:15:11] even heard the message it was it was in
[1:15:14] Colombia South America I opened the book
[1:15:17] the the the the message uh uh Jesus
[1:15:20] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:15:22] and I was reading it in Spanish and this
[1:15:25] is it wasn't in English I KN I knew how
[1:15:27] to speak English but I mean I was
[1:15:28] reading in Spanish and just reading that
[1:15:32] that
[1:15:33] message I was I was saying something's
[1:15:36] different about this man speaking here
[1:15:39] and every single thing that I was going
[1:15:40] to was drawing me that I was reading it
[1:15:42] was drawing me as was closer to Jesus
[1:15:45] Christ not at one point I was still in
[1:15:48] the Baptist Church at the time not at
[1:15:50] one point was I thinking I need to go
[1:15:52] worship this man yeah or I need to go I
[1:15:55] need I need to uh you know no the whole
[1:15:59] time I was being led to Jesus Christ so
[1:16:03] I what is the spirit in this hour that
[1:16:05] oh that puts brother brandham up here in
[1:16:08] this way and the five-fold ministry down
[1:16:11] here what is that Spirit but then
[1:16:14] there's the other Spirit I've mentioned
[1:16:16] before that that that puts the fful
[1:16:18] ministry up here and brother brandom
[1:16:20] down here and I think that's wrong too
[1:16:22] right there has to be a balance Saints
[1:16:25] God is a god of
[1:16:27] balance God is a god of balance so it's
[1:16:30] not one over the other amen it's the
