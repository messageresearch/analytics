[16:24] says and our Brethren could not speak
[16:26] unto you as in the spiritual but as in
[16:29] the carnal even as in under babes in
[16:32] Christ I have fed you with milk and not
[16:35] with meat for hitherto you are not able
[16:38] to Bear it neither yet now are you able
[16:41] for you are yet carnal
[16:44] the way out whereas there is among you
[16:46] envying and strife and divisions are you
[16:49] not carnal and walk as men for while one
[16:51] saith I am of Paul and another I am of
[16:54] Apollos are you not carnal
[16:57] who then is Paul and who is Apollos but
[16:59] ministers by whom he believed even as
[17:02] the lord gave to every man amen I have
[17:05] planted Apollos water but God gave me
[17:08] increase so then neither is he that
[17:10] planteth anything neither he that
[17:12] watereth but God that giveth the
[17:14] increase
[17:15] now he that watereth and he that he that
[17:18] planteth and he that Waters our one and
[17:20] every man shall receive his own reward
[17:22] according to his own labor for you for
[17:25] we are laborers together with God ye are
[17:28] God's husbandry he or God's Building
[17:30] according to the grace of God
[17:33] which is given unto me as a wise master
[17:36] builder I have laid the foundation and
[17:39] another bill of there upon thereon but
[17:43] let every man take heed how he buildeth
[17:46] they're upon right amen made heavy seats
[17:50] Lord I blessing to the reading of the
[17:51] word
[17:53] and uh
[17:58] just trying to
[18:00] figure out exactly how to
[18:02] just how the Lord would leave it uh
[18:07] I just want to speak on
[18:09] uh they're from verse 9 says laborers
[18:13] together with God Amen
[18:16] and uh just been doing some
[18:19] been reading and
[18:21] uh
[18:23] if you if you you know you read the
[18:25] brother Brown said that uh you know
[18:27] Corinthians was the book of Corrections
[18:29] right if you've done any reading in the
[18:31] in the book of Corinthians uh you know
[18:34] they were an interesting bunch of people
[18:37] I don't know
[18:39] I was I was thinking I was reading some
[18:41] things and reading some commentaries and
[18:43] different things and you know Paul must
[18:45] not have never had
[18:46] a with the grant
[18:48] we always had they always have some kind
[18:50] of issue going on and there's all you
[18:52] know because
[18:54] uh there was all they was all messed up
[18:57] with with something all the time and he
[18:58] was all the time trying to straighten
[19:00] them out and you know and you know the
[19:02] Ephesians was was the group that was
[19:04] able that he was able to bring a lot of
[19:06] a lot of things out of the scripture and
[19:08] teach them and uh show them a lot of
[19:11] great things but the Corinthians he was
[19:13] all the time trying to make straighten
[19:15] him out because they were all confused
[19:16] and uh in many different times even in
[19:20] this chapter three you'll find out you
[19:22] go back to the first two chapters of the
[19:24] book he goes back to this same thing and
[19:26] he's uh
[19:27] he's rebuking the Corinthians in the
[19:30] first two chapters for the same thing
[19:31] because he's speaking of them having uh
[19:34] divisions among them and uh
[19:37] but you know you look at these things
[19:39] and you say boy that was a that was a
[19:41] tough crowd that uh the Apostle Paul had
[19:44] to deal with
[19:45] but you know what struck me was God
[19:48] allowed that to happen that you and I
[19:50] would have this work right right because
[19:52] you know what we were in the same place
[19:53] because we were confused too and you
[19:56] know because it came to us right because
[19:58] we were in confusion too because if it
[20:01] hadn't been written in the scripture and
[20:03] we you look at this group though well
[20:04] they're all confused well we were all
[20:05] confused also and you know because you
[20:08] look at it today and there's still a lot
[20:09] of people confused we're still we're
[20:11] still trying to get over all all the
[20:13] confusion because that's the way the
[20:15] devil works is he works through your
[20:16] confusion because he wants you to be
[20:18] confused right and but we we see here
[20:21] that hey speaking of of
[20:24] being carnal
[20:26] and speaking of them being babes
[20:30] and just a few things
[20:33] you know uh the Apostle Paul covers
[20:36] different things in this chapter one he
[20:38] talks about them being uh babes and
[20:42] having needing right uh not having been
[20:45] able to take the Strong Leaf but still
[20:48] being on milk yeah and they said are you
[20:50] are you carnal you know are you still
[20:52] carnal after all these things and you
[20:54] see there's a few things he talks about
[20:55] and the other one he talks about was
[20:58] that the bride and the body is supposed
[21:00] to be working together in harmony and he
[21:02] you know he sees that you see all these
[21:04] divisions and
[21:06] and then he goes back on and later on
[21:08] you see where he gets into it and he
[21:09] starts talking about a foundation
[21:11] because he said he has a wise master
[21:12] builder he had laid a foundation and
[21:15] then when he gets on later into the temp
[21:16] the chapter after he speaks on laying a
[21:19] foundation he goes and starts speaking
[21:21] on he says ye are the temple of God so
[21:24] he goes on because he after and we'll
[21:26] try to get into some of these things but
[21:28] I want to speak on
[21:31] just see how the Lord leads it but
[21:33] certain things in this chapter that
[21:34] really stand on me and the first one is
[21:36] when he's speaking he said because he
[21:38] said you're you're still on the meal
[21:39] right because he you know he comes back
[21:42] even in first in chapter one and you
[21:44] know he comes out and
[21:46] because he's speaking in chapter one
[21:52] listen he says in chapter one he says I
[21:55] thank my God always on your behalf for
[21:57] the grace of God which is given to you
[21:58] by Jesus Christ said everything ye are
[22:01] enriched by him this is chapter one
[22:03] verse four that in everything you are
[22:05] enriched by Him in all utterance and all
[22:06] and and all knowledge even as the
[22:09] testimony of Christ was confirmed in you
[22:11] so that ye come behind
[22:13] or lack
[22:15] right and no gift waiting for the coming
[22:17] of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also
[22:20] confirm you unto the end that you may be
[22:22] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus
[22:24] Christ so he's speaking of what what
[22:26] they have in front of them because he
[22:29] said that he's giving you these gifts
[22:31] that that you may not like
[22:33] but he's but he said he said but you're
[22:35] still carnal he said you've been given
[22:37] this great gift but you're still carnal
[22:39] and it's even when he comes into chapter
[22:40] two he's even still speaking of them
[22:42] talking about them being in a carnal in
[22:44] a carnal condition and you know he talks
[22:47] about in one part where he said he was
[22:48] glad that he didn't baptize by just a
[22:50] few of them because you know he said if
[22:52] you because people would think that he
[22:54] baptized in his own name right and he
[22:56] said he was glad that he didn't have any
[22:57] baptism with any of them because he
[22:59] didn't want to have anything because
[23:00] they were so confused and so he's
[23:03] speaking here and uh you know he's he's
[23:05] speaking of that that a spiritual man
[23:07] because they were supposed to be
[23:09] spiritual people but those that were
[23:10] supposed to be coming off the milk
[23:12] because even in Hebrews 5 Paul writing
[23:15] is speaking of he said those that are
[23:16] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[23:18] because they're still on the mill
[23:19] because they've not come to the place
[23:21] where they can discern right I said you
[23:23] know that was the thing that was that
[23:25] was Eve's Eve's problem because Satan
[23:28] told Dave in the beginning he said
[23:30] you'll know good and evil Robin was she
[23:32] couldn't discern between good and evil
[23:34] and so that's what it is it takes the
[23:36] word because the scripture says it you
[23:38] know there's a way that is right that a
[23:41] man think it's right but that way is
[23:43] death so a lot of people can think but
[23:45] it takes discernment to know what's
[23:46] right and what's wrong because if
[23:48] without discernment you never get
[23:50] anywhere right because if without
[23:52] discernment and you can't figure things
[23:53] out for yourself because that's what has
[23:55] happened around the message with a lot
[23:57] of people is they've tried to figure
[23:59] things out for themselves and you see
[24:01] that because it comes to not just as
[24:03] gamelia told them told them about
[24:06] calling the Christians you know he said
[24:07] leave it alone
[24:09] he said leave it on because he said if
[24:11] it's of God it'll come to pass because
[24:13] God will use it he said if not it'll
[24:15] come to naught right and we see that
[24:17] what has happened to a lot of people is
[24:19] it's come to know right because people
[24:21] and people have put their faith in in
[24:23] something for so long they wandered in
[24:25] this thing for so long and it's become
[24:27] the dogs they've come to nothing they've
[24:29] done what would it cost because now is
[24:31] the time of matter
[24:32] you know because you walk around for so
[24:34] long but now is the time it has to be
[24:36] manifested right because you know I have
[24:39] and you know I just use myself because
[24:41] that's only measuring stick I have right
[24:43] it's me right because I look you know
[24:47] why why is that what that I that I've
[24:49] walked in the the same way for so many
[24:51] years but you know what I see though I
[24:53] I'm overcoming because you know that's
[24:56] why because it doesn't want the devil
[24:58] tells you it's it's not what comes
[25:00] before you it's not their sense I am an
[25:02] overcomer I know that I'm going to
[25:04] overcome these things why because I know
[25:06] why did God bring me to this place amen
[25:09] right right
[25:11] because he has a perfect word because he
[25:14] began a good work and he's going to
[25:16] finish it right right now
[25:19] the problem is is Aaron Roberts gets in
[25:22] the way oh yeah that's right
[25:24] and I got a lot to get in the way amen
[25:28] well I'm going to arrested
[25:33] just like brother DLC take more Rapture
[25:36] and thank me for me then arrested
[25:41] but that's but see God has began a good
[25:44] work but the thing is is we've still got
[25:46] to hold on and we've got to yield
[25:48] ourselves because we we're the ones that
[25:51] are trying to work things out
[25:53] and if we and we see it comes to not
[25:59] right but if we come to this place that
[26:01] we can see Who We Are
[26:03] that's it
[26:04] that's right amen so we're coming we've
[26:07] got to get off the milk come on brother
[26:09] man
[26:11] and good milk is good milk's wonderful
[26:14] I haven't had supper tonight I had a
[26:15] glass of milk
[26:16] and it was good sure
[26:18] and I'm ready to go get something to eat
[26:20] when this is I'm ready to go get
[26:22] something to eat yeah that's right
[26:24] because I can't live on just milk
[26:26] come on I like cereal or a little milk
[26:29] bless you yeah
[26:34] he said they're strong meat
[26:38] all right there's there is greater
[26:41] understanding amen's right but he said
[26:43] he said you're not able to Bear it he
[26:45] said you've not been able to Bear it
[26:46] right right he said it's been before you
[26:48] and then see he's speaking to him I'm
[26:51] trying to get to you to a place that you
[26:53] can see there's more in front of you
[26:54] because you've got to grow amen you've
[26:56] got to grow it's time to grow right and
[26:59] if we can't stay in we can't stay in the
[27:02] same place forever that's right because
[27:04] we've got to come because if we don't
[27:06] come to the place
[27:08] and I understand that everybody's not
[27:10] going to come to the come to the place
[27:11] of a body change but you know what
[27:13] there's some people that are right right
[27:15] that's right and some people are not
[27:18] going and because some people are not
[27:20] going to come to that place because
[27:21] they're going to stand in their own way
[27:22] right all mine that's right that's right
[27:24] brother amen because there's going to be
[27:26] because it's not it's not that that is a
[27:30] lack
[27:31] from God it's a lack from them right
[27:33] yeah exactly right because you know
[27:36] brother Brandon was saying you know
[27:37] that's that's what caused it
[27:39] I have to you know I have this quote
[27:41] here you know brother around talking
[27:42] about uh
[27:44] our misbehavior in Ephesians parallels
[27:46] Joshua
[27:48] you know it's an amazing
[27:50] you think about it
[27:53] he said he said your misbehavior of
[27:55] unconfessed Sins Of You Believers he
[27:58] said can cause this church to bitterly
[28:00] fail amen
[28:02] all right bro
[28:04] can you imagine that that's one person
[28:07] right
[28:08] right
[28:10] can you can you you think about aching
[28:12] right
[28:15] because of his own greed right
[28:18] because of his own selfish desire
[28:22] he had blood on his hands right right
[28:23] yeah
[28:25] amen because of his own selfish desire
[28:29] and he thought well this won't mess it's
[28:31] just a little bit
[28:35] I wonder what it what it stood what it
[28:37] was like for his family to stand out
[28:39] there for every one of them to be killed
[28:41] right yeah
[28:42] it wasn't just it just wasn't aching
[28:45] that died it was his whole family they
[28:46] destroyed everything that's right amen
[28:48] that's right
[28:50] you think you think about that he said
[28:52] he said it's our misbehavior of
[28:54] unconfessed sins right amen
[28:59] that a church can barely fail
[29:03] yeah Brett Brown said brother Ram said
[29:04] that one person that we can stand in
[29:07] each other's way right amen
[29:09] that we can be the one to stand in
[29:11] somebody's way of getting of them being
[29:12] healed yeah
[29:15] all right
[29:21] I I think about uh
[29:23] I was reading uh I believe the message
[29:25] is led by the spirit and your brother
[29:27] Brandon was speaking of the woman that
[29:29] uh
[29:31] had committed adultery while her husband
[29:33] was gone and you know she almost got hit
[29:35] by the train and and she was you know
[29:38] she was in such a nervous wreck she was
[29:40] you know all tore up and you know
[29:41] brother random but somebody all the
[29:43] times that you know she'd been in all
[29:44] these different meetings and they poured
[29:45] all over oh yeah and they prayed and
[29:48] prayed and prayed
[29:50] but you know brother Brown said that
[29:53] Satan has a legal right
[29:55] if to stay right there right as long as
[29:58] they're unconfessed sin right
[30:01] he said you can pour all on them by the
[30:03] gallons and pray all you want he said
[30:06] Satan still has a legal right to say
[30:08] right there amen and your brother Brown
[30:09] said he said you know he said I was not
[30:11] going to pray for that thing to come off
[30:13] because he might have got in trouble
[30:15] yeah he said I said I'm not gonna pray
[30:16] he said because I want to find out he
[30:18] said because she didn't know all these
[30:20] other ministers right and she'd been to
[30:21] all these churches and everything that
[30:23] had had been prayed over and she never
[30:25] got any better she just kept getting
[30:26] worse and worse and worse until she came
[30:29] before brother and then he saw in
[30:31] deserve it what her problem was right
[30:33] see that was the thing because the word
[30:35] is a discernment right all right and so
[30:38] that's the thing is you you stay right
[30:40] along that you'll find out
[30:43] because he's going to discern what your
[30:45] problem is that's right and you know the
[30:47] thing is is you can stay right there
[30:51] and you can turn it down
[30:53] or you can accept it right exactly
[30:55] because you have to because it'll come
[30:58] out and you'll find out but you'll
[30:59] you'll burn your conscience
[31:04] you see your conscience from that yep
[31:07] amen and people have done that amen but
[31:11] you know you come to that face and you
[31:13] know just because he'll just you know
[31:14] he'll show you the things that are wrong
[31:16] in your life what what you need to take
[31:18] care of right the thing is but you hold
[31:20] on to that
[31:22] because you know I've seen things in my
[31:23] life and say why can't I get rid of that
[31:25] you keep going through that battle but
[31:27] there's a time appointed unto you for
[31:29] you to get victory over there
[31:32] because if he's going to bring that out
[31:34] he's going to show you what you need to
[31:37] overcome and guess what there's a time
[31:38] of Victory time you have to come to that
[31:41] place because he's obligated to amen
[31:43] right
[31:44] because I can't do it in myself
[31:47] but if I give it to him he's obligated
[31:49] to override for me to overcome that yeah
[31:52] yeah amen
[31:58] so we have to come to this place
[32:01] that we can overcome right
[32:11] so going on here Paul speaking
[32:15] as he's
[32:16] speaking of them being carnal in them
[32:19] uh having these divisions
[32:22] walking being carnal and he says
[32:25] who is uh
[32:27] Paul who is Apollos right because he
[32:30] says one one says I'm apologize and he
[32:33] says who are they who is Paul right who
[32:36] is Apollos
[32:38] what's it was you saved by Paul was you
[32:41] saved by Apollos
[32:42] all right he said no
[32:45] he said because what he said I planted
[32:47] Apollos water but he said God was the
[32:49] one that gave the increase right he said
[32:51] because see we're all working having to
[32:53] work together amen because LeBron is is
[32:56] having is to work together because you
[32:58] know as Paul was speaking he says if uh
[33:02] you know the whole body can't be hearing
[33:04] or the whole body can't be smelly right
[33:07] because each one of them has has their
[33:09] own heart
[33:10] hey but he says but who is this one and
[33:13] because he said we are laborers together
[33:15] right right we are to labor together so
[33:18] if if God has a plan and a purpose to
[33:20] take place then each one of us have to
[33:23] work together
[33:25] because just asked one can hinder
[33:29] just as you can stand in somebody's way
[33:31] you're the very one that may be the one
[33:34] to have someone through right
[33:39] right as I believe it was uh you know
[33:42] the lady the Brethren was telling the
[33:43] story about the the lady that uh had the
[33:46] had the I think she rented a barn or
[33:48] something and had a meeting and there
[33:49] was only one person the preacher came in
[33:51] and preached and only one person got
[33:53] saved
[33:54] and it was D.L Moody right and you know
[33:57] everybody say about well you know that
[33:58] was that was a a pitiful meeting that
[34:01] they had she spent all this money for a
[34:03] meeting right
[34:05] but you know what now from that one man
[34:08] right right
[34:10] you you look at what took place all
[34:12] around the world what an evangelist
[34:15] DL Moody was in though in the work that
[34:17] he done and some people say well that
[34:19] was just you know you look at that and
[34:20] they said well I didn't pay much
[34:21] dividends but you know what you can't
[34:23] you can't measure the dividends that
[34:26] came from that meeting internally right
[34:28] well because of what he was able to do
[34:30] and so sometimes we look at things and
[34:32] we say well I don't it don't it don't
[34:33] matter much it matters more than you
[34:35] than you can imagine
[34:38] see if we could see it as brother Adam
[34:41] was speaking of in the church he said
[34:43] you know you see the angels are in in
[34:45] the building they're sitting on the pews
[34:47] and everything you know what it's
[34:48] sometimes we just Overlook those things
[34:50] or sometimes we don't ever consciously
[34:52] comprehend those things right when we
[34:54] come to church that that we're sitting
[34:56] in the midst of of an eternal God
[34:59] you know as as brother Dan was preaching
[35:03] on the Shekinah you know he said you
[35:06] know when the word came in and
[35:07] everything came into its place then the
[35:09] Shekinah Glory he came down into the
[35:11] into the temple you know we don't
[35:13] realize but the Shekinah Glory you know
[35:15] what we we don't comprehend but that
[35:18] same Shekinah that came down in that
[35:21] Temple is in you and I because he came
[35:24] into each one of us right
[35:26] so guess what when when he came down and
[35:30] you know he was saying he couldn't
[35:31] Minister because he was in the midst and
[35:33] it was so great do you know you carry
[35:35] that same one with you and you came in
[35:38] tonight each one of us having our own
[35:39] link of Fire have come down and the
[35:41] Shekinah Glory is here right all right
[35:43] amen but we just look and say well
[35:45] that's just this you know it's just
[35:46] brother Aaron and brother waiting
[35:48] Brother Anderson we're just you know
[35:49] it's just us you know same ones we sell
[35:52] them and we missed yeah all right who's
[35:54] here right
[35:56] that's right six sometimes when we see
[35:58] sometimes but we don't see what it what
[36:00] is taking place we said when I stress
[36:03] brother down he's just gonna get up and
[36:04] you know we're just gonna sing the same
[36:05] two songs and he's gonna get up he's
[36:06] gonna pass out quotes and we're just
[36:08] going to read the underlying stuff yeah
[36:09] yeah page will make a few comments and
[36:12] then we'll go home
[36:15] and sometimes we fail to see what's what
[36:17] when he were under lines things in the
[36:20] quotes you know sometimes you have to go
[36:22] back and read the whole thing because if
[36:23] you raped the whole cup the whole quote
[36:25] the things that he has underlined just
[36:27] steps off the page yeah because you
[36:29] actually miss what's really the real
[36:31] emphasis of things what is being said if
[36:34] you're not reading the whole quote right
[36:36] amen but I mean he's just trying because
[36:38] you know he don't have time to read
[36:39] everything I mean so I mean he you know
[36:41] we all I think everybody has been to
[36:43] school long enough to read so I mean we
[36:45] can do that on our own all right but I
[36:47] mean if you've seen the things it is
[36:48] that brother Dale's giving us
[36:53] he's ordained of God to lead us through
[36:55] and he's I mean right
[36:58] he can't do much more than he does all
[37:00] right come on Amen right the only other
[37:02] way would be supernaturally just open
[37:04] her heads and pour it in sometimes
[37:07] wait wish
[37:10] let's see
[37:12] as brother Dale's been original so
[37:14] you've got to come to that understanding
[37:16] right that's right because you have to
[37:18] have your understanding open because you
[37:21] know you you look at brother brother
[37:22] Branham you know and
[37:24] I was reading some of the um
[37:28] I can't remember what message I was
[37:29] reading but anyway you know Sister me
[37:31] well you know he got up and the angel
[37:33] Lord was in the room and you know he's
[37:35] he's uh dealing with different things
[37:37] that he's gonna have to go do and you
[37:40] know Sister Matey's trying to talk to
[37:41] him and you know he's in this other
[37:43] realm and she's trying to talk to him
[37:44] about you know do you need you want some
[37:45] breakfast or whatever an angel Lords and
[37:47] she said what I knew he was in the room
[37:48] because she could you know I could feel
[37:50] his presence and you know he's in this
[37:52] other realm and he's thinking about all
[37:53] these things and the Lord's showing him
[37:55] things and she's trying to talk about
[37:56] feeding the kids and doing laundry and
[37:58] all these other things and here's here's
[38:00] the angel Lord trying to talk to brother
[38:01] Brown because he's going out to do
[38:03] things and sometimes we miss those
[38:05] things because right you know we said
[38:07] well that was just the prophet
[38:09] come on bro
[38:11] no he's come to do the same thing for
[38:13] you
[38:16] miss that brother Brown said that he
[38:20] said a child of God can come to such a
[38:22] place come on brother you can live in
[38:24] such a realm that the devil don't even
[38:26] know what to do with it
[38:30] but we think what else for brother Brown
[38:31] that's for Brother David yeah
[38:35] no that's for the very weakest Christian
[38:38] and that's right
[38:40] amen
[38:42] because that is the children's bread
[38:45] that is that is a that is a right that
[38:47] is a because you're an heir so that
[38:49] belongs to every heir of God Amen that's
[38:52] right that you can come to that place
[38:56] they did
[38:57] you know you see how things go yeah
[39:00] you're not going to live in a bed of
[39:01] roses
[39:03] it's not going to be great all the time
[39:05] but you know what there's an overcoming
[39:07] because you can walk it around
[39:10] see Jesus you read Jesus walking around
[39:14] with perfect Faith right right
[39:17] it was it didn't say you lived in a
[39:19] realm of perfect life
[39:21] that's right there's no such thing as a
[39:23] perfect life in this world exactly
[39:26] because brother Randall was speaking of
[39:28] uh and questions and answers
[39:32] you know he says as long as you're in
[39:34] this life you're going to be sticky and
[39:36] have a carnal nature that's going to
[39:38] bother you as long as you live but the
[39:41] inside of you you're born again and when
[39:43] you're raised up you're in the likeness
[39:45] of Christ and all the sin is gone from
[39:47] you man
[39:49] that's right because you've been raised
[39:51] up to sit in Heavenly places in Christ
[39:53] Jesus so when you come to that place you
[39:55] know what you're still going to battle
[39:56] this old flesh why because you're still
[39:58] in this realm and he's and Satan's still
[40:01] got a Punch coming at you but you know
[40:04] what you've got to come to the place
[40:05] that you're that you've come to the
[40:06] place where you're recognizing that
[40:08] you're leaving and walking in Heavenly
[40:10] places and not living in the realm of
[40:13] the world right
[40:16] because you know sometimes you get out
[40:18] on a on a job and
[40:22] everybody says well
[40:24] you know they call you and they tell you
[40:25] my air conditioner is doing this my air
[40:27] conditioner is doing that it'll do this
[40:28] it won't do that and you know how you
[40:30] know how it is you come out there and
[40:31] work on it man runs perfect
[40:35] homes perfect okay fine nothing wrong
[40:40] well I know it's messed up
[40:44] so you go out there and start praying
[40:47] Lord what's wrong with this thing yeah
[40:50] sure
[40:54] and I and it's just sometimes it's just
[40:56] like
[40:58] being magnetized
[41:02] and you can be drawn right in yeah and
[41:04] find things that you don't see yeah sure
[41:09] it's just like but they ain't talking
[41:10] about working on cars
[41:15] we say
[41:16] what is that
[41:19] ask the Lord being mindful outside
[41:26] so we think we think that
[41:29] well that's just simple things I think
[41:31] golf is a simple thing amen that's what
[41:34] I look for when I can see when I can go
[41:36] out there and pray and say Lord you know
[41:38] help me with this and help me with that
[41:41] and I know
[41:43] it was him right it takes care of these
[41:45] things because I because you can't find
[41:48] things but he can pull them out to you
[41:49] all right he can show you what's wrong
[41:51] amen he can give you the minutes right
[41:54] that's right
[41:57] so yes that's so simple
[41:59] but see that's where that's where we
[42:00] miss it because we think well
[42:04] we're not it's not it's not something
[42:05] great it's not something big
[42:10] yeah so that's the reason that we don't
[42:12] see the big things because we miss God
[42:14] in the little girl right that's right
[42:16] amen because if you come to a place
[42:17] where you can see God in the little
[42:19] things
[42:19] come on you start walking he'll start
[42:22] showing things right then he can draw
[42:24] you into big things that's right he can
[42:26] show you greater things but if you're
[42:28] not faithful in the little things he
[42:29] said the foxes the little foxes for the
[42:31] vines hey said so if you're not seeing
[42:34] him moving the little things see he said
[42:35] everybody Praises God for the future
[42:38] what he's going to do then what he's
[42:40] done in the past but they miss him right
[42:42] now right how is he working in the midst
[42:44] he's working in the little things right
[42:46] the things that you that you missed that
[42:48] we Overlook see that's where God's at
[42:50] right
[42:58] all right that's the reason I pray God
[43:00] help me out
[43:01] when I come to church don't let me just
[43:04] come to church don't let me just listen
[43:06] yeah until they'll be listening come on
[43:10] but Lord show me what I need what is it
[43:13] what is it that you want me to hear and
[43:15] you know it doesn't matter who is
[43:18] preaching or who you know because it's
[43:20] it's one of what the Lord wants to show
[43:22] you right right amen amen
[43:27] I can't remember who it was
[43:30] uh they were talking about uh
[43:34] my member of Keith Brown when he was
[43:36] here talking about those two top two top
[43:38] singers that make him want to sing good
[43:41] ones and bad ones
[43:46] you know
[43:47] you look at some people you know some of
[43:50] some of the things that God has showed
[43:51] me
[43:52] in the word has been some of the
[43:54] greatest messages and some of the worst
[43:56] messages yeah right
[43:58] oh yeah because you know what it takes
[44:00] somebody to preaches something that's
[44:02] wrong okay come on Amen
[44:04] sure because when something when
[44:06] something is preached that's wrong come
[44:08] on when you hear something that's off
[44:09] and then you sit there and
[44:11] you know I've had things it's like
[44:23] trying to figure out and there's been
[44:26] times like
[44:27] you know Lord I don't you know because
[44:29] it takes a while but something called
[44:31] you you know you catch them and
[44:32] sometimes it takes a while before that
[44:34] becomes clear too right and sometimes
[44:36] things just pop off the page yet you'll
[44:39] catch things and somebody's preaching
[44:40] things and you'll see things open right
[44:42] up and you'll say well that's that's
[44:44] just the saith Lord you can see that
[44:46] just true it just clears as a bail it's
[44:48] just perfect
[44:49] but see it takes those things because
[44:52] when it comes down you'll catch those
[44:53] things because he's trying to show you
[44:55] things because some people they just
[44:57] they don't they don't catch you
[45:01] know some people
[45:03] as we said some people don't have any
[45:05] deserve it they just want anything right
[45:06] yeah man that's right
[45:08] yeah sure they're not catching what God
[45:10] has to say that's right because there's
[45:13] oil run around you know God said a
[45:15] problem brother Brandon
[45:19] speaking of speaking of a prophet
[45:25] you know if he takes you to another God
[45:27] right come on brother
[45:30] doesn't matter what he does you gotta
[45:32] watch what he says see if it lines up
[45:35] right you know there's one thing about
[45:36] the Apostle Paul you know the Apostle
[45:39] Paul when he came and started preaching
[45:40] you know he went back to the back to the
[45:42] Old Testament and started bringing up
[45:44] whatever what the Old Testament had to
[45:46] say to show you Christ amen father calls
[45:50] he said Christ laid all the way through
[45:51] the Old Testament come on
[45:53] everything that everything that was in
[45:55] the Old Testament taught Christ right
[45:57] see we
[45:59] say like I said if you don't see Christ
[46:01] in that reverse go back and look all
[46:04] right man and what did Brother Brown do
[46:05] he come back and said I preach the same
[46:07] thing Paul prays you know many times and
[46:11] I started looking this up trying to
[46:13] figure out see different things you know
[46:15] brother that's what I think he always
[46:17] done because he's out of my typologies
[46:18] all right yep you know you know and
[46:20] that's where he'd always go back to the
[46:22] Old Testament and pick things up and he
[46:24] would bring things from the Old
[46:25] Testament and bring things right in and
[46:27] he would show you the same thing that
[46:29] Paul preached because the Old Testament
[46:31] had it yep
[46:33] so that's one other thing that stands
[46:35] out about marriage and divorce you he
[46:36] said Paul Moses gave her grace
[46:40] yeah blew my mind
[46:43] he said Moses gave a Grace
[46:46] Paul gave a Grace and then he had a
[46:48] great stuff because it was the Sith Lord
[46:50] here he was bringing all the way through
[46:52] the scripture that's right
[46:54] see people think he added something or
[46:56] he changed something another related in
[46:58] the scripture the whole time amen but it
[47:00] took it but it took a prophet on wanting
[47:02] to see her someone that could look into
[47:04] the scripture
[47:06] and see these names because God had to
[47:09] come and show it
[47:12] and it's it's late in the scripture all
[47:14] this time right
[47:18] and yeah yeah we miss it
[47:20] that's right that's right see we can but
[47:23] we have we have been given
[47:25] the eyesight amen but you've got to use
[47:28] it right right see we've got to come to
[47:30] a place that we're using this eyesight
[47:32] right
[47:34] see we're we're a blessed people yeah
[47:37] we are so blessed that God what God has
[47:40] given us all right
[47:41] because you
[47:43] you think all the way through time
[47:45] people that people have desired to look
[47:47] at one and see what we have seen that's
[47:49] right and what we have heard
[47:51] because it has been laid before us amen
[47:55] that's right and see
[47:57] Paul continuing on here speaking of
[48:00] these things see we we have had a a
[48:03] Ministry
[48:05] because as continue on in the scripture
[48:08] here
[48:09] and he does a foundation that's been
[48:11] laid Yeah he said he said with a
[48:13] foundation he says I'm wise master
[48:14] builder he laid a foundation and then he
[48:17] goes on and speaks and he says let every
[48:19] man take Keith how you build if they're
[48:21] a pond man see there's been there's been
[48:25] a foundation laid for us amen and see
[48:27] it's been and we've got to come back to
[48:30] that same Foundation because there's
[48:32] only one foundation and that's Christ
[48:34] because he said he said because Upon
[48:36] This Rock I'll build my church and
[48:38] anybody that's in that church has got to
[48:40] go back to that same rock that same
[48:42] Foundation to build upon right yes sir
[48:45] and then here in the scripture we'll
[48:46] continue it on it in chapter three he
[48:49] says verse 12 says now if any man build
[48:51] upon this Foundation gold silver
[48:53] precious stone wood hay stubble he said
[48:56] every man's work shall be made manifest
[48:58] for the day shall declare it because it
[49:00] shall be revealed by fire and the fire
[49:02] shall try every man's work of what sort
[49:04] it is that's right that's right see if
[49:08] you look at some of these things that
[49:10] that Paul speaks of here
[49:13] excuse me
[49:16] because he talks about Haywood or
[49:17] stubble
[49:19] you know they're all consumed by fire
[49:21] right that's right amen but the first
[49:23] two you know gold and silver see they
[49:26] can be refined by five
[49:28] that's right so you're hearing something
[49:30] about these things he said because if
[49:31] you put the because that's what you want
[49:33] to do with gold you want to put it in
[49:34] the fire because it because it becomes
[49:36] greater because you're able to get all
[49:38] the impurity all the dross and
[49:40] everything out of it but he said every
[49:41] man's work shall be made manifest so
[49:44] you've got to come back to that
[49:45] Foundation because whatever is built
[49:47] upon that foundation will be made
[49:49] manifest amen and you've got to come
[49:51] back to that and every man has to come
[49:53] back and build on what he said right
[49:55] right because you know the Apostle Paul
[49:57] said even if I come back and preach
[50:00] something different than what I've
[50:02] already preached he said let me be a
[50:04] curse because I've got to build On My
[50:06] Own Foundation right because you know he
[50:08] said he said it he said follow me as I
[50:10] follow Christ because it wasn't it
[50:12] wasn't Paul preaching a message because
[50:14] it wasn't following the foundation but
[50:16] it was Christ laying the foundation
[50:17] through Paul so when Paul was laying
[50:19] upon it see he realized this Foundation
[50:21] came through God so everybody has to
[50:24] come back to this same Foundation right
[50:26] see that's the reason that a lot of
[50:28] people
[50:30] well there's not a lot of new genuine
[50:33] new births these big holes people are
[50:34] coming back to the same Foundation
[50:36] because we're not coming back to what
[50:39] what Paul preached
[50:41] right because they just allow anything
[50:43] to happen and even in when brother
[50:45] Brennan came back and and preached the
[50:47] new birth and came back to exactly what
[50:49] Paul said it was right and brought it
[50:51] out of the scripture to understand what
[50:53] the new birth was and then they turned
[50:54] around and say well brother Brandon
[50:55] didn't preach the new birth yeah
[50:58] right brother Brandon pricked something
[51:00] different oh yeah
[51:03] sure and every single time and you know
[51:07] you look at uh was it future home he
[51:09] covers the same thing in birth pains
[51:11] right
[51:14] so you you think about it uh now I think
[51:17] there was one other places I was reading
[51:18] my brother I was I was speaking on the
[51:20] same thing so you know everybody says
[51:22] well after the sales he prints something
[51:23] different but they're but there there
[51:25] was he said in the mouth of two or three
[51:26] Witnesses there's two different places
[51:27] where he breaks the exactly exactly what
[51:30] he preached the whole time and even in a
[51:32] few I believe future home he actually
[51:33] said you know I've always preached this
[51:35] so I mean just by based on what he said
[51:37] he he understood what he was talking
[51:39] about the problem is is people don't see
[51:41] right
[51:42] they were in a state of confusion but
[51:44] see we come back and we have to build on
[51:46] that same Foundation because brother
[51:48] random come back you know he said we had
[51:50] to come back and preach everything that
[51:52] Paul preached and it started with a new
[51:54] birth but it was a continuation of
[51:56] opening of the work to come back to the
[51:58] same place that he had preached yep
[52:01] right yeah we can build on that that we
[52:03] can that brother Bradham could come and
[52:05] bring his message
[52:07] so it had to come back to the beginning
[52:08] and so
[52:11] we see that he says if every man's work
[52:13] shall be burned he shall suffer loss but
[52:16] he himself shall be saved yet so as by
[52:19] fire
[52:20] he said no you're not that you are the
[52:22] temple of God and that the spirit of God
[52:23] dwelleth in you right
[52:26] right see if we if we realize Who We Are
[52:30] yeah we have we have one promise we have
[52:33] a we have a problems we have a guarantee
[52:34] right he said how did he the spirit of
[52:38] Truth has come that's it
[52:41] and not just come but come
[52:45] right right see it's not it's not that
[52:46] that he just come down but that he has
[52:49] to come down in you amen right that's
[52:51] right see it becomes an indwelling then
[52:54] he said he shall lead you and guide you
[52:55] in all truth right okay
[52:58] see it has to it has to become that
[53:00] indwelling so that he can lead you guide
[53:03] you all things because he said
[53:05] no you not that ye are the temple of God
[53:08] right
[53:10] and not just not just we know the temple
[53:12] of God but we are the temple of God as a
[53:14] body of Christ we are we are in we are
[53:16] the temple of God because it's all
[53:19] collectively together right amen
[53:22] because we all work together we all come
[53:25] into into this body as one so we make up
[53:27] the temple of God Amen and that's what
[53:29] he's talking about he continues on
[53:31] speaking of
[53:33] coming into this place where
[53:35] he said If any man defile the temple of
[53:37] God him shall God destroy for the temple
[53:39] of God is Holy which Temple ye are yes
[53:42] Lord that's right
[53:45] see when people speak of that see
[53:49] it goes back to what I was speaking of
[53:51] earlier it goes back to the unconfessed
[53:54] sin right
[53:56] hmm
[54:01] and that's what that's what makes the
[54:03] ministry so important amen
[54:06] because
[54:11] and I can't remember who it was but
[54:12] somebody was was preaching and they were
[54:14] and they were talking about uh
[54:16] you know why don't why do Pastors let
[54:19] things go on in the church we see things
[54:21] and you know why don't want to just jump
[54:22] up there and just pound that thing right
[54:24] yeah
[54:27] you know and it's like well maybe he's
[54:29] waiting on the Lord yeah
[54:31] yeah sure
[54:34] you know it's just like rather random
[54:35] you know in questions and answers
[54:36] talking to talking on marriage and
[54:38] divorce and you know he waited until the
[54:40] time that he was given a commission to
[54:42] do that right absolutely that's right
[54:46] see because because you know he said
[54:47] enter all the churches apart you know I
[54:49] mean he got he knew what was later in
[54:51] the scripture but he had to come to a
[54:53] time that he could that he could preach
[54:54] there right
[54:56] right and it's not and it's not that
[54:58] it's not seen in the church
[55:01] but maybe maybe they have to wait for a
[55:03] time that their that things have to come
[55:05] into place
[55:07] that something can be said
[55:10] or something you know that things will
[55:12] come into place then it's not that it's
[55:14] not that you know
[55:15] the pastor comes the pulpit and
[55:18] right
[55:20] see because
[55:22] I'm not in that position
[55:24] and I thank God I'm not in that position
[55:30] but he is and he has and he has and then
[55:34] has to come to that place he has to
[55:36] figure out what God wants him to do
[55:37] exactly
[55:39] because the worst the worst mistake that
[55:41] brother Dale could do is get up here and
[55:43] try to do things in his own self exactly
[55:44] amen amen
[55:46] and without without having
[55:49] the because God wants us to come to a
[55:52] place that we have wisdom right
[55:55] yeah and that's one of the things you've
[55:56] got to wait on him for that he can give
[55:58] you that right that's correct to give
[56:00] you the answer because it all has to
[56:02] come work together into this in this the
[56:05] plan so
[56:06] we wonder I'm confess sin
[56:10] see
[56:11] he said he said you can you make a whole
[56:13] attorney barely failed
[56:16] all the things that you can do that you
[56:18] can hinder someone
[56:22] see
[56:24] just like just like that that man that
[56:27] was the preacher
[56:29] yeah uh brother I was talking about you
[56:31] know just hung it up walked away yeah
[56:34] right so if I love the Lord I preach
[56:37] but I don't
[56:40] throw up his card and threw it in the
[56:41] trash you've done it finished
[56:45] brother Brian said the the one true sign
[56:47] the show that he was of God exactly that
[56:49] he was a Son of God was it God took him
[56:52] exactly wouldn't allow him to act that
[56:54] way right right
[56:55] I see
[56:57] if we go if we're going to have
[56:58] unconfessed sin and and
[57:01] what I was going to say earlier if you
[57:03] if you're going to a church an
[57:04] unconfessed sin it's a long it sits
[57:07] there forever just years and years and
[57:09] years just things that sit
[57:11] you you want to I've seen it happen too
[57:13] many times right to not to know it yeah
[57:17] that you want you watch churches and if
[57:20] if a pastor would turn a blind eye to
[57:22] sin in a church I said you wait and see
[57:25] he'll start preaching false doctors
[57:27] right right that thought because you
[57:29] wait you let down the devil have a
[57:32] strong you know foothold anywhere next
[57:34] thing you know you're you're washed away
[57:36] right because you give him a little bit
[57:38] and he'll take them out right
[57:42] sir
[57:43] that's reason that's reason the
[57:45] scripture tells us to abstain from all
[57:47] appearance of evil right right you get
[57:49] you can't even have the appearance of it
[57:51] if it looks bad even if it's not bad if
[57:53] it looks bad don't have it right amen
[57:55] exactly
[57:57] amen
[58:00] we are the temple of God Amen
[58:05] and so we know we have to know how to
[58:06] act
[58:07] I'm back in front of each other amen and
[58:11] in front of the world right that's it
[58:14] it's not it's not just how we act at
[58:17] church around Believers it's how we act
[58:20] in front of the world
[58:23] right
[58:25] you know there's a lot of people in the
[58:26] world that
[58:29] they
[58:32] never hand out a message book
[58:34] they've never quoted a scripture oh yeah
[58:37] sure
[58:39] they've never said anything
[58:43] but their life
[58:45] is their sermon right yeah their life is
[58:47] their testimony right the life that they
[58:50] live
[58:52] and I believe it was brother Biscoe was
[58:53] the one that was was speaking of how his
[58:55] how his father came to be saved was was
[58:58] a was a lady and I think it was two two
[59:00] girls
[59:01] her two daughters were there
[59:05] and you know he saw the life
[59:07] that that woman live right
[59:12] you know brother Brandon said just be
[59:13] soft
[59:16] and brother and I believe it's brother
[59:18] biscal's dad and he was so moved by that
[59:21] woman by the life that she leave me man
[59:24] and those two kids
[59:26] that he comes to her
[59:28] and said how do I be saved right amen
[59:31] amen because he was so moved by her
[59:33] testimony and it wasn't that she was out
[59:35] trying to preach the gospel right she
[59:38] lifted amen
[59:40] and that's what that's what's more
[59:42] important is to live is to live the life
[59:46] that's right
[59:48] he said that we can if we can die daily
[59:53] and let him live through us all right
[59:55] that if he if he's the one living the
[59:57] life that everybody ought to see Jesus
[1:00:00] Christ that's right it's not it's not
[1:00:02] that we have to get up and preach it it
[1:00:05] ought to be lived
[1:00:10] I said
[1:00:13] that that's that's my whole desire but
[1:00:15] is that people can see Jesus Christ in
[1:00:18] me right amen
[1:00:21] I don't want to I don't want to be one
[1:00:23] that
[1:00:25] they all has to beat on has to step on
[1:00:28] my toes
[1:00:30] I want to be the one right that the Holy
[1:00:32] Ghost thinks amen
[1:00:36] because if the Holy Ghost is dwelling in
[1:00:39] me
[1:00:41] that I want to be so yielded to him that
[1:00:44] I can line up
[1:00:47] and I don't have to be told amen
[1:00:52] because you know that that is a growth
[1:00:54] development amen
[1:00:56] that because I was preaching one time
[1:00:59] and
[1:01:01] there's a little boy sitting with his
[1:01:02] mama
[1:01:03] and I said you know there Comes A Time
[1:01:05] in your life I said when you get big
[1:01:07] enough
[1:01:08] when you got a runny nose you wipe your
[1:01:11] own nose yeah right you don't make
[1:01:13] somebody to walk it for you
[1:01:15] yeah and that Mama Turned that little
[1:01:16] boy anyway
[1:01:19] so obviously he would you know he got to
[1:01:21] the point where his mom was trying to
[1:01:22] tell him the same thing if it's old
[1:01:23] enough to wipe his own
[1:01:27] right hey sometimes that's the way it is
[1:01:29] you know we got as they say it's time to
[1:01:31] put on our big boy
[1:01:32] that's right
[1:01:34] you know we've got we've got to grow up
[1:01:36] man we've got we've got to come to the
[1:01:38] place that if if he's the dwelling
[1:01:40] inside of us that he's going to bring us
[1:01:42] to that place yeah then but we've got to
[1:01:45] come to that point right right we need
[1:01:47] we need that we don't need to be waiting
[1:01:49] any longer because we never know how
[1:01:51] much longer we're going to be
[1:01:56] back because that's what I that's what
[1:01:57] I'm looking for
[1:02:00] I'm looking to get out of here because
[1:02:03] if you see the condition of the world
[1:02:04] today
[1:02:08] you know how many people would believe
[1:02:10] that we'd be in the world be in the
[1:02:11] condition that it is in today
[1:02:16] you know how many how many you know you
[1:02:18] go back and look and see the see the
[1:02:20] founder the founders of this nation that
[1:02:22] we that we love so much
[1:02:25] I thank God I'm American
[1:02:27] yes sir I wouldn't want to live anywhere
[1:02:30] else that's right right
[1:02:32] I've only been in two other countries
[1:02:34] I've been in Jamaica and I've been in
[1:02:36] Mexico
[1:02:37] and I thank God when I cross back in
[1:02:38] there all right that's right
[1:02:42] I went you know because you know the if
[1:02:46] I didn't know where the international
[1:02:47] border was to the United States and
[1:02:49] Mexico I'd have never known I was in
[1:02:50] Mexico because a long time before I got
[1:02:52] there I was me and a few other folks we
[1:02:55] were the only white folks around and we
[1:02:57] found out that we didn't because
[1:02:58] everybody else was speaking Spanish and
[1:03:00] I didn't have no idea where I was at uh
[1:03:02] because I asked somebody I said we
[1:03:03] crossed the border yet it's like no
[1:03:05] you'll know when you crossed the border
[1:03:06] yeah yeah
[1:03:08] there's a lot of folks down there in
[1:03:10] uniforms with guns standing on the line
[1:03:12] that's right you know there were dogs
[1:03:14] and stuff checking cars going back and
[1:03:16] forth you know when you reach the when
[1:03:18] you're at the international border
[1:03:22] now when I was so I mean it's nice to go
[1:03:24] and visit but why couldn't wait to get
[1:03:25] back across
[1:03:28] yeah when I come back from Jamaica that
[1:03:29] lady asked me said you got anything to
[1:03:31] declare I said I declare I'm an American
[1:03:35] I love Jamaica but I wouldn't want to
[1:03:37] live there amen I love them brother
[1:03:39] Keith and all of them over there but I
[1:03:41] tell you what I like being here
[1:03:44] that's right I was so glad to be home
[1:03:47] yeah I just like to have some more of
[1:03:49] that Jamaican food every now and then
[1:03:51] yeah
[1:03:52] I'll go over there and eat a while yeah
[1:03:54] and I'm I'm so glad
[1:03:57] that God has given me but who would
[1:03:59] believe
[1:04:01] right you think anybody come on yep
[1:04:06] and
[1:04:09] you know you go to Washington and they
[1:04:13] spent and I'm gonna stop here a little
[1:04:14] bit you don't watch it when they spent
[1:04:16] millions of dollars and we've had these
[1:04:18] great monuments
[1:04:20] built of these Great Men
[1:04:22] and we have these great big pieces of
[1:04:25] marble and we have etched their words on
[1:04:27] there
[1:04:30] you think about that a five dollar bill
[1:04:32] we got Abraham Lincoln all right and the
[1:04:35] reason I like Abraham Lincoln because
[1:04:36] that's my birthday
[1:04:37] we share the same birthday February 12th
[1:04:39] I didn't know that so I have lots of
[1:04:42] books on he's always been one of my
[1:04:44] heroes but you think about all the
[1:04:46] things that Abraham Lincoln said they
[1:04:48] got marble
[1:04:49] big piece of marble all kind of stuff
[1:04:50] that's the airplane X books books books
[1:04:53] books books
[1:04:54] people go to college and the only thing
[1:04:56] they do their entire life
[1:04:59] they're a Lincoln historian yeah
[1:05:02] yeah they study everything that Abraham
[1:05:03] Lincoln ever said every place he ever
[1:05:05] been everything he ever done
[1:05:08] every every medical condition the man
[1:05:10] ever had yeah
[1:05:12] yeah they know it all
[1:05:15] and he wrote these words
[1:05:19] you can't
[1:05:20] make the poor Rich
[1:05:22] of making the rich Poker come on and you
[1:05:26] can't help them by taking away from the
[1:05:28] poor yeah
[1:05:29] all right that's paraphrasing but you
[1:05:31] know what I'm talking about right and he
[1:05:33] wrote all these things you can't
[1:05:34] strengthen the Weak by weakening the
[1:05:36] strong
[1:05:36] come on
[1:05:38] and he also wrote
[1:05:41] understand
[1:05:43] it and all these great words Abraham
[1:05:45] Lincoln said but my favorite my favorite
[1:05:48] one
[1:05:49] is this and it's a paraphrase
[1:05:51] but you can look it up
[1:05:54] and he said after I he said after this
[1:05:56] old with and I've laid down
[1:05:58] the Reigns of power
[1:06:00] he said if I don't have one another
[1:06:02] friend left in this world he said I have
[1:06:04] one
[1:06:05] and he's in me amen
[1:06:10] I tell you what that's fixed volume
[1:06:13] but you look at Abraham Lincoln we have
[1:06:15] all these great things that Abraham
[1:06:17] Lincoln says
[1:06:19] now I want you to look up here we spend
[1:06:21] money we got to preserve all that
[1:06:22] everything Abraham Lincoln President
[1:06:24] Lincoln he was wonderful wonderful
[1:06:26] yet he gave us in his own words
[1:06:31] the principles to live by right and you
[1:06:34] know what trample underfoot right we
[1:06:37] could care less what he had to say Amen
[1:06:39] because you know what we're going to
[1:06:40] live how we want to come on
[1:06:43] and you look at you look at things
[1:06:45] George Washington
[1:06:47] he's like he's like a great man of
[1:06:48] George Washington got a great Monument
[1:06:50] up there all right
[1:06:51] you know he could have been king that's
[1:06:54] right
[1:06:57] when he had when he was when he was a
[1:06:59] Kong when he was the general of the
[1:07:01] Continental Army
[1:07:03] every man that served under him they
[1:07:05] said he loved him him so much they'd
[1:07:07] have died for him yeah
[1:07:09] and all he had to say was you know what
[1:07:11] I'm gonna become a monarch
[1:07:14] I'm taking over and I'm gonna be a
[1:07:16] leader
[1:07:17] do you know what who would have stopped
[1:07:19] it he had the Army behind him right
[1:07:24] and yet he walked in there he was such a
[1:07:27] Christian and such a gentleman
[1:07:30] he said this is this is what we have
[1:07:32] fought for
[1:07:33] and he laid down that power and he
[1:07:36] stepped back yeah
[1:07:38] and it was a group of men that came
[1:07:40] together
[1:07:41] he could have been he could have been he
[1:07:43] could have been the King right sure
[1:07:46] but you know what
[1:07:47] he knew what what we were what we fought
[1:07:50] for right and we wanted to have this
[1:07:52] great nation
[1:07:55] and because of what he done
[1:07:57] and what a great leader he was that's
[1:07:59] the reason he became the first president
[1:08:00] of the United States
[1:08:03] and you go back and you read the things
[1:08:05] that he talked about
[1:08:08] and you know what they could care less
[1:08:10] that's exactly right
[1:08:12] these men these men and we started out
[1:08:14] we had to win you know we had a debt
[1:08:16] when we got a when we got our
[1:08:18] independence
[1:08:19] do you know what it costs it cost us
[1:08:21] money
[1:08:23] and do you know that the first man that
[1:08:24] came in this in this country Alexander
[1:08:26] Hamilton and those you know they were
[1:08:27] the ones that were working on getting us
[1:08:29] out of debt all right
[1:08:33] and you know that was that was the one
[1:08:35] thing that we wanted to have in this
[1:08:36] nation when we started was ability to
[1:08:38] pay our own debt right
[1:08:41] and you know what we've gotten to the
[1:08:43] point we're down 200 some odd years
[1:08:45] later
[1:08:46] people are talking about our government
[1:08:48] defaulting on its loans
[1:08:53] is this government going to be having
[1:08:55] enough money to pay its own bills
[1:08:59] blessing
[1:09:01] you think about all these great men that
[1:09:03] have lived through time all the things
[1:09:05] they've done and what they have done
[1:09:08] and all that they gave the Blood Sweat
[1:09:09] and Tears to come to this place and then
[1:09:11] see the kind of condition that we're in
[1:09:13] right
[1:09:15] why because we've we've walked away from
[1:09:18] our own principles that's right
[1:09:20] yeah right and not only not only say is
[1:09:22] that a natural Condition it's a
[1:09:25] spiritual condition you better believe
[1:09:26] that amen same difference see we we have
[1:09:29] walked away from our own principles

[1:19:25] apples and oranges looking at two
[1:19:27] different things right
[1:19:29] actually it means
[1:19:32] to look at something
[1:19:34] and in the Greek it also means to
[1:19:36] combine

[1:19:52] that which is good amen right comparing
[1:19:55] spiritual Faith with spiritual it's not
[1:19:56] just comparing things but holding on to
[1:19:58] that which is good which is do you see
[1:20:01] that is true but only says spiritual
[1:20:02] these things are freely given to us and
[1:20:04] he said comparing you look at it you
[1:20:07] discern it and then you hold on to it
[1:20:09] right because he said line upon line
[1:20:11] precept upon priesthood that's right and
[1:20:13] it's all built together
[1:20:16] but I'm so glad that these things were
[1:20:17] given to us all right amen glory
