[31:33] amen
[31:35] Ephesians
[31:38] come on
[31:40] everybody would be
[31:42] I use the same scripture for you know
[31:46] to stay on the topic and and that way at
[31:48] least you can say well
[31:51] we get to know that scripture anyway
[31:52] because we State on Revelations one for
[31:54] 25 or 30 services and now we're making
[31:58] this number 10 on this one reading from
[32:00] Ephesians so I hope you'll read the
[32:02] whole read it and see it's the whole
[32:04] Plan of Redemption is right here in the
[32:07] in the first chapter of Ephesians
[32:10] this is verse three blessed be the God
[32:12] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ hath
[32:14] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[32:16] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[32:20] as he has chosen us us in him before the
[32:23] foundation of the world that we should
[32:25] be holding Without Blame before him in
[32:27] love
[32:28] having predestinated us untrue the
[32:30] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[32:32] himself according to the good pleasure
[32:35] of his will
[32:37] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[32:39] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[32:41] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[32:44] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[32:46] sins according to the riches of his
[32:48] grace wherein he have to bounded toward
[32:51] us in all wisdom and Prudence having
[32:53] made known unto us the mystery of his
[32:56] will according to his good pleasure
[32:58] which he had purposed in himself to do
[33:00] what now that in the dispensation of the
[33:03] fullness of times
[33:04] you might gather together in one all
[33:07] things in Christ both which are in
[33:10] heaven and which are on earth even in
[33:12] him
[33:13] in whom also we have obtained an
[33:15] inheritance being predestinated
[33:17] according to the purpose of him who
[33:19] worketh all things after the Council of
[33:22] his own will that we should be to the
[33:24] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[33:29] Christ now Titus
[33:32] is hard to find but right behind Timothy
[33:36] I'm glad to have Timothy with us too and
[33:38] I haven't seen him in a while and saw
[33:41] him back there this morning because it'd
[33:43] be kind of hard not to be able to see
[33:44] him
[33:45] yeah
[33:47] he's pretty big fella and glad to see
[33:49] you Timothy
[33:51] Titus
[33:52] the second chapter and we'll begin
[33:54] reading about verse 11.
[33:59] for the grace that bringeth salvation
[34:03] hath appeared unto all men
[34:06] teaching us I like that I got written in
[34:09] my Bible grace is teaching us
[34:13] Titus second chapter verse 11.
[34:19] for the grace of God that bring us
[34:22] salvation hath appeared to all men
[34:25] teaching us now what
[34:29] denying the ungodedness and worldly Lush
[34:31] we should live us live soberly
[34:33] righteously and godly in this present
[34:35] world
[34:37] looking for that blessed hope and
[34:39] glorious appearing of the great God In
[34:42] Our Savior Jesus Christ
[34:45] who gave himself Forest that he might
[34:47] redeem us from all iniquity
[34:51] and purify unto himself that peculiar
[34:54] people azaleas of good works you may be
[34:58] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[35:00] reading of the word
[35:08] now we've been on
[35:10] predestination and we're still on it you
[35:13] know because we haven't covered it but
[35:15] we've been trying to talk about
[35:20] you know how it transpires
[35:23] and what comes to pass I hope you've
[35:27] understood the things I've tried to
[35:28] bring out about it and we will keep
[35:31] saying things about it but the main
[35:34] point is to see that God is not a
[35:37] respecter of persons
[35:39] uh so he has a way of doing things that
[35:43] uh the thing for him can't say why did
[35:46] you form me
[35:48] this way
[35:50] because it's not that away we form
[35:52] ourselves
[35:54] but then predestination see
[35:57] is actually
[36:00] the word
[36:01] is we're using it now and I'm not a
[36:05] English major whatsoever so forgive me
[36:07] but see predestination is actually a
[36:11] past tense
[36:12] when you put like that onto it and we'll
[36:15] talk about it in a minute of redeem and
[36:18] Redemption
[36:19] but see when you're talking about
[36:21] predestination
[36:24] it means that the destiny is already the
[36:27] term
[36:28] you know determined in God but yet it
[36:31] has not maybe been fulfilled right
[36:36] because see you're saying predestination
[36:40] if you just said predestinate
[36:43] see you you could stop at a point and
[36:46] and and do that but not not in the basis
[36:49] of when you're saying predestination
[36:53] because you're dealing with a finished
[36:55] product but now like I said watch it
[36:58] it's not necessarily that it's already
[37:01] finished
[37:02] but it's meaning that the one who done
[37:05] the predestinating
[37:07] you know was capable of looking all the
[37:12] way through
[37:15] and seeing it totally finished
[37:19] all right because that's predestinations
[37:22] and that's why I kept emphasizing what
[37:25] wrote around him had said
[37:27] that predestination now even the
[37:30] finished product
[37:32] is still looking back to foreknowledge
[37:37] because that way then you're dealing
[37:39] with the one who done the thinking
[37:43] you know and knowing that he's the one
[37:45] who can predestinate
[37:48] and then the full Destiny will be
[37:50] finished one day because you know it's
[37:53] not over yet and even when we walk out
[37:56] of here in a Rapture it's still not over
[37:59] you got the Jews and their part that
[38:01] there's a predestination to that and
[38:04] then you've got all of the other things
[38:06] coming
[38:07] but see that's what I want you to think
[38:09] about in the word
[38:10] redeem that's the reason I chose Titus
[38:13] in to using the word redeem
[38:17] all right we all know that the word
[38:20] redeem means to bring back or buy back
[38:23] all right we'll get to those things but
[38:27] see Redemption
[38:30] is meaning the the completion
[38:34] over here
[38:38] anybody listening
[38:40] the Redemption means that something has
[38:42] come already into existence
[38:45] and it's already in the process of
[38:48] traveling
[38:49] Through Time
[38:51] to to bring it to a place that it can be
[38:54] a finished product
[38:56] but now whereas the word redeem
[39:00] the
[39:01] is not traveling forward
[39:05] you know
[39:07] the word Redemption she is looking out
[39:09] dire see you're looking out there to
[39:12] something but the word redeem if mean if
[39:15] you're going back that away
[39:17] you're trying to find out where you came
[39:19] from right all right now keep that in
[39:21] mind and it'll help you you'll
[39:24] understand why I've emphasized it you
[39:27] know the word Eternal means that you go
[39:29] just as far that away
[39:31] but if you can't go just as far back
[39:34] that away
[39:36] is you can that away with your plan of
[39:38] of Eternity then you you there's no way
[39:43] to know that you're correct right
[39:46] but then the only problem you see the
[39:49] the part I said is you go back to find
[39:52] out who done the predestinating
[39:55] and that's what we've been trying to do
[39:57] is to see how God could predestinate
[40:01] and make it a predestination to go all
[40:04] the way through
[40:06] and not be a respect to a person
[40:08] and come out to the to the right way all
[40:10] right now so we want to do with the same
[40:12] word redeem
[40:14] we want to make sure that we can look
[40:17] back
[40:19] because in the scripture we read here in
[40:23] Ephesians it talks about the the
[40:25] Redemption
[40:26] yeah
[40:28] and it's a basic word that's used more
[40:31] than the word redeemed the word redeem
[40:33] in the New Testament only used I think
[40:34] twice I believe that's correct it's in
[40:38] Titus in the
[40:40] is one other Galatians all right
[40:43] and uh so then
[40:46] think with me about what I'm trying to
[40:48] say
[40:52] to redeem something
[40:56] is to actually take it back
[41:00] to its originality
[41:03] right
[41:05] all right see now you say well I'm going
[41:08] to restore
[41:12] a 55 Chevrolet
[41:15] that's what we think about a redeeming
[41:17] part
[41:19] but it's impossible to restore one
[41:26] you say no no no no we put every piece
[41:29] back on
[41:30] that's that's not the point that's right
[41:33] if you're going to restore it
[41:36] you would have to build it right you
[41:39] know and it's not building from used
[41:42] parts that are 100 years old
[41:45] it would be building it from the
[41:48] original right off the assembly line and
[41:50] that's impossible to do right so then we
[41:54] get our mind hooked into what we think
[41:55] Redemption means and things like that
[41:57] and and sometimes it doesn't mean
[41:59] especially in scriptural terms so get
[42:02] the point now and then we'll we'll back
[42:04] up and go on the when you're talking
[42:06] about Redemption watch it
[42:08] hey
[42:10] Redemption through his blood
[42:15] so we have a finished
[42:19] product
[42:22] but that's what God is looking at
[42:26] because
[42:28] if we haven't fulfilled that
[42:32] we're still in the travel process so
[42:35] you'll see that in the scriptures you'll
[42:37] have doing it but now Hebrews 9 15 calls
[42:41] it
[42:42] Eternal Redemption all right now I like
[42:45] that
[42:47] now we can go back with it as far as we
[42:50] need to go back with it on Eternal
[42:52] Redemption
[42:54] because just remember one thing
[42:56] that one time God stamped something
[43:00] he can never change his mind
[43:03] right you can't have another thought
[43:06] you can't think of another way of doing
[43:08] something
[43:09] once he says
[43:11] that it's finished we agree
[43:14] yeah well you know see it's hard to keep
[43:17] preaching because
[43:19] then when are we going to believe
[43:23] that's right that God
[43:26] has set forth the whole plan he just
[43:30] wants us to believe it right and to walk
[43:32] in it right right and that we're just as
[43:35] eternal
[43:36] and soul
[43:39] as we'll ever be right
[43:42] the soul is redeemed yes yes sir man
[43:46] past tense
[43:49] all right but we're still in the
[43:51] Redemption of the body
[43:55] because it's coming true
[43:58] all right so now keep these in mind and
[44:01] we'll we'll back up to it a little bit
[44:02] more in a minute but I want that thought
[44:04] in your mind of the point of what I'm
[44:06] trying to get across to you all right
[44:08] now
[44:10] so we ended up this morning on talking
[44:13] about the predestination and and my wife
[44:17] said I read something wrong this morning
[44:19] so when I read something wrong you you
[44:21] put it under the way it's supposed to be
[44:22] you just look at it and come into my
[44:24] ignorance and and forgive me and I try
[44:27] to do the best I can but to get in such
[44:28] a big hurry trying to you know you have
[44:31] a 23 notes you want to read and you're
[44:34] trying to to help the people and you're
[44:36] standing there reading and you're
[44:37] thinking those people ain't they want
[44:38] you to shut up they want you to shut up
[44:40] they want you to shut up that's the
[44:42] thoughts you're getting you know yeah so
[44:44] you know give them the notes I'm going
[44:46] on but uh forgive me all right but now
[44:50] listen
[44:54] we talked about
[44:57] that the prophet said we always was
[44:59] eternal right
[45:03] do not believe that
[45:07] but see that's looking at it from the
[45:09] way God looks at it
[45:13] right
[45:13] because me looking at it
[45:18] I realize
[45:20] that
[45:21] as I gave the quote this morning that
[45:24] there was a time I had a beginning
[45:27] so it definitely can't be speaking of
[45:30] this body
[45:33] so let's get that all out of our mind
[45:35] see that's that's what now forgive me
[45:38] listen now I try to explain something
[45:40] and I know that it's hard to do which
[45:45] see you said well I ain't got my money
[45:47] my body's not involved
[45:49] people would swear to you about that and
[45:53] fight you on the basis of saying I'm not
[45:56] talking about my body
[46:00] well
[46:01] I come out of the Baptist Church and as
[46:05] I said this morning they had the the
[46:07] doctrine of
[46:09] one God
[46:11] all right and that argued that there was
[46:15] only one God
[46:21] I mean they would they would you know I
[46:22] would I would be you know it really
[46:26] Stern there's just one God the Bible
[46:28] says it you know
[46:30] but see in my thinking
[46:34] I was thinking because that's what I've
[46:36] been taught
[46:37] that it was God in three persons Blessed
[46:39] Trinity
[46:41] that's when brother Modi said
[46:43] what do you believe in that's what I
[46:44] told him
[46:46] and he said you're just this trinitarian
[46:48] this the rest of my person's a
[46:50] personality personalities and individual
[46:52] individuals a person
[46:53] you just this Trinity is any Trinity
[46:57] and I looked at him and said it I didn't
[47:00] back up I said don't believe that no
[47:02] more
[47:03] well see I've seen that what we were
[47:05] doing was words from our mouth
[47:09] was saying one thing but thoughts in our
[47:13] heart was believing another thing
[47:16] all right now are you with me right see
[47:19] then that's the way we can be about
[47:21] predestination right
[47:24] that's the way we can be about
[47:26] Redemption
[47:28] if we can swear
[47:32] people will stay but but brother Dale
[47:35] I'm not talking about the body
[47:38] and then you said this moment you spend
[47:41] if I told her there's more muscle has
[47:43] been
[47:44] you know stretched and pulled by people
[47:48] in front of the mirror you know
[47:50] reflecting their muscles in their head
[47:51] by weight lifting I mean because we all
[47:55] have that idea
[47:56] see this body is involved whether you
[47:59] like it or not
[48:02] this body is the one that's portraying
[48:06] amen what is within it right
[48:11] and you know you start changing your
[48:14] styles
[48:15] there's something wrong with about what
[48:17] you're doing evidently no you didn't
[48:19] like the other style and it may be
[48:21] forever now
[48:23] but you know you're calling your Higher
[48:25] One Way and then you start calling
[48:27] another why
[48:28] well I just want to come out another way
[48:30] no
[48:32] you saw somebody you liked it or
[48:34] something you know see we're still tied
[48:36] to this old body
[48:39] and this body is
[48:41] controlling us whether we like to
[48:43] believe it or not
[48:45] and he's still involved
[48:47] all right now it is that way so much
[48:51] until the human body of the Lord Jesus
[48:54] Christ
[48:55] I had a controlling Factor now I don't
[48:59] know how to say it no education but it
[49:01] had a controlling Factor upon his life
[49:05] because he was laying down in a ship one
[49:07] night asleep because he was tired
[49:11] now I know what wrote around him I know
[49:14] the old messages are going but you've
[49:15] got to keep him to where he's tired and
[49:16] then you gotta then you can bring it
[49:18] down to where he says that he would just
[49:20] really back here acting like he's asleep
[49:22] he won't see what they do you know I
[49:25] know the story so let's just get all the
[49:27] story all right but now listen
[49:31] we say we always were you know I always
[49:34] was eternal
[49:36] like I said in the same message
[49:39] that that's within the prophet said if
[49:42] you have eternal life
[49:45] so now I emphasize that
[49:49] the quotes I gave this morning is not
[49:51] all of what he said about it you know
[49:53] it's just some some ones you read all of
[49:56] them to where the Prophet was saying if
[49:58] you have eternal life
[50:00] you always was eternal right
[50:04] meaning what
[50:06] there was a time you didn't have it
[50:09] there was a time you received it and the
[50:12] day you received it you were just as
[50:15] eternal
[50:17] as you ever will be
[50:20] now that would be in your soul it's not
[50:21] talking about your body and spirit right
[50:23] but then I was trying to emphasize
[50:27] that that one day there will be a
[50:29] foolish virgin given eternal life
[50:31] but we would agree wholeheartedly that
[50:33] in the Earthly journey of that
[50:36] individual
[50:37] there was no place that that individual
[50:40] could claim originality of eternal life
[50:47] they couldn't say
[50:51] when I was down through there and I felt
[50:53] now they find out that they missed it
[50:56] but they're giving eternal life
[51:01] but when they're giving eternal life
[51:07] then they can say
[51:09] this he liked this life I now have as
[51:12] Paul said the life that I now live in
[51:14] the flesh I live by the faith of the Son
[51:16] of God in other words I have eternal
[51:18] life
[51:21] see then just remember that if is the
[51:24] question right right if you have eternal
[51:26] life the eternal life you have
[51:29] see then John's correct in the basis of
[51:32] saying
[51:34] if that seed remains in you
[51:38] you can't sin
[51:39] that's right
[51:42] why
[51:44] it's not that you can't do wrong because
[51:46] we sin every day right it's the seed it
[51:50] can't sin
[51:52] all right
[51:55] all right she didn't get into that basis
[51:59] and thinking about it
[52:03] then we must realize that the quotes
[52:06] that are used
[52:08] can be used
[52:10] in any form we want to
[52:13] you know
[52:14] and and thereby we can prove a point by
[52:17] what we're saying
[52:20] and you can get into where people don't
[52:22] want to talk about it and they ain't
[52:23] doing us thinking about it the other day
[52:25] do you know what a uh
[52:27] uh in the court of law
[52:30] they have that thing there that you you
[52:32] can't answer you can't ask certain
[52:34] questions
[52:36] because it's called a form called a
[52:39] leading question
[52:41] all right
[52:42] and and by that you say okay
[52:45] now brother Donnie you answer my
[52:48] question yes or no
[52:51] now you're not allowed to comment
[52:53] because that's where they make it to you
[52:55] see
[52:56] you answer this question yes or no
[53:06] do you beat your wife anymore
[53:17] you see what I'm asking if he says no I
[53:22] said your honor you see he would guilt
[53:24] in doing it because
[53:28] and they surely don't want to say yes
[53:31] Joe that's a leading question
[53:34] I find that used in the people of the
[53:37] message
[53:39] because
[53:41] they lay down a situation to you
[53:45] think that even you will answer
[53:48] and agree to the situation
[53:51] that's being laid down but then in the
[53:54] final analysis of the question
[53:56] I can say to you okay now Brothers now
[54:00] we believe everything brother says don't
[54:02] we
[54:04] we believe everything he says
[54:07] all right now so I'm gonna cost you
[54:10] something see if you believe it
[54:13] you always was eternal
[54:17] I see answer that yes or no
[54:24] if you say no you're denying the truth
[54:31] if you say yes
[54:36] you're making a false Doctrine
[54:40] so you can't answer that yes or no can
[54:42] you
[54:45] so much you got to do when they ask you
[54:47] a question is you got to turn to the
[54:49] judge and you say your honor
[54:51] I will answer that question
[54:54] only if you allow me to comment
[55:02] see that way see Donnie could say now
[55:05] I'm on the way I'm going to answer his
[55:07] question is allow me to comment
[55:10] and see if they don't allow you to
[55:12] comment then they can't use it then
[55:14] you'd say when I listen
[55:16] the way he stated that and I answered no
[55:19] and had no reference that I'd ever done
[55:21] it before
[55:22] I never would do it again see you've
[55:24] answered the question
[55:26] right
[55:27] no now that's the way to me that I look
[55:30] at the Bible
[55:32] and the prophet's message
[55:35] you gotta agree with what the prophet
[55:38] has said
[55:40] right
[55:41] you'd be a total idiot not to
[55:45] not agree with what the Bible says
[55:49] all right
[55:51] and then where someone like Dave
[55:58] and he said Lord
[56:00] not word have I hid in my heart
[56:03] then I might not sin against it
[56:09] me
[56:10] knowing what he's done
[56:15] right then it turned out that
[56:19] it must be revealed to us what is being
[56:22] said if you understand David
[56:27] do you ever do anything wrong
[56:31] man I'm the worst of all
[56:34] well how can you make a statement like
[56:36] that
[56:38] see what everybody thinks now here's the
[56:40] point and it's got a truth to it now see
[56:41] it's what I'm I'm laying down some
[56:43] little things for you to think of them
[56:45] see there's the truth that David said
[56:47] blessed is the man to whom God will not
[56:49] impute sin you could say that's pointing
[56:50] down to a person with a new birth
[56:53] okay that's the truth
[56:57] you see David said it in the spirit
[57:02] and even though David
[57:04] sinned
[57:07] Nathan said David you will not die right
[57:14] from that David
[57:17] brought forth blessed is the man to whom
[57:19] God will not impute I reckon or keep
[57:23] countless sin
[57:25] see listen bro survival that away let's
[57:27] approach the the message of the hour
[57:29] that away
[57:31] that we wait for God to reveal something
[57:33] to us instead of just saying I can show
[57:37] you the quote
[57:42] I don't agree with you because right
[57:43] around says so and so we'll bring it and
[57:46] let's put it in the message with it
[57:49] you know
[57:51] it doesn't bother me whatsoever for you
[57:54] to bring it and say well look what he
[57:55] said here
[57:57] I enjoy that because I realize
[58:01] that if he is a prophet and unless it is
[58:04] some human error
[58:06] that he has made
[58:09] which we know he was subject to those
[58:11] things are saying five hundred five
[58:12] seven five thousand seven hundred
[58:14] whatever
[58:16] we would realize that
[58:18] things will have to come together
[58:21] and then we'll realize one thing for
[58:23] sure
[58:24] there is no other way to say it
[58:26] then the way brought around said it
[58:29] there is no other way of saying anything
[58:31] than the way the Bible said it
[58:35] they have tried let's see what was it
[58:37] I've mentioned another day a while back
[58:39] they have tried to improve upon which
[58:42] one was it is it John 3 16.
[58:45] come on the Lord's Prayer
[58:48] believe it truth the Lord's Prayer all
[58:51] right they've tried to improve upon that
[58:55] he said they've always tried to improve
[58:57] upon that one prior
[58:59] you know we're teaching us to pray now
[59:02] not John 17 that's right
[59:07] he said there's no way they can add
[59:08] anything to it or take anything from it
[59:11] because it's so perfect
[59:14] so at one night when brother Harris had
[59:16] a kidney uh stone that was killing him
[59:19] and I've never seen a man hurt that much
[59:20] so I mean it just
[59:23] it would hit him and just hit him into
[59:24] this that kidney stone you that had him
[59:26] and we were sitting in a place eating
[59:28] and he looked at me and he said God damn
[59:30] he said I'm dying from Pain and then
[59:32] from one second I saw a black man almost
[59:34] turned white I don't mean that wrong
[59:37] you just turned real pale looking and I
[59:41] mean just started sweating just running
[59:44] off of him
[59:46] I realized he was in pain you know
[59:48] terrific pain they
[59:52] and we prayed and we prayed and we
[59:54] prayed
[59:58] and finally we all got together
[1:00:02] and we said the Lord's Prayer
[1:00:06] not sure he went on to the hospital and
[1:00:08] had to have it removed Etc that's fine
[1:00:10] but you know what all at once he was
[1:00:12] just
[1:00:14] totally free of the pain
[1:00:18] see they can't add to the Lord's Prayer
[1:00:20] okay I won't charge you just try to get
[1:00:22] a point to your mind because you see
[1:00:24] that's the way I do when I look at the
[1:00:26] message of the hour I don't look at what
[1:00:29] quotes I can find to prove my point
[1:00:32] I actually look for things to see if
[1:00:35] brother Branham said something will tear
[1:00:37] down my point
[1:00:40] I spend as much time to tear down as I
[1:00:44] do trying to build up
[1:00:46] I just get and go preach it yeah and
[1:00:48] that's why there's so much happening
[1:00:52] do a lot less air off we just took our
[1:00:54] time
[1:00:55] yeah
[1:00:57] you may be nervous but I'm not you know
[1:01:00] I'm trying to do the best I can
[1:01:03] but see we can look at things and we can
[1:01:04] say well this is what I believe well why
[1:01:07] do you believe it that way
[1:01:13] now we were talking this morning right
[1:01:15] at the end
[1:01:17] worth it
[1:01:18] you know
[1:01:19] we were talking about the the seed
[1:01:23] and the finishing up and we're not
[1:01:26] finished on that we will get back to it
[1:01:29] you know so I wanna
[1:01:32] I want to read a couple of things before
[1:01:34] we go into the red part of redeeming so
[1:01:38] look at number one a now I brought these
[1:01:41] and it's you know I do it I pick up
[1:01:43] things later and get to thinking about
[1:01:45] it so look at 1A the message called
[1:01:48] communion one of the the great things
[1:01:51] that they spend a lot of time dwelling
[1:01:54] upon
[1:01:57] and you know people do
[1:02:00] it's the last message wrote around and
[1:02:01] preached
[1:02:03] which would be paragraph 49 the
[1:02:05] communion 65 12. what was it
[1:02:09] there was another William Brown
[1:02:14] see
[1:02:15] a little spot
[1:02:18] of eternal life down there
[1:02:23] and show everybody says see there was
[1:02:25] born with a spot of eternal life down
[1:02:26] there
[1:02:28] from the genes of God
[1:02:35] the word of God that was placed in there
[1:02:40] okay
[1:02:42] now remember
[1:02:44] it's not the person that comes
[1:02:45] predestinated eternally from God it's
[1:02:47] the word or seed right 154 Church age
[1:02:49] book
[1:02:52] then I looked up to the trees
[1:02:58] I've seen you fall off last year and
[1:03:00] what are you back there again
[1:03:03] where'd you come from
[1:03:05] what brought you here
[1:03:08] it was the eternal life working in the
[1:03:11] body
[1:03:13] then one day as I walked on to what that
[1:03:16] voice talking
[1:03:18] don't never Smoke Drink and so forth
[1:03:22] the young Fellers and all I got older
[1:03:24] and see there was something moving
[1:03:27] we get all at once I looked up and I
[1:03:29] said
[1:03:31] I'm not the son of Charles and Ella
[1:03:33] Brown
[1:03:34] there's something calling
[1:03:36] Mike my little eagle
[1:03:39] I'm not a chicken
[1:03:41] there's something up yonder somewhere oh
[1:03:45] great Jehovah whoever you are open it up
[1:03:48] I want to come on
[1:03:50] there's something in me calling
[1:03:54] then I was born again
[1:03:57] that little life was laying there
[1:04:00] the life of water was poured upon it
[1:04:04] then it began to grow
[1:04:06] that old life was forgiven
[1:04:09] put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to
[1:04:12] Never Be Remembered against me no more
[1:04:13] see now we stand Justified as though we
[1:04:17] never had sin in the presence of God
[1:04:20] so now everybody takes that
[1:04:24] and they take it and they'll use it like
[1:04:26] I said they use that quote we were
[1:04:27] talking this morning always was eternal
[1:04:31] and then this they shut their minds off
[1:04:33] totally and won't listen to any uh form
[1:04:37] of understanding
[1:04:40] and I know what that is because I I know
[1:04:44] what it's done you talked to a a good uh
[1:04:47] any any denominational person especially
[1:04:49] something that are pretty well read
[1:04:51] especially say a badges
[1:04:54] and you try to concern him the the truth
[1:04:57] of one true and living God and he'll say
[1:04:59] this
[1:05:00] I can't accept that Doctrine
[1:05:04] because if I deny the father
[1:05:07] I'll deny the son
[1:05:09] and he'll quote you scripture
[1:05:15] and it's true what he quotes
[1:05:18] If you deny the father
[1:05:21] then you automatically denying the sun
[1:05:23] because it's one person
[1:05:25] but the scripture see is saying If you
[1:05:29] deny the father Son and Holy Ghost as
[1:05:32] being one
[1:05:34] you're denying the truth
[1:05:36] but you can't have one God without
[1:05:39] having Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:05:43] all right
[1:05:45] so if you deny you're a Tunis you know
[1:05:47] you cut down one you cut hey
[1:05:51] but you see we want to make it to work
[1:05:54] that we want something down in there
[1:06:00] and see then it you know it can be
[1:06:08] we want something to hold on to
[1:06:12] and it's identically the same thing as
[1:06:15] saying I've been good
[1:06:19] I'll quote brother random
[1:06:21] brother Brown when he was shot by that
[1:06:23] gun
[1:06:24] and was thought he was dying and was
[1:06:27] falling and you know in the trance and
[1:06:29] things and going downward what did he
[1:06:32] say
[1:06:35] he said Lord
[1:06:38] the only thing good I've got
[1:06:44] to see people say boy that just turned
[1:06:46] him around right there and seen him
[1:06:48] right back
[1:06:54] that one what turned him around
[1:06:56] hey what does what people will say dude
[1:07:00] look at that the only thing that he had
[1:07:01] done was he had committed adultery so
[1:07:03] that turned him around all right and
[1:07:05] then you find out that type of person
[1:07:07] has got to get an adultery problem
[1:07:08] somewhere back to their lineage or
[1:07:10] through their their families or
[1:07:12] something and they're trying to justify
[1:07:14] things
[1:07:15] all right but now listen
[1:07:19] people want to take when veteran made
[1:07:21] that statement
[1:07:23] then they want to jump over see
[1:07:27] and and try to pick up something let's
[1:07:30] just keep on reading let's read on
[1:07:31] Christ the mystery God revealed
[1:07:34] was preached in 1963 728 page 67.
[1:07:40] you can't commit adultery you're already
[1:07:42] impregnated
[1:07:43] Glory he can't take a hold the womb of
[1:07:47] life is closed than anything else
[1:07:50] you're already his by predestination
[1:07:53] that seed has to come to life
[1:07:56] no world can get in oh oh and we'd like
[1:08:01] to stay on this for about an hour I'm
[1:08:03] sure you understand Christ in his alone
[1:08:05] already finished the seed was Dire
[1:08:09] the seed was already seed was already
[1:08:12] listen
[1:08:14] when was it put dark
[1:08:18] before the foundation of the world
[1:08:24] so now you have a statement from the
[1:08:27] prophet that looks like that some kind
[1:08:29] of little seed was born in there
[1:08:32] something about the word
[1:08:34] and then you have him telling you where
[1:08:36] that when that was put there
[1:08:40] it was put there before the world began
[1:08:43] so was she William Branham back there
[1:08:46] before the world began as a person
[1:08:49] for it to be able to be put it in
[1:08:56] asking the question
[1:09:01] is he saying that he was back there
[1:09:05] what part of him was back there
[1:09:10] any part you put back there
[1:09:14] you see where the trouble would be
[1:09:17] he says it was put there before the
[1:09:21] foundation of the world
[1:09:23] now before the foundation of the world
[1:09:26] we could only be in the mind of God
[1:09:34] which one is correct
[1:09:42] going down works as Faith expressed
[1:09:46] 1965 11 26. now here predestinated plan
[1:09:50] is in plain view
[1:09:53] just as other seed the word of God is a
[1:09:56] seed that must have the ground prepared
[1:09:59] beforehand
[1:10:00] if you shall see just throw it out there
[1:10:03] on the ground you wouldn't do no good
[1:10:05] the birds were picking up you throw it
[1:10:08] among thistles and thorns and choking
[1:10:10] out pretty soon
[1:10:11] Jesus's Parable said
[1:10:13] so the ground has to be made ready first
[1:10:18] all right
[1:10:19] now keep reading
[1:10:21] so God in Sovereign Grace
[1:10:26] prepares the heart first
[1:10:30] he prepared you you for the foundation
[1:10:34] of the world
[1:10:37] to receive him in this age
[1:10:43] before you knew you by four not his
[1:10:45] foreknowledge and ordained you to
[1:10:47] eternal life he knew you therefore he
[1:10:50] prepared you
[1:10:52] now
[1:10:55] did you come into the world with eternal
[1:10:57] life
[1:11:00] did you come into the world with a seed
[1:11:04] dwelling down within you
[1:11:07] if it did where was it put and when it
[1:11:09] was put when was it put though
[1:11:13] he said it was before the world
[1:11:15] he said he prepared us before the world
[1:11:18] so we need to consider then
[1:11:21] it's the seed he's talking about
[1:11:26] the seed is his word
[1:11:28] now we've done been through where the
[1:11:31] little woman at the well she had
[1:11:33] representation
[1:11:35] from predestination
[1:11:40] in other words God knew she would want
[1:11:42] to be saved
[1:11:44] sometimes
[1:11:46] well did she have to have something
[1:11:49] stamped in there is my point
[1:11:54] or was it God's foreknowledge
[1:11:57] that all he had to do was cross your
[1:11:59] path
[1:12:03] yeah
[1:12:05] which one was it
[1:12:08] do we talk about redeem but
[1:12:13] you better be careful
[1:12:16] because you might redeem yourself out of
[1:12:18] existence
[1:12:23] that's what most people do with it
[1:12:26] me all right
[1:12:29] now
[1:12:31] I believe what the prophet said
[1:12:35] because he's trying to explain
[1:12:39] the difference between
[1:12:42] the we call it Bride is a word where you
[1:12:45] use it or chosen of God
[1:12:49] and everybody else
[1:12:52] but you know in explaining that he calls
[1:12:55] it non-seed
[1:12:58] hmm
[1:13:01] and we preached on it a while back on
[1:13:04] that what is non-seed
[1:13:08] let's not see no
[1:13:13] none seed
[1:13:16] is a seed
[1:13:18] that can make all of the
[1:13:21] popcorn you I mean though
[1:13:24] cornbread if you want
[1:13:29] but it has no life
[1:13:34] that's why you look out here and you see
[1:13:35] it all across the land
[1:13:37] that's what John saw on Patmos
[1:13:41] when he saw the church
[1:13:47] of the church because it's beautiful
[1:13:51] look at them out there
[1:13:54] he flew the church right across over
[1:13:56] here
[1:13:58] they're feeding the poor
[1:14:01] how many of us are feeding the blood
[1:14:09] on a certain day they'd come by here and
[1:14:11] pick up food
[1:14:15] are we doing that
[1:14:20] what's the difference then
[1:14:23] none seed
[1:14:25] you mean you tell me that those
[1:14:26] Pharisees wasn't religious
[1:14:30] you mean you tell me that if you're
[1:14:32] organized religion today is not
[1:14:33] religious
[1:14:35] yes they are
[1:14:39] there's a lot of difference in religion
[1:14:41] and Christianity
[1:14:43] but the difference between the two is
[1:14:45] one of them with the seed that's
[1:14:47] quickened
[1:14:48] alive and the other one
[1:14:51] you can never be quick unto them
[1:14:54] because in none seed we've got it right
[1:14:57] over the next page
[1:14:58] you'll turn over to number one on your
[1:15:00] notes and then start you'll see
[1:15:04] and I forgot to bring this or I read you
[1:15:07] what it goes this is 152 I'll read you
[1:15:10] what goes right before 162. most of you
[1:15:12] know it anyway we've been over and over
[1:15:14] and over
[1:15:15] we did not become seed by rebirth
[1:15:24] we were seen
[1:15:27] and therefore
[1:15:28] were reborn now that's not on your nose
[1:15:31] so don't
[1:15:33] for only the elect
[1:15:35] can be
[1:15:37] Reborn
[1:15:39] now reborn means to be born again right
[1:15:44] right
[1:15:45] and that's what Jesus said to Nicodemus
[1:15:49] and Nicodemus knew the natural
[1:15:52] he knew exactly the wording the man
[1:15:55] brought
[1:15:56] he knew that to be born again
[1:16:00] meant you would have to have a another
[1:16:03] beginning
[1:16:07] Nicodemus knew that he wouldn't have
[1:16:09] done it
[1:16:10] Jesus didn't say what you needed to be
[1:16:12] saved not bad he said you must be born
[1:16:16] again Born Again means to be doing it
[1:16:20] again
[1:16:24] you see Nicodemus says you mean if I do
[1:16:26] it again I go back to my mother
[1:16:32] but he couldn't understand what Jesus
[1:16:34] was saying
[1:16:36] because he knew the word re
[1:16:39] coming before born
[1:16:42] means that some way you existed before
[1:16:47] you got to go back
[1:16:52] and come back through your mother again
[1:16:56] because that would be reborn
[1:17:00] see when you put that Ray on there
[1:17:04] that means that it existed before
[1:17:07] it happened before
[1:17:09] you see Jesus was telling Nicodemus your
[1:17:13] first birth is what killed you
[1:17:18] you must be reborn
[1:17:22] my original says You must be born from
[1:17:26] above
[1:17:28] in other words born from where I come
[1:17:31] from
[1:17:32] I'm going to have to die give my life
[1:17:34] before this can ever transpire
[1:17:38] she's not all written there
[1:17:41] you know
[1:17:44] because remember
[1:17:47] some way oh ever who wrote that Matthew
[1:17:50] you know he must have heard that from
[1:17:52] somebody else because was he sitting up
[1:17:54] there when Jesus and Nicodemus was
[1:17:56] together I don't know
[1:17:58] maybe he was but maybe he heard it later
[1:18:01] too because like Luke and some of them
[1:18:03] she was Luke and Mark were not original
[1:18:06] disciples
[1:18:10] all right
[1:18:11] but my point is what
[1:18:14] listen
[1:18:15] we did not become seed by the rebirth
[1:18:21] so then there's got to be a seed
[1:18:24] some way
[1:18:27] that we can get to
[1:18:31] bring it correctly
[1:18:34] you remember what we were bringing out
[1:18:35] when we preached a couple of messages on
[1:18:37] The Germ of life
[1:18:41] you've never seen all you want to but
[1:18:42] for German life is not in that seed it
[1:18:45] will not reproduce correct and what is
[1:18:48] the germ of life
[1:18:49] it is totally invisible
[1:18:52] science cannot find it
[1:18:57] science cannot find the germ of life
[1:19:01] it is totally invisible
[1:19:04] all of their x-rays
[1:19:07] all of their doings
[1:19:10] can't find the germ of life
[1:19:14] but you
[1:19:17] you know I don't like to use the natural
[1:19:20] story so much but them old chickens them
[1:19:22] old dogs and horses and them cows and
[1:19:25] they eat things and
[1:19:28] and then once the tree comes up
[1:19:33] where'd it come from
[1:19:35] the grass comes up where'd it come from
[1:19:37] you didn't plan it
[1:19:39] it was in that
[1:19:43] you know
[1:19:46] the thing the chickens dropped
[1:19:50] but where could you find it
[1:19:54] all right
[1:19:56] now if that be true then
[1:20:01] you know that you can't find the germ of
[1:20:03] life
[1:20:06] well then you couldn't find the germ of
[1:20:09] eternal life the one we read the prophet
[1:20:11] said you had in you
[1:20:14] the gene of eternal life
[1:20:18] because remember in in uh studying your
[1:20:22] biology I guess is what it seemed isn't
[1:20:25] it which one's it in other words you go
[1:20:27] from a gene to a germ
[1:20:30] and if they can't find a germ you surely
[1:20:33] can't find the gene because a gene is
[1:20:35] the process beginning before the germ
[1:20:41] my point is you can't find it all right
[1:20:44] everybody got that all right then you
[1:20:46] couldn't find the word that was in you
[1:20:51] thank you
[1:20:53] so brother Brandon wouldn't say it when
[1:20:55] I was born into the world there was some
[1:20:57] kind of something displaced down in
[1:20:59] there
[1:21:02] but he said it's just like
[1:21:06] that I was in my father
[1:21:10] he said I was in my grandfather
[1:21:12] he said I was in my great-grandfather
[1:21:15] the DNA now if you can chase it back for
[1:21:18] hundreds of generations
[1:21:24] prove
[1:21:25] and all of those are direct descendants
[1:21:31] all right
[1:21:38] then we must be able to redeem back
[1:21:44] the reward redeemed must go all the way
[1:21:47] back
[1:21:49] past
[1:21:52] once you've had as a human being
[1:21:58] and what would you have before the work
[1:22:06] if you can't find the germ of life for
[1:22:08] the human being and then you keep going
[1:22:10] backwards where are you going
[1:22:12] that's what I said now if you can't go
[1:22:14] you can go that way you talk about it
[1:22:16] that way but can you talk about it going
[1:22:19] backwards
[1:22:24] if you can't then you don't know what
[1:22:26] eternity is
[1:22:27] right
[1:22:29] all right
[1:22:31] so now
[1:22:33] can we get down in a minute we got your
[1:22:34] quotes on down here where you say but
[1:22:37] brother Dale we bypass start theophany
[1:22:43] right
[1:22:44] all right now see by your own technology
[1:22:47] or what would be the word your own
[1:22:50] terminology excuse me
[1:22:53] you're going to try to make it to be
[1:22:55] something
[1:22:58] that when you do you you start the word
[1:23:00] redeeming backwards and you're going to
[1:23:02] clean out of the existence
[1:23:08] and you prove you're wrong
[1:23:12] it's not going to get touchy before we
[1:23:14] get through with it
[1:23:18] because if you can go that away with
[1:23:21] and see the end of it is something
[1:23:23] that's fully redeemed if you can't go
[1:23:25] that far back that way
[1:23:30] you don't know what you're talking about
[1:23:32] well I just believe right now we don't
[1:23:35] have to understand all them things
[1:23:36] you're just too deep
[1:23:39] of heart
[1:23:42] your profit is the one I'm quoting
[1:23:45] why don't you call him deep
[1:23:50] but now are you following me
[1:23:52] we did not become seed
[1:23:55] by the rebirth I agree with that 100 all
[1:23:58] the way down
[1:24:06] you didn't become a son of God
[1:24:10] this is way down the road
[1:24:12] you didn't become a Son of God by the
[1:24:15] new birth
[1:24:22] do you have to always be one
[1:24:25] because that's the only way you could be
[1:24:26] born again
[1:24:33] I want you to think
[1:24:35] I want you to pray you said you're you
[1:24:37] just confusing me well then that gives
[1:24:39] you a chance to pray
[1:24:41] for God to unclog the the things because
[1:24:44] like I've always told you I'm not
[1:24:47] confusing you
[1:24:50] I'm exposing our own confusion
[1:24:54] I said our
[1:24:56] mine as well as yours
[1:25:00] because we've got to get the whole Plan
[1:25:02] of Redemption
[1:25:04] because we were sick there's a reason we
[1:25:07] could be quick
[1:25:11] so you say well now you say you believe
[1:25:13] that we were seed but you but you don't
[1:25:16] believe it was some kind of something
[1:25:18] put there
[1:25:20] why does it have to be put down
[1:25:28] was it in your genealogy coming down
[1:25:33] that something was put there
[1:25:40] how was you in your great grandfather
[1:25:47] it had to be a gene connection
[1:25:49] something you can't see
[1:25:54] right a lot of what they tell you is
[1:25:57] this flat theories you know
[1:26:00] right they can go back so far with their
[1:26:02] machineries and stuff but then after
[1:26:04] they go so far there's this theories of
[1:26:06] this and theories of that
[1:26:08] you know we quoted as being true
[1:26:11] but see this is what I want you to get
[1:26:13] this point and then because I know we
[1:26:15] won't get on Redemption the way I want
[1:26:17] to but looking out number one on your
[1:26:19] notes because this is continue 152 that
[1:26:22] was 152. this is continue on reading
[1:26:24] hold this in your mind
[1:26:28] yeah
[1:26:29] you did not become seed
[1:26:32] by the rebirth
[1:26:34] you were seed and could be born again
[1:26:38] you did not become
[1:26:41] and be careful now remember
[1:26:43] and take the next step redeem means to
[1:26:46] buy back
[1:26:48] it restores to the original owner
[1:26:52] God by his death the shed Blood Bought
[1:26:56] back his own
[1:27:00] don't know if he bought it back
[1:27:03] it meant something that went wrong
[1:27:08] right
[1:27:11] we sold ourselves I hope you get that
[1:27:14] one of these days we God didn't put us
[1:27:16] in a pawn shop
[1:27:18] and then go get us out of the pawn shop
[1:27:22] we put ourselves in the pawn shop
[1:27:27] our representation of our our genetic
[1:27:30] back through time put us into the
[1:27:32] existence that we're in
[1:27:35] Adam and Eve only represented us
[1:27:40] right
[1:27:42] they didn't make me and you do what we
[1:27:44] done
[1:27:46] we've done it cause we wanted to
[1:27:52] right
[1:27:53] I hope that'll down on this one of these
[1:27:55] days the shed Blood Bought back
[1:27:59] his own he bought back the spoken word
[1:28:03] see bright so that meant she was away
[1:28:06] from me
[1:28:10] she was lost
[1:28:13] doomed and on her way to hell and
[1:28:15] deserves every bit of
[1:28:20] but yet it's predestination let him look
[1:28:22] down through didn't you
[1:28:24] and he knew what we'd accept
[1:28:27] see
[1:28:28] you never were a pig or a dog turned
[1:28:32] into a sheep
[1:28:34] now
[1:28:35] see there's you got one
[1:28:38] now you've got about two more where
[1:28:40] brother Branham says that I was a
[1:28:44] Pig turned into a
[1:28:46] the Sheep
[1:28:49] so now what's he doing
[1:28:52] you see contrary to his own quote
[1:28:56] no he's explaining something
[1:29:00] now he's explaining the word word seed
[1:29:07] you never were a pig or a dog turned
[1:29:09] into a sheep that's impossible for every
[1:29:11] kind of Life produces the same kind of
[1:29:14] there is no change in species he's
[1:29:16] taking you all the way back in the word
[1:29:20] redeem
[1:29:23] but we were born of cocoa butter
[1:29:27] you want that quote
[1:29:30] and he said as long as we're in this
[1:29:32] body will be sticky
[1:29:41] I just don't know which one to believe
[1:29:44] why not believe it all right right
[1:29:48] because if you're sticky in your soul
[1:29:51] then you're lost right right
[1:29:55] so inside of you can be eternal life
[1:29:58] beautiful and wonderful
[1:30:00] but your body and spirit is still weak I
[1:30:02] mean still tires
[1:30:05] the new birth never converted our body
[1:30:07] and our spirit
[1:30:10] it only converted to Soul
[1:30:16] all right
[1:30:18] see as we were in the thoughts of God
[1:30:21] and then expressed in flesh there had to
[1:30:24] come a day when we would hear his voice
[1:30:25] the word
[1:30:27] and hearing that voice become aware of
[1:30:30] our father calling us and recognize that
[1:30:33] we are the sons of God
[1:30:36] we've heard his voice and we cried out
[1:30:38] as did The Prodigal Son Save Me Oh My
[1:30:40] Father
[1:30:42] I'm returning to thee
[1:30:46] now look at the next illustration
[1:30:50] a Son of God can go a long time before
[1:30:52] he recognizes it that he's a son and he
[1:30:56] goes and starts explaining about the
[1:30:58] evil
[1:30:59] the
[1:31:01] that you wouldn't you wouldn't the dog
[1:31:05] you wouldn't have picked
[1:31:07] is what God is looking at
[1:31:12] you always was his child
[1:31:14] right that's why you could be born again
[1:31:20] now what's he explaining
[1:31:23] whereas upon the other illustrations
[1:31:25] when you're talking about a wolf and a
[1:31:27] or something like that or a Thistle and
[1:31:30] turned into a wheat he's talking about
[1:31:31] what the bird does
[1:31:36] you know that little eagle
[1:31:40] he wasn't born to chicken
[1:31:44] he thought he was
[1:31:48] but he wasn't born the chicken
[1:31:51] they didn't put a chicken egg under the
[1:31:54] hen and it's hatched out an eagle
[1:32:00] come on
[1:32:02] he said you can go a long time without
[1:32:04] recognizing it
[1:32:08] how many years folks is it taken for
[1:32:12] this message to be preached to us for us
[1:32:14] to recognize and see by the word of God
[1:32:17] who we are
[1:32:20] when we were born again a long time ago
[1:32:25] but we're now recognizing it right
[1:32:27] sister Gail
[1:32:30] recognizing Who We Are
[1:32:33] what we're doing here
[1:32:36] do you think we'll take that the story
[1:32:38] of the eagle said see there
[1:32:41] but remember he wasn't born a chicken
[1:32:44] if he was born the chicken and then
[1:32:46] turned into an eagle you could use the
[1:32:49] illustration
[1:32:51] he was born an eagle
[1:32:55] you just recognized that he wouldn't
[1:32:57] that year was born again
[1:33:02] that old kookaburra turned into a wheat
[1:33:06] an old dog
[1:33:07] turned into it
[1:33:10] a dove
[1:33:12] an old snake that we used to be
[1:33:16] turned into a dove
[1:33:19] because that's what the new birth doing
[1:33:22] but then we'd go a long time
[1:33:26] before we ever realized
[1:33:29] who we really are
[1:33:30] see this message is the only thing that
[1:33:34] can show you who you are
[1:33:36] there is no message no words else can
[1:33:40] show it to you right
[1:33:42] the denominations had all those years
[1:33:45] and even in the great teachings that
[1:33:47] they had and the wonderful things that
[1:33:49] were even true
[1:33:52] today stand up and say
[1:33:54] I am
[1:33:55] let's see if you'll swallowing this
[1:33:58] could any of them stand up and even how
[1:34:00] many in this message could make this
[1:34:02] statement
[1:34:03] I am not
[1:34:06] a son of God
[1:34:12] that's only my title right
[1:34:15] for you to reference too all right see I
[1:34:18] say things ahead of time see how you'll
[1:34:19] relax you know I give amens out of it
[1:34:22] and then I get old knees when you really
[1:34:23] get down to what I'm talking about but
[1:34:25] one of these days you'll learn that
[1:34:28] but you see
[1:34:33] I am not
[1:34:34] the child the son oh
[1:34:38] Sam and Hannah Dale
[1:34:44] and we're not denying our natural birth
[1:34:46] right come on
[1:34:49] don't be silly
[1:34:52] run around and wouldn't denying he was
[1:34:54] William were flatter them he wouldn't
[1:34:56] William no more
[1:34:57] well what do you call himself he might
[1:34:59] not have lived too long after then
[1:35:01] because that was the 12-12 that's in
[1:35:03] December the 12th and he had to wreck
[1:35:05] about the 21 20th 18th 20th or something
[1:35:09] I guess the rest of them days he said
[1:35:12] my name is swordsman I'm not William
[1:35:15] Brown
[1:35:16] well brother Brown I'm not brother
[1:35:18] Brandon
[1:35:20] no no no I'm not brother Brandon I don't
[1:35:23] find out who I am well who are you I
[1:35:26] can't tell you
[1:35:28] I'm not with you no no he went right on
[1:35:31] it's like I've always said to you about
[1:35:33] the Lord Jesus run around and said to
[1:35:36] the Lord Jesus never call Mary his
[1:35:38] mother right right
[1:35:40] would you think that I would be calling
[1:35:42] him a liar to say that when he was a
[1:35:45] baby going in a cradle he'd look up and
[1:35:47] say
[1:35:52] who are you
[1:35:53] no he said Mama
[1:36:00] come on
[1:36:03] probably the day he died he said
[1:36:06] but right for him he said Mama
[1:36:08] I gotta hope you do
[1:36:10] you do it oh no brother damn he never
[1:36:13] called her mother
[1:36:15] no he didn't he never gave her the
[1:36:18] signification of showing that she was
[1:36:21] his
[1:36:21] God
[1:36:25] but he always gave honor and respect to
[1:36:28] her his life staying on the cross was
[1:36:31] what
[1:36:35] John
[1:36:37] he holds your mother
[1:36:39] take care of her
[1:36:41] right
[1:36:43] see we get all these great doctrines
[1:36:46] that we think are so wonderful
[1:36:50] I believe her brother Randall was here
[1:36:51] today I'm screaming the amen
[1:36:53] when he said he never called her mother
[1:36:55] he's meaning he never gave her
[1:36:58] the place our position to be his mother
[1:37:01] in the the point of something
[1:37:04] Supernatural
[1:37:06] but he honored her every day
[1:37:09] with the fact of who she was
[1:37:13] but he never made her higher than him
[1:37:17] because if she was his mother
[1:37:20] she would have been greater than him a
[1:37:22] mother is greater than a son
[1:37:25] we never gave her the the point of
[1:37:28] showing that she was his mother that way
[1:37:31] but she was his mama
[1:37:36] she brought him into the world she
[1:37:38] nourished him
[1:37:40] yeah that's where we think we know what
[1:37:42] we're talking about
[1:37:45] a son can go a long time
[1:37:48] before he recognizes who he is
[1:37:53] I've been in this message 40 something
[1:37:55] years you know what I'm just now
[1:37:56] beginning to realize as I am
[1:38:05] about 1971 if I'd have said that I'm not
[1:38:09] a son of God you'd have looked at me
[1:38:10] real hard wouldn't you you see brother
[1:38:13] Mo I think we better talk this over
[1:38:15] because I think brother Dale's getting
[1:38:18] lost in just a little bit there you know
[1:38:19] because he's now saying that he's not a
[1:38:22] son of God
[1:38:25] he's saying he's gone
[1:38:28] what
[1:38:33] what's wrong
[1:38:35] Jesus you agree with it this morning
[1:38:39] this was God made manifest
[1:38:42] called a son
[1:38:46] but he wasn't a son because the son has
[1:38:49] a beginning
[1:38:52] that eternal life inside of him never
[1:38:55] had a beginning right amen
[1:38:59] that eternal life in you makes you what
[1:39:03] people call the son of God right because
[1:39:05] you're God in another form but it's what
[1:39:07] you are you almighty God
[1:39:11] where his offspring
[1:39:15] the difference between us and him and
[1:39:17] the bases of coming we can look back
[1:39:20] down through our great granddaddies and
[1:39:21] things and find things we don't like
[1:39:23] because that's DNA
[1:39:26] but you don't have anything about my
[1:39:28] father I don't like
[1:39:30] it
[1:39:32] you know Paul said he came to him one
[1:39:34] day and heard him pray and said Papa
[1:39:41] get come to the place with God to him
[1:39:43] was his papa
[1:39:47] and you know what God had come to the
[1:39:50] place that that was not just his son
[1:39:52] standing there
[1:39:54] but that he was standing there in
[1:39:56] another body
[1:40:01] and that would connect us to it
[1:40:05] see where his offspring
[1:40:08] we are the children of God right the
[1:40:11] children of God as God made manifest in
[1:40:14] another form I thought we believe that's
[1:40:15] what the bride was
[1:40:18] that she was the amorphy of God
[1:40:22] I thought we believe that's the way that
[1:40:24] it don't turn out to be Trinity
[1:40:25] sometimes
[1:40:26] how that God can manifest himself in
[1:40:29] many forms
[1:40:32] but it's the same God
[1:40:36] we want to hold on to the Eternal son
[1:40:40] there's no such thing
[1:40:43] there's not an eternal sun today if
[1:40:46] Jesus wasn't Eternal something we can't
[1:40:48] be an eternal son
[1:40:50] we can be the children of God that are
[1:40:54] Eternal yes
[1:40:55] and we can call them ourselves sons and
[1:40:57] daughters
[1:40:59] and he's proud to do that
[1:41:02] because we're his children
[1:41:06] but he looks down and sees his own life
[1:41:10] but like I told you now I'm I'm stopping
[1:41:12] here because I can't go no further with
[1:41:13] these notes
[1:41:15] like I told you
[1:41:18] if Adam was away most people thinks he
[1:41:20] was
[1:41:21] then God created a body
[1:41:25] in a spirit and put his own soul into
[1:41:28] Adam
[1:41:30] and that'd make him God he wouldn't be
[1:41:33] at him
[1:41:36] no
[1:41:37] God made brother Brown said Blasphemous
[1:41:40] names Adam a moving leaving human being
[1:41:45] he made him a body of spirit and soul
[1:41:51] then he put eternal life in his soul
[1:41:55] that didn't make him God that made him
[1:41:58] Adam
[1:42:00] but you know who he was
[1:42:02] he was the son of God he was a little
[1:42:05] God
[1:42:08] it was God standing there in flesh but
[1:42:12] connected to a soul of a human being
[1:42:14] that God had created
[1:42:16] yeah man
[1:42:18] that's the wonderful story of redemption
[1:42:24] if there is something about us that can
[1:42:27] be redeemed
[1:42:31] because it means that it was there to
[1:42:33] begin with
[1:42:38] they think on these things
[1:42:41] sit back and use I call it what is that
[1:42:44] word I use I call it the law of
[1:42:49] elimination
[1:42:51] thank you somebody said it
[1:42:54] so I look at something from the law of
[1:42:56] elimination
[1:42:59] if I say something that doesn't work
[1:43:02] I just eliminate
[1:43:05] lemonade you know
[1:43:07] if I look into the Bible and I see
[1:43:09] something that exalts me and you as
[1:43:12] human beings
[1:43:14] I eliminate that
[1:43:18] but yet when I look at the Bible and I
[1:43:20] see that the Bible is showing me that I
[1:43:23] am
[1:43:24] God made manifest
[1:43:28] call the Sun
[1:43:30] I want to accept my position
[1:43:35] but you say well brother they'll look
[1:43:36] like the dirty part now listen I'm not
[1:43:39] talking about somebody that's living in
[1:43:41] sin now
[1:43:47] that's not what I'm talking about
[1:43:50] it's some kind of a sinful person that's
[1:43:52] coming up telling me look boy bless God
[1:43:54] I'm god well that when you start saying
[1:43:57] it like that you know the man don't know
[1:43:58] what the world he's talking about
[1:44:01] but if a person says God has made me
[1:44:04] this
[1:44:05] and I want to live the life that I can
[1:44:09] I want to walk that I can I want to talk
[1:44:12] the things I can
[1:44:17] I want to be what he wants me to be
[1:44:20] about you
[1:44:21] I want to exalt him not myself
[1:44:26] I want to live
[1:44:28] come on musician yeah
[1:44:31] he wants me to live
[1:44:34] I want to give
[1:44:37] until there's just no more to give I
[1:44:43] want to love love you do wrong brother

[1:46:04] emotions me
