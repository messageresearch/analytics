heart to the people today lord lord we commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen psalm 16 begin at verse 8 and it says i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand i shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also shall rest in hope for thou will not leave thy soul and my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thine holy one to seek corruption that will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore amen we're gonna go to matthew chapter six and we begin it verse 22 and it says the light of the body is the eye if therefore that eye be single the whole body is full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness amen god bless you tonight you may be seated and here then give you a little definitions here definition for the word focus it says the main or central part of something especially of attention or interest to adapt to the prevailing level of light and become able to see clearly and it says to cause light to come together at a point and so that's the that's the focus and and the message look this is from 1963 brother rams speaking of shooting his gun he was trying to trying to get his target set and he was shooting and he couldn't get it to line up the way he wanted to because he could drive tax and all of a sudden he couldn't and you know he's talking about he talked to the winchester people and it says he says now if i look to what the winchester company said which is supposed to be that that made the gun then i'd have listened to them but i know different because he had seen that because he had been able to shoot drive tax at 50 yards with that gun and then they were saying you could only make a one-inch things one inch circle at 25 yards is the best you could get out of it and he said well i know i've done better because i've shot the gun he said now if i look to the church and they say oh my days those days are gone them days is gone and there's no such thing as that and see see where where you'd be it'd be plumb off target but if he is ever god he is still god he always was god and he can't be nothing else but god and he is god eternal therefore we want to look to that target not what target the church is shooting at but what target that christ is shooting at he said we look for christ to appear the same jesus he said when he was on the earth a little while in the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for i'll be with you to the end of the world that same one who could direct the word and be the word and direct it right straight onto the target that same lord jesus is here this morning in the form of the holy ghost to direct our thoughts and focus down his word to one true and living god to one purpose to one achievement and if we'll just let him do it he will focus the word right into a place that'll prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever depends on what you want to look at he said we must focus our lives not what somebody else says but focus our lives to him and he is the word see and if we get our lives lined with the word then the word in our life becomes the same he said if you abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will it'll be granted to you verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you have seen oh my not what i said what you said you can have because you and he become the same because the mind that was in christ is in you and the mind that was in christ was to fulfill the father's word which he was the word there you are then you and the word are focused in together you become a living unit of god how great so i i want to speak on this tonight and i the one the one scripture when i was thinking about this the one scripture that come to my mind was paul i'm sorry it was david and he said i've set the lord always before me and you know that was that was the first thing when you're speaking of a target when you're focusing on something that's what that's what come to mind i've always set the lord before me and that's the main that's the main focus brother graham said he's the prince brothers he's the principal theme of the bible of the word and he said if you can't see christ in every verse he said then go back and read it again because you've missed it and so this this is the principle theme of our lives there's nothing greater and so when we look you know i i have it i have a desire you know you know we we we live in such a late hour and we see the condition that everything's in but you know paul said that we we are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses that's right when we see the what the the great heroes of faith that that paul wrote about and and he wrote about all the great things that that they had done and when he went through all of that and he got finished and then he stood there and said yeah they without us cannot be made perfect so you know it it behooves us to understand the day and the hour which we live the scripture tells us he said that we ought to give a more earnest heed to the words which we've hurt and so we understand that the day and the hour that we live in that we need to focus because to in the day and hour it to scatter your mind it's to scatter your focus it's it's for not to have have your vision but you know thank god we've been given uh the lens of the word and you know to help us focus because you know it take it takes light to see you know if you want you know if we turned out all the lights in here today and it was complete pitch black you know what you wouldn't be focusing on anything there's there's no way to focus so it takes light to focus on something and if you have light then you know all it takes is just one little glimmer of light in absolute darkness and you have something to focus on it catches your attention and you know what what a great day and hour that we live in because we've had the full light come you know they down through the down through time you know the through the dark ages and you know the they had very little light but you know they held on to the light that they had and you know when because we understand that that it was that through the time the seed was to go into the ground but you know if the seed went into the ground but there was a time for a harvest the seed would come back and you know what we and and we see luther had his had his day when you know it started to have a little bit more light and it was a little bit more liked but thank god we live in the in the and because it's the great and terrible day it's it's a great day of absolute light but it's a day of absolute darkness we live in we live in a world of contrast that that you see all of the the light and the darkness and jesus is speaking of the of the pharisees and he's speaking to him and and he says and he's speaking he says the light of the body is the eye so when he's speaking to the disciples talking about them he said you know if your eye be single he said then the whole body shall be full of light so if you if you have a focus on something he said then he said then then the body's full of light because you see what what to see to bring the light in to see the light but and in contrast he said but if thou be evil see you can only have one only have one uh source of light you know brother brown was speaking of eve and and you know he was talking about being in the garden of eden and you know he said she thought there was more than one way he you know she thought there was more than one way that that things could take place and you know and she had our own idea because she listened to the serpent but you know it brought death there was only one way that was going to come and you can't have but one way and the in and and the day and the hour that we live in we see so many people and and there's a is a great darkness upon the earth upon the upon the world but you know there's great light but the problem is is when people hold on to hold on to darkness and they claim it to be liked or when you've had light and you don't continue on in the light well you know he said but if we walk in the light as he is in the light but if you don't walk in the light anymore he said how great is that darkness because you know that light can be darkness because you can walk up to a certain point and then you quit then how how great is that darkness so we see the the great and dreadful time that we live in that that are the things that have had that is happening today and you know the the person that comes to my mind when when i was looking at this is you know there was a a a man the scripture tells us about and this is this is the from the message leadership and i quote and brother i'm talking about he said he's speaking of the rich young ruler he said this man when he come down the re the young ruler we talked about all religious and belong to church and everything fine educated a fine businessman and everything when he come to the end of the road he began to scream there's nowhere to step he said where's his leadership he had been led by his church which is dead he had been led by the dead world and there's not wasn't nothing for him to step into but what the world had prepared for it hail now you know nothing think of think of this young man you know he had had a great life and he had a great desire and and here he was he was walking and and he come to jesus because he saw he saw how who jesus was there was something that caught his attention and so he came to jesus one day and he said good master he said what is it that i must do to inherit eternal life and so he come to jesus he saw the condition that he was in and he saw who jesus was and he saw that there was something that he needed and so he came he came to jesus to get what he needed and so something drew him there and then when jesus began to speak to him he said well follow the commandments he said he said well lord i've done this since since my birth he said all my childhood i've lived the law he said i've done everything i was supposed to do he said i've done everything and i've lived a perfect life you know because whatever the law said i've lived it just as close and done everything that i could and you know jesus loved him because there was something about him that he was sincere about there was insincerity that he had and jesus saw the kind of person that he was and looking upon him the bible says that jesus loved him but told him he said he said son he said you've got one problem he said now you need to give up everything that you own you need to sell everything get rid of all of this and he said and come and follow me he said so he had an opportunity to walk in front of of the lord and and ask what he had need of and the lord told him he got his answer before the lord what he needed and the lord told him and he walked away the scripture said he turned away because and he was very sorrowful because he had great possessions and he decided to walk away now you know there's no place in the scripture now if you find it you let me know but i can't find one place in the scripture that said that he ever walked away and he quit following the commandments there was no place where he quit going to the synagogue and he quit playing his ties and all of the other things that he had done all the way he was just the same kind of because the scripture tells us and brother i'm talking about he lived the same kind of religious life he still lived as a law to the t he done the exact same thing but you know what he had already cut himself off he'd already sent away his day of grace but he stood there and lived the same kind of life just as religious as he ever was he done the exact same thing why because there was there was his focus his point to look at and it said he said come and get rid of all these things and come follow me but you know what he couldn't do that and so here he is he sells he he sells off the lord jesus he could have sold his he could have sold his earthly possessions and took the lord but you know what he he valued all of the things of this earth or this world more than he did the lord jesus he valued this more when the scripture tells us later on that he that he grew and had so much gain that he had to tear down his barns and build bigger to hold it all no no no no but he was still religious he still walked a religious life he's still done all the things yet he's already cut off and then we see later on in the scripture you know then then he had his then he said well so just take your ease because you know look at all the blessings that you've got he come to place well look look at all the things that i've got i'm just i'm just so full and and blessed and everything i don't have to worry about anything but you know what he did not take into account that one day that he would have to give an account for his soul and what was it where was the place there was no place bound for him to stand there was no place found for him and there he is standing and all these things and there was not one thing that he could find that he could hold on to there would well because his riches wouldn't do him any good and everything else that he had done in his life wouldn't do him one bit of good no matter how religious you live you can live a religious life and you don't and just follow because you know as as brother donny reagan said one time he said the message has produced more thou shalt nights than the law of moses ever could and he said what do we do we have people they don't mind living living a life why because while they think they think that they're gonna they're gonna just walk and do all these things but works will never get you in works will never get you anywhere works will never never god god is not god is not pleased with all your works god's not impressed with all your works but you know one thing that god is wanting he's wanting somebody that'll take him by faith and follow him when they sell out everything else when there's nothing else that'll hold you but him i don't i don't want anything because that's that song that that man was that uh i'll stand for jesus and let the world go by amen you know i don't want to own one thing that i can't leave behind he said i want to be free to sell through the sky that's why i'm walking with jesus i'm let the world go by i don't want anything to hold me back why because you know there's too many things it's too late of an hour it's too close for us to give up now it's too close you know can you can you imagine i was thinking about this day can you imagine caleb and joshua when they went into that land and they got the promise they got the evidence of the promise given to them and they went into that land and they saw what their inheritance was and they brought back the cluster of grapes and all the all the other things and brought back it brought back the evidence brought back the report their testimony was to that they could take that land and they had seen what was in there and he had a vision caleb had a vision of what his land was or what his what his mountain was when he laid eyes on it and you know he never lost that vision he never changed from that no matter what he got hold and he got stoop-shouldered and he got gray-headed and everything else you know he never lost his vision of what was his he never gave up on that when he told joshua he said you know he said i've waited 40 years on this he said i was 45 when i went in he said i'm 85 he said i'm just as strong as i was then and he said this is my land he said give me my mountain you know he had to walk all that time and had that vision and all that time you know what he was ready to go in and take his land can you imagine every day waking up and he was out there sharpening his sword why because he was ready for a battle god had given him something and you know what he sharpened his sword he's right i don't know when i'm gonna go in there but i'm gonna take it he was ready to go one because it's like well you you know caleb you're starting to stoop over a little bit you're starting to get a little bit slower that's all right when i get there i'll take care of business it didn't slow him down any but you know he was ready to go all that time and watching all of those people listen as brother preached those 10 line preachers had to listen to them them can you imagine having to sit and listen to them people haven't listened to them people get up and say that and it's like and that you know and joshua and caleb got up before all the people said and tried to steal the people and tell them listen don't listen to them where god has given it to us and of all the things that god has brought us through to this point he's more than able to bring us in you know he had to sit there and watch all of those men that had give a bad report had a had a terrible testimony of what they had seen and then when they brought the evidence back to the children of israel and it sat right in front of them and they saw no no how many how many times have you seen grapes that it takes two people to carry here they hear these great big cluster grapes that they had to bring over from the other side it's like this is what's there no no everybody's standing there in awe wow look at this they're amazed at what they're looking at but we can't do we can't go in there because their testimony was we look like grasshoppers and they're psyched that was their testimony that's what they saw not what caleb said and it's like well were you there i was were you there were you there i was there i know what i'm talking about no they didn't they but they wouldn't but they wouldn't listen and here's caleb and can you imagine having to walk through the desert and you have to put up with all these people and watching them die one by one and thinking well you know what the more these people die the closer we're getting that's right when jesus when the lord told joshua and you know and he went and told him he said listen he said he said your children he said you say that we would be a prey in there he said but they're going to raise up and take that land he said but your carcasses will rot in the wilderness your carcasses will rot in the wilderness and there was caleb standing there watching those people drop off like flies and just like and he was out there talking to young folks after sharpening that sword let me tell you what i saw let me tell you what jehovah said it's like well you know what y'all can y'all can rot over here if you want to but i got a promise over there he never lost his vision of what he saw and and so it's it's us we have to we have to keep our vision second corinthians 4 i love this he says verse 16 says for which cause we fake not but through our outward man perish though our outward man perish yet in the inner man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so we see you know the things because caleb had his eyes on something that was beyond what they could see he had experienced something and you know and many times you hear people they get up and they they talk about things and you know what it's something that they've never experienced you know how can how can you judge something if you've never experienced it for yourself many people you know they say well the holy ghost is not real or brother branham's all right how do you know you know what i tell you until you've experienced for yourself how can you judge these things why because if you're just living off of a carnal reality a carnal thought how do you know if you've never put god to the test how do you know what god can do if you've never trusted him god how do you know what god can do no because aunt susie said something or some preacher somewhere said something no you need to find out for yourself you need to prove god for yourself you need to experience it for yourself it's a personal revelation it's a personal experience you can't you can't get on somebody else just because brother dale might have had the virtues and and all these different things you know what it ain't it don't mean that anybody else has them it doesn't matter you know because you know what we're not going to get in because brother dale's got to get me in pass he ain't going to get you in mama ain't going to get you in daddy ain't going to get you in you got to have experience for yourself you've got to have a token you've got to have you've got to have a general a genuine experience with jesus christ for yourself you got to know it for yourself you've got to know beyond a shadow of a doubt not waiting on somebody else we can't we can't have just it it just it's got to be real you just can't play church it's got to be real and i i want i want to know that i know that i know that i know i want to know i can't get any people people ask you know do you think this person has the holy ghost do you think that person has the holy ghost do you think this person you know what i i'm not worried about whether everybody else i won't know if i got it there ain't no i you know because you know what even if because you know if i did know who did and did not have the holy ghost you know what that doesn't mean that i've got it that don't mean it's going to get me in but you got to know for yourself if people spent less time worried about what everybody else has gotten worried about themselves you got to know for yourself but you know we we can play church many people they they've got they've got their their religious walk down path they got all of their religious sayings and all of the all of the i heard brother homer say years ago you know he said i was baptized he said i do all the baptist lingo he said he said because you talk to somebody that's a baptist you know a baptist you know what you know because you know what kind of person they are you know all these different things and so you you go through all you know and you know just like just like the the uh the pharisees you know jesus out there talking to them and here they are the religious leaders of the day now if you want to talk about somebody that knew the word they knew the word they spent all their life knowing it and if you want to talk about something that was written they knew it they had all the lines memorized and every little thing that they were walking down the street everything that they were supposed to do here jesus out there talking about said y'all spend all your time tithing on every little minute little bit of spice or all these kind of things and he said you've missed the weight of your matters of the law he said he said here you here you are out arguing over these things and you know trying to trying to get people to look at you and not realize what what the actually the real part of the law was he said he said oh we we have abraham to our father here here we are where we know we note the law he said well if you knew abraham rejoiced to see my day [Music] abraham rejoice to see this day and hear you are out trying to kill me how do you actually rejoice he said he said you're not you're not abraham's not your father he said your father's the devil he said he said because he said he said the works that your your father does he said you'll do also he said he said your father's well here he said y'all out clean in the tombs and honoring all these dead prophets and he said your fathers are the ones that put them there well because they didn't agree with what the prophets had to say but when it came to pass then you turned around and went out there and out there polishing oh what a wonderful prophet he was and yet when when the truth came and it stood there and rebuked the people for what they believed and what they had done then you know what they were ready to kill them well here's here's jesus and in john 15 22 jesus was speaking to the disciples and he said speaking of the pharisees he said if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin so when when he began to speak see he began to point out the problems that they had of what what they because they walked in a way that they thought was self because it was self-righteous because they thought they had the law understood they thought they had the law memorized and everything worked out just fine until jesus come and started pointing these things out to the way they followed the word when he began to say this is because i am the fulfillment of the word here it searches the scripture and when he begins to speak to them all the ways that they had done and then when when he began to say these are these are the full this is the fulfillment of the word and he began to point them back and every time they pointed them back then they realized you know what they didn't have a place to stand he began to tear down their doctrines and then when he began to do that then they wanted to kill him but you know he that's but that's what he come to do he become because he was the fulfillment of the word so he came to make the the law manifest to make the word manifest and when he began to do that one because people didn't see that one because they didn't focus on what the scripture said they had their focus on what the law meant to them and brother speaking here he said you know it's us we got to focus on the word not on ourselves here's this is from the masterpiece brother brown says he said so we realize that we're here in a negative form and he says as long as there is a negative there has to be a positive there cannot be a negative without a positive see because because it's because of the positive that makes the negative like you had a negative picture of some object there has to be an object somewhere or to strike the light strike that lens or there wouldn't be any negative so when we see that our life here is in the negative and knowing that we're in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there is a positive somewhere that the light has struck and it's reflected something here on earth and he said and we are we are only that reflection the genuine object is some somewhere if that isn't he said i'm the worst deceived man in the world i've spent my life in vain but i know beyond the shadow of a doubt amen that is there see that's why we're here see so we see that he's speaking of this of the object in the lens and you know in physics they have a if you shine a light through a lens and it's called the principal focus and when that light goes through that that lens there is one place and that was the reason i read that uh definition because when it goes through that lens then all of the light is reflected into one spot so we see it it narrows down and it's called the principal focus and it doesn't matter where that light comes from when it shines through the light it points back to one spot and so you know then we're living here in the negative but there's a but our life here is pointing us back to something so what is it what is it that when we say the the light say all the light here that is shining is like in physics when it's shining through the lens so when it's shining through the lens of the word you know you know the the scripture tells us he said the the letter killeth but the spirit gives life so many times what we've we've read many things in the scripture we've read many things in the scripture how many times have you read things over and over and over and it doesn't mean anything to you but it takes one time why because it's not just it's not just reading the word but it takes the light on the word when the light strikes the word then you can see these things you but you walk in darkness you know as as paul said you know we see through a glass darkly you walk in in the light that you have but you begin to see these things but what is it every time you see that principle light if that light doesn't strike and you don't see jesus christ in that then you know what that light is not the the lens or something there's a problem somewhere because you know what if the holy ghost is shining the light on the word then it'll show you jesus christ every time you're not going to see something different it's going to show you the light and it's going to illuminate something well you know what it's not it's not going to shine it's not always shining so brightly that you see everything but you know there's a part that you have to see and that you hold on to and then you just keep walking and then the light becomes more you know here's here's the disciples walking with jesus and jesus begins to speak to him and he begins to speak to him and they didn't always understand what he was saying but he'd be but he what did he tell peter and then he said but you'll understand this later and he began to speak to but you hold on to that even after all the things that he was raised and they're out there and and i can't remember who it was but was reading the scripture in acts but you know there you see their word they're reading in uh acts 1 and they come to jesus and ask him are you going to raise up your kingdom at this time after all that he had done and preached to them and tried to explain these things to people and they still didn't understand him and you know and many times people people you know you hold on to what you have you know i won't i want to give a little bit of a testimony tonight and um brother white was talking about a brother that he's a preacher that was uh had some different ideas about some about the about about the statue of a perfect man and i can can i can i i want to give a a testimony tonight uh because if you've seen what that the the brother had wrote some of you probably haven't but i'll i'll just give you a brief explanation of it because you know i want to tell you i won't tell you not that's the way i saw it for a long time that's what i saw and let me tell you something you know why because you know you can only glean from a lot from the light that you get but i i want to i told somebody one time i was talking about what i understood about the message you know i you know because you see the condition that people are in because you know what when you walked in a mile in somebody's shoes you know what you know where people are coming from i told somebody one time i said you could take everything that i knew about this message double it put it on the top of a pen the head of a pen roll it around for a million years and they'd never touch each other that kind of that gives you an idea i do thank the lord but you know what it takes holding on you know everybody said brother dale always said he said don't go to lulu i said you'll get confused no you'll find out you're already confused well you know what i was confused i was confused as a day is long but you know what i held onto what i believed i knew what brother branham said but i didn't see it all but you know what i held on to it i knew what brother branham said i didn't see it you know only on the hearing the stage of a perfect man we know brother bram said here is is the new birth that's right i'm going to read this i just i just feel like i i just want to read this because if nobody's ever read it i want to read it tonight i know brother wade is quoted and but i just want to read this is from this is from 1962 brother rem says in the statute of pokemon he said notice you must be born again he said when you're born again you cannot you can't be born again without having faith this is number number nine brother anderson or whoever's in the back you want to pull it up he said that's right you see on my chart here i've got the very foundation faith is the foundation of it all for without faith it's impossible to please god he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him see he must be and when you're a skeptic of the bible when you're a skeptic of the word being right he said you just might as well stay back until you first first you believe it he said what is sin unbelief he said there's only two elements that control the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have how high you can rise and then brother brandon continues on here this is from uh this is paragraph 138 he says he said and that's what we're supposed to do reflect the son of god now we're supposed to do his work he said he that believeth on me saint john 14 7 says he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also you're beginning to reflect the works of christ he said but so many of us try to do the works of christ before the reflection of christ is in us where'd they get to now there's the trouble we find those things happening you you know it i know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heaps of ministers of christians piled along the road it's because they didn't go in it right and that's why i'm here this morning to try to teach this little church and myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the living god how many like to be that amen he said the dwelling place of the living god he said now here is what we do what's the first thing have faith and be born again he said that's laying the foundation then after we lay the foundation secondly you add to your foundation add to your faith peter said here add to your faith first you have faith then you add virtue to your faith this is the next column next pour into foundation faith then your faith advert you now right there knocks a lot of us down yes sir advert you to your faith that doesn't just mean living a virgin life you know like the woman or man so forth that doesn't have anything to do with that but i just wanted to read that because we we quote that a lot of times but you know you can read things but until the light strikes it and it comes open to you it's dead letter you're walking around in darkness but you know what i thank god because it takes time because there's a day and an hour when the light strikes it and you catch the folk your focus point that point becomes open to you that you can reflect you see that and then you continue on brother branham talks about the man that he was walking and he pre he was preaching there in kentucky and the man was there and he didn't understand brother branham he didn't really agree with him or anything like that brother brandon was speaking to him and he said brother he said where do you live he said i live up over the mountain he said how are you going to get home he said well i'ma walk this path he said can you see your home from here he said all you can see is this path can you say no but i know where it's at he said how do you get there he said well i got this lantern he said well is the land can you see your house with from here with that lantern no he said but i can see the path he said because he said so what are we doing he said well i just walk in the light in the pathway that's there i just walked with the light he said brother that's the same way with a christian experience he said you don't see it all but he said but that light is shining and he said you walk in the path that lays down far in front of you and he said if we walk in the light as his in the light then we have fellowship one with another so then we have to walk in the light that's in front of us so if we walk in this then you know we see the things that we that we see and we wonder why we have the experience that we have why because it makes us into who we are because you've got to overcome the things that you've had to overcome and builds the character into you that's the reason you know we don't we we wish we had a flowery bed of ease we wish that we had all the answers but you know what that ain't the way it's going to happen sometimes life just felt like you're riding around in a well in the washing machine you don't even know which way you're going but you know the thing is is when things get old topsy-turvy you know what you just realize god's still in control god's still leading you so god is still moving why because if we have our focus on him that he's going to lead us all the way but you know and and so my my understanding was this if you want to know why people don't people don't preach the statue of a perfect man there's a lot of things people don't preach let me tell you i've heard i've heard a lot of sugar tit doctrines i've heard a lot of sugar tent preaching well it's true well you know because you know i told somebody the other day i was talking and i said you know can you imagine if somebody that you love or you or your your sweetheart or your wife or somebody you know when y'all were dating according you know somebody write you know she writes you a letter and it's this long page of all of these words but you know somebody only gives you four words out of that letter and give it to you then you try to understand what she was writing to you here's here you get four words and she wrote this long letter the the brown now tell me what she said tell me but that's the way it is if you don't if you only get just a piece here and a piece there how are you supposed to know the mind of god if you're just getting little divots here and a little crumb here and a little crumb there how you spell you know if you had this great great queen's feast that was spread before you and they gave you four little crumbs what do you think of that well that's a taste ain't it what's the same way people people just you know you you just get a little a little snip here and a little snip there how are you supposed to understand people walk around in darkness there you know because there's such confusion but see that's the reason that brother rahm said it was so necessary it is so needful for teaching you've got to be positionally placed and so when you when you catch a little snippet here and a little snippet there you know you just try to put it together and no wonder people end up with a cowling tree eating grass why because you you you gather what you can but you know going going back to the chart here you know this is what i understood now and but but i want to show you if you your focus now if you can i want you to understand look at focus not not focused but i don't want you to think of the word focus but you know when you know i always understood this now this is this way i was this way i was i was from one from having not heard anybody really preach on this you're just catching snippets here and there trying to put things together so this is what i put together and you know and honestly you read the message and until the lord comes and touches you and it opens it to your eyes you're blind this was justification you're justified at faith this is sanctification here's the baptism holy ghost no that's what the brother had in the chart now the only thing that was different that from what i believed than what he wrote in that in his in his video is that he put the holy spirit all of this together now i want to show you something what the lord puts things he shows you things and he puts things you have questions you wonder why you get questions in your life it's because god will makes you sit on it and stew and simmer on it for a while chew on it a while that's right but here's here's faith and then here's so this is justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost so when you come to the holy ghost well then i always believe there's one thing is there there was a growth development well that was the capstone you had to grow because there was more that had to be done because you know brother ramsay said you know as newborn babes the bible says as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word so you know what you come up as a child you're a baby but you got to grow well you know what so here's here's here's the message this is the end time message it's the capstone that's what brother adam's message is the capstone but you know so i was i i looked at that and and so well there's there's justification sanctification the baptism the holy ghost there's the end time message but you know i got to reading one day and i got to thinking about something and and now something that struck me and i never could put it together because i just saw i was telling brother dawn the other day i said i could see there was a difference between the apostles and the 120 in the upper room and the 3000 outside and i was like now put that in that chart the way that i saw it the apostles didn't have the end time message so then if that's the way it goes then you're putting all of us at the headstone here at the top and i was like well that don't make any sense now how does this work but i've seen justification i could see sanctification but i could but see your focus is out and one day i was talking to pop by the day i was talking and you know all of a sudden it just started all of a sudden the clear i was like oh i saw that when he said when he started because he was one quoting what brother branham said like you know wow let's just listen to what the prophet has to say you know what amazing if we just pull out the plugs out of our ears but all of a sudden here you see this is this is your born-again experience here then all of a sudden i could see then then i knew what what struck me was i could see that because what the clarity was here's where the apostles were here's the 3000 outside so when you see here and then you see here's the capstone see here's here's jesus christ and when brother branham come to preach the message he had to bring the capstone the end time revelation so then you saw oh well here's here's where they were at but here we are then you understand yeah this is sanctification you've got you've got justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost here that is the new birth you do but this is sanctification also this is a daily sanctification that paul told you're still going up the statue of a perfect man because you're sanctified as these virtues are being added in well then when when somebody said well this is sanctification but it's the second stage when you begin to well you know what that makes absolute sense but you know what mike but you know i didn't it was like well i didn't i don't see that no but i saw a part of that right but you know it takes a little bit of understanding why why is it so important to have god god called me in that preach the word to open your because you know what you can walk around and if you think if you think you're gonna get it all by yourself and you're a one-man show you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps let me tell you what you're totally absolutely wrong you're not ever going to get it by yourself because god called a fivefold ministry to preach and you know not every man and you know i'll there's a there's a i thank god i had some wonderful men that that have helped me over the over the years but you know not every man who stands behind the pulpits called to be behind the pulpit and you know and not every not every man that's behind the pulpit has the same level but you know you've got but you've got to hold on to what god shows you and then all of a sudden when i began to see that you know amen it makes it makes perfect sense and i you know because you see that you know i always love the statue of a perfect man because you know that you see that's jesus christ that's that's the manifestation that's the stature of jesus christ in a human in a christian a believer that's the most god being molded into a person but you know what it takes it takes a revelation it takes god bringing you there and how are you and if you if you don't have have understanding if you don't have a preacher if you don't have somebody that can lead you up there you know that's the reason that you know peter was out there preaching he said you know he said because if you like these things but he said but he said if you understand that you have these things he said you're not going to be unfruitful but you've got to understand these things and praise god that that he has opened these things up that we've been able to see them because you know i tell you what i i look back on my life sometimes and and think of all the things that that i've heard you know i heard the first time i ever heard anybody preach that jesus wasn't god until the river jordan yeah i remember i remember that it stuck in my crawl it was something you just i did i i told the lord i was sitting there the man was preaching it and i sat there in the church and i told the lord i was praying and say if that's truth you'll have to reveal that to me because they don't make any sense to me i said because you know even even when when i'd even one little bit of understanding that i have i said that still don't make any sense to me and i know i don't know i don't know i know i don't know a lot but i know that don't make any but you know there's people they just swallow that up hook line and secret jump up and praise the lord and scream and shout and everything like that it's like how is that you know it blows me it blows my mind and you know because you got people and people don't realize this but they got people out there and they're saying well i'm eternal i come in here with this eternal seed from god from the foundation of the world that was painted inside of me and you know what they got jesus coming just as a man and here they are saying i come from the mind of god and i'm eternal and he's just a man he just come as flesh and he's the one that fulfilled the word that was prophesied in the beginning in genesis when when the fall happened and again god come in the garden and talk to adam and eve and told them he's the one that was prophesied to come you know and so let me i'm gonna preach tonight because i'm here so i'm gonna preach but you know tell me who tell me who is the one that tries to exalt himself above god so tell me where does that where does that doctrine come from i got it on tape now it doesn't set it well they don't listen but you know that'll make the news from somebody but you know what that comes i'll tell you i tell you like somebody said one time he said that comes straight out of the pits of hell whether you agree with that or not that's the truth i just it just why because you know i come in sin shape and iniquity i come i come born speaking lies i come it's totally alienated from the from the life and the mercy of god but you know what when god when jesus came you know he said he said he came through his his theophany he said well we bypassed our theophany well then how in the world did he come just as a man and then had to receive something but you come here eternal life how how does and then tell me and tell me this is the great revelation of the end time i just i just i there's only one that tries to exalt himself above god but you know what i saw christ because he was was the great eternal that came down and came in flesh he condescended and then he began to speak and so he was the one that spoke everything into existence and then he continued on and spoke through the words of the prophets the prophets built the body so they laid out the whole entire plan and then he stepped down in the middle of everything that had been saith and he began to manifest exactly what had been preached exactly what had been prophesied all of those prophecies that were given in the old testament all of those that were laid out before isaiah 800 years before before jesus come into in the end of the world and here's here's isaiah talking about a virgin shall conceive all of the promises that he gave cogan about how he would come greater and what peter said or paul said the great is the mystery of godliness god was manifested in the flesh he's been made flesh so you know he didn't have to he didn't have to he become in the flesh and was born of a virgin then you know when he came but when he came he became the lower into the lowest form he came from the highest to the lowest to be born in a stable over a manure pile it's amazing and people well glory to god you know what it is people don't realize what that what they what they say oh praise god we have this great great revelation of the godhead i'm sorry you're more confusing but it's sad but to know what god done for us but you know it's it's for a that god and you hold on to what you have and god comes along and all of a sudden he begins to show you these things it's a wonderful thing one because you know i i i understand ephesians 2 says said that we were born the children of wrath even as others but god rich in mercy i i thank god that he had mercy on me the god that god would would come to to a slave that he would come to to one that was so low and when you realize what god has done for you you know because you know i realize what kind of person i am but you know if you never come to that place to realize who you are you know god's never going never going to help you god can't ever do any work for you but you know you realize you know i'm i'm i'm worse than anybody i'm i'm a low as i is any anybody you know there in me there's not one good thing and if so when you realize you know i don't have i don't have anything but you know it was all him it was him that came to me it was him that that saw me jesus said i didn't you didn't choose me he said i chose you it ordained you we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that god saw us amen and would reach out to us what a wonderful thing when you realize you know when you realize where you come from that you you know you no one no wonder brother i said my whole my whole outlook is grace why because that's all it is is grace that's the only way that's because the song says he said grace has brought me this far and grace is going to lead me home because it's the only thing that carries me because you know as long as i i can look to god's grace and realize you know because everything that i do is accepting his grace his provision he's made the way and so when you see that when you when you receive this new birth when you're when you're born into this kingdom when you realize what god's done for you and brought you and he's made you more than a conqueror and he's brought you to this place then you know what then you have have been called to in this hour god has called you to a body change and you know it's the same one it's the same one that called you and so what is it he's called you to one place and you know what he's going to continue those that he has justified he's also glorified and if he's called you to one then guess what he's calling you up he's calling you up higher he's calling you up higher than in a higher place than you've reached well you know what you say well thank god i have rece i've reached faith well then guess what god's calling you to add virtue he's because you know what that he's obligated to bring you to the place to show you how to come to that then you know what if you know if you want to know where you are and so but you know um you know people that's so it's so important to understand these things well because so many people have come and you know they they get in they get in this place where you know just like brother i'm talking about the the pentecostals you know they get to this place where you know praise god i got the i got the new birth i'm born again i've been to kingdom and you know that was the end of it he said no you're just getting started here you are you're just getting started just by the new birth breaks you brings you into a place as a newborn baby puts you in the body but there's a place of growth that has to you've got to grow up into the stature of a perfect man you've got to grow you know you know i was thinking you know when i was born i i was i was uh seven pounds 14 ounces 20 and a half inches long and i wasn't the biggest janine was janine was the biggest she's eight pounds 11 ounces but you know what i made up for it after i got here mama tell you mama's watching in she'll tell you i made up for it i lapped the rest of them i did i was three months old and i outweighed some of it three months old that some of them didn't make six seven eight months old i was chunky i figured out one thing that when i got here i figured out one thing i could do and that was eat i could eat and i could eat with the best of them but you know when i was born when i come in this world do you know what i had calcium in my body i had iron phosphorus sodium all these other elements they were all in me everything everything that's in a human was in me i had it everything that i had everything that i had need for this earthly journey was given to me in the new birth i had it all but you know what let me tell you what when i come in here it's 7 pounds 14 ounces i didn't have all the calcium but you know what i found i found i found how to get to it and every other thing and you know what i began to eat on that amen and i began to grow and you know what i still got that i still love to eat but you know what i began to i began to draw nourishment and brother ram said he said he said all you've got to do is drink and push out he said so in the new birth you have all that you have need of is given to you but it's not made manifest so when you when you have all that you have need of is given to you yeah you've got a portion of this but you're right here but you know what you've got access to that why because he's drawing you up so he's calling you up drawing you so you know you when you when you have a baby you know you just don't you just bring them home and set them in the closet or set them on the bed leave them in the crib no what do you do every so often you got to keep putting that bottle in their mouth and you know everyone every every child's different they all get but you know what they all go through the same things but you but you know we had we had levi now levi he is a professional sleeper that and that's one reason we call him lazarus levi three weeks old he slept seven hours straight a night three weeks old boy could sleep we brought him home he was only a week or two old i'm not exactly sure he slept for 12 hours straight boy is not out we called the pediatrician and the and the nurse says well as long as he's breathing she said if he gets like 14 hours wake him up well he slept and slept and slept and slept yeah but he slept and slept and slept and then all of a sudden when he woke up he was ready to eat and i don't think sarah feed him fast enough he was he was starving but you know adam adam wasn't happy about nothing he come in the world and i think levi loved that he had a brother and after a while i think he's ready to give him back or sell him or something he uh he was not happy he was he had he had colic and he was he was not happy about nothing nothing nothing made him happy for a while and finally when he decided that he was going to live and he was going to live with the rest of us and he was going to let the rest of us live sarah was like i get some sleep now she was ready she was so happy that she could finally get some sleep like they always say if you're if you're if your second child was your first one you wouldn't have a second child and that's the way that's why adam was bless his heart he he wore his mama out but you know every child is different but you know what every one of them has the same needs but they're but they have their own individual traits and so you know when you come in god's going to lead you different because you know what your personality is different you know everybody's like well you know you you're not gonna you're not gonna have the same experience as everybody else has i told a young man one time and he uh he was talking to me and him and his fiancee they were getting ready to get married and he wanted he wanted to ask me some questions he was catholic and he come to me and he said you know he said i've only got one set of grandparents that are still married and he said everybody else in my family mom dad her mom and dad everybody's been divorced he said it just runs through the family he said i got one set of grandparents that have been married since they were young and he said they're still married and he asked me he said what do i do what and i said i said well let me ask you this i said well you have all of these people that's been divorced i said what was the problem i said go back and look and see what they done in their life what was the issue that they had i know what some of them had their issues were they had substance problems i said well i said that's a problem and i said you know what you if you can't get out of a bottle you're not going to be in a marriage and so i began i said what is it about your grandparents that made them stay together i said what is it i said that's what you need to focus on what is it that they done and everybody else didn't do and i said what was their fault what was the problem analyze it look at it i said you need you need i said the first thing i said y'all there's got to be three of you even though he's calf like i i told him i said there's three of you not the two of you in the three but the five of you the three of you but i told him i said you need to put god first i said y'all need to look to god and i said if you hit hard times i said you need to find somebody even if you do go talk to your priest i said you need to talk to somebody but y'all need to come together and come up with a plan and have an understanding before you get married about what i said about finances and all these other things you need to have an understanding before you start this you know they they were they were happily married for a number of years but uh you know his his wife was killed by a drunk driver a few years ago and you know he's he's still devastated by that but you know what he had the best time because you know that was his sweetheart and he still he's still tied to her and i said you know because he talks you know what a life that he had and i said see that's what makes it it's when you put her first and she puts you first when you come together and you put god first then you can then you put each other if if it doesn't if you're not doing that it's not going to work and and every in every situation when you and your and your with your children everything god has to be first if we don't if we don't raise our children in the in the admonition of god and the fear and admonition of god you know what we're doing it wrong you're not it's not and you know whether whether your kids go out in the world and i was telling brother bob the other day you know i i just i just got i just got a faith to believe that you know we we've had a lot of young people in our church that have just walked out and they've left and they go out in the world and do whatever let me tell you what i i still yeah i was i was here it's been i told brother bob it's been several months ago and i was here and i was and i was preaching and i said you know what you the children i want y'all young people you don't go out in the world and live like however you want to but i'll tell you what this church has god has applied the token these we we claim our children you know you may not you may not you may not be my children but i still claim you i'm still going to hold faith i'm still going to believe for you and you know know and you know let me tell you i've seen and the ministers in this church so testify we've seen the look on people's faces you know because you know what it doesn't take discernment but doesn't tell you don't take discernment to see people but you know what we've seen kids that come in here and the world gets a hold of them and you know what they're ready to leave and they're ready to get out in the world and just do whatever well guess what go ahead prodigal go ahead do whatever but you know we're still we're still going to hold and still believe for you i still think about brother tom tell him telling wade we can't go till you get in why because there's a place for you but i've seen so many that that have walked out and you you see the look on these people's faces when you see the look you know because the world if if you don't get to christ the world's going to pull you brother brown said if you don't get them to christ he said rock and roll is going to get them now rock and roll and that includes rap and everything else and you think and they got people out there they listen to country and and and all of this christian stuff brother ryan can tell you testify all about all that christian stuff there ain't sometimes that stuff they might have christian in the name but that's as far as it goes as far as having anything to do with christ but you know i still i still believe and it doesn't matter as long as they're drawing as long as they're drawing breath and and that that includes not just the young people i'm talking about other people that's been in this church you know because if if abraham went after lot
