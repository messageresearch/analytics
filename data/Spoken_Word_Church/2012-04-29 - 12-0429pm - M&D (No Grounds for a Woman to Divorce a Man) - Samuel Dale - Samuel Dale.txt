our hearts that we may understand your word come and have your way Lord and if you say something it's not right then you forgive us Lord we just trying our best to be as much to help as we can to anybody and and to walk in you Lord we know and realize that we're human Mortals and that we have mistakes and problems in our lives and none of us look down upon each other but we look up to an almighty God who can take care of all things we love you and we thank you and we commit everything to you now in Jesus name Matthew 19. the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his life forever cause now when we get down to that see or nowhere just for anything all right and he answered and said them to them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female see he didn't even put up with what they had asked him you didn't even comment on what they'd asked him for any cause you know he just went straight to the point all right I said for this call shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more claimed but one flesh but therefore God hath joined together let no man put asunder they say unto him why did Moses then command the command to give a writing a divorcement and to put her away he accept unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife accepted me for fornication and she'll marry another committeth adultery and whoso married her which is put away from both just commit adultery the disciples say unto them if the case of the man be so with his wife is it it is not good to marry but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying say they to whom it is given you may be seeing the door that is blessing to the reading of the word no I went ahead and ran off the uh the definitions that we gave this morning and we won't go back through them but we will try to cover and just quote some of it as we go along but we gave the I just gave you the definitions of the the wordings and the things that we were talking about how the word divorce the worst divorcement and the word divorce is used but I hope you understand because I try to make a statement up front basically and come back and try to explain that point prove that point show the point and you know understand about it now we covered you know what is a marriage or what constitutes a marriage and we saw that it was when that you would become engaged or spoused or betrayal whatever the word that you would use there to make your commitment one to the other or in other words the boy asked the girl to marry him and she accepts again in God that is a wedding we are not to go then and just start living together because that would be fornication and getting into the wrong thing all right you said well they're married you know well that's true but we gave where the Prophet said the the law gives you the right to live together so that puts the answer to that you know don't get into the silliness of life you know in things all right now and as we covered that then this morning we tried to cover what is a divorce and you know I want to read you just a little bit and just pick up a few things and then we'll continue on into the point this afternoon so if a marriage is the value made you know you ask the girl and she accepts and that's a constitutional wedding then what would be the divorce it would be to dismiss or we gave the definitions we'll give them back again in a minute of where the word divorcement dismissal and and to be put away and all of the things all right then uh it would be to take that vow back because that's really what you would do if you went down to the law you would go to the law and say I want a divorce all right and they'd say well okay you know they want the grounds they want this out of the other but then they would say okay what is it so well I I married this woman or married this man and now I want to be divorced in other words the the the lawyer or whatever who you talk to or a judge or something he wouldn't say you mean you want to take your vows back because that wouldn't be his wording he would just say you mean you're wanting a divorce but in his definition of the word divorce if you ask him then he would be giving the words that we gave this morning to cover of what a divorce is and and then you would be saying you know uh I want to take back my vow I want to erase from the records of courts or whatever you know Etc if he's in another country they'd be doing it with this or that or the other or whatever you know dealing with would you say I'm wanting to reverse my vows I'm wanting to take them back I'm wanting to be separated from this person you know by the legality of the law and we've already went so long and there's so many things in the in all of that until it's amazing how they cover I think it's in the law of Georgia that um you've got to be separated for so long before you can apply for a divorce because they want to uh make sure there's no way of making restitution you know Etc all right but then it would be to reject your vows or to deny your vows but take a while back see that be what you would be doing doing with your legality of paperwork three you would be taking back your vows that you made all right is that simple enough even that would be constituted when they would write it up and call it a divorce or a divorcement or whatever you know would would be uh the point of doing it all right now we went through as I said I don't want to repeat all of this but I gave you these and you don't have to read them to nothing but I just will scan through and give a couple to to make sure and and that way brother Joe's putting them on the Internet so it would be on there from like this morning so we found the word divorce is only used one time in the Bible using Jeremiah 3 and 8. and it is used there and the number is 37.48 and it would be divorce dismissal or divorcement right so it would be a dismissal of your vow you would be taking back your value be dismissing it all right the New Testament for uh the old that's the only one on divorce all right now when it comes to the word divorcement it is used three times the Old Testament and I think three times in the new and it's the same number 37 48 as the word divorce all right so then what that divorcement the you would be writing her a bill of divorcement Deuteronomy 24 1-3 you know or Isaiah you would be talking about a a mother's divorcement which would mean the same word as divorce dismissal or divorcement of the 37 48 all right so then you would be coming down with the same meaning of the word all right now at the end of the word divorcement in the New Testament um like in Matthew where it says let him give her writing a divorcement or what we just read in Matthew 19 they didn't give her writing a divorcement to put her away you'll find that that word then would mean to divorcement writing a divorcement uh the word repudiation and we gave the definition of that I'm doing this where did somebody pick a tape and come back our people here I want it in your mind you think you know all about it maybe you don't maybe you need to listen maybe all of us needs to listen I was asked kind of a question at lunchtime about the uh brother Brown and the man's daughter that you know that where Billy Paul was married and and they had it annulled well why didn't the fathers why didn't the father or the girl come up with the fact of saying well I disallow The Vow so if you've had scripture I don't know I know they didn't and a little brother around said she was married I mean he was married so then the word of nulled and divorce is the same word so that it wouldn't be that a normal could be running this way it's just a terminology a wordy but it's the same word a null and divorce is the same word so then I don't have the answer to knowing why that they didn't come up with that unless maybe they didn't uh understand it I don't know I don't know why they didn't say well let's just have it let the fathers break the vow of the daughter I don't know I don't know but I just know that it didn't happen that away and they wound up with having to get an annulment and and through the word divorce all right now because the repudiation is to take back your vows which is the word divorcement take back your vows by legality of the law or authority and taking it back and not doing all right then we went on to the word divorced and the word divorce in the Old Testament is the word to drive out to expel cast out drive away divorce put away thrust away uh trouble Castaway all right and it's I gave you those definitions 16. 40 16 40 something and I I can't even see my own I got so many marks around it but that is in 1644. that is in the Old Testament that we used in in the scripture and her divorcement all right then we went on to bringing that word divorcement into the New Testament from Matthew 5 32 and we found out that that word there was the number 63 630 and it would mean to release to put away to send away to let go and set it to Liberty let depart and dismiss and nothing so it would be putting away so the word divorce is putting away and it's used you know in a lot of ways a lot of times are in the scriptures to put away see to put away your wife put her away because it was used where that it was um you know Joseph uh if you're not taking them to the American Wife but he was willing to put her away see the word is there put her away all right meaning that it's showing that how that you would be separating the two the man would be putting away all right and it would be making uh to the basis of showing the truth of it all right now so I hope everybody understands and follows that point a marriage is when you ask in The Boy The Boy asked the girl and she accept a divorce is when you go and try to reverse that because you're going to go do it with somebody else enjoyed that scene really caught I didn't know you could do that but you know reverse the thing and take it back all right all right because like I said you're going to go back down you're going to get married you're going to make some more vows again and do this so it would be to take it away that's the Simplicity I'm trying to make these wordings as simple you think that I'm just running it in an intellectual form this way I'm trying to make it as simple but showing that that's what the meaning of it is all right see then you can't argue the meaning about what it's doing you can only think about the thing now we're going to get into one this afternoon that is very touchy okay so then as we would use these definitions to decide the things and to do we're going to get into one this afternoon that is I say a very touchy one because there is no this is Brother Dale's statement and we'll go through the prophet and we'll go through the Bible there is no grounds whatsoever that a woman can divorce a man that's right there's no scriptural ground now the law out here tells you this and everybody tells you this and I asked the preacher's problem this message to tell you anything where you want to tell you but you know I'm just going to tell it like I believe it and believe it I can prove it by the prophet and if it is it'll be what he said and it won't be what I've got to say about it there's no grounds so now the reason is is because you were the ones that brought the cup The Pride right see now that you say well you're just an old chauvinist Pig you know you're against women now anybody that's been around here long enough for brothers they don't know is better than that all right you you sister is no better than that you know I have defended you to the letter of all things to try to bring the truth about a true wife a true wife the prophet said there's nothing God could give you greater outside of Salvation than a real true wife that's right A woman has a great position that's right and that she is not only that but she was chosen to bring forth Jesus Christ into the world that's right all right but still that doesn't do away with the problem right the problem of marriage and divorce there would be no such thing as divorce had it not been for the fall in the garden right that's why I ask you to read marriage and divorce and read invisible Union and think on it on that line now sisters we're not against you beating you down hammering you with this that or the other we're just trying to tell what the Bible has to say right there is no grounds whatsoever for a woman to divorce her husband right now I can show you and we will as we go along that and Paul even covers that if she does depart me let her remain single but he covers and she does depart now if a man is beating you if a man is to retreating you wrongly and harming you you do not have to live with that person that's right all right is that plain enough or anybody there on the internet you don't have to put up with garbage that's what people have tried to prove this yes you've got to do that you got you no no well I got scriptures well you got scripture but you ain't got sense but a little sense when you scripture and find out what God's talking about amen a man is treating a woman wrong right around says you are to be under subjection to him in all things except what right if he tries to hinder you in your spirituality do you need those quotes if you do contact me I'll be glad to give them to you that if he treats he tells her she can't go to church he tells her she can't do this or can't serve God all right now sisters you don't that's that's he's not your head at that point but it's like I've told you with her if your husband is not a believer it don't give you a right to be a a an arrogant when I can say well bless God I he you just don't we don't believe a lot and I ain't gonna cook for you and worse for you now you're out of your place and you ain't a Christian that's right close enough anybody needed enough definition to what Rotterdam means on that if you don't act like a Christian you're not a Christian right amen the woman that won't work and and do and clean the house and and and cook and and things like that to help in the family that don't tell me you're a Christian now we're not talking about if you're disabled right we're talking about what ought to be done you heard me tell that sister that time that two of them at that time was here and they drove five hours getting home and I said that there's still one thing when you get home and your husband said I'd like to have something to eat you go get him something to eat because he's your husband right don't say well bless God I've been in the chair he'd probably saying I would if I was the man I'd say well you need to go back because it didn't do you any good now we're going women get in your place and do what you're supposed to do as a wife you know okay no because we will get down to where brother random does build some rides that's right sure all right yep how many quotes do you want on where there's a woman cuts are higher a man has a right to divorce her yep now we know where all the quotes go and we know there's another one that goes in there and says she there's two of them now I found two but it says he can't remarry that's right because of cutting the heart but he can divorce you for cutting her that's right now we'll get down to those things so he's quoting scriptures so you don't have to argue with brother random on those things you know when we get to it I'm just trying to make a point to you that there's no grounds whatsoever for a woman to be able to divorce her husband right so what would you happen to them what would happen in her situation to where that the husband he doesn't Supply the family I told you we would try to cover everything we could in the natural and if there's anything you want me to cover look just write it down and I'll try my best to but say he won't go out and work for a living now that everybody thinks wrong about it but Ku Klux Klan wasn't developed to beat up the black people right it was used beating up the black people but it wasn't made for that it was made to beat up the source rock that wouldn't work for a living amen that was worse I don't want to be black white green yellow or brown whatever you want to call it all right but you see this maybe we need to do that sometimes we could do away with some of the welfare's and the social securities if we did a little bit of that today but that's all right we can't still do it right but suppose he won't take care of the family I mean he won't he won't work you don't have to go get a divorce you can go down and get a legal separation and you can demand that he make child payment sure amen right and you can have him arrested if he doesn't yep so then brother Dale's not a garbage can of talking you know that the mail shovel old brother no it doesn't matter whether he's a Christian or not if he don't make a living heart then somebody ought to straighten him up and make him do what's right whether it takes the law or whatever you want to do with it all right you make it I know dear actually used to maybe I shouldn't say it and I won't use the name about the formal people but he used to work he used to own the place and and people worked there and they were from a foreign country and where they were from they just beat their wives up when they don't want to you know I told him I said if you want a little help I'm happy I said the next one comes in and beat his wife up we'll take him out behind the building you're a preacher yeah funny one too I just believe in living right doing right I believe in men beating over women in garbage can is not you know that he's the porterhouse of course that's achievement now with porterhouse steak you know or something he's a porterhouse steak and she's a piece of baloney or something we don't believe in nothing like that amen all right we believe in being right okay but still that doesn't change anything that's right she has no right to divorce it because there's no way to be done how could you do it by what Authority would you use to declare a divorce for a woman now the course of the land is different okay we're not talking about that we're talking about Bible terminologies right all right so that wouldn't turn out to be the right thing would it all right so let's just go down through some of it and just see go ahead brother Joe or this is who's making her name brother Bob yeah don't you get them running go ahead and pull up number one on the mulch and let's get right around then we'll get to the scriptures and we'll get started on it and we'll we'll just Define a few things to see whether or not Wilmington divorce her husband because they have to all tie together if it doesn't then we miss the whole thing all right now taken from marriage and divorce from 1965 to 21 in the morning service paragraph uh to 27 through 229 again see she has got a living husband so no man can marry her care what she does and who she is she's got a living husband there is no grounds for her at all now what's he talking about no ground for her divorce right but it's not for him causes her not him that's what the Bible says calling her see not him get it you have to make a word running continuity he said nothing saying he couldn't but she can't he calls it her not him that's exactly what the Bible says causes her it's not stated against him to remarry but her see but her why Christ in the top just give you stated that he cannot remarry only a virgin now he gets into an expression so he can remarry he can he can remarry again if it's a virgin but he can't marry somebody else's wife no indeed now that's exactly right where you want to believe it or not you read it right you read it and keep it as plain sense you know that we're all commanded to marry a virgin you can say well that's applying to the preacher that's fine it's used for the preacher all right but there's no way now watch there's no way any of us men can marry somebody else's wife come on he said well what about David Marion the wife of the that her husband called was called a fool you remember he wasn't a preacher so he could marry a woman that had been married before but she her husband was dead right so read what wrote around him is saying he can remember he can remarry again if it's a virgin but he can't marry somebody else's why that's right you can't marry oh a woman that her husband still living are divorced right right so you read it right all right now what did you say and if he does marry a divorced woman he's living in adultery I don't care who he is the Bible said don't you ever married her they just put away living in adultery therefore you are not no divorcees see that original backyard from the beginning now remarry now notice he can but she can't like David like Solomon like the continuity the whole Bible now same as David and the rest of them all right now you notice in First Corinthians 7 10 notice Paul commands that the wife that is that divorces her husband I want you right hmm to remain single or be reconciled not to remarry huh she must remain single or be reconciled back to her husband she cannot remarry she must remain single but notice he never said about the man okay now all right so there's no grounds for her right now brother Brown is technically using the word divorce didn't she divorcing She's Gotta remain single so you can say well brother round was justifying divorce for a woman excuse me when you just got to say it in the same message that there's no grounds for her is she just talking sensible which one is it is he just simply saying that is she divorces you cannot remember me well there's no grounds for her to be separated from her first husband that's right so you know what's it doing see this is it which way is it running look at the next one 243 the marriage and divorce huh when you get this marriage and divorce straightened out so that you would know which it was right which was wrong now he finally shows here in these verses there's one Christ and many members of that wife noticed he could put us away for Spiritual fornication and false Doctrine anytime he wants to but how dare you try to put him away and make it the man can put away his wife and marry another but not the woman put away her husband and marry another one see and the Shadows see all the shadows and types that are perfectly balanced see the original creation not the byproduct no word not the church the bride through the word but the woman the man each time that's why it never says anything against a man doing it it's always the woman that's right all right now to the next one invisible Union paragraph 56 1965-11-25 the prophet Paul here is saying that a woman cannot remarry until her first husband is dead she cannot remarry as long as her first husband is living she by no circumstances at all she must remain single as long as her first husband is living and she should do such a sin she shall be called an adulteress I am speaking of the natural now to type it with the spiritual if this woman would commit such a sin then she is marked an adulteress if she has two living husbands at the same time therefore she has forfeited by doing this watch her rights to God and Heaven Listen by doing so she sure has she has hit an outcast from the economy of God according to the scriptures that I just read right yeah not a strong minute a woman divorce her husband and remarry now you tell me you don't need the grace of marriage and divorce now where we're going to go right that's what I'm reading and showing you where are you going to go get it you took that and literally just put it down as a law and set it down without a Grace to go in where are you going right you're going to the bases that none of you sisters who never divorced your husband and remarried are going to make it to heaven I didn't say that well that's your interpretation is that my interpretation my brother dick says you talk about the women's heart of somebody and you just lay the Bible down and let them read what it said but I don't believe that in other words you're not believing God but he asked her oh my boy really fixed him I told him I didn't believe that well I didn't change nothing right you understand how serious it is amen that's right without the grace of marriage and divorce where would the women be all right prayer all right now we're going to get into it in a minute and realize what we are the female with the body of Christ amen where would we be all of us men and women both in the body of Christ where would we be come on you see we try to use something to justify or trip up something or try to make it different says she's an outcast from the economy of God Amen right now he's not saying a woman that would separate from her husband because of the things that we were covering and all like that right Hall's gonna cover it in a minute all right but what's he saying because of the adulterous act in the garden that has come down then where is there any hope for hardly any other women right and then you say well now wait a minute brother Dale I've never been married was you ever engaged was you a virgin when you married your husband right we've had a long ways to go Mike Wade said the other day then they come up now and the kids are saying not to have sex so they immorally with each other without an intercourse I frown on that sorry yeah I frowned on that and somebody to contact me one time and they said their wife had admitted to him that she had orally right sex with a man and he orally sex with her but they never had no intercourse now I'm too plain I know it I'm sorry I just don't believe them right all right amen you go that far come on that's why we'll get down to that scripture about the Deuteronomy 24. amen I'm just trying today to establish the fact that you do not have any grounds whatsoever the woman does to divorce her husband but there is grounds for him but now not for just burning debris that's what we'll get we'll get yep that's what I said when when they asked Jesus that question did you notice it he never even he just turned it totally away from their question when they said for any cause he just went right back to the beginning said what's on the beginning in other words what are you playing games with the word of God right you know Moses never done that right I do not believe and I'll get back to it later I do not believe Moses just for any cause gave them a ride of divorcement right he would be breaking the word of God Amen they took it and twisted it and made it to apply for what they want to do that's what we do with the word amen all right go to the next one paragraph 151 invisible Universe I noticed the bible plan that says here that her first husband must be dated not just put away he's got to be dead all right now I urge to profit on it no grounds for her divorce him right but it doesn't say about him right now we'll cover the grounds that he has when we get back to it but it's not this or anything get that out of your mind This Plane all right now go ahead and pull up Romans 7 and let's get into this but notice the point now her Proctor Prophet finally states are saying her husband must be dead I don't never talk about marriage and divorces to anybody in the world somebody bluntly asked me a question and was kind of making a little thought in it and he he finally said you know something and I said look her husband's got to be dead you know for her to remarry and he just he stood there a minute like boy he got a light bug turned on he screamed he looked at me and said I guess I then she could kill the old boy that's what I got accepted I guess she could just kill the old boy we get a lot of husbands be dead right keep it take him back again because of me down there I said Yahoo but she'd be a murderer now what are you gonna do gosh see you're trying to prop up something all right but now listen look what Paul said for the war in which half the husband is bound by the law Romans 7 . and you know where that is invisible Union they brought around said this is a mostly used for marriage and divorce but said it's a higher order so we'll get to that but he's saying it is what it's used for for the woman which happened husband is bound by the law of her husband as long as he live it but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband okay simple husband dies she can marry again right come on you said well it's got to be this got to be that you know that road around says that if a person you know if a woman is a virgin to start with and she lives with a husband and he dies I think she was a virgin to start with she's still a virgin right no trouble saying that because it's true all right you say yes you don't have three kids come on you're not thinking spiritual or in any form rightly because she was a virgin to start with now she and the Virgin start with she's not a virgin the second third fourth fifth or eighth time right no who is it who's the latest in Marion that she died but then you know listen so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress all right now you want the scripture word the Bible says there are no adulteress can enter Heaven right now that's right but if her husband would be dead she's free to marry she free from the law so that she has no adulterers though she'd be married to another man right now that's true that's right all right woman's husband dies yep if you can remarry but remember now whether it be the man or the woman in remarriage remember one thing now I don't remember the scripture if somebody come up with it we'll put it on here but only in the Lord well I'll just go marry anybody I want I want a Christian right he says only in the Lord see it for the man we just covered that for the man all right you say well he's married this woman has been married before all right he's wrong if she's got an adulterous problem he's not one but she was a virgin for her first husband and he died and then you can marry her now the the winner of the priest has to qualify at a different time for the preacher but not for just everybody okay my brother around him I said playing David wouldn't a preacher priest he was a he was a prophet but he wasn't a priest right all right so he could marry that lady that was the her husband had died but he couldn't take somebody else's wife that's where he got in trouble with Bathsheba right yep that's right the trouble with Bathsheba was he got hurt now if you ride went out and got killed it would have been all right you know he had to be Rock healed it wasn't a starting his hand the problem he had in divorces in situations she brought on just like the garden it not only brought death you know the garden brought death because of our adulterous parent Eve the first woman brought death now Sheba brought death like the brother said there and I never noticed that scripture because he mentions it brought it to me he named the four deaths it was in the family of David because David said remember he said I'll restore it fourfold when Nathan had told him about the little eulam you know and the things and all them going in and taking the other name again he said I'll kill him right near already stored fourfold lost four kids because of his own worthy and his own doing right see David couldn't take Bathsheba because she was married she had a living husband well he ain't killed Oh Glory then he got a husband no more did that Straighten It Up no that brought more death so don't play with the word right you know and try to justify something right right now is no longer adulterers is she married to another man it's the man's name that's no problem no trouble come on folks even in the Baptist Church that I came from at the time I was there they would not have a double married preacher I said well today I'm sure but they didn't know nothing about it but they held on to that the old timers held on you know they have a little Common Sense go to the next one Corinthians 7 39 is that the one we're looking for just look at that First Corinthians I get out of second Corinth I found Barbershop 739 yep right the wife is Bound for the law as long as your husband live it but if her husband be dead she is at Liberty to be married to whom she will only in the Lord only in the Lord we are not supposed to just say I just marry anybody you're supposed to be Christian to be married in the Lord I believe we'd have done it that away and I'm not saying wrong because we all wound up in good shape maybe but if we took the scriptures we might have made some different decisions all right all right right those are supposed to be in the Lord you know all right look at First Corinthians now seven in through 11. enter the marriage command I command yet not I now he's got his Commandments Essence Grace that goes with it but look but the Lord the Lord commands let the wife listen let not the wife depart from her husband all right now but if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not to husband put away his wife now you know Paul and what he's explained he's explaining that if an unbelief you know if you marry an unbeliever to marry an unbeliever and then come to the you know you you come along one day and you become a Christian you see my wife's not a Christian I just put her away you don't have no ground right amen amen amen might get her on the cutting hair but you can't get her own name right told her they die why because Paul goes on to say what my husband sanctify you know the wife or the husbands be Sanctified by what you're doing right until you remain together the people in this message they're coming along going and say well well my wife's not a Believer I just put away Mary again you got double problems first you're putting her away just because she believes what something differ and then you're trying to marry again because you're trying to find something in your own lustful form and I don't mind talking playing why would you want to put away your wife if you came along I know one man in this message that they have 10 kids and he come up and divorced her and he said she told him that she was not true to him before the marriage okay roll around you got a scripture he's a profit thing right but according to what everybody found out she told him when they first got married and then after 10 kids you got to look into somebody else at least he did he tried to use that scripture I don't play games with scripture so that's not the way to do it all right but if she depart see all right it's a woman departure what caused it for you right but let her remain unmarried well it doesn't say if she depart her husband won't give him another you said well that sure puts a lot of problems on all of us we put our own problems on ourselves by not praying and waiting you remember the man that come to brother random and said well I could straighten you out on that marriage and divorce because you're talking about that woman been married three or four times I said I had this Vision you know he started doing it right around and said immediately I knew it was a dream remember and he said you're dreaming all might sound beautiful but you ain't scripture and he just thought he could just put her away marry another one and she could put this away and marry another one oh that may be well and good you know and a lot of people depend upon that they depend upon their feelings their uh spirituality and I'm not joking or making light up but they depend upon their spirituality of feelings or their spirituality of Visions or dreams or something what if you had a dream brother dick that that you could just shoot sister Gayle marry again laughs now would that be so well if it's real dream you gotta go do it you're calling from the Lord but see you come tell me I'd say brother you take too much beans you went to bed on a Bailey full of something that messed you up because your dream ain't scriptural all right you see we try to get all of the things and do what we want to yeah but let her remain unmarried or your husband he said well do they have to do this than the others Paul goes on down to say there's a brother and sister is not under bondage in this case not meaning that they can just divorce do whatever you want to it means that you know if the woman divorces her husband or goes away from him losing and she comes back wants to come back with him she doesn't been out and done something wrong because she left or something you didn't want to take her back and we're going to get into it we don't have time today but we're going to get into it you know that people in this message believe that you can put away your wife for fornication but if she commits adultery after you're married you don't have to I mean you can't put her away that's been taught in this message where is it biggest garbage can of people that's in the world is in this message bringing up these ideas sorry but it's true right right man me all right now in the natural in the natural see go ahead and use Matthew 5 32 because we'll use that part because look at your situation it puts the woman into but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause and I'm going to get into the definition of these words later okay tell him for the cause of fornication cause it hurt to commit adultery if he puts her away without a just reason yep you know what running around says right after that because she will marry he's going to cause it yeah yes now if you got justifiable reasons to do it you don't cause her she calls herself but if it's just for your little not burning the bread or what I mean burning the bread or not cooking good or whatever because she ain't a Believer like you you're gonna call her to commit adultery right no she will marry and whosoever that marriage hurt in his divorce committeth adultery now that's about it that's the prophet there's no grounds for her right no situation worse you can divorce her husband and remarry he's got to be dead man all right now the prophet said on invisible Union this message he said is more or less related to where it is Romans 7 2 marriage and divorce but he says I want to take it higher amen you understand Christ and the church so now look what would be the rest of it see let's see our situation all right go ahead and pick up number five on the notes brother and let's read these I'll get this out of the way because I said it this morning and um then we'll get down to what we're trying to really bring all right number five this is paragraph 207 questions and answers in neural 2 64 823 that's the reason I want to answer it just is with much sense is chance to it is I can give you do they ask the question run around if a man has been married and divorced isn't that awful to me I'm not saying nothing against the people that's just on the people's mind they're trouble the Rapture people use not to think so much about that now that's what we're going to get into it that's why I've always told you there'll be a lot of people like to die and go by the grave they'll come up in the rapture predicamental Resurrection right go watch what he's saying it's because the look of them didn't know how to straighten anything out but they didn't have the the prophet to bring the correct understanding so one would argue with the other if they're argued over a little Mark over a word right after nicaea because that's what they're arguing with write it nicely in Council 325 had done got to that point they were arguing about that because man's ideas are done developed where is it but look what he's saying all right Rapture people used not to think so much about that why they couldn't go being a rapture petition they used to come for the Rapture right it wasn't so much of it but now he's just plastered the world and the people read no play you know plain language plaster of the world after the prophet started preaching it right right you agree with that and run around started coming along and preaching Rapture people got interested in Rapture when they come along start preaching the son of man people started preaching son of man huh but look but it's just less than the people read these things in the scriptures and people elected out there is coming in to look at it and they see it and they're sincere they want to know that's the reason I want to answer it justice with with much sense to it as I can give it you has been married and divorced and been remarried of a woman who have also been married and divorced now so we're just not picking on the women right both men and women he's talking about what's she married to woman who had also been married and divorced and married to him and these two can can marry in God's side the in other words are coming down are they married and got shot how can both are one of them be in the rapture I want you how I don't know right and look at the sincere to the man I couldn't tell you the question is can they be in the rapture divorce each one of them divorce each one of them has a living companion then they're married again both of them married again and now one that this woman has a living husband and this man has a living wife and narrative got children and so forth and want to come to God can they go into Rapture that'll be up to the heavenly father I couldn't answer that see because that was 1964 before the grace of marriage and divorce was preached huh could it be you know as I said this morning now come on folks I'm just saying honest if you don't see you need something it won't cry out for it how are you going to get it right all right right amen amen did you cry for the new birth right that's the way you get it then craft for the grace of marriage and divorce that's the way you get it right that's what tears me up in my heart the thing that the Ministers of this message won't preach it to their people the four old people sitting out there and that's where I go and that's why I went with the internet because I go out there and people would ask me questions I said we'll get you pastored okay and I'll give you the tape my pastor won't let me listen to the times yep well that's where we come through it not years ago they had what they called as a spiritual husband Doctrine people in other words if you go to another church instead of going to this church here you're committing adultery against me because I'm your husband well the only answer I ever had that was well how come my husband is going to some other female he was going out and preaching to other churches all across the country but if I went anywhere else it was adultery that's all I wanted the answer for it's okay for him to run around but it wasn't for me okay sorry I'm sorry for it does you think that you think I think I'm something for no if you knew I was in my heart and how I felt I cry out and long to get to see the truth and not only that but they're trying to find some way to get it to people yeah yeah you realize these people hearing from these tapes on marriage and divorces never heard a sermon of marriage and divorce it's been in this message 30 40 years maybe they can hear the truth are you trying to be exalted in what I know I don't have to preach this but somebody needs to tell the truth look at the next one this is a question and answers book three paragraph 12 yes just remember this to you people who are married and divorced I remember what he said he said I'm just I'm sitting out there he said God what am I going to do he said I got me and that's married two or three times he said I got women that's married two or three times he said I've got people saying should I divorce my wife should I put her away should I leave my wife or whatever you think it wouldn't have burdened in that man's heart but look what he said now this was almost not quite a year before marriage divorce was preached just remember this to you people who are married and divorced and remarried promise me one thing you put your confidence in me I guess this is not tape I don't know you you you you believe me as your Prophet sent from God your servant then you take my word for this will you go on Living Just Like You Are don't you try anything else like it but Liz just go ahead just live happy you got you're saved and you're Christians you go ahead and live in for Christ he had a reason to save you nice now when I come back the Lord willing I'll explain that to you in the Bible see and don't get upset many men told me said well I love my wife but I'll just have to leave her I don't want to miss the rapture don't you do that they just as you are do you hear from me again see on this subject then when I I can't explain it in 10 or 15 minutes it's going to take some time to explain it because it's got to be the scripture it's got to be thus saith the Lord if it isn't it isn't right yeah all right now look what he said just stay where you are with the next one we'll get down to the point especially natural real for me this paragraph 181. we're now in the case of marriage and divorce I've asked you like a brother hold your peace until you hear from me here just go right on as you have lived I'm taking up too much time it should be the storm as you live boom what he didn't tell us to go out and do this and go out and do that you didn't tell nobody to do this or that the other on conduct order I mean on questions and answers one time that pinpointed me down he said the best thing I continued to do is live single it was just wordy all right because what he's going to do there was no Grace to be given and as I said if the new birth took care of it why would a prophet be send such turmoil to express the grace of marriage you know why would he be in that position if it was just going to be a new murder all right now I've tried to explain this scripture so if you want to turn they've got it First Corinthians 6 18. I've tried to explain the scripture people openly told me they didn't agree it's okay I still believe it but you're just stubborn I guess I'm sure I'm sorry I'm sorry for being stubborn but one of these days you look at me you'll say I'm glad you're stubborn and she told me the truth look what Paul says First Corinthians 6 18. free fornication ever sin that a man does is without the body but he that committeth fornication senteth against his own body no what is he saying the body without the spirit the Bible says it's dead right your body can't do anything without something motivating it causing it to happen amen all right see then see what he simply saying the definition of that did I give it to you brother yeah okay 4203 is the definition from it and look what the word fornication means to prostitute one's body to the lust of another to give oneself to unlawful sexual intercourse to commit fornication I don't understand that word metaphor right to be given to idolatry now it's not adultery now don't right okay all right amen you know it run around I said that one time there's some brothers and they kind of laughed at me until they take a while for it to Don them I said brother Brown said all you got to do is just let God be idling you're an idolatry I didn't say adultery I said I talked to me so they caught on to what I was saying you just let God be idle in your life and you're not you're an idol doctor you're you've got another God you've got something going wrong right you know you see to be given to idolatry to worship Bibles to prevent oneself to be drawn away by another into idolatry right not an adultery that can be natural part but listen look what Paul is simply saying ever sin that a man doeth is without the body your body can't sin unless something inside of it makes it work right right it's called the body of sin because it is the basis of what you display it with right right but the body without the spirit is dead all right now so then ever sin that a man do it is without the body you're standing in your in your soul if you're a sinner and you're lost right all right you don't have to display in your body what you do in your soul because your soul is born lost right a sinner your body Spirit Soul belong into the devil as we talked about this morning married to Adam IC nature so now watch you you before you're born again your soul is lost it's a sinner your spirit is a sinner your body is a sinner what is just displayed as a unit because what is within your soul goes out through your spirit into the body and you go do the act right right but you can stand right there in the Soul and Spirit part of you and sin without it going into the body on scripture either it looks on the woman to lust After Earth commits an adultery already were I didn't see anybody said in his heart all right so we're in the scripture me so then what's Paul talking about I believe he's talking about shipping what I just said your body can't display anything it's your soul and your spirit and it makes it motivate to do those things so then we're lost and we need to be born again and when we're born again we're not born again in body and spirit we're born and again in our soul right right and that brings eternal life to the soul amen you agree but the body and spirit is still in the world yes right all right it's still often in the world if you want to call it well because it only has the earnest then you burn the earnest Paul says or Peter and description you earnesty wearing hers until until the Redemption of the person's possession right or I want to say this morning our bodies as far as God is concerned or already redeemed you agree right right but we're physically in the making of it and it's not finished yet no it's not done we're in the process of redemption of the body and that's what I believe the seals had to be brought amen to show us the full Plan of Redemption Spirit soul and body right the seals didn't come to just reveal the Redemption of the body it kind of reveal the Redemption of Soul spirit and body as a unit that's right but see the Peter and them had and Paul and them had done preached the Redemption of the soul for the new birth right and a daily sanctification and into the spiritual Realm but they do not have to handle the body right all even said who can free me from this body of death but see then the new birth makes your soul complete you know I mean makes it the earnest if you're inheritance the rest of it's paid for but he ain't claimed it yet that's what wrote around said in the silver read the the breach right the world is already redeemed as far as God is concerned but it ain't your possession of it yet right join our bodies you see the shield had to break for the bride to bring her the quote the prophet said because of a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals I say unto you go on as you are amen it had never been a way for a body to been able to walk into a change right had to Prophet not preach the grace of marriage and divorce so I had to become right but he brought it those that can receive it can walk therein brother Dale you've condemned me to to Hell by the last messages you've preached to me and I don't know what to do but then just go to God and start crying out and ask him because God has given us a Grace amen to set our bodies free he has given us that opportunity to receive Grace that was beyond the grace of the new birth the disgrace would cover the spirit and the body of mankind and bring mankind to a change without this message there is no change in the body right and this message came after the opening of the seals right Prophet said that's when these messages be gone Rapture message with after the opening of the seals and look where you come up to marriage and divorce and we'll get to it and cover it there's a lot of men that are condemned in their heart that they don't know what they're doing and don't understand but if they only stood understood the scriptures they could see that they were free right A lot of people didn't need the grace of marriage and divorce for a physical thing because if that woman comes in confessions you have a right to put her away and marry again a lot of men could stand free if they would just listen to the truth but there listen ing why too much pride in the preachers too much I'm gonna tell you what to do I'm your pastor where's that purpose you know not tall said all sin is without the body except fornication which is of the body we gave the definitions put them back up we gave the definition it's dealing with sexual intercourse or in some form prostitution of one's body and lust to another is dealing with the body you realize where my trouble would be if I went and out and done something wrong this afternoon with some girl woman you know if I don't tell my wife that's my body right well of course the way most people think it is they're going to get them a new one and the others they think well it don't matter what I do in this one but everything will be straightened up maybe I'll get me a right partner when I get over there I don't know all sin the body doesn't sin right the soul is where the sin lies but when that soul is made pure by the new birth it cannot sin right you see it remain at the end cannot sin so then where's the prophet when he said we sin every day what is he talking about definitely not in the soul but it's in our spirit in our body and it leads us into the wrong things and that's why people were mad three or four times and things like that why because of the lust brought forward and your Prophet didn't and I won't he called them Christians if you'll read back over what I gave you were talking about true he called it right over here in this corner elect those quotes true elect people sitting there because of misinterpreted Theology and marriage two or three times two Christians completely what can we do I see all fornication that fornication thing but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body first off as I see in my life and hurt with one body now we are the body of Christ right Paul said me go out to a harlot I'm the body of Christ he said we were the body of Christ if we sin against this body we must confess it to this body is that correct that's right amen well I confessed it to the Lord that's where we're going all in the prophet said right but lady said you didn't sin against God you sinned against your husband he said you got to go to your husband before you go to God yep right Church you just thinking about Grace think about the grace of marriage and divorce I wish you really invisible but around said in that now he's talking spiritual he said invisible union he sits a higher order of marriage in divorce read that in the book higher order of reading this morning I've read those books over and over because I'm keeping it all in my mind our old husband you looking at it you couldn't see my soul but that was married to an old husband right endemic nature but once that's born again that doesn't make my body and my spirit born again it does not make that to be able to be married to Christ right right the old husband's got to be dead amen amen now as I said while ago then the old husband got to be dead the woman she just shoots the husband you know I don't work does it right but you know what brother Brown says an invisibly in foreign he said your old husband's got to be dead to be married to Christ now here's a quote we'll get back to it he said God let it die reading verse beginning God let it die you mean that it's possible that everybody in this building knows all about me in all the years I've been around but yet somewhere someday it's going to be a place that God's going to let that old man be so dead until he can't even see it in my body come on you can't even see if my body that'll be so dead right see that away then your marriage and divorce will be right right when you can come to the place to see all of those husbands and wives thank you God let him die if God let him die you say yeah but they're still out there living I don't remember I've always said one of these days if I ever get enough nerve I'm going to preach on the God but I don't need you because you tell me what happens how does God forget I'm glad he does so to be married to Christ the word of the hour old husband has got to be David not just hung up in a closet we'll get back to these as we're going through some of the points and we'll see the truth that maybe some people didn't need that but I'm going to say it to you up front believe it there's not a person in the world outside of the Lord Jesus Christ are you playing with me the Lord Jesus Christ was the only one that does did not have a problem with some form of problems in life are if nothing else spiritual adultery run around should I carry the Baptist Bible converted them to a Baptist faith did he walk out there and say blessed God God told me come out here and tell y'all y'all are all messed up but I've been right all the whole time when brother Brown says we and hush why won't people let him be one part of that yeah but he didn't need it well he said he did that's right where are we at well so there's no grounds for the woman her husband's got to be dead amen but if God Can Let It Die by the grace of American divorce that person could be president of the United States and you can still stand and look there and say the old man is dead it was gone let him die that I could be married to the right one come out and be married to Christ come on British and I could be mad to Christ without any impurities you say well I don't see how that can be done would you mind explaining me one thing because your soul be made so Peter that God could come and live in it that's right if you'll ever explain that to me then you won't have to have it explained to you that God can take care of our marital problems right yeah but it's because of the opening of the word and why would we want to turn to work why is it people don't want to hear the hear I know it's me and my idea but in my presentation my arrogance and hatefulness and all I have but that won't stand the Judgment folks I don't have to be taken care of in me but if a dumb donkey tells you the truth thank God for the truth amen all right and you know sometimes it might help to pet the donkey okay you could at least be friendly with the donkey all right anybody has a need the owners open like I said have you ever really just asked God have you ever asking have you ever said Lord thank you for getting me out of organizations you know we don't have nothing against them well they helped us thank God yeah but damn God don't lay that back down there I don't have to put up that I don't have a lot of good dogs help me do things but I'm really call in the other day and I didn't want to sneaker behind me and get me well I don't think he is doing me a favor and I heard that brother uh Dale Smith pretty soon dogs Friday night I kind of like hearing that matching plan I mean he told them about that dog out there in a bit brother Dale but it didn't hurt go ahead brother friendly believe me but now I like this so the doctor can tell you everything's okay I don't care what the technology you know me all the devil okay what's wrong man United foreign you know why no age downstairs to be able to carry it all away that's right Paul could look at it and say change in a moment a click of an eye or something she couldn't follow it all the way through okay you're coming to profit you bring all of that back and speaking about those things all of them said if God gets unfold foreign foreign foreign take me to do it what we said has been worthy of being said we pray that there's somebody here is not there and don't understand everything if I'm not to put too much together and try to make me say something I'm not saying but they go back and listen to the types father and and hear what you see it because we're only trying to explain salvation and Truth For You Lord because we thank you for the truth thank you for the saving of our souls thank you for the revelation of the grace of marriage and divorce to be given in this last days that could set us all free maybe we might not need it in the physical but we certainly need it in the spiritual because we were totally married to the devil in his ways Lord you consider free because you can let that old husband die because one day Satan will be told and destroyed and we love you and we thank you Father have your way be with the people on the way home and take care of everybody give us all of your loving grace in Jesus name amen but I thought thank you to break your where are you fine little bit late never and you never foreign
