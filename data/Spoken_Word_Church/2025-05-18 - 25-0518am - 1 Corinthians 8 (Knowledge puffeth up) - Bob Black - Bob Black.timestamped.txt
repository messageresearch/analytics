[0:00] cut it off in the middle of that good
[0:02] story, but we can go home and listen to
[0:04] the rest of it. Amen. Let's let's bow
[0:08] our heads. Lord God, we're so grateful
[0:10] for your word and for this message that
[0:11] you've given to us. I pray, God, that
[0:14] you'll be with us this morning, Lord,
[0:15] and guide us through these scriptures,
[0:17] Lord Jesus. Help us now, Lord God, as we
[0:19] study these things out. Be with us today
[0:21] as we come with expecting hearts to
[0:23] receive what you've got in store for us
[0:25] today. Bless us now, we pray in your
[0:27] name. Amen.
[0:30] So, we're going to go to 1 Corinthians
[0:32] chapter 8
[0:34] today. And
[0:36] uh before we
[0:38] read the first few
[0:41] scriptures, just
[0:44] uh you know, I I was just meditating on
[0:47] this morning on how that you know that
[0:50] um the devil likes to create chaos and
[0:53] and uh you know, it's like you know,
[0:55] when you were you know, kids playing on
[0:57] on the playground or something and or or
[0:59] in school and you maybe you'd enter into
[1:01] a game that you didn't know the rules
[1:03] for and and uh the other kids maybe
[1:06] would win because you were confused
[1:08] about what the rules are and how how
[1:10] things worked. Well, it's it's the same
[1:12] thing maybe with with maybe
[1:15] a an imperfect type or whatever a
[1:18] comparison, but you know, the the the
[1:19] gospel gives us a way understanding
[1:22] knowledge on how to defeat the
[1:25] devil. And uh you you begin to see his
[1:27] nature and see see how things work and
[1:30] and and also more importantly maybe to
[1:32] see how our nature is and how how to
[1:35] kind of be aware of of the problems that
[1:38] we have and uh that's where the book of
[1:41] corrections is it it begins to examine
[1:44] our life and examine the way we are and
[1:46] and it straight it causes us to become
[1:49] uh aware of our own problems and things.
[1:52] That's why sometimes maybe the this this
[1:54] uh the book of corrections is it's it
[1:56] hits in maybe a little different way.
[1:59] You know, I I was meditating too this
[2:01] morning that um you know, we we think
[2:04] about that scripture that the Lord
[2:05] himself would descend with a shout and a
[2:07] voice and the trump. And what that means
[2:09] really is that that that the bride is
[2:12] going to receive a message. And when she
[2:14] becomes the living embodiment of that
[2:16] message, she will become the the word
[2:18] expressed. And it's not just the
[2:20] doctrine. And it's not just the the the
[2:22] theology, but she will actually become
[2:24] the the living the interpretation of the
[2:27] word. And that will be a signal that
[2:29] we're going to go in the rapture. Amen.
[2:31] That when she becomes the voice, the
[2:33] actually walking on two feet that the
[2:35] word expressed. So, you know, it's more
[2:38] it's more than just um all all the
[2:40] doctrines and everything, but it's the
[2:42] the life in between that that actually
[2:44] is living out that we've got. So that's
[2:46] where this book of corrections as we
[2:48] take a step back, it it might not might
[2:51] not look that deep. We'll say it like
[2:53] that, but but it's it's dealing with our
[2:55] life, our character. And when God can
[2:58] look at at our character and see, well,
[2:59] you're expressing exactly what uh the
[3:02] same character that that you know that
[3:04] Jesus Christ expressed when he was on
[3:05] earth, then that's a signal, a sign that
[3:09] we're going in the rapture. Now uh the
[3:12] to set the stage uh of of 1 Corinthians
[3:16] 8 in uh in in Corenth they they had this
[3:21] situation and you think and maybe we'll
[3:22] put ourselves in this situation too and
[3:25] as we walk through this that nearly all
[3:28] the meat that you would buy in the
[3:30] market was was actually had some kind of
[3:33] association with pagan temple rituals.
[3:36] So they would take the meat and and uh
[3:39] because everybody was pagans, they would
[3:40] go down to the temple and they would
[3:42] sacrifice it. They would lay it before
[3:43] the altar of whatever god, Diana,
[3:46] Aphrodite, what you know, whatever their
[3:48] gods were. And then the temple the
[3:51] temple would take that and either the
[3:53] person would uh they they' eat eat it in
[3:56] a temple feast. They'd have like a big
[3:58] banquet hall that they'd eat right there
[3:59] in that temple. Or they'd take the the
[4:02] the pagans would take that uh that meat
[4:05] and they'd take it out to a market and
[4:07] sell it to raise more money for the
[4:09] temple or the worshipper sometimes maybe
[4:11] would take it home. But now you now
[4:14] let's now let's place ourselves in that
[4:16] same situation. Now, what if every every
[4:18] time you'd go to the market like uh
[4:20] Publix or Engles or something that maybe
[4:23] there was a sticker on there that said
[4:25] offered to the goddess Diana and and
[4:28] that so so you know maybe maybe many of
[4:32] us in here would would kind of be
[4:34] pricricked like I don't know really want
[4:36] to eat some meat that was offered to
[4:38] Diana. I don't really really want to eat
[4:41] some meat that was was was uh used in a
[4:44] sacrifice, some pagan sacrifice or uh or
[4:48] let's let's bring it on home. Maybe
[4:49] maybe there's a uh a Buddhist temple or
[4:52] something, you know, like down in
[4:53] Atlanta, they've got all these temples
[4:54] and things. Maybe maybe it was offered
[4:57] in a sacrifice or done something like
[4:59] that to to a to a a temple in Atlanta.
[5:02] And and so you see the the situation
[5:04] that they were in. Many of them, many of
[5:07] them were like, I, you know, I'm I don't
[5:09] want to eat anything that was offered to
[5:12] an idol. I don't want to eat anything
[5:14] that was offered to a false god. I'm a
[5:16] Christian. And we we understand, uh, you
[5:19] know, the difference. So now, so the
[5:21] Corinthian believers were kind of split.
[5:23] Now, this was what Paul was addressing.
[5:24] He's addressing the the knowledgeable
[5:27] Christians that that are, you know, of
[5:30] the position meets meat. It it in other
[5:33] words they know they know they have like
[5:36] an understanding and Paul's in agreement
[5:38] with them. It's it's just meat. You can
[5:41] go you can go to the supermarket. It
[5:43] don't matter what the sticker says. It
[5:45] don't matter that it was offered to a
[5:47] altar or whatever. It's just meat. Take
[5:49] it home and put it on the grill and you
[5:51] can eat it. That's fine. But then you
[5:53] have others that are like I I don't want
[5:55] to have anything to do with meat that
[5:58] was offered to an idol. Now, now you can
[6:01] imagine that the situation that that
[6:03] that and and this maybe can apply to our
[6:06] our own lives. You got a knowledgeable
[6:08] Christian that's ready to just put the
[6:10] other under their thumb and say, "How
[6:11] could you how could say it like how
[6:13] could you be so dumb?"
[6:15] And then that wounds that wounds the
[6:18] other and and now and and really what
[6:20] what the where the essence of the
[6:22] message is if it's your your consc the
[6:24] conscience of one is to say my
[6:26] conscience says I don't want to eat
[6:28] something that's offered to an idol and
[6:30] then somebody maybe with a little bit
[6:32] more knowledge where that's more more
[6:33] liberty comes and says that wounds the
[6:36] brother that's just trying to live by
[6:37] his conscience. Now now you see what it
[6:40] all comes down to. It's got to be a
[6:42] personal relationship with God. And and
[6:45] and you come by and you wound somebody
[6:48] that's trying to do right and yet God
[6:49] just hasn't opened up to them the the
[6:51] place of liberty maybe that you're at.
[6:53] And and you you put your thumb on them
[6:55] and and now you've caused them to
[6:58] disregard their conscience. Not in just
[7:00] that instance, but in all future
[7:02] instances. Now they're not listening to
[7:04] their conscience anymore. They're trying
[7:05] to do what somebody else says or trying
[7:07] to live by somebody else's rulebook. and
[7:10] and and and so Paul's saying Paul's
[7:12] saying look he's saying I I agree that
[7:14] idols are nothing in verses 4-6 but he
[7:18] rebukes what's he rebuking the arrogance
[7:21] of those flaunting flaunting their
[7:24] freedom and wounding the conscience of
[7:27] weaker brethren and if you keep reading
[7:29] them down in verses 8 to 8 uh chapter 8
[7:33] 11 and 12 he's basically saying don't
[7:35] destroy someone's faith just to prove
[7:39] your liberty
[7:40] Liberty is not license and this this is
[7:43] you can see this all through the
[7:44] religious world and and even creeped in
[7:46] the message that they the liberty is it
[7:50] becomes to a place where it can be
[7:51] weaponized where you weaponize it.
[7:53] Liberty isn't licensed to trample
[7:55] others. If you have to say well I don't
[7:57] care what anybody thinks then then
[7:59] you're not acting in Christian love.
[8:02] Now, now that the stage is set, let's
[8:04] read 1 Corinthians 8:1-4. And we'll
[8:08] start off with that. So Paul says, "Now
[8:10] as touching things offered unto
[8:13] idols, we know that we all have
[8:18] knowledge. We we know. We know we got We
[8:22] know we
[8:23] understand. But
[8:25] knowledge puffth up, but
[8:29] charity
[8:31] edifyth. So knowledge, now this is, you
[8:34] know, you start you getting built up
[8:36] until you play the place where you
[8:37] understand things and then it will just
[8:41] if you don't and brother B will make
[8:42] statements like this too that faith has
[8:44] got to be mixed with love or otherwise
[8:46] it don't work right because knowledge
[8:48] will build it'll it'll make you all
[8:50] puffed up. Bless God. Look at me. I'm
[8:52] the one. All you know, all those sorts
[8:54] of things. But then you you got to mix
[8:55] it with love because love is the thing
[8:59] that will actually edify. In other
[9:01] words, strengthen one another. Will
[9:03] strengthen one another. So you can take
[9:05] your knowledge by itself and all it does
[9:07] is just hurt and injure. But mix it with
[9:09] love and now you've got the truth that
[9:12] can actually build one another up. Now
[9:14] see, this is why the the book of
[9:16] Corinthians hurts and scalds. And you
[9:18] know, I want to take a step back too.
[9:20] You know, when when you're preaching
[9:21] these things, you can get sometimes the
[9:23] idea that, you know, the ministers up
[9:24] behind the pullpit just putting his
[9:26] thumb on everybody, but this is for me,
[9:28] too. I I I read this and I'm like, "Oh,
[9:31] oh, God." I help me help my attitude.
[9:34] Many times in in my life, I've, you
[9:36] know, not had the right attitude when I
[9:38] when I talk to somebody about the gospel
[9:40] or whatever, not deal with patience. So,
[9:43] these scriptures are not just for from
[9:45] the pulpit to the people, but the
[9:47] scriptures are are to straighten us all
[9:49] up. We're all in this together.
[9:52] You got to mix. We've all got to mix
[9:54] faith and love together. Otherwise, it
[9:57] won't work right. And now look what he's
[9:59] saying. Knowledge puffth up, but charity
[10:01] edifith. Go to the next scripture. And
[10:03] if any man think that he knoweth
[10:08] anything, he knoweth
[10:10] nothing yet as he ought to know. Now
[10:14] that positions us all in our you. Well,
[10:17] bless God. I understand. I understand
[10:19] all the word. I understand everything.
[10:21] Yeah. But the the point is not
[10:26] to the point is not to to just know and
[10:30] let me frame it up like this. I was
[10:31] talking to a a pastor at another church.
[10:35] And he said uh I'm not going to name his
[10:37] name, but he said he he was actually
[10:39] sharing that he had said under brother
[10:41] Biscll for years in his in his ministry
[10:43] and everything. And one of the things
[10:44] that he took away from that was that
[10:45] when you study the scripture, you're not
[10:48] just studying the scripture just to
[10:49] learn like to learn, but you're actually
[10:52] studying it to become into relationship
[10:55] with Jesus Christ.
[10:57] So it's not when we study the scripture,
[10:59] we're not just learning things, but
[11:02] we're entering into a relationship with
[11:04] God. Right? Now, see, there's the
[11:06] difference. you you you look at it one
[11:09] way and you're just you're just learning
[11:11] to heap up knowledge within yourself,
[11:13] but you look up at another look at it
[11:15] another way and you're you're learning
[11:17] to enter into a relationship with God.
[11:21] Now, that's what verse three says. If we
[11:23] if we go, it would keep going on. If any
[11:25] man love God, the same is known of him.
[11:31] Right? So, it's not we think, well,
[11:34] bless God, I know. Look how much I know.
[11:36] If you think you know anything, you
[11:39] don't know yet as as you you don't know
[11:41] anything yet as you ought to know. But
[11:43] if you love God, then that's known of
[11:47] you. So now the main thing the main
[11:50] thing is to be known of
[11:53] God. As concerning therefore the eating
[11:55] of those things that are offered in
[11:56] sacrifice into idols, we know that an
[11:59] idol is nothing in the world and that
[12:02] there is none other god but one. Now, so
[12:07] you know what the Corinthians were doing
[12:08] is they they uh began to be more
[12:11] aligned. They began to be more concerned
[12:14] with possessing information about God
[12:19] rather than true
[12:21] relationship based on love which God
[12:25] recognizes.
[12:27] Now, that kind of goes along I was
[12:28] listening to brother Brandham just
[12:29] talking there a moment ago where he was
[12:31] saying that you know that I like he he
[12:33] was using
[12:34] um Zachariah that story of Zachchariah
[12:37] as a comparison to our own lives about
[12:39] how that if we go to God in prayer and
[12:41] God answers our prayer back that it
[12:43] scares us half to
[12:45] death. Isn't that I think that's that's
[12:48] very telling. Why why would that be? I
[12:53] is there something lacking in our lives
[12:55] to where we feel that if we if we need
[12:57] something from God, we got to let
[12:58] somebody else do the prayer and pray it.
[13:01] But if there's something if if we've got
[13:02] a need in our family or in our own life,
[13:05] we should have enough confidence that
[13:07] God is going to answer our own prayer to
[13:10] where we don't have to dump
[13:12] everything. Bear with me now. We don't
[13:15] have to dump it all in the WhatsApp
[13:16] chat. You're right. And let somebody
[13:18] else do the praying. But we can have our
[13:21] enough confidence in our own prayer and
[13:23] our own relationship with God to know
[13:27] you realize the power there if you know
[13:28] God is going to answer my prayer. And
[13:32] that's actually that statement that
[13:33] brother Random said that I believe that
[13:35] you really go to God in prayer and faith
[13:37] and God will answer your prayer. Now,
[13:40] now, so that's what it's all about is
[13:42] we're not we're not Christians ju just
[13:44] gathering information, but it's about
[13:47] relationship with God where you have a
[13:50] relationship. It's not just looking at
[13:52] the Bible trying to figure things out so
[13:54] we can learn it like we're studying
[13:55] Shakespeare or something, but it's where
[13:57] we're entering into a relationship with
[13:59] God. It's about love. If any man love
[14:02] God, the same is known of him. So now
[14:07] it's not about knowing information but I
[14:10] want to be known of God. I want God to
[14:13] know me to to be known of him is the
[14:17] ultimate goal as appear as opposed to
[14:20] merely knowing about him to be to know
[14:25] about him. Now now that's what Jesus
[14:27] said in Matthew 7 22 to 23. Well, he
[14:30] said, "Many will say to me in that day,
[14:32] Lord, Lord, have we not prophesy
[14:34] prophesied in thy name, and in thy name
[14:38] have cast out devils, and in thy name
[14:40] done many wonderful works? And then will
[14:42] I profess unto them, I never knew you.
[14:46] Depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
[14:49] Now, of course, now, well, you could
[14:51] study that out. I never knew you means
[14:53] that he he never knew you from before
[14:55] the foundation of the world. He never
[14:56] knew you as a part of an intimate
[14:58] relationship. He never knew you as part
[14:59] of giving you the new the life of God
[15:02] and being having a relationship with
[15:03] him. And what this all boil down to is
[15:05] boils boils down to
[15:08] relationship. Now, isn't that a shame
[15:10] how so many can come to church and it's
[15:13] just a a a religious form, an outward
[15:16] appearance and and and just and and just
[15:19] piling on of information, but they would
[15:21] never enter into a relationship with
[15:24] God. never come into that holy of holies
[15:27] where it's you and God and fellowship
[15:28] alone and the the the curtain swings
[15:31] shut behind you and and you're in
[15:33] relationship with God. Now see the
[15:35] Corinthians were saying we have all
[15:37] knowledge and many believers understand
[15:39] the doctrine behind it but knowledge
[15:42] alone not just knowledge alone can make
[15:45] people arrogant. It builds you up in
[15:47] your in your mind and it puffs you up.
[15:49] But charity builds others up. Now, now,
[15:52] now look, if we really splice that down,
[15:55] the difference is the difference between
[15:57] knowledge and charity is knowledge
[15:58] builds me up, but charity builds you up,
[16:02] right? Knowledge builds me up. Look at
[16:05] me. Look at Oh my, what a wonderful
[16:08] preacher I am. But charity builds you
[16:11] up. Charity is charity is it's the
[16:15] definition of charity like give it means
[16:17] like giving out giving to some given to
[16:19] the poor given and charity gives of
[16:21] yourself to others now look what brother
[16:24] Ram said is and hear ye him he said God
[16:27] lives in his word and you know he's so
[16:30] great what makes God great to me is
[16:32] because he's so humble did you ever see
[16:34] one of these people touch me not and
[16:37] arrogant I've had the privilege of
[16:39] meeting great men in my days been in
[16:42] king's palaces. But when you really find
[16:44] a man that is a great man, he makes you
[16:48] think that you're the great man. But
[16:51] it's the man that just thinks he's a
[16:54] great man that wants to put on a whole
[16:57] lot. That's right. Just a man that's a
[17:00] makeelie. I like that. Now, I I love
[17:03] that quote because that's he's defining
[17:05] what it means to be a to be a great man.
[17:08] knowledge. Knowledge will make you think
[17:10] that a great man is somebody that thinks
[17:12] of themselves a great deal. But he's
[17:14] saying a great man is somebody that
[17:15] makes the other person think that
[17:17] they're a great he lifts up the other
[17:20] person. Now, that's what Paul's
[17:21] expressing in 1 Corinthians chapter 8.
[17:24] You think you know all about how things
[17:26] work and everything, but what about love
[17:28] that just builds one another up and
[17:29] tries to strengthen? A touch me not is
[17:32] is uh you know insul arrogant, insulated
[17:35] by status. I'm somebody afraid to, you
[17:38] know, uh uh recoils back from the from
[17:41] the broken or the unclean. Now, now
[17:43] compare this with the life of Jesus that
[17:46] Jesus let that little woman come up and
[17:47] wash his feet and he didn't recoil back
[17:49] because he thought he was a bit better
[17:50] than her. A touch me not always clawing
[17:53] and scrambling for a platform. But a man
[17:56] that looks like Jesus is is is is is
[17:59] somebody that'll get lower themselves
[18:00] down and wash feet that that touched
[18:04] lepers and and and never needed never
[18:07] not once needed a pulpit to be powerful
[18:10] cuz his life what what is what is Jesus
[18:13] just like just like we were talking
[18:14] about the the shout the voice and the
[18:16] drum that Jesus was the word interpreted
[18:19] or the word lived the word lived. Right.
[18:23] So when Paul says, "If any man think
[18:26] that he knoweth anything, he knoweth
[18:30] nothing yet as he ought to know." So
[18:35] he's saying if somebody thinks they've
[18:36] got it all figured
[18:38] out, they don't really know it the way
[18:40] God
[18:41] expects because the point is humility.
[18:47] The more we truly understand, the more
[18:51] we realize how little we
[18:54] know. You know, isn't that true? Even in
[18:56] life, you'll find somebody that that
[18:58] hardly knows anything about economics
[19:00] and they're just they got it all fig
[19:01] they hardly know anything about politics
[19:03] or whatever. They got it all figured
[19:04] out. But I I remember when I went when I
[19:06] when I went to college, I I'll use that
[19:08] as an example. I sat in the economics
[19:10] class and I thought, I don't know
[19:13] nothing about nothing. You start
[19:14] learning about it and you realize you
[19:17] realize there's so much more to know and
[19:19] it it learning actually act actually
[19:21] actually learning actually actually
[19:24] getting into it makes you humble because
[19:26] you realize there's so much you don't
[19:29] really understand. Right. Amen. And the
[19:31] whole the whole thing is that lower
[19:33] yourself to where you know knowledge
[19:36] when you get so built up in knowledge
[19:38] that you can't you can't learning
[19:40] nothing from nobody cuz you think you've
[19:43] got all the answers. That's right. It's
[19:46] not just what you know but whether God
[19:47] knows you and God knows those who love
[19:50] him. Not just those who can debate
[19:52] theology. Right. What what what is
[19:55] arrogance? Being puffed up as as Paul's
[19:57] explaining there in that first that
[19:59] first couple of scriptures. It's always
[20:01] needing to be right. Now, now here's
[20:04] where here's where it really hits. When
[20:05] when you get in a place where I I got to
[20:07] be right. I I can't I can't just let go
[20:09] and surrender and and and and talk to
[20:12] the other person. I got to be right.
[20:13] It's that unteable spirit where you you
[20:16] can't you can't be instructed in any
[20:19] way. Looking down on others. Well, I got
[20:21] it all figured out and and then you look
[20:23] on down on the other person and it makes
[20:25] all your conversations self-centered and
[20:28] you'll dismiss that weaker brethren. Get
[20:31] get I don't want to even talk to you
[20:32] because you believe in the put it in the
[20:35] Corinthians. You believe that there's
[20:37] something wrong with eating meat that
[20:38] was offered to an idol that's got that
[20:40] sticker that says that it was offered to
[20:42] Diana and and and and you always boast
[20:45] about yourself. I I I was thinking of
[20:47] this
[20:49] when you know uh o over the last few
[20:52] years we we've been at at different
[20:54] churches and and uh and and I was at a
[20:57] church one time where um we'll say it
[20:59] was it was pastored by a bigname
[21:03] preacher and uh you would think that a
[21:07] bigname preacher would come out and be
[21:10] like bless God I'm this I'm that well
[21:13] this bigname preacher come out in the
[21:15] parking lot and was talking to me and
[21:16] all he could all he could talk about was
[21:18] how nervous he was behind the
[21:20] pullpit and and uh he said I I got my
[21:25] notes all laid out and I got out behind
[21:27] the pullpit and I just I I I forgot to
[21:31] read my announcement and and
[21:35] selfdeprecating. He wasn't building
[21:37] himself up at all. And I I began to
[21:40] think, well, you
[21:42] know, you of course, you know, your mind
[21:44] goes to, well, this he's faking
[21:47] it. May maybe I know how people are.
[21:50] They'll think, well, there it's just put
[21:51] on. But listen, he he he was what he
[21:55] was. In other words, real real a real
[21:59] great
[22:00] man actually will actually live in a
[22:04] place of humility where you're willing
[22:06] to open up yourselves. willing to open
[22:09] up uh to lower yourselves and to share
[22:12] to show to show actually the love of
[22:14] Christ. So it's actually the opposite of
[22:17] arrogance is self-exaltation. It refuses
[22:20] to decrease so Christ and increase. It's
[22:23] the opposite of charity love which
[22:25] edifies and serves
[22:27] others. The seventh seal brother says
[22:29] now notice how did I know the other day
[22:31] last Sunday a week ago today when I was
[22:33] preaching on be humble be humble.
[22:35] Remember God deals in little things. I
[22:37] didn't realize what it really was
[22:39] talking about and now I see it. It is in
[22:42] such a humble way. You think that
[22:45] something like that would be revealed to
[22:47] the Vatican or but it just comes just
[22:49] like John the Baptist. It comes like the
[22:51] birth of our Lord in a stable. Glory to
[22:53] God. So help me the hour is at hand.
[22:56] What was humility? Is acknowledging your
[22:59] limitations, giving credit where it's
[23:01] due, taking correction without being
[23:04] defensive.
[23:06] Now, now that there's something to sit
[23:08] on for a while, taking correction
[23:10] without being defensive, that don't mean
[23:12] that you can't fire back and say, "Well,
[23:14] listen, you got the details wrong." But
[23:16] taking correction without being
[23:17] defensive means you're protecting your
[23:19] own image. You're you're saying, "I'm
[23:22] listen, I I'm going to protect my own
[23:24] image at any
[23:26] cost." It's serving serving others
[23:28] without needing recognition is what
[23:30] humility is. Yielding your rights when
[23:33] love demands it. So, what's Paul doing?
[23:35] He's challenging the Corinthians to be
[23:37] loving, not arrogant, seeking to help
[23:40] and
[23:43] edify. Brother Brown said, "And God be
[23:45] if God be with us, then where is all the
[23:47] miracles?" He said, "Many person has
[23:49] been deceived in receiving the Holy
[23:52] Ghost." People fall blindly on there and
[23:55] go through some kind of a sensation,
[23:57] raised back up with a arrogant
[23:59] spirit, indifferent, fussy, high temper.
[24:03] That's not the spirit of God. Still
[24:06] continue right on out of order. Don't
[24:08] what know what church order is. Don't
[24:10] know how to behave themselves in the
[24:12] house of God. No manners. No just no
[24:16] audacity at all. No feelings towards
[24:21] God. All they think
[24:23] about is my church.
[24:26] It shows they received a church spirit
[24:30] and not the spirit of God because it
[24:33] knocks all that out of you. Burns it up.
[24:38] What's Paul talking about? Spiritual
[24:40] arrogance. That simply being correct in
[24:43] doctrine is not enough. That without
[24:45] love, knowledge just becomes prideful
[24:48] and destructive. So true maturity as
[24:52] we're talking true true maturity the
[24:54] life of Christ has got to be expressed
[24:56] in the church and and that show true
[24:58] maturity just shows not just in how much
[25:00] you know but in how the word is
[25:03] expressed in your life how much you care
[25:06] for others and how much you love God.
[25:11] Now let's let's take a step back again
[25:13] cuz I know this starts feeling like the
[25:15] preacher is attacking the people. the
[25:17] the word is attacking all of us. It's
[25:20] attacking me just as well as anybody
[25:23] else to examine our lives and make sure
[25:25] we're measuring up to what the word says
[25:27] we should be. And how so let's keep
[25:30] reading on it as we as we're about to
[25:32] close. In chapter in verse four it says,
[25:34] "As concerning therefore the eating of
[25:36] those things that are offered in
[25:37] sacrifice unto all
[25:40] idols, we know that an idol is nothing
[25:43] in the world, and that there is none
[25:46] other god but one.
[25:49] For though there be that are called
[25:52] gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as
[25:55] there be God's many, and Lord's many,
[25:58] but to us there is but one God, the
[26:01] Father of whom are all things, and we in
[26:04] him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
[26:08] are all things, and we by him. How be
[26:11] it, there is not in every man that
[26:13] knowledge. For some with conscience of
[26:16] the idol unto this hour eat it as a
[26:19] thing offered unto an idol. And their
[26:21] conscience being weak is defiled. But
[26:25] meat commendeth us not to God. For
[26:27] neither if we eat are we the better,
[26:30] neither if we eat not are we the worse.
[26:34] But take heed, lest by any means this
[26:39] liberty of yours become a stumbling
[26:43] block to them that are weak. So it's
[26:47] about your conscience, right? And their
[26:50] conscience, right? This is about
[26:52] appearances and influence. That what
[26:56] you're doing might not be sin in itself,
[26:58] but if it encourages someone else to
[27:01] violate their conscience, it's
[27:04] spiritually reckless.
[27:06] In verse 10 says, "For if any man see
[27:09] thee which hath knowledge to sit at meat
[27:11] in the idol's temple, shall not the
[27:14] conscience of him which is weak be
[27:17] emboldened to eat those things which are
[27:20] offered to idols? You may be right in
[27:23] your
[27:24] knowledge, but if your liberty leads
[27:27] someone else into sin because they
[27:29] followed your example, you've crossed
[27:30] the line." Love limits liberty.
[27:35] Their knowledge that an idol is nothing
[27:37] is correct. But only when exercised in
[27:41] love does this knowledge build up the
[27:44] body of Christ. And we'll stop right
[27:48] there. But the essence of this is that
[27:51] Christianity is living for others. Amen.
[27:55] God bless you, saints.
[27:57] [Applause]
