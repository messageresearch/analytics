[9:10] missing anything I generally do and you
[9:14] know but it's not you know 73 you can't
[9:18] remember everything that's why I write
[9:19] it down what do they say the shortest
[9:21] pencil is longer than the longest memory
[9:24] or something like that to that degree so
[9:27] the older you get you'll start start
[9:29] writing things
[9:31] down when we get where we can't find our
[9:34] way home without writing it down we stop
[9:37] driving okay but we do the best we can
[9:41] okay if you'd like turn in your
[9:42] scriptures turn today to where we've
[9:44] been reading in Romans
[9:46] 8 and then we will go to Isaiah
[9:50] 65 and Genesis 1 Romans 8 Isaiah 65
[9:57] Genesis 1
[10:00] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[10:01] this day and your grace unto us thank
[10:04] you for all things and you give them to
[10:06] us freely so we just pray that you would
[10:09] bless and guide each and every one of us
[10:11] and let your love be made manifest in
[10:13] our hearts in our lives this day that
[10:16] you may be the one to have the
[10:18] preeminence in each one of us we've
[10:20] gathered today for one purpose and that
[10:22] is to hear from you so come Among Us and
[10:25] speak to us in a great way we love you
[10:27] and we thank you bless all of these that
[10:29] are not here by traveling and different
[10:31] things and bless those that are sick and
[10:34] just reach down and touch each one you
[10:37] said it you sent your word and healed us
[10:39] so we believe it it's already there Lord
[10:42] and we believe it guide us now and have
[10:44] your way forgive our sins more than
[10:46] anything else because we want to stand
[10:48] complete in you we love you and we thank
[10:51] you in Jesus name
[10:54] amen I know maybe Joe and him's up this
[10:58] morning and we say hi to them and all
[11:02] pray the Lord would bless them and take
[11:05] care of them uh we miss
[11:12] Jonas I ain't saying we don't miss the
[11:14] rest of them but we miss Jonas I go out
[11:17] and and uh put water in all of for the
[11:20] Virginia and every day she says Jonas
[11:23] Jonas Jonas so we're trying to maybe get
[11:27] him back home right okay Romans
[11:30] 8 28 and we know that all things work
[11:33] together for good to them that love God
[11:35] to them who are the called according to
[11:37] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[11:41] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[11:44] the image of his son that he might be
[11:45] the firstborn among many Brethren
[11:48] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[11:50] he also called and whom he called them
[11:52] he also Justified and whom he justified
[11:56] them he also
[11:57] glorified what what shall we then say to
[12:00] these things if God be for us who can be
[12:04] against
[12:05] us amen
[12:08] Isaiah
[12:10] 65 we'll begin reading at verse
[12:14] 17 and I know this goes into the
[12:16] Millennium and all but that's the
[12:18] purpose that you'll see in the minute of
[12:19] the scripture for behold I create new
[12:21] heavens and a new Earth and the former
[12:24] shall be remembered shall not be
[12:26] remembered nor coming into mine but be
[12:29] you glad and rejoice for ever in that
[12:32] which I create for behold I create
[12:35] Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people of
[12:37] Joy I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy
[12:41] in my people and the voice of weeping
[12:43] shall be no more heard in her nor the
[12:46] voice of crying there shall be no more
[12:49] then an infin of days nor an old man
[12:52] that shall not fulfill his that hath not
[12:56] fulfilled his days for the child shall D
[12:59] in 100 years old but the sinner being
[13:01] 100 years old shall be a cursed and they
[13:04] shall build houses and inhabit them they
[13:07] shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit
[13:09] of
[13:10] them they shall not build and another
[13:13] inhabit now that's a wonderful promise
[13:15] ain't nobody can't take away from you
[13:17] what's yours they shall not plant and
[13:20] another eat far as the days of a tree
[13:23] are the days of my people and my elect
[13:26] shall long enjoy the work of their hands
[13:29] they shall not labor in vain nor bring
[13:32] forth for
[13:35] trouble for they are the seed of the
[13:37] Blessed of the Lord and their offspring
[13:40] with them now that's the point we're
[13:42] getting to for they are the seed of the
[13:45] Blessed of the Lord and their offspring
[13:48] with them now if if it's a seed and then
[13:51] you get your
[13:53] Offspring see if you read that correctly
[13:55] and understand you can claim your
[13:58] children
[13:59] right in Christ all
[14:02] right see because then you're Offspring
[14:05] with you because if you're the seed
[14:08] they're the
[14:09] seed right come on that that's these are
[14:12] the scriptures brother around them used
[14:14] when he was preaching the spoken word is
[14:16] the Original Seed okay and it shall come
[14:19] to F before they call I will answer and
[14:22] while they are speaking I will hear okay
[14:25] now one more because these are the
[14:27] scriptures brother randam used on the
[14:29] spoken word is the Original Seed and
[14:31] we're just reading part of it so we go
[14:33] to
[14:34] Genesis
[14:37] 1:9 and God said let the waters under
[14:40] the heavens be gathered together into
[14:41] one place and let the dry land appear
[14:43] and it was so and God called a dry land
[14:46] Earth and the Gathering Together the
[14:48] waters Waters called his seas and God
[14:50] saw that it was good and God said let
[14:53] the Earth bring forth Grace the herb
[14:56] yielding seed and the fruit tree yeld
[14:58] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[15:02] is in
[15:04] itself now once it's after its kind why
[15:07] because the seed is in
[15:09] itself upon the Earth and it was so and
[15:12] the Earth brought forth grass and Herb
[15:14] yielding seed after his kind and the
[15:17] tree yielding fruit whose seed was in
[15:19] itself after his kind and God saw that
[15:23] it was good and the morning and the
[15:25] evening was the third day you may be
[15:27] seated The Lord At His blessing to the
[15:29] reading of the
[15:31] word
[15:34] now as I said we will get down into it
[15:38] talking about it but these are the
[15:40] scriptures the Isaiah and Genesis that
[15:43] brother RAM used when he was preaching
[15:46] the spoken word is the Original
[15:49] Seed all right now we we tried this past
[15:54] last weekend because we didn't have any
[15:56] servic our
[15:57] Wednesday
[15:59] but we were trying to get a point to us
[16:04] and to understand something because to
[16:06] me
[16:08] now one of these days you'll see why
[16:10] that I have put so many
[16:13] services into a
[16:16] lineup to uh be able to
[16:20] understand what the prophet was talking
[16:23] about CU we believe what he said he said
[16:27] you come here with a seed in you I
[16:29] believe
[16:30] that but I don't believe that like a lot
[16:34] of people believe
[16:35] it you know I I believe that there
[16:40] is an eternal
[16:43] judgment I believe there is an eternal
[16:48] condemnation and that's what people
[16:50] believes and see they go on and believe
[16:52] there's an eternal hell I don't believe
[16:54] that do you understand what I'm saying I
[16:56] don't believe that I believe in Eternal
[16:59] judgment because once you're judged it's
[17:02] done I believe in Eternal condemnation
[17:04] if you're condemned it's done ain't
[17:07] nothing you can do about it it's
[17:08] finished all right I believe that and
[17:11] like I said I believe what the prophet
[17:13] said when he said you come here with a
[17:15] seed in
[17:16] you I believe that I just don't believe
[17:19] what most people make
[17:22] that all right so we're laying down a
[17:25] lot of foundation now to be able to
[17:28] really
[17:29] understand
[17:32] predestination and understand how
[17:34] everything fits together all right now
[17:37] this past Sunday we were talking about
[17:40] what that brother Bram says page 80 of
[17:42] the old Hebrew is page two uh paragraph
[17:46] 2 um 79 of the Hebrew chapter 2 57 825
[17:53] now these are not up so not these are
[17:56] just quotes that I've done before that
[17:58] I'm doing over he said the soul that was
[18:00] in the
[18:01] man the difference between a man and an
[18:04] animal God put a soul in a man he didn't
[18:07] put it in the
[18:08] animal he said because the soul that was
[18:10] in the man is that
[18:13] theophany all right
[18:16] now see we want to go
[18:21] with the thought then we were trying to
[18:23] express
[18:25] Sunday as we try to go over in the
[18:27] Corinth and we say but we have one
[18:31] waiting you know well I agree with that
[18:34] I believe that I believe the scriptures
[18:36] right
[18:38] right but I believe those that He
[18:42] predestinated those he called he's
[18:44] already done it that's right I believe
[18:46] it's already finished don't you as far
[18:48] as God is concerned amen all right we do
[18:53] have a
[18:56] theophany a finished theop would be the
[18:59] mind of
[19:00] God in
[19:03] reality but you got too much
[19:06] understanding see to pull away and
[19:09] that's what I'm trying to make see the
[19:11] prophet says your soul is you
[19:14] theophany he said well I don't believe
[19:16] that
[19:18] well he
[19:20] said that Jesus his soul his Spirit his
[19:24] theophany of his being message in tum 57
[19:29] was what went to
[19:31] hell he
[19:33] said that Jesus preached to the souls in
[19:39] prison in the same kind of a body that
[19:44] he saw the glorified ones in the other
[19:50] night well
[19:52] now what was in
[19:54] hell did that was adoption 19
[19:59] 60 what
[20:01] did in other words we can believe that
[20:04] Jesus went and preached to the souls and
[20:06] prison right right we know the scripture
[20:08] says spirits but your Prophet said so
[20:11] because the word soul and Spirits
[20:12] interchangeable right all right so
[20:17] then why do we argue the point but
[20:21] Brother D I just can't see what you're
[20:23] getting at that your soul is your
[20:24] theophany well what is it come on what
[20:28] is a
[20:33] theophany what is a
[20:36] theophany you look up the word in your
[20:38] dictionary and it'll show you that it's
[20:40] the body of a deity right you know just
[20:44] simple language right all right you know
[20:47] we used to have in our
[20:49] soul the devil you agree with that right
[20:53] I believe that all
[20:57] right
[20:58] and he was our
[21:00] God and we served him
[21:04] amen and we were the
[21:06] body not talking about this
[21:10] now cuz you see that's where I don't
[21:12] believe like most people I believe the
[21:14] soul is a real
[21:16] you what your Prophet said if it's a
[21:19] real you it's more real than this body
[21:21] this spirit this wood this metal this
[21:26] anything but it's not your
[21:29] spirit is going to have to be destroyed
[21:31] one
[21:33] day it's not your
[21:35] body it's the soul the soul is a real
[21:38] you right well brother Dale I'm just a
[21:42] body spirit and soul that's what I am
[21:44] all right that's a TR being like God is
[21:47] father son Holy Ghost that's
[21:49] fine but remember it has to be divided
[21:52] right if it's not
[21:55] divided you got a problem right go tell
[21:59] me where sin lies and you tell me you
[22:01] don't sin I'm going to call you a liar
[22:03] and read to you what the Bible and the
[22:05] prophet says where he said he sinned
[22:07] every day so you can argue with
[22:10] him yeah but you just pull the quotes
[22:13] well what do you
[22:16] pull but see your soul is that real you
[22:20] that's right the Bible said All Souls
[22:23] Ezekiel 18:4 All Souls are mine Satan
[22:27] can't create
[22:30] right he only
[22:33] perverts he can't give you a soul that's
[22:36] right but he can pervert the nature
[22:39] right of your soul amen cuz that's what
[22:42] happened when we come into the world we
[22:44] born into the world see we're born as
[22:47] perfect as God can create which is no
[22:49] problems with it right but then Satan
[22:54] comes along and perverts the
[22:56] nature well brother Dale I've always
[22:59] just believ the Soul's just the nature
[23:00] of the spirit there is no quote the soul
[23:03] is just the nature of the spirit I want
[23:05] you to bring that to
[23:07] me see that means it's nothing but when
[23:11] you say the soul is the nature of the
[23:13] spirit now you're getting it correct cuz
[23:15] that's what the prophet
[23:17] said but you see people say well I know
[23:20] it's in
[23:22] there I've done this for 40 something
[23:24] years I want to read
[23:25] it I want to read it's just the nature
[23:28] of the spirit because that means it's
[23:30] just something floating around it's just
[23:32] nothing tangible nothing
[23:35] real it's just a nature of something
[23:38] bird dog horse cow whatever got a nature
[23:42] about it you know how to teach a bird
[23:44] dog to point he's born with a nature to
[23:46] do it but a hound dog if he points you
[23:49] better go run your lineage back he's got
[23:52] a bird dog somewhere right my
[23:54] brother-in-law we had he had an old dog
[23:56] at you know made it up with the wrong
[23:59] one and come out of it and boy there
[24:01] some of was
[24:04] pretty it was just an old
[24:07] hound but he one day we was all over
[24:09] there hunting on the side of the road
[24:11] bird hunting and and he had that old
[24:13] hound that was a bird dog looking and
[24:15] and that thing just standing on the road
[24:17] just right off the road just pointed
[24:18] right at these birds while these other
[24:20] dogs were pointing and Miss mam stopped
[24:24] well man he jumped out and he just
[24:25] looked at that dog and he said I want to
[24:28] buy
[24:28] it my brother long said it ain't for
[24:33] sale when that man left he had the bird
[24:36] dog my brother-in-law had every dime he
[24:39] had and the spark tire off his
[24:43] car see that nature some way went down
[24:47] through and it come
[24:49] out but see it's
[24:52] just just a nature that's what we want
[24:55] to make it but I've tried my best for 40
[24:57] something years to
[24:59] preach to me a soul is the real
[25:03] you is what you are it will live on
[25:07] after you
[25:09] die don't fear him that can destroy the
[25:12] body right and spirit fear him that can
[25:15] destroy the
[25:17] soul why because only God can do that
[25:20] but Satan can't
[25:22] create but he perverts everything see
[25:26] that's when I trying to get to last
[25:30] Sunday brother randam
[25:33] says that the angel of the Lord is which
[25:36] he's referring
[25:38] to
[25:40] right in a
[25:42] message let me see if I can find it here
[25:44] but he said the angel of the Lord said
[25:46] solds under the altar cuz that's who
[25:49] he's talking to when he's beyond the
[25:50] curtain of time sold under the altar he
[25:53] said they were there in theophany that's
[25:56] right well well is the theophany in the
[25:59] soul is the soul in the or is it
[26:03] one brother brother said his soul his
[26:06] Spirit his theophany of his
[26:09] being and we know the body of Jesus
[26:11] never went to
[26:15] hell but it was his being is what we
[26:20] are yeah but I thought we had one beyond
[26:23] the curtain of time I mean Beyond I
[26:25] thought we had one up in heaven that's a
[26:27] positive God's
[26:29] mine that's
[26:33] simple we receive the new birth right
[26:37] right here at Faith does that mean you
[26:39] have the
[26:40] headstone no but it means you got a
[26:43] connection that's right and that
[26:45] headstone starts pulling yes that that's
[26:48] beyond the curtain of
[26:50] time is pulling you an eye
[26:56] amen see positive all right but see your
[27:00] soul then is your
[27:03] theophany and that being your theophany
[27:06] it's being it's the real
[27:09] you see you said but but brother Dale
[27:12] you you can't use uh Souls under the
[27:15] altar well brother Brandon was really
[27:17] easy to use it 1965 on things that uh
[27:20] trying to do God a service without his
[27:22] will he said if this Earthly Tabernacle
[27:25] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[27:29] the good Heavenly Father permitted me to
[27:31] walk behind that curtain one day and see
[27:36] it have many heard the see look in a pis
[27:40] the curtain of time there it was just
[27:43] the same as I'm preaching to you all
[27:46] there they stood Soul under the
[27:50] altar crying how long not just a man
[27:55] myth but somebody who had
[27:59] intelligence but but but I I thought so
[28:02] on the alar was F you it is when you say
[28:05] to avenge our
[28:07] blood that's the way brother random
[28:09] defined it he said that's not the bride
[28:13] where it saids how long how long to
[28:15] avenge our blood he said we don't cry
[28:18] that we're forgiving
[28:20] people would you see then why is it we
[28:24] can't believe
[28:26] it
[28:29] 40 something years I've been trying to
[28:31] explain
[28:33] that Souls under the altar crying how
[28:38] long the soul of man is the real you
[28:42] right it's what you
[28:45] are you heard brother R said you can't
[28:47] see me he said I'm inside this body
[28:53] right something is motivating you and I
[28:56] amen right
[28:58] we either have an upper pull or an
[29:00] underpull you agree with that cuz that's
[29:03] what he said we're either being pulled
[29:04] down or we're pulled up that's right all
[29:06] right so that means that if we're going
[29:09] down
[29:12] we we're going to the wrong place but
[29:15] that's the
[29:18] soul see your body and your
[29:20] spirit is not the point because as I
[29:24] said about what is it Ezekiel when you
[29:25] get over there or what the scripture
[29:27] there where don't about I give you a new
[29:28] heart a new spirit that's right brother
[29:31] said that ain't the Holy
[29:33] Spirit he said give you a new heart he
[29:35] said because you can't stand yourself he
[29:37] said give you a new spirit it's not take
[29:39] your spirit out and put another spirit
[29:44] in no it's just working on the nature of
[29:47] it but he said then I put my spirit in
[29:51] you he said that's the Holy Spirit
[29:54] right I gave you the quote where brother
[29:56] around and said he sent back his soul on
[29:58] the day of
[30:01] Pentecost in the form of the baptism of
[30:03] the Holy Ghost he said when that's give
[30:06] out down through then the Rapture will
[30:11] come I'm not trying to deal with your
[30:13] body right not trying to deal with your
[30:17] spirit that's where most preachers
[30:19] preach and you know that's true that's
[30:21] right oh you need to do you need to do
[30:24] oh yeah and then like brother Ram like I
[30:26] said the other day
[30:28] brother said don't you go down too there
[30:30] and try to talk them people into coming
[30:32] to the Altar and begging them and
[30:33] telling them grandma died and goone to
[30:35] Heaven if you want to go to heaven with
[30:37] Grandma you got to go to you got to
[30:38] believe it he said don't do that amen
[30:41] what are you dealing with body and
[30:43] spirit
[30:45] right just walk right up to people and
[30:47] tell them you're
[30:51] lost right but brother Dale I love the
[30:55] Lord you love with your spirit that's
[30:57] right that's right that's one of the
[30:59] senses of your spirit that's
[31:02] right the soul only has one sense either
[31:06] Faith or doubt you're either born again
[31:08] or lost there's no gray
[31:12] area right there's no in
[31:16] between well I I've tried to do this
[31:18] yeah that's good that's started in the W
[31:20] that's cleaning out of that place for
[31:22] God to come to abide but you see what
[31:25] I'm talking about yes
[31:29] see then that way your soul is the real
[31:35] you and see like I said now go over it
[31:37] again he said but I thought it was up
[31:39] there well let me ask you a question the
[31:41] Bible says we have one Eternal in the
[31:45] heavens is that the scripture there in
[31:48] Corinthians now do you have eternal life
[31:50] up there and you have eternal life down
[31:55] here I mean you don't think like that I
[31:58] know but that's just my way of thinking
[32:01] if there's eternal life up there and
[32:03] eternal life down here I got a
[32:08] problem but if there's eternal life in
[32:11] here and God in heaven drawing me to
[32:15] that positive that I'm supposed to
[32:17] be then I got
[32:21] hopes because it's something real that's
[32:25] right it's not just a a a a myth or a
[32:29] thought brother brandom actually felt
[32:31] them people beyond the curtain of time
[32:33] he said they were there in their senses
[32:36] I even used to I didn't believe that I'm
[32:39] as honest as I can be I don't mind
[32:40] telling you you know because the reason
[32:42] I do it because that way maybe somebody
[32:44] else thought that away right I used to
[32:47] think that the soul of the individual
[32:49] you know beyond the curtain of time had
[32:50] no
[32:53] feelings but I kept reading that's right
[32:56] that's right
[32:57] and I kept reading and I found what the
[32:59] prophet said to do yes so I come to the
[33:02] church here and told you I was
[33:07] wrong because they are more real than we
[33:12] are those people beyond the curtain of
[33:14] time are more real than you and I you
[33:17] said well what are the end a theoy
[33:20] body which is their soul
[33:24] yes see your soul is what you really are
[33:27] your theophany
[33:29] body and those in hell are in their
[33:33] theophany brother R called it that come
[33:36] on
[33:42] yes you think it's not what about the
[33:46] adoption where he
[33:47] says only read part of it he preached to
[33:51] that same kind of body see he said they
[33:54] had senses now listen he he went to hell
[33:57] and preached to the souls in
[34:02] prison how did he do it he had senses of
[34:06] feeling he had sens of hearing he had
[34:07] senses of speech he preached with that
[34:10] same kind of body I saw those glorified
[34:13] ones in the other
[34:15] night he preached to the souls that were
[34:18] in Hell
[34:20] amen what were they
[34:25] in he went and preached that theophany
[34:28] that body that went and preached to the
[34:31] souls that were in prison and repented
[34:33] not in the
[34:37] longsuffering but see do we believe
[34:40] it see church I'm trying my best to
[34:43] preach eternal
[34:46] life eternal life is
[34:50] real I don't want just an anointing on
[34:52] my spirit
[34:54] amen I don't want to just say I love God
[34:57] come
[34:59] on I want his
[35:01] word I want his being of his person
[35:04] living in me right in a new
[35:08] birth see then I don't have to
[35:11] worry I'm not captivated by the world
[35:14] and the things of the world we live here
[35:20] okay but there's a difference in us why
[35:23] because something on the inside yes is
[35:28] different all
[35:30] right but listen
[35:35] church let me go on the end of the
[35:37] thought now that was just a background
[35:43] part I know it's been taught by most
[35:46] people in the message one form or the
[35:49] other about how that you were born with
[35:51] a seed in
[35:54] you and uh
[35:58] some teach that that seed was always
[36:02] Eternal you're two Soul people back
[36:04] there that's the reason when they were
[36:06] talking about two Souls I was studying
[36:09] about the soul of
[36:11] God and I tried to talk to him about it
[36:15] and he said well Soul just the nature of
[36:16] the spirit I said okay let's go over to
[36:19] souls in prison where brother BR said
[36:21] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[36:23] born again but said if it's not it's of
[36:26] the world World stand up in
[36:28] Jeffersonville Indiana the man looked at
[36:29] me said how can you how can you nature
[36:31] have a nature I said why don't you talk
[36:34] to the
[36:36] prophet he was the one that said it not
[36:39] me he'll tell you you know but you see
[36:46] church we just take quotes
[36:51] yes and just make a
[36:54] quote and think we know what we're
[36:56] talking
[36:59] about well let me give you a
[37:01] scripture and just see what you
[37:05] think Jesus one day
[37:11] said I chose
[37:15] you 12 that's right the
[37:18] Bible he said I chose you 12 he just got
[37:22] through talking about whether they were
[37:24] saying it was great you know this that
[37:26] and the other he said don't be do that
[37:28] but said Rejoice CU your name is written
[37:30] in heaven and he said I chose you
[37:37] 12 and he said one of you is the devil
[37:40] that's
[37:44] right that hit me the other
[37:49] dayk you father well now brother D what
[37:53] that is he chose for him to be the devil
[37:56] you've done messed
[37:59] up because you made God making him the
[38:03] devil and he didn't make him to devil so
[38:06] you just went wrong with it you better
[38:08] wake up he said I chose
[38:14] you judas's name was written in
[38:17] heaven he had a part of the ministry
[38:20] that's
[38:21] right and he said I chose
[38:24] you we'll get back to that one of these
[38:27] days cuz there's more to it than just
[38:29] that but I'm just leaving that see you
[38:32] say well you know you just quote a quote
[38:34] you just gra
[38:36] scripture
[38:38] why what's it
[38:42] doing so I believe all them quotes
[38:44] brother there where where brother Brown
[38:46] said was come here with a seed in
[38:55] US
[38:58] when was it put
[39:07] there according
[39:09] to why Christ speak
[39:13] 1963 7:14 the morning
[39:16] service which is after the opening of
[39:18] the seals right
[39:23] you God in his Mercy before the
[39:25] foundation of the World saw me and
[39:29] placed a little seed in
[39:35] there before the foundation of the
[39:39] world
[39:42] okay now was there anything physical
[39:45] before the foundation of the
[39:48] world well why is everybody want to deal
[39:50] with a physical
[39:55] seed
[39:57] we'll get back to that quote
[39:59] later month or two in the next year I
[40:06] guess but if you was born here with a
[40:09] seed in you where when
[40:13] would when was it put there well when I
[40:16] was born it was put there the prophet
[40:18] didn't say
[40:20] that he said it was put there before the
[40:23] foundation of the
[40:25] world
[40:28] now then with all that in mind I ask you
[40:32] a simple
[40:34] question what is the seed of
[40:41] God what is the seed of
[40:47] God does God
[40:49] have a
[40:53] literal uh how can I say it uh 16
[40:57] elements human you know
[41:01] whatever or does he
[41:05] create did he have 16
[41:08] elements or did he create 16
[41:13] elements so what is the seed of God we
[41:15] said well the seat of God is the word of
[41:17] God Amen we're going to we're going to
[41:19] talk about that but we're going to talk
[41:21] about it in a way that maybe you hadn't
[41:24] thought of
[41:28] what is the seed of
[41:32] God so then I'm asking you the
[41:36] question does God have a literal
[41:40] seed or does he
[41:45] create now if you're going to go to a
[41:47] had a literal then you got a problem
[41:49] with the Virgin Mary and and you're
[41:51] going to have to
[41:53] have God having intercourse with Mary
[41:58] uh plain but
[42:00] true it's true that's right but if it's
[42:03] his
[42:04] word that can create that's
[42:08] right then he created that's right in
[42:12] the wound of
[42:15] Mary the egg and The
[42:18] Germ
[42:22] right just don't think that I'm not
[42:24] making it the way that it is true
[42:26] because
[42:30] listen God is more real than any
[42:33] tangible elements we can think of that's
[42:35] right I've tried my best to get you to
[42:37] see that oh God is a
[42:42] spirit is he just floating
[42:45] around now brother brand said he's a
[42:47] being right he's not like the wind he
[42:53] says he said he's really not even
[42:55] omnipresent
[42:57] present see if it was wind it could just
[42:59] be everywhere he said
[43:02] because he's a being right right but
[43:07] said he's omnipresent in the basis he's
[43:10] omniscient he knows to be there if
[43:13] there's anybody up on the moon he has to
[43:14] be up there to make a record that's
[43:16] right but if there's nobody up there
[43:17] they don't have to be up
[43:19] there but you see that's what I'm trying
[43:21] to get you to see he's
[43:23] real and get you to see the new birth is
[43:25] real
[43:26] yes
[43:28] amen it's not an imagination or a
[43:31] thought or a good concept or or change
[43:34] of life
[43:35] amen it's not an alcoholic synonymous
[43:38] that puts you through rules and or like
[43:41] the school are today trying to make the
[43:43] kids s to to remain you know
[43:49] virgins try to make them to make
[43:53] commitments because they've learned if
[43:55] they get them to make commitments and
[43:57] they get 10,000 to make them about one
[43:59] or two will keep
[44:04] it but how real is God to
[44:11] you well brother D it's just a Spirit
[44:13] came in me praise the
[44:17] Lord I remember brother Tatum I remember
[44:19] a lot of your experiences remember
[44:21] brother Tatum sitting out I believe was
[44:22] under an apple tree I'm not certain but
[44:25] he's sitting there and he said just like
[44:26] raindrops falling on you oh glory to I
[44:29] believe in
[44:31] that I believe in that I believe in his
[44:35] presence I've smelled him I've seen him
[44:37] i' I don't have to worry about
[44:40] it I know he's real but he's more real
[44:43] than just the thoughts of your mind
[44:46] that's right that's
[44:52] right think on
[44:54] it what is thece of
[44:57] God if he doesn't have a physical
[45:00] mankind like elements of
[45:05] that but that his elements are so much
[45:07] greater than
[45:09] this to leave a theophany brother
[45:12] Brandman explaining it I've read it to
[45:13] you over and over he said a better
[45:17] eye that theop body has a better eye he
[45:21] said a better sense of hearing and
[45:23] feelings and things in a theophany
[45:31] but you see Church what is God's
[45:36] seed he said well that's his word well
[45:38] amen all right now let's take that
[45:40] thought and dwell on it maybe the rest
[45:42] of the whole
[45:46] day because what does it mean to say
[45:49] that God's the seed is the word of God
[45:52] go ahead and pull up number two I guess
[45:55] it's
[45:59] Satan does not have a seed we've been
[46:02] through that you
[46:04] remember you remember how we brought it
[46:07] out from the church a book that Satan
[46:08] doesn't have a
[46:10] seed because he could not enter the
[46:13] human race that's right of a seed he's
[46:17] an Angelic being the prophet
[46:20] says he doesn't have a soul that's
[46:24] right yet there is a quote brother
[46:26] around said about his soul he doesn't
[46:29] have a body as a man yet the Bible says
[46:33] he's a man but what's it
[46:36] describing he's an Angelic being Angels
[46:39] don't have
[46:45] souls
[46:48] even the
[46:50] Beast
[46:52] what he had a place for a soul
[46:56] but he didn't have
[46:59] one but here comes
[47:03] Cain with a
[47:06] soul why because God created he said All
[47:10] Souls are mine
[47:14] right right so
[47:18] then Satan cannot create cuz he's an
[47:21] Angelic
[47:24] being
[47:26] but God is not to just say an Angelic
[47:29] being God is
[47:32] real and he can create yes and did
[47:36] create world and all kind of I've got
[47:39] one somewhere that I'd love it I looking
[47:41] at it this morning again where brother
[47:43] brother Brown talking about the word of
[47:45] God and how that he spoke them things
[47:47] into existence and he said he didn't
[47:49] have anywh for it to come from he said
[47:52] but his word said
[47:54] it
[47:58] the Bible says what did he created out
[48:01] of
[48:04] right it wasn't something somewhere else
[48:07] for him to create it from that's right
[48:10] he spoke his
[48:11] word look what he says here in
[48:15] Luke in our
[48:18] thought Luke
[48:22] 8 verse
[48:24] 9-15
[48:26] and this is the parable now this is not
[48:28] the parable there you remember there's
[48:31] two ways of expressing the parable one
[48:33] of them is the so went forth the SE and
[48:35] it's the children of the Kingdom we'll
[48:37] get to that all right but then he got
[48:40] the tires which is the children of the
[48:43] wicked we'll get to that all right but
[48:45] this is the parable of the so that went
[48:47] forth to
[48:49] seow and what what he said and his
[48:51] disciples asked him saying what might
[48:53] this Parable be and he said unto you it
[48:56] is given to know the mysteries of the
[48:57] kingdom of God but to others in Parables
[49:00] that seeing they might not see and
[49:02] hearing they might not
[49:05] understand now the parable is this the
[49:09] seed is the word of
[49:13] God those by the wayside are they that
[49:18] hear we'll get to that in a few minutes
[49:21] remember they
[49:23] here then comes to devil and taketh away
[49:26] the
[49:27] word out of their
[49:31] hearts now are you going to tell me that
[49:33] the Pharisees didn't have the letter
[49:38] Perfect come
[49:41] on they had it letter perfect
[49:44] right and killed the god of the
[49:48] word
[49:50] okay but you
[49:52] see those by the wayside are they that
[49:55] he here then cometh the devil and taketh
[49:57] away the word out of their hearts lest
[49:59] they should believe and be
[50:01] saved and they on the rocks are they
[50:04] which when they
[50:06] hear receive the word with
[50:12] joy and these have no
[50:20] root which were a while
[50:23] believe in the time of Temptation fall
[50:28] away and they which fell among Thorns
[50:31] are they when they have
[50:36] heard go
[50:40] forth preachers
[50:43] right and are choke with the cares and
[50:46] riches and pleasures of this life and
[50:49] bring no fruit to Perfection that's
[50:51] right now are you with me yes
[50:57] they have the
[51:00] word the Pharisees had the
[51:04] word right see one of these days you're
[51:06] going to find out what brother R was
[51:08] saying and you're going to realize he's
[51:12] right he said the Baptist has got the
[51:15] word now bless God they don't have the
[51:17] word they don't they they
[51:21] believe your Prophet said
[51:24] it
[51:26] they read the same Bible you
[51:31] read they have the letter of the
[51:35] word the letter of the word says baptize
[51:38] in the name of the father of the Son and
[51:41] the Holy Ghost that's
[51:45] right and that's what they do amen
[51:52] yes but they just don't know the truth
[51:57] how much do we
[52:00] know why there so much split in this
[52:02] message oh my when there's only one
[52:05] message I used to bother me when I was
[52:07] in the Baptist why there was so many
[52:08] different denominations in one
[52:12] Bible I come in this message find out
[52:14] they worse than all of the denominations
[52:15] there was put
[52:20] together but think about
[52:23] it and they bring no fruit Ro to
[52:25] Perfection so evidently they get
[52:29] started right come
[52:33] on why does the bible say that that's
[52:38] right it starts growing but the cares of
[52:41] life and things choke it out right I
[52:45] planted okra this year it rained so much
[52:49] the okra came up it like that but the
[52:51] weeds was like that so when it finished
[52:54] up the weeds was like this and the okra
[52:56] was somewhere in there and the bushog
[52:58] got the rest of
[53:01] it cuz it was nothing I could get
[53:05] to are you looking at
[53:08] it when they have heard go
[53:11] forth how about all the people in this
[53:13] message you can think
[53:15] of that stuck with it for a while yes
[53:19] and what about now right when they're
[53:22] falling away like crazy yeah
[53:26] if you don't believe that go home look
[53:28] on the internet and
[53:29] see and boy they're proving him to be
[53:31] wrong they proving this to be that they
[53:34] arguing over that this that or the other
[53:37] the people that were the ones that
[53:40] brought you and I into the message right
[53:44] amen
[53:49] right all
[53:52] right these people start
[53:56] and it grows a
[53:59] little but then all the things takes
[54:03] over verse 15 but that on the good
[54:06] ground are they which in an honest
[54:10] heart on excuse me and good heart like
[54:15] that having heard the
[54:17] word keep
[54:21] it how long did they keep it about 3 and
[54:24] 1/2 years
[54:29] right are we talking about the disciples
[54:32] and then how long did you hear it and
[54:33] keep it but how long did the disciples
[54:36] keep the
[54:37] word and keep it remember what they said
[54:42] we don't know he said why don't you go
[54:43] to you know rest of them go in
[54:47] 70 walked away he said why don't you
[54:50] go well a one thing left we know you got
[54:53] the word of eternal life and we just
[54:56] going to hang
[54:57] around
[54:59] right and keep it and bring forth fruit
[55:02] with
[55:03] patience so what is the seat of
[55:12] God me this afternoon I know now
[55:19] but is everything you read out of the
[55:21] Bible now I'm asking you a question and
[55:23] you're going to have to bear withen now
[55:25] when you sit down and read the
[55:29] Bible do you believe that's the word of
[55:33] God
[55:35] Amen that's fine that's
[55:39] good but can the word of God
[55:42] say baptize in the name of father son
[55:44] Holy Ghost and Lord Jesus
[55:54] Christ
[55:56] you see that's why I'm glad God sent a
[55:58] prophet right cuz you know what the
[55:59] prophet said one
[56:03] day he
[56:05] said the only way you can
[56:08] baptize in the name of the father Son
[56:12] and Holy Ghost is to baptize in the name
[56:15] of the Lord Jesus
[56:16] Christ right you notice when I baptize
[56:20] you what I
[56:22] say to fulfill the Great commission to
[56:26] baptize you in the name of the Father
[56:27] the Son I now baptize you in the name of
[56:29] the Lord Jesus
[56:35] Christ you so bless God I don't want to
[56:37] be baptized no father son Holy
[56:40] Ghost if you're baptized in the name of
[56:42] the Lord Jesus Christ you got to be
[56:44] baptized in the name of the father Son
[56:46] and the Holy Ghost or either you're
[56:47] saying one's wrong the other one's right
[56:51] now you're arguing with the
[56:53] word
[56:56] come on you're arguing with the
[57:04] word
[57:06] remember we're talking about the seat of
[57:12] God so does it save
[57:16] you to hear the
[57:21] word now you got to hear it but does it
[57:24] save you to hear
[57:26] it something's got to happen to it
[57:32] right now I know I won't get to it this
[57:35] morning
[57:39] but why is
[57:43] it I I heard it so many times in the
[57:45] Baptist Church preached in Romans 8 I
[57:47] believe it is or 6 or8 where it talks
[57:49] about the word and and the things you
[57:51] hear and and the the you know with your
[57:54] mouth you can f
[57:55] yes I heard that so many times I didn't
[57:57] really want to read
[58:00] it I'm
[58:02] honest I'm calling up brother Tatum
[58:04] brother Tatum said he began to hear
[58:06] about it and he said I used to read
[58:08] Matthew 28:19 and he said I'd get over
[58:11] to acts 238 he said I'd turn real
[58:14] fast I got some tickle cuz I know what
[58:16] he's talking about
[58:23] amen but see it's not just believing in
[58:26] your
[58:28] heart if you believe in your heart won't
[58:30] confess with your mouth what are you
[58:33] hypocrite that's right not saved that's
[58:38] right but why is it that
[58:41] everybody that
[58:43] says you know what I'm talking about
[58:45] alter call and people come up do you
[58:47] believe that Jesus Christ is Son of God
[58:50] yes I believe
[58:52] it why is it that everybody's not saved
[58:55] it says that
[58:57] right you know that is God's
[59:01] word may me not letter you know
[59:03] verbatims but you know what I'm talking
[59:06] about what's the
[59:11] problem so it must
[59:16] be
[59:17] that letters on a
[59:23] page is not what the Bible
[59:28] is we get today a while or this
[59:31] afternoon because Paul said what he said
[59:34] the letter kth that's
[59:36] right the spirit giveth
[59:39] life
[59:42] now why is
[59:46] it I'm asking you a question
[59:50] now anointed ones or Anointed with the
[59:54] genuine Holy Spirit you agree do we need
[59:57] to go back and prove all that we've been
[59:59] through all of it you agree anointed
[1:00:02] ones are anointed with a genuine Holy
[1:00:05] Spirit if that Holy Spirit can come down
[1:00:08] upon you and anoint you come on why did
[1:00:12] it not give life to the word come
[1:00:15] on cuz you're not talking about
[1:00:17] anointing falling out here just average
[1:00:20] Joe person walking down the road
[1:00:22] right you're talking about religious
[1:00:24] real
[1:00:26] right you know when he says he poured
[1:00:29] out his Spirit upon All Flesh that
[1:00:31] doesn't mean he poured out on every body
[1:00:33] right he pour it out on the
[1:00:35] religious
[1:00:38] part
[1:00:43] right why is it that that anointing does
[1:00:46] not give life to the
[1:00:53] word
[1:00:56] they you me all of
[1:00:59] us we walk down to the
[1:01:02] Altar and the preacher said do you
[1:01:04] believe that Jesus Christ is a Son of
[1:01:06] God and he died for your
[1:01:09] sins and you say
[1:01:14] yes
[1:01:16] well is it not true that the biggest
[1:01:20] portion some receive the Holy Ghost
[1:01:22] right there right and you B you age but
[1:01:26] the biggest Fortune don't
[1:01:33] why and brother randam says you find any
[1:01:38] promise in this
[1:01:41] book and you call God on the scene now
[1:01:44] do you need this quote he said God's
[1:01:47] obligated come
[1:01:52] on why don't it happen
[1:01:58] the anointing is there
[1:02:02] right am I
[1:02:04] right the anointing is there why did it
[1:02:08] not Quicken the
[1:02:13] word back in our scripture in Luke one
[1:02:17] about those that took the word and they
[1:02:20] held it for a
[1:02:23] while
[1:02:25] when the Holy Ghost fail Why didn't it
[1:02:27] give them eternal
[1:02:33] life so then I'm asking you the
[1:02:37] question what do you mean Lord Prophet
[1:02:40] what do you
[1:02:41] mean when you say the word of God is his
[1:02:53] seed
[1:03:00] now oh my Lord you
[1:03:03] do no this is four hours
[1:03:13] later when you can take and make a grain
[1:03:15] of
[1:03:17] corn that looks
[1:03:20] identical right makes the same amount of
[1:03:23] corn flakes cornbread
[1:03:27] whatever but you plant
[1:03:29] it and it won't give
[1:03:36] life everything is perfectly exactly the
[1:03:39] same and recording brother brandom the
[1:03:41] pulp Etc the things within it playing
[1:03:44] the shell outside and then the inside
[1:03:46] and the
[1:03:47] part but it won't
[1:03:53] live
[1:03:58] why because it don't have no
[1:04:02] germ
[1:04:05] right
[1:04:09] amen so then the letter kth Paul said
[1:04:16] why why does the letter
[1:04:20] kth don't on
[1:04:23] Jer
[1:04:28] but yet what he was talking about was
[1:04:30] the word of God that does have the
[1:04:32] germs you know germ in
[1:04:35] it why did the Pharisees kill
[1:04:40] Jesus when they knew the letter of the
[1:04:44] word and they knew
[1:04:49] Isaiah
[1:04:51] right they knew the scriptures
[1:04:59] what was wrong with
[1:05:04] him is it possible
[1:05:07] to have the
[1:05:11] word and the word how no
[1:05:22] germ you're quiet
[1:05:25] that's good you're either asleep or you
[1:05:28] thinking if you snore we'll find out you
[1:05:36] asleep but I'm just asking a simple
[1:05:40] question I'm so deep to people don't
[1:05:43] understand
[1:05:44] me and I'm asking the most simple
[1:05:47] question in the
[1:05:51] world why is it
[1:05:55] that the
[1:06:01] word that we hear does not convert
[1:06:05] US come on don't get me wrong now you
[1:06:09] got to hear the word first don't start
[1:06:11] off with your computer running that's
[1:06:13] right stay with
[1:06:14] me you could at least afford to do that
[1:06:17] much you want the internet or whatever
[1:06:18] you are you could at least stay with me
[1:06:21] and say well let me listen to what he's
[1:06:22] talking about whether I agree with him
[1:06:24] or
[1:06:28] not father Son and Holy Ghost is in the
[1:06:31] word of
[1:06:36] Goden and you know that God winked at
[1:06:40] ignorance and allowed people in the body
[1:06:43] they was baptized Father Son and Holy
[1:06:44] Ghost right
[1:06:48] right and he may be winking now because
[1:06:50] that's all people can hear but you know
[1:06:52] what I'm talking about in this day it'd
[1:06:54] be hard to say that he's winking in
[1:06:56] ignorance because the radio broadcast
[1:06:59] the things but I don't care why I bless
[1:07:02] God I don't want to listen to that old
[1:07:06] junk now what you mean is you don't want
[1:07:08] to admit what the truth
[1:07:10] is you're afraid to
[1:07:15] listen but now if you go out too much
[1:07:17] listening you're going to get caught
[1:07:19] with their doctorine so go ahead find
[1:07:22] the middle of the road
[1:07:27] amen come
[1:07:28] on you go too far you went off that way
[1:07:31] you go too far you're
[1:07:35] off the
[1:07:37] word is a seed that's
[1:07:44] right it needs moisture
[1:07:47] right are we
[1:07:51] right uh what is the moisture to the
[1:07:53] word
[1:07:57] the Holy Spirit you
[1:08:00] agree you agree that the moisture is the
[1:08:02] holy
[1:08:03] spirit well how come anointed ones don't
[1:08:05] get the New
[1:08:07] Birth come on let me say that again
[1:08:10] because your mind's
[1:08:12] running why is it that the anointing of
[1:08:15] the Holy Spirit can come down on a
[1:08:20] person and not make the word alive
[1:08:29] simple
[1:08:35] questions but yeah we say well I know
[1:08:38] what it is the word of God is a seed or
[1:08:40] the seed is the word of God I wish you'd
[1:08:42] go back and listen to a spoken word
[1:08:44] Original
[1:08:50] Seed you know might help you that's
[1:08:56] right CU even the title of the
[1:09:00] message is
[1:09:02] wonderful the spoken
[1:09:07] word is the Original Seed that's right
[1:09:11] now come on he didn't say the word is
[1:09:15] the
[1:09:16] seed like we're thinking he says the
[1:09:20] spoken
[1:09:22] word is the Original
[1:09:28] Seed that's good
[1:09:33] okay but why is it that we
[1:09:38] can take the
[1:09:43] word now how many will admit that you
[1:09:46] because we all talk like this
[1:09:48] right that I read the Bible I read the
[1:09:51] prophet's message I read this and I read
[1:09:53] that and all at once once something
[1:09:54] jumped off the page right did everybody
[1:09:56] agree with
[1:09:57] that you know you you're hearing it and
[1:10:00] all it's all at once it just something
[1:10:02] happened that's right right I mean you
[1:10:04] agree with that yes well what
[1:10:09] happened I mean did the letter change
[1:10:14] no what
[1:10:22] happened
[1:10:25] the seed of
[1:10:28] God what is the seed of
[1:10:32] God is it letters on a
[1:10:41] page but then you got to be careful
[1:10:43] because see everybody wants to say well
[1:10:45] what it is you got to read between the
[1:10:47] lines well that's good I I know the
[1:10:49] quotes all
[1:10:51] right okay I know know what the prophet
[1:10:54] said about read between the line and I
[1:10:55] believe it agree with it but you know
[1:10:57] reading between the lines can't be
[1:10:58] different than what the line says now
[1:11:01] you agree with that cuz that's what he
[1:11:03] said that's right reading between the
[1:11:06] lines just jumps it off the page into
[1:11:08] your
[1:11:12] heart but you see that's what people say
[1:11:15] another gir back there we was eating one
[1:11:17] night and Sister Margaret and it was all
[1:11:20] this about the seventh seal is this and
[1:11:21] seventh seal is that and brother the G
[1:11:23] said well if that's true I can take the
[1:11:25] seventh seal and just say I can marry as
[1:11:27] many times I want
[1:11:28] to and see he could be I'm reading
[1:11:30] between the
[1:11:32] lines but see the lines don't say that
[1:11:36] so that's not between the
[1:11:38] lines and Sister Margaret said if you
[1:11:40] get that I get a revelation I take my 37
[1:11:42] and blow your head off I said Sister
[1:11:44] Margaret I agree with
[1:11:48] you but you see we think that we know
[1:11:52] what it is
[1:11:58] what brother tell his word is his
[1:12:03] seed well how
[1:12:05] come it don't come
[1:12:10] up but you better remember now also
[1:12:12] where Paul said the letter kth I got it
[1:12:15] in here to read but remember what he was
[1:12:17] saying when he got to saying the letter
[1:12:18] kill
[1:12:19] it you know what he
[1:12:22] said
[1:12:24] he began to talk
[1:12:26] about faith cometh by
[1:12:29] hearing
[1:12:37] right brother D I don't need a preacher
[1:12:40] I can get it
[1:12:41] myself I want scripture for it that's
[1:12:47] right not trying to enhance mine because
[1:12:49] I don't get no
[1:12:51] different if there's 10,000 wasn't out
[1:12:53] there listening today then just remember
[1:12:56] I don't get a dime from you so it ain't
[1:12:57] helping me at
[1:13:03] all
[1:13:05] right I'm just trying to be
[1:13:10] honest see I can read you all of these
[1:13:12] quotes where brother brandham goes
[1:13:14] through explaining the seed is his
[1:13:19] word all
[1:13:21] right but what about it
[1:13:25] his seed is his word and Faith cometh by
[1:13:27] hearing that's right
[1:13:33] amen and what's the rest of that
[1:13:38] scripture and how can they hear without
[1:13:40] a
[1:13:45] preacher bless God ain't no preacher

[1:14:39] sir going back off because I'm going too
[1:14:48] far in Isaiah I'm going to say this and
[1:14:50] then back up I believe it's 9:6 isn't
[1:14:54] it where he talking about
[1:14:57] the a child is
[1:15:02] born what if that had never been put in
[1:15:04] the
[1:15:12] Bible you see folks we we're dwelling on
[1:15:15] a lot of things people take well brother
[1:15:17] random is a prophet I love everything he
[1:15:19] says but how do you love
[1:15:22] it
[1:15:25] he was preaching one day and it hit me
[1:15:27] and I said Glory Hallelujah now I know
[1:15:30] what I'm depending
[1:15:31] on you know what he said he got in the
[1:15:34] Rapture
[1:15:37] message and he said it has been
[1:15:41] spoken now let it come to pass that's
[1:15:45] right yes sir do you realize if he
[1:15:48] hadn't said that there would be no
[1:15:51] Rapture right come
[1:15:54] on don't play with me with words Paul's
[1:15:57] prophecy was a
[1:16:04] prophecy right change them on twinkle an
[1:16:07] eye you remember
[1:16:08] that but that was a prophecy why because
[1:16:11] he never experienced
[1:16:15] it somebody's going to experience a
[1:16:17] Rapture
[1:16:19] because the prophet of God that I
[1:16:21] believe in spoke it that's right that's
[1:16:25] right remember James is it no it's not
[1:16:28] what is it Amos 3 and 7 about the word
[1:16:32] comes to the prophet
[1:16:39] amen now that word coming to a
[1:16:49] prophet you know before it's a word it's
[1:16:51] a thought
[1:17:00] are you with
[1:17:03] me before it's a word it's a
[1:17:07] thought brother Bram
[1:17:10] said I don't know where he's holding up
[1:17:12] the Bible or not but he's referring he
[1:17:14] said this is God's
[1:17:16] thought that he has put
[1:17:19] in the
[1:17:22] Bible
[1:17:26] now if somebody don't pick that
[1:17:30] up then is it the
[1:17:34] word remember it's thought first then
[1:17:38] word you say yeah but in the beginning
[1:17:40] was the word amen you're in Genesis 1
[1:17:44] thank
[1:17:46] you before then it was a
[1:17:51] thought and then it was FOC
[1:17:54] Spen remember the title I ask you to
[1:17:56] listen to the message and ask you to
[1:17:58] listen to the title The spoken
[1:18:04] word is the Original
[1:18:12] Seed Brother D I don't all I believe is
[1:18:16] it just I I believe the word is a
[1:18:21] seed well why is it not not alive come
[1:18:25] on remember to be a
[1:18:29] seed that is worth
[1:18:32] anything the grain of corn illustration
[1:18:35] remember the difference is the germ of
[1:18:39] life you
[1:18:42] agree now I said I'm braing off so just
[1:18:47] back up with
[1:18:49] me how did that germ get in that seed
[1:19:04] simple question we'll back
[1:19:07] up cuz you see I know that I've Advanced
[1:19:10] way over in my thought but it's there
[1:19:14] that'll help you to
[1:19:19] understand how that the seed of
[1:19:21] God
[1:19:24] is God's
[1:19:30] word but remember Matthew
[1:19:35] 28:19 is God's
[1:19:38] word and The Germ of life is in
[1:19:50] it Lord Jesus
[1:19:55] no it ain't in Matthew 28:19 that's the
[1:19:57] den they take the they take Matthew
[1:19:59] 28:19 we take acts 238 Ah that's garbage
[1:20:03] K if you don't go brother random said by
[1:20:06] Matthew 28:19 you are not baptized
[1:20:09] correctly come on that's
[1:20:16] right well brother down which way I need
[1:20:18] to be I've told you how I baptized cuz I
[1:20:21] found one day that's where the prophet
[1:20:23] said it right that's the reason I do it
[1:20:26] I say to fulfill the Great Commission of
[1:20:28] Matthew
[1:20:29] 28:19 right to baptize in name Father
[1:20:32] Son and Holy Ghost I now baptize you in
[1:20:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right
[1:20:35] see I fulfilled it
[1:20:39] right but Matthew 28:19 is a germ of
[1:20:45] God it is a
[1:20:50] word you realize if if Mary hadn't said
[1:20:53] be it unto me according to Thy
[1:20:57] word that have never been a
[1:21:00] savior appar he' got somebody
[1:21:03] else yeah he probably could have got
[1:21:07] you I hope that goes all good on the
[1:21:09] internet the way my picture
[1:21:11] is cuz that's how silly I think you want
[1:21:15] to believe in predestination then there
[1:21:17] was nobody in the
[1:21:19] world right could say that but Mary
[1:21:23] that's
[1:21:24] right I don't care how many times
[1:21:27] anybody else said it it never
[1:21:30] produced they were teaching the just
[1:21:32] shall live by faith before Martin
[1:21:35] Luther study your
[1:21:38] history they were protesting the
[1:21:40] Catholic Church before Martin
[1:21:47] Luther but the best they could do was
[1:21:49] burn
[1:21:51] churches that's why what they
[1:21:56] thought but think about
[1:22:01] it brother random says on the message
[1:22:04] now if they throw these fight enough to
[1:22:05] read them that's fine if they don't you
[1:22:06] ought to know it chice the father
[1:22:10] 1950 he said the seed of God the seed is
[1:22:14] the word of
[1:22:16] God the S is the son of man the field is
[1:22:20] the earth and the seed is the word of
[1:22:22] God Amen notice this seed is the word of
[1:22:26] God it's if it's whatever God's word
[1:22:31] says it's a
[1:22:34] seed Hebrews chapter 6
[1:22:38] 1957 the seed of God is the word of God
[1:22:40] faith comth by hearing hearing the
[1:22:48] word come on he just said this he is the
[1:22:50] word of
[1:22:51] God
[1:22:53] what do you need to
[1:22:57] hear and what does it say how can they
[1:23:00] hear without a
[1:23:02] preacher I didn't write
[1:23:06] that but you want to te it out that's
[1:23:08] what a man told me one time he said them
[1:23:11] gifts and things in in uh there in
[1:23:14] Corinthians 13 or whatever he said that
[1:23:17] ought be T out of
[1:23:18] word I said give me your
[1:23:21] Bible
[1:23:23] he know better than hand me that Bible
[1:23:26] I'd give him $500 to bought him a brand
[1:23:28] new one the best company found in the
[1:23:29] world I was going to tear them Pages
[1:23:32] out cuz he said it had no need of being
[1:23:35] in there I said let me have it bu you
[1:23:37] better believe he wouldn't let me have
[1:23:39] it cuz he knew me I'd have just ripped
[1:23:42] it out and said here's money go buy you
[1:23:43] a new
[1:23:44] one that's being sarcastic and hate when
[1:23:47] no that's just being
[1:23:49] plain sorry to be plain
[1:23:53] but at least you don't play around
[1:23:55] knowing that I'm trying to pull
[1:23:56] something over on you that's right see
[1:23:58] the descript in 1965 the seed of God the
[1:24:02] word of God Jesus said in a certain
[1:24:04] place that the word is a seed and every
[1:24:07] seed will bring forth of its
[1:24:10] kind and now if the Christian the
[1:24:13] children of God the children of the
[1:24:15] Kingdom has become the seed of God then
[1:24:18] they must be the word of
[1:24:21] God
[1:24:23] you
[1:24:24] read the word of God manifested in the
[1:24:28] age that they're living in by the
[1:24:31] promised seed of that
[1:24:32] age he goes on down he talk about
[1:24:36] Moses he was the seed of God at that
[1:24:44] time we're going to get to it this
[1:24:46] evening but we're going to have to stop
[1:24:48] because it's
[1:24:49] late we're going to get to finding out
[1:24:51] that the seed comes through the
[1:24:54] body that's right that's what your
[1:24:57] Prophet
[1:24:58] said if you got any
[1:25:01] sense you know it does now don't get
[1:25:05] technical with me and say we're in the
[1:25:08] days of test Tu babies they come from
[1:25:12] somebody get it
[1:25:19] off presuming 1962
[1:25:22] what is it how are you going to have a
[1:25:24] Revival upon that when you're SE in
[1:25:27] Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[1:25:30] Pentecostal and Presbyterian
[1:25:35] seed and denying the seed of God the
[1:25:39] word Jesus said the word is a seed the
[1:25:42] Bible God's word is the seed how you
[1:25:46] going to bring forth a bible church with
[1:25:49] a denominational
[1:25:51] seed
[1:25:52] now what is a denominational
[1:25:55] seed he said it wouldn't
[1:26:02] work he said a denominational seed to
[1:26:04] produce a denomination every time you
[1:26:07] agree right
[1:26:09] amen now I I don't I don't get the story
[1:26:13] so I'll finish a few minutes saying it
[1:26:16] uh they read the same Bible we
[1:26:21] read right
[1:26:23] I I mean when you come into message did
[1:26:24] you get a different Bible I don't mean
[1:26:26] you decided you want to change from
[1:26:27] scoffield to Thompson Chain I ain't
[1:26:30] goofy I'm talking about was you reading
[1:26:32] a Bible and then the next day you went
[1:26:35] bought you a new one that was a spoken
[1:26:49] word you see church then if anything is
[1:26:51] contrary to the truly revealed word it's
[1:26:54] a denominational Doctrine
[1:26:56] right you can call it two Soul seventh
[1:26:59] under virtue
[1:27:01] perusia you can call it anything you
[1:27:03] want
[1:27:09] to if it ain't the word it's a
[1:27:12] denominational
[1:27:14] seed Lula or anything you want to
[1:27:21] call
[1:27:23] got a postcard I think Anna did the
[1:27:25] other day talking about us Lula I that's
[1:27:32] fine but what about
[1:27:35] it you can't have a Revival what was the
[1:27:39] story in the spoken word is Original
[1:27:44] Seed he said you say you've had the
[1:27:48] rain he said there's a former and a
[1:27:50] latter rain he said you say you've had
[1:27:53] the rain the latter
[1:27:56] rain he said
[1:28:02] nonsense he said cause you haven't had
[1:28:05] the former
[1:28:09] Reign the teaching
[1:28:12] rain he said you sown your own
[1:28:21] seed
[1:28:23] go home and listen to the T please I ask
[1:28:24] you to read the
[1:28:29] book he said you can't have the former
[1:28:31] the latter Reign until you have the
[1:28:34] former and he said that's why your
[1:28:36] Reigns is not brought Christ to the
[1:28:38] church no that's what he
[1:28:42] said he said because you you taught
[1:28:44] denominational
[1:28:46] seed now what is denominational seed
[1:28:50] like I said I mean when you you got it
[1:28:53] you went and got a new Bible and you
[1:28:54] come into the message and and uh and you
[1:28:58] you
[1:28:59] read and we know that all things work
[1:29:02] together for good to them that love God
[1:29:04] to them who are the called according to
[1:29:06] his
[1:29:08] purpose well I read that before didn't
[1:29:14] you but you
[1:29:18] see it's possible to
[1:29:20] have the letter in your
[1:29:26] possession without it having the germ of
[1:29:35] life
[1:29:37] okay how can you do that when a seed
[1:29:43] remember it takes a union to make a
[1:29:49] seed is that the prophet's words I give
[1:29:51] it to you the other
[1:29:55] day and let me ask you a simple question
[1:29:58] I'll
[1:30:01] close Jesus
[1:30:05] said to the people that looking at them
[1:30:09] that could take the Scrolls and stick a
[1:30:11] pen through them and tell you every
[1:30:13] letter that it went through that's just
[1:30:16] showing how much he read that's
[1:30:19] right that's all he done all her life is
[1:30:21] read the Scrolls
[1:30:23] right Jesus said one day he
[1:30:26] said you are of your father the
[1:30:33] devil
[1:30:35] right then he turned around and he made
[1:30:37] an outstanding statement that I wish you
[1:30:39] to ponder over until this afternoon
[1:30:42] maybe he said my
[1:30:44] words are
[1:30:46] spirit and their life that's
[1:30:50] right
[1:30:53] he read the same
[1:30:54] scroll
[1:31:00] right brother Dale you that's what I
[1:31:03] want to do I want to confuse you so much
[1:31:05] till you'll either just leave out of
[1:31:07] here and go away and we don't have to
[1:31:08] worry about building another church or
[1:31:12] nothing or either you'll go home and sit
[1:31:15] down and think what is this man talking
[1:31:19] about standing looking in them fire his
[1:31:22] face that could quote him every
[1:31:26] word he
[1:31:28] says my
[1:31:29] words our
[1:31:32] spirit and their
[1:31:36] life you know what he was telling
[1:31:40] them you don't have no
[1:31:44] germ so your words is letter on a
[1:31:50] page amen
[1:31:52] letters on the page don't have no germ
[1:31:54] in
[1:31:59] it let's
[1:32:03] stand what is the seed of God well it's
[1:32:06] the word of
[1:32:09] God it's the word of
[1:32:15] God why would Jesus say my words are
[1:32:18] Spirit in their
[1:32:20] life in other words everything he said
[1:32:23] was it spirit and life and all they they
[1:32:26] had
[1:32:27] was he he only
[1:32:30] said what the word
[1:32:34] said
[1:32:36] right why would you make that
[1:32:42] statement and you agreed with it while
[1:32:44] ago why would it be that that you could
[1:32:46] read and read and read and read
[1:32:47] something over and over and over and
[1:32:48] over and over and over just keep read
[1:32:50] read it over and over and over and over
[1:32:51] over and over and then one day something
[1:32:53] just jumps off the page right into your
[1:32:55] heart that's right did the letter

[1:33:07] germ come on we get to it this evening
