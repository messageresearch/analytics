[10:34] were that
[10:36] um we had a sister told my my wife I've
[10:38] never seen love Express I'm bad at
[10:41] quoting so I'm probably going to get the
[10:42] quote the statement all messed up but uh
[10:45] something to that effect I've never seen
[10:47] love Express like the way that you know
[10:48] you could see she looked around and saw
[10:50] all the people from our church working
[10:52] and and staying late and and helping out
[10:55] and all the all the things that had gone
[10:57] into it and you could see
[11:00] it it made an effect on on her and uh
[11:04] and that was there was a young man there
[11:06] too that uh he I just say I'm not going
[11:08] to say names for nothing but he'd been
[11:10] struggling with seeing you know all the
[11:12] all the Hypocrites and stuff that around
[11:14] the message and I think um it really
[11:17] made an effect on him to see something
[11:19] genuine in the people of our church and
[11:22] uh he yeah
[11:28] so I I pass out I'm throwing roses
[11:31] tonight
[11:32] we sure do appreciate everything that
[11:35] that went into it and and uh it just I I
[11:39] can't I just cannot express the
[11:41] appreciation and everything that that
[11:43] our family has to all of you
[11:46] so tonight I'm gonna read from John
[11:49] chapter 20 and just take a little topic
[11:53] um might be a short sermon I know I when
[11:55] I say that you know
[11:58] uh but uh uh just talk about Jesus the
[12:02] gardener Lord God we're so grateful to
[12:05] be able to gather around your word
[12:06] tonight Lord Jesus Lord each of us are
[12:09] coming with different needs tonight Lord
[12:10] God we know Lord there's just it seems
[12:13] like a constant stream of prayer
[12:14] requests and needs Lord Jesus but Lord
[12:16] we have a God that's here that can
[12:18] answer every need that can meet every
[12:19] need Lord and we just ask Lord that
[12:21] you'll move among us tonight Lord as we
[12:23] open the doors of our heart Lord Jesus
[12:25] to the Lord to just give you free reign
[12:27] to do what you will Lord Jesus Lord to
[12:30] plant your word in our hearts Lord Jesus
[12:31] to make it live Lord we ask Lord that
[12:34] you'll just feel at Liberty tonight Lord
[12:35] God to make the words that are spoken
[12:37] becoming a living reality in our hearts
[12:40] Lord Jesus to address the situations in
[12:42] our lives Lord we just ask your blessing
[12:44] upon the word now as is spoken in your
[12:46] name amen
[12:48] so John chapter 20 and uh and starting
[12:51] in verse 1 and going down to about verse
[12:53] 15 says the first day of the week cometh
[12:55] Mary Magdalene early when it was yet
[12:57] dark under the Sepulcher and seeth the
[13:00] stone taken away from the Sepulcher then
[13:02] she runeth and cometh to Simon Peter and
[13:05] to the other disciple whom Jesus loved
[13:06] and saith unto them they have taken away
[13:09] the Lord out of the Sepulcher and we
[13:11] know not where they have laid him
[13:14] Peter therefore went forth and that
[13:16] other disciple and came to the Sepulcher
[13:18] so they ran both together and the other
[13:20] disciple did outrun Peter and came first
[13:22] to the Sepulcher and he's stooping down
[13:24] and looking inside the linen clothes
[13:26] lying yet when he not in then come of
[13:29] psalmouth Peter following him and went
[13:30] into the Sepulcher and see if the linen
[13:32] clothes lie and the napkin that was
[13:34] about his head not lying with the linen
[13:36] clothes but wrapped together in a place
[13:37] by itself
[13:39] then went in also that other disciple
[13:41] which came first to the Sepulcher and he
[13:42] saw and believed for as yet they knew
[13:45] not the scripture that he must Rise
[13:46] Again from the dead
[13:47] then the disciples went away again under
[13:49] their own home but Mary stood without a
[13:51] disciple weeping and as she wept she
[13:53] stooped down and looked into the
[13:55] Sepulcher and see if two angels in
[13:57] whites sitting the one at the head and
[13:59] the other at the feet were the body of
[14:01] Jesus had lean and they say unto her
[14:03] woman why we bestow she saith unto them
[14:05] because they have taken away my Lord and
[14:07] I know not where they have laid him and
[14:10] when she had thus said she turned
[14:11] herself back and saw Jesus standing and
[14:14] knew not that it was Jesus Jesus saith
[14:17] unto her woman while weepest thou whom
[14:19] seeketh thou she's supposing him to be
[14:21] the gardener saith unto him sir if thou
[14:24] have borne him hence
[14:26] tell me where thou has laid him and I
[14:29] will take him away the Lord had his
[14:31] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[14:34] I I think you know when the problem of
[14:37] God if we could just kind of start
[14:39] meditating on on this scene as it opens
[14:41] up to us to think about how that God uh
[14:44] he in his in his foreknowledge and the
[14:47] way he just planned this scene out he
[14:50] had Jesus Jesus bird was buried in uh
[14:53] there in in a in a garden tomb not just
[14:56] a tomb but a garden tomb so that when
[14:59] when uh he rose from the grave that this
[15:03] little scene could play out and you
[15:04] think about what that Garden tomb must
[15:05] have looked like it was it wasn't just
[15:07] some dreary looking little place but
[15:09] flowers all over around and things
[15:12] planted and things blooming and and uh
[15:15] and so Barry she she was she was looking
[15:17] for the gardener she thought Jesus was
[15:19] the gardener
[15:21] and you know Jesus was not that Gardener
[15:23] not that Gardener of that of that Garden
[15:25] but maybe just take a little topic for
[15:27] tonight just to kind of study it out
[15:29] that he he is a gardener and and you
[15:32] know Isaac Watts was a songwriter in the
[15:34] 1600s and and Charles Spurgeon uh
[15:37] referred to a lot of his songs and he
[15:38] had a little song that went like this we
[15:40] are garden walled around
[15:42] Chosen and made peculiar ground a little
[15:46] spot enclosed by Grace out of the
[15:48] world's wide Wilderness now if you take
[15:51] that thought and kind of think about how
[15:53] the God has pulled us out of all of the
[15:55] our our spot in life are our natural
[15:58] spot and pulled us in and planted us
[16:01] into a garden and where where we can
[16:03] flourish and put put us in the ground
[16:05] and and uh like one little scripture
[16:08] will say in the Bible that he he'll dig
[16:11] around and and put dung their fertilizer
[16:13] and and get you all situated so that you
[16:16] can grow real good
[16:18] and he's got us walled in around so that
[16:21] we're protected and and and he's he's
[16:24] taking care of us and that's what a
[16:26] gardener does is he makes sure that the
[16:28] plants and everything is are growing
[16:30] right now so here we are sitting in this
[16:32] building and if you think of us that
[16:34] brother Brown would refer to the Saints
[16:35] a lot of times as flowers you know how
[16:38] you don't mix up flowers you want to be
[16:40] happy the way that you are the kind of
[16:41] flower that God has made made you you
[16:43] don't want to try to say well I don't
[16:45] like the way the flower that I am so I'm
[16:47] just going to mix everything up you want
[16:49] to because God is God is he's made us a
[16:51] flower he's made us a garden
[16:53] and now you you think now really
[16:56] sometimes we make the gospel so
[16:58] complicated and so hard to understand
[17:00] but God has made it he made it in a way
[17:03] that using all these analogies and
[17:05] things of of planting something in the
[17:08] ground and uh something coming up that
[17:10] you could go take this gospel into the
[17:12] deepest darkest jungle and preach the
[17:15] Seven Seals now this is my conviction
[17:18] you could preach the Seven Seals and you
[17:20] could preach the most seems like the
[17:21] most complicated doctrines just talking
[17:24] about plants growing in the field and I
[17:27] believe that that's what God the way
[17:28] that God wrote the Bible was so that the
[17:31] simple you don't have to have a great
[17:33] big mind a great PhD or something to
[17:36] understand it it's something that you
[17:37] can just go out in the field and and and
[17:39] listen to maybe like John John Wesley
[17:42] would be standing out in the middle of a
[17:44] field and start talking about nature
[17:45] watch the sun rise and the sunset watch
[17:48] the leaves fall off the tree in the fall
[17:49] and they'll come back the next year and
[17:50] you know there's got to be a
[17:52] resurrection because life goes down and
[17:54] it comes back up everything that you can
[17:55] see in nature
[17:57] so we see as we're looking at we're
[17:59] looking at God's Guard we're talking
[18:00] about God's Garden you can see that you
[18:03] can see these deep things expressed in
[18:05] in what God is laid out for us to be
[18:07] able to understand even in the Song of
[18:10] Solomon it says Thou that dwellest in
[18:12] the gardens now you think about this is
[18:14] the way that the shulamite woman
[18:15] referred to to Solomon or the bride
[18:19] referring to to God thou that dwelleth
[18:21] in the gardens that God is is that's
[18:24] where he makes his Abode because he's he
[18:27] wants to he wants to make sure that this
[18:29] crop comes up right he wants to make
[18:31] sure that you have everything that you
[18:32] need to flourish thou that dwellest in
[18:35] the gardens the companions hearken to
[18:37] thy voice calls me to hear it so he's
[18:40] walking in the garden and he and we want
[18:42] to hear his voice now Isaiah listen to
[18:45] this now it says now will I sing to my
[18:48] well-beloved a song of my beloved
[18:49] touching his Vineyard that sounds like
[18:51] it comes from the song with Solomon did
[18:53] but it's coming from Isaiah Isaiah
[18:55] chapter five my beloved my will well
[18:57] beloved half a Vineyard and a very
[18:59] fruitful Hill and he fenced it and
[19:01] gathered out the stones thereof and
[19:03] planted it with the choices Vine and
[19:05] built a tower in the midst of it and
[19:07] also made a wine preserion and he looked
[19:09] at it should bring forth grapes and it
[19:11] brought forth wild grapes The Vineyard
[19:14] of the lord of the hosts is the house of
[19:16] Israel and the men of Judah his Pleasant
[19:19] plan
[19:20] so who's the vineyard of the Lord is the
[19:22] house of the House of Israel and this
[19:25] now is the the the the true seed of
[19:27] Israel right here the seed the uh that
[19:30] I'm looking at and the men of Judah his
[19:32] Pleasant plan so you are his garden you
[19:34] are the Lord's garden now now Gardner is
[19:37] a person who tends and and cultivates a
[19:39] garden as a Pastime or for a living it's
[19:41] somebody that goes through the garden
[19:42] and make sure that it's it's doing right
[19:43] in the Bible doesn't really refer to a
[19:46] gardener as a gardener the Bible refers
[19:48] to a gardener as as a husbandman so when
[19:51] you read the Bible it says it's talking
[19:53] about when it says husband man it's
[19:54] talking about a gardener and and this
[19:57] Gardener now in Matthew Chapter 13 it
[20:00] says he the soweth The Good Seed is the
[20:02] son of man the field is the world the
[20:05] good seed or the children of the Kingdom
[20:07] so this Gardener that we're talking
[20:08] about is that somebody he's going around
[20:10] sowing he's trying to plant something in
[20:12] the ground and what he's sowing he's
[20:15] sowing the Bible says the field is the
[20:17] world a good seed are the children of
[20:19] the Kingdom now James I'm gonna run
[20:21] through some scriptures kind of faster
[20:22] and then we'll kind of get into the to
[20:24] the meat of this and maybe not be too
[20:26] long tonight as I as I warned you James
[20:29] chapter 5 7 says be patient therefore
[20:32] Brethren unto the coming of the Lord
[20:33] behold the husbandman waiteth for the
[20:36] precious fruit of the earth and hath
[20:38] long patience for it until he received
[20:41] the early and latter rain so now what's
[20:44] the gardener doing the gardener knows
[20:46] that sometimes it takes a while for that
[20:48] crop to come up you plant that seed down
[20:50] in the ground and you've tried to find
[20:51] some good ground to plant it in and and
[20:53] then you wait and you're patient the
[20:55] husbandman The Gardener is waiting for
[20:57] the precious fruit of the earth now he
[20:58] planted something down in the very
[21:00] beginning and he waited and waited down
[21:02] through seven Church ages for it to come
[21:04] up in the mature and now he's finally
[21:06] seeing the fruits of all of his all of
[21:08] his all of his sacrifice all of what he
[21:10] did there on the cross he's seeing the
[21:12] whole plan being fulfilled of course you
[21:14] know when you when the whole plan is is
[21:16] is is done and completed you can take
[21:18] the whole seal off and see what God has
[21:19] done but the gardener what's the
[21:21] gardener doing he's waiting for the
[21:23] fruit maybe I could express this
[21:25] afternoon known it that God wants to see
[21:27] you bear fruit God if God is The
[21:29] Gardener of your life he wants to give
[21:31] you everything that you have need of he
[21:33] wants to give you he wants to plant the
[21:34] right thing and the ground of your heart
[21:36] he wants to plant the right thing in you
[21:38] and he wants to give you the right or
[21:40] the right nourishment and the right
[21:42] Reign and and dig around you and put
[21:44] fertilizer there so that you have
[21:46] everything you need to grow up now in
[21:49] Luke Chapter 13 it says there's a
[21:51] parable that Jesus said
[21:53] and it's a parable that we Overlook a
[21:55] lot of times he says he spake also this
[21:57] Parable a certain man had a fig tree
[21:59] planted in his Vineyard and he came and
[22:01] saw fruit there on and found none then
[22:03] said he under the dresser of his
[22:04] Vineyard behold these three years I come
[22:07] seeking fruit on this fig tree and find
[22:09] none cut it down why come birth at the
[22:11] ground Now isn't that how a lot of times
[22:13] we look at it well maybe we'll look at
[22:14] our own life for the life of our family
[22:16] or something and say Well they're never
[22:17] going to come to church they're never
[22:18] they're never going to get their bear
[22:21] fruit and and this this dresser this
[22:24] person was saying
[22:27] to the dresser of the vineyard to The
[22:29] Gardener he's saying why don't you just
[22:31] cut this thing down and the gardener he
[22:33] answered and he said unto him Lord let
[22:35] it alone this year also till I shall dig
[22:38] about it and dung it and if it bear
[22:40] fruit well and if not then after that
[22:42] thou shalt cut down so let I want to say
[22:45] this afternoon let God work with the
[22:47] tree a little bit before giving up on it
[22:49] let God work with that fig tree a little
[22:51] bit before giving up on it but let God
[22:53] work with that with your children a
[22:55] little bit before giving on it up on it
[22:56] and saying well just cut it down that
[22:58] person in the church that seems like
[22:59] they're not doing what they're supposed
[23:00] to do or whatever let the gardener have
[23:02] at it and that's what the gardener is
[23:04] supposed he's got his pruning shears in
[23:06] his hand when we come to church that's
[23:07] what we come to church for to get to get
[23:09] the things cut off of our life that that
[23:11] are causing us that are hindering us to
[23:13] be able to develop fruit right if we'll
[23:16] just be patient and wait on the Lord The
[23:17] Gardener will have his perfect work than
[23:19] us that you see none of that fruit none
[23:22] of the fruit would come without first
[23:24] planting the seed none of that fruit
[23:26] would come none of the fruit that we see
[23:28] here would come would have ever come
[23:30] without first planting the seed and so
[23:32] we go back to our original story there
[23:35] Jesus coming up out of the ground John
[23:37] chapter 12 says verily verily I say unto
[23:40] you except the corn of wheat fall into
[23:41] the ground and die at abideth alone but
[23:44] if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
[23:46] he that loveth loveth his life shall
[23:49] lose it and he that hateth his life in
[23:51] this world shall keep it under life
[23:53] eternal so you've got a pattern there
[23:55] all down to the scripture of planning
[23:57] you see God wants to plant his word in
[23:59] you but first his word was planted in
[24:01] the ground and it rose on Easter morning
[24:03] and the reason the purpose for why it
[24:05] was planted in the ground was so it
[24:07] could be planted and you the original
[24:09] sea the original life the original word
[24:12] of God that was with God before the
[24:13] foundation of the world was planted in
[24:16] the Earth was planted in death so that
[24:18] you you could have life and that
[24:21] original life was called a seed the seed
[24:24] this seed which is Christ that seed was
[24:26] planted in the ground in Galatians
[24:28] chapter 3 verse 16 it says now to
[24:30] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[24:31] made he saith not and deceased them as a
[24:34] many but as of one and to thy seed which
[24:37] is Christ
[24:38] in Isaiah 53 verse 10 it says yet it
[24:41] pleased the Lord to Bruce him he hath
[24:42] put him to grief when thou shalt make
[24:44] his soul and offering for sin he shall
[24:46] see his seed he shall prolong his days
[24:48] in the pleasure of the Lord shall
[24:50] prosper in his hand he was the word he
[24:53] was the original Life The Original Seed
[24:55] he was in the beginning was the word and
[24:57] the Word was with God and the Word was
[24:59] God and brother random said in the
[25:01] spoken word is the Original Seed he said
[25:03] every spoken word of God is the Original
[25:05] Seed I see you oh if you if we could
[25:08] kind of grasp that this morning that
[25:09] when that word was planted that's that
[25:12] word it had it had there had to be it
[25:14] had to produce something when it was
[25:16] planted in the ground it had to rise for
[25:18] to produce life to give life and when
[25:21] that word of God is planted in your
[25:23] heart it's going to produce something if
[25:25] it's planted in good ground if it's
[25:28] planting and ground it's going to
[25:29] produce oh what a promise we've got lay
[25:32] in there this afternoon that if the word
[25:33] if you receive the word of God and it's
[25:36] planted in the good ground of your heart
[25:38] it is going to produce life and I see
[25:41] this afternoon we're not just talking
[25:42] about denominational ideas or on callal
[25:45] ideas or our own thoughts about what's
[25:46] right and wrong but if we take what's
[25:48] laying here in the Bible and receive it
[25:51] in the way that God wants us to receive
[25:52] it it is going to come up and produce
[25:55] something it's going to actually produce
[25:58] the Life of Christ in us because that's
[26:00] what's planted the original word was
[26:02] planted in the ground and cross the word
[26:05] the original word rose up from the
[26:06] ground and when it's planted in your
[26:08] heart the original word will rise up in
[26:11] your life and produce itself again
[26:13] brother Adam said every spoken word of
[26:15] God is the Original Seed God planted
[26:17] everything in the Earth by his word and
[26:20] as long as you stay with the Original
[26:22] Seed it will breed itself right back and
[26:25] reproduce itself again as long as you
[26:28] see stay with that original see why
[26:30] because that original C is the word of
[26:33] God it's God himself in letter form and
[26:35] when you receive it in your heart it
[26:37] comes off the page into a spiritual a
[26:39] spiritual life manifesting God himself
[26:44] that's what the gardener is trying to do
[26:45] he's trying to sow the word plant the
[26:48] seed plant the seed in your life and
[26:50] he's looking for good ground to do it
[26:52] the Bible says that he said I am the
[26:54] resurrection of the life he that
[26:56] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[26:58] shall he live that means his lead
[27:03] Christ did that you will do also Healing
[27:05] The Sick and raising the dead because
[27:07] the Life of Christ is manifested in you
[27:09] God is a Master Gardener a master
[27:13] husbandman a master a Master Gardener is
[27:15] somebody that knows every in and out of
[27:17] what to do how to cast out Devils how to
[27:19] how to give nourishment to the plant
[27:21] what to cut off when and where what kind
[27:23] of bug is good or bad a Master Gardener
[27:26] know what knows what's right for his
[27:27] church
[27:28] if the church is the garden that first
[27:31] corn of wheat was planted in the earth's
[27:33] Earth so that you could have a life
[27:36] in Genesis chapter 2 verse 8 and 9 it
[27:38] says that the Lord God planted a garden
[27:40] Eastward in Eden
[27:42] see God's all about Gardens
[27:44] and and verse 9 out of the ground may
[27:47] the Lord God to grow every tree
[27:49] because he's a Gardener He's a Master
[27:52] Gardener a husbandman and he made out of
[27:54] the ground to grow every tree that is
[27:56] Pleasant to the side and good for food
[27:57] the tree of life also in the midst of
[28:00] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[28:01] Good and Evil an every believer every
[28:04] believer in Christ is connected to his
[28:06] planning and death
[28:08] because he was planning so that we can
[28:11] have life through him in John chapter 15
[28:13] he said I am the True Vine and my father
[28:15] is the husbandman my father is the
[28:18] gardener every branch of me that beareth
[28:20] not fruit he'd taketh away in every
[28:22] branch that bearth fruit he purges it
[28:24] that it may bring forth more fruit now
[28:27] you are clinging through the word which
[28:28] I have spoken unto you abide in me and I
[28:31] in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[28:32] of itself except it abide in the vine no
[28:35] more can ye accept ye abide in me
[28:37] I am the vine ye are the branches he
[28:40] that abideth in me and I in him the sin
[28:42] the same bringeth forth much fruit for
[28:45] without me you can do nothing if a man
[28:47] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[28:49] forth as a branch and is withered and
[28:52] Men gather them and cast them into the
[28:54] fire and they are burned if you abide in
[28:56] me and my words abide in you you shall
[28:58] ask what you will and it shall be done
[29:00] unto you so there's we've got a
[29:02] principle of Life laying there that if
[29:03] you plant a seed in good ground and you
[29:06] water it it will produce
[29:08] if you plant a seed in good ground and
[29:10] water it
[29:12] it is God is going to produce now all
[29:15] through the scripture we've got this
[29:17] this story of God's Garden we've got
[29:18] Gardens All Through the Bible you can
[29:20] read about seeds the Tree of Life the
[29:22] tree planted by the rivers of water the
[29:24] Fig Tree and the bride tree there's
[29:26] Vines and trees and rain there's rain
[29:29] that Elijah said there that rain ain't
[29:30] going to fall until I call for it and
[29:32] then the rain fell after he got
[29:33] everything in order again after he
[29:35] killed all the priests of Baal and Baal
[29:37] is we'll get into later is a is a rain
[29:39] God a fertility God and they will
[29:41] worship in the rain God and when when
[29:42] when when when when Elijah killed all
[29:44] the priests of Baal then the rain fell
[29:48] from the real God the wheat and the
[29:51] tares and all the little foxes that
[29:53] spoil the vine that get in there and
[29:55] mess up the garden that you've got to
[29:57] take care of because the little the
[29:58] little foxes the little things of Life
[30:00] are the things that we've got to get rid
[30:01] of and there's grafting and there's
[30:04] husbandmen and laborers and there's you
[30:06] that are part of God's garden and
[30:09] Satan's scheme all this time is to keep
[30:11] the garden from growing
[30:13] Satan's scheme is to keep that Garden
[30:15] from what's Satan trying to do he this
[30:16] even this afternoon he's trying to keep
[30:18] you from from hearing the word because
[30:20] he wants to mess up mess he wants to
[30:22] make your heart Stony he wants to let
[30:23] make Thorns grow up so that the word
[30:26] can't be planted he wants to get your
[30:27] mind off on something else gets you
[30:30] distracted he wants to make you think
[30:31] maybe that the preacher don't know what
[30:33] he's talking about or the people in
[30:34] church or this or that and get you
[30:36] distracted this way or that way because
[30:38] the devil is trying to keep the the word
[30:41] of God from being planted in you that
[30:43] what's the devil well the devil's tactic
[30:45] is to introduce something else so that
[30:47] you know hybridization from the very
[30:49] beginning if we'll talk about
[30:50] hybridization you take like a grapefruit
[30:53] and a tangerine and hybridize them
[30:55] together and then you've got a tangelo
[30:57] which can never go back to a grapefruit
[30:59] it can never go back to a tangerine
[31:01] because it's not either one of those
[31:03] things now it's a tangelo you've mixed
[31:06] it all together and so you take the word
[31:08] of God and mix it with something else
[31:10] you'll you'll never be able to reproduce
[31:12] the life Life of Christ it'll never be
[31:15] able to produce the Life of Christ
[31:16] because you've taken it now now see we a
[31:19] lot of times we'll we'll start thinking
[31:21] about like major doctrines and stuff but
[31:23] you can just you can you you take the
[31:25] the raw word of God and mix in with
[31:28] there some lie of the devil that you
[31:30] can't get the the Holy Ghost is not for
[31:32] you or I can't get my healing I've been
[31:34] dealing so long with my predicament or
[31:36] whatever that and now you've mixed it up
[31:37] with something that it won't produce but
[31:39] if you let the word of God be sowed into
[31:41] your heart into good ground it's going
[31:43] to produce and you see what you see as
[31:46] we grow up the stature of the perfect
[31:48] man that's what God is trying to teach
[31:49] to us as our faith is home and and as
[31:53] our as we begin as word precepts upon
[31:56] precept is piled we begin to our mind
[31:58] like brother boy he's been preaching on
[32:00] our mind is actually renewed to begin to
[32:02] realize that these things are possible
[32:04] that all things are possible to them
[32:06] that believe we're early on maybe in our
[32:09] journey we begin to stumble at things
[32:11] and we we maybe we even stumble that
[32:13] whether we were truly born again and the
[32:15] devil would battle at us about those
[32:16] things but then you begin to realize
[32:18] that these things that we really do have
[32:21] a power in the church that we really do
[32:23] have the power of love and forgiveness
[32:25] and that God really is moving in your
[32:27] life and and there really is something
[32:29] and you see all that hybridization is
[32:32] being taken out as we become in Oneness
[32:34] with God Oneness with God is what we're
[32:36] after not one not one that's a Oneness
[32:39] with God will produce Oneness with one
[32:40] another if we'll just get one with if
[32:43] we'll look at Christ if we'll love
[32:46] Christ in the way that we should we'll
[32:47] we'll start loving one another the way
[32:49] that we should also
[32:50] the hybridization is what the devil the
[32:53] devil wants to keep you from believing
[32:54] to think to think that you're you're
[32:56] fine just the way you are I was reading
[32:59] a quote the other day where brother
[33:00] Brown said that's what the devil's
[33:01] tactic is to think that to make you
[33:03] think that whatever wherever you are
[33:05] you'll find the way you are the young
[33:07] people to think that you can post stuff
[33:09] on Tinder and go looking at websites and
[33:11] all kinds of stuff and that you're fine
[33:12] the way you are old people as well that
[33:14] you're fine because that's what the
[33:15] devil's lie is to to make you think well
[33:17] I'm good I'm I'm okay just the way that
[33:20] I am to think it really or to think that
[33:23] it don't really matter what you believe
[33:25] but it does matter
[33:27] because what you believe is what's sown
[33:29] into your heart and what's sown into
[33:31] your heart if it's the original sea the
[33:33] original life is going to produce
[33:40] what you allow to take root in your life
[33:42] is what will grow and manifest oh you
[33:46] see why it's so important to be careful
[33:47] of what you look at and what you listen
[33:49] to and you you start you start listening
[33:51] to some podcast that's got a bunch of
[33:53] weird ideas
[33:54] about what gender people are and all
[33:57] that kind of stuff and before long you
[33:58] you'll start thinking along those lines
[34:00] what you what you what you allow to take
[34:02] root in your life
[34:04] is what will grow and manifest
[34:07] that's why you say it matters it matters
[34:10] what you believe you start you maybe
[34:12] sometimes you come to church and you
[34:13] think well we're just being too critical
[34:15] but no because it matters what's sown in
[34:17] your heart I don't want any weeds or
[34:19] Thorns growing in my ground I want to
[34:20] get all the stones rooted out I want to
[34:22] get all the Thorns rooted out because
[34:24] because it matters now you see you look
[34:27] at Cain's life that hybridized life that
[34:30] that came he wanted to be a a he was
[34:33] like a good a good message believer he
[34:35] was he was at church all the time he was
[34:37] he was worshiping but he he his eye his
[34:40] the way that his when when Abel
[34:43] presented the word to him the true
[34:45] revelation of the hour he said no I
[34:47] don't want that you're going to have to
[34:49] come my way here take that my way of the
[34:51] highway my way is good enough you could
[34:54] take it or leave it and and so Cain was
[34:56] rejected Balaam Balaam that hybridized
[34:59] his hybrid way of thinking was to take
[35:01] his own ideas his own thoughts to say
[35:04] that we're we're just all the same you
[35:06] see why ministers hit on that so much
[35:08] that we're not all the same what makes
[35:10] us different from the rest of the world
[35:12] is what we believe what we believe sets
[35:15] us apart and makes us different what
[35:17] it's Christ that makes us different
[35:18] we're not all the same like Balaam would
[35:20] have you believe we're all the same no
[35:22] there's something that makes us
[35:24] different
[35:26] and a hybrid product
[35:28] what's the difference between a hybrid
[35:29] and and the real the real has life and
[35:33] the hybrid does not have life in it a
[35:35] hybrid product has no life it ain't no
[35:37] good president said it makes a better
[35:39] looking ear but it ain't got no life in
[35:41] it that's the way it makes a better
[35:43] looking church but no life in it hybrid
[35:46] that's right you see the truth the
[35:49] original truth the original life has
[35:52] life in it the Original Seed brings the
[35:55] original life that's where the life
[35:57] comes from because it's that it's that
[35:59] original life the lie that Cain believed
[36:01] was his own works and the fruits the
[36:03] field were sufficient but the truth that
[36:05] Abel believed was that he needed a blood
[36:07] sacrifice and that was life in what Abel
[36:11] believed
[36:12] now see if the life matters
[36:15] if the life matters then the seed
[36:17] matters
[36:18] the seed matters
[36:20] the seed brings a life
[36:22] so it matters what you believe
[36:25] God is still looking
[36:27] for some good planting ground to plant
[36:29] his word
[36:30] somebody that knows that it matters what
[36:32] you believe
[36:33] somebody that's ready to open up their
[36:35] heart to receive God's word no matter
[36:36] what the cost
[36:38] because the Bible says in First Peter
[36:40] chapter 1 verse 23 it says being born
[36:42] again not of corruptible seed but of
[36:45] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[36:47] liveth and abideth forever that's
[36:49] actually how we're born again by
[36:51] receiving the word by that word being
[36:53] planted in your life
[36:55] come on now y'all y'all if y'all if
[36:57] y'all agree with this y'all put a little
[36:59] bit
[37:01] y'all making me feel like I I don't
[37:03] y'all don't believe what I'm saying here
[37:06] we're born by the word of God we're not
[37:08] born by so many corruptable words well
[37:10] Incorruptible man's ideas or anything
[37:12] but we're born by the by The
[37:13] Incorruptible word of God now here's
[37:16] here's the meat and potatoes this
[37:18] afternoon that I kind of want to get
[37:19] into is that when Jesus Jesus told this
[37:22] Parable and see how a lot of these deep
[37:24] things that Jesus simplified them down
[37:26] so that we can understand and Jesus told
[37:28] this Parable that about the sower went
[37:30] forth to sow and there was different
[37:32] kinds of ground that the seed went into
[37:34] and then first of all that that he he
[37:36] told about this scenario this situation
[37:38] where the the seed fell by the wayside
[37:41] and the birds of the the of the air came
[37:43] and picked it up plucked it and plucked
[37:45] it away and and so the seed didn't get a
[37:47] chance to root in the ground now what's
[37:49] he talking about in all these Parables I
[37:50] I think we know we we've got the
[37:52] background well we've heard this over
[37:54] and over but what he's what's he talking
[37:55] about he's talking about you he's
[37:58] talking about your ground that he wants
[38:00] to sow his word he's he's the gardener
[38:02] that wants to sow his word in your
[38:04] ground so now it depends whether the
[38:07] word of God takes root and actually
[38:09] manifests it all depends on the ground
[38:11] the ground is the problem the ground is
[38:14] the thing that if we can if we can get
[38:16] our ground tilled up and softened up and
[38:18] so that it's good ground and so now it's
[38:21] going to produce so I want to know what
[38:23] good ground is don't you want to know
[38:25] what good ground is this afternoon
[38:26] because I want the word of God to be
[38:28] produced in my life I want to have the
[38:31] right attitude I want to have the right
[38:32] mindset for the word of God to be able
[38:34] to take root in my life so that it can
[38:37] produce so that others can see Christ in
[38:40] me now now so we've got all these
[38:42] examples of the birds the fowls of the
[38:45] air coming and picking up the seed that
[38:46] fell by the wayside and the others that
[38:48] fell on this Stony ground and the sun
[38:50] just just burn it up because it couldn't
[38:52] take root down enough to get moisture
[38:54] and others where the the Thorns that all
[38:57] these things grew up around and just
[38:58] choked it out now see this this
[39:00] afternoon don't get all drawn up on me
[39:02] now you don't want the orange to choke
[39:04] out the life do you we want to get all
[39:06] the stone out of our if we can get the
[39:08] stone out of our out of our ground and
[39:11] get the Thorns take care of the thorn
[39:13] rip up those thorns
[39:17] stool get rooted and really get a good
[39:20] foothold so that when so that when the
[39:23] rain comes and the storms and the sleet
[39:25] and the snow that you've got you're
[39:26] rooted and it don't bother you anymore
[39:28] because you know what you believe that's
[39:31] what this Parable is talking about a
[39:33] Christian that has received the word so
[39:36] strongly so open themselves up to where
[39:38] God can do something with him
[39:41] now Jesus said he said these are they by
[39:44] the wayside where the word is sown
[39:46] but when they have heard that for
[39:48] talking about the whether whether uh
[39:49] whether the seed is cast by the wayside
[39:52] it falls by the wayside and it and the
[39:54] birds of the air come and pick it up he
[39:55] said these are they by the wayside where
[39:57] the word is sown but when they have
[39:59] heard when you've heard it then Here
[40:01] Comes Satan immediately and taketh away
[40:04] the word that was sown in their hearts
[40:06] Here Comes Satan as soon as you hear the
[40:08] word as soon as the words preached Here
[40:10] Comes Satan to say well the cloud was
[40:13] really caused by a missile and all of a
[40:15] sudden Here Comes The Devil to take put
[40:18] some idea in your head and Away you go
[40:20] and you stop listening to the word and
[40:22] now now you you the word can't take root
[40:25] in your ground because there's the devil
[40:27] to tell you that well we don't have any
[40:29] newspaper records of exactly how many
[40:31] people fell off the bridge and see these
[40:33] are examples now but let's apply it to
[40:35] your life Here Comes The Devil to tell
[40:37] you well like like that little girl that
[40:39] was healed and brother around his
[40:41] meeting and she was actually healed of
[40:43] being deaf and she went home and started
[40:45] listening to her family and her family
[40:48] told her well I don't think you really
[40:49] got her your healing and what was that
[40:51] doing that was the devil coming to take
[40:53] away that word that had been sown in her
[40:56] heart and now she lost her healing
[40:58] because there was the devil to take it
[40:59] away Here Comes The Devil to tell you
[41:01] well I don't think you can really get
[41:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't
[41:04] think that church has it I don't some
[41:06] people in brother branham's campaign
[41:07] lost their healing well there was a lot
[41:09] of people in brother Baron's campaign
[41:10] that kept their healing
[41:16] listen you know there's so many things
[41:18] to look at like like the the young man
[41:20] that I was talking about at the wedding
[41:22] this Sunday that had looked at so many
[41:24] Hypocrites over the ages but listen that
[41:26] well there's a lot of Hypocrites and a
[41:28] lot of weird stuff that there is a
[41:31] genuine and I that's I was telling my
[41:34] wife the other day that's one of my
[41:35] missions in life is I want to represent
[41:37] this message in a way that's not weird I
[41:39] think the message has been there's so
[41:41] much been so much weird stuff around the
[41:43] message and I heard one preacher
[41:45] preaching on it like this he said that
[41:47] you know the the gospel is for broken
[41:49] people and so it's going to attract a
[41:51] lot of broken people but let's not look
[41:53] at the Brokenness but let's look at what
[41:55] God can do to those broken lives that
[41:57] God can pack somebody up and transform
[41:59] you do you get so looking at all the
[42:02] Hypocrites and all the trash and all the
[42:04] weird stuff going on but there is a real
[42:06] genuine Holy Ghost Field bride that's
[42:09] being transformed by the word that she
[42:11] has received in the good ground of her
[42:13] heart you know all these things that
[42:16] people look at but you know all those
[42:18] nine Visions all the all the different
[42:19] Visions was it seven seven nine how many
[42:22] however many it was the egg-shaped car
[42:24] all those things are coming to pass a
[42:27] nation that's won run by a woman a
[42:30] woman's Nation surely you can look
[42:32] around and see that prophecy is being
[42:33] fulfilled all the things about the
[42:35] Maginot Line and watch Russia not the
[42:38] USSR but Russia watch Russia and now
[42:41] Russia her name was changed from the
[42:44] USSR to Russia to fulfill what brother
[42:46] Brown spoke about all those years ago
[42:50] see the devil the devil will come along
[42:52] and when the word is sown if it's so if
[42:56] it's not sown in good ground the devil
[42:58] will come and try to snatch it away
[42:59] don't let the devil snatch it away
[43:02] maybe tonight they're sitting for
[43:04] somebody sitting here maybe it's for
[43:05] somebody listening in online
[43:09] you know the devil will come along and
[43:10] he'll he'll tell you all kind of he'll
[43:12] say you well you know better than the
[43:13] preacher you're more spiritual than
[43:15] anyone here and boy that's something
[43:16] that'll snatch that seat away you're
[43:18] more Spirit you got a better better this
[43:20] better that better experience you have a
[43:22] greater understanding he'll tell you all
[43:24] kinds of stuff oh that don't that don't
[43:26] apply to you that don't apply to you
[43:28] you're fine but let's see you got to
[43:31] have that good ground because the good
[43:32] ground
[43:33] ground that ain't Stony ground without
[43:36] all the Thorns Grime without the where
[43:39] the devil can't snatch it away where you
[43:41] just let it take root it's going to
[43:43] produce oh brother Bob this is simple
[43:46] but you know the gospel is simple not
[43:48] simple not not the gospel the gospel is
[43:51] simple enough that anybody can receive
[43:53] it and anybody can be changed
[43:57] what's that what's Satan's motive
[43:59] Satan's motive is to discredit the word
[44:02] when the word is preached in truth and
[44:04] in power there's Satan standing right
[44:06] there to come along and say well well I
[44:08] don't think brother Branham was real
[44:09] honest I I I went on believe the sign
[44:12] today and I was looking at all their
[44:13] lists of all their nonsense and stuff
[44:15] that they they said what it is is the
[44:17] devil trying to discredit what God has
[44:19] said that brother Branham was Dishonored
[44:21] that was the most honest man you could
[44:22] he even told the IRS guy that I told I
[44:25] stepped out of my house and and and told
[44:27] my wife to say that I wasn't there and
[44:29] he said well now I really believe you
[44:31] because you were so so honest enough to
[44:33] come and tell me all of these things
[44:35] about the cloud and the bridge and the
[44:38] devil will even try to discredit your
[44:40] testimony you come out you go home and
[44:42] say well I've been healed I feel like
[44:43] I've been come back from a camp meeting
[44:45] and say that God did something to me and
[44:47] there'll be somebody waiting for you
[44:49] when you get back from Camp to say well
[44:51] I don't think you really got it you just
[44:52] were emotional there's somebody somebody
[44:55] that the devil will work through around
[44:56] every corner to discredit your healing
[44:59] to discredit your salvation now you let
[45:01] that word of God take root in your heart
[45:03] enough where nothing could take it away
[45:05] that's what God wants to that word to
[45:07] sink down into that good ground where
[45:09] God can do something with you with a
[45:11] husbandman can be in the world
[45:14] that's what the devil's job is to
[45:16] discredit the preachers to discredit
[45:18] your pastor to discredit your friends to
[45:20] discredit even your good intentions you
[45:23] try to do something good and the devil
[45:24] will be right around the corner to say
[45:26] well well you were trying to do that out
[45:28] of spite or something oh don't you
[45:29] remember the story when David come up
[45:31] upon the scene where they were their
[45:32] Goliath was making his big boast and all
[45:34] of his brothers were standing there to
[45:36] say oh you're just full of mischief
[45:38] you're coming up here just to stir up
[45:39] trouble David wasn't there to stir up
[45:41] trouble but they were that it was the
[45:44] devil trying to discredit his good
[45:45] intentions the devil will even discredit
[45:48] the things you can see with your eyes
[45:50] and hear with your ears he will
[45:53] discredit that you can see a picture of
[45:55] the pillar of fire that was taken by the
[45:58] enemies of this gospel he will try to
[46:00] discredit that and say that it ain't
[46:02] real
[46:04] Satan will do anything he can to keep
[46:07] that seed from being planted you see
[46:10] because if that seed is planted and if
[46:12] it takes root it is going to produce
[46:14] what it's going to produce it's going to
[46:16] produce like Christ when he was planting
[46:18] in the ground he rose up in Victory and
[46:20] power and when it's planted in your life
[46:22] it will rise up in Victory and power the
[46:25] same way because it's the word that's
[46:27] sown in your heart not some man's ideas
[46:30] but it's the word it's the word of God
[46:32] that we believe it's the word of God
[46:34] that we preach it's the word of God that
[46:37] we've heard and received into our hearts
[46:39] thank you
[46:41] the Bible says Jesus said when he was
[46:43] telling that parable of the of the of
[46:45] the the rich man and Lazarus he said
[46:48] unto him
[46:50] well this is Lazarus that told the rich
[46:52] man he said it down down in in the grave
[46:55] he said if they hear not Moses and the
[46:56] prophets neither will you that will they
[46:59] be persuaded the one rose from the dead
[47:02] that's a description of somebody where
[47:04] the Devil comes and snatches that seed
[47:07] away because even if you saw like they
[47:09] saw Lazarus sitting there at the table
[47:11] with Jesus but yet they would not
[47:13] believe and I was reading this in the
[47:15] scripture today even the Pharisees
[47:17] actually conspired to kill Lazarus
[47:19] because so many people were believing
[47:22] Jesus could you imagine a situation
[47:24] where man's Hearts would get so hard
[47:26] that they would actually see God's word
[47:28] manifested before them and want to kill
[47:31] the proof of it they wanted to kill
[47:33] Lazarus because they knew that people
[47:35] were being converted because of his
[47:37] presence well I want to say to you this
[47:39] afternoon don't let Satan keep you from
[47:42] believing this word is true this gospel
[47:45] is true and it will produce what it says
[47:47] it will
[47:49] oh
[47:51] now the Bible talks about Jesus talked
[47:53] about the when when the word is sown
[47:55] when the seed is sown on Stony ground
[47:57] and he said these are they likewise
[47:59] which are sown on Stony ground who when
[48:01] they have heard the word immediately
[48:04] receive it with gladness so get real
[48:06] happy about it but but it can't take
[48:08] root they have no root in themselves and
[48:11] so endure but for a Time afterward when
[48:14] Affliction or persecution ariseth for
[48:17] the word's sake immediately they are
[48:19] offended now say see they hurt they hear
[48:21] the good news real and it makes them
[48:23] real excited at first but then then Hard
[48:26] Times come and a lot of times hard times
[48:28] don't really come from maybe from your
[48:30] people you work with so much sometimes
[48:32] hard times come from the people that you
[48:35] go to church with and I I think
[48:37] sometimes that ain't really priests
[48:38] preached too much but that's the truth
[48:40] isn't it sometimes sometimes hard things
[48:43] come hard things offenses might come
[48:45] from a preacher offenses might come from
[48:48] a deacon offenses might come from the
[48:49] people that you live with and sometimes
[48:52] sometimes people people will say stuff
[48:54] at church that's a little bit mean or
[48:56] whatever what are you going to do then
[48:57] if you're not rooted and grounded then
[48:59] what are you going to do you're going to
[49:00] say where you started the race well then
[49:03] off you go
[49:04] listen now I I didn't see that at the
[49:07] beginning of my Christian journey and if
[49:08] it's the beginning of yours maybe you
[49:10] won't see it either you look back down
[49:12] the life life's Road and and see all the
[49:14] ones that have just got so offended it's
[49:17] something that was said listen this
[49:19] gospel is not something that needs to be
[49:21] presented to you in a certain way it
[49:23] might be presented one way it might be
[49:25] presented by old Gruff Peter one way or
[49:27] it might be presented on the silver
[49:29] platter to the other but if it's not
[49:31] always presented on a nice gold platter
[49:33] under a little a little thing where they
[49:35] pull it off with or on a on a satin
[49:37] pillar then you can't say well that's
[49:39] not the word of God it's still a word of
[49:42] God even if it's presented from a
[49:44] donkey's mouth like it was when to
[49:46] Balaam even if it's presented to you
[49:48] from a donkey's mouth it's still the
[49:50] word of God somebody that's where the
[49:52] word is sown on Stony ground see what is
[49:54] it is talking about it's talking about
[49:56] people it's talking about us the this is
[49:59] a parable of us not of out there in the
[50:01] field somewhere the quick starter like
[50:03] that like that rabbit that that can't
[50:05] finish the race somebody that's real
[50:06] excited about church but without that
[50:09] stay in power no endurance because
[50:12] they're not rooted no root and when
[50:15] persecution arise persecutions arise
[50:17] immediately they are what offended or is
[50:21] that forgotten beat attitude that keeps
[50:22] coming up blessed are those that are not
[50:25] offended in me
[50:27] you got to be rooted you got to be
[50:29] rooted so you can stand on your own I I
[50:32] think sometimes that fail we fail to
[50:34] understand that God wants us to stand on
[50:36] our own
[50:39] now what that means though in practice
[50:41] now what that means is if somebody says
[50:45] something rough to you you don't just
[50:47] fly off the handle but you're rooted and
[50:49] you know you know what you know what
[50:51] you're here for you know you're
[50:52] predestinated you're ordained to fulfill
[50:55] the word of God and you don't just go
[50:56] run it off somewhere
[50:59] oh you oh
[51:02] offense
[51:04] such a such a strong thing that Jesus
[51:07] even dealt with in the scripture
[51:09] you you think about even that scenario
[51:11] in the Bible when that little woman was
[51:13] was there washing Jesus's feet
[51:15] and she had went through all the
[51:17] naysayers and all the critics to sit to
[51:19] get down at Jesus's feet and begin to
[51:21] wash it and people mocking her and
[51:24] saying well don't Jesus know who that is
[51:26] and and there was a man Judas over to
[51:30] the side that looked at that scene play
[51:32] out and he started getting offended he
[51:35] started to think well I know better than
[51:37] Jesus
[51:38] he said the Bible says that he says why
[51:41] was not this ointment sold for 300 Pence
[51:44] and given to the poor he started judging
[51:48] that scene now see a lot of times it
[51:50] looks like in our from your from a
[51:53] natural perspective that that would make
[51:55] sense
[51:56] that that you'd want to give to the poor
[51:58] that you want to have a cake line and
[52:00] all those kind of things but but Jesus
[52:03] Judas didn't understand
[52:04] he didn't understand what was happening
[52:06] there
[52:07] and it wasn't long before Judas killed
[52:10] the very thing that he claimed to love
[52:14] because he was offended because he got
[52:17] offended
[52:18] you see that that Stony heart when I see
[52:21] Stones sewn on that Stony ground
[52:24] you start getting Afflicted and you feel
[52:26] like something's something's wrong and
[52:28] you feel like what it what it does just
[52:30] like it did with Judas is you start you
[52:33] start hating the preacher now I'm
[52:35] telling you
[52:39] you start but why why why do people hate
[52:42] the preacher why do people get upset at
[52:43] the preachers because they're preaching
[52:45] something that's trying to line up their
[52:47] life to try to correct their life and
[52:49] they'll start something within them is
[52:51] is causing them to to not like the
[52:53] preacher something within them is like
[52:55] you shouldn't have said it like that you
[52:57] shouldn't have done it like that but
[52:59] what about what about Jesus and that
[53:00] woman washing his feet Judah said it
[53:02] shouldn't have been done like that but
[53:04] and he had a good point maybe that
[53:06] ointment that ointment I read in one
[53:08] place would have been about like like
[53:10] twenty thousand dollars of today's money
[53:13] twenty thousand dollars and that woman
[53:15] she broke that glass and washed Jesus's
[53:17] feet with it
[53:18] haha
[53:20] we get so offended about things
[53:23] we're we're eager to hear we're eager to
[53:25] hear things
[53:28] you know you know brother Ryan was he
[53:30] compared it to like a hot house a hot
[53:31] house plan is a plant that it's not
[53:33] rooted in the ground you gotta you gotta
[53:35] constantly move it from one place to the
[53:37] other so he can get when it's raining
[53:39] and sleeting outside you got to move it
[53:40] into that Greenhouse that hot house plan
[53:42] so that it can be in a nice little spot
[53:44] you got to move it over here and move it
[53:47] over there do it and the hot that little
[53:48] plant might say well am I supposed to
[53:50] deal with this am I supposed to just
[53:51] tolerate this and that might be a
[53:53] question we're asking today am I
[53:55] supposed to just let stuff go and the
[53:57] answer is yes am I supposed to just let
[54:01] stuff go when things go wrong yes I'm
[54:04] supposed to just let it go brother Brown
[54:06] said well the hot house plant will say
[54:07] well I'll never go again this is all
[54:10] there is to it oh my no wonder you can't
[54:12] hold that sword of Faith no wonder you
[54:14] compromise on the words you go somewhere
[54:17] where you can hear some kind of a little
[54:18] sisified something put together
[54:22] because that's what a hot house plant
[54:24] wants the hot house plant doesn't want
[54:26] that good nourishment where it's you're
[54:29] digging up around them and digging up
[54:30] all the stone and all the thorns and
[54:32] everything but you see the Stony ground
[54:34] the Stony ground is a problem with your
[54:37] ground it's a problem with the ground
[54:40] offenses and trials and tests will come
[54:42] but what will you do when they do will
[54:44] you give up will you throw in the towel
[54:47] or you will you be rooted and grounded
[54:49] and stay the course
[54:51] I Stony ground is the problem
[54:54] but let God speak to your heart this
[54:56] afternoon
[54:57] soften up your heart to his word there's
[54:59] a promise in Ezekiel chapter 36 that
[55:01] stonly heart can be softened up made a
[55:04] heart of Flesh yield yourself to him
[55:06] don't be critical don't be skeptical
[55:08] somebody come to church somebody be all
[55:10] critical and everything you're going to
[55:12] get what you expect like brother Adam
[55:13] said don't be hardened to the preacher
[55:16] don't don't want the preacher to
[55:18] struggle but desire to receive from God
[55:20] because your heart you won't you want to
[55:23] have a heart that can receive that word
[55:25] in the good ground
[55:27] into good ground
[55:29] let me just say something here
[55:31] listen you can we I think sometimes we
[55:34] battle so much with offenses and things
[55:36] and we think we think we almost
[55:38] normalize being offended but listen you
[55:41] can come to a place
[55:42] where it don't bother you
[55:45] and God wants you to come to a place
[55:47] where it don't bother you
[55:48] God wants you to come to a place where
[55:50] listen it listen I remember when I
[55:52] started preaching I used to preach about
[55:54] how you need to I was thinking about
[55:56] this one of my very first sermons was
[55:58] you got to come to a place where
[56:00] somebody looks you in the face and says
[56:02] I don't think you got the Holy Ghost and
[56:04] it doesn't bother you
[56:05] he you got to come to that place where
[56:08] somebody if somebody says something rude
[56:10] it doesn't bother you
[56:11] now it gets real quiet here I feel like
[56:14] I feel like it does when brother Louise
[56:16] was preaching
[56:19] well listen I hope I hope I hope you
[56:22] love me
[56:23] bye
[56:24] I thought I thought this was going to be
[56:26] a real uplifting sermon and y'all
[56:28] [Laughter]
[56:31] the Bible says and these which are sown
[56:33] among Thorns such as hear the words and
[56:36] the cares of this world and the
[56:37] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[56:39] other things entering in choke the word
[56:41] and it become unfruitful now if somebody
[56:44] you think about this now
[56:46] somebody wants to be a good Christian
[56:48] sitting out there and they're hear the
[56:50] word but then all these cares and all
[56:53] these other things begin to begin to
[56:55] grow why because what you what you what
[56:57] you allow to plant in your ground those
[57:01] Thorns have a seed too and you've
[57:03] allowed it to get in your ground and
[57:05] begin to grow up around and choke it out
[57:07] all that all them romance novels you
[57:10] listening to and all that stuff you
[57:12] listen to and all the false preaching
[57:13] and all the and all the wrong ideas that
[57:16] you've allowed to root in your mind and
[57:19] in your heart and what it is somebody
[57:22] looking for a reason to not believe
[57:24] what somebody that's Desiring to be a
[57:27] Christian without being changed I want
[57:28] to be Christian but I still want all
[57:30] these things in the world I still want
[57:31] to I still want to go out and and and
[57:33] Gamble and and
[57:35] I'm I'm skirting around some stuff so

[57:43] the when you love the world more than
[57:45] God my my listen my when you say well I
[57:48] I would go to church but now my family
[57:51] is going to be real offended if I go to
[57:52] church so I I'd rather just I I want to
[57:55] I want to make sure that I give more
[57:57] precedence to my family and everything
[57:58] they're having this special event and
[58:00] every other Sunday is having a special
[58:02] event so I'm gonna go over there my
[58:04] family's doing something I want to show
[58:06] them my love and win them over to Christ
[58:08] but that's not how you show the love of
[58:10] Christ you show the love of Christ by by
[58:14] obeying his word and doing what his word
[58:16] says putting God first is that what
[58:19] Jesus said when he was telling all these
[58:20] Parables about he said that all these
[58:22] people were invited to a feast invited
[58:25] to to come and gather and one said well
[58:27] I bought a piece of ground and I must
[58:29] need to go see it I pray they have me
[58:31] excused I bought a piece of ground over
[58:33] here and after I bought it I got to go
[58:35] check it out all these excuses all these
[58:38] reasons all these Thorns that are
[58:40] growing up excuses reasons to not let it
[58:43] is preventing that seed of the word from
[58:45] growing and taking root in you I bought
[58:47] five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them
[58:49] I pray that he had me excused I bought
[58:51] five yoga oxen and I gotta go see these
[58:54] rather than go to the feast I got to go
[58:56] take care of this over here I've married
[58:58] a wife and therefore I cannot come
[59:00] a thorn a thorn that pokes and hurts and
[59:04] and it when you hear the word of God
[59:06] being preached and but yet it's poking
[59:08] at you my friends won't like me if I
[59:10] live like that
[59:12] I'll be embarrassed if I get up and
[59:14] raise my hands I'll be embarrassed if I
[59:16] say if I if I say Amen I'll be I I can't
[59:20] that thorn that's poking you I can't go
[59:23] to church on Sunday because we got this
[59:25] special event that only happens every
[59:27] now and again and I got to do this
[59:29] because my family wants me to do it and
[59:31] I got to show them love what about God
[59:35] the first commandment is to love the
[59:37] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[59:39] thy Soul that's the first commandment
[59:41] above every other commandment to put God
[59:43] first above everything else above
[59:45] everything else when you want to be
[59:47] popular so you don't you want to you
[59:49] want to dress like the world and live
[59:50] like the world that's that thorn
[59:51] creeping in you want to you go to school
[59:54] and everybody's dressing a certain way
[59:56] and you think well I got to be I got to
[59:58] dip my toe into those worldly Waters
[1:00:00] that's that thorn creeping in thorns and
[1:00:02] Pricks are the problems the problem of a
[1:00:04] heart that's not right so let's get rid
[1:00:07] of all those Thorns the prickly thoughts
[1:00:09] and desires all the lust of anything
[1:00:11] contrary to the world let's get rid of
[1:00:13] it let's root it all out so that the
[1:00:15] word of God can be planted in our heart
[1:00:17] what's all these Thorns all these video
[1:00:20] games and romance novels and even
[1:00:22] housework if there's anything that can
[1:00:25] keep you from the word of God or from
[1:00:27] doing what God wants you to do from
[1:00:28] church and from your prayer life
[1:00:31] which sometimes we even let family
[1:00:33] interfere with our prayer life we're let
[1:00:35] with we'll let to think that we would
[1:00:38] let birthdays and anniversaries
[1:00:39] interfere with our prayer life and
[1:00:41] without with our time with God all those
[1:00:44] Thorns that are creeping in so that the
[1:00:46] word of God cannot be planted in your
[1:00:47] heart because it's a heart problem you
[1:00:50] would rather go to the birthday party or
[1:00:52] the anniversary party or something than
[1:00:54] to to go where you're supposed to go
[1:00:57] what you allow in your field will slowly
[1:01:00] take over
[1:01:02] brother right now I was reading this
[1:01:03] this message where he he was preaching
[1:01:05] away and he said he said is somebody up
[1:01:07] in the balcony would say
[1:01:09] I wonder if he discerned that there was
[1:01:11] somebody up in the balcony that had a
[1:01:12] problem
[1:01:13] he said brother Brown I once had the
[1:01:15] victory I once was a Godly person
[1:01:18] but somehow another the wees and the
[1:01:20] thorns and things has choked me down I'm
[1:01:23] not where I ought to be I know I'm not
[1:01:25] pray for me brother Branham now he was
[1:01:28] asking that asking that to the
[1:01:30] congregation and and I could repeat
[1:01:31] those words tonight and ask you that if
[1:01:33] there's all these storms and things that
[1:01:35] have encroached on your life to where
[1:01:37] you know that you're not where you need
[1:01:38] to be then then maybe tonight that you
[1:01:41] could just reach out to God by faith and
[1:01:43] say God forgive me I from now on I want
[1:01:45] to change I want to be different I want
[1:01:47] something different in my life I want to
[1:01:49] get all those storms and all that Stony
[1:01:50] ground cleared up because I want to have
[1:01:53] a good ground in my heart where the word
[1:01:55] of God can take root and be planted and
[1:01:57] reproduce
[1:01:58] and that's where the Bible says in
[1:02:00] Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 8 but other
[1:02:02] fell into good ground
[1:02:04] and brought forth fruit
[1:02:06] summon 100fold some 64 some 30-fold
[1:02:11] in the good ground now that's the kind
[1:02:13] of ground that we want to be tonight
[1:02:14] isn't it
[1:02:15] the kind of ground that can produce
[1:02:18] fruit
[1:02:19] there's a promise that if the seed falls
[1:02:21] into good ground it will bring forth
[1:02:23] forward I want you to take that home
[1:02:25] with you tonight and as you're driving
[1:02:27] home let that Echo around in that space
[1:02:30] in your skull that there is a promise
[1:02:33] that if that seed falls into good ground
[1:02:36] it will bring forth
[1:02:39] it will bring forth if it falls into
[1:02:41] good ground so let me be good ground how
[1:02:44] many wants to bring forth tonight you
[1:02:46] want to bring forth then be good ground
[1:02:48] if there's something wrong in my life
[1:02:50] say oh God take out take out everything
[1:02:52] that's wrong in my life because I want
[1:02:54] to be the kind of good ground brother
[1:02:56] I'm sitting now the seed you people here
[1:02:58] who are farmers every seed will produce
[1:03:01] if it's in the right kind of ground and
[1:03:04] every Divine promise of God in the Bible
[1:03:06] will produce if it's met in the right
[1:03:09] kind of a heart it'll produce the
[1:03:11] promise now every means every every
[1:03:15] don't mean some but every promise in the
[1:03:18] Bible will produce if it falls into good
[1:03:21] ground oh this this might be a simple
[1:03:24] sermon tonight but it's a rich sermon
[1:03:26] because it's a promise there that you
[1:03:28] can lay claim to tonight that if you'll
[1:03:30] just open up the door of your heart and
[1:03:32] let that word of God sink down in there
[1:03:34] and begin to take root and say I believe
[1:03:36] how do you do that I believe it I
[1:03:38] believe it despite everything that I see
[1:03:40] I believe it despite everything that I
[1:03:43] hear or feel because I'm not looking to
[1:03:45] my circumstances but I'm looking to the
[1:03:48] Unseen I'm looking to a real that cannot
[1:03:51] be discerned by my natural eye I'm
[1:03:53] looking to the promises of God and that
[1:03:56] will produce it will produce because
[1:03:58] it's a promise brother ever said if you
[1:04:01] have need of Salvation believe that he
[1:04:04] saved you and accept his sacrificial
[1:04:06] death and you shall receive what you've
[1:04:09] asked for if you're in need of Salvation
[1:04:11] tonight if you'll believe it then you
[1:04:13] will receive it if you're weary and
[1:04:16] gloomy and feel like that everyone's
[1:04:18] against you come unto me all ye that
[1:04:21] labor in her heavy laden and I will give
[1:04:23] you rest that's a seed accepted
[1:04:26] and if you're sick he was wounded for
[1:04:28] our transgressions with his stripes
[1:04:31] we're healed accept it it's a seed we'll
[1:04:34] produce the whole do you see what that
[1:04:36] seed is that Original Seed was Christ
[1:04:39] the sea that was the seed that was with
[1:04:42] God in John 1 1 and that sea was
[1:04:45] manifested in flesh and planted in the
[1:04:47] ground and rose again every word that we
[1:04:50] preach and every word that we hear was
[1:04:52] sown by the son of man that means that
[1:04:54] every word that we're hearing is part of
[1:04:57] that Original Seed what I'm preaching to
[1:05:00] you tonight is not just something that
[1:05:01] I'm making up on the fly but it's the
[1:05:04] word of God and if you receive it you
[1:05:07] are receiving God himself let it take
[1:05:10] root in you and it will reproduce and be
[1:05:12] born in you
[1:05:14] that's what what is the seed in Acts
[1:05:16] chapter 2 it says the promise is to you
[1:05:19] and to your children to those way off as
[1:05:23] many as the Lord will call and that's a
[1:05:25] sea that if you receive it you can
[1:05:28] receive that promise and James chapter 5
[1:05:31] verse 15 it says the prayer of faith
[1:05:34] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[1:05:38] raise him up and if he have committed
[1:05:40] sins they shall be forgiven him that's a
[1:05:43] seed that if you'll take let it take
[1:05:45] root in your heart tonight right now
[1:05:48] your sins can be forgiven you if you
[1:05:51] will believe it oh you think well I've
[1:05:52] gone too far I've done something too bad
[1:05:54] I I I I I I need to do Penance and all
[1:05:58] these things what you need to do is
[1:06:00] accept what God has already done for you
[1:06:03] and believe it and let it take root in
[1:06:05] your life let it take root and make good
[1:06:08] ground and accept your deliverance the
[1:06:11] Bible says in James 5 16 the effect
[1:06:13] sexual fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:06:16] availeth much now there's a seed that if
[1:06:18] we'll take to our prayer chamber
[1:06:20] something will happen if you go to your
[1:06:22] prayer chamber and believe that your
[1:06:25] prayer will do something something will
[1:06:28] produce
[1:06:29] in Isaiah 53 it says he was wounded for
[1:06:32] our transgressions he was bruised for
[1:06:35] our iniquities the chastisement of our
[1:06:38] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:06:40] we are healed there is something that I
[1:06:42] can receive for myself and believe and
[1:06:45] it will produce what will it produce
[1:06:47] deliverance from my iniquities
[1:06:49] forgiveness of my sins it will produce
[1:06:52] healing in my body it'll produce a body
[1:06:54] change Psalm chapter 103 says oh my soul
[1:06:58] forget not all his benefits now that's a
[1:07:01] scripture we quote a lot of times why
[1:07:02] because we forget we forget what we've
[1:07:05] got access to that you've got benefits
[1:07:07] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[1:07:11] healeth all thy diseases plant I want
[1:07:14] that seed to be planted in your heart
[1:07:16] tonight and it will produce will it
[1:07:18] produce at all your iniquities will be
[1:07:20] forgiven all your diseases will be
[1:07:24] healed if you can believe if you can
[1:07:26] believe
[1:07:28] it will reproduce
[1:07:31] Psalm chapter 92 said those that be
[1:07:33] planted in the house of the Lord shall
[1:07:35] flourish in the courts of our God they
[1:07:37] shall bring forth fruit and old age they
[1:07:39] shall be fat and flourishing who's going
[1:07:41] to flourish those that that Gardener has
[1:07:44] planted if he's planted you and rooted
[1:07:46] you'll be like a tree that's planted by
[1:07:48] the rivers of water those that are
[1:07:51] planted are going to produce
[1:07:54] whether when the word if you're
[1:07:58] when the word is planted in you
[1:08:01] you got to die to all your ideas
[1:08:04] for life to be born
[1:08:07] brother said you have to die
[1:08:10] you have to die before you can be reborn
[1:08:14] any seed has to die before it's
[1:08:16] regenerated again
[1:08:18] unless it dies it abides alone
[1:08:21] a man has got to die to his own thinking
[1:08:23] he's got to die to the thinking of
[1:08:26] anything but God's word had come his way
[1:08:28] that's God's ground
[1:08:30] so if we can die to our pride if we can
[1:08:33] lay aside all of our pride and lay aside
[1:08:35] all of our Envy oh if we can lay aside
[1:08:38] our pride I think that's that holds us
[1:08:40] back from receiving so many blessings
[1:08:42] Pride manifests itself in kind of weird
[1:08:44] forms sometimes
[1:08:46] sometimes we'll be so prideful that we
[1:08:48] don't want to admit that there's
[1:08:49] something wrong in our family or in our
[1:08:51] children's lives and our pride will try
[1:08:54] to cover that up and try to try to have
[1:08:56] this appearance that everything's good
[1:08:57] but I I want to encourage you just lay
[1:09:00] your pride on the Altar and just
[1:09:03] I remember when my kids were going
[1:09:05] through I've done many things wrong but
[1:09:07] one thing I did write was I used to tell
[1:09:08] these ministers and you could testify of
[1:09:10] it when you preach you feel that Liberty
[1:09:12] to preach on my kids because we listen
[1:09:14] if you lay your pride lay your pride
[1:09:16] down lay your pride on the altars where
[1:09:19] you're not you're not trying to keep
[1:09:20] somebody from from preaching something
[1:09:22] that will help your family lay your
[1:09:25] pride down so that when you go when you
[1:09:27] go home from A good sermon that you're
[1:09:28] not saying well I don't know if he said
[1:09:30] it right or whatever lay aside all your
[1:09:32] Envy lay aside all your jealousy you've
[1:09:36] got to die to yourself and die to the
[1:09:38] way that you think it should be you
[1:09:40] don't want to be a Judas that kills the
[1:09:42] very thing that you say that you love
[1:09:44] lay aside all of your criticism lay
[1:09:47] aside everything so that you'll have
[1:09:49] nothing left but good ground that the
[1:09:51] word can be received and be born in lay
[1:09:54] aside every week that so easily besets
[1:09:57] us don't worry about what your
[1:09:58] neighbor's thinking about be concerned
[1:10:01] with what God thinks if you're concerned
[1:10:03] with what God thanks and everything will
[1:10:05] work itself out
[1:10:06] oh and we could just forget about what
[1:10:08] our neighbor thinks forget about what
[1:10:10] your neighbor thinks about how you
[1:10:12] praise God or how you raise your hand
[1:10:14] forget about what your neighbor thinks
[1:10:16] take what the son of man sowed and
[1:10:19] receive it into your heart
[1:10:21] if we could just die you know Jesus
[1:10:24] when he heard about Lazarus he waited
[1:10:27] for four days so he could be good and
[1:10:30] dead
[1:10:31] so that he could come forth and be a
[1:10:33] living testimony and sit there beside
[1:10:36] him at that feast and everybody would
[1:10:38] look at him and see that God's word was
[1:10:40] true but he had to wait till he was dead
[1:10:43] he waited till Lazarus was dead Elijah
[1:10:46] to that widow woman and she had to she
[1:10:49] had to die to her own ideas when Elijah
[1:10:51] said you first you're gonna make make
[1:10:53] some food for me if she wouldn't have
[1:10:55] done that would she have received her
[1:10:57] blessing but she died to her own
[1:10:59] thinking and and she she first fed
[1:11:02] Elijah the last little bit that she had
[1:11:05] because she was willing to die if we can
[1:11:07] be willing to till up the ground and
[1:11:10] break up that ground and Grub out all
[1:11:12] the greenbriars and all the stickers and
[1:11:14] all the thorns and all the roots of
[1:11:16] bitterness it'll bring down the holy
[1:11:18] spirit in our lives and we can get
[1:11:20] serious with God because why is the
[1:11:23] ground that matters the ground that
[1:11:25] matters the ground is the thing that
[1:11:27] matters you're actually growing up from
[1:11:30] the Earth
[1:11:31] you were predestinated to fulfill his
[1:11:33] word so keep your Vineyard eat the right
[1:11:36] food like brother Aaron was preaching on
[1:11:38] the other night and look at the right
[1:11:39] thing he's entertaining the right things
[1:11:40] because it matters what you allow to
[1:11:43] take root in your life
[1:11:45] be planted in Christ and you'll grow up
[1:11:47] like a tree
[1:11:49] the Bible says in Psalm chapter 1
[1:11:52] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:11:54] rivers of water
[1:11:55] that bringeth forth his fruit and his
[1:11:57] season his Leaf also shall not wither
[1:11:59] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[1:12:02] the ungodly are not so but are like the
[1:12:04] chaff which the wind driveth away
[1:12:07] what kind of chaff can we see examples
[1:12:09] of in the Bible that Cain Cain that was
[1:12:11] just like his life was blown away to
[1:12:13] nothing because he was fine with being
[1:12:16] around the message but he didn't want to
[1:12:18] receive the word that Abel had
[1:12:21] Balaam that liked religion but he didn't
[1:12:24] want to receive he didn't want to
[1:12:25] recognize that the pillar of fire was in
[1:12:27] that camp of the Israelites a lot that
[1:12:30] liked being real close to the to the
[1:12:32] world but not enough he liked he liked
[1:12:34] the message he liked Abraham's message
[1:12:36] but not enough to leave the world Judas
[1:12:39] that he liked being happy and half out
[1:12:41] second Timothy says having a form of
[1:12:43] godliness but denying the power of the
[1:12:45] world and what is your power this
[1:12:47] afternoon the power is the word if
[1:12:49] you'll accept the seed of the word as so
[1:12:52] let it be sown into your heart you're
[1:12:54] that good ground like Abel that wanted
[1:12:57] the word and Moses and Abraham that were
[1:12:59] the word for their day
[1:13:01] and when the seed is planted
[1:13:04] what is ever ever a good Gardener do
[1:13:07] when the seed is planted what are you
[1:13:09] going to do you're going to water it
[1:13:11] yeah when that seed is planted the rain
[1:13:14] will fall
[1:13:16] okay
[1:13:18] and I'm closing here in just a few
[1:13:20] minutes
[1:13:22] Elijah that story of Elijah that we were
[1:13:24] telling earlier
[1:13:26] he destroyed the priest of the of of
[1:13:29] Baal and destroyed destroyed all the
[1:13:32] those priests about the Bale Baal what
[1:13:35] he was
[1:13:37] bail was this they believed that he was
[1:13:39] the fertility God
[1:13:41] and uh since we're a mixed audience I
[1:13:44] try to try to be a little bit vague with
[1:13:47] this but the rain would actually uh bail
[1:13:52] with the fertility God would cause the
[1:13:54] rain to fall on the Earth and the Earth
[1:13:56] would receive the rain in in an act
[1:13:59] we'll say it like that and the result of
[1:14:03] the ACT would be the fruit of the earth
[1:14:06] coming up all the all the the Harvest
[1:14:09] coming up and you see what they were
[1:14:11] what they were worshiping they were
[1:14:13] worshiping this fertility God that
[1:14:15] caused the skies to open up and Reign
[1:14:17] now see Elijah came forth and he tore he
[1:14:20] he killed all those all those Priests of
[1:14:22] Baal and and he first thing Elijah did
[1:14:26] and and in First Kings chapter 17 was he
[1:14:28] says rain's not going to come until I
[1:14:31] call for it not when Baal calls for it
[1:14:34] not when all these priests are bail that
[1:14:36] say they can do something but when I
[1:14:38] call for her and Elijah came through and
[1:14:40] he cleared all those he killed all the
[1:14:43] priests of Baal and he erected He
[1:14:46] restored that altar of the Living God
[1:14:48] just like the word is being the Elijah
[1:14:52] and this day was sent to restore the
[1:14:54] word that we believe and after he
[1:14:57] rebuilt the altar then he looked up and
[1:14:59] he saw a little cloud like a like the
[1:15:01] size of a man's Fist and it started
[1:15:03] getting bigger and he said there's a
[1:15:05] sound of abundance of rain and you see
[1:15:08] what happens when you receive the word
[1:15:09] of God in your heart
[1:15:11] the rain is going to fall
[1:15:13] and it's going to Quicken it brother
[1:15:16] said the preaching of the word brings
[1:15:18] his presence
[1:15:19] the working of Miracles brings his
[1:15:21] presence the preaching of the Gospel the
[1:15:24] word is what brings his presence
[1:15:27] now sometimes we say well I wonder if
[1:15:29] God's going to be with us tonight but if
[1:15:31] the word is here God is going to be here
[1:15:33] because there's a promise the promises
[1:15:36] that God God is always with his word
[1:15:39] the preaching of the Gospel unlocks the
[1:15:42] Holy Ghost to the Jews in Acts chapter
[1:15:44] 2. and on the preaching of the Gospel is
[1:15:47] what did that when Peter came out and he
[1:15:49] began to preach the preaching of the
[1:15:51] Gospel is what unlocked the Holy Ghost
[1:15:53] to the Samaritans in Acts chapter 8 and
[1:15:56] this would unlock the Holy Ghost to the
[1:15:58] Gentiles in Acts chapter 10.
[1:16:01] and it will do the same today
[1:16:05] whosoever will let him come
[1:16:07] if the word will sink into your heart
[1:16:09] the rain will water him
[1:16:12] there's a promise laying there in the
[1:16:13] Bible of Joel chapter 2 and it shall
[1:16:15] come to pass afterward that I will pour
[1:16:17] out my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[1:16:20] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[1:16:22] your old men shall dream dreams your
[1:16:24] young men shall see visions and also
[1:16:27] upon the servants and upon the handmaids
[1:16:29] in those days will I pour out my spirit
[1:16:31] brother Adam said and believe in God he
[1:16:33] said brother I believe that right now at
[1:16:35] this minute
[1:16:36] that the power of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:16:38] in this room to cheer every sick person
[1:16:40] there is that you could feel the cloud
[1:16:42] the size of a man's hand he's talking
[1:16:44] about that cloud that Elijah saw
[1:16:46] and holler I hear the sound of perfect
[1:16:49] healing if you reject and say well I
[1:16:51] didn't get nothing then they'll die out
[1:16:53] the hot waves of hell and doubt will
[1:16:55] fade it out of your soul but when you
[1:16:57] get that little grain of seed
[1:16:59] stand on it when that seed is sown in
[1:17:03] your heart you hang on to that
[1:17:05] it ain't like the Rock of Gibraltar but
[1:17:07] like the Rock of Ages stand there and
[1:17:10] you'll feel the sound of abundance of
[1:17:12] rain the word of faith what was the word
[1:17:14] given the word of faith was given like
[1:17:16] like when when when Peter preached on
[1:17:19] the day of Pentecost and preached to the
[1:17:20] Samaritans and preached to the Gentiles
[1:17:22] the word was given to unlock every
[1:17:25] promise it was given to unlock the power
[1:17:28] of the Holy Ghost in your life that's
[1:17:30] what the word is for the word of faith
[1:17:32] was given to open up the windows of
[1:17:35] heaven so that the word can be manifest
[1:17:37] in your life the word of faith was given
[1:17:40] to make the Bible live that's what the
[1:17:42] Holy Ghost is it's the word of a page
[1:17:45] living in action in you brother Rama
[1:17:48] said and looking unto Jesus as the
[1:17:49] musicians come forward he said the
[1:17:51] spirit makes the word to live to the
[1:17:54] promise in other words it's a seed the
[1:17:58] spirit gives us life it unctionizes it
[1:18:01] gives it its go like rain gives to the
[1:18:05] Sea this bird in the ground it breaks
[1:18:07] forth life
[1:18:09] and in Satan's eating he said the Holy
[1:18:11] Ghost is the action in you it's a life
[1:18:14] not an emotion not some sort of a
[1:18:17] fleshly evidence
[1:18:18] but it is a person Jesus Christ the word
[1:18:22] of God established in your heart to
[1:18:24] Quicken every word of this age and the
[1:18:26] end time seed sign he said take his word
[1:18:29] and believe it hold it in your heart and
[1:18:32] when the rain begins to fall life will
[1:18:34] take hold and the word will manifest
[1:18:37] itself
