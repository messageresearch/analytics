[4:44] to be in the house of the Lord but again
[4:45] thank y'all so much for this weekend it
[4:47] meant a whole whole lot to me um seeing
[4:50] them back again that I was raised with
[4:52] Brother Richard Brother Richard was was
[4:54] kind of like my second dad when we first
[4:56] came in message in 1968 I think we met
[4:59] Brother Richard and them after we had
[5:00] started this church so it was probably
[5:02] 72 73 him and brother Woodby his
[5:05] brother-in-law was a a pastor of the
[5:08] church there where brother Andre is now
[5:11] in Irwin and we made many many trips
[5:13] there and they made many many trips here
[5:16] and uh the preaching like you heard
[5:17] Sunday that's the kind of preaching we
[5:19] grew up with so um it's powerful it's
[5:23] it's I was listening to a brother uh
[5:25] brother Chad Lamb um yesterday and he he
[5:29] said it's easy but it's hard it's simple
[5:34] but it's complicated it's what you make
[5:36] out of it if you want the complicated to
[5:39] become simple ask God cuz he said he
[5:43] never he's not going to confuse us the
[5:45] only confusion is as devil gets involved
[5:47] and says oh you can't really understand
[5:49] that well listen if brother Brandon
[5:51] preached it if it's on
[5:52] tape then we're privileged to it and
[5:56] we're privileged to preach it and he
[5:58] said he preached a big nugget so that we
[6:00] can break it down into little nuggets so
[6:03] we can really understand the word of God
[6:05] and I sure appreciate those two brothers
[6:07] we're going to get brother Harris to
[6:08] come preach for us in a couple of months
[6:10] and also brother Steven Wilson his
[6:12] brother Richard son is a mighty good
[6:14] preacher too so um I appreciate them U
[6:17] coming and doing what they did and U I
[6:20] hope you enjoyed it cuz I sure
[6:22] did St Augustine said faith is to
[6:25] believe what you do not see the reward
[6:28] for this faith is to see what you
[6:32] believe faith is to believe what you do
[6:35] not see the reward of this faith is to
[6:39] see what you believe think about that
[6:45] Amen brother Lise remember them I think
[6:47] they've already landed in Canada or
[6:49] they're getting close and brother
[6:51] Michael and sister Nyla will be with
[6:53] them this Sunday will'll be communion in
[6:55] foot washing brother Luis will be gone
[6:57] for a little while we stopped by to see
[6:58] brother Donnie he's doing a lot better
[7:01] and uh he was up out of the bed and into
[7:02] a chair so just uh if you go talk to him
[7:06] just don't tell a lot of jokes don't get
[7:08] make me laugh cuz with eight broke ribs
[7:11] ain't fun but remember that brother
[7:14] Daryl W to be here in a couple of weeks

[9:40] sins and bless in Jesus name amen all
[9:43] right sard Ean Church age we might get
[9:45] to it tonight part four let's read
[9:47] Revelations 1 through 10 I was in the
[9:52] spirit on the Lord's day it doesn't look
[9:54] good over on this side but is it okay
[9:56] over
[9:57] there oh that's cuz of a glare okay
[10:00] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[10:02] and the last and what thou seest write
[10:04] in a book and send into the seven
[10:05] churches which are in Asia Ephesus
[10:07] Smyrna pergamus th Sardis Philadelphia
[10:11] and L out of sin Let me just add
[10:12] something real quick as Brother Richard
[10:14] was talking this weekend we're in the
[10:17] we're in the open book we know that
[10:18] right all right we're in the open book
[10:20] age we're in the book where the lamb
[10:21] takes the book and he breaks the seals
[10:24] well now the lamb is there to speak to
[10:27] these groups of people Ephesus all all
[10:29] the way through but as Brother Richard
[10:31] was saying they don't get the son of man
[10:33] Revelation like we do all right now
[10:35] we've been over Son of God Son of Man
[10:37] son of David we'll go over it again but
[10:40] the Son of God is the Holy Ghost that's
[10:42] what I've been preaching for the past
[10:43] through all the church ages all you're
[10:45] going to see is a Son of
[10:47] God all right that's all you're going to
[10:49] see is the Son of God working in a group
[10:52] of
[10:54] people amen don't get quiet it's just
[10:56] Wednesday night but the headstone was
[10:58] rejected Ed and was taken off the scene
[11:01] and by the by the slight of the devil he
[11:05] corrupted the word so much through
[11:08] denominational ideas we'll read it today
[11:10] till he called her the great and
[11:12] the great had harlots God hates
[11:15] that thing he hates it but he allowed
[11:18] somebody like Martin Luther to come up
[11:20] in it we'll look at that in just a
[11:21] minute but these are working
[11:24] under get Born Again live a good
[11:27] Christian Life do do the things that a
[11:30] messenger under their messenger and then
[11:33] die and wait in the sixth Dimension but
[11:35] now you and I and Lea we've been called
[11:37] out of that age and you and I are in a
[11:40] different time if you're in Leia you're
[11:42] still in time but if you are born again
[11:45] tonight you have been caught up out of
[11:48] Leota and you are sitting in Heavenly
[11:50] places in Christ Jesus now listen don't
[11:53] say that to your
[11:56] flesh say that to that guy that's on the
[12:00] inside I'm sitting in Heavenly places
[12:02] tonight I'm exactly where I want to
[12:05] be maybe y or
[12:08] not and I turned to see the voice that
[12:10] spake with me and being turned I saw
[12:11] seven golden candlesticks which are The
[12:13] Seven Ages and when he looked he looked
[12:16] one like unto the son of man which was
[12:19] what the son of man is God in a human
[12:23] flesh now remember the Son of God is a
[12:26] spirit God it still is this theophany it
[12:29] who God is but he's revealing himself in
[12:32] a different way he's allowing Martin
[12:34] Luther under that Son of God Revelation
[12:36] to be able to to preach a father son
[12:39] Holy Ghost baptism to preach that
[12:41] there's an eternal hell to preach the
[12:43] he's allowing that to happen why because
[12:45] he said the corn of wheat's got to fall
[12:47] on the
[12:48] ground and then it's got to come back to
[12:51] the original as Brother Richard was
[12:52] talking about the Alpha and Omega the
[12:53] book ends the son of man the son of man
[12:55] closed out the Old Testament son of
[12:57] man's got to close out the new test
[12:59] which is standing here today there is no
[13:01] other way no other form he's going to be
[13:03] in all right and in the midst of the
[13:06] seven candle sticks one liken the son of
[13:08] man clothed with the Garment down to the
[13:09] foot and gird back the PS with the
[13:11] golden girdle you can be seated the Lord
[13:13] as his Blessing to the reading the word
[13:15] now let's read about Sardis and then
[13:16] we'll back up just a minute because I
[13:17] want to cover
[13:19] something until the angel of the Church
[13:21] of Sardis write these things sayith he
[13:23] that has the seven spirits of God and
[13:26] the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that
[13:28] thou Hast a name look thou Hast a name
[13:30] that thou livest and are dead all right
[13:34] is everybody with me all right Be
[13:36] watchful and strengthen the things which
[13:39] remain that are ready to die for I have
[13:42] not found th found thy works perfect
[13:45] before God in other words coming out of
[13:48] this into this church age there's going
[13:50] to be doctrines that God a going to
[13:53] like but as brother R said he winked at
[13:56] their ignorance that there wasn't enough
[13:58] word for them to get out of that cuz
[14:00] remember we're going to read in
[14:01] Revelations where the Bible tells us to
[14:03] come out of her who's
[14:07] her who's her you got to know where you
[14:10] come out
[14:11] of to make sure you're separated from it
[14:15] so her is the great the great
[14:18] had harlot's denominations sorry
[14:21] but that's the truth all right I I Know
[14:24] Thy works that thou Hast a name that
[14:26] thou livest and are dead listen father
[14:28] son Holy Ghost is not
[14:30] names they're titles to a name that
[14:34] baptism is false it's not even in the
[14:37] Bible you say oh yeah it is Jesus said
[14:39] it he was telling us how to do
[14:42] it cuz Peter did exactly what Jesus said
[14:46] right cuz he had the keys to the kingdom
[14:48] right for I have not found thy works
[14:51] perfect before
[14:53] God remember therefore how thou Hast
[14:55] received and heard and hold fast and
[14:58] repent now here he is again every Church
[15:00] age God says you're doing this wrong
[15:02] repent you're doing this wrong repent if
[15:04] you'll do this I'll do this so
[15:07] repentance means a
[15:09] lot if therefore Thou shalt not watch I
[15:12] will come on thee as a thief and thou
[15:14] shalt not know what hour I will come
[15:16] upon thee thou Hast a few names even in
[15:19] Sardis which have not defiled my name a
[15:22] few names in Sardis there was a group of
[15:26] people that still believed that the Lord
[15:28] Jesus Christ was the name of almighty
[15:30] God not the second person of a trinity
[15:33] which is not even in the Bible has
[15:35] anybody read that n in book Nia book Nia
[15:38] nian counsel if you hadn't I'll give you
[15:40] the book and you can read it but we
[15:42] going to check it out like a library
[15:44] book and I'm going to charge you if you
[15:46] don't get it back in a month or
[15:48] two my daddy a long time ago he said
[15:50] don't ever give somebody a book and they
[15:53] tell you they're going to give it back
[15:55] usually they don't they have a few names
[15:58] even in start which have not defiled
[16:00] their garments and they shall walk with
[16:02] men white for they are worthy there is a
[16:03] bride in every Church age doesn't matter
[16:05] how bad it is doesn't matter how bad it
[16:07] looks how dark it looks there is a group
[16:09] of people that takes the message of the
[16:13] hour and lives
[16:17] it he that overcometh the same shall be
[16:19] clothed in white rment well there you go
[16:22] and I will not blot out his name out of
[16:24] The Book of Life CU we're going to read
[16:25] about that in just for a second but I
[16:27] will confess his name before my father
[16:30] and before his angels he that hath near
[16:33] let him hear what the spirit saith to
[16:35] the churches so real quick here's the
[16:37] here's the chart and you're going to see
[16:38] part of it but we're going to get right
[16:40] here to Luther that's where we're at the
[16:41] sardian church age went from 1520 to
[16:45] 1750 and during that time from from 1520
[16:49] to 1906 which is the man anointing
[16:52] according to the Bible we'll read that
[16:54] in just a minute right there is your uh
[16:57] heading into 190 six is you're an
[16:59] industrial age but all the print and
[17:01] presses and all the things I got a whole
[17:03] list of things steam turbine telescopes
[17:06] thermometers knitting machines Water
[17:08] Wheels pocket watches microscope
[17:11] submarines believe that adding machines
[17:14] pressure cookers pianis steam
[17:18] engine dictionary steam ship bifocal
[17:21] glasses thank God parachutes bicycles
[17:25] gas lighting cotton genin small poox
[17:28] vaccine
[17:30] batteries Tesla really appreciated
[17:33] that but the first print press was in
[17:36] that was put together the first print
[17:38] and press that was that was I guess used
[17:41] was in
[17:42] 1440 but it was very crude and and and
[17:47] horribly built but in 1634 which is
[17:51] about what in the middle of the sardian
[17:53] church age
[17:54] 1634 the first PR and press started
[17:57] producing
[18:00] written letters and and paper and um
[18:05] newspapers I guess you might say and
[18:08] things like that was in 1634 so this is
[18:10] considered the man age which is the
[18:12] intelligence man is intelligent all
[18:14] right it's the intelligence but it's
[18:16] also remember the intelligence of God
[18:19] the intelligence of God comes first and
[18:21] then what happens is man man perverts it
[18:32] always but from Columba we're going to
[18:34] look at it back in just a second Columba
[18:36] to Luther the the the
[18:38] 16006 606 to 1520 was 900 years of
[18:43] nothing but horrible Catholic rule 68
[18:48] million Christians were killed according
[18:51] to the Catholic Church they said that so
[18:53] this is not hearsay this is not
[18:55] something that we had to get from a
[18:56] prophet it was in a book form already
[18:59] all right because they killed
[19:03] people by not believing their Doctrine
[19:06] okay all right thereby with me so that
[19:09] was a time of of of
[19:14] Darkness that was never
[19:17] before it was called the Dark
[19:20] Ages so let's look right back just for a
[19:22] second in the th tyan church I Know Thy
[19:24] works and charity and service and faith
[19:26] and patience and thy Works he keeps
[19:28] talking about about works the last to be
[19:30] more than the first and I will kill her
[19:32] children with death now who's he talking
[19:34] about let's back up here a minute we've
[19:36] been studying this for a couple weeks
[19:38] who is that
[19:41] her that's any
[19:44] church idea contrary to the word of
[19:47] God and God's going to kill her by her
[19:51] own words by her own if she takes on a
[19:55] false Doctrine which is death he's going
[19:58] to let her die remember the Bible tells
[20:00] us that God's going to give a strong
[20:03] delusion to believe a lie and be damned
[20:06] by God knows that it doesn't matter now
[20:09] this is something that you got to
[20:11] realize when you talk about
[20:13] predestination and and for knowledge we
[20:15] know for a fact forn knowledge comes
[20:18] first and we know that everybody in this
[20:20] building and all over the world has a
[20:22] choice because we are a free moral agent
[20:25] everybody with me but by for knowledge
[20:27] God being so knowledgeable for knowledge
[20:30] before this ever began he knew that if
[20:33] he'd give Hitler if he'd give any of
[20:36] these people uh Constantine he gave them
[20:39] a million years to live he knew that
[20:41] they would never come to repentance so
[20:44] therefore he doesn't have to put them in
[20:45] a book he can put them in a different
[20:48] place and he can also let them kill
[20:52] theirself amen they took on a doctrine
[20:55] that killed them but the doctrine was
[20:57] death to begin with
[20:59] with that's why we got to get our
[21:01] Doctrine right that's why God had to
[21:02] send a prophet in the end
[21:05] time to get this thing straighten back
[21:08] out to get the right baptism to get the
[21:11] right way to receive the Holy Ghost to
[21:13] get the right way of of believing
[21:15] there's no eternal hell and all these
[21:17] different things that was contrary to
[21:19] the word of
[21:22] God and I will kill her children with
[21:24] death and all the churches see churches
[21:26] children listen her as a church
[21:29] everybody with me her I will kill her
[21:33] and her children we're going to read
[21:34] this in just a minute Book of
[21:36] Revelations but he's going to give you
[21:39] uh your reward according to your works
[21:41] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[21:43] works there's got to be a works that we
[21:45] look in the Bible and see that there's a
[21:46] works of God that we've got to do that
[21:48] he's already set the Precedence we got
[21:50] to do it right it's not guessing it's
[21:55] not
[21:56] maybe it's a fact it's written in the
[21:59] Bible and brother Richard said this is
[22:00] all we got to go on this is it right
[22:03] here if anything comes outside of this
[22:05] Bible it's wrong
[22:08] amen and it's what it's
[22:11] death so cuz what you think that you're
[22:14] reading if it's contrary to the word of
[22:18] God that wrote
[22:21] it it's
[22:23] death because many people will read a
[22:25] father son Holy Ghost baptism because
[22:27] they said that's what Jesus said well
[22:28] you got to look by Revelation he said in
[22:30] the name father's not a name son's not a
[22:33] name Holy Ghost is not a name there is a
[22:35] name behind that and it's connected to
[22:39] my new birth I don't know about yours
[22:40] but mine I'm connected to a family
[22:42] called Dale not by
[22:46] father my name's Wade not
[22:49] son cuz if you say son we got there sons
[22:52] all in this place but when you say
[22:55] brother way Dale who do you look at you
[22:57] look at me so when we say n we're going
[22:59] to baptize in the name of the father and
[23:01] of the Son and the Holy Ghost we're
[23:02] doing exactly what Jesus said we're we
[23:04] put a name to it because the Bible says
[23:07] every family in Heaven and Earth got one
[23:11] name Jesus Christ that's
[23:15] Bible so the ox AG is an age of works
[23:18] just to get right through that but let's
[23:20] look at this real quick I inserted this
[23:23] June asked me we're going to get
[23:24] actually going to get into sardian
[23:25] church age I said yes sweetheart we will
[23:28] and until I sat in there and pulled out
[23:29] about four more quotes and three more
[23:31] scriptures so we may
[23:34] not but we'll get to it
[23:38] sometime but the reason I want you to
[23:40] see this is the reason I'm backing up
[23:41] into this into this tharan church age
[23:44] look what Martin Luther came out of he
[23:46] came out of a soup of tar pitched devil
[23:52] darkness that rued for not 9 years not
[23:55] 20 years not 200 years it Ru for 900
[24:00] years and the Bible in Revelations calls
[24:03] her a great
[24:05] plain and that had harlots
[24:09] or
[24:12] daughters and God's going to throw them
[24:14] all to bed we'll read in just a minute
[24:16] but we look and see that it started in
[24:18] Ephesus with what man man worshiping a
[24:24] woman Diana all right a goddess
[24:29] the tharan age was a propheus didn't
[24:31] call her name but she sat on a three-leg
[24:33] stool and and she prophesied well she
[24:37] was
[24:38] false then the sardian church age we get
[24:41] to in just a minute her name was
[24:42] sael and it was Father's I mean it was
[24:46] son F son Mama son worship and now it's
[24:50] going to turn into just mother worship
[24:51] and I'm telling you it's real slick how
[24:54] they pulled off bringing that mother
[24:56] worship of Mary over Jesus I mean her
[25:01] resurrecting and
[25:03] ascending and the mother of
[25:06] God and they pray to her cuz she's nicer
[25:10] than Jesus
[25:11] is or more
[25:16] nice you think it's bad they believe
[25:18] that they put their life on
[25:21] that do we put our life on what we
[25:24] believe are we sufficiently impressed as
[25:27] I said before that this is the
[25:29] truth can you be shaken from this truth
[25:32] Right Here If You Can Be Shaken from
[25:34] this truth you got to get the Holy Ghost
[25:37] because the Holy Ghost will lead you and
[25:38] guide you into all truth not just going
[25:40] up and shaking a hand not just filling
[25:41] out a letter not filling out a form
[25:44] we're not getting a
[25:46] job we're getting eternal life amen and
[25:49] it will pull the old you out and put
[25:51] another person inside there called Jesus
[25:56] Christ the life that I now live says I
[25:59] live by the faith of Jesus
[26:01] Christ so our ra though is a great
[26:04] and her daughters so this is where I
[26:06] inserted I pulled it up just a few
[26:08] minutes ago Revelation 17 verse one now
[26:11] Watch What Happens here this is that
[26:13] dark age is develop everything has to
[26:16] develop from a baby form to a mature
[26:18] form even you in Christianity you start
[26:20] as a baby all right everybody with me
[26:23] you start as a baby you make mistakes
[26:25] you fall
[26:28] but you keep eating and you make
[26:30] yourself bigger or you get stronger and
[26:33] you get more um knowledgeable about how
[26:36] to handle things same way in
[26:39] Christianity if you look at your life
[26:41] you can tell how Christianity is don't
[26:43] look at your life at the center I mean
[26:45] look at your life as a human being that
[26:47] goes from a baby sucking a bottle to a
[26:50] person eating food and then knowing what
[26:53] food we like knowing F what food we can
[26:55] get and later in the Years knowing what
[26:57] food we can't eat
[26:59] cuz you ain't got no teeth so anyway and
[27:02] there came this is Revelation 17 now
[27:05] watch this is the now the development
[27:08] this is the this is the Apex but the
[27:10] development of it was right there in
[27:13] Columba and Luther's time all right is
[27:15] everybody with me they had to start
[27:16] somewhere and Satan started so slick it
[27:19] took him 900 years to develop just one
[27:24] thing and that was the merry worship and
[27:27] the Indulgence
[27:29] es and the
[27:31] novenas you know your your your your
[27:34] son's in purgatory he's burning right
[27:36] now if you'll pay a couple thousand
[27:38] dollars or whatever it was back then
[27:41] we'll get him
[27:42] out that's how they got rich that's why
[27:44] they have the filth Rich of the world
[27:46] they got all the
[27:47] gold listen Rome will rule this whole
[27:51] world for a short period of time but God
[27:53] says what he's going to do to
[27:55] her and there came out one of the seven
[27:58] Angels which had the seven bows and talk
[28:00] with me saying unto me come hither I
[28:03] will show thee unto thee the Judgment of
[28:06] the great that sth upon many
[28:08] Waters and we know Waters is what people
[28:10] we know Catholicism rules about what
[28:13] over half of the whole world is is
[28:15] Catholic all right so three and a half b
[28:19] no four billion now since it's 8 billion
[28:21] people four billion people believe what
[28:24] I'm telling you right here all right and
[28:26] they're sincere people don't get me
[28:28] wrong but you can be sincerely wrong you
[28:30] can get caught in the wrong thing with
[28:33] whom the kings of the Earth have
[28:34] committed fornication listen Biden don't
[28:37] rule nothing and if if watch his face
[28:40] gets in he ain't going to rule nothing
[28:42] Putin don't rule nothing the Catholic
[28:44] Church rules it all why we even get on
[28:46] the line and look say oh I think I think
[28:49] Trump the God's going to get us out of
[28:52] here no Trump's just a
[28:54] pawn Biden's just a pawn Biden may not
[28:57] know it
[28:58] but he's
[29:01] B he has a few gaps in his memory every
[29:04] once in a while but the pope is always
[29:06] going to be there the pope is going to
[29:07] be the one that's going to take this
[29:10] world and totally rule it when we're
[29:12] gone but he's starting it right
[29:15] now and he's been starting it for
[29:18] years with whom the kings of the Earth
[29:20] have committed
[29:22] fornication do you know back in the 60s
[29:25] brother Jimmy Harris has got a book and
[29:28] he studied up on a lot of that about the
[29:29] Jesuits and the black pope and all the
[29:31] things like that that we don't know
[29:32] about that we haven't studied and if you
[29:35] want to study this okay but the Catholic
[29:38] Church put a put a couple it's true
[29:42] story all over the country and put them
[29:44] in churches Baptist methodists different
[29:47] places to corrupt the
[29:50] church
[29:51] hello and they got found out about it
[29:54] later on but they would put a couple the
[29:55] man and a woman that wasn't even married
[29:57] put them in they come into a church like
[29:59] they were married they'd start with this
[30:01] all different idea and then they'll
[30:02] start getting involved and they really
[30:03] didn't get involved then they got
[30:05] involved with the men and the women tore
[30:07] the church up so they said well let's go
[30:10] over to this place and what was it it
[30:12] was Catholic so with whom the kings of
[30:14] the Earth have committed fornication now
[30:16] this is Kings of the Earth are
[30:18] committing fornication with whoever this
[30:20] person is whoever the great is and
[30:22] the inhabitants of the Earth have been
[30:24] made drunk
[30:29] try to tell somebody that's a Catholic
[30:30] that the Catholic church is
[30:33] wrong and the inhabitants of the Earth
[30:35] have been made drunk with the wine of
[30:37] her
[30:38] fornication so he carried me away in the
[30:40] spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a
[30:42] woman sitting Upon A Scarlet colored
[30:44] Beast full of names of blasphemy and
[30:47] having seven heads and 10
[30:50] horns and the woman was arrayed in
[30:56] purple and scar color and decked with
[30:59] gold precious stones and Pearls having a
[31:02] golden cup in her hand look not full of
[31:06] prayers there's another one that has
[31:09] prayers that are going up to the Saints
[31:11] because they're sainted people this is a
[31:14] cup of a hand in her hand full of
[31:17] Abominations and fil in it listen that's
[31:20] not that's not worldly
[31:23] people that's
[31:25] churchgoers hello I'm going to be
[31:27] playing tonight that's
[31:29] churchgoers everybody with
[31:32] me having a golden cup in her hand full
[31:35] of Abominations and filthiness of her
[31:37] fornication and upon her forehead was a
[31:40] name written mystery Babylon the great
[31:44] the mother of
[31:48] harlots so what is the mother mother is
[31:51] the the harlots are the kids
[31:53] daughters daughters are churches women
[31:56] all right so she's got the head Church
[31:59] which is Rome we know that and then she
[32:02] got there all the little bitty ones and
[32:03] I you know you can call it whatever you
[32:05] want it want to call it but they're all
[32:07] drinking it's all going to come under
[32:09] one rule you can be a Baptist Methodist
[32:11] Pentecostal what brand m whatever you
[32:12] want to be but there's going to come a
[32:14] time when we leave this
[32:16] Earth when the Holy Ghost Le this Earth
[32:19] with the bride that she's going to rule
[32:21] the world and guess what she's going to
[32:23] tell the Baptist what to preach she's
[32:25] going to tell the Pentecostals what to
[32:26] preach
[32:29] and I saw the woman drunken with the
[32:31] blood of the Saints and with the blood
[32:33] of the martyrs of Jesus now here's your
[32:36] situation where we're looking in this
[32:37] staran church
[32:39] age they killed 68 million
[32:43] Christians who the great and the
[32:46] harlots and with the blood of the
[32:47] martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her look
[32:50] now watch John John hear John's writing
[32:53] what he saw everybody with me John's
[32:55] writing what he saw he sees this
[32:59] scene and he wondered with great
[33:01] admiration brother R said he looked at
[33:04] it and wondered at it like this thing's
[33:06] so
[33:08] nice the angel had to smack him upside
[33:10] the head and said hey John why do you
[33:12] Marvel at this this is dead this is
[33:16] Devils this is lies this is the blood of
[33:19] your
[33:21] people and the angel said unto me
[33:25] wherefore Dost thou Marvel why you look
[33:27] even look at this I will tell theee the
[33:30] mystery of the woman and of the Beast
[33:31] that carrieth her which ha the seven
[33:33] heads and 10 horns now we don't get into
[33:35] all that but we'll cover this right here
[33:37] the Beast that thou sawest was and is
[33:39] not now what does that mean one Pope
[33:42] dies another Pope comes into Power one
[33:44] Pope dies another Pope comes into power
[33:48] they back with me now brother Brown
[33:49] taught this forever now it's exactly
[33:51] what it is the Beast that sawest that
[33:53] thou sawest was and is not and shall sin
[33:56] out of the bottomless pit and go to
[33:58] predition and they that dwell on the
[34:00] Earth shall wonder whose names were not
[34:02] written in the Book of Life from the
[34:04] foundation of the world all right when
[34:07] they behold the Beast that was and is
[34:09] not and yet is in other words one Pop
[34:11] die one Pope dies another one takes over
[34:13] listen they literally think that God
[34:14] just dropped himself right into that
[34:17] poke
[34:19] right when they put all that stuff on
[34:22] him and walk him out there they said
[34:23] that's
[34:24] God ain't that right and sister an was
[34:28] here she tell you exactly what it was
[34:30] he's
[34:31] God he's a
[34:34] viker bious filad that's the name on
[34:38] that triple crown which adds up in Roman
[34:42] in the N um old Roman numbers
[34:46] 666 exactly I even saw it on Facebook
[34:50] today that somebody posted it not from
[34:51] the message but from somewhere else that
[34:53] that vicarious Philly idea if you move
[34:55] over to the AES and the and Adam all up
[34:58] it adds number
[35:01] 666 wow 1 Timothy 5:6 but she that
[35:05] liveth in pleaser is dead while she
[35:07] liveth all through that church age they
[35:09] thought they were alive they thought
[35:11] they were doing something for God they
[35:12] thought they was you know cleansing the
[35:14] world doesn't that sound familiar ain't
[35:16] that what Hitler did he thought he was
[35:18] cleansing the world it was that same
[35:21] devil they just the devil the listen if
[35:23] people die devil
[35:24] don't devil just moves over into another
[35:27] being that will what yield itself to him
[35:29] like Hitler did in different
[35:31] ones so in the th Church age brother R
[35:33] said look what will the punishment of
[35:36] the Harlot and her
[35:37] children well it's going to be twofold
[35:40] first he said I'll cast her into a bed
[35:42] according to the verse 22 it will be a
[35:44] bed of tribulation or the Great
[35:46] Tribulation and I've said many times and
[35:48] I tell you if you're born again tonight
[35:51] if you're born again tonight you don't
[35:53] have to go through any kind of
[35:55] tribulation why in the world would would
[35:57] God put his own wife through tribulation
[35:59] that is another false
[36:01] Doctrine hello somebody I'm just happy
[36:06] that Revelation come to me I don't have
[36:08] to go through that I listen brother John
[36:12] it makes me ill reading it what people's
[36:15] got to go through the Bible says the
[36:17] birds will eat you while you're still
[36:18] alive your skin will fall off what
[36:21] nuclear your skin will fall off of your
[36:23] bones while you're still alive what a
[36:25] horrible thing listen get into Christ if
[36:29] you get into Christ he'll take us out of
[36:31] here before that happened he'll never
[36:33] put his wife through that would you put
[36:35] your wife through a tribulation no these
[36:38] little minor things we're going through
[36:39] now is nothing compared to when we get
[36:42] out of here amen amen cuz Rome's going
[36:44] to rule the world she's going to do
[36:46] exactly what she did to try to kill
[36:48] those 68 million she's going to try to
[36:50] kill the people that want to stay the
[36:52] foolish virgin the on that wants to stay
[36:55] try to be stay in white and try to be
[36:57] good and try to not be a part of that
[36:59] system she's going to kill them
[37:01] all secondly it says it will kill them
[37:04] with death or as literal translation
[37:05] said let them be put to death with death
[37:08] they open their
[37:12] services with the same Bible we
[37:19] do I mean there's written in Latin and
[37:21] you can't understand it but it's still
[37:24] the same Bible this is where we get the
[37:26] Latin Vulgate is where we get the Bible
[37:28] from the Catholic Church preserved it
[37:30] enough so they could write the book The
[37:32] Bible Martin Luther and different ones
[37:34] tale and all them to put the book
[37:36] together well they had it the Catholic
[37:38] Church preserved it praise God for
[37:41] that let them be put to death this is a
[37:44] strange thing by hanging and
[37:46] electrocution
[37:48] and I hope you caught some of that what
[37:50] Brother Richard was talking about when
[37:52] we come to and start looking at the
[37:54] thing called a third pull which some a
[37:56] lot of you may not be familiar with that
[37:58] brother Ram had the three visions and
[38:00] and what basically what the third pull
[38:02] is is that we are coming to a place to
[38:05] where death is destroyed to where we are
[38:08] not under false
[38:10] Doctrine death can't touch
[38:13] us but see if you take on a false
[38:16] Doctrine death has already not touched
[38:17] you it's already got you amen it's
[38:20] already got
[38:21] you don't fall into that let's don't be
[38:25] put to death by death let us what eat of
[38:27] the Tree of
[38:30] Life y'all see an 85 year old man 86
[38:34] year old man get
[38:36] happy Brother Richard got happy this
[38:39] weekend at 86 years
[38:41] old why because we've been what we have
[38:45] been changed from Death to life we have
[38:47] been brought out of Darkness we all were
[38:50] had the different ideas we all had these
[38:52] denominational
[38:55] ideas till we started reading the Bible
[38:57] like it was supposed to be read and not
[38:59] by a Catholic or by a priest or a pope
[39:01] or whatever you want to call it Bishop
[39:03] Elder so spiritual death came in you can
[39:05] be just as alive and just as happy and
[39:08] just praise God and be as dead as a
[39:10] doornail if you take on a false
[39:13] Doctrine all right death became a
[39:17] resident where shortly before only life
[39:19] reigned as the original Eve brought
[39:22] death to mankind so now organization has
[39:25] brought death for organization has
[39:27] brought death it's the product of a
[39:29] double corruptor nanism bism propagated
[39:33] by what Always by a woman what was
[39:36] Samson's downfall
[39:38] Delila Always by a woman so it's always
[39:41] going to be by a church so the word
[39:44] death means that separation natural or
[39:46] violent of the soul and Body by which
[39:48] the life on Earth is ended now we know
[39:50] that one is that one is is pretty
[39:53] obvious we go to a funeral we see him
[39:55] put the body in the ground the soul goes
[39:58] somewhere and we don't see them
[40:01] anymore but what about a group of people
[40:03] that's walking around dead as that or
[40:06] worse and going to work every
[40:09] day playing the stock market doing all
[40:11] the different thing you know doing the
[40:13] worldly things and they're just as
[40:15] dead while they're
[40:18] living so now let's look this is
[40:20] something else I want to bring out for
[40:22] just a minute we were talking about the
[40:24] first two the seals now let me explain
[40:26] something real quick quick about the
[40:28] seals if we go to Revelation 6 there is
[40:32] a there is a scene in heaven that there
[40:35] is a seven sealed book a rolled scroll
[40:38] not a book like this all right we'll get
[40:41] into it later on but something rolled up
[40:43] like
[40:44] this and it's
[40:46] got all right a seal on
[40:49] it so that's what John saw all right so
[40:53] John saw the lamb take a book in
[40:56] Revelations 5 all right then in
[40:58] Revelation 6 he said he said let's we'll
[41:01] read it in just a minute we're right
[41:02] here Revelation 6 verse
[41:04] one and I saw when the lamb opened one
[41:07] of the seals so so can you see what's
[41:10] inside of that now there's something
[41:12] written some of my notes but if it's
[41:15] sealed with that you can't read it but
[41:18] it's in there and it's good for
[41:21] you amen but so it takes something to
[41:25] open the seal
[41:28] to show these great little quotes that I
[41:30] got but it was always in there brother
[41:32] Gary it was always there but it was
[41:34] sealed up what because Daniel 12 said
[41:37] seal it up Daniel until when the time of
[41:41] the end which is right now because this
[41:44] is what me and you need to get out of
[41:47] her my
[41:49] people right so what is the opening of a
[41:52] seal it's the loosing of a
[41:55] Ministry it's something never before
[41:58] been seen or been looked at by man but
[42:00] it's always been in
[42:01] there when the Seal's open it's the
[42:05] Bible when the seal was open it wasn't
[42:07] something mysterious and God had to
[42:08] write another book it came out of this
[42:11] book right here but what did it do John
[42:14] had to eat that book so he ate the seals
[42:17] and then what happened brother Bob he
[42:20] prophesied he opened a Ministry there
[42:23] was a Ministry that was loosed well
[42:25] listen when the lamb opened of the seals
[42:27] and I heard it word the noise of Thunder
[42:29] one of the four L Beast the lion he
[42:31] opened the
[42:33] ministry Paul ireneus Martin he opened
[42:36] the ministry and then what happened here
[42:39] comes the devil behind it with his
[42:43] ministry cuz if it Loos the good one
[42:46] Satan's going to loose a bad
[42:48] one cuz remember he's a copycat he's not
[42:51] an originator he can't originate
[42:53] anything whatever he does he perverts
[42:55] what God's already made amen
[42:59] and I saw and behold a white horse now
[43:00] look the lion said come and see he
[43:02] opened the seal opened the lamb opened
[43:04] the SE and said hey this is what it says
[43:07] inside that's why I love you know you
[43:09] you take Brother Richard said many many
[43:11] times and we'll cover that brother R
[43:13] said here tonight stands a lamb with a
[43:15] book in his hand Christ had come to
[43:18] Earth you can say what you want to
[43:20] brother Ram's not God not even close to
[43:22] God but he's closer to God than anything
[43:24] else you'll ever see and God used used
[43:27] him to pull that seal open and say right
[43:30] here is where you going to get it from
[43:33] right here is a ministry that's going to
[43:34] be loosed that people for 60 years now
[43:37] we preach the same
[43:39] message well most
[43:42] have and I saw and behold a white horse
[43:45] oh beautiful he that sat on him was
[43:48] somebody sitting on it had a
[43:50] bow but he didn't have any
[43:54] arrows and a crown was given unto him
[43:59] and he went forth conquering and to
[44:02] conquer that's what we just read in
[44:04] Revelations we see that that it didn't
[44:06] become a Roman Catholic Church until we
[44:08] talked about it when church and state
[44:10] under Constantine come together he put
[44:12] Rome he put papal Rome which was a
[44:15] floundering religion that didn't have
[44:17] many didn't have many synagogues at
[44:21] all Constantine said hey I kind of like
[44:24] them people I'm going to give them power
[44:27] I'm going to take church and state and
[44:29] put them
[44:30] together give them land give them
[44:34] power give them
[44:36] wealth and a way to gain wealth and then
[44:40] we all going to get
[44:41] wealthy all
[44:44] right but he had a bow and no arrows so
[44:47] he's a bluff he bluffed himself through
[44:49] those first three ages he bluffed his
[44:52] way into the true white righteous Church
[44:55] in other words the doctrine that when
[44:58] that seal opened the doctrine of Paul
[44:59] arenius and Martin it was pure Paul
[45:02] wrote 80% of the New Testament that's
[45:05] the pure word of God that's what we go
[45:06] by I can't understand why people say oh
[45:09] you just got this man this Prophet that
[45:11] you quote him all the time we quote Paul
[45:13] all the
[45:14] time we quote Peter all the time y'all
[45:18] like to quote we not y'all but people
[45:20] quote Billy Graham all the time he's
[45:22] dead and
[45:24] gone I like to quote a messenger that's
[45:28] Vindicated by the word of God what he
[45:31] was who he was and who he was to you can
[45:35] say Amen or sit there if you want to it
[45:38] excites my soul that we had somebody
[45:40] come and tell us the
[45:45] truth but Satan bluffed his way and got
[45:48] himself into those
[45:50] people Bluff them right out of the true
[45:53] word of
[45:54] God and give them formalities
[45:57] give them took down Jupiter and put up
[45:59] Peter took down uh Zeus or whatever and
[46:02] put up Paul it's just paganism from one
[46:05] place to the other it's just now
[46:08] under Catholicism or the Catholic
[46:12] church till the first three ages they
[46:15] did have a concrete Ministry there was a
[46:17] Ministry loosened by Paul irenius and
[46:19] Martin it was true there wasn't any
[46:21] there wasn't any error in what they
[46:23] preached now there was error
[46:25] coming y baby form there was Era coming
[46:28] baby
[46:29] form but in that fourth Church age is
[46:32] when church and state came together that
[46:34] middle age Tara came together and power
[46:38] was
[46:40] given but what was that
[46:43] power God loosed another
[46:46] ministry
[46:48] under
[46:51] Columba they called the church to
[46:53] repentance they called the church to do
[46:55] things right they called the church to
[46:57] do things according to the Bible the
[46:59] Bible was just just getting ready to get
[47:01] put together so when he had opened the
[47:04] second seal who the lamb listen who is
[47:06] the Lamb the Lamb's that man standing
[47:09] there with seven stars and seven candles
[47:12] and standing in the midst of the
[47:13] candlesticks he got the Stars that's the
[47:15] son of man that's
[47:18] Christ Christ the lamb the Holy Ghost
[47:20] same person not
[47:23] three and when he had opened the second
[47:26] seal I heard the second beast what I
[47:29] heard the second beast so somewhere
[47:31] there was a power in that second beast
[47:34] or the ox to say come and see God
[47:37] released a
[47:39] Ministry of works we just read
[47:43] that he loose the ministry but what well
[47:46] what did Satan do he said well thing
[47:48] work so can I I'm going to work on
[47:50] Constantine I'm going work on Austine of
[47:52] Hippo I'm going to work on these great
[47:55] people see Satan always tries to work on
[47:58] the great glamorous
[48:00] people I want to take the people that
[48:02] that I want to meet the people that was
[48:04] under Columba that he preached and died
[48:06] and they still picked his message up and
[48:08] they still took it through the age and
[48:10] they still took it to the Gallows they
[48:12] still took it to the to the arena and
[48:15] died for what they believed
[48:17] in that's who I want to meet amen we're
[48:20] not going to meet them other guys except
[48:23] judging them at the day of
[48:25] judgment Constantine was not a Christian
[48:28] sorry about
[48:31] that and His holy war was pretty
[48:35] Unholy and then went out another horse
[48:37] that was red what power was given now to
[48:41] bring a message of works and Grace and
[48:45] slow development Ox
[48:48] AG but there was also a red horse and
[48:51] power was given him to take peace from
[48:53] the
[48:54] earth Constantine says put everything
[48:57] together in have
[48:59] peace hello he tried to put every well
[49:03] he did he put everything together well
[49:04] it's going to be peaceful now we ain't
[49:06] going to have all this shouting acts 238
[49:09] group of people hello somebody we ain't
[49:12] going to have none of that
[49:17] noise but what he done was he took peace
[49:19] from the earth and turned it into a war
[49:22] that lasts 900 years between Christians
[49:27] and
[49:29] Catholicism don't you believe that horse
[49:31] is not
[49:33] red it was red with the blood of
[49:36] Martyrs during that church age and that
[49:39] they should kill one another what I'm a
[49:41] Christian I'm a Christian who you going
[49:43] to
[49:43] believe well you're going to believe you
[49:45] know what if you were standing watching
[49:47] you'd believe the ones that had the
[49:48] power cuz we'd be deceived if we didn't
[49:50] have the Holy Ghost but if you had the
[49:52] Holy Ghost You' say put me in the arena
[49:55] with them that's the ones I want to be
[49:57] associated with like today we're Outcast
[50:01] we're
[50:03] different praise
[50:05] God God's a
[50:08] separator look and there was given unto
[50:10] him listen in the first three Church
[50:12] ages Satan was given a bow with no
[50:15] arrows he had no power to shoot with he
[50:17] could just
[50:19] deceive but in the in the third and
[50:22] going toward the fourth Church age he
[50:24] was given a sword which is what it's a
[50:26] word
[50:27] he was given a word to live by then and
[50:30] to make others live by but it was read
[50:33] and it was
[50:34] wrong but God had a word in Columba that
[50:38] fit into those people's lives that gave
[50:40] their life for what they believed
[50:44] in brother B said look now let's go to
[50:48] the second seal when the when the Risen
[50:49] lamb opened it and the second calf like
[50:52] Beast said come see what the seal
[50:55] mystery in other words see what this
[50:57] ministry is all about now we get it the
[51:00] lamb you remember has to open every seal
[51:03] and the second beast if you notice in
[51:05] the routine of where we just went
[51:07] through with the church ages he's
[51:08] referring back to the church ages the
[51:10] first was a lion all right everybody
[51:13] with me the first three Ages was the
[51:15] lion l i o n that was the that was the
[51:19] the call of the age that went out and
[51:20] then Satan sent his man right after him
[51:22] a white righteous Church all
[51:24] right he won't look different Saint
[51:27] don't want to look
[51:30] different but God
[51:33] does God wants you to look
[51:35] different that's why we're
[51:38] different you see and this Beast said
[51:41] come see not coming and wonder come and
[51:43] look at what's fixing to happen now and
[51:46] when the lamb opened the seal and then
[51:48] went to seea and when he walked in what
[51:51] happened let's see what he found come
[51:52] see there's a mystery sealed up remember
[51:54] the mystery was sealed up that's been
[51:56] now for 2,000 years let's see what it is
[52:00] now we find here he saw what a red horse
[52:02] go forward in the th tyan Church age why
[52:04] because there's killing 68
[52:06] million the population of California and
[52:09] Texas the two largest states one of the
[52:11] two because of Alaska Alaska don't have
[52:13] nobody in it but if you took California
[52:15] and you took Texas took everybody in it
[52:17] and killed every one of them that's how
[52:18] many of the Catholic Church killed
[52:20] during those 900 years now notice that
[52:23] sure shows they should kill one another
[52:26] they should kill kill each other his bow
[52:27] had no arrows at first you can't kill
[52:29] somebody now you might Whack Him over
[52:31] the head with a bow but if you arrows
[52:33] you can kill somebody with it all right
[52:35] but his great sword did he done his
[52:38] killing later changed from a white horse
[52:41] to a red horse the same exact Devil with
[52:45] his sword what Jesus say Jesus said they
[52:48] that take the sword will perish by it
[52:49] don't fight back it Jesus that night
[52:51] told Peter said put your sword up
[52:54] man now now remember he's got a sword
[52:57] he's going forth a sword in his hand
[53:00] riding a red horse waiting through the
[53:02] blood of everybody that disagrees with
[53:08] him now the difference in that and me
[53:11] and you if you got the Holy Ghost
[53:14] tonight you say father forgive them for
[53:17] they don't know what they're doing
[53:19] father they're blind they've not been
[53:21] the seals have not been open to them the
[53:24] lamb has not been shown to them like the
[53:25] Lamb's been shown to me and
[53:28] you that's a true
[53:30] Christian instead of Revenge Revenge
[53:33] that's all they wanted
[53:35] Revenge now do you understand it how
[53:37] many understood what that seal is now
[53:39] we'll get to them later we'll just
[53:41] skimming over it now they that take the
[53:43] sword will perish by it now watch this
[53:45] riter and all this Kingdom subjects that
[53:47] are slain down through the age that's
[53:48] drawn all this Blood of the martyrs of
[53:50] the Saints will be slain By The Sword of
[53:52] Jesus Christ when he comes that's what
[53:54] we're talking about here in Revelations
[53:55] they that took the sword to be slain by
[53:57] it they took the sword of dogma and
[54:00] Antichrist and cut down the real true
[54:03] worshippers all down Through the Ages by
[54:05] the millions and when Christ comes with
[54:08] his sword for it is his word that
[54:10] proceeded out of his mouth he will slay
[54:12] every enemy that is before him you
[54:14] believe that he's going to K let them
[54:16] kill theirself with death but he's the
[54:18] Bible tells us don't be afraid of the
[54:20] first death you better be afraid of the
[54:21] second death you better be afraid of
[54:23] what's coming on you if you don't get
[54:25] the Holy Ghost if you get the Holy Ghost
[54:27] you going to die
[54:31] again it won't be an eternal
[54:34] death hell's not Eternal if hell's
[54:36] Eternal God's got to be there ain't but
[54:38] one there ain't but one Eternal and
[54:39] that's God Satan ain't Eternal and hell
[54:42] was created so it's got to be done away
[54:45] with what did Jesus say he that takes
[54:48] the sword all right look you you might
[54:50] have killed 68 million of them down
[54:52] through these ages maybe more but Jesus
[54:54] said he that taketh the sword will
[54:56] perish by it brother R said one time
[54:58] before he said 68 million they killed
[55:00] with a sword no telling how many other
[55:02] Millions by their
[55:04] Doctrine cuz the doctrine will kill
[55:07] you as the Impostors against the word of
[55:10] God and because they wouldn't agree and
[55:13] this thing Satan placed look Satan
[55:15] placed United political and spiritual
[55:18] power which he held together and made a
[55:21] church that sweeps into every nation he
[55:24] put Millions times Millions after he
[55:26] jumped off his White Horse got on his
[55:28] red horse he took his sword and went
[55:30] forth but God said with the same thing
[55:32] he perverted or tried the false teaching
[55:35] that same word will rise in
[55:38] power coming forth from the lips of
[55:41] Jesus Christ and it shall slay him and
[55:42] everything before it that's the second
[55:44] seal do you love him oh my that's thus
[55:46] sayith the Lord let's continue just a
[55:49] minute oh what was he given then first
[55:51] he had a bow he didn't have any arrows
[55:54] but now he's got a mighty sword in his
[55:55] hand he can do something now he jumps
[55:58] off his White Horse the white horse
[55:59] rides on out and he straddles a red
[56:02] horse blood blood red he really rides
[56:04] that one see he's giving great power and
[56:06] a sword to kill then he rides his blood
[56:09] red horse we see from the second seal
[56:12] that was broke last night he took peace
[56:14] from the earth and did kill one another
[56:17] and his own martyrology of the Roman
[56:19] Catholic church if you read Fox's book
[56:21] of
[56:22] Martyrs I think Daddy's got a copy in
[56:24] there if not he's got one at home and
[56:25] you can get them anywhere you want to
[56:27] they agree that they killed 68 million
[56:30] people 68 million Protestants to death
[56:33] from a time of St hippo of Augustine of
[56:35] Hippo until
[56:37] 1580 68 million Smucker's great reform
[56:40] if you want to read it glorious
[56:41] Reformation are Fox's book of Martyrs
[56:44] too 68 million recorded on a mar
[56:47] martyrology when one of their so-called
[56:50] Saints got the Revelation that anybody
[56:51] disagree with the Roman Catholic Church
[56:53] would die heretic
[56:57] they just sent him around them boy went
[56:59] to spilling blood he jumped on his White
[57:01] Horse and his red horse went riding now
[57:03] his great power now watch he was made
[57:05] viker of heaven and worshiped as
[57:08] God ruler of the Earth by uniting the
[57:11] church and state Together made him ruler
[57:14] on Earth give him a crown over that he
[57:17] could pray the souls out of
[57:20] purgatory he could also uh I think
[57:23] that's brother B was going to say
[57:25] intercede he was just like God on Earth
[57:27] instead of God together he had great
[57:30] power now let me back up just a minute
[57:33] if you were listening to what Brother
[57:34] Richard said if you are if you are a
[57:36] child of God if you're a son and
[57:37] daughter of God if you come to The
[57:39] Headstone you're
[57:41] God but you've come to the right God
[57:44] you've come through the right channels
[57:46] God said you are Gods I want you to be
[57:49] that way but I want you to be that way
[57:50] because of me I don't want you to be
[57:52] that way because of the devil and the
[57:54] devil's saying Hey I want to be
[57:55] incarnate too I want to be able to do
[57:57] the
[57:57] thing well he will be he'll be incarnate
[58:01] in a pope when we leave out of here
[58:03] Satan is going to enter that Pope and
[58:04] he's going to start killing
[58:09] again do not get caught in the
[58:13] tribulation
[58:15] right and I'm sorry but I think we're
[58:18] even us that are of older age if we
[58:21] don't get out of here in a Rapture
[58:22] you're going to go through
[58:24] it me and brother Harris was talking the
[58:26] other day talking about sister
[58:28] Christa trying to do right trying to do
[58:30] things right trying to do things right I
[58:32] said brother Jimmy I said God told me
[58:34] showed me a long time ago why a lot of
[58:36] people are dying before their
[58:39] time cuz see sister Christa if she
[58:42] didn't become a become bride she's not
[58:45] going to have to go through the
[58:46] tribulation
[58:47] period And I believe like brother Jimmy
[58:49] God said he give you the desire of your
[58:51] heart and if you desire your kids you
[58:54] hang on
[58:56] you hang on
[58:58] Amen you sure what that look
[59:04] circumstances but she I believe she gave
[59:06] her heart to the Lord she was trying to
[59:07] do better there was certain things that
[59:09] he was telling me testifying that she
[59:11] was trying to get better and and uh if
[59:13] she wasn't bride she'd be giv eternal
[59:16] life she for being good to the bride or
[59:18] or whatever that's not my choice but at
[59:21] least God sealed her a way where she
[59:24] does not have to go through tribulation
[59:26] how many of you Associates I've had
[59:29] several that just drop over dead but
[59:31] they're the best people they helped you
[59:34] cuz I remember scripture brother he was
[59:36] adamant he said read that scripture what
[59:39] Jesus said a cup of water in my name
[59:40] will not be forgotten here or forget
[59:43] forgotten over there all
[59:46] right let's don't try to live like the
[59:48] devil though and give a cup of water to
[59:49] Brother John dared I don't think that's
[59:50] going to happen bride all right that's
[59:56] Premed that's that's
[59:58] iniquity but there's going to be people
[1:00:00] like I said before there's going to be
[1:00:01] people that change your tire open the
[1:00:03] door for you let you you know done

[1:03:54] come out of that get up stop
[1:03:58] that it ain't got to be a church
[1:04:00] building with doors and
[1:04:02] Steeples the things we do wrong that's
[1:04:05] what God Said come out of
[1:04:09] that all right now we're on the sardan
[1:04:11] church age it's all right just for a few
[1:04:13] minutes I did you and I got
[1:04:18] it glad you're on a cane now you can't
[1:04:20] get up here and hit me with that big old
[1:04:21] thing you used to have and to the angel
[1:04:23] of the church in Sardis right these
[1:04:25] things sayith he that hath the seven
[1:04:27] spirits of God now all
[1:04:30] seriousness that was a horrible age we
[1:04:32] just talked
[1:04:34] about the the all the doctrines that
[1:04:36] that are killing people now that all
[1:04:38] developed and it didn't just developed
[1:04:40] it came to a head and started
[1:04:44] speaking it was a deed don't you think
[1:04:46] Jesus wasn't God I I don't know if that
[1:04:48] man was God I saw him
[1:04:50] cry I I don't he he went to the bathroom
[1:04:54] that can't be God well that little
[1:04:56] saying started then you come over all
[1:04:58] the way to the Catholic church and says
[1:04:59] no he's like God he's a he's another
[1:05:04] person you ought to see in that book
[1:05:07] some of those images that the Catholic
[1:05:08] Church come up with they're hideous it's
[1:05:11] a three-headed
[1:05:13] man a father a son and a holy ghost
[1:05:17] three-headed figure three different
[1:05:19] persons in the
[1:05:22] godhead that came from Zeus and Thor
[1:05:26] it didn't come from God behold oh Israel
[1:05:30] the Lord thy God is
[1:05:33] one Why Can't We Believe see that's so
[1:05:37] simple that's so
[1:05:39] simple Jesus said if you've seen me
[1:05:41] you've seen the
[1:05:43] father sure he was in another form he
[1:05:45] had on flesh but that was God inside of
[1:05:47] him the father was in
[1:05:53] him and when you look in Revelation
[1:05:57] you see one sitting on a throne not
[1:05:59] three you don't see three personalities
[1:06:02] sitting on a throne you see
[1:06:04] one God is
[1:06:06] one now God like Brother Richard said it
[1:06:09] was really great he said now he's not
[1:06:11] one like your finger like he just stands
[1:06:13] still no he has many manifestations like
[1:06:16] I am a father a son I'm a spirit I'm a
[1:06:19] postal worker I'm a this I'm a that the
[1:06:21] other but I'm just one guy but if I was
[1:06:23] God and I was omnip ENT I'm I'm the
[1:06:26] present knew everything knew where to be
[1:06:30] I could be there and still be standing
[1:06:31] here talking to
[1:06:33] you
[1:06:36] hello hello CU if the Holy Ghost is
[1:06:39] talking to you tonight and if he's over
[1:06:42] there in Ron Spencer's church and he's
[1:06:43] talking it's the same Holy
[1:06:46] Ghost but God can do
[1:06:50] that and we can't stop it you can try to
[1:06:54] stop it all you want to
[1:06:57] you will not stop the sovereignty of
[1:07:01] God that's why like brother Ernie says
[1:07:03] we need to attach oursel to something
[1:07:06] Eternal
[1:07:08] Eternal and I believe we have we've
[1:07:10] attached oursel to the Eternal God and
[1:07:13] before the foundation of the world sure
[1:07:17] sure we were in the mind of God the
[1:07:19] Eternal section but we had to come here
[1:07:21] to be lost to have him to develop him
[1:07:24] into a what a savior A Healer a
[1:07:29] redeemer I Know Thy works that thou has
[1:07:31] a name that you liveth now this is
[1:07:32] sardian church age and are dead be
[1:07:34] careful Be watchful strengthen the
[1:07:37] things which remain that are ready to
[1:07:38] die for I have not
[1:07:40] found thy works perfect before God he
[1:07:42] didn't say I was doing away with you he
[1:07:44] said I just don't there's not some
[1:07:45] things you're doing I don't
[1:07:47] like but I'm going to read to you in a
[1:07:49] quote just a few minutes where brother R
[1:07:50] said God was pleased to be in that
[1:07:52] age pleased now if God's pleased he
[1:07:55] can't change his mind all right he was
[1:07:57] pleased to be in that church age all
[1:08:00] that they went through we read it a
[1:08:02] minute ago so the combat Beast the
[1:08:04] living creature was what it was a man it
[1:08:06] was from 1520 to 1750 and I read to you
[1:08:09] pocket watch water wheel knitting
[1:08:11] machine
[1:08:12] microscope U small poxs vaccine the
[1:08:15] cotton gin gas lights bifocal glasses
[1:08:18] parachutes lightning rods you know who
[1:08:20] did that everybody know who who created
[1:08:22] a lightning rod don't you
[1:08:27] brother Ryan who created light
[1:08:30] Rod
[1:08:32] who he's on your $50
[1:08:36] bill Benjamin
[1:08:38] Franklin remember he was flying his kite
[1:08:41] y'all don't remember history he was
[1:08:43] flying his kite and had a had a key on
[1:08:46] it and when the thing hit it it well he
[1:08:48] C no really he created lightning rods
[1:08:50] from that he started putting them on
[1:08:51] people's houses and the house didn't get
[1:08:53] burned down because he knew that thing
[1:08:55] if it struck it it would go in the
[1:08:57] ground it actually went into him the
[1:08:59] first time read about
[1:09:02] that okay so let's go somewhere
[1:09:05] else in the 1700s a piano steam engine
[1:09:10] dictionary
[1:09:12] steamship
[1:09:15] bicycles you see the
[1:09:17] difference even Martin
[1:09:19] Luther he rode a horse John Wesley rode
[1:09:22] a horse but they were coming into play
[1:09:25] here with bicycles this was in the 1700s
[1:09:28] gas lights the cotton genen the cotton
[1:09:29] genen Revol revolutionized almost the
[1:09:32] whole world cu the cotton Jin you had to
[1:09:35] sit there and put pick those seeds out
[1:09:36] of the cotton you had to have hundreds
[1:09:38] of people picking just a little at a
[1:09:39] time that cotton Jin who who who
[1:09:42] invented
[1:09:43] it
[1:09:46] yes and that in that right Ireland Eli
[1:09:50] Whitney
[1:09:53] okay but but look I'm saying is God
[1:09:56] moved from what the Dark
[1:09:59] Ages into an age of now things were
[1:10:02] becoming more because look the cotton
[1:10:05] genin is now what you see up there at um
[1:10:09] at New Holland It's a cotton mill
[1:10:12] they're doing Millions an hour where
[1:10:14] they were doing Millions a year with
[1:10:16] that cotton genin cuz it was just one
[1:10:18] but that all developed what are you
[1:10:19] saying the word began to be
[1:10:22] developed under Martin Luther the just
[1:10:25] shall live by faith Wesley
[1:10:29] sanctification live a good holy life te
[1:10:32] doesn't have any uh tea doesn't have you
[1:10:35] know he because he was an English he was
[1:10:37] an Englishman and they drank tea
[1:10:39] remember they had their tea time they
[1:10:40] drank their tea spot of tea he said it
[1:10:43] don't have any value to it why are you
[1:10:45] stopping and drinking tea for go to
[1:10:48] work the man preached 4,000 sermons in
[1:10:51] one
[1:10:52] year 15,000 I think I read to in his
[1:10:55] whole
[1:10:58] lifetime what a guy so the church age
[1:11:01] now is the sardian church age we're
[1:11:03] going to see right here what
[1:11:05] Sardis Sardis means the escaped ones
[1:11:09] they couldn't escape in the th tyan age
[1:11:12] but they were beginning to escape they
[1:11:14] were beginning to come out of her my
[1:11:15] people with a man called Martin
[1:11:18] Luther which was in that Catholic Church
[1:11:22] part of the Catholic
[1:11:23] church and he was was reading the
[1:11:27] Bible as it was being put together he's
[1:11:30] reading the Bible and he said oh it says
[1:11:33] the judge shall live by faith and guess
[1:11:35] what happened a Ministry was
[1:11:38] loosed there was a Ministry a man
[1:11:40] Ministry the third the third Beast which
[1:11:44] was a man said come see and that seal
[1:11:48] was open t loose the just shall live by
[1:11:50] faith we'll get into that later on the
[1:11:53] religion of that time was siel and her
[1:11:55] son which is Theo all right that was at
[1:11:58] first then during the rest of the church
[1:12:01] ages watch what brother Ram said of that
[1:12:03] age he was a son God she was a moon God
[1:12:06] he was the Lord of Heaven she was the
[1:12:07] Queen of Heaven he was a revealer of
[1:12:10] goodness and Truth she was the
[1:12:11] gentleness and mercy he's the mediator
[1:12:14] she's a mediatrix he with the key that
[1:12:16] opens and shuts the gates of invis
[1:12:18] invisible world and she with an
[1:12:19] identical key doing likewise now look
[1:12:21] this is not the
[1:12:22] church all right this is this is uh
[1:12:26] um what would you say witchcraft or
[1:12:28] whatever they use or all that he was the
[1:12:30] judge she was standing at his side he
[1:12:33] being killed raised and ascended into
[1:12:35] heaven she carried there bodily by the
[1:12:37] son watch how that develops now in Rome
[1:12:41] this same God is given the title of Our
[1:12:44] Lord he's called the Son of God while
[1:12:46] she is called the mother of God now that
[1:12:49] is what we find back there in the other
[1:12:51] two ages where the mother and son
[1:12:53] concept took on such TR tremendous
[1:12:55] proportion but now notice that even as
[1:12:58] it was back in Babylon that the worship
[1:13:00] of the son began to lose out in favor of
[1:13:03] the worship of the
[1:13:05] mother it's called mariology if you want
[1:13:07] to look it up they put Mary above Jesus
[1:13:11] because she's nicer more nice she's
[1:13:14] sweet to you let's pray to her let's
[1:13:16] don't pray to Jesus cuz he's
[1:13:19] mean but now notice that even as it was
[1:13:21] back in Babylon that the worship of the
[1:13:23] son began to lose out in favor of the
[1:13:24] worship of of the mother so she
[1:13:26] literally began to take the place of the
[1:13:29] son we see in this age that the Pagan
[1:13:32] worship of sardus was the worship of the
[1:13:34] woman it was sail alone not sail and
[1:13:38] deas at the end the mother has literally
[1:13:41] taken the place of the son endowed with
[1:13:43] the merits of godhead now listen the the
[1:13:46] spirit in that Catholic Church which was
[1:13:48] evil the devil saw that saw the people
[1:13:52] in Sardis enjoyed that saw that they
[1:13:55] took to that and what would they start
[1:13:56] doing they inserted marry and Jesus in
[1:14:00] there this whole Catholic Church It
[1:14:02] Ain't Nothing But The Devil sure there's
[1:14:05] good people in there there sincere
[1:14:06] people in there but every Doctrine they
[1:14:09] have is a madeup
[1:14:13] lie all one needs to do is go over her
[1:14:16] various titles and recall the lovely
[1:14:18] attributes accorded Mary by the Roman
[1:14:20] Church to understand where the religion
[1:14:22] of this age came from the that this is
[1:14:25] the age of the first real break with
[1:14:27] Papa Rome that actually flourished what
[1:14:30] what you doing Martin Luther Martin
[1:14:32] Luther is a reformer right he's and he's
[1:14:34] a Protestant he's protesting the
[1:14:36] Catholic Church all right he was in it
[1:14:39] for all the time but
[1:14:41] watch no doubt caused the Jezebel
[1:14:43] prophetess to consolidate and emphasize
[1:14:46] her doctrine of
[1:14:48] mariolatry in decided opposition to the
[1:14:51] Protestants who denied her any part in
[1:14:54] the Plan of Salvation apart from her
[1:14:57] favor with God in other words as be in
[1:14:59] the
[1:15:01] oven Mary was the oven Mary was the womb
[1:15:05] that brought Jesus that's it cuz Mary
[1:15:07] had to be
[1:15:09] saved Mary had to go to Pentecost to get
[1:15:12] born
[1:15:13] again but they said she died and
[1:15:15] resurrected went to
[1:15:17] heaven just like
[1:15:22] Jesus as Luther crystallized the doctr
[1:15:25] of justification by faith they held to
[1:15:27] Works Penance prayers and other
[1:15:29] unscriptural means and as the freed
[1:15:31] Christians glorified the son the Roman
[1:15:34] Catholics increased their deification of
[1:15:36] Mary see how Satan God said hey you go
[1:15:39] that way and I'm going this
[1:15:41] way the Roman Catholics increased their
[1:15:43] deification of Mary until the 20th
[1:15:46] century now watch this is now the 20th
[1:15:48] century saw in opposition to most high
[1:15:51] ranking Roman the theologians now this
[1:15:54] is
[1:15:55] they opposed it Pope P literally exalted
[1:15:59] Mary to glorification in a resurrected
[1:16:03] body there's only one God there's only
[1:16:07] one empty tomb it's not
[1:16:10] Mary's sister Julie and brother Gary
[1:16:12] were there close by so I believe that
[1:16:14] she's probably still in there the body
[1:16:16] of it is anyway that Doctrine is
[1:16:19] absolutely the babylonius one of the son
[1:16:22] carrying the mother bodily into heaven
[1:16:25] all right let's talk about Martin Luther
[1:16:27] he was born in 1483 and we'll stop right
[1:16:29] here he died in 1546 he was 62 years old
[1:16:33] he was a little bit sickly later on in
[1:16:35] his years but Martin Luther was a German
[1:16:38] but now remember before we get started
[1:16:41] here's where you're going to look at
[1:16:42] like brother Chad Lamb said it's it's
[1:16:45] simple to see this but yet it's going to
[1:16:46] be hard to see this it's going to be
[1:16:49] simple to see that Martin Luther was led
[1:16:51] by God that he was a born again
[1:16:53] Christian and his
[1:16:55] age but you going to see some things
[1:16:57] over here that he did that didn't look
[1:16:59] very good but he was a man but he was
[1:17:02] remember he was a
[1:17:04] reformer he wasn't a restorer we needed
[1:17:07] a restorer we didn't need a reformer
[1:17:10] here in this
[1:17:12] age Jesus no wait a minute the Bible
[1:17:15] says I will
[1:17:18] reform what the k go no he said I will
[1:17:21] restore whatever was eat I'm going to
[1:17:24] restore it so that's why
[1:17:25] like brother Wilson said if the if they
[1:17:27] eat him down in the old at the end of
[1:17:29] the Old Testament they killed Jesus
[1:17:32] amen he resurrected was Son of God
[1:17:35] through the church Ages was happy to be
[1:17:37] in Martin Luther even though Martin
[1:17:38] Luther had some problems but he had to
[1:17:41] come over here in the end time and raise
[1:17:42] it all back up to see it
[1:17:46] again because the seed's what went in
[1:17:48] the ground all right everybody with me
[1:17:51] so let's read a minute on him just a
[1:17:52] second he was a German priest theologian
[1:17:55] author he wrote hymns he was a professor
[1:17:58] and an augustinian frier Luther was the
[1:18:01] seminal figure of the Protestant
[1:18:03] Reformation and his theological beliefs
[1:18:06] formed the B basis of
[1:18:08] Lutheranism he is widely regarded as one
[1:18:10] of the most influential figures in
[1:18:13] Western and Christian history brother R
[1:18:15] said the same thing he's very important
[1:18:16] man he was one of the most popular ones
[1:18:18] why because he started the reformations
[1:18:20] he started the protesting of the cath
[1:18:23] listen people were scared to do it they
[1:18:26] were scared to death literally to death
[1:18:28] to even say anything against the priest
[1:18:30] that's why those priests could have
[1:18:32] listen that those priests they had women
[1:18:35] they had boys they did whatever they
[1:18:38] wanted
[1:18:41] to demon
[1:18:44] possessed but called it priesthood
[1:18:46] because they were under the ospice of
[1:18:47] the Catholic Church Luther was ordained
[1:18:50] to the priesthood in 1507 he came to
[1:18:52] reject several teachings and practices
[1:18:54] of the Roman Catholic Church in
[1:18:56] particular he disputed The View on
[1:18:59] indulgences Luther attempted to resolve
[1:19:02] these differences amicably remember
[1:19:04] brother Dell told us many years ago the
[1:19:06] way you read Martin Luther Martin Luther
[1:19:08] sure he protested sure he was he was
[1:19:11] wanting to bring the the church he
[1:19:12] didn't want he didn't want to do away
[1:19:13] with the Catholic Church
[1:19:15] though he still brought some of their
[1:19:20] Doctrine now this age that we're in now
[1:19:24] the Resto St he didn't bring any of them
[1:19:26] doctrines out with him he cut them
[1:19:30] down Luther attempted to resolve these
[1:19:33] differences amicably first proposing an
[1:19:36] academic discussion of the practice and
[1:19:39] efficacy of indulges in his 95 thesis
[1:19:43] which he authored in 1517 I believe it
[1:19:45] was in October in 1520 though the pope
[1:19:49] gets involved he demanded that Luther
[1:19:52] renounce all of his writings and I'm I'm
[1:19:54] going to read to you what he wrote back
[1:19:55] to the to the priest I mean to the to
[1:19:57] the
[1:19:58] pope uh to to their
[1:20:01] God he demanded that Luther renounced
[1:20:03] all of his writings and when Luther
[1:20:05] refused to do it he was excommunicated
[1:20:07] in January
[1:20:08] 1521 later that year Holy Roman Emperor
[1:20:11] Charles IV condemned Luther as an outlaw
[1:20:14] when Luther died in 1546 Pope Leo the
[1:20:18] 10th excommunication was still in effect
[1:20:21] do you know they sent people to kill
[1:20:23] him and they couldn't do it the Roman
[1:20:26] Catholic Church sent people to kill
[1:20:28] Martin Luther like
[1:20:31] a007 thing you know couldn't do it he
[1:20:34] always get out from under listen you
[1:20:36] ain't going to go to God's ready for you
[1:20:37] to go his ministry wasn't over actually
[1:20:39] just been started Jo he condemned Luther
[1:20:42] as an outlaw Luther taught that
[1:20:44] salvation and consequently eternal life
[1:20:47] are not earned by Good Deeds rather they
[1:20:49] are received only as the free gift of
[1:20:52] God's grace through the believer
[1:20:54] believer faith in Jesus Christ listen
[1:20:56] this was not known for 900
[1:20:58] years believe the pope believe your
[1:21:01] priest believe in indulgences believe in
[1:21:03] purgatory believe that we can pray you
[1:21:05] out believe that we can pray you into
[1:21:07] heaven and for a man to stand up one man
[1:21:11] to stand up and
[1:21:12] say that ain't right none of that's
[1:21:17] right wow all right listen what stand do
[1:21:21] we make for this gospel we're preaching
[1:21:23] now that's right
[1:21:26] eternal life are not earned by Good
[1:21:27] Deeds rather they are received only as
[1:21:30] the free gift of God's grace through the
[1:21:31] believer's faith in Jesus Christ who is
[1:21:33] the sole Redeemer from sin not mother
[1:21:36] Mary not not no not your P not your
[1:21:40] priest not your not your pope Luther's
[1:21:43] theology challenged the authority and
[1:21:45] Office of the Pope by teaching that the
[1:21:47] Bible is the only
[1:21:50] source he's getting in trouble now the
[1:21:53] only source of divinely revealed
[1:21:59] knowledge Luther's translation of the
[1:22:02] Bible in dejour from Latin made the
[1:22:04] Bible vastly more accessible to the
[1:22:06] letin now this is where they were trying
[1:22:07] to kill him they didn't want that Bible
[1:22:10] to be translated from Latin so that
[1:22:12] people can understand
[1:22:14] it right which had a tremendous impact
[1:22:18] on both the church and German culture it
[1:22:20] fostered the development of a standard
[1:22:22] version of the German Lang language
[1:22:25] added several principles to the art of
[1:22:27] translation and influenced the writing
[1:22:29] of an English translation the tendale
[1:22:32] Bible and remember what they did to
[1:22:34] tendale they drag him through the street
[1:22:36] till he till he died because of putting
[1:22:38] the Bible
[1:22:40] together his hymns influenced the
[1:22:43] development of singing in Protestant
[1:22:46] churches his marriage to Catherine
[1:22:48] vonora a former nun set a model for the
[1:22:51] practice of clerical marriage now look
[1:22:53] he was a he was a a um uh he was what
[1:22:57] was he he was a like a
[1:22:59] monk he couldn't you you didn't get
[1:23:01] married in the Catholic Church men
[1:23:04] didn't get didn't didn't have wives well
[1:23:07] they did but you wern't supposed
[1:23:10] to but Martin Luther comes out and says
[1:23:14] I'm going to marry this
[1:23:15] girl it was a friend of his if you'll
[1:23:17] read all the history it was a friend of
[1:23:18] his married her she was a former
[1:23:20] nun and then after that he began to
[1:23:23] preach a o in Protestants to marry so he
[1:23:26] developed that too where for 900 years
[1:23:29] they couldn't do
[1:23:30] that and twoo later works Luther
[1:23:33] expressed anti- judaistic now here's
[1:23:35] where it gets a little antsy calling for
[1:23:38] the expulsion of Jews and the burning of
[1:23:41] synagogues these works also targeted
[1:23:44] Roman Catholics anabaptist and
[1:23:46] non-trinitarian Christians based upon
[1:23:49] his teachings despite the fact that
[1:23:50] Luther did not Advocate the murdering of
[1:23:52] Jews some historians contend that his
[1:23:55] rhetoric now remember he was
[1:23:56] German his rhetoric contributed to the
[1:23:59] development of anti-Semitism in Germany
[1:24:03] and the emergence centuries later of the
[1:24:05] Nazi
[1:24:07] party that's history Luther dedicated
[1:24:11] himself to the augustinian order devoted
[1:24:12] himself to fasting long hours in prayer
[1:24:15] pilgrimage and frequent confessions
[1:24:18] Luther described this period of his life
[1:24:20] as one of deep spiritual despair now
[1:24:21] watch what he said he said I lost tou
[1:24:24] with Christ the Savior and comforter and
[1:24:26] made of him the Jailer and hangman of my
[1:24:29] poor
[1:24:31] soul that was under Catholicism cuz
[1:24:33] that's what he does he was condemned
[1:24:34] condemned condemned condemned
[1:24:37] condemned and he's telling us that
[1:24:39] Christ is the Healer the Savior the
[1:24:40] comforter and I made him a
[1:24:43] Jailer of my poor soul here's a letter
[1:24:46] to the Pope I enjoyed the reading this
[1:24:48] his letter to the pope now listen he's
[1:24:49] writing a letter to the pope now he's
[1:24:51] writing a letter to
[1:24:52] God well so the what they said the first
[1:24:56] and chief article is this Jesus Christ
[1:24:59] Our God and Lord died for our sins and
[1:25:02] was raised again for our justification
[1:25:04] Romans
[1:25:05] 3:4 he alone is the Lamb of God who
[1:25:08] takes away the sins of the world well
[1:25:10] that made him mad to begin with and God
[1:25:12] has laid on him the iniquity of us all
[1:25:16] not penen not
[1:25:18] indulgences all have sinned and are
[1:25:20] Justified freely without their own works
[1:25:23] and merits by his grace gra through the
[1:25:25] Redemption that is in Christ Jesus in
[1:25:27] his blood Romans 3:23 this is necessary
[1:25:31] to believe this cannot be otherwise
[1:25:34] acquired or grasped by any work law or
[1:25:36] Merit therefore it is clear and certain
[1:25:39] that this that this faith alone
[1:25:42] justifies us nothing of this article can
[1:25:45] be yielded or surrendered even though
[1:25:48] Heaven and Earth and everything else
[1:25:50] Falls and the pope read that P read that
[1:25:54] and that's when he excommunicated
[1:25:57] him now here's a letter to his followers
[1:26:00] now watch this we'll close right here in
[1:26:03] these sermons he hammered home the
[1:26:06] premacy of core Christian values such as
[1:26:08] love patience charity freedom and
[1:26:12] reminded the citizens to trust God's
[1:26:14] word rather than violence to bring about
[1:26:17] necessary
[1:26:18] change do you know that the devil what
[1:26:21] the devil thinks when he sees men use
[1:26:24] vience to propagate the
[1:26:26] gospel he sits with his folded arms
[1:26:29] behind the fire of hell and says with
[1:26:31] malignant looks and frightful grin ah
[1:26:34] how wise these man men are to play my
[1:26:37] game let them go on I shall reap the
[1:26:40] benefit I Delight in it but when he sees
[1:26:44] the word running and contending alone on
[1:26:46] the battlefield he shutters and shakes
[1:26:49] for
[1:26:51] fear so Martin Luther was a reformer
[1:26:53] brother says
[1:26:55] look he was a mighty preacher and a
[1:26:57] teacher of the word and insisted
[1:26:59] especially in his first years of public
[1:27:00] Eminence that the word was the sole
[1:27:02] Criterium thus he was against works as a
[1:27:05] means of Salvation and baptism as a
[1:27:07] means of regeneration he taught the
[1:27:09] mediation of Christ apart from man was
[1:27:13] as was the original and Pentecostal
[1:27:15] concept he was a man given to much
[1:27:17] prayer and had learned that the more
[1:27:20] work he had to do the more sorely he was
[1:27:22] pressed for time the more of his time he
[1:27:24] gave to God In Prayer in order to ensure
[1:27:26] satisfactory results he knew what it was
[1:27:29] to battle with the devil and it said
[1:27:32] that Satan one day visibly appeared to
[1:27:34] him and he flung an in inell at him
[1:27:36] bidding him to go another time two
[1:27:39] Fanatics came to him to induce him to
[1:27:41] join with them in banishing all priests
[1:27:43] and bibles he discerned the spirit
[1:27:45] within them and sent them off it is
[1:27:47] recorded of Dr Martin Luther in Sour's
[1:27:50] history that he was a Prophet evangelist
[1:27:53] speaker in tongues
[1:27:54] interpreter in one person he was endowed
[1:27:57] with all nine gifts of the Spirit what
[1:28:00] stirred his heart by the Holy Ghost In
[1:28:01] which was the little green shoot that
[1:28:03] signified that truth was coming back to
[1:28:06] the church see that's what's important
[1:28:08] truth was coming back to the church but
[1:28:10] it looked just like two little shoes it
[1:28:12] wasn't the stock it wasn't the tassel it
[1:28:13] wasn't the seed it was two little
[1:28:15] shoes as it was known at Pentecost was
[1:28:18] the doctrine of justification salvation
[1:28:20] by grace apart from works I recognize
[1:28:23] that d Dr Luther did not believe only
[1:28:26] and preach only justification but that
[1:28:28] his major theme as indeed it had to be
[1:28:31] for it was the basic doctrine of the
[1:28:33] truth of the word he will be forever
[1:28:35] known as the instrument in the hand of
[1:28:37] God who revived this truth he was the
[1:28:40] fifth messenger and his message was the
[1:28:42] just shall live by faith surely we admit
[1:28:45] that he knew and did teach that we are
[1:28:47] to go from Faith to Faith His Marvelous
[1:28:49] understanding of sovereignty election
[1:28:51] predestination and other truth show him
[1:28:54] to be a great man in the word yet I say
[1:28:56] again as do historians God used him to
[1:28:58] bring to the people God's standard
[1:29:01] against works the just shall live by
[1:29:04] faith when you become a Christian that's
[1:29:07] what you got to
[1:29:08] realize that you're justified by
[1:29:13] faith and actually he wrote in one of
[1:29:15] his Bibles his one of his U uh copies of
[1:29:19] the Bible he wrote
[1:29:21] alone justified by faith alone
[1:29:24] now watch they'll do this then we'll
[1:29:26] close musicians come on now as I
[1:29:28] mentioned already this age was been
[1:29:30] called by the historians the period of
[1:29:32] reformation that is exactly right that
[1:29:35] is what it was it had to be that for
[1:29:37] Martin Luther was a reformer not a
[1:29:39] prophet so he was not able to lead the
[1:29:41] church back to the whole truth and would
[1:29:44] be a man like the Apostle Paul who was
[1:29:46] both Apostle and
[1:29:50] Prophet the word does not call it a
[1:29:52] restoration but certainly calls it
[1:29:54] Reformation had it been a restoration
[1:29:56] that age would have been another
[1:29:57] Pentecostal age let's stand but it was
[1:29:59] not the best that could be said was
[1:30:02] strengthen that which remains that is
[1:30:04] ready to die there was something missing
[1:30:07] my yes there certainly was this age had
[1:30:10] justification but it missed
[1:30:13] sanctification and the baptism with the
[1:30:15] Holy Ghost that is what God's original
[1:30:17] plan was that is what they had at
[1:30:19] Pentecost they were Justified they were
[1:30:21] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:23] while listen to me the reason for being
[1:30:25] justified and Sanctified is to the end
[1:30:27] that you might be baptized with the Holy
[1:30:29] Ghost that is the reason there is a
[1:30:31] church it's the temple of God filled
[1:30:34] with God even the Holy Ghost The Same
[1:30:36] Spirit that was in Jesus while he was
[1:30:38] here on Earth causing him to do the
[1:30:40] mighty Works which he did came back upon
[1:30:42] the church at Pentecost so that they did
[1:30:46] the works that he did this age did not
[1:30:49] have those work
[1:30:51] watch all they had the written word but
[1:30:54] not the revealed word only a revealed
[1:30:57] word comes by what a prophet a prophet
[1:31:00] is a Divine revealer of the word of God
[1:31:04] that's why we had to have a prophet in
[1:31:05] the end time according to Malachi 4 to
[1:31:07] turn our hearts back oh they had the
[1:31:10] written word but not the revealed word
[1:31:12] this was the Reformation period but fear
[1:31:14] not little flock God said I will restore
[1:31:17] and this reform was going to be the
[1:31:19] start of it he was going to according to
[1:31:21] his promise take the church back from
[1:31:23] the depth of Satan in the dark ages to
[1:31:25] the depth of God that they had at
[1:31:26] Pentecost and in the first few years of
[1:31:28] the existence of the church now be
[1:31:30] careful and get this in the second verse
[1:31:33] I read for I have not found thy Work
[1:31:34] perfect before God do you know what the
[1:31:37] meaning of not perfect really is it's
[1:31:41] unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled
[1:31:47] age it just start it was just the start
[1:31:50] of getting
[1:31:52] back that is why said the Bible called
[1:31:54] it
[1:31:55] Reformation that's going down here it
[1:31:57] was wonderfully good but God had said
[1:32:00] 1500 years before Luther you're going to
[1:32:03] start things but your age will see it
[1:32:05] all unfulfilled I'm leaving that to
[1:32:08] later hallelujah our god reth he knows
[1:32:11] the end from the beginning yes Luther
[1:32:13] was his messenger it didn't look like it
[1:32:15] as We examined the flaws but there was a
[1:32:17] man called Jonah he had flaws in his
[1:32:19] life too he was a prophet though you and
[1:32:22] I might not want to say so and the basis
[1:32:24] of how he acted now this was an
[1:32:26] unfulfilled age it was an age of
[1:32:29] reformation but that is how God wanted
[1:32:33] it so you don't condemn that's how God
[1:32:36] wanted it he wanted it to he want listen
[1:32:39] God will make a mistake I know you've
[1:32:40] heard that
[1:32:41] before so what he started he's going to
[1:32:43] finish the only reason and way that you
[1:32:46] and I can develop what we call the born
[1:32:50] again or New Birth experience is start
[1:32:52] by justification knowing that it's not
[1:32:55] your Works knowing that is being
[1:32:57] justified by faith in Jesus Christ gets
[1:33:00] you started on your
[1:33:02] journey
[1:33:04] period nothing else you can work
[1:33:06] yourself to death and die and go to
[1:33:10] hell but you truly Justified the Bible
[1:33:13] says what he who is Justified he's
[1:33:16] already glorified true justification
[1:33:20] listen to me true justification leads to
[1:33:22] true glorification
[1:33:24] and it had to start in a man called
[1:33:26] Martin Luther who hated the Jews he
[1:33:29] started an Insurrection that killed
[1:33:31] thousand people didn't read that one he
[1:33:33] had a lot of flaws you know what so did
[1:33:35] Moses Moses was a great man right what'
[1:33:38] Moses do he killed a guy he was a
[1:33:39] murderer everybody with me Paul what'
[1:33:42] Paul do Paul was one of the greatest
[1:33:44] Messengers he ever was what'd he do he
[1:33:46] caused Christians to
[1:33:48] die caused them to
[1:33:51] blaspheme but God still used them
[1:33:54] you know what all I see is Grace thank
[1:33:57] God for Grace Grace and Martin Luther
[1:34:00] he's going to be there you going to be
[1:34:01] able to sit down beside of him and say
[1:34:03] hey tell me how it was he's going to say
[1:34:06] no you tell me how it was in
[1:34:09] yours yours is horrible mine was getting
[1:34:12] out of the I know he understood he
[1:34:14] doesn't now what he was doing he was
[1:34:16] pulling at people come out of her my
[1:34:18] people get out of that thing and then
[1:34:20] here in the last end time you and I are
[1:34:22] to come to a full re Revelation where he
[1:34:25] had part Revelation he was a reformer
[1:34:27] you and I have come under a message of
[1:34:30] restoration restored back to the faith
[1:34:33] of the fathers way back in Paul's day
[1:34:37] God bless you that's exactly what God
[1:34:39] wanted done God is pleased with what he
[1:34:43] put in
[1:34:45] motion you and I sometimes put things in
[1:34:48] motion and we're not really pleased at
[1:34:49] it but when God put something in motion
[1:34:51] he steps out listen if he drop eternal
[1:34:54] life in Martin Luther's
[1:34:55] Soul it's the same Holy Ghost you got
[1:34:59] the only difference is is he had this
[1:35:00] word to work with you and I have got the
[1:35:04] unsealed word to work with not just
[1:35:07] partial but the whole unsealed word
[1:35:09] according to Revelations 5 then we go to
[1:35:12] Revelations 10 where the lamb came down
[1:35:14] with a book in his hand open it was an
[1:35:16] open book let's sing a song God bless
[1:35:18] you we'll finish the rest of this a
[1:35:19] little bit later I looked over
[1:35:23] and what did I see Coming For To Carry
