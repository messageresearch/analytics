thank the Lord for that if you got your Bibles we start in the Book of John and just keep us in your prayers we're working about seven days a week you can't work much more than that to make an eight day which I wish we were in and then we wouldn't have to do the other seven but since we're still in this seven we're gonna have to work got off about 8 30 last night went back this morning for a little while so I uh something I hadn't done and years worked on a Sunday but uh circumstances show that we have to every once in a while one of the owners walked in and said well I think I think we've got our Ox in the ditch we're gonna have to get it out I said well that's fine I said but you just don't keep kicking him in on Saturday night so we have to work on Sunday if you let him get in the ditch it's okay for God to say you get him out but if you kick him in a ditch on Saturday night and you then you'd have to get him out so that's a little bit different so he said yeah you're exactly right so but just pray for us John 1 let's buy our heads just keep mom in your prayers I ain't seen her in since Monday much so we've kind of had a had a week that uh dad stuck his head in the door and I felt like Jewel Forney I fell asleep about to right at two o'clock so just pray for us the heavenly father we pray Lord that you just be with us take us and Motors into the image that you want us to be in father we know that this is the last and morphe of God that the world will see and we're it's not a joke it's not uh it's not something that's a fantasy world or or something that um that maybe that man has concocted in their mind but it's a reality this is what you wanted this was your mind you wanted to be in a group of people in the end time showing yourself in your word father we pray now that you just take care of each one of us that should strengthen us give us Lord Our Daily Bread forgive us of our trespasses Lord just help us if any sick be among us you said you sent your word and healed them and delivered them from destruction so as the word Goes Forth father May Lord your soothing Holy Spirit Come Among Us Lord and just take all the doubt and fears away all the anxiety father just be with us take the fear away from each one of us I know in the end time lord we see the pressures of the world and trying to squeeze us Lord but brother random said he said it would squeeze us up and that's what we want to do we want to be squeezed up we want to be caught out of here Lord and we got to do it Lord by this reveal word father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes be with us Lord keep us protect us and we love you because your lovely name is Jesus Christ and that's where all of us say Amen John 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended at night now let's skip over to verse 9. in other words he's talking about John let's go and read verse six there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light now look at that light is capital L so that's not just a false light or a or a flashlight or a moon or a sun or anything that's uh that's a different kind of light that all men through him might believe he was not he was not that like talking about John he was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light capital L which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not verse 14. and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now one more Colossians one these are all familiar but we're going to set a little basis today and I hate to say prove a point but it says but it's just kind of nail a point home that that maybe we can uh um in our daily life our conversation with other people that will order shine something on our um give us a revelation about what he's trying to say to us all right Colossians 1 verse 15. who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature every firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created now who's he talking about Christ Jesus Christ excuse me all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things created by Him and guess what everything was created for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist or does it consists by the son the s-o-n and he is the head of the body of the church who's the beginning of the first born from the dead now it's talking about Jesus Christ we know that that in all things he might have the preeminence and that's for another um lesson but we'll just stop right there and you may be seated in the Lord has blessings of reading his word we've had there's been some questions I asked um especially to me in different places that uh people not understood what the when we when we um I know Dad's hey he has terminology Brother Richard Wilson they have terminology they have certain things that they say I have certain things that I say there are certain phrases and and things that we say that sometimes that they're not understood so maybe sometimes they need to be explained a little bit more so this we're going to look today and try to I wrote these notes at about 10 45 last night about two pages so it took me about 20 minutes so Terence said I got 25 to preach it so here we go I'm not a Note Reader I don't just read my notes I write a few bullet points down and then I try to fill in between the lines right I believe that's what God Said did in his word he wrote his word but he filled in the lines for an eternity so this word will never go away everything in between the lines is just as Eternal as the lines as long as it lines up with the lines all right so let's go back now to Genesis one what we're going to do today is we're going to take the Son of God in the Old Testament and take him to the son of man in the New Testament but we're going to show that there's there's many things that that the prophet said and we're going to read some quotes about us being The Offspring of God but the whole basis today is going to be on showing that in the Old Testament how in the Old Testament that they were um even Cain was a Son of God by birth natural birth that's right but he was not a son of God by spiritual birth or he had been a born-again Christian Abraham was not a son of God by the new birth he was the son of God by natural birth and he is part of the economy of God he's not a sinner as far as we say that's going to go to hell no Abraham's one of our foundation foundational fathers but he was not a born-again Christian a Son of God by birth not in Genesis 1 26 and 27 person now that's hard for people in this message to swallow believe me I've had phone calls about it but it's true people we got to see who this son of God is and understand that this son of God is not just every person that's born on the face of the Earth but it is every person that's born on the face of the Earth just like Daddy said this morning you know you can make a quote and say Well everybody's the Son of God that's exactly the truth Adolf Hitler was the son of God where'd he come from he was an offspring of God giving him life right but he was not a son of God by the new birth that made him a child of God or an offspring that Paul was saying an offspring of God all right so let's try to understand that Josh where'd Josh go I need some water I didn't bring them up usually I bring my own water up here but I didn't bring my water today so let's go back to Genesis one and let's just look and see where this and it may be Elementary to some but it never hurts to stir up our minds because you can hear something over and over again and you'll say I didn't hear that how many times have you read a book or listen to tape and and a preacher come up and and read a quote out of that same message and you say I just read that last week but I didn't even hear that quote mentioned all right well you know what that's God and his sovereignty he gives it to you in his time not your time all right so in Genesis 1 we got it we must see the physical creation because there was a physical creation right right okay natural creation of man a six day creation that we have to deal with because we have to see that God thank you Sunday school teacher this one's already been open and I do want to um clarify something that that my little brother said in Sunday school class this morning he said that I told him to live because he asked brother Joe and him if I called him I did not when I called my brother yesterday and asked him to do his Sunday school this morning I said I can't find anybody I didn't say I called everybody I was in the middle of a plan in the middle of doing something I said I can't find anybody I didn't say I called brother Joe or call brother Danny or call Brother um Donnie farbush I didn't say that so technically it may have been a little white lie but I guess they're all wise and I do apologize but I just wanted him to see what he could do so I'm gonna get started and after spending eight minutes of telling him about me missing church and telling a lie he had about four minutes of good things to say so he's always been a man of few words anyway so but what he says he means what he says so we thank the Lord for that it's like Dad said well thank God that we got it God's got an economy just like just like governments and he's got people that step in positions and do things and and when you think man we're at the bottom of the barrel we scraped it then here comes down so in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth all right and the Earth was without forming board and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters now what is God doing as the prophet is telling us that that God is unfolding himself God has never changed if we believe in in Hebrews 13 8 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever God had no new thought or had no new purpose or he didn't come to a place and say oh gosh I messed up I need to start over again right then he always was this Hebrews 13 right amen he always wants the substance of this Hebrews 13 8. now not was not always the flesh God right okay but he created something where he could get his body from right and that Earth isn't Eternal come on cause tell me when this Earth's gonna pass away come on this Earth is not going to be annihilated it's going to be changed right all right man so look at verse 3 and God said we we looked at this in Sunday school and sister Trudy about how to flip and fit back and down in Sunday school but we're going to go over it again just for her and that's sister Trudy McMillan not the other sister Trudy I told Terrence he'd have a problem with sister Trudy I just didn't tell him which one and God said let there be light and there was light now there was no creative act even Schofield picked this up he said let there be light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light look at that capital letter d a y right right not a 24-hour day that's always been the day of the Lord Capital d-a-y that's in the middle of a sentence that's not the first all right and the Darkness he called night Capital nigst what was God doing he was separating himself from Darkness because the absence of light is what Darkness so he didn't create Darkness Darkness is just something that came about because there was no light right now even a man named Albert Einstein proved that he was in college one time I know some of you read it on the internet but that was his question someone was questioning god making Darkness and Albert Einstein proved that Darkness doesn't exist right it only exists because of the absence of light right and this life that God is creating or this God is bringing forth here because remember in verse 14 through about 18 He makes the sun and the moon so this is not the Sun and the Moon that he's that he's bringing forth here right and I want to say bring forth and create and bring forth kind of makes people kind of loopy you know but create is to bring something that never was God can't bring something that there never was if it was his light for this is God's light that he's talking about right here this is not the Sun and the Moon that we see as natural l-i-g-h-t because remember in verse 16 God made two great lights right sun and moon so in this Genesis 1 I believe this is where the Prophet comes down and he sees that God he starts out and that logos comes out and begins to create right because he separates himself from Satan way before he even starts the creation of the world so it creates the day from the night it's going to be the day of the Lord and the night of the devil if you want to call it that but here's where the Son of God begins to show himself he begins to let us understand that hey I'm not making a sun in the Moon I'm showing you who I am my life which is eternal life and then there's darkness that comes because of the absence of this eternal life that's why hell is not eternal because it's going to go away one day it's going to just completely disappear and even if you look down I even noticed the other day look in verse 10 even the earth and the Seas has capital letters I don't believe these things are going to go away these things that God has created are going to stay here all right the six days of creation God's never going to do away with any of those right now it fell right it became sinful death ruled all through all these uh even in the grass and trees and and the whales that he created all those things we know death but nothing has nothing has stopped right everything's still going just like you're supposed to uh an eternal God doesn't say something and then it go away and never come back all right so now we get though to Genesis 1 26. and we see that God has come to a place that he's bringing a condition yeah now this light that we're talking about that God show or this day which is not which is daytime all right which is day which is light because we read that in Genesis 1 what he was the creator of God and in him was light and that light was capital l i g h t right which is not a son or a moon but now watch God Is So connected to his creation that he never come apart from it and we're looking at Redemption and we're showing maybe down in the Sunday school class we'll get into this more but we're going to take the Son of God because we took to me it helps to parallel something and your brother Brandon had a way of doing it that he could take an example and he could take these take this example and he could move it through a sermon and he would bring out what he wanted to what he wanted to say he started with this example like we started with the Millennium a millennium is a tie for the future home but there's things in the Millennium that want migrate or move over into the future home and there's things in the future home that won't be in the millennium but if you'll compare the two you'll see how God is I hate to say evolving but he is God is evolving he's evolving because even through Creative Evolution he was he was evolving he wasn't evolving amen you're in my intelligence maybe I can say is evolving because God doesn't evolve D he always was always well-being can't be any different so he's not evolving but he wants us to evolve because one thing's for sure if if if we drop an ink pen on the floor and we reached down and picked that ink pen up it's got to come back to the same place to be fully restored so if I drop the ink pen and if I pick it up going to only take it a couple inches and lay it on a Shelf because running around made the illustration he said I dropped this book and pick up a pencil he said that's not bringing back what was like what was dropped but I go a little bit further if that book don't come back to the original condition that it was then before then it's not fully restored because if you take that book and you take care and you knock it off and it hits the floor and you pick it up and go lay it over here that's not restoring it back to its original condition right its original condition was right here so that's why God in this Creation in the in the Book of Genesis remember that's the C chapter so we're all going back to that that's what we're going back to when we get back to the future home we're going to get back to be able to read Genesis 1 through 27 28 and on in there and then we'll be able to say hey we're standing in it right now that's just the way I believe because that's fully redeemed that's bringing it right back to where God wanted it to be but God to be a Savior and a Healer and all those things we know that the fall had to happen but he never pulled his or disconnected himself from the creation of man he was always connected to the creation because remember in Romans 8 we get over that Romans 8 right down at the end of time for you and me and it says the whole creation is groaning waiting for what the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God now it's grown for thousands of years Adam was going to not let the fall happen or our atom was not going to be the one that that destroyed the thing he was the one that was going to keep it the way it should have been supposed to have right being Son of God that's what he was going to do he was going to keep it as a condition that God had because you and I the same way here on Earth We're stewards of the earth and being stewards of the Earth We're supposed to keep this in this close to an even condition as we can I know we do a bad job of it but still the whole creation is groaning waiting on what you and I to get back to that condition to where Adam can look and say to remove line go lay down bird you know don't fly this way fly that you know that was Adam's condition that was God's harmony with his creation Glory all right now but now this son of God was a spirit God but when we when we say you know brother Brown said well he was Son of God through the old through the uh Church ages we think of spirit god well it was Spirit God but it was God still dwelling in people right but there was a situation that and it's like I told the brother I said it's just so simple for people stumble over it right because after the fall God took the ability to all for all this to come about he took that away from Adam and there was enmity or a division now I was thinking about today this morning when Dad was speaking on Genesis 3 15 that when he said that I'm going to put enmity between thy see that one that one verse of scripture covered 6 000 years you said I don't know there's only four to Jesus no we're the ending of this creation amen let's don't stop it at 4 000 years that one scripture was six thousand years because the the scripture says he was going to bruise the head of the serpent we know he did that at Calvary potentially but like Dad said excuse me Wednesday night apart it's not a pardon unless it's accepted right there's nobody knew how to really accept this full pardon until right now right and that's the pardon of this guy you're looking at right here they didn't have a problem pardoning the inside guy the Son of God right down Through the Ages it cleaned up the man's soul that was okay because people understood that Paul and all had a great understanding but still Paul looked to the groaning of this man the one you're looking at here right grown within ourselves waiting for what the adoption to wet the Redemption of the body so let's go to Hebrews 9 because folks the problem I tell you what the biggest problem is a lack of teaching and brothers I tell you what I pulled a daddy where's brother Mark and come back no okay I pulled a day I got to talk to this brother and he was he was just couldn't understand that that Abraham wasn't a Son of God just like we are and I got to talking to him and Donnie brother Donnie walked up and brother Mark walked up I said brother what you need is a good case of teaching so he goes rattling off about something and I just slip outside and left Donnie and and mark right and I just went on back and started doing stuff in the kitchen over at the uh when we were doing the cooking at brother burley's camp and uh left them to the fight a little bit so I got it started so I let them try to fit and you know come finish it but you know people getting Watch What Happens we've talked we were starting to talk about Abraham and this brother started on predestination he said I know that was that that that there's predefinition and and it's by four dollars he said but I just know I was this seed before the foundation of the world and there's no way I could have come except this way thank you well you know what and he was talking about Peter and all the apostles I said well I said so they were all predestinated Eternal seed of God Walking With Jesus on shores of Galilee oh yeah brother and I wished I'd have told him this one thing because Daddy brought it out this morning why did Peter why did Peter have to put it in the Eternal Word of God if he was always this seed and he was this eternal person with God before he was born again why did he come to Second Peter 1 19 and say I now have a more sure word of Prophecy right right why didn't he just say bless God I was on the mountain with God I saw God I understood the whole program if he was just some couldn't go come any other way Eternal see to God why didn't he understand it then right right why did they have a problem why did all of them have a problem with Jesus every time he turned around he was rebuking them and telling them you know all he had to do was look at him and say Hey You Was Born This Way he was born right to begin with but no you were not right you were born wrong amen but God in Hebrews 9 to me this explains the whole program of the Old Testament and we'll read some quotes in just a minute but let's turn to Hebrews 9. it all comes down to blood our soul blood and soul because an animal does not have a soul animal has life in his blood but he does not have eternal life in his blood he does not have a saving power so therefore nobody in the Old Testament we can stop right now nobody in the Old Testament had the blood of Jesus Christ to take their sins away sure they were looking forward to it but they had a substitute right and under a substitute that does not make a son and daughter of God right God don't have substitute Sons and Daughters amen blessing you know I didn't mind when The Substitute Teacher came to school when the teacher was sick right but you could play but when that real teacher came yeah you better not play so I don't like substitutes or I did it you know personally but substitutes don't do you any good but the real teachers the one that does you good but in Hebrews 9 it explains Cox amount of Tabernacle and when when God in the Old Testament when he when he saw that man couldn't make it Adam's blood that what anybody says in the message Adam's blood or his sperm cannot save anybody right right the Bible said in Adam all died because he didn't even have a Saving Grace right as far as to save somebody else God had to save him I wish people could see that it's just it just well if you don't get a revelation it's I guess it is kind of Muddy or murky looking or you can't put it together but but the Bible speaks of a tabernacle God was showing how that this thing was going to evolve down through time but it was only people a shadow are a substitute of things to come let's let's read any let's start in in verse 10 maybe work our way backwards for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image in other words of the thing that God wanted because God didn't want animal blood as a sacrifice he knew it would only take his blood that could do it all right and he's the only man that could give his life right amen and have enough of the eternal life in it right to come back on you and I right right because Abraham I mean excuse me Adam did not resurrect that's right that's right bruh Adam did not say destroy this body and I'll raise it up right he didn't come to that position right right before he could have come to that position that's where Satan came in oh yeah and he put that division between God and man the enmity which is between our two ears right all right but the long having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never and the Bible is precise can never with these sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comer there into perfect though Abraham in God's eyes was perfect yeah but Abraham was not going to be in this Genesis 1 God in human flesh walking on the face of the earth a son of God Son of God by natural birth sure a person that God thought so much of that he put him in the Eternal Word of God but he also put Judas in the Eternal Word of God but he thought more of Abraham because Abraham believed right but Abraham so believed but still Abraham there's no way God had made this plan so perfect to the calmer therefore could not be perfect by any kind of other blood than human blood right it had to be even in their law that's why that that folks it's so simple if you look at it the law of redemption that we that we look at in Boaz and and Ruth it had to be a Kinsmen right Abraham didn't have a Kinsmen to die for him Abraham had a substitute a lamb a ram a turtle dove a pigeon all these things that was just uh even God come to the place where he said I'm tired of that I don't want to smell no more that smoke but just think of it that animal died in innocence right to give you a Hope anyway and it wasn't a pretty sight right I mean reading the Bible about how they had to do with it I mean all of you have seen insides of animals and having to burn them and make sacrifices and God said it was a sweet smelling savior at one time in other words that was what he wanted at that time because he had not come in his time yet to bring the Bible says many sons unto himself the Bible is very plain if you'll walk through the Bible because look for then verse 2 would they not would they not have ceased to be offered right if it made the comer they're into perfect the first time he made a sacrifice if that was the perfect sacrifice he would not have made another one for then would they not have ceased to be offered Paul would say it watch because that the worshiper wants purged that was their problem the people in the Old Testament could not get their self-purged by an animal blood right or an animal life once per should have had no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year and the Bible continues on and tells us that you know he prepared God prepared a body for him but look at verse 4. for it is not possible now there's your that's a definite sister Trudy it did not matter if they rolled in that blood or took any kind of animal done whatever they could it was not possible that the blood of bulletin of goat should take away sins so the Old Testament people whether you like it or not God said I'm not going to dwell in an unclean vessel that sacrifice in the Old Testament though it did marvelous things it did not make the comer perfect right right because there was a remembrance of sin every year when that priest took that blood and when they walked it was a it was a scene the whole place come out all of Israel got around the ark or or the the Tabernacle and that one man showing that it would take one man that one man took animal blood behind the veil and God said you've stayed my wrath for one more year but that didn't negate the next year him doing the same thing over again because there was a remembrance of sins that's what it says right here verse three in those sacrifices there's a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible is the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins foreign out here we're coming down to a man sacrificing offering now when it's not but a body has to help prepare me right now let's read what the prophet said let's read a few quotes I gave Joe a bunch but we're not going to read them all brother Joe we'll just skip through save time and Abraham restored let's know what the prophet said in 1961 to 11. he's talking about when they offered a sin offering they took a little lamb laid their hands upon it confessed their sins and they cut its throat and when the little fellow was dying kicking and bleeding while the blood got all over the hands of the worshiper and then he felt the death going out of that animal as it straightened out and died and he knowed that that animal was dying in this place but the Bible said he went out with the same desire he had when he come in that is not a son of God by New Birth because we're gonna read in a little while the same thing that that brother was quoting this morning that if the seed remains in you you can't sin because see when the that blood cell was broke that animal spirit could not come back and coincide with a human Spirit right exactly the animal has no soul so they could not come back so therefore he went out with the same conscience but when a man by faith comes lays his hand on the head of Jesus Christ and fills his suffering in other words a Calvary what does he say and when that blood cell was broke not only the life of a human being came back but the life of almighty God amen amen and makes you a son and daughter of God now that ought to settlement like brother Brown said the other day he was reading he said he said one miracle in this building ought to settle it he said we ought to not have to have any more discernment but he said human beings he said we're gonna have to have some more in other words that's what he did he said overseas one one outstanding Miracle he said that settled it he said in America you have to keep going over and over again listen sir as we would see Jesus 1964. Abraham was considered a god now see he has no problem right I have no problem with this Abraham was considered a god Elijah was a god Isaiah was a God because the word of God came to them and they were in portion Gods right Jesus said they were now you see when the man was anointed like Joseph he portrayed Christ right portrayed right if we portray Christ now we're anti christ amen yes yeah look at the difference the dispensation change from the Son of God to the son of man because he's bringing him and human flesh right now you see the man like Joseph he portrayed Christ when Moses was anointed was anointed he portrayed Christ Glory there's no problem with this when David was anointed he portrayed Christ all leading up to Christ and he was the fullness of the word amen the word was made manifest in him he was the complete anointed one they had it by portion we have it by portion he was the anointed one the entire plan of God laid in him God's listen God's plan before the foundation of the world to redeem a lost world was in Jesus Christ amen so the blood of bulls and goats never never but now listen to what brother Branham did say about Old Testament now look he's talking about them coming out of paradise now see that was another that's another thing you can look at is Paradise brother Brown said God put him in Paradise because they couldn't come before God and the condition that they were in that's Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Hall and it doesn't matter that's all the Old Testament people all right brother Brown said he said father these are those that died in good faith all right see today we can't just die in good faith Faith once delivered to the Saints now listen to this Faith once delivered to the Saints Chicago 1955 501 now we couldn't go to the Old Testament because they wasn't called Saints in the Old Testament they were Saints in the New Testament therefore we'd have to begin from the New Testament well then the New Testament was based upon Christianity which come from Christ and Christ was the first ministrator of faith that we should contend for because it was the faith that he introduced to the world that's pretty tough often Perfection let me read more perfection 1957. 419 all through the Old Testament they offered the blood of lambs and goats sheeps bulls and Heifers a substitutionary death but all in the great economy of God he said there was back in his mind the real object coming which would be them were Shadows of the real object that was to come and the real object was to come was his only begotten son all the Lambs that died was only a shadow and a shadow is only the negative side of an object and they all spoke of Calvary coming and man cannot do it in himself he's a total failure God let him see that through the law through the judges and through all the Old Testament he sent the prophet he sent the righteous man and they find out that everyone failed right right so God by his Sovereign Grace sent from the portals of Glory his only begotten son to take our place let me read one more this is good hear you him 1958 209 Moses represented the law no man can be saved by the law everything that you do legally that's legalistic you can't do nothing to save yourself it takes the grace of God to save you no matter what you do you're doing it in yourself amen nothing to do with it with it it won't be long till you'll be just like uh he said in other words that's what happens to the church that's exactly what they're done they got into all the do's and don'ts and forgot about God but do you get what I'm saying do you get what the prophet was saying right all the animal blood all the things that happened in the Old Testament was a substitutionary was a shadow are a negative of the positive that was to come amen but the negative is not a negative like a bad negative right a negative of a picture is not bad right because it develops what the picture is right all right same thing with the Old Testament it was a type or a shadow that was going to lead lead into this man coming in human flesh because had not the Old Testament come as a platform that's why the prophet said it was a typologist he typed everything back into the Old Testament right because that gives the revelation of the New Testament but the Old Testament was a shadow it showed that Abraham had characteristics of a Son of God right Isaiah had characteristics of a Son of God God could use him to the fullest but he couldn't say the soul he couldn't be a son of the son or daughter of God by birth right by birthing us into a kingdom had to have the death of a testator for The Testament to be enforced right and then we're going to read in just a minute in the in the Book of John where it says the Holy Ghost had not been given because Jesus had not been glorified so here let's back up just a minute let's take this son of God down to the son of man maybe we'll kind of carry on this maybe a little bit later but this son of God was a spirit God that's what Jehovah was right Jehovah was one that would come in a cloud he would come in a in a form or even the captain of the host even even uh the great Melchizedek was not your savior right but when that savior walked the face of the Earth Melchizedek was in that person right right and it wasn't two persons I heard somebody the other day see I said boy what makes him with a dual identity no I don't he's not schizophrenic God's got one identity right God's got one person that's right and he was the person of Jesus Christ almighty God Amen right but in Hebrews it shows us exactly that the that the even in verse 9 if you'll keep reading the lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first Old Testament all right that he may establish the second he takes away the old creation or the old part that he that come up in the evolution of God just like God evolved in six days of creation he's evolved in six thousand years or of growth coming to you and I in this end time right all right took six days now take six thousand years to bring us to a place to where he can show his fullness his full creative ability right because remember we're part of a new creation yeah that's right a new race of people right it's never been on the face of the Earth before a new race of people not saying that Abraham was not worthy right right read Hebrews 11 right the Bible says the world let's read it we got a little bit from Hebrews 11. it's just right there across the pages who got Hebrews 10. all these great people by Faith by faith through faith by faith through faith by faith through faith verse 37. they were stoned they were Sean asunder and that was Isaiah tempted slain with a sword wandered about sheepskin and goat skin being destitute Afflicted tormented it looked like a pretty terrible group of people right now but guess what of whom the world who's not even Worthy for them to be here they wandered in desert in the mountains and dens and caves of the Earth now these are the great powers of faith all of these were Old Testament people right not in New Testament in here brother it's the Old Testament amen right verse 39 says it all and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not it's a promise right the promise was that God was going to restore somebody back to an Adam condition which was a man walking around on the face of the Earth the god of the Earth with God in his soul right because that's what Adam was he was God of this Earth he was not a born-again Christian because he wasn't born but God put eternal life in his soul just like he does mine and yours sure right right amen because that's what he's saying right here the promise was in Genesis 3 15 was to restore and take away the works of the devil and put everything back to where it should be amen right right a bunch of little animals walk around but now brother Brown said a bunch of little Jesus was walking around because Jesus hadn't come yet Adam was a type but in all things Adam couldn't type Christ right he taught Christ in the way that he wanted to go out and get his wife but brother Brown said he got out of the garden he did the right thing by taking his wife but he couldn't get back in right amen why the tree of life the way had been cut off right and guess what we're standing there that light right that was in Genesis 1 3 right we're standing there and there's no way that they could get back through animal blood but when that light that's why we read John 1 when that light came to the world and became human flesh what do you say I am the way the truth in life are like right in other words I'm the way that you can get back into that amen it's just so simple it's really people if if Satan can destroy Redemption right yeah if he what he done in the Garden of Eden was he stopped Sons and Daughters of God from being born on the Earth right like God wanted them he plugged up the womb of Eve so she could not bear you and I all right and that's what he's trying to do now through the womb of your mind he's trying to pollute the womb of your mind and close it up and stop another son and daughter of God from coming forward he hasn't stopped his plan he just went at a couple of different angles now he's the best of the best listen there ain't no like you except Jesus Christ I mean ain't nobody brother Brown said don't try to outsmart him that's right because he already knows but God said I'll make a way but what the devil I don't think what the devil saw was was that God was going to hide himself right back into the thing that that he that Satan used to create the fall of Man or to cause the fall of Man God had had to come back through that to redeem it right he couldn't come around another way or Melchizedek could have done it Melchizedek could have been Our Redeemer if God hadn't said well if the wounds polluted here I've got to come back through the womb to take care of the problem going back in this direction everybody understand that God can't go wrong he won't go around something that's right that's not Redemption remember drop this on the floor set it over here that would be Melchizedek right right they say oh well he can do it he can do it this way no if you drop that you got to pick that up if I was about 20 years younger I would drop that and pick that back up and if it was sitting right here I got to put it back in the same place not just and I dropped it and picked it up and have it in my hand no no you got to put it back in the same spot now I have restored this bottle cap back to its original condition sitting right here where it was right right and that's what God did Adam couldn't do it no one could do it except himself he said this is so Elementary but this is how Satan has wove his plan in the people of the message I ain't talking about people out in the world you can't even talk to people you can't even I'm talking to somebody the other day a Baptist guy we were going to that uh funeral there of John and uh just some simple things blows their minds amen just blowing their mind you know even talking about it I can't even remember what we was talking about but I was like if you never read that in the Bible I talked about some doctrinal issue I don't know about just something that happened in the life of Jesus or the life of John or the life of somebody and it just blows their brain oh yes and here we are but you know why because their wounds been cut off Eve can only go so far and when that wound got polluted God couldn't come through that he won't come through an unclean vessel that's what I stopped him right there in the garden but he said I'll come back as a seed of the woman well where did he have to go the seat of the woman was not Melchizedek because he wasn't born from a woman right a seat of the woman had to come through a womb through creative through creation and come right back through the creation brother random said the Creator become the creation that's the only way you can take us back brother then he couldn't just come and be formed on a rock or come down from glory and just say here I am I've come to save the world that wasn't God's plan God's plan was he said I'm going to live just like you are amen amen I told somebody the other day I said it's a hard thing and that's what I was telling somebody I said you know every once in a while and God forgive me but this is what I do I just kind of take the Holy Ghost and set him over on the Shelf somewhere and I kind of think Carnival all right we got this God that don't need anybody think women here just you know don't just think human we're just thinking human here's this here's this being that that creates worlds not just speaking he does not need air to breathe he does not need my help or your help he does not need anything he's self-existing eternal nothing's going to stop him from being eternal but he decides to start creating a world and he decides to start creating people to live on that world knowing they would fall knowing he'd have to come right down here get in a body of Flesh born a baby give his life and then get somebody to believe that that's pretty unbelievable all right amen that's why we got the Believers that's why we really got to be Believers right because this story is unbelievable how that this God that don't need nobody he don't need nothing to exist but yeah this is what he saw and this is what he wanted amen right that's unbelievable in our human brain I mean just think just take your own selfish self and just that you needed nothing sister Anna you needed you didn't need nobody you can just go creative we're gonna go sit there and live for an eternity and not even not even grow old amen right right but have a thought in your mind that you want to be a daddy you want to have fellowship with somebody you won't have somebody to talk to you you want to have something to to to relate to and hear this God says okay I'll let all this happen because the glorification of Jesus in this chapter of John was in John chapter 17. and in John chapter 17 he talks more of me and you than he does himself he should glorify me father with the glory that we have what Glory did he have before the foundation of the world what we're talking about here he had us in his mind and had to get away to get us out so we had to let all this happen we're not going to get done now I thought we were gonna have time all right listen but God wouldn't dwell in anything unclean so the Old Testament nothing could do away with sin it just pushed it back to Calvary and heaped it up on to a man that came in human flesh now listen that Son of God was a spirit God that when we talk about Spirit we think of uh you know like Casper the Friendly Ghost really that's what we think of but that Son of God was more real than anything we ever knew or no or or or have any uh comprehension of right all right so let's just don't think that God evolved from a spirit down to a human being I don't I think he was pretty human before he started because he said let us create man in our image right and in our likeness and what we become human beings all right so here we have a man that will talk about doing this but the life that was in the blood of those animals couldn't clean them up but there was one coming that could live the life show us how to live the life and then begin our or bring many sons unto himself like I said Melchizedek couldn't do any ones in our Kinsmen Kinsmen had to be Ruth could not get someone that was not kin to her right Naomi there was no way that that anybody else could do it except family he wasn't done any good if the mayor of the city would have walked out there if he was not kin to Naomi you want another no good he could not have restored back to her what Boaz did but Boaz could do it because they were in line of the family they were in the family line all right same way with you and I now that's not to say that the people in the Old Testament was not in the economy of God but they were not the family of God there's a difference they're in the economy of God but not the family of God the family of God God had one purpose and that was for me and you to come forth now how to explain that to to not trying to belittle the Old Testament I guess I don't have words to do that but just one thing's for sure those people in the Old Testament did not have a birth like you and I have as far as spiritual birth so they couldn't be a Son of God in the line of the family right family lineage that's right he called Abraham a friend of God not remember the Bible says he's a friend in the economy of God I believe that we're going to have some friends with us in eternity but we're going to live with the family amen that city is only going to have family right that Millennium is going to have family and friends maybe the the Jews but that future home inside that City wall thing but one group of people gonna live in that city right and that's family members now you say Abraham Isaac and Jacob whatever that tells you that they're the pillows and they're the foundation and they're the parts of the wall but they didn't say they were part of the city right right you and I are the only part of that City let's go to Hebrews two you love the Lord amen amen I do I love you more every day but can you say like the one that said though God slay me and I'll trust him right yes thank you Hebrews 2 verse 6. but wanting a certain place testifies saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visiteth him thou amazed him a little lower than the angels and here we're coming down to Jesus Christ I think we all understand that this man that was born that was born a baby was almighty God I hope we don't have to go over that part the latest him a little lower than the angels that crownest him with glory and honor and did it over the works of thy hand I thou has put all things in subjection under his feet so it must have been human him his feet for him that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him right who are we talking about son of man but now we see not yet all things put under him what because all of them will still have we were still having but we see Jesus it was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he made by the grace of God should taste deaf for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifies and they who are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren amen right join Ayers Roman said we're heirs and join heirs whatever he has joint means thank you the same now here we've got the son of man walking on the face of the Earth and what's in this son of man the Son of God right Spirit man has taken on human flesh right and now now Jehovah God is known up in the cloud somewhere waiting on somebody to bring him a sacrifice of an animal to try to push the sand back but not do away with it here's a man that comes on the earth that can do what he said he was going to do in Genesis 3. he come through the womb of a woman he come to do what bruised the Serpent's head all right he come through the womb the son of man but what did the son of man do the son of man yielded to the one that was inside of it that's right okay that's important because the son of man was not listen to this son of man was not the controlling Factor the Son of God was the controlling Factor anybody got that Son of God was one that did the controlling I'm making some sense because you know what we gotta do the same thing all right now just a few minutes the outside man you were looking at the son of man was the sacrifice the Son of God is the one that went down and paid the price right he said he gave the stolen Ransom in Isaiah 53 so that he could see what his seed which is who who is my seed Josh and Hannah because they what they came from me so for in other words for God to see his children brother Howard he had to go to hell for us amen he had to take this thing of death he had to take every sin we'd ever permit every sin we'd ever commit are going to commit and he took him to hell and when he kicked Satan into that pit and took the keys he kicked minding your sins and they're with him came back out and he didn't go back up in a fog he came back up and picked that body back up oh Lord he picked that sacrifice back up because now it was worthy right right that body thou has prepared me like we preached a little while ago you and I have got to see that being an offspring of God so your Mom and Daddy brought this thing you're looking at God took possession of it when he gave you the new birth he took possession of his sister to your mama and daddy natural if you're born again today your natural mom and dad didn't have anything to do with your being here all right hang on yeah I know they did look at I mean you see you see me but you understand when we give ourselves over when when a wife gives herself over to a man she don't just give him her hand right hello somebody you don't just get that one out now now you can you can touch my hair now husband you can touch my hair but leave the rest of me alone yeah I know I thought we gave our whole self right over to our husband so that he could what be the controlling Factor and that's our problem people we haven't give ourselves over you might be married that's right but you have not give yourself completely over and let Christ be your head because of whatever we can preach on that for another hour but they listen to the point I'm trying to make when God began he knew it would take blood so he let that substitutionary blood be the negative part where that we would learn right we would know that that's what God started he did not want that to begin with but until he got here to release that life he had to be a Kinsman first he had to come in human flesh to even get to us that's right that's right just to get to us he had to come into human flesh that's what I said Melchizedek couldn't do it for us people that's all right come on the one inside of Melchizedek did but Melchizedek himself could not be our savior though we did what though he showed the signs of Messiah he could not die for Abraham or any of us amen God had to come through the womb be the son of man with the Son of God inside of that son of man not being two separate people right good grief we have trouble I believe Jesus would have had a lot of trouble if he would have been warring this way and God this way he wouldn't have been almighty God because I believe he said somewhere he said I only do that which the father shows me now he said I only now I don't think like Dave was saying this morning so I was thinking this morning about some human things now the human things of Jesus I don't think that he you know God said eat you know the warning signs eight no he was a human being when he got hungry God put that in motion before you know when he put man in human flesh so when he said only do that the father shows me he's not like this turn left no he just walked about his daily duties but he was subject to the one that was inside of him and don't tell me that the devil didn't talk to him daily hourly weekly monthly and every minute that he could yeah and don't think we're gonna be any different that's what I'm trying to say is this great Son of God that that couldn't he couldn't give the people in the Old Testament the new birth because he hadn't come to release that life yet but now that he has read the New Testament the New Testament speaks of me and you it shows a shadow of what they did in the Old Testament but the death of the testator brought a new life or a new creation like in Genesis 3 I mean revelation 3. that's preached on it many times Brother Rich you know this is the beginning he was the beginning of the real creation of God not the physical creation physical creation was finished when we read it in Genesis one right all those things were set into motion but he wanted a manner why why would God put that in Revelations 3 that in this end time that's what he wanted if he would have wanted it that way in the Old Testament he'd put it back in Genesis he said oh this is the beginning of the creation of God he didn't put that in there because that wasn't what God all wanted all it's not that I think what sometimes when you tell people that there was no sons of our daughters of God in the Old Testament that's belittling somebody that's not belittling they're the Warriors of Faith Hebrews 11 proves that the world was not even worthy for them to be him but they don't have the position that you and I have they're not Sons and Daughters of God by birth they would do things wrong and and and David would go out and and my gosh have his best friend killed yeah commit adultery and then repent and God and then make a sacrifice and God said I'll accept that because he knew if David had the new birth he wouldn't have done what he did but in the economy of God the Old Testament had to build a platform for that man called Jesus to step out on all those Old Testament prophets of Peace here a piece there I read it Elijah was part of God part of Christ portrayed portrayed portray you and I don't if we like I said before this is where I'm ending up to if we come to the part of where we act like the people in the Old Testament then we know we're not born again as far as the things that they did wrong all right and if we come up to a place to where we can't come to a place of repentance then the blood of Jesus Christ what the Bible say the Bloods were not a fact it's no it's not a fact you come to a place where there's not even sacrifice for the things that you do okay what a terrible place but this substitute blood come over to a man that could do what he said he was going to do he said destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up three days I'll come back and not just be with you I'm going to be in you right amen I in you and you and me what a family and like brother Brown said he made a quote the other day and I started to bring it and I forgot it but he said Satan you know he's just a bluff right see he's bluffed them in the Old Testament see Bluff in the New Testaments he's bluffing us now he said but God has now give us the stuff no he said the stuff to take care of the bluff that's what the quote is he said he give look it up in your computer he gave us the stuff to take care of the bluff and that's what he's given us in the end time the stuff to take care of the Bluffs let's read this right here and then God come back in the independent let's turn first John two I'll read you a few quotes here thank you you come back on the day of Pentecost is what start having children because he couldn't have children in the Old Testament because the womb of Eve had been what closed up right so no Sons and Daughters of God could be born in the Old Testament like God wanted it right because the woman was polluted but when he came through the womb now he just it just it didn't clean Mary's natural wound let's get that straight it didn't clean her natural womb she had to go to Pentecost and have her spiritual wound clean amen that's right we ain't talking about the ones of a man anymore we're talking about the spoken word of God because he promised that that's why I said in Genesis 3 if you'll pick that scripture apart I see of a woman a woman don't have a seat so how did it have to come and she didn't know a man I'd have had it come creation spoken word had to come through the spoken word listen lamb singing Church age no I'm sorry let's read power transformation 1965 1031. Talk About Eve and corrupting that seed with a corruptable seed before it could get there to corrupt that beautiful Garden of Eden or only thing that he is is just restoration where we are now we're on our road back to that original beginning of the creation of God back to the Garden of Eden again husband and wife without any sin or anything to live Eternal live a sin Church age you talking about he's standing in the midst of the church and he's standing there revealing who is he in this last stage he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church now let's go down and save time there you can see that though man was of the old order of creation Now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God Ephesians 2 and 10. is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh see that's what he done by the ways of the flesh he fell now God had to come back through flesh but through flesh through the fleshly tables of our heart he's bringing Sons and Daughters back to himself not to the loins of a man anymore not through natural sectac not through any of that it's on spoken word spoken word seed of God all right that makes that's why we all be virgins right okay virgins to God it's another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that's how he dealt with Israel Old Testament he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue through the god of the Isaac line but now out of every Kindred driving Nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man Now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of God glory now I say to any of those uh people are on the internet that that can't understand why the um there was no sons of God like they are now in the old in the New Testament in the Old Testament let me read that again this is the true revelation of God the true revelation of God is and he wanted sons and daughters just like he wanted him in the New Testament they weren't in the old sorry I'm sorry they were not couldn't be the testator hadn't died yet read John when first John 2 right there run at Hebrew the book of Hebrews is a real powerful um chapter of scripture but I like the little Johns because he talks about us well he already saw us in the in the church ages so he knew what we were going to do he had the end of the book two verse 22. who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ and he is Antichrist that denies the father and the son whosoever denies the son the same hath not the father but he that acknowledged the son had the father also go to 3-1 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not what the sign still don't know they think it's three separate people but if you know the father you know who the son is you and I we shouldn't know if we talk about the father we should know who the son is not as a separate Identity or a separate person beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when we shall appear when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure now let's go to John seven not first John John 7. verse 37. in the last days that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried out saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink and he didn't believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this fake he of the spirit in other words what the commentator John is telling you that's not going to happen right then it's not gonna happen right then exactly but it's going to happen when when this Holy Ghost has come right but this because remember see it's in parentheses what's John doing he's like uh dad said he's interpolating what Jesus was saying it wasn't the spirit wasn't going to come right then but it was going to come after the day of Pentecost but this Faith Hill of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified right and we don't have time to read it but this was something I wrote down Jesus's glorification was to bring four Sons and daughters of God not something like him like him Bill to be like God is to be the devil oh think about that right that's what he's saying yeah so the Old Testament prophets couldn't even come close but yet they are foundations of what we walk on we don't do away with the old testimony I was not doing away with the Old Testament but I was showing that how that listen to this let me read this godhead explained in 1961. now there that blood cell was broke now when they we lay our hands by faith on the trembling Lamb of God fill his flesh clearing and shaking for us our hands become bathed with his blood and our souls the life that was in him wasn't just a mere man neither wasn't an animal it was God so that life comes back upon the Sanctified one and becomes the son or daughter of God and offspring of God see the life of God and we are Sons and Daughters of God through the breaking of that blood cell Jesus Christ now what is it then God is back in his people fellowshipping like he did in the Garden of Eden right there you are Sons and Daughters isn't it beautiful right that's what he wanted I think we have this problem that we think we can't get back well we can't but if we got the one it can inside of us amen that's what I said no problem when God redeems your soul sister he got your body too he took possession amen right right he took possession of his Earth he sure as well gonna take possession of your Earth and their sons and daughters of God not like God but God in another form called a bride the filing morphe the last thing you're ever going to see of God glory let me read you one more I put it up and I'm going to read one morning we'll be finished all right be Not Afraid 1961 listen to this that spirit that comes out of there comes into the human spirit and makes him a son and daughter of God Amen that's the new birth that's the gospel if I know anything about it the cell that was in there God created himself with his own self he come down a little baby Jehovah and was born unstable over a manure and it ought to be striking to the people of Jehovah lying in the stable and we think we're somebody Jehovah planning his child listen Jehovah then raised up he proved he was Jehovah sure he was yes sir John knew him about who he was it's God working his way back into man and that's when he started with in the Old Testament let's stand he started in the Old Testament Testament beginning to work his way back right but he couldn't get back because the wound was polluted and there was no way to make that womb clean again other than coming back into it right then when he come back into it then when that man came the the blood cell broke the life that was in that blood could come back in The Believer the animal I've couldn't didn't have soul right then that life could come back into me and you and if they took my blood and did a DNA check they'd find out Josh was my son if I did a blood test on him same thing with God Amen because when we accept that blood like brother Brown said he said you could have the blood and you hang it he said but it's the acceptance of the life that was in that blood not the chemistry not the not the oh it'd be great to have it but Adolf Hitler could have held it in his hand and been just the worst sinner in the world he probably would have made it worse trying to sell it make millions of dollars off of it but you and I would cherish you but still that didn't do any good until we accepted the life that was in that blood that he could come back and clean me and you up there we come back to that believing part you must believe in something you've never seen that's right something that's so eternal and so pure and so holy but you've never seen it before you never seen that literal blood you've never seen that literal life the only way you see that life is through when I told you when you shook each other's hand that's what you see the lights now and that's why God said he said the world will not see me anymore that's why because I'm gonna hide myself in my children amen and all down through the church ages that's what he did he hid himself inside of a group of people just a hodgepodge group of people that the world the Bible says wasn't even worthy with the Old Testament ones and hey they did the same thing to the New Testament ones in the in the Dark Ages they tied them up they pulled them apart they cut their guts out they let the babies be eaten by Hogs same thing happened in the Old Testament happened more in the New Testament because the devil knew then he was fighting a God that was in a group of people like brother Harris always said he said if God if Satan would have left Jesus alone he'd only had to fought one right now when he came back in a group of people the first day with 120. then that afternoon it was 3 000 little Jesus isn't it's been growing ever since God has God has hid himself the way he wanted to be right and that's inside of me and you and people don't know what to do about it because he sees the plan he knows the plan but he tries to pervert the plan right and to pervert the plan see he tries to get us off on this doctor and get us off on this tries to get this to happen even drop that and lay it over here because see that's not full restoration right this is for restoration putting right back where it started what brother Branham did during the dark during all the ages see man could get us maybe to him yeah Loose Ends right things we couldn't see policy we don't see all things but when brother Brown came to bring a truth back he showed us that it's right there is where he goes right that was the Loose Ends that kept people dying this keeps people from dying when you come back to the same because Adam wasn't dying before the fall Adam was not dying right he was not dying before the fall this world was not dying before the fall this world was perfect let's take a song the Avenue 272 in the spiral book by the woman that passed away I were singing towards things that could not satisfy thank you and I heard my concern the Lord there are millions in this world all kind of things to do except the desire that God give them a God I lift it up this Thursday that's what's happened right there this world don't leave a hunger but God will leave one amen if you need to hear me I lived here I want here's my God make me home amen I like that song fill my cup and even if you feel my cup Lord my saucer and my plate right my table and make a mess this is a man of the man I love you before camera favorite you're a comfort able here's what he does he leaves me and he guides me laying inside me Holy Spirit you're a comfort to me you know you wonder brother I heard him the other day talking about how that Fanny Crosby and some of those ones that the great composers that God would come on him with an anointing and when they come off of him like uh one of them that committed suicide and one they always they couldn't handle it well you'd think that the old testament's probably the same way uh look at um Jonah Jonah went and converted a city of 200 000 people even to where they put ashes on their animals they wanted even their animals to be saved but brother Brown said when that anointing left him said he went up on the hill sat down and cried forgot to kill him right that's right why he could feel that anointing that's right and then when that thing left there was nothing to stay inside of him it's just a girl there was nothing there was no just like what we were singing about the Holy Spirit in your comfort to me when it left them it was just the same old person that was there there was nothing to clean them up but now you and I we can enjoy that anointing that comes down on on us when we're driving or or praying or are singing in the car and then when that leaves guess what he said I'll never leave you that's right not forsake it so he didn't go far and he still right that's one thing he can't do he can't take this out of you once he puts it in you and he takes that whole vessel that's where people's missed it even in this man this mess they're missing it when God redeems that Soul he redeemed that whole entire vessel Glory he didn't just redeem a little back of the Earth right he said it would be a redeemed entire Earth that that future home is going to set on right well who's going to sit in that future home we are that's my giant Soul the city coming down and he said it looked like a bride adorned for a husband why was it because it was the bride right when the city of Lula has a um has a festival and has a parade the paper says the whole city of Louisville come out right well that don't mean all the buildings come out and got next to the road what it happened the people right came out of the building and went down the road and never sent the whole city came out to see it so who's what's the city cities the people that's what God wanted man he wanted the Garden of Eden to be the future home but what happened in the garden showed more of his love than for that just to happen so he let all this happen to show his salvation his healing and and all the great things we thank you much more now than we would if we were just made a bunch of cookie cutter people just you know that's right stamp you know this one everybody was the same you know that's not what God wanted guys have got a variety right and he loves all of you have a good week and give thanks to God Amen you can thank everybody in the world but give thanks to God he's the one that puts you here yes and he's one that taught you he's the one that will never leave you bro right he's not going to leave you he's gonna take that little man right into eternity and that little man is going to look just like that right there he thought so much of that man he made it just like everybody amen remember brother Robin said he took this one and this one right this one to this one this one to this one so he could bring that character character called Ray Gabriel that character right there that's the character that God wanted to see amen God wanted to see the character in each one of us but listen people if you don't got God inside of you you act like the character of God all you wanted but if you got the one inside he loves you making all right but he's not gonna mold you into something short if you're tall or something you know blonde headed if you're black-headed no he likes that he likes that form just like it is what's he doing he's just cleaning it off all right this is the polishing time people it's been rough down Through the Ages this is the time God's taking that little bitty sandpaper he just he's rubbing the rough edges off and getting us in shape to get out of here you're not the Lord and uh just give thanks for us dear heavenly father we pray Lord that you just take us through this next week coming up Lord anything that comes our way Lord we know that you've already supplied the things that we need the the armor you you've never lost a battle Lord what a great I know that Patton and some of the ones in the in on the earth were great warriors but there was battles that they lost but Lord we're in an army that has a commander that's never been defeated he knows all the tactics of the enemy before the enemy begins to move and Lord I pray that each one of us will take those things that you give us Lord the the greatest playbook in the world the Bible that we can see the play acting out is it actually before it even happens but Lord it takes a belief it takes us to believe Who We Are and believe that you wrote this Bible for us Lord is a map is a road map and as a love letter to your bride and there in the end time lord we're coming down to the end of the race there's no other race to be run Lord we'll lay down our Bibles one day and put to sort up and go home to Glory that's not another there's not another group to come up not another platoon Lord this is the last battle this is the last fight this is the last victory Lord is you living in a group of human beings just like you wanted to in the Garden of Eden father be with each one forgive us of our sins be with each one on their Highway way home that you'll Grant Lord peace to each one that In the Still of the Night it's the storm rages father that you'll come down and and take the fair away father because fear is just something that Satan uses to to try to get us nervous and all upset Lord but like we said before and let's just remember that you've never lost a battle you've never lost a son and daughter of God we may have sons and daughters that go out in the world do things and we seem like we lose them but father you never lost a son or daughter of God because where you're all for Offspring father and we we have your genetics we have your makeup and we pray in our father that you'll go with us take care of us lead us in guide us by your Holy Spirit till we come back Wednesday night Lord in Jesus name we pray amen hear this message okay
