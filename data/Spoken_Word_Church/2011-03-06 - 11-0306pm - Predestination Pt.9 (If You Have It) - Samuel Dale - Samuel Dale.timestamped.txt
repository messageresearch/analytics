[28:45] open truly the eyes of our understanding
[28:48] to the revealed word in Jesus name amen
[28:54] Ephesians 1
[28:58] . now we were talking about this last
[29:00] night you know I think sister Trudy
[29:03] mentioned it and see Ephesians 1 I keep
[29:07] reading basically not all of it but do
[29:10] it but to me this is an entire Bible in
[29:12] its own in other words if you want to
[29:14] know what the Bible talking about read
[29:15] Ephesians 1. it covers everything from
[29:18] the new birth to chosen in him adoption
[29:21] the change everything is right there in
[29:23] Ephesians 1. so if you want to just keep
[29:26] reading over it and over and over it
[29:27] really helps me too anyway you know to
[29:30] read it so let's start with verse three
[29:33] they should be the God and father of our
[29:35] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[29:37] with all with all spiritual blessings in
[29:40] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[29:43] he has chosen Us in him before the
[29:44] foundation of the world that we should
[29:46] be holding Without Blame before him in
[29:48] love
[29:49] having predestinated us unto the
[29:51] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[29:54] himself according to the good pleasure
[29:56] of his will
[29:58] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[30:00] wherein he hath made us accepted we're
[30:03] at in the Beloved in whom we have
[30:05] Redemption through his blood the
[30:07] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[30:09] riches of his grace wherein he had to
[30:12] bound it toward us in all wisdom and
[30:13] Prudence having made known unto us the
[30:16] mystery of his will or to adopt us to to
[30:19] finish this whole thing up seeing this
[30:21] day according to his good pleasure which
[30:24] he had purposed in himself that in the
[30:26] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[30:28] might gather together in one all things
[30:31] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[30:33] which are on earth even in him in whom
[30:37] also we have obtained an inheritance
[30:39] being predestinated according to the
[30:41] purpose of him who worketh all things
[30:43] after the counsel of his own will
[30:45] that we should be to the praise of his
[30:47] glory who first trusted
[30:49] in Christ you may be seated the Lord
[30:52] that is blessing to the reading of his
[30:56] word
[30:57] now if you would I'd like for you to
[30:59] turn with me to
[31:01] um let's go to John
[31:03] 6 first
[31:08] just read you know a few scriptures and
[31:10] then get into our thoughts
[31:13] John 6
[31:18] verse 66.
[31:23] then Simon Peter answered him Lord
[31:27] to whom shall we go brother random says
[31:30] in other words three things three kind
[31:31] of Believers he said unto and in verse
[31:33] 67 when you go out will you go will ye
[31:37] also go away
[31:39] but around the city in other words he
[31:41] was saying
[31:42] said do you wish to go away
[31:47] do you wish to go away
[31:49] you know then Simon Peter answered him
[31:52] Lord to whom shall we go
[31:55] for thou Hast the words
[31:57] of eternal life
[32:00] and you believe and are sure that dot
[32:02] and we believe and are sure that thou
[32:04] art that Christ
[32:06] the son of the Living God okay go to
[32:10] John
[32:11] 10 verse 28.
[32:14] now watch these scriptures now
[32:19] and we know what it is we're talking
[32:20] about my sheep verse 27 hear my voice
[32:23] and I know them and they follow me and I
[32:25] give unto them eternal life
[32:28] and they shall never neither perish
[32:31] she'll never perish neither Shield any
[32:34] man pluck them out of my hand all right
[32:36] going over now to John 17.
[32:43] in verse
[32:44] 1 through
[32:47] 3.
[32:49] these words spank Jesus and lifted up
[32:52] his eyes to heaven and said father the
[32:54] hour has come glorify thy son that thy
[32:57] son also shall make glorified thee
[33:00] as thou has given him power no
[33:04] give it to the son power
[33:07] Over All Flesh
[33:09] that he should give and watch
[33:12] not if they had it and he can tell them
[33:14] that that he should give
[33:17] eternal life
[33:18] to as many as thou has given him
[33:22] right now they're not given to him you
[33:24] know remember the scripture uh no man
[33:27] can come unless the father drawing
[33:29] and this is eternal life now I wrote my
[33:32] Bible a long time ago what is eternal
[33:34] life
[33:38] that's what I wrote in my Bible many
[33:39] years ago what is eternal life verse 3
[33:41] and this is eternal life
[33:46] Thee the only true God in Jesus Christ
[33:50] whom thou has sent
[33:53] that you may know not think about it and
[33:56] guess about it that word no is a
[33:58] wonderful word it's like it is in the
[34:00] Book of Job of job where he says I know
[34:03] my redeemer liveth
[34:05] it's a positive statement it's not even
[34:08] a question or point or nothing it's
[34:11] positive I know
[34:13] I know in whom I believe
[34:16] see all right so then you know
[34:19] eternal life
[34:22] can only come
[34:24] by Jesus Christ amen it is not because
[34:27] you and I are so good-goody people and
[34:30] and all of this that of the other that's
[34:32] right it's not on our merits it's on the
[34:35] basis of what he said all right now it's
[34:38] not to back up much but to review just a
[34:41] little bit of what we were talking about
[34:43] this morning
[34:44] and I told brother Joe to go ahead and
[34:46] title that what is the seed of God
[34:49] because that's what I want you to look
[34:52] at you know I did this morning what is
[34:54] the seed of God is it uh some kind of
[34:57] something that you got to put a spot
[34:58] well I was born with this seed in me
[35:01] what was it where was it amen
[35:04] I don't know I just believe the prophet
[35:06] well all right
[35:08] so do we all amen but remember Judas was
[35:12] there with him right you say yeah but
[35:14] I'm chosen but remember Judas was too
[35:19] that's right Judas had
[35:23] said if you've got
[35:25] he had part of the ministry he cast out
[35:27] Devils he was sick
[35:31] we better consider all right let's see
[35:33] what is the seed of God it's the word of
[35:35] God Amen well then it was it a word
[35:38] written down inside of you as I said
[35:40] tattooed inside of your soul somewhere
[35:42] or what was it or was it simply like the
[35:46] little woman
[35:48] that she had the germ of life she had
[35:50] heard and she believed that the Messiah
[35:54] would someday come
[35:56] back and she believed that but when he
[36:00] came that was what
[36:01] you know was quick under made alive
[36:03] right there but now remember what we
[36:05] were trying to bring out this morning
[36:06] and you know
[36:08] did that give her eternal life
[36:11] the prophet said the word Was Made Alive
[36:13] right there amen
[36:15] but did that give her eternal life
[36:20] another woman that touched the Hem of
[36:22] His Garment see she was healed did that
[36:25] give her eternal life and all the
[36:27] prophet said it was faith for the time
[36:30] because that's all those people back
[36:32] there could have right right David could
[36:34] kill a bear a lion and a giant and then
[36:36] say well Gloria come on anybody else
[36:38] because you know
[36:39] God has anointed me
[36:42] right
[36:42] and he knew it see and that was what I
[36:46] tried to get to point across
[36:47] see then the germ of life
[36:50] would be that that God foreknew right
[36:56] that you would receive
[37:00] when you came here
[37:02] all right but like I said about the
[37:04] little one like I said about Peter Peter
[37:07] emphatically stated
[37:09] by the Holy Spirit Thou Art the Christ
[37:12] the son of the Living God but that
[37:14] didn't give him eternal life
[37:19] he had to wait till the death Pentecost
[37:21] but you see that's where we don't take
[37:24] things that I say and and break it down
[37:26] and look at it and take the the law of
[37:30] just dividing something until you see
[37:32] what's right
[37:34] you know if you were if you were taking
[37:36] a uh
[37:37] test today and it was a multiple choice
[37:40] well on the multiple choices I always
[37:43] say like four answers right and and on
[37:46] that there's always two of them that is
[37:48] so so out of thought until you just mark
[37:52] them two off
[37:54] and you're not dealing that's what a lot
[37:56] of people do though because they'll sit
[37:57] down there you know instead of just
[37:58] going down and looking at it and there's
[38:00] a question
[38:01] I don't work I don't work now to stream
[38:03] them too A lot of people they'll get
[38:05] that question number one well let's see
[38:08] maybe it's possible that could be true
[38:10] matter while the teacher says well who's
[38:12] answered all the questions I ain't got
[38:13] number one yet
[38:14] or maybe it could be true
[38:17] you hadn't taken a just an X Out the
[38:20] ones that's no good right you know and
[38:23] then you're only doing with two then you
[38:25] can just there's nothing else you can
[38:26] take a chance like I used to do and
[38:29] every other one is always true
[38:31] you got bound to hit it somewhere you
[38:34] know but but see if we don't do that we
[38:37] try to figure out anything
[38:39] stop trying to figure it out just accept
[38:41] what God Said Amen I haven't figured out
[38:44] yet what he saved me for right if you
[38:47] figured out what God saved you for
[38:52] so you just don't worry about it they
[38:54] just let it go all right let's see the
[38:56] little woman she had representation from
[38:59] predestination God knew she would hear
[39:02] the word and she would believe it above
[39:06] Five Season the things the religious
[39:08] people right and therefore he could come
[39:11] to that that was the seed of God
[39:14] that was what was in her
[39:16] not some form of some kind of seed stuck
[39:19] down in there you know go to remember
[39:21] how I was trying to bring it out now
[39:22] because science can't find the germ of
[39:24] life
[39:25] right
[39:27] well if they can't find a germ of Life
[39:29] how are you going to find a germ of
[39:31] eternal life
[39:33] I'm certainly not playing around the
[39:35] bean field
[39:36] but listen but God's foreknowledge
[39:40] he would look down through
[39:43] and he'd see that you wanted it so he
[39:45] had it there for you right
[39:47] but now he'd see that you wanted it
[39:50] now we got to move on see we've tried to
[39:52] cover something but we got to move on in
[39:54] the message to get some points and today
[39:57] I want to get something out of the way I
[39:59] know I've got a lot of quotes and things
[40:00] but I want to get something out of the
[40:02] way that should give us a you know a uh
[40:07] a thought and and take away some things
[40:11] and be able to uh walk on with what
[40:15] we're doing all right now but we read
[40:18] there
[40:21] he said I give him eternal life
[40:25] well if God's going to give you eternal
[40:27] life
[40:28] all right as I said this morning there's
[40:30] one thing for sure there's two things
[40:32] are right first he's going to give it to
[40:34] you
[40:35] that's his promise number two issue
[40:38] didn't happen that's right
[40:40] if I come into the world eternal life
[40:42] I've got one to Prophet said and you
[40:44] ain't going to get me to deny that
[40:47] I faced them before and about just none
[40:49] of them through there you know you can't
[40:51] get me to deny that Trinity because if I
[40:54] deny the father I've denied the son
[40:59] and they were kind of quote scripture to
[41:01] you like that
[41:04] just quoting it wrong right exactly yeah
[41:07] but they'll bring it to you that way
[41:09] because that's the carnality of man's
[41:11] kind all right but now listen
[41:14] when you're dealing with the
[41:17] word of God
[41:19] you see how vital it is
[41:22] for the word to be planted peering
[41:25] unadulterated
[41:29] come then we covered a message there I'm
[41:31] talking about it in non seed there is
[41:34] nothing to Quicken
[41:36] all right now non-seed is we know that
[41:41] it's it's it has no life in it right but
[41:45] in the Bible
[41:47] the
[41:49] of talking about the word
[41:51] those Pharisees
[41:54] knew the letter of the word perfect
[41:58] they could tell you everything that it
[42:01] said
[42:03] but when they face the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:06] they proved that they were none seed
[42:09] right there was nothing in them to
[42:11] Quicken right he said but brother Daley
[42:14] had all the words
[42:16] yeah and they could tell you all of the
[42:18] great Parables and all of the great
[42:20] things that went on they could show you
[42:23] everything go find you a good Jew now he
[42:25] can really explain or expound upon the
[42:28] word if you hadn't listened to anybody
[42:30] listen to that Rabbi Richmond come look
[42:32] at brother biscals a lot he can make it
[42:34] look so beautiful out of the scriptures
[42:36] let's see dead to the reality that's
[42:40] none seed when you're talking about
[42:42] Christians
[42:44] when you're dealing with the Christian
[42:46] realm when you're dealing in the
[42:47] religious realm I'd better say instead
[42:50] of Christian then the religious realm
[42:52] when you're dealing with it you're
[42:54] dealing with people that know the letter
[42:58] but yet if they don't have that germ of
[43:01] Life those Pharisees knew the letter
[43:03] that's right but they called Jesus
[43:05] Belgium all right
[43:07] the prostitute
[43:10] and only just a little bit that maybe
[43:12] she knew I know the prophet said she
[43:13] knew the the the message or the Bible
[43:18] but still she didn't know it like the
[43:20] fire season yet
[43:22] but yet there was a connection there
[43:25] that she had that germ of life
[43:28] that representation gotten you all he
[43:30] had to do was just blend there one of
[43:33] these days we'll get back to these to
[43:35] the gifts of the ministry and the
[43:36] five-fold ministry how they come
[43:38] predestinated eternally now not the guy
[43:41] see him right you know but the gifts
[43:43] because see that way
[43:45] God sent somebody by to find you
[43:49] never said he sent them by because he
[43:53] knew what it would take to contact you
[43:55] right right all right so you know like
[43:58] brother dick says if if I would have
[43:59] come along to him
[44:01] expounding all of the great things maybe
[44:04] of doing or whatever or you know
[44:06] handling him to death about something
[44:08] then he probably wouldn't accept it
[44:10] would I say it that's right that's the
[44:13] way I was with brother mode if he'd come
[44:14] forward like a lot of people in this
[44:15] message say they introduced the message
[44:17] I wouldn't have never accepted it
[44:20] but when I asked him to put it in the
[44:22] word
[44:23] right
[44:25] so then that gift worked
[44:28] brother Ryan says if you've got a
[44:31] question in your heart he said God's
[44:33] obligated he said he'll put somebody on
[44:35] the platform to answer that question now
[44:38] it may not be a true child I told you
[44:41] about the way that I I learned that we
[44:43] had to get back or I had to get baptized
[44:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I went
[44:46] through a Baptist preacher come in and
[44:47] preach all you do in word indeed do all
[44:49] in the name of Jesus Christ and that's
[44:51] the way I learned it and he wasn't a
[44:53] believer in this match
[44:55] but I've been caught sick
[45:02] hey they come out there praying in Jesus
[45:04] name I come out of their head to the
[45:06] creek you know because I knew what I had
[45:08] to do but see now watch my point
[45:12] God at one time according to acts 17 29
[45:16] and 30 right through there he said that
[45:18] there was a time that he winked at her
[45:19] ignorance that's right all right down
[45:22] through the times that that they were
[45:24] not you know it was not uh time for the
[45:27] word
[45:28] he would wink at or ignorance about
[45:30] things in other words he
[45:32] we could believe a trinity and still be
[45:34] a Christian
[45:35] there was a time you could be as
[45:37] trinitary and as good and believed in
[45:39] three literal gods
[45:42] and still be a Christian
[45:46] because that was a day in the hour
[45:47] because we were not responsible
[45:50] but now he commands everybody to repent
[45:53] all right so we got to walk in the truth
[45:56] okay so now watch then then the word has
[45:59] to be planted
[46:00] the message then of the prophet of God
[46:03] it took God
[46:05] to you know it took a special person to
[46:08] bring the message that this Prophet
[46:09] brought
[46:10] he brought us the message of God I
[46:13] believe pure and unadulterated and I
[46:15] believe he Vindicated it to be that all
[46:17] right but now you know yourself that
[46:19] there's a lot of
[46:23] places that seemingly the prophet is
[46:26] contrary one to the other in his
[46:29] statements in his doings and you know it
[46:33] seems to be like the
[46:36] well he was over here and he said one
[46:38] thing over here he'd say another
[46:39] and you know that's true all right but
[46:43] see you're taking you you keep studying
[46:45] it and you find out
[46:48] that what he was doing was trying to
[46:51] explain something exactly right right
[46:53] and that was the only way he could
[46:55] explain man right not that he was going
[46:57] this way or going that way he was trying
[47:00] to explain it right and it looked like
[47:03] it was contrary one to the other which
[47:05] it wasn't contrary right I mean it was
[47:08] perfectly what it's supposed to be all
[47:10] right see then now then we come to the
[47:13] bases of seeing one thing
[47:15] I gave it to you there which I'll give
[47:17] it to you many times before but on birth
[47:19] planes right around it was talking about
[47:21] the planning of the word
[47:24] and he said that's why there's not so
[47:26] many
[47:27] new births
[47:29] right genuine ones right not so many of
[47:34] them all right not sure not so many
[47:37] Rudder genuine new births it's because
[47:40] the seed now this is what he says
[47:44] to see this
[47:46] you know it stops in maybe we'll
[47:48] sympathize
[47:50] with the word or the person now what
[47:52] does it mean to sympathize
[47:55] in other words you you go along and
[47:57] listen you you you you sympathize with
[48:00] it
[48:01] but watch what he says but they don't
[48:03] want to rot away from the old system
[48:06] that they were in
[48:09] not to spend all afternoon
[48:11] to doctrines
[48:14] of the people of this message that can
[48:17] be taken exactly back to the
[48:19] denominational periods of time and down
[48:21] through time
[48:23] that those doctrines were there
[48:27] was a Doctrine in the Baptist called two
[48:30] seeds in the spirit
[48:31] and if blinks basically to what would be
[48:34] called the two Soul Doctrine the Mormon
[48:36] doctrine of pre-existent system is a two
[48:39] Soul Doctrine
[48:41] these doctrines are not new I've tried
[48:44] to tell you that these things were
[48:46] before and that's Brother Ray he was
[48:47] listening in the 81.
[48:51] in 2000 he was listening and I was
[48:53] talking then about the River Jordan
[48:55] Doctrine because he's coughing the Tates
[48:58] off now and doing and that was back in
[49:00] the 80s and probably even in the 70s
[49:03] when they were talking about this River
[49:04] Jordan Doctrine
[49:07] these guys didn't come up with something
[49:08] new that doctor's been around a long
[49:10] time we had a Minister's meeting to hear
[49:12] heroin literally about that in probably
[49:15] the 70s you know
[49:18] because it came up dark but you see all
[49:21] these doctrines are not new
[49:23] they're just a new way of explaining it
[49:26] so what do they do sympathize you know
[49:29] in other words get in a little bit but
[49:31] not enough see and they don't want to
[49:33] rot away from the old system that they
[49:35] were in listen they don't want to come
[49:37] out of it they want to stay in their
[49:39] system and claim the new birth
[49:42] are the message of the age
[49:50] I believe this all the time
[49:54] Paul Jones excuse me I know his name is
[49:57] trying to get away from that but when
[49:59] they started that doctrine of the two
[50:00] Souls they
[50:03] my father said one day he said I've
[50:06] waited on this all my life
[50:08] you know
[50:11] please
[50:12] but how many of you sympathize with it
[50:17] damn
[50:20] they're good people
[50:23] and you know they've got that you're
[50:27] just too dogmatic because they're saying
[50:30] the same thing you are
[50:35] well thank you
[50:38] but they'll say you know people that's
[50:40] sympathizing with it right and you
[50:43] sympathize with it you know what you've
[50:44] got your Doctrine right that's right
[50:47] and so these days that's gonna have to
[50:49] be killed in you and that's well that's
[50:51] right
[50:52] he said well I don't know really where
[50:54] the two Soul doctors wrote or not I
[50:55] don't know about it but you know or I I
[50:58] kind of think it might be something to
[51:00] that
[51:01] well now you're sympathizing
[51:05] you're not taking of what I call the the
[51:09] law of just lay it down and say if this
[51:13] is right this can't be right amen right
[51:16] there's either going got to be one God
[51:20] or there's got to be some other form
[51:22] right all right
[51:25] now
[51:26] see it can't be Trinity Oneness or
[51:29] whatever
[51:30] so you just analyze it
[51:33] so that can't be
[51:35] right see you can't have two songs
[51:38] if you got two Souls you got two Gods
[51:41] because if God had to create so right
[51:44] and that's why they say Satan created
[51:46] one God created one Satan can't create
[51:50] so there it goes I've analyze that it
[51:55] can't be okay now I don't care what all
[51:57] the quote sounds like
[52:03] it can't be why because I've used a lot
[52:07] of average on it
[52:08] you said well that ain't supposed to be
[52:10] in the Revelation but okay
[52:14] you'd have to know what I'm talking
[52:15] about anyway
[52:17] but now listen
[52:21] then we've seen
[52:24] that is not the person
[52:27] 154 churches book
[52:30] it's not the person that comes
[52:31] predestinated eternally from God
[52:35] it's the word or seed
[52:41] now
[52:42] so the seed
[52:45] a word
[52:47] you know
[52:48] all right it can be predestinated
[52:51] eternally from God right
[52:54] but the person that's predestinated by
[52:56] four knowledge
[52:59] are you following yes
[53:02] but the seed is part of God
[53:05] and we're not talking about dead letters
[53:07] we're not talking about letters on the
[53:09] page
[53:11] when I talk about the word of God I'm
[53:14] talking about not a letter of a word
[53:17] I'm talking about the revealed word the
[53:21] alive word
[53:22] huh see and that can only be that God
[53:26] would be the word but there is no life
[53:28] outside of that that's right
[53:31] so everything in the world is
[53:33] predestinated
[53:35] what
[53:37] but God's foreknowledge
[53:40] but it's not the person then that comes
[53:43] predestinated
[53:44] it's the seed
[53:46] see then he goes on to express
[53:48] that Jacob alone was seed
[53:52] he said Jacob had the seat that is why
[53:55] he had respect to the birthright and
[53:57] Covenant of God
[53:59] now Jacob was the seed
[54:03] he said well now what's any difference
[54:06] in him and Esau
[54:08] Esau was a better man right
[54:11] but Jacob what she did he have
[54:19] now the only thing I know the difference
[54:21] between Jacob and Esau
[54:24] like I said if you were looking at him
[54:25] you'd pick Esau
[54:27] now what was the difference between
[54:29] Jacob and Esau
[54:31] Esau done everything he could he had to
[54:33] help to daddy he's hunted foreign he
[54:35] brought in me he worked himself to death
[54:39] trying to help his daddy
[54:41] yep
[54:43] you know Jacob was a shyster
[54:48] the only thing you can find good about
[54:50] Jacob is one thing what
[54:52] he had his mind
[54:55] set on
[54:57] that Birthright
[54:59] right right
[55:02] he had his mind on that Birthright he
[55:04] was going to get that birth right it
[55:06] don't make no difference what he had to
[55:09] do
[55:11] now run around says indeed see we know
[55:13] what it types in then it types what the
[55:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost because you
[55:19] were to have your mind set on the
[55:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost it don't
[55:22] matter what you got to do to get it you
[55:24] come get it that
[55:26] ought to be it because that would be
[55:27] your one thought amen all right let's
[55:29] see but Esau
[55:31] he didn't cherish the birthright
[55:34] because to my understanding in it see
[55:37] the birthright would get maybe sometime
[55:39] a double portion maybe out of the thing
[55:41] but still the other one would get
[55:43] something because wasn't that what Esau
[55:45] said beneath to something for me
[55:50] he said yes look what you did look at
[55:53] all this
[55:54] and look at him over there even down you
[55:58] can say Israel got a double portion but
[56:00] look at they're a whole lot smaller than
[56:02] all the things around them
[56:06] but it's dealing with the promise right
[56:07] but see that's the only thing you can
[56:09] say about Jacob
[56:12] did he had his eyes set on the
[56:14] birthright
[56:16] now what would that be then that would
[56:19] be the germ of life
[56:22] but now Jacob never received the new
[56:24] birth
[56:25] right so we got to move further away to
[56:29] be able to understand but that's an
[56:31] example to show it to us all right
[56:33] now so God by foreknowledge
[56:37] he predestinated everything that would
[56:41] ever be in the world foreign
[56:44] that's not calling it a respectful
[56:46] person
[56:48] we'll get to it in a minute where he
[56:50] says even your natural birth it's
[56:52] predestinated of God
[56:57] see
[56:58] then it's not working about whether
[57:00] predestination is right or not
[57:02] he's trying to find out what we
[57:05] understand
[57:07] to be able to guard to predetermine
[57:09] something to be that he could love love
[57:12] Jacob and hate Esau before they were
[57:15] ever born
[57:18] me
[57:19] and we want to make it some kind of a
[57:21] great
[57:22] spiritual thing you know
[57:27] we're gonna make it something that we
[57:29] can just
[57:30] makes us feel good
[57:32] well it makes me feel good to realize
[57:34] the word of God and how God does things
[57:36] all right now
[57:39] but watch now
[57:41] there's not too many new births genuine
[57:44] ones why
[57:46] because the seed is not planted
[57:49] correctly right
[57:52] now how can God give birth
[57:55] to a non-seat
[57:58] now could God give a new birth to a trip
[58:00] to a trinity
[58:04] no it's impossible
[58:07] now there were a lot of trinitarian
[58:08] people as I said God wait to their
[58:10] ignorance they were a lot of sanitary
[58:12] people they got the new birth right amen
[58:15] that's just the street when the Holy
[58:17] Ghost fell there on 1906 was actually
[58:20] trinitarians
[58:22] right
[58:24] the Oneness didn't come to about 1912
[58:26] somewhere along about dire
[58:29] okay
[58:30] God waited to ignorance
[58:34] but now he commands us to repent
[58:39] I believe the word
[58:42] plant the word word incorrect
[58:46] he planted it perfect
[58:50] all right
[58:51] and then on the dead Pentecost the Holy
[58:52] Ghost could fall on it right right
[58:55] so see you've got to be back here in the
[58:57] end time to once again do what he done
[59:00] that's why I believe the son of man
[59:02] coming back in the end time I believe it
[59:04] I believe he's in the Bride of Jesus
[59:06] Christ right now amen so in the seed of
[59:09] the word right right now he's not in all
[59:11] of this message people no but he's in
[59:15] the bride in the end times showing the
[59:17] seed peering unadulterated right right
[59:20] you said what brother Dale I thought
[59:23] when we got on over there you know there
[59:25] wouldn't be too many being saved well
[59:26] where'd you get the idea
[59:29] you've got a denominational concept
[59:33] I'm in
[59:35] oh my right come running around City
[59:38] didn't know how many to be saved in that
[59:40] life's moment two Rapture the church we
[59:43] don't want that quote
[59:45] but I just don't see there's no way
[59:47] people are harder can be saved anymore
[59:50] well you know
[59:51] you wouldn't the doctor said that about
[59:53] 20 years ago
[59:55] when you wasn't saved
[59:57] right right
[1:00:00] you see you find out you know why would
[1:00:02] anybody get that Concept in the mind why
[1:00:05] would it have it the Baptist that they
[1:00:06] wouldn't have a Revival
[1:00:09] because it afraid somebody might get
[1:00:11] saved that didn't want to be that God
[1:00:12] didn't want to say now that's a doctrine
[1:00:14] of the Baptist Church
[1:00:17] what are you seeing this message people
[1:00:19] I think it's about over don't you
[1:00:22] I just don't see no more people getting
[1:00:24] saved I think it's over
[1:00:28] yeah well what about your kids
[1:00:31] I'm gonna put your grandkids oh it's
[1:00:34] great grandkids
[1:00:40] it's all right if you're in isn't it
[1:00:46] I can't help it to probably say it I
[1:00:48] didn't say that I would think we're
[1:00:50] different he hadn't made that statement
[1:00:53] they look like it's over but he said I
[1:00:55] don't know how many be saved in the last
[1:00:56] moment two raps for the church
[1:00:59] well you know it might be that we've got
[1:01:01] to get this word planted peering under
[1:01:03] death
[1:01:03] before they could be any Birth come on
[1:01:06] Amen all right that's what I'm trying to
[1:01:09] do
[1:01:11] well brother damn we all claim to how to
[1:01:13] give birth well claiming to have it and
[1:01:15] it really happened it two different
[1:01:17] things
[1:01:18] you make a lot of claims
[1:01:22] but you see the new birth won't deny the
[1:01:24] word
[1:01:27] said God leads his word
[1:01:30] we want his children believe it
[1:01:33] well you're just not popular who's
[1:01:36] worried about popularity amen all right
[1:01:39] I'm worried about preaching the gospel
[1:01:41] to you somebody else listen that's fine
[1:01:46] I'm preaching the gospel the one I try
[1:01:48] to believe
[1:01:50] all right
[1:01:53] all right
[1:01:56] but now we read it there and we read it
[1:01:59] over and over in
[1:02:01] Ephesians
[1:02:02] that we were chosen in him
[1:02:05] before the foundation of the world
[1:02:10] well
[1:02:11] now if if that's sensible wording you
[1:02:15] know
[1:02:16] then it means one thing
[1:02:20] if we were chosen in him
[1:02:26] some way we've got to have the
[1:02:28] understanding
[1:02:30] that we had to be in him
[1:02:34] amen because
[1:02:37] of him
[1:02:38] we were chosen of him
[1:02:41] but we take the words to be then that
[1:02:43] would make him being a respecter
[1:02:49] and not fulfilling his whole plan
[1:02:53] I ordered me later on there's another
[1:02:55] couple of messages down the road but I
[1:02:58] quoted this morning
[1:02:59] right around said it was in him to be a
[1:03:01] father
[1:03:02] amen that's right
[1:03:06] see we think that's happened something
[1:03:07] happened on down the road after he'd
[1:03:09] existed
[1:03:12] it was in him to be a Healer
[1:03:15] your your mind is still locked on the
[1:03:17] fact that we had to be sickness it had
[1:03:18] to be a loss in them get it unlocked
[1:03:21] all right get it to the bases of seeing
[1:03:24] what it's really saying
[1:03:26] if it was in him to be a father you know
[1:03:28] what it meant he was a father
[1:03:32] right right you know it was in me to be
[1:03:35] a father
[1:03:36] the day I was born
[1:03:39] right that's right
[1:03:42] but it took 20 years and a wife to
[1:03:44] display that
[1:03:48] but it didn't matter it was already in
[1:03:50] there
[1:03:52] that's right
[1:03:54] so if we were chosen in him that meant
[1:03:56] we had to be in him
[1:04:00] and we're going back further into
[1:04:01] predestination
[1:04:03] then what our thoughts had been on we've
[1:04:05] been dealing with foreknowledge as
[1:04:07] dealing with what happened in life you
[1:04:10] know
[1:04:13] no I'm not going to get on it but I will
[1:04:15] when I get time that where it says the
[1:04:17] morning starts saying together the sons
[1:04:19] of God shouted for joy
[1:04:22] now that had to be in God some were amen
[1:04:28] and that was before
[1:04:32] the lamb was slain
[1:04:36] the
[1:04:38] because brother Robin said they saw the
[1:04:40] Plan of Redemption and he used his
[1:04:43] Revelations 13 8.
[1:04:48] do you say brother now do you mean that
[1:04:50] do you believe there was something back
[1:04:51] there
[1:04:52] well everybody else does
[1:04:55] but what if they believe was Factor
[1:04:58] all right
[1:05:00] they said run around them where we
[1:05:01] Spirits back there he says no you wasn't
[1:05:05] nothing I
[1:05:08] he was only in his mind
[1:05:14] that's what we're going to be dealing
[1:05:16] with
[1:05:17] me but it turned out to be the greatest
[1:05:19] mystery of all
[1:05:21] the mystery how that we were in him
[1:05:25] now that's what Jesus said what was it
[1:05:28] in you
[1:05:31] you and you and me
[1:05:33] now it's easy to see
[1:05:35] I understand or try to comprehend I in
[1:05:39] you we can say that's the new birth he's
[1:05:41] in US
[1:05:43] but said you and me
[1:05:47] the vast difference between the two
[1:05:49] statements that Jesus made them write
[1:05:51] together and you must have believed it
[1:05:53] right right because that's what he said
[1:05:56] all right now
[1:05:58] see then we've got to go back to find
[1:06:00] out
[1:06:03] how were we in him
[1:06:11] when we cannot put ourselves back there
[1:06:14] as people
[1:06:20] because that would bring pre-existence
[1:06:24] and we certainly know
[1:06:26] that this
[1:06:29] it would have a problem in your mental
[1:06:33] capacity of your mind to try to think
[1:06:36] that your body existed
[1:06:38] because he's now getting older
[1:06:42] all right
[1:06:46] hey
[1:06:48] but now listen
[1:06:52] we talk about
[1:06:54] eternity
[1:06:58] we say eternity
[1:07:01] has no beginning
[1:07:03] and has no end
[1:07:07] so now
[1:07:09] here's where the preachers need to
[1:07:11] listen a little bit maybe and hold on to
[1:07:13] it
[1:07:15] especially that because they're the ones
[1:07:17] trying to explain it
[1:07:19] if you can't preach predestination if
[1:07:22] Kate preachs eternity let me put it that
[1:07:24] away if you can't preach eternal
[1:07:27] and it's going just as far that away
[1:07:33] and never stopped him
[1:07:35] because if your thoughts ever stop
[1:07:39] it's not eternal
[1:07:41] right amen but at the same time you must
[1:07:44] be able to preach it
[1:07:46] back that away
[1:07:52] because if not you're going to have a
[1:07:53] starting point in coin right okay
[1:07:56] everybody with me yeah Joy fish eternal
[1:08:00] it had no beginning
[1:08:04] and have no ending
[1:08:10] so then you got to be able to go as far
[1:08:12] that away
[1:08:14] but you got to be able to go as far that
[1:08:16] way
[1:08:16] and it's not that they got to come and
[1:08:18] turn around and meet each other that's
[1:08:21] what I said about eternity as we say
[1:08:23] it's like a circle
[1:08:26] that's just our expression right no
[1:08:29] eternity means it's going that way
[1:08:32] eternally
[1:08:33] and it means it come from there
[1:08:35] eternally
[1:08:37] right it's not a circle to connect back
[1:08:40] make it that's what we make it sound
[1:08:42] like make it a mutant
[1:08:46] all right now
[1:08:48] I'm gonna
[1:08:49] just say this much
[1:08:52] now a priests and just got through with
[1:08:54] the series preaching
[1:08:57] and I preached it
[1:08:58] people believe that all God was he
[1:09:01] poured into Christ and all Christ
[1:09:02] supporting the church and take her back
[1:09:04] to the Garden of Eden all right that's
[1:09:06] that's good I wonder if we believe that
[1:09:09] but if you notice
[1:09:13] that as I was bringing it
[1:09:16] I didn't stop
[1:09:19] anywhere
[1:09:23] I preached it all the way into
[1:09:26] eternity
[1:09:28] that there is a message of cure the
[1:09:31] prophet said
[1:09:32] to be given to us
[1:09:34] in the Eternal ages to come
[1:09:38] you remember that
[1:09:41] see then I didn't stop
[1:09:45] I didn't preach it up to the Future home
[1:09:48] and stopped
[1:09:51] I didn't preach it to the Millennium and
[1:09:53] stop or whatever
[1:09:56] I preached it to the basis of showing
[1:09:59] you and what I believe that if God is
[1:10:01] eternal then they'll they'll be an
[1:10:03] eternal partaking of the Living God
[1:10:07] after this world is over we just come
[1:10:10] here to get enough understanding to get
[1:10:12] enough God in us to be able to
[1:10:14] understand what that God is amen
[1:10:20] when I got through that message
[1:10:22] I didn't stop it's still going
[1:10:25] all right
[1:10:27] go to these eternal
[1:10:30] how can you exhaust an eternal word
[1:10:34] right so you can watch our problem is we
[1:10:35] say Eternal Word but you know what our
[1:10:37] brain says and you know what our
[1:10:38] conscious inside of us says we're we're
[1:10:41] stop stop stop
[1:10:46] that's what I say that's that's our mind
[1:10:50] our brain stopped us from thinking about
[1:10:52] the word can be eternal
[1:10:55] book
[1:11:05] but in Eternal Word
[1:11:07] when we're 10 million trillion
[1:11:10] zillions or whatever you can say into
[1:11:13] eternity
[1:11:15] will still be receiving the Revelation
[1:11:17] that's right amen
[1:11:20] of almighty God
[1:11:23] it didn't stop
[1:11:26] now
[1:11:28] I was hoping somebody to bring that up
[1:11:30] to me one day
[1:11:33] now if we can't go back that way
[1:11:40] and keep on going back that way
[1:11:46] in the correct way
[1:11:50] then
[1:11:51] we just looking forward
[1:11:55] you're not taking the word eternal
[1:11:59] right
[1:12:01] that's why your Prophet would emphasize
[1:12:03] we don't believe in eternal sonship
[1:12:07] you see because sometimes have a
[1:12:08] beginning
[1:12:11] so we covered it
[1:12:14] what
[1:12:15] that one day the sun will
[1:12:18] be utter subjection to the father that
[1:12:20] God may be all in all
[1:12:24] hey not done away with
[1:12:30] we'll still see Jesus and realizing with
[1:12:32] almighty God
[1:12:35] but if we can't go back that away with
[1:12:37] it now
[1:12:39] see that what we're saying out there is
[1:12:41] just
[1:12:42] non-seed
[1:12:44] if I can't go and until the Holy Ghost
[1:12:48] if the Holy Ghost can't bring it through
[1:12:50] me to where we can go back there then
[1:12:53] there was something wrong with my going
[1:12:54] that away
[1:13:00] now that's eternal
[1:13:07] you see why
[1:13:09] that there's not too many New Birth
[1:13:12] genuine ones
[1:13:15] because the preachers can't go that away
[1:13:17] and go that way because their thoughts
[1:13:19] I'll go so far and they'll just make a
[1:13:21] circle and come right back in time to
[1:13:22] the bottom and we'll just make this
[1:13:23] circle over and over and over no no no
[1:13:25] no no no no no no no no that's just an
[1:13:28] example
[1:13:32] it just means it has no beginning and no
[1:13:34] end that's an example
[1:13:36] the real truth is it's got to keep going
[1:13:39] even science says this universe is
[1:13:41] moving
[1:13:45] yeah
[1:13:46] they say ever since the Big Bang Theory
[1:13:48] where it come from the one great big
[1:13:50] ball that is
[1:13:52] eternal it's just moving the whole at
[1:13:55] the whole world everything all the
[1:13:57] planets and everything we're moving
[1:14:01] why
[1:14:02] because it's proven God
[1:14:06] man are you listening please
[1:14:10] if you talk about eternity you've got to
[1:14:13] be able to go far that way and you can
[1:14:15] go that way
[1:14:18] right
[1:14:21] all right
[1:14:23] can you go back that way
[1:14:25] how far can you go
[1:14:32] how far backward can you go
[1:14:38] brother Brandon said in the beginning
[1:14:40] before the eternal
[1:14:44] now explain that one
[1:14:48] when eternity had no beginning how could
[1:14:51] he make such a statement in the
[1:14:53] beginning but before the eternal
[1:14:59] he's just trying his best to express
[1:15:03] the in the beginning is where we can
[1:15:06] mentally go back to
[1:15:09] yeah whether it be the creation of the
[1:15:11] world whether it be Angels whatever it
[1:15:14] be
[1:15:17] that that is the beginning
[1:15:20] but before the Eternal Eternal God
[1:15:23] existed
[1:15:28] the prophet said I'm coming here
[1:15:31] I know ain't gonna get to read them but
[1:15:33] if you've got eternal life
[1:15:36] you always was eternal that's right
[1:15:39] but that's the question
[1:15:42] if you had it right
[1:15:45] there's a title to the message this is
[1:15:46] predestination number eight do put the
[1:15:48] title to it
[1:15:49] do you have it
[1:15:52] now a question
[1:15:54] run around them you'll see every time he
[1:15:57] uses the word if you have it
[1:16:01] now
[1:16:03] if is a question
[1:16:06] right
[1:16:08] it's not a fact a statement it's a
[1:16:10] question
[1:16:11] right
[1:16:13] it means something is uh
[1:16:18] cannot be stated
[1:16:23] you know
[1:16:25] go to this ill
[1:16:31] if You Love Me Jesus said
[1:16:34] he'll keep my Commandments
[1:16:40] see
[1:16:41] a lot of ifs in the Bible
[1:16:45] because it means that
[1:16:47] there is a questionable
[1:16:50] thing involved
[1:16:54] if you love me the question is do you
[1:16:57] love me
[1:16:59] right
[1:17:02] do you love me
[1:17:03] if you love me do you love me
[1:17:07] all right now
[1:17:10] but see we we just put it where we want
[1:17:12] to put things
[1:17:13] and then we just talk about what we'll
[1:17:15] write this reading what it says here you
[1:17:17] know I always was eternal
[1:17:21] well
[1:17:23] what if the prophet in the same message
[1:17:25] says if you have eternal life
[1:17:39] let's read a little bit
[1:17:41] you get number three on your notes which
[1:17:43] is taking surge we would see Jesus 1964
[1:17:46] 318.
[1:17:49] like in the beginning
[1:17:52] God was not even God
[1:17:56] he was the great eternal
[1:18:00] and even Dyer was attributes
[1:18:07] he said attributes was his thoughts
[1:18:11] on now what is his attributes
[1:18:14] there's three attributes of God now we
[1:18:16] did I've told him explained it before so
[1:18:19] that's what I'm trying to say again
[1:18:20] there's only three attributes so God
[1:18:22] father son the Holy Ghost all right now
[1:18:24] you see now this here all of those are
[1:18:26] in focus on and Holy Ghost
[1:18:29] are you listening now all the attributes
[1:18:31] of God is good is developed or come from
[1:18:34] or in the the basis of Father Son and
[1:18:37] Holy Ghost
[1:18:39] is that sensible yes
[1:18:42] yes that's the only attributes they are
[1:18:45] now here A Savior except
[1:18:47] has to dwell within Father Son and Holy
[1:18:50] Ghost
[1:18:51] all right now then was there ever a time
[1:18:54] that he was your father and then he
[1:18:57] becomes son and then you become the Holy
[1:19:00] Ghost
[1:19:01] now that's predator and it's all get out
[1:19:06] we'll read and run around and said they
[1:19:08] would go out alone with his attributes
[1:19:13] that's why I was saying there a moment
[1:19:14] ago
[1:19:15] if he ever
[1:19:17] was a father
[1:19:19] then that was his attribute
[1:19:22] so do you know what it meant
[1:19:26] for him to be a father you know what it
[1:19:28] means
[1:19:30] what what makes us your father we're not
[1:19:33] talking about the Catholic church now
[1:19:34] called the father or some preacher you
[1:19:35] know his father so and so
[1:19:38] no we're not talking about that
[1:19:42] what makes a father
[1:19:45] that's all friends
[1:19:49] I still Fellaini
[1:19:51] brother that's the Deep
[1:19:55] that's a simple
[1:19:59] so then they
[1:20:01] our word for God goes back to
[1:20:05] self-existing
[1:20:09] then there was a time that he existed
[1:20:11] with himself
[1:20:14] but then was there ever a Time
[1:20:16] existed without his attributes
[1:20:23] if you do it you're going to start him
[1:20:24] changing
[1:20:26] doing things
[1:20:32] we're going to see what eternity is
[1:20:35] like I said but the message I preached
[1:20:37] and believe what I see I'm still going
[1:20:39] that away
[1:20:40] because I'm not limited God nowhere and
[1:20:43] I can see down through the endless
[1:20:45] Eternal ages that his word will just
[1:20:47] keep unfolding and folding and unfolding
[1:20:52] now let's go back that away
[1:20:57] and see if we can go back far enough
[1:20:58] until in our our thinking we'll see that
[1:21:01] there never was a time that he didn't
[1:21:03] exist
[1:21:06] and if there never was a time God didn't
[1:21:09] exist
[1:21:10] then there's never been a time that his
[1:21:13] offspring didn't exist
[1:21:15] Ence
[1:21:19] or you're gonna have to say he developed
[1:21:21] something along the way
[1:21:23] right
[1:21:25] all right
[1:21:28] you know you're going to find out what
[1:21:30] it means I always was eternal
[1:21:36] because if you have eternal life how
[1:21:38] many quotes is there if you have eternal
[1:21:41] life
[1:21:43] that eternal life
[1:21:45] always was eternal
[1:21:49] all right
[1:21:52] so let's see what your Prophet had to
[1:21:54] say
[1:21:58] it was the Eternal God in endurance
[1:22:00] attributes attributes was installed and
[1:22:03] then it become a word like this and a
[1:22:06] word expressed well a thought expressed
[1:22:08] as a word
[1:22:09] the word express is a thought and then
[1:22:12] remember if you ever was in God's
[1:22:15] thinking
[1:22:18] you'll always be there
[1:22:23] once
[1:22:26] if you've got eternal life
[1:22:31] Marcel
[1:22:35] right right if you've got eternal life
[1:22:39] you are the expression or the attribute
[1:22:42] of this thought for this age
[1:22:45] if not you there's only one eternal life
[1:22:49] and it always existed
[1:22:53] and you and his mind existed before
[1:22:56] there was a world
[1:23:00] that's the reason he said he chose you
[1:23:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:23:05] it isn't what we think what somebody
[1:23:08] else thinks is what God
[1:23:11] Eternal you always was see in his
[1:23:14] thinking
[1:23:17] it was in him to be man
[1:23:23] now when did that develop
[1:23:25] ment sure later on right
[1:23:29] but it would always end him right sure
[1:23:32] that's the reason that Christ was the
[1:23:35] expressed image see
[1:23:43] so where were we
[1:23:47] if he was if you ever was in God's
[1:23:51] thinking you'll always be there
[1:23:55] right
[1:23:57] if you ever was
[1:24:01] now why is he saying that
[1:24:07] because the if it's left up to you and I
[1:24:09] remember I said a lot of times I said
[1:24:10] well now
[1:24:12] um
[1:24:14] you know I say this because it's left up
[1:24:17] to you to think about it
[1:24:20] if God is real
[1:24:22] if there is a God
[1:24:25] that doesn't mean I doubt that God is
[1:24:27] real that doesn't mean I doubt there's a
[1:24:28] God I say it I said I I leaning back to
[1:24:32] you that's to you if you think
[1:24:35] if you think there is a God why can't
[1:24:37] you think that God can never have
[1:24:38] another thought
[1:24:43] these thoughts got to be perfect and
[1:24:45] pure and eternal amen
[1:24:49] see we put our little ifs in there
[1:24:54] I think wouldn't that what happened to
[1:24:56] even the garden right
[1:24:58] do you know no right even funny
[1:25:00] that's what messed her up well that's
[1:25:02] when that he's down the right hand
[1:25:05] he was not throwing off on women
[1:25:08] look at him proving his word 1964 age
[1:25:10] 16.
[1:25:12] okay now our stood priests there said
[1:25:15] this man's Bell's above
[1:25:17] see no representation
[1:25:22] eternal life
[1:25:24] you always was
[1:25:26] see
[1:25:28] you have eternal life
[1:25:30] there's only one form of it
[1:25:33] that's God
[1:25:36] you were his attribute
[1:25:38] he thought of you and no Jew before the
[1:25:42] foundation of the world
[1:25:44] in his mind
[1:25:47] he goes on to explain
[1:25:50] that those priests had all the
[1:25:51] representation on Earth
[1:25:55] but they had no representation in heaven
[1:26:04] wasn't in God's thinking at all
[1:26:07] but he said this little woman that said
[1:26:09] I believe you're a prophet in other
[1:26:10] words all right
[1:26:12] now let's clear up something
[1:26:15] people say it but brother Dale
[1:26:21] I believe I was a thought in God's mind
[1:26:27] I conned the phrase
[1:26:29] I hope it sticks with you
[1:26:31] I don't want to be a thought in God's
[1:26:33] mind
[1:26:35] because he thought of Judas his
[1:26:37] character
[1:26:39] he thought of every person by his
[1:26:40] foreknowledge that would ever be in the
[1:26:43] world
[1:26:44] and now they would be lost
[1:26:48] to be part of the Thinker you remember
[1:26:50] that
[1:26:55] that's anchor right
[1:26:58] well you're just getting in the war
[1:27:00] what's the matter
[1:27:02] can't you see that a thought that God
[1:27:05] would have could be Destiny a part of
[1:27:07] Earth to be the point of seeing
[1:27:09] everything but to be part of his
[1:27:11] thinking right yeah
[1:27:13] amen
[1:27:16] would be entirely different right
[1:27:20] Judas is scary was right there in the
[1:27:22] thoughts of God
[1:27:25] but he was not eternal
[1:27:27] he proved it because he didn't receive
[1:27:29] eternal life right but now listen now
[1:27:33] God's thoughts are eternal
[1:27:36] okay
[1:27:38] so once he thought of Judas me and Judas
[1:27:40] he could never change
[1:27:49] see we we don't look at those things in
[1:27:52] the correct order
[1:27:55] his thought of you and I could be
[1:27:58] Eternal but that don't give us eternal
[1:27:59] life
[1:28:04] but if we're a part of God
[1:28:06] we always was eternal
[1:28:18] now we're going to take a lot of reading
[1:28:22] I wasn't going to do but just a little
[1:28:23] bit but
[1:28:24] finally decided if you'll notice number
[1:28:26] five goes on on to them IRS and it keeps
[1:28:30] on rolling okay
[1:28:31] that means this is a continuation of
[1:28:34] reading right out of the church age book
[1:28:36] all right so let's just read the
[1:28:40] people can read you something and say
[1:28:42] you believe that
[1:28:46] the prophet said I can read to you that
[1:28:48] Judas went hung himself and you go do
[1:28:49] likewise you believe that
[1:28:53] no you know why because the before and
[1:28:56] after explains it right you remember
[1:28:59] come on board pay your board because I'm
[1:29:00] bored with you
[1:29:02] the way you explaining something gives
[1:29:04] you the answer
[1:29:08] all right
[1:29:10] but if you continually read at least one
[1:29:12] thing about it you got to admit the
[1:29:13] prophet said
[1:29:19] but you know how it is what have you
[1:29:21] done a lot of times you went up and
[1:29:22] talked to people and you say the Bible
[1:29:24] says
[1:29:25] and you're holding it in your hand the
[1:29:27] Bible says
[1:29:29] wrong for a woman to cut her hair what
[1:29:31] do they say
[1:29:34] what's the statement back to you I don't
[1:29:36] believe that
[1:29:39] I know
[1:29:42] I don't believe that
[1:29:44] what do you mean you don't believe it
[1:29:46] it's right there
[1:29:49] I don't believe what you're saying
[1:29:53] I didn't say it that's right yeah that's
[1:29:56] your interpretation
[1:29:58] I let you read it right
[1:30:04] what'd you see
[1:30:06] we're so spiritual we think
[1:30:09] until we can correct almighty God
[1:30:12] now that's really doing something in it
[1:30:15] so let's just start reading
[1:30:17] and just follow with me and I'll try to
[1:30:19] quit here in a few minutes because I
[1:30:20] know I can't get to all I've got written
[1:30:22] name all right this is Page 149 which is
[1:30:26] the church age book it's submarine
[1:30:27] Church age but it's in the church age
[1:30:30] book
[1:30:32] this will be 149 it'll be reading
[1:30:34] through 150 and then to 152. all right
[1:30:37] watch carefully now and see this
[1:30:40] before there was ever a speck of
[1:30:42] Stardust
[1:30:44] before God was God in this good point
[1:30:48] God is an object of adoration and no one
[1:30:51] was there to worship him so he was at
[1:30:54] that time only potentially God
[1:30:57] and he was known only as eternal spirit
[1:31:01] the bride was already in his mind
[1:31:05] yes she was
[1:31:08] she was existing in his thoughts
[1:31:13] and what about those thoughts of God
[1:31:17] they are Eternal are they not
[1:31:21] I see now don't go back to her
[1:31:25] I'm warning you ahead of time and make
[1:31:28] yourself little bitty people running
[1:31:30] around that's right amen any form you
[1:31:34] want to make
[1:31:36] please whatever then you you got
[1:31:38] problems right
[1:31:41] anything you want to make
[1:31:46] do you're going to try to figure it out
[1:31:49] don't try to figure it out listen to The
[1:31:51] Prophet explain it
[1:31:56] the
[1:31:57] Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you
[1:31:59] are that's also God eternal
[1:32:01] if you can see this you will see many
[1:32:03] things
[1:32:04] God is unchangeable in both Essence and
[1:32:07] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:32:09] that already God is infinite in his
[1:32:12] ability so therefore he as God must be
[1:32:14] omniscient
[1:32:17] if he is omniscient then he is not now
[1:32:20] learning
[1:32:21] nor is he taking counsel even with
[1:32:24] himself
[1:32:25] nor is he at any time adding to his
[1:32:29] knowledge
[1:32:30] if he can add to his knowledge then he
[1:32:32] is not not omniscient
[1:32:34] the best you could say is that sometime
[1:32:37] he will be
[1:32:38] but that is not scriptural
[1:32:42] he is omniscient
[1:32:44] he has never had a new thought about
[1:32:47] anything because all his thoughts he has
[1:32:51] always had and always will have and
[1:32:54] knows the end from the beginning because
[1:32:56] he's God
[1:32:59] the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:33:02] they are real now listen to him they are
[1:33:05] not
[1:33:06] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:33:09] blueprint he has grown up which one day
[1:33:12] will be translated into substance and
[1:33:14] form but they're already real and
[1:33:16] eternal and part of God
[1:33:19] do we draw the blueprint we make some we
[1:33:21] draw it up what we want to look like he
[1:33:22] didn't do that
[1:33:25] see how this works
[1:33:27] God always had his thoughts for Adam
[1:33:31] has his thoughts was yet unexpressed
[1:33:37] Psalms 139 15 16 will give you a little
[1:33:41] idea of this
[1:33:42] now keep in mind his thoughts was
[1:33:44] unexpressed
[1:33:46] so when he says down here that I said I
[1:33:48] didn't say this to him about Adam
[1:33:51] because it's going to be bringing it
[1:33:52] down to a deeper meaning okay
[1:33:55] so hold on man read with me
[1:33:57] Psalms see
[1:33:59] 130 out of 15 16. we'll give you a nice
[1:34:02] little idea of this so it's going to
[1:34:03] give you an idea of Eternity
[1:34:05] what it is or an eternal thought my
[1:34:08] substance was not hidden from thee when
[1:34:10] I was made in secret and curiously
[1:34:12] brought in the lower parts of the earth
[1:34:14] and that was talking of Jesus Christ
[1:34:16] all right and then talking of mankind
[1:34:20] okay or the bride all right then as you
[1:34:24] see my substance yet being unperfect
[1:34:27] and in that book were all my members
[1:34:30] written which in continuous see one
[1:34:32] after the other what's fashion one is
[1:34:34] yet there was none of them then as I
[1:34:36] said was not written about Adam
[1:34:40] they've become animals on Express now
[1:34:42] this wasn't written about Adam
[1:34:46] it's written about him and written about
[1:34:48] you and I
[1:34:50] but it gives you the idea and knowledge
[1:34:51] that the thought that was there in his
[1:34:54] mind
[1:34:55] and that thought was eternal and had to
[1:34:57] be expressed so when Adam was formed of
[1:35:00] the Dust of the Earth
[1:35:01] and his spiritual being created by God
[1:35:03] then Adam became God's thought expressed
[1:35:07] in those Eternal thoughts were now
[1:35:10] manifested in other words he came on
[1:35:13] Earth
[1:35:17] down through the centuries we go
[1:35:21] we find a Moses
[1:35:24] a Jeremiah but John the Baptist
[1:35:27] notice all of these are Old Testament
[1:35:29] right
[1:35:32] he's one of these were God's Eternal
[1:35:34] thought
[1:35:36] expressed in its season
[1:35:39] then we come to Jesus the Lord gods he
[1:35:43] was the perfect and complete talk
[1:35:45] expressed and he became known as the
[1:35:48] word
[1:35:49] that's what he is and forever will be
[1:35:52] that says that he had chosen Us in him
[1:35:55] Jesus before the foundation of the world
[1:35:58] that means that we were right there with
[1:36:01] him in the mind and thoughts of God
[1:36:04] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:06] that gives an eternal quality to the
[1:36:08] elect you can't get away from it
[1:36:12] and what let me just inject the thought
[1:36:14] in here
[1:36:15] even our natural birth is based upon
[1:36:17] election
[1:36:18] the female ovaries right pronounce that
[1:36:21] word produce men produce many many eggs
[1:36:25] but why is it that at a certain time a
[1:36:28] certain egg comes down and not another
[1:36:31] one and then amongst the male sperm
[1:36:35] for no known reason a certain germ
[1:36:37] attaches itself to the egg While others
[1:36:40] that could have just as easily attached
[1:36:42] themselves or had a better opportunity
[1:36:44] to do so
[1:36:46] do so did not do so and perished
[1:36:50] there is an intelligence behind all
[1:36:52] intelligence behind all this otherwise
[1:36:54] what determines whether the baby is a
[1:36:56] boy a girl blonde or brunette lighter
[1:36:58] brown Lighter dark type of eyes are so
[1:37:01] forth with these thoughts in mind think
[1:37:03] about Joshua and Caleb
[1:37:07] did not Jesus say in John 6. 49.
[1:37:11] your fathers did eat Manna in the
[1:37:14] wilderness and are dead
[1:37:16] no whatever else did that means they
[1:37:18] don't think we've talked to were
[1:37:19] eternally dead
[1:37:22] those parents that died were necessary
[1:37:27] as the forefathers of the people of whom
[1:37:30] Jesus was speaking in other words they
[1:37:32] had to be back there to where these
[1:37:34] people could stand before Jesus and he
[1:37:36] said and your father take man in the
[1:37:39] wilderness and they're dead and you're
[1:37:40] dead too in other words
[1:37:44] they perished it they were in the
[1:37:46] election of God
[1:37:47] naturally as Joshua and Taylor were
[1:37:49] spiritually
[1:37:51] but go on
[1:37:53] these elect were not only the Eternal
[1:37:55] thoughts of God which were to be
[1:37:59] a physician but these same electors
[1:38:01] called by another name Romans 4 16.
[1:38:04] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[1:38:06] by grace to the end the promise might be
[1:38:09] sure to all the seed
[1:38:11] not to that which oh wait not to that
[1:38:15] only which is of the law but to that
[1:38:17] also which is of the faith of Abraham
[1:38:20] who is the father of us all Romans 9
[1:38:23] 17-13
[1:38:25] neither because they are the Seed of
[1:38:28] Abraham are they all children but in
[1:38:31] Isaac shall thy seed be called now I
[1:38:32] just got through preaching on the Isaac
[1:38:34] the seed and the right
[1:38:36] okay
[1:38:38] that is they which are the children of
[1:38:40] the flesh these are not the children of
[1:38:42] God but the children of the promise are
[1:38:44] counted for the seed for This Is The
[1:38:46] Word of Promise at this time will I come
[1:38:48] and Sarah shall have a son not only this
[1:38:51] but when that Rebecca had also conceived
[1:38:54] by one even by Our Father Isaac for the
[1:38:57] children being not yet born neither
[1:38:58] having done any good or evil that the
[1:39:01] purpose of God according to election
[1:39:02] might stand not in works but of him that
[1:39:06] call it it was said unto her that Elder
[1:39:08] Shall Serve the younger as it is written
[1:39:10] Jacob have I loved but he saw how I
[1:39:12] hated
[1:39:14] Galatians 3 16. now to Abraham and his
[1:39:18] seed were the promises made
[1:39:20] he saith not and to seeds as Genesis I'm
[1:39:24] in Galatians 3 16.
[1:39:27] he said not and to seeds as a many but
[1:39:30] as of one and of thy seed which is
[1:39:32] Christ
[1:39:33] Galatians 3 29.
[1:39:35] and if you be Christ then you're
[1:39:38] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[1:39:40] the promise
[1:39:41] according to Romans 4 16 we find that
[1:39:46] God has given a sure promise to all of
[1:39:49] Abraham's seed
[1:39:52] and Paul puts himself in all believers
[1:39:54] under that designation because he said
[1:39:56] Abraham who is the father of us all
[1:39:59] then he goes on to not only narrow down
[1:40:02] his definition but rather to finalize it
[1:40:05] in Galatians 3 he identified deceit
[1:40:07] singular with Jesus
[1:40:09] and counted to see children as children
[1:40:11] of promise
[1:40:13] and promise of having to do with
[1:40:15] election are the children of God and
[1:40:17] that is exactly what we have been saying
[1:40:20] these are the Royal Sea these these who
[1:40:24] are of the royal seed are the elect of
[1:40:27] God or the predestinated foreknown of
[1:40:30] God and we're in the mind of God in his
[1:40:33] thoughts
[1:40:34] in very plain language the true bride of
[1:40:36] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[1:40:40] do not expressed
[1:40:43] until each came forth in the designated
[1:40:46] decree season in his age each member
[1:40:49] came forth it became expressed it took
[1:40:52] his place in the body
[1:40:54] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[1:40:57] word seed spoken word see bright and
[1:41:00] though she is feminine designations
[1:41:02] she's also called the body of Christ it
[1:41:04] is very apparently show to be called
[1:41:06] that for she was predestinated in him
[1:41:08] came from the same source
[1:41:11] are you reading was eternal with him and
[1:41:15] is now massifesting God in a many
[1:41:17] members body whereas once God was
[1:41:19] manifested now that's cut off on yours
[1:41:22] but it says in one member
[1:41:25] even our Lord Jesus Christ if that was
[1:41:28] cut off the bottom of the earth so
[1:41:31] now I can't get far enough to get into
[1:41:33] it
[1:41:35] but what I want
[1:41:38] we will go and read one more number six
[1:41:40] on your note
[1:41:42] then we're coming to a conclusion
[1:41:46] as the eternal
[1:41:48] logos God
[1:41:50] with manifested in the Sun
[1:41:52] and in Jesus all dwell all the well all
[1:41:56] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:41:59] and then Eternal one was the father
[1:42:00] manifest in flesh and thereby gained the
[1:42:03] title son of son even so we Eternal in
[1:42:07] his talks in our turn became the many
[1:42:10] membered spoken word seed manifest in
[1:42:13] flesh
[1:42:14] and those Eternal thoughts now manifest
[1:42:17] in flesh are the sons of God even as we
[1:42:21] are so called we did not become seed by
[1:42:24] the rebirth
[1:42:26] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[1:42:28] for only the elect can be reborn because
[1:42:31] we were seed as a reason we could be
[1:42:33] quickened in none seed there is nothing
[1:42:36] to Quicken no
[1:42:40] you have a lot of in there and I will
[1:42:42] make this on it and it's on the computer
[1:42:44] for them to do it you read all of them
[1:42:47] things by Wednesday and we'll pick up
[1:42:48] that talk and carry on but read all of
[1:42:51] these thoughts where brother Branham and
[1:42:53] I gave you where he said my future home
[1:42:55] people say uh
[1:42:59] Eternal into the kingdom of God with
[1:43:01] eternal life of the predestinated
[1:43:02] Endeavor didn't start never started on
[1:43:04] any day you wasn't saved on any day you
[1:43:08] was always saved
[1:43:12] I believe that 100
[1:43:16] but you better read on because you see
[1:43:19] you will find
[1:43:22] in your quote
[1:43:25] another quote out of the future home
[1:43:30] that says
[1:43:32] if
[1:43:34] you have eternal life
[1:43:37] you always was eternal
[1:43:40] out of the same message
[1:43:42] that tells you you always was eternal
[1:43:44] there's a lot of quotes going through
[1:43:46] that so I can't cover it all right we'll
[1:43:48] be here late this afternoon
[1:43:50] but you read them over and over and
[1:43:52] we'll put it on a little bit in this
[1:43:53] coming Wednesday we'll start right there
[1:43:56] if you have eternal life
[1:44:01] you always was eternal
[1:44:05] but you as a person you know not you as
[1:44:08] what we're looking at right
[1:44:11] but if you have eternal life how could
[1:44:13] you have eternal life
[1:44:19] didn't have a beginning
[1:44:23] or have an indie
[1:44:26] right if you have eternal life
[1:44:31] the eternal life that you have always
[1:44:35] was
[1:44:36] eternal
[1:44:38] example
[1:44:41] but brother Dale I just believe that
[1:44:43] quote
[1:44:44] I run around and said I always was
[1:44:46] eternal
[1:44:48] well all right
[1:44:51] that you see
[1:44:52] to those that want to know the truth
[1:44:54] they keep on reading
[1:44:58] and you see that he said if you have
[1:45:00] eternal life
[1:45:01] you always was eternal and you'll find
[1:45:04] in our one in the future home
[1:45:06] is where I just read from the Futurama
[1:45:11] so is your Prophet that confused
[1:45:16] did he teach that we don't have to be
[1:45:18] born again
[1:45:19] no
[1:45:22] no that was his if that was his
[1:45:25] stressing the point
[1:45:27] we had to Bear born again
[1:45:30] we have to receive eternal life
[1:45:34] if we receive eternal life then the
[1:45:36] eternal life never had no beginning we
[1:45:39] could never have an end right
[1:45:41] simple but do we believe it that way
[1:45:46] or we got some preconceived idea
[1:45:49] or thought
[1:45:51] that we come into the world
[1:45:55] with eternal life
[1:46:02] if you did then Jesus Christ didn't have
[1:46:04] to die
[1:46:09] you stay with brother Dale
[1:46:11] all he died
[1:46:15] I'll cover it
[1:46:18] he said you'd say well brother Dale all
[1:46:20] it is is
[1:46:24] the the new birth and things are just an
[1:46:27] anointing
[1:46:31] it would come on us
[1:46:33] hmm
[1:46:35] to let us know
[1:46:44] well
[1:46:46] according to the prophet
[1:46:48] that anointing left him in a Garden of
[1:46:50] Gethsemane
[1:46:56] manifested Sons 1960.
[1:46:59] the anointing left him in the Garden of
[1:47:01] Gethsemane
[1:47:03] and then where's your new birth from
[1:47:08] you see there's some things are in the
[1:47:10] sea of the church age group we're going
[1:47:11] to get down and read
[1:47:15] because I've had these red in my face
[1:47:16] until it's just you know sometimes you
[1:47:20] actually don't want to read some of the
[1:47:21] quotes because they've been read from
[1:47:22] wrong
[1:47:25] brother random says in there and
[1:47:27] everybody lays up on that you know he
[1:47:29] said an eagle can go a long time before
[1:47:31] it realizes sneaker
[1:47:40] you made that statement
[1:47:45] but you know
[1:47:49] and don't consider one thing
[1:47:53] that eagle that was born in the chicken
[1:47:55] yard
[1:47:57] wasn't a chicken
[1:48:00] didn't even look like a chicken
[1:48:02] you didn't act like a chicken
[1:48:10] he born an eagle
[1:48:15] when you're born again that makes you a
[1:48:17] child of God right
[1:48:21] he was born to me go by his new birth
[1:48:25] but then one day he realized
[1:48:29] that he wasn't a chicken
[1:48:30] because all that time he thought he was
[1:48:33] we used to have no rabbit that rabbit is
[1:48:35] running around through the yard great
[1:48:37] big old sucker he'd run around through
[1:48:39] the yard and then we'll rabbit dogs
[1:48:40] would just run right around through that
[1:48:41] with him and barking you know he'd just
[1:48:43] run around through that he thought his
[1:48:44] rat a dog
[1:48:47] you look
[1:48:48] and he was so big but them old rabbit
[1:48:50] dogs wouldn't move food with him and
[1:48:52] Freight has he
[1:48:54] but someday I don't remember exactly
[1:48:56] what happened but I guess it was a big
[1:48:57] old bony Hound probably took care of the
[1:49:00] rabbit I don't remember what happened
[1:49:02] because that's gone but
[1:49:03] I imagine that old bony Hound let the
[1:49:06] rabbit realize that he was a rabbit and
[1:49:08] he wasn't no dog
[1:49:10] and he got him a meal you know what
[1:49:14] you understand what I'm saying
[1:49:18] us Eagles a lot of you claimed the
[1:49:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost before you
[1:49:22] ever come in the message even
[1:49:25] and I don't argue that I believe it
[1:49:27] until my experience that I didn't do
[1:49:29] that but I believe yours you tell me you
[1:49:31] got the new birth somewhere
[1:49:33] well you know what you were sitting out
[1:49:34] trying to them denominations thanking
[1:49:36] you as bad just just thinking his
[1:49:38] Methodist and Presbyterians just having
[1:49:40] yourself a good time you know and going
[1:49:43] over and everything else
[1:49:46] you'd never do you need to know where
[1:49:48] the ego was
[1:49:49] you know what a Christian was did you
[1:49:52] come on be honest
[1:49:55] you thought a Christian massage good and
[1:49:57] going to church and being nice and you
[1:49:59] know and doing everything nice and sure
[1:50:01] enough we know that's part of it but
[1:50:03] watch a Christian born-again experience
[1:50:07] oh that was wonderful but that was good
[1:50:09] things
[1:50:11] let's see one day you realize
[1:50:14] that you were no Presbyterian
[1:50:18] you wouldn't know me after this you were
[1:50:19] no bad this you wouldn't know chicken
[1:50:23] you come to a realization now I'm gonna
[1:50:26] say it and because I'll come back to
[1:50:28] this see this message
[1:50:31] should bring you and I to a realization
[1:50:34] that they ain't no chicken you'll take
[1:50:36] his message
[1:50:40] because it'll be like the lady said you
[1:50:43] know
[1:50:44] did he call me a buzzard
[1:50:47] you know Tommy brother Ryan's message
[1:50:48] this other sister said but he called me
[1:50:50] an eagle
[1:50:53] you got to be an eagle to have Eagle
[1:50:55] food
[1:50:57] so the things people use to try to prove
[1:51:00] a point
[1:51:01] they they don't prove anything they
[1:51:04] prove sometimes how dumb we are to want
[1:51:06] to use them
[1:51:07] but that eagle was born to an eagle
[1:51:11] he wasn't born to chicken and then
[1:51:13] become an eagle
[1:51:15] and it took him a long time to find out
[1:51:17] he was an eagle
[1:51:18] this took you and a long time to find
[1:51:21] out we're Eagles we're not chickens
[1:51:25] and like I've always told you
[1:51:29] that old Eagle was down in the barnyard
[1:51:33] right
[1:51:35] one day if Mama come along screaming he
[1:51:37] jumped upon the post we know the story
[1:51:39] of any sword in the sky
[1:51:41] right
[1:51:42] and he soared around as an eagle
[1:51:46] and he realized he was an eagle
[1:51:51] I know you don't like the rest of my
[1:51:53] story but it's all right it's true you
[1:51:55] have to agree
[1:51:56] because see one day that illegal he
[1:51:59] realized he's an equal
[1:52:01] you know what he does him and mama and
[1:52:05] daddy is flying over the chicken yard
[1:52:10] and all at once all his brothers and
[1:52:12] sisters and his mama and what he thought
[1:52:15] was his mom and daddy you know all at
[1:52:18] once
[1:52:19] they look like a good Kentucky Fried
[1:52:23] Chicken meal
[1:52:25] and they'd better run from the old boy
[1:52:28] because he's not a chicken he's open to
[1:52:32] all he loved his mama
[1:52:34] see you don't understand it that eagle
[1:52:37] we need to become an eagle then chickens
[1:52:39] better run but
[1:52:42] because that was his nature
[1:52:46] it wouldn't be that he remembered how
[1:52:47] good his mother was need to remember how
[1:52:50] good an old-fashioned meal is
[1:52:52] I'm just carnal I know
[1:52:56] but you think about it
[1:52:58] run around never made that illustration
[1:53:00] I didn't say he did I said I did
[1:53:03] but is it true
[1:53:08] is it true let's Stand Together
[1:53:12] go ahead
[1:53:24] and get one of you come ahead anyway
[1:53:31] we come down to the communion part
[1:53:34] forgive me for Joe Henry if I could it's
[1:53:36] not a place to joke but I don't mean
[1:53:38] it's a joke I mean it's the truth and
[1:53:40] you really find out you're an eagle
[1:53:42] you're not going to go out there and try
[1:53:43] to sail over and destroy all these
[1:53:44] things no no we would try to hip
[1:53:46] everybody
[1:53:47] do anything we could to help any
[1:53:49] denominational person they call in one
[1:53:51] prayer we pray for them right we pray
[1:53:54] this is sincerely it's just making a
[1:53:55] point
[1:53:57] but there's got to be a day you and I
[1:53:59] going to find out we're equals
[1:54:02] and we're not going to be scratching in
[1:54:04] the chicken yard
[1:54:05] them two Soul doctrines and seven
[1:54:07] Thunder virtues and River Jordan
[1:54:08] doctrines they become worms and we don't
[1:54:11] want him
[1:54:14] we want a fresh kill that will keep
[1:54:15] going that way
[1:54:17] and never stop
[1:54:19] it'll also go back that way
[1:54:21] and never find a beginning
[1:54:24] if I can preach anything whatsoever to
[1:54:26] you is what I'm trying to bring is to
[1:54:28] get you to see God never had a beginning
[1:54:33] and if you have eternal life
[1:54:36] the eternal life you have
[1:54:38] never had a beginning
[1:54:43] but you've got to receive it to have it
[1:54:47] just as Jesus I've Illustrated over and
[1:54:50] over right
[1:54:52] Jesus stood as a lands flying before the
[1:54:54] foundation worked right
[1:54:56] but now what if he'd never come to
[1:54:58] Calvary 2000 years ago it would have
[1:55:00] meant that was false prophecy
[1:55:02] it would have been saying something that
[1:55:04] wasn't true
[1:55:05] he had to come to that place
[1:55:09] there was a day you and I was lost and
[1:55:12] doomed and on our way to hell
[1:55:13] right we had to accept eternal life we
[1:55:17] had to accept the pardon to be set free
[1:55:20] but once we accepted it we find out we
[1:55:22] just as Eternal as he is right find out
[1:55:26] with that eternal life that I have never
[1:55:28] had no beginning
[1:55:31] right
[1:55:32] that's a wonderful kind amen
[1:55:36] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:55:37] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:55:39] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:55:41] was betrayed to bread
[1:55:43] and when he had given thanks he break
[1:55:44] even and said take eat this is my body
[1:55:46] which is broken for you this doing
[1:55:48] remembrance of me
[1:55:51] after this same manner also after this
[1:55:54] same manner also he took the cup when he
[1:55:57] accepted saying this cup is the New
[1:55:59] Testament in my blood this due as often
[1:56:01] as you drink it in remembrance of me for
[1:56:03] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:56:05] this cup you do shoot the Lord's death
[1:56:07] till he cometh wherefore whosoever shall
[1:56:10] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:56:12] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:56:15] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:56:18] examine himself and show let him eat of
[1:56:20] that bread and drink of that cup so he
[1:56:22] didn't eat it then drinketh unworthily
[1:56:24] eateth and drink of damnation to himself
[1:56:26] not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:56:28] for this cause meant or this cause many
[1:56:31] are weak and sickly among you in many
[1:56:33] sleep
[1:56:34] for we would judge ourselves we should
[1:56:35] not be judged but when we are judged we
[1:56:37] are chastened of the Lord that we should
[1:56:39] not be condemned with the world
[1:56:41] we're for my brethren when you come
[1:56:43] together to eat carry one for another
[1:56:45] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:56:48] home that you come not together under
[1:56:50] condemnation and the rest will I said in
[1:56:52] order when I come so let's just have a
[1:56:55] few moments
[1:56:56] of solid prayer just pray in one for
[1:56:58] another remember these that are sick
[1:57:00] among us I think and just pray that God
[1:57:03] will
[1:57:04] make manifest his word in the healings
[1:57:07] of the bodies and the Deliverance of the
[1:57:09] souls and set us all free in him all
[1:57:12] right
[1:57:13] thank you
[1:57:31] thank you Father for your word your word
[1:57:34] is true we ask you now that you would
[1:57:36] just come and just be with us as we go
[1:57:39] into the communion Lord
[1:57:41] remember those that are sick among us
[1:57:43] because you said you sent your word and
[1:57:44] healed us and delivered us from
[1:57:46] destruction
[1:57:48] we know Sister Thomas our Lord their
[1:57:50] blood pressure is just
[1:57:52] line up 200 and all like that Lord and
[1:57:55] it's a dangerous thing
[1:57:57] we plead the blood of our Lord and
[1:57:59] savior over her Lord at this time and
[1:58:02] believing that you'll take care of
[1:58:04] everything make all well
[1:58:06] we thank you and we just commit
[1:58:08] everything into your hands now forgive
[1:58:10] our sins and lead us by that
[1:58:11] understanding
[1:58:13] and guide us in Jesus name
[1:58:16] amen
[1:58:18] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:58:20] it
[1:58:21] father we thank you that this bread Lord
[1:58:24] has went through the part of being
[1:58:26] cooked and made to word that can be
[1:58:28] consumed into the human body
[1:58:31] and we believe we believe you've done
[1:58:33] that you went through a life
[1:58:35] you paid a price
[1:58:36] and you became that bread of life
[1:58:40] that word Lord and may our thoughts be
[1:58:42] solely upon Thy Word
[1:58:44] that you were the word and Lord and we
[1:58:47] pray that you would just
[1:58:49] in making our understanding be there
[1:58:52] and we'd see this is not your body this
[1:58:55] is only in representation that your body
[1:58:58] is really the word but we eat upon these
[1:59:00] natural things as an example so we ask
[1:59:03] you to just bless each one that pertains
[1:59:05] sanctify the bread and the partakers in
[1:59:08] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:59:24] thousands of years mankind has been
[1:59:27] through
[1:59:29] these things
[1:59:31] and what confusion has come out of it
[1:59:36] some people in the message even don't
[1:59:38] take the communion because they say the
[1:59:39] Lord's already come
[1:59:43] you know
[1:59:44] some believe it and they would life it
[1:59:47] the ones who believe that it is the
[1:59:49] literal body
[1:59:50] in the blood of the Lord but what would
[1:59:52] be the difference in your thoughts well
[1:59:55] why would it be any different What would
[1:59:59] why can't we just see what it is it
[2:00:01] represents
[2:00:03] and in representation
[2:00:06] then we can believe the truth
[2:00:09] thank God for the truth right father we
[2:00:11] thank you for this wine this went
[2:00:13] through the process and gets better each
[2:00:15] day we ask you now that you would
[2:00:17] sanctify the wine it represents your
[2:00:19] blood and Lord as we eat the little
[2:00:21] piece of bread and then as we drink this
[2:00:24] little little bit of wine that tomorrow
[2:00:26] it'll be blood cells in our body for us
[2:00:28] to live by and we thank you you died to
[2:00:31] pay the price now sanctify us the
[2:00:33] protakers that we may all be won
[2:00:35] together in you in Jesus name
[2:00:43] good morning

[2:01:13] for him
[2:01:16] sometimes I'm
[2:01:18] despise
[2:01:20] and rejected
[2:01:23] and I question how
[2:01:31] did I take one immortal
[2:01:36] at Mount Calvary
[2:01:40] and it gives me the strength to go on
[2:01:47] come morning

[2:02:29] he's not left us in blind darkness and
[2:02:32] wondering
[2:02:36] we might not like sometimes the answers
[2:02:38] we get but
[2:02:39] we know that they're perfect and
[2:02:46] they can't be added too
[2:02:48] and he couldn't change it
