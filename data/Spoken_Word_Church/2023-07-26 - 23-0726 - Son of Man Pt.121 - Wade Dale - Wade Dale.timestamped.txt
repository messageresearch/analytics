[11:01] them with love Lord good to see Anderson

[11:06] sister David back what sister David
[11:08] brother David's back with us sister
[11:10] David good to have you back buddy
[11:13] gonna have them back with us amen
[11:16] if you got your Bibles let's turn to
[11:18] John 1
[11:20] and we'll continue on uh I would I was
[11:23] preaching a little bit on the Statue of
[11:24] perfect man this weekend on uh brotherly
[11:27] kindness and I kind of you know felt
[11:29] home so I just kind of drilled him a
[11:31] little bit you know and sister
[11:33] um
[11:34] what's her name Rita Montgomery
[11:36] afterwards she come out and she was
[11:38] stepping like she was stepping over
[11:39] stuff in in the aisle and I said what
[11:41] are you doing
[11:42] she said I'm stepping over all this
[11:44] loose skin laying on the on the ground
[11:46] that we got shaved off during the
[11:49] service today so just uh step over to
[11:52] loose skin as you go outside because
[11:54] we're still going to talk about
[11:54] brotherly kindness uh take it a little
[11:57] bit different angle with it because
[11:59] there was a time in the Bible
[12:03] where there was a prophet and a real
[12:05] good Holy Ghost Field man
[12:09] they parted ways
[12:13] Paul and Barnabas
[12:15] they had such a sharp contention so that
[12:17] one went one way and one with the other
[12:19] but they were both Holy Ghost Field
[12:20] people so let's let's uh let's look at
[12:23] that and um and see what we can come you
[12:27] know you gotta it's got to be a balance
[12:28] like brother George Smith said you know
[12:30] he brings his rule he brings his level
[12:32] with him and lays it out you know it's
[12:34] got to have a balance well you do have
[12:35] to have a balance you can't get run over
[12:37] but you got to have brotherly kindness
[12:39] and love them whether they love you or
[12:41] not all right and as brother Ryan said
[12:43] our Ruth Camp is going to be this coming
[12:45] weekend that'll be when all the
[12:46] missionaries come and if you want to go
[12:48] we're going Thursday and Friday come
[12:50] back Saturday with brother Keith Reed
[12:51] and sister Francine's coming with you so
[12:54] we sure
[12:55] uh the girls are not going to get to
[12:57] come they didn't renew their visa in
[12:58] time so they're not coming but it's at
[13:01] Francine and Keith will be here with us
[13:03] probably three or four days all right
[13:06] this coming Saturday
[13:09] not this coming Saturday the next
[13:11] Saturday
[13:12] which will be August the 6th or 7th or
[13:14] something we'll have in Bible study all
[13:16] right brother Keith will be here
[13:19] so we'll have Bible study but we're
[13:21] going to have prayer meeting from five
[13:22] to six I know some of you hadn't wanted
[13:24] to do that
[13:25] uh to not have too many Saturdays coming
[13:27] up here and and also we'll start at five
[13:30] o'clock we'll open up Saturday at five
[13:32] o'clock and between five and six you can
[13:34] come up here and pray for the meetings
[13:36] coming up we've got brother Jason
[13:38] Jackson coming brother Keith will be
[13:40] here that Sunday and then we've got
[13:42] several other meetings coming up with
[13:44] brother uh Andrew Glover in September
[13:47] the third Saturday there will be our
[13:49] youth service so we're expecting a good
[13:52] time but but that will be from five to
[13:54] six not this coming Saturday
[13:57] the next Saturday all right
[13:59] and then from six to eight we'll have
[14:01] Bible study I've got several good
[14:03] questions already
[14:05] um to uh to discuss so we're going to
[14:07] try to do that we sure do appreciate
[14:09] people I think it's good to go down and
[14:11] ask questions but it's good already to
[14:13] give them a little bit ahead of time so
[14:15] you can study a little bit and get some
[14:16] quotes together and all that and also I
[14:19] want this coming Sunday
[14:21] um we we're at the part of the Statue of
[14:24] perfect man at brotherly kindness I know
[14:25] some of you kind of got in at the middle
[14:28] or last or whatever but uh and go back
[14:31] and watch them that's why they put them
[14:32] online but that Holy Spirit right there
[14:35] we're going to really talk about it
[14:36] Sunday we're going to talk about the the
[14:38] baptism of the Holy Spirit and then
[14:41] brother Branham talks about the true
[14:42] baptism not that the bottom one's false
[14:46] but it's a quote I'm gonna quote the
[14:48] quote to you probably tonight if we get
[14:50] to it but that's what we're going to
[14:51] focus on Sunday is number one do you
[14:54] have that Holy Ghost at the bottom now
[14:57] if you do then we're we're going to look
[14:59] at the anointings that you have that are
[15:02] virtual knowledge Temperance patients
[15:03] and then that Holy Spirit at the top of
[15:05] the pyramid it's very very important
[15:08] you can't go any further The Headstone
[15:10] can't come you can't get a revelation of
[15:12] the son of man without that so you can't
[15:15] be a baby you've got to be an adult
[15:17] that's why we've been speaking for 121
[15:19] Services now and brother Dale's been
[15:21] doing it for way more than that to try
[15:23] to get us to grow up
[15:24] the the ministry in this message is a
[15:27] growth Ministry it's to it's to grow
[15:29] it's to not be babies is not to be a
[15:31] bunch of sniffling
[15:32] um youngins but to be able to eat meat
[15:35] all right and if you're not then if
[15:37] you've been here long enough and you're
[15:39] not then it ain't brother Dale's fault
[15:42] it ain't God's fault
[15:44] so whose fault is it so it's my it's our
[15:47] fault that we're not in position we need
[15:49] to be because we all need to be in
[15:50] position if we don't then we're going to
[15:52] get left behind
[15:54] all right so let's look at part 121
[15:58] on the cinema you can't see that can you
[16:01] okay
[16:09] technology
[16:22] for the older ones in the back there you
[16:24] go
[16:27] all right so let's read and then we'll
[16:30] pray in the beginning was the word word
[16:31] with God
[16:33] the Word was God and that word was made
[16:35] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[16:37] his glory to go the only begotten of the
[16:39] father full of grace and truth remember
[16:41] that flesh that flesh had to be
[16:44] perfected because it was not perfect
[16:47] Jesus Christ's flesh was not was not
[16:50] Eternal it was not perfect
[16:52] all right it had to be made perfect as
[16:55] the Bible says and going and growing in
[16:57] Grace and knowledge so if he did I know
[16:58] we do all right so let's power his Lord
[17:01] thank you for this evening
[17:02] little the weight Lord may we just talk
[17:04] about you for a few minutes and be
[17:06] settled down here father and just hear
[17:08] from you Lord I pray this should be with
[17:10] the ones that are sick the ones that are
[17:11] not with us tonight Lord the ones that
[17:13] are sinsick Lord more than anything
[17:15] father I pray for our spiritual healing
[17:17] of the soul lord we love having
[17:21] um the healing of the body but Lord I
[17:23] pray that you the ones Lord that are as
[17:26] we're talking about some may not know
[17:27] what the Holy Ghost is and how to get it
[17:29] and all those things it's been taught so
[17:31] many different ways brother Brown said
[17:32] it's very ill-taught subject 50 60 years
[17:35] ago and it still is but I pray Lord that
[17:38] you would just break back the scales
[17:39] from our eyes just for a few minutes and
[17:41] let us see you father just give us this
[17:43] day our daily bread in Jesus name we
[17:45] pray amen you can be seated God bless
[17:47] you I'm good see Sister Mary back with
[17:49] us I told her she should have got a red
[17:50] dress
[17:54] instrument yeah just remember too
[17:56] brother Jason Jackson is going to be
[17:57] here the second weekend and we're going
[18:00] to have a Saturday night service at six
[18:02] o'clock and a Sunday one service
[18:06] uh brother Dutch and his uh crew are
[18:09] going to come be with us that Saturday
[18:10] as far as I know so also too just for
[18:15] FYI I went
[18:17] um
[18:18] you know I went last Wednesday and had a
[18:20] uh a scan of the prostate and they did
[18:23] find something so that's something
[18:25] they're going to go in and do a biopsy
[18:28] and see what's going on so
[18:31] um not worried about it but still
[18:34] let's pray about it
[18:36] I do not like those biopsies if you may
[18:38] have never had one please don't ever get
[18:41] one well you need to be screened but but
[18:44] as we get older uh it ain't fun I know
[18:48] your sisters have to go through all the
[18:49] mammograms and all this stuff like that
[18:50] but we do have to go through certain
[18:52] things like that too so just keep me in
[18:54] prayer and uh they're going to do it
[18:56] within the next couple of months and the
[18:59] doctors didn't seem real concerned but
[19:01] he was concerned enough to where we're
[19:03] going to go further and have a another
[19:04] biopsy there was a two small spots there
[19:08] that shouldn't be there so so
[19:10] Philippians 2 verse 3 says let nothing
[19:13] be done through Strife for vain Glory
[19:14] but in aloneness of mine Let each esteem
[19:17] other better than themselves we have got
[19:20] to get away from self
[19:22] we have got to get away from selfish all
[19:25] right selfies that says whole world is
[19:27] nothing but selfish we're all selfish
[19:29] look you take a little kid take a little
[19:31] kid and put them downstairs put three
[19:32] kids together give them one toy
[19:37] and let it be one of them's toy
[19:40] and not the other two
[19:42] well I don't have to say anymore if you
[19:44] had kids I'll promise you you know what
[19:46] I'm talking about there's going to be a
[19:48] fight called mine
[19:50] that's mine
[19:52] why because they've grown up selfish
[19:55] so as adults we shouldn't be that way
[19:57] though so if if we have something let's
[20:01] share it so let's share the word of God
[20:02] let's share let's share our experience
[20:04] let's share
[20:06] um the Lord with people
[20:08] um I was today or yesterday I believe
[20:11] yeah yesterday I was at the restaurant
[20:13] there in Gillsville
[20:15] and that was a brother a man there that
[20:17] was uh he's a retired police officer and
[20:19] he wants to get in the city so we were
[20:21] talking about getting in the city and
[20:22] and all the things and he asked me what
[20:24] I did besides you know he said and you
[20:26] he knew I worked at post office because
[20:28] I didn't run his mail every once in a
[20:30] while but he said what else do you do I
[20:32] said well we got a little church up here
[20:33] in Lula Georgia out on the main on the
[20:36] highway here
[20:37] he said William Branham
[20:44] I said how'd you know that him and Mike
[20:46] Canada had been together forever
[20:50] he said I believe that baptism he said
[20:52] they ain't father ain't no title I mean
[20:54] father is a title it ain't no name and
[20:57] he said that trinitarian Doctrine he
[20:58] said I don't see it he said but now I
[20:59] don't see that brother Brown was the
[21:01] only Prophet we need to listen to I said
[21:03] well that's okay we can start there
[21:04] there was no pushback there was nothing
[21:06] you know but he had been with brother
[21:08] Mike Canada and doing some things while
[21:10] he I guess while he was on patrol here
[21:11] in Gainesville now he's retired and
[21:14] lives in guildsville so we're going to
[21:15] speak further all right so at least
[21:17] there was no you know pushback but he
[21:19] knew about the church here because as
[21:21] soon as I said that he said William
[21:22] Branham so he knew that um that we
[21:25] believe that God did send us a prophet
[21:27] and we do believe he's the only Prophet
[21:29] but there are prophets in the five-fold
[21:30] ministry that's why I told him I said
[21:31] you can't take there's prophet in the
[21:33] file for Ministry but there's Major
[21:35] Prophets to each generation and I said
[21:36] we just believe he was the major prophet
[21:38] to this generation according to the
[21:40] Bible and he said okay and you know we
[21:43] kind of had to go separate ways and but
[21:45] just pray that uh that we'll say the
[21:47] right thing and uh he's just a real good
[21:50] guy and uh he's not very old for to be
[21:53] retired he must start real young
[21:55] so First Corinthians 2 verse 12. now we
[21:59] have received not the spirit of the
[22:00] world but the spirit which is of god now
[22:02] see we receive the spirit of the world
[22:04] that's what we're going to get to about
[22:05] the Holy Ghost we receive the spirit of
[22:06] the world when you were born your
[22:08] natural birth puts you in the spiritual
[22:11] part of the world
[22:12] the worldly part all right then what
[22:15] happened you had to be transferred or
[22:18] that kuckleber
[22:19] nature had to be burned out of you and
[22:22] had to be a wheat nature put in but you
[22:25] still look like the same kookaburra
[22:28] all right everybody with me but the
[22:30] spirit which is of god now we have
[22:32] received now he's telling the
[22:33] Corinthians that we might know the
[22:35] things that are freely given to us of
[22:36] God which things also we speak not in
[22:39] The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but
[22:41] which the Holy Ghost teaches now when
[22:43] the Holy Ghost teaches us something
[22:44] brother George it's always right
[22:48] it's all what you can depend on that now
[22:50] you can't depend on man but you can
[22:51] depend on the Holy Ghost because he's
[22:53] going to teach you and it says look
[22:55] comparing spiritual things with
[22:57] spiritual and brother around tells us
[22:59] and I'm not going to read it but that we
[23:01] are supposed to be spiritual people
[23:03] amen we're supposed to have spiritual
[23:05] Insight we're supposed to be Eagles
[23:06] we're supposed to be little Messiahs
[23:08] brother Ram told us and we've had these
[23:10] things told to us for years and years
[23:11] and years when are we going to start
[23:12] believing that it's happening to this
[23:14] generation it's happening to you and me
[23:15] not for somebody else it's happening now
[23:18] all right and it's happening to somebody
[23:19] whether you see it or not you say I
[23:21] don't see anything well maybe it's not
[23:23] for you
[23:25] sorry how can you say you're not seeing
[23:28] anything and we've got the word of God
[23:30] coming every Sunday and every Wednesday
[23:31] all these brothers
[23:33] um I learned one thing for sure don't
[23:35] don't go reach for a doorknob in a car
[23:39] if the Lord tells you not to
[23:41] ask Bob
[23:43] it's embarrassing though you had to go
[23:45] back in to get the key from my bless
[23:47] your heart it'd be all right
[23:50] and I'm sure Monica's like what are you
[23:52] doing
[23:54] I need the keys
[23:59] life lesson number you did some life
[24:01] lessons don't do that
[24:03] especially when you don't have the key
[24:04] in your pocket
[24:05] so now just for a second we're going to
[24:07] look and see it is hot up here the the
[24:09] birth
[24:10] is not the anointing
[24:13] and the birth the new birth is not
[24:18] the adoption
[24:21] but it's all intertwined
[24:23] they're by with me though you get
[24:25] everything you need at your new birth
[24:27] now that when I say the birth that means
[24:29] the new birth that means that the the
[24:31] life of God is now inside of you
[24:36] not on you in you that's the difference
[24:39] in the anointing the anointing we we
[24:41] talked about it up at uh up in Tennessee
[24:44] uh
[24:45] at brother Andres and he said to tell
[24:48] you hello again he really enjoyed him
[24:49] we've been texting back and forth for
[24:52] the last several days so he said tell
[24:53] you hello and he really enjoyed the
[24:56] services but there is an anointing that
[24:58] it's a true anointing of the Holy
[25:02] holy God is God
[25:04] it's the true Holy Ghost but it will
[25:07] anoint a person that's totally false
[25:10] that won't let God in their soul
[25:13] I said that won't let God in their soul
[25:15] so it's what you decide you can be and
[25:18] that's that's the whole thing I see is
[25:20] we're going to talk about it Sunday
[25:21] and we'll read it if we get to it but
[25:24] there was a time when Paul was in the
[25:26] upper coast of Ephesus and he finds a
[25:28] group of believers
[25:30] believers
[25:32] and he said if you received the Holy
[25:33] Ghost since you believed they said what
[25:36] are you talking about
[25:37] well see let's bring that to now
[25:40] there's a lot of people in this message
[25:42] when you tell them that they go what do
[25:43] you mean I've been in a message for 45
[25:45] years I live by John quote brother
[25:49] Brown's message
[25:51] they know what they said Paul said how
[25:53] are you baptizing oh we were baptized
[25:55] unto unto John what's great he's a
[25:57] prophet he was the third coming of
[25:59] Elijah that sounds wonderful but Paul
[26:02] says ain't gonna work this day
[26:05] you got to go further you got to get the
[26:07] Holy Ghost and they said well tell us
[26:09] about it so Paul I believe it wasn't
[26:11] just two scriptures I believe Paul
[26:12] expounded on the Holy Ghost laid his
[26:15] hands on him and Holy Ghost came on him
[26:16] because they were what they were sincere
[26:19] and they wanted the word of God they
[26:20] just had nobody teach it to him right
[26:24] so we'll read it this Sunday where
[26:26] brother Brown said it's the most
[26:27] ill-taught subject in the in in the
[26:29] Bible is the new birth and we'll get to
[26:32] it in just a minute but the anointing
[26:34] that you can be anointed by the devil
[26:37] all right
[26:39] most of y'all and me have been anointed
[26:42] by the devil a lot in our life
[26:44] well I'll amen for all of you
[26:48] because he was the first anointed cherub
[26:51] he was the man that God put right beside
[26:54] of him that says you're my anointed
[26:55] cherub you are going to be head anointer
[27:00] right
[27:01] it might no other you are the head
[27:04] anointer
[27:06] and look what happened he's the Bible
[27:08] says iniquity he says in Ezekiel he said
[27:11] you were perfect now this is God talking
[27:13] to the devil you know talking to Luther
[27:14] he said I made you perfect
[27:16] I made you to be the anointed cherub
[27:19] that I would send by anoint send my
[27:22] anointing through to the people
[27:26] boy does he not but he don't do it God's
[27:28] way does it his own way
[27:30] a little bit of selfishness come about
[27:32] he wanted to be God he didn't want to be
[27:35] he didn't want to be beside the Lord he
[27:37] wanted to be the Lord
[27:39] amen
[27:40] so there's an anointing there and we'll
[27:42] talk about in just a little bit so in
[27:44] the adoption series though brother Brown
[27:46] said what is adoption and that's what
[27:48] we're going to get to because adoption
[27:49] is up there above brotherly kindness
[27:51] where the Holy Spirit moles and and
[27:53] covers everything and we'll read it in a
[27:55] little bit but remember brother Brown
[27:56] says your adoption is not your birth
[27:59] all right you receive the spirit of
[28:02] adoption according to Romans 8 you
[28:04] receive the spirit of adoption whereby
[28:05] you cry daddy daddy well you're not
[28:07] going to cry anymore if you become an
[28:10] adult all right everybody with me so
[28:12] you've got your new birth you've got an
[28:15] anointing to that new birth
[28:18] then you've got an adoption that covers
[28:21] unto that new birth but you can be
[28:24] you can have the new birth and not be
[28:26] adopted
[28:27] you can have the new birth and you can
[28:29] be anointed by the devil
[28:33] come on
[28:34] I thank God for a for a prophet that
[28:36] told us that if if uh if a brother took
[28:39] took their life right well you know boy
[28:41] you tell that to a Baptist now Baptist
[28:43] will tell you if you commit suicide
[28:45] you're going to hell
[28:46] I mean straight shot right to it you ask
[28:48] them ain't no chance no way well thank
[28:51] God he sent us a prophet they told us
[28:54] that you could be anointed in your in
[28:56] your spirit realm so much by the devil
[28:58] until you turn yourself over to that and
[29:00] you commit suicide but you can be a holy
[29:03] ghost Phil person all right so everybody
[29:05] with me on that
[29:07] but your adoption is not your birth your
[29:09] adoption is your placing
[29:11] now remember brother Ryan said when
[29:12] you're born again you're born of the
[29:14] spirit of God and you're sons of God but
[29:16] will your predestinated who was
[29:17] predestinated only this age was
[29:20] predestinated to come to full adoption
[29:23] hear ye him make your name on the
[29:26] checkbook just as good as God's he
[29:29] didn't give that to any other age a
[29:31] little bit in Paul's age
[29:33] a little bit in Irene is his age but
[29:35] remember it got lost down through the
[29:37] church ages well now it's going to be
[29:38] brought back brother round said brought
[29:40] back by the word of God is going to
[29:42] bring it back the full word of God so
[29:45] your adoption is your placing is not
[29:46] your birth but now listen you can't get
[29:49] adopted without having the new birth
[29:51] right right but you can't be anointed by
[29:54] different things you can be anointed by
[29:55] the Holy Ghost listen how can somebody
[29:58] stand here and preach the message an
[29:59] hour for 30 years and have a church with
[30:02] 350 400 people
[30:06] and turn around one day and deny this
[30:08] message
[30:10] he married him he buried him he baptized
[30:12] them
[30:13] all during that tenure now you tell me
[30:16] he's got the Holy Ghost I don't know
[30:18] I'll let God deal with that but it sure
[30:19] don't look like it
[30:21] talk to One preacher this coming last
[30:23] weekend and he said he said I just truly
[30:24] believe he blessed Fame the Holy Ghost I
[30:26] said well okay you can say that but I'm
[30:28] still going to pray for the brother
[30:29] I mean I'm still going to pray if
[30:31] there's a chance like this guess what
[30:32] with you there's a chance like this too
[30:35] all right
[30:36] amen all of us
[30:39] we need Grace
[30:41] now look we were predestinated unto
[30:43] adoptions so we're heading toward that
[30:45] we can do it
[30:47] other ages couldn't do it but we can do
[30:50] it because we have the word of God
[30:51] listen we have this is to me this is the
[30:54] this is the um I don't want to say that
[30:58] no I don't want to say that but this is
[31:01] not the image
[31:04] that the other ages had
[31:06] but that's the image that we have
[31:10] brother Branham I mean Paul Peter tells
[31:13] us every one of these add to your faith
[31:14] verse Universal knowledge and all those
[31:16] temperaments but it took a prophet to
[31:18] bring that thing together so that we can
[31:20] say that's a stature of a perfect man
[31:23] and it's connected with the pyramid
[31:25] because there's a headstone that was
[31:26] rejected there was a Cornerstone that
[31:29] started the message
[31:32] and all that it's not it's not just a
[31:34] pretty picture
[31:36] I was thinking just a little while ago
[31:38] this is not something that's just it's
[31:40] required
[31:42] it's not something to feel 121 times we
[31:45] got on on uh YouTube
[31:49] but we were predestinated somebody is
[31:51] going to preach us to adoption
[31:54] somebody is going to preach us to the
[31:56] body change somebody is going to have an
[32:00] anointing that won't come off that'll
[32:02] stay on us and we will not die and I
[32:05] mean laity too I'm not talking about
[32:07] just the preachers I'm talking about
[32:08] laity somebody is going to catch this
[32:10] thing
[32:13] foreign
[32:14] it's not me I'm not standing away from
[32:15] somebody that can
[32:17] lead follow get out of the way right
[32:19] so the River Jordan we know that that
[32:21] was a position when when Jesus Come On
[32:23] the River Jordan I'm kind of
[32:26] backgrounding for this weekend so I hope
[32:28] you remember between now and Sunday
[32:29] River Jordan experience a was a type
[32:32] remember
[32:34] need the Holy Ghost
[32:36] right he was born Lord to Christ he was
[32:38] born Emmanuel he didn't he wasn't born a
[32:41] regular man and then he walked around
[32:43] with a soul that wasn't God
[32:46] his soul was almighty God and His Spirit
[32:49] was a spirit that's 100 times in diverse
[32:51] manners that speak through the prophets
[32:52] or the Holy Spirit you got inside of you
[32:55] everybody with me all right then he had
[32:57] a human body but he had to go to the
[32:59] River Jordan to what to fulfill the Old
[33:02] Testament actually because remember the
[33:05] sacrifice when John said Behold the Lamb
[33:07] of God it takes away the sin of the
[33:09] world he was identifying there's the
[33:11] lamb
[33:12] and that lamb has got to be washed
[33:14] before it can be sacrificed
[33:16] so that's why I had to be baptized he
[33:18] had to be washed as a Sacrifice by a
[33:22] prophet or by somebody like Moses had to
[33:24] wash them get them ready but that wasn't
[33:27] here ye him because remember God spoke
[33:30] and there was this fluttering of look
[33:31] like a dove it wasn't a dub it looked
[33:33] like a dove it was it was something that
[33:36] floated down that John saw because he
[33:38] was a prophet John saw it with his own
[33:40] eyes in another dimension he saw it come
[33:43] on him and stay there and not lift off
[33:45] of him
[33:46] and we'll read that this coming Sunday
[33:49] but that was not here you him even God
[33:52] to to his own flesh person
[33:55] God Almighty human flesh he'd say here
[33:58] you him at that time
[33:59] because he had to grow in Grace and
[34:01] knowledge
[34:03] that's what the Bible says
[34:05] he was a human
[34:07] but now he did come to a time where
[34:09] there was a mount Transfiguration
[34:12] place that he had to come to to where
[34:14] now he said this is my beloved Son whom
[34:16] I'm pleased to dwell there was a cloud
[34:18] come down over them
[34:22] there was a cloud come down over him and
[34:24] said now here ye him
[34:26] six months before he went to Calvary but
[34:30] remember in Matthew 24 he preached the
[34:31] seal right before they took him to
[34:33] Calvary he couldn't preach those seals
[34:35] with that other anointing on him he
[34:37] preached the seals when he said here ye
[34:38] him
[34:40] just like brother Brown same way brother
[34:42] I'm had to come to the hear you him part
[34:44] so that we could get what we got from
[34:46] him so we've been talking about Moses
[34:48] and different ones they had we were
[34:50] talking about power without character so
[34:51] let's put this word in here power
[34:53] without the Holy Ghost in their soul
[34:56] because remember the holy ghost in your
[34:58] soul is your Rudder it's your spiritual
[35:01] um uh it's your spiritual Rudder it's
[35:03] what turns you when you start trying to
[35:05] do something wrong and it
[35:08] don't touch that doorknob on that car
[35:13] you said that wasn't the holy ghost that
[35:14] was just no I I wore or if you're led by
[35:17] the spirit of God you're the sons of God
[35:18] right
[35:19] now some of the dumb stuff we do I don't
[35:21] think that we can blame that on the Holy
[35:23] Ghost all right blame that on ourself
[35:26] not even the devil
[35:28] so Moses had power without the Holy
[35:30] Ghost and his soul so he could kill
[35:31] somebody he had a Killer Instinct hey
[35:33] I'm sorry he did David too David had a
[35:36] lot of spirit on him
[35:38] so did Samson
[35:41] Abraham lied a couple of times
[35:44] Jacob Noah we talked about it before
[35:46] Saul Elisha all the different ones they
[35:49] had power because God had anointed them
[35:51] to do a job
[35:53] all right so he would anoint Elisha and
[35:55] Elisha would do a job but that anointing
[35:57] stayed so close to Elisha that two
[36:00] things happened in Elisha's life number
[36:02] one was is he got mad
[36:04] when those kids were calling him old
[36:06] ball head and 42 kids died because of
[36:10] that prophet
[36:13] then Elisha died and he still had so
[36:16] much of the Holy Ghost in his bones so
[36:17] they throw the dead man down there and a
[36:19] dead man come to life all right let's
[36:22] don't try that
[36:26] but watch so that's anointed in the Old
[36:29] Testament Jesus come he was the Holy
[36:31] Ghost he was our example he was this but
[36:33] he had to be anointed for a Ministry
[36:35] something did come on him at the River
[36:37] Jordan and it stayed on him and the
[36:39] Bible said and remained all right so
[36:40] we'll talk about that Sunday I'm trying
[36:43] to get a little bit of basis so you can
[36:44] kind of get it rolled around in your
[36:45] head because listen the Holy Ghost is
[36:47] the most important thing in your life
[36:50] whether you got it or not you've got to
[36:53] know that you know that you know before
[36:55] you even start
[36:58] with these virtues
[37:00] but listen with the Holy Ghost you can
[37:02] catch up real quick because God said he
[37:03] wouldn't leave anybody behind
[37:05] if you make yourself available I promise
[37:07] you God will give it to you he'll pour
[37:09] it in if you just want it bad enough
[37:13] now notice in this now David thought he
[37:15] had everything in order now remember
[37:16] what brother Ryan was talking about
[37:17] remember David David was a prophet
[37:20] he was a man after God's Own Heart
[37:23] but he got a little he got a little
[37:25] self-righteous
[37:27] I said oh I'm bringing the art back this
[37:30] is wonderful
[37:32] I'm sitting in a message Church
[37:34] got the best popular preacher no I'm not
[37:36] going there but anyway so he he we don't
[37:41] have that here so how the Holy Spirit
[37:42] can anoint a man but he was inspired
[37:45] what happened instead of going by what
[37:47] God had said
[37:49] right that thing had to be carried by
[37:51] the preachers or the priests right
[37:54] he said oh put it on a cart I want to
[37:57] hear now don't I don't have time to send
[37:58] a priest that sounds good
[38:01] but brother Brown said he was out of the
[38:02] will of God
[38:04] and a man died because of David's
[38:09] inspired
[38:12] order that he wanted that thing back
[38:14] which it was the ark of God but he
[38:16] wasn't supposed to be touched by anybody
[38:18] said see how the Holy Spirit can anoint
[38:20] a man but it's got to be in the order of
[38:22] the anointing the outside Spirit can be
[38:25] annoying with the Holy Ghost and the
[38:26] Soul as dark as pitch
[38:32] false teachers can rise teaching all
[38:34] kinds of trinitarian ideas or whatever
[38:36] you want to call in the message now and
[38:38] be Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[38:40] and perform just as many miracles as the
[38:43] true gospel can but by the word here
[38:46] that's what does it that's why that
[38:48] brother Dale has harped on the word the
[38:50] word the word the word because if you
[38:52] don't get the word
[38:53] you can be fooled
[38:56] you can be fooled we're all food we'll
[38:58] have the word of God we're all fool
[39:00] without the truth raw food without the
[39:03] Holy Ghost in our soul
[39:07] Ephesians 4 verse 6 is one God and
[39:09] Father of all who is above all through
[39:11] all and in you all but unto every one of
[39:13] us is given Grace according to the
[39:15] measure of the gift of Christ thank God
[39:17] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[39:19] on high now what he when he ascended
[39:21] upon high he led captivity captive and
[39:24] gave gifts unto men that was Jesus when
[39:25] he resurrected come up through the Old
[39:27] Testament took Paradise up and took him
[39:30] up into a place all right they're by
[39:31] with me wherefore now you didn't stay
[39:34] there though wherefore he saith when he
[39:36] ascended up on high he led captivity
[39:38] captive and gave gifts unto men now Paul
[39:41] stops and interpolates with the
[39:43] quotation or the exclamation not the
[39:45] exclamation but the parentheses now that
[39:47] he ascended what is it but they also
[39:50] descended into the lower parts of the
[39:52] earth so it first went down picked them
[39:54] up brought them out but now look he that
[39:56] descended is a sign one that ascended uh
[40:00] far above all Heavens that he might fill
[40:02] all things so where did he go he went to
[40:05] a dimension but he sent the Holy Ghost
[40:07] back how
[40:09] that red right there
[40:13] that's what he sent us he sent us
[40:16] Apostles Prophets
[40:18] evangelists pastors and teachers for
[40:21] what for the Perfection of the Saints
[40:24] for the edifying
[40:26] for the work of the ministry for the
[40:28] edifying of the body of Christ look till
[40:30] we all
[40:32] come to the unity of faith and of the
[40:34] knowledge of the Son of God and to a
[40:35] perfect man statue of perfect man unto
[40:38] the measure of the Statue of the
[40:39] fullness of Christ that will help forth
[40:40] be more white no more children
[40:42] talks to and fro and carried away with
[40:44] every window Doctrine by the slight of
[40:46] man and cunning craftness where they
[40:48] lying way to deceive but speaking look
[40:50] the truth in love
[40:52] May grow up into him in All Things
[40:55] which is the head even Christ from which
[40:58] the whole body fitly joined together and
[41:00] compacted by that whichever joint
[41:02] supplies compacted according to the
[41:05] effectual working and the measure of
[41:07] every part makeeth look increase
[41:10] we're flourishing because of what we
[41:13] believe
[41:14] or we're not
[41:18] or we're not
[41:20] but we should flourish it's like the
[41:22] sister up there I don't know if you
[41:24] watch the the YouTube video of me
[41:27] speaking up there but there was a sister
[41:29] sister Linda we known her since she's a
[41:31] little kid and um she told me she said
[41:34] well wait she said my kid you know she
[41:35] had a kid or two that was out in the
[41:37] world she said I've done everything she
[41:39] said I went through all and did
[41:41] everything
[41:43] I go to church I read my Bible I pray
[41:46] I do this I do that I pay my time I do
[41:49] all that
[41:50] she said God's got to honor
[41:54] my prayer and she's right because what
[41:56] will happen is that will trigger God to
[41:58] have to do something
[42:00] if we'll approach it like that if we'll
[42:02] approach it like that that God that God
[42:04] you've said this
[42:06] because brother Adam said look what
[42:08] you've done at when you've done
[42:09] everything you know do what do you say
[42:11] Do stand stand right there and say God
[42:14] you promised it don't worry about hell
[42:16] or high water you stand there and you
[42:18] claim your kids claim your healing claim
[42:21] yourself that you're going to grow in
[42:23] the Statue of perfect man amen I can't
[42:26] do it you gotta do it yourself
[42:29] but thank God he give us a Ministry that
[42:31] can do it now look at what edifying
[42:32] means the act of one who promotes
[42:35] another's growth
[42:36] isn't that what this this church is
[42:38] built on that brother Mo brother Dale
[42:40] all the Ministries that's been in this
[42:42] building it is an edifying Ministry it's
[42:44] not something to tear somebody down oh
[42:46] sure sometimes people have you know bro
[42:49] they don't have to get he had to get a
[42:50] little
[42:51] um you know
[42:52] do a little surgery
[42:54] a little loose skin you know but you
[42:57] know what we were better because of it
[43:00] we were better because of it all right
[43:02] and you can't say you weren't
[43:04] you say you were worse and you need to
[43:05] go back and get the new birth
[43:07] because remember God if you're if you
[43:11] don't take correction you're what
[43:13] Ambassador child all right so you're not
[43:15] even in the body you're not even my
[43:17] brother or sister
[43:19] I'm just telling you what the Bible says
[43:20] the act of one who promotes another's
[43:22] growth in Christian wisdom piety
[43:24] happiness and Holiness so edifying has
[43:29] to come through a five-fold Ministry not
[43:32] pressing play
[43:35] am I in the wrong Church
[43:37] can somebody say a man
[43:40] that's weak
[43:43] I believe in press and play but I
[43:45] believe you got to have a five-fold
[43:46] Ministry people
[43:48] in flesh standing here looking at you
[43:51] and telling you what God Said
[43:54] because look as brother Dale said many
[43:56] years ago and I caught that and I hope
[43:58] that a lot of other people did because
[43:59] somebody quoted not too long ago these
[44:02] gifts were predestinated by God these
[44:05] are gifts to the church
[44:07] all right they're gifts to the church he
[44:09] wasn't given to one man sure brother
[44:10] Brown did fulfill all but when he passed
[44:13] on he gave it to the rest of the people
[44:15] because you can't take Ephesians out now
[44:17] watch brother Ryan said for the Bible
[44:18] said it was Apostles prophets evangelist
[44:21] teachers pastors all of these for the
[44:23] perfecting of the church God set them in
[44:26] the church now look there's nine
[44:28] spiritual gifts
[44:30] all right love joy peace and speaking of
[44:32] tongues
[44:34] they can all
[44:36] be given out by Satan
[44:41] brother Brown said Satan can pass out
[44:43] spiritual gifts
[44:44] like you wouldn't believe now there's
[44:46] nine spiritual gifts but now look
[44:48] they're not predestinated
[44:50] you can have them not have them
[44:52] if I never speak in tongues a day of my
[44:55] life I'm still born again
[44:57] okay so you understand they're they're
[44:59] they're they're needed we need them we
[45:01] should have them the gifts working in
[45:04] the church right
[45:05] but if you never speak in tongues a day
[45:07] in your life don't think you're dying
[45:08] going to hell because you missed that
[45:10] gift because but that gift wasn't
[45:12] predestinated but let me tell you
[45:13] something you won't make it without
[45:15] Apostles prophets pastoral teachers and
[45:17] evangelists I'll promise you that
[45:18] because that's what the Bible says look
[45:21] God set them into church now there's
[45:22] nine spiritual gifts that we can lay on
[45:24] hands and so forth and pray earnestly
[45:26] for the best gifts and so forth
[45:29] period but these others are
[45:32] predestinated gifts of God
[45:35] sets them in the church now who's going
[45:38] to take them out
[45:41] man's took them out God never took them
[45:44] out there's nowhere where God took them
[45:45] away
[45:47] Through the Ages that come John the
[45:48] Baptist was a special runner for that
[45:50] age God forordained them to do that work
[45:52] do you believe that sure he did he said
[45:55] do you go to see a prophet he said more
[45:57] than a prophet John didn't know that but
[45:59] Jesus knew it now listen
[46:01] hear you him 1958 brother Ryan said look
[46:03] speak the word Lord and he's praying
[46:06] if that would be sufficient
[46:08] but God's good
[46:10] he has said in the church gifts
[46:14] first apostles or missionaries both the
[46:17] same Apostle means one sin missionary
[46:18] means one sin Apostles prophets teachers
[46:21] evangelist pastors they're all
[46:23] predestinated gifts of God in other
[46:25] words they cannot change
[46:32] gifts and callings are without
[46:34] repentance
[46:36] so any of those gifts can be
[46:38] misinterpreted can be used by Satan
[46:42] and listen even Apostle prophets pastors
[46:44] and evangelists can be false but there
[46:46] is a true group because they're
[46:48] predestinated to get us somewhere
[46:49] they're predestinated to edifice they're
[46:52] predestinated to get us to the next
[46:54] level if you want to say that
[46:57] they're placed in the church look
[47:00] so who placed them in
[47:03] God
[47:04] man didn't
[47:06] but man's tried to take them out
[47:09] man can't take out what God put in
[47:13] gifts and callings are without
[47:14] repentance they're placed in the church
[47:16] to bring the church together hold it
[47:19] together for the glory of God
[47:23] that's why you see listen folks there's
[47:25] going to come a time whenever
[47:26] everybody's going to do what show who
[47:29] they are
[47:31] going to let it out one way or the other
[47:38] we just need
[47:41] the gifts that God gave us
[47:44] okay God give us gifts through men
[47:51] God give us gifts through men God didn't
[47:54] come in one man he did Christ Jesus yes
[47:57] he did but what did he tell you he was
[47:59] going to do I'm going to go away I'm
[48:01] going to come back and what I've got I'm
[48:02] going to give to you
[48:03] all right
[48:09] so let's look here just for a second
[48:10] brotherly kindness
[48:12] I'm trying not to leave so much skin on
[48:14] the floor
[48:16] but
[48:17] but we know what brother kindness is and
[48:19] and truly look if you call somebody a
[48:21] brother or sister denotes you from the
[48:23] same family so you when you say brother
[48:24] so and so or sister so and so you really
[48:27] mean that you mean that they're part of
[48:28] the family
[48:30] the real family of God all right John 13
[48:33] 34 now Jesus is standing he says a new
[48:35] commandment I give you
[48:37] that you love one another as I have
[48:39] loved you that you also
[48:41] love one another by this y'all look buy
[48:43] this now how you want men to know you
[48:49] how were they known as disciples in the
[48:54] early church
[48:55] they were called Christians because they
[48:58] acted like
[49:00] Caiaphas no they acted like Christ
[49:05] they were Christians in Antioch the
[49:07] Bible says so he said you're going to
[49:09] see that men know that ye are my
[49:11] disciples if you have love
[49:13] one to another in other words an outward
[49:16] display
[49:19] Matthew 5 verse 37 said but let your
[49:22] conversation be yeah yeah for whatsoever
[49:24] is more than these cometh of evil you
[49:26] have heard that it said now Jesus is
[49:28] Jesus talking you have heard that it's
[49:30] been said that thou shalt love thy
[49:32] neighbor and hate your enemy that's what
[49:33] the Old Testament said
[49:35] all right we moved over into a new
[49:37] commandment we didn't do away with the
[49:38] old commandment
[49:40] right because under the old commandment
[49:42] you hated your enemy because you didn't
[49:44] have the Holy Ghost you didn't have that
[49:46] kind of love in your heart
[49:49] God knew that so he put that in there so
[49:52] you know even if you murder somebody in
[49:54] the Old Testament and if you did it
[49:55] maliciously
[49:57] the family hunted you down and killed
[49:59] you
[50:00] but there was a refuge City there were
[50:02] six Refuge cities that if something
[50:04] happened even if even if you wanted to
[50:07] do it but there were some that if they
[50:09] even had an example that if an ax
[50:10] handled or an ax head falls off and hit
[50:12] somebody and kills them you can run in
[50:14] there to that City and find Refuge well
[50:17] praise God to us that in the New
[50:19] Testament that's Grace
[50:20] that's Grace
[50:23] because if you kill somebody's influence
[50:25] you've killed the brother right and that
[50:27] I've been guilty of that
[50:28] but you gotta make it right
[50:31] you have heard that's been said Thou
[50:32] shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine
[50:34] enemy but I say unto you
[50:36] all right I say unto you love your
[50:38] enemies bless them that curse you can
[50:41] you really do that
[50:45] can you really do that
[50:47] you think about that and I've been
[50:49] thinking about it all week
[50:51] do good to them that hate you
[50:55] literally
[50:57] hate you
[50:59] you got to do good to them
[51:02] for them
[51:05] no you know what we do we get it in the
[51:07] bed and we lay our head down and we go
[51:10] bless Mom and Dad
[51:13] bless our church folks
[51:15] bless our ministry
[51:17] Bless the people that love me
[51:22] bless my friends
[51:24] have you ever
[51:26] said
[51:27] bless my neighbor that hates me
[51:31] well there's the skin y'all like to walk
[51:33] over going out
[51:35] me too
[51:37] but that literally is what they're
[51:38] saying that's not saying anything
[51:39] different than what I just told you
[51:43] if somebody despises you you need to
[51:45] pray for them
[51:48] I'm just telling you you said well why
[51:49] do I need to waste my time
[51:55] altar will be open in just a few minutes
[52:00] pray for them which despitefully use you
[52:03] and persecute you
[52:06] no we get into we got God
[52:11] right in my neighborhood
[52:16] right here
[52:18] I have to look at it when I'm watering
[52:19] the lawn
[52:21] and he hates me
[52:24] I'm praying for you
[52:27] ever done that before nope didn't think
[52:30] so more skin hit the floor
[52:35] but you know that's why and just like
[52:37] Jim said our our
[52:40] neighbors are homosexual and they've
[52:42] been that way for 30 years but they're
[52:44] some of the nicest people they show no
[52:46] outward affection when they're outside
[52:47] and they're just nice they've been
[52:49] they've even been the only one in their
[52:51] neighbor right around us that's asked
[52:53] about the message
[52:57] yeah and he's asked about Dad several
[52:59] times about dad and his you know having
[53:02] the stroke and all that because they
[53:03] almost died they both had hearts and
[53:05] heart attacks and they were widowmakers
[53:07] so God God kept around here for some
[53:09] reason
[53:11] but they know that we can talk back and
[53:13] forth and they give they converse with
[53:15] us but Mike come over one day and he
[53:17] said I've heard this
[53:19] about y'all all my life so see I mean
[53:22] the community knows
[53:24] well they think they know what ain't
[53:28] so-and-so said that Uncle so-and-so said
[53:31] that that cousin this one said and and
[53:35] and and and then the the preacher on the
[53:37] other Church said
[53:39] he said I just want to know what y'all
[53:40] believe ear to ear mouth to mouth I want
[53:42] you I want to know what y'all believe
[53:44] so I sit through it outside and we stood
[53:46] there for about an hour and I kind of
[53:47] just laid the picture out for a little
[53:49] bit you know and he said well okay never
[53:50] rejected it never said anything up
[53:53] and he said well I just wondered I've
[53:54] heard this and I've heard y'all worship
[53:56] a man and y'all say that he's God and
[53:58] nip so I just kind of you know
[54:01] give him the uh
[54:04] um you know the whole spell about the
[54:05] message and how we believe that a
[54:07] messenger had to come and was identified
[54:09] in the Bible it's not just somebody God
[54:11] said I'm just going to send this guy I
[54:13] know he's identifying the scripture
[54:15] so Mike was enough to know he'd been
[54:17] raised in church he knew those
[54:18] scriptures and where they were
[54:20] Malachi was not you know he knew where
[54:22] Malachi was in the Bible
[54:24] so what are you saying well you know
[54:26] what maybe it'll do something planted
[54:28] maybe a little something in them
[54:30] you know same way with the guy that I
[54:32] saw the other day you just you just you
[54:34] know if he but now if he would have said
[54:36] well now I heard you was a uh you
[54:40] um stole something and you didn't you
[54:42] know he starts naming all this stuff and
[54:44] and you know I heard you cussing the
[54:46] other day over there you know and
[54:48] that would have been a real good
[54:51] example
[54:53] right
[54:54] so let's not be guilty of that
[54:58] I want to be guilty of being a Christian
[55:02] and as the old saying goes if I have to
[55:05] go to court
[55:06] will they convict me to be one
[55:08] by the evidence that's given
[55:13] I won't be able to convict me
[55:16] as a father hath loved me so have I
[55:18] loved you continue in my love if you
[55:21] keep my Commandments you shall abide in
[55:22] my love now he's fixing to tell us
[55:24] what's the two greatest Commandments
[55:28] not Thou shalt not kill
[55:30] not Thou shalt not bear false witness
[55:32] not there shall honor your father and
[55:35] mother which is good
[55:37] he's going to tell us what the two great
[55:39] Commandments are because they're going
[55:40] to ask him here in just a little bit
[55:42] this is my commandment that you love one
[55:44] another as I have loved you
[55:47] Divine love and Sovereign Grace
[55:50] brother mom said we're facing a day when
[55:52] brotherly love will become a strange
[55:54] thing among people
[55:55] and it's to my humble belief that that's
[55:57] the greatest of all the gifts that there
[55:58] is in God's Bible remember the whole
[56:00] quote I didn't bring it but for those of
[56:02] you that hadn't heard it he he said now
[56:04] if if God was to walk up to me and say
[56:06] all right I'm going to give you the
[56:07] greatest Ministry and we'll give you the
[56:09] greatest healing campaign I'm going to
[56:10] give you all these great things but I'm
[56:12] gonna withhold my love from you
[56:14] brother Brown said take all of them and
[56:16] give me love
[56:18] just give me that one gift and that's
[56:19] what he's saying here to my humble
[56:21] belief and I believe that that's why
[56:23] we're not as far up as we are
[56:27] is brotherly kindness
[56:29] is showing somebody that literally hates
[56:32] your guts
[56:33] that it's all right
[56:36] I'm not gonna
[56:37] what did the Bible say if you're reviled
[56:39] at don't revile back
[56:41] guilty
[56:43] yeah thank you Richard uh some of you'll
[56:45] tell the truth some of you Liars
[56:48] so selfish to be selfish is to be
[56:51] concerned excessively with your own self
[56:54] IE sticks
[56:58] selfishness is one of the biggest
[57:00] obstacles to having the kind of close
[57:01] relationship with God and an inspiring
[57:04] relationship with other how can you be
[57:06] selfish
[57:09] how can you be so selfish
[57:11] that you don't help your brother or your
[57:13] sister I keep saying brotherly kindness
[57:15] it is sisterly also y'all don't stand
[57:17] here all you women are going you know me
[57:19] and it says brotherly kindness
[57:21] no
[57:24] kindness slash
[57:30] okay so now see y'all all involved now
[57:33] the women was like he's talking about
[57:35] them now
[57:37] that's in Brothers
[57:40] second Timothy 3 verse 2 said for men
[57:42] shall be lovers of their own selves boy
[57:43] think about that Covetous boasters proud
[57:45] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[57:48] Unfaithful Unholy have you ever seen a
[57:50] world where where you see these YouTube
[57:52] influencers don't have a job
[57:56] huh you kids your kids know what I'm
[57:58] talking about the other ones may not
[57:59] there's people that just get paid to
[58:02] just say I'm going to the bathroom today
[58:06] I'm gonna color my hair blue
[58:08] and I'm gonna wear this and I'm gonna go
[58:10] lay on the beach
[58:12] I'm gonna Vlog or blog or whatever it is
[58:16] and I get paid to do that
[58:19] wow
[58:21] think about yourself
[58:23] but are we that way are we selfish
[58:26] brother Brown said in 1950
[58:28] people's got too selfish
[58:30] get to a place where they think they
[58:32] live in a little world
[58:33] all by theirself oh what was me
[58:37] you know that's the truth
[58:39] now brother Brown says I despise
[58:42] that somebody
[58:44] that's that old somebody that feels
[58:46] they're bigger than somebody else
[58:49] after all you're six foot of Earth
[58:51] that's all you are
[58:53] well some more scan just hit the ground
[58:55] and brother Brown says in 1954 said I
[58:58] recognized the other day a selfish
[58:59] Spirit coming on me I'm saying this
[59:02] man's wrong I know I ought to tell him
[59:04] about it that's wrong God's one needs to
[59:06] tell him about it let's continue on same
[59:08] listen brother Brown was full of
[59:10] complexes I'm just trying to tell you
[59:11] this man was human this is the same
[59:14] tape this is the same message on down a
[59:18] little bit further in a different
[59:19] paragraph he said I want to ask the
[59:21] church one more thing before we get some
[59:22] place to study in Scripture that you'll
[59:24] pray for me I've developed a critical
[59:25] spirit
[59:26] and it haunts me
[59:28] wow
[59:30] but you know what I believe he got rid
[59:32] of it
[59:33] he comes to Statue of perfect man he got
[59:35] rid of it
[59:36] but at least he realized he had it so he
[59:39] could get rid of it right
[59:41] we got to realize that we're at a place
[59:43] so we can get rid of certain things and
[59:45] to me that's what the preaching is it
[59:47] dissects your life for you
[59:50] because we don't want to believe that
[59:52] we're wrong
[59:54] I ain't going there
[59:55] everlasting life
[59:58] brother Brown said that's what's the
[59:59] matter with people today now listen
[1:00:01] they're trying to pack
[1:00:03] up to be a Christian if there's anything
[1:00:05] you need to do is unpack
[1:00:07] to be a Christian got too many things
[1:00:09] hanging on and he keeps telling you that
[1:00:10] you load the camel up so much so it's
[1:00:12] bowlegged
[1:00:13] so that's what we need to quit doing and
[1:00:15] and brother Bob I got to keep this in
[1:00:17] here brother Bob talks about pride and
[1:00:19] Buddy when he talks about Pride that
[1:00:21] blanket of evil just went out across
[1:00:23] over the congregation
[1:00:25] foreign
[1:00:26] listen
[1:00:28] it's okay to be proud
[1:00:31] I'm proud of my dad proud of my mom
[1:00:34] I'm proud of my pastor
[1:00:36] that's one thing to be proud of but I'm
[1:00:37] not so pride-ish
[1:00:39] to say he's the only one that's got it
[1:00:42] and to say that there's me foreign no
[1:00:45] more
[1:00:45] that's too much pride a feeling of deep
[1:00:47] pleasure derived from your own
[1:00:50] achievements look at me I did this
[1:00:54] I did this
[1:00:56] no
[1:00:57] if anything happens good
[1:01:01] God had something to do with it if it's
[1:01:03] in your Christian life I want y'all to
[1:01:05] realize that the achievement of those
[1:01:07] who with whom is closely associated are
[1:01:09] from quality or possessions that are
[1:01:11] widely admired so see I'm proud to be I
[1:01:16] used to be proud to be an American when
[1:01:17] I was you know back in the world because
[1:01:19] that's all I knew but now I'm proud to
[1:01:21] be a Christian
[1:01:22] but I am proud to be living here I mean
[1:01:24] I don't want to be living nowhere else
[1:01:26] all right as bad as it is so the Bible
[1:01:30] tells us Pride goeth Before Destruction
[1:01:31] and a haughty spirit before a fall holy
[1:01:35] spirit means arrogancy or bad sense
[1:01:39] I just want everybody to see that that
[1:01:41] that still is it plagues all of us
[1:01:44] it really does it the price do you just
[1:01:47] think about it like brother Bob was
[1:01:48] saying you know what's all this gay
[1:01:50] movement Pride I'm proud of what I am
[1:01:52] well guess what I'm proud of what I am
[1:01:55] I like the whole world and I'll Hold the
[1:01:57] Flag up I don't care if it's all
[1:01:59] different colors
[1:02:04] to me it's a sign God ain't gonna
[1:02:05] destroy the world with water no more
[1:02:07] he's going to destroy it with fire but
[1:02:09] he's not going to destroy the water no
[1:02:10] more because he'd give me a rainbow that
[1:02:12] I can look at and I don't look at the
[1:02:14] rainbow to see gay people
[1:02:16] maybe took off on YouTube that's
[1:02:18] whatever we got to stand up for what we
[1:02:20] are all right okay
[1:02:23] Blasphemous names brother Robin now look
[1:02:25] real quick
[1:02:27] brother Brian tells us he sees this
[1:02:29] dream of sister Shepard so he's
[1:02:31] interpreting the dream now being a
[1:02:32] prophet he saw the dream
[1:02:34] so he's not interpreting from from her
[1:02:37] telling him thank God for a prophecy
[1:02:39] because you know you if I tell brother
[1:02:41] boy in my dream and he tells sister
[1:02:42] James brother Bob something don't get
[1:02:45] missing in between there
[1:02:47] but when brother Brandon was standing he
[1:02:49] would literally see the same dream that
[1:02:51] you had he could be confident that he
[1:02:54] didn't miss anything
[1:02:56] so he would be kind and God let him do
[1:02:58] that so he could have that confidence
[1:03:00] that he didn't miss anything and you
[1:03:02] could depend on sister Shepard was
[1:03:04] saying brother random or she was saying
[1:03:06] God do I have the Holy Ghost remember
[1:03:09] so God was so gracious that he gave her
[1:03:12] a dream and then gave brother around the
[1:03:14] same dream to tell her the
[1:03:16] interpretation and here's that
[1:03:17] interpretation and it has something to
[1:03:19] do with the Statue of perfect man
[1:03:20] because remember Blasphemous names was
[1:03:22] preached the Sunday after he preached at
[1:03:24] you a perfect man and he does clarify a
[1:03:27] lot of things in Blasphemous names that
[1:03:28] he didn't clarify in the Statue of
[1:03:30] perfect man read them both and you'll
[1:03:31] see that
[1:03:32] so brother Ram talks about he sees the
[1:03:35] vision of this man is up on top of the
[1:03:37] pyramid
[1:03:38] pouring water in
[1:03:40] so this Tabernacle he's talking about is
[1:03:42] not a holy ghost Tabernacle there's no
[1:03:44] such thing individuals that come into
[1:03:46] this church as Holy Ghost Tabernacles
[1:03:48] now see he's he's making this I can see
[1:03:51] where he's he's telling sister Shepard
[1:03:53] look it's not the Tabernacle that you're
[1:03:55] going to that may shoes have the Holy
[1:03:56] Ghost I don't want you to depend on you
[1:03:58] having the Holy Ghost by coming to this
[1:04:00] church all right he's saying you depend
[1:04:02] on the Holy Ghost that's inside of you
[1:04:04] because brother Ram says look they are
[1:04:06] Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost
[1:04:08] me and you
[1:04:11] so he's telling sister Shepard it's got
[1:04:13] to not be in a in a building
[1:04:16] but it's got to be inside of you
[1:04:18] but not the church in the body a group
[1:04:22] therefore it runs out he's done with the
[1:04:23] water but what this man who was pouring
[1:04:26] the water the messenger of the church
[1:04:27] who was that he saw himself
[1:04:29] he just was so humble he didn't say that
[1:04:31] was me bless God I was up there pouring
[1:04:33] that water in there no he said it was a
[1:04:35] messenger to the church well you and I
[1:04:37] catch that Revelation that it was him
[1:04:38] doing that
[1:04:39] pouring the message into the church but
[1:04:43] what was the water doing it was boiling
[1:04:46] out all the trash so he's telling sister
[1:04:48] Shepard you got the Holy Ghost all these
[1:04:51] things are in the right position but
[1:04:53] they steal some trash
[1:04:55] there's still some excess skin that we
[1:04:57] got to get rid of right
[1:04:58] there's still some brotherly kindness
[1:05:00] that we got to work on Temperance
[1:05:01] patients and all these different things
[1:05:03] it was boiling out all the trash that
[1:05:06] was in it so I can I can see I can't see
[1:05:08] the dream but I can see I can stand back
[1:05:10] and see that there was a pyramid-shaped
[1:05:12] mountain and the top was off of it and
[1:05:15] here this box was sitting because I can
[1:05:17] see it there here's that box was sitting
[1:05:19] there and she said brother around do I
[1:05:22] have a holy ghost yeah you got the Holy
[1:05:23] Ghost
[1:05:24] but there's more
[1:05:27] there's more
[1:05:28] I got to get this trash out of you
[1:05:30] because remember she was standing not at
[1:05:32] the top of the pyramid
[1:05:34] sister Shepard was standing at the
[1:05:36] bottom of the pyramid with the water
[1:05:39] running over her feet
[1:05:41] okay sister Shepard you got the Holy
[1:05:43] Ghost but you ain't up there where that
[1:05:44] man's at
[1:05:46] but you can get there if you'll let us
[1:05:49] if you'll let the message of the hour
[1:05:50] boil all this trash out of you
[1:05:52] same way with us it's what the Holy
[1:05:55] Spirit does it boils it up now now the
[1:05:57] honey represented Brotherly Love
[1:05:59] brotherly kindness which is this age I
[1:06:03] just got through telling said brotherly
[1:06:04] kind of see something about the message
[1:06:06] before the week before the agent we live
[1:06:08] in now now you might say look I sure
[1:06:10] don't like brother Neville or I sure
[1:06:12] don't like brother Jones I don't like
[1:06:13] brother so and so something like that
[1:06:15] but just let something happen to him
[1:06:17] brother your heart is broke I was
[1:06:19] telling them up there
[1:06:20] um this past weekend how many times have
[1:06:23] you ever in your life
[1:06:25] how many times have you ever
[1:06:27] had a situation like that where you you
[1:06:30] got separated you didn't talk to
[1:06:31] somebody because of some little
[1:06:33] silly something
[1:06:37] everybody quiet
[1:06:42] and you don't see that person and you
[1:06:44] say boy I should call I'm gonna pick the
[1:06:47] phone up and I'm gonna call sister so
[1:06:49] and so I'm gonna call brother so and so
[1:06:51] and you find out two days later they're
[1:06:53] dead
[1:06:56] happened to me I know what's happened to
[1:06:58] you guys
[1:06:58] right
[1:07:00] what don't you just tear your heart out
[1:07:01] you don't worry
[1:07:02] separated you but you didn't want that
[1:07:04] to happen no more but you didn't worry
[1:07:05] about that you was worried about that
[1:07:06] person
[1:07:07] look now this is what brother I'm saying
[1:07:10] I want I want you to really get this
[1:07:11] because it's in big letters we can
[1:07:14] obtain brotherly kindness and feeling
[1:07:15] for one another
[1:07:17] all right for one another
[1:07:20] because I can conquer
[1:07:23] as an individual
[1:07:26] what I have against brother Boyd or him
[1:07:28] against me right
[1:07:31] but can every one of you in this
[1:07:33] building
[1:07:34] do the same thing at the same time
[1:07:39] but to maintain in the group of people
[1:07:41] he kind of lets that trail off
[1:07:43] because he wants you to think but you
[1:07:46] know what he's trying to do he's trying
[1:07:47] to get a church built
[1:07:49] to where it's not just an individual
[1:07:51] sure we grow as individuals absolutely
[1:07:54] but we got to come to a place where the
[1:07:55] bride has got to come to a place
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:01] as a body
[1:08:04] it didn't say for the Perfection of two
[1:08:06] or three
[1:08:07] except for the Perfection of the Saints
[1:08:09] he said brother mom said but now to
[1:08:10] maintain it in a group of people it's
[1:08:12] going to be kind of hard
[1:08:14] because look he keeps going on why do
[1:08:16] you care for that brother because you
[1:08:17] broke bread with him here at the altar
[1:08:18] or you will tonight you fellowship with
[1:08:21] him oh by the way that made me realize
[1:08:23] again since last Wednesday we're not
[1:08:25] going to help communion this Sunday but
[1:08:26] we'll have it next Sunday be the first
[1:08:28] Sunday of the month brother Keith will
[1:08:29] be here so we'll just have everything
[1:08:30] that whole weekend you shook his hand
[1:08:32] you worshiped with him he's your brother
[1:08:34] and he might do something in the flesh
[1:08:36] now look that he would you would
[1:08:38] disagree with because you just kind of
[1:08:40] stay now look what you want to do but
[1:08:42] you shun him a little
[1:08:46] oh y'all never done that
[1:08:51] but in the more skin but in the bottom
[1:08:54] of your heart if something happened to
[1:08:56] that brother it would nearly kill you
[1:08:59] are that sister
[1:09:01] I'm an old man I once young now I'm old
[1:09:03] I've seen it down Through the Ages hear
[1:09:04] people say I just won't have no more to
[1:09:06] do with him and something happened that
[1:09:08] man that nearly kills you he thinks oh
[1:09:11] God I let my precious brother go without
[1:09:12] making friends with him you see see it's
[1:09:15] brotherly love
[1:09:16] it looks like it won't stick but it does
[1:09:19] stick the honey
[1:09:21] sticks what is the honey brotherly
[1:09:23] kindness
[1:09:25] brotherly kindness it will stick what is
[1:09:28] it holding together it's holding
[1:09:30] together that rock Box confession he was
[1:09:33] talking about that that what the
[1:09:35] messenger was pouring in because listen
[1:09:37] if you pour something into a box I don't
[1:09:40] care how how good the box is if it's got
[1:09:44] holes in it and if it's got cracks in it
[1:09:48] that trash is not going to come out
[1:09:51] that trash is gonna go right down to
[1:09:53] them holes and go right back into that
[1:09:55] same place again because remember where
[1:09:57] was the Box the box was sitting right
[1:09:59] here
[1:10:00] he was pouring the water in the trash
[1:10:02] was coming out and running down the side
[1:10:07] if you got holes in your box and don't
[1:10:08] have any brotherly kindness
[1:10:13] where's all that trash going to go
[1:10:15] right back down in the bottom
[1:10:20] Hebrews 12 but we all look like we've
[1:10:22] been in the sun all day and we get done
[1:10:24] with this one
[1:10:25] our skin
[1:10:27] follow peace with all men and Holiness
[1:10:29] without which no man shall see the Lord
[1:10:31] now look at that one
[1:10:33] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[1:10:36] the grace of God lest any root of
[1:10:38] bitterness
[1:10:39] spring up troubling you and thereby many
[1:10:42] be defiled
[1:10:46] now let's cover this and then we're not
[1:10:49] going to get any further but we'll get
[1:10:51] we'll get to the Holy Ghost this weekend
[1:10:53] acts 11 verse 22 now watch
[1:10:56] this is two men now there's no doubt
[1:11:00] Paul had the Holy Ghost
[1:11:02] he was a church-aged messenger he had
[1:11:05] some of those virtues working in his
[1:11:06] life because him and Peter had talked
[1:11:08] back and forth and he was a church age
[1:11:10] messenger he wasn't just some novice
[1:11:12] that was sitting there sucking his thumb
[1:11:14] no he wrote 80 of the New Testament all
[1:11:16] right and then Barnabas was connected to
[1:11:19] him
[1:11:20] and then it will let's read then Tidings
[1:11:23] of these things came into the ears of
[1:11:25] the church which was in Jerusalem and
[1:11:26] they sent forth Barnabas that he should
[1:11:28] go as far as Antioch who when he came
[1:11:31] and had seen the grace of God was glad
[1:11:33] and exhorted them all that with the
[1:11:35] purpose of heart they would cleave unto
[1:11:37] the Lord look for he was a good man and
[1:11:39] full of the Holy Ghost and of faith
[1:11:42] all right so the Bible is is is given
[1:11:44] the commentary of Barnabas that he
[1:11:47] wasn't some novice he wasn't some
[1:11:48] fly-by-night guy he had the Holy Ghost
[1:11:51] and faith and he was a good man
[1:11:54] and much people was added unto the Lord
[1:11:57] then departed Barnabas to Tarsus for
[1:12:00] deceit Saul in other words they come
[1:12:01] together and they preached for several
[1:12:03] years together everybody with me and
[1:12:06] when he had found him he brought him
[1:12:07] unto Antioch and it came to pass it a
[1:12:09] whole year they assembled right there
[1:12:11] they assembled them they were in the
[1:12:13] same church together
[1:12:15] breaking bread preaching getting
[1:12:18] something off each other right
[1:12:20] feeding off each other and they taught
[1:12:22] much people
[1:12:24] and the disciples were called Christians
[1:12:26] first in Antioch but now that was Acts
[1:12:29] 11 verse 22. now look acts 15 this is a
[1:12:33] few more verses over acts 15 36.
[1:12:37] and some days after Paul said after some
[1:12:39] days after and some days after Paul said
[1:12:43] unto Barnabas let us go again and visit
[1:12:46] our brethren in every city where we have
[1:12:47] preached the word of the Lord and see
[1:12:49] how they do
[1:12:51] and Barnabas said okay but I'm going to
[1:12:53] take Mark with me or John
[1:12:56] but Paul thought not good to take him
[1:12:57] with him who departed from them from
[1:13:00] pampolia and went not with them to work
[1:13:02] to to the work
[1:13:06] and the contention was so sharp between
[1:13:08] them
[1:13:10] now listen it wasn't doctrinal
[1:13:13] wasn't Doctrine
[1:13:15] it was individual people that didn't see
[1:13:18] eye to eye with each other
[1:13:20] all right
[1:13:22] the contention was so sharp between them
[1:13:24] that they Departed the Sun or one from
[1:13:26] the other
[1:13:27] and it does not record them ever coming
[1:13:29] back together again
[1:13:30] and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed
[1:13:32] into Cyprus and Paul chose Silas now
[1:13:35] that Paul and Silas had to come together
[1:13:36] because they were they were they were
[1:13:38] written in the Bible that they did some
[1:13:39] great things had both be put in jail and
[1:13:42] departed being recommended by the
[1:13:44] Brethren unto the grace of God now think
[1:13:47] about that here's two men that are just
[1:13:49] Mighty Men in the same church
[1:13:52] and they have a little differences of
[1:13:54] who needs to go with them and who
[1:13:55] doesn't
[1:13:56] Paul was saying hey look Barnabas Mark
[1:13:58] wasn't with us when we were doing the
[1:14:00] work
[1:14:02] he just comes a little bit later and
[1:14:04] Barnabas is like yeah but he's my guy
[1:14:08] and Paul said well
[1:14:10] I ain't going with him
[1:14:12] Barnacle says we'll hang on with you
[1:14:15] so they Departed
[1:14:17] so you understand how brotherly kindness
[1:14:19] works
[1:14:20] they loved each other as brothers but
[1:14:22] they had small contentions with each
[1:14:24] other
[1:14:25] so as I've always said before
[1:14:29] if everybody loves you there's just
[1:14:31] something you're just too wishy-washy
[1:14:33] if everybody loves you
[1:14:36] now you should all love each other as
[1:14:38] brothers because we are Christians
[1:14:41] but just because Donnie doesn't hunt or
[1:14:43] or Dutton fish
[1:14:46] like I do
[1:14:48] okay I mean like I do all the time you'd
[1:14:52] rather have your head under a hood
[1:14:55] you had used to okay would you just go
[1:14:58] with me here okay I chose you for a
[1:15:00] reason
[1:15:01] um
[1:15:03] but now that doesn't make that what that
[1:15:06] does mean though that if Donnie says hey
[1:15:07] I'm going to I'm going to go rebuild
[1:15:09] don't laugh I'm gonna go rebuild a motor
[1:15:11] I'm gonna like go ahead buddy
[1:15:15] well why ain't you gonna go with me to
[1:15:18] rebuild this motor
[1:15:19] I don't want to I don't know a thing
[1:15:21] about it I'd be bored stiff I'm going
[1:15:23] hunting you go do your motor we'll come
[1:15:25] together on church Sunday
[1:15:27] so there's brother kindness just in a
[1:15:29] nutshell because there's got to be a
[1:15:30] balance
[1:15:33] because I'm gonna read you a scripture
[1:15:35] here in just a second where the Bible
[1:15:36] says whoa
[1:15:38] unto you
[1:15:40] that every man speaks good of you
[1:15:45] I'll read it right here
[1:15:48] I like this quote brother Brown's a real
[1:15:50] believer will give you your choice
[1:15:52] no selfishness in a real believer not at
[1:15:55] all
[1:16:00] and that's the great commandment
[1:16:01] somebody asked him said look which is a
[1:16:03] great Commandments in the law the great
[1:16:04] commandment in the law Jesus said Thou
[1:16:06] shalt love the Lord thy God with all the
[1:16:08] heart and soul and mind and this is the
[1:16:10] first and great commandment and the
[1:16:11] second is like unto Thou shalt love thy
[1:16:14] neighbor as thyself
[1:16:16] on these two Commandments hang all the
[1:16:19] law
[1:16:20] and the prophets
[1:16:23] here it is Luke 6 verse 26 this is Jesus
[1:16:26] telling us woe unto you when all men
[1:16:28] speak well of you
[1:16:31] I'm just telling you what Jesus said
[1:16:33] for so did their fathers to the false
[1:16:36] prophets but I say unto you which here
[1:16:38] love your enemies do good to them which
[1:16:40] hate you bless them that curse you and
[1:16:43] pray for them which despitefully use you
[1:16:46] like I said before
[1:16:49] you get spotted you have a bad day at
[1:16:51] work your boss gets on you your neighbor
[1:16:53] gets on your your co-worker and and I'll
[1:16:57] promise you you don't go home
[1:16:58] and pray for them
[1:17:05] you might pray the Lord get them out of
[1:17:06] the office
[1:17:11] but the Bible says pray for those
[1:17:14] who despitefully use you
[1:17:18] and this is sound so simple or profound
[1:17:20] but we're not going to get up The
[1:17:21] Headstone if we don't love our brothers
[1:17:23] and our sisters like we should
[1:17:26] love your enemies do good to them that
[1:17:29] hate you
[1:17:30] listen I made myself a note here
[1:17:33] this is all hard
[1:17:36] for a human being without the Holy Ghost
[1:17:39] is totally impossible you look at the
[1:17:42] world road rage they'll shoot you now
[1:17:45] they used to just shoot me a bird now
[1:17:46] they shoot you with a gun
[1:17:49] all right
[1:17:51] anything you make somebody mad and
[1:17:54] they'll just they'll either beat you up
[1:17:55] run you off the road or they'll try to
[1:17:57] kill you
[1:17:59] and you see how this age you see where
[1:18:01] that guy lined his three kids up
[1:18:05] young kids
[1:18:08] and executing them and was laughing when
[1:18:11] he went to to the to the jail
[1:18:17] yeah killed his own three kids execution
[1:18:20] style they said
[1:18:21] and he had no remorse whatsoever
[1:18:25] you think that's bad
[1:18:27] you wait till we leave
[1:18:30] when we leave this place
[1:18:32] you can forget it
[1:18:35] you stay here you're gonna fight
[1:18:39] you'll fight till you die
[1:18:42] because everybody else is going to be
[1:18:43] doing the same thing but let's not let's
[1:18:45] get out of here love your neighbors do
[1:18:47] good to them once hate you bless them
[1:18:48] that curse you and pray for them which
[1:18:51] despitefully use you are falsely accuse
[1:18:53] you but love you your enemies and do
[1:18:56] good and lend hoping for nothing again
[1:18:58] and your rewards shall be great and you
[1:19:01] shall be the children of the highest for
[1:19:03] he is kind unto the unthankful and to
[1:19:06] the evil first John 4 19 says we loved
[1:19:10] him because he first loved us if a man
[1:19:13] say I love God and hate us his brother
[1:19:15] he's a liar
[1:19:18] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:19:20] he has seen how can he love God whom he
[1:19:22] has not seen
[1:19:23] and this commandment have we from him
[1:19:26] that he who loveth God loveth his
[1:19:29] brother also First John 3 verse 13 says
[1:19:33] Marvel not my brethren if the world
[1:19:34] hates you boy we know that
[1:19:37] we know that we have passed from death
[1:19:40] into life because we love the brethren
[1:19:43] we know
[1:19:45] I'm reading your Bible I'm not reading
[1:19:46] you a quote from James Dobson I'm not
[1:19:48] reading a quote from Wade Dale or Samuel
[1:19:50] Dale I'm reading you the Bible there
[1:19:52] aren't we supposed to do what the Bible
[1:19:53] says the Bible was written for us right
[1:19:57] we know that we have passed from death
[1:19:59] into life because we love the Brethren
[1:20:01] he that loveth not his brother abideth
[1:20:05] in death
[1:20:07] whosoever hateth his brother is a
[1:20:09] murderer
[1:20:10] and you know that no murderer hath
[1:20:13] eternal life abiding
[1:20:15] in him
[1:20:17] I'm reading Bible
[1:20:18] okay hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:20:22] because he laid down his life for us and
[1:20:23] we ought to lay our lives down for the
[1:20:26] Brethren but whoso had this world's good
[1:20:29] and see if his brother have need and
[1:20:31] shoth up his bowels of compassion from
[1:20:33] him how dwelleth the love of God in him
[1:20:38] my little children let us not love in
[1:20:40] the word neither in tongue now look
[1:20:44] but indeed and in truth
[1:20:48] easy to say it
[1:20:50] hard to do it
[1:20:52] but we can
[1:20:54] listen we can brother Brown tells us is
[1:20:57] you people these saw blade tempers
[1:21:00] that's always spouting off at the mouth
[1:21:01] at somebody
[1:21:03] if I hit anybody yet can't put more skin
[1:21:06] can't put up and things like that be
[1:21:08] careful brother I said be careful you're
[1:21:11] guilty if you speak a word against your
[1:21:13] brother that's not right not just go
[1:21:15] around and tear him down or town tear
[1:21:17] down it you don't have to stick a knife
[1:21:20] in that man's back to kill him you can
[1:21:22] break his character and kill him kill
[1:21:24] his influence
[1:21:26] how many times have we seen that we sure
[1:21:28] have speak against your pastor here tell
[1:21:30] me I'm sure he pointed back to brother
[1:21:32] Neville say something bad about him you
[1:21:35] just might as well have shot him
[1:21:37] told something that wasn't right about
[1:21:38] him well it'll kill his influence with
[1:21:40] the people and things like that and
[1:21:42] you're guilty of it that's what Jesus
[1:21:44] said
[1:21:46] how about that
[1:21:48] finally let's read this and then we'll
[1:21:50] magicians come on First Peter 3 verse 8
[1:21:53] says finally be all of One mind having
[1:21:56] compassion
[1:21:57] one of another
[1:22:00] and I want to tell you a little story
[1:22:01] just for a second let's all stand
[1:22:05] I have a guy on my mail route
[1:22:10] and he's about to maybe the 10th box on
[1:22:13] the route so I get him early in the
[1:22:15] morning
[1:22:16] and and bless his heart I'm going to
[1:22:18] tell you this story and and then you
[1:22:21] know and I do pray for him
[1:22:24] but he lives in a
[1:22:27] he drives a car that I wouldn't drive
[1:22:29] out of my parking lot the wheels are
[1:22:32] bent the tailgates off the truck it's
[1:22:36] piled full of stuff but every day I'm
[1:22:39] telling you every day that boy is up out
[1:22:41] of the bed he's either
[1:22:43] trimming trees or cutting trees to make
[1:22:45] some money he's either hot he's got he
[1:22:47] goes and gets junk cars and stuff you
[1:22:49] know
[1:22:50] um takes it up here to them
[1:22:52] recycling thing
[1:22:54] cans and all that he works so hard
[1:22:58] and he has nothing
[1:23:01] lives in just a I mean you can look
[1:23:02] through the door and see the house and
[1:23:04] it's just powerful of stuff the yard's
[1:23:06] pile full of stuff
[1:23:09] but I have compassion on somebody
[1:23:10] that'll do that I don't have compassion
[1:23:12] on somebody who sits on their laser rear
[1:23:13] end and then that happens to them
[1:23:15] but when he just struggles all the time
[1:23:17] every time I see him he's doing
[1:23:19] something he's not sitting down he's
[1:23:20] always you know he seemed driving up the
[1:23:22] road with a trailer and he's got you
[1:23:23] know uh 14 or 15 parts that are aluminum
[1:23:27] or brass or something you know piled up
[1:23:29] on his on a junk and he's going to go
[1:23:32] and make maybe 50 bucks
[1:23:34] for all that effort
[1:23:37] finally be all in one mind having
[1:23:39] compassion one of another
[1:23:41] love is Brethren be pitiful be courteous
[1:23:45] not rendering evil for evil or railing
[1:23:47] for railing
[1:23:50] but contrary wise
[1:23:52] opposite r as brother Ram says Vice
[1:23:55] Versi or versa blessings but contrary
[1:23:58] wise don't render evil for evil or
[1:24:00] railing for William we're all we're
[1:24:01] we're all guilty of that
[1:24:04] but contrary wise
[1:24:06] blessings knowing that you are there
[1:24:09] unto call now look this is my whole
[1:24:11] point your call for this this is what
[1:24:13] you're called to there's a lot of people
[1:24:15] are not called to this because they
[1:24:17] can't they can't make it
[1:24:19] they're not taught they don't know how
[1:24:21] to navigate through scripture they don't
[1:24:23] know how to navigate through through
[1:24:25] times in their life because they don't
[1:24:26] have the Holy Ghost but if you got the
[1:24:28] Holy Ghost and you got good teaching
[1:24:30] this ought to be something that we that
[1:24:33] we conform as the Bible says conform to
[1:24:35] his image all right that's what we're
[1:24:37] doing with this we're we're taking our
[1:24:39] image out we're conforming to the image
[1:24:40] of God we're supposed to be doing so
[1:24:43] contrary wise blessings knowing that you
[1:24:45] are there unto called
[1:24:47] that you should inherit a blessing now
[1:24:49] who wants to blessing from God everybody
[1:24:50] says I need a blessing I need a blessing
[1:24:52] well there's your scripture right there
[1:24:55] have compassion one another
[1:24:57] love is Brethren be pitiful be courteous
[1:25:00] not rendering evil for evil or in other
[1:25:02] words
[1:25:04] the Bible says he didn't rail back when
[1:25:06] somebody railed at him when they was
[1:25:07] getting ready to hang him on the cross
[1:25:08] they called him all kind of stuff and he
[1:25:10] didn't say a word
[1:25:12] knowing that you're called for this and
[1:25:14] that you should inherit a blessing for
[1:25:16] he that will love life and see good days
[1:25:20] let him refrain his tongue from evil and
[1:25:23] his lips that they speak
[1:25:25] no God
[1:25:27] you love the Lord
[1:25:29] he's laid it out for us he's given us
[1:25:32] everything but are we doing are we as I
[1:25:35] was thinking the other day sometimes we
[1:25:37] just kind of skim over
[1:25:40] our Christianity we just kind of Hit the
[1:25:43] high points listen our Christianity we
[1:25:46] just kind of Hit the high points listen
[1:25:48] we love Acts 2 38.
[1:25:52] we love John 3 16.
[1:25:56] we love
[1:25:58] our certain scriptures
[1:26:01] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:26:03] Jesus Christ right we love these
[1:26:06] scripture
[1:26:07] you need to love them
[1:26:12] so we're esteeming one scripture better
[1:26:15] than the other
[1:26:21] Bible says when you stand praying
[1:26:24] forgive
[1:26:26] if you have ought against any
[1:26:28] that your father also which is in heaven
[1:26:30] May forgive you
[1:26:32] your trespasses
[1:26:35] but if you do not forgive
[1:26:38] neither will your father which is in
[1:26:40] heaven forgive your trespasses
[1:26:44] folks that's Divine forgiveness
[1:26:47] you and I can forgive but we can't
[1:26:49] forget because we're humans I wish we
[1:26:52] could but God can forgive
[1:26:54] and he can forget
[1:26:57] if you place it under the blood he can't
[1:26:59] even see it the prophet of God told us
[1:27:00] right
