TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign was talking about now he didn't actually use the word meekness but he was talking about the the number one problem in America and I think this is really the number Pro the number one problem we have is not being able to um when you see it propping up in the message today is people beginning to say well even though I have a quote for this even though brother Randall said this I'm not so sure I can put my faith in this yeah well meekness is really when you when you don't take your own intellectual concept when you see God's word being made manifested in profit um right it's kind of like um crawling up under the wings of that great mother eagle and saying we can take we can take a rest and a soul us and um comfort in staying within the confines of God's word and not trying to build up something with our own internet that improve something but just uh let's get into it I don't know so let's look at Matthew 5 5. I'll just read that to get started blessed are the meat for these children here at their and the reason they're going to inherit the earth is because they can take God at his word and rest on nothing else but God's word right now so I had a few um just to get started a few quotes that I found that were real good but from 1958 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and I'll just read the whole quote the order of our meeting and America is hard for the people to see it the American people my greatest meetings have been held in Switzerland Germany and Africa and India where as many as 500 000 people attend at one time to go through this Sunday School like 30 000 at a time receiving Christ and 25 000 healed at one for one inch that Carlos and brushes and things taken from one one prayer over the people and here's our problem and this I'm going to start talking about why you know you hear people accuse you of being intellectual why that is so bad be accused of being an election right and what Paul said about it we people in America are intellectual we won't be entertained and it's all intellectual we're well fed we're well executed too well and then we get to a place until we know more than God does oh yes the more simpler he can be the more you'll understand God and that's I think that's maybe a lot of the trouble today is we get to a place where we think well I don't I I I really what what he's saying I know so much now that I don't need the message anymore I don't need the quotes that you you uh bring I I got I got it all I've I've got a better way but you will never have a better way than than uh what God has brought through his profit if you get outside of that your own Dangerous Ground all right in conference since 1960 he said and when we find out that Moses and his great schooling and his intellectual learning smart intelligent he was so shrew until he could teach teachers and not trying to support ignorance but I think that when we get that way we're in the most dangerous states we can get into when we get so smart that we know more than everybody else that's half what's the matter with the world today that's what's the matter with the Nations today each one is trying to get smarter than the other that's not what we're trying to do God gives us the Revelation that should make us small or not try to put the other person down and say um I'm uh I'm bigger or better and show us the father he'll suffice us he said now we're going to see if we can see God how many would like to see God let's see your hands I know it's juvenile life and we're supposed to be children when we get to know a whole lot then we don't know nothing that we ought to know the Bible said we always never want to get a great intellectual feeling that we're above somebody or no more than somebody else just be calm and simple people try to explain God and go flow over the top of it you know that can apply to a lot of things in life like I think that's I kind of approach that way of work I'm I'm a team lead at work over seven people and I've been a software developer for 15 years but when somebody has just started out comes and says well I found this Nifty little tool on the Internet or something even though I've got Mastery over the subject right well maybe they found something that I've never seen before tonight and uh I think this that the whole topic of meekness pretty much sums that up we uh and that that scripture down that First Corinthians 8 2 and if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know now take that too far and you say because in this you know um we uh in this last day when the words being made manifest we're supposed to reach a point where we have confidence in what we believe and we know where we stand we uh Eagles are supposed to understand we're supposed to know what we're talking about that's that's not what I'm getting at I'm um we're supposed to uh but the really the topic of this is um standing on the word of God when you get when you get to where you think you know so much that you don't need the prophet's message anymore that's um so let's let's go to this little story in Acts 27. thank you to find out the prophet Paul made a statement it was disregard and see how it got him into some trouble oh the journey to roll when I put this little math up here just to kind of give us something to look at Acts chapter 27. let's kind of read this whole this whole uh chapter starting at verse one and when it was determined that we should sail into Italy they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners under one named Julius a centurion of Augustus band and entering into a ship of agromedium we launched meaning to sell by the coast of Asia one aristarchist a Macedonia of thessalonica being with us but Paul has loved together with all the prisoners and the policy requested to go to Rome they're taken into Rome and you know I doubt any of the other prisoners actually asked to be taken to Rome they're taking that to being taken to Rome not on their own accord right but Paul wanted to be a witness so he testified and the next day we touched aside on the sidearm as right there so they started out right there and they moved up the coast and they come to sidon you know and Julius can courteously and treated Paul and gave him Liberty to go into his friends to refresh himself and when we we had a lot from this we sailed under Cyprus because the winds were contrary so they moved on Up Under Cypress and the whole way the winds were contrary so they had to sail Against The Wind by turning this the way you do that by turning the sail all the way One Direction the road of the opposite way and then you keep flipping back and forth so the whole wader are going back and forth all the way up Against the Wind and when we had sailed Over the Sea of silicia and pamphilia we came to Myra City of La Sierra they come up to Myra you know another thing this Myra is in history is a place where this man named Nicholas Amara gave two golden eggs two uh dollars without a dollar these two ladies that didn't have a dollar and that's where the Saint Nicholas came from Santa Claus that little city right there where Paul stopped in and uh verse six in there the Centurion found the ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy and he put us there in and when we have sailed slowly many days and scared to come over against tinnitus the wind not suffering us we sailed on the creek over against ceremony so the wind is still not available you can see how far they cut I'm trying to journey to roll now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the past was now already passed the fastest the day of atonement Paul admonish them now the fast was now already passed that's important again that that point of the fastest already passed is important because from November to January they stopped travel so now they're at Lucia and they're all worried because the winter is coming and they need to find a place to stop over the winter until January so they can continue on their voice their own now when much time was spent when sailing was now dangerous because the fastest now already passed Paul and moniston instead of them servers I perceive that this Voyage will be even much hurt and much damage not only are the leading and not only of the leading the ship but also of our lives and how much debate has been said about whether this what Paul is saying here is by the leading of the Holy Spirit now this is a everybody's uh they're at Lucia they're uh it's a everybody's like this is not a good place for us to stay over the winter but Paul's saying you need to stop right here and uh when you when you're reading through the message if you just consider what Paul was saying Paul is presenting a warning to them that you need to obey obey what uh God is giving me and um instead of looking to the prophet of God right they looked let's see what they look to verse 11 nevertheless this interior and believe the master and the owner of this year more than those things which were spoken by Paul now where are they trying to get to they had to put them all the way from over here they had sailed Against the Wind all the way over here to Myra through roads all the way down to some money to Lucia and they were only trying to get from there to there that far after they had come this whole journey also and just stop a little bit this will be a fine enough place but instead of accepting what the prophet of God said what had been laid out before them they decided to accept their own what their own reasonings their own intellectual we know better than what this man is saying we know better than what he's telling us because we've gotten more experience we've got more education the owner of the ship that we've uh the uh the captain of the ship has been through sailing school you know it can read the Stars he's been doing this before but uh Paul knew what was going on right in verse 12 because that even was not commodious to win the more part advised to depart fence also then by any means they might attain in Phoenix and they're the winner which is a Haven of creep and lies toward the southwest and Northwest and when the south wind blew Softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose and that just how the devil does a lot of times it will blow softly and make you think I'm going down the right way but as soon as you get started then everything just begins to fall apart do you think as soon as you get off God's word uh there's no way to put the puzzle pieces together right remember that story about brother random told about the the picture of the cow and the field and everything you got to put the puzzle pieces together but if if you throw away what the God's Prophet said then uh there's no way what are you standing on I know this is kind of simple and we should all I know it is but um and when the South William blue softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing fence they sell close by creep and that will happen not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called Europa dog and when the ship was caught and not to not bear up into the wind he never drive and running under a certain Island which is called claw that we had much work to come by the boat which when they had taken up they used tails undergirding the ship and fearing unless they should fall into the quicksand straight sail and silver were driven so now they had Paula giving them the word of the Lord to stay there and just wait through the winter and now they left and everything's beginning to fall apart and they're trying to hold the together to hold their together they got bigger ropes and undergirded it to keep the wood together because there's a storm so bad if you reach further on down to the Stars this and the sun were were completely hidden and they tried by their man-made theology their man-made things that they had conjured up in their own mind trying to piece together God's word by their intellect they try to hold things together that'll never work it just won't work and we being exceedingly tossed with the templates the next day you need light in the ship yeah and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of The Shield boy that's something we can all take to heart and get rid of everything in our lives it's uh that's holding us down and when neither Sun nor stars and many days appeared and no spot small tip of sleigh on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away but after long after this Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs ye should have hearken under me and not have a loose from creep and to have gained this harm and loss and now I just want you to be a good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but other Shield so there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve now Paul on the first days had an angel with it and he had he had the scriptures written down to keep us in line so we could have something to compare against and I was reading what uh Irene is not like Irene is because he was as far as I know the only churches that messenger that was raised in the message he was born and raised in the message that's kind of interesting about him but he was he wrote about the uh what was called the Catholic Church calls Apostolic succession and they kind of Twisted that and turned it into well we'll vote on who's going to be the next leader of the church that's not how God works right he takes somebody and proves them by how they honor the word whether they'll stay with the word and that's how God chooses man chooses by political means who's going to meet our uh our our objectives and our little hidden backyard dealings and things but Paul irenius wrote about how we know that what we preach what I preach is true because you can trace it all the way back to what Paul preached Paul had an angel and Paul had his scriptures written down so that we could compare that's the same way today and this day brother Branham had an angel with him and he had all of his scriptures and all of the messages so that we can go back and compare and prove that what we believe Compares back with what he taught and that's what that's what our confidence is based on that everything what I believe I can compare back with what he said if I can't find it in his word and compare it back with the scripture right then what do I have to stand on that's what I'm trusting in that's right and if you if you uh if you can find what he taught and lay it before you and then say I don't believe it then that's like what they're doing with their taking these roots and trying to hold them together something by by their own intellect see how bad and collection we can call somebody an intellectual that's what that's where you're calling sometimes they're not being led by the Holy Spirit they're being led by something that is by their own mental conception conception right and then uh now I mentioned this last time second Corinthians chapter 10. if you want to find out what meekness is this is the chapter to read verse one through five now I call myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence and base among you but being absent and bold with you but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I'm in prison with that confidence where would I think to be born again soon which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh you all realize what he's saying there there's some of y'all that think that I have an intellectual yeah that walk according to the flesh and he said I'm not walking according to the flesh I'm not walking by my own mental conception by something that I'm just making up but I'm walking by something that God revealed to me that I have a personal experience with God for though we walk in the flesh we don't war after the flesh right because when we Ward after the flesh we take up a natural shield and a natural sword but we wore but what are we warn against against our memory and our reason and our Consciousness and our affection to destroy the strongholds for the weapons of our Warfare not Coral But Mighty through daughter they're pulling down a strongholds casting down imaginations and every hot thing that exhausted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of God and that's what's being destroyed through through God's word amen is everything that we've got built up in our own minds that's countered to God's word when you come to church when you open up the scripture when you read the message and it says what's in your own imagination what's in your reasoning is wrong then that's tearing down right tearing down strongholds and read on down to verse 17 and 18 but he that gloryth let him glory in the Lord so now God's given you a revelation does that make you big does that make you a big somebody well in the way it does but not to destroy it not to go out and Destroy other people and say You're nobody because you don't you don't uh maybe see things the way I do if we're not he that commandeth himself is approved by whom the Lord unless uh and this is the one where Paul is telling telling the church that now Corinthians we might say well boy that Corinthian Church had problems look maybe uh we've got the same problems speak brother First Corinthians sorry First Corinthians 14 36 38 that Paul is telling the church how to how to act how to behave how the women should keep silence in church that to cut your hair into how to act and behave and he said what did the word originate from you are you the only people that the word came to yeah if any man thinking himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let it be ignorant and that's I think a problem today is If you elevate yourself above God's prophet and say well I know more than the prophet and what does that make you right that makes you you're making yourself a problem right and the smyrnian church age I'm gonna just read this whole quote uh at every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there's spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught remember ireneices Apostolic succession the light comes to somebody who's going to stay with the word and then from that mixture spreads to the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught right there solid in the word and then it goes on and Iranians have laid it out through I believe 14 Generations from Rome to his his day of all the men that stayed with the word but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken amen remember Paul wanted people to say only what he said If any man think himself could be a prophet of spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord what came the word have gone out for me who came into you only they had here take away there as soon the message is no longer pure and the Revival dies down how careful we must be to hear wonderful is the spirit has the wonderfulness which is the voice of God Paul warned him to say what he said even as Peter did likewise he warned them that even he Paul could not change one word of what he had given by Revelation oh how important it is to hear the voice of God by whatever his Messengers and then say what is giving them what has been given their mistakes in the churches that's right and that's so important because I last last night I got to talking with my son Zach about um we were talking about that um there's a company called Monsanto he's putting out hybrid seeds and they're patenting all the all the different seeds that we may have heard about him and uh so um what you buy their seed from plant them in the ground and after you climbing the ground to grow next year you keep the seeds and try to plant those in the ground they won't grow because they're hybrid so you got to go back to Monsanto and buy the next year's seeds and they're trying to uh keep everybody else from uh from Raising seeds so that uh to try to try to create a monopoly and uh boy this will turn up all over the internet people think they're just so evil we got to talk about um I got to talk about Zach about why it's so important that the spoken word is the original sea amen and if you take disposable word The Original Seed and take anything else and add to it or take part of it out of that then it'll never reproduce back to what's in the original and that's why it's so important to stay with the original word which God's Prophet has brought to us because if you get if you get away from us then you're in the same place that you are when Monsanto where you get from them but you'll never be able to to uh and you'll never be able to go back to the original seed if you use that hybrid so now let's look but we think a lot of times like uh in numbers 12 1-10 well we know so much that we can correct God's profit number then y'all I don't I don't believe anybody here is trying to do like this but this this is you start talking to people it is if you see it at this time thought process is becoming really privileged in it today in it that's right it it scares me and I you tell about Mourning this is something to mourn over when somebody that's been in the message for years for 40 or 50 years and then they come around and say well I just don't believe what brother Randall's saying here in so many words they might not say exactly like that but right that um we gotta have a rock to stand on let's look at verse uh let's just start reading in verse one a Miriam and Aaron's fake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman being married for he getting married an Ethiopian woman and they said hath the Lord and be spoken only by Moses hath he not spoken also by us and the Lord heard it now the man Moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the Earth and remember we talked about meekness before right if you really meet God will fight your battles so Moses here he's not going to rile up and say Aaron and Miriam don't you know better but God comes up and fights his battle right and the Lord speaks suddenly into Moses and unto Aaron and unto Miriam come out you three unto the Tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out after all the many miracles that they had seen after all the signs and wonders that God had part of the Red Sea he had fed them in the wilderness he had done all these things and now Aaron and Miriam rose up and they thought well I I can show God's profit a better way and the Lord speaks suddenly into Moses and unto Aaron and Anthony I'm coming out you three into the Tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out and the Lord came down and the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the Tabernacle and called air in the mirror and they both came for you talking about something scary yeah we thought I was scared to be called to the principal's office yeah but the Lord himself is standing in the door of the Tabernacle says Aaron and Miriam come here I want to talk to you and he said here now my words if they're being Prophet among you out of the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak a name in a dream my servant Moses is not so who's faithful in all my house with him will I speak mouth to mouth that isn't it all that he didn't say mouth to ear or something like that the words in his mouth the spoken word of the Original Seed the word in God's mouth well he put in Moses mouth delivered to the people right I don't speak to him mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similar to you to the Lord shall be shall he behold I'm not in dark speeches is what Iranians had to battle with he was battling with something called gnosticism where they said we have these secret Mysteries there's some of the people all of the people will not be privy to will just tell it to just a little uh some of the people but that's not how God does it he does it publicly before everybody not in dark speeches right but before the whole people he had presented his his plan and showed them what kind of um show them his grace and mercy let's see where we're and the anger of the Lord was kindled against them and he departed and the cloud departed from off the Tabernacle and behold Miriam became lepers by the snow and Aaron looked upon Miriam and behold she was leftist and you know brother random talked about when Moses put his hand in his bosom and Drew it out and it was lepers that typified sin and he put it back and it was made just perfectly clean the leprosy is sin sin in your life and uh let's think about what Miriam was doing seeing what's really seeing is is unbelief you see just believe God's word God's provided a way to disbelieve God's profit the thought that she had a better way to do it and and reading further on down Moses intervened and uh God showed her grace amen but uh let's look at the Corinthians book of Correction 1957. no brother what God does is perfect we ain't got no business with our minds doing anything to it just leave it the way it is God did it God said it said it that settles it just take it or don't know how if I could explain it then I'd be equal with God I can't explain it I just believe it that's all that's all I'm asked to do now that doesn't mean a lot of people take this and say well I'm gonna uh adopt that lady Odyssey and spirit of laziness and not even try to understand just getting lazy and uh all I all I know is I believe it and now I'm gonna go home and sit in front of a TV and uh waste away my time and uh but God wants us to press into the kingdom like Paul said because uh that God gave us the word so that we would understand it we'll read a scripture in a second to kind of talk about what what this means that's all that's all I'm asked to do there's nobody has to explain it because it's beyond our intellectuals beyond our intellectuals but it's not beyond the holy spirit it's beyond our intelligence it's God who does it so it cannot be explained not just accepted by faith I say it's my private property and I believe it I cannot explain it so let's look at John chapter six foreign John chapter six verse 53. and I know we've all heard this before but sometimes it's good to just be a reminder then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say and do you accept to you the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life and if you're sweet it's my flesh and drinking my blood after eternal life and I will raise him up the last day for my flesh as meat indeed and my blood is drinking beets easy to eat in My Flesh and drinketh my blood growth in me and I am you know as the living father and Sydney and I live by the father so either for me he that he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did he man out or dead either of this bread shall live forever these things sitting in the synagogue who taught in Capernaum many therefore his disciples when they had heard they said this is a hard save you can hear it and so they tossed it out they didn't believe they didn't understand it so they tossed it out that's we just come across people sometimes that if they can't understand it then they I believe that this gospel has the message has everything we need it'll teach you how and the fish how to how to live how to treat your family everything we need you is in the Bible you don't need to go to the bookstore and buy all these books on uh how things how Mesopotamia was in the days of Jesus and all that kind of stuff uh if you know what I'm getting there um just because you don't understand it don't mean to go out you got to go out to the broken sisters and just find what you think what they have to say that everything that you need is in this uh little glass of Mana like part of the Covenant these things let's see and when Jesus knew himself with his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you you know things a lot of people and they don't understand something what nephew you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quick enough My Flesh process nothing the words that I speaking to eat our spirit and their life there are some of you that believe not and then jump on down to verse 67 and Jesus said under the 12th we also go away then Simon Peter answered them Lord to whom shall we go yeah I'll ask the lord of the eternal life now they didn't understand it then but just because you understand it don't throw it away right that's right just hang on okay patience that's right be patient and God will reveal it to you and they were patient and then a little bit longer further on down the road when they got to the upper room then they understood what he was talking about now the counter that argument is the the denominational world of the wrong Catholicism and and so forth they said well we'll understand it so we're going to take an intellectual concept and say Well it must be that when the priest says a few little words over the little wafer it turns into actual literal body instead of being patient they came up with something out of their own intellectualism and they came up with something where it's their act they actually believe that that little wafer is the literal Body of Christ and uh so instead of just being patient and waiting on God let me just finish up real quick just one more time more 1963 and when a man comes in the anointing of the Holy Ghost and with the word of the Lord would thus saith the Lord you better have sense and try to attack it because you find there's a hand of the Living God and it's heavy God's only provide a place that works at my church we're teaching now but remember when you leave here stop moving out of the truck now you're going in the green but lay in the presence of the sun don't add to what I've said don't take away what I've said because I speak the truth as far as I know it as the father has given to me so you don't add to it just say what I said and then if you say just what he said you believe what he said you know he said what Paul said you can have faith in it
