[12:53] one of us and father we just ask you to
[12:55] have your way with us and let your grace
[12:58] be sufficient to supply ever need and we
[13:01] know it is so we don't have to worry
[13:03] about that we just ask you to come on
[13:06] the scene and be in each one of our
[13:08] hearts and lives and to forgive our sins
[13:11] and cleanse us help us to walk in you
[13:14] and then to guide us in the
[13:16] understanding of your word because
[13:18] knowing that you and your word or one
[13:20] then as we're receiving the word we're
[13:23] receiving you into our hearts and our
[13:25] lives we love you and we thank you
[13:27] goddess name keep us in Jesus name
[13:37] John 1:1 in the beginning was the word
[13:40] Word was with God and the Word was God
[13:42] the same was in the beginning with God
[13:44] all things were made by him and without
[13:47] him was not anything made that was made
[13:50] in him was life and the life was a lot
[13:54] of men and a light shining in darkness
[13:56] and the darkness comprehended at night
[14:00] there's no way darkness can put out
[14:03] light there's no way it can comprehend
[14:07] what even light is okay so now we'll go
[14:10] to Genesis 2 and we'll start reading at
[14:14] verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not
[14:21] good that the man should be alone I will
[14:24] make him an help meet for him and notice
[14:28] everybody if you read that 90% of the
[14:31] people are gonna read ma te that is not
[14:36] dire that is not the word ma te that's
[14:42] the word M EE T okay now listen this is
[14:49] what I always read it to when we're done
[14:51] when I do a waiting always read this
[14:53] scripture because I want the bride and
[14:56] the groom to understand what this is
[14:59] this is an out of the ground the Lord
[15:01] God formed every beast of the field they
[15:03] were follow the hour
[15:04] era and brought them unto Adam to see
[15:08] what he would call them and whatever
[15:10] Adam called then called every living
[15:13] creature that was the name thereof and
[15:15] Adam gave names to all the cattle and to
[15:18] the fowl of the air every beast of the
[15:20] field but for Adam there was not found
[15:23] an help meet for him when the Lord God
[15:26] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[15:29] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[15:31] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[15:34] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[15:36] from man made he a woman and brought her
[15:39] unto the man and Adam said this is now
[15:42] bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh
[15:45] she shall be called woman because she
[15:49] was taken
[15:50] out of maan now why would she call a
[15:52] woman because she was taken out of the
[15:57] man brother Maloney said if you went
[15:59] back I remember that and back in the
[16:01] original and try to get all the original
[16:03] time together here that you'd see that
[16:05] what that saying is the man now has a
[16:08] wound to reproduce himself so that's
[16:11] that's a good point all right and Adam
[16:14] said this is now bone of my bones and
[16:17] flesh of my flesh she shall be called
[16:19] woman because she was taken out of man
[16:21] therefore shall a man leave his father
[16:23] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[16:26] wife and they shall be one flesh you may
[16:30] be seated
[16:30] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[16:33] the word I want to try to continue the
[16:41] thought that we were bringing in
[16:42] Wednesday and bring it more into clarity
[16:47] but I want you to follow one point
[16:50] through the message today we've been in
[16:55] this message quite a while and you know
[16:58] mankind has went this way and went
[17:00] thattaway and then all kind of things
[17:03] and he has his own idea about what he
[17:06] thinks he sees but he don't take it and
[17:09] put it together in all the word all
[17:11] right and you hear a lot and the
[17:13] preachers will preach about it and
[17:15] they'll preach about a woman being a
[17:17] byproduct and all of their things
[17:20] they'll be rated relating you watch it
[17:23] it'll be down sizing the woman from the
[17:26] position that the Bible puts are in and
[17:30] trying to bring her to a position of
[17:33] something of lesser value now if I don't
[17:41] get nothing to you today listen why you
[17:43] awake she was taken from Adam whatever
[17:49] Adam was she was
[17:53] okay is that clear
[17:57] now brother branham said we'll read it
[17:59] in a minute that she was in him in
[18:01] theophany huh
[18:05] and he said she was in him in flesh all
[18:08] right then get it correctly because now
[18:11] I don't defend women you know to say
[18:17] well you know he just - he just - no
[18:19] he's got hook in his nose and you know
[18:21] his wife leaves him ground so he
[18:23] preaches try to defend women well now
[18:26] what are you gonna do trying to talk
[18:28] about the Bride of Christ that's all I
[18:31] ask
[18:33] are you gonna make the Bride of Christ
[18:36] or lower value I want to see that I want
[18:43] to see it in the Word of God that you
[18:45] can down the wife the Bride of Christ
[18:50] and maker of some lower value that's
[18:59] just you can call it what you want to I
[19:01] don't care it cause that's the way I've
[19:03] always been
[19:03] you know the people of this may see did
[19:06] I say they think the man is a big
[19:07] porterhouse steak you know the woman's a
[19:10] little old hamburgers you know yeah I'd
[19:14] like to see that in the Word of God and
[19:16] the prophets message but the truth will
[19:20] set us free I'm talking about the Bride
[19:22] of Christ right all right coming out to
[19:27] the Bride of Christ and what she is
[19:31] she's him in another form now you go
[19:35] with your by-product all you want to but
[19:37] go back and look up the word by-product
[19:42] well it just means something no show me
[19:45] where it means something of lesser value
[19:48] it's something off of the other it
[19:52] doesn't say lesser value it's something
[19:55] off of the other uh-huh in illustrating
[20:00] we we're in a day when you call it what
[20:02] they call that word now for medicine
[20:04] generic
[20:05] is that the word generic alright see we
[20:09] think generic people say I don't want
[20:11] generic I won't I want original you
[20:17] don't even know what you're talking
[20:18] about generic is the original just made
[20:23] to where they can get by all the gloves
[20:25] and the pipes and the things that they
[20:27] had the price to control it for 10 or 15
[20:29] years then you can make a generic off of
[20:33] that and people are saying they're
[20:36] generics don't do me no good you're
[20:37] taking the same identical vitamins here
[20:41] whatever this within it it's the same
[20:43] but it says what we got in their mind
[20:46] you know in our mind we thought generic
[20:51] is so these was made out of this over
[20:54] here needs money they made the same you
[20:55] just this when you get a patent on the
[20:58] medicine after so many years nobody
[21:01] can't copy that but after so many years
[21:04] they can make the same thing in a
[21:06] generic value think of the human being
[21:10] like that and the things of what we're
[21:12] talking about besides I got it written
[21:15] down to just make this statement up
[21:17] front how can God make anything
[21:24] imperfect now that's the text of the
[21:31] hotel how can God make anything
[21:35] imperfect you can show me how you can
[21:39] make it imperfect then we'll just stop
[21:41] the whole thing because he can't condemn
[21:43] us for being sinners see people who say
[21:48] well God made me this way I can't help
[21:50] it then they'll try to figure out
[21:52] something for the woman that comes in a
[21:55] situation that would make her of some
[21:59] thing that was made deliberately to do
[22:03] this that or the other and when you do
[22:08] you might got guilty of making that
[22:10] thing wrong okay
[22:12] that's the whole point now of the
[22:14] message all right so you go to sleep
[22:18] turn off your brains and do whatever but
[22:24] we've been trying for the past couple of
[22:25] services to get one point across
[22:29] Adam was God's original creation right
[22:36] first one okay humanly speaking he had
[22:41] made the other things and all that come
[22:43] down then he made man all right and Adam
[22:47] was made first a spiritual being to be
[22:51] the 1:26 man you know let us make man I
[22:53] mean he was made in that in a spiritual
[22:57] creation right then he was made into a
[23:03] physical creation in Genesis 2:7 all
[23:08] right
[23:08] putting that 1:26 man into the 2:7 you
[23:13] see Adam standing there the way God
[23:15] wanted all of his offspring to come
[23:21] forth are you with me Adam was the
[23:26] example because he was the first the
[23:29] first is always the example and that's
[23:31] why I was emphasizing in the message you
[23:33] know Wednesday that God doesn't begin a
[23:39] creation as a baby you know he begins a
[23:45] creation full-grown Adam was full-grown
[23:49] he was a man all right he wasn't a baby
[23:52] and then the years later he finally
[23:54] grown up and know God's original
[23:58] creation the beginning of any creation
[24:00] will automatically be full-grown right
[24:06] did you follow that one he so then we
[24:10] talked about the church on the debt
[24:12] pending college at the life see they
[24:14] came forward full-grown not babies
[24:18] full-grown 120 right they came forward
[24:24] they've had a couple cities I just said
[24:26] well
[24:31] that Judas was in the upper room I was
[24:33] talking about the upper room of the
[24:36] supper not the upper room of the point
[24:41] where the Holy Ghost fail all right but
[24:45] I'm glad you're at least listening so
[24:47] that does he play close attention I hope
[24:49] so I'm not upset because you said I'm
[24:51] glad you do because you're listening all
[24:54] right and that way you keep from being
[24:55] misunderstood if you tell me you know I
[24:58] said well hey brother Dale you said it
[25:00] otherwise oh I don't mind saying I can I
[25:03] can say I'm sorry and wrong there's no
[25:06] problem all right but see now Adam being
[25:09] God's example son he was what God wanted
[25:16] ever one of his children his offspring
[25:22] to be like okay now but we know that
[25:28] that did not transpire that way you know
[25:33] it did in the fact of Adam being created
[25:36] in that part
[25:38] all right then you'd have the eve coming
[25:40] with the same situation as Adam and
[25:42] being fine and perfect in creation not
[25:45] eternal in body
[25:47] now when you say perfect I don't mean
[25:50] always see does it differ between
[25:52] WordPerfect and eternal God created
[25:56] Adams body perfect but not eternal right
[26:01] all right so keep that in your mind of
[26:04] what we're talking about all right
[26:06] but you remember the thought I was
[26:08] trying to make Wednesday night about
[26:14] Adam being the example son but it was
[26:21] never going to come forth
[26:23] God knew we were going to follow he knew
[26:27] that if he made man on free moral agency
[26:30] that was all he had to do he didn't have
[26:33] to make him some way or design in some
[26:36] way that's what everybody said about the
[26:39] woman she she was made and designed be
[26:43] careful how you
[26:44] get that design you know be careful how
[26:51] you use a lot of the things like a
[26:53] brother got onto me one time he said
[26:55] you're talking about you know ear barbs
[26:59] and stuff like that then I said well you
[27:02] know what then women in the Old
[27:04] Testament warrior box with us it's wrong
[27:07] for us to where I'm gonna happen cuz we
[27:09] know the story but they wore them back
[27:12] then didn't he he said well the reason I
[27:15] am said you're talking about jewelry and
[27:16] stones said the devil that's in stones I
[27:21] said that's true that's right he's
[27:25] beautiful the way he was made and
[27:27] described as that diamonds and you know
[27:30] but you know what
[27:32] so was the breastplate of Aaron and God
[27:37] was designed in stone and diamonds and
[27:40] time
[27:40] so this don't run off and say well we
[27:43] got this you know get the whole story
[27:45] and then we can understand okay now so
[27:50] then what we were talking about why
[27:55] didn't God just create Adam and Eve
[27:59] create the rest of us that would have
[28:02] been his offspring and place to star in
[28:06] the garden and everything and no devil
[28:09] involved you realize that would have
[28:15] been a beautiful story wouldn't it we
[28:22] would worship Him as our Father we would
[28:26] have been happy about to call him daddy
[28:27] you know father we see we know the rest
[28:32] of the story that God had attributes
[28:36] that he was going to see displayed well
[28:40] now but remember attributes cannot be a
[28:46] deliberate making of sin there is no
[28:50] attribute of sin that would not to a
[28:52] Christian now everything else is that
[28:54] you know what
[28:57] god never made anything wrong so
[29:00] everything he ever made is made perfect
[29:07] all right you said he made a perfect
[29:09] Center no no no he didn't make no Center
[29:12] we done the CNN okay now but you see why
[29:18] didn't God just leave it as to put it in
[29:21] a situation like that we said well it
[29:25] was because he had attributes well no
[29:28] that's good but now are you going to
[29:31] take the attributes and make it change
[29:35] God's original plan you realize if that
[29:41] my point is if God was going to have a
[29:44] million offspring
[29:45] you know when sinnard the picture he
[29:49] didn't gain any more offspring but
[29:52] neither did he lose anything right you
[29:57] can't do that now you're playing your
[29:59] games in your head but not think about
[30:04] it wouldn't it have been wonderful to
[30:07] leave it there would have been no sin
[30:10] there would've been no heartaches no
[30:12] trouble you remember what I was trying
[30:20] to bring out Wednesday night I hope you
[30:21] go back and listen to it you see you and
[30:26] I would have been spoiled brats too we
[30:30] would have been little old spoiled brats
[30:32] that it would have been nothing involved
[30:35] in it would have had nothing to do with
[30:36] anything
[30:37] we was just been thrown out Dyer and
[30:40] left at that situation but you see a
[30:45] true Christian I said a true Christian
[30:51] loves God because even though he puts us
[30:56] through trials and troubles and
[30:59] heartaches for our perfection we love
[31:03] him because he done you not tell you
[31:08] what I don't love him called sin you
[31:10] ain't never heard
[31:11] well you you just don't do it sit up to
[31:15] a lady one time you know the Bible said
[31:17] all things work together for good well
[31:19] how could it work together when I got a
[31:20] dead husband there I said you're not
[31:23] getting the Bible the Bible said all
[31:26] things work together so now you're gonna
[31:29] change your thoughts see that's what I
[31:31] was trying to get at Wednesday night of
[31:33] the point you realize by coming the way
[31:36] we came in the fall it brains and I'll
[31:41] keep using that word to make it right
[31:43] because it brings a true Christian
[31:45] a true child and a son and daughter of
[31:49] God down to a greater understanding of
[31:52] God in his ways and his how he does
[31:56] things and what he is and his nature and
[31:59] everything whole lot greater that it
[32:04] would have been if they had never been a
[32:05] fouled and hadn't been none of these
[32:06] conditions so now which one was God's
[32:09] original plan was his original plan did
[32:12] this brought us into being you know no
[32:17] sin no problem honor no that could have
[32:20] been his original plan cuz these
[32:22] attributes that he had had his original
[32:26] plan in his mind to come the way we came
[32:29] right you can't make that he brought us
[32:35] wrong and then we're gonna take that
[32:38] make us right no he knew from the
[32:41] beginning when he created us brother Ron
[32:45] said he knew if he gave us free moral
[32:47] agency we would follow right well I
[32:56] don't mean man a woman either woman now
[32:58] that's all of us but are you are you got
[33:02] with me with this out that's trying to
[33:03] brain then we'll try to get into a point
[33:05] that this is God's original plan in way
[33:11] is being displayed now this is what he
[33:18] wanted he just didn't want sons and
[33:22] daughters
[33:24] he wanted sons and daughters listen
[33:27] because this was growing lighter for
[33:29] messages down the road he wanted his
[33:32] children to have his nature right no she
[33:42] wants your children to have your nature
[33:44] then we get rid of the bad parts right
[33:47] you know okay but there's at least
[33:50] something there that you'd like for your
[33:52] kids to have your nature because that's
[33:57] what it is and God's nature is what he's
[33:58] trying to display that's what I was
[34:01] trying to explain to you a few weeks ago
[34:03] that how can you see the soul of God
[34:05] through the Old Testament you followed a
[34:08] body in a couple of places you can
[34:10] follow the spirit of mourning mankind
[34:13] witnesses mention of his soul you know
[34:16] what I mean by mankind David then we get
[34:20] into it and it's old longing after God
[34:22] what is that the soul is the nature of
[34:26] the spirit so then God wants his nature
[34:32] displayed you remember how we were
[34:36] bringing it out in the Old Testament who
[34:39] was it it took care of them people that
[34:41] wouldn't wouldn't kill him when they
[34:43] done wrong sure a lot of them died but a
[34:49] lot of them was preserved by the nature
[34:52] of God being on display right okay well
[35:01] then why can't we see the whole thing is
[35:03] God's nature the whole creation of
[35:07] mankind all that's involved is bringing
[35:13] out his nature and displaying it you
[35:20] could find what God is like by his
[35:22] creation that's what we're talking about
[35:25] today perfect creation made the way God
[35:32] wanted it
[35:34] okay doing that we've been dealing for
[35:38] quite a while to make sure you stay with
[35:40] the correct point God's original
[35:45] creation was Adam in the way he was
[35:47] brought into being all right so he
[35:50] brought him first into being as the 1:26
[35:53] man Dhiru that you know the garden and
[35:58] everything he was all but then you come
[36:04] into the 2:7 man well remember the 1:26
[36:09] man can't be any different if you put
[36:12] him in flesh that's why I kept
[36:14] emphasizing to you there's no way for
[36:17] that 1:26 and 27 man to fall there's no
[36:21] sin in the 1:26 ma'am there's no sin in
[36:26] the one 26 and 27
[36:30] nothing no no that person can't follow
[36:35] because that's eternal life because
[36:38] that's what's your profit we spent weeks
[36:40] and weeks and weeks describing those
[36:42] things how brother Branham was bringing
[36:44] out the things of eternal life and all
[36:46] the things we went service after service
[36:48] and I still got it here because see what
[36:51] it does the reason I bring a lot of the
[36:53] things they put them on the internet all
[36:58] right they put the quotes on the
[36:59] internet so then somebody ain't just
[37:02] listening to us and and not being able
[37:05] to follow and know where everything's
[37:06] that I give them the quotes on the
[37:09] internet even if even if I don't read
[37:12] them in the service they're placed on
[37:15] the internet where the people can take
[37:18] that and read it huh see so over and
[37:23] over and over we've been describing one
[37:25] we're brother Brown were talking about
[37:26] in blasphemous names 1962 that he's
[37:32] talking about how God breathed into the
[37:34] nostrils of Adam and he became a living
[37:39] soul
[37:40] he said he breed eternal life so God's
[37:46] original plan
[37:47] and started out not as a lost sinner or
[37:50] even a neutral situation that would put
[37:56] it to be you know there's just no value
[37:58] part
[37:59] he started original creation out with
[38:03] eternal life in his soul you said but I
[38:12] don't see how that could be done well
[38:13] then you just go argue with God about it
[38:15] and you talk to your prophet and see it
[38:21] was eternal life not just as we've
[38:25] called some nature doing something it
[38:28] was God giving eternal life to Adam in
[38:34] his soul become a living soul he said
[38:40] all right you say but brother Adam Adam
[38:44] died I said this word I mean to
[38:48] the blaspheme this night he said but
[38:51] before Adam died said he had a lamb now
[38:55] what was important that I'm making
[38:56] listen to this statement you say Adam
[39:00] failed but the lamb was provided for
[39:04] Adam because already in the nostrils had
[39:11] become the breath of the eternal God
[39:17] already in the nostrils had become the
[39:20] breath of eternal life in the Adam
[39:23] alright see then that could not fall as
[39:28] we went through showing it in the sealed
[39:31] book where bread around said that Adam
[39:33] fell from eternal life to death but he
[39:38] never fell to death like we talked about
[39:40] death and nothing he felt as we do talk
[39:42] about death just naturally dying he
[39:45] never lost his eternal life you can't
[39:48] take that back once God gives you
[39:52] something he can't take it back all
[39:53] right so then brought around said
[39:56] especially into Adam he breathe
[40:01] life and Adam became an eternal person
[40:04] with God an amateur God right so when he
[40:12] was put into 2:7 and flesh that flesh
[40:21] man had ruled of the garden we can talk
[40:25] about the spirit man heaven rule but the
[40:29] flash man had rule in the garden right I
[40:34] know it was mentioned another day about
[40:36] some you know he's brought up about that
[40:39] well it was said to Adam you know in
[40:42] there about tilling the soil tilling the
[40:46] ground you know he controlled the earth
[40:48] we'll remember before the foul he wasn't
[40:51] plowing with a mule and working he was
[40:55] just moving trees and doing what he
[40:56] wanted to do because he was that the
[40:58] taker care of the garden but when the
[41:01] fall came then the Bible said by the
[41:04] sweat of your brow he would have to make
[41:07] his living so there's a difference
[41:08] between the point see it was given to
[41:11] Adam because Adam would have been ruler
[41:15] of the earth and he could do as he
[41:19] wanted to and he can call it the Bible
[41:21] calls it that he would no man to till
[41:23] the soil he said well then he must have
[41:26] been a going tell it well everyone had a
[41:27] woman to do with it whatever God wanted
[41:30] to be done with it in the garden Adam
[41:32] could have done it but it's not not
[41:37] horrible it'd be a wonderful thing it'll
[41:43] be a wonderful thing one day when we're
[41:45] in the in the future hole if we don't
[41:48] want that tree that I witness a tree
[41:50] move see we don't think about everything
[41:54] being labor and sweat not when the sin
[41:56] entered it becomes the sweat of your
[41:57] brow before it wasn't but now don't
[42:02] never get into don't ever get into let's
[42:06] see who in it
[42:09] I won't state it so but there's a group
[42:11] that believes that what we're doing here
[42:13] a big church
[42:14] do that here we are and one day God this
[42:19] comes down and takes over well one day
[42:22] we're slaving and struggling and going
[42:25] to General Motors and building cars and
[42:27] fussing and stewing and sweating the
[42:30] next day we're happy because that's the
[42:33] way they describe heaven they've heard
[42:35] it they describe heaven as to be one day
[42:39] you're sad a next day everybody's happy
[42:41] we still building cars I don't know who
[42:43] we're gonna sell them to but that's
[42:46] their doctrine that's that's a great
[42:48] message I mean a great group of people
[42:50] in the religious realm well I don't
[42:54] think it's that away I just think that
[42:57] we we were put here for the purpose all
[42:59] right now then getting to the point that
[43:06] we want to start with today because we
[43:09] want to talk about a perfect creation
[43:13] not eternal creation cuz there's no such
[43:16] thing there's no such thing as an
[43:19] eternal something when you talk about
[43:22] creation creation means it has a
[43:24] beginning you say well you turn alive I
[43:27] fried it spice down to you you know but
[43:30] it has of time that it comes into you -
[43:32] we'll get to that one these days all
[43:35] right now don't talk about the eternal
[43:38] creations just leave that alone
[43:40] just forget it leave it to the point
[43:43] that God is going to achieve on earth
[43:47] what he desired was a whole point of
[43:51] Wednesday night see what he desired and
[43:54] he desired to fulfill all of his
[43:57] attributes right so then it would mean
[44:03] that Satan would enter the picture the
[44:06] tree of knowledge was already in the
[44:07] garden everything was not ready and it
[44:10] was going to be that away all right now
[44:14] in doing that then it would leave that
[44:18] man as I said the 1:26 man we can see
[44:22] that he's the spirit man our spiritual
[44:25] child or a son of God or whatever
[44:28] daughter you know within the two-seven
[44:32] and that's why I love wordings the way
[44:34] it is and the things hue it says because
[44:36] right around them go ahead and let's
[44:38] read this number two because we want to
[44:40] get that point from the message adoption
[44:44] 1960 just wants you to get the point of
[44:49] what brother Branham will put them
[44:50] together Wow sis before we go any
[44:56] further Genesis 1:26 I'll pick it up
[44:59] Wednesday when God made man now watch
[45:02] him before he made man before he made
[45:05] man he called himself el Li la la Elohim
[45:11] the word means in the Hebrew the
[45:15] self-existing this does huh all by
[45:20] himself
[45:21] nothing existed before him he was all
[45:25] the existence there ever was
[45:27] self-existence 1l lol ahem means the
[45:31] all-sufficient all-powerful almighty
[45:35] self existent one all right so the 1:26
[45:40] and 27 man was a part of that that's
[45:48] just what he's explaining that's a part
[45:52] of God all right now watch but in
[45:56] Genesis 2 he made a man he said giving
[46:00] all them what ye h UJ u vu h and why you
[46:04] and Jehovah what did it mean I am the
[46:07] all existence one who has created
[46:10] something off of myself to be a son of
[46:15] mine or a temporary or an amateur little
[46:19] one of mine now he's got him in flash
[46:21] he's into Jehovah means that he gave the
[46:27] man to be an amateur God I like that one
[46:31] Jehovah means now you get it down here
[46:35] what he said
[46:35] Jehovah means is like a father with his
[46:37] family but what's he giving you the
[46:39] definition what is Jehovah it means
[46:42] he gave man to be an amateur God so
[46:46] we're tied up into the name of Jehovah
[46:48] right because he's father God he made a
[46:51] man an amateur God so he isn't self
[46:54] existence anymore he exists with his
[46:57] family that's what I love
[46:58] he's got the Elohim enough so now he is
[47:01] Jehovah Jehovah means the one who exists
[47:04] with his family Jehovah the one who once
[47:08] existed in self existence but now exists
[47:13] with his family and his little ones with
[47:15] him how a more wonderful could a man
[47:19] with no education describe an eternal
[47:24] God and be it
[47:28] so you following me see then the genesis
[47:31] to man a Genesis one man is a part of
[47:36] God Jesus is to man is a creation of God
[47:40] he just simply puts the 1:26 and 27 into
[47:43] the two seven so that's blasphemous name
[47:45] he breathed into his nostrils and he
[47:48] became an eternal person
[47:50] well Adam couldn't die from that eternal
[47:53] life in his soul well Eve was in Adam in
[47:58] theophany and she still stayed in
[48:01] theophany and Adam put on down and
[48:04] coming towards flash them according
[48:07] brother branham you want to read him for
[48:10] the questions and answers on Hebrews Eve
[48:17] was a part of Adam brother Branham says
[48:19] in theophany and cities when she was a
[48:26] part of Adam in flesh
[48:32] and listen in that is a quote where
[48:37] brother branham said that Genesis to man
[48:42] in other words he's ruler of the earth
[48:46] because the 126 is in two to seven right
[48:49] so he's ruler of the earth he said one
[48:52] day his sons and daughters will come to
[48:56] that same thing again now there's you
[48:59] statue of perfect man sons and daughters
[49:04] are going to come to that right back to
[49:06] that situation that Adam and Eve existed
[49:11] while they were in the garden he's old
[49:14] that'll never happen well it may not be
[49:16] but if just a minute but it's gonna be
[49:18] all right cause your prophet said it
[49:20] would okay do we believe him to be a
[49:24] prophet like that if he said it that's
[49:25] what it's gonna be but Eve was in Adam
[49:30] in theophany he said one put in flesh
[49:33] and one in theophany questions and
[49:35] answers on Hebrews so Eve had a part of
[49:42] God - she was 126 man because it says in
[49:46] the 126 man what let us make man in our
[49:51] own image and let them not just the man
[49:58] them man and woman right so Eve had a
[50:05] right listen well as anybody else that's
[50:07] why I've always said new sisters to
[50:09] doubt the point that you God gave you
[50:12] eternal life that that eternal life you
[50:14] have is not as sufficient as the eternal
[50:17] life given to a man hey we know the
[50:21] story the woman stays out of the pulpit
[50:24] she stays out of running that part but
[50:28] she had her own pulpits you can preach
[50:30] to her children right she can testify to
[50:35] one another
[50:37] they'll never belittle what you've got
[50:39] well I know what I'm just nuts well now
[50:42] you're trying you're propping up your
[50:44] excuses it
[50:45] you do and you just coming up to the
[50:47] point of saying well I can't produce it
[50:49] well I'm not supposed to produce it
[50:51] because it's only for the man now
[50:53] there's no quote in the Bible there is
[50:55] no prophets quote for that filly it's
[50:58] short to me I don't mind making
[51:06] statements like that why because it
[51:08] would tie up to all of the word if it
[51:09] loves the eternal life you have is just
[51:12] as good as the eternal out of the man
[51:14] hash okay
[51:21] one would be in What's in flesh the
[51:25] other one was still left in theophany
[51:27] and brother Branham now here's what's
[51:29] going to get to us in I mean right
[51:30] around said Adam was lonely that's where
[51:34] we read that scripture Adam was lonely
[51:38] saying why would Adam lonely hmm
[51:48] mysterious why was that him lonely he
[51:51] could look at the animals and he could
[51:52] see the male and the female right and he
[51:57] thought well why don't I have a another
[52:02] hive you know why it was lonely cuz he
[52:06] had one hey what you looking at the
[52:11] animal right I said something with prop
[52:14] up stories with what he was looking at
[52:17] the animals he had with inside of him
[52:22] what he wanted outside of him where he
[52:25] could contact it right he was lonely you
[52:34] know what brother Brown said about that
[52:36] too he said as Adam was lonely he said
[52:41] God was lonely too why was God lonely
[52:46] now dude he didn't have a lot to do and
[52:48] a whole lot of things could keep him
[52:50] entertained it was the fact that there
[52:52] was something missing that he couldn't
[52:57] fellowship with
[52:59] why because it was in him he was in the
[53:04] end and he was lonely too okay so you
[53:09] can do a lot of preaching with a lot of
[53:11] things but now listen he then she being
[53:20] part of him brother Brennan says in the
[53:23] beginning in the creation in the
[53:25] theophany I'm reading it from paragraph
[53:30] 829 and she was put and she was part of
[53:35] him down here in this creation she could
[53:39] not be divided into another creation she
[53:43] had to be made the same creation yeah so
[53:52] now what does it mean by product well we
[53:58] got that out by product did it as they
[54:00] were nothing I won't get regional see we
[54:05] have all that like one brother one time
[54:06] he said brother offered him some
[54:09] seedless grapes he said don't I ain't
[54:11] gonna eat no seedless grapes ain't gonna
[54:13] eat nothing got no seed in it
[54:22] where did that great come from that was
[54:26] seedless from a seed right you get it
[54:39] the seed looks great somewhere had a
[54:42] seed that developed down then they
[54:44] further away can describe the process or
[54:46] what they do with it and they got to do
[54:47] certain things over here and this has
[54:49] got to be done over here and it's got to
[54:50] do that and it finally comes down to no
[54:52] seed we see it point was they can't
[54:57] reproduce itself it's all right but
[55:02] listen Eve was in Adam and that's what
[55:09] made Adam lonely
[55:21] now no animal I listen what do we do we
[55:25] got the whole story we study the
[55:26] prophets we know what he created
[55:29] everyone male and female right ever
[55:34] animal was created male and female right
[55:38] but when it come to the human race
[55:42] he only created a male
[55:50] well he said well she come out then as
[55:57] if I product but you don't listen to the
[56:02] things that the Prophet says about it
[56:06] you listening to what you want to listen
[56:08] to in your own mind that you've been
[56:10] taught by these great glorious preachers
[56:13] that you love because they make you
[56:14] shout and glory Alleluia and run the
[56:17] aisles and when you go home you don't
[56:19] even know what they told let alone
[56:22] whether it's right or not that's no
[56:25] business of mine that's yours no but yet
[56:31] I had him being lonely was because he
[56:36] was in him where was she coming from now
[56:45] God have identified this theophany part
[56:47] for Eve right because he was still in
[56:50] theophany but in Adam when he was
[56:53] created now are you with me Eve was in
[57:02] Adam when Adam was created if not words
[57:05] come from since what I'm saying you got
[57:09] by product like I told you I don't like
[57:13] these jokes the preachers might you know
[57:15] and they'll say that warmish ain't
[57:16] nothing but a by-product so you take her
[57:18] to Walmart and she'll buy of a product
[57:20] in there I think that's close to
[57:22] blasphemy now that's as straight as I am
[57:27] that's close to blaspheming because
[57:31] you're making the woman to be degraded
[57:37] that's the whole purpose of mankind and
[57:40] the preaching sounds like it we just
[57:43] remember one thing if you don't remember
[57:45] nothing else and you think about how
[57:47] sorry women are you just remember there
[57:50] is a Bride of Christ now you are
[57:54] throwing off on her dip yourself
[58:02] you're degrading her wouldn't that turn
[58:05] out to be blaspheming if you're
[58:09] degrading something God made that's
[58:11] blaspheming so do what you want to I
[58:13] don't get along too good with people
[58:16] anyway and I never tried to but I try to
[58:18] do one thing it's try to tell you the
[58:20] truth there's plain as I can where you
[58:24] can think about it to say buy product is
[58:28] not buy products is one old model T
[58:33] Donny's got one down there old model T
[58:35] they love him time they're on rent on me
[58:37] I do too could we kid with a different
[58:39] you know and all that the sparks in the
[58:41] answer but if we going to California
[58:48] don't put me in a Model T when I got a
[58:51] brand-new Ford sitting there right don't
[58:57] put me in the Model T now we got two
[59:00] brand-new forward well you know what to
[59:02] write what the Model T Model T come over
[59:06] something else the brand-new Ford is a
[59:09] bi-product off the Model T the best way
[59:23] you can do with an old model T it's a
[59:25] horse and buggy I guess I don't know
[59:27] what you do because it's the horsepower
[59:30] it's this power at all I always never
[59:32] haven't wondered that all these rocket
[59:34] this end out in space they'll tell you
[59:36] how many horsepower that that Rockets
[59:41] got well I reckon it's because they
[59:45] started out with figuring how much one
[59:47] horse could pull or something I don't
[59:49] know but are you with me where are you
[59:53] going to find a by-product as being
[59:55] something wrong
[59:59] any byproducts you can think of means it
[1:00:02] comes off of you only get it in Webster
[1:00:04] it means it comes off of and there is a
[1:00:06] dictionary somewhere that you'll find
[1:00:09] that it says even a by-product now
[1:00:11] quoted it for years it's of equal value
[1:00:16] because it is the Model T the brand-new
[1:00:22] Ford is of greater value right but it's
[1:00:26] the same value it's the same horses the
[1:00:28] same metal it's the same things now if
[1:00:33] they've come from atom
[1:00:35] not as an original creation that's what
[1:00:37] a statement want to go in the animal
[1:00:39] kingdom there's no such thing as a
[1:00:40] by-product animal kingdom right male
[1:00:45] female male female male female
[1:00:48] there's no by-product in the animal
[1:00:50] kingdom that's because God created the
[1:00:56] male and he created the female well
[1:00:59] don't you think it's greater that
[1:01:02] instead of taking atom standing there
[1:01:04] and reaching over and getting a handful
[1:01:07] of clay and made Eve he took part of
[1:01:23] atom which was a perfect creation right
[1:01:30] Adams body was created perfect come on
[1:01:33] you agreed with that while ago but don't
[1:01:35] always agree with me if you don't do it
[1:01:37] on his legs somewhere down the Mesa to
[1:01:38] be reminded of better randomly
[1:01:44] emphasizes the eve was not taken from
[1:01:47] another lump she was taken from Adam as
[1:01:54] a by-product now change the wording to
[1:01:58] where you'll think about Eve was she not
[1:02:01] a part of Adam no he removed rib made
[1:02:09] Eve that made her part of Adam and Adam
[1:02:14] said she is now bone of my bone and
[1:02:21] flesh of my flesh she shall be called a
[1:02:26] woman
[1:02:31] you didn't get the word eve until she
[1:02:35] fell come on read you Bible she didn't
[1:02:39] get that letter I mean that name Eve
[1:02:41] until she fell because that name Eve
[1:02:44] says mother of all living at the time
[1:02:48] Adam in his creation and even her
[1:02:51] creation
[1:02:52] there was no children no offspring
[1:02:56] she was the mother of what would have
[1:03:00] come from Adam at that time that would
[1:03:04] have been the point but it's not that
[1:03:05] she's just a woman are you following me
[1:03:11] trying to get to a point to get you away
[1:03:14] from the thoughts of a byproduct being
[1:03:18] something of lesser value types and any
[1:03:27] types what do you got you got to boat up
[1:03:29] you got a flogged rolled in and took you
[1:03:31] down two logs and you made it and fixed
[1:03:33] him a boat that's the top then the top
[1:03:38] is greater ocean liner run down through
[1:03:40] the ocean now which one do you think is
[1:03:42] greater which one would you rather have
[1:03:49] for selling purposes the old model tees
[1:03:52] all right you probably get more for the
[1:03:55] old model T and you get for a brand new
[1:03:57] forward that but we're not trying to
[1:03:58] sell anything we're trying to realize
[1:04:01] what's taking place that God created
[1:04:05] everything perfect and he could not
[1:04:07] create anything imperfect
[1:04:14] yes but brother Dale I still think
[1:04:16] by-product ain't as good as a regional
[1:04:20] don't try to talk to me about it then
[1:04:22] I'll keep my I don't I don't see overlay
[1:04:24] man okay but I'll keep my mind heater
[1:04:29] and an air conditioner and all in pain
[1:04:32] and then icing on it and driving across
[1:04:35] the country and I we used to be in the
[1:04:37] mold Model T's which one what is the
[1:04:40] Model T before one of them
[1:04:43] but anyhow I remember they had to break
[1:04:45] selling brakes a head-on was a leather
[1:04:48] band twisted around the driveshaft that
[1:04:53] was first original brakes you won't go
[1:05:01] back okay well we buy product God
[1:05:11] started out the way he wanted it with
[1:05:12] his children now listen you realized in
[1:05:16] what I'm saying a by-product of that
[1:05:19] that he started out with will finish up
[1:05:22] in this last days in a bride that will
[1:05:25] walk up on this earth for a short time
[1:05:27] as ruler of this earth now if you want
[1:05:33] to call it by-product you're throwing a
[1:05:35] lot do head but see the reason is
[1:05:38] because the man is the man like my
[1:05:42] mother used to say she said a man said
[1:05:46] he can get out and commit adultery he
[1:05:47] can do everything in the book said he
[1:05:50] puts on his suit and he goes to church
[1:05:51] and said he'd called a brother did a
[1:05:56] woman go out and have adultery one man
[1:05:58] she's a prostitute and a
[1:06:00] everything else for the rest of her life
[1:06:02] because everybody remembers it
[1:06:05] she's never a sister is that the way you
[1:06:11] think about and hey sister don't get all
[1:06:14] build up about it cuz I'm bragging on
[1:06:16] you I'm talking about a Bride of Christ
[1:06:18] because hey I thought we was all in the
[1:06:21] Bride of Christ
[1:06:22] I thought we men was in the Bride of
[1:06:24] Christ I thought that's what we was was
[1:06:27] Christ in His Church within that put us
[1:06:31] all to be the same Hey
[1:06:33] we know the story like we know the woman
[1:06:37] don't get in the pulpit to preach right
[1:06:41] we got the story well I thought you
[1:06:45] might be slipping a little bit over on
[1:06:47] it no when I started going hi honey how
[1:06:49] you do it you can talk about being
[1:06:51] slipping or this one
[1:06:57] probably when I've done that on internet
[1:06:59] I did learn that in the way back here to
[1:07:01] go and the kids and say that personal
[1:07:03] desires not so what is that and they
[1:07:06] finally described it I didn't know okay
[1:07:08] get off of that okay listen
[1:07:12] talking about why would it say in
[1:07:17] Genesis let me get to the point of this
[1:07:21] why did it say in Genesis that I'll make
[1:07:27] him a helpmeet I'm telling you walk out
[1:07:34] of this building go across the street go
[1:07:37] anywhere you want to and say a helpmeet
[1:07:40] and they'll corrects you in a hurry and
[1:07:42] tell you it's a helpmate because that's
[1:07:49] what grandma called it and grandpa
[1:07:51] called it and they called it my mom used
[1:07:53] to call it Chattanooga but I don't know
[1:07:56] how to say Chattanooga old brother
[1:08:00] Ratliff used to say Lou you go down to
[1:08:02] Lulu we don't have to call it Lulu right
[1:08:07] but why does it say help meat and not
[1:08:10] make
[1:08:19] okay brothers get on over them - I don't
[1:08:26] I've marked it off but it's number five
[1:08:30] supposed to be in you get to number six
[1:08:33] we'll roll it back it up Genesis 2:18
[1:08:35] and I will make him an help meet for him
[1:08:39] I'll make him a helpmate
[1:08:44] what does that word meet the definition
[1:08:50] because with Strong's Concordance 5828
[1:08:54] it means to help to succor you know you
[1:09:00] know where do you sympathize with
[1:09:01] somebody you put up with it you sucker
[1:09:03] you kind of put on you go along with it
[1:09:05] okay help
[1:09:06] sucker one who helps alright that's the
[1:09:11] word meat okay mate is only missing two
[1:09:17] times in the Bible so we'll go ahead to
[1:09:19] number seven we'll pick up that from
[1:09:20] Isaiah 34 and 615 he's talking about her
[1:09:25] out in the nest and the different things
[1:09:27] he told me everyone with her mate
[1:09:30] alright the Hebrew letter comes strong
[1:09:34] 74 68 the word mate means a female
[1:09:40] companion it means an a mate it means a
[1:09:47] neighbor woman and you got it this
[1:09:54] sounds good female companion that's in
[1:10:01] Brazil and I asked him what did wedding
[1:10:02] mean code they got us messed up you've
[1:10:04] heard the story where I call that sister
[1:10:06] a a hamburger and I say in meat and the
[1:10:10] brother was interpreted mate and they
[1:10:13] was dying laugh and I said Billy you
[1:10:14] messed up somewhere
[1:10:16] we stopped the whole thing cuz I knew he
[1:10:18] wouldn't interpret in what I say it when
[1:10:21] I said what did you interfere he said I
[1:10:23] interpreted mate that's what it is I
[1:10:26] said ain't in the Bible Billy yeah get
[1:10:30] your Bible we look in front of 300
[1:10:32] people
[1:10:33] let's get your Bible your folks have
[1:10:36] been reading what I read I said what'd
[1:10:39] he say he said I've never seen that it
[1:10:42] says meet and I asked him what was
[1:10:46] wedding in their terminologies you know
[1:10:48] what they call it a companion he said
[1:10:53] well that's good to be good for their
[1:10:54] language not good for our language right
[1:10:57] a female companion okay we're in the
[1:11:05] part of the legends and we're out in the
[1:11:06] part of the homosexuals and we're in the
[1:11:08] part of all these things it's all messed
[1:11:10] up right and what does it mean when it
[1:11:14] says a mate it can be a neighbor's a
[1:11:17] neighbor woman now you know what that
[1:11:21] means don't you
[1:11:22] it means that you're running around with
[1:11:25] the neighbor the word mate is not in the
[1:11:30] Bible there in Genesis it's meet because
[1:11:35] she's a sucker she's a sympathizer with
[1:11:38] her with him she's a helper she's
[1:11:41] actually heal made manifest in another
[1:11:43] forum will you go that way the wife is
[1:11:47] the husband in another form
[1:11:49] I thought we spoke to be one and the
[1:11:51] twain shall be one you get what I mean
[1:11:58] you read it mate you can say it's a
[1:12:01] female companion a prostitute or
[1:12:05] anything you want to put in there a
[1:12:09] neighbour woman but the word em eet roll
[1:12:16] it back to that one now up or down every
[1:12:19] way y'all go always telling the wrong
[1:12:21] way okay and what does it mean the word
[1:12:26] meat is to help to succor understand be
[1:12:35] sympathetic right help sugar one of the
[1:12:41] helps
[1:12:42] well because she's part of you what is
[1:12:46] the Bride of Christ is it not that she
[1:12:52] is him in another form called the bride
[1:12:58] sons and daughters of God our God in
[1:13:02] another form called a bride that's where
[1:13:07] you men order wake up you know you can
[1:13:09] talk about this now the other but just
[1:13:10] remember when you put that woman in that
[1:13:12] I'm telling them preachers out there on
[1:13:14] the Internet is listening
[1:13:15] we've got to borrow blush go all right
[1:13:18] you put it by product didn't what have
[1:13:22] you got
[1:13:23] you're not making her a part of him and
[1:13:27] you're talking about the bride of Jesus
[1:13:29] Christ so when you're talking about a
[1:13:31] male and a female according to Paul Paul
[1:13:34] is describing the husband and wife right
[1:13:38] the day become one Ryan well you know
[1:13:47] where the trouble of that thing going
[1:13:48] become one well I can't help it if the
[1:13:50] women make their self that way now I'm
[1:13:53] not responsible for that part we're
[1:13:56] living in a for men and women boat we're
[1:13:59] living in a garbage can day if you don't
[1:14:01] admit to that you're in bad shape
[1:14:03] when I tell him about the good ones
[1:14:10] according to Solomon the worst thing a
[1:14:12] man could get is a woman she's a
[1:14:16] thousand times more easy to be deceived
[1:14:20] come on with him
[1:14:27] and he had a thousand with a real true
[1:14:31] wife it's part of you he's a part of you
[1:14:40] she's not a byproduct or something out
[1:14:43] somewhere through Christianity in the
[1:14:47] natural reading of the Bible the husband
[1:14:49] and wife was supposed to be one the
[1:14:51] natural reading through the spiritual
[1:14:53] reading the husband and wife has born
[1:14:55] again Christian is supposed to be one
[1:15:03] that's why I told my wife years ago see
[1:15:06] I've never worried about her running
[1:15:07] around on me I'm entrusting everything
[1:15:11] else that's fine but this is one thing
[1:15:13] October could you see one thing and then
[1:15:15] she ain't never got to worry about me
[1:15:17] running around on her cuz you know what
[1:15:19] if we're going in the rapture we're
[1:15:20] going to make that thing right here we
[1:15:23] ain't gonna make it right and glory some
[1:15:25] worry we're gonna make it right here so
[1:15:27] they ain't no such thing is her
[1:15:29] committing adultery in thinking she's
[1:15:32] going in the rapture with me ain't no
[1:15:33] such thing as me committing adultery
[1:15:35] think I'm going with her that's how
[1:15:38] plain brother daily is why it needs to
[1:15:40] be straight here not cause some people
[1:15:49] like a priest one time like that and had
[1:15:56] an opportunity to have a whole lot of
[1:15:57] money stuck in my pocket because he's
[1:16:00] afraid his wife is gonna divorce him so
[1:16:02] he want me to hold that money until he
[1:16:04] got through telling her about it and he
[1:16:07] got through telling her about it and he
[1:16:08] come back so I want money back now so
[1:16:11] what you mean it's my money you gave it
[1:16:14] to me didn't you
[1:16:14] you know I'm saying I give it back but
[1:16:17] you I'm doing that to be serious not
[1:16:20] lifing cuz you see Church the husband
[1:16:25] and wife is a wonderful thing now ever
[1:16:28] husband and wife is not a type of Christ
[1:16:32] in the church right
[1:16:34] now am i right it's only a husband and
[1:16:39] wife that's right in Jesus Christ is the
[1:16:41] type of Christ in the church right see
[1:16:49] that's why we want these things straight
[1:16:50] here we've got a message that tells us
[1:16:55] how to straighten up things no okay
[1:17:01] what are you with me do you want a
[1:17:06] female companion do you want it to just
[1:17:12] be a mate does God want just a female
[1:17:14] companion as a mate when he said meet
[1:17:24] part of each other remember if it's a
[1:17:33] true bride and Christ that's who it is
[1:17:37] husband and wife okay now listen God
[1:17:44] blessed them Adam and a meet not Adam
[1:17:53] and a mate right are you following me
[1:17:58] not Adam in a mate Adam and a meet which
[1:18:02] would be part of him she was part of him
[1:18:06] in theophany she was part of him in
[1:18:08] physical creation they get in a little
[1:18:18] marriage the divorce went terrible
[1:18:21] building am I getting empty too but
[1:18:23] that's alright but you know what before
[1:18:30] they was put into human flesh 1:26 man
[1:18:36] show you how perfect it ties to Christ
[1:18:39] in His Church they were told to multiply
[1:18:44] and replenish the earth why would God do
[1:18:49] that before the fall
[1:18:59] did he do that because it he was going
[1:19:05] to make them fall are you with me he
[1:19:13] told him when there's an theophany till
[1:19:16] now remember the Prophet talked of it a
[1:19:18] pre-service year while back on it own
[1:19:20] spiritual multiplication you realize
[1:19:23] that's what I'm doing I'm preaching the
[1:19:24] gospel and you are taking the word and
[1:19:27] that spiritual multiplication become
[1:19:29] children of God that's why you sisters
[1:19:30] got your own poop come on come on we put
[1:19:33] it in the right place right the woman's
[1:19:34] got their place why I go out and teach
[1:19:37] them kids and grandkids and great
[1:19:39] grandkids and and all I can teach the
[1:19:41] women teach the women
[1:19:43] why because you were told when you were
[1:19:46] that back there to multiply and
[1:19:48] replenish and as you preach the gospel
[1:19:54] to people at spiritual multiplication
[1:19:57] now listen folks let me put a coin this
[1:19:59] plug right here that's why you see so
[1:20:02] many preachers committing adultery
[1:20:06] because that thing is so close
[1:20:08] I warn you ministers that thing it's so
[1:20:15] close it will take you to the bed of
[1:20:18] adultery and you will think that you are
[1:20:21] right and you'll try to justify it I
[1:20:27] told you about the old man at the dream
[1:20:29] he had a seed to plant he did in a young
[1:20:31] girl he was 17 she is like 18 somewhere
[1:20:38] 67 at least until I told him I said
[1:20:42] brother I said didn't you understand he
[1:20:44] said but I had a dream I did I said
[1:20:46] don't you understand a preacher plants a
[1:20:49] seed by the words he preaches to the
[1:20:52] congregation he was told to preach the
[1:20:55] gospel not to get a very pregnant of
[1:21:00] course he didn't it did bother you know
[1:21:01] you know you don't got to do you follow
[1:21:08] me
[1:21:12] listen let me finish it up in this part
[1:21:17] we just closed out that part of it and
[1:21:19] let it go right around him on the
[1:21:23] message called souls in prison he said
[1:21:27] he's talking about the man is spirit
[1:21:29] being and then there was no man to till
[1:21:32] the soil and God formed man out of the
[1:21:35] dust of the earth then he taken from his
[1:21:38] side a byproduct he did not make a
[1:21:45] byproduct of lesser value he said he
[1:21:50] took from his side a by-product a reel
[1:21:55] which is part of her and from that
[1:21:58] separated the man which had a dual
[1:22:01] nature which was both feminine and
[1:22:04] masculine and he took the feminists out
[1:22:07] cause it was love and he placed it into
[1:22:11] a person called Eve and Adam called EE
[1:22:16] because he knew the story it was put on
[1:22:18] down
[1:22:19] now listen what's the difference in a
[1:22:24] man and a woman well that's me original
[1:22:30] creation she ain't no original creator
[1:22:32] she's my product she was in Adam and
[1:22:35] brother branham right there from souls
[1:22:38] and prisoners said she was a byproduct
[1:22:39] in Adam a rib so that doesn't mean he
[1:22:43] made something different or something
[1:22:45] wrong how could God make a woman wrong
[1:22:49] and in judge her for being wrong oh you
[1:22:54] can pick up all the little things
[1:22:55] running through brother runs medicine
[1:22:57] you just run your ideas through anymore
[1:22:59] you can just have a great thing in your
[1:23:00] mind how the woman sees this and how the
[1:23:02] woman she's there
[1:23:03] and how this and that or the other but
[1:23:07] you're gonna come back to one thing
[1:23:17] what did God take out of Adam he said
[1:23:20] real What did he say he took out of Adam
[1:23:26] the feminist park right he left out on
[1:23:33] the masculine park right so he took the
[1:23:38] theme in this part out and he put that
[1:23:41] theme in his park into that woman that
[1:23:44] was standing on earth now what is are
[1:23:51] you talking about brother Dale will
[1:23:52] diminish
[1:23:58] I've got him laying on a - I just
[1:24:01] decided to forget it you ain't gonna
[1:24:03] listen to it you want anyway a woman has
[1:24:09] a nature that is the feminist Park why
[1:24:19] would your prophet take it and then show
[1:24:21] you over and over you know what York and
[1:24:24] he said that little girl
[1:24:27] he said that little girl said she gets
[1:24:30] big enough to walk and play you look at

[1:24:59] the rest of most people I know that I
[1:25:01] don't believe in homosexuality's and
[1:25:04] things like that as being some kind of a
[1:25:06] germ you got I believe it's a hereditary
[1:25:09] trait passed down by somebody you can
[1:25:12] take that all you want to would you take
[1:25:15] that little boy and you make him play
[1:25:18] with dolls
[1:25:19] you're changing his nature you take that
[1:25:22] little girl and make her play with cars
[1:25:25] and toys out in the yard you're changing
[1:25:27] that child's nature
[1:25:30] that's the way things get started you

[1:25:38] play what I don't mean go over click
[1:25:40] that goddamn boy brother Dan steady
[1:25:42] ain't posted that never put the dog down
[1:25:45] or there now you gonna be you're making
[1:25:49] me say something I'm playing but there's
[1:25:55] a nature to that little girl to be a
[1:25:58] mother nature the little boy to be a
[1:26:07] daddy now you tell me the difference in
[1:26:11] it anything you tell me I'm gonna say
[1:26:17] that's the nature to be a woman you know
[1:26:21] coming here or you tell ya once that's
[1:26:23] the nature to be man so let's just solve
[1:26:24] that problem huh let's get it straight
[1:26:29] Satan knew that there was no need of
[1:26:33] trying to contact Adam because he
[1:26:36] couldn't get to him not now listen not
[1:26:40] that Adam was so 45 behind the words you
[1:26:42] could not get to it cause he finally did
[1:26:45] forget it
[1:26:47] I don't argue with ya he finally got to
[1:26:50] him called Adam done the wrong but see
[1:26:57] he knew that mother nature in that
[1:27:00] little girl called Eve come on explain
[1:27:06] it some other way to me I've been I'm
[1:27:09] too old I'm too far down the road
[1:27:12] I'm tired of byproducts and the way
[1:27:16] preachers do their churches and the
[1:27:18] things like I told the preacher one time
[1:27:22] years ago he say priests spiritual
[1:27:24] husband somebody was gonna remember it
[1:27:26] tells us dark and they preached
[1:27:28] spiritual husband so strong
[1:27:30] until what they had was that the women
[1:27:32] couldn't go or the church couldn't go
[1:27:34] listen nobody else preach there's
[1:27:36] personal husband they were their husband
[1:27:38] I said that might be alright but I don't
[1:27:41] want my husband running around on me so
[1:27:44] you
[1:27:44] quit going listen you preachers quit
[1:27:48] going out there preaching in their
[1:27:50] mother women they didn't like me and
[1:27:54] they still don't like me and you know
[1:27:57] what I love them
[1:28:04] what was it that was put in Eve now come
[1:28:09] on I know you can go through and you're
[1:28:10] gonna go home you're gonna pick it up
[1:28:11] and you're gonna put in a tape your dart
[1:28:13] is you don't say beauty right you're
[1:28:19] gonna say beauty's to Satan took the
[1:28:22] beauty God made her pretty Satan didn't
[1:28:24] make a beautiful Satan took her beauty
[1:28:28] that God had already given her you want
[1:28:32] me to give you a quote we're brother
[1:28:33] Branham says that even the blushing part
[1:28:36] of Eve was controlled by the eternal
[1:28:39] life that was put down I just read down
[1:28:47] because beauty is is we call it skin
[1:28:50] deep right you know ugliness goes all
[1:28:55] the way to the bone right you can be
[1:28:59] beautiful it's all beauty and this mean
[1:29:02] is a rattlesnake
[1:29:04] what's it what did God build and Eve he
[1:29:11] made a woman he made a woman that would
[1:29:19] desire come on brothers that would
[1:29:22] desire to be a mother come on the only
[1:29:33] desire you better put in Eve is not a
[1:29:35] lustful this that or the other
[1:29:42] a desire to be a mother
[1:29:52] Satan knew that was his only in road to
[1:29:55] the human race
[1:29:56] was to touch her in the basis of her
[1:29:59] being the desire to be a mother now come
[1:30:05] on we'll get to what happened next all
[1:30:07] right the Lord willing wins me will
[1:30:09] cover the fall okay see you're making
[1:30:16] the woman of some kind of a horrible
[1:30:18] situation you're making something that
[1:30:20] God made to do he made her with a desire
[1:30:22] to be a mother now come on
[1:30:28] see I'm not through the message because
[1:30:31] remember in theophany they were told to
[1:30:34] what they were told to multiply and
[1:30:38] replenish the earth so Eve already knew
[1:30:40] the story she just didn't know how to
[1:30:43] play it out she knew that something was
[1:30:47] to happen because she was a part of Adam
[1:30:52] and that they were to multiply that
[1:31:03] desire and that mother to be a mother
[1:31:08] and there was nothing more beautiful the
[1:31:15] old man you get it he'd gone deer
[1:31:18] hunting he's gone golfing he's gone
[1:31:20] goofing and whatever you do you know the
[1:31:25] story you know what the woman who used
[1:31:28] it as a right side the brain a man uses
[1:31:29] the left side so she's in the right mind
[1:31:31] okay Oh got a cloud from the wife
[1:31:40] okay is that true
[1:31:48] but I didn't write the rest of the story
[1:31:50] I hope she clocks behind it I didn't
[1:31:52] write it that a woman's a thousand times
[1:31:54] easier to be deceived but now listen
[1:31:58] let's make that straight while we're at
[1:32:00] it that's not talking about your
[1:32:03] mentality of your brain they are women
[1:32:10] that are superior intelligent
[1:32:14] photographic memories and intelligence
[1:32:16] beyond the mankind but all you got to do
[1:32:23] is brag on her a little bit and she just
[1:32:24] smells come on I'm old but I'm still

[1:32:46] in and you a little bit hey well she
[1:32:47] said go get your own she's a thousand
[1:32:54] times more easy to be deceived about
[1:32:56] being a woman not about the world in the
[1:33:01] situation there are smart women come on
[1:33:03] Oh who was the lady it used to because I
[1:33:06] remember they questioned me about that

[1:33:10] head of Israel go to me a woman the head
[1:33:16] of Israel the nation that was not
[1:33:18] supposed to have a woman anywhere but
[1:33:22] she was the head of Israel this world
[1:33:26] would be in bad shape it wouldn't for
[1:33:27] the smart women that's in it but you
[1:33:32] know what it takes to being smart

[1:34:16] what I'm trying to describe as a nature
[1:34:18] a woman has a motherly nature about her
[1:34:22] Satan went right straight to that point
[1:34:25] and when he did he got in to get one
[1:34:28] race through the beast by telling her
[1:34:33] they don't tell you what's that she can
