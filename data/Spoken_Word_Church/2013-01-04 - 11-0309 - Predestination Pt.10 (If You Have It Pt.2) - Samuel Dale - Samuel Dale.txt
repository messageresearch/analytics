welcome now if you come two times don't expect a welcome cuz you're just part of us cuz we don't have anything here to join we don't have anything to no membership like that we're just part of the body of Christ pretty good to see Bill there with us we went down few years ago brother the Donnie and I did went fishing with him of course we went to wave riding mainly cuz we couldn't get out far enough to fish but we got a boat long as this building and that thing had just raised up in the hour and sit back down so you know I was glad he said I think we better turn around and go back you know and so we we was all right but good to see him glad to have him with us amen I talked to sister Peggy just a moment ago and she said that what she'd been telling everybody that you know Brother Dean was going they're in the morning they they run some more MRIs of different kind on his eye and they're going to do that up the VIN thing tomorrow you know and but they don't know what time of the day or whatever it's going to be so just you know be much in prayer that that everything would be all right amen and we have one more visiting preacher that will be with us I knew about it the other day but I was waiting for confirmation brother there will be a brother with us on March 27th for the morning service that'll be on a Sunday March 27th uh his name is is matumba is that the way you say it matumba Shadrach matumba Shadrach I guess that's close enough anyway he knows his name but you know but he'll be with us Lord with he's here a couple years ago you know and P is coming back to visit with us for a little bit he's from Kenya so just be much in prayer for that amen you like turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading from Ephesians the first chapter and then we'll read from Matthew 19 verse 16 so let's pray before we read the scripture father we thank you we love you and we desire one thing in us to be able to honor you with our presence and our lives and our doings most of all to honor you with you just letting us yield ourselves to you and let your lips the lips of natural man be your lips to speak your word because we truly believe that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord so we ask you to just come and use us tonight to speak the things that you'd have to be said and forgive us when we don't do that have your way be with Brother Dean there in the hospital Lord and bless him be with brother Tom we're glad that everything was working different for him and that you're changing him around a little bit Lord and we just pray you'd bless so remember all of these brother dawn brother George and them Lord that are on up in age and then sister Thomas we ask you to just be with her and deliver her and help her with that old blood pressure problem Lord we love you and we thank you we commit everything to you now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins most of all because we want to stand complete in you and just have your way tonight in Jesus name amen amen we're in Ephesians 1 verse3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ and notice it's in Christ it's not in me in you that's right there's not too much Heavenly in us it's all in him amen according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted into beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in him himself now there's a mystery there see and it's Redemption and he's purposed everything inin himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsil of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ now if you go to Matthew 19 we'll just read one verse verse 16 this is the Rich Young Ruler you know in the story and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the re of the word now we've been trying to get down to a place to get an understanding we've been talking on predestination now for a few weeks you know and that's it's not like mankind I hope that that's at least uh been enough to dwell within your mind to be able to see the scriptures unfold because predestination has been a a kind of a sore thumb as you would call it in the religious realm because of the way people believe you know and it's because of what they've been taught you know I mean we've been taught all of our life this is our right hand well how do you know you know see this may be it see I may be looking backwards see we you know we we we we measure a horse so many hands whose hands I mean you get a hold of somebody with big hands you know it measures out difference you know but it's it's I know what it is it's a it's a measurement it's a comparison and things but the point I'm getting at is we we believe what we basically have been taught all of our life on something and we don't really uh get down into considering in the scriptures and things what God is really maybe saying on a subject and you know and so we come up with with an idea like what mama said what daddy said or uncle or a and that's all right for the time because as we were trying to bring there Sunday you know the Bible says there in the book of Acts that it at one time God win at our ignorance that's right right you know CU we we didn't have no way of knowing right but we're supposed to be in the end time and supposed to be believing that God sent us a prophet down in the end time to be able to expound unto us the truth of the word of God and it's like I was telling somebody the other day about it they were working on a wiring system here and I told him I said uh you know Paul said follow me as I follow Christ right I said I follow you know people say well y'all follow a man I said well you're a Baptist I said John Smith started your church you know and uh I just give him a quick run to I said because you know I was there and knew what not there when it started but there in it I knew the doctrine of things and see we just accept a lot of times what people say right instead of studying the Bible for ourselves right you know people are say well the Bible said you know in the end time you can't tell the difference in the in the seasons except the budding of the trees and the shedding of the leaves well that is the difference I mean that is what it is but you go to some places and they don't shed their leaves but see that's not in the scripture right because it said they would be seed time and harvest yep until the end of all things you know would to be brought well see then we take one that you know said every tub was set on its own bottom I never did understand what they meant about that but they claimed it was in the Bible Well I I've I've studied it with the computer and all of the things and running words and I've never found that you know it was what somebody said right you know and people will tell you well the Bible says it I read well you know I'm not going to argue with you about it I'm just going to say come and show me right because I want to stay with what the word says and then I don't have to worry about the rest everything else will be taken care of if I just stay with what the word has to say about it and you know as I was saying there last this past Sunday you know that mankind has always anytime in the Bible that you see him the Rich Young Ruler came uh Nicodemus came uh you know wanting to talk to to Jesus about you know what to do right you know and uh it was always in there you know what must we do like the the Jailer there that with Paul and I believe it was Silas wasn't it in the book of Acts that were in jail and the Lord delivered them right and and and you know and that day if if you know if you lost a prisoner you you brothers that was in the military you know if you lost a prisoner that you were holding you you you took his place you know it was just a way they said it you know and so he was ready to kill his but when they said well hey wait a minute we're not gone we're still here well then he changed his mind he didn't give a ho what the government said about going to kill him he he said you know what can I do to be saved right well it's always been within mankind to desire the old Indian hunt with a Happy Hunting Ground you know this religion even all religions have a uh life after death whether it be Muslim Buddha Hindu whatever it be you know whatever you come in you you have that and you have a belief in God it may not be the true God but you'll have a belief in a totem pole or or some form or P you know something look like an animal or you know all kind of things and and that was really what Abraham was doing you know Abraham was making Idols to sell them right cuz them people back there they they just wanted to you know they wanted some kind of an idol would he just make them what he wanted because his his daddy was in on it you or daddy-in-law there he was in on making them and all but one day see that God come and touched Abraham well he wasn't in the idol naked no more that kind of ended that once he had an experience with the lord well that's what I've been trying to get us to see we can talk about predestination we've been through it that God's forn knowledge if we don't believe that God fornew everything that would ever be in the world then what kind of a god do you got I mean I just go trade it off and get me a Buddha Hindu Muslim whatever I'm honest you know I mean I I wouldn't I I wouldn't if I'm not going to believe that God can keep his word correct and and run things rightly then I'm not going to believe in him that way I'm going to be I'm going to eat drink and be merry because I'm going to claim I'm going to the Happy Hunting Ground you know and like all this and the Muslims and things you know they they give him SE give a guy 70 virgins to go die in war you know they never did say what to give to women but you know I mean it just you know everybody's got some kind of an idea right everybody's got some concept about what it is and how you get it but see that's what what God was looking down through time to look at and see us and he judges us according to what we have heard of the truth right he doesn't judge us of what we've not heard no come on see you're not responsible for something you've not heard but you are responsible for what you have heard and that's why Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free all right so then that's that puts the loadbearing back onto whether the word is true or not right a l then we look at as we said predestination and people say well if it's predetermined that I be lost will I just be lost I guess well if that's what you think about it what can God do you know if that's what you consider in yourself what can God do that's right how can he change anything that you've got your mind made up that's right all right but then people even believe you know that that we come into the world with eternal life well that's not a new doctrine this to the some of the people in the message that's been down through time of organized religion right and things that's come up with a lot of those things uh Baptist had it pretty close to that because they believed in eternal security you know once saved always saved and it didn't matter what you done you're still saved well I didn't believe that when I was the Baptist now I didn't cherish that idea back there right and I certainly don't today but I believe see that you must be born again amen when Nicodemus come to Jesus he didn't you know Jesus didn't say well now what you need to do now Nicodemus is just is just go confess what you believe no he was he was confessing he put his life on the line as I told you the other day his job was on the line what if they' have found him there he would have been man that would have been rough if those others had found him you know there but see once he faced the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus gave him the key he said you must be born again right right well then Nicodemus come up with the idea and he said you mean I got to go back into my mother's womb and come out again and Jesus said now if I tell you of of Heaven Earthly things how can you understand Heaven if you can understand what it is here see and and he said you must be born again amen all right see you must be born from above the original translation says amen all right in other words you got to have a new birth right all right if we don't get nothing across tonight except one thing you get this point I believe that you must receive eternal life to have it that's right all right I believe in the representation of predestination yes that God fornew because like I said a moment ago if he doesn't know then what kind of a God is it that's right you know we don't we don't need to be serving him if he's not good enough to know or great enough to know but see you must be born again it's not something that you just say well you know I I'll do this or I'll do that and it certainly not built on Works Jesus didn't tell Nicodemus you know you go do this you go do that you do this and you do that he said I done that like the Rich Young Ruler said I've kept these all of my life right and Jesus loved him the scripture said you know why cuz he knew he' done it right he could look down in his life and he'd seen it he lived a good life right and see then it's always been what can I do now on the day of Pentecost when it come up there to Peter preaching the message he didn't say go do this and go do that or go do this or believe this or do that what did he say he gave the the uh uh uh you know the prescription to become Eternal right what repent everyone be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he told me exactly what to do all right see it's not what you can do or don't do that's fine Brother Dale you don't believe in living good no I told you that I don't believe in living good I believe in getting born again and letting God live out of it then if I don't live a life you know right of Christ then I'm not a Christian right that's no problem is it that's right if I don't live a life then I'm not a Christian that's you know as the old saying is you see a fox you see a hole and you see a fox tail sticking out it's a pretty good sound you got a fox in the den you know if his tail sticking out well if I go out and live like the devil all week long that was what they were amazed at was when I worked at J Motors are with about six or seven of you and and they said well you know you know you know you work with your church here a lot of them you remember what I told him I said well ask them am I any different ask them am I I any different when I'm at work than I am at church amen I've been hunting and fishing with a lot of you am I any different when I'm at doing those things and I am at church no because that's what I want to be right I don't have to do the things I do I do it because of the love of God in my heart cuz he saved me amen he gave me his own life right all right now giving me his own life then there if we believe in God you know that's a question back to you cuz you know the question I've been asking you is if you have it and see that means when you when you say if that's a question you know and I'm not questioning whether the Bible's right or not I'm laying it down into you and to me as to question our own selves right you know right the Bible says exact yourself to see whether you're in the faith or not well check it out you see what those in the Bible the way they live and then that's the way we ought to live you know right would you see Jesus out here doing what people claim in the religious world that they're Christians but yet you know going to all kind of things and events and situations and doing things wrong would would Jesus do that right no no no he wouldn't do that so then we must get down to the basis of finding out that we have to receive eternal life to have it right we say will we come to the world with eternal life where was it was it in your body was it in your spirit was it in your soul where was it at now that's what we want to get on because Eternal as I've been trying to express to you Eternal is a word it comes from the word Zoe which means God's own life right now you've got all kind of eons and aons and things like that that look real real close to Eternal but just remember my definition of Eternity or Eternal eternity is eternal means it goes just as far that away and can never end if it ever ends it's not Eternal true but it also means did it come from just that much backward somewhere well then it didn't ever begin God didn't begin he had no beginning and no ending see in doing that then if we receive his life all right if his life will come into us by the new birth then that life that we have has no beginning and no ending right right amen it's eternal life amen that's right see and see this is to Know Thee the scripture says eternal life see all right then if if we have eternal life there's no beginning right now there was a time you and I had a beginning right right the father you can go back in to to doing is the thinking of God in his mind right all right but just remember when you go back to what you're thinking in God's mind you've went out of existence of this life right right so you're not dealing with us as human beings right in relationship to that right see now so then if we have eternal life there was a day you didn't have it but then a day you received it now it don't matter what you done bill was telling me while ago that he bought him a bigger boat after I was there and he probably got a smaller one now we still want to get down there but I want to ride them ways I want it a little more calmer you know but anyhow you know there was a day he didn't have that boat right right it didn't matter if he made the down payment on it it didn't matter if he was you know said that's my boat but he had to go get the boat and by getting the boat then he had the boat that that you know I solved it well see that's a carnal comparison but it's the same way of talking if eternal life the psalmist David said in two or three ssongs I put them together that we were born in sin shapen in iniquity and a spouse from our mother is wound a liar Paul said we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh amen well if you put eternal life back there as a person of eternal life then you've got an eternal sinner right amen and see that won't work that's we don't believe in eternal hell right right we believe in Hell burning forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever you know I was listening to him today uh on the news and well it was a guy talking and and he said that if you took I forgot what it was it would take you I forgot how many years 250 years if you spend $1,000 a day it would take you I forgot how many hundreds of years to be able to spend a billion dollars you know i' like to try it you know I could probably get ahead of them a little bit but you know how it is that's right but you know the point was in school we were told how big a room it would be to hold1 million $1 bills if you stack them up it' take a big room to hold that see well all right now see people are thinking about being Millionaires and they can make it y all right people are making billionaires but look at our national debt right what is it is it 10,000 billion to makes a trilon is that the that the calculations or something like that I mean it's just an unknown number there's no no way to even fathom it but that's how much we owe who do we owe it to ourselves I'll R mine off won't you no problem but see that's not who we owe it to we owe it somewh else but the point I'm getting at is there's a time that you didn't have eternal life I don't care what you think or what you can quote and read and study and do whatever there was a time you didn't have eternal life right right now the main reason I believe that this is this is you may think it's dropping back some but it is but the main reason that I believe that we didn't come here with eternal life is because that we don't believe in an eternal hell you'd have to have God's life to be able to live there that's right so that would put God into hell that would be one thing but we don't believe in Eternal son ship right all right now organized religion teaches father son Holy Ghost Blessed Trinity you know co-equal and coeternal that's the badst phrase of it right now how can a son be as old as a father it can't be right we don't believe in Eternal sunship right cuz a son signifies that someone who had a beginning all right now what are you are you a Son of God come on are you listening right are you a Son of God right you may be careful how you say that right because you're admitting that you had a beginning right if you say you're a son right or daughter now come on make it women or men come on you see then that meant there was a time something began but what we can't comprehend is that they can take the DNA now from a person and run that genealogy way back as a matter of fact if they probably desired to they could run everything back to the flood you know right and then you'd have hamam and japeth and their descendants you know and no and his and Noah didn't have any children on the other side of the flood so everything would be coming from hamam and Jacob right and then if you could go on back you could trace it all the way back to find out of whether it was Adam or the Beast would be your father right because that's the DNA we talk about all the apples that will ever be on an apple tree where were they at right where did they come from they had to be in the seed right that was planted y see all right apple seed you put it in the ground now you can't look at all that and see all them apples right there's no way cuz it could be bushels or bushels or bushels of apples finally come off but their originality was right there in that one seed and see that's what people can't see about trying to comprehend God right you were in your father you were in your grandfather cuz that's where the DNA can prove it you were in your great-grandfather great great great great just keep going going well on back see but yet you wasn't there as a little germ you know floating around you were only there in the invisible of of life to where that there's no way that science can find the gene of life amen you know they can take a a blade of Grace and they can examine it take a grain of corn they can examine it but they can't find the life that's right but you can take that grain of corn and you can totally grind it up you know that's what I was telling you the other day about it but you know a lot of people overseas will hear this they wouldn't understand but you know maybe they understand about the chickens but see we feed them a lot of grain here well you know in that grain you you put that chicken litter back on your garden you're going to get a lot of weeds that you didn't plant or thought you didn't plant but they was in that chicken when it went in the ground and it'll eventually come up why because it's totally that is an invisible thing right see then if you're going to say I was a gene in God and now I'm a Son of God you better consider what you're saying all right cuz if you're a Son of God right it means somewhere you had a beginning right right all right and you got to be made Eternal all right right so then the point is what are we trying to prove by saying that we always was eternal we're by passing Jesus Christ dying on Calvary for us right that's right and that's one thing that I'm highly against is is preaching like that cuz I want the people to see that must be born again I went to a church one time and preached on justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it was it was a brother that come to Pentecost That was supposed to you know believe all that and he got highly upset at me because he said I preached wrong I said what he said you got my people seeking God I said well Hallelujah I'm sorry that I preached something that you didn't agree with right all right but I said I will not apologize for what I said and if they're seeking God that's exactly what I wanted them to do I'd like for you to do it words because see we get into the idea that we're so great or something you know a lot of people thinks God can't do without them yeah oh my you ever run into people like that they think the world can't operate without them oh my we used to have there G Motors they thought man if they just run that whole plant and if they was out well you know what a lot of times when those people retired they didn't even replace them right right when Tom retired it play they took three people when brother Tom Fus retired it took three people to do his job and yet he spent 6 hours a day with me talking about the work oh my you said well how in the world he do it cuz he worked like crazy the other two and he knew how to get everything done so he go get it all done and they would all tickle it took three people to replace them but had a lot of people when they retired they didn't even replace them I didn't go back to find out whether it did to me or not I wasn't concerned about it I just wanted my retirement and you know but now listen then if we think about it as trying to deal with it as Eternal sunship what have we done there's no such thing as Eternal sunship right that's the organizational theories I said the Baptist said you know God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost co-equal co-eternal In other words all three of them is eternal but then they'll turn around and tell you you can't explain that you can't and I agreed with him because you know I couldn't understand it then but now I understand a little better about it right how can you have an eternal son right now you can have a son of God that's right that has eternal life right and if you receive eternal life then that life you receive always was eternal right all right right now so then see it's not Eternal sunship right it's Eternal godship Jesus wasn't an eternal son of God right he was God manifested In the Flesh in a form called a son right he would stand on Earth and say if you seen me you've seen the father right he didn't have no problem saying that amen we're not West but we believe in one true and living God right that's right see he had to come that way to be able to display and die for you and I right Amen to wor it we could receive eternal life amen he had to give his life to release it right it was bottled up in him see am see because the Holy Ghost has not been given because Jesus has not been glorified the scripture says see then we need to get down to think about it are we Eternal Sons how can we be now if he wasn't an eternal son we can't be an eternal son so when we receive eternal life that had no beginning and had no ending right no time it ever started right you remember that in in Hebrews about melic no beginning of days about melic there in about uh Hebrews 7 said he had no beginning of days no ending of life no descent so it was almighty God see Jesus then had to be almighty God or you would be making him an eternal son and see in in no way do I believe that but I believe he stepped over in a form to come down to reveal himself and could be called a son the Bible said in him right right dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily right all right Father Son and Holy Ghost grow in that body right amen and see in doing that then he was not an eternal son he had eternal life right so then he was God's own life dwelling in flesh Emmanuel as we read it God With Us right now when we receive that same eternal life do you think that makes you a son come on or does it make you God in human flesh come on that's what Paul on Mars Hills was talking to him about right he said to the unknown God y right the ones you wrote up you know there a sign there just in case they goofed up and didn't get all of them they left a little sign said to the unknown God he said that's one I'd like to talk to you about that's right he said even your poets has a agreed that we are God's Offspring right now that's why those Pharisees was upset with Jesus right they were upset with Jesus as he would call himself a son even though it would be son of man they didn't like that because they believed that they were The Offspring of God right but there was no way it could be made manifest back there until Jesus Christ come and died that's right see he had to release the life you understand amen and you say well I always was eternal yeah I was in him on that's right yeah if I have eternal life tonight right if you have eternal life the eternal life you have is got to be the life of God right amen right and that way you got no beginning or no ending right amen well brother Dale that's just a little too much to try to say that we're god well well tell me why Jesus told him said your Gods to whom the word come to that's right he was R for I know the prophets and things yes but still see we are his offspring amen but we must be born again amen amen we must receive eternal life if not what did Jesus die for I keep repeating that why didn't he go to Nicodemus and say Nicodemus followed the rule book Nicodemus would have looked at him and said hey Glory I've had it all the time but I've always followed the rule book right if you can show me I'm wrong anywhere let them kill me and they wouldn't but you see we want to take a quote and isolate that quote h and make a point out of it or scripture and make a point out of it instead of accepting the way God sent it you know that that message of redemption was so important he couldn't trust it with a prophet right right he didn't right he came himself right he didn't trust the message of redemption since together with anybody else he came himself right he come down to live with us amen you say you mean you believe that was God now the flesh no the flesh was a human body that's right brought into existence for God to live in but you better remember it was the body of God it comes in the blood of God come on it was created it never had no birth from a woman and a man come on right all the rest of us come from woman and man but he didn't he come by creation God created the egg and the germ or sperm or whatever to call it placed it in the wound of Mary let her carry it amen right but the Catholics and actually your Protestants believe that Mary gave the egg and God fertilized it well that make the body sinful that's right that's right and that won't work right you see what I'm talking about are we Sons and Daughters of God the new birth gives you the same life that God had amen or else we don't have the new right you see why everybody's wondered always has wondered what must we do to be saved you know what can I do what can can is there something I can do or or or any way you know right you see if you told everybody see that's what Catholicism does and I'm not that's their business I'm preaching here ain't nothing out there that's their business but what does Catholicism say give you money to the church you're automatically going into heaven oh my now you tell me they don't say that I'll tell you you you've got a messed up conception somewhere but what about the the denominations yep right well that brother's going to heaven cuz he paved the parking lot well oh my if he paved a little in glory he might have been better off cuz it's paid with gold but he didn't pave it but you see we try to make it on something that we can do right that's right is there anything that we can do to be saved does it mean I could stand on my head for you know for a week no would that do it you know could I do as Catholicism and crawl like Martin Luther crawl down on GL and pierced all over and nails and stuff like that and do penants would that save me right that's why he preached the message he saw that was wrong amen that's right his sincerity was great but he saw that that never brought salvation because it never brought him a clear conscience right but Salvation deals with the inward part of you working back outwardly then I Believe by receiving eternal life I can be called a Son of God in the natural you know people but really inside of me God is living right amen cuz I don't believe there a whole bunch of gods that's where we cannot comprehend it cuz like like I told you there's 7 billion people in the world today every person in the world could accept Jesus Christ and he would give him eternal life you know that wouldn't do away with any of his life no you have enough for Mars and Venus and any other planet you think there somebody out there you know I've always said if you think there's somebody out there they need salvation right right I mean if there somebody out there whether he look like a monkey or whatever he looks like he needed to be born again because that's what we all want to do but you see we must have the new birth to have eternal life now what is the new birth the prophet of God on Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said what is the new world you see that he said it's Christ revealed to you personally right right my children didn't get eternal life because of me I don't believe in that my wife doesn't get eternal life because of me my grandkids my great grandchild they don't get eternal life because of me they get it because of their own experience with God right all right and when they re seeed that eternal life then that eternal life had no beginning right so right there the very second of what you want to call it when that Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost they went up there as Sinners scared to death that's right they were in the upper room pulled apart and hiding but when the Holy Ghost came they went out hunting the people to talk to him and there everyone gave their life except John who went to patmas the only one that died of a natural death all the rest of them died Peter said don't hang me like that put me upside down on the cross I ain't worthy to be hung with my master that's right you mean people that would give their lives that's what it's told there in the fox's book of Martyrs you know of down through the Dark Ages when they were killing the Christians that actually the guards a lot of times would just throw down their weapons and just walk right into the lon's Dead with those Christians because they' seen a life that they wanted right and they would just give their life the eternal life is a gift right it's given unto you because of not how good we are it's given because of what we can believe right does the Bible say believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be safe wouldn't know what Peter and Paul and them told the Jailer he said even your own own household see what he brought his household in and let them listen to the gospel and they got saved too he had a part to do with that we have a part to do with our families receiving it sure because we try to raise them up in the right atmosphere right but we can't give them eternal life right right amen and according to what a lot of people call eternal life I actually don't want it no oh my I'm serious that's right I don't play games I'm serious what a lot of people call eternal life that ain't done nothing for no more than what's done for a lot of people I don't want what they got that's right and I certainly don't have what I need to have I'm kind of like the the the lady was that said you know I'm not what I used to be and I'm not what I ought to be but I'm not I'm not what I ought to be not what I want to be because I certainly ain't what I used to be am I have come from somewhere am see eternal life is a gift if mankind wants to be saved then it's up to God to provide a way to save that person that's right would you agree with that amen if somebody wants to be saved that's why it's offered to everybody it was offered to Judas he had three and A2 years of Ministry of casting out devils and Healing The Sick amen that's right but yet he turned it down right not because he he turned down the Lord Jesus Peter was worse than than Judas was that's right that's right amen Peter denied him in cursed doing it that's right we want to throw off on Judas a he was just the son of predition what made him the son of predition sure God's for knowledge knew what he'd do he knew exactly what he'd do right but you know he put up with it for three and A2 years right you know he talked with him daily for three and 1/2 years you know he tried every day to save the man come on right you say would God do that well he did that's right but you understand what I'm trying to get to if eternal life has no beginning right then it goes just as far that way you know pointing to the people on the internet is not seeing it just pointing just as far back that way as it is pointing over that way and I don't believe that it will ever run out to where God will not be revealing himself to you and I right how can you exhaust an eternal God come on an eternal word we're just getting a a part to be able to understand right amen this is just the trials and the test to get us to a place to be able to comprehend God right when we get over there down to the endless ages it just be him revealing himself right well then as far as you just go back that way and you can't go back you can't stop nowhere right if you stop you say oh it's just a circle well now see you just caught yourself you say it's just a circle right now the com the the the statement the prophet made about being a circle means it had no beginning and no end but if you say it's just a circle then you're saying there's somewhere that it begin he said no no no no well come on explain it to me if a circle will start here and go all the way around and come back to there it started somewhere right y right that's just a natural way of expressing eternal life as I told you even the universe is moving they've known that science has known that for for probably close to 100 years now that the whole universe is just moving it's not standing still because once it's slung off back there yeah it just never stops it just keeps on going and then we go flying out through space so many million light years out through space and we find planets out through there that are bigger than where we are ghost to sh there's a God Amen eternal life had no beginning has no ending to it so if you have eternal life that's the question that eternal life you have always was eternal right but there was a day you didn't have it as a possession right cuz we ought to have enough sense in our brain let alone the Revelation come on Amen I mean my Lord folks right you mean to tell me you think you always was eternal and then you live like the devil now get off of it that's right I can stand up here and say a lot of things about those things to you because I didn't go out and do what most of you done that don't make me no different that didn't save me no quicker it made me harder to be saved because see the reason it made me harder to be saved you people would tell me that you quit this and you quit that it proves you saved I said I never did do it to start with right I'm not a goody two shoes no but I can sure tell you that I didn't do what a lot of people's done but it took more grace for me that's right than it did for anybody Paul said I'm the chiefest of Sinners why because I had to get over the church and myself to be able to be saved right that's why it took me two years after coming into the message before I received eternal life where everybody else says that they come into the message prove that had eternal life I never said that I I sought God until I was satisfied with in my experience that I'd received some don't never stop searching for God I have never stopped I pray every day Lord Reveal Your word to me reveal yourself unto me Lord show me what I need I know how dirty I Am Lord you don't have to tell me that that's what everybody thinks about preaching is that think you supposed to tell everybody how dirty they are how you know you mean I've got to tell you how how dirty you are yeah I don't mean natural now but I've got to tell you what's in your life and then you get saved no you won't that's right never worked yet right brother brandham could stand there under that discernment and call out those people's lives and tell them what was going on and you know what he finally done he finally qu doing it right you know what he said he said CA it caused divorces y it caused murders now you go read and see if you didn't say it amen now at times he still called out things but not like he did in his early ministry right cuz see in his early Ministry like Jack Cole brother Tatum was talking about when Jack Cole looked down there and told that fell said you're running around that woman right over there boy there's a big old prayer line coming down to him to be prayed for they looked in a minute and they wouldn't harly nobody in the prayer line right why they didn't want him calling out what they've been doing right they so they didn't want to be saved right right right you know that most people don't want to be saved yeah they want a happy Hunting Ground amen they want some place to go to but they can be good and make it on their goodness but we can't make it on that you got to be born born again but the very Split Second that you're born again that eternal life that you have always was eternal right amen we get back to it Sunday going through the quotes of where the Prophet would say if you have eternal life you always was eternal right what's he saying if you had it you always put the question to us if we have eternal life right you know why because eternal life we receive always was eternal right amen it had no beginning had no ending it always was eternal but I hope you call what I said there while AG go there because we don't believe in Eternal sunship and Jesus wasn't an eternal Son of God but inside of that man that we call Jesus dwelt almighty God Body Spirit and soul of almighty God dwelt upon Earth among mankind right right y that's why he could say unless you believe that I am he said you will die in your sins that's right he said I and my father are one oh well that's like one you know that's like that's my son Wade there he he he he he doesn't resemble me he resemble his dad his my dad-in-law the cash side but you know we'd say oh he just looks exactly like his daddy and everything but that's not the kind it is with God you remember how the prophet explained it when that lady said oh brother brandom said when I see you said you know I see your wife he said there's something wrong with you said you can't see it that way right he said you see me said yes the word my wife well you know right he trapped her yep and I hope it traps you thinking about eternal life making you an eternal son cuz it made you an eternal son you've messed up the entire Bible that's right but if it made you God manifested in another form called the bride of Christ right see that's what eternal life is eternal life is God living in you amen now if man had thought of that all the way down to there he wouldn't have got off in organized religions he wouldn't have got off in those things if you just read the Bible read it for yourself go to Matthew Mark Luke and John when the Lord Jesus was here and look at all of the times he referred to himself as being God now watch what they said they said you make yourself equal with God right he wasn't equal with God he was God Nei that he's biggest deceiver it's ever been if it is we're in bad shape that's right but he brought forth eternal life right and if it's like most people thinks about eternal life as being a thought so you're an idea then why did Jesus have to die why didn't he just step right back into eternity right off the Earth he could have done that anytime he wanted to you know he said I get 12 Legions of angels come and get me off his cross well my Lord wormwood destroyed the world with water 12 Legions what is that 144,000 because the legions about a th000 of course there more than other calculations but what did he need if he gave his if he' come off that cross we wouldn't have eternal life that's right amen well the way people think about it is just a thought then they'll say well well I know what the prophet said that we come with this eternal Gene in us we keep searching we'll get to it Sunday keep searching until you find out what he said where that seed was put in you at I was born into the world eternal life now show me the quote show me the scripture he said the seed was put in you before the foundation of the world now that be back before any existence of life right right when your name was written in the L Book of Life what when the lamb was slain Revelation 138 right before the foundation of the world then your name was right there with him and he come to redeem all of those names right what is eternal life well it's just a thought no no it's not just a thought but is it one of them believes that the devil is the good one Church believes the devil is the bad part of your minds and God is the good part of your minds well you know I I kind of like for my mind to get better sometimes with you you know but think about it what is eternal life then you can see that if you received it right now now listen there will be a group of people at the white Throne judgment that are what we call foolish virgin that's Matthew 25 she got five wise and five foolish there'll be a people at the white Throne judgment to receive eternal life right you know what they go to the white Throne judgment without it right right that true right and then they receive it well you know what the eternal life they receive will not make them as the bride of Christ no but it'll make them Eternal right why because there's no way to have eternal life with having any beginning or ending to it it can't be it always was eternal so if he ever gives it to anyone anywhere that eternal life he gives that person at that second he gives it to them then they can say always was eternal when we know they went through the world and died gave their life and got to come up at the white Throne judgment to be judged that's right that's where I'm so glad we don't have to go there cuz see we receive eternal life here right if we receive eternal life here how can we go to the white thr judgment what is there to be judged by right well the things that I've done now that's the deed done in the body yeah there will be one like that but not for a decision of eternal life right that was what I never could understand the Baptist we talking about it they say I think I'm saved I hope I'm saved I believe I'm saved yeah you know if I died right now I believe I'm saved you know they never had a commitment to the basis of saying you know my soul is eternal one of these days up in heaven that's what it said we're going to know we've got eternal life see that may have been what your mother believed right that may have been what your daddy taught you or some preacher taught you right amen but I thought we're supposed to receive eternal life here right and then way we don't have to go to the white Throne judgment right do the prophet express it you mean you marry your wife you know you take your wife and then you put her to a trial to see where she's going to stand up or not no you don't love her if you do that if you love her you'll put up with her faults and failures right same thing for the woman to the man and the man to the woman you but what is eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's own life amen that's why he wasn't an eternal son he was God made manifest in the flesh called a son cuz that was a dispensation or a time that he was to dwell here and talk on those things and that body was not Eternal when he was walking on this Earth that human flesh out here but in the resurrection and Ascension and then coming back he could just walk right through the wall you've been down to Passion Play and you look at them they've done a real good job they kind of had the rocks and had it made to where that they would just move over like this you know and I thought it was a good idea cuz it did put the point but it moves like that he just steps out but that wasn't it that wasn't what he's talking about he appeared among them right but then he told him he said you go up to Pentecost lost and you wait that's right that's it they never had eternal life even because I brought out their Sunday that he opened the scripture said he opened their understanding of the scriptures about him but that never gave them eternal life they had to go to Pentecost you and I have got to have a Pentecost in our Liv amen right we've got to have the new birth right and that's a birth of the word the proph amen take on these things what do you think about eternal sunship I don't believe it because the word would be totally off you know Eternal sunship that wouldn't work now an eternal God manifested in the flesh is a different thing because that's eternal life right come on brother think on these things what is eternal life that you may know him the scripture say Amen that you may know him Hallelujah that's why the prophet said we don't have too many new births genuine new births he said because the people don't plant the word correctly how can you give a new birth about the word excuse me being planted take on these things let's Stand Together 288 red book anybody have a need the AL is open if you don't have eternal life don't stop seeking God right nothing El is else is important is whether or not you're born again that's right troubles and times are here heart with freedom we all hold th open your heart to God morning or night

don't worry about what anything else is but he said I've never seen the righteous forsaken receive don't worry about a thinking are you born again you can try to prop up everything I've got it because of this or that I've got it called the prophet said always was eternal yeah he said yeah you have etern life if you don't have eternal life then you not was not always eternal and if you was always Eternal I say again Jesus Christ didn't have to die that's a sensible that's not shouldn't be a big old brick hitting your the head to understand that but is Christ Living in you oh we got one more
