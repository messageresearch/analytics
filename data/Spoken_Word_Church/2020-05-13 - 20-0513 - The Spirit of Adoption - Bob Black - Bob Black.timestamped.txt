[4:16] amen that's your desire tonight let's go
[4:23] ahead and turn over to Romans chapter 8
[4:27] well God is good at the two of us they
[4:29] need to be able to come together and
[4:32] worship again try not to get too leaky
[4:38] up here I just speak to you tonight on a
[4:44] little something I've just been
[4:45] meditating on the last week or so and
[4:49] just kind of wanted to share some things
[4:51] with you but we're gonna look at Romans
[4:54] chapter 8 I know a lot of the ministers
[4:56] here oo Romans chapter 8 there's some
[4:59] things in that chapter so I just want to
[5:02] speak some things to encourage you and
[5:04] build your faith up a little bit but
[5:06] before we go into the scripture let's
[5:07] just go to the Lord in prayer little God
[5:10] we know Lord as we look out upon the
[5:12] things that are taking place in the
[5:14] earth and this is an hour of confusion
[5:16] Lord and and you said that there would
[5:17] be come upon the earth of famine in the
[5:20] land for the hearing of the word and all
[5:21] these different scriptures that we read
[5:23] about how people would be confused all
[5:24] the way from the beginning from the book
[5:26] of Genesis how they build a Tower of
[5:27] Babel the tower of confusion and that
[5:29] would go on through the Scriptures all
[5:31] the way to the end time where people
[5:32] would be so confused and not know which
[5:34] way to turn
[5:35] lord I pray tonight Lord it's you unlock
[5:38] the door about confusion Lord that we
[5:40] might be able to have have an idea of
[5:42] what we're doing here and Lord that you
[5:44] might be able to build up our faith Lord
[5:46] well we won't just be looking around
[5:48] with blinded eyes Lord but our eyes will
[5:50] be open to the promises of God and then
[5:52] what we're doing here and what's what's
[5:54] got to take place in our lives so that
[5:56] we can take an exit granted I pray Lord
[5:59] that tonight will not be just a vain
[6:00] gathering Lord but should you leave let
[6:02] us leave here tonight Lord with our
[6:04] faith built up Lord within us Lord Jesus
[6:07] knowing who we are and no one the day
[6:09] that we're living in Lord Jesus there
[6:11] will not be it will not be filled with
[6:14] doubt Lord in despair Lord of God but
[6:16] filled up knowing Lord that you're the
[6:18] same yesterday today and forever
[6:20] we asked Lord Jesus that you'll just
[6:22] feel welcome here tonight Lord that your
[6:24] spirit will come and quicken your word
[6:26] Lord to us lord help us Lord Jesus that
[6:29] you'll be with us tonight we pray in the
[6:30] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[6:34] all right Romans chapter 8 verse 15 and
[6:40] 18 I'm just going to speak really on you
[6:45] know the theme of adoption runs all the
[6:47] way through this chapter but I really
[6:49] just wanted to focus tonight on the the
[6:51] spirit of adoption and what that is and
[6:53] kind of motivates you a little bit and
[6:58] it says for you have not received the
[6:59] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[7:02] have received the spirit of adoption
[7:04] whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit
[7:08] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[7:09] that we are the children of God and if
[7:12] children then heirs heirs of God and
[7:14] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[7:16] suffer with him that we may be also
[7:18] klore glorified together for I reckon
[7:22] that the sufferings of this present time
[7:23] are not worthy to be compared with the
[7:26] glory which shall be revealed in us you
[7:30] may be seated
[7:31] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[7:33] of the world so you know that the
[7:41] denominational world I just kind of was
[7:42] looking at the different things in
[7:43] different churches today talk about
[7:45] adoption and everything and they've got
[7:46] they that you know they've got their
[7:48] ideas and things and the the thank God
[7:51] for a prophet because in this day in
[7:53] this hour we can understand the way that
[7:55] they're you know a lot of times when you
[7:57] look in Scripture it's very confusion I
[7:58] was talking to somebody the other day
[8:00] and they said you know the Bible is very
[8:02] it's not very difficult to understand at
[8:05] all and I disagree with that it is
[8:08] difficult to understand if you don't
[8:10] have the Holy Ghost you cannot
[8:11] understand the scripture you know that
[8:13] when you look it over to the book of
[8:14] Revelation and it talks about all these
[8:16] things the trumpets and the vials and
[8:17] all the seven seals seven church
[8:19] churches what
[8:21] I have to do with me what all these
[8:22] different things that in the book of
[8:24] Revelation and not to mention the things
[8:25] that Paul talked about at the Hebrews
[8:27] and things that even Peter said Paul
[8:29] says many things that are hard to be
[8:31] understood and and so you've got to look
[8:34] with a when when when when the Word of
[8:37] God when the Spirit of God begins to
[8:39] open up these difficult things you can
[8:42] look at it with a kind of a different I
[8:44] believe than the way that the domination
[8:46] of world has taught adoption the way
[8:48] they look at it is that we've been
[8:50] adopted from out in the world and and
[8:52] God kind of looks as a here let me still
[8:56] slow down here a minute yeah it's like a
[8:59] little child maybe you go out to Russia
[9:01] or somewhere and find you a child and
[9:04] you bring them in and and and bring them
[9:06] into your home and and you adopt them
[9:08] and you you put them into your family
[9:10] which is true that's what God does to us
[9:13] he brings us from out in the world and
[9:15] he places us into the into the family of
[9:17] God but you see that's not the end of
[9:19] the story and I think well that's maybe
[9:22] we're looking out into the the way the
[9:24] different churches and things today to
[9:25] teach that is that they they kind of
[9:27] stop right there and that is not the new
[9:30] birth coming into the family of God and
[9:32] all those things is not the end of the
[9:34] story that's there's much more to it
[9:36] than that
[9:36] and so if you look at in the book of
[9:39] Romans Romans actually takes Romans
[9:41] chapter eight takes you down through
[9:42] that process of adoption the three
[9:44] stages and it starts off with the spirit
[9:47] of adoption and so maybe let's just kind
[9:50] of set that set the stage here what what
[9:52] are we trying to get to and if we go
[9:54] back to the book of Genesis with Adam
[9:56] the Son of God was there in the Garden
[9:58] of Eden and the Bible doesn't tell many
[10:00] details about it it's talks about how
[10:02] God came in the cool of the evening and
[10:04] walked with him and all those things and
[10:05] it talks about how that that he was able
[10:08] to name all the different animals and
[10:10] according you know according to their
[10:11] attribute this was a sheep cause it
[10:12] bares wool this is a this is a crow
[10:14] because it the attributes of the thing
[10:17] all the different things of that animal
[10:18] he was able to speak and call it what it
[10:21] was and by the by the message of the
[10:23] Prophet we understand that Adam I had it
[10:26] was his flew from so open up that he he
[10:29] was a conduit that God could walk
[10:31] talk through he knew he knew his purpose
[10:34] there he knew what God wanted him to do
[10:35] and he could speak to the wind if it got
[10:37] if it got too rainy or whatever and just
[10:39] say I win moved back and he was God was
[10:44] so he was so yielded to God that God
[10:47] could just use him in whatever channel
[10:50] he wanted him to be you know that is
[10:52] what God Jesus Christ came to die to
[10:55] take us back to not just so that we
[10:57] could come to church and be in like a
[10:58] club or a large or something but so that
[11:01] God we could become vessels of a Living
[11:03] God that he could come and live in us
[11:05] and use us in whatever way he sees fit
[11:07] if he wants to use us like Joe did to
[11:10] make a little story with our suffering
[11:12] and all those things so that others can
[11:13] see as an example and that's the way
[11:15] that our lives will be used I want my
[11:18] life to be program said if whatever way
[11:21] he wants me to use me that's the way
[11:23] that I want to be used if God wants to
[11:26] use up using me for just like brother
[11:28] Brent said one time he might use raise
[11:32] up a minister just to preached one
[11:33] sermon and if that's all that God wants
[11:36] me to do then then let it be you see our
[11:39] purpose in life is to be used by God in
[11:42] whatever way he sees fit and if you can
[11:45] find the plan and purpose for your life
[11:47] and get into that position
[11:49] get it where God wants you to be then
[11:52] you're then you're getting somewhere but
[11:54] I'm sitting and who is God he said then
[11:56] we and fellowship what Adam lost in the
[11:59] fall Christ restored in his death do you
[12:01] believe that to bring man back into
[12:03] fellowship with God now the church has
[12:07] moved up to that fellowship with God
[12:08] communion like Adam had at the beginning
[12:11] in the Garden of Eden taken away to all
[12:13] sin away free from condemnation holy
[12:15] spirit cleansing us from all sin now
[12:18] you're free to exercise the next step in
[12:22] God see now now I wonder how many may be
[12:27] tonight sitting here realize that
[12:28] there's a next step do you know that
[12:31] that next step was kind of prophesied in
[12:33] the life of Jacob when he laid there on
[12:34] that he's laid his head on that rock in
[12:36] the Old Testament and and he looked up
[12:38] and he and he saw a ladder coming
[12:39] a lot of heaven and he saw angels coming
[12:42] down I sin descending and ascending
[12:46] going up and down on that ladder in his
[12:48] head was on that rug do you know that
[12:50] typifies something that typifies a
[12:51] journey that you've got to make a
[12:53] journey of character building a journey
[12:55] of God building you up so that he can he
[12:57] can trust you putting you into a place
[13:00] where you know what you're not talked
[13:02] about wondering what's true and what's
[13:04] not living in the state of confusion
[13:06] wondering what you know you talk to
[13:09] people today and it seems like it's like
[13:12] talking to a man that's in prison and
[13:14] you want to help them so bad I believe
[13:16] that's what that's where it really
[13:18] drives the ministers and the gospel that
[13:20] the ministers are there they're
[13:21] preaching the people that are in prison
[13:22] trying to get them out and the people
[13:24] that are in prison are many times can't
[13:26] don't realize that they're in prison if
[13:28] we if they could just realize that that
[13:31] the gospel holds the key and open up the
[13:34] door then they can be free you gotta
[13:37] take that next step the whole I remember
[13:40] I preached a sermon years ago about how
[13:42] everything starts with a step you gotta
[13:44] take that first step like Peter did out
[13:46] of the boat you got to take a step you
[13:47] got to take your first step toward
[13:49] justification and then another step
[13:50] towards sanctification take another step
[13:52] toward the baptism the Holy Ghost and
[13:54] then when you're adopted into the family
[13:56] of God there's more to it there's more
[13:59] to it but you see that being adopted
[14:03] into the family God I believe now this
[14:05] is maybe maybe my own personal
[14:07] conviction this is the most important
[14:08] step because how are the seals gonna be
[14:11] open to you if you're not born again how
[14:13] are you gonna go up the statutes perfect
[14:14] man if you're not born again how can you
[14:16] how can you understand any of these
[14:18] things if you're not born again you must
[14:19] be born again first of all and then
[14:21] everything else brother Graham said
[14:23] these vertices will be added
[14:24] automatically and I hope I'm not getting
[14:27] too deep or anything but but all
[14:30] everything will take care of itself will
[14:32] say that if you'll just get born again
[14:34] because if you get born again your
[14:35] appetite will change you will lose your
[14:37] appetite for the world and you'll start
[14:39] hungry for the things of God you'll
[14:41] begin to
[14:42] realize over time what the real what
[14:44] you're really coming to church for that
[14:45] you're not coming to church so much for
[14:47] the music and things but you're coming
[14:49] to church to feed your soul to feed it
[14:51] with the Word of God you're not coming
[14:53] to church just to feel an anointing on
[14:55] your flesh or on your spirit but you're
[14:57] coming to church to exchange that soul
[14:59] on the inside of you that they receive
[15:03] that little divine spark of God out on
[15:05] the inside you see you can see this
[15:07] journey all the way through the
[15:09] scripture remember David King David what
[15:11] God told David I took you from out of
[15:13] the sheep coat in other words I adopted
[15:15] you I took you out of the sheep coat and
[15:17] I made you a king he took him from the
[15:20] sheep coat and made him a king and along
[15:23] that journey that was three-stage do you
[15:25] know he was anointed three times he was
[15:27] anointed when Samuel anointed him he was
[15:29] anointed by the tribe of Judah and then
[15:30] again by the tribe of Israel so you can
[15:33] see that process that you and I have to
[15:35] take the same process that Jesus Christ
[15:37] himself took all the way through the
[15:40] scripture you can see that in the end
[15:42] the story of Abraham that brother Wade's
[15:44] been preaching on you can see it on this
[15:46] is the story of Ruth you can see it in
[15:48] all these types and shadows and I
[15:50] believe see that's why the new birth is
[15:52] so important because when you are born
[15:54] again you read the Bible with a new
[15:57] understanding you begin to look at all
[15:59] these stories and you recognize that God
[16:01] is doing something in your life the same
[16:03] way that he did in these believers and
[16:05] you're looking at the steps that they
[16:06] walk in you recognize you begin to
[16:08] identify yourself in the word because
[16:10] you see yourself in the word there
[16:13] you're walking that same journey you're
[16:15] going down that same trail you come into
[16:18] a place just like Abraham did where God
[16:20] says go up and sacrifice your son and
[16:22] trial and the test to see what your
[16:25] reaction will be and you've got to come
[16:27] to a place where God can have trust in
[16:29] you and confidence in you enough to give
[16:32] you the car keys enough to give you that
[16:34] same kind of responsibility that Adam
[16:36] had enough to give you the opening of
[16:38] the seven seals we said well how can i I
[16:41] don't understand the seven seals I don't
[16:43] understand these great mysteries and
[16:44] things what does God have confidence in
[16:47] you to know what to do with the word
[16:48] there's God
[16:50] have confidence in you now to look at
[16:52] you and see the reaction that you've had
[16:54] to the word so far does he look at you
[16:57] and see what you've done with the word
[16:58] have you have you actually received it
[17:00] and doesn't like the brands and go back
[17:02] and study the word to see whether the
[17:03] scriptures and things that you've been
[17:05] taught or true or have you said oh have
[17:07] you discarded it and said no I don't
[17:09] have time for that I've got time for my
[17:10] soap operas than the Hollywood and all
[17:12] that stuff but I don't have time to get
[17:13] into the world of God
[17:15] you see when you get into the word of
[17:17] God it will actually transform your mind
[17:19] it will change you it will emit will
[17:22] birth the Word of God into your life
[17:24] changing you from the inside out you've
[17:28] got to be born again brother Branham
[17:33] talked about when you go down to the
[17:34] water and you get baptized and we
[17:36] believe in scriptural baptism not in the
[17:39] names of titles within the name of the
[17:40] Lord Jesus Christ because the name of
[17:42] the Father in the name of the son and
[17:44] the name of the Holy Ghost here's the
[17:46] Lord Jesus Christ those are just titles
[17:48] if you will go to the bank and say well
[17:50] cash I need to catch this cheque and
[17:52] they said father on it that you would
[17:54] you wouldn't even catch that you would
[17:56] they would want to know what was the
[17:57] night what person is it and so that's
[17:59] why we're baptized in the name of the
[18:01] Lord Jesus Christ and brother Branham
[18:03] told us that when you're baptized in the
[18:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ when you
[18:06] come up then you are a candidate for the
[18:08] Holy Ghost
[18:09] you're a candidate and I want to I want
[18:11] to say tonight that you are a candidate
[18:12] you're a candidate to receive that first
[18:14] stage of adoption the new birth you're a
[18:17] candidate and all along that journey you
[18:19] are a candidate to receive that next
[18:21] stage you're a candidate because in Acts
[18:23] chapter chapter 2 verse 39 cents for the
[18:26] promises under you and to your children
[18:28] and to all that are afar off even as
[18:30] many as the Lord our God shall call it
[18:33] means that tonight if you don't have the
[18:35] new birth you were an a candidate to it
[18:37] if you'll just receive it and that's why
[18:39] I want a major tonight on the spirit of
[18:41] adoption because if you begin to think
[18:42] in your mind just maybe years ago as you
[18:45] thought well how can I receive the new
[18:47] birth it's too much for me maybe now
[18:49] you're born again but you begin to think
[18:51] in your mind how can I receive adoption
[18:53] it's too much for me how can i how can
[18:55] the seals be opened up to me it's too
[18:58] much for me but tonight if you
[18:59] can open up your heart and receive the
[19:02] word you are a candidate for adoption
[19:04] the adoption is ready for you now is
[19:07] throughout the hour of adoption now is
[19:09] the time of adoption
[19:10] it is abduction time it's time for the
[19:13] sons of God to be made manifest it's
[19:15] time for the sons of God to step on on
[19:17] the scene and reveal themselves because
[19:19] now is the time if God called you you
[19:25] were a candidate for adoption you know
[19:27] that first little stage of adoption and
[19:30] I'm talking about the new birth and it's
[19:32] a it's a special consecrated time you
[19:35] know you think of it almost like a and
[19:38] the natural little baby being born in
[19:40] the delivery room coming forth and
[19:42] there's not a lot of joking around in
[19:44] the delivery room there's not a lot of
[19:46] laughing and things because it's a
[19:48] somber time it's a time maybe I'm crying
[19:51] of mournful in every morning and all of
[19:53] those kind of things there's something
[19:55] something taking place brother I never
[19:57] taught us that that you can actually
[19:58] feel that presence of that little soul
[20:00] that life coming into that baby and the
[20:02] atmosphere of the room changed as life
[20:04] is coming into that child something is
[20:07] taking place and I believe that's what's
[20:09] taking place in a church that we don't
[20:11] come to church just to get the ground
[20:13] wet but we come to church to plant a
[20:15] seed we come to church there's a somber
[20:19] atmosphere something place where life is
[20:21] coming forth coming out of that ground
[20:23] like a little Lily out of the mud
[20:24] something is taking place and you know
[20:27] when you plant a seed that seed goes
[20:30] into the ground and it will it will
[20:32] produce something we don't come to
[20:37] church just to just to get our water and
[20:39] pot out and sprinkle the ground a little
[20:41] bit and rejoice because we have a
[20:43] blessing of spiritual blessing we're
[20:45] coming to church to birth sons and
[20:47] daughters of God we're coming to church
[20:49] to a to see the manifestation of adopted
[20:53] sons to see the eyes of people being
[20:56] opened up that's why that's why we don't
[20:58] laugh and joke around in church that's
[21:00] why the pulpit is no place for laughing
[21:02] and marketing things because there's a
[21:04] birth taking place there's a birth of
[21:06] the
[21:06] happening but they're the birth of
[21:08] adopted sons of God adopted sons and
[21:11] daughters something that's taking place
[21:13] and your eyes do you realize that is the
[21:16] evidence of the new birth to you is when
[21:18] your eyes come open then we believe at
[21:21] this church that that you go through
[21:23] three stages first you hear about the
[21:24] gospel and then God cleans you out and
[21:26] then he puts himself inside of you and
[21:29] when he puts it himself inside of you
[21:31] and when he gives you the new birth then
[21:35] you could see the gospel for what it
[21:37] really is that's why you must be born
[21:39] again but we believe that that you don't
[21:42] get the new birth just when you believe
[21:44] because Paul said in Acts chapter 19 he
[21:47] how they told that the Ephesian Church
[21:48] when when Apollo's was at Corinth and
[21:51] equal came to the Ephesian Church he
[21:52] said have you received a new birth since
[21:54] she believed in other words that the
[21:56] process is you've got to go through the
[21:57] gift of new birth and when God gives you
[22:00] the new birth it opens up your eyes
[22:03] Ephesians chapter 1 verse 17 18 says
[22:06] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[22:08] the father of glory may give unto you
[22:10] the spirit of wisdom and revelation and
[22:13] the knowledge of him and the knowledge
[22:14] of him in other words you become to be
[22:17] less confused your eyes are open and you
[22:21] know people people seem to not have a
[22:23] big problem with that when they when
[22:25] you're talking about water baptism or
[22:27] one God or the fact that there's no
[22:29] eternal hell because well how could
[22:32] there be an eternal hell if the only
[22:33] thing this eternal is God and if your
[22:35] inhale then that that dead this
[22:38] logically cannot be God is the only only
[22:41] only thing that is eternal but my point
[22:43] is that people have no problem with
[22:46] these little basic things as you're
[22:47] becoming a new Christian as you're
[22:48] entering that first stage of adoption
[22:50] they have no problem with the new birth
[22:52] being understanding at that level but
[22:54] then when you begin to talk about the
[22:56] deeper things
[22:56] who is this Melchizedek three pools the
[22:59] seven seals the seven thunders the
[23:00] threefold ministry the book of
[23:02] Revelation in the book of Hebrews then
[23:03] we draw back and say why don't we need
[23:05] to understand these things if the new
[23:07] birth is the understanding that what
[23:09] will adoption be that's a new
[23:12] understand and what do you have to do
[23:13] when you come to adoption you don't lay
[23:16] aside your understanding but you've got
[23:18] to keep moving on up you've got to climb
[23:20] that ladder you don't stop understanding
[23:22] the new birth is understanding an
[23:24] adoption will be understanding but it'll
[23:26] be more of it I don't mean to yell at
[23:32] you but maybe that'll help you stay away
[23:36] brother Brown said you knows what
[23:39] confuses everybody's because what
[23:40] brother Brown said in Satan's Eden he
[23:41] says we don't have to understand it we
[23:44] believe it because God said it so and
[23:45] that settles it forever the whole thing
[23:47] that's the way to believe it and listen
[23:49] when you're starting out of the new
[23:50] Christian you don't understand it how
[23:52] can you understand it you just believe
[23:54] you say I believe it I don't I don't
[23:56] understand why acts 2:38 he says to be
[23:59] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[24:01] but I'm moving on with a Lord helped me
[24:04] that you'll open up my eyes of
[24:05] understanding you start off believing
[24:08] and then then when you do believe God
[24:11] will give you understanding and that
[24:12] will give you the real kind of believing
[24:14] that you really need how can you really
[24:17] believe if you don't understand it but
[24:18] when you really do understand then you
[24:20] know you've got something and I want to
[24:23] say to you tonight that if you've got
[24:24] that spirit of adoption if the spirit of
[24:27] adoption is teaching you you will
[24:29] understand if you have that if you have
[24:32] that eagle nature living on the inside
[24:33] of you you will understand because an
[24:36] eagle will understand you will
[24:38] understand that if you want to know what
[24:40] the seven seals are and the three pools
[24:41] and all these things get that spirit of
[24:44] adoption in and open up by the opening
[24:46] of the word get the pile that word on
[24:48] the inside and he will teach it to you
[24:50] instruct it to you you will understand
[24:53] yeah we were talking recently about the
[24:57] seals and just kind of talking about can
[24:59] you can you take a body change without
[25:01] understanding the seals can't can you do
[25:04] it and I want to say I want to just kind
[25:07] of flip that statement around if you're
[25:10] going to take a body change you will
[25:12] understand the seals you will understand
[25:15] because you're an eagle and God has
[25:18] predestinated you to understanding he
[25:20] has given you he is a
[25:22] but you in this out with everything that
[25:24] you need he sent a prophet messenger in
[25:26] this day to open the cap of all the
[25:29] hidden mysteries that nobody could
[25:30] understand before what the seven
[25:32] churches were what the seven trumpets
[25:34] were what the seventh seal of the seven
[25:36] thunders all these things have been
[25:37] opened up so that you will be equipped
[25:39] to come to adoption to come to a place
[25:42] where your character has been molded to
[25:44] the image of Jesus Christ what God can
[25:46] look at you and say I trust him because
[25:48] he's just like I am brother but I'm
[25:54] saying it is the rising of the Sun he
[25:56] said let me straight a little scripture
[25:58] here for you I think we're off the phone
[26:00] but we are still here he that heareth my
[26:02] word of the believeth on him that sent
[26:03] me has that for everlasting life John
[26:06] 5:24 now look I'd go down the street and
[26:09] just take that literally what it is
[26:11] without the spiritual understanding not
[26:13] making us say nothing else but just
[26:14] saying what it is see the right word
[26:17] there in the Greek and the original it
[26:18] says he that understandeth my word now
[26:21] to prove that's right I go down here and
[26:23] here's a drunk coming along the street
[26:25] and with some other man's wife on his
[26:26] arms and cussing and taking God's name
[26:28] in vain and everything else like that
[26:30] say did you hear what that preacher said
[26:31] did you yeah yeah I heard it that don't
[26:34] mean he's got eternal life see see he
[26:37] that understand it's my word he that is
[26:40] an eagle do you understand how prevalent
[26:43] that that kind of thought process is we
[26:45] think that as long as we've got a the
[26:47] Bible playing in the background on a
[26:49] music channel or the gospel radio
[26:51] station but we have the tapes playing in
[26:53] the background or something that we can
[26:54] absorb it just by like osmosis or
[26:56] something but listen just because you
[26:58] stay say the statement I believe does
[27:01] not believe that you mean that you
[27:02] believe you've got to understand what
[27:05] you believe in you got to know it listen
[27:07] all of these things that I'm talking
[27:09] about here they're taking you up the
[27:10] statue of a perfect man taking you up
[27:12] into adoption into the capstone into
[27:14] that into that old core of the land that
[27:16] brother brother brother Dale has been
[27:18] preaching about all of those things are
[27:20] for your understanding
[27:22] brother Branham said in the Easter seal
[27:24] he said it's the Holy Spirit coming down
[27:26] to quicken make a lot of those people
[27:28] that's poor ordained of God to be in the
[27:30] rapture notice that is if he is a true
[27:33] he will understand the message of the
[27:35] hour if he's a true eagle now the little
[27:38] Eagle probably in the barnyard was
[27:40] eating all right but he knowed it wasn't
[27:41] just exactly right but then when he
[27:43] heard the truth and he received this
[27:45] truth and then he goes on and you know a
[27:48] lot of times when you say these kind of
[27:50] things it can scare the young people it
[27:53] can make him to think well I've got to
[27:55] do something now I've got I've got to
[27:57] work harder and that's true you do have
[28:00] to you have to read your Bible you have
[28:02] to pray you've got you got to get
[28:03] serious with God and everything but the
[28:05] point the main kind of effect that I
[28:07] want to I want to communicate tonight is
[28:09] God has equipped you so don't be afraid
[28:12] God has not given you the spirit of fear
[28:14] but he's got giving you the spirit of a
[28:17] sound mind he's given you everything
[28:19] that you have need of he's given you the
[28:22] spirit of adoption do you know do you
[28:24] know why he started you off with the
[28:26] spirit of adoption because the spirit of
[28:28] adoption is gonna bring you to adoption
[28:30] to a place where God can trust you and
[28:35] brother when I'm said in the Easter seal
[28:36] just moving on down to paragraph 90 he
[28:39] said paragraph 92 but he that
[28:43] understandeth he that knoweth his place
[28:45] in this hour he that heareth my word and
[28:48] believeth on him that sent me hath
[28:49] present tense eternal life shall not
[28:52] come into the judgment but has already
[28:55] passed from death unto life and let me
[28:57] say that again in paragraph 93 when this
[28:59] spirit has found you the individual has
[29:01] come upon you it is the potential of
[29:04] your eternal inheritance that God
[29:06] thought of you and made you for you
[29:09] before the foundation of the world it is
[29:11] your potential like if you asked me for
[29:15] an oak tree and I give you an acorn now
[29:18] the life for the oak tree is in the
[29:20] Acorn now but you have to wait till it
[29:23] grows up in other words you put a seed
[29:28] in the ground and after a while it
[29:31] produces a great big tree does that
[29:35] sound like you put up you put a little
[29:37] corn of wheat in the ground and after a
[29:39] while you got another corn of wheat you
[29:43] plant a corn in the ground and
[29:46] don't know what kind of thing what kind
[29:48] of seed would grow a broad tree but
[29:50] after a while you've got a bride tree
[29:52] because it comes up and at the top of
[29:54] the tree you know all these different
[29:56] types and things that brother Ben talked
[29:57] about the top of the tree is the best
[29:59] fruit and then the top of the tree can
[30:00] see the light of the Rising Sun and all
[30:02] those kind of things because look we're
[30:04] following their same pattern that is
[30:06] repeated all down through scripture
[30:09] abraham and ruth and elisha and all the
[30:14] different things as they journey from
[30:16] from starting off something like like
[30:18] abraham saying just here in the voice of
[30:20] god speak to him and say turn and go
[30:22] with me and it leads up all the way
[30:24] until finally he's confronted with God
[30:28] in flesh walking to him and and you and
[30:31] I are not gonna see God in flesh let's
[30:34] just let I'm just gonna preach you and I
[30:37] are not gonna see God in flesh like
[30:39] walking up to you like Abraham did but
[30:41] you're gonna see God veiled in a bride
[30:44] you're gonna see God veiling himself in
[30:46] you and I come into a maturity God is
[30:49] not gonna the rapture is not going to
[30:51] come for a little baby church it's going
[30:53] to come for a mature church that has
[30:55] heard the word and become the word and
[30:57] that's why we need a prophet do you see
[30:59] because all of these denominational
[31:01] systems could produce born-again
[31:02] children but they couldn't give you all
[31:05] the opening of the word enough to take
[31:07] you to give you a body change to give
[31:09] you that leap of faith to overcome to
[31:12] jump over that wall of the troops to
[31:15] jump over the wall of death and get out
[31:19] of here but you see he's given us the
[31:24] spirit of adoption in Galatians chapter
[31:28] 4 verses 1 to 5 it says now I say that
[31:30] the air as long as he is a child
[31:32] differeth nothing from a servant though
[31:33] he be Lord of all in other words when a
[31:35] little child is born he don't have
[31:37] Authority he doesn't have not he does
[31:39] not have access to the bank account
[31:41] there's no difference between the child
[31:43] and the servant that's working in the
[31:45] house but he's under tutors and
[31:47] governors until the time appointed of
[31:48] the Father in other words he's being
[31:50] raised up right and I want to kind of
[31:53] share this little little comparison with
[31:55] you and just go ahead and leave that up
[31:56] you know
[31:58] any of you fathers here if you would
[32:00] look at your sons and just kind of think
[32:02] meditate within yourself would I allow
[32:04] my son or my daughter to have access to
[32:09] my bank account that would be a very
[32:12] scary proposition wouldn't and you could
[32:14] be destined to do that to open up your
[32:17] bank account to give your checkbook to
[32:18] your till you're a little uh your young
[32:21] son or or young daughter even even when
[32:24] they grow older sorry Zach but I'm
[32:27] afraid how it'd be a little bit scared
[32:28] worried about giving you access to my
[32:31] bank account and you know a lot of times
[32:33] parents will talk about these things and
[32:35] they'll say well you know they talk
[32:36] about their son they saved up all this
[32:38] money and then he went out and and
[32:40] bought something that seems so foolish
[32:42] or whatever because what they're looking
[32:44] at looking at it from a more mature
[32:45] perspective the father is looking at
[32:48] that and saying I don't trust my child
[32:52] if I were to open up my bank account to
[32:54] this child for them to make a wise
[32:56] decision and every aspect when my yeah
[33:00] there's a lot of danger there you come
[33:01] back in the bank account be drained I'm
[33:03] talking about in the natural now you
[33:05] look at it the next weekend and all of a
[33:07] sudden you've got all these overdraft
[33:10] fees and now you're in a real fix that
[33:12] would cause all kind of discord in your
[33:14] home
[33:16] let's see God God knows what he's doing
[33:20] he knows how to raise up children and he
[33:22] gives you a tutor to bring you to the
[33:24] place where he can trust you and knows
[33:26] and knows that if he gives you all of
[33:28] this all of this access to his bank
[33:31] account so to speak that you're not
[33:33] going to use it foolishly but for
[33:35] example if you had the same kind of
[33:38] access that Adam did to just to just
[33:40] move a mountain or move a tree or
[33:42] whatever what's to say that you wouldn't
[33:44] drop a tree on somebody's head because
[33:46] you get really mad with him you get
[33:48] really I maybe be a little bit comical
[33:50] or whatever but you see my point God is
[33:53] raising us up so that he can trust us
[33:56] and the tutor that he gives us is the
[33:57] Holy Ghost now that that story that
[34:00] brother branham uses is in the in the
[34:01] eastern in the east they would give a
[34:03] tutor they would assign a tutor to raise
[34:06] up that child so that when they came to
[34:08] a place where the tutor goes back and
[34:10] reports back and says where the child is
[34:12] he's acting just like you dad he's
[34:14] acting just like you then in that time a
[34:17] special ceremony of adoption the child
[34:20] would be taken to the side and robed and
[34:22] all of these kind of things would be
[34:24] done to it to kind of go through a
[34:26] ceremony that now I've got my trust in
[34:28] this child and you know you can think
[34:32] almost we listened to that story that
[34:33] we're talking about different people and
[34:36] that's in the type there's a tutor and
[34:38] there's a father but the father himself
[34:40] and the spiritual has come himself to
[34:43] teach you and instruct you in the way
[34:45] that you should go God Himself is living
[34:49] inside of you instructing you according
[34:51] to your word let me keep reading this
[34:54] even so when we were children were in
[34:56] bondage under the elements of the world
[34:57] but when the fullness of the time was
[34:59] come God sent forth his son made of a
[35:02] woman made under the law to redeem them
[35:05] that were under the law that we might
[35:07] receive the adoption of sons in other
[35:11] words he wants you to be adopted that
[35:13] you've heard many time of Angelus will
[35:15] come through and they'll say God wants
[35:16] to give you the Holy Ghost more than you
[35:18] want it and all these kind of things and
[35:20] I think now is the time to evangelize a
[35:22] little bit higher
[35:24] God wants to adopt you more than you
[35:26] want it you begin to think that it's
[35:28] beyond you and all these kind of things
[35:30] but God wants to give you access to his
[35:32] bank account but you got to start off as
[35:37] a baby you know Paul when he began to
[35:45] instruct the Corinthians he said and I
[35:47] in 1st Corinthians chapter 3 verses 1 to
[35:49] 6 he said I brethren could not speak
[35:51] unto you as unto spiritual but as unto
[35:54] carnal even as under babe's in Christ I
[35:57] fed you with milk and not with meat for
[35:59] hitherto you were not able to bear it
[36:00] neither yet now are ye able for a year
[36:04] yet carnal for whereas there is among
[36:06] you envy and strife and divisions are
[36:09] you not carnal and walk as men you begin
[36:13] to see kind of the the requirements for
[36:15] adoption the requirements are that
[36:18] you've got to have a
[36:20] a different kind of character you can't
[36:23] be pulling at churches and saying well
[36:25] we're better than them and envying among
[36:27] yourselves and and you know it's easy to
[36:29] say we should not be doing these kind of
[36:32] things we should not be doing that but
[36:33] you know the answer though the the
[36:35] vaccine that God has provided to get rid
[36:37] of all that that our bad behavior is the
[36:40] Word of God and you know we can beat one
[36:43] another and all those kind of things but
[36:44] the Word of God is what will actually
[36:47] change us and mold us into his image and
[36:50] he said for for wild one saith I am of
[36:53] Paul and another I am of apollos are you
[36:55] not carnal who then is Paul and who is
[36:58] Apollo's but ministers by whom he
[36:59] believes even as the Lord gave to every
[37:02] man and Paul is speaking this way to the
[37:04] Corinthians he had to speak to them as a
[37:06] little babies because they they could
[37:08] not understand these deep things of God
[37:10] they could not dip their toe into the
[37:12] deeper waters because they were not
[37:14] quiet pressurized to that yet but when
[37:16] he spoke to the Ephesians he talked to
[37:18] them in a little bit different language
[37:20] he was able to speak to them in a way
[37:22] like in Ephesians chapter 4 where he
[37:23] said and he gave some apostles and some
[37:25] prophets and some evangelists and some
[37:28] pastors and teachers why he explained to
[37:32] them why God put those gifts in the
[37:35] church that we're not just coming to
[37:37] church just for a show but we're coming
[37:40] to have our character perfected he said
[37:43] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[37:45] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[37:47] the body of Christ
[37:48] till we all come in the unity of the
[37:50] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[37:53] God unto a perfect man under the measure
[37:56] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[37:58] that we henceforth be no more children
[38:00] and now let me pause right there that we
[38:04] were coming over and one of my kids at
[38:05] one of my younger kids I mean I don't
[38:07] mean to call you out but I'll just ask
[38:08] do you know what adoption is and they're
[38:10] like I don't know I don't know so I want
[38:13] to pause so that everybody kind of has a
[38:16] baseline what is adoption adoption is
[38:20] when God sees that you are a mature
[38:22] Christian and you match up with his word
[38:25] you start off with a baby and you grow
[38:29] up like an acorn to a tree like Abraham
[38:33] - looking at the son of man you start up
[38:38] so he's saying that we his forth be no
[38:40] more children because God doesn't want
[38:43] us to be little babies tossed to and fro
[38:46] and carried about with every wind of
[38:48] doctrine by the sleight of men and
[38:50] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[38:54] wait to deceive you realize how
[38:57] important that is now in this day an
[39:00] hour we're looking at people where
[39:01] people are so confused that they don't
[39:03] know what the mark of the beast is they
[39:05] don't know whether they should be
[39:07] concerned about a chip in the hand or
[39:08] not they don't know whether they should
[39:10] be concerned about what people are
[39:12] telling them or not because listen the
[39:13] antidote to confusion is the Word of God
[39:16] and the only way that you cannot be
[39:19] confused in this hour it's tough to come
[39:21] to a command a place in the word that no
[39:24] matter what the devil throws at you he
[39:26] doesn't know what to do with you because
[39:28] you are not confused even the Bible says
[39:30] the whole world will be deceived by the
[39:33] beast and that all those things the
[39:35] whole world will be deceived except for
[39:37] that small little group of the elect
[39:39] there will be a little group that will
[39:41] not be deceived why because they will be
[39:44] the word walking on the earth and you
[39:47] see this this hope this whole process of
[39:50] growth don't get tired on me now
[39:54] Rod's awakened from that slumber this
[39:59] whole process is to build your character
[40:02] and not our own character but the
[40:03] character of Christ in us you know
[40:09] that'll change your perspective about
[40:11] church because church is not for baby in
[40:14] your feelings church is for character
[40:17] development churches to build up not
[40:20] little hothouse plants but to build a
[40:22] plant that can stand the wind and the
[40:25] rain and the dust storms and all of the
[40:28] things that didn't ever can throw at it
[40:29] just build up a plant that maybe if they
[40:32] put you out of your house and put you
[40:34] out on the street you'll say I'm
[40:35] standing with God newer garlis maybe
[40:38] like like job when God took away his
[40:41] whole family and everything he owned job
[40:43] said though
[40:44] slay me yet will I trust him that is a
[40:47] kind of plant that God wants to mold us
[40:50] into in church okay a plant with cared a
[40:53] godly Christian character molded in us
[40:58] you know I was thinking about I was
[41:00] looking at all the different kind of
[41:01] tests that that that brother branham
[41:04] went through and kind of compared with a
[41:05] different kind of test that brother
[41:06] Brett that Abraham went through and all
[41:08] the different ones in Scripture because
[41:10] as God is building our character he's
[41:13] he's testing us to see what we're gonna
[41:15] do with his word do you know I believe
[41:17] that when Naomi said told her Ruth to go
[41:19] down and lay it at the feet of Boaz that
[41:22] that was a little test how strange that
[41:24] would be though was he gonna think about
[41:26] me go lay down at the feet of Boaz and
[41:30] and then see what's gonna happen in the
[41:32] middle of the night nobody else is out
[41:34] there that says what a strange thing
[41:36] what a strange thing for Abraham to have
[41:38] to go up there and raise his knife up
[41:40] above Isaac's head and put him up there
[41:43] on that altar what a strange thing and
[41:45] you know there was a lot of tests in
[41:47] brother Browns life and the reason I'm
[41:49] going to bring this out tonight is God
[41:50] is gonna test you and when you fail the
[41:53] test don't give up and just lay down and
[41:55] give up but get up get back up and keep
[41:57] going again because there's a lot of
[41:59] chests that brother branham filled God
[42:04] told him to go to Durban South Africa
[42:06] instead of Johannesburg and those all he
[42:09] said all those preachers got around said
[42:11] one of them said do you say that they
[42:14] are you the only one that God speaks to
[42:16] and he said a little argument broke out
[42:18] on the side of the road and that was a
[42:20] mile what a test to see what he would do
[42:22] and he failed that test and he got
[42:24] deadly sick because of it told that
[42:27] little white lie to the IRS auditor when
[42:30] he called and he said well hey he told
[42:32] it he stepped outside and he said tell
[42:33] tell him told his wife tell him I'm not
[42:36] here technically that was true and he
[42:38] felt so bad for telling that little
[42:40] white lie that he went and told the IRS
[42:42] auditor I apologize he made it right he
[42:46] failed the test but he made it right and
[42:48] in the end he looked better to that IRS
[42:49] auditor because he humbled himself and
[42:51] apologized
[42:52] you know the angel told him you when he
[42:55] explained the first in the second pool
[42:57] you were
[42:58] plenty he said I'm so sorry I messed
[43:00] everything up he failed he failed the
[43:02] test but you know he picked himself back
[43:04] up again and he moved on the next time
[43:06] he didn't fail that test he kept that
[43:08] third pool to a sick secret to himself
[43:12] think about that at that time when it
[43:14] when the ball came and right in the
[43:17] middle of that pin and he and he spoke
[43:18] out in love to the bull what cuz gods
[43:21] training him up he's training him up
[43:23] just like he trained David up where he
[43:25] gave him a bowl and a line and he did
[43:28] all that before he got to Goliath so
[43:31] that when David got to Goliath he would
[43:32] be ready to confront that big enemy he
[43:36] was ready and and so God his truth was
[43:38] training up brother branham and speak to
[43:40] this ball speak to the yellowjacket said
[43:42] he told him i didn't mean to disturb you
[43:44] my if we could speak to one another in
[43:46] those words instead of bumping each
[43:48] other on the head if we can say if we
[43:50] can speak to one another like he spoke
[43:51] to those Yellowjackets I'm sorry
[43:54] instead of rolling up an anger and that
[43:56] and then those two people that were
[43:57] making out in the church service says
[43:59] the word was going to forth and and it
[44:01] was a mile what a test whatever you say
[44:04] was gonna happen he's beginning to put
[44:07] to bring him into a speaking condition
[44:09] testing whether his character is the
[44:12] right kind of character or not whatever
[44:14] you say and he says I forgive you my
[44:17] goodness
[44:18] I wondered tonight if you were to
[44:20] inspect your own self and inspect your
[44:21] own life and the way that you react to
[44:23] your children and the way that you react
[44:25] to others in church and your loved ones
[44:27] do you have that same kind of character
[44:29] that you know he maybe he had a right to
[44:31] say something harmful to those people
[44:34] that were disrupting the church service
[44:35] it was not it was not a good spirit make
[44:38] it out in there you you think well I
[44:40] many times we think we've got a right to
[44:42] just slap one another but he spoke in
[44:45] love because he had that kind of a godly
[44:49] Christian character moving up to
[44:51] brotherly kindness and then God begins
[44:54] to trust him to where he could say speak
[44:57] and a squirrel will run out on a limb
[44:58] speak up on the top of that mountain and
[45:00] the wind the snow storm will move back
[45:02] because he's coming to a place where God
[45:05] can trust him if God can't trust you how
[45:08] is he gonna pull the non spiritual gifts
[45:10] into the church if you don't know what
[45:11] to do with them will you run all over
[45:13] the place if somebody begins to speak in
[45:15] tongues that and maybe they don't say
[45:16] the right thing maybe maybe something
[45:18] gets carried away a little bit what kind
[45:21] of character do you have to know how to
[45:23] discern right from wrong
[45:24] that kind of character only comes from
[45:27] the word and God is producing the right
[45:29] kind of character in us you know a lot
[45:32] of times I want to bring this out too we
[45:35] kind of think we think of the new birth
[45:37] if you don't have it as such a great
[45:39] mystical thing that is so far away from
[45:43] you and then when you get the new birth
[45:44] adoption seems like such a great
[45:47] mystical thing like it's so far almost
[45:50] out of reach from us like like we think
[45:53] of Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration
[45:55] with Moses and Elijah standing there and
[45:58] a voice from heaven speaks out and that
[46:01] typing the the adoption ceremony we
[46:05] think of a brother branham going up on
[46:07] that mount and being caught up in a
[46:08] constellation of angels and and all of
[46:11] these great things happening but I
[46:14] wonder if it's really just as simple as
[46:16] you come into your place and knowing
[46:19] what that is coming to a place where God
[46:21] can trust you and maybe maybe there's
[46:24] not any emotion at all maybe it's just
[46:27] as simple you know you know in the book
[46:30] of James a book of acts it tells a
[46:33] little story about how James James was
[46:36] one of the first apostles to die
[46:38] and they left him in the grave he was
[46:40] not raised from the dead or anything but
[46:42] you turn over to uh I think it's acts
[46:45] acts 19 is Cornelius anywhere maybe acts
[46:50] 10 somewhere somewhere toward the end
[46:51] and there's a mention of a little woman
[46:54] named Tabitha and it says her name was
[46:56] Dorcas which means Dover and and you
[46:59] would think that James would have been
[47:01] raised from the dead for his
[47:02] contribution to the church but he was a
[47:04] little woman who says who had done many
[47:07] alms deeds this little woman who said at
[47:10] home and she just sewed as she made
[47:12] Goods for people now now I'm saying
[47:16] something profound here you think that
[47:19] you've got to be a great big somebody to
[47:22] come to adoption which is not the case
[47:24] you can come to a little play a place of
[47:27] adoption just being a little housewife
[47:29] just iron and your husband's clothes
[47:32] doing something for the Lord doing
[47:34] something for his kingdom because his
[47:37] word is being revealed in you and this
[47:40] she was just a little seamstress doing
[47:43] what seems so in scon sequential and yet
[47:45] all the saints he got together and they
[47:47] began to pray and she was raised up from
[47:49] the dead and it said in the in the book
[47:51] because of her many harms deeds because
[47:54] listen God value who serves so much
[47:57] because of her place that she had in the
[48:00] body of Christ
[48:01] and you think your place is worthless
[48:03] because nobody nobody maybe knows what
[48:06] you're doing nobody looks at you and
[48:08] recognizes the place in the position
[48:10] that you have because it might be
[48:12] something where you're just maybe in
[48:14] this day and hour you're just making
[48:16] Mass for the nurses in the hospital
[48:18] maybe you're just sewing patches on your
[48:21] husband maybe your husband is a minister
[48:23] and all you can do is just patch up his
[48:25] clothes but you're doing something that
[48:27] God recognizes you're manifesting the
[48:30] kind of character that God wants to see
[48:33] that's the kind of person that God wants
[48:35] to mold listen the people that are
[48:38] taking in the rapture might not be the
[48:40] great big ministers and things that
[48:41] appreciate all around the earth but it
[48:43] might be a little with a woman with a
[48:45] dirt floor in the middle of Africa
[48:46] somewhere that God comes and says I see
[48:49] the kind of character that I want to see
[48:51] it might be some money that that you
[48:54] would overlook because God is more like
[48:57] something in secret adoption is when he
[48:59] comes and takes you to the side and
[49:01] gives you a little ceremony so just you
[49:05] and God alone the God is doing something
[49:07] that maybe maybe the rest of the world
[49:09] does overlooks but yet God is molding
[49:12] something in you he's molding in you a
[49:14] gold gold tried in the fire that's why
[49:17] we've got to be tested and molded that's
[49:19] why we've got to come to church because
[49:21] God is molding us just like they made
[49:23] that that candlestick the seven golden
[49:25] candle stick in the Old Testament it was
[49:27] beaten gold and I believe that they beat
[49:31] it with love they took that mallet like
[49:34] the ministers are doing the day and they
[49:36] were
[49:36] maybe with as they just to kind of just
[49:39] to kind of dramatize it a little bit
[49:41] beating never swing they would say thou
[49:43] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[49:46] heart and all thy soul and they would
[49:48] turn it over and say thou shalt honor
[49:50] thy father and mother
[49:51] and it would turn it over thou shalt not
[49:54] bear false witness do you see that's how
[49:56] you're being beaten when you come into
[49:58] the house of God being beaten so that
[50:00] God can look into that that goal and see
[50:03] his own reflection when he can look at
[50:06] you and see his own reflection then
[50:09] that's when you're a candidate for
[50:11] adoption that's when you're at a place
[50:13] where God can begin to open up these
[50:15] deeper mysteries to you begin to take
[50:18] you to the place where he's ready to
[50:20] pour out his spirit into their church
[50:21] and change your body oh oh oh this is
[50:27] not too deep I hope this is as simple so
[50:29] simple that if you're five years old you
[50:31] can get it that God wants to bring you
[50:33] to maturity that the new birth is not
[50:36] the end of the story that when you're
[50:38] born again there's more to the story
[50:41] it's bored when you're born again God
[50:43] now you're equipped for God to put his
[50:46] character his life in you to see to see
[50:49] you withstand the trials you see do you
[50:57] realize that God is building he's
[50:58] building he's building a body he's
[51:01] building a bride he's building you up
[51:02] cuz the 1st Peter chapter 2 says we're
[51:08] for laying aside all malice and all
[51:10] guile and apakah she's and envies and
[51:11] all evil speakings as newborn babes
[51:15] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[51:18] you may grow thereby if so be ye have
[51:22] tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom
[51:25] coming as unto a living stone disallowed
[51:29] indeed of men but chosen of God and
[51:32] precious ye also as lively stones are
[51:36] built up a spiritual house an holy
[51:38] priesthood that this seems like you're
[51:42] changing that you're changing the story
[51:44] by the bomb now you're talking about
[51:45] building you were talking my plants now
[51:47] you're talking about building but it's
[51:48] all the same story
[51:50] God starts with a little brick in your
[51:51] life and he lays brick after brick after
[51:53] brick until he's built you up as lively
[51:56] stones are built up a spiritual house
[51:58] he's building up a place where he can
[52:00] come and Tabernacle he can't eat cuz he
[52:02] wants to feel every fiber of your being
[52:05] he wants to fill you up so completely
[52:07] that it changes your mortal being and
[52:10] takes you in the rapture he said an holy
[52:13] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[52:15] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[52:17] Christ wherefore also it is contained in
[52:21] the scripture behold I lay in Zion a
[52:23] chief Cornerstone elect precious and he
[52:26] that believeth on him shall not be
[52:28] confounded
[52:29] in other words shall not be confused you
[52:32] will not be confused but you start off
[52:35] with that chief Cornerstone just like
[52:37] you start off with a little acorn just
[52:39] like you start off with a little mustard
[52:40] seed and it grows into a great big tree
[52:44] the problem though is that God is
[52:47] waiting on you I'm talking about
[52:52] building now I know I'm kind of
[52:55] switching the story a little bit bear
[52:56] with me you know when Daniel there in
[53:01] Chapter 9 he got a revelation that they
[53:02] were coming out it was right there in
[53:04] the the 68-year and he got a revelation
[53:07] that they were fixing to leave Babylon
[53:09] leave the bondage of that that that
[53:12] confusion system and come out and go
[53:16] where to the promised land that they
[53:18] were coming to come out and go back to
[53:21] the God's promises and and there was a
[53:25] lot of things involved in that so a
[53:27] couple of years later they had after he
[53:30] got that revelation they the serous
[53:32] drain that Euphrates River and snuck up
[53:35] under the wall and and and the Jews that
[53:38] there was a turnover a political
[53:41] turnover and the Jews began to go out
[53:43] and and as they went they went back
[53:46] first Zechariah began to build the
[53:48] temple and and it was a ruble and and he
[53:52] was coming about it by the to prophet
[53:53] Zechariah and Haggai because you see
[53:55] they had caught the vision of what that
[53:57] prophet had said that they were supposed
[53:59] to do return back to the promised land
[54:01] returned back
[54:03] - the original faith go back to what
[54:06] they had originally taught and they
[54:07] caught the vision of what Daniel had
[54:10] said for them to do well you know all
[54:12] these troubles and things assail them
[54:14] and over time that the things were left
[54:16] off and after a while then Ezra and
[54:19] Nehemiah then they kind of took up that
[54:21] mantle and they began to rebuild the
[54:24] walls because see Daniel had told him
[54:26] that the walls would be rebuilt in
[54:28] trouble sometimes you see you see the
[54:30] point I'm trying to make it was up to
[54:32] them to fulfill that vision
[54:35] Daniel had prophesized that the walls
[54:37] will be rebuilt that they would go back
[54:39] but it was up to them to actually go on
[54:41] that journey and rebuild the walls and
[54:43] they ended up having to rebuild the
[54:45] walls with a with a trial in one hand
[54:47] laying mortar and with a sword in the
[54:50] other hand and you know I believe that
[54:53] what we're looking at is the same thing
[54:55] a happening now because we are living
[54:57] under the vision of a prophet that has
[55:00] restored to us the original faith but
[55:03] now it's up to us to go back and rebuild
[55:05] the Walter it's up to us God is waiting
[55:09] on us we're not we're not waiting on God
[55:11] because God has given us everything that
[55:14] we need in this hour to go back to the
[55:16] promised land to rebuild Jerusalem to
[55:19] rebuild the temple to get everything
[55:21] ready so that God's presence could come
[55:24] and live inside of it again
[55:26] do you know that's why brother Branham
[55:28] preached that sermon there's a sermon
[55:31] the blushing prophet it is because when
[55:34] Ezra got back he looked at the
[55:36] predicament of the people and he
[55:38] realized that the people just like today
[55:40] now now I wonder if you can look with
[55:44] spiritual eyes at the predicament of the
[55:46] people and wonder if they are actually
[55:48] if they actually realize what they're
[55:50] supposed to be doing as we looked at the
[55:53] situation and he saw that the people had
[55:55] United themselves with all these strange
[55:58] wives in other words they had they were
[56:00] taking all these strange doctrines they
[56:02] were uniting themselves with these
[56:03] strange doctrines and they they hadn't
[56:05] let go that there was the notion that
[56:07] you don't need adoption they hadn't let
[56:09] go of the notion that you don't need why
[56:11] do you need to understand the seven
[56:12] seals they hadn't let go all this kind
[56:14] of stuff
[56:16] and Ezra was so anguish to himself that
[56:18] he fell down on his feet and began to
[56:21] wail and cried and he said the Bible
[56:24] says in Ezra chapter 9 verse 6 and he
[56:26] said I am ashamed and blush to lift up
[56:29] my face to the my god for our iniquities
[56:32] are increased over our head and our
[56:33] trespass has grown under up under the
[56:35] heavens and I believe it will make any
[56:38] born-again Christian brush to look at
[56:40] the situation where you see what should
[56:42] be born-again believers saying I don't
[56:44] believe that I've got to understand what
[56:46] the prophet of God labor to preach and
[56:49] labor to lay out there for the people to
[56:52] understand I don't believe that that we
[56:54] need to that we can profit by this that
[56:57] it's so far out of our reach I believe
[57:00] that would make anybody blush you see
[57:02] what what it what are almost equates to
[57:06] really is Jacob with the birthright you
[57:10] know your birthright is to go back into
[57:12] the promised land and just say I would
[57:15] rather have a bowl of lentils than what
[57:17] God has given me as denying your
[57:19] birthright stew it's almost ten I'm out
[57:21] - the same thing is that the believers
[57:23] did when they got to Cadiz marnya
[57:25] I would rather I would rather just stay
[57:27] in my own predicament than to accept the
[57:29] Word of God and to dive into the word
[57:32] that he's given to us brother Bram said
[57:35] and here you hear me set out shameful it
[57:37] must be as as with a prophet blush
[57:39] before God that the Holy Spirit must
[57:41] have to blush before the Father or the
[57:42] conduct of his children how that how sin
[57:45] has crept into the church the things
[57:47] that goes on in the church today that we
[57:49] will call ourselves the Church of God I
[57:51] don't want to hurt you now but I want to
[57:53] help you in brother Branham at night in
[57:55] 1956 and here you hear me he says that I
[57:58] wonder how the Holy Spirit is how it
[57:59] must as a prophet of old blushed when he
[58:02] stood in the presence of God when he
[58:03] brings the character and the conduct of
[58:06] the church in this day how he must blush
[58:08] when he stands before the Father and
[58:10] says oh they're all separated they're
[58:12] acting like the world they're marrying
[58:14] and giving in marriage the women are and
[58:16] he goes on and so forth you realize the
[58:18] character that the churches make Matt is
[58:20] manifesting it's supposed to be the
[58:22] character of the Word of God that kind
[58:25] of character only comes by hearing the
[58:27] word
[58:29] I know y'all get tired I'm trying to
[58:35] wind up here brother brems said it here
[58:40] you him again there's so many times we
[58:42] preached on here yelling and many times
[58:44] he would preach on Israel why because to
[58:47] come to a place of adoption you've got
[58:50] to get past all these things that Ezra
[58:52] was looking at people living wrong and
[58:54] doing wrong and and you could almost get
[58:57] sidetracked in looking at somebody that
[58:59] you think should be far along and think
[59:01] well I'm just I'm good off I'm just as
[59:05] good if I just if I just do like that
[59:07] person and that's not that's what
[59:10] brother Branham a lot of times he would
[59:11] really be hitting on us it's looking at
[59:13] one another we use one another as our
[59:16] example instead of using the Word of God
[59:18] as the thing that we should be looking
[59:20] at even even so much as loot using like
[59:23] brother branham do you think that your
[59:26] adoption experience may not come like
[59:29] his did where you're caught up in a
[59:31] constellation of angels it may be as
[59:34] simple as that little Dorcas little
[59:36] Tabitha sitting there doing what she's
[59:38] supposed to be finding her place in the
[59:40] word do you see whether I'm said didn't
[59:44] hear you him he said God makes men
[59:46] different and he has diversities of
[59:47] gifts and send them sends them to his
[59:49] church but we just cramped down on one
[59:52] and there you go you see you don't get
[59:53] the wisdom of the Spirit that's the
[59:56] reason God can't place us into the
[59:57] position where we should be in his body
[59:59] for to one is given this sort of a gift
[1:00:02] to another this sort of a gift to
[1:00:04] another another sort of a gift and so
[1:00:07] forth but all the same body but we want
[1:00:10] to be just exactly like the other one
[1:00:12] you can't do that you must use the
[1:00:14] wisdom of the word the Bible's would our
[1:00:17] blueprint is but you see God is God is
[1:00:21] what he's given us he's equipped us in
[1:00:23] this hour he's given us the spirit of
[1:00:26] adoption it is called the spirit of
[1:00:28] adoption because God goal his purpose is
[1:00:31] to bring you to adoption to a place
[1:00:34] where he can trust you to a place where
[1:00:36] like you know Jesus was taken up onto
[1:00:39] that mountain and the Bible says that
[1:00:40] that voice
[1:00:41] here you him a place where God can use
[1:00:44] your lips just like he used Jesus's lips
[1:00:48] the musicians can come on forward
[1:00:50] because you were meant to come to
[1:00:52] maturity the spirit of adoption is
[1:00:55] working you and God has more for you
[1:00:57] than just a new birth there's more for
[1:00:59] you than just to be born again you know
[1:01:05] we're not we're not standing in the ring
[1:01:07] like Ezra was when he when he opened up
[1:01:09] the law to the people and they began to
[1:01:12] be anguished and began to repent and
[1:01:13] wonder what was wrong in their lives but
[1:01:15] I believe that our hearts can still be
[1:01:17] stirred up within us even though we're
[1:01:19] not standing in the rain still we're
[1:01:21] standing before before a fearful
[1:01:25] requirement because in this in this day
[1:01:28] we've got we've got to come to adoption
[1:01:31] we've got to come to a place where God
[1:01:33] can trust us and can use us that's why I
[1:01:37] believe I believe that now is the hour
[1:01:39] of adoption time it's adoption time if
[1:01:41] they're ever if there ever was an
[1:01:42] adoption time and now is that time you
[1:01:45] look out on the things of this world and
[1:01:46] I think something has got to happen
[1:01:49] something's got to take place I believe
[1:01:52] that God has given us everything we need
[1:01:55] let's stand to our feet and just worship
[1:01:58] the Lord and just praise Him
[1:02:04] the sing that song well we it's the unit

[1:07:17] comfort and take care of them and
[1:07:19] everything alright anybody anything to
[1:07:21] say before we go we have so many changes
[1:07:27] lately too we have to get everything in
[1:07:30] order
[1:07:30] keep it up with the world who's on first
[1:07:38] and what's on second yeah some of you
[1:07:40] younger people
[1:07:41] Duggal that some of you older people
[1:07:44] know what it is but some have a concern
[1:07:48] about sunday between services eating
[1:07:52] what we're going to do is if you want to
[1:07:55] go out and eat that's fine I'm sure
[1:07:56] they're opening the drive-through but
[1:07:58] you can come back what we're going to do
[1:07:59] is we're going to set the white tables
[1:08:01] out underneath the awning so we can do
[1:08:05] our social distancing because it does
[1:08:07] get kind of crowded in between services
[1:08:10] but we we want you to stay but we will
[1:08:13] have those out here and the picnic
[1:08:15] tables it's going to be 83 degrees so it
[1:08:18] won't be so bad we make them put some
[1:08:21] fans out there or something but we'll
[1:08:24] work on that but we're gonna do tonight
[1:08:26] remember when we get rid of this mess
[1:08:29] one row at a time I'll help you on the
[1:08:32] way out is there singing
[1:08:33] but God bless you thank you for coming
[1:08:35] and thank you for doing your social
[1:08:37] ditch social distancing and we're just
[1:08:40] gonna pray that that this thing I'll all
[1:08:43] be over real quick because Bob said it's
[1:08:46] the bride of Jesus Christ that's why
[1:08:47] everything's happening because of us
[1:08:50] everything it's happening because the
[1:08:52] bride is still here and yet God's
[1:08:55] getting us ready and moving us to get us
[1:08:56] out of here so whatever it is be it
[1:08:59] virus doesn't matter to me I just I just
[1:09:04] one day we ain't gonna have to worry
[1:09:06] about money
[1:09:07] politics and rules because we'll all be
[1:09:14] in glory and we'll all be eternal and
[1:09:15] this'll all be over and I stand by that
[1:09:17] brother Collins today he fought a fight
[1:09:22] he won the race he don't have to hurt no
[1:09:27] more ain't gotta worry about no virus in
[1:09:30] that dimension he took it he took all
[1:09:33] that he built that brother Bible told me
[1:09:34] he took every bit of that that God gave
[1:09:37] him inside and he just stepped over into
[1:09:39] another dimension couldn't take his
[1:09:40] human body with him cuz it wasn't time
[1:09:43] yet so now we're gonna honor the human
[1:09:45] body and put it in the grave the Bible
[1:09:46] says we plant them in corruption but
[1:09:48] God's gonna raise them in in corruption
[1:09:50] but God will not raise them until we get
[1:09:52] ready you and I are the voice of that
[1:09:56] resurrection in the world today so you
[1:09:59] just keep praying for each one pray for
[1:10:01] the world that this thing will be
[1:10:03] settled at least for a little while so
[1:10:05] we can get back together but thank you
[1:10:06] for some distancing sure enough wash
[1:10:08] your hands those of you that are going
[1:10:10] to funeral tomorrow
[1:10:11] I would suggest bringing a mask just in
[1:10:14] case we're gonna have service outside
[1:10:16] but still there'll be a lot of older
[1:10:18] people there make sure that we
[1:10:19] completely are safe I don't want to
[1:10:22] provoke anything and you know I know you
[1:10:24] don't either so god bless you like I
[1:10:27] said everything's come Sunday's 10
[1:10:30] o'clock I'll be doing my Sunday School
