[0:00] now let's go to John 1 or you can just
[0:02] let me get it here and what we've been
[0:05] speaking on
[0:08] is
[0:10] you got to make a little bit higher than
[0:11] that three sons name
[0:17] there you go for three son's name
[0:21] now
[0:22] what are the three sons names
[0:25] son of what
[0:28] God
[0:30] I'm sorry if y'all can't see it over
[0:31] there I can't turn it Son of God Son of
[0:35] what amen
[0:38] and Son of David
[0:43] three sons names now remember it one God
[0:47] right
[0:48] let's read verse one John 1 verse one in
[0:51] the beginning was the word now if you
[0:54] look up that word and just kind of
[0:55] background a little bit before something
[0:56] hadn't been here
[0:58] that word is logos
[1:01] if you remember we spoke on that a
[1:03] couple of Sundays ago and I
[1:06] from what I've gathered it's helped a
[1:07] lot of people because it helps explain
[1:09] what that logos is
[1:11] it's it's the logo or the poster child
[1:14] of what God always is to me that logos
[1:16] covers everything
[1:17] Son of God Son of Man son of David all
[1:20] in the low God because remember it's all
[1:23] wrapped up in the Sun all right and then
[1:25] the only way we can understand God
[1:28] is for him to condescend or step down in
[1:32] a form
[1:34] of what
[1:36] speech
[1:38] it does no good if you don't say
[1:40] anything all right
[1:43] so you gotta you know you can have all
[1:45] this intelligence in your mind but
[1:47] unless you speak it and then develop it
[1:50] what if um
[1:52] what if a man like Albert Einstein which
[1:54] had one of the greatest Minds in history
[1:55] what if he even never said a word
[1:59] we would have fallen way behind in
[2:01] technology but he began to speak what
[2:04] his thoughts were and just being a a
[2:07] normal well he wasn't normal but he had
[2:10] a human brain just like me and you do
[2:12] his brain was no bigger
[2:15] his capacity was the same as ours
[2:17] because you know even when Albert
[2:19] Einstein died they took his brain out
[2:21] and they studied his brain now since the
[2:24] whenever he died in the in the 50s
[2:27] or the early 60s he died and they've
[2:30] been trying to
[2:33] um
[2:36] they tried to
[2:38] um
[2:40] see if his brain was more special than
[2:42] anybody else's it wasn't
[2:45] he just was able to use his more
[2:48] than anybody else so in the beginning
[2:50] was the word which is the logos the
[2:53] speech are what the word of God
[2:56] and the Word was with God and the Word
[2:59] was God
[3:00] so the word is God the word is not a
[3:02] separate person from God
[3:04] the same was in the beginning with God
[3:06] what God and His Thoughts dwelt alone
[3:11] all right we're going to go back in like
[3:13] we said in the chart here that brother
[3:15] Dale did before the eternal
[3:19] but remember
[3:20] in his great mind he always was all
[3:24] these attributes
[3:25] okay
[3:27] the great eternal
[3:29] God even before there was an atom on the
[3:32] earth he was a Healer
[3:34] because by his foreknowledge he already
[3:36] looked down through time and seen
[3:38] everything I I was using this the other
[3:40] day and for those of you that weren't
[3:41] here last Sunday I was eating cashews or
[3:45] peanuts cashews I was eating cashews and
[3:47] I looked down and there was one left in
[3:49] my hand and I said God you know you
[3:51] could tell me what dirt this came from
[3:55] see that's that's an infinite God and he
[3:58] could trace that dirt back to the Garden
[4:00] of Eden
[4:02] he could show you the whole process all
[4:05] the way up to where it came to the plant
[4:07] come into the tree come into the fruit
[4:09] come into the cashew the cashew went to
[4:11] California to be processed it was
[4:14] processed in the big back and it was
[4:16] sent to Gainesville Georgia or would you
[4:19] buy them Walmart
[4:20] Aldi went to Aldi Warehouse Aldi
[4:24] Warehouse to my house and here I picked
[4:26] it up and there the cashew what that's
[4:28] got it now how you gonna understand that
[4:32] you can right man can only trace it back
[4:36] so far to maybe a lot number or what
[4:38] tree it came up of but God can actually
[4:40] take those elements and go all the way
[4:42] back in the beginning of time and show
[4:44] you where that cash you came from we'll
[4:46] see that's an infinite dot so being
[4:48] infinite God he knew what we needed
[4:50] before we got here
[4:52] he was a savior a Healer a redeemer all
[4:55] these things
[4:58] and this this big great God funneled
[5:00] himself down to a form called a logos
[5:04] and the logos when we look at the logos
[5:07] we see the all of God that we can
[5:09] understand
[5:10] because like I said now go back and try
[5:12] to understand how he knows all these
[5:14] things brother Brown said he knew every
[5:16] Knack that would be on the earth Nat
[5:18] you know how many trillions and sub
[5:21] zillions of gnats have been on this
[5:23] Earth gotten you every one of them
[5:25] brother Brown said he knew how many
[5:26] times he would bat his little eye
[5:28] and how much time will it make see
[5:31] that's why a lot brother I'm like
[5:32] brother Joe then you just you just sit
[5:33] there and shake your head because you
[5:35] don't
[5:36] but see that's not for us to understand
[5:38] at this moment we'll never be that God
[5:41] but he did give us a part of himself
[5:43] which is the same substance because look
[5:46] in the beginning was the word now watch
[5:48] brother Dale been preaching on
[5:51] how did that what got planted what got
[5:54] planted in you
[5:56] was the word right now listen let me
[5:59] tell you how to connect that
[6:01] God knew that was the word you needed
[6:04] before the foundation of the world and
[6:06] he wrote it so you could see it and hear
[6:08] it while you're down here
[6:10] everybody get that say Amen or old man
[6:13] right and what age you'd live in
[6:15] absolutely see so he he put it all in 66
[6:19] books
[6:20] like we were talking about the analogy
[6:22] of McDonald's when you see the golden
[6:23] arches you think of what McDonald's
[6:25] but in the forming of McDonald's you go
[6:28] all the way back to the McDonald
[6:29] Brothers in the 40s and you go to Ray
[6:31] Kroc then they sold billions of
[6:33] hamburgers patties
[6:35] pickles salt pepper why'd be a volume of
[6:40] a book you couldn't even read but when
[6:42] you look at that golden arches you're
[6:43] worried about eating a hamburger you're
[6:45] not worried about when they got started
[6:46] and what place they started from you
[6:48] just want a hamburger same way with God
[6:50] you cannot go back and understand
[6:52] everything about God but he's put
[6:54] something forward enough so that we can
[6:57] understand him so he put it in 66 books
[6:59] so we can carry it around with us
[7:00] because this is the mind of God this is
[7:02] the understanding that we needed
[7:05] every one of you have a favorite
[7:06] scripture right every one of you should
[7:09] have heard a word from the preacher and
[7:11] something pricked your heart like it did
[7:13] on a day of Pentecost right well now
[7:15] what God did before the foundation of
[7:17] the world was before the foundation of
[7:19] the world he knew what Peter was going
[7:21] to say
[7:22] he knew what them 3 000 people what
[7:24] would prick their heart more than
[7:26] anything because remember God's infinite
[7:28] he's not finite like we are we go down
[7:31] One path he's infinite he knew what they
[7:34] would need to prick their heart
[7:36] what he let Joel write it
[7:39] way 2 000 years before he put it in
[7:42] Joel's mind the mind of God came to Joel
[7:45] Joel remember what what Peter said Peter
[7:48] said repent be baptized and then he
[7:49] started talking about Jesus right or
[7:51] you're talking about Jesus before he
[7:52] said this is that spoken by the prophet
[7:54] Joel
[7:56] well Joel spoke it but what was it
[7:58] was a mind of God right before the
[8:00] foundation of the world he knew Joel
[8:02] would speak it and what Joel spoke
[8:06] to beat the 3 000 people that's what
[8:09] they needed to prick their heart
[8:10] Ethiopian eunuch he kept reading and he
[8:13] kept reading and he kept reading right
[8:16] okay well something of his understanding
[8:18] that needed to be open well what did God
[8:20] do God can't God can
[8:23] but he doesn't do it that way God could
[8:25] have come straight down to that
[8:26] Ethiopian unit but that's not the way
[8:28] God's plan is God planned life has to
[8:30] come through the body
[8:32] amen all right because that was my
[8:35] question to the people said well there
[8:36] was a seed laying in there I said well
[8:38] what an Ethiopian unit when he why
[8:40] didn't the seed just come alive why do
[8:41] you need Philip all right exactly
[8:45] why did he need Phillip if he was
[8:47] reading and it just quickened and he
[8:49] found out he was
[8:53] that's right
[8:55] but why didn't God just come down to let
[8:57] Ethiopian you know why did he go get
[8:58] Philip send Philip down there
[9:01] why does God have to do that because
[9:02] remember God don't do anything right
[9:05] that he doesn't get results
[9:07] God doesn't do something like we do
[9:08] sometimes we'll do something we go uh we
[9:10] shouldn't have done that right or
[9:12] whatever you know but God doesn't go God
[9:14] doesn't go
[9:16] I didn't see that Ethiopian unit before
[9:18] the world what am I going to do now no
[9:19] God already knew all this he knew what
[9:21] that unit would be reading
[9:24] and by free moral agency he saw the
[9:26] Ethiopian unit reading the Bible
[9:29] so God sent Philip that had the word
[9:33] already quickened in his heart
[9:35] to what
[9:37] to go do what brothers irrigated the
[9:40] water to put some Spirit life on the
[9:43] what that Ethiopian unit was reading
[9:45] that's right because I asked my whole
[9:47] question I Want Somebody explain that to
[9:48] me if he would if the Ethiopian unit was
[9:51] the seed of God why didn't he just Why
[9:53] didn't God just Quicken it while he was
[9:54] standing there exactly he was confused
[9:57] right
[9:58] he was not born again
[10:00] he was confused about when Peter came
[10:03] and expounded the Bible said Peter I
[10:06] mean no I'm sorry Philip expounded on
[10:08] what he was reading then what happened
[10:10] God come and quickened what he had heard
[10:13] through what Philip said
[10:17] right
[10:18] that's why I 100 show me anywhere in the
[10:21] Bible that somebody got the new birth or
[10:24] the Holy Ghost fell on them before they
[10:26] heard the word
[10:28] cannot happen you can't quit that's why
[10:30] brother random says you can't Quicken
[10:32] non-see
[10:33] all right
[10:36] you can't quit the non-state
[10:39] there's nothing there to Quicken
[10:41] but God knowing that you'd be reading
[10:43] Genesis 1 26.
[10:46] and I go that's me Lord that's me that's
[10:49] where you began
[10:52] not where you begin but when I began to
[10:54] understand who you really are
[10:57] that's where and so you know what God
[10:59] knew that I'd be thinking that
[11:01] so before the foundation of the world
[11:02] when he was back here still had the same
[11:04] attribute
[11:06] because the logos is a speech so he sent
[11:08] the logos down and had Moses
[11:12] right Moses wrote Genesis so he had
[11:15] Moses write that down
[11:17] he had John write this scripture
[11:21] I hope you realize things like that I
[11:23] hope you realize there that there's how
[11:26] many millions and billions of sermons
[11:28] has been preached
[11:30] how many millions let's don't say a bit
[11:32] but how many millions of sermons have
[11:34] been preached from this Bible since it
[11:35] was put in print in the 1500s
[11:39] and even before that because Peter and
[11:41] all of them were actually quoting the
[11:43] Old Testament preaching the gospel Paul
[11:46] was quoting the Old Testament preaching
[11:47] the gospel
[11:49] well you know what you know what if that
[11:50] sermon was from God
[11:53] that's why he put it in the Bible
[11:55] so that you could preach that sermon
[11:58] so that brother Dale could preach
[11:59] whatever scripture he reads today and it
[12:01] quickens in somebody's heart somebody's
[12:02] heart God knew you needed that in the
[12:04] Bible that's my brother Brown said every
[12:06] a and thee everything in this Bible is
[12:08] perfect
[12:10] what one man said it's perfect from
[12:12] cover to cover even the front page says
[12:14] holy
[12:15] okay
[12:18] all right but that's what God did so
[12:20] this word is is not to be tampered with
[12:23] because to me this is the mind of God
[12:25] this is what we need
[12:27] on this side of Eternity you know in
[12:29] this in this Dimension this is what we
[12:30] need to put everything back together
[12:34] we didn't need a book of The Maccabees
[12:36] right we didn't eat and they were
[12:38] written we didn't need a uh what they
[12:40] call these a book of Anna as a book of
[12:42] this there's a book of that you can read
[12:44] that if you want to but brother around
[12:46] said this is God's word that's right
[12:49] this is God's thoughts expressed in just
[12:53] 66 books
[12:55] sick but in 66 bucks look how many
[12:58] sermons even false
[13:00] has been preached from this right here
[13:03] all over the world today somebody's
[13:05] going to take a text out of this and
[13:07] preach right and if it's the word of God
[13:09] and if it quickens to somebody's heart
[13:11] and somebody grows up in the Statue of a
[13:13] perfect manner if somebody gets saved
[13:14] guess what that's why God put it in
[13:16] there
[13:17] everybody get that
[13:19] that's why I love that you you love the
[13:22] continuity of God that's one thing for
[13:25] sure
[13:26] if God puts his stamp on this
[13:29] okay and we know this is the love letter
[13:31] because remember
[13:33] Here We Go Again McDonald's great big
[13:36] huge volumes to tell every pickle and
[13:38] every ounce of juice and every ounce of
[13:40] Coca-Cola it'd be volumes enough right
[13:43] and same with this if God
[13:46] would have written every sermon that
[13:48] come out of here that was true
[13:49] if he had written it in here
[13:52] this room couldn't hold the book right
[13:55] yeah but it's a love letter remember
[13:58] between the lines there's those millions
[14:01] and billions of of quickening of the
[14:04] word
[14:05] that's God to me that's the mind of God
[14:08] the mind of God puts a puts in the
[14:11] beginning was the word and word was with
[14:13] God and the Word was gone you got a
[14:14] prophet comes along says in the
[14:16] beginning was the logos
[14:18] as a low golfers with God and then he
[14:21] starts explaining the Logan well then
[14:23] you know what this is the way I think
[14:26] the only way for us to understand God Is
[14:29] by that scripture being right there
[14:31] if you took that scripture out yeah yeah
[14:34] right come on if you took that scripture
[14:37] out and God didn't write that in the
[14:39] word any of these any of this if he
[14:42] didn't write that you wouldn't
[14:43] understand the Loca that's right now we
[14:46] understand in the beginning was the
[14:47] logos of the word the speech whatever
[14:49] God was going to say he's already said
[14:52] right right he said it it's done but I
[14:55] want his man done man's Twisted it and
[14:57] turned it into all different things
[14:58] right and God has let us ignorantly do
[15:01] that
[15:03] but in the end time let's think about
[15:05] that this morning in the end time though
[15:08] we look back
[15:11] at all the denominations and false
[15:14] teachings
[15:15] there's a truth in there somewhere right
[15:18] and that truth has come through every
[15:20] age even with Martin Luther there's a
[15:22] truth but you and I can't smoke a pipe
[15:27] and drink a beer and be in this age
[15:29] right right Martin Luther could do that
[15:32] because what what happened was is what
[15:34] false teaching
[15:37] right amen false teaching but now we
[15:40] don't to me brother random when he come
[15:42] he he you know the book's open now so
[15:44] there's no way that uh even Paul you
[15:48] know he looked through a glass dark
[15:49] because brother Brown explained that
[15:50] very well he's talking about a fence you
[15:53] know he said there's a circus on the
[15:54] other side of the fence he said I'm a
[15:55] little short guy he said maybe somebody
[15:57] can look through the knot hole well if
[15:59] you look through a knot hole you're not
[16:01] going to be able to see but a certain
[16:03] part
[16:04] of the circus or the word right but that
[16:07] doesn't mean that whole surface is not
[16:09] there going on they got elephants and
[16:11] big tents and and uh wheel you know a
[16:14] big uh Ferris wheels but if you only can
[16:16] see that much you're seeing part of the
[16:18] circle it's the true circus yeah but
[16:22] you're only seeing a part of it what
[16:23] brother Ramsay but now if I got on
[16:25] somebody's shoulders right and looked
[16:28] over the fence he said there's the whole
[16:30] circus well see that's why in the end
[16:32] time they took him he was talking about
[16:33] himself he really was but he's talking
[16:36] about God in him doing it knowing that
[16:38] we needed somebody to go on top of the
[16:40] fence somebody like said the eagle it
[16:42] goes up and can see in every direction
[16:44] okay that's so beautiful what God now
[16:48] the lion Ops man and eagle
[16:50] remember the lion he's very strong
[16:53] right
[16:55] very strong powerful
[16:57] but he can only see past if the grass is
[16:59] this much taller than the lion's head he
[17:01] can't see no further than that no matter
[17:02] how powerful he is no matter how
[17:05] powerful that word was in the first days
[17:06] they only could see this far
[17:08] above you know right if they were
[17:10] walking through the grass
[17:11] they couldn't see right all right but
[17:14] now the ox is a little bit taller but
[17:17] he's not as powerful as far as ferocious
[17:19] but he's powerful pulling
[17:22] and he can see a little bit further
[17:23] because he can see above the grass but
[17:25] he can't see past the trees
[17:27] or even the horizon all right the man
[17:30] the man's caller he's intelligent
[17:33] he can he can say well I can't see that
[17:35] far but maybe I can climb up on a tree
[17:37] something artificial you can climb up on
[17:39] a tree and that's what Martin Luther he
[17:41] didn't have an artificial Doctrine right
[17:43] right Luther didn't have an artificial
[17:45] Doctrine but part of what he saw was
[17:47] artificial because there was no father
[17:49] son Holy Ghost baptism in the Bible but
[17:51] yet he taught that so that was the part
[17:53] that God said okay I'm going to wink at
[17:55] that but the intelligence of man allowed
[17:58] him to see a little bit further and then
[18:00] now what does this say this is the eagle
[18:01] age
[18:03] no limitations that eagle can get up so
[18:05] high he can see that way that way that
[18:07] way and back behind him right so that's
[18:09] why we have the eagle anointing and you
[18:11] and I
[18:12] as as what brother Brown called us
[18:15] eaglets
[18:16] brother Brown's not the only one that
[18:18] can look over the fence now
[18:20] all right exactly sorry
[18:24] now we might be on his shoulders looking
[18:26] over the fence all right but he wasn't
[18:29] the only one and you know what nobody
[18:31] knocked him off of it either
[18:33] he he was able to get up there and say
[18:36] this is what the circus is this is I can
[18:38] see it all and then what he was saying
[18:40] was was come on up here where I'm at
[18:42] right okay come on up here where I'm at
[18:45] and you can see
[18:47] the same things that I see now listen
[18:49] we're not prophets but we are we do have
[18:52] a prophetic message and to preach a
[18:54] prophetic message you got to be
[18:56] prophetic right you got to be up you got
[18:58] to be in a prophetic
[19:01] ministering I'm talking about the whole
[19:04] any ministry that's true is a prophetic
[19:05] mission
[19:06] it's a prophet he can see further and
[19:09] I've always said the reason that brother
[19:10] Brown he said let's go back in the back
[19:12] from part of God's mind
[19:14] is that God allowed him into a place
[19:17] like I said we can see but like I said
[19:20] he he didn't say I'm going back in the
[19:22] back part of God's mind he said let's
[19:25] let's
[19:26] he opened the door let's go back into
[19:29] the back part of God's mind in other
[19:30] words come on with me
[19:32] because remember if he went up into the
[19:34] mind of God
[19:36] and he's the only one that did
[19:38] that we can't even understand what he
[19:39] says
[19:41] right right
[19:43] we've got to come into that Mind Of God
[19:45] that's why this this here this son of
[19:49] God logoth
[19:51] to me covers everything because that
[19:54] logos was standing in eternity
[19:56] and he's the one that did the speaking
[19:58] so he had the intelligence not that God
[20:01] wasn't intelligent he just dropped down
[20:02] into the form to where you are
[20:04] intelligence can understand that
[20:07] all right
[20:08] then what we do is we take the book and
[20:10] we read between the lines and we see
[20:12] exactly what he's talking about because
[20:13] remember
[20:16] God said a lot of things in the Bible to
[20:18] confuse the wise Intruder right that's
[20:20] what the scripture says all right uh
[20:23] when he was standing there I said eat my
[20:24] flesh and drink my blood I mean you know
[20:26] you get up and you start preaching a
[20:27] sermon and this guy gets up and he says
[20:29] you got to eat my flesh and drink my
[20:30] blood you're this man
[20:32] he lost out the door
[20:35] you're going wait a minute
[20:38] but the problem with those people they
[20:41] didn't have the mind of God they had the
[20:44] mind of intellect of a man right
[20:46] got that they had the carnal mind of the
[20:49] intellect of man now I believe when
[20:53] Peter and Paul
[20:55] got born again
[20:57] they saw that and said that's communion
[21:02] yeah the flesh
[21:04] and the blood the wine and the wafer not
[21:07] the wafer like the Catholic said but the
[21:09] wine and the bread because that's what
[21:11] Jesus said he summed it all up that
[21:13] night at the at the Last Supper he said
[21:16] this is my body
[21:18] that's been broken for you well what was
[21:20] he saying eat my flesh
[21:22] in his body his flesh yes okay but you
[21:25] know literally then he says this is my
[21:27] body which is broken for you this is my
[21:29] blood which so he was telling them the
[21:31] same thing he said it was just then a
[21:34] revelation a higher revelation
[21:36] when he was out there among the people
[21:38] he said eat my flesh and drink my blood
[21:39] walked off when he got in the upper room
[21:42] with the disciples that was going to
[21:43] take this Revelation to the other
[21:46] Christian after Jesus left he had to
[21:50] explain it a little bit better but
[21:51] remember I've always said before
[21:53] Peter was there James John all those
[21:56] people were there
[21:57] but not one of them explained it in the
[22:00] scripture
[22:01] Paul was not there
[22:04] he said I have received of the Lord
[22:09] what happened on that night I have
[22:11] arrested why Paul was he was a prophet
[22:14] he could go up a little bit higher and
[22:17] see what even what Peter and then Peter
[22:19] were sitting there
[22:21] when he said that and I'm sure it
[22:23] quickened to a degree to Peter but Paul
[22:25] had the perfect understanding yeah Paul
[22:28] said I have received the Lord that which
[22:30] you know in other words that which they
[22:31] did that night I'm going to explain to
[22:33] you what they've done
[22:35] Jesus Took bread and said this is my
[22:38] body which is broken for you this is my
[22:40] blood you just do in remembrance of me
[22:42] so it was explained by what Paul with
[22:45] the new birth now Paul that was running
[22:46] around having Christians put in prison
[22:49] he didn't understand that
[22:52] but when Paul was born again
[22:55] he probably had listen I he probably was
[22:58] sitting in a sermon one day because
[23:00] remember there was no written
[23:02] there was no battle
[23:04] remember there was no Bible
[23:06] in Paul's age Paul was writing the Bible
[23:08] Peter was writing the Bible each one was
[23:10] writing the Bible but it wasn't
[23:12] correlated it's where Paul could sit
[23:14] down only the Old Testament
[23:17] so Paul could but see he may have sat in
[23:20] a sermon one day and Peter said you know
[23:21] who lives in the upper room
[23:25] Jesus said this is my blood
[23:27] what you said for you because of that
[23:29] communion remember the Bible says the
[23:31] the disciples had communion after the
[23:34] day of Pentecost they had communion
[23:35] together all right so what he was doing
[23:37] was but see it might not it wasn't
[23:40] revealed to Peter to write it down it
[23:42] was revealed to Paul to write in the
[23:44] book of Corinthians so that we can
[23:46] understand it more Peter may have been a
[23:48] little more crude kind of like me you
[23:49] know Peter was a little crude guy but
[23:51] Paul was able to explain it because
[23:53] remember
[23:55] remember
[23:57] if Paul wrote it in the Bible
[24:00] and it's in the word of God
[24:02] somebody needed that right
[24:06] in that way and that form that it was
[24:08] spoken they needed it that way not the
[24:10] way Peter had been preaching for
[24:12] probably 10 or 15 years Peter would
[24:14] probably preach him we gotta take
[24:15] communion Jesus City to eat my flesh and
[24:17] he might have never said eat my flesh
[24:19] and drink my blood but he might have
[24:20] said
[24:21] Jesus said for us to break bread and
[24:22] drink wine
[24:23] as a communion and Remembrance and Peter
[24:27] is struck him one day and he said
[24:30] that's what Jesus was talking about
[24:32] so he took to the Corinthians and he
[24:36] penned
[24:39] I have received of the Lord what the
[24:40] Lord revealed to him right what was
[24:42] going on but now remember like I said
[24:44] Peter probably preached it to a lot of
[24:46] people
[24:47] but God said well Peter you're not
[24:49] saying it in the right way you're using
[24:50] a lot of your a lot of your words but
[24:52] Paul I'm gonna put that in here because
[24:55] that's the perfect
[24:56] way to say it yeah because remember you
[24:59] say well well sometimes I don't
[25:00] understand listen you gotta you gotta
[25:02] remember one thing
[25:05] this is what God Said
[25:07] and this is what people get salvation
[25:09] from not from an interpretation of this
[25:13] but sure when the between the line part
[25:17] but not another written interpretation
[25:19] it's not another written bible somewhere
[25:22] else like the Mormons have another you
[25:24] know another Bible or another revelation
[25:26] of Jesus Christ I thought there was only
[25:27] one revelation
[25:29] hey man I just want to ask him one time
[25:32] I said look
[25:33] I had two girls that were Mormon
[25:36] I said that's your Bible they gave me
[25:38] one I got one at home somewhere and it's
[25:41] another revelation of Jesus Christ
[25:42] that's what it says and I said how many
[25:44] times because I knew that the thing had
[25:46] been changed since Joseph Smith
[25:48] supposedly got these golden tablets like
[25:51] Moses did he supposedly got these
[25:53] tablets and this Angel Moroni came and
[25:56] and when I turned the Bible open the
[25:58] first thing it says it says John Smith
[26:01] was met by Jesus and God both
[26:03] okay
[26:06] so I knew then I said well it's false
[26:09] from here on further
[26:11] from right there forward I don't I don't
[26:14] have to read this if God and Jesus
[26:16] appeared to one guy
[26:20] I wasn't gonna say no more but I did I
[26:22] asked him I said look how many times has
[26:23] that thing been changed
[26:25] been changed like 1100 times since it
[26:27] was written and just in the 18 or 1700s
[26:30] been changed because what they evolved
[26:33] when they see something different
[26:34] because remember they thought they won
[26:35] the 144 pounds
[26:37] so once they grew to 145 000 they said
[26:40] we've got to change their Doctrine
[26:42] there's more of us
[26:45] but remember Joseph Smith brother Robert
[26:47] never say anything about about him
[26:49] he said the Methodist will give an
[26:51] account for killing him because imagine
[26:52] this is the ones that killed Joseph
[26:53] Smith they shot him on his way out to to
[26:56] where they were going to
[26:58] Utah or wherever they Salt Lake City
[27:00] that's why Brigham Young took over when
[27:02] they shot Joseph Smith and killed him he
[27:04] said they'll have to give an account for
[27:05] that but Joseph Smith in his mind he
[27:08] read the Bible and he said
[27:10] that's 144 000. well they probably
[27:12] wouldn't but a hundred it's that time he
[27:14] thought man we get 144 pounds we want to
[27:16] go in the Raptor they gotta kept going
[27:18] he kept going to 145 000 and they had to
[27:20] change it well that's not who we are
[27:22] we're not the 144 now so you see their
[27:25] their Bible evolved
[27:30] see
[27:31] God don't evolve to us
[27:35] we have to evolve to him
[27:37] right what they were doing they were
[27:39] evolved they were taking God and saying
[27:41] no God didn't really mean that he meant
[27:42] this
[27:43] you know but no you take this I told him
[27:46] I said look this thing's not been
[27:47] changed
[27:49] and I said this is where I got my
[27:50] salvation from I don't need another
[27:51] revelation of Jesus and and gone both
[27:54] standing at the same time
[27:56] I don't need it all right but this is
[27:58] all I need this is where I got mine from
[28:00] sure it's nice to read all these other
[28:02] things but there's no quickening power
[28:03] behind it no quickening power behind
[28:06] anything but the word of God everybody
[28:07] got that so that's where that's where I
[28:09] believe that this Son of God the logos
[28:11] is so important because it's the
[28:13] beginning
[28:14] it's the parts you can understand the
[28:16] part we can all understand
[28:18] because remember if an illiterate person
[28:22] can receive the new birth
[28:24] now you literal person can't read
[28:29] but blessed is he that here
[28:34] so you can hear the word of God you can
[28:36] hear a preacher and never been able to
[28:38] read that but what's he saying to you
[28:40] he's saying what's in here
[28:42] right he's saying what's in here and
[28:44] when he says what's in there and
[28:46] somebody says
[28:48] like I said for Harry rock that ain't
[28:49] nothing but the truth now Harry's name
[28:51] wasn't in the Bible
[28:52] Hattie Rock's kids what name of the name
[28:54] wasn't in the Bible
[28:55] but
[28:57] ask anything in my name yeah say to this
[29:00] mountain be moved say to this mountain
[29:03] because brother Brown said whatever you
[29:04] say you know what I'm saying he didn't
[29:05] say say it to me and I'll say it he said
[29:07] whatever you say
[29:09] he said she could have asked for a
[29:12] million dollars and God would have
[29:13] filled that table with a million dollars
[29:18] right she had entered into a wall that
[29:21] God said whenever you asked
[29:24] and then he went on further and said
[29:26] whatever you say
[29:28] to this man if you say to this Mountain
[29:30] Bee move because he broke around he
[29:32] moved to that he said I couldn't really
[29:34] understand he said whatever you say
[29:35] because God told him said what do you
[29:38] want he said well I'm hunting squirrel
[29:42] and I believe brother roundman is in his
[29:44] Humanity he was waiting on God to say
[29:45] well
[29:46] let there be because that's the man that
[29:49] created he said let there be
[29:51] and God said
[29:53] I'm waiting on you yeah but what was it
[29:57] it was the mind of God being transmitted
[29:59] to a man
[30:00] right
[30:02] and I don't think he was so special I
[30:05] think he was the first fruit he was the
[30:06] one that's that that God could show that
[30:09] you could do that through a human voice
[30:11] but you and I have the same abilities
[30:13] what I'm trying to get saved you and I
[30:15] have that same ability
[30:17] because if the Creator lives in you that
[30:19] makes you a program said we were a
[30:20] little creative but you're only a little
[30:23] Creator when the Creator's in you you
[30:25] can't be a little Creator when that's
[30:26] not in you because remember this is what
[30:29] this is the creator
[30:33] this right here created all things
[30:37] amen
[30:39] the Son of God the logos was the creator
[30:42] because he said what let there be let
[30:45] there be let there be now remember
[30:49] when the son of man came on the earth
[30:52] and we'll get back to this in a little
[30:53] bit we're going to stay with the Son of
[30:54] God for a little while the son of man
[30:58] never created
[31:01] while he was on earth now remember the
[31:04] Creator was in this man but he never you
[31:06] know there was even in the book of
[31:08] Maccabees that's my brother around said
[31:09] it was wrong the book of Maccabees is
[31:11] just a historical view of what went on
[31:13] when Jesus was there but they said to
[31:15] Jesus one time it was reported that he
[31:18] threw some sand up in the air and birds
[31:20] flew out
[31:22] if it's not in the word I ain't gonna
[31:24] believe it okay so what I'm saying is is
[31:27] the creator was in the son of man but
[31:29] his but his dispensation and his order
[31:32] was was to be an Earthly man
[31:35] anybody got that that's why I said Son
[31:37] of Man
[31:39] Son of God is his spirit this is Spirit
[31:41] here right right
[31:45] this is Spirit God
[31:48] this is we're going to put some flesh on
[31:50] him down here but remember
[31:52] when he was here on Earth he always used
[31:54] the word or something that was already
[31:57] there
[31:58] that's right
[32:00] sure
[32:01] the creative power went through the
[32:03] bread and the fish but he didn't create
[32:06] the bread
[32:08] and then feed the five thousand he took
[32:10] something that was already there because
[32:11] he was a son of man so he took something
[32:14] that man had already done
[32:17] all right
[32:19] same way with us he took something that
[32:21] man had already made
[32:23] now the creative power began to like
[32:26] brother Brown said watch cell broke when
[32:28] he handed that bread to the disciples
[32:30] and it was probably it was probably went
[32:33] from cold to warm you know when he was
[32:36] creating that bread shirt but he took
[32:38] something that was already there
[32:40] okay same thing with you and I when he
[32:43] creates in us a clean heart and all
[32:45] these things we're talking about
[32:45] creating it's the same bread
[32:49] same bread you got it yeah yeah but God
[32:52] by creative power what breaks his word
[32:55] to you and I
[32:57] and this doesn't get bigger
[32:59] this doesn't get more honorable
[33:03] right brother Dale's been telling us
[33:05] stuff five outside senses has zero to do
[33:08] with anything
[33:10] it's just something to hold you together
[33:13] honestly to hold all your organs
[33:15] together
[33:17] and your brain and all that stuff it
[33:19] just it holds you together on Earth
[33:22] because you think that my my soul if I
[33:25] was to die today you didn't have to have
[33:27] to open the door to get my soul out
[33:31] passes into another dimension right but
[33:33] now
[33:36] that can go
[33:39] but remember when you come from here to
[33:42] here back to here
[33:44] that man had Flash
[33:46] and he went right on through we just
[33:48] need to step right on there I don't
[33:49] think he even hesitated because look if
[33:51] you hesitate
[33:53] there's fear right amen Jesus didn't go
[33:58] well maybe no he just went right on
[34:02] through that wall he had the power
[34:03] remember he said all power and Heaven
[34:05] and Earth has been given unto me heaven
[34:06] and earth
[34:07] foreign
[34:08] we'll get into that because because
[34:10] there is a difference between these
[34:12] three
[34:13] but the only difference is is mine and
[34:16] your understanding not God
[34:19] 's not different he's the same
[34:22] but in our understanding of the
[34:24] development into our brain and from the
[34:27] Bible
[34:28] we have to come from and know that God
[34:31] is the spirit that's what Jesus said God
[34:33] is your spirit and that it works to be
[34:34] much worship me spirit and in truth
[34:36] right but it's not a spirit like a like
[34:38] a
[34:40] just like a sheet you know when we as
[34:42] humans when we think of spirit the first
[34:44] thing you think about I do is like
[34:46] Casper the Friendly Ghost something's
[34:47] floating by and a white sheet you know
[34:49] just floating here floating there you
[34:52] know we gotta no God's a man
[34:57] because we were created in His image up
[34:58] here not down here
[35:00] you understand that we were created in a
[35:03] damage when he was in the logos form
[35:05] right right so that logos form was like
[35:08] was a man a human being
[35:14] if not we if not we weren't made any
[35:17] damage right and we'll get into
[35:20] something when we come down to the son
[35:21] of man because it was asking me it's
[35:23] just something to think about and we'll
[35:24] go something to think about a a certain
[35:27] person asked me one time said well why
[35:29] were we put in this form
[35:32] flesh with with
[35:35] um we're all human I mean all adults
[35:37] with with our organs with our sex organ
[35:39] you know why when we created this way if
[35:41] this is not the way we were supposed to
[35:42] be remember brother Brown said when you
[35:45] move that 126 man into the 2-7 man we'll
[35:48] read it because I read it another day
[35:50] he said that's animal flesh
[35:52] this is a higher form of this was the in
[35:56] in Creative Evolution this is where God
[35:58] stopped right here but if the if the
[36:02] chain of evolution Creative Evolution
[36:04] was that there were male and female dogs
[36:06] with their fleshly organs you understand
[36:09] what I'm saying rest and private part
[36:12] then when God put that 126 man into the
[36:15] 2-7 man there was Adam sure they were
[36:18] naked they were covered by Holy Ghost
[36:20] Veil to where Adam didn't have a lustful
[36:23] Spirit even didn't have a lustable
[36:25] spirit but you know what they can do
[36:26] they can stand and watch all those
[36:28] animals because they were procreated
[36:30] there's nothing wrong with an animal
[36:32] procreating because if they didn't
[36:34] listen somebody said one time said how
[36:36] do you know that they were procreating I
[36:38] said one thing for sure
[36:40] God
[36:42] took
[36:43] this and killed I took him to the court
[36:46] where brother Brown said God killed the
[36:48] animal
[36:50] the lamb threw the skins in I said now
[36:53] if I'd been the only two animals
[36:55] the only two Lambs there's no more lamb
[36:58] right because remember God was finished
[37:00] creating right right so they were all
[37:03] procreating before all this was going on
[37:06] okay so there's nothing wrong with
[37:08] procreation but God but you'll realize
[37:11] one thing soul that soul of man is
[37:14] different from the animal the animal can
[37:16] walk down this road they can they can
[37:18] mate right out here and you go well
[37:19] that's wonderful they're gonna have
[37:20] puppies
[37:21] all right now if a man and a woman went
[37:24] out there and did that what you do you'd
[37:25] call law
[37:28] same Act
[37:31] right man goes walking naked through
[37:33] Walmart
[37:34] they take him to the jail you take a dog
[37:37] a male dog through there and you
[37:38] understand what a no man you make a male
[37:39] dog through there and there's this part
[37:40] hanging everywhere and you go all your
[37:42] beautiful little dog you play you don't
[37:43] think nothing about that wine our carnal
[37:46] mind is what killed us all right it's
[37:49] the difference of the Soul God put a
[37:51] soul in a man
[37:53] to no rap or wrong that animal don't
[37:55] know right from wrong that's right but
[37:57] that's the way God created them people
[37:58] so we have to deal let them deal with
[38:00] that
[38:01] right remarriaging divorce brother Man's
[38:04] real clear you know they just were there
[38:05] just for the puppies and there's no you
[38:07] know there's no shame right I mean in
[38:09] that crew you watch them you watch them
[38:11] mate and you go well that's beautiful

[39:00] probably thousands of years naked and
[39:02] nothing happened
