========================================

all right good morning good Easter morning to everybody I'm the pastor's wife and I take care of excuse sit down I got my new dress so I come in late yeah so you can show off your new dress yeah it yeah she's the pastor wife oh next week everybody else have one that's right that one just like it all right Revelation chapter 6 and for those of you that are here for the first time bless your heart thanks for coming we uh we missing somebody your wife your wife June's coming out she oh wait till she gets here yeah yeah leave it down thank you all right Revelations chap 6 you're on the Lord's time now not mine now what we're doing down in the class for the past few months is we've been on the uh the breach and now we're going into the first seal and we were talking about last Sunday excuse me a few things that U that we need to cover I want you to keep in mind that there was an actual breaking of a seal then there was an actual spiritual application of that seal and then there was a part that's going to be to the Jews in these seals because the the two prophets that go to Israel are going to break the seals now especially on the six seal brother R said the prophets are those seals so they're going to be on the earth and we are not going to see the literal opening of that seal if you do you missed it right okay if you do you just missed you Miss the Rapture like brother Jim was talking about last night night before last you know these things are going to happen we're going to have a little time of tribulation for ourselves but these things that are that are that the Lord is talking about here in the seals are not going to happen to you and I we're going to be out of here because there's a literal opening of the seal all right you're going to have these plagues you're going to have these things that are going to happen you say what about the white horse rider well see we're going to have to pick through this and I don't for a better word say pick through this and I want we're going to really spend a lot of time on each seal we're going to talk about the horse the power um and last Sunday we were talking about power power was given unto him who given to the devil there is only one power and that's the power of almighty God there is a permitted power that he permits Satan to work in the uh Arena of of being Supernatural cuz he is a supernatural being Satan can pass out Supernatural gifts you can be just as lost as lost can be and have all the supernatural gifts because what Satan was the next man to God he was the worship Angel he knows how to worship he knows how to deceive more than anybody on the face of the Earth all right there's only one person he can't deceive and that's God and if you have him in your heart then you're still going to have a hard time cuz you this fell is going to have a hard time this one you're looking at this sticky guy okay but in these seals says I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see I saw and behold a white horse now remember let's go back to what we were talking about in the breach what is John doing John is a scribe John John is writing what he sees all right the angel told John write these things and send them to the church he didn't say interpret them he said write them he didn't say interpret John does not give an interpretation through all the Book of Revelations this is God actually telling a man what to write down and showing him the symbols of it all right that's why John was so struck when he got to Revelations 10 and he saw those Thunders open and he got started to write it and God said hold on because it wasn't for them it's for us it was for one special group of people right the bride in the end time oh yeah not down through the seven Church ages the bride in this day right here the day that we're in right now that's what you and I are living under is the opening of those Thunders which we are going to see that's the voice of God when God breaks the seal to you so the Thunders is not going to be a public show it's not going to be something that you're going to go outside and see this great big show of of um a worldwide campaign no it's just going to happen in your little everyday life it's going to help you live it's going to help you do things it's going to be that time that you need God and like brother Jim was talking about last night if you need a pork chop God's not going to just give you the pig he going to give you a pork chop cuz when Jesus handed out fish it wasn't raw fish and they had to go cook it that's right something brother Brown said boy what kind of chemical was that that released cuz when Jesus broke that fish it was already cooked and and seasoned and ready to eat so you know we can ask God for things for for animals and and game and stuff but hey sometimes we may need a one of those what they call them in the in the service Mr those meals ready to eat so they ready to eat we may need an M from God so and he'll give it to us you remember there was a brother that that that lived in Atlanta that brother Harris always told about that went to Brother Henry's church that he prayed one time and said said when they open their eyes they was porch out sitting on their on their on their track on the plate so you know brother Harris even leaning you know praying and saying God I don't have enough money I've only got you know $20 or $40 to pay my bills and my bills are $200 and the Lord told him just start counting and he started counting and the 20 started coming he just kept counting till he need $200 now God didn't give him 40 of them he gave him what he needed he didn't give him what he wanted he said he would Supply our needs not our wants okay and I saw when a lamb open one of the seals verse two and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given un him a power a crown was given unto him because hey when we see a crown what's the first thing we think of somebody of of of great stature somebody that's got a great lineage somebody that's you know that some you place a crown this this guy you know that just got married over in England Prince William or one of them you know he hasn't wore the crown yet so he just Prince William but one day when Grandma dies he's the next one in line so guess what one day when they put the crown on top of him he becomes king William all right so Crown a crown was given to this person him okay so it's a person and brother randam you know he we'll go through it a little bit later but he says remember you you can't Crown a spirit you Crown a person him all right and he went forth conquering and to conquer now this white horse that John of course you got to really get in and see and I've been praying that the Lord help me to get into the vision that John saw not to try to be anything special but if I'm going to teach this I need to know exactly what John was you know John was a type of me and you remember one man brother BR said John typed the bride entire bride right from from Ephesian Church age to the Le ofan Church age so John typed all those people all the bride but John is sitting there and he is seeing a scene go across and he sees this man get on this horse and he's riding along and then they there's a crown appears and he sees this white horse ride off and he went forth conquering in and to conquer so John was not seeing this man just riding a horse he said conquering and to conquer so he was watching this guy this person he was watching him do something cuz if you and I were just sitting here and we had a TV screen we just saw a guy stand on a white horse and he just rides and gets to the end of the screen and rides on well you know you couldn't say he was conquering or or conquering or too conquer anything cuz it says conquering and to conquer he's conquering so what John saw was is this person this this this man on this horse riding into maybe a group of people um something because he said conquering and to conquer so he was conquering then and he was going to continue conquering on down Through the Ages all right and who was this person many people in the denominational realm believe that was God because it was a white horse I mean my anybody rides on a white horse ought to be a good guy usually in the in the in the in the old days you the old the the bad guy rode Black Horse and and U Long Ranger rode White Horse right but remember this guy is trying to deceive you I was just thinking he doesn't have his sword yet that's correct it starts as a little saying so that's how he started that's right he started innocent that was that's my next point he started innocent he's on this horse and everybody's going remember John saw this church saw it as a woman and he admired her but she was a let's be honest you prostitutes are not ugly they're usually very beautiful because it's alluring it's something that's trying to trap you something pull you in you know okay so that's what he's going to to Satan is not going to use a secondhand man Satan's on this horse himself okay but the whole the whole of of Christendom down through time thought this guy this person on this horse was some champion and even the prophet he said his he preached a mighty conqueror in 1957 and 1958 he preached a mighty conqueror again he used that scripture right there and said that was the holy ghost riding through conquering what this flesh guy and taking over well that's not true so brother brandham grew in Grace and knowledge he said hisself and we're going to read it cuz you know this brings a lot of people's eyebrows up but let's take and look in the first seal let's turn to the page one in this composite book 104 I mean 105 and it is the first page of the first seal paragraph number four now watch this book was sealed the Bible was sealed up even brother Brandon being a prophet sure he opened a lot of the word but there was a part of that word that nobody had looked into remember talking about last Sunday when he whipped that top off of the off of that pyramid Top Mountain and looked down and he saw those words that was never been seen by man before that's what we're fixing to get into okay first seal page four paragraph four and today I had something to happen that I haven't had for a long time I was studying on this on this Revelation here on the opening of the seal what's he talking about first seal years ago I run through it here about some 20 years ago I guess or something like that but somehow or another I never was just exactly satisfied seemed like there was something some things especially in those seals because those seals are the entire book see it's the book the whole book is one book seal all right now now let's turn over to page 109 actually go to paragraph 36 35 35 paragraph 35 of the first seal all right and now the lamb is standing now tonight as we enter into this sixth chapter he's got the book in his hand and starting to reveal it and oh I would have absolutely today and I hope that people are spiritual remember what brother Jim's been preaching on spiritual right there's a spiritual application to everything I would have had a horrible mistake on that if it hadn't been about 12:00 today when the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that I was writing down to say I was taking it from an old context he was writing down his old notes where he had preached that the that the white horse rider was the holy ghost riding through that first church age which would would have exalted Satan To His Highest position if brother brandham had have stepped out but see God wasn't going to let that happen God needed these seals to be open Pure and unadulterated amen all right so he was protecting not the man he was protecting his gift he was protecting the gift that he given the man because the man brother Brandon many times and I've got Circle it in all these he'll say I don't know I don't have a clue what the next heal is and he did when he when he come to this page right here and he knew right then that all that he had taught was not wrong wrong it was just in a baby form but that Satan had actually blinded his eye he said it himself he would have made a horrible mistake right if he would have preached it the way he preached it in 1957 the mighty conquer 1958 the mighty conquer he would have exalted Satan To His Highest position but being a word prophet he could not do that God was not going to allow that to happen so he come in the room at 12:00 open that seal and then brother ROM knew right then that he was not going to be in the picture that whole week it was going to be God Butz he said if you are spiritual right if you people are spiritual you'll understand what happened well a lot of them that were sitting there thought they were and they weren't cuz you get on over about the uh the U questions and answers and he said this ain't even for you people it's gone from you there's no way for even there there there's no way for you to understand it but he said there'll be a group of people and this is a group of people this is the group that was supposed to understand it we were all born out of what do you see them just like Paul said just like brother R said we born out of due time but no we were born just right when we were supposed to be born because it took 40 something years to get all that old understanding out of our brain and get this not this new way it's the same old gospel that was preached 2,000 years ago by Jesus Christ cuz Jesus Remember in Matthew he preached six seals in Matthew 24 cuz what does he say let's go you need to keep your marker in Matthew and Revelation Matthew 24 first seal is verse 5 of chapter 24 for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many who was that white horse rider now we know let's get the basic now we know that the horse was a symbol of what power a horse is a power a charger something you're right it's got power that's why they call the horse power yes all right and the man that was sitting on this horse something had to be given to him now there's nothing ever had to been given to God right nothing nothing zero God don't learn something new if God don't know it now he never knew it to start with and he's not God but God knew the very the very words I was going to choose today he knew that before this world was even created right in his mind all this was finished we can't comprehend that but that's a God that I like I like one that's in control that knows it's going to happen before it gets here all right and he works the Bible says he works things to his perfect will he'll let it work in permissive will but he always works to his perfect will right so we got a horse saw a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow all right got a bow what else no arrows no arrows sh you say I said what else I don't want to let me teach this class all right now he had a bow with no arrows surprise J when you teach a bunch of people it's already been taught it's kind of hard they know where you going but anyway maybe Lord bring out something that you really didn't know but anyway so he had a bow and watch a crown was what mhm him it was given him given to him power was given so now let's take the natural part of it this man Satan as soon as the resurrection happened which is today today all in chrisom we we uh honor the resurrection of Jesus Christ okay uh there's only one empty tomb I can't explain about e about Enoch and all those but the Bible says that as only one man had reached immortality right that means one time he was a mortal now he is Immortal even Lazarus was raised from the death from the dead out of a grave mortal but he was raised mortal and he died died right okay there's only one man that died a human death raised from that dead and he'll never die no more right and that body that he resurrected in is the same body he walked on the face of the Earth with it was just changed into a new or a younger State younger condition that's why we don't believe at this church that you get a new body I know people teach that I was at a Baptist Church one time when I first started coming back to the Lord I had a friend I was trying to trying to get him to understand the message and he said you come church with me I said okay so anyway the pastor gets finished preaching a real wonderful sermon about um about Samson and the U I just killed an aunt it wasn't my aunt a aunt but uh I he he was preaching a very wonderful sermon about um Samson when he lit those Fox's tails and let him run through the fields you know and it burnt their fields I mean buddy he was he kicked his shoes off he was just an old Baptist but when they got finished outside he went outside but and he lit up a cigarette he smoking one right after the other just coughing up up a storm and and one of the brothers say said Brother Don said said you better quit that smoking said you you know you could kill you you know I mean I can see it just now he he took a big old draw off that cigarette and he said it don't matter I'm going to get me a new body anyway I'm not going to have this one I thought yeah buddy it may be on fire like that is too but Jesus resurrected in the same body that he Resurrection is not replacement okay what went down come back that's right Redemption is not doing something halfway right right no Adam's going to raise in the body he lived in Abraham's going to raise in the body he lived in Jesus raised in the body he lived in it was just made or quickened into a younger condition same way with you and I I don't want a you body I like me okay I don't want to get I want to have a new one where you going to get it from the Bible says we all came out of this Earth and back before it was you know it's tilting like this now but back when it was straight up and down we were here and we were going to come in a perfect condition but when the fall happened knowing the ark and all those things of sin came on the earth you can't take this one CU they said flesh and blood will not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven well flesh and blood that your mom and daddy gave you want right okay but you do have a body and I just believe just as simple as I can believe that we're not going to go to heaven and live eternity and not have blood in our veins or a lungs or or eyes or ears I mean we're not going to be Spooks brother R said we're going to live as human beings cuz when he went across that curtain of time he did not see Casper the Friendly Ghost he saw human beings that he hug and not be no sin involved that just Thrills my heart that just Thrills my heart that you that you know you can you can hug your sister over there and not have a sensation see the only sensation we get is cuz Mom and Daddy bore this body right see that's why it's got to be changed it didn't say exchange it said changed so this body is going to be changed in the morning twinking of night how we got into that I don't have a clue anyway White Horse White Horse is a white righteous looking I mean you look at a white horse and you just think of Purity clean you know you perfect just yeah complete just a something beautiful and and it just brings back in our memory you know Long Ranger and a good guy and all that stuff you know what Satan knew that he didn't start out on a black horse he started out on a white horse he started out to conquer what me and you so the day that Jesus resurrected and ascended and come back on the day of Pentecost and the Holy Ghost the devil came right with him and got on this white righteous horse because John in first John he tells us he said the Antichrist is here and then Paul comes over in his writings and he said Grievious wolves are among you now people had already started infiltrating that church in ad. 60 we were 2,000 years of Satan getting better and better at his tactic but this White Horse was the power the man that was on this horse had a bow now with no arrows brother randam was telling us about this and him being a hunter I'm sure he really thought in his mind I you know I wouldn't have killed that deer brother Jim if I had no arrows I if I just told Brother Jim and brother Jim's the one that we that Dad and I and brother Richard and brother Danny go out to be so gracious to let us not on his property and if I would have went hunting and had bought a thousand that bow I got Hy it's $1,000 the bow the bow all tricked out is $1,000 all right sorry I just like to have the best but anyway it's paid for but you know what if I have got up on that stand and and and and literally bought the best if I'd have spent $10,000 on everything I had bought the license bought the license and everything I mean the license are almost $400 you're spending all this money I'll see yall next week we might not make it to to the church but anyway I'm making a point here if I would have spent all that money and I told Brother Jim he said oh brother way there's a deer right I mean we got trail cameras and that deer just goes by every day and we see that same big buck go by every day and I go climb up in that b stand that we've got you know and brother Jim he goes out and pours out $100 worth of corn and we're I mean we just got this whole thing laid out and here I am standing up there you know and I got my bow ready and here comes the deer without that Arrow that's all that I spent and all that he done is worth zero he moving zero zero all right maybe we shouldn't have used that analogy let's back to tape up start over the point I'm trying to make is is Satan even putting himself on a horse getting him the best bow there is getting him the best anointing he can get he was worthless without those arrows right cuz what are you going to kill you can't kill nothing I mean you might could throw the bow and maybe hit the thing with it but like I was telling Danny brother Danny yesterday buying something to go in the back of his truck like a tun no cover like I got and hey if I'm going to get into this you get into it down with I told him I told him I said you need a bow he said well I need this cover this tunel cover I said well it's one thing for sure with a bow you can kill a deer I said but you might be able to pick that thing up and throw it at it but you won't think you'll hit anything with it I only have a $900 B so now you're in now you're in with me all right let's get back on our point but look at all these things that were given to this person you know what my whole point is Satan is powerless he has no power of himself right he couldn't do it alone thank you he couldn't do it alone next week Trudy will be handling the that's fine yes sir brother Jim we're kind of open here we let everybody talk they said what is what he say he went forth conquering if he didn't have no arrows he was a bluff he went forth to conqueror he was right and power was given to him see and this Crown that's what I was saying about a crown you know if if Prince William goes through life and he's just all nonchalant you know but one day you put a crown on his head everybody turns their attention see so what God had to do God allowed Satan to get these parts together but there was one thing he was missing and that was any power over you if God would have gave him the arrows he could not say to you it was your choice to do what you do right see God give him that's my whole point God give him this right here to work with right so who give it to it he gets his power from the people so now now you have a choice if he would have given Satan arrows you'd have never had a chance that's right he' have killed you to start with yeah but God allowed him not to have any arrows for you to make the choice because you're the guy that goes to the hardware store or to or to Bass Pro Shop and you don't just give him arrows that are crooked you buying the straightest $100 a dozen with a $50 fill point and what and we hand them to him we don't even let him come and get them we go here shoot him at me let mear right and I'm going to stand like this but if if God would to give him see God gives Satan what to work with except for one thing cuz if not there would be no choice that's what I saw when I saw this with no arrows that gave us a choice to give him the arrows or to reject it right and then to reject it then what's he going to do he's going to sit there and go binging going to pull the string back you're going to go the Bible says resist the devil even with all this right here he's sitting on a horse he sitting on a power which was given to him by the people the bow probably was also the crown we crown him Satan Superman remember what brother R called called the devil called the pope Satan Superman well we've got a Superman and we crown him king of kings and Lord of lords all right but he went forth and he was in symol he was going to try to be Christ y that's what he went out to be in that first church age because remember what Jesus said in Matthew he couldn't have done it any other way Matthew 25 says there will be What fault Christ Matthew 24 for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many he started in that first church age Conquering the people brother BR said remember Nick leoism niik was conquer Le was a Le so he went forth Conquering the people but if the people had a had a revelation that's why you and I have to we have to have the revelation of who he is now I'm going to make this statement and it's going to be out on the internet and I want I want to really thank the people that are listening cuz we've got a lot of hits on our Sunday school class which is great it's not me but I'm trying to get a point across to maybe some people that that um that need some teaching and it's hard to do people don't like teachers because they're so boring but to me brother Brown said teachers place you in the body so it places your mind in a place where you can get something from God all right but this was all placed here to deceive you even way back in its little infancy cuz like sister Trudy said as you see this man progress you're going to see he gets a sword now what's a sword then it's word right but it was given all this stuff was given to Satan right but right here you resist the devil and he'll flee from him even in a Christian condition and I'm going to make this statement then we'll they then we'll stop CU I got to go hook brother Jim up with his thing even a born again believer down through the church ages Satan conquered their flesh everybody understand that that's hard to swallow but Satan is the only one that can kill the outside guy remember God's one that can kill the soul Satan can't kill the soul but he or take your outside guy and kill him okay because what we give him the power to do that the power in the people the power in denominational ideas the power in cuz Satan people there's more I'm going to make this statement there's more Devils preaching today than they are true Born Again believer sorry if I hurt your feelings but there's more people in the because of what because of right here it can't be any other way we're at the end time there's no other Church AE to pick this up and take another idea there's no other idea this is it right we either go by the grave or we go to Glory one of the two we don't go to another church age messenger or to another church age all right for many sh many shall come in my name didn't Jesus say fear or not little flock that's right he said right here for many shall come in my my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many many not a few many when Noah preached there was what eight people that was it he preached 120 years to congregations the Bible says that as it was in the days of Noah so it is today so guess what whatever was here today was in Noah's age you say w all this technology you got to remember number one thing the water didn't just wash this Earth off it's proven we're living off of dead plants and animals and people from the flood cuz those plates just flipped over and sat down and all this is way under the part under the Earth they're way up in the ice caps go to Alaska sometime and and they're just awesome I know brother Jim lived up there you see these big glaciers that are 500 ft deep of just nothing but solid ice what happened when the earth turned over on its axis it drew all that to the to the ice cap there's no telling what if ever all that melts you might find cars up there I it wouldn't bother me any if it did cuz the Bible says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be when the days of the son of man the day we're living in right now okay so that's what happened to them I am Christ and shall deceive many now we're going to stay on that for a little while because we're the first seal we're going to continue on for for several more weeks but think about this one thing Satan Satan can deceive many but there's one person he can't deceive and that's the real Christ that's why if you don't have the Holy Ghost in your life or in your soul not just on your life in your soul if you're not a born again believer you're not going to understand because Satan's in there telling you what I yes sir nothing to it it's just something just a FNA say you know he's going to be sitting in there and guess who put him there we did any questions before we go if not next Sunday we'll start on stay on the same thing we'll be on the first seal for a while make sure you bring your books make sure you read that first seal that door in there well we boor in there you came I know they left that door called pulling and all that air conditioner coming through
