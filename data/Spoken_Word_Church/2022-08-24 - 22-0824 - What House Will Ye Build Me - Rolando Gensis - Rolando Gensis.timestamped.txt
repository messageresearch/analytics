[18:08] uh to the ark of the covenant to the ark

[18:14] uh built in uh
[18:16] with curtains
[18:18] in in in samuel chapter seven from verse
[18:22] one to five pieces and it came to pass
[18:25] when the king sat in his house and the
[18:27] lord had given him rest round about from
[18:30] all his enemies
[18:32] the king that the king said unto nathan
[18:34] the prophet see now i dwell in a house

[19:22] and nathan said to the king go the all
[19:25] that is in thine heart for the lord is
[19:27] with thee
[19:29] and it came to pass that night that the
[19:31] word of the lord came unto nathan saying
[19:34] go
[19:35] and tell my servant david that says the
[19:37] lord shalt thou build me and house for
[19:40] me to dwell in
[19:42] and verse 8 he says now therefore so
[19:45] shall
[19:46] thou say unto my servant david that says
[19:48] the lord of hosts
[19:50] i took thee from the ship code from
[19:53] following the ship
[19:54] to be a ruler over my people over israel
[19:59] and
[20:00] i was with the weather server the
[20:02] winters and have cut off all the enemies
[20:06] out of their sight
[20:07] and have made thee a great name
[20:10] like unto the name
[20:12] of the great men that are in the earth
[20:15] amen
[20:16] you know
[20:18] it is good thing to have a desire to do
[20:22] things for god
[20:24] hallelujah
[20:25] and it's a human nature abraham said
[20:27] it's a human nature hallelujah
[20:30] to to make plans uh
[20:33] for the work of the lord amen
[20:35] but we need to consult him first what
[20:38] his perfect will is
[20:40] hallelujah
[20:41] and david one time
[20:43] uh he thought of helping god
[20:46] hallelujah but god said david i don't
[20:50] need your help
[20:52] you are the one who who needs me
[20:54] hallelujah i am the one if you think
[20:56] that you became successful you be uh you
[20:59] were you are a great man
[21:02] ah
[21:03] a mighty man available
[21:06] david it was not you who
[21:08] have done it
[21:09] hallelujah
[21:11] i am the one
[21:13] who fought for you and you are and you
[21:15] are just my instrument
[21:17] hallelujah i am the one who made you
[21:19] great and it is not by your own ability
[21:22] hallelujah
[21:24] and uh
[21:26] and then uh god
[21:28] because of that desire because of uh
[21:33] what's in the heart of david
[21:35] if you read in uh isaiah chapter 66
[21:38] verse 1
[21:40] he says
[21:41] that says the lord the heaven is my
[21:43] throne
[21:44] and the earth is my footstool where is
[21:46] the house that you build me
[21:48] and where is the place of my rest okay
[21:50] david you have a desire to
[21:53] to build a house
[21:54] that i am going to dwell in
[21:58] imagine this david what kind of house
[22:00] are you going to build
[22:02] how big is it
[22:04] hallelujah
[22:06] heaven is my throne
[22:09] and earth is my footstool
[22:12] imagine if he's just
[22:14] if god is just sitting
[22:16] and he's uh sitting his throne is
[22:19] already in heaven
[22:21] and how much more if he will stand
[22:24] so what kind of a house
[22:26] are you going to build me amen
[22:29] hallelujah and what is the place of my
[22:32] rest
[22:33] hallelujah
[22:35] but
[22:37] yet god promised to david that he sinned
[22:41] alleluia the son of david
[22:43] he shall
[22:44] build him a house for his name
[22:48] hallelujah if you read in uh
[22:51] ii samuel chapter 7 verses 12 and 13 it
[22:54] says and when thy days be fulfilled
[22:58] and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i
[23:01] will set up thy seed after thee
[23:04] we shall proceed out of thy bowels and i
[23:06] will establish his kingdom
[23:09] he shall build a house for my name
[23:12] remember
[23:14] they said
[23:16] he shall build a house for my name and i
[23:19] will establish his throne
[23:22] the throne of his kingdom
[23:24] forever
[23:27] but you know brothers and sisters if you
[23:29] will
[23:30] just
[23:33] notice these
[23:34] verses that
[23:36] god promised to david
[23:39] he said
[23:40] hallelujah
[23:42] that he shall build me and house
[23:45] alleluia
[23:46] for my name and i will establish his
[23:49] throne
[23:52] the throne of his kingdom forever
[23:55] but uh i believe
[23:57] this is not the natural
[23:59] seed of david which is which was solomon
[24:03] because uh when god promised something i
[24:06] believe that he will never fail or
[24:10] hallelujah his promise
[24:12] he will establish the throne of his
[24:14] kingdom forever
[24:16] and if we read the bible
[24:18] solomon's kingdom was divided
[24:21] hallelujah
[24:23] in uh uh first kings chapter 11 31 and
[24:26] 32 he says it says and he said to jeruba
[24:30] take thee ten pieces
[24:33] for thus says the lord the god of israel
[24:35] behold i will rent the kingdom out of
[24:38] the head of solomon and will give ten
[24:41] tribes to thee
[24:42] but he shall have neutral uh he shall
[24:45] have one tribe for my servant david
[24:48] sake and for jerusalem's sake the city
[24:51] which i have chosen out of all the
[24:54] tribes of israel and if you read first
[24:56] kings chapter 12 that the kingdom was
[24:58] divided
[25:01] in judah and jeroboam herein the rest of
[25:04] the tribe of judah
[25:06] alleluia
[25:07] what house are you going to build unto
[25:10] me
[25:11] and where is the place of my rest so
[25:15] that's god's question amen hallelujah
[25:19] and
[25:21] as uh we read uh acts chapter 7 verse 47
[25:25] and 49 to 49 but solomon built him a
[25:28] house how big the most high dwelleth not
[25:31] in temples made with hands says the
[25:34] prophet
[25:35] so
[25:37] only now
[25:38] suleiman built him a house
[25:42] but god does not dwell in a house made
[25:45] with hands
[25:47] but the temple that solomon built
[25:49] hallelujah

[25:53] spiritual temple
[25:55] that god is going
[25:57] to build for himself amen

[26:11] or by our frusams hallelujah and he will
[26:15] not god is going to have
[26:19] a temple
[26:20] hallelujah but this is not speaking to
[26:23] the temple that the solomon had built
[26:25] but sulaiman
[26:27] solomon's temple is only a type of the
[26:30] thing that god of the true temple that
[26:32] god is going hallelujah
[26:35] to build hallelujah in isaiah chapter 6

[26:47] where is the
[26:49] house that she built unto me and where
[26:52] is the place of my rest now god is
[26:55] asking a question
[26:57] aliyah what kind of house where is the
[27:00] house that you are going to build for me
[27:03] and
[27:04] where is the place of my rest
[27:06] and then he answered also that question
[27:10] for all those things hot mine had made

[28:04] hebrews chapter 10 verse 5
[28:06] therefore when he cometh into the world
[28:09] he says sacrifice and offering
[28:12] the word is not but a body has now
[28:15] prepared me
[28:17] hallelujah
[28:18] and paul said knowing that that your
[28:20] body is the temple of the holy ghost
[28:23] which is in you which year of god and ye
[28:26] are not of your own amen
[28:28] hallelujah
[28:30] but when he came to the world
[28:32] brabham said
[28:36] when we came to the world
[28:38] alleluia
[28:40] this body paul said this is the temple
[28:43] of the holy ghost
[28:44] but the problem is when we came to the
[28:46] world brahm said we were born in sin
[28:50] shaped in iniquity come to this world
[28:52] speaking lies
[28:54] hallelujah
[28:56] in the ephesians

[29:02] this have to be so
[29:04] why was it had uh why was it that
[29:08] the seed of the serpent must come this
[29:11] way
[29:12] man was created for god
[29:15] man was to be the temple of god
[29:19] the place of god's rest
[29:22] was man the temple hallelujah
[29:25] so
[29:27] god was designed by god oh man was
[29:30] designed by god
[29:32] to be
[29:33] a place of his rest to be a temple of
[29:36] god
[29:37] hallelujah so braver
[29:41] acts chapter 7 from verse 46
[29:44] who found favor before god and decided
[29:46] to find
[29:47] atabirnakel for the god of jacob but
[29:50] sulaimone built him and house howbeit
[29:53] the most high drilleth not
[29:55] in temples made with hands as says the
[29:58] prophet heaven is my throne and there's
[30:00] an earth is my footstool what house will
[30:03] you build me saith the lord or what is
[30:05] the place of my rest
[30:07] had not my hand made all these things
[30:10] he is stiffness
[30:12] and uncircumcised
[30:14] in heart
[30:15] and ears so we know that
[30:18] the circumcision of the heart
[30:20] is
[30:21] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[30:24] it's baptism of the lugos uh it is the
[30:26] spirit of god to dwell in you
[30:29] hallelujah and you were and he was he
[30:31] was pointing to the to the religious
[30:33] people of that of that day you were
[30:36] hallelujah is stiffneck and
[30:39] uncircumcised in the heart and ears
[30:42] you always resist the holy ghost
[30:45] you resist the holy ghost you don't
[30:47] allow the holy ghost as your father did
[30:50] so do ye
[30:51] then he continued he said
[30:53] continued satan has known this all along
[30:59] hallelujah satan knows that man
[31:02] was created by god to be his dwelling
[31:05] place
[31:06] and so
[31:08] and prophet said he also wants him to
[31:11] dwell man even as god so does
[31:15] he knows that god wants
[31:19] a body
[31:20] hallelujah
[31:22] a man to be his dwelling place
[31:25] and satan
[31:26] he also desired that
[31:29] hallelujah
[31:30] that's right but god has reserved to
[31:33] himself that right
[31:35] hallelujah but it is not for him
[31:39] that try to
[31:41] dwell in a man
[31:42] god he only desire he only uh reserved
[31:46] that right for him alone and not for
[31:49] satan hallelujah satan cannot
[31:53] do that
[31:54] god alone appeared in human flesh
[31:57] satan could not and cannot do that
[32:00] he does not have creative powers
[32:03] the only way for satan to accomplish
[32:06] what he wanted to do was to enter the
[32:09] serpent in eden even as he entered
[32:12] by evil spirits into the swine of
[32:15] gaddara
[32:17] then baby said god
[32:19] does not enter animals right
[32:22] it's only satan he entered into
[32:26] the serpent in in the garden in eden and
[32:29] he entered into the swines
[32:31] in gadara
[32:33] hallelujah but god
[32:36] does not enter animals
[32:39] even as he entered by evil spirits into
[32:42] the swine at gadara
[32:44] but satan
[32:45] can and will to accomplish his ends
[32:49] he could not have a child directly by it
[32:51] by abe
[32:54] as did god by mary so he entered into
[32:57] the serpent
[32:58] and then beguiled him
[33:01] he seduced her and by her and by her did
[33:04] satan have a child vicariously amen
[33:08] hallelujah
[33:10] he got a child which is kind
[33:12] can bore the full spiritual
[33:14] characteristics of satan
[33:17] and the animalistic
[33:19] sinful fleshly characteristic
[33:22] of the serpent
[33:23] no wonder the holy s the holy spirit
[33:26] said uh that cain was of that wicked one
[33:29] he was
[33:31] so here is now
[33:34] although uh
[33:35] cain
[33:36] he slow his brother
[33:38] abel but uh
[33:41] god replaced him with with seth
[33:44] and uh said he got the uh his lineage
[33:47] and here is the lineage of said of
[33:50] satan true cain
[33:52] hallelujah through the serpent and
[33:55] that was a cane and he got his children
[33:58] and brahma said
[34:00] satan and the animalistic
[34:03] sinful fleshly characteristic of the
[34:06] serpent
[34:08] animalistic
[34:10] sinful fleshly characteristic of the
[34:12] serpent
[34:13] but the problem
[34:15] when it comes to genesis chapter 6
[34:18] verse one and it came to pass when the
[34:20] ma when men began to multiply of the
[34:23] face of the earth and daughters were
[34:25] born unto them
[34:27] that the sons of god
[34:29] saw the daughters of men that they were
[34:31] fair and they took them wives of all
[34:34] which they chose
[34:36] and then they mingled hallelujah the the
[34:40] the seed of the serpent
[34:42] and
[34:46] the sons of god
[34:48] they mingle together
[34:50] and then
[34:51] in verse 3
[34:52] and god said
[34:54] my spirit shall not always strive with
[34:57] man
[34:58] hallelujah
[35:02] through the first creation we inherited
[35:05] that the rebrand said
[35:07] we became animalistic
[35:09] we we have that characteristic
[35:11] hallelujah animalistic sinful fleshly
[35:14] characteristic of the serpent
[35:16] and because of that brevan said that god
[35:20] do not enter into animals
[35:24] alleluia
[35:25] only the evil spirit
[35:27] he entered into animal
[35:29] into the serpent into the swine of
[35:31] gadara
[35:33] and through our first birth
[35:36] brevard said that
[35:38] hallelujah and book of psalms david said
[35:41] in psalms 51 verse 5 behold i was
[35:44] shaping in iniquity and in sin did my
[35:47] mother conceive me
[35:50] abraham said i was born in sin
[35:52] shape in iniquity come to this world
[35:54] speaking lies
[35:56] and
[35:57] paul said in romans chapter 3 verse 10
[35:59] to 12 as it is written there is none
[36:02] righteous no not one
[36:04] there is none that understand it there
[36:06] is none that seeketh after god there is
[36:09] they are all gone out of the way they
[36:12] are all together become unprofitable
[36:16] we became all of us became unprofitable
[36:19] there is none that do with good although
[36:22] we think that we are righteous we are
[36:25] doing good yeah but the the bible says
[36:28] that our righteousness is like filthy
[36:30] rugs
[36:31] hallelujah and we are unprofitable
[36:35] we we were designed to be
[36:38] by god to be his willing place to be his
[36:40] temple
[36:42] but because obscene
[36:44] hallelujah
[36:45] we became unprofitable amen but praise
[36:49] the lord hallelujah down inside of us
[36:52] there is a there is a sin predestinated
[36:55] before the foundation of the world
[36:57] we are predestinated to be a part of his
[36:59] plan a part of that body
[37:02] his dwelling place
[37:04] alleluias ephesians 1 4-11
[37:08] according as he had chosen us in him
[37:10] before the foundation of the world that
[37:12] we should be holy and without blame
[37:14] before him in love
[37:15] having predestinated us unto the
[37:18] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[37:20] himself according to the good pleasure
[37:22] of his will
[37:24] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[37:26] wherein he had made us acceptable
[37:28] accepted in the beloved
[37:30] in home we have produced a redemption
[37:33] through his blood
[37:34] redemption through his blood the
[37:37] forgiveness of sins according to the
[37:39] riches of his grace
[37:41] wherein he had abundant toward us in all
[37:44] wisdom and prudence
[37:46] having made known unto us the mystery of
[37:48] his will
[37:50] according to his good pleasure which he
[37:53] had purposed in himself amen hallelujah
[37:56] he had purpose in himself
[37:59] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[38:01] of times he might gather together in one
[38:05] all things in christ both which are in
[38:07] heaven and which are on earth even in
[38:09] him
[38:10] in whom also we have obtained an
[38:13] inheritance
[38:15] being predestinated according to the
[38:17] purpose of him who worketh who worketh
[38:20] all things after
[38:21] the council of his own will
[38:24] hallelujah
[38:25] and praise the lord by the process of
[38:28] that new birth
[38:30] hallelujah
[38:32] by
[38:33] justification amen and by
[38:36] cleansing us sanctification
[38:39] and then filling us with the holy ghost
[38:42] hallelujah we became
[38:44] part of that body amen hallelujah
[38:47] and uh first corinthians
[38:49] 13
[38:51] uh paul said that by one spirit amen
[38:53] which is the baptism of the holy spirit
[38:56] by one spirit are we all baptized into
[39:00] one body hallelujah
[39:02] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[39:04] we be banned or free and have been all
[39:08] made to drink into one spirit
[39:11] by one spirit
[39:13] hallelujah of course before god baptizes
[39:16] us allelia with that one spirit we we
[39:20] went through
[39:21] justification
[39:23] and sanctification and then the last
[39:26] process is by the baptism of the holy
[39:29] ghost
[39:29] and then we become we became a part of
[39:32] that body amen hallelujah
[39:35] and
[39:36] whose body is that
[39:38] alleluia it is the body of jesus christ
[39:41] hallelujah we become a part of that body
[39:44] of jesus christ
[39:45] hallelujah which is uh
[39:48] the bible
[39:50] uh it says a new creation
[39:53] hallelujah that's why if uh when we were
[39:56] baptized into that body and become a
[39:58] part of that body
[40:00] we were in christ hallelujah second
[40:02] corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore
[40:04] if any man be in christ
[40:06] he is a new
[40:08] creature our
[40:11] the all things hallelujah
[40:14] are passed away
[40:16] behold all things are become new
[40:20] and uh revelation chapter
[40:22] 3 14 that jesus christ is the beginning
[40:26] of that creation amen although the first
[40:29] creation
[40:30] it was ruined it was marred by by satan
[40:34] hallelujah in the garden of eden
[40:37] the first creation and we became
[40:39] unprofitable but praise the lord
[40:41] hallelujah
[40:43] amen
[40:45] new creation
[40:48] that's why no wonder that when
[40:55] the first temple
[40:56] alleluia
[40:58] although it was glorious but because of
[41:00] you know
[41:01] even solomon himself he backslid
[41:04] hallelujah
[41:19] the temple
[41:21] and then it was
[41:22] ah rebuilt again hallelujah and uh
[41:26] in in haggai
[41:28] uh chapter two i think uh verse nine
[41:31] that
[41:31] the the second temple the
[41:34] the second house
[41:36] would be glorious
[41:38] than the other one hallelujah that's why
[41:40] brothers and sisters uh the first
[41:42] creation it was because of sin
[41:46] because of unbelief it was destroyed
[41:49] hallelujah but by the second creation
[41:52] this
[41:53] then the second or the new creation the
[41:56] new temple hallelujah will be most will
[41:59] be more glorious
[42:01] hallelujah
[42:02] so they are just uh types brothers and
[42:05] sisters
[42:06] and in the mirrors of the lamb
[42:08] 1962 he says all that god was
[42:12] he poured into christ
[42:14] and all that christ was he poured into
[42:16] the church
[42:17] to continue the work of the gospel
[42:20] then we become not by artificial name
[42:25] but by a reality of the holy spirit of
[42:28] life
[42:29] connecting us into christ
[42:32] connecting us into christ then through
[42:34] the power of his resurrection
[42:37] we are raised from the dead things of
[42:39] the world and sitting with him in
[42:42] heavenly places amen i like that
[42:46] tonight we are sitting in heavenly
[42:48] places in christ jesus see
[42:51] resurrected with him
[42:55] died to the things of the world and
[42:59] took on christ
[43:01] and
[43:02] when we take on christ
[43:06] then the world is dead
[43:09] then
[43:11] no more care for the world
[43:14] the world is dead to us and it's dead to
[43:17] us
[43:18] and we are
[43:19] dead to it
[43:21] you are a different
[43:22] person
[43:25] different personality
[43:28] because you are a new creation
[43:31] not the same creation palestine
[43:35] not a man that sent a new leaf but a man
[43:38] that's died and been born again and
[43:41] became a new creation in christ jesus
[43:46] and the spirit of the living god lives
[43:49] in the person
[43:51] hallelujah so we became
[43:54] that temple
[43:55] not made with hands not a natural or
[43:59] material
[44:01] temple
[44:02] but hallelujah a body
[44:04] has now prepared
[44:08] god's provided place of worship
[44:10] 1965
[44:12] paragraph 41 he says
[44:15] you are then not yourself you are a new
[44:18] creature
[44:19] for the greek
[44:21] there means
[44:22] a new creation
[44:24] you've been recreated again
[44:28] the power of god comes upon you and you
[44:30] become created
[44:32] a new creation creature
[44:35] which brings the whole physical being
[44:38] spiritual being and everything in
[44:41] subject to the word of god
[44:43] not
[44:44] no other way
[44:46] hallelujah so if we are in christ
[44:51] paul said that there is therefore now no
[44:53] condemnation
[44:54] to them which are in christ jesus who
[44:56] walk not
[44:59] after the flesh but after the spirit
[45:04] is a a bible uh i think uh in iv uh
[45:08] version
[45:10] it only says that there is there is
[45:12] therefore now no condemnation to them
[45:14] which are in christ jesus and
[45:16] period
[45:18] and
[45:21] they take this uh phrase who walk not
[45:23] after the flesh but after the spirit
[45:26] who walk not hallelujah after the place
[45:29] but
[45:30] those that are being baptized with the
[45:33] holy spirit hallelujah and then uh
[45:35] finally uh later on they found out
[45:38] that the the one who wrote that or who
[45:41] translated that bible was a homosexual
[45:45] hallelujah
[45:46] but uh to them that are in christ jesus
[45:49] there is no more condemnation
[45:52] those who are hallelujah who are walking
[45:55] after the spirit amen
[45:57] hallelujah
[45:59] and colossians chapter 1
[46:02] verses 14 to 18
[46:04] it says in whom we have redemption
[46:07] through his blood
[46:08] even the forgiveness of sins
[46:12] who is the image of the invisible god
[46:14] the firstborn of every creature
[46:18] for by him we are all things con

[46:31] powers
[46:32] all things were created by him and for
[46:35] him
[46:36] and he is before all things and by him
[46:39] all things consist
[46:40] and he is the head of that body

[46:50] but that

[47:00] fullness of the godhead
[47:03] bodily
[47:04] and we have it by measure
[47:07] but we are all

[47:10] a dwelling place of that
[47:12] the same god hallelujah the same god

[47:16] that was in christ is the same god in
[47:18] the believers
[47:19] hallelujah he only only have it by
[47:22] measure and he got hallelujah
[47:27] the fullness and said if you get a
[47:31] big
[47:34] machine of a laboratory and then examine
[47:38] the chemicals on the ocean
[47:40] alleluia and then
[47:44] you get a portion of it in a cup
[47:49] and then examine it within a laboratory
[47:52] there is no difference
[47:54] the same chemicals the same quality
[47:57] that is in the ocean and the same
[47:59] quality that is in the cup
[48:01] it is the same quality the same
[48:02] hallelujah but we only have it by
[48:05] measure hallelujah we are all
[48:08] part of that body
[48:09] and he is the head of the body the

[49:10] not a building
[49:11] made with hands
[49:13] hallelujah
[49:14] but the body of jesus christ
[49:17] and then brethren help me use the the
[49:20] the
[49:20] the this um
[49:23] uh
[49:24] this uh
[49:25] verse in matthew chapter 24
[49:28] maybe the disciples were you know they
[49:31] were uh
[49:33] uh looking
[49:35] to that temple

[49:46] hallelujah how how glorious it is how
[49:49] beautiful

[49:52] matthew chapter 24 verse 1 and jesus
[49:54] went out and departed from the temple
[49:57] and his disciples came to him for to
[50:00] show him that the building of the temple
[50:03] and jesus said unto them
[50:05] see not all these things
[50:07] verily i say unto you there shall not

[50:11] left here one stone upon another that
[50:14] shall not be thrown down
[50:17] okay yes it is beautiful it is glorious
[50:22] hallelujah but
[50:24] i tell you there is not one stone
[50:27] hallelujah
[50:30] upon another that shall not be thrown
[50:32] down and barbarian he went on and said
[50:36] it shows that god doesn't dwell in
[50:39] houses made with hands
[50:41] god dwells in human hearts
[50:44] for a body has thou prepared me
[50:47] the holy ghost don't dwell in a house
[50:51] it dwells in the heart amen that's the
[50:55] temple
[50:56] you know
[50:57] you you know not that you are the temple
[51:00] of the living god amen amen
[51:02] hallelujah but the natural temple that
[51:05] solomon had built is only a type of the
[51:09] building of the spiritual temple
[51:12] of the living god
[51:14] hallelujah
[51:17] the text that we read
[51:19] this evening in 1st kings chapter six
[51:22] verse seven
[51:23] it says and the house
[51:25] when it was in building was built
[51:29] abyston made ready before it was brought
[51:32] tighter so that there was neither hammer
[51:34] nor ox nor any toll of iron heard in the
[51:38] in the house while it was in building
[51:40] amen hallelujah
[51:42] and uh
[51:44] in the music uh a greater than solomon
[51:47] is here
[51:48] now the days of solomon as
[51:50] any theologian scriptural man knows that
[51:54] that was the golden age of the hebrew
[51:57] right
[51:57] they had no wars the
[52:00] the it was almost like a millennium to
[52:03] them
[52:04] great day
[52:05] they build
[52:07] the temple all nations fear them
[52:10] they was fair to do anything because
[52:13] they know that the people was with one
[52:16] heart and one accord
[52:18] god gave them a gift and
[52:22] they believe it they accepted it
[52:25] and with one heart and one accord they
[52:28] work with it
[52:29] like a millennium
[52:31] because the people
[52:33] they got one heart
[52:35] because they believe
[52:37] hallelujah
[52:39] the word
[52:40] the wisdom of solomon
[52:44] allelia and
[52:46] the people
[52:48] other
[52:49] kingdoms
[52:50] differ to make war against israel
[52:54] because uh the people they have one
[52:56] heart and one accord
[52:59] hallelujah
[53:00] and i remember
[53:03] when the queen of sheba he heard
[53:06] the glory oh he heard the wisdom of
[53:09] solomon
[53:10] and when
[53:11] she got
[53:13] before solomon
[53:15] and the bible uh it it means shown about
[53:19] how glorious is the temple
[53:21] and when he
[53:23] he
[53:24] and when she she was a watching how
[53:28] glorious it is and the bible did not
[53:30] mention how you know
[53:32] but the bible mentioned
[53:35] about how the winter
[53:37] how about the
[53:40] dimension about the people
[53:43] we're in order
[53:44] we have uh love one another and the
[53:47] singers and the main singers alleluia
[53:50] and uh you know they have one heart
[53:53] hallelujah
[53:55] and by abraham he got a message
[53:58] greater than solomon is here
[54:01] hallelujah
[54:02] the the wisdom that was in solomon it
[54:04] was not his wisdom but it was god in
[54:06] solomon that can discern
[54:08] alleluia
[54:09] and we had it in these last days
[54:13] hallelujah and
[54:15] i hope
[54:16] that
[54:17] those who believe that wisdom must have
[54:19] the same heart amen must have the same
[54:22] hallelujah the same
[54:25] the same relationship the same order
[54:28] not the fighting against one another
[54:31] hallelujah
[54:33] because
[54:34] we have the same
[54:36] the same god who was with solomon yeah
[54:39] and we are if solomo solomon built that
[54:42] the temple
[54:44] natural temple how much more
[54:47] that we need to do it hallelujah
[54:50] being
[54:51] a part of that spiritual temple amen
[54:55] hallelujah
[54:58] israel and the church he says listen
[55:00] when they built the temple of solomon
[55:02] the
[55:04] any of your medicines here
[55:06] now could get this pretty good
[55:09] they brought the cedars down from
[55:11] lebanon
[55:13] uh they floated them
[55:15] in as far as jupiter and hauled them by
[55:19] ox cart and so forth you know
[55:22] then they cut out all their stones all
[55:25] around the world
[55:27] but when they come together they were
[55:29] such perfect masonry
[55:32] and in 40 years in the building of the
[55:34] temple there wasn't a bus
[55:38] abba saw or a sound of a hammer
[55:41] every stone went one was cut
[55:44] this away one cut that way
[55:47] one was cut back this away
[55:50] but every one of them went together
[55:53] they started lying
[55:58] dusting putting the building up getting
[56:00] along fine
[56:02] and they found a funny looking stone
[56:05] they didn't want that
[56:07] they didn't want that thing said
[56:10] that don't belong here
[56:12] and they kick it out throw it over in
[56:15] the weed pile
[56:16] and some
[56:19] and come to find out they built
[56:22] one or
[56:23] built on and on and on and come to find
[56:27] out the very stone he had rejected
[56:31] was the cheap cornerstone
[56:33] hallelujah
[56:36] some
[56:37] where
[56:40] it came from
[56:41] maybe from the united states
[56:44] some came from africa
[56:47] and some came from the philippines
[56:50] somebody is shipping there somebody
[56:53] shipping here hallelujah but when they
[56:58] put them together
[56:59] hallelujah barbara said what a perfect
[57:02] masonry
[57:04] hallelujah that's why brothers and
[57:05] sisters sometimes i i i want i am
[57:08] wondering
[57:09] when i go to some places
[57:12] i feel the same kind of life i feel the
[57:14] same kind of spirit
[57:16] hallelujah
[57:17] although they have a different pastor
[57:20] and a different preacher there and
[57:22] different preacher here
[57:24] aliyah but there's only one hallelujah
[57:28] who is designing
[57:29] this uh this temple
[57:31] hallelujah and maybe
[57:33] bravrham said
[57:35] and they found a funny looking stone oh
[57:38] i don't like uh you know
[57:41] imagine i don't like to you know to
[57:47] to stay beside you
[57:50] but
[57:52] you can do nothing you are not the one
[57:54] who designed
[57:56] the temple the body
[57:59] you have to love your you know
[58:03] maybe different colors and when the
[58:05] building was finished
[58:08] oh it is not all white
[58:11] abraham said that god is a god of
[58:13] variety
[58:15] if you have a garden and you have all
[58:17] this uh your flowers are all white
[58:20] it don't looks good
[58:22] hallelujah but if you have a garden and
[58:24] you have this
[58:26] party red and yellow and white and pink
[58:30] hallelujah
[58:31] you got a very beautiful garden
[58:34] hallelujah
[58:38] so
[58:41] every part of the building is very
[58:43] important yes sir hallelujah it might
[58:45] looks funny to you
[58:47] but the greek art the great architect
[58:50] was the one who designed him that way
[58:52] hallelujah and you have and you learn to
[58:55] love him
[58:56] hallelujah and you learn to like him
[59:00] ephesians 21 in home all the building
[59:03] fitly framed together grow it unto
[59:06] unholy temple
[59:08] in the lord
[59:10] alleluia vision support 16

[59:24] working
[59:25] in the measure of every part make it
[59:28] increase
[59:29] up the body unto the defying of itself
[59:34] in love
[59:35] hallelujah
[59:37] remember brothers and sisters
[59:39] that
[59:40] solomon did not dedicate the temple
[59:44] until it was finished until all the
[59:47] parts
[59:49] were put together
[59:51] hallelujah
[59:52] you will not be raptured without me
[59:55] and i will not be raptured without you
[59:57] hallelujah until the last predestinated
[1:00:00] said
[1:00:01] alleluia will be put into that
[1:00:04] body of jesus christ hallelujah
[1:00:07] so
[1:00:09] sometimes
[1:00:10] you know
[1:00:13] sometimes there are people that uh
[1:00:16] uh
[1:00:18] he wants uh you know
[1:00:20] it was god who designed you that way
[1:00:24] maybe you don't like your position
[1:00:27] but as long as you are doing your part
[1:00:29] in the body of jesus christ god will
[1:00:31] bless you
[1:00:32] and say oh i i i want to be to be a
[1:00:35] preacher because he is always

[1:00:42] singer
[1:00:43] and i'm only a listener i'm only sitting

[1:00:50] if everybody will be here and nobody
[1:01:01] and even paul said that even the weakest
[1:01:04] uh you know
[1:01:05] the small parts of that body is more
[1:01:08] already
[1:01:11] just like uh this watch
[1:01:14] hallelujah maybe
[1:01:16] if i will ask you which part of this uh
[1:01:19] this watch you want to be maybe some of
[1:01:22] you will say oh i want to be the long
[1:01:24] hand

[1:01:27] the owner is always looking at me
[1:01:30] hallelujah i want to be the
[1:01:32] the
[1:01:34] some of the us above your watches they

[1:01:39] i want to be
[1:01:41] a diamond i want to be the the second
[1:01:43] hand
[1:01:45] but brothers and sisters don't you know
[1:01:46] that
[1:01:48] the the most important part of this
[1:01:50] watch are those parts that
[1:01:54] are inside in this watch
[1:01:57] those very small
[1:01:58] parts that even our
[1:02:01] our uh
[1:02:03] our eyes could not see
[1:02:05] the worst repairer he even uses uh this
[1:02:10] leans to just to see that that very
[1:02:13] important part
[1:02:15] and if it is you know if you misplace
[1:02:17] that very important the small part
[1:02:22] all you have to do is
[1:02:25] take off
[1:02:26] get this
[1:02:29] watch from your
[1:02:30] hands and
[1:02:31] you know
[1:02:33] hallelujah
[1:02:34] you cannot use it anymore
[1:02:37] it's the same thing maybe
[1:02:39] some of you uh
[1:02:41] became upset because i am just
[1:02:43] no brothers and sisters
[1:02:45] every one of us is
[1:02:47] hallelujah important in that body
[1:02:50] hallelujah and we should support
[1:02:53] hallelujah
[1:02:54] from whom the whole body is fitly joined
[1:02:56] together and compacted
[1:02:59] by that with every joint supplies
[1:03:03] hallelujah supplies according to the
[1:03:05] effectual working hallelujah
[1:03:08] you know brothers and sisters
[1:03:10] there is no
[1:03:11] hallelujah preacher that can preach
[1:03:15] a good sermon
[1:03:17] without
[1:03:18] somebody who is secretly praying for his
[1:03:21] pastor
[1:03:22] hallelujah
[1:03:25] no one can go
[1:03:28] to mission
[1:03:30] new mission
[1:03:32] without somebody who is secretly doing
[1:03:34] his part
[1:03:35] giving his part hallelujah and nobody
[1:03:39] sees it
[1:03:40] hallelujah
[1:03:41] but verses
[1:03:43] as long as you are doing your part and
[1:03:45] god will bless you
[1:03:47] hallelujah continue to do your part
[1:03:49] hallelujah and god will bless you
[1:03:52] hallelujah
[1:03:53] uh one more question
[1:03:55] this is
[1:03:56] and it was so masterly built
[1:03:59] that when the temple went together it
[1:04:01] had all kinds of little funny looking
[1:04:04] stones in it
[1:04:05] but when they began to read the
[1:04:07] blueprint it was all in the blueprint
[1:04:11] and there wasn't not even a boss of a
[1:04:14] soul
[1:04:15] or sound of a hammer for 40 years in
[1:04:17] building the temple
[1:04:19] i think that's the way god's got his
[1:04:21] people all cut out
[1:04:24] once god a nature of one kind one
[1:04:27] another
[1:04:28] but they are all christians fitted
[1:04:32] stones joined together upon the cheap
[1:04:34] corner cornerstone jesus christ christ
[1:04:37] jesus
[1:04:38] oh there's the main thing
[1:04:41] so many rejected the precious
[1:04:43] cornerstone
[1:04:45] where we are all built together cemented
[1:04:48] together
[1:04:50] with god's love that's the most
[1:04:52] important practitioner cemented together
[1:04:55] with god's love that's right
[1:04:58] god's love and when we have that
[1:05:01] there's nothing will separate us
[1:05:03] there's nothing can divide us as long as
[1:05:06] we love one another
[1:05:08] i've been a minister for 61 years i've
[1:05:12] seen all kinds of gifts i've seen god do
[1:05:16] great things
[1:05:17] but the greatest thing i have ever seen
[1:05:20] in my life was love
[1:05:24] it's the most powerful force that stops
[1:05:27] anything there is is love
[1:05:30] love that mo
[1:05:32] almighty god
[1:05:33] god's love the world that he gave his
[1:05:36] only begotten son
[1:05:37] love is a great
[1:05:39] great k-note
[1:05:41] seeing
[1:05:42] we live out
[1:05:44] it's something
[1:05:46] that's eternal
[1:05:48] hallelujah
[1:05:51] god bless you all and
[1:05:54] i give now back
[1:05:56] the time to

[1:06:50] lot more in something when you compact
[1:06:52] it
[1:06:53] when you put when you keep pushing down
[1:06:54] a little bit more a little bit more you
[1:06:56] can just keep stacking it on top of each
