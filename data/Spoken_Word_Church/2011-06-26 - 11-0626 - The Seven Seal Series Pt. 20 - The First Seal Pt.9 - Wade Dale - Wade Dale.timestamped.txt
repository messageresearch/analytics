[0:00] Ezekiel 28. I want to thank sister Susan
[0:05] for bringing me up
[0:07] bringing me a tooth puller
[0:12] oh I'm sorry
[0:17] and thanks for sister Santa bringing me
[0:20] this because I needed a line over in
[0:22] this dark corner that I'm standing in
[0:26] um
[0:38] this is actually brother Tom that went
[0:39] on to meet the Lord this is his of you
[0:42] so I think he would absolutely want it
[0:44] to be used oh absolutely for his purpose
[0:48] anything to do with the word of God he
[0:51] was all for it
[0:54] and you know what if he was still here
[0:56] yes he would anyway you're exactly
[0:59] correct all right Ezekiel
[1:01] 28. we're still on the man of sin
[1:07] 28
[1:11] Ezekiel 28th
[1:15] okay yeah everybody there
[1:19] Ezekiel chapter 28.
[1:23] so this is talking about a natural king
[1:25] king of tire and let's see how this
[1:28] evolves and we're still in the first
[1:29] seal we're still in the mystery of
[1:31] iniquity because as the first seal is
[1:34] open
[1:36] we see that God was unfolding himself to
[1:40] the people
[1:41] but remember Satan right behind him
[1:43] unfold trying to unfold himself in what
[1:46] remember what we were talking about last
[1:47] Sunday he was not unfolding himself in a
[1:50] drunk and the prostitutes and
[1:53] you know the the people of the world
[1:55] know he was unbounding himself as a
[1:58] white righteous church he was hid
[2:00] in that white righteous horse that that
[2:03] charger that rider that's going out that
[2:05] John admired and thought was so
[2:08] beautiful this church
[2:10] because I was just symbols not a horse
[2:12] it's a power
[2:14] um John did see
[2:17] a church which was the
[2:20] Roman Catholic church or whatever you
[2:22] want to call it but he saw all the Pomp
[2:23] and Circumstance he loved it he won
[2:25] again he would it kind of made John want
[2:29] to become churchy
[2:30] kind of like we don't need to be we need
[2:32] to be churchy all right
[2:34] but he admired it with great admiration
[2:37] now let's look at this king of tire
[2:40] which tire was on the coast
[2:44] and you can call it Tyrus
[2:47] is the place
[2:49] there was a king there and he was right
[2:51] on the coast and then a lot of
[2:52] merchandise came through there a lot of
[2:54] traffic because he was kind of like the
[2:56] headwaters of the Mississippi not the
[2:57] headwaters but the down at the bottom of
[2:59] Mississippi the mouth of the Mississippi
[3:01] where all the Commerce had to come right
[3:04] by him
[3:05] okay but watch how this evolved into a
[3:08] man
[3:10] the man of sin because watch this the
[3:12] word of the Lord came again unto me
[3:14] saying son of man say unto the prince of
[3:17] Taurus thus saith the Lord God
[3:19] okay son of man
[3:22] so the son of man's got to be on the
[3:23] scene for this to happen
[3:26] all right
[3:27] in Ezekiel you'll see many many times
[3:31] Ezekiel the the uh the word coming to
[3:35] Ezekiel say son of man prophesied I like
[3:38] the Book of Ezekiel it's a very very
[3:40] neat book to read thus says the Lord God
[3:43] because thine heart is lifted up and
[3:46] thou has said I am God
[3:48] I sit in the seat of God in the midst of
[3:52] the Seas
[3:54] all right what's water what seas people
[3:58] all right I sit in the midst of the
[4:00] people
[4:01] yet thou art a man and not God
[4:05] so this Spirit has taken on the form of
[4:09] a man
[4:10] we don't Satan's not a man like you and
[4:12] I
[4:13] but incarnate in somebody he is a man
[4:16] all right
[4:19] yet thou art a man and not God though
[4:22] thou set thine heart
[4:24] as the heart of God
[4:28] conquering and to conquer riding on a
[4:30] white horse making yourself look
[4:32] religious
[4:33] Satan does not want you to tell any
[4:35] difference this is the point I want us
[4:37] to see about this first seal Satan does
[4:40] not want you to look at him and look at
[4:42] God and see a difference right
[4:45] he does not want you to look at God and
[4:48] look at him and see a difference because
[4:49] when you see a difference
[4:51] that's what the prophet came to he saw a
[4:53] difference he saw something separate
[4:55] going away when you've got something
[4:58] going away from him it's an opposition
[5:00] right okay
[5:02] because the pool brings everything to
[5:04] you it brings God to you it brings the
[5:06] angel to the Lord it brings the word of
[5:08] God to you but if you see something
[5:09] riding away from you that's something
[5:11] that was a part of you but it's gone all
[5:13] right but in this right here we see that
[5:16] thou art sent thine heart as the heart
[5:18] of God he wants you to believe he's God
[5:20] right
[5:22] there's the mystery of iniquity
[5:26] not that we can be so bad
[5:30] that we see it but is that we can be so
[5:34] good
[5:35] and be black inside that's all right
[5:39] and act like a Christian that's right
[5:41] act
[5:42] I don't want to be an act you know
[5:44] somebody said well we're actors and
[5:45] that's okay brother Brian said we're
[5:47] actors in a play but I don't brother
[5:48] Brown said the word Pharisee means actor
[5:51] I don't want to be that kind of an actor
[5:52] because they were acting the part of God
[5:54] all right Satan can't be God but he can
[5:58] be so close to God because he's
[6:00] Supernatural
[6:01] all right
[6:02] with thou wisdom no I'm sorry verse
[6:04] three excuse me
[6:06] behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel
[6:11] there is no secret that they can hide
[6:13] from thee so see the things that God has
[6:16] revealed to you and I the things that
[6:18] are locked up in the word of God Satan's
[6:21] already had first first dim them
[6:23] Satan is a spiritual being he catches a
[6:26] spiritual application of things he can't
[6:28] get a revelation and be a a part of God
[6:30] but he can feel the pull of that
[6:33] Revelation he can feel that God's moving
[6:36] to remember my brother I said he said if
[6:38] I start thinking about God he said if I
[6:40] start saying something said Satan will
[6:42] come right in there and you know he's
[6:44] right there
[6:45] if I say I'm going to do something he
[6:46] said the kids will start crying the
[6:48] phone will start ringing you know and
[6:49] the wife will drop something on the
[6:51] floor and he says but if I keep it in my
[6:53] heart
[6:54] if I keep it in my heart he says they
[6:56] can't get in there okay so this is what
[6:59] this is Behold our wiser than Daniel
[7:00] there is no secret that they can hide
[7:02] from thee
[7:04] with our wisdom and thy understanding
[7:07] see understanding
[7:09] see brother Brown said Satan has a
[7:11] knowledge on the Revelation he has a
[7:13] knowledge
[7:14] in other words he can read
[7:16] because the Bible says that the angels
[7:20] believe in one God and tremble
[7:23] Satan makes man believe in the Trinity
[7:25] and laughs at us because he knows that
[7:26] we're down here less reform but he can
[7:29] what
[7:30] overpower us if we let him
[7:32] and we just believe the Trinity and go
[7:34] around with our wisdom and thy
[7:36] understanding thou Hast gotten the
[7:39] riches
[7:40] and has gotten gold and silver into thy
[7:43] Treasures
[7:45] by thy great wisdom and by that traffic
[7:48] has thou increased thy riches
[7:52] and thy heart is lifted up because of
[7:54] thy riches
[7:56] therefore thus saith the Lord God
[7:58] because thou has set thine heart as the
[8:00] heart of God now this is the problem
[8:04] thus saith the Lord God because now I
[8:06] sent thine heart is the heart of God
[8:08] this is what's going to happen because
[8:09] when you said your heart as the heart of
[8:11] God but you live like the devil
[8:13] but you act like a Christian this is
[8:15] what's going to happen behold therefore
[8:17] I will bring strangers upon thee
[8:19] strange docs strings strange ideas
[8:24] strange ways strange thinking
[8:28] the terrible of the Nations and they
[8:30] shall draw their swords against the
[8:33] beauty of thy wisdom
[8:35] now watch Satan everything he touches it
[8:38] destroys right
[8:40] because that's just the way he is he
[8:42] perverts and if you pervert anything
[8:43] unless it comes out of that it's going
[8:45] to stay perverted all right
[8:47] because he's turned Kings against Kings
[8:49] people against people trying to conquer
[8:51] this world
[8:52] he turned Angels against God
[8:55] so he surely ought to be working on us
[8:57] right you know trying to get us
[9:00] right and shall draw their swords
[9:02] against the beauty of thy wisdom
[9:06] great swelling words of wisdom
[9:10] coming from a Pulpit
[9:13] and they shall defile thy brightness
[9:18] they shall bring thee down to the pit
[9:22] Thou shalt die of the deaths of them
[9:24] that are slain in the midst of the Seas
[9:28] in other words every death he's going to
[9:29] be remember brother Brown said every day
[9:31] is going to be heaped on his head every
[9:32] sickness is going to be heaped on
[9:33] Satan's head everything's going to be
[9:35] heat on this devil that we're talking
[9:37] about
[9:39] wilt thou yet say before him that
[9:41] slayeth Thee I am God in other words
[9:44] in other words watch his attitude
[9:46] I know one thing's for sure if brother
[9:49] Donnie created me and brought me into
[9:51] this world and I knew that
[9:53] and gave me Supernatural power
[9:57] because you know there was a
[9:58] conversation between the two it wasn't
[10:00] just that God made the devil and he just
[10:02] went off and started being bad now there
[10:03] was a conversation and never got a
[10:04] thought in his mind
[10:06] well thou yet say before him that
[10:09] slayeth Thee I am God
[10:12] in other words he's telling God he's God
[10:14] now and that's what he's been talking
[10:15] about in the scripture
[10:17] I want to be like God and then in
[10:19] Thessalonians he's setting a seat as God
[10:23] he don't want no subjection that's what
[10:25] iniquity is that's no suggestion
[10:28] if you commit iniquity that means you
[10:30] knew better so you got a headship you
[10:32] knew better
[10:33] everybody understand you knew that right
[10:35] here's knowing better yes you did it
[10:37] anyway what'd you do you superseded or
[10:39] went before your headship
[10:41] right that's right and we do it all the
[10:43] time people we do we do it all the time
[10:45] that's right we got to quit doing that
[10:47] that's right because this supposed to
[10:49] show us so when I say that first seal is
[10:52] very important this is to show us where
[10:53] the devil is sinning you said well I
[10:56] knew he was in my brain no you gotta
[10:58] really know that he's really there all
[11:00] the time
[11:02] and you got to make a choice remember I
[11:05] wrote that on the board on that long
[11:06] time ago Choice that's right
[11:09] because choose you this day whom you'll
[11:11] serve right Norbert black no that's
[11:13] right okay because we all got it the
[11:16] unpopular belief
[11:17] if you don't find a war in your members
[11:20] right now then the devil has got you
[11:22] hooked right
[11:24] the devil has got you now if you don't
[11:28] have a battle in your mind
[11:30] brother Brown said this thing right here
[11:32] will be sticky until the chain so we're
[11:34] not going to like daddy's been preaching
[11:36] we're not going to walk into something
[11:37] and start getting so perfect that we
[11:40] have no bad thoughts no we're going to
[11:43] go come to realization one day though
[11:45] that that's nothing that that's not
[11:46] that's the power that saved holes on us
[11:49] and what power is that something you
[11:52] can't see
[11:53] something you fabricate in your mind
[11:57] it's not even real
[12:00] it's not even real remember the old
[12:02] saying you know you you say well I think
[12:04] Mom's talking about me because she
[12:06] looked over here one time she's talking
[12:07] to sister back they ain't talking about
[12:09] me
[12:10] no remember 99 of the time they're
[12:12] usually talking about themselves and the
[12:13] problems they got not the problem they
[12:15] got with you okay
[12:18] right that's right so we were we going
[12:22] around the world worrying half the time
[12:23] about what people think about it
[12:28] and who is that doing that
[12:31] Satan likes to do what divide and
[12:33] conquer that's right okay
[12:35] now let's be real as human beings before
[12:38] we finish reading this because this is
[12:39] going to come from the human man down
[12:41] we're going to see Satan here because
[12:42] see in verse 13 it shows you what's
[12:45] going on this man was not in the Garden
[12:47] of Eden this Prince of Tire this real
[12:50] guy that's standing there that ezekiel's
[12:53] looking at and talking about but he but
[12:55] Ezekiel sees the spirit behind that
[12:58] Prince of Tire the real man standing
[13:00] there and says oh you go back to the
[13:02] Garden of Eden when you walk right here
[13:05] verse 13 thou has been in Eden the
[13:07] Garden of God
[13:09] so see he's he's picked what does he do
[13:11] he picked up the spirit of the man not
[13:14] so much the man standing there but this
[13:16] he sees the spirit of that man and then
[13:18] the Holy Spirit takes him back to the
[13:20] Garden of Eden he says hey this is where
[13:22] it all began
[13:24] that's why this Prince of Tyler loves
[13:26] merchandise he loves money he loves gold
[13:28] he loves silver he loves all these
[13:30] things
[13:30] the love of money is the root of all
[13:32] evil not money but the Love of Money all
[13:34] right amen all right so here we got a
[13:38] person standing here but watch how Satan
[13:41] comes in and Ezekiel through the son of
[13:44] man through the Holy Spirit he divides
[13:45] that thing up
[13:47] okay you and I wait we they sometimes
[13:50] that y'all don't like about meeting
[13:51] somebody I don't like about you that's
[13:53] just human things we got to get over
[13:54] that stuff that's right I mean not get
[13:56] over to what I say well I'll put up with
[13:58] you no I may not put up with you but
[14:01] um but you're still my brother and
[14:02] sister when we come talking about the
[14:04] Lord that ought to bring everybody
[14:05] together that's right whether you like
[14:07] apple pie or cherry pie and you try to
[14:09] feed me cherry pie I don't like cherry
[14:10] pie
[14:11] now strawberry pie I love strawberry pie
[14:15] but cherry pie I don't want too much
[14:17] don't try to feed me that right but
[14:19] we're upset and talk about the word of
[14:20] God all day long you can get Cherry Pie
[14:22] and I'll set then
[14:24] pray for strawberry pie
[14:27] yeah you understand what I'm saying is
[14:28] these little things that Satan it's a
[14:30] little foxes that spoil the mind even as
[14:31] Christians all of us coming together
[14:33] even as a church group everybody's
[14:35] looking for a perfect Church there is no
[14:37] perfect church because Satan's in every
[14:38] one of them right every one of them but
[14:42] the word of God is the most powerful
[14:43] thing right the word of God is the most
[14:45] powerful force see Satan can hide behind
[14:48] Paul Stockman and he can work his way
[14:49] through it just by false documents being
[14:51] preached but if we believe that that
[14:53] false Doctrine is not being preached in
[14:55] this church he can't hide there so he'll
[14:57] say well brother Donnie he's he he goes
[14:59] to ball games and boy we just need to
[15:01] and that's not true but I'm just saying
[15:03] for an example so we don't want we don't
[15:05] have nothing to do with him because he's
[15:06] you know or if this one's got this
[15:10] if you're of the devil you're going to
[15:12] manifest yourself somewhere that's right
[15:14] this Prince of tire
[15:16] was probably just a natural common man
[15:18] he liked money he liked but he didn't
[15:20] think a thing about God but Ezekiel
[15:22] would look at him and say okay you
[15:24] principal Tire you're doing this you
[15:25] have the characteristics of the devil
[15:27] then the Lord just breaks him into a
[15:29] vision and shows that Spirit go all the
[15:31] way back to the Garden of Eden because
[15:32] remember that's where everything started
[15:34] in the Garden of Eden
[15:44] that's worth Satan now knowing that
[15:46] we've got to get our character our
[15:47] everything right he's attacking families
[15:51] marriages children any little thing he
[15:54] can get and muzzle up your mind and if
[15:57] and it's not like adultering murder and
[16:00] all that nobody does that that's little
[16:01] just a little stuff that he just keeps
[16:04] muzzling up your mind yep
[16:06] and the best thing to do if Abraham
[16:08] would have looked at all those
[16:09] circumstances he'd have never had a
[16:11] child
[16:12] he counted what the Bible say he counted
[16:14] those things that were as they were not
[16:18] okay that's right if I say whatever you
[16:20] know we gotta we got to we got to
[16:22] conquer that he's conquered us all this
[16:25] time with family splitting up and this
[16:27] happening like Mom said and all this
[16:29] stuff going on
[16:30] listen folks I'm telling you if you lose
[16:33] everything you got
[16:34] the Bible says if you
[16:38] gain the whole world and lose your soul
[16:43] your worst
[16:45] than anything in the world can happen to
[16:48] you he said see
[16:51] sorry that's right thank you for the
[16:54] Kingdom of Heaven if you'll put the
[16:55] kingdom of God first
[16:57] then all these other things will come it
[16:59] will fall in place it really will all
[17:02] right let's finish reading this
[17:06] excuse me and they shall bring thee down
[17:09] to the pit mercy and thou shalt die the
[17:10] deaths of them that are slander that's
[17:12] the sea now wait a minute this is this
[17:14] great powerful guy
[17:16] who's they
[17:20] us
[17:22] who's they us
[17:26] because we give him the power to be
[17:29] powerful or we take the power away from
[17:32] him that's right right that's right
[17:34] verse 9. let me tell you something
[17:37] though people there's always been a big
[17:39] question mark since the beginning since
[17:42] the fall happened that big question mark
[17:44] is death
[17:46] therefore you're staying great words you
[17:48] Victory that's fine but when you come up
[17:50] to the point of death
[17:51] nobody's really been able to understand
[17:53] it but what did Brother Randall say that
[17:55] Satan was they called his name in the
[17:57] for sale death he said only in the last
[18:01] Church age was a group of people able to
[18:05] single him out and call him this name
[18:08] and when you put a name on somebody
[18:10] you've exposed them
[18:12] room of a thousand people
[18:15] there's only one guy in there named Wade
[18:17] well you don't know me from nobody if I
[18:20] don't call my name or somebody says hey
[18:21] wait well you know what thousand people
[18:23] know who I am I've been exposed and as I
[18:25] am because you've called my name
[18:27] my character I walk around and you might
[18:29] you know I'm shake hands with a thousand
[18:31] people he ain't doing you know never
[18:32] tell them a name but when somebody calls
[18:34] your name then you say oh you're
[18:35] identified
[18:36] right this is who you're identifying as
[18:38] you know why do you think these stupid
[18:40] actors and stuff they wear all these
[18:42] ball caps and sunglasses they don't want
[18:44] to be exposed they don't want to be they
[18:45] don't want to be what they don't want to
[18:47] be revealed they don't want people to
[18:48] know what they're doing
[18:49] well this same way we'll see he's been
[18:51] trying to hide but once you call that
[18:53] guy's name out
[18:55] he's in opposition to everything that we
[18:58] do
[18:59] then when you expose him sure he's gonna
[19:01] get mad
[19:02] but we must believe that greater heat is
[19:04] in us right because that guy has looked
[19:08] that's one more thing well Thou shalt
[19:11] bring they shall bring thee down to the
[19:13] pit
[19:14] wow
[19:16] a group of people finally has enough
[19:18] power
[19:20] revelation of God
[19:23] to bring this man down
[19:25] Thou shalt die the deaths of them that
[19:27] are slain in the midst of the sea will
[19:29] thou yet stay before him that sled Thee
[19:32] I am God but thou shall be a man and no
[19:36] God
[19:37] in the hand of him that sleth them
[19:40] Thou shalt die the deaths of the
[19:42] uncircumcised
[19:44] by the hand
[19:46] I want you to if you don't write in your
[19:49] Bible but I want you to underline that
[19:53] if we become
[19:56] brothers or acquaintances with the devil
[19:59] we're not strangers
[20:01] but when we've become so much like God
[20:05] well Satan calls us a stranger that's
[20:08] what I want to be named I want to be a
[20:10] stranger to this Prince of time because
[20:13] the Stranger by the hand of The
[20:15] Strangers
[20:16] it's not just one it's a group of people
[20:18] right you had to hand that one
[20:21] I worked long time ago tonight that I
[20:24] got talked but
[20:27] we realize who sang this and if he ever
[20:31] tells you something it's not the word
[20:32] don't even quit
[20:34] you go right where he's coming from
[20:36] about uh if it's not the word but we
[20:39] still let him do all this product stuff
[20:42] in our minds and and when we know it I
[20:45] didn't work like that you're taking back
[20:47] the word every time I don't do it all
[20:49] the time years ago you quit preaching my
[20:52] sermon we're going to read you remember
[20:54] brother Douglas this past Sunday did
[20:56] y'all catch what he was reading
[20:59] we'll go back there and just say let's
[21:01] finish this
[21:02] because I'm going to show you the power
[21:04] of not just the written word as long as
[21:07] it's written down on paper Satan can do
[21:10] what program's a safe and question it
[21:12] but when it spoke
[21:14] you're not catch up what he said yes
[21:16] Jesus said it is written it is written
[21:20] the last thing he says it said
[21:23] written right Satan stayed there written
[21:26] Satan stayed there that very last thing
[21:28] Jesus said it is said Thou shalt not
[21:32] tempt the Lord thy God and guess what
[21:34] the old guy had to leave wouldn't come
[21:36] out of them I mean you know Jesus said
[21:37] it's written
[21:39] that site was still right there it is
[21:42] written
[21:43] Satan's still right there but when he
[21:45] said I say unto you right that's the way
[21:48] I interpret the Bible say I say unto you
[21:50] there in the Book of Matthew we're
[21:52] reading just a minute I am going but
[21:54] Thou shalt be a man no God in the hands
[21:56] of him that's Lefty Thou shalt die of
[21:58] the deaths of all deaths of the
[22:00] uncircumcised by the hand of strangers
[22:03] for I have spoken except the Lord
[22:05] there's your promise right there for I
[22:08] have spoken that saith the Lord moreover
[22:09] the word of the Lord came unto me same
[22:11] son of man pick up a lamentation upon
[22:14] the king of tires and say unto him thus
[22:16] saith the Lord God capital L capital d o
[22:19] d
[22:21] thou sealeth of the son full of wisdom
[22:23] and perfect
[22:25] in Beauty if you come by Satan thou has
[22:28] been in Eden the Garden of God every
[22:30] precious stone was I covered sergeants
[22:33] topaz Diamond Barrel Onyx Jasper
[22:35] Sapphire Emerald carbuncle gold
[22:38] the workmanship of thy tablets and I
[22:40] want you to look all those precious
[22:42] stones
[22:44] were in the breastplate of Aaron and
[22:47] we're in the temple
[22:48] look how close he was
[22:51] that's why Satan took Jesus and put him
[22:55] on top of the Temple
[22:56] in the middle of Jerusalem
[22:58] Satan wasn't scared to that Temple right
[23:02] he took him right up there and set him
[23:03] down with Papa and he wasn't scared of
[23:05] it
[23:06] but when Jesus said I say all right say
[23:08] it Satan I believe all right so he's not
[23:11] scared of a building you're not scared
[23:13] of a building he scared of somebody
[23:15] that'll that'll take this right here the
[23:17] workmanship of thy tablets and of that
[23:19] pipe was prepared in thee in the day
[23:21] that thou was created so now he know we
[23:24] know he was a created being
[23:26] Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[23:28] covered
[23:29] wow pretty close huh
[23:32] and I have sent these up who said this
[23:35] the Lord God remember
[23:38] thou was upon the holy mountain of God
[23:41] what scared being there was he
[23:45] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[23:47] of the stones of fire in other words
[23:49] ascending and descending
[23:52] thou was perfect in thy way from the day
[23:55] that thou was created till what
[23:58] iniquity was found in the
[24:01] by the multitude of thy merchandise they
[24:04] have filled the midst of thee with
[24:06] violence
[24:07] and thou has sinned therefore I will
[24:10] cast thee as profane out of the Mountain
[24:12] of God

[24:24] of the Mountain of God
[24:26] all right cast out on the perfect man
[24:28] and I will destroy thee ocovering cherub
[24:32] from the mist of the stones of fire
[24:35] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[24:38] Beauty
[24:39] thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[24:41] of thy brightness oh see there
[24:44] white righteous Church brightness
[24:47] he's not dark
[24:49] sure he's dark inside but he he likes to
[24:51] be Lions he likes to be like God
[24:53] I will cast thee to the ground
[24:56] and I will lay thee before kings that
[24:58] they may be holy remember we read last
[25:00] week in Isaiah is this the man Kings of
[25:04] the earth walk by and say is this the
[25:05] man that ruined the Nations
[25:08] okay now it's defiled by sanctuaries not
[25:12] buildings people
[25:16] that has defound
[25:18] the People by the multitude of
[25:21] non-iniquity
[25:23] by the iniquity of thy traffic
[25:26] what is traffic merchandise is selling
[25:29] he's selling itself
[25:31] therefore will I bring forth a fire from
[25:33] the midst of thee it shall devour thee
[25:37] and I will bring thee to ashes upon the
[25:41] Earth
[25:45] he got cast out I ever remember and he
[25:47] got brought down here but where's he
[25:48] going to be destroyed right here he's
[25:51] going to be destroyed on destroyed on
[25:53] the place that he tried to destroy he

[26:16] and underline right here and put Satan's
[26:18] in and never shalt thou be anymore
[26:22] faith is gone destroy
[26:24] finish
[26:25] now let's go to Matthew or English
[26:31] my brother Douglas was talking about
[26:36] weight
[26:46] now
[26:48] is Luke I'm sorry Luke four that's right
[26:53] look for it
[26:57] the Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost
[26:59] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[27:01] spirit of the Wilderness being 40 days
[27:03] tempted of the devil
[27:06] and those days you don't know anything
[27:07] when they were ended here forward was
[27:10] hungry the devil said unto him if thou
[27:12] being the Son of God command these
[27:13] stones that it be made bread and Jesus
[27:15] answered him saying it is written
[27:18] well first verse 4. it is written
[27:21] if man shall not live by bread alone but
[27:24] by every word of God
[27:25] the devil taking them up into a high
[27:27] mountain and showed him all the kingdoms
[27:29] of the world in a moment of time
[27:31] in other words all the way up another
[27:33] round for the United States right the
[27:35] devil said unto him all this power will
[27:37] I give thee all this power so he's the
[27:39] king of this Earth down here he's the
[27:40] king of all that's going on around there
[27:41] all right all this power will I give
[27:44] thee and the glory of them
[27:47] for that is delivered unto me where was
[27:51] it what we just talked about Prince of
[27:53] Tire he was given the control of the
[27:55] traffic in the merchandise and stuff
[27:57] like that
[27:58] for that is delivered unto me and to
[28:00] whomsoever I will I give it who power
[28:04] will
[28:06] will power whosoever I will
[28:10] in other words whosoever wishes it he'll
[28:12] give it to him all right we know that we
[28:15] did that we've done that for all of our
[28:17] life you yield to the devil he'll give
[28:20] you what you want
[28:21] right
[28:23] I did it I don't know about you maybe
[28:24] we're born different than I was if I
[28:28] don't think so
[28:30] I ain't seen by the gray hair we all get
[28:32] it then we're all born saying if thou
[28:36] therefore will worship me all shall be
[28:39] done and Jesus answered and said unto
[28:41] him get thee behind me saying before it
[28:43] is written
[28:45] Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[28:47] him only shalt thou serve and he brought
[28:49] him to Jerusalem
[28:51] the most holy city on the face of the
[28:55] Earth the seed of religion
[28:57] all right
[28:59] and save him on a pinnacle of the temple
[29:01] and I wrote my Bible a long time ago
[29:03] Satan was in the was in the holiest city
[29:06] and not afraid but he took him right
[29:08] straight to the temple
[29:10] and said unto him if thou be the Son of
[29:12] God cast myself down from him for it is
[29:14] written
[29:15] say he's quoting word back to him he
[29:18] shall give his angels charged over me
[29:20] over thee to keep them and in their
[29:23] hands they shall bear thee up lest any
[29:25] time that I Dash thy foot against the
[29:26] stone and Jesus answered and said unto
[29:29] him it is said
[29:31] now who spoke that
[29:34] he did he wrote the word right he wrote
[29:38] the word
[29:39] but when he say I say unto you Satan
[29:43] Thou shalt not tempt the Lord capital L
[29:47] thy God
[29:49] there he was standing it's something
[29:51] spoke from the inside he said well it
[29:52] spoke over here so Jesus was saying it's
[29:55] red taking him back to the scripture
[29:57] which is a good way to start
[29:59] but somewhere down the line people we
[30:01] got to come down to this third pull
[30:04] first pull second pull you why is this
[30:06] three times this happened
[30:08] the third pull is what speaking the word
[30:12] right here Jesus exercise the part of
[30:16] the third pull he said it is said
[30:20] and then the devil had ended all the
[30:22] Temptation he departed from him for a
[30:24] season though be careful he didn't
[30:26] depart from him forever just for a
[30:28] season
[30:30] because he pounded that human being day
[30:32] in and day out
[30:34] but the Bible said yet without
[30:37] Sam
[30:41] that's uh
[30:43] pretty tough to say
[30:45] but when this man of sin is exposed
[30:49] and you see him going away from you
[30:52] you watch too you watch
[30:54] we'll bring your uh silver next week
[30:57] because we're going to read some things
[30:58] out of first film
[31:00] but once brother Branham in his early
[31:02] Ministry I've been reading the 54 55 56
[31:05] reading the prayer lines I've been doing
[31:07] that for about a year you know read the
[31:09] book and then then read the prayer line
[31:11] he stalled he said I'm waiting on
[31:14] something I'm waiting on something well
[31:16] there was a man standing there a prophet
[31:18] of God
[31:19] filled with the Holy Ghost
[31:22] going up the statue were perfect man
[31:24] faith of the father and here he stands
[31:26] in 1959 and 60 and he says I'm waiting
[31:29] on him
[31:30] you know why I'm stalling unless he
[31:32] comes
[31:33] I can't do anything you watch him after
[31:36] 1963 though
[31:38] still in the healing part but not as
[31:40] much
[31:40] but he'll just finish preaching and
[31:42] he'll just start calling people out why
[31:44] he didn't have to wait on that man to
[31:46] come anymore
[31:48] when that man of sin wrote off in no
[31:50] seals and no sealed open to that prophet
[31:52] he said because of the supernatural
[31:53] element of the cause of opening these
[31:54] seals I say unto you I say unto you wow
[31:58] he had become so one not that he wasn't
[32:00] one with God when you're born again and
[32:02] it is a five-minute old babe in Christ
[32:04] you're just one with God right
[32:07] but it's like brother Dale saying that
[32:09] then that inside is just a baby we have
[32:12] to change his diapers we have to feed it
[32:14] God does the same thing for us he has to
[32:16] feed us change a diapers clean up our
[32:18] mess
[32:19] right right but as we get older that's
[32:21] going to be 40 year old babies 20 year
[32:24] old babies right okay
[32:27] don't be 60 year old babies okay I'm
[32:30] talking about in The Gospel I'm coming
[32:32] in the gospel ain't talking about age uh
[32:35] you could be born again two weeks ago
[32:36] and and and you know if you really truly
[32:39] Sanctified yourself to God during that
[32:41] time you probably know more than nobody
[32:43] than you've been in 10 years that just
[32:45] kind of just come to church for the heck
[32:46] of it really let's be honest
[32:51] but Satan
[32:53] Satan has a problem whipping
[32:55] they'll never one of those Faith virtue
[32:58] and all this information God the brother
[32:59] and kindness and the love of God
[33:02] remember we read in second Thessalonians
[33:03] it wasn't the truth that they didn't
[33:06] hear they didn't hear the love of the
[33:08] truth that's right the love of the truth
[33:10] that is that's a gobble though that's
[33:11] not that's not just loving to read about
[33:13] it you love to read the Bible and come
[33:15] to church and love to be with people and
[33:16] die and go to hell that's right
[33:19] but you got to know God that means
[33:21] knowing like a personal relationship
[33:22] like you know husband and wife that's
[33:24] knowing that's it's coming together
[33:27] and that's what Satan wants he wants us
[33:28] to stay here not here okay that's what
[33:31] he wants
[33:33] so let's commune with God more
[33:35] Satan comes and tells you something it
[33:37] might be right
[33:38] he told Jesus something but Jesus
[33:41] finally got enough of him he said it
[33:42] said
[33:43] in other words I say unto you you don't
[33:45] tempt me no more
[33:47] under this condition you're in you get
[33:49] out away from me and that's the way you
[33:51] and I need to be taken under this
[33:52] condition
[33:54] leave me alone he's going to come at you
[33:55] in another matter but leave me alone in
[33:57] this one
[33:58] we got to start burying some some dead
[34:00] people that's right we're going to start
[34:02] burying some dead stuff and don't try to
[34:04] resurrect it don't divorce it and put it
[34:06] in the closet where we can reach and
[34:07] gravity if we need it no kill it right
[34:11] then you'll see that opposition writing
[34:13] off and you know what
[34:15] you know why that Satan bound A Thousand
[34:18] Years
[34:19] why has he lost his power
[34:23] and he lost his power he's lost his
[34:25] power in you that's right brother Brown
[34:27] said he's Bound by a chain of
[34:29] circumstances right in other words he
[34:31] can't work in the people like he does
[34:33] did before because we're God made
[34:36] manifest in him body spirits and soul so
[34:38] it was 144 000 who have you got to work
[34:40] through it but see he's not finished
[34:43] he's not done he's still going to come
[34:45] up but one day it's a promise right here
[34:47] one day he will end if you ever want to
[34:50] get in the Book of Ezekiel and Satan
[34:52] starts crawling around in your head take
[34:54] him to the Book of Ezekiel
[34:56] show them what we just said Satan your
[34:58] end is right here right and it's going
[35:00] to be through me right you may destroy
[35:02] this body
[35:04] but in my flesh I'm going to see God in
[35:07] my flesh now somebody else is in mind
[35:09] where you go I don't want to live in
[35:10] somebody else's body living mine all
[35:14] right let's go
