[0:01] we're gonna finally get started
[0:04] everybody's doing well today
[0:08] good to be back in the good state of
[0:10] Georgia
[0:12] what it is we uh
[0:15] had a good time at the funeral if you
[0:17] can stay having a good time but we do
[0:18] when we know that a Christian goes to
[0:20] heaven we have a good time and going
[0:23] home I'm a soldier
[0:28] revelation's five
[0:30] finally gonna read it
[0:44] now what we were
[0:47] last week we were kind of going through
[0:49] everything and and uh
[0:55] showing that
[0:57] it had to happen in the end time it
[0:59] couldn't happen any other age
[1:03] when the coming of the son of man was to
[1:05] be so real so he was actually going to
[1:09] be here in Bradford it had to be at the
[1:11] end time remember we read Luke 17 and
[1:14] 30.
[1:15] and then we at the end red revelation 5.
[1:19] all right so Revelation
[1:21] 5. now this is the scene
[1:25] and we're going to play this scene out
[1:30] but it's a reality to you and I
[1:33] but it's a scene that remember John was
[1:36] only given the
[1:39] commission to write what he saw
[1:42] not to interpret it
[1:44] but to write the scenes that he saw John
[1:47] saw one sitting on the throne that's
[1:49] what he wrote down all right he was not
[1:52] given the Revelation see the Revelation
[1:54] was given in the end time
[1:56] brother Brown said reading between the
[1:58] lines reading that love letter
[2:01] now down through the church ages they
[2:03] did read between the lines in certain
[2:05] instances because
[2:06] the father son of Holy Ghost baptism
[2:10] did not come in until nice end 325 A.D
[2:13] so before that time
[2:15] man did read between the lines the Holy
[2:17] Ghost let him read that love letter
[2:18] saying it was the Lord Jesus Christ it
[2:20] was to be that was the correct baptism
[2:22] and that there was one God and not
[2:24] another not three
[2:27] but then in Isaiah when Satan gets in he
[2:29] starts corrupting the word you know and
[2:31] so they take that baptism out and put in
[2:34] titles they take out the one God and put
[2:37] in three
[2:38] well that didn't change the word of God
[2:41] the word of God's still written like it
[2:43] was
[2:44] and uh and and really it wasn't written
[2:46] in 325 A.D the Bible wasn't really
[2:49] compiled until about the 1500s as far as
[2:51] we can read it all right as far as the
[2:54] King James version or not like 16-11
[2:56] version of the Bible but they did have
[2:58] the Scrolls they still had the Old
[3:00] Testament then you had Paul's writing
[3:01] you had all these people's writings that
[3:03] were in Scrolls and they could just get
[3:05] bits and pieces of it
[3:07] so John comes on the Isle of Patmos and
[3:10] that's why he was actually put there was
[3:13] because he was trying to take the scroll
[3:15] right remember he's trying to take the
[3:17] Scrolls and write the Bible put put the
[3:20] commentaries together Matthew Martin
[3:21] Luther King John and all that and they
[3:24] boiled him in All for 24 hours and that
[3:26] didn't kill him so they put him on
[3:27] Patmos and exiled him and then God said
[3:30] okay I got you out here by yourself
[3:32] I'm going to show you what it is to come
[3:34] because Jesus told him he said there'll
[3:36] be some standing here among you that
[3:39] will see the kingdom coming in power
[3:41] and it wasn't John John didn't see the
[3:44] actual Kingdom he saw it in Vision or in
[3:47] in a scene in heaven but you got to
[3:50] remember if something is written in the
[3:53] Bible
[3:54] in God's mind it's already happened
[3:56] right
[3:58] right see that's what that's what we got
[3:59] to realize we got to see that those
[4:01] pieces have to match
[4:04] my brother the other priests the
[4:05] matching pieces what's in heaven me and
[4:07] another brother got talking about that
[4:09] this this
[4:10] Friday I guess it was or Thursday Friday
[4:13] and uh you really never seen it that way
[4:16] but that's the truth because what
[4:18] happened in heaven is done
[4:19] finished and God's mind is over
[4:23] so this is God's mind coming to John so
[4:26] we can write it
[4:27] because this has already happened
[4:30] because
[4:30] Revelations 5 shows us already in glory
[4:35] already redeemed
[4:37] and the lamb opened in the seals but
[4:41] it has to happen in a reality form
[4:43] because John types the bride one man
[4:46] topped the entire bride all right but
[4:49] now John was a part of that bride but he
[4:52] was not commissioned to reveal anything
[4:54] that anybody sure he went back and
[4:56] Pastor the church there in Ephesus but
[4:59] um
[5:00] to be real honest with you the people at
[5:02] Ephesus
[5:04] started getting away from what they said
[5:07] and God had to bring Iranians on the
[5:09] scene
[5:10] right remember brother round said one
[5:12] Church age messenger comes he brings his
[5:14] message he goes off the scene people
[5:15] cares it on them when the people start
[5:17] eroding are are watering down the
[5:19] message God raises up another man on the
[5:22] same called irenius and what does he do
[5:24] he rebukes the previous age for getting
[5:27] away from Paul's message then what does
[5:29] he do he brings his own message takes it
[5:31] to another generation or to another
[5:33] church age right so that's the
[5:35] continuity of God so here we are in
[5:37] Revelation 3 the church ages are over
[5:39] here we are Revelation chapter 4 showing
[5:43] a scene in heaven
[5:45] right because remember in chapter 4
[5:48] verse 7 it says it shows the combat
[5:51] piece in anywhere the combat beasts are
[5:53] there's where the bride is
[5:59] go back into Ezekiel and read son of man
[6:02] prophesy and brother Brown I'm in the
[6:04] seals we're going to see where the those
[6:06] combat beats wrote out in the lion ox
[6:08] man and the eagle wrote out to combat
[6:10] the red horse the black horse The Pale
[6:12] Horse I mean the the white the red the
[6:14] black and the Pale Horse they rolled out
[6:16] and then when brother Brown saw they
[6:18] were gone on that fifth seal he said the
[6:20] Raptor had to take place on the for sale
[6:22] because there's no more combat being
[6:23] right so the combat Beast is what
[6:27] that's right it's Bible Matthew Mark
[6:29] Luke and John all right we'll get into
[6:32] that but Matthew perfectly types the
[6:34] line
[6:35] Mark the ox
[6:37] Luke was a what physician he was smart
[6:39] he was a man intelligent and then Eagle
[6:42] was John the prophetic because look what
[6:44] John did John Wayne and Richard did
[6:46] write a higher form of the scripture
[6:48] than any of the other three
[6:51] and basically him and Matthew were the
[6:53] only two
[6:55] that were literally with god with the
[6:57] Lord when he was on Earth
[6:58] Mark was a commentary and Luke was a
[7:00] commentary Luke was not actually there
[7:02] when Jesus was there all right but Luke
[7:04] says having perfect understanding he
[7:06] wrote the Book of Luke right by the holy
[7:09] spirit so chapter four shows the us
[7:11] around the throne the combat Beast there
[7:12] so that's where the bride is
[7:15] the Four B's each had six wings full of
[7:18] eyes within and rest not Dan not saying
[7:20] holy holy Lord Almighty which was what
[7:21] is and is to come
[7:25] 420 Elders you've got everybody there
[7:27] then chapter five
[7:29] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[7:31] sat on the throne now
[7:35] go back to verse 2 of chapter four
[7:38] and immediately I was in the spirit
[7:42] and behold a throne was set in heaven
[7:44] and one
[7:45] sat on the throne
[7:48] one the bride's caught up in Revelation
[7:51] 4 right through this Open Door let's
[7:53] just read it on that way I wasn't gonna
[7:55] go this way but I feel like we need to
[7:58] because you got to get that person
[7:59] sitting on the throne that's right right
[8:01] chapter four
[8:04] and after this what after these three
[8:07] after these three chapters after three
[8:09] after these seven churches one two and
[8:13] three chapter one two and three is what
[8:15] the church ages
[8:16] the last one's number seven there in
[8:18] verse 14 goes over 21 and 22.
[8:21] he'd have an inlet in here now that's
[8:23] our age after this John said what after
[8:26] the ages
[8:27] I looked and behold a door was open in
[8:31] heaven so he's on Earth looking at a
[8:34] door opening in heaven
[8:36] and we go up through that door because
[8:38] it's an Open Door all right which type
[8:41] of what rapture
[8:44] and the first voice which I heard was as
[8:46] it were of a trumpet
[8:48] what the message a voice talking with me
[8:52] which said come up hither there is your
[8:55] catching away there is your rapture
[8:58] you're catching away of the Bride not
[9:01] the coming of Christ that the whole
[9:03] world is going to see this is the secret
[9:05] bride coming of Christ because because
[9:08] John says after this what verse chapter
[9:10] 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 is the bride being
[9:14] called out of the seven Church ages
[9:16] everybody understand that say amen amen
[9:19] okay all right which said come up hither
[9:22] and I will show thee things which must
[9:25] be Hereafter what in heaven
[9:29] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[9:31] behold the throne was set in heaven and
[9:34] one sat on the throne
[9:38] where
[9:39] in heaven
[9:42] but now you're going to have to convert
[9:44] that into us
[9:46] because he's got to sit on this Throne
[9:47] before we go see him on that throne
[9:51] and he that sat was to look upon like
[9:53] Jasper and sardine stone and there was a
[9:55] rainbow around about the throne in sight
[9:57] like into an emerald and round about The
[10:00] Throne were four in 20 seats and upon
[10:02] the seats I saw Four and Twenty Elders
[10:04] sitting clothed in Black Raymond and
[10:06] they had on their head crowns of gold
[10:08] now who are the 24 elders
[10:12] The Twelve Apostles
[10:14] and the 12 Patriarchs the 12 apostles
[10:17] being
[10:19] I can't name them all but it was Matthew
[10:21] all the way through Mathias which was
[10:24] the last one it took judas's place he'll
[10:26] be sitting there because he was chosen
[10:28] to take that part then you've got the 12
[10:31] Patriarchs which is Abraham Isaac Jacob
[10:33] Joseph and I can't name them all but
[10:35] I'll find them all because I wasn't
[10:37] going this way so we'll come back maybe
[10:38] and pick them up but I want you to see
[10:40] the scene who was there
[10:42] who was there
[10:44] the people the dignitaries that were
[10:46] there all right
[10:48] and out of the throne proceeded
[10:50] lightning and thundering and voices
[10:53] and there were seven lamps of fire
[10:54] burning Before the Throne which are what
[10:58] right there seven golden candlesticks
[11:01] seven churches the same thing in
[11:03] Revelations one one on that throne and
[11:07] around about The Throne puts him where
[11:11] in the midst right
[11:14] he got a throne
[11:17] and they're around about The Throne
[11:19] where is he at
[11:21] is in the midst just like he was in the
[11:24] midst of the
[11:27] candlesticks
[11:29] that's right same scene just pulling it
[11:32] up higher it's going to Revelation one
[11:34] John saw the same thing now he's saying
[11:36] the same thing over again but he's
[11:38] seeing a little more of that same scene
[11:40] does everybody understand that same man
[11:41] all right everybody see that
[11:45] so around about The Throne puts him in
[11:47] the midst all right what was around
[11:49] about that throne
[11:51] 420 elders
[11:54] let's step over here just a second let's
[11:55] show the people on
[11:57] maybe you can see that
[12:04] which are the seven spirits of God what
[12:06] was the seventh Spirit God sent to the
[12:08] end of the church changes to what bring
[12:10] out a bride
[12:11] and Before the Throne there was a sea of
[12:14] glass
[12:15] around and said that glass
[12:18] or brass judgment already done
[12:20] in the midst of the throne and around
[12:22] about The Throne were four beasts
[12:27] in the midst of the throne
[12:31] and round about the throne
[12:36] not just around the throne see the 24
[12:38] Elders were around the throne which put
[12:41] him in the midst but this says in the
[12:43] midst
[12:44] and round about the in the midst of the
[12:47] throne
[12:48] makes it personal right here
[12:52] and around about The Throne were four
[12:54] beasts full of eyes before behind what
[12:56] the bride
[12:58] around the throne was the bride
[13:00] and the first Beast was like a lion
[13:03] see this is your combat beast from
[13:05] Ezekiel one we're going to get back to
[13:08] those combat beasts all right
[13:12] and the first Beast was like a lion
[13:14] a second like a calf
[13:16] the third had the face of a man and the
[13:19] fourth Beast was like a flying eagle not
[13:21] one sitting down on the nest or sitting
[13:23] down on the ground he was flying
[13:26] and the four beasts had each of them six
[13:29] wings about him and they were full of
[13:31] eyes Within
[13:33] within where does revelation come from
[13:35] within not your natural seeing eyes
[13:39] it comes from inside see within c means
[13:43] to understand
[13:44] okay every time you see the word see and
[13:47] it doesn't mean visual or optimia
[13:49] Optical it means understand
[13:53] full of they were full of eyes Within
[13:58] and they rest not day and night saying
[14:00] holy holy Lord God Almighty which was is
[14:02] and is to come
[14:05] and when those beasts gave glory and
[14:07] honor and thanks to him that sat on the
[14:09] throne who liveth forever and ever
[14:10] the Four and Twenty Elders fall down
[14:12] before him that sat on the throne and
[14:14] worship
[14:15] him that liveth forever and ever and
[14:17] cast their crowns Before the Throne
[14:19] saying Thou Art Worthy O Lord
[14:21] they were seeing glory and honor and
[14:23] power for thou hats created all things
[14:25] and for thy pleasure they are and were
[14:29] created so who was that on the throne
[14:32] Creator God
[14:35] you know what you said
[14:37] for these things for thou has created
[14:40] all things who created all things
[14:47] the son son of God was the creator of
[14:49] all things
[14:51] Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh Jesus
[14:54] Christ created all things
[14:56] all right we'll get to the son of man in
[14:59] a minute
[15:00] because these people
[15:04] listen
[15:06] these people
[15:09] made it to heaven
[15:11] unto the son of god mentioned
[15:14] because they died The Twelve Apostles
[15:17] the Patriarchs
[15:19] all but the people all but the bride and
[15:21] most of the Bride did there were just a
[15:22] few groups of people that standing there
[15:24] that didn't taste deaf
[15:26] now
[15:27] that was a revelation John didn't have
[15:29] that's the reason in verse 5.
[15:32] because see to me the Bible man put the
[15:34] chapters in there
[15:35] but most of the time to me a chapter
[15:37] just flows from one right into the other
[15:38] and actually in the original if you'll
[15:41] read it it just flows from one to number
[15:43] 56. it don't go chapter one through ten
[15:46] then chapter two one through twenty you
[15:49] know it goes right it just it's just a
[15:50] continuous read right so to me this is a
[15:54] continuous read all right now what's
[15:57] John going to do
[15:59] John knows
[16:01] Thou Art Worthy O Lord who did this Four
[16:04] and Twenty elders
[16:06] Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory
[16:08] and honor and Power
[16:10] for thou Hast created all things and for
[16:13] thy pleasure they are and were created
[16:16] correct
[16:19] and
[16:21] now John sees he's standing watching
[16:25] John is caught up and he's watching a
[16:27] scene the scene in chapter four
[16:31] is us there
[16:35] right
[16:36] I just proved we were there right
[16:39] chapter five John's got to tell us how
[16:41] we got there
[16:44] that's why you got to read it
[16:46] chapter four we're there we're caught up
[16:49] in a rapture
[16:51] but God had to show a group of people
[16:53] how to get there
[16:56] it had to be by what there's only one
[16:58] way you got there by Redemption
[17:00] a bloody lamb that's what everybody got
[17:03] in common in this scene right here
[17:07] and if I'm not mistaken
[17:10] I didn't see an earth a Heavenly angel
[17:12] in that whole chapter four
[17:17] you ever notice that
[17:19] I actually just caught that a little
[17:21] while ago myself
[17:24] angels are not redeemable
[17:30] he said oh that's the Four B's they're
[17:32] not angels
[17:34] Angels don't have wings
[17:37] um
[17:39] Angels don't have wings
[17:42] it's a symbolic symbols
[17:45] but there's no
[17:47] Before the Throne with the sea of glass
[17:49] missed the throne round about The Throne
[17:51] of what four beats provide the four
[17:53] behind
[17:54] Four B's and those beasts gave glory and
[17:57] thanks to Four and Twenty Elders they
[17:59] were white men
[18:02] right humans
[18:06] that had been made immortal
[18:10] angels are not there
[18:12] why this is redemption right angles have
[18:16] no part in Redemption except for to
[18:18] influence you my brother Dale's been
[18:21] preaching they cannot give you salvation
[18:24] there's only one man the Bible says one
[18:27] man
[18:28] can give you salvation
[18:31] and that's Jesus Christ amen okay and he
[18:34] was a man it's not an angel brother
[18:36] Brown said when we get to Glory we're
[18:38] not going to be Angels we're going to be
[18:40] human beings men
[18:43] women right
[18:46] so the angels are not here
[18:49] now
[18:53] watch
[18:54] he said oh well you got your you know
[18:57] your four B saying holy holy holy
[19:00] they're not Angels those are symbolics
[19:02] that's the Holy Ghost
[19:04] the Holy Ghost is not an angel as far as
[19:07] a little angel a little messenger
[19:09] he's the big a right
[19:11] Christ right but that's the spirit of
[19:14] those of us the lion ox man and the
[19:17] eagle brother Brown said we'll read it
[19:19] again here in the fourth or fifth cell
[19:20] he'll say those combat beings were put
[19:24] on here to do one thing
[19:26] and that's to help you that's right
[19:30] wherever you need in your life
[19:33] you say oh well there's Angels they're
[19:34] not Angels like the Angels were created
[19:36] in back in the old you know back for the
[19:39] world
[19:40] this was a specific
[19:43] group
[19:44] and there's only one thing that helps us
[19:46] through life and that's the Holy Ghost
[19:47] right so the Holy Ghost is a lion oxman
[19:50] an eagle which is Matthew Mark Luke and
[19:53] John the four
[19:56] the order
[19:58] not version but the four books in the
[20:01] Bible that tells you
[20:02] actually all of the Bible is written out
[20:04] of Matthew Martin Luther King John
[20:08] right where'd Paul get his writings from
[20:10] right he heard from different ones
[20:12] that's what Jesus preached exactly
[20:14] that's the word himself right was giving
[20:18] his three and a half year message did
[20:20] all of this other has come from every
[20:22] bit of this even down here now over in
[20:23] the end times where we're already you
[20:25] know up in glory in chapter four that
[20:28] come from what Matthew Martin Luther and
[20:29] John
[20:30] put into writing that happened to Jesus
[20:33] and the words that he spoke he said my
[20:35] words are what truth and life right all
[20:39] right
[20:40] so they had to be put into words right
[20:41] okay excuse me so Matthew Martin Luther
[20:44] and John
[20:45] all right so here we're talking about
[20:47] what then what is the theme of this
[20:50] whole
[20:51] actually from one through five what is
[20:53] the same Redemption
[20:56] man had fell
[20:58] man needed her savior man needed the
[21:02] Holy Ghost to keep it person clean
[21:05] and then that's what put us in glory
[21:07] right all right now we'll move over into
[21:10] chapter six in just a little bit but we
[21:13] still got a few weeks to go maybe in
[21:15] chapter five we ain't even really got to
[21:17] talking about chapter five yet
[21:20] but we gotta have a foundation we got a
[21:22] foundation all right
[21:24] let's read chapter five again and I'm
[21:27] going to read it all and then we'll come
[21:28] back
[21:29] and I saw on the right hand of him that
[21:31] sat on the throne of book written within
[21:33] and on the back side seal with seven
[21:34] sealed now remember
[21:36] who is this one sitting on the throne
[21:39] the Creator God
[21:41] Son of God Creator God the one that
[21:43] created the world right
[21:46] in that form because that's what he said
[21:48] he was
[21:49] created thou Hast created all things all
[21:51] right
[21:52] now remember when Jesus was standing
[21:54] here in flesh the Creator God was in him
[21:56] but he in that flesh was not the Creator
[21:58] right
[22:01] Paul said Peter said Thou Art the Christ
[22:03] the son of living God right now they
[22:06] knew that's why they couldn't understand
[22:07] the son of man they couldn't understand
[22:08] this flesh man standing here yet before
[22:10] Abraham was I am that's why they've got
[22:12] a hold of him they said you've been 50
[22:14] years old how in the world Abraham was
[22:15] 600 years ago you're not 600 years old
[22:18] they just didn't understand what was
[22:20] inside of that man all right so that's
[22:22] where you got to get this scene right
[22:23] right look I said Luke said the Christ
[22:26] of God the Christ of God is straight up
[22:28] yeah that was that was Landing out
[22:30] pretty pretty plain right all right
[22:33] so now and I saw in the right hand of
[22:35] him that sat on the throne who created
[22:37] God Son of God Spirit God
[22:39] red went in on the backside still with
[22:41] seven seagulls because that man is the
[22:43] one that took that book away from Adam
[22:47] right right that man is the one back in
[22:51] the Garden of Eden that took the ability
[22:53] for Adam to bring you and I forth that
[22:57] man has the on is the only person that
[23:00] has the book
[23:05] there's only one book
[23:08] right
[23:12] there's many sections in that book right
[23:15] but this book right here
[23:17] is the book of me and you this is the
[23:19] bride's book right here okay
[23:23] sit on the throne
[23:24] I'm sorry and I saw in the right hand of
[23:27] him that sat on the throne a book
[23:29] written within and on the backside
[23:31] sealed with Seven Seals
[23:35] now they had already worshiped in
[23:37] chapter four telling him he was Worthy
[23:41] he was Worthy
[23:43] Thou Art Worthy
[23:46] but somehow thou is going to have to
[23:48] become us right
[23:50] now
[23:52] and I strong saw a strong angel
[23:55] proclaiming with a loud voice
[23:57] who is worthy to open the book and to
[24:00] loose the seals thereof now you see one
[24:01] angel coming in a strong Angel a
[24:03] different angel
[24:05] and no man man man man man man
[24:09] I circled that in my Bible
[24:12] because this is talking about flesh
[24:15] man
[24:17] okay
[24:19] and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[24:22] neither under the Earth in other words
[24:24] those are buried
[24:26] was able to open the book neither to
[24:29] look their own
[24:31] and I wealth much because no man was
[24:34] found worthy to open and read the book
[24:36] neither to look their own
[24:37] now brother Branham we'll read in a
[24:40] minute while we won't read the day
[24:41] we'll start reading next week I'm not
[24:44] going to promise that but we'll start
[24:45] reading it
[24:46] so make sure you bring your books next
[24:48] week
[24:50] neither to look their own Prophet said
[24:52] all the prophets were there the Four and
[24:54] Twenty Elders were there
[24:55] everybody was down
[24:58] because remember chapter five has got to
[25:01] tell us how we got there chapter four
[25:03] shoulders already there chapter five is
[25:04] trying to tell us how to get there all
[25:06] right or showing how we got there right
[25:08] and one of the elders said unto me week
[25:11] not what he turned and looked and saw
[25:13] something excuse me behold the line of
[25:17] the tribe of Judah the root of David
[25:19] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[25:23] lose the Seven Seals
[25:25] thereof and I'll be held and low in the
[25:27] midst of the throne and of the four
[25:29] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[25:32] here appear in the lamb
[25:37] having what
[25:39] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[25:41] seven spirits of God sent forth and all
[25:44] the Earth John is telling you where
[25:46] Jesus is standing and that's in the
[25:48] golden candlesticks in the midst
[25:51] seven horns and seven eyes which are
[25:53] what the seven spirits of God sent to do
[25:56] what preach to man
[25:57] through the seven Church ages Irene is
[26:00] Paul Luther Martin Wesley Elijah all
[26:03] those people got it
[26:05] now be held in low in the midst of the
[26:07] throne
[26:09] not a round about the throne
[26:12] in the midst of the throne
[26:14] and we'll look at this scene maybe next
[26:16] Sunday
[26:17] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[26:19] seven horns and seven eyes which were
[26:21] the seven spirits of God sent forth into
[26:24] all the Earth and he
[26:28] Jesus Christ
[26:32] the lamb
[26:34] they're the only one John said behold
[26:37] the Lamb of God that takes away
[26:40] the sin of the world
[26:42] the son of man
[26:44] had to come and die right
[26:47] so he came and took the book out of the
[26:49] right hand of him that set upon the
[26:51] throne who was sitting on the throne
[26:54] Son of God
[26:57] now Jesus told us
[26:59] right back over on the other page if you
[27:01] guys go to the Bible
[27:02] he said behold I stand at the door and
[27:04] knock to him and overcome it will I
[27:06] grant to sit with me in my throne
[27:08] even as I have also overcome and I'm sat
[27:11] down with my father in his throne
[27:15] all right
[27:16] all right everybody listening
[27:19] and he came and took the book out of the
[27:22] right hand of him that set upon the
[27:23] throne
[27:26] and when he had taken the book
[27:29] son of man taking the book
[27:32] the four beasts and Four and Twenty
[27:34] Elders fell down before the lamb
[27:36] having every one of them hearts and
[27:38] golden vials full of odors which are the
[27:40] prayers of
[27:43] the
[27:44] Saints
[27:46] us
[27:48] the sainted ones brother Ram said to
[27:50] sanctify people
[27:51] and they sang a new song they bunch of
[27:54] people
[27:55] sang a new song
[27:58] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[28:00] and to open the seals thereof or thou
[28:02] what slain and hath redeemed us to God
[28:04] by thy blood out of every Kindred and
[28:07] tongue and people and Nation
[28:09] and has made us
[28:12] not the four beasts
[28:15] in that
[28:17] saying
[28:18] not the angels
[28:22] us was the bride
[28:25] and has made us
[28:28] under our God Kings and Priests
[28:32] and we shall reign
[28:35] if you look in Schofield the original is
[28:38] we shall reign over
[28:40] the Earth
[28:42] but I like this one it says on the Earth
[28:45] because that's what you're going to do
[28:46] we're going to rule and Reign where
[28:48] right here so that's the scene of the
[28:51] Bride
[28:52] and I beheld and heard the voice of many
[28:55] angels now here comes the angel
[28:58] round about the throne and the beasts
[29:00] and the elders and the number of them
[29:01] were Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands
[29:04] and thousands of thousands
[29:07] why did the Angels come in
[29:10] it was over
[29:13] so they're there now to worship
[29:16] they have no clue see this is
[29:19] I believe brother Brown said this is
[29:20] that moment of silence
[29:22] somewhere in the in or somebody was
[29:24] preaching it one time because there was
[29:25] no
[29:27] there was no angels
[29:29] worshiping
[29:31] how can you worship something that you
[29:32] don't know
[29:33] but once all that's over and the angels
[29:36] see that we all made it and we were done
[29:38] and finished and and everything and
[29:40] right here said we will rain on the
[29:41] earth that was it it's done we're
[29:44] finished
[29:45] now here comes the angels and I heard
[29:47] the voice of many angels
[29:51] round about the throne and the Beast and
[29:53] the elders and a number of them were Ten
[29:54] Thousand Times Ten Thousand and
[29:55] thousands of thousands then with a loud
[29:57] voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
[29:59] to receive power and reaches and wisdom
[30:01] and strength and honor and glory and
[30:02] blessing
[30:04] and every creature which is in heaven
[30:06] and on Earth and under the Earth judges
[30:08] are in the sea and all that of them hurt
[30:10] eyes saying blessed and honor glory and
[30:13] power be unto him that sitteth upon the
[30:16] throne and into the lamb forever and
[30:18] ever
[30:19] and the Lord be said
[30:23] so be it
[30:26] amen and the Four and Twenty Elders fell
[30:29] down and worshiped him
[30:30] that liveth
[30:32] forever and ever then John goes into the
[30:35] scene of the actual breaking of the
[30:37] seals
[30:39] because Brethren is going to tell us he
[30:40] said in Revelations 5 that's when the
[30:42] seals were open
[30:44] the next time you see that lamb chapter
[30:47] six tell us what happens but over in
[30:49] Revelation 10 you see that angel that
[30:51] man coming down that angel Mighty Angel
[30:54] Christ come down with a book
[30:56] open all right here it's closed
[31:00] there it's open all right
[31:03] so now we got to look at this
[31:08] and I'll give you something to think
[31:09] about because
[31:10] you got to see it as not two people that
[31:13] was not
[31:14] the Lamb of God
[31:16] and the Son of God standing there
[31:18] looking at each other it wasn't two
[31:20] people that's right because there's no
[31:22] two people
[31:24] that's why brother Brown I'm gonna eat
[31:25] that first seal he saw two people
[31:28] one of them had to be the God and the
[31:30] other one had to be the devil
[31:32] so there was not two people in this
[31:34] scene that was
[31:36] that was taking of the book and all that
[31:37] it was it's in symbol form because
[31:40] brother Brown said the lamb took the
[31:41] book and come and sat down on the throne
[31:44] we'll get we'll read it and we'll go
[31:45] through what brother random explained
[31:47] but you got to see though it's not like
[31:49] and and you really you can't explain it
[31:54] you really can't explain it because if I
[31:56] took two pieces or two you know Cuts
[31:59] you'd say well you got two
[32:01] it was two manifestations of God
[32:03] standing there not two persons of God
[32:06] standing there in that scene
[32:08] because the Son of God had to come to do
[32:10] what cleanse and claim the Earth this I
[32:13] mean the inside of man so the man had to
[32:16] claim the Earth he's heir of the earth
[32:17] son of God's air of Heaven inside here
[32:21] all right so you gotta you gotta look at
[32:23] it like there was two manifestations and
[32:27] then
[32:28] they come one
[32:29] but you don't do away with the other one
[32:32] you just put one inside the other one
[32:34] really is what you can do with the cups
[32:36] and set them down and say are they
[32:37] they're it's always one but you have to
[32:40] look at the two manifestations that's
[32:41] why that people in 325 A.D that's why
[32:44] they come up with all these they had an
[32:46] intelligent view of God right
[32:49] Jesus come to Earth father was up here
[32:53] Holy Ghost was over here they said well
[32:55] they must be three persons because they
[32:57] can't all be there at the same time
[33:00] because they just couldn't understand
[33:01] that God can be anywhere he wants to at
[33:03] one time he'd be in a million places at
[33:04] one time
[33:06] he's speaking to you today and he may be
[33:08] speaking to somebody in the same instant
[33:10] 4 000 miles from here right same person
[33:14] not another person the same person
[33:18] how do you think we all going to be able
[33:19] to see Jesus when we get to heaven
[33:21] we're gonna have to wait our turn I
[33:24] don't think so we say when Jesus the
[33:26] flesh
[33:27] came
[33:28] air of all things he took the book and
[33:31] when he took that book see it claimed it
[33:33] back to Adam
[33:34] he was the second Adam remember
[33:37] we'll get into that because the first
[33:38] item lost it
[33:40] but that first Adam was there of this
[33:42] Earth
[33:43] if he had not messed up and done what he
[33:45] did he would have done just what Jesus
[33:47] did
[33:48] he would have come to her he would have
[33:50] been the the heir of what
[33:52] all the Earth
[33:55] and we would have been heir to the Earth
[33:57] with him because we would have come out
[33:58] from him well see the first Adam got cut
[34:00] off what happened to the second Adam
[34:02] second Adam
[34:05] God takes back the ability from the
[34:07] first Adam
[34:09] for me and you to come the way we were
[34:11] supposed to because we came anyway
[34:14] permissive will
[34:15] but what's the end going to be the same
[34:18] thing as what the beginning was
[34:20] he just took that Holy Ghost and put it
[34:22] down inside you now
[34:24] and now he's got to work on this guy
[34:26] this outside fella
[34:29] he didn't have to work on the outside
[34:31] Adam
[34:33] before the fall
[34:36] but now he has to work on the outside
[34:37] guy me and you because we come through
[34:39] sex through a nature
[34:42] that we were given a worldly nature
[34:44] that's why they say the Bible says the
[34:46] first Adam was that was earthy
[34:48] second Adam is what Lord from Glory
[34:51] Jesus said you must be born again
[34:52] Nicodemus said I gotta go back to my
[34:54] mama's womb he said no you gotta be born
[34:56] from love in other words the Holy Ghost
[34:58] has to come down and reside in this
[35:00] human flesh now and then that makes us
[35:04] from the second Adam that makes us what
[35:06] we should have been had there not been a
[35:08] fall that's right
[35:09] when we're changed when we're standing
[35:11] in Revelation 5
[35:13] excuse me when he told us we'd be Kings
[35:15] and Priests we're standing just like we
[35:17] would have stood in in the Garden of
[35:19] Eden had not been a fall
[35:21] same
[35:23] but now let me let me let me warn you
[35:25] about something
[35:30] to a group of people that's going to
[35:32] take a body change
[35:34] this has got to be fulfilled on Earth
[35:42] this Revelations 5 has got to come down
[35:45] with that Mighty angel
[35:47] that's why Revelations 5 Revelations 10
[35:49] are together
[35:51] this has got all these people made it
[35:53] under the Son of God Revelation but
[35:55] there's a group of people that was hid
[35:56] inside of this group of people
[36:00] and the only reason they made it to
[36:01] Revelation 5 was because somebody
[36:05] stood just like I'm telling you again I
[36:07] go back to that same scripture all power
[36:09] and Heaven and Earth being given unto me
[36:12] nothing can withstand me
[36:14] not even death so once that happens then
[36:17] we go to heaven then we see all these
[36:20] things no
[36:23] the only thing to remember is after the
[36:26] ages
[36:27] will have the Holy Ghost in their soul
[36:29] that's right nobody had their sub their
[36:33] spirit and body redeemed to go in a
[36:36] Rapture right that's why the cells had
[36:39] to come was to get that if you're
[36:42] already born again you don't need that
[36:44] that's right no you need your your
[36:47] spirit and your body redeemed and that's
[36:50] what brother Brown had to come back and
[36:52] do that twine come was to get this flesh
[36:56] and the spirit underneath the road right
[36:59] to where we could go in a raptor because
[37:01] nobody else ever did that nope
[37:04] that's great what's Happening Here is
[37:08] this scene and and and you know
[37:12] probably millions of people Christians
[37:14] say well this has been this is in heaven
[37:16] boy when we get to heaven this is going
[37:17] to happen
[37:18] that's true
[37:21] but this is going to happen to somebody
[37:22] on Earth that's right now let me give
[37:25] you one more point to ponder before next
[37:28] Sunday
[37:30] revelation 3.
[37:33] brother Brown said the bride is caught
[37:34] up in Revelation chapter four and not
[37:36] seen again until Revelations 19.
[37:39] everybody understand that yeah because
[37:41] we are caught up in this Open Door in
[37:43] 4-1
[37:45] this is in heaven the rest of this is to
[37:49] the Jews
[37:50] literally happens on the Earth
[37:53] the Seal's open down here all right we
[37:56] got to go but but listen to me this has
[37:59] got to happen to somebody spiritually
[38:02] right
[38:03] Revelation 4 2 19 219 not 2 2 19.
[38:10] Revelations 4 to the chapter of
[38:12] Revelations 19 has gonna happen to a
[38:15] group of people that will not see death
[38:17] okay the rest of us or anybody will have
[38:21] to go by the grave
[38:22] have to be resurrected and this thing
[38:24] will happen but something's gonna happen
[38:26] down here on Earth but that seems to
[38:28] have a good movie
