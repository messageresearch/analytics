========================================

table is just for the light it is not for nobody else we don't want to be exclusive but God made us exclusive he's only got one bride in this end time there's one bride that's got a commission to take all the word and make all the work come to pass and not be one word off right if you say it can't be done then you need to baptism with all ago right because it can't be done that's what the Holy Ghost was give to is to lead us and guide us into all truth he's the one that wrote the Bible he's one that spoke when he was here on earth 2,000 years ago he ought to be able to keep it right there never was a time when Jesus walked out and said no man my father has been having an argument back here in the tent no he said whatever the father does I did whatever is bother said I st. Michael the same person amen I can't I can keep my story straight if it's my story cuz I was there and I did it so now what the Holy Ghost is doing to you folks is he's taking us and putting us like I said before he's putting us to where the writer of this is in us the one that wrote this what's the Holy Ghost remember men moved by the Holy Ghost Luke and Martin Wendy went around when Jesus was around and they had perfect understanding to write the Bible Paul wasn't around when Jesus was around Matt we literally Matthew and John were pretty much the only two maybe James and some of the lesser ones Peter but 90% of your Bible was written of either future things are things that were passed and they weren't even in them they weren't even in the age that they were standing there like damn Damon cherish got them in the streets when he saw us going up and down the road in them on the interstate but man that was 6000 years ago probably nobody understood that and nobody didn't understand it it's my life - what Berlin said we got to have an updated revelation nails revelation was he saw cars with headlights but there was no such thing back then he called him chariots jumping in the street Jonathan what lets bumping into each other row break he saw a road rage 6000 years ago but he didn't know what to name it it's like the encyclopedia that me and brother boys talk money yes ma'am he gave me a true original Webster's 18 whatever dictionary you're doing have a car in it it don't have computer all these different things that we have now they never had one in 1800 the thing you know even a light bulb electricity some of those things are not even in that in that dictionary so if they had to have a what an updated version now listen it didn't change it didn't change the word don't change to get an updated revelation that the Seventh Seal is you can help realize that's not an updated revelation from God that might be up something from the devil but an updated revelation keeps in the continuity of the word all the way but you and I know we have for example we do have a definition of a computer we know what that is we know what a car is we know what a buy it is we know what a terabyte we'll know what if you see one of them they didn't know that even 50 years ago you didn't have the word computer they know wait a lot remember the old could never remember who remembers the old abacus as always yes you have to set that thing out the old computer of the day he set that say ahead little balls in you you flip them over to one side 5-4 and he go it was pretty fun it's a relic now chalkboard we have a big deal I'm trying to kill time here we're having to win a big deal at month it's good that if you could go and clean the erasers for the for the teachers let's embrace your hand for those either remember that I'm not an idiot okay tiny little sides budding together you know all the way here and then somebody went all wet somebody always go are they come up behind you Nico oh yeah we don't want I don't even know that they still they sell erasers now beginning what they are they're dry you raise your earring we don't have to clean this you just go and win by you know chalk all the teachers have chalk all over their hands and then they come out with that thing that aluminum thing about that long everybody know what I'm doing man yeah and you push the button and it had some arms at one out and you put your chalk in there and when you pulled it back in it held a chalk and that them that you put chocolate free this was fifty years ago I'm still 50 years it's been 50 years that we did this and so we come from 50 years now what is it listen I mean let me tell you what jobs are created Louise wouldn't have a job if he was back in them Bob wouldn't have a job that was never created until he got here if I got that I mean really there was no social media there was no and everything now whatever thing now there's you turn this thing on in all classrooms and everybody's got one of these well you know 50 years ago we might have had one of these but it had the lines in it and we wrote with chalk yeah and just if you had an ancestor no one knew had to skate guess what you should be worth a lot of money but you see what it may not seem like with the Word of God Word of God never train whistle education never changed you still gotta go from kindergarten first second third you still that that is still the basis of everything that's going on but now the things even the same that Deanna's doing in school now they she asked me to help her in math she's in the sixth grade she's gonna sit and she's in advanced math that's the we did that in college and they're doing dots now which makes the which is in computer like I can't very what good thing name of it was I said honey you might get somebody to help you know to help you would you don't so now what I'm saying we have progressed our revelation has progressed we progressed in gone and here we are we're getting ready we're on the brink I don't think we're gonna have another decade that gains 10 years I just don't think we'll have another decade Lord I'll be 70 years old at the end of this decade so god bless you break really I'm afraid brother Holman I'm Laura and read revelation to everyone
