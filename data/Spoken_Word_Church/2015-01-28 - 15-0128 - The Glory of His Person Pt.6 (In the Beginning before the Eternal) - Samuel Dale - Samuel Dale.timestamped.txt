[2:58] depend upon you to to be what we have
[3:01] need of because you've always been that
[3:03] down through time whatever was the need
[3:06] or the hour or what it was you came on
[3:08] the scene and provided so in this hour
[3:11] we have a very great need because we're
[3:13] facing many things facing uh old age
[3:17] facing many sicknesses that are in the
[3:20] world today facing horrible things
[3:23] around the world of things that are
[3:26] happening but we know who is the one
[3:28] that can take care of all all things we
[3:30] just ask you to help us and guide us now
[3:32] forgive our sins lead us by thy Grace
[3:35] and keep us in Jesus name
[3:40] amen Revelations we've been reading this
[3:43] we still haven't got the background yet
[3:45] to speak on uh the rest of what we've
[3:48] been trying to speak about the glory of
[3:51] his person uh but we'll get there
[3:55] eventually verse 10 Revelations 1 I was
[3:58] in the spirit on the Lord's Day and
[3:59] heard behind me a great voice as of a
[4:02] trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[4:04] first and the last and what thou seest
[4:07] right in the book and send it unto the
[4:08] seven churches which are in Asia Asia
[4:13] unto a unto Ephesus and unto samarra and
[4:18] unto pergamus and unto Tira and unto
[4:21] Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto
[4:24] lady
[4:25] OA and I turned to see the voice that
[4:28] spake with me and being turned I saw
[4:30] seven golden
[4:31] candlesticks all right look and in the
[4:33] midst of the seven candlesticks one one
[4:36] like unto the son of man clothed with a
[4:38] garment down to the foot and G about to
[4:41] pouch with a golden girdle all right
[4:43] let's go over
[4:45] to John one because that's the one we've
[4:49] been using and we just use Verse
[4:52] 18 saying no man has seen God at any
[4:57] time the only begotten son
[5:00] which is in the bosom of the father he
[5:03] hath
[5:04] declared him now we want to get over to
[5:08] [Music]
[5:09] Romans and I want you to pay attention
[5:12] to the reading down to the point that we
[5:15] want to do I was going to just read one
[5:17] verse and and that but I got to look at
[5:20] it and I said no we better carry it all
[5:22] through because we will eventually uh
[5:26] get back and understand some things
[5:28] about what we're doing all right Romans
[5:32] 1210 be kindly affe
[5:35] affectioned one to another with
[5:37] Brotherly Love in honor preferring one
[5:40] another not slothful in business fervent
[5:43] in spirit serving the lord now it's
[5:45] talking about our everyday life and
[5:50] doings and what we are
[5:52] right rejoicing in Hope patient in
[5:55] Tribulation continuing instant in prayer
[5:58] distributed to the necessity of the
[6:00] Saints give to
[6:02] hospitality bless them which persecute
[6:05] you bless and curse not rejoice with
[6:08] them that do rejoice and weep with them
[6:11] that weep now look what then it says be
[6:14] of the same mind one toward
[6:18] another now watch mind not high
[6:23] things but condescend to Men of low
[6:28] estate
[6:29] be not wise in your own conceits all
[6:34] right you may be seated the Lord add his
[6:36] Blessing to the reading of the
[6:38] word
[6:40] now the point I want you to get is to
[6:43] think
[6:45] on Paul is laying all of this
[6:48] down and then he comes to to me to
[6:52] finalize it and to say all right now we
[6:55] are these things we are this we are that
[6:59] back up in the further in the chapter of
[7:03] chapter 12 but he
[7:05] says but cond to sin to Men of low
[7:10] State be not wise in your own
[7:14] conceits
[7:16] now we found out in our studies that the
[7:20] word
[7:21] condescend means
[7:23] to lower
[7:27] oneself from a
[7:31] position down
[7:33] lower into maybe another position taking
[7:37] that from condescend here
[7:39] 4829 to submit oneself to lowly
[7:43] things
[7:46] conditions Employments and things you
[7:49] know all right Webster says to
[7:52] condescend is to wave
[7:56] superiority voluntarily and assume
[7:59] equality with an
[8:03] inferior it means to STP stoop you know
[8:07] it means to
[8:08] descend but to wave superiority
[8:13] voluntarily and to assume equality or
[8:17] move down with one of being even
[8:22] inferior yes amen well I thought we
[8:26] believe that God's whole point was to
[8:31] creating man was that he could
[8:34] condescend downward you know and become
[8:38] one of us amen that's right I thought
[8:42] that was the understanding that we had
[8:44] of to point of seeing what God's great
[8:48] plan and purpose is to do to bring the
[8:52] great Eternal
[8:54] God down
[8:57] into a position I or whatever you want
[9:00] to
[9:02] say another
[9:06] form to where you and I can understand
[9:08] him amen right yes sir now what about
[9:13] the great
[9:15] Eternal doing this for you and
[9:19] I to
[9:22] condescend downward to where you and I
[9:25] are see he came in he he created us we I
[9:28] know all about that but then
[9:32] he came down to dwell with us that's
[9:36] right
[9:38] amen now that's you know I love that
[9:43] that's that's a great thing to me right
[9:46] all right now keep that in mind while
[9:49] we're going along and then you'll see
[9:51] why we read here in Romans where it says
[9:54] but condescend to Men of low estate in
[9:57] other words don't be lifted up be not
[10:00] wise in your own conceit don't be lifted
[10:03] up you know there's a lot of people
[10:04] think this world can't exist without
[10:07] them there was an old man up in New
[10:09] Holland cotton mill years ago he had a
[10:11] bunch of boys working there and he just
[10:14] thought he was in control thought he
[10:16] couldn't run without him and one day he
[10:18] got mad and went and got his boys and
[10:19] walked outside you know and he looked
[10:22] back and you know what they're still
[10:23] running he said I think we better go
[10:25] back inside you know and uh
[10:30] but a lot of people in this message
[10:31] think you can't get along without them
[10:34] you know especially preachers now they
[10:36] think that they're topnotch they got to
[10:39] do this they got to do that you know and
[10:42] uh you know they're not going somewhere
[10:45] if they're not
[10:48] preaching you know that's that's all
[10:53] right but now remember the
[10:56] point if we are supposed to
[11:01] to not look down on
[11:03] somebody like brother Brown said to
[11:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost uh make a a
[11:09] man with a man with a tuxedo on put his
[11:12] arms around one with a power overall
[11:13] something to that form or a woman with
[11:16] this fancy material dress you know hug
[11:19] up one in an old what do they call it
[11:21] Calico or something dress and call them
[11:25] sister you know and not think that they
[11:28] are of any
[11:29] greater
[11:31] value you
[11:34] know you condescend see and that's what
[11:37] God has done to you and I so that's what
[11:39] that's what I'm trying to get you to
[11:41] look
[11:43] at to help us to
[11:47] understand all right now we covered this
[11:51] past Wednesday dealing a lot with
[11:54] it of how that we made sure and even
[11:57] brought up a lot of the quotes that we
[12:00] had brought before on the message see I
[12:03] believe God is
[12:06] real you well God is just a
[12:09] Spirit Well now where did you get that
[12:11] from well the Bible
[12:13] says well the Bible says he's a being
[12:16] right the Bible says he has hands he has
[12:19] a heart the Bible says he has feet the
[12:22] Bible says he had a place to
[12:25] live H and see that's what we've been
[12:28] talking about even the prophet would
[12:29] bring out so many times that God is Not
[12:33] Like the
[12:38] Wind he say he's a being
[12:42] right all right he said he cannot on
[12:46] adoption in 1960 cannot be a being and
[12:49] then be
[12:52] omnipresent he abides in a place because
[12:56] he is a being why would you pray for the
[12:59] Holy Ghost if it's omnipresent that he
[13:02] FS every crack and crevice see he'd be
[13:04] in you he
[13:05] said right what's he trying to emphasize
[13:10] Fellowship 1960 why would you seek the
[13:13] Holy Ghost it would be in
[13:16] you if God is just like we think about
[13:19] him to be just floating
[13:21] around but he has a dwelling place
[13:25] because he's a
[13:27] being things that are to be 1965 can't
[13:31] be just like the wind over the Earth
[13:34] because he's a being he just isn't a
[13:37] myth he dwells in a place called Heaven
[13:41] you remember these it wasn't so from the
[13:44] beginning 1960 but God could not be just
[13:47] like the air is because God has a
[13:51] Dwelling Place God is not a myth God is
[13:55] a
[13:56] being we would see Jesus 19 57 God is
[14:00] just not like the
[14:02] air but he's a
[14:06] being who is this mzc
[14:09] 1965 God is a being he's not like the
[14:12] wind he dwells in a
[14:15] house but being
[14:19] omniscient all
[14:21] right he then can be omnipresent you
[14:25] remember that by being omnicient to know
[14:29] all things he knows where he needs to be
[14:32] and can be there to record as I always
[14:35] say he's not on the moon today if
[14:37] nobody's on the moon why be on the moon
[14:40] he he doesn't have to be all right but
[14:43] my point has been to you to get one
[14:45] thing to you that he's a being he's
[14:50] real it's not just to say well God's a
[14:54] spirit no man can see
[14:57] God well the Bible said where we read it
[15:01] there that the son which was in the
[15:04] bosom of the father has brought him out
[15:08] in the open or declared
[15:11] him right see then he's real all right
[15:17] now that's my
[15:18] point he's real but then when the Bible
[15:22] would make statements we try to figure
[15:25] that out
[15:27] intellectually without Waiting for God
[15:30] to bring it to us by Revelation by
[15:33] Spirit you know all right and in doing
[15:37] that we make up our own mind as to what
[15:40] God is and what's going on and what this
[15:44] is and that
[15:47] is and the Bible will make some
[15:49] outstanding statements you know like
[15:52] I've always said we don't believe in
[15:54] three gods or nothing like that but the
[15:56] Bible said the God and father of our
[15:58] Lord Jesus Christ Christ that makes
[16:00] about five of
[16:02] them but it's never taught nothing like
[16:05] that that's our way because of the way
[16:09] that we put uh meanings to
[16:13] words and I want to get to that in a
[16:15] minute you know you put we put meanings
[16:17] to
[16:20] words
[16:22] uh they had a lot of problems with
[16:24] brother bram's message are still due in
[16:27] the foreign field
[16:29] of coming up with some of the words that
[16:31] he
[16:32] uses and I well remember see the the
[16:37] point that I was reading him when he was
[16:39] talking about that they would go out and
[16:41] they would go
[16:44] singing and they would catch the fish
[16:47] and I thought what is
[16:50] sing we call it
[16:53] sanning all right well see I did I had
[16:56] to look up see what that meant
[16:59] you know I'm not that smart I'm sorry
[17:01] you think I am a lot of but I went to
[17:04] the dictionary and found out what the
[17:06] word heat the way they spelled it and I
[17:09] found out it was the same old word we
[17:11] was using that we say we're sing in them
[17:15] Creeks but see we get it all figured
[17:20] out as that it's got to be that
[17:24] away all
[17:26] right and we we say well well there's no
[17:29] way that that can be
[17:32] right you know why because we have set
[17:36] within
[17:38] ourselves
[17:39] uh through our thoughts we have
[17:43] developed our our uh point of
[17:46] thinking you know and like I've always
[17:49] said to you about you know a horse is
[17:51] measured in
[17:53] hands well whose
[17:56] hands well you're just a dumb many don't
[17:58] realize that they meant like a 9 in hand
[18:02] well I'm just a dummy enough to say
[18:04] brother our lines was about 12 or 13 you
[18:06] know and you know I kidding Brother Ray
[18:09] while they go about it I said yours is
[18:11] kind of small compared to his well
[18:14] that's
[18:15] true but it's a way we have a figuring
[18:18] it out what is an inch you know I in C
[18:21] inch you misunderstand my
[18:24] pronouncing well that's what we figured
[18:27] out to be an inch
[18:31] we say it's a foot that that Pew is so
[18:34] many feet
[18:36] long well whose
[18:38] foot
[18:40] somewhere they
[18:42] developed a
[18:44] word that would have the meaning to uh
[18:49] you know in their culture their doings
[18:51] and things and then you go from America
[18:54] to an inch to Germany for instance and
[18:57] it's called what is it um it's not
[19:01] inches metrics
[19:04] metrics and then we go to pounds and
[19:06] they go to some other word you know well
[19:12] see it's because that we develop those
[19:15] ways of
[19:17] communicating what we are trying to talk
[19:22] about all
[19:23] right now I read you the statement there
[19:27] the other day we want to start back off
[19:28] right there again on it because it's a
[19:30] very direct way of understanding uh to
[19:34] me to be able to get a point so go ahead
[19:36] brother and pull up number one this is
[19:40] paragraph 55 through 57 who is this Mel
[19:44] chedic and look what he's talking
[19:50] about and he says now notice now his
[19:54] attribute and the attribute was first
[19:57] God
[19:58] the
[20:00] thought well like I said we get it all
[20:02] we're we're so spiritual now that word
[20:04] god should be translated to
[20:08] Elohim you
[20:11] know well why do that when we're
[20:13] supposed to know what the word god means
[20:15] right the word God just doesn't mean
[20:18] object of
[20:20] worship that's true that's what it means
[20:23] yes but it also means we can use it for
[20:26] the eternals the Elohim the
[20:29] self-existing
[20:34] right that's what I don't understand
[20:36] about people with their education the
[20:38] more education you get it's supposed to
[20:40] make you more
[20:44] simple
[20:46] right but it doesn't it makes the people
[20:50] big and like I always say you go up
[20:54] north not throwing off on the Northern
[20:56] people but go up North
[21:00] and you say what do you want for what do
[21:03] you want do I want some maters and
[21:09] ters they don't never ask you what you
[21:12] say
[21:13] it they go off laughing like crazy at
[21:17] you cuz they know what maters and ters
[21:24] are but then if I have sat down and they
[21:27] have said what do you want I said I want
[21:28] some tomatoes and some
[21:35] potatoes they said what do
[21:38] you uh your language is mixing you up a
[21:40] little bit what do you mean you want I
[21:42] want some maters and
[21:45] ters you get what I
[21:48] mean and see brother random will say
[21:51] something and and our mind is locked on
[21:54] that word instead of listening to the
[21:57] rest of what said that's
[22:01] right because we we've got it figured
[22:04] out so then we're going to translate it
[22:08] we need you know a new Bible we need all
[22:10] of these things we need to upgrade the
[22:13] message notice now his attribute then
[22:17] the attribute was first
[22:22] Elohim see we're straightening him out
[22:25] we're doing this that or the other we
[22:27] done lost a whole thought of what he's
[22:29] saying see the word God is in the Bible
[22:32] does have any problem with it all right
[22:36] Hebrews 1 even makes it in great big
[22:38] capital letters and
[22:40] says God in Su times and diverse manners
[22:44] he didn't have any trouble figuring out
[22:45] who it was but look the attribute itself
[22:48] all in one without being
[22:51] expressed okay now without being
[22:54] expressed
[22:55] okay then when he expressed secondarily
[22:57] he became then the
[22:59] word and then the word was made flesh
[23:01] and dwelt Among Us St John the first
[23:04] chapter and the first verse notice this
[23:06] is in the beginning but before the
[23:15] Eternal
[23:17] now in the beginning but before the
[23:26] eternal
[23:29] that's not
[23:32] right un it's according to what you're
[23:36] thinking
[23:39] right you know I gave them and I'm not
[23:41] giving this a c of any point or anything
[23:43] I'm giving it to get a point in your
[23:47] mind that's exactly
[23:50] right and to me there's no better way of
[23:54] saying it than the way he said it that's
[23:57] right
[24:01] and when we get to the one in a minute
[24:02] where he
[24:04] said God was the first
[24:10] creation there's no better way of saying
[24:12] it you know what it
[24:14] done it
[24:16] confused the wise and
[24:23] prudent all right but let's stay on that
[24:26] just a minute
[24:28] in the beginning but before the
[24:33] Eternal you said but but
[24:37] Eternal but see who came up with the
[24:41] word
[24:48] Eternal come on in the Greek or the
[24:52] Hebrew one is one is Eon and the other
[24:54] is Aon and and then we go to the
[24:57] familiar one with all of us to use the
[24:59] word
[25:03] zoee but who came up with the word
[25:07] Eternal it may not have existed
[25:14] until maybe Moses used it first we'll
[25:17] just use that but you know that's about
[25:20] 3,000
[25:24] years from the garden to
[25:26] there
[25:28] right 2,000 to the flood come on
[25:35] and when they came up with the word
[25:38] Eternal it was to express
[25:42] something
[25:44] amen
[25:46] right was to express what they were
[25:48] talking
[25:50] about so somebody developed the
[25:56] word
[25:59] we see
[26:00] then in other languages it has different
[26:04] meanings to
[26:07] it
[26:12] Zoe I use Aon and Eon because one of
[26:15] those is actually one of them is Eon
[26:17] which means Eternal one of them is a a
[26:19] word that runs right so close to Eternal
[26:21] until it's just but it's not
[26:25] Eternal is to not to be smart but just
[26:28] to tell you we do know a few things
[26:31] because I study things
[26:33] out you know when I hear it all
[26:37] right so the prophet said in the
[26:42] beginning well the beginning has a
[26:44] beginning now beginning has a beginning
[26:45] so it's a beginning where's the
[26:46] beginning he's talking
[26:48] about what is he simply
[26:53] saying what is simply the prophet saying
[26:59] that there was a time that we could not
[27:03] comprehend that's right in any form
[27:06] whatsoever the Eternal God right
[27:10] whatever you want to call him Elohim
[27:12] self-existing
[27:13] Zoe whatever you want to call
[27:17] it there was a time we couldn't do
[27:22] that but then back there he dwelt
[27:25] totally alone that's right
[27:28] just with his
[27:30] thoughts
[27:34] right and by
[27:36] being what he
[27:39] was he said well how could you express
[27:42] this
[27:46] person that never had a
[27:49] beginning never will have an
[27:52] ending how would you express
[27:56] that he said well the closest thing
[28:00] we've got to our
[28:02] concept of mankind and our thoughts is
[28:04] to use the word
[28:07] Eternal and the prophet would say in the
[28:10] beginning now if you'll listen to him on
[28:13] a lot of messages you'll get finally one
[28:16] thought in your mind this way he's doing
[28:19] he's not just using that right there is
[28:21] the only time he speaks so oddly as we
[28:24] would call it or maybe about the word
[28:27] beginning he said there was the
[28:29] beginning when they was nothing
[28:35] right and he said
[28:37] then we're going back there to the
[28:40] beginning and then he stops at a
[28:46] place and he says now they in the
[28:51] garden he said in the
[28:55] beginning and he says there's no
[28:59] time
[29:01] right
[29:05] right then he says well then they had
[29:08] seven days that on six days they created
[29:11] and he rested the
[29:15] seventh but there's no days counted at
[29:19] that
[29:20] time oh yes it was CU day one and day
[29:23] two and day three you ain't even
[29:26] listening
[29:29] time never began until the
[29:31] fall right you need those
[29:35] quotes or is that sensible enough right
[29:39] so the time beginning like we think
[29:42] about it begin
[29:44] there and God's
[29:47] thinking he was in the
[29:52] beginning and that was before the
[29:55] Eternal right
[29:59] right see we we've got to make now see
[30:03] get my point I tried to get it over the
[30:04] other day but I know it's not
[30:06] it's when you say Eternal you are making
[30:10] it something
[30:13] right no I'm not it's just oh come
[30:18] on like brother R said one time truth's
[30:20] hard to
[30:21] preach lies
[30:25] easy oh boy wouldn't it something back
[30:27] there was it father son Holy Ghost oh
[30:29] there was all there was three Gods back
[30:31] there and then one of them talked to the
[30:32] other one the other one said well I'll
[30:33] go down and I'll do this and I'll do
[30:35] that and we say we can understand
[30:40] that yeah it's a
[30:43] lie it's a fictitional
[30:46] story and all that touches your inward
[30:49] beings cuz there's no truth to
[30:53] it but what do you think about the word
[30:56] eternal
[30:59] then we say it is like a
[31:02] circle which signifies that it has no
[31:06] beginning and no
[31:09] ending that's words to explain that's
[31:13] right
[31:14] right when you made it a circle you made
[31:17] it
[31:20] something when you said God is
[31:24] eternal you made a word
[31:29] that develops your thought into
[31:37] words all
[31:41] right in the
[31:43] beginning but before the Eternal notice
[31:46] put it back up Brothers we'll read
[31:48] on look what he says about this before
[31:53] the
[31:53] Eternal this
[31:56] beginning
[31:58] this in the beginning but before the
[32:01] Eternal notice in the beginning was the
[32:05] word when the time began it was word but
[32:10] before it was word it was attribute a
[32:15] thought then it was expressed in the
[32:18] beginning was the expression the
[32:21] word all right he says now we're getting
[32:24] to where this
[32:25] MDC you know
[32:28] was and look what he says about him he
[32:31] he is first being was Spirit God
[32:35] Supernatural all right the great Eternal
[32:37] second he begin to form himself towards
[32:40] flesh in a theophany it's called the
[32:44] word a
[32:46] body this then is the state he was in
[32:49] when he met mzd I mean Abraham and was
[32:52] called mzd he was in the form of
[32:56] theophany now we'll get to that and
[32:58] prove it in a few
[33:00] minutes so now he's done
[33:03] used
[33:09] Eternal
[33:11] theophany and you know we'll keep
[33:14] ongoing that he uses the word
[33:21] logos and he uses the word Son of
[33:25] God right
[33:30] all
[33:31] right what about
[33:35] it what about all those
[33:42] attributes what about it go to number
[33:44] two and let's read it questions and
[33:46] answers on Genesis 537 7
[33:50] [Music]
[33:53] 29 now if God created man in his own
[33:56] image
[33:57] and his own likeness what kind of a man
[34:00] did he
[34:01] create now remember last Wednesday we
[34:05] emphasize that a good bit it says let us
[34:08] make man in our own image which was
[34:12] father and
[34:15] son that can't be two
[34:19] people but yet the man he creates is in
[34:22] the image of father and son that's right
[34:26] amen
[34:27] okay he's a spirit man now if you'll
[34:30] notice after he had made all the
[34:32] creation and created a spirit man you
[34:35] know the close reading of the scripture
[34:36] and he find he gives him Dominion of the
[34:38] cattle who has the Dominion of over all
[34:40] the things the spirit man he was in
[34:43] other words Adam the first man in the
[34:45] lower creations of God the first
[34:47] creation was God himself
[34:52] right now we got a word creation to deal
[34:55] with
[34:59] because a creation deals with a
[35:01] beginning
[35:06] right
[35:08] right that's right in our human
[35:12] terminologies of the word
[35:15] creation it had a
[35:20] beginning but he's not having any
[35:23] problems with talking about the first
[35:26] creation was God himself now once then
[35:29] out of now this is back before in this
[35:33] part we were talking about before the
[35:36] Eternal he hasn't come over to create
[35:39] yet he's describing what he was before
[35:43] he moved over to create come on get to
[35:46] get it right then see the first creation
[35:49] was God himself then out of God came the
[35:51] logos we don't use the word theophany we
[35:54] don't use the word word which was the
[35:57] son of
[36:01] God now this is back before anything
[36:04] ever
[36:10] began and he says Son of God then out of
[36:13] the logos which was the
[36:16] word in the beginning was the word and
[36:19] the Word was with God and the Word was
[36:21] made and the Word was God and the Word
[36:24] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us out of
[36:27] the Loos came forth the
[36:31] man out of the Loos Son of God
[36:35] theophany came a
[36:38] man and that man is the spirit man of
[36:42] Genesis one I mean know what it is you
[36:45] get over to two I think it is and you
[36:47] get to the physical man right all
[36:50] right just thinking about how a prophet
[36:53] can use these words so easily to him
[36:56] until it just flows you've heard him say
[37:00] I've got in my mind now we're standing
[37:03] upon the
[37:04] baners and looking over and watching all
[37:08] of this come into
[37:10] being I told you I said he done that way
[37:13] just like Moses
[37:15] wrote the first five books of the
[37:18] Bible Well he got it from God right all
[37:22] right and he was standing up there
[37:24] looking over the banisters
[37:28] you know in his
[37:29] mind
[37:32] thinking and he says in the beginning
[37:35] before the
[37:37] Eternal he said the first creation was
[37:39] God himself and out of God came the
[37:42] logos what is he
[37:46] saying simple simple
[37:49] terminologies what is he
[37:53] saying he's saying this is the only one
[37:57] way Humanity will ever understand the
[38:01] great Eternal
[38:03] God right and you see that Theologian
[38:07] sitting there knowing he knows his
[38:09] wording and what he's
[38:12] speaking but that Theologian says
[38:16] uh-uh I can't follow that line well give
[38:20] me your line well I I don't I don't know
[38:22] how to explain it but I don't agree with
[38:25] that now if you tell me come on you ever
[38:29] tell me you don't know how to explain it
[38:31] but I don't agree with you I'm going to
[38:32] tell you zip the lip because you're
[38:34] making a blabber that's right that's the
[38:37] best way to say
[38:39] it because you can't tell me I'm wrong
[38:42] unless you know I'm
[38:45] wrong that's
[38:47] right right yes sir you said well you're
[38:50] wrong well what you gonna do show me
[38:52] right you can't show me if you can't
[38:55] show me the truth that makes both of us
[38:59] wrong
[39:01] right that's right which that's what
[39:03] people are do I don't agree with brother
[39:05] Dale well show me where he's wrong well
[39:07] I I don't know how to explain it but I
[39:10] don't agree with
[39:13] him what you mean is your head's so big
[39:16] you can't shrink it low enough to listen
[39:17] to nobody
[39:19] else is that a good
[39:23] definition cuz if I tell you you're
[39:25] wrong you better believe I'll tell you
[39:28] why that I believe you're wrong cuz I'm
[39:32] not going to say you're wrong if I don't
[39:35] believe you're wrong and if I believe
[39:37] you're wrong I'm going to have the way
[39:39] to explain it right I'm going to at
[39:42] least say this this this this this don't
[39:45] go with it right all right but you
[39:50] understand but by using the word
[39:55] eternal we make it a starting
[40:00] point now listen to
[40:02] this when we say the word Eternal we're
[40:06] making it a starting point when the own
[40:10] the when our own word is condemning us
[40:12] because if it is eternal it had no
[40:15] starting
[40:19] point are you with
[40:22] me when you say Eternal you're making it
[40:24] a starting point when you say beginning
[40:26] you're making it a starting point when
[40:28] you say creation you're making it a
[40:29] starting point right and I thought that
[40:32] was the Revelation to this age that
[40:35] Jesus
[40:37] Christ was the beginning of the creation
[40:39] of
[40:44] God you see why we don't know what the
[40:46] prophet is
[40:48] brought in religious matters or terms we
[40:52] use the word
[40:54] Eternal to signify ify that there has to
[40:58] be some way that this one that we're
[41:01] talking about has
[41:04] condescended into
[41:06] words
[41:08] right that's right he's condescending
[41:12] into the ability to be expressed by
[41:15] words amen that's right are you with me
[41:19] amen sure it took a prophet to get them
[41:23] words come on right
[41:27] but by him condescending the way he
[41:32] did to a
[41:34] lower level as we called it or whatever
[41:37] we read of
[41:40] Websters when the superior come down to
[41:45] rest with the inferior that's right
[41:48] right that's right
[41:50] amen we developed a thing called
[41:54] speech and you know is not odd that
[41:56] that's what the prophet would be saying
[41:59] he said
[42:01] logos he said that
[42:08] speech now come on
[42:11] folks who created all things
[42:18] right well God created all things he
[42:21] just God he just created
[42:25] all
[42:26] well why does the bible so emphatically
[42:29] state that the word was a Creator that's
[42:34] right and that Jesus Christ was that
[42:36] word that's
[42:38] right amen all
[42:41] right would you understand what I mean
[42:44] we use the word Eternal to
[42:48] signify
[42:50] that we have no way of understanding
[42:54] this but we've developed a
[42:58] word that will bring it into
[43:03] meaning that we can have something that
[43:06] means what we're
[43:11] saying
[43:14] Eternal
[43:16] well so the first creation was God
[43:20] himself out of the logos out of the god
[43:24] came the logos out of the logos came the
[43:29] Son of
[43:36] God which was the
[43:40] word
[43:43] no Son of
[43:48] God we use the word Son of God as a
[43:51] beginning point or son of a person or a
[43:55] baby born son daughter
[43:58] whatever meaning a person or something
[44:01] coming into
[44:04] being now brother brandham is using the
[44:06] word Son of
[44:08] God and he's definitely using the word
[44:11] Son of God is the
[44:15] creator you see why the trinitarians
[44:17] come up with it so much and say well
[44:19] they've got to be two there was a father
[44:22] and a
[44:24] son they've got be at least two so then
[44:27] we can call the Holy Spirit and make a
[44:28] three out of
[44:32] it one of these days we will understand
[44:35] why your Prophet said it like
[44:37] this he said and God sent his soul back
[44:43] on the day of
[44:45] Pentecost in the form of the
[44:49] baptism of the Holy
[44:53] Spirit right do you understand that
[45:02] right we'll get back to a lot of things
[45:04] we're not
[45:07] finished but why not think of the word
[45:11] Eternal as to think of it as
[45:15] that the great Eternal God is going
[45:22] to unveil
[45:24] himself
[45:28] is going to
[45:32] condescend
[45:35] downward and be able to express
[45:42] himself
[45:47] right see God is coming into being now
[45:51] you know what brother Brown
[45:53] said he said now there's no such
[45:56] thing as God sitting up
[46:00] there and he sees the world in
[46:04] sin so he questions around as anybody
[46:08] wantan to go
[46:11] down and said his son stepped up and
[46:15] said Daddy I'll
[46:20] go he said now that's
[46:24] trinitarianism
[46:29] he said he never sent a
[46:34] son he came
[46:37] himself that's right now you're not
[46:42] Trinity that's
[46:45] right but we could go to a Oneness
[46:47] church today and I watched him in
[46:50] Jamaica as I begin to talk of some of
[46:52] these things to him in that Oneness
[46:55] convention that I speaking there it's
[46:57] crazy how I wound up there but I did
[47:01] and you know they were just
[47:04] rejoicing I mean the things I'd bring
[47:06] out they were just rejoicing when you're
[47:08] sitting looking at wonder wonder in the
[47:10] world like God are
[47:12] saying and they were rejoicing over the
[47:15] things I was bringing out how
[47:19] that it wasn't that God sent a
[47:22] son but that he came himself right amen
[47:26] amen you know why there's
[47:29] rejoicing because that is West
[47:37] Doctrine you say are you saying brother
[47:39] BR said no no I'm not saying that now
[47:40] you don't be stupid with
[47:43] me brother R never taught nothing like
[47:48] that because you see I tried to
[47:51] illustrate it the other night with you
[47:52] and I wonder how many remembers it
[47:57] you remember the other night when it was
[47:59] brother brandom's quote all God was he
[48:03] poured into
[48:04] Christ all Christ poured into the
[48:07] church you realize what you just done if
[48:11] all God was poured into Christ and there
[48:14] is no
[48:15] God and if all Christ is poured into the
[48:18] church there is
[48:20] no God nowh but what's in you and you're
[48:24] right in the middle of the Devil's trap
[48:26] to try to make you think he's
[48:30] God well are you trying to correct
[48:32] brother Brandon no way I'm trying to not
[48:37] cause it but to get us to understand why
[48:40] would he be saying things like
[48:46] that but you see that's the problem we
[48:50] we we have to empty a place and move it
[48:52] over into another place and then we
[48:55] empty that that place and move it over
[48:56] into another why not leave it
[49:00] alone that's
[49:04] right why not leave it then that I can
[49:10] pray to my Father in
[49:14] heaven and know he's there
[49:18] right that Jesus could pray to his
[49:22] father and communicate with him
[49:27] see one of these days you realize what
[49:28] brother R's saying when he says let us
[49:31] he said father and
[49:36] son that's two
[49:38] people but it wasn't two people to
[49:41] him
[49:44] right see he never emptied a space he
[49:48] left it when you say all God was he
[49:52] poured into
[49:54] Christ
[49:56] you're exactly right all Christ into the
[50:00] church why
[50:03] listen do we believe the
[50:06] prophet do you believe the quote where
[50:08] he said that we would receive a message
[50:12] of cheer down through the endless ages
[50:16] after this world is over right do you
[50:19] believe
[50:22] that now that's what he said right
[50:26] so then just remember all I know you're
[50:29] going to say brother Dale you just
[50:31] interpreted it well what are you
[50:35] doing wake up sensible enough one time
[50:39] to realize what you're doing you're
[50:41] self-interpreting
[50:45] you interpreted what I'm talking
[50:51] about all that God was going to reveal
[50:54] to mankind
[50:56] in this
[50:57] world was put in Jesus
[51:00] Christ that didn't leave him out of
[51:04] it and all that would ever be
[51:09] revealed in this world was put in the
[51:13] church or is being put in the
[51:15] church now let's see if that's right see
[51:19] where's your scripture brother Dale all
[51:22] right according to the prophet in the
[51:25] the Revelations 1 we've been reading
[51:27] from when it says a revelation that God
[51:29] give Jesus to give to
[51:32] John he said there was things that
[51:36] Jesus you believe it didn't
[51:41] understand that's right he said didn't
[51:43] know when he's coming
[51:46] right right that's
[51:49] Bible no man knows the day nor the hour
[51:51] that's
[51:53] Bible and so then
[51:56] he said but at this present time when he
[51:59] comes to John O patmas he understands
[52:02] God he said he didn't even know his part
[52:04] in the
[52:06] Kingdom that's your words to your
[52:10] prophet he said but now he understands
[52:13] when he comes to John and can tell John
[52:16] these things what about telling John
[52:18] what would go in the second third fourth
[52:20] fifth and sixth seventh Church age
[52:22] before John was ever into the age at all
[52:25] ad 9596 that's somewhere pised in a
[52:28] little bit of Paul had some of the 53s
[52:30] of
[52:31] Paul right but he certainly didn't know
[52:33] what was going to go on in the next two
[52:35] or three ages seventh ages no but he did
[52:38] by Revelation that's
[52:40] right as Moses could write what had been
[52:44] John could write what will be are you
[52:48] following
[52:50] me then what do you think about
[52:54] it
[52:59] see what we're seeing is the
[53:03] condescending of the great
[53:05] Elohim self-existing
[53:10] one the revealing or condescending of
[53:14] that great Eternal
[53:17] one so that we can
[53:21] understand or
[53:23] see what he's been been
[53:27] doing
[53:29] okay let's read that now so go ahead
[53:31] with number
[53:35] three let's read
[53:39] this this is taken from Christ Min God
[53:41] revealed preaching
[53:43] 63 now God's Great secret mystery he had
[53:46] before the foundation of world now back
[53:48] in the back part of God's mind what
[53:50] about that one if you think brother
[53:52] random don't make some bold statements
[53:54] of understanding
[53:55] what is a theologian going to do when a
[53:57] man says back in the back part of God's
[54:00] mind well we can't even understand the
[54:03] front
[54:04] part right then you're going to go in
[54:07] the back
[54:10] part now back in the back part of God's
[54:12] mind there was something that he was
[54:13] trying and was going to achieve he had a
[54:16] motive in doing it in order to let
[54:17] himself be expressed because first there
[54:20] wasn't even a Moon Star atom molecule or
[54:22] anything he was God but he actually
[54:25] wasn't God at that time because God is
[54:27] an object of worship and there was
[54:28] nothing to worship him so in his great
[54:31] mind now you know later what he said he
[54:32] created angels worship him all right
[54:34] made him God so in his great mind he
[54:37] created these
[54:40] attributes now excuse me let me reread
[54:43] so in his great mind he wanted these
[54:47] attributes to be
[54:51] expressed and in him was love
[54:55] and these are the attributes and him was
[54:58] to be
[55:00] father and him was to be
[55:05] son yes
[55:07] sir now this is back before the
[55:11] world cuz you got to bring the son into
[55:13] being let him create the world come on
[55:16] stay with me in what I'm
[55:18] thinking in him was love and him was to
[55:20] be a father and him was to be son and
[55:22] him was to be a savior and him was to be
[55:24] a Healer and all these great attributes
[55:27] that we see already expressed they were
[55:29] in
[55:32] God now you know that I've always taught
[55:34] you and I believe it God never gained no
[55:38] attributes after he got here that's now
[55:41] you show me one he gained after he got
[55:44] here well I don't believe that Tak well
[55:46] show me one he got show me one attribut
[55:49] he displayed that he didn't have in him
[55:51] before the world and I'll show you one
[55:54] scripture I am God and I change
[55:59] not so you're making him
[56:01] change accusing me of being something
[56:03] and then what are you
[56:05] doing these
[56:07] attributes where these attributes in God
[56:11] to be a savior healer deliverer all of
[56:13] the things where they in
[56:16] God you've got the little drawing that
[56:19] Terrence gave
[56:21] you so if you would look at that
[56:23] drawing
[56:25] and I've done the best I can do to try
[56:27] to pick up a few things by doing it but
[56:30] just look at the little drawing that you
[56:33] have if you didn't get one raise your
[56:36] hand Terence give you
[56:38] one it's on the
[56:40] board now
[56:43] watch
[56:48] Eternal
[56:51] attributes while he was still in the
[56:54] beginning
[56:55] but before the
[56:59] Eternal see we think he developed these
[57:01] attributes as he came forth uh-uh now
[57:05] now that's making him
[57:06] change you're you're getting into the
[57:08] wrong
[57:10] situation he doesn't develop attributes
[57:12] he displays attributes right all right
[57:15] but look at his
[57:16] attributes was to be a father was to be
[57:19] a son was logos savior healer theophany
[57:24] Christ
[57:26] cuz see we we I don't even really didn't
[57:29] want to use this word
[57:31] Christ but and there'll be a couple of
[57:33] words I don't want to use but I will use
[57:34] them okay that don't make sense but does
[57:37] to me but see that word
[57:42] Christ we signify as being more coming
[57:46] into being through the Christ the angel
[57:49] of the
[57:50] Covenant uh you know and that's where he
[57:53] comes into being but remember you had to
[57:55] be Christ back
[57:58] there before the world ever
[58:02] begun he had all of these attributes and
[58:04] there's many many more attributes to be
[58:07] brought in I just wrote those out as a
[58:09] being where you can
[58:11] understand but all of that equals
[58:15] speech or
[58:22] word it was already there
[58:25] if not where'd it come
[58:28] from well it came into
[58:30] being you're not even thinking mentally
[58:34] if you can see something come into being
[58:36] you're seeing it
[58:37] displayed all
[58:40] right he came over here to display his
[58:42] attributes right all of these attributes
[58:46] was in this great person that we talk
[58:49] about to call him God Elohim
[58:51] self-existing um you use words yahs and
[58:55] things like that cuz those words are in
[58:57] the
[59:01] Bible but do you believe it that
[59:04] way well I don't really know where I
[59:06] believe well then do I need to reread
[59:11] again I just read from what we read that
[59:15] talks of theophany it speaks of Son of
[59:18] God it speaks of attributes it speaks of
[59:22] logos it speaks of theophany
[59:29] I didn't say
[59:32] that your Prophet said that and he said
[59:36] these are his
[59:38] attributes
[59:40] right and see he always had those
[59:44] attributes that's
[59:47] right just like you were in your
[59:53] daddy right
[59:56] as a germ of
[59:58] life you didn't develop in your daddy
[1:00:01] after your daddy got on up into
[1:00:03] age it's just like the prophet would say
[1:00:06] every Apple that was ever on the tree
[1:00:10] was in the seed that was put in the
[1:00:13] ground right all
[1:00:16] right are you with me
[1:00:19] amen yeah well brother Dale I can
[1:00:22] understand a little bit and I'm trying
[1:00:23] to express your thoughts cuz that's the
[1:00:25] way I think you know I try to use this
[1:00:27] old thing up here too that you can say
[1:00:30] well I can understand father I can L God
[1:00:32] savior healer theophany Christ you know
[1:00:35] but it's hard for me to understand that
[1:00:37] word son back
[1:00:40] there said because that would be
[1:00:44] bordering on the line of Eternal
[1:00:50] sunship and brother brandham said he
[1:00:52] didn't believe in that
[1:00:55] but you know what he said he believed
[1:00:57] in he said he believed in Eternal
[1:01:00] godship
[1:01:01] right
[1:01:05] that's well why you got a problem back
[1:01:08] there see that's where our mentality
[1:01:10] winds up and blocks out when we look at
[1:01:12] the word
[1:01:16] Sun can't you just see the point of what
[1:01:19] he's
[1:01:22] thinking now we're going to read some
[1:01:24] things is very
[1:01:25] interesting some of the things I'd never
[1:01:28] thought
[1:01:29] of sorry about that I'm not that
[1:01:33] smart I've always said that Jesus the
[1:01:36] son the Christ was the
[1:01:39] creator right CU there's nothing that
[1:01:42] the father
[1:01:44] created if the father created the son
[1:01:47] then you got
[1:01:50] too but if the son is the father
[1:01:55] made manifest in another form you still
[1:01:57] got
[1:02:00] one that's why you can even follow the
[1:02:02] DNA back in a
[1:02:04] family right you can see who you belong
[1:02:07] to because that's the DNA and see come
[1:02:10] on I found one the other day and I
[1:02:12] thought well that's pretty good cuz I've
[1:02:13] always I know I've heard the tape and I
[1:02:16] but brother Brown says he says now the
[1:02:18] body comes from the from the female the
[1:02:23] egg
[1:02:25] but see we don't believe that cuz we
[1:02:27] think in our mind the body comes from
[1:02:29] the sperm of the
[1:02:32] male no that is what gerti the egg the
[1:02:38] egg produces the
[1:02:46] body you see we've got it all figured
[1:02:51] out but have we
[1:02:55] what are you looking at it can you see
[1:02:57] what I'm talking about he had all of
[1:03:00] these attributes in him and just to
[1:03:03] bring it down to a point of saying all
[1:03:05] of these equals out to be the
[1:03:11] word well on the other side you see
[1:03:14] identically except for the top where it
[1:03:16] says Eternal but before the then in the
[1:03:19] beginning but not in time not when time
[1:03:23] begin to
[1:03:24] to do you see him standing back there as
[1:03:28] he moved over over into the position to
[1:03:31] be able to
[1:03:36] create he would be called The Son of
[1:03:39] God now you got Hebrews 1 Colossians 1
[1:03:43] John 1 Revelations about
[1:03:46] four uh you
[1:03:48] got many many more James 3 and9 and no
[1:03:53] excuse me Ephesians in that all things
[1:03:55] were created by Jesus
[1:03:59] Christ cuz see the father didn't create
[1:04:02] that was the
[1:04:03] key but the son that was on the other
[1:04:06] side doing the creating was the father
[1:04:09] that stepped over into the
[1:04:13] form and became
[1:04:16] word
[1:04:18] speech not that he couldn't talk back
[1:04:21] here that's where we missed the whole
[1:04:23] thing
[1:04:24] we want to try to make something like
[1:04:26] this
[1:04:27] tangible and then think of God just
[1:04:29] being a spirit that just floats
[1:04:35] around I would have no problem
[1:04:37] whatsoever if brother brandom but I've
[1:04:39] never found it so I'm saying I wouldn't
[1:04:40] but I would have no trouble if he said
[1:04:43] back before there was any of this
[1:04:45] eternal ever started any thoughts about
[1:04:46] it that God lived up there in a great
[1:04:48] big
[1:04:51] city I would have no problem with that
[1:04:55] because he dwelt in a place right he was
[1:04:58] a being if you understand what I'm
[1:05:00] driving at this is a being
[1:05:04] right this goes down to bringing that
[1:05:07] being into existence and it takes 6,000
[1:05:11] years to bring that being into
[1:05:19] existence but I believe it's Christ of
[1:05:21] mystery I'm not certain I'll find it for
[1:05:25] you but he said the only way he could be
[1:05:28] a father the way he wanted to be was to
[1:05:31] be the son of man right that's
[1:05:37] right that's what he saying that's
[1:05:44] right why because the son of man is one
[1:05:46] to release the life that could come into
[1:05:49] you and I to bring us eternal life
[1:05:53] that's right how you not release that
[1:05:54] life you and I wouldn't be the children
[1:05:56] of God so he spoke his own children into
[1:05:59] existence that's right if you don't
[1:06:01] believe that go back there in the
[1:06:03] scriptures where he said he breathed on
[1:06:06] them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:06:10] we spend all of our time arguing over
[1:06:12] when that happened and know that it
[1:06:14] didn't happen before
[1:06:17] Calvary brother Brown said it was a
[1:06:19] promise to come instead of thinking
[1:06:21] about what was taking place he actually
[1:06:24] FOC us into existence that's right amen
[1:06:27] cuz we are his offspring
[1:06:32] amen we are the children of
[1:06:37] God sir why can't we believe it that way
[1:06:41] we was talking the other day about some
[1:06:43] of the people a lot of people back years
[1:06:44] ago didn't pay no income
[1:06:46] tax always paid mine ain't never had no
[1:06:48] problem come find out Jesus Paid
[1:06:51] taxes you remember for him and Peter
[1:06:54] that's right which you know there's
[1:06:55] people in this message didn't believe in
[1:06:56] paying taxes you know what now they
[1:06:58] can't draw no social security whoe I'm
[1:07:01] glad they can't sorry for the people
[1:07:03] that's hungry but I'm glad they can't
[1:07:05] cuz they didn't
[1:07:07] pay they had this great Revelation you
[1:07:09] know what the Revelation was Jesus said
[1:07:13] does the children of the king pay
[1:07:19] taxes see they say the children of the
[1:07:22] king don't pay no taxes said I'm a child
[1:07:24] of the king I don't pay no taxes that's
[1:07:27] a spiritual Kingdom that's not a
[1:07:28] physical
[1:07:31] one so they didn't pay no taxes now they
[1:07:34] can't
[1:07:34] draw and ain't just a few people in this
[1:07:37] message there a lot of
[1:07:41] them and I told him then I said well you
[1:07:44] know kind of odd Jesus Paid
[1:07:47] taxes he told Peter to go get the fish
[1:07:49] and pull out the money go pay the taxes
[1:07:51] for you and myself
[1:07:58] and he was the
[1:08:00] god he was not a son you know right he
[1:08:04] was not the son of a king he was the
[1:08:06] King right the king paid taxes he said
[1:08:10] give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's
[1:08:14] that's
[1:08:17] Bible but said unto God that belongs to
[1:08:20] him right amen we're talking about a
[1:08:23] spiritual King this is not a natural
[1:08:25] Kingdom Jesus said if this was a natural
[1:08:27] Kingdom paraphrasing his word he said my
[1:08:29] subjects would
[1:08:30] fight
[1:08:33] right you see we've got it all figured
[1:08:38] out and those poor old people now are in
[1:08:41] bad
[1:08:43] shape because they can't draw any Social
[1:08:45] Security because they didn't pay in
[1:08:49] any well you know what a lot of them is
[1:08:51] going to figure out a way to get up on
[1:08:52] welfare and you know who's paying for
[1:08:55] that like
[1:08:58] my got works on a car I won't call his
[1:09:01] name but he uh not daing
[1:09:06] him Gils he said my sister said she's
[1:09:09] had three babies by Three Men and don't
[1:09:11] know what daddy is the daddy of who and
[1:09:14] said you know what I heard the other day
[1:09:15] she's pregnant again said I jumped on to
[1:09:18] her at Christmas said she got mad run
[1:09:19] out of my house I said I was laughing
[1:09:22] that he said she got mad at me said she
[1:09:24] said well the government's paying for he
[1:09:27] said honey you are the
[1:09:31] government I'm paying for your babies he
[1:09:34] said said she got mad and left the house
[1:09:37] but
[1:09:39] okay do you see what it
[1:09:42] is go to number four let me read just a
[1:09:46] few of these and then we'll get to point
[1:09:47] and quit on that we'll stop on these
[1:09:50] attributes this is taken from the
[1:09:52] message investment 196 3 paragraph 17 he
[1:09:55] talking about the compound names and
[1:09:57] thing for the great attributes of God
[1:09:59] before that before he was even
[1:10:01] God before there was God is an object of
[1:10:05] worship before he ever become that he
[1:10:07] was still God he is eternal and these
[1:10:10] attributes was in him is that
[1:10:15] enough and they're just display
[1:10:18] themselves as being a father and a son a
[1:10:20] savior and it's just in we're enjoying
[1:10:22] those things right
[1:10:25] going to the next one let's get a few of
[1:10:26] these where you won't be saying it's
[1:10:28] just one quote go to number
[1:10:32] five we got Josiah and Zach back there
[1:10:35] running these things and you know what I
[1:10:37] told him a while ago I said while I'm
[1:10:40] preaching scan that audience every once
[1:10:43] in a while I said try not to pick out
[1:10:45] the ones that's
[1:10:48] asleep you might be frowning and smiling
[1:10:51] at the wrong time and be on
[1:10:55] internet
[1:10:57] okay but look what he says off of the
[1:11:00] message what that's supposed to be
[1:11:02] number five which is God's provided way
[1:11:04] of approach to Fellowship in
[1:11:08] 1960 says Genesis one in the beginning
[1:11:10] God the word go God the that word there
[1:11:13] in Hebrews is El Elohim and all in the
[1:11:18] alls sufficient one the self-existing
[1:11:20] one the strong one and in him was
[1:11:22] attributes to be father and him was
[1:11:25] attribute to be son and him was
[1:11:27] attributes to be Savior and him was
[1:11:29] attributes to be healer and him was
[1:11:31] attributes to be God there was nothing
[1:11:34] but God and God Alone now these
[1:11:36] attributes was in him so that made it
[1:11:39] display something to worship Him the
[1:11:41] first thing he made was Angels okay go
[1:11:43] to number six which is the unveiling of
[1:11:46] God
[1:11:50] 1964 notice he never changed his nature
[1:11:56] sure sir if I were
[1:11:59] you if I were you and say you're
[1:12:02] dependent upon the way that I bring
[1:12:05] things I would write on the top of my
[1:12:08] notes a very important word here now is
[1:12:12] being used of the N or the word
[1:12:16] nature I would write it on top of my
[1:12:19] notes to keep it because eventually
[1:12:21] we'll get back to that cuz never changed
[1:12:24] his nature that's right only his
[1:12:28] form Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same
[1:12:31] yesterday today and forever so he did
[1:12:33] not change his nature when he come he is
[1:12:36] always that Prophet watch all down to
[1:12:40] the age same thing the word the word the
[1:12:42] word the word the word and see he cannot
[1:12:45] change his nature but he changed his
[1:12:48] form Hebrews 13:8 he's the same
[1:12:51] yesterday today and forever he just
[1:12:53] changed his mask his
[1:12:58] form all right so here was the
[1:13:02] father now don't look at empty spaces
[1:13:04] and leave empty spaces remember the
[1:13:08] point here was the father back in the
[1:13:10] beginning before the
[1:13:12] Eternal he steps
[1:13:16] over into another form called a
[1:13:21] son that's no problem that's what your
[1:13:24] Prophet said that you said you believe
[1:13:25] while ago when you said yes that's right
[1:13:27] that he didn't send a son he came
[1:13:30] himself well why don't you believe he
[1:13:32] came himself just don't empty spaces and
[1:13:35] leave I I get you know these people make
[1:13:37] these big fancy drawings and they'll
[1:13:39] make it and they'll oh all God was and
[1:13:43] then they see they leave this
[1:13:44] empty well I know right then they don't
[1:13:46] know what they're talking
[1:13:50] about cuz the more of God we get over
[1:13:53] here here makes him more
[1:13:58] right right
[1:14:01] am all right he changed his mask look
[1:14:04] what he says on the Mighty God unveiled
[1:14:06] number seven he goes through scoffield
[1:14:08] and the words you know that he uses as a
[1:14:11] form we find the word IM morphe in
[1:14:14] Greek we find that his word changing
[1:14:18] from form we find the word imorph in the
[1:14:20] Greek which means the Unseen was made
[1:14:22] visible something that cannot we know
[1:14:25] it's there now anybody one ey in high
[1:14:27] sense or know somewhere they had to be a
[1:14:29] God to begin with you can say well it
[1:14:32] was a polywog it turned out well where
[1:14:33] did the polywog come
[1:14:34] [Music]
[1:14:36] from well it's just what's that other
[1:14:38] word Gary uh it's uh
[1:14:42] energy It's Just Energy well where'd
[1:14:44] that come
[1:14:45] from because scientifically proven
[1:14:48] energy cannot be created nor destroyed
[1:14:50] it can only be harnessed that's
[1:14:51] scientific fact right so if it's energy
[1:14:55] he was back before
[1:14:57] energy that's right he existed before
[1:15:04] energy all right which means the Unseen
[1:15:07] was made visible something that cannot
[1:15:08] we know it's there it can be cannot be
[1:15:11] seen but yet we know that it's there and
[1:15:13] when he changed his form of the amorphia
[1:15:17] which means that he changed from
[1:15:19] Supernatural to
[1:15:22] natural and he just changed his mask in
[1:15:25] other words it's like a drama he was
[1:15:27] acting in the Greek when they would
[1:15:29] change their mask maybe one player you
[1:15:32] know one player might have acted in
[1:15:34] several different parts he just changes
[1:15:38] his
[1:15:39] mask he never changes his nature
[1:15:44] right that's
[1:15:45] right do you believe that amen do you
[1:15:49] believe he never changes his
[1:15:52] nature
[1:15:55] cuz if he changed his nature it wouldn't
[1:15:56] be Hebrews 138 that's right
[1:16:00] right right and he wouldn't be uh what
[1:16:02] is it Malachi 3 where he said I'm God
[1:16:04] and I change not now if he changes
[1:16:07] anywhere in any of that he can change
[1:16:10] his form to another form and appear is
[1:16:15] that that's where people how their
[1:16:17] trouble there on the river here stood
[1:16:19] the sun here come the pillar fire here
[1:16:22] come the D and the voice
[1:16:29] out if that had not been you would went
[1:16:31] into
[1:16:33] Oneness remember Oneness is like his
[1:16:35] finger remember one means oh God was he
[1:16:39] stepped into Christ all Christ he
[1:16:42] stepped into the
[1:16:43] church that's Oneness
[1:16:50] right that is Oneness cuz one on this is
[1:16:53] like your finger and all the the god
[1:16:56] that stepped out they rejoiced when I
[1:16:58] said the great Eternal never sent his
[1:17:00] son you would have heard
[1:17:05] 300 one this people screaming at those
[1:17:07] things that God never
[1:17:10] changes he just changed his form the
[1:17:14] only one they backed up on was mzc they
[1:17:17] couldn't swallow that too
[1:17:19] easily and for three nights in a row I
[1:17:22] preached on the
[1:17:24] godhead and got a whole lot more respect
[1:17:27] out of it even told them women preachers
[1:17:29] I didn't agree with them and they
[1:17:30] invited me to come and preach in their
[1:17:38] church here you can't even go preach
[1:17:42] nowhere all right those
[1:17:46] attributes he changed his form to morphe
[1:17:49] like a drama he's acting it out and
[1:17:52] thing
[1:17:55] uh I'm going stop right there cuz if I
[1:17:58] go any further or going into other
[1:18:01] things we'll pick it up next Wednesday
[1:18:03] won't have no trouble but if I was you I
[1:18:05] would ask you to do I've asked you to do
[1:18:07] it I've asked you to listen read or
[1:18:11] whatever questions and answers on
[1:18:13] Genesis that's all I've asked you to do
[1:18:16] to see where the Prophet is saying these
[1:18:17] things or not but make sure you get what
[1:18:20] I'm talking about for a second and then
[1:18:22] we'll have musicians to come remember
[1:18:25] we're not
[1:18:27] Oneness so then all that would step over
[1:18:30] here and leave nothing over there come
[1:18:32] on you're getting into Oneness
[1:18:36] Doctrine and brother brandom was
[1:18:37] definitely not a Oneness
[1:18:40] right when he said all that God
[1:18:43] was to me that means all that God is
[1:18:46] going to make known was revealed in
[1:18:49] Jesus Christ and there'll be a message
[1:18:51] of cheer down to the end of ages do you
[1:18:54] think you're going to heaven and going
[1:18:56] to sit up there and not learn about
[1:19:00] God what kind of a God have you
[1:19:02] got he said a message of cheer down to
[1:19:05] the endless ages after we leave here an
[1:19:09] eternal partaking he said of the
[1:19:15] word we're just getting enough here to
[1:19:18] be able to understand when we get
[1:19:21] there
[1:19:27] did you see all of those attributes was
[1:19:28] in
[1:19:30] him before he ever came across that line
[1:19:34] as we would call it to begin to do
[1:19:36] anything and we'll pick it up next week
[1:19:40] when he comes across that line he comes
[1:19:42] across that line and brother brandham
[1:19:45] says now
[1:19:46] listen he said he had in his
[1:19:49] mind what he wanted to do
[1:19:55] you better read and
[1:19:57] listen because that he that he's talking
[1:20:01] about you read and see we'll prove it
[1:20:04] next week that he he's talking about is
[1:20:08] the
[1:20:12] son that's why I'm not a trinitarian but
[1:20:15] I'm not a
[1:20:17] Oneness doesn't bother me for a river
[1:20:20] Jordan I mean yeah don't bother me for a
[1:20:22] river Jordan EXP experience to take
[1:20:23] place they don't bother
[1:20:28] me because I'm not a Oneness and not of
[1:20:32] not
[1:20:34] Trinity don't do away with the forms of
[1:20:39] God are you listening just because he
[1:20:42] Chang his form doesn't do away with the
[1:20:45] form now come
[1:20:48] on me and my wife I used to be just a
[1:20:51] Snick of fren of a kid right had
[1:20:54] attributes in
[1:20:56] me I had to have somebody to help me
[1:21:00] because those attributes could never
[1:21:01] been
[1:21:03] displayed those
[1:21:05] genes those genetics and things so one
[1:21:08] day you know what I got
[1:21:10] married and I got somebody to help me
[1:21:14] display my
[1:21:18] attributes right brother Ray and you
[1:21:21] wind up with children
[1:21:23] that are your
[1:21:26] attributes and you know what there's so
[1:21:28] much your attributes until the DNA will
[1:21:30] prove
[1:21:31] it I looked in the paper the other day
[1:21:33] and it's so wonderful to think about
[1:21:35] they're solving crimes today that was
[1:21:37] committed 40 years ago that finally got
[1:21:40] to the people to where that they had the
[1:21:42] they had the DNA material laying but
[1:21:45] they didn't know how to use
[1:21:47] it it was in the paper just this week
[1:21:49] how many cases they had solved and
[1:21:51] turned the people loose
[1:21:53] because the DNA proved they were not
[1:21:57] guilty that's right it's a wonderful age
[1:22:01] in a lot of things let's
[1:22:06] stand he doesn't change his form I mean
[1:22:09] his nature he changes his
[1:22:13] form but don't do away with any
[1:22:16] form I am a father I'm a son I'm a human
[1:22:21] I've got many many manifestations to me
[1:22:25] but I'm only one person that is doing
[1:22:28] that but my wife does it she does it you
[1:22:31] know how that's done but I'm not her
[1:22:37] daddy the
[1:22:41] children say Daddy the grandkid says
[1:22:45] Poppy the great grandkids they just
[1:22:47] follow them say poy you know anyway but
[1:22:49] you know what I'm talking
[1:22:51] about
[1:22:53] to think about what he has done and
[1:22:56] revealed to you and
[1:23:00] I now here's the one that always comes
[1:23:02] up in my face and does brother Dale do
[1:23:06] you think we believe to know do you
[1:23:08] think we need to know these
[1:23:11] things you do not want to know about
[1:23:14] your
[1:23:18] God you would tell me you don't need to
[1:23:22] know about your God people spend a
[1:23:24] million dollars to try to find out where
[1:23:27] their daddy was at and the Old Goat run
[1:23:30] off and left them when there was kids I
[1:23:32] wouldn't hunt two seconds for somebody
[1:23:35] like that but people spend millions of
[1:23:37] dollars to try to find their true
[1:23:44] parents you mean you don't want to know
[1:23:46] about your
[1:23:50] daddy you don't want to know know about
[1:23:52] the one who created you and brought you
[1:23:55] into
[1:23:57] being you don't want to know about your
[1:23:59] savior you don't want to know about your
[1:24:01] healer you don't want to know about your
[1:24:06] deliverer the only thing I got to say is
[1:24:08] altar is open you need to baptism with
[1:24:10] the Holy Ghost right because if that's
[1:24:12] where you are then you certainly need
[1:24:14] something to help

[1:24:28] little Rec condiction in my mind about
[1:24:32] anything but I you know what someone
[1:24:34] would start talking about him or
[1:24:35] something I remember my sister and it
[1:24:37] tickled me to death she was talking
[1:24:39] about and it was bad but said that she
[1:24:41] got mad at a boy on the school bus
[1:24:43] because said they looked out the window
[1:24:45] and said ours old Sam ain't worth
[1:24:50] a put the big word out there

[1:25:04] lot of people talk about my
[1:25:06] daddy and try to make him three or one
[1:25:09] or some kind of something or
