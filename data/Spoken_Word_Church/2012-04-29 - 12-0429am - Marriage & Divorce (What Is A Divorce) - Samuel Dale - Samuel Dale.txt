terence has mentioned it but uh remember brother uh collins they said he was passing some blood to his kidneys so remember that and just pray for him i knew yesterday when we were there that he wasn't looking good and i meant to talk to him you know to see what uh if it was if he was how he was doing but uh you know i didn't i let it go but just pray for him that the lord would would bless him and take care of him all right you'd like turn in your scriptures we're going to do a lot of reading today and a lot of tying together scriptures and things and so if you will go to jeremiah matthew 19. and matthew 5. now when we're seated if some of you need the notes as they appear on the screen terrex has got a few extra ones to be able to for you to read along with us amen let's just pray before we go into the because the prophet said no man had a right to uh read the word of anything until he asked the author's permission so let's ask him father we thank you this day for your loving your grace and to us we thank you for salvation and peace and joy we thank you for grace and your guidance thank you for all things and you said you give them to us freely lord we pray that you would just bless us with your understanding and open the eyes of our heart as we sing that we may see you open your word as we read it and all and we fellowship around it most of all forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk in you guide us now in jesus name amen jeremiah 3 6-8 the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king has now seen that which backsliding israel had done he has gone up upon every high mountain and under evergreen tree and there had played the harlot and i said after she had done all these things turned out unto me but she returned not and her treacherous sister judah saw it and i saw and when all the causes were by backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went and played the harlot also let's go to matthew 19 verse 3-9 the pharisees also came unto him tempting him now notice tempting him now we're not going to get into a lot today we're just going to make a scriptural background of the things you know instead of getting into a lot of the points and all we're just trying to establish something but the pharisees also came unto him tempting him saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read he which made them at the beginning made them male and female that's right and said for this call shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleveland to leave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more right now wherefore there are no more twain but one place but therefore god hath joined together let not man put us under they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so that's right and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committee of the daughter and whosoever her which is put away doth commit adultery now we go to matthew 5. verse 31-32 it had been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his life saving for the cause of fornication causing her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery okay you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now yes we are preaching here what we see from the message of the hour and proving it by the bible and the prophet's message if it crosses your thoughts i'm sorry because we're just trying to do the best we can to be straight all right and then if you want to talk to me later about it but there's many those so many um different thoughts and avenues and things as you know people as they have tried over the years to understand and we didn't have the prophet's message to be able to to understand with that's right so you know it was just man's ideas and the prophet of god said on the message marriage in divorce we're in this situation today because of misinterpreted theology that's right man's kind putting their thoughts upon the word and see one fellow saying well i believe it this way well i believe it this way well that's you know the constitution is your right to believe what you want to believe right but the bible does that's right but the constitution does so then go ahead with your constitution you claim you're an american that won't do any good about a christian and like i said if i cross your thoughts i'm sorry we spent three messages so far speaking on what is a marriage right you know a lot of people think like the the uh african people you know their ways of doing is maybe step over a stick maybe they uh step into a house maybe they do some kind of ways and they you know they're married all right and then you go over here to this group of people and they got their ways and this over here has got their ways and basic what you would call americanism or really basically the worldism about marriages if you're gonna have to have some form of vows you know and they don't count engagement as being a wedding you know they just count it as when you stand before the preacher or you of the magistrate or whoever you are or like you would say of the foreign countries whoever their head person would be you know to do that or whether it would be uh like in india they pick out basically the wife and the husband and put them together and some of you have been some of the lines and know a lot about it you know but ever what it is when it winds up you end up married right now a lot of people believe that said you're you you've got to stand before the preacher and make all your vows here you know all and then others believe that you have to have a relationship and that makes you married well we went through now and prove these things to you that wouldn't hear uh we can't reread all of it but we gave the prophet's definition of of the things and the bible of showing it so then we we you know we just stand on that so you bear with us and just remember that we did show that uh fear not to take them to the murray thy wife about joseph said they were espoused they were only engaged they had not went through the altar vows and they surely had not lived together but they were married because it says mary you know take unto thee mary thy wife and right back before then in the same writing it says that uh the husband joseph being the husband the bible plainly called them husband and wife all right then we don't have to worry about it we just line up with that part and go on and paul in corinthians 2 corinthians 11 about verse 2. you know he's he's talking about he espoused us to christ all right then we showed you where brother brown said i have a spouse you the bride to christ i've engaged you right i've espoused you to christ all right now we went through to show then that what a marriage was and gave what the prophet had to say about it and we will read as we get on into the message in a minute reread something to show it but brother brown says when you're engaged as far as god is concerned you're married amen when you ask the the boy asks the girl and she accepts that they're engaged they're married amen all right that was why joseph was going to put away because he was the only one who had the authority see he was physically her husband not in the natural acts and things but he was already everybody else knew it that was her husband and he would have had to catch the first stone to kill her if there'd have been something wrong with mary so what he said was you know i'll take her when he took her they could not condemn her because he took her sin upon himself and and all kind of things you know was was brought to pass in doing it but i hope you understand that and follow with us and we'll try not to spend too much time but just remember the prophet said when you are engaged you are married that's right amen he said you go break that vow i gave you where he said over in the far east the espousal the word engaged we use the word engaged we use the word a spouse and we use the word betroth right to make sure it would cover ever uh culture you know of anywhere in the world now if some of you uh people from um guyana or or uh you know zimbabwe is there another word that you have besides like betroth as that spouse are engaged does that cover it pretty well all right see we don't want to believe anything because it's whatever the word would be used and that's why i kept giving those words and the definition from them and giving it out of the uh of the prophet's message and he said were you bill call or not he said bill paul was engaged he said whether or not and i'll read you that in a minute he said whether or not they had lived together whether or not they had had the vows at the you know the altar or whatever he said they were married see that's what a lot of people don't like that because that's just how plain it is it's in the bible and it's straight so when i bring it i bring it straight and plain and then if it fits all right and if you don't like it that's gonna have to talk to god about it because i'm only gonna take what he says in his word and bring you that part all right and then i'm gonna take the profit to back up that because that's what we do believe that we've had a profit in the last days to give us the interpretation of scripture then we don't have to worry about anything else all right so what is a marriage it's when you're engaged right all right do you go on through the stages of that and if anywhere in that something goes wrong then you've got a problem right you say well i can go down to courthouse and show you i've never been married at one time but how many times you've been engaged we'll get down one of these days to a lot of those things of where we'll do it and i'm asking you if you will to write down your thoughts you know in other words write down something like this i never was engaged to anybody but i lived with a guy for five years and had four kids do you think we was married well you know what i'm gonna say all right but that's just you know that's brother dale i'm sorry you you've got to put up with me one way or the other if there's one thing about it you can't deny what i say come and show if you can you know or show me where the prophet said this or that of the other and then two you say well well do you you know you the way you talk is so hard yes there's a grace of marriage and divorce amen and thank god for that amen have you ever asked him or thanked him for it that's right amen that's it have you ever accepted it but did you accept it yeah like a brother was saying like not saul he's gonna made a good point right oh saul you know he'd get under he they'd bring him down and the prophet samuel and them or nathan one of them would bring that he said i'm sorry i repent but it did what good was a good point he said but when david comes he was laying on the altar before god screaming out so if you received the new birth did you get it by just yeah i believe it i got it that's not exactly the way you get the new birthday right well that wouldn't be exactly the way you'd receive the grace of marriage in divorce i understand amen that's right you're going to have to cry and run run and brother brown said a supernatural revelation because of the opening of the seven seals as god revealed to you okay all right see if he hasn't been you say well i didn't know i needed to do that well there's a quote i gave you guys that where brother brown was talking and he said talking about being engaged and he said you may have not known that before but you know it now that's what he said all right so you may not have known you needed grace but now you do and we're going to need it you know for a lot of things right and we will this is not the whole story because you've got to have a spiritual condition and i've asked you to read invisible union over and over and over and over brother brown said on the invisible union that it was a higher form of marriage and divorce how did her old husband had to be dead for us to be married to jesus christ amen all right now is your old husband dead that's right or is he still alive yeah come on the old husband is adam and i don't care to tell you i'm looking at him because you're looking at adam adam this is a damnit nature this outside part what do we are that's right but we'll get back to those things all right but now listen there's three words in the bible so now today we're going to deal with what is a divorce you can see that when you made your vows that was your engagement and your engagement was your marriage what is a divorce well we went down to the courthouse and we got a divorce you can go down there right now you can get a uh one part divorce there is such a thing as a one part divorce you can go down and get a divorce from your wife or you know the husband whatever but you know and you can get it to where it just separates that one person that's getting it so you you may not know this but go check it out but you better check real quick to find out a lot of people say they've been divorced that maybe legally if not because you can get to one part see if you just can get the part from your husband would see as far as record is concerned he's still married if you don't believe that go check it out i mean i'm not going to argue with nobody about it i'm just telling you i'm telling you maybe you need to know so maybe you need to find out to see whether or not your divorce is legal you know or did somebody just throw some papers down and you signed it well we're gonna find out what is a divorce all right now we're gonna get the definitions of the words to where we can have a bible definition of them all right and that way then we can follow it through now the word divorce as we read in jeremiah 3 there that's the only time the word divorce is used in the bible it's only used one time it's jeremiah 3. all right it was jehovah speaking of israel that's right and now that he gave her a bill of divorce now in doing that brother brown goes on and we'll get to that in a minute and tells you about what happened but look what it says there in jeremiah 3 and 8 now give her a bill of divorce now in case somebody wants to come along later and try to bring up some points i like to put them in a head and then that way you can't pick it up in israel you've got a problem because he can say i'm married to you an exam divorced because a lot of it was because of the wording that was used for the time but he finally divorced her sure all right but now look this is the word divorce okay now the hebrew election 37 48 the word divorce it means divorce dismissal or divorcement all right now the word divorce that's the only time it's used in the bible that's the meaning of it that's the the old testament hebrew lexicon giving you the meaning it means divorce or divorcement you say well that's the word written out but it means dismissal right so now write that down and keep it with you dismissal the word divorce means dismissal all right now notice the number 3748 because we're going to come right back in a second right now go on to the next one on the word divorcement all right you notice down the bottom it says here it's saying here because you're going to see in a second what that means go on the word divorcement the word divorcement is used six times three times in the old testament three times in the new testament okay and it's identically the same word divorce and divorcement is the same word okay everybody link that in and get it in your mind it's the same word whether it says divorcement or whether it says divorce and i checked all of the connections that's what i was doing this morning when i left my notes i had to run how to get them is because i was making sure all of these that i say to you compares because you can you can go into your understanding and it'll show you right above on the word and it says click here to see where all these is used do that sometimes it might help you to see where it's used because sometimes it's used in a different form of word all right but now go ahead and pull up because in the old testament it's deuteronomy 24 you're only 24 so we're not dealing we're not going to get into this part of it today so we're dealing with the verse 3. if the latter husband hate her and write her bill or divorcement and give it in her hand and sendeth her out of his house huh so the word divorcement is the same okay it means dismissal go to isaiah 50 and 1. now i had to give these to them suffice in there so if we mess up today you forgive us you know all right let's see if the lord where is your bill where is the bill of your mother's divorcement whom i have put away all right now divorcement means dismissal now you're picking up wording that shows you what it means right see whom i have put away dismissal what does dismissal mean to dismiss something to put it away all right now follow that keep that in your mind put it away because we're trying to anchor down the wording to see what we're talking about all right now let's see we've got to go over to the new testament now and we'll pick up the new testament word of divorcement okay so go to where we will be going in uh where we go matthew 5 matthew 5 31. it had been said whosoever put away put away his wife they didn't give her a bill a divorce month all right now that's the word divorcement okay now matthew 19 7 it says they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and to put her away now don't get your mind tied up and do because we're smart people and we try to do and that's why when i try to explain something transfer it backward and into even and let it go see don't try to come up with a divorce and put her away the divorcement is putting her away right all right so when mark you got the same word it's over to ride a divorcement and to put her away but remember now you're dealing with put her away dismissal all right that word comes from the number it's the new testament word number 647 and look what it says it says divorcement writing and divorcement divorce repudiation is that the way you pronounce that okay a bill of divorce all right now that's the definition in the new testament the word repudiation all right is to in a itchy webster's dictionary to reject as having no authority or binding force repudiation means to have no binding force it means to have no authority or no binding force it means to put away to put away now i couldn't bring up they could go in there in a hurry and i was really enough i hadn't been late they could have pulled up repudiation let you read it but get webster read it okay you should know when you repudiate something that you're you're a dismissal right you're doing away with that form all right so now that means to put away it means to have no there's going to be a place come that there's no authority or any binding force okay now let's go to the word divorce now the word divorce is used three times in the old testament i think it's three of the new so where are a divorce woman profane you know just get the definition of the word divorce i'm just doing that with you you can read these other and i'll get back to these scriptures see then you'll find it in leviticus 22 and 13 it talks about a winner or divorce numbers 30 and 9 it talks about and i've heard that is divorced all right now the word divorce look what it comes from they go ahead with the definition from 1644. okay now you know where that word is used this is what it means it means to drive out expel cast out drive away divorce put away thrust away means trouble it means to cast out or cast up in other words see the thrust out to cast out to be driven out to be tossed to be driven out and drum away to be thrust all right now that word there then relates back to where we're talking about how that the word divorce the word divorcement is all dealing with one thing and you come down to divorce it's dealing with what dismissal casting out separating putting away all right amen see now the new testament word divorce and what's what it is matthew 5 32. when i say whosoever put away his wife saying for cause her to commit adultery and whosoever's america that is divorced committed to adultery okay right on up to the definition number 630 is the new testament definition you know what i'm doing the greek the hebrew will have one definition the greek has another definition the hebrews the old testament the greek is the new okay so then you get the definition of the word and you can compare it so look at what it is and you this one i would invite you to run this one especially where it says click where all of these are to be used i would invite you to please do that because it'll give you a lot of understanding but what does the word divorce mean to release to put away to send away let go set at liberty let depart dismiss to set free to let go dismiss to detain no longer a petitioner to whom liberty to depart is given by a decisive answer to be a depart send away let go free release that's what this word divorce means a captive in other words to lose his bonds and bid him depart to give him liberty to depart to equip one accused of a crime and set him free at liberty so you can use that word divorce and say i went down to the court and they got away with my case what they done they divorced your case well you don't you don't see it stop that on your paper you know they don't stamp it they divorce you i'm giving you the joy this is what the word is used the words you use is the same word for divorce in the old testament of the new testament when you say put away that means divorce all right now we've got a sister sitting back there that just shook her head and you know what she is a secretary to the uh what is it sister mayor if you want to ask her some questions about these words whether i'm telling the truth or not go ask her about it because she's got some pretty good rank and working for a for a long time that knows the answers to all of these things and if you ask him this he'd say that's right we just don't write divorce when we say we're going to let this person go free but that's what you've done because divorce means to dismiss to separate to unbind that's all the definitions i'm giving to you see all right and diligently to grant that the prisoner leaves to depart to release a debtor in other words not to press one's claim against him to remit his debt use the divorce to diminish from the house to repudiate that's that repudiation we give to the definition in other words the wife of a greek or a roman may divorce her husband all right to send oneself away in other words to depart all right now so we see that summing up all of the definitions it would come out to be dismissal a divorce is it dismissal it is a doing away it is a cancelling of records everybody following me it's it's to set free is to unbind the two people is to have many many many definitions that the word divorce can be used best to put away all right now to be put away okay so then brother brown said that jehovah go back and pull that up the first quote right it's uh the sound is coming 62. all right look what brother brown said about jehovah and what he done all right remember adam's bride was found with fault seed that's exactly right jehovah's bride was found the same way all right right he divorced her and put her away oh jehovah was bright he divorced her and put her away now i've heard preachers in this message preach that he's going to marry her back one day i differ totally because he can't marry her back according to deuteronomy 24 he can't take her back and marry her we'll get to that scripture later but she comes back not as the children of god she comes back as servants israel is not to be remarried to to jehovah or jesus amen they were divorced they come back as not to be married back they don't get the new birth right you say wait a minute you have 144 thousand dollars because they got a special place they get an eternal life here all right because that's the connection but what watch what he says now he divorced her and put her away is that right that was not christ's bride is the same thing she's found with worldly organized seed in her and not the gospel having a form of godliness but denying the power of thereof from the holy spirit and the word there's a sign of the last day god will divorce her and take his bride now you say that's double talk he talking about the bride he's talking about the bride christ brown that's right he was his bride because he invited her to come and be his bride and she accepted it just as jehovah invited old testament israel to be his wife and she accepted it and that made them married but then when she played the harlot she was divorced now i gave you the quotes there the other night of the other days from the last message i wrote around and said in luther's day that he put them away in divorcement wesley's day he put them away in divorce not the bride of that day so-called bride the organizations the denominations is right now in this message so you shouldn't talk about this message well why not that's right because she's going to be divorced if i've got the doctrine that is contrary to god's word i'm going to be divorced i don't mind saying it that way i'm going to be put away that's why you better be careful what you're listening to and check out everything i say because you know if you sit here with me you might be divorced too i don't mind talking that way because it's plain it ain't time to play with little sugar tits it's time to be straight sorry all right look there's the sign of the last days god will divorce her and take his bride as certain as anything in here as it was in the days of noah he's going to divorce this end-time people but out of there is going to come abroad how long do i need to preach on where that bread around says that out of the church comes to bride right come on read the message out of this end time situation will come apart there will be word born bride but don't tell me all this other stuff's word born bride then when they won't even agree with the word well that's just your way of thinking okay all right come and show me in the word come on i don't have no problems i'm just trying to be straight see but now this all right according to what we've found the word divorce is to put away well that's what he done with this he put her away all right now to put her away to just do divorce all right now we're back to the definition of what is a marriage come on we're the definition of what is a marriage so let's just read what brother brown had to say about it going to the next one number two on the quote and let's see what he said we've read this over and over and i don't really don't know if i keep bringing it up but it is that's dire all right you read it if you don't want to forget it all right look what he says in paragraph 165 1964 8 30 in the morning service questions and answers which is number three book if you're looking all right can i be a hypocrite if i stood here because my own son sitting here that was promised to a girl and i said if if he never even had the ceremony set over him no matter if he ever lived with the woman or slept with the woman the girl or whatever it was when he made that vow he's married billy paul or no billy paul that's exactly the truth he's married when he made that promise and you know yourself that he refused to do the wedding of bill paul and lois all right he refused to do it he wouldn't have nothing to do with it all right look at the next one what he says i just brought this and put it in because you might wonder about you know this is paragraph 15 6. and you know what he's done run off with some little kid still in common school and got married we are know the wedding no there's another no capsule a wedding right really we know the wedding the father of this girl and myself we'll know the wedding but he was married just the same he's my boy sitting here listening to me now that's exactly he said daddy were you married he said no by no means would he marry him why because he's been married before huh now what is a wedding what is a marriage we just read around said it didn't matter whether he lived with her or whether they had their ceremony you know a daughter another word he said there's marriage when they made the vows all right now what is a simple answer to what is a divorce to tie together all of the things that we've brought what is a simple answer to disallow the vow now you know that don't work out here in the courts in other words you got it in the courts you've got papers you signed where you get married all right then you get a divorce they got to go put it on record that they disallowed that that marriage that you had and they're dividing you up they have made a dismissal to the fact of what you've done well that's simple if a wedding is a as a promise that you make then when you take away that promise you're divorced amen come on to that simple terminology amen everybody says i'm so deep what's deep about that yeah right if a wedding is when you say will you marry me and she says yes and that's a wedding well then a divorce is to take those words and dismiss them because we'll get the secretary back here to give us the terminology because what you're signing there when you're applying for a divorce is you're saying i want to take back my vows is that simple is that simple enough i want to take back my vows i want to say that i don't want these vows anymore right that's right see then when we use the word divorce we use the word dismissal put away cast out turned out run out put out whatever but simple terminologies what is it you made your vows when you asked the boy to marry the girl to marry you and she accepted now she don't excel that's not a wedding i've been through that we've even proved that through deuteronomy if you make a vow to a girl and she accepts that vow i don't care who we are or who we've done you married amen that's right brother brown didn't bind saying billy paul or no billy paul right don't you think he wanted to straighten up things but yet what could he do right well he had it annulled well he said there's marriage right an anomaly is to go down to the court and get a simplified divorce would that be a word for an element it's a little different probably in the terminology but a little different than the paperwork because you're claiming that the daddy's on each side is saying they were too young or whatever it was or this was or something and you're saying they didn't have enough sense to make their decisions right and i imagine that's about right for all of us we didn't have much sense but still the vowel was made all right a divorce is a simple terminologies of breaking the vowel because now listen if that's not right i want you to explain how that in now i'm not throwing off on the african people you know that all right so when i say africa and i say africa all right that means zimbabwe that means guyana that means this when that means that when i'm just using the term all right but in your country you probably don't have to do that you might go down and tell them publicly come and watch me i want to step back over the stick right because it was a wedding when they stepped over the stick the whole crowd or whatever you call them group of people knows that's what happened so you go that's okay i'm gonna step back over the stick and that's gonna null our wedding that's going to give us a divorce because they probably don't have no paperwork to fill out i'm sure they do now because of the modernization of things but you understand what i mean is that one serious church for us to make our vows right amen right and paul said he espoused us brother said he espoused you enough chill book he said i call you bride so we're engaged to jesus christ we're espoused to him there will be a wedding supper one day right and there will be a honeymoon of a millennium many things are taking place right around said while that sick seal is being broke we're going to be being married to christ you say yeah we're already married that's exactly right i spent three services proving it to you right that when you're engaged you're already married so brother randall can say we're married to christ now then you can turn around and say but we're not married yet come on he's not contrary one statement to the other one one of them is telling you there is a wedding in the sky others telling you when you got that you accepted jesus christ as your savior and he accepted you yet that is eternity because that gives you the new birth amen right when you get the new birth your soul is just as eternal as god right come on am i quoting the prophet amen but you know your body and your spirit is still in this old realm amen our body and our spirit as i said well ago is still married to adam that's why we needed the grace of marriage and divorce not like some might try to think and say when i got the new birth it took care of everything well why did brother brown have to preach marriage and divorce if it took care of everything he wouldn't have to preach to you he wouldn't have to wait until god gave you the permission to say it he could have just walked out there and said you're born again we're all going to heaven he couldn't do it because he knew this body that's our problem this body this spirit that's within me whatever good you want to think about it this spirit that's within me this body that i live in is still of the adamic nature amen and you know what there's going to have to be a way under marriage and divorce for that old nature to die wait just a minute now your old nature died with a new bird brother dale it sure did but not the rest of this a lot of me still alive well that's my soul people say but my soul is what sin you better be careful saying your soul is what sin if you're saying you're born again right because you're making god a sinner you saw a soul is to me but the prophet explained that we're body spirit and soul amen why did we need the grace of marriage and divorce if it's all just a new birth because we had sin in our bodies right yeah man amen then nobody can claim goody goody that's right cause the best we can claim goody goody is batty bag that's why i don't look down on nobody but i try to preach the truth but words that preach around the message that you need the grace of marriage and divorce and even preach anymore that's right maybe they don't know what it is right right amen i said it from when i started in this message and i learned what that prophet said about marriage and divorce i said it then and i still say it now if that prophet had not come and brought the grace of marriage and divorce there would be no body body body human body able to be changed that's right there would have been no change in the body had the grace of marriage and divorce not been given that's why i believe it's so strong amen you say well i never had nothing i never committed adultery but did you kiss that's right that's right did you get engaged and then broke down and married somebody else that's why i tell you like i told you hannah come home one day about four or five years old it was about five years old school and she said so it's going together now i'm dumb i said where are they going i'm just honest i don't know where this is going at four or five years old she said daddy they're dating well see kids don't go around play with those words you say well that's just childish baby things you know after a while it's not childish you want to tell me what the age of accountability is i'd like for somebody to define it right the only way i can define the age of accountability is the age when you're come to a knowledge of understanding you may be five years old and you may be 50 years old right it's when you come to an understanding as the age of accountability that's right so be careful don't go around asking the girls especially the way it is now in the land today the girls are out asking the boys well wade made a good point on that day they gonna head ship for that but don't tell me said a girl asked the boy and they lived together and had four kids ain't married i'm not dumb all right one time said you know they said well he all right his wife she never married them guys but she lived with two or three had kids by them well some were his problems yeah right right i thought we were supposed to line up with the scriptures right now i've tried to give scripture i tried to give definitions tried to give the definition of the profit to see that a divorce is to disallow the vows you made that's why you've got to go to the court or somebody has for you or whatever you do you know proxies or whatever they do i don't understand all of it don't worry about it but somebody has got to go make the statements in writing or whatever i don't want to live with this person anymore i want to be divorced i want to take back my vow i want to take back my vow that i made well i never thought it'd be like that i called divorce with a big piece of paper he passed out yeah that's real good thinking but listen when jesus christ gave an invitation to the world what makes their denominations being harlots i tried to preach that the other day right right but make some harlots or denominations or in this message or where is that right what makes them my heart because they want to be claimed to be married to jesus christ right and they're out living with the devil right and see he's going to put him away we read it from the prophet and from there he's going to take a bribe now is it his fault he's given everything in the world that's right i run around am i ready to learn today when you engage what did the man do he just shares the girl with gifts and and things like that you know we had a little funny thing happened one time my wife and i and we were dating we hadn't even got to the point of being engaged at that point but we were you know we were dating and for christmas her and her girlfriend heard that they were going to get a friendship ring well so we get down to the date to go and there my buddy's got a box about that big well they she was tickled to death we was going to go to drive in or do something whatever here i set mine up was about this big squad i got a cold shoulder to kind of the match you know because i'm a little hurt you know but uh because especially when she pick it up shake it and it just rattled she's wondering what in the world have i but i was sharing her with gifts because i was the girl i was gonna marry that's right you see what she didn't know was we finally got back to the house we wouldn't let them open i'm telling my buddies today don't open till we get back off the date and get to the house okay sit down and she starts opening the thing and she gets out of one box and there's a box and then her box nothing locked and after a while she's just about ready to throw the thing in the trash can and she finally looked right down in the bottom of it and there was taped a little box you know for the friendship ring you know see you if you're engaged you want to share your that's right you know you want to show your affection that'll be nice and that's what god has done for you and us all right you know what i was thinking this morning i'm gonna go look it up i know the quotes are but brother brown said one time he said which had you'd rather be sick of a certain kind of a thing you know problem going wrong are being led flat on your back he said which one you'd rather have he said because you got a test and a cry you see all of our sicknesses and everything then it could be ten dollars so we ought to be rejoicing i'm still complaining because it could be that we could be laying in the bed somewhere paralyzed right he said because we've all got a test for a try but his test in a trial means that we're not his wife no he's teaching us the nature right right he's building in us what we need right a nature away what do you understand i think i've got my point across so you know see a divorce is the reversal of the vows of when you asked the girl and she accepted your proposal so then you just turned around and took away your bible now as christians we vowed to live holy and righteous in god right amen do the best we can to try to live right but then we go out and live like the devil then we find out her husband's still alive but around the invisible union said don't don't think about divorcing him now that's because you can't hang him up in a closet that's right and that's what a lot of people want right yeah and a lot of people today they just divorce to where they can and buy legal paperwork they go down in divorce and they get it to work that they can still live in the same house and be okie don't keep it to get better income tax right yeah you do better by being single than you can by being married a lot of times or something that's how easy it is to understand or to just go get a divorce right it's become a sloppy thing all right amen you know a divorcing if if joseph had a divorce mary do you know they would have killed her we prove to the bible if she finds someone the man finds some uncleanness in her deuteronomy 24. he could kill her or put her out of the house he was put away brother brown said he can put us away right marriage in divorce every twitches but he said we can't put him away amen and we'll get to it this evening that there is no grounds no thoughts no ideas no point to think about it and no no need to try to visit brotherdale in the office to explain something there is no grounds for a divorce for a woman nope that's right nowhere in the bible and nowhere in the prophet's ministry that's right can a woman divorce her husband now you can argue with me flesh women hey i'm just going to hold the paper up and say well i said it no i mean that's it but it's not said for him oh boy you are a male children this pig ever what that word than you you know that brother brown said adam that eve should have been burned you want that quote you should have been burned for what you've done but aren't you glad she wouldn't i would be here the adam took her back that's what i said about the old testament when you're reading in the old testament read real careful you'll find that god putting away israel when they go down into babylon but then you'll find him 400 years later bringing in that bringing her out as his bride that's right yep right maybe a few years later she put back in bondage again put away god away from it but then a few chapters later she's coming right back right now that grace of marriage and divorce your prophet knew it as you go into 1964 questions and answers before the marriage and divorce was preached in 65 in 64 he said if you'll believe me as a prophet remain as you are don't go do anything until you hear from me he knew there would be a grace given but he couldn't walk out there and say okay that's right why because god had not said it yet right man he had only spoke of it in times and shadows right right and speaking of something is not the the point of bringing it into reality that's right brother brown knew paul had a grace of marriage and divorce he knew that that moses had a grace and he believed there would be one in the end time but he couldn't bring it right until god said it because he had to have thus saith the lord that's right and he said because of the opening of the seven seals a supernatural revelation because of that so he didn't come out before the seals broke and told you about marriage and divorce but he did just simply put it in there if you'll read it he said don't do anything until you hear from me see then the new birth does have a lot to do with our lives yes because it keeps us from being destroyed right and it is only we gave it to her the other day and just hit the end of the message it is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchase product but it's already redeemed plus or what you mean brother you don't understand it already you don't understand either keep reading the prophet said it's redeemed but said he ain't claiming that yet do you want that see we can quote but can we quote at all said he hadn't claimed it yet said he hadn't took possession yet that's why we're married to him by our vows but we're going to a wedding in the sky that's why you and i were married when we made our vows to the that's what i've told you i don't understand it i'm not trying to be nothing they never tried to be nothing anyway but i would not marry my wife until i told her my life boys girls you better listen to that right talk things over before you get married saves you a lot of trouble after you get married amen i would not ask her to marry me and was riding up the road going up into the mountains one day i said i want to tell you my life maybe that was god dealing with this old man back there as a sinner to try to keep him straight in a lot of ways and i wouldn't listen to him how many of you can say that that's right and i wasn't born again the ladder i come in this message right you see this message is what set me free whether it be grace of marriage and divorce or whether it be natural or spiritual or whatever it means you've got to accept it right that's right we'll go sometimes come in the office i'll be glad to sit down with you and we'll just use that 6 30 and let you click on it for the new testament word for divorce it basically comes down to being put away but look at the many many many hundreds of times it's used in the scripture that has that same basic meaning behind it right see we just play with words you saw i put her away but i didn't divorce her you ain't got enough sense to come in out of the ring rain sorry that's true and we're going to get into the scriptures we're going to go down through the scriptures when i say write down your questions write down your thoughts why does it say this and we will try to cover it see why it says it that way because you know the bible says exactly the bible says it's exactly right that's right that's what i like about it one scripture will quit thank you for everyone matthew 5 31 we read 32 it has been said whosoever shall put away his wife giving glasses let him give her a writing of divorcement but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery and whosoever marry shall marry her that is divorced committed to adultery that's exactly right amen that's scripture there's no playing with the scriptures then we have to have a grace to be given i don't want anybody to stay lost in the wording and say well there's no hopes for me what are you doing here if there's no hope for you you're trying to find truth ain't you all right amen the truth shall set you free see then we're searching for truth this message is true i said something to a man one time about something like that and he said he went after what everybody said brother dale said i wasn't even a christian wouldn't say i didn't say that i said if you act like that then you're not saved that's exactly what i'm saying and i won't back up right if i act like that really i'm just the devil you know right that's simple but you see what i'm trying to get is to the point like i told a brother one time i said talking about a certain place i said anywhere in the world needs to be married in divorce that need to be preached i can count the names and look down through there and figure out this person this woman's got about four different kids but four different husbands you know but i figure somebody needs a grace well you know what and i'll restate it if that's not preached to where you can accept it how can it be done right that's right that's good you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free that's right but if you don't know the truth then go do what the truth says that's why i said and i said this 30 almost 40 years ago i said according the way i understand most of the people that follow this message are going to die and go by the grave and i may be the number one guy that i was talking about that's all right but i'm telling the truth that's not de-christianizing nobody that's right because to die and go by the grave sister cletus said if i go by the grave i get to beat you up i remember that about 40 years ago he said i'll beat you up because the dead and christ should rise first but listen if you don't know that you need to be saved how can you be saved if you don't know you need to grace the marriage and divorce how are you going to check are you going to get there and claim stupidity and not know where or what the word would be used you know no we can't play that i didn't say that the biggest portion of people of this mess is going gonna die and go to hell now you misinterpreted what i said i said they're gonna go by the grave and i may be one of them and everybody i'm looking at may be one of them but it's because we haven't accepted the message to set us free right to work because that bride is standing there for that change in a moment a twinkle of an eye is going to be a world born bride there won't be no denominational husband to be dealing with when that comes along there won't be no imagine divorce problems that's right yes sir you want a quote fart i'll give it this afternoon they asked brother brown a question said can double married people go into rapture look at it this afternoon you know what his answer was i don't know but we believe a prophet we don't believe that quote yeah that was what he said laid on my desk if you're going to read it when you go by they asked him the question can people have a husband and a living wife can they go in the rapture he said i don't know you know maybe after 40 years i found what he said because of what i tried to say 40 years ago i never tried to scare nobody it's not you know yourself i don't try to scare these kids into salvation you can't work it that way i never tried to scare anybody into believing the message or to doing any certain thing i've always tried to preach the truth let the truth set us free because you can't make these kids get saved but you can put christ out there let them see christ and let them see the life that you live amen and that can lead them to christ a whole lot more than all the sermons brother dale can bring to the pool you let them see christ in you take on these things what is a marriage can you make your bibles what is a divorce to say i do not want these vows to be of any truth anymore i want to disassociate myself from that person that's why i said you better go check it out because you see if you didn't go down there and say i want to disassociate myself you might find out that there's still some legal binding you better know them that's right all right okay think what you want to about brother dale but is it the truth that's right that's all it says is it the truth you don't understand me in my case if i didn't know we had a case right i thought where we messed up in the garden was where eve wanted a case to be done i think is that what the prophet said she said i think she was making her own case right but you see there is a truth that'll set us free there's going to be a bride that's going to walk off this earth that's right and i want to be part of that don't you that's fine with me no problem but i want to be here to see the children amen i want to be here to see that change the moment and i'll know for certain it's all in grace number 94 inspiring anybody foreign i am me glorious me there will be is know some of you i know how the mind works and you can be standing looking at somebody and they can be telling you something you don't even hear it now brother branham they asked him the question could people double married going to rapture he said i don't know that was before the grace of marriage and divorce was preached but now listen folks why can't we be honest if i could not receive the grace of marriage indoors but yet realized that jesus christ has set my soul free and that i would have to go by the grave so what i'm happy amen i got away he's malay he's the one who take care of it that's right man that's right it shouldn't be that we'd say well i don't know whether i make it he's already made it the new earth will make sure that we go in the rapture yes but we may have to go by the grave and come out to god no problem no problem can you say well are you going to accept the secondary no no no i ain't accepting no secondary i'm saying that i want to be one of them but if i have to go the other way that's god's way of doing it it's not whether or not i accept it it's whether or not he accepts me no it's all settled in him make sure you don't misunderstand because i've had people to accuse me of saying things that i never said a word of it i had no intention to say things like that but yet they've accused me of saying it will come bring the tape let me hear it if i say it i'll be glad to apologize i'll be glad to tell the world on the internet to sex service that i was wrong but you see the truth has set us free father we thank you for today and you love we thank you for your grace and guidance we pray that what we said has been worthy lord jesus just let it be you that would come on the scene now and speak to our hearts and our lives and to make us to be what you want us to be we just want to be christians in you living the right kind of life and being what we're supposed to be and lord why would that not be our desire and we ask you to just help us guide us now as we go and eat natural meals and things bring us back this afternoon in your love guide us each one forgive our sins keep us clean in you lord we love you in jesus name amen you're dismissed meet against us is me i'll see you like away oh is me
