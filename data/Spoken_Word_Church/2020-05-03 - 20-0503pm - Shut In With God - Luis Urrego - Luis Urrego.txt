that the ones out there in parking lot and those viewing at home are doing well and blessed by his wonderful exceeding blessings in this hour Amen we are blessed people in this hour amen I believe that and where no matter if the things are bleak no matter things look look bad amen but I believe that we are blessed people still because God's in control Amen you and I you and me may not be in control but God is and God's very aware that you and I his bride is still here on this earth and that's all he cares about amen praise God so so we're just going to go ahead and go to the word but we're gonna read from Isaiah chapter 26 Isaiah chapter 26 Isaiah 26 we'll start at verse 1 I'm gonna read verse 1 through 8 and then I'm gonna read verses 17 through verse 21 Bible says here Isaiah in that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah we have straw we have a strong City salvation will God a point for walls and bulwarks open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee trust ye in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength let's go down to verse 17 pay attention to these verses like as a woman with child that draw earth near the time of her delivery is in pain and cries out and her pains so have we been in thy sight O Lord we have been with child we have been in pain we have as it were brought forth wind we have not raw any deliverance in the earth neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen the dead man shall live together with my dead body shall they arise awake and sing ye that dwell and dust for thy due is as the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead amen come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be over past for behold the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain I want you to keep in mind saying to that as we read these things you know the Bible said and the Bible has compound meanings amen so it can be talking this is applying to to Israel they men but I believe also it's applying to us in this hour amen I was looking at this scripture in it and it the other day and I noticed this you may have read it before not but I thought it was very appropriate especially when this hour that we're living in and I just wanted to title this amen this call it shut in with God shut in with God amen so we're gonna look at something here in just a moment then you just pray for us maybe the Lord will give us something that can help us during this hour amen let's just borrow hats our precious Heavenly Father we come be for you Lord once again we thank you Lord for the opportunity that we have to open back the pages of your word Lord and father we know the Lord Jesus that without you we are nothing father God without you Lord God we would surely fall Lord where would we be father if it wasn't for your mercy and grace in this hour Lord God father some of us would be in a hospital Lord God some of us would be fathered maybe in a jail cell Lord and some of us father maybe in a casket dead Lord God but Lord Jesus who do you father God to bring us father got into this very hour that we are living in father because Lord you have promised in your word that you would have abroad without spot or wrinkle Lord Jesus and I believe father God with all my heart that that's that's the people that I'm standing here with in this building in this our Lord Jesus and Lord God you or you will have a many membered brought and you do have a many member brought in this our Father throughout all the world Lord Jesus and I pray that you help us to step into that promise Lord God because father God it is father God real and it is your truth lord I ask that you'd meet the needs amongst us now father God speak to us through your word Lord Jesus and help me to get aside Lord Jesus so that you'd speak only father God what you desire for your people to hear Lord God and not my own words but your words Lord we commit ourselves into you now commit this time can continue to be with brother Wade Lord and traveling bring them back safely and father God would just thank you once again for your blessings in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen god bless you Saint you may be seated in this hour amen amen so we want to look at something here because I believe as you and as you and I know you know we've experienced in the past few months some pretty abrupt changes and and all of us can definitely feel that those changes have impacted us one way or another and I don't think anybody in this world could say that these changes have not impacted us amen but you know most of us in our mind would have never fathomed Amen how quickly society and the way of life would have changed the way it was two months ago it's completely different today Amen we went had never fathomed that things would have turned out like this and the things to turn in a blink of an eye amen panic and fear you know has struck the the land has struck the people of the world you go out to the store you know yesterday we were out in them in the in the market and you can just see it in their eyes you can see it in the people's eyes there they're not reacting the same it's totally different of course that's all you can see is their eyes but but you can just see it it's it's totally changed them amen and it's completely it's completely fulfills what what God said in the word amen that then the last days man's hearts will be failing them for fear for the things that would come to pass mning on the earth amen we're seeing before our very eyes an economy that had been flourishing amen for the past three and a half years they had been growing amen we've seen it in two months completely tanked record numbers of unemployment business is shutting down people in lines four or five hours in cars waiting for just some free groceries it's totally different people who had stable jobs for many years now don't even have business now they're facing businesses shutting down now they're facing layoffs and looking for unemployment something that they've never even done before and that's what we're seeing in this hour amen and we are also seeing Amen where where the assembling of ourselves together to worship has been hindered something that you are not have at least in my lifetime I've never seen the way it has been hindered in this hour the way that you and I in this hour we desires the true son and daughter of God desire to fulfill what it says there in Hebrews where it says do not forsake themselves of your SEM assembling together we desire that as a true son and daughter of God yet is being hindered in this hour and and you know what saints it might be hindered the way it is right now and it probably may get worse later down the road but you know what the thing is that we need to we need to ask ourselves things are still you still have food on your table you still have clothes on your back we still can open the church doors and we still can see one another we could still call one another we could still talk one another even if it is through text or whatever amen but a my couple point in time where none of we're not going to be able to even walk through those doors what if it comes to that point in time because brother Branham even talked about these things they might turn these churches into storehouses now I'm not trying to bring fear I'm not trying to bring panic but I'm trying to get to a point what are you going to do then if you are not allowing this opportunity right now to experience and to draw closer to God because I believe God is very mindful that his bride is here on earth and he only cares about two things fulfilling his word and for his bride to get ready amen so if he if that's the only things he took that he cares about and if you are struggling in this hour to even take the opportunity to draw closer to God to get in his word to pray more to seek Him more to let him talk back to you because I believe we have more time than we ever had before I believe that with all my heart I know I have and if you are not getting into God in this hour and you think that you could just still live life the way Amen that means you have a spiritual personal problem that you need help from God because things are going to get worse later on churches are going to close and you're not going to have a physical place to worship and what then you better be in Christ you better be in his word you better be in a personal relationship with God because the government's not going to save you nobody is going to save you only God in his word his name Amen there's a strong tower Amen in this hour for you and I for those that love Him praise God so we know that God is coming back for his bride you know in the midst of this panic and confusion God is only concerned about coming to get that little bride God isn't concerned about you and I remember he said that he would not put more on a stay where we could handle right he said that in his word now we still have it easy yes we do this isn't nothing amen it could get a little bit more squeezed later on a little bit more squeeze later down the road what will you do then what will you do then what attitude will you have then amen and I believe that right now this is a little time for us to get ready for that this is that's how God don't see it as a bleak thing as a you know as a as a terrible thing see it as an opportunity for you and I in this hour because I believe it's an opportunity for us in this hour amen and and he he made a promise God made a promise to her through his word and she's believing that promise we're believing that promise that God is going to fulfill that promise amen that he has made to us through his word and you know it reminds me of that story that brother Brown told about that little girl that little washed girl who was looking who was minding her own business and she was the not as pretty as the girls the local girls in the town and she was just minding her own business doing her work just being a just a little washed girl and there came one time a man from another state a rich a rich young man looking for a bride he was looking for a woman that he wanted to marry and he went to that specific town to find himself a wife he looked at all the the neighboring all the girls in the town and there just none of them could fit hit what he was looking for they they were they look pretty they had beautiful clothes they might even have come from lines of families that were rich but you know what it didn't fit what he was looking for until he saw that little washed girl and that little washed girl a man had a character in her a man that he had not seen in any of the other ones but he saw it in her and she just kept to mind her business minding her business and probably what drawed her to his attention his day she wasn't there trying to get his attention that's that's a good girl young man if you are if you see her just telling you this you see girls they were trying to get your attention you better believe that might be a one to stay away from I'm just telling you young people she was not there trying to flirt with him she was not there trying to get his attention amen she was just minding her business and he said that's the one I want so he went up to her and he said are you willing to marry me and she said yes but she but he said all right I'll come back a year from now and that stood to her that was such a great thing for her and it was it was locked in in her for a whole year that's all she had in her mind he's coming for me the same time next year amen he's coming for me that he promised it and I believe it and everything she did a man it was because she was wanted for that promise to be fulfilled amen it was she was so concentrated on that promise she was locked down by that promise made to her she couldn't do anything but to keep that promise in the forefront of everything that she did and you know what says that little girl that that young girl amen and we know the story eventually he came back the same year and took her away people filled his promise and brother Brian typed that as the bride and crying Christ amen God has promised us in this hour great things to take place we're still looking for a resurrection to take place what a great promise that we have in this hour that the dead Saints shall rise amen and that we are going to see them physically walk among us and after that a rapture a man to meet him in the sky I don't know of any greater thing than that Saints that trumps any any virus that trumps anything going on right now with the government that trumps anything amen look into those things amen that trumps it all amen but you know what that little girl that young watch girl she was probably in her room it secretly every day every now and then in the little room that she was looking at she would look at herself in the mirror and say how could she he choose me how in the world could he choose me and she'd look at herself I'm not like the other girls I mean look at the pretty gowns they have look at what they have and yet what came back to her was that promise that promise was what motivated her but he said Amen he said that he was coming back I don't know why but he said he was and I'm just gonna and she would maybe look and see how that that wedding gown she would eventually she eventually got that wedding gown and she would try it on every now and then just like you and I a man should be being dressed on a daily basis with that wedding gown that word and she would look and see it knit and injure yes it looks good it looks good but she would then she would have to take it off because eventually that marriages was gonna take place she wanted to preserve it amen for us Saints in this out we need to keep that wedding garment on amen consistently amen praise God and and just to move on eventually eventually Saints that promise that was made to her became a reality to her amen and the same thing with us Saints that promise that was made to us through his word will become a reality to you and I it may not feel like it right now it may not even look like it right now but I believe that it is becoming that reality there's things that we see that we saw as a shadow the things that we see as a shadow will eventually become the reality amen you will be able to touch it and feel it amen praise God so we've been hearing that term locked down a lot lately and and and I was looking I was looking at what that term means and it in two meanings that caught my attention was a state of isolation or restricted access instituted as a security measure another one is a freeze or a pause now we see it in the end of physical amen but we also know remember I always keep this in the forefront God still has his people here on earth you and I are still are if you're part of the Bride of Christ you and me are still here on earth nothing can be whole nothing can be it can be follows without God knowing about it nothing can be follows or can or can hurt us without God not not not knowing or allowing it in our lives if it happened to job and that was in the old test and how much more in the house under the new birth with the Holy Ghost that's that promise stands firmly and I know that it stinks that we have to stay locked in and we have to end out and you know we thank God for a little bit of opening seems like some governments are opening them back up a little bit more but you know what Saints to you and I we should still be shut in spiritually we should still be shut in do you realize that maybe God is allowing this because you're so in you're so caught up you were so caught up two months ago with your daily routine of life with your with your with with the constant things of this way of this world dragging you down and God's given you an opportunity get in and get shut in with him now it's the time you know it was when Elijah amen he heard him through the through the Thunder roaring through the cyclone passing by through the Lightning flashing but it was when that still small voice came in that he said yes God is here and he heard from God and it's in that still small voice that God wants to talk to you and he's been trying to talk to his people throughout this whole time let's just say 50 years he's been trying to speak to us in a still small voice but we don't we fail to hear him because we allow everything else in our lives to drown that still small voice out we allow TV we allow movies with our video games we allow people we allow the news we allow everything around us with jobs and even family to draw that step that's still small voice out of our lives but now you have no excuse now you we have no excuse amen you know one thing's for sure Saints got with this I've said God's allowing it it doesn't matter what you or I personally think about what's happening you know you have your opinion I may have my opinion but one thing's for certain god amen is on the scene it is in control amen god amen it still has a many membered bride in this our living on this earth that is going to fulfill that promise amen somebody is going to manifest Jesus Christ even in this kovat 19 hour amen because he promised that he that there would be a bride without spot or wrinkle amen it doesn't matter but God is very mindful that his little bride is still here on earth praise God and you know I personally like I said I personally believe that the things that are unfolding at this time our opportunities for you and I to get in tune with God to get in tune with God amen this is an opportunity for God to fulfill his promise of having a broad without spot or wrinkle they meant through you through you in this hour it's so easy to get caught up with the with the physical things of this life look what second Corinthians chapter four says if the brothers can bring that up so you can read it along with me second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 17 says Paul saying for our light affliction which is but for a moment I think that with it's a light affliction because none of us are in a hospital right now none of us are are we still are eating steak we're still we're still enjoying entertainment and things as such for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory verse eighteen while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal amen praise God those are the things that we need to look at amen we can get so caught up with the news we could get so caught up with what's going on amen but those are things that are seen it's the things that are unseen that God is trying to get our attention with and that's what we try we shun away because it's not so glamorous and it's not so pretty and I don't understand it but that's the only thing that's gonna those are the things that are gonna change your body those are the things the things that are not seen is what will change your body the things that are not seen is what will bring the dead from the ground amen those are the things that that that matter in this life because look the things that are seen are temporal the Bible says but the things which are not seen are eternal just as eternal as that word that's in you right now amen right praise God so what should we be looking at and so this one a good go with this in into the the heart of the message I guess because Saints in there are many instances in the scripture where being shut-in was a necessity for both safety and spiritual reasons and you could see it in many different scriptures in many different passages let's look at for example Noah and his family Noah and his family shut-in the ark safe from the storm now God was the one who told him to build that Ark God was the one who said I have found no grace and nobody else but Noah and it was it was it was big I guess Noah had believed God's Word before then God wouldn't didn't mine to give him his word to go build an ark amen so he built that Ark took God by his promise he'd never seen rain he'd never seen anything like that but he he believed God and he went on and took out of his promise and look what Genesis 716 says and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as God had commanded him and watched the Lord shut him in and the Lord shut him in it was the Lord that shut Noah and his family in and as they were shut in God was still in control chaos was outside the world was dying the world was drowning the animals were dying nature was in chaos but he was safe in the Ark of God he was safe because he was in his promise he was an obedience to his word amen and that's what God wants us to be in this our Saints to be in obedience to his word when you are in obedience to his word amen then God can it God is able to take you out out of out of a tutu to keep you safe in this hour when you are in obedience to his word amen when you believe his word God can keep you safe in this hour let's look at for example the children of Israel when they first ate the Passover there's another look what what look what Exodus 12 21 23 says or it says then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lentil and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out at the door for his house until the morning and we know that it was because the death angel was coming through but you know what Saints they had to obey the prophets word first because otherwise whether they were out or they were in there's the angel if they didn't obey that word the angel was still gonna what is going to get that firstborn they had to be in obedience to that word they had to be amen and then it was inside there it was inside there that they did they were able to gather with their families and feed off the lamb have communion with one another and with the lamb eat off the land and you know what they had to eat all of it not just a little bit but all of it they had to eat so it was a time for them that God allowed Hey look the Angel of Death is out here in this hour amen but you can be safe inside amen nope not physically I don't mean physically but I'm talking about you safe ins in Christ amen feeding off of him eating off his word amen and that word changing you from the inside out preparing you for deliverance in this hour amen because it's going home time Saints it's going home time and for the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two posts the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you amen praise God how many thank God for that amen another example we can look at is God watching over David shutting him in in the caves from Saul you know it was God that led David amen through in his lifetime sure David make mistakes and sure David fell and David did his own thing at times but you know what God was in control of his life amen he knew his heart David had a heart Amen that I want I want to serve God I want that that's he's the only one that that fulfills my life killing a giant in fulfill his life being the king didn't fulfill his life but the only thing that fulfill his life is being in constant fellowship with him in his word amen and he expresses this throughout the Psalms many times look what songs fifty seven one says he says to the chief musician out to shift mix them of David when he fled from Saul in the cave be merciful unto me O God be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in DEA in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge until these calamities be over passed there was a time it was a time of worrying and in frightened during this time that he was being chased chased down by Saul because he knew that Saul wanted his life and say Satan in this hour wants your life he would do anything he could if he could take your life oh my but you know what God has hidden us Amen especially his little bride he has hidden us in his bosom in that spiritual cave amen we're not even Satan can do anything to us unless God allows it amen unless God permits it amen he cannot hurt one hair on top of your head amen you know I was reading I was listening to this Jewish rabbi the other day and he brought out something very interesting he said David one time was and you may have heard this but one time David was walking through the fields when he was younger caring for his dad's sheep and he was just looking at nature and how and how nature would produce something they would give back something the honeybee would give back honey you know the the the the the the calf would give meet you see the cow would give me the or give milk the the sheep would give wool a man they would give back something and then he started he was walking and he noticed the spider he noticed a little spider and he said he could not pinpoint why it was the reason for the spider he said what is the reason for the spider and so later later on years down the road when he came to this point in his life where saul was was was was chasing him he went into a cave and saul was nearby but there was a little spider that had made a little spider web at the entrance of the cave and saul and his men then bothered looking into that cave because they do you think there was anybody in there because of the little spider web and they just walked by now this is a this is according to the I think it was in the Talmud the the Hebrew Talmud and I don't know if it's true or not but he they would realize there is a purpose for all things all things have a purpose it was in that moment that little insignificant spider amen you might know it's saying in the corner and it's probably just sitting there doing it you think it's not doing anything but God has it there for a purpose and you know what a spider has one of the strongest materials there isn't in the world and that's their web that little bitty thing could be a little small bitty spider not necessarily a big one but the size of your hand but it could it could be a little spider God has a purpose for all that just as these little times as these times that we have saints we don't may not understand them but God has a purpose for all of it sings God has a purpose for why we are here in this hour with so many few people God has a purpose for amen it's it's difficult especially for us ministers do not get the sisters amens too a man but it's it's God knows the reason why a man God knows the reason why you know we look at Jesus another example Jesus being shut in there was a time where he had to be shut in with God you know he had he he was within himself he was a human just as much as he was God and and he was he didn't want to go and die on that cross humanly Ethan wants him but he knew something deep down and in him caused them and would push him this must needs to be happen in the read and the thing that that pushed him was not really the fact to do it but it was because the word needed to be fulfilled there were scriptures in the Bible that needed to be fulfilled even right there on the cross so many promises and so many scriptures were fulfilled even just right there on the cross but Jesus came to that point that he had to die to himself he got down and he said Lord let it not be my will but thy will be done it was in the secret of the night while the disciples were sleeping and nobody knew anything about it but God was doing something supernatural there in the min in that moment and God gave him the strength amen and angels came down and ministered to him amen and you and I in this hour we cried we have to have our own gets M&E amen could it be this time could it be this is the time for us to have our own gets M&E amen you may not understand it and you may not want to go through it you know what Saints a battle in my mind this is me speaking but I battle in my mind humanly speaking because I think of my daughters I think of my wife I think of my family I think of their innocency and I think of what what what could happen to them but yet I have to I have to sit and say Lord you promised in your word that you would give me my children you promised in your word that none that you you would you would protect not just me but you would protect my family as well they men you promised it in your word Lord and you have to believe God's Word and get down and say Lord this is what you promised and so this is what I'm gonna act upon is that there's no sense of me and worrying there's no sense in me and in amen when there's still glorious things to look forward to and I know that those scriptures still need to be fulfilled and I'm gonna be here to fulfill them by God's grace I'm gonna be here to see a resurrection amen by God's grace God doesn't take me before that and I believe that you desire the same thing as well amen so Jesus he had to isolate himself from the world in order to receive strength from from on high amen and then another great thing that took place is deal 120 120 in the upper room they had to shut themselves in yeah they had to shut themselves in in order for them to receive power amen to go and and do what they did afterwards we know this story I'm not going to dwell there but they were scared they were scared of the Sanhedrin they were scared of the the Jews out there they were scared all they had was just the promise of Jesus and with that promise a man they went in but they came out with much more than that better than that fulfill in their lives amen because why they shut themselves in it was just damning God and said Lord you said in your you said before you ascended yeah that you would do this and you would send the Holy Ghost amen and we believe it and that settles it and God did the rest well do you want that in your life and decide or we're gonna just go just sit back and look at that news and be afraid and scared and and and or do you want to come out with power from on high amen I believe we need to be sensitive sensible I'm not saying for us not to be sensible but there should be something within us a man that that's more than what's going on in this earth they meant draws you to a greater promise than CNN and in the NBC amen and that's his word that's his promise yes you notice that that that pyramid this this this smaller pyramid is much smaller it's a smaller little little little little putt and nobody knows anything about Harley that's where God wants to meet us amen and that little secret that in that little secret room amen you know if you look back at the woman at the well you know she had she had life going on she had five husbands and we know but and living her life and and probably just it was a daily routine amen but one day she went again to the well as she had accustomed to go every day at noon after all the other girls had gone she had to go there by herself but she couldn't be with the other girls who were pure and virgin and she was she was marked by the world she was marked but one time there was the Lord Jesus right there in that in that well right there sitting right there next to that well and you better believe he knew exactly why he was there cuz the Bible says so he knew exactly what was gonna happen and he was not afraid to be seen with a woman that was marked read by society he wasn't scared of that he was looking for that soul he was looking for he was looking Amen to have to have something change in her life and right there when she took the time to talk to the word when she took a little secret away from from this from the main city away from from society she right there where the well of water was there was a physical well of water but yet the real well of water was the one talking to her talking to her and because she took that time God was able to do something great for her in that out discerned her life she she went running to the gum see a man who told me the things that I've done and you know that's what can happen to you and I when we get in secret with God amen nobody has to know amen nobody has to know but you and God and when you and when you take God at His Word and you say Lord I believe your word and that settles it Lord Here I am talk to me he but I believe he'll speak back to you sometimes we think that we have to do all of the speaking when we pray when we but is God also wants to talk to us God also wants to talk to us through his word and if you just stay still sometimes you he'll even put things in your mind and in your heart that's how that's happened to me because the Bible says that it'll be the Holy Ghost speaking through you amen those things that are needful in this hour amen amen I'm almost done Saints do you remember that little secret brew roomed that brother branham's saw there in that vision now if you read in Psalms chapter 91 verse 1 Psalms 91 Bible says here he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty amen and it's interesting that David put it that way he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High not not that that not that that stays there for a little of temporarily amen but that dwelleth in amen you dwell in your home you don't just stay there three days out of the year you dwell in it 365 days of the years you know unless we're in a hotel somewhere traveling you live in your home you dwell in your home you reside in your home amen and so God wants us to dwell in the secret place of the Most High not just two times out of the week not just when you come to church amen every single time every single day every morning every evening amen it's time to dwell in the secret place of the Most High that's an opportunity for you to dwell in the secret place of the Most High amen and he that does that shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling in verse 10 of that same chapter amen now look what look what Jesus said here in Matthew 6:6 I'm trying to move a little quickly but thou when thou pray is to enter into that closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly hey that's how God works how doesn't work in the end the Great and the great loud things god works in secret again Saints everything that has taken place in this hour is because God is trying to speak to you and he in secret amen because you and me are still here on this earth his bride is still here on this earth keep that in mind because we it can we can easily get so fearful and so scared and so and so terrified but say hey wait a second I'm still here and if you know where you're standing in God a man that should all right God has something for me to fulfill then Amen brother Dale amen he's still here with us because he's got a work to fulfill amen brother Don you have a work to fulfill brother mark brother brother Zak each and every one of us has a work to still fulfill otherwise we would have been gone a long time ago so God's not done with you and young people young people every single day that you have the opportunity to serve God amen take that opportunity don't wait til tomorrow what you can do today today is the day of salvation the Bible says the Bible says it's today it doesn't say next week or next year because you don't know things changed in two months what about in the year you better you better be in God young people you better be in crowd and and don't look so much to the current things that you are trying to achieve in this hour because you may not even get there but your soul amen your soul is more important to God and that's what we need to be be be more interested in sure we need to still plant our potatoes we still need to plant for life we still as if God was if as Jesus was coming in a hundred years but the brother branham said you need to live your life as if you use coming tomorrow so are we living our lives as if he's coming today tonight this tomorrow morning or we're just so consumed about what we need to do about our businesses are about a career about marriage about all these things amen you may not even get to that point you may not even get to that point I would love to see my my daughter's married I don't know if I'll get to that point but you know what I better do everything I can for them amen spiritually speaking because that's the thing that's going to last eternal you better do whatever you need to do amen eat for the eternal build your treasures put your treasures in heaven amen put your treasures in heaven Jesus say amen look what brother Branham says you're going back to this secret place now Jesus told us to enter into our closet and when thou has shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret again there's the shutting of the door there's the shutting in amen but the brown says here in this in this message he says let's just go down to the area down here and it says go up a little bit okay and it left me and around and it went right down over the top of that of that audience and went and stood over the top of that little building and then settled down on top of it and this is when brother Branham was having the vision about that little that little room that little room where the people were going in sick and they were coming out healed and then when it did this one that was standing by me but behind me the same voice the Angels voice he said I'll meet you in there and this is the third pool but nobody will know nothing about it and I personally believe that that third pool is the opening of the word in the side in you and I Saints amen and I said well I don't understand why in there why there you know why not in the church well why not ending in in Rome why not in Jeffersonville why not in Arizona huh he said it will not be a public show this time hey man hey God God's not interested in in public shows God not interested in in clowning around for the devil like brother Browne said when Jesus was being tempted by Satan and I said I don't understand going into that closet like that and he said is not it written by our Lord when thou pray us be not like the hypocrites who like to be heard before man but enter into the secret closet and pray to the Father who see if in secret and he who see it in secret shall reward thee openly it's perfectly to the scripture every time and I said I understand a man next ness scripture I mean next quote he said watch and this woman when she come out of there on the ambulance stretcher she was pushing the stretcher out the other side and she said the lady asked her with the said what happened she said I don't know it just happened she said I've been in this stretcher said I've been down in bed for years and Here Come the man out packing his crutches and they asked him what said he didn't know and he was coming to the platform to testify and I said I don't understand that in there see brother Branham didn't understand that in there he didn't understand the division and watch watch what he says and watch he's always scriptural he said they're not our Lord say when they'll praise beam I like the hypocrites they'd like to make a show said enter into the secret closet and when you've done so close the door then pray to your father and what see if in secret in he see if in secret shall reward thee openly and he said you remember that name that you were hunting that time that you dreamed about and I said yes he said I'll meet you in there this time it won't be a public show and the vision left me now what's interesting that he tells him to remember that name that you were hunting that time next next quote god only has one meeting place he said over there in the book of Exodus that I have chosen the place to put my name and that's the only place that I'll meet people and he has chose a place to put his name and where he puts his name that's where he met Israel he has got a place that he meets his church today and he chose that name and that name is Jesus Christ and there is where he meets the true believer when he is in Jesus Christ that's where God chose to put his name you say God's name he said I came in my father's name so that's where God put his name was in Christ and in Christ is where we can all meet under the shed blood and there have real true Fellowship amen and I like what brother Dale said this morning you know about about I forgot the thought now towards the end he said something regarding the us that that uh yeah forget that I forgot now anyways but that Christ being the firstfruits amen and yes brother Brandon was the first was was the way she fame and Wade in this hour a member that needs to also be applied to a many member bribe as well they meant Amen because it's the same Christ amen well we we are under that same name as well amen praise God it's in Christ where we can all meet under the shed blood and there have true real fellowship and I don't know if there's a there's one more here or not praise God God's chosen place of worship my friends I don't want to hurt feelings but I am responsible for a message and that message has come out of this mess and if I ask you to come out where am I going to take you to would I take you to the Branum Tabernacle it's as much fault as any of the rest of them so it's not a physical building it's not in a physical location and it's not an amen it's in Christ they men that's in Christ but there's one place I can take you to where you're safe and protected from death that's in Jesus Christ God's place of worship that's the place I'm introducing to you tonight where God put his name where he promised he would meet every person that come in there he would worship with him and feast with him that's in Christ not in no church no Tabernacle amen so it it God is not doing this again he kept reiterating it's not a public show he kept reiterating it's a secret thing amen and and I believe that is spiritual in this hour because right now this walk with God is between you and God amen it's between you and God it's not between me and brother Dale although brother Dale they meant he be how can be uh he can uh what's the word I'm looking for my mind escapes me yeah he can he can forget the word anyways we can all we can all receive from one another in other words you see but it's it's a relationship between you and God right it's between your god it's it's not between me and Zach and it's not between me and brother Tony it's between you and God and thus our Amen it's in that secret place Amen shut in with God now it's not even it's not even necessarily in your closet door at your house although Jesus said that's where you should pray in a secret place it's not necessarily that Amen it's wherever you hold that name of Christ on high Amen that's where you can meet Christ amen and this hour and I believe it can be anywhere praise the Lord I believe it can be wherever God has pushed you you know proverbs 18:10 says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and are safe amen so great things are in store for the bride in this our Saints you know and like I said a resurrection is coming I want to finish here with these last three verses here the brothers can can bring back Isaiah chapter 26 again and we'll start at verse 19 and we'll finish with this amen Isaiah or we'll start at verse 17 sorry Isaiah 26 like like as a woman with child that draw with near the time of her delivery is in pain and cries out in her pangs so have we been in the sight of Lord Amen I hope that that's that's that's how you are within you amen every day of your life amen should be a revival for you you know we just came out brother Wade preaching a serious on the revival Amen it's a it's a personal thing it's a thing that like I said between you and God in this hour Amen it's a secret thing that the world will not know anything about but it's so powerful that it's gonna resurrect the dead it's so powerful that it's going to take us in a rapture it's so powerful that's going to give us amen to fulfill and to and to show forth everything that needs to be manifested in order for us to fulfill his word because God has done his part now he's entrusted for us to do our part amen and we can only do it only through the Holy Spirit only through only through his through his power it's not your power it's not it's not it's not my power but it's God's power in this hour amen the power of the Holy Ghost in this hour and it's not the wind and it's not the the rain and it's not the Thunder Bay man but it's something secret that I don't even hear you don't even hear but God doing something powerful in our lives like as a woman with child that draws near the time of her delivery is in pain and cries out in her pangs so have we been in the sight of the Lord we should be with child right now get ready to be delivered to deliver we should be in other words that's talking about pregnancy a woman pregnant we should be pregnant with Christ amen get ready to deliver amen in this hour and it's painful I've never been through it but I've seen my wife go through it and I know it's not fun cuz I saw her and I helped her and and and it's not fun don't worry there were other other nurses and stuff around at the same time I wasn't just there by myself but verse 18 says we have been with child we have been in pain we have as it were brought forth wind we have not robbed any deliverance in the earth neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen you know Saint I think a brother I think of our precious brother dick who has just gone on sometimes you know when the saints go I almost am be them you know and I feel I feel happy for them I don't really get sad yes it's sad and I understand especially their a family member but but if they were if they were if they were in Christ amen that to me is brings a joy inside of me amen and I feel excited and it's almost like an envious I want to be in that place to not have to go through through these things that are taking place in this hour and not be under that Amen but you know what Saints again God has you and I here in this hour Amen because brother dick had fulfilled his part now it's you and I turn to fulfill our part amen verse 19 die dead man shall live together with my dead body shall they arise amen awake and sing ye that dwell in dust for that I do is as the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead the earth there's gonna point kind of point on where that's gonna be fulfilled amen that's gonna be fulfilled Christ resurrection a man is the pledge and the earnest of the dead in Christ amen Christ's resurrection is that is that is that earnest that God has given the dead that have come that have also died in Christ because he lives but they also will live amen praise God now now because we have that promise verse 19 we have that promise that the dead shall live and then verse 20 says in 2 so come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be over past because we have these promises amen it's time for us to shut ourselves in with God with these promises with that word the promise that he said he's gonna come and come back for us amen and for us to meet him in the air praise God for behold the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity and we know that's going to happen all the kings and all the rulers and all the people that think that they're in charge don't know that God's somebody's somebody's in charge there they're gonna be punished they think they're in control God's the one who's ultimately in control the inhabitants they will punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain there's no way sayings that when you when they're powerful people in this hour with Christ in you to prevent Paul said to prevent from those resurrecting out of the ground or those coming out coming uh coming back the dead in Christ rising amen there there's no way for us to hinder that I meant that that leads to that Amen when we are shut in and died amen I hope you all understood my thought amen sometimes you know you get these thoughts in your head and there's you know they're real to you but you can't bring them out exactly the way you want to I know where the dill probably knows what I'm talking about brother Aaron and other Minister brother here but Saints I'm what I'm getting to is be still and know that He is God be still don't don't don't don't jerk from left to right or this that on the other a man just be still and know that God is in complete control and this is your opportunity as I said last sermon last message that I preached this is your opportunity to shine but the world may not see it but it's gonna be between you and God but it will produce something great in this hour because Saints what else is gonna bring the dead from the grow the dead is it you watching the news constantly no is it is it you playing video games and watching Netflix is it you what or is it you worrying constantly and look into the things that are seeing know what's gonna bring the dead Saints to come amen and for us to get into a rapture is you abiding in Christ amen saying and secret in that name having your own personal time with God continually reading his word that's staying in that secret place continually praying that's being in that secret place continually come into church doing what you can do because we have great promises to look to in this hour amen it's not it's not it's not over it's just getting started amen it's just getting started amen god bless you saints if the minister if the musicians could come amen let's just sing that little course shut in with God in a secret place key of C key of C shut in with God in a secret place praise God what a wonderful hour that we live already no need to be sad no need to be depressed no need to be worried not even need to be angry sure there's lots of injustice that goes on in the world and sure things but you know what the promise of God amen comes me down I just look to the promise because and as a s26 they're said at the beginning as a 26-3 God will put him in perfect peace in perfect peace that his mind stayed on him and on him amen not on Donald Trump no not on him on him the word Amen Donald Trump can't bring me peace nobody can bring me peace on this earth but the word can get in the word and I believe it will give you peace shut in with God in a sea secret place there in the spirit beholding his babies a new power to run in the race I love we're not necessarily physically but spiritually with God in a secret place the world doesn't even know anything about it in the spirit behold in his face a new power to run into the race I love to be shut in with God one more time singing I'll see him now shutting with God shutting with God if you ever need God knows about it us you can meet your need right there now in that place where you are just get in his name the spirit beholding his face a new power to run Oh to be shut it with God amen can you say that that you just love to be shut in with God I've never had one moment where I was shut in with God and you know in in in true real desiring to pray and desire to study his word that he has never let that he has let me down never now when it when when when I go in there because I feel like I have to do that III don't get anything out of that right but when I go in there and there's been times when I just go in and it's like something just cries it within me just to pray and to cry out to God and God oh my I just have a wonderful time with him I've all feel feel like the woman at the will I come out of there so so revived amen but I had to do my part in order for him to do his part amen you have to do your part in desire for him to do his don't expect Amen don't expect for God to do it all and and Amen there's something that you must do don't wait for the minister to pray for you there's something that you must do in the side you can pray for yourself amen no no I don't have to pray for you brother Dale doesn't have to pray for you when it comes to time when we're not gonna be able to pray for you amen we're not gonna be able to meet with one another what are you gonna do then you better be in God you better be in Christ you better be in that headstone amen you better be in that word god bless you Saints continue to pray for one another god bless you the ones that joined amen brother Dale do you have anything you need to say okay all right so let's just bow our heads and and just continue to remember the the needs amongst us and let's just bow our heads before we dismiss our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once again for your word father and thank you Lord for the admonition father that you give us through your word Lord because father God you are wooing
