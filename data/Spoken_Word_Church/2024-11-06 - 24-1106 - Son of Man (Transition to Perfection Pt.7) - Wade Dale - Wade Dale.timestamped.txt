[4:10] president of the United States we know
[4:12] who it's going to be Prophet told us who

[4:17] the United States is just a
[4:18] puppet just a puppet and whoever pulls
[4:21] the strange you'll never know it but the
[4:23] world will know it one day because he's
[4:24] going to quit hiding and he's going to

[4:27] he's going to say hey I'm the one that's
[4:29] been running this place start worshiping
[4:32] me all this other stuff has got to bow
[4:34] down to the Antichrist but thank God we
[4:37] know one thing for sure the prophet of
[4:39] God said we will not be
[4:41] here so we won't see it we may see the
[4:44] workings of it and the coming of it but

[6:07] thankful people in the world amen amen
[6:10] like I said before we we could be that
[6:12] group out there that's worried whether
[6:14] this one's a Democrat and this one's a
[6:16] Republican and this one's a this and
[6:17] this one's of
[6:19] that and some people just get all bent
[6:22] out of shape about it but that's all
[6:24] they got to be bent out of shape about I
[6:26] want to be bent out of shape about the
[6:27] word of God Amen
[6:30] if we would be as passionate as they are
[6:33] in their rallies that's right if we
[6:35] would be that passionate about the word
[6:37] of God we would get out of
[6:41] here we would I mean it's just you look
[6:44] at the fervor that they have I mean
[6:46] thousands of people shouting and
[6:48] screaming over a
[6:52] politician wow anyway remember also
[6:55] brother Tim cross will be here on the
[6:57] 24th brother landland will be here the
[7:00] Tuesday the 26th we'll have church
[7:02] service on Tuesday night not Wednesday
[7:04] night on Thanksgiving weekend which is
[7:07] at the very end of the month now so we
[7:10] got a couple of weeks so just keep us
[7:12] all the in prayer we got a a lot going
[7:15] on in December but we'll announce that
[7:16] later on but just remember the church
[7:18] dinner and all that so if you would turn
[7:20] your Bibles we're going back to Malachi
[7:22] like we
[7:23] were this past Sunday I got some real
[7:27] good comments on the Daniel 7 weeks so
[7:30] we may we may break that down again like
[7:33] that and uh and
[7:36] U I know it's
[7:39] U it's it's hard to understand because
[7:41] it's you have to take a Jewish side of
[7:44] it all right right cuz it is to the Jews
[7:48] right but then there's a spiritual
[7:50] application to us yeah and it is a
[7:52] timeline that tells us where the woes
[7:54] are placed and the vows and the plagues
[7:56] and even where the seals come in cuz the
[7:59] seal
[8:00] I mean the seals are to us but as they
[8:02] open what is the Sixth Seal it's a
[8:04] tribulation so it's over there when the
[8:06] Jews get their message and they're
[8:08] fighting and getting out of there and go
[8:10] six seal goes to them and then Christ
[8:12] comes back and gets gets them and takes
[8:14] them in a Rapture so it all intertwines
[8:17] together so U it's just real nice to be
[8:20] able to understand though instead of
[8:22] having a lot of questions thank you I
[8:25] don't have any more questions now so if
[8:26] you want to bring some more we'll have
[8:28] some maybe next week
[8:30] or next month spiritual progress is like
[8:32] a
[8:35] detoxification think about it we detox
[8:38] everything else let's detox some sin
[8:42] let's detox some wrong ideas and wrong
[8:45] living let's and what is that that's a
[8:47] purging we purge when we detoxify we
[8:50] purge and we get rid of all the garbage
[8:53] well let's have a spiritual
[8:56] detoxification that's what the word of
[8:58] God would do it'll clean you out let's
[9:01] bow our heads dear Lord thank you for
[9:03] this day you give us we appreciate Lord
[9:05] the people that are here tonight and we
[9:08] pray Lord that you be with the ones that

[9:42] in Jesus name we pray amen you know
[9:46] before we read this I want to tell you a
[9:47] little something some of you I know if
[9:49] are watching The Chosen if you hadn't
[9:51] then then you need to um it's a really
[9:55] good uh um it's like brother Jason
[9:58] Watkins said it's it's a human Jesus a
[10:01] lot of the others have made him
[10:02] something so high and mighty till he
[10:05] like dad said he used to think that
[10:06] brother that Jesus was so much God he
[10:08] couldn't stuff his toe well this guy
[10:11] that plays Jesus I mean he's he's real
[10:14] you know he he does a really good job
[10:17] and uh that Dallas Jenkins you know he
[10:19] knows um Neil havala they were they were
[10:23] together for a while so he may know a
[10:25] little bit about the message who knows
[10:27] but you know I was watching last night
[10:29] and and
[10:30] um and
[10:32] U you see the girl that the woman that
[10:35] touched his the Hem of His
[10:37] Garment and you realized
[10:40] it and and and tears were rolling in my
[10:44] eyes as they're beginning to now because
[10:46] that girl we said oh she you know she
[10:49] she had fa she touched the Garment she
[10:51] was made whole I know all you sisters
[10:53] that are here over about 14 years old
[10:55] you know what she was going through but
[10:57] she was not going through that as a
[10:59] monthly cycle it was every
[11:01] day every day there was issue of blood
[11:04] every day for 12 years but not only that
[11:10] let's go back into her life her daddy
[11:13] kicked her out of the house cuz see
[11:15] everything she sat down on was
[11:18] unclean everything she did everything
[11:21] she touched according to the law was
[11:24] unclean she couldn't go in the temple
[11:26] for 12 years she couldn't Worship in
[11:28] that Temple because she was
[11:30] unclean but praise God she met
[11:34] somebody but I never but I never
[11:37] thought why did she say I just let me
[11:40] touch his hem because if she' have
[11:43] touched his skin he'd have been unclean
[11:46] in her mind this is the rabbi this is
[11:49] the one I I want to get to him oh I
[11:52] can't get to him because if I touch him
[11:53] he'll be unclean well she just didn't
[11:55] know who he was but she knew he was
[11:56] different so that was wonderful how she
[11:59] reached under and grabbed that that that
[12:01] blue and white cord that he wore around
[12:03] his waist and she pulled on it and and
[12:05] he said virtue or somebody touched me
[12:08] and then her issue went away what a what
[12:11] a what a powerful thing if you've never
[12:14] I know you've never went through that
[12:15] but my what for 12 years go through
[12:17] something for 12 years every day that
[12:19] you can't even F she couldn't get
[12:22] married she couldn't have no
[12:25] friends if she had that issue everybody
[12:28] that touched her was clean thing she
[12:29] touched was unclean I mean unclean that
[12:31] was horrible that was a horrible 12
[12:33] years but you know what the whole
[12:34] thought of my the whole process the way
[12:36] I was thinking I said God you allowed
[12:38] that to happen you let her suffer
[12:41] through that for 12
[12:43] years just to so that she can show
[12:46] people there can be songs written about
[12:49] her right if I could but touch the him
[12:51] of His Garment there sermons been
[12:54] preached her faith Jesus said you're
[12:57] clean oh my when Jesus looked at you and
[12:59] says you're
[13:00] clean what a mighty God we serve when
[13:03] Jesus tells us we're clean we're clean
[13:06] that's why he looked at that pre that
[13:08] that high and mighty preacher standing
[13:10] there the priest and he said she's clean
[13:13] well when she he said she's clean that
[13:15] was it for me you know she was clean so
[13:17] same way with me and you but to have
[13:19] something like that to let her go
[13:22] through that knowing he'd meet the
[13:24] master knowing he knowing she would meet
[13:26] him but letting her go through it for 12
[13:28] years
[13:29] just to be able to do that and then
[13:31] forever for eternity to be known as the
[13:34] woman that touched the him of His
[13:35] Garment right and the faith he said he
[13:39] said he said this he said I'm Jesus was
[13:41] looking he said I'm just so full of joy
[13:43] she kind of looked at him said because
[13:45] it's your faith it wasn't him it was
[13:47] your faith right amen and he was going
[13:50] you remember he was going to heal jer's
[13:52] he was going to raise jer's daughter
[13:54] from the dead so he had a pretty good
[13:56] journey going through there you know and
[13:59] you know what that same God's
[14:00] here the same God's here to take us and
[14:03] make us
[14:04] clean to clean us up and not be afraid
[14:08] to touch us he wasn't afraid to touch
[14:11] her he you know grabbed her by the hand
[14:12] grabbed her by the face that's it what a
[14:15] mighty God we serve Malachi 4 for behold
[14:18] the day cometh that shall burn as an
[14:19] oven and all the proud ye all that do
[14:21] wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[14:24] that cometh shall burn them up sayith
[14:26] the Lord of host that it shall leave
[14:27] them neither root nor
[14:29] Branch but unto you that fear my name
[14:32] shall the son of righteousness rise with
[14:34] healing in his wings and you shall go
[14:36] forth and grow up as cows of the stall
[14:39] and you shall tread down the wicked for
[14:41] they shall be ashes Under The Souls of
[14:42] your feet in the day that I shall do
[14:45] this sayith the Lord of hosts remember
[14:48] ye the law of Moses my servant which I
[14:50] commanded unto him in wh for all Israel
[14:53] with the statutes and judgments behold I
[14:55] will send you not the world he's going
[14:58] to send you Elijah the prophet before
[15:00] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[15:02] of the Lord he shall turn the heart of
[15:04] the fathers to the children the heart of
[15:06] the children to the fathers lest I come
[15:08] and smite the Earth with a curse
[15:11] Revelations 10 but in the days of the
[15:12] voice of the seventh angel we're
[15:16] here when he shall begin to sound the
[15:19] mystery of God should be finished as he
[15:21] ha declared to his servants the prophets
[15:23] you may be seated in the Lord as his
[15:25] Blessing to the reading of the word I
[15:27] thought that was so that was so real
[15:30] that that sometimes we just think well
[15:32] you know she just kind of crawled
[15:33] through there and touched His Garment it
[15:35] was a one and done thing she'd been
[15:37] suffering for 12 years suffering alone
[15:41] and all the blood that was that she was
[15:43] losing in her body that her body had to
[15:45] make back up and they didn't have things
[15:47] like iron pills and all kind of stuff
[15:48] that you can take now she was just so
[15:50] drained but you know what she said let
[15:52] me just touch His Garment tonight let's
[15:55] just touch His Garment we can hold Jesus
[15:59] tonight by the new birth you can hold
[16:01] him but let's just try to touch the Hemm
[16:03] of His Garment tonight and be made whole
[16:05] and let virtue and strength come from
[16:07] him what he is the word he's the word of
[16:10] God
[16:11] Amen now Zechariah 4 we were talking
[16:14] about
[16:16] Sunday looking at all these scriptures
[16:18] that are pertaining to
[16:20] us I mean us not as somebody else us it
[16:24] pertains to us the bride in the end time
[16:26] all right so these are like I said this
[16:28] this is not we've not gone back into
[16:30] Bible days Bible days has come here yeah
[16:33] we can't go back we don't want need to
[16:35] go back into Bible days Bible days is
[16:37] coming here cuz what's going to happen
[16:39] I'm going to tell you right here at the
[16:40] very end the end of the sermon brother
[16:42] brandham was prophesying
[16:45] forward he tried and he was trying he
[16:48] was getting those Pentecostals out he
[16:50] was telling them to come out of her my
[16:52] people and as J zerubabel means swn in
[16:54] Babylon so he had to come out of Babylon
[16:57] he had to come out of those Pentecostal
[16:58] churches he wanted to bring the people
[17:00] with him but he was not sent to
[17:05] them right he was sent to a group of
[17:08] people forward yeah cuz to be the final
[17:11] voice of the final age while he was here
[17:15] he was the voice but not the final
[17:18] Voice come on he was the voice of God
[17:22] for our age but he wasn't the final
[17:25] voice the final voice is him through a
[17:28] bride yes I don't say him brother
[17:30] Brandon him Jesus in a bride that's the
[17:33] final voice he told us that he said
[17:34] you're the final voice under your
[17:36] messenger you're the final voice to the
[17:38] final age and I believe that the only
[17:41] voice that God has now is his bride amen
[17:43] sure we have him in taping book for him
[17:45] but Ma you can listen to him all the
[17:47] days of your life and still die and go
[17:48] to hell right that's right but once that
[17:51] voice comes alive in your heart and then
[17:53] it speaks out yeah it comes to a
[17:56] revelation that that that has never been
[17:58] known to man since the since Jesus was
[18:01] here and they literally didn't
[18:03] understand him when he was here you keep
[18:05] watching that movie I mean they're just
[18:07] they all scratch their
[18:08] head they've never seen a man like this
[18:12] never a man they said the Bible never a
[18:14] man never a man spoke like this well I
[18:17] say that same thing with brother randam
[18:18] not a man you'll ever hear in your life
[18:20] will ever speak like that man right but
[18:23] now that voice is in us in a multiplied
[18:26] form in the bride speak speak to the
[18:29] people the people are
[18:31] reacting listen folks the people are
[18:33] going to react to the message of this
[18:36] hour that's right yes sir the bride will
[18:39] react now if you're not bride it's just
[18:42] going to be something that you just it's
[18:44] a
[18:45] ritual
[18:47] amen but it's got to be something real
[18:49] it's got to be something that you can
[18:51] identify with that's what I want you to
[18:53] see from now from here till we get
[18:55] finished with this church age you may
[18:57] say that we are identified with
[18:59] everything that's going on in this
[19:01] church age it's been spoken of us now
[19:03] we're living
[19:05] it and we're going to live but we're
[19:07] living it right now yes right we're
[19:10] walking through the
[19:12] Bible all the prophecies we're walking
[19:15] right through them right now all the
[19:18] Prophecies of the end time as brother
[19:19] Ryan has been feeding me some scriptures
[19:21] and I've been finding some about the end
[19:23] time that's specific to the end time
[19:26] right wow there's a lot of them oh yeah
[19:29] oh
[19:31] yeah Zechariah
[19:33] 4:5 then the angel that taught with me
[19:36] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[19:37] not what these be and I said no my Lord
[19:39] this is Zachariah this is the Angel
[19:41] talking to him he answered and spake
[19:43] unto him to me saying this is the word
[19:45] of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by
[19:48] might nor by power but by my spirit
[19:50] sayith the Lord of hosts who art thou oh
[19:52] great Mountain before zerubabel Thou
[19:55] shalt become a plain now watch what
[19:59] happens all right who art thou oh great
[20:03] Mountain question right it's what the
[20:07] Angel's asking right before zerubabel
[20:10] Thou shalt become a plain and he shall
[20:13] bring forth The Headstone Now The
[20:15] Headstone doesn't come down here right
[20:18] sure it's a message that is included but
[20:21] the headstone is up here there has to be
[20:24] a building built before The Headstone
[20:26] can come down on iten right so zerubabel
[20:30] helped us get all the way I say listen
[20:32] to me helped us get all the way to here
[20:35] and then his message will bring the
[20:38] headstone but it will only come through
[20:40] a group of people it will not come
[20:42] through one person anymore amen amen we
[20:45] are headstone people we are thus sayith
[20:47] the Lord
[20:50] people we are the people that the ends
[20:52] of the Earth has come upon we are the
[20:55] people that this examples of all the Old
[20:57] Testament has come to us today
[20:59] amen amen all we ought to be happy I was
[21:02] so happy when I was watching that and I
[21:04] thought Lord how many people really
[21:07] understood what she was going through
[21:10] how many people really understood why
[21:12] she didn't touch you she knew a little
[21:16] something but if I can just touch his
[21:19] just just His
[21:20] Garment just His Garment I believe God
[21:23] placed that in her heart but I believe
[21:26] you may have placed that in many
[21:27] people's heart and they don't do it
[21:30] cuz I believe God spoke to more people
[21:32] than just Abraham but he knew Abraham
[21:33] was the one that would respond cuz God
[21:35] not a respector a person that's why the
[21:37] brother R stood and preached to hundreds
[21:39] of thousands of people and this is all
[21:41] that's
[21:43] left hundreds of thousands of people and
[21:46] this is what's left right right it's me
[21:49] and you a small group brother BR said a
[21:52] small group out of a
[21:54] group I want to be that group out of a
[21:56] group cuz there's two spirit's working
[22:00] in the framework of the church one true
[22:02] one false right don't you think for one
[22:05] thing's for sure that the Antichrist is
[22:08] watching what we're doing oh yeah well
[22:11] we know who he is we know he's a devil
[22:12] but he's watching what we're doing he's
[22:14] imitating he
[22:16] cannot be the original amen you and I
[22:19] are the original that's why I said we're
[22:21] not a type that's it he's trying to type
[22:25] after us Satan's watching us right to
[22:29] see what we're going to do and then
[22:31] he'll make a
[22:33] move so we need to watch and wait be
[22:35] those five wise virgins yes that's who
[22:38] we are if you're bride you're one of
[22:40] you're one of the you're you're your
[22:42] your whole Christian experience is in
[22:45] those five wise virgins right lamp
[22:47] trimming time knowing when to get up
[22:49] knowing when to get oil being a
[22:52] virgin and when he calls you know his
[22:56] voice that's it there's a lot of people
[22:58] don't know his voice they know who he is
[23:01] they know he died on a cross and you
[23:03] know that I was thinking I was thinking
[23:06] last night too as a as a paradox if that
[23:09] poor guy that played Jesus ain't born
[23:14] again but you're not going to say that
[23:16] I'm not going to say that to a bunch of
[23:18] people but but it's important to be born
[23:20] again you can play Jesus all you want to
[23:24] you can play this one or that and the
[23:25] other and all you want to but God don't
[23:27] want that he wants to
[23:29] originality that's it but it is I'm I'm
[23:32] not saying it is really good to watch
[23:35] that cuz he does a super job of making
[23:38] Jesus human winking at people calling
[23:42] Lazarus Laz yeah like gu his Buddy L LZ
[23:46] how you doing buddy then they start
[23:47] playing ball together and of course
[23:49] there's a perfect one standing there and
[23:51] he can't even pick a ball up so that's
[23:54] the God we serve he's hiding in
[23:56] Simplicity right right
[23:59] he came down here to be imperfect so
[24:01] that you and I could be perfect right
[24:03] what a mighty God we
[24:05] serve so he's going to bring forth The
[24:07] Headstone he's going to bring something
[24:10] down that's never been brought before
[24:13] amen and it's here now it's not coming
[24:16] folks it's here now that's right amen
[24:18] that's why I said we're not looking for
[24:19] it the prophecy was made but we're
[24:22] standing in the prophecy right now
[24:24] that's right we've had a zerubabel that
[24:26] was swn in Babylon but came out he
[24:28] brought the headstone message the
[24:30] seals and he did it with his hands which
[24:33] hands means power and we talked about
[24:34] that plummet or we call it a plumb bob
[24:37] which is a leveling tool and what
[24:39] brother R had to do he had to level this
[24:41] thing up he had to level this the word
[24:43] of God didn't need leveling man needed
[24:47] leveling cuz man got
[24:49] unlevel but God sent us a
[24:52] tool right call William brandom to bring
[24:54] that thing right back to where we can
[24:56] say that ain't nothing but the just like
[24:59] hady Wright did right that's right amen
[25:02] you just got to start believing this
[25:04] message folks that God sent it to you he
[25:06] didn't send it to your neighbor he sent
[25:08] it to
[25:09] you and listen what are we going to do
[25:11] about
[25:14] it the Bible says go on to
[25:17] Perfection not being babies anymore that
[25:20] you have
[25:21] to feed them bottles
[25:24] and we got to grow
[25:26] up right we we' had a grownup
[25:30] message right somebody say Amen am we've
[25:33] had a grown up message so what are we
[25:35] doing about
[25:36] it so in Kings we read this Sunday I
[25:39] read it again it came to pass when
[25:42] midday was passed and they prophesied
[25:43] until the time of the offering of the
[25:45] evening sacrifice that there was neither
[25:47] voice nor answer nor any that regarded
[25:49] in other words they were bringing their
[25:52] doctrines to Mount Carmel and they were
[25:55] their Doctrine was going to bring their
[25:56] God
[25:58] right doesn't your Doctrine bring your
[26:01] God good or bad right or wrong your
[26:04] Doctrine is what your your God is your
[26:06] do your Doctrine when you say well I
[26:08] believe he's one of three that's your
[26:10] Doctrine right right well we know he's
[26:13] one true and living God yeah that's our
[26:15] Doctrine right and it's the real one
[26:19] it's not the false one it's the real one
[26:22] amen they prophesied until the time of
[26:24] the offering of the evening sacrifice so
[26:26] we know in the end time is when this
[26:28] happen happen we know these in types
[26:29] I'll go through it real quick so Elijah
[26:31] said unto the people come near unto me
[26:33] and all the people came near and he
[26:34] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[26:36] broken down he took all those stones
[26:38] which are Revelations and he put them
[26:41] right back in order and then he actually
[26:43] also put the sticks in order that's what
[26:46] he says he put the sticks in order the
[26:48] way they're supposed to he cut the
[26:50] sacrifice up the way it was supposed to
[26:52] laid it on the Altar and then that's
[26:54] when God came on the scene you and I
[26:57] have got to get this thing right we've
[26:58] got to get our rocks in place we got to
[27:02] get our Revelation in place we got to
[27:03] get our sticks in place you got to get
[27:06] your sacrifice where it's supposed to be
[27:07] too right
[27:09] ex and then God will do exactly what he
[27:13] did on Mount Carmel he'll come down and
[27:16] consume you amen right amen so let's
[27:20] read Second Kings I was thinking about
[27:21] this a few minutes ago I just added it
[27:23] in there this is Elijah and Elisha now
[27:26] remember Elisha type who Elisha Ted the
[27:28] bride right all right Elijah took his
[27:31] mantle now that mantle means Glory
[27:33] Splendor and magnificence it's also a
[27:36] Shaw but it had some power behind it
[27:39] right it had some anointing on
[27:42] it probably if you saw it you didn't
[27:44] think much of
[27:46] it but there was power behind it
[27:50] right he smoked the water and they were
[27:52] divided hither and thither so that the
[27:54] two went over on dry land
[27:58] now remember when those two went
[28:00] across let me tell you how this is when
[28:02] those two went across there was 50 sons
[28:05] of the Prophet standing on the bank with
[28:07] them read your Bible 50 sons of
[28:12] prophets which they had a hard time they
[28:14] had a they had some real bad Revelation
[28:16] cuz they was going to drink something or
[28:17] eat some porridge that was poison until
[28:20] what until Elijah showed up and throw
[28:22] something in the in the
[28:24] pot you need a prophet to make
[28:26] everything right you got to have a
[28:29] prophet you can't be a son of a
[28:31] prophet sure you can be but look how
[28:34] they got it wrong you need a prophet
[28:37] amen you need a prophet to tell you
[28:38] these things and we had a prophet to
[28:40] tell us these
[28:41] things Elijah said unto
[28:44] Elisha when they were gone over Elisha
[28:46] said to Elijah ask what I shall do for
[28:48] thee before I be taken from thee and
[28:50] Elisha said I pray thee let a double
[28:52] portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[28:55] remember he did eight Elijah did four
[28:58] we're doing signs and wonders all over
[29:01] the
[29:04] world all over the world
[29:07] Amen so brother brandom's message is not
[29:10] dry and it's it's still moving there's
[29:13] people still being healed that's right
[29:17] and he said thou H has ask a hard thing
[29:21] nevertheless if thou see me when I am
[29:24] taken from
[29:25] thee now we're getting into revelation
[29:28] here hang on a second it shall be so
[29:30] unto thee but if not in other words if
[29:33] you don't see me
[29:36] go you're not going to get a double
[29:38] portion right there's a lot of
[29:42] people hadn't seen him left
[29:45] yet or that he's coming
[29:49] back hello don't get
[29:52] quiet cuz Elijah said if Thou shalt see
[29:55] me when I'm taken away right
[29:59] it shall be so unto thee and it came to
[30:00] pass as they went on and talked that
[30:02] behold there appeared a chariot of fire
[30:04] horses of fire and part of them both a
[30:06] sun and Elijah went up by a whirlwind
[30:08] into heaven and Elisha saw it and he
[30:10] cried my father my father the chish of
[30:12] Israel and the horsemen thereof and he
[30:14] saw him no
[30:18] more they was no coming back of
[30:23] Elijah and he saw him no
[30:26] more he got out of Revelation Elijah
[30:29] wasn't coming back no more and that
[30:31] Revelation caused him to get a double
[30:34] portion amen hello somebody that's what
[30:37] he said and he took hold of his own
[30:39] clothes and rent them in two he took
[30:41] also the manle that Elijah fell from him
[30:44] and went back and stood by the bank of
[30:45] the Jordan now what was that manle it
[30:47] was an anointing right the bride has the
[30:50] same anointing Elijah's gone Elijah is
[30:52] not coming back until he comes back at
[30:55] the resurrection but he's not coming
[30:57] back to preach Elijah never preached
[30:59] another
[31:00] sermon once he's gone he's gone Moses
[31:04] thy servant is dead sometimes we need to
[31:06] cut things off and forget about the past
[31:08] we got to move forward God wants us to
[31:10] move
[31:12] forward he took up also the man of
[31:14] Elijah that fell and went back and stood
[31:16] by Jordan and he took the manle of
[31:17] Elijah that fell from him and smoked the
[31:19] waters and said where is the Lord God of
[31:25] Elijah and when he also smitten in the
[31:27] waters they part Ed hither and thither
[31:28] and Elijah went over he was not
[31:31] questioning where he
[31:35] was he was just saying wherever that God
[31:38] is he's right
[31:40] here where is the Lord God of
[31:43] Elijah and that's the same with me and
[31:45] you but you know what happened a little
[31:46] bit later on brother Bob I was reading
[31:48] the scripture a little bit further them
[31:49] 50
[31:50] prophets what' they say can we go look
[31:54] for
[31:54] him sounds like today don't it amen go
[31:58] thank you brother can can can we go look
[32:01] for him and Elisha said don't go and
[32:04] they said we think he might be over
[32:07] there on the mountain somewhere we think
[32:08] he might be back in the woods Elisha
[32:10] said go ahead they came back and they
[32:13] said we can't find him he said I told
[32:15] you I told you not to go that's right
[32:17] you wasted your time
[32:19] amen I know we don't at this church but
[32:22] there's a lot of people waste their time
[32:23] sitting around waiting for Brother Brown
[32:24] to come back amen I said waste their
[32:28] time
[32:30] right this message is too precious to
[32:34] sit on our rear end and not do anything
[32:37] and think we can wait for something to
[32:39] come amen that's not even scriptural
[32:42] never has been
[32:44] scriptural walk I just want Jesus to
[32:47] come back he's the one that saved me
[32:49] he's the one that healed me he's the one
[32:51] that revealed this message to me I want
[32:53] him to come back and he is here in his
[32:55] people but don't you want to see him one
[32:58] day don't you want to look at him that's
[33:00] what I was thinking about that woman
[33:01] sitting there that he had just healed
[33:03] she was looking now not literally but at
[33:05] one day that woman was looking literally
[33:08] in the face of Jesus right those people
[33:10] that walked with the real Jesus 2,000
[33:12] years ago they were looking right in the
[33:14] face of
[33:16] God and what they do with him they
[33:18] killed
[33:20] him they do the same to me and you who
[33:23] you think you
[33:25] are right and daughter of God that has a
[33:30] revelation that'll take us out of here
[33:34] that's what I contend to
[33:35] be Matthew 17:9 they came down from the
[33:39] mountain Jesus charged them saying tell
[33:40] the vision to no man until the son of
[33:42] man be risen again from the dead now I
[33:45] went back and looked and just to clear
[33:48] up something because I know Lis
[33:50] interpreted this for me one day at um
[33:54] brother Samuel racis church I preached
[33:56] on that
[33:58] the Bible original Bible the the diglot
[34:02] and the interpretation that he was
[34:04] reading out of his uh Spanish Bible it
[34:07] doesn't say
[34:09] again right so you had to tell the
[34:12] people you had to stop remember we had
[34:13] to tell the people that cuz they were
[34:14] all going where'd he get that
[34:16] from well I contend that that that
[34:20] whoever wrote this which we know it was
[34:21] describes it when King James said here
[34:24] you know they put two people in a room
[34:26] give them the same scripture and they
[34:27] came out with with all this together
[34:28] there had to be some kind of Revelation
[34:30] there for them to add that word
[34:32] again everybody with me they didn't just
[34:35] add
[34:36] that just because they wanted to add it
[34:39] there was something to that that I
[34:40] believe that the Holy Ghost said all
[34:42] right put this in just for an end time
[34:45] bride put this in just when somebody can
[34:48] look and say brother Ram stood one day
[34:50] and he said you've crucified the son of
[34:52] man you put him back on the cross and
[34:55] put him to an open shame you killed him
[34:58] again right right well there's that
[35:01] scripture until the son of man be risen
[35:03] again from what the dead denomination we
[35:06] were in the deadness we're still
[35:10] in so that's for
[35:15] us amen
[35:17] amen don't it make you happy that you
[35:20] can look in the Bible and see
[35:21] yourself amen and what's happening in
[35:24] your time right now right amen that's it
[35:28] one day it'll strike some of you that
[35:30] there's cold as a pickle in the winter
[35:33] time why do we keep saying pickles
[35:35] what's we keep picking on pickles let's
[35:37] don't pick on pickles that's what
[35:39] brother R said I
[35:42] know and it's yeah okay I'll use it and
[35:45] his disciples that you know that's just
[35:47] what we all go to you
[35:49] know useless as a bump on a pickle well
[35:53] there's bumps on a lot of things is
[35:55] useless just to wake you up for a minute
[35:57] minute look his disciples asked him said
[36:00] why then say the scribes that the must
[36:02] first come and we know for a fact see
[36:04] they were standing there in the in the
[36:07] coming of the third Elijah everybody
[36:08] with me John the Baptist they were
[36:10] standing in that anointing right cuz
[36:12] John had come he was already in prison
[36:14] or may already have been killed by this
[36:16] time so their their thought was not on
[36:19] our Elijah that came to
[36:22] us right come on we're disciples now
[36:25] that thought is on us now we we realize
[36:29] we know by the end time message the son
[36:31] of man has to rise again in the end time
[36:34] in a
[36:37] bride and it had to come through an
[36:39] Elijah
[36:42] anointing but they're asking this
[36:44] question in verse 10 according to
[36:46] Malachi 4 like I said before the Jews
[36:49] know Elijah has to show up before the
[36:52] coming of the Lord right they just
[36:55] missed the first coming they're going to
[36:57] get the coming through the two
[36:59] prophets
[37:00] right why then say the scribes that
[37:03] Elias must first come Jesus answered and
[37:05] said unto them Elias truly shall first
[37:08] come and restore all things we know one
[37:10] thing for sure that was not John the
[37:11] Baptist's
[37:14] job that was brother bram's job that was
[37:16] number Four's job to restore the hearts
[37:19] of the children back to the faith of the
[37:20] fathers to restore all these loose ends
[37:24] that we have had down through the time
[37:26] that's what that's what's bound God
[37:28] folks it's false Doctrine God can't work
[37:32] all the way in false
[37:38] Doctrine when they had showed that the
[37:41] movie last night when uh he walked into
[37:44] jer's house and those people were you
[37:47] know they were wailing and the guy was
[37:48] playing the flute and he said stop am
[37:52] and then remember he said well we're
[37:55] doing this because they're dead he said
[37:57] she's not dead she's just sleeping and
[37:59] they laughed at
[38:01] him they didn't laugh after a while but
[38:04] remember what he had to do brother Ry
[38:06] said he couldn't heal that girl till he
[38:07] got all that unbelief out of the house
[38:09] amen he took Peter James and
[38:12] John the mama and the daddy and that was
[38:14] it right and raised that girl up even
[38:17] Jesus in his Humanity even almighty God
[38:19] had to get the unbelief out of the house
[38:21] so he could heal that person
[38:24] amen see what unbelief will do for you
[38:27] yes see what unbelief will do for
[38:29] you it it'll let God can't work the way
[38:32] he wants
[38:33] to amen that's why we're called
[38:37] Believers we you know if when we first
[38:40] come in message I know a lot of you have
[38:41] been in it for a long time and we come
[38:43] in in the late 60s and a lot later you
[38:45] know some of y'all later on than that
[38:47] but wasn't it refreshing to know that
[38:50] you had
[38:51] something that you had read for years if
[38:54] you were a Christian if you were not if
[38:55] you just come from the world it was all
[38:57] fresh
[38:58] amen but you read the Bible way
[39:00] different now than you read it back then
[39:02] same words same
[39:05] version but you look at it and you go
[39:08] wow why didn't I see that
[39:10] before why didn't I see it that way
[39:12] before it's so plain what happened in
[39:15] the garden they ate an apricot or they
[39:17] ate an
[39:18] apple well ain't that what they always
[39:20] say I mean everybody they ain't hardly
[39:22] many people believe that that uh um
[39:26] somebody called me yesterday and asked
[39:28] me a question about the you know they
[39:29] dug up those bones of those crrom Magnum
[39:31] men they have these different eras right
[39:34] some of y'all that know what I'm talking
[39:35] about if you took science in school in
[39:38] that in different
[39:39] eras they had a man and he they're
[39:42] they're they're really saying Evol from
[39:44] a monkey cuz he walked down like this
[39:45] and had a real flat head they found
[39:48] listen they found the bone so the person
[39:49] had to be there right amen but somebody
[39:52] asked it why they look like that and we
[39:54] look like us now why they look like that
[39:57] because when they put all the when they
[39:59] put the U skin around them they do look
[40:03] kind of animalistic everybody with
[40:08] me
[40:10] Cain the
[40:12] Beast that was that
[40:14] line I'll promise you Abel didn't look
[40:17] like Cain and Cain didn't look like Adam
[40:21] come on somebody he look like an animal
[40:24] almost so that's and that tells you the
[40:27] whole story but but now but you go tell
[40:29] that to somebody and they're like what
[40:31] do you mean it was an apple well it was
[40:34] an apple that made them people look like
[40:36] that no it was a mystery that thank God
[40:39] you and I can look at those pictures and
[40:41] know that wasn't Evolution we didn't
[40:42] come from Monkey right but there was a
[40:46] beast now you can't you can't go away
[40:48] from there was a beast in between the
[40:51] monkey and the man right they look kind
[40:54] of this way and kind of this way right
[40:57] everybody with me right so there had to
[41:00] be a little bit of DNA coming out of
[41:01] here and over here to make it little
[41:05] like
[41:05] that to make it look like what they call
[41:08] cavemen look like the old cavemen well
[41:10] that's where it come from had to be at
[41:12] um had to be Cain's children had to be
[41:16] because the Beast was done away with so
[41:17] you can't put him in there but you got
[41:19] to have Cain and all his descendant with
[41:21] that DNA in it going down through time
[41:24] and developing and then they got mixed
[41:27] back and forth and everybody comes in
[41:28] like we're doing right now we all
[41:30] look maybe not so much like monkeys but
[41:33] we act like them sometimes yes well the
[41:36] praise the Lord there's a little history
[41:38] lesson
[41:41] science am
[41:43] history kids write that down but I say
[41:47] you don't do that and don't do it in
[41:48] school don't don't say that that there's
[41:50] a beast and the no don't do that no let
[41:53] your mom and daddy do if they need to
[41:56] but don't go around telling people that
[41:57] Eve had relations with the Beast and
[42:00] it's okay just just listen to what we're
[42:02] saying and you'll learn later
[42:04] on while we're in such shape right but I
[42:08] say to you that a lias has come already
[42:10] now Jesus is telling them he's come
[42:14] already now he ain't talking about
[42:16] number four now he's talking about
[42:17] number three right cuz there CU three is
[42:21] there and they know what happened to
[42:24] John they know what's happening to John
[42:25] they know that John's either in prison
[42:27] already had his cut head cut off cuz he
[42:29] said but they have done unto him
[42:30] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[42:32] also the son of man suffer of them then
[42:35] the disciples understood that he sping
[42:36] to them with John the Baptist we can see
[42:39] that but we also see that our Elijah is
[42:40] in there
[42:42] too cuz he restored all things brother
[42:44] random that that gift that he had sure
[42:47] it's like we were talking about it was a
[42:48] minor but it brought the people tried to
[42:50] get them to a major right all right cuz
[42:54] we don't major on
[42:55] gifts we on the word of God being
[42:58] correct amen amen not the word of God
[43:01] being correct what we see of the word of
[43:03] God being correct the word of God's
[43:05] always been correct there's never been a
[43:07] time when the word of God was
[43:09] incorrect man has made it incorrect by
[43:12] their what Jesus even stood there said
[43:14] by your Traditions you've made the word
[43:15] of God of none effect and he was talking
[43:17] about the Old Testament they had even
[43:19] started writing the New Testament yet
[43:22] right right so remember this messenger
[43:24] of Malachi 4 we got to split it apart
[43:27] cuz one thing he's going to do he did it
[43:30] in the early part of his ministry and
[43:32] the second part he did in the later part
[43:34] of his ministry according to Malachi 4
[43:36] he will turn the hearts of the children
[43:38] to the fathers two he will reveal the
[43:40] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[43:41] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[43:44] contained in the Seven Seals it will be
[43:46] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[43:48] now listen you have got to be a student
[43:51] of divine revelation amen
[43:55] amen you got
[43:58] be it's a requirement amen that we be
[44:02] college students
[44:03] now not Elementry kids amen amen it's
[44:07] and it's required to understand these
[44:09] things right but if this if you have a
[44:12] problem with what we're fixing to get
[44:14] into which is going to be the the I
[44:16] don't say deep it's not deep but the
[44:18] mysteries of God are deep to people that
[44:20] ain't been digging in them amen right
[44:22] right exactly one more time the
[44:26] mysteries of God are Mysteries until you
[44:28] dig into
[44:30] them okay the hidden revealed truth is
[44:33] something you got to work on something
[44:35] I've got to work on something I got to
[44:37] study and you got to study it will be
[44:40] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[44:43] that literally turn the hearts of the
[44:45] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[44:47] exactly
[44:48] so but consider this this Prophet
[44:51] Messenger will be in the nature and
[44:52] manner of Elijah so we know that and
[44:54] John the people of this prophet
[44:57] Messengers day now watch the people now
[45:00] who is the people me and you right the
[45:03] people of this Prophet Messengers day
[45:05] will be as they were in ahab's day and
[45:07] in John's and since it is only the
[45:10] children whose Hearts will be turned it
[45:12] is only the children who will listen
[45:17] right and we were all when we heard this
[45:19] message and accepted this message we
[45:21] were all children right cuz every idea
[45:25] you had was wrong
[45:27] every idea every denomination you came
[45:29] up
[45:30] in you had to kick all that
[45:36] out first
[45:38] Thessalonians I love this scripture
[45:40] because there's three things happen and
[45:43] it's right here it's right here right
[45:46] it's not coming so see again the
[45:49] denomination of the world and I say the
[45:50] denomination the world the people that
[45:52] don't follow this
[45:53] message a shout to them is just oh we
[45:56] got some God's coming you know the Lord
[45:58] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[46:00] shout all right here comes a physical
[46:02] Lord as I told you before that guy told
[46:04] me one time said I'll just be so glad
[46:06] when the Eastern Sky splits and Jesus
[46:09] Walks down out of the clouds I said well
[46:11] if you do I said you missed the Rapture
[46:13] and that about blowed his mind because
[46:15] he knew what a Rapture was he said what
[46:18] do you mean I said that's God coming as
[46:20] judgment that's God where every eye will
[46:22] see him I said the Bible tells me he'll
[46:24] come as a thief in the night right that
[46:27] only a certain group of people will know
[46:28] who it is it won't be a public show it
[46:30] won't be him where everybody the whole
[46:31] world there will be a time but it'll be
[46:34] in judgment it will be he won't come
[46:35] down here as Savior right right now he's
[46:38] here as Savior he's descended in a
[46:41] message that is a prophetic message that
[46:44] will save you heal you and take you in a
[46:46] Rapture right
[46:50] true the voice of the
[46:52] Archangel and the Trump of God and the
[46:56] dead in Christ shall rise first then we
[46:59] which are alive and remain shall be
[47:00] caught up together with them in the
[47:01] clouds to meet the Lord in the air folks
[47:04] there's a day that's going to
[47:06] happen it ain't far
[47:09] off I know the Bible says that and see
[47:13] the Bible even tells you that there's
[47:14] people that says oh well that that's
[47:16] been told since the dawn of time you
[47:19] know granny said the Lord was coming
[47:22] great grandma said to the Lord be ready
[47:24] the Lord's coming brother random said it
[47:27] could be any day now and that's been 60
[47:28] 70 years ago but there's going to be a
[47:31] day it's going to happen right and if
[47:34] you're a foolish virgin you're not going
[47:36] to hear it you're going to hear it but
[47:37] you can't go to it because there's
[47:39] nothing you could do about it right cuz

[50:41] brothers standing here that preaches a
[50:42] word of God even if we don't say
[50:44] anything that you understand but just a
[50:47] few words right it's a shout it's a
[50:50] shout to turn our attention when we
[50:53] first got saved when we first got saved
[50:56] and we we were saying a
[50:58] denomination come on guys we just didn't
[51:02] there's something about that you didn't
[51:03] want to stay

[51:06] knew there was something like brother R
[51:08] said that little seed well I know you
[51:09] know what it was it was a word of God
[51:11] calling your name from somewhere
[51:13] else oh I just got
[51:16] that I just got that while you were
[51:19] doing whatever you were doing there was
[51:20] this word being called somewhere right

[55:00] in the scripture we see it living right
[55:03] there amen that was in
[55:08] 1965 what about today now watch brother
[55:11] random he gets real specific here like I
[55:13] said last Sunday this is just a few days
[55:17] 20 days before he died he's coming down
[55:20] the end of his message he's just like
[55:22] Jesus Jesus told him a lot of many times
[55:24] he said don't worship me worship the
[55:25] father
[55:26] I'm not your master this worship God but
[55:31] when they come to that night of that uh
[55:33] communion he said you
[55:35] say I'm your master and Lord and you say
[55:39] well for so I am he was honing it down
[55:44] Amen to say yes I'm he and I'm not going

[55:58] to the people sitting there the
[56:00] Pentecostal praying for the sick it was
[56:03] fine but when I come with a
[56:05] message if any message Goes Forth it's a
[56:08] true message if it's the true genuine
[56:10] miracles of god and hangs right in that
[56:12] or now watch if it's the true genuine
[56:16] miracles of god and hangs in that
[56:18] organization you know it's not of
[56:21] God right cuz that thing's already
[56:25] declared in other words that thing's
[56:26] already been declared to be
[56:28] dead what he's telling
[56:30] them Jesus went forth and healed the
[56:33] sick in order to catch their eyes to
[56:35] people then his message it has to have
[56:38] something that God is going to

[59:01] bridegroom call B bridegroom call all
[59:04] right and at midnight there was a cry
[59:06] behold the bridegroom cometh go you out
[59:08] and meet him all the virgins arose and
[59:10] they trimmed their
[59:11] lamps right what are foolish virgins
[59:15] they're Sanctified
[59:16] Believers come
[59:18] on it's not Devils they're Sanctified
[59:22] Believers now they stopped in their
[59:24] Journey they didn't get any oil they
[59:26] didn't get the Holy Ghost they were told
[59:28] that just believe the message and press
[59:30] play
[59:32] anyway
[59:35] goe and then the foolish at least they
[59:38] weren't so foolish to not know where to
[59:41] go get it brother Bob they go to the
[59:43] ones that got it right amen give us your
[59:46] teaching we haven't been taught that
[59:49] we've been taught
[59:52] different come on don't get quiet that's
[59:54] exactly what's GNA happen
[59:56] those foolish virgin are foolish virgins
[59:59] that's going to be given eternal life
[1:00:02] right they're foolish but they're
[1:00:04] virgins they're trying they're trying
[1:00:06] all they can hear from a pull pit right
[1:00:09] but if a pull pit can't preach it
[1:00:12] they're not going to get it
[1:00:15] right foolish said unto wise give us
[1:00:17] your oil for our lamps are gone out but
[1:00:21] to wise answer and said not so L there
[1:00:24] be enough for us and you but but go you
[1:00:26] rather to them that sell and buy for
[1:00:28] yourself and while they went to buy the
[1:00:30] bridegroom
[1:00:31] came the door was shut
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:37] right we better know where we are
[1:00:42] amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday day
[1:00:44] and forever he's identifying himself as
[1:00:47] he promised much more we could say this
[1:00:49] is
[1:00:51] 1964 in these last days as son of man
[1:00:54] making himself known among his people
[1:00:56] in the form of his people not one person
[1:01:00] in his
[1:01:01] people
[1:01:03] right there is no son of man Ministry
[1:01:06] without people right now when the first
[1:01:10] son of man was on Earth he was the son
[1:01:12] of man right ordained to come the way he
[1:01:17] came everybody with me there was no
[1:01:19] other son of man manifestation nowhere
[1:01:22] he was it that's right that's why he was
[1:01:24] a headstone the son of man was The
[1:01:26] Headstone to the church but what did
[1:01:28] they do they rejected him he had to go
[1:01:31] away come back as the Holy Ghost
[1:01:33] everybody with me come back in the form
[1:01:36] of the Holy Ghost in the people but
[1:01:38] promised in the end time to come back
[1:01:40] again and do the same thing but in a
[1:01:42] many membered body not just one person
[1:01:45] right amen right brother Brandon was not
[1:01:47] the son of
[1:01:49] man he was a son of man revealing the
[1:01:53] son of man we he said that himself amen
[1:01:56] so he comes in the form of his people
[1:01:59] not Son of God now watch not Son of God
[1:02:02] so what does a prophet do he's turning a
[1:02:04] corner he's bringing us from the church
[1:02:07] ages he's transitioning us to the
[1:02:10] perfection in this
[1:02:11] age
[1:02:13] right not Son of God not son of David
[1:02:18] but son of man the Son of God was the
[1:02:21] supernatural like Abraham he seen voices
[1:02:23] heard things seen lights but just before
[1:02:26] the promised son come what did God do he
[1:02:28] showed
[1:02:29] up at Adam's tent I mean Abraham's tent
[1:02:33] a man in human flesh read the thoughts
[1:02:35] that was in Sarah's heart in the room
[1:02:37] behind him he said as it was in the days
[1:02:40] of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:02:42] the Son of God coming when the son of
[1:02:43] man shall be being revealed the son of
[1:02:47] man being revealed not the Son of God in
[1:02:50] the church
[1:02:51] age everybody with me this is different
[1:02:54] I I was looking at my church Church age
[1:02:56] book is
[1:03:00] closed it was open during this whole
[1:03:03] time we were talking about the church
[1:03:04] ages right I'm trying to make a point
[1:03:07] here right right it's closed now cuz
[1:03:11] there's nothing in that book I I don't
[1:03:13] say listen don't get me wrong brother
[1:03:15] Brown talked about the church ages 1 2 3
[1:03:18] 4 5 6 7 but now you and I are the people
[1:03:21] that's living that all those other ages
[1:03:23] are dead people are already gone
[1:03:26] churches are already gone uh ministers
[1:03:28] are already gone everybody with
[1:03:32] me we are at the end of the book right
[1:03:36] listen don't ever believe that I don't
[1:03:38] we don't need a church AE book no more
[1:03:39] you better read that thing like that one
[1:03:41] with the cover off of it but what I'm
[1:03:43] saying is I don't have to go back and
[1:03:46] say well let's look at the history of
[1:03:48] brother randam no we lived it sister C
[1:03:50] actually lived it brother George Canada
[1:03:53] brother Mike Canada different they
[1:03:55] actually lived lived it saw the
[1:03:57] manifestation saw what was
[1:04:00] happening and thank God we have him
[1:04:02] still here with
[1:04:04] us but it's not the Son of God in the
[1:04:07] church age now do we believe brother R
[1:04:09] was a prophet or
[1:04:10] not when we going to make the when are
[1:04:12] we going to make that transition we got
[1:04:14] to step up
[1:04:16] right
[1:04:18] right can't do away with the Son of
[1:04:21] God but there's a manifestation of the
[1:04:23] son of man that's going to be it listen
[1:04:26] Martin Luther had the Holy
[1:04:29] Ghost right John Wesley had the Holy
[1:04:32] Ghost
[1:04:33] amen but they didn't have all the word
[1:04:37] they were
[1:04:37] reformers they still were trinitarians
[1:04:40] God can't anoint a trinitarian
[1:04:43] Doctrine brother Brown said it come from
[1:04:45] the pits of hell so God can't anoint
[1:04:47] that but what about a prophet in the end
[1:04:49] time though he's brought us to a place
[1:04:50] that he stood one day and he said that
[1:04:52] come from the pits of hell you don't
[1:04:54] need to there's not a father son holy
[1:04:55] ghost there's not a Trinity there's not
[1:04:57] three
[1:04:58] Gods right there's one God
[1:05:02] Amen yes sir that was his whole
[1:05:05] messag and as I think brother Bob the
[1:05:07] other day we were talking about up here
[1:05:09] that first seal shows you that there's
[1:05:12] only one God Amen when that book opened
[1:05:16] to reveal the mystery the Myster was
[1:05:20] here stands a lamb with a book in his
[1:05:22] hand and there goes two people of the
[1:05:24] Trinity no that's what he
[1:05:26] said he said if you have two he said
[1:05:30] therefore one's got to be God and one's
[1:05:33] got to be the devil right that's the
[1:05:35] mystery of
[1:05:36] iniquity he taught them right now if
[1:05:39] they didn't believe it it's on them amen
[1:05:43] the message to us folks you say oh that
[1:05:45] was them over there they didn't know
[1:05:46] nothing let me tell you something if you
[1:05:48] do the same thing here that's why
[1:05:50] iniquity shall
[1:05:52] abound knowing to do better and don't
[1:05:55] don't do it we've had the full seven
[1:05:58] course meal right we know how listen we
[1:06:01] know how to be
[1:06:03] Christian right we know we know what to
[1:06:07] do by
[1:06:08] letter but do we do it by
[1:06:15] life not the Son of God in the church
[1:06:17] age he's put out of
[1:06:20] that now he son of man revealing himself
[1:06:23] the word is becoming flesh Among
[1:06:28] Us I contend that this year you're going
[1:06:31] to see a difference in the bride right I
[1:06:33] didn't say Church you're going to see a
[1:06:35] difference in this year coming up this
[1:06:37] will be
[1:06:38] 2025 there'll be a difference in the
[1:06:42] bride the bride but now remember the
[1:06:45] bride will never be
[1:06:48] bad ever right you said oh we'll lose
[1:06:52] members and we'll lose if we lose
[1:06:54] members it's just
[1:06:56] members well I'm going to preach anyway
[1:06:59] it's just
[1:07:00] members I said
[1:07:02] bride bride will never leave this
[1:07:05] message bride will never walk away from
[1:07:08] this message ever walk away from
[1:07:11] it that's
[1:07:13] right so the Mysteries will be revealed
[1:07:15] in the last day when the Seven Angels
[1:07:18] Church message comes not when he starts
[1:07:21] out doing this what healing campaign
[1:07:24] when he begins to sound his message not
[1:07:26] in the years of
[1:07:28] preparation listen that was the years of
[1:07:31] they needed the years of preparation
[1:07:33] even we did when we first come in the
[1:07:35] message what they do well some of you I
[1:07:38] know you did they they handed you what a
[1:07:40] church a book or a seal book your daddy
[1:07:41] did right is that all right seal book
[1:07:44] all right well it's like Daddy said you
[1:07:47] need to lay that aside and get the
[1:07:48] church a book seal book May choke you
[1:07:52] okay well it did but it handed you a
[1:07:54] church age book
[1:07:57] and when you read that church age
[1:07:59] book that was okay but when you got to
[1:08:03] listen to the
[1:08:05] tapes don't tell me you didn't you were
[1:08:08] enamored with that
[1:08:11] manifestation of the son of man at the
[1:08:15] end of the message when he stood there
[1:08:18] and told him the thoughts and intents of
[1:08:20] the heart don't most of you are shaking
[1:08:22] your head yes amen now I you you listen
[1:08:25] to the tape no doubt but you wanted to
[1:08:29] listen to that when you got to that that
[1:08:31] just that was that AED you he should
[1:08:35] have but remember that's a minor that's
[1:08:39] supposed to get your attention to when
[1:08:41] you listen to the next tape you don't
[1:08:43] wait till the end because listen if he
[1:08:45] calls out suie and her her car color and
[1:08:48] her house number that ain't going to
[1:08:50] save your
[1:08:52] soul it really didn't save Susie Soul
[1:08:54] either it was a Healing
[1:08:57] Ministry that healed
[1:09:00] prostitutes as well as Christians right
[1:09:04] so it's not in years of preparation
[1:09:06] that's not what we're looking at
[1:09:09] now
[1:09:11] right not the years in preparation but
[1:09:14] when he begins to sound the message
[1:09:17] these Mysteries will be revealed and
[1:09:20] here they are listen to a prophet and
[1:09:23] here they are not knowing them and you
[1:09:25] people are witness of
[1:09:28] that oh how about that I'm going to tell
[1:09:31] you you people are witness of that too
[1:09:34] what you going to do with it you sit
[1:09:37] there and sleep your life away or what
[1:09:39] right something's got to spark in
[1:09:42] here right are you're just going like
[1:09:44] you are that's just you so to watch what
[1:09:47] brother BR said now look this is Endtime
[1:09:49] seed sign but we're going to get in
[1:09:50] spoken words rid seed real quick then
[1:09:52] we'll close the word has been sown
[1:09:56] all right denominations will reap
[1:09:59] denomination that makes them Confederate
[1:10:01] themselves
[1:10:03] together amen exactly you watch this
[1:10:07] coming up year and the next year if we
[1:10:10] make it there's going to be a church and
[1:10:13] state come
[1:10:14] together yeah
[1:10:17] right I think we just elected a
[1:10:24] Constantine we may get
[1:10:29] cut cuz that's what he's been wanting to
[1:10:31] do bring church and state together well
[1:10:33] listen when when Constantine brought
[1:10:35] church and state together who got
[1:10:37] persecuted
[1:10:38] Christians one more time CHR Christians
[1:10:42] real true Christians are the one that
[1:10:44] got
[1:10:45] persecuted not all Brides bride them
[1:10:47] people that were that were praying for
[1:10:49] him that's okay that's fine that's all
[1:10:51] right but if they ain't bride that
[1:10:54] didn't do them no good
[1:10:56] it just brought them there their
[1:10:58] Constantine to make them act that way I
[1:11:01] just I that's just the way I feel right
[1:11:04] cuz there's nothing good going to come
[1:11:05] out of any of this except me and you
[1:11:08] being driven closer to God and to be
[1:11:12] driven closer to God we got to be driven
[1:11:14] out of the
[1:11:15] world that's where our persecution going
[1:11:17] to come from it's going to come from the
[1:11:18] religious World Sinners don't bother
[1:11:22] us who bothers you more than anything
[1:11:26] a religious person your own family I
[1:11:29] think I'll
[1:11:32] preach but the word of God has been sown
[1:11:37] also that's right well it's time to be
[1:11:40] plain I mean we've got to be different
[1:11:43] amen something inside of us has got to
[1:11:45] be different than the world
[1:11:49] am but the word of God has been swed
[1:11:52] also and when the spirit of God begins
[1:11:55] to
[1:11:55] fall watch when the spirit of God begins
[1:11:59] to fall the word of God will live in the
[1:12:04] people that's
[1:12:05] right
[1:12:07] amen so I pray the spirit of God Begin
[1:12:10] to Fall Hallelujah
[1:12:15] right and that false bride that's
[1:12:17] committed adultery out there and brought
[1:12:19] herself into Creeds and sold out her
[1:12:21] Birthright will reap what
[1:12:25] a
[1:12:26] Constantine a confederation of church
[1:12:29] that's to be bound and burn like the
[1:12:31] thorns and thistles but where the word
[1:12:33] of God's been sewed into the people's
[1:12:35] heart it will reap a bride for Christ as
[1:12:38] certain as I'm standing here in time
[1:12:42] signs B word's Original
[1:12:45] Seed the seed's been planted there's a
[1:12:48] planting time and a harvest time now
[1:12:51] there's been three different kinds of
[1:12:52] seeds planted a denominational bu Graham
[1:12:56] he was the head
[1:12:57] planter Oral Roberts for the
[1:13:00] Pentecostals Pentecostal seed has been
[1:13:03] planted I'm talking about organization
[1:13:06] now and when the word and then the word
[1:13:09] has been planted in other words or
[1:13:11] robberts Billy Graham and his message
[1:13:13] right right that's right and then the
[1:13:16] word has been planted now you'll have to
[1:13:18] understand folks I ain't saying this no
[1:13:20] more unless God tells me I want you to
[1:13:22] get this good and clear three seeds has
[1:13:25] been planted that's the reason the
[1:13:27] planting it's about
[1:13:30] over that was
[1:13:33] 1962 seeds must be planted before the
[1:13:37] rainfalls amen or otherwise the
[1:13:42] spirit now you're going to disagree
[1:13:44] there but hold on just a minute seeds
[1:13:46] must be planted and then the rain falls
[1:13:48] to water the seed now we're heing so
[1:13:51] much and so many organizations and
[1:13:52] everything else talking about we're in
[1:13:54] the latter rain
[1:13:57] nonsense you and I are in the latter
[1:13:59] rain right they were not they were
[1:14:03] getting their teaching rain thinking
[1:14:05] that it was their Harvest
[1:14:08] rain that's how deceived they were now
[1:14:10] listen God didn't deceive him the devil
[1:14:12] did that's right nonsense no such a
[1:14:17] thing SE have been planted let's
[1:14:20] continue on just a second I believe that
[1:14:22] the word of God has been planted
[1:14:24] unadulterated
[1:14:25] away from any of those
[1:14:27] organizations that's what's the matter
[1:14:30] what in other words just
[1:14:32] separating the seed plant must have seed
[1:14:35] work water before it can grow it must
[1:14:38] have water and you see that water is
[1:14:43] capitalized that's
[1:14:45] right before the seed has been planted
[1:14:47] can grow they said a million more in
[1:14:50] 44 the teaching Reign went forth Billy
[1:14:53] Graham struck the world Pentecostal
[1:14:55] the word is struck the world now what's
[1:14:57] the matter now she's now waiting for the
[1:15:00] latter rain but remember the latter rain
[1:15:03] is the Harvest rain right amen the
[1:15:05] latter rain Harvest
[1:15:08] mature plants mature seed right there
[1:15:12] was no mature seed back then to take a
[1:15:14] Rapture the mature seed is here now we
[1:15:18] got to start showing it
[1:15:20] folks it's here what I'm saying we
[1:15:23] preached all this all our life this
[1:15:24] thing
[1:15:26] here the actors are on the stage
[1:15:28] everything's
[1:15:32] ready that's when she produces her
[1:15:35] fruit that's what I said as it gets
[1:15:38] harder and harder and harder people are
[1:15:41] going to fall away and fall away and
[1:15:43] fall away right
[1:15:46] amen then the kind of seed you planted
[1:15:48] in your field will be the crop that you
[1:15:52] you will reap
[1:15:56] amen so now brother brandom goes through
[1:15:59] all this spoken words Original Seed six
[1:16:03] hours everybody with me six
[1:16:06] hours 3 in the morning took a break 3 in
[1:16:10] the
[1:16:11] afternoon
[1:16:13] right that's it that's an
[1:16:19] idea three
[1:16:21] hours
[1:16:23] okay but but I look this is 1962 here's
[1:16:27] my point look I made that big I already
[1:16:28] showed you this one time show you again
[1:16:31] this was
[1:16:32] 1962 brother randam had preached Daniel
[1:16:35] 70 weeks he had preached the church
[1:16:38] ages he had preached on the seals but he
[1:16:41] preached them all in one sermon you've
[1:16:42] heard this before if you've been here
[1:16:43] long enough brother Dell told us this a
[1:16:46] long time ago all these different things
[1:16:48] have been preached that brother randam
[1:16:50] thought well I've got
[1:16:52] them this is my message I'm done
[1:16:56] right there's nothing else to
[1:16:59] do this is when right here paragraph 430
[1:17:03] right before that brother rown said the
[1:17:04] Holy Ghost told me to pick up my pen and
[1:17:08] write this right
[1:17:10] here so we can believe it or not but
[1:17:12] this comes straight from
[1:17:14] God God has promised be careful God has
[1:17:17] promised Malachi 4 for this last day and
[1:17:19] Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled I
[1:17:23] bet that was a shocker to him when he
[1:17:25] started writing that
[1:17:27] down but it must be
[1:17:31] fulfilled for it is a germatize word of
[1:17:33] God spoken through Malachi the prophet
[1:17:36] Jesus referred to it it's just before
[1:17:38] the coming of Christ the second time
[1:17:40] listen close now all scripture that has
[1:17:42] been that has not been fulfilled must be
[1:17:45] before that time the Bible is to be
[1:17:48] finished the Gentile dispensation is to
[1:17:51] be finished with the church age when
[1:17:53] this anointed mage messenger arrives of
[1:17:56] course he will plant the seed of the
[1:17:58] entire Bible from from the serpent to
[1:18:01] the messenger in the former Reign he's
[1:18:03] identifying who he is without telling
[1:18:05] him it's
[1:18:07] him then he will be rejected by the
[1:18:10] denominational people as his forefather
[1:18:14] John and Elijah as was spoken by our
[1:18:16] Lord 1962 he was still
[1:18:19] accepted 1962 he could go and preach
[1:18:22] just about anywhere he wanted to but
[1:18:24] when he come to spoken word Original
[1:18:25] Seed then he started preaching um the
[1:18:28] seals then he got on the marriage and
[1:18:29] divorce then he got on to uh why am I
[1:18:32] against organized religion and really
[1:18:35] bringing out the serpent seed yeah they
[1:18:37] started cutting him off amen you know
[1:18:41] why they weren't right seed right for
[1:18:44] the right time that's right right all
[1:18:46] right one last thing I'm going to skip
[1:18:48] all the way through this we'll get to
[1:18:50] this a little bit later but I want to
[1:18:51] bring you this last thing don't get sick
[1:18:53] watching this
[1:18:56] we know it's the son of man
[1:18:59] Ministry and we are in the days of the
[1:19:01] voice we know that right all
[1:19:04] right so I don't have to read that
[1:19:09] again now
[1:19:11] watch brother BR was preaching on the on
[1:19:14] the um this is a church age book all
[1:19:19] right when the Methodist failed God
[1:19:21] raised up others and so it has gone on
[1:19:23] through the years until in this last day
[1:19:26] there's again another people in the
[1:19:30] land do we believe brother rown was a
[1:19:32] prophet we believe he's prophesying he's
[1:19:34] seeing something
[1:19:35] come who under their Messenger will be
[1:19:38] the final voice to the final age now
[1:19:41] remember when he's standing there
[1:19:43] preaching
[1:19:44] this and and when they redid the church
[1:19:46] age book it was right about time of the
[1:19:47] seal so it 63 when they put it all
[1:19:50] together this is a compilation this is
[1:19:51] your church age book this is not the
[1:19:53] individual message
[1:19:55] right yes sir the church is no longer
[1:19:59] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[1:20:01] of God in other words Catholics are not
[1:20:04] the mouthpiece of
[1:20:07] God it has its own
[1:20:10] mouthpiece so God is turning on her he
[1:20:13] will confound her through the prophet
[1:20:16] and the
[1:20:19] bride one more time he will confound her
[1:20:22] through the prophet and the bride for
[1:20:25] the voice of God will be in her amen
[1:20:32] amen now watch in the last chapter of
[1:20:34] Revelations verse 17 the spirit and the
[1:20:39] bride the spirit and the bride says
[1:20:43] come it's the same
[1:20:46] amen the spirit's in the bride then we
[1:20:48] only got one
[1:20:50] Voice once more the world will hear
[1:20:53] direct from God as at Pentecost but of
[1:20:56] course that word bride will be
[1:20:58] repudiated as in the first age
[1:21:04] amen all right let me give you something
[1:21:06] right here and then we're going to close
[1:21:07] musicians get ready to
[1:21:09] come we'll read this later on next week
[1:21:12] sometime but I want to get down to this
[1:21:14] last part I want to get down to thus
[1:21:16] sayth the Lord all right everybody with
[1:21:18] me shake yourself for a minute just two
[1:21:21] more minutes let me read this this is
[1:21:23] 1963 you've heard me quote it you've
[1:21:25] heard brother Dale quotee it many times
[1:21:27] I'm going to read it to you in
[1:21:31] 1963 on questions and answers on the
[1:21:33] seals
[1:21:34] now that was on
[1:21:37] Sunday he started preaching the seals
[1:21:39] the first seal he preached on Monday
[1:21:42] everybody with me amen one 2 3 4 five
[1:21:48] Saturday he preached The Sixth
[1:21:51] Seal and he had questions and answers
[1:21:54] Sunday morning and then preach the
[1:21:56] seventh seal Sunday night all right so
[1:22:00] are we there we're sitting in we're
[1:22:01] sitting there watching him all right
[1:22:02] we're we're in the room with him right
[1:22:05] right all right and then also knowing
[1:22:08] that right among you things are
[1:22:10] happening see that I'm just I know you
[1:22:15] that you don't see
[1:22:18] it I'm just positive that you don't see
[1:22:23] it
[1:22:25] do we still believe brother brownan was
[1:22:26] a
[1:22:27] prophet he's
[1:22:29] prophesying because remember I'm fixing
[1:22:32] to read it to you he said it's thus
[1:22:33] sayith the
[1:22:34] Lord right it's right here I I hit it
[1:22:37] for a minute now I got to it right here
[1:22:39] I'll just I'm just positive you don't
[1:22:41] see it you say brother rown that's a
[1:22:42] hard thing for you to say that I know it
[1:22:45] is but look let me just say this now I
[1:22:48] suppose this is just on tape for oursel
[1:22:50] I'm glad it wasn't it was for oursel and
[1:22:53] so forth but let me say this
[1:22:55] you you don't get it now he this is the
[1:22:57] second time he's told him this and
[1:22:59] you're not supposed to get it
[1:23:03] amen right
[1:23:05] amen can you imagine a prophet standing
[1:23:08] there knowing that that whole group of
[1:23:09] people ever how many hundreds of people
[1:23:11] in that in that church at the Tabernacle
[1:23:13] that morning standing around the walls
[1:23:15] been listening all week praising the
[1:23:19] Lord he said you ain't getting it and
[1:23:22] you're not even supposed to get it right
[1:23:25] all right so don't try to interpret
[1:23:27] anything don't try to put your
[1:23:29] interpretation to it well we've seen
[1:23:31] that before that they have you only get
[1:23:33] further away just take my advice if you
[1:23:37] believe me now if God has given me favor
[1:23:41] in your sight and you know that them
[1:23:43] Revelations and things I've been here
[1:23:45] with you a long
[1:23:46] time and it's been right and now to
[1:23:50] double prove it right it hooks right in
[1:23:52] with the word see so you know it's thus
[1:23:55] saith the Lord so what he's saying is
[1:23:58] thus sayith the Lord that's exactly it's
[1:24:01] proved to you all right that's right now
[1:24:05] I'm not saying that it's the grace of
[1:24:07] God that lets me know what it is it's
[1:24:11] something that's tremendous and it's
[1:24:13] gone right now and there's not a way in
[1:24:15] the world for you to see it amen he's
[1:24:19] fixing the preach the seven seal
[1:24:24] but so help me with this Bible in my
[1:24:26] hand I know what it is so do I we
[1:24:30] weren't there right
[1:24:33] right and so but if the church you're
[1:24:35] not supposed to know these things
[1:24:40] wow so don't put no interpretation to
[1:24:42] anything see you just go ahead and
[1:24:44] remember what you're
[1:24:46] told live a Christian Life go to your
[1:24:50] church be a real light wherever you are
[1:24:53] and just burn for Christ and tell the
[1:24:55] people how you love him and just let
[1:24:57] your testimony be with love all the time
[1:24:59] with the people see cuz if you don't
[1:25:02] you'll twist yourself out into something
[1:25:03] there and you're off the Beaten Track
[1:25:06] right so really it's not for them to
[1:25:08] understand and if they tried to
[1:25:10] understand it they're going to mess it
[1:25:11] up and they did
[1:25:14] amen don't try to make no interpretation
[1:25:17] especially tonight now watch tonight is
[1:25:20] what the seventh seal especially tonight
[1:25:24] when that seal becomes in front of you
[1:25:26] see just don't try to interpret it you
[1:25:28] just go ahead and be humble go right on
[1:25:31] with the same plain message now you say
[1:25:34] brother Brown being the Church of God
[1:25:36] shouldn't we well as I was trying look
[1:25:38] here and I see he he picked up their
[1:25:40] thought somebody saying well we're
[1:25:41] sitting here we've been here all week we
[1:25:44] surely were picking up
[1:25:46] something right why said well now
[1:25:48] brother around the church of living God
[1:25:49] shouldn't we he stops he said well as I
[1:25:52] was trying look here I want to say
[1:25:54] why can't I in other words why brother
[1:25:56] BR why can't I understand
[1:25:59] this right no no don't you remember I'm
[1:26:03] saying this for your good I'm saying it
[1:26:06] so that you'll understand if you believe
[1:26:08] me now listen to what I tell you see see
[1:26:11] now here's a post we'll call that a
[1:26:14] listening post and in it got radio
[1:26:18] there's warnings and things can be done
[1:26:20] like sword in your hand see I can pick
[1:26:22] from the evil are pick from only as it
[1:26:26] gets its message see remember it's just
[1:26:29] a receptor there has to be something
[1:26:32] speaking to it and it don't interpret it
[1:26:34] just tells exactly what it said right
[1:26:37] but now for instant to the ordinary man
[1:26:39] there's been so many Cults and clans
[1:26:41] rise up over little outpourings of the
[1:26:42] spirit until people get all worked up in
[1:26:44] a bunch of stuff go out and start
[1:26:46] another move and you know things we've
[1:26:48] seen it happen so you don't want to do
[1:26:50] that now now just just stay the Way You
[1:26:53] Are man he's telling these people stay
[1:26:56] the way you are this is not for
[1:26:59] you now look let me show you something
[1:27:02] did you know there's 10,000 voices in
[1:27:04] this room well if there was 10,000 back
[1:27:06] then there's 10 million in this room
[1:27:08] right now there wasn't cell phones they
[1:27:11] wasn't all this internet stuff there
[1:27:12] wasn't the wireless stuff in 1964 or
[1:27:15] three as much as there is now so I'll
[1:27:18] promise you a lot more is going through
[1:27:19] this room than was during his
[1:27:22] time so why don't you hear them you know
[1:27:25] what he's telling the people you're
[1:27:27] hearing me but you're not hearing me you
[1:27:30] have no receptor to pick up what I'm
[1:27:32] telling you you're hearing my physical
[1:27:35] voice but you're not catching the
[1:27:38] Revelation they're waving right through
[1:27:40] here now there's people forms and bodies
[1:27:43] moving right through this room same here
[1:27:45] is that right well why don't you see
[1:27:47] them they're here actual voices look
[1:27:51] like my voice
[1:27:54] pretty plain like my
[1:27:56] voice well why don't you hear
[1:27:59] it see it's got to strike something
[1:28:02] first to reveal
[1:28:05] it now don't you understand so just
[1:28:07] don't interpret nothing if God wants you
[1:28:09] to know anything he'll send it to you
[1:28:12] that's right amen remember this is thus
[1:28:15] sayith the
[1:28:16] Lord so just be real real solid now
[1:28:19] whole still something has
[1:28:21] happened he's not saying this cuz
[1:28:24] nothing's happened Something's Happened
[1:28:27] they just can't get it right right
[1:28:29] there's voices in the room voice of God
[1:28:31] in the room they're just not hearing it
[1:28:35] don't try to make yourself odd to be a
[1:28:36] Christian cuz you take yourself away
[1:28:38] from God and you you if you can
[1:28:41] understand it this is that third pull
[1:28:43] you should have caught that the other
[1:28:48] day so then just you remember there'll
[1:28:51] be no impersonation like there was the
[1:28:53] other too and we'll cover that later on
[1:28:56] so that's as far as you should know just
[1:28:59] remember that you see now there's
[1:29:00] something taking place in this
[1:29:03] room amen anybody with me there's
[1:29:06] something taking place in this room and
[1:29:09] there's something here there's actual in
[1:29:12] this room
[1:29:14] Angels voice of
[1:29:18] God in this
[1:29:20] room right but how do you you can't
[1:29:24] if you can't hear the natural Voice
[1:29:26] without something to send it out how you
[1:29:28] going to hear the spiritual voice right
[1:29:31] right now you might may believe that
[1:29:32] somebody's singing this certain song
[1:29:34] that might not even be there see but it
[1:29:36] when act when it actually strikes the
[1:29:39] crystal that it's supposed to
[1:29:42] strike just call me
[1:29:46] Crystal but when it actually strikes the
[1:29:49] crystal that it's supposed to
[1:29:51] strike then it gives a true interpret
[1:29:54] ration and vindicates it by showing the
[1:29:59] picture see what I mean now the spirit
[1:30:02] of God when it speaks through the two
[1:30:04] word true word it vindicates vindicates
[1:30:07] itself to show itself that is right you
[1:30:12] understand now let's stand to our
[1:30:20] feet what a privileged group of people
[1:30:22] we are amen
[1:30:25] that when the voice of God does speak
[1:30:26] through these ministers and teachers and
[1:30:28] different ones Sunday school teachers
[1:30:30] that we can get something we can hear
[1:30:32] the voice of God not the voice of
[1:30:33] somebody else it gives a true
[1:30:36] interpretation and vindicates it by
[1:30:38] showing the
[1:30:40] picture
[1:30:43] amen you take a television right now
[1:30:46] with just a set of ears and you set it
[1:30:48] right here and you turn it on it's going
[1:30:50] to pick up something now why are we not
[1:30:53] seeing it
[1:30:54] because we don't have the right
[1:30:56] receptor but brother rand's telling us
[1:30:58] thus sayith the lord they're not getting
[1:31:01] it but it's for us Amen to get if you'll
[1:31:07] listen to the voice of God Amen it'll
[1:31:11] show the picture that's
[1:31:15] right have you seen the picture
[1:31:18] yet you seen the picture where you're
[1:31:20] supposed to be have you see if you ask
[1:31:22] God where am I supposed to be Lord what
[1:31:25] am I supposed to be
[1:31:27] doing
[1:31:29] right put me
[1:31:31] somewhere where I can listen and hear
[1:31:34] the voice of God and see the voice of
[1:31:36] God working in a group of
[1:31:39] people because it wasn't for them but
[1:31:41] I'll promise you it's for
[1:31:44] us we are that group of people that have
[1:31:47] the right crystal that are the right
[1:31:49] receptors to hear the voice of God when
[1:31:52] it comes through this room amen or your
[1:31:55] room at home or your truck your chicken
[1:31:58] truck wherever God decides to speak to
[1:32:00] you you have that receptor turned
[1:32:03] on and you'll hear what he says let's
[1:32:05] sing a song man greater than all my
[1:32:09] sin greater than

[1:34:23] of

[1:34:30] all the blood of the
[1:34:33] Lamb amen and brother R told us he said
[1:34:37] what in the end time he said the bride
[1:34:40] is the blood by the spirit amen the
[1:34:44] bride we're the we're the blood covering
[1:34:48] sorry if you got Christ in
[1:34:50] you because when we leave what's going
[1:34:52] to happen

[1:34:56] blood's gone except going to the Jews
[1:34:59] for the Gentiles there's no more person
[1:35:00] to be saved there's no Holy Ghost here
[1:35:02] to save them it all goes to the
[1:35:05] Jews but let's get it let's be the
[1:35:08] crystal let's be the receptor and just
[1:35:12] ask God say look Lord we're coming to a
[1:35:15] time where we can't play we're coming to
[1:35:18] a time where I got to understand what's
[1:35:19] going
[1:35:21] on and put somebody in the p bed to help
[1:35:24] me right I said put somebody in the pull
[1:35:28] bit to help
[1:35:30] me amen
[1:35:33] amen do you want that yes I want that I
[1:35:38] want to go on and be that receptor that
[1:35:41] God saw brother brown maybe didn't see
[1:35:43] Terence Dale standing in a in a church
[1:35:46] in Lula
[1:35:48] Georgia but I believe God showed him the
[1:35:51] bride and that that was bride but that
[1:35:54] wasn't the ones there that was supposed
[1:35:55] to get what he was talking about but
[1:35:58] there is a group over here that's going
[1:35:59] to receive it and get it and live it
[1:36:03] understand it and be a part of this
[1:36:06] that's right I don't want to be left
[1:36:08] behind I don't want to be left out I
[1:36:10] hate being left
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:12] out and God will never leave you
[1:36:15] out if you'll ask him am he's knocking
[1:36:19] in the door of you too
[1:36:24] you're the one that got to let him
[1:36:26] in and brother Brown said even when he
[1:36:29] gets into your house he said you got
[1:36:30] doors inside of
[1:36:32] doors that if you don't want God to go
[1:36:34] in there he was polite he won't go in
[1:36:36] there but let's open all of our doors
[1:36:40] this year coming up we've been talking
[1:36:41] for two or three years to let it out
[1:36:43] well you know what let's start using
[1:36:45] what we've let out yesen let's start you
[1:36:49] when when that message was released from
[1:36:51] Brother brandom it began to drop on
[1:36:53] people people and they began to
[1:36:54] understand maybe just a few here and a
[1:36:56] few there then they would gather as a
[1:36:58] church then in 1971 we gathered as a
[1:37:01] church and then we started under the
[1:37:03] message of the hour and then it grew to
[1:37:05] more churches and it grew to more
[1:37:06] churches cuz in 1971 there wasn't many
[1:37:09] message churches right wasn't many maybe
[1:37:12] two or three four or five around this
[1:37:13] area there was only a couple but she's
[1:37:16] grown cuz somebody's picked up the
[1:37:19] receptor of God for their
[1:37:22] day has picked up their favorite radio
[1:37:28] station and you're listening to
[1:37:32] it you go get you go get in your car
[1:37:34] tonight and and you turn on the radio
[1:37:36] and it's rock and
[1:37:38] roll it's in there all you got to do is

[1:41:21] message and Men gathered around him and
[1:41:24] some of them called him God some of them
[1:41:26] called him false some of them called him
[1:41:28] this and that and the other but Lord we
[1:41:31] know he was the prophet to us in the end
[1:41:34] time and that we would have a voice
[1:41:37] along with his
[1:41:38] voice and that we would speak in the end
[1:41:42] time human beings becoming the son of
[1:41:47] man not in one person but in a
[1:41:50] collective
[1:41:51] body cuz the Bride of Jes Jesus Christ I
[1:41:54] believe will be the son of man in the
[1:41:55] end time you you preached that for for
