[0:01] god bless you saints you can turn in
[0:03] your bible over to hebrews
[0:06] again
[0:07] it's good to be back in the house of the
[0:09] lord and and it is good to have terence
[0:14] back um let's uh hit the brothers could
[0:17] pull up the powerpoint slide and uh
[0:20] we'll just we'll just go through a
[0:21] little review of hebrews 1 and and
[0:27] and just kind of talk about where we
[0:28] left off god who has sundry times and in
[0:31] diverse manners spake in times past unto
[0:34] the fathers by the prophets
[0:36] so paul again he was explaining that
[0:37] that that god um in the old testament
[0:40] spake in time passed in a lot of
[0:42] different ways a lot of different times
[0:44] he was the one doing the speaking
[0:46] through the prophets and then in this
[0:48] last days he spake unto us by his son
[0:52] the one that was doing the speaking
[0:54] was made manifest and now
[0:56] everything that we hear and everything
[0:58] that we believe everything that we teach
[0:59] stem from the things that he spoke for
[1:02] those three and a half years that he was
[1:03] on the earth
[1:04] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:06] and the express image of his person he
[1:08] was actually that the uh if you want to
[1:10] know who the father is you look at look
[1:12] at the the one that declared his majesty
[1:15] and upholding all things by the word of
[1:17] his power
[1:18] when he had by himself purged our sins
[1:21] sat down on the right hand of the
[1:23] majesty on high and we'll we'll look at
[1:25] that a little bit in more detail a
[1:27] little bit later set down what that
[1:28] means to sit down on the right hand and
[1:30] brother brown said that means that
[1:32] that's a position to sit down in the
[1:34] right hand a position of power and
[1:36] authority
[1:37] on high being made so much better than
[1:39] the angels
[1:40] as he hath by inheritance obtained a
[1:42] more excellent name than they because
[1:44] he's the act he's he he was god
[1:47] manifesting flesh
[1:49] the one that was doing the speaking
[1:51] through the old testament for under
[1:52] which the angels said he at any time
[1:54] thou art my son this day have i begotten
[1:56] thee and again i will be to him a father
[1:58] and he shall be to me a son and again
[2:00] when he bringeth in the first begotten
[2:02] into the world he saith and let all the
[2:04] angels of god worship him
[2:07] and then we'll go over to hebrews 1 7 on
[2:09] the next slide
[2:10] you know you kind of think about
[2:12] paul paul was you
[2:14] follow these patterns through their
[2:15] scripture and paul really was
[2:17] after the holy ghost fell on the day of
[2:19] pentecost
[2:20] um they they they were beginning to tie
[2:23] they began they came out and began to
[2:24] preach about what this is that that the
[2:27] prophet joel talked to talked about and
[2:28] began to lay in in this in the scripture
[2:31] identify what had happened with the
[2:32] scripture but
[2:34] really until paul began to lay things
[2:36] out and begin to teach and lay things
[2:39] out they they really didn't maybe not
[2:41] know fully what they had and he paul
[2:43] began to lay out in the book of hebrews
[2:44] begin to talk about how that um now now
[2:47] we've entered into that rest that was
[2:49] prophesied in the old testament that was
[2:50] kind of spoken of in type and now he
[2:53] identified that holy ghost they had with
[2:55] the melchizedek that that talked to
[2:57] abraham the one that came to him now was
[3:00] actually dwelling within them so
[3:03] paul was laying out for them a
[3:05] foundation that now they can really
[3:07] begin to understand the things the thing
[3:09] that they have and now now carry that on
[3:12] into this day that brother branham after
[3:14] the after the holy ghost fell on azusa
[3:16] street now brother branham now he's also
[3:19] laying out things laying out exactly
[3:21] what they've got that we we have
[3:23] something more than just gifts and signs
[3:25] and wonders we've actually got again
[3:28] like like paul laid out we've got
[3:30] that melchizedek that came and spoke to
[3:32] abraham that's the one that's actually
[3:34] living on the inside of us and actually
[3:36] living out his life in us
[3:38] so we've tapped into that we've tapped
[3:40] into that supernatural power
[3:42] now
[3:43] so so and in hebrew just to kind of set
[3:46] the maybe set in your mind the context
[3:48] of what we're talking about and and in
[3:50] hebrews 1 7 we talked about in the
[3:52] angels he saith who maketh his angels
[3:53] spirits and his ministers a flame of
[3:55] fire and we kind of begin to to examine
[3:58] that a little bit more and to know that
[4:00] that the angels so many times you read
[4:02] scriptures and at first you when you're
[4:04] reading it you have a perception of what
[4:06] it's really trying to say and the more
[4:07] that you read it it begins to open up
[4:09] and begin begins to unfold and you begin
[4:11] to realize maybe you weren't looking at
[4:13] it in the right way initially as god
[4:15] begins to speak to you and this might be
[4:17] one of those things
[4:19] where initially we're looking at it as
[4:21] from the perspective of well there's
[4:24] supernatural angels and but then as the
[4:26] more you read and meditate on the things
[4:28] that brother random said about this he's
[4:30] bringing it down to an an earthly
[4:33] an actual where you sit in church and
[4:35] you can listen to a man speak to you and
[4:37] help help you and can benefit by going
[4:40] to church
[4:41] now if we go we'll kind of go through
[4:42] some of these slides a little bit
[4:44] quickly and brother brown said the
[4:45] greatest battle ever fought he said that
[4:47] god sends forth angels what are they
[4:50] ministering spirits
[4:51] ministering spirits sent from the
[4:53] presence of god
[4:54] what to do minister his word they're not
[4:57] to minister some theology of some
[4:59] denominational group
[5:01] but to minister his words and now let's
[5:03] go to the next slide real quickly and he
[5:05] said in hebrews chapter 2 he said what
[5:07] do we find the angels to be
[5:09] prophets the angels are prophets the
[5:11] angels that that now again that paul is
[5:14] talking about in hebrews
[5:16] he said god spoken sundry time now you
[5:18] have to make not our own idea
[5:20] but the bible
[5:22] and and he said now he goes over here
[5:24] and say again for the words spoken by
[5:26] angels we're steadfast and what does an
[5:28] angel mean
[5:29] messenger
[5:30] if god anointed messenger and then if we
[5:33] be anointed we are god's messenger if we
[5:36] be anointed by that spirit and then
[5:38] you've got the true meaning of what a
[5:39] ministering spirit is it's actually the
[5:41] spirit of god speaking through an
[5:43] earthly vessel to minister to give
[5:45] somebody to equip the the chosen ones
[5:48] with something that they can can
[5:50] overcome with
[5:51] and
[5:52] if you'll go to the next slide just kind
[5:54] of a summary of some of the scriptures
[5:56] that we talked about last week and in
[5:59] hebrews chapter one he talks about it
[6:01] starts off with who make us his angel
[6:02] spirits and his ministers a flame of
[6:04] fire and then at the very end of the
[6:06] chapter he says are they not all
[6:08] ministering spirits sent forth to
[6:10] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[6:12] salvation
[6:13] and then really the clincher that
[6:15] brother brother ram talked about in
[6:16] hebrews chapter 2 he said for unto the
[6:18] angels hath he not put in subjection
[6:21] this is actually quoting david from the
[6:22] old testament
[6:24] he said but one in a certain place
[6:26] testified and he quotes what david said
[6:29] showing there that this angel that he's
[6:31] quoting was an an actual earthly angel
[6:33] an earthly messenger a man david that
[6:36] had a message to deliver to the people
[6:39] and then the next slide he said now how
[6:40] do we know they are these angels
[6:42] minister his word through his spirits
[6:44] spirit minister the word through the
[6:46] holy spirit and the spirit and the word
[6:49] came to the prophet the prophets and the
[6:51] prophets had the word of god that's the
[6:53] reason
[6:54] they could do the miracles that they did
[6:57] it wasn't the man
[6:59] it was the spirit of god in the man the
[7:02] spirit of christ and the man
[7:04] for the word of god
[7:06] and let's go to the next the next slide
[7:09] see he said in discernment of spirit he
[7:11] said now a new testament prophet
[7:14] is a preacher
[7:15] we all know that just any minister
[7:17] that's a preacher is a prophet a new
[7:19] testament prophet
[7:21] if he's prophesying preaching not to try
[7:24] to edify himself to make a big name or
[7:27] to edify his organization and then the
[7:29] next paragraph he said now if we will
[7:32] notice the motives and objectives of the
[7:34] old testament prophets
[7:36] them men had one objective and that was
[7:38] jesus christ
[7:40] they had one thing that their whole
[7:42] theme of the old testament was built
[7:44] around
[7:45] the coming messiah now the old testament
[7:48] if their motive those those angels in
[7:50] the old testament their motive was
[7:52] entirely fixated on declaring the coming
[7:54] messiah now what should our motive be in
[7:57] this day
[7:58] not to build up some our own following
[8:00] or to promote our own ideas but it
[8:02] should all be centered around one
[8:04] objective and that is jesus christ
[8:07] and then the next slide we already
[8:08] looked at that so that's a duplicate so
[8:10] we'll skip over that
[8:13] now brother brahman said and we would
[8:15] see jesus he said
[8:17] just a couple of quotes to kind of
[8:18] clinch this a little bit further he said
[8:20] the clergyman the ministers of the
[8:22] gospel sitting here on the platform
[8:25] angels ordained to preach life
[8:28] angels that the ministers of the gospel
[8:30] sitting up there in a platform with him
[8:32] would be actually angels ordained to
[8:34] preach life and then in the way back he
[8:36] said he was talking about stephen when
[8:38] he uh preached his his little sermon
[8:41] there in in the seventh chapter of acts
[8:43] he said his face
[8:44] shine like an angel
[8:46] his face might not have shined like an
[8:48] angel up there
[8:50] but an angel knows what he's doing an
[8:53] angel is a messenger
[8:56] that's commissioned from god
[8:58] now so we've got a little background a
[9:00] little bit we kind of talked about that
[9:01] last last sunday that the angels that
[9:04] paul's talking about are ministers to
[9:06] bring you the word now let's go over to
[9:08] first corinthians real quick on the next
[9:10] slide and talk about this
[9:12] maybe often misunderstood scripture that
[9:14] says for this cause
[9:16] off the woman now in first corinthians
[9:18] chapter 11 if you
[9:20] if you're not familiar with that
[9:23] paul actually lays down how how why we
[9:26] we believe that we we wear long hair
[9:29] why do we wear long hair now this is
[9:31] here's the reason
[9:33] he said for this cause
[9:35] off the woman to have power the sisters
[9:37] i'm talking about the sisters where long
[9:38] hair ought the woman to have power on
[9:40] her head
[9:42] because of the angels
[9:44] now hebrews chapter one we just went
[9:46] through what was it what are the angels
[9:48] what does that mean though what see a
[9:50] lot of times you can be getting the
[9:51] perception in your mind you begin to
[9:53] think that you're wearing long hair
[9:55] because you're scared of some kind of
[9:57] supernatural entity that you can't see
[9:59] or something that the angels might be
[10:00] present walking around in the building
[10:01] and so you're wearing long hair because
[10:03] of a supernatural angel that could be
[10:05] sitting in the chair that's not the
[10:06] meaning of it that's not the meaning
[10:08] that he's trying to convey
[10:11] and if you go down to in verse 15 it
[10:13] says but if a woman have long hair it is
[10:15] a glory to her
[10:17] for her hair is giving her for a
[10:19] covering so there's the proof now that
[10:21] that and in first corinthians chapter 11
[10:23] he talks about you you got to have a
[10:25] woman's got to have her hair covered
[10:27] her head covered but her hair is
[10:29] actually given to her for recovery
[10:32] that's the covering that god gave you is
[10:34] your long hair
[10:36] why do you wear long hair
[10:38] now now way down at the bottom i
[10:40] apologize you can't read that maybe
[10:41] that's just a note for myself but power
[10:45] if you go back to what look at what the
[10:46] greek says
[10:48] power the definition of that word power
[10:50] in this case is it's a sign of the
[10:52] husband's authority over his wife
[10:54] in other words the veil with which
[10:56] propriety required a woman to cover
[10:58] herself so she's got power on her head
[11:02] which shows that she's in subjection to
[11:04] her husband
[11:06] now that's boy that's a touchy subject
[11:08] because you know one of the one of the
[11:09] most difficult one of the most difficult
[11:11] things that god has been trying to do is
[11:13] to bring his bride into total subjection
[11:16] to him
[11:18] one of really one of the most difficult
[11:20] things if you can get if you can get a
[11:21] man and a woman and are in perfect
[11:23] harmony and the woman is in subjection
[11:25] to the man in the right way
[11:27] not not all of this tommy rotten
[11:29] pollution that's out there but if you
[11:31] can hit a real man
[11:33] running his home the way she should
[11:35] and a woman in subjection to that man
[11:38] then my you've got a real you you've got
[11:40] a masterpiece
[11:42] so the reason let's look let's examine
[11:45] that now the reason that a woman
[11:47] is supposed to wear long hair
[11:50] because of the angels
[11:52] she's showing that she is living her
[11:54] life
[11:55] under the authority of the message that
[11:58] the angels the ministers have brought to
[12:01] her
[12:01] so she's showing that she's under
[12:03] headship to the word
[12:05] and that's why she has a long hair now
[12:07] that's why paul again if you go back and
[12:09] read in first corinthians chapter 11
[12:12] he says if you're going to cut off a
[12:13] little bit of your hair you might as
[12:15] well cut it it's it's as though you were
[12:17] just go ahead and cut it all off because
[12:19] if you're going to say well i'm not
[12:20] going to believe all any other word then
[12:22] you're not really believing
[12:24] you're not believing the word
[12:26] you you wear your long hair is a
[12:29] a symbol
[12:30] that you believe the word that you have
[12:32] heard now let's go to the next slide and
[12:34] see what brother brahm said about it
[12:36] he said in the meanest man in santa
[12:38] maria
[12:40] don't you love brother around his sermon
[12:42] titles
[12:43] he said that's the way the women is
[12:45] supposed to wear long hair
[12:48] because of her head which is her husband
[12:50] because of her of her head
[12:52] which is her husband you wear long hair
[12:54] because it shows you're under headship
[12:56] to your husband
[12:57] he's to have short hair because of
[12:59] christ
[13:00] the woman wears long hair because of the
[13:04] angels
[13:06] what is the angels
[13:08] the messenger
[13:09] a true messenger to the church
[13:13] that's right he will always call it down
[13:15] and say it's wrong see and so forth and
[13:17] the church to be so yielded to jesus
[13:20] that it don't claim its own head
[13:23] its own headship
[13:25] christ is the headship of the church
[13:27] veiled we're not our own
[13:30] but where he is
[13:32] yielded to him and him alone how
[13:35] beautiful now you see how scripture just
[13:36] ties together so perfectly that now we
[13:39] can read hebrews 1 and 2 and then go
[13:41] over to hebrew in first corinthians 11
[13:43] and now we have an understanding of what
[13:45] this scripture means that you wear long
[13:47] hair because you're under you're not
[13:49] your own anymore you've been bought with
[13:51] a price and and you're yielded to your
[13:54] husband and it shows that you're he is
[13:56] now and so you wear long hair to show
[13:59] that
[14:01] you know that's one of those things that
[14:03] you know really you can argue all day
[14:05] long about many of these things but i
[14:07] when when the holy ghost really gets a
[14:09] hold of you and opens it up to you then
[14:11] it removes the argument and you actually
[14:14] begin to live out what paul was talking
[14:16] about here
[14:18] let's go to the next slide he says now
[14:20] now this is just kind of a summary of
[14:23] of of what we've been talking about the
[14:25] angels are an angel is a new testament
[14:27] prophet
[14:29] filled with the holy spirit
[14:31] anointed to bring the word a new
[14:33] testament the difference between an old
[14:35] testament prophet and a new testament
[14:37] prophet is the new testament prophet has
[14:39] got the baptism in the holy ghost in
[14:40] their soul
[14:42] and that
[14:43] that's that's a that's a pretty big
[14:45] difference
[14:46] the ability for god to actually
[14:48] tabernacle himself inside of someone now
[14:50] in the new testament and speak out to
[14:52] minister his word he said they're not to
[14:54] minister some theology of some
[14:56] denominational group but to minister his
[14:58] word
[14:59] reflecting the light of jesus christ the
[15:01] apostles pastors teachers evangelist
[15:04] prophets
[15:05] under their messenger and that's that's
[15:07] a big key what we'll look at in a second
[15:10] now let's go to the next slide
[15:12] he said
[15:14] then the prophet
[15:15] or the preacher which is a new testament
[15:17] prophet a preacher when he comes forth
[15:20] begins to move through himself and he
[15:22] that's a quote where he's just trying to
[15:24] place the gifts in the church that when
[15:26] you a gift of prophecy is when a gift
[15:30] god can speak through use someone in
[15:31] that moment to speak through and
[15:34] prophesy
[15:35] but
[15:36] a a prophet or the preacher which is a
[15:38] new testament prophet when he comes
[15:40] forth and begins to deliver his message
[15:42] god's actually using him to deliver
[15:45] something to the church
[15:47] let's go to the next slide he said a
[15:49] prophet
[15:50] is a seer who sees now see here's the
[15:52] difference between a new testament
[15:55] prophet slash preacher
[15:57] and a prophet who's a seer
[16:00] a prophet is a seer who sees the
[16:02] people's heart and foretells the things
[16:04] that's coming to pass
[16:06] but a prophet
[16:08] p-r-o-p-h-e-t is born to prophet
[16:11] always from but was ordained before the
[16:14] world ever begin see now you take jesus
[16:17] christ the king of prophets he was from
[16:20] the garden of eden the seed of the woman
[16:22] and prophet and moses was born a proper
[16:25] child the prophet
[16:26] john the baptist why isaiah saw him 712
[16:30] years before he was born and said he's
[16:33] the voice of one crying in the
[16:34] wilderness
[16:35] 712 12 years before he was born
[16:40] god said before he was even formed in
[16:42] his mother's womb that he knew him and
[16:44] sanctified him and ordained him a
[16:46] prophet to the nations
[16:48] now let's examine this a little bit more
[16:50] on the next slide
[16:53] now so a new testament prophet
[16:55] is somebody that's preaching the word in
[16:57] the new testament i think we've proven
[16:59] that out now
[17:00] that's that's god god they've got the
[17:02] baptism of the holy ghost and they're
[17:04] meant they're ministering spirit
[17:06] but now
[17:07] within that within that you've got like
[17:09] highlighted in green and this this chart
[17:12] maybe
[17:13] uh has a few issues and i'll explain
[17:15] that in a second so but but in the in
[17:18] the first church days paul was a prophet
[17:20] a seer that he said i went to the third
[17:23] heaven and all those kind of things and
[17:24] underneath him underneath him he had
[17:27] there's apostles prophets teachers
[17:29] evangelists and pastors and within that
[17:31] five full ministry there's an office
[17:34] called a prophet and that is a seer
[17:37] and there are prophets still in the day
[17:39] i i was sharing earlier in one of the
[17:41] earlier sunday school lessons that there
[17:43] there are prophets in africa and south
[17:46] america and throughout the world and i
[17:48] was listening to a testimony of one and
[17:50] i can out
[17:52] we can talk about that later if you're
[17:53] interested to know but um
[17:57] he was sharing how that he he has a gift
[18:00] where he can see visions and knows
[18:01] people he said i was listening to his
[18:03] testimony and he said i know who's
[18:05] trying to take over the church and he
[18:06] said i don't
[18:08] i don't share those things openly
[18:10] because you know i i did it at first
[18:12] initially in my in my life and that you
[18:14] begin to tear
[18:15] people places apart he said i don't want
[18:17] people to do things because they're
[18:18] afraid of me you're afraid of the gift i
[18:20] want i i don't want them to live a life
[18:23] because they're afraid of me i want them
[18:24] to live a life of worthy of the gospel
[18:27] because that the god has actually got a
[18:29] hold of them and changed them and they
[18:31] fall in love with christ
[18:33] but there are prophets and so don't get
[18:35] in your mind that we don't have prophets
[18:37] anymore there certainly are prophets
[18:39] but prophets in this case like paul a
[18:42] seer or or prophets in the final
[18:45] ministry a seer that's able to see a
[18:46] vision and and and and look into your
[18:49] life and those kind of things so there's
[18:51] when when brother branham would say in
[18:53] his message the word prophet sometimes
[18:56] it means a little bit different things
[18:58] it could mean a new testament prophet a
[19:00] preacher it could mean someone like paul
[19:03] or it could mean somebody
[19:05] somebody uh
[19:06] you know
[19:07] somebody within the five full ministry
[19:09] that has that gift of sight a gift a
[19:11] gift of prophecy to look into your life
[19:14] now now all down through the seven
[19:16] church ages
[19:18] you've got these ministers that are over
[19:20] they they bring a message
[19:23] for that age
[19:24] like paul irenaeus martin columba luther
[19:27] wesley and and brother branham begins
[19:29] we're talking about ministering spirits
[19:31] now ministering spirits and each of
[19:33] those they're bringing a message for
[19:35] their age and under their message people
[19:38] get a hold of that men get a hold of
[19:39] that and they begin to declare that
[19:41] message
[19:42] so at the beginning
[19:44] isn't it interesting the very first
[19:46] church agent started out with a prophet
[19:48] at the very last church age it ended
[19:50] with a prophet and under those prophets
[19:53] under those men you've got the five-fold
[19:55] ministry
[19:56] one of which is a prophet a seer
[19:59] but all of them
[20:00] are speaking anointed by the holy ghost
[20:02] to deliver a message
[20:05] um i hope i hope that's clear if anybody
[20:07] has any questions feel free to i i love
[20:09] feedback i've gotten a lot of feedback
[20:11] so far about people can't see the slides
[20:13] and that the font needs to be bigger or
[20:14] anything and that don't bother me at all
[20:17] i want to i want to improve so if you if
[20:19] anything's not clear or anything feel
[20:21] free to to let me know
[20:23] or brother way or whatever
[20:26] now let's read this quote brother brown
[20:28] said in the dark ages the word was
[20:30] entirely lost to the people almost
[20:33] entirely lost to the people but god sent
[20:35] luther with the word
[20:37] the lutheran spoke for god at that time
[20:39] but they organized and again the pure
[20:41] word was lost for organization tends
[20:44] toward dogma and creeds and not simple
[20:46] words they can no longer speak for god
[20:50] then god sent wesley
[20:52] and he
[20:53] was the voice with the word in his day
[20:56] the people who took his revelation from
[20:58] god became the living epistles read and
[21:01] known of all men for their generation
[21:04] so in other words we're talking about
[21:05] these spirits that ministered in each
[21:08] age
[21:08] and under each age you've got these
[21:11] people that
[21:12] find full ministry that pick that
[21:13] message up
[21:15] and they also are ministering spirits to
[21:17] the people
[21:19] when the methodist failed god raised up
[21:21] others and so it has gone on for the
[21:23] years until in this last day there is
[21:25] again another people in the land
[21:28] who under their messenger
[21:31] will be the final voice to the final age
[21:35] under their messenger
[21:36] so
[21:38] we uh
[21:39] we've got to say that
[21:41] exactly the same thing that he said
[21:45] let's go let's go to the next slide and
[21:47] look at this so we're again we're
[21:48] talking about the angels he saith who
[21:50] maketh his angels spirits and his
[21:53] ministers a flame of fire
[21:55] and that same thought can be carried on
[21:57] over into revelation
[21:59] ministering spirits the spirit of god
[22:01] actually ministering in in men
[22:04] where in revelation chapter one verse
[22:06] four it says john to the seven churches
[22:08] which are in asia grace be unto you and
[22:10] it talks about from the seven spirits
[22:12] which are before his throne
[22:14] and in revelation chapter three it says
[22:16] these things saith he that hath the
[22:18] seven spirits of god
[22:20] and in revelation chapter six says to
[22:22] the lambs that had been slain having
[22:24] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[22:26] seven spirits of god sent forth into all
[22:29] the earth now we're just following this
[22:31] thread from hebrews down first
[22:34] corinthians down into revelation
[22:37] following this this line of thought
[22:39] through the bible
[22:41] these are the same things ministering
[22:43] spirits that god is actually ministering
[22:45] through men
[22:47] now let's go to the next slide it says
[22:49] the sardisian church age the spirits was
[22:51] the angels
[22:53] that went to the stars which were
[22:56] messengers
[22:57] that's kind of a media little statement
[22:58] right there
[23:00] seven spirits
[23:02] seven different times the holy spirit
[23:04] would anoint a messenger
[23:06] which was a star in his day
[23:09] seven times the holy spirit would anoint
[23:12] a messenger so it's the holy spirit
[23:14] speaking through these seven men
[23:17] a spirit is eternal and the star that
[23:19] was made for a purpose to reflect light
[23:21] in the dark of these church ages
[23:24] where cane candles and stars are
[23:26] representing the angel
[23:28] the spirit was the one that went to the
[23:31] star
[23:32] and reflected the light of the holy
[23:34] spirit through this star to that church
[23:36] age
[23:37] it's the seven messengers
[23:39] of the seven church ages see
[23:42] now in each time that the star came in
[23:44] on the scene
[23:45] the holy spirit came down and anointed
[23:48] that star and kept it just exactly
[23:50] like the first one was
[23:52] now let's go to the next slide he said
[23:54] what is those seven spirits seven
[23:57] messengers
[23:58] there's saint columba and irenaeus and
[24:01] john wesley and martin luther
[24:04] and so forth the seven spirits which are
[24:07] seven men seven angels which are seven
[24:10] messengers
[24:11] now we're just following that following
[24:13] that three and now and we'll we'll end
[24:15] on this and of the angel let's just skip
[24:17] the next slide and go to the one right
[24:19] after that
[24:20] now the angels he saith who maketh his
[24:23] angels spirits and the musicians should
[24:25] go ahead and start coming forward
[24:27] who maketh his angels spirits and his
[24:29] ministers a flame of fire because when
[24:32] you got when you met the pillar of fire
[24:35] yourself
[24:36] when you've got an experience with god
[24:38] yourself it causes you you've got a
[24:40] message that you want to deliver
[24:42] so paul's saying again of the angels who
[24:45] saith he maketh his angels spirits and
[24:47] his ministers a flame of fire the
[24:50] ministers get carrying forth a message
[24:52] for the people anointed by the spirit of
[24:55] god
[24:56] and god bless you
[24:58] and god bless the remaining servants
