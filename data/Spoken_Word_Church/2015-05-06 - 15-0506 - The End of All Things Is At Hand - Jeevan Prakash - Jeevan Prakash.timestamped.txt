[6:03] first of
[6:04] all uh you need to pray for
[6:08] me I am going through tough time because
[6:13] last year
[6:15] March
[6:17] 22 my wife she's gone to be with the
[6:20] Lord this May 12th will be 49 years our
[6:26] meing our our our wedding you know May
[6:29] 12th so I miss her and then U within few
[6:35] days you know same April 17th last year
[6:39] my sister-in-law only Sister to Sister
[6:42] Mary she was very young you know 50 52
[6:45] and she's gone uh by the cancer you know
[6:49] and then uh in the month of March this
[6:51] year uh March 13th my mom she passed
[6:55] away my mother so you know how you know
[7:00] uh so you pray for me I need your
[7:03] special prayers I need God's grace
[7:07] praise the name of the Lord so anyhow
[7:10] the prophet of God said all our loved
[7:12] ones are gone and they are not going to
[7:14] come back but we are going to see them
[7:18] very soon face to face and I believe
[7:20] that with my whole heart praise the name
[7:22] of the Lord so precious brothers and
[7:24] sisters uh
[7:26] also uh at present we have a very
[7:29] bad government very very bad
[7:33] government um worst government in Indian
[7:39] history and uh they are with full
[7:43] majority they are in White House you say
[7:46] white house we got you know uh we call
[7:48] central government you know and and they
[7:51] are the rulers you know and they can do
[7:53] anything and um um at present they are
[7:58] very good our for our prime minister is
[8:01] in very good terms with Obama President
[8:04] Obama and he visited here uh few I think
[8:09] last year uh then um then he invited
[8:12] President Obama uh to as to India as a
[8:17] guest speaker on 15th of August 15th
[8:21] August is our independence day that's
[8:24] the time in 1947 15th August you know
[8:27] britishers left India and and we got
[8:29] freedom so he was a guest speaker there
[8:32] you know in um in Delhi President Obama
[8:36] and uh so you know how many people came
[8:40] with him to India
[8:42] 2,000
[8:45] Americans
[8:47] 2,000 they came to India as a security
[8:50] you know
[8:52] so um this present prime
[8:56] minister
[8:58] uh is a wicked
[9:02] man because when you in every state we
[9:06] have uh uh chief minister and the
[9:10] governor so when he was a chief minister
[9:12] in Gujarat state state of Gujarat that
[9:15] is
[9:16] Northwest he killed thousands thousands
[9:18] of Christians when he was a chief
[9:21] minister so now is's in the central
[9:23] government in White House in
[9:26] India I don't know what is going to do
[9:29] but and uh he's trying to bring a funny
[9:33] laws and uh his people forcing lot of
[9:38] Christians uh back to
[9:40] Hinduism and uh so um they're trying
[9:45] their best to bring ban because uh you
[9:47] know they are all you know those who are
[9:49] in the parliament at present you know uh
[9:52] except opposition party you know they
[9:54] are all deadly against Christianity and
[9:57] I believe this is the squee time for
[9:59] Christians in India and not only in
[10:02] India all over the world so many
[10:03] Christians are getting killed you know
[10:05] killing and so uh remember uh as in your
[10:10] special prayers by the grace of the Lord
[10:13] God is keeping us and uh helping us
[10:17] blessing us and uh and we are we are
[10:20] working for the Lord and and uh because
[10:24] the Bible says when it is the day you
[10:26] know we must work you know the night is
[10:28] coming no nobody likes to work so uh by
[10:32] the grace of the lord we are doing our
[10:34] best to uh preach this gospel uh in
[10:37] tribal areas and wherever it's possible
[10:39] and also um uh we uh God is blessing us
[10:44] spiritually and uh in sik rabad where I
[10:47] am where P Sam is pastoring there we got
[10:51] uh about 300 people every Sunday by the
[10:54] grace of the Lord including children
[10:56] then Boaz is also uh pastoring two
[10:59] churches there you know and he's also
[11:02] having by the grace of the Lord 2 250
[11:04] every every day every every Sunday so uh
[11:07] God is using my both the sons uh
[11:09] wonderfully praise the name of the Lord
[11:11] I don't know what I would do without
[11:12] them you know they are they are strong
[11:15] in the message of the hour and and

[15:24] hour we want our Brethren you know
[15:26] ministers to be strong you know firm for
[15:29] the message praise the name of the Lord

[15:34] ministers meeting every month praise the
[15:36] name of the Lord also in once in two
[15:39] months uh we have uh a special meeting
[15:43] uh so in that meeting that's a uh mixed
[15:46] congregation Hindus Muslims and uh you
[15:50] know Janss Buddhas or whatever you say
[15:53] that India got a multiple Rel religions
[15:55] many religions so people come and when

[16:02] the prayers and they believe in the
[16:03] prayers when the Christians pray they
[16:05] get healed praise the name of the Lord
[16:08] so that's the mixed congregation we get
[16:10] and uh you know that's the time God
[16:12] gives us opportunity they give their
[16:14] heart to the Lord and we baptize 10 15

[29:22] of God right the prophet of God preached
[29:24] in you know sman Church huh smna
[29:29] church church book cpt4 here is talking

[29:48] important for the Christian people
[29:50] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[29:52] here using our god-given rule of
[29:55] choosing the messenger of for each Age
[29:59] We unhesitatingly declare that the irus
[30:02] was exalted by the Lord to that position
[30:05] you know irus Prophet talked about the
[30:08] irus he was the disciple of that great
[30:11] Saint and the warrior of Faith polycarp
[30:17] right and it is no doubt that he set at
[30:21] the feet of that great man he learned
[30:24] the Christian
[30:26] Graces that flowed from his consecrated
[30:29] life yeah for polycarp was one of the
[30:33] truly uh illustrious sense of all
[30:38] ages when weaved in the sight of a
[30:40] blameless life Glory also the prophet
[30:44] says here you will remember from your
[30:47] own reading that polycarp was
[30:49] mared he was mared for the truth he was
[30:53] mared for
[30:56] God I don't know in these last
[30:59] days if the sword comes on your

[31:20] know
[31:24] huh how many are getting killed

[31:35] strong for the Lord no matter what
[31:40] comes don't worry about the
[31:45] death if not today tomorrow we must
[31:49] go but if we die let us die for
[31:53] Christ let us stand for the truth Glory

[31:59] God oh my here he gave himself up to
[32:04] death but before he did before he died
[32:07] he asked for and was granted permission
[32:11] to pray for 2 hours for his brethren in
[32:14] the Lord two hours 2
[32:18] hours it hard for the Christians to pray
