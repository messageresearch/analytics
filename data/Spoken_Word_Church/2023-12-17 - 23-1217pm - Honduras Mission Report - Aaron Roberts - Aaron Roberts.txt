we're gonna have brother Michael uh give a testimony for for his trip and uh so we're gonna let brother Michael speak for a few minutes before I start tonight but uh looking forward to hearing a great testimony brother amen God bless y'all amen um as always it's it's always good to be around Believers amen no matter what country you're in no matter if you speak the language or not uh the presence of God is international so it's always um you know especially to especially even you travel in the States you go to different churches and you know they may I know you may have different culture different you know everything's a little different but the spirit of God is there so even even in Honduras even in any you know any um missionary trip anywhere you go in the world if if God is in the people then you know you feel right at home and that's why the city is the people amen that's where the people are is where God will be and so it's wonderful to go there and and to talk to people and to be treated so nicely and the churches um you know the what always strikes me about the people is they have their faith they have and they have so much faith faith and and when they have these when things come upon them and and you know some people can't uh always afford a doctor or go somewhere but right even the people who can they choose not to because they believe in God they believe that God will provide for them and God will take care of them and and that's uh something I really took away from the trip is is just how many you know little things maybe that can be healed that we you know because we have so much technological advancement we have doctors that that we don't even think about God we say well I'll go to the doctor I I'll take my pill I'll take the medicine and we don't even think to pray we don't even think to you know just brother Bob was saying consult God on those things and even those little things I remember there was um there's a case of a brother a boy said he had you know something wrong with his eyesight and um and a part of me thought you know maybe he just needs glasses and but then another part of me thought well even if he does need glasses why should he accept that you know why should he just have to settle for that and I'm not saying that if you wear glasses you don't have faith but it's just something to think about some to think about those little things in your life where sometimes we don't think about it but we have a supernatural God and even when God was taking care of the the Israel in the desert no their clothes didn't even get old their shoes didn't get old every everything was provided for them and those little things like they could have found some you know some some uh leather out there somewhere and and carved up some you know clothes for them wear but God even provided for that so there was things that they could have got themselves they could have hunted but God gave them food and all the different things they needed that they could have got themselves but God provided for them so that's something I just I really took away from the trip is just all these little things that we we think aren't you know oh I'll just go to the doctor I'll do this I'll just drink I'll do this but but sometimes we need to consult God even for the even for the small things that we think oh maybe that's not important enough but God cares about every little thing so he'll take care of us and that was a big thing I got from the trip so God BL bless you [Applause] amen appreciate these young people having the desire to go and you know I was telling them that you know it's a they say it's a a blessing for them for us to come but I told them it's a it's a blessing for me to be there right amen and you know you you you think you go to bless them I I told them they bless me more than than I could have blessed them and it's just a wonderful thing if you have your Bibles I just want to read a scripture before we get started this evening and if you will stand we'll just look first first John chapter 1 just read a few verses here uh I don't know if they'll have it up on the screen but we'll just read this right quick and then we'll get started but uh as before we read the scripture let's just let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity Lord to be in your house again Lord to gather around your word Lord we're just so thankful for all the things that you've done for us Lord we just can't thank you enough and we just pray that Lord as we take this service Lord Jesus that Lord what we say will be a blessing Lord just give you the honor and the praise for all that you've done for us Lord and Lord we just commit all things to you Lord just bless the ones that have needs Lord we just continue to hold them up and and believe Lord because we know it's a finished work and we just just continue to walk in that in that understanding and that Faith Lord that you've given us Lord Lord that because as the prophet said if he was standing here right if Jesus was standing right here right now he couldn't do more for us than what he's already done if we could just open our minds to receive that Lord Jesus Lord because it's a finished work amen and or we just got to walk into it and believe it Lord we commit ourselves into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen first John chapter 1 verse three and it says that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things are right we unto you that your joy may be full and then this then is the message that we have that we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin amen God bless you this afternoon and now I'm G to see if we can get this thing get this thing started one thing I told him in Honduras one of these days we won't have to worry about technology thank the Lord there'll be no no need for technology there going see if it's going to it's going to bring it up or we going to it's going give me trouble there howy look there we're going to see if it's going to work now well praise the Lord It's Working amen it it didn't want to work earlier but that's all right one of these days we won't ever have to worry about technology all this all the things that come off the the tree of knowledge will be done away with so we don't to worry about any of those things so we want we won't be separated by time or language or distance all of those things be done away with so I want to start off like like I started off every other service when I got to Honduras deos Los bendiga that was my that was my Spanish God Bless you that's that was that's and uh sister Bella I told them sister Bella always wanted me to speak speak Spanish everywhere I went so I tried to sing a little bit and uh and speak in Spanish so that was my that was my Spanish I spoke to them a little bit and uh they thought was funny I got laughed at uh they and sometimes they didn't understand anything I said brother Louise had to interpret by in Spanish so you know that's that's pretty bad but uh I want to thank the Lord for this opportunity to go amen yes sir and it was a blessing and uh it really blessed me and uh I want to thank the church and all your prayers and I want to thank Brother Louis and Sister Christine and we can't give them enough roses on this side I don't think uh I was I went back and I listened to brother Bob's Nicaragua I listen to a good portion of his Nicaragua report and uh one of the things that brother Bob said in his report was you know we don't realize how well regarded brother Lis is in the Spanish-speaking countries and uh man we just we just think it's Brother Louis but man when you get over there those people have a a lot of respect for brother Lise God has really used that brother amen and uh I just felt honored to be associated with him amen and Sister Christine I don't know what I don't know you can't you can't say enough about her she keeps everything running keeps up with everything yes amen and U she always wants to make sure that everybody's okay and I I didn't feel particularly well during a portion of the trip uh drinking their their coffee and eating beans three times a day doesn't make you uh productive in a way in one in some ways you're real productive uh and I and I tell you that was hard and I didn't want to say nothing to nobody and Sister Christine kept saying brother Aaron are you okay brother Aaron are you okay are you okay and I finally just told her like I'm taking medicine I'm taking medicine I'm just praying it it's and everybody and then so when you go places I just like she said well don't eat the beans don't eat the beans and everybody kept asking me said um are you are you you don't like the beans like listen I've had enough beans I was like I eat beans like once or twice a week I'm eatting them three times a day let me tell you what I'm I'm taking a break but but they they're just precious people but Sister Christine I just um man I can't I can't think them enough and she you know they and her and sister Rebecca and brother Eric they really take good care of you and I mean they wash your clothes and everything that you had need of them and they're right there with you and uh they are just super people and I just tell you if you ever want to go on a mission trip you ought to go with Brother Louis and Sister Christine that's that's I I think that's traveling first class right there so I appreciate them and Bella and Zoe I can't forget them my my my Prima back there my cousin and uh so she let everybody know that was my cousin I I don't know if y'all know my when we done my ancestry I found out I've got very small portion of um like 1.4% of my genealogy was Colombian and like 1.2% of my genealogy Is Peruvian it's like wow you can't I don't look like it but it's amazing what you find in your in your family tree and uh but uh you know we all we all come from we all came from the same place I mean you know all started in the Book of Genesis so that's where we all came from you whether whether you want to believe it or not but if you start falling it back far enough you start to see all kinds of things show up but uh you know we appreciate them there they're really talented and really blessed and they they do a a great work over there so um yeah on uh so I left on the on the 1 of uh December and uh I I thought I was going to have a layover in uh in Houston because because of the the flight that I took I flew from Atlanta to Houston and then flew from there into pomarola and I thought I was going to have a layover but we waited 15 minutes at the gate and then we waited 20 minutes on the runway trying to get out of Atlanta because they had backed up because they had storms and it had delayed flights and so by the time I thought I was going to have a layover by the time I got to Houston it was a It Was a Race cuz we were running and you don't know where you're going and there was a black lady that was in the airport and she was just directing traffic and she was just yelling and pointing and you're trying to jump from one sky train to the next one to the next one to get to where you're uh where your gate is and man it was a it was a hustle trying to get there and you know I was like you know it's just like I hope this ain't the way the whole trip goes but it's just like you're just racing racing racing just and you finally get to the gate and they're already boarding the plane and I was one of the last people to get on the plane and like praise the Lord we're on the way so and uh but yeah when I when I got to my gate I was about there was I think there was two people on the plane and we had a flight attendant that was white and everybody else was uh Hispanic with with there was three of us that spoke English and you know most everybody was bilingual but everybody was speaking Spanish on the on the plane but it was it was a good good flight uh we did have hit a little turbulence going into Honduras and there was a few times the the pilot told the flight attendants to sit down and uh the last time I went on a mission trip I went with brother Wade and we went to Jamaica and uh I thought the plane was going to fall out of the sky we went brother brother Brad pal and uh Brother Brad was praying I was singing and brother Wade was speaking the word and that's what kept kept us in the in the skies because it was it was it was a ride as the first flight I ever been on and I thought this thought thing was going to fall out of the sky and uh but this time it was it was a little bit rough just there for a while but after we got further down it cleared up and it was just clear sailing but I was like I don't know if the the Lord's trying to tell me something but these these rough I mean I we flew out west to Denver different places and you go on a go on a missionary trip and it sound like you know the whole back end of the plane just bouncing all over the place and I was like I don't know if this is a good sign or a bad sign but but I just thank the Lord that he got us there and so this is this is a if y'all don't know where Honduras is there's Honduras and was just north of Nicaragua El Salvador is there Guatemala Costa Rica and then Panama's further south and you hit Colombia in South America and then right above there was bise and Mexico and uh I told them I was like because they were asking me about some of these countries and I told them I said I graduated 31 years years ago my geography is I exactly exactly that's the reason we have Google Maps we don't have to I don't have to I mean at one time I knew where these countries were I could tell you but I couldn't tell you anything about them now but uh we just thank the Lord that the Lord got us there and it was it was really a wonderful time and we just appreciate the Lord and so there's where I got in and y'all seen some of the videos of of us arriving and so uh I got to meet brother Eric In the Flesh and when we got there I got to see sister Beck and there's olum and uh ol ol didn't want to have anything to do with me he just stared at me the whole time but he's a cute he's a cute little fell and uh brother Luis and all of them just uh we got there finally got and when you get there and you having to go through customs and they're fing out you got to fill out paperwork and I thought well they give me this paperwork on the plane to fill out but it's on your on your phone give you an app to fill out and so I fill tried to fill it out and it didn't work right so I had to get in the airport and I found this young young man who spoke English and he was able to help me get that done and then when I got to the gate uh for the Immigration Man to give and I gave him my passport and then he started asking man I thought he meant he was wanting he gave me a QR code and I was like well I already had a QR code and I already completed it and and I showed that to him and he was no no no know then then another uh gentleman that spoke broken English he come up started asking me where I was going and where I was coming from and I was like I already answered all these questions and so they were trying to get me to fill out something else and then I waited for a while then he took my passport and disappeared for a while and he finally brought my passport back and stamped it and let me go so I don't I don't know I I I don't know if I look like a terrorist or something I don't know I don't I don't think I was crossing the border from someplace but I don't know it's a a little bit under you know [Laughter] Iranian somewhere in the family tree could be you know but uh it was it was it was a little bit and so Sister Christine she's texting me when you come and where you at and so we finally got through and uh got through there and there was a man I was rolling my suitcase out and this older man he come by and he's just ready he's ready take it right out of my hand I was like okay brother if you want to roll this thing I'll let you roll it I'm not going to fight you over it I was ready I was ready to get out of there so we uh it was really a nice brother that he helped me get my luggage out and I got this meet them and then uh we got on the road and I had I I had planned on eating in Atlanta but then TSA was backed up so I didn't get to eat there and I thought well I'll eat when I get to Houston well when I got to Houston It Was a Race getting to so I didn't eat anything so the only thing I had was what they give you on the plane which is a little with a little snacks and by the time I got to Honduras I was ready to eat so uh took us to a really nice restaurant here and uh for some of y'all that don't know this is brother neelson from Nicaragua and we run into him there and we also run into brother Alexis who's one of goes to one of the churches in Honduras but brother neelson uh brother Bob knows brother neelson he's a he is a topn brother that's that's one of the finest Brothers you'd ever want to meet and these brothers they really have a desire for the word and getting the word out in their in their countries into the into the Spanish speaking uh churches and the Believers and when when they go they go and uh when you when you get to meet some of these brothers you uh start to kind of feel embarrassed and uh I tell you what these brothers they they they don't let no grass grow under their feet there really and we got to got to fellowship with him and he it was it was really a wonderful time and there's brother Alexis that ises he go to church in pomarola no in Chula okay and so brother Lexis there and and brother neelson and there we are all out fellowshipping after we got finished eating but it was it was really wonderful time to get to meet them and they weren't even planning on being there but brother neelson had brought a brother to the airport and stopped by to eat and just the way the Lord works Works things out we we were able got to got to meet and it was really really a blessing to me and then uh this is uh brother Pedro brother Pablo Pablo brother Pablo but uh his dad is the is the pastor of the church the original Pastor passed away in and this is a church in pomarola this where I preach Friday night the pastor passed away but they consider the the elder or the deacon whoever's in charge they consider them the pastor and it's his dad and this is their house and we got to go by and visit with them before church and uh they're just really precious people and uh so we got to stop by and visit with them before church and and then uh there's there's man brother Lis at the church that was in the pastor study before Friday night before we preached and uh it was uh it was a really good time and and uh there we are ministering and uh you see sister Rebecca brother Eric's wife she's playing the keyboard there on the on the edge but you know it was it was a really good time I really enjoyed my time being in pomarola uh I was preaching on uh our walk with God and uh I was talking about you know each one of us have a walk brother Ram said it's an individual walk that you've got a walk and all the things that you know has to do with our walk and and being being led of the Lord and you can't have somebody else's experience you got to have your own and you know it's just childlike faith that you that you walk with and I uh I had $5 I was trying to give one of the kids I pulled $5 out of my wallet and I was like here's $5 I was like who's got faith to come get it and I couldn't get a kid none to come get my $5 I told him I said that's amazing I come to Honduras and I said I can't give away money but uh I finally got one little girl she come up and got the got the $5 from me but um I was just but that's just childlike Faith that's what it takes just simple childlike faith and that little girl she come up and got that money and after that boy she thought I was something and uh everywhere everywhere I saw her I got a hug from her she she thought I was somebody but we really had a good time there their pre ious people and um after after the service was over with we uh went to uh one of the believer's houses and at after church and uh we got ready to go and brother neelson told me he said brother you know it's just we wouldn't had we didn't have any of this planned that we were supposed to be here tonight but you know he stayed over for the night service and he told me he said brother I said I know why I needed to be here cuz I needed to hear that sermon and man that was a that was a blessing to me and there's we made it back to that's brother Eric's house sister Becca's house and uh I uh I got treated like royalty they gave up their bed I slept in I slept in their bedroom and uh when we went to brother El and uh Lily sister Lily's house I slept in their bedroom and then when we went to Brother Ivan and sister Gloria's house which is Sister Rebecca's sisters and her husband when we went to the ministers meeting I stayed in their bedroom and uh they they let the brothers let me have that room and uh they went and stayed with his parents that weekend there the days that during the week that we were there and brother Ivan and sister sister Gloria when we went to the ministers meeting they have air conditioning that had air conditioning in their bedroom so I was the only one that got air conditioning brother Lis was in the girls room and brother Eric slept in the living room and I tell you what they uh they treat you like royalty they were it was really a blessing so I I really appreciate that so that was Friday Saturday morning we got up we went into to gusi gulpa which is the capital of the city and that's the park that we went to and that's uh um Picacho y Picacho yeah and so they have a little overlooking the city and they've got these hands in shape of a heart and there's a fountain there and and all that it's a beautiful place up there we really en enjoyed going up there and we got to there's me and brother Eric and I wore my hat brother uh I got a hat looks like you know brother Jason Watkins got a hat and he's been all over the world wearing that Green hat on on his missionary trips and I wore mine I like well I need to I saw brother Lis had his hats it's like well it gets hot over I'm going to wear something cuz I'm going get blistered if not I didn't know how hot it was going to be but uh it ain't cool over there but most of the time the the weather was really nice it was it was really I really enjoyed it it was really really nice and so we got to go there and then uh this is the first of the uh two birthday parties that we crashed uh we just showed up at the Park and uh we were you know we're just going to Fellowship have walk around and and see the sights and uh we run into some people from some of the Believers from the church in toosa and they were having a a birthday party for one of the uh uh little girls that was she was tur1 years old and so we got invited to a birthday party and they they don't do nothing small and so there's the there's the parents and the little girl and she let me hold her for about 30 seconds and uh that's that was about as long she wanted me to have anything to do with her but I got to meet a number of the Believers there and that was that was really nice and there's all the Believers and then some of the family also that was in the picture and it was really blessing to me that they asked me to pray over the little girl and the family and dedicate her to the Lord and and uh you saw the video of it you know I told him I said brother Dale's always said that you know when we go to dedicate children we dedicate Our Lives to live the right kind of life before these children and it's not just dedicating mom and dad to raise a child but all of us are responsible for living the right kind of life before the children and so that's what I was telling we all dedicate ourselves to be the right kind of people and when they look for an example they can find one and so that was the pictures there and then another part of the uh the park uh you you go into and they have the hall or the plaza of confucious so they have a a a there's confucious there's a little Plaza area little Park in the park and it's really nice looking place and there's confucious and then they have the plaza of the philosophers and so there's different uh statues of you the bust of the different philosophers that you go through like Plato and the different ones and they tell you all about that but uh I was telling brother Luis I thought was really interesting because you go past confucious and the philosophers and you got to walk this winding pathway up and you keep walking and walking and walking coming all these steps and all the way around and you come to this place and you reach Christ if you leave if you leave philosophy be behind and all the world religions and all this kind of stuff there's a pathway it's not easy but you keep walking and you can find the Risen Savior and there he is at the top and I just thought that was that was really amazing we got to go up there and see that and that's the city at toosa and those people are packed in there it's amazing how you know you just start to look and it's just houses stacked up against each other little shacks and stuff but it was just just amazing how compact everything's in there but it was a it was really a nice uh beautiful place to go and and visit and then we're passing through the town and we're in toosa going through there and I want to show this because uh if you see the sign there's Burger King Church's Chicken and Little Caesars all on one little sign right there and uh and then the other one that's that's their Starbucks espresso Americano that's their that's the Starbucks that they have and uh been went to several of those well is over there everybody when you go anywhere they won't take you to get coffee and that's where they won't take you and uh there he is brother brother Wade said you look for miracles well I found one I got I got to hold him for a little while I got to hold him twice in while we were over there but he he didn't he didn't care for my hat too much but uh I got to hold him for a little bit and uh got to walk around with him and uh he got brother Eric got some pictures of that but it was a really good time and then this is the second one brother Salvador's daughter sister Sharon sister Sharon yes sister Sharon she had a birthday party that night and so we got to go by and visit with them and um one of the things I I wanted to do was uh try to find songs the the the hymns that were in Spanish the the Spanish words and we went to Brother Salvador's house and he had he had a song book and I got to take pictures of it and uh one of the things that when I was over there and uh I was praying one night and the Lord laid a song on my heart and just about everywhere I went I sang on the wings of a of a dove but I had I wanted them to sing it too and it's so beautiful and uh I love that song on the wings of a snow white dove and uh I'm trying to learn that in Spanish but that was that was my song but I had I got the words to the song and uh they really helped me with that and uh but uh uh hopefully I can and learn some of the songs of the same songs that we sing you know they they changed them you know they have them in the Spanish language also and uh so Sunday morning this is Brother Eric Church uh but the Shalom Tabernacle and the outside of it there and uh there's Brother Louis and I ministering Sunday morning and uh we had a had a really good time and I preached a message on a place of refuge and uh brother Eric told me that he said afterwards he said people were still talking about that message it really it really spoke to a lot of people so and uh it was uh really a blessing to have brother Lise he's my he's my interpreter and I told everybody that he was my he was my mouth and ears everywhere I went and uh because people wanted to speak to me and I had had no idea what they were saying or but he always took care of me and so Sunday afternoon after we ate we were going to brother Elise Church in husa so we had to leave and drive and that's like 3 three and a half hour drive and brother edos osta he's a young Minister there in the in uh Honduras and uh he was one come and take us up there and uh I got to I got to travel like royalty I got to ride in the front and uh Sister Christine and brother Luis rode in the back of the truck with the luggage and but they they laid back there and went to sleep but uh they they told me that brother edros he's very he's a very quiet brother and they told me said um you'll have a long ride by yourself you know not talking brother edos has never met me he didn't know anything about me but we we talked he uh we we used all the Spanish and all the English that we knew he knows very little English and I know very little Spanish but we translated and and the rest of the time we played charades we were we were trying to communicate we had to we tried to try to act it out and he just give me this we figured things out but uh it was it was a lot of fun CU he he thought he was just going to you know brother Luis told me said he's kind of quiet you probably you know a quiet ride well he didn't know me the most of I mean most of the time one of us well I was talking and I was trying to get him to understand and he did he did respond some so but he's he's just a precious brother and uh he was one he was one of the brother brothers that was in the uh in the Youth Camp when they uh they had the meeting with the uh for the young people and uh they they broke up into small groups in the in the uh in the youth camp and uh he was one of the brothers that led one of the small groups uh that's the National Police and hey I found a sign it set America on it and and all of Honda say America it's like that was the one thing and uh but um everywhere you go they have the the they have uh just roadblocks set up you know they just have like stations set up for the National Police they just different places and they just got you see these blue Road cones set up and they've got uh speed bumps and when you get to that place then you uh know that you've uh got to slow down and sometimes the cops are there sometimes they're not and sometimes they'll stop you and sometimes they won't but you just roll down your windows and drive real slow past the past the and police and then and then you go on but uh they're they're everywhere and uh sometimes you'll see them driving buying trucks and I mean they all all SWAT teed out you mean they're and uh especially when we got down toward uh San Lorenzo toward El Salvador the Border uh you see them moving you know out doing a lot more because of people uh coming across the border and everything but uh on the way up uh I had several pictures of this but I just wanted to show you this this is in the city of kakamas and uh this is this is their welcome sign they have these great big colorful letters and they got a little Park this is like a roundabout there in the middle of the city and we stopped on the way up and uh we got got our picture made there but uh Tonga and uh to uh I can't remember there were several cities but we went into and they all had the same same thing there's all of us together and uh and then we were up at brother elise's church that night preaching and there's brother Elise standing up in the over by the wall and I got to meet brother uh margarito and brother uh nect that night and that's a really just a real Precious group of people up there and uh brother Lise told me he said brother he said I could tell you was tired and I was like I was cuz I preached Sunday morning and then you drive three three and a half hours and you try to preach at night I was already I was already tired when I got there and uh but it was it was a really a great service I I think the Lord really blessed it and uh it was it was a blessing to me so uh and then here's here's so there's brother margarito in the in the in the glasses and then brother edras and then brother Eli standing next to me and Manuel and then that's brother Nick and brother Louise all ministers so brother nect is a pastor and then brother Eli has the church there and really he's really he's an evangelist but he's pastoring that church because they don't have anybody and then brother margarito and uh brother margarito is a character you uh you meet him and uh you'll never forget him he's a he's he's a real comical guy and he's a just a real Precious brother and I really just had a great time getting to get to meet them and know all them but this that brother Le house that night after service we got to got to Fellowship meet and uh the brother over there in the blue shirt that's brother Edgar Edgardo Rivera and I didn't know who he was when we got there at brother Lee's Church before church I didn't know who anybody was and I met him and this brother come up to me he grinned he spoke Spanish to me he greeted me like he' knew me forever and I didn't know who I didn't know what he said or what or or what but he was he was a wonderful brother and I was thinking maybe he's related to him you know I thought maybe that's a family member or something and brother Lis said no that's brother Ed Edgardo and brother Edgardo is a is a songwriter and a singer and I didn't I didn't know anything about him but I found out a lot about him and uh he's kind of like the Leno y or the uh uh brother uh paulon Fontaine of the Spanish speaking countries he's taken a lot of wrote a lot of message songs in Spanish and uh when he travels man people really respond to him he's he's just a precious brother but we got to spend some time with him he went with us all the way to the ministers meeting and everything and uh but uh he Lo he loves the Lord and he's just a real Precious brother and we had a great time and then the next day we were headed back and uh brother Lee and his family's in and this is Brother Lee's Truck and we're just everybody's packed in there and they're hauling all the stuff back because they're coming from the mountains they're coming to Tonga and they spent the night and all brothers were going to the ministers meeting so we're headed south from the north so everybody's packed up and they're all headed back but U that was it was a good good time fellowship and really just really precious and uh this is this is a picture I wanted to show everybody when you when you get up in the northern part of Honduras um it's lot of pine trees a lot of mountains and I showed picture people pictures that I've got and uh you'd be amazed that cuz I was thinking this is like uh looks like Georgia or North Carolina or anything like that because people were asking me where these pictures were and I showed them and said this is all Honduras and people couldn't believe that you know and so on our way back this is one of the this is a this is a department right Alano is a department so there's they're kind of like counties in Honduras the C but they call them departments and uh so I was showing this one and we all stopped got a picture made Sarah wanted me to let everybody know cuz she didn't she didn't realize that at first that's bullet holes because of the uh because of the drug traffic in that area uh they use that for target practice and all that all that's riddle that's all you know metal uh letters and this hole riddled with bullet holes but uh you know they people didn't realize what that was but um it was a nice place and uh I put this one in there for one reason sister Chris likes to take photos and videos of people that you don't know she's I had to wait because I didn't have WiFi so I had to wait till I got to WiFi and then I would go to the WhatsApp to find out exactly what Sister Christine had posted cuz I didn't know what was going on so it was it was always it was always a new thing because I was like well I know I'm going to be on there but I don't know what what she posted so anyway we were driving back and they were asleep and I was like hey look here I got I got a picture of y'all but uh yeah it was it was really a good Tri uh brother brother nect one of the pastors he has a store we stopped by his store and uh got to got to see them and the some of the family and it was uh got something to drink and and all that and fellowship with them and then brother nect wanted to show us his church and there's that's brother nct's church and uh it's a really really nice built church and really uh Lord really bless them and this is the inside of the church and uh beautiful church and he built they built the the benches and the pull Pit and the pull pit has a carved eagle on the front of it and uh I told Brother Lis I said Brother Gary CR would have loved that place because that man he is a he is a he's a Craftsman when it comes to uh being a carpenter he said his dad was a carpenter he really done a wonderful job on the pull pit and everything was beautiful but I wanted to show this one also uh just about Church you go to you always find the seven Church ages and the statue of a perfect man is almost in every church we went to they had both of those up in in the pull pit and and almost every church has a picture of the Hoffman's head of Christ and brother Brandon with a pillar of fire over his head almost all of them have that kind of set up and sometimes it's not behind the pull pit sometimes it's to the side but usually you if you go to around the pull pits you'll usually find all those pictures but um so we made it back um this was Tuesday morning and I wanted to show you some of the food Tuesday morning we because we got back Monday night and I got woke up real early uh Tuesday morning brother Eric come knocked on the door and he asked me said uh do you want to preach on the on the TV and I had to think a minute what he said you want to preach on the TV I was like well um I guess so and he he said brother Lucas has got a TV show and he preaches on the local channel he asked me he said do you want to go preach and I said well you talk to Brother Louis I said sure and I'm thinking okay I just woke up and we got to be leaving in like 25 minutes or something so we headed down there and uh what happened was uh they had a bucks accident and I think there was 68 people on the bus and 13 of them were killed and because of the news uh was doing live coverage of the accident we weren't able to get on the news Ed but brother L Lucas took us to to a restaurant to eat and uh so this is this was breakfast and uh eat a lot of plantains and and I I really enjoyed that plantains and beans and avocado and uh scrambled eggs and that's ham that's Ham on the plate and uh it's very thin sort of crispy and that white stuff right there they they say it's cheese they they say that white the white not the round stuff but that squ squ looking rectangle there they say that's cheese I think I think that's white that right there that cheese is the that that's like trying to eat a bullon cube to me that was the saltiest stuff I ever put in my mouth and they they like this soft mild like like Feta cheese we we had some of that which is good cheese but man I took a bite of that and I was like I can't eat this and but uh lots of times their meals are they scrambled eggs with with beans and cheese with a with with cheese like that and uh but that was the saltiest stuff I ever put in my mouth and I just I had a hard time trying to and but a lot the food was good people always ask me um everything was good I I was really um I I love some of their food over there and just it was really good this is this is at brother Eric's house and there's Robert his oldest son and they're and the little tank is a little tank where they where they store their water and uh right there on the back side of the house and his his mom and dad live there and this this is where his house is but uh I just wanted to show you U kind of where we were at and uh this is uh us traveling from a Tuesday morning we we got up went to the air the uh TV station and sat around for a while and got to fellowship with brother Lucas and them and then that afternoon we left headed for San Lorenzo and this is a this is a trap com uh the trip coming down to the ministers meeting and uh it's a long long trip but uh we got to see a lot of things and um you know if if you've never been overseas and and seen the the traveling that that some of the areas that you got to travel in it's like when I went to Jamaica and you know it's like you hit potholes and you know we think potholes are just little things that shake your veh vehicle and then you there's potholes that the whole car goes into and uh that's that's the kind of roads that we were there were you know you see but what's amazing like in Jamaica you hit these big holes and it's like the whole car goes in the but in in Honduras the the difference is when you're in Honduras the the roads where the whole car goes in then you come out of this ditch this Gully and they have speed bumps there were roads that I mean um for those of for those of you that have been on the Father's Day fishing trip when we used to go up to low gap and go go camping out there that's the kind of roads and and I asked one of the brothers asked me said you ever been on a road like this and I was like yeah this is when we go camping or hunting or something like this these are not roads that connect cities together but that's that's the kind of roads and uh you know it's it's just you you sometimes you just pray it's it's amazing that their their cars stay together but uh this is this is the ministers meeting uh Wednesday this Wednesday morning when we got to the and uh I didn't want but Sister Christine being being the friend that she is she kept telling me how hot it's going to be how hot it's going to be how hot it's going to be and I didn't want anybody I just block that out of my mind but she wanted me to know and it was hot as as she said it was going to be he's like 95 every day heat index over a 100 and church starts at 9:00 in the morning they have three services have one at 900 and one at 2: and and the only thing that we had was we were not inside the building the ministers a lot of the ministers they packed in there and that's very hot and some of them Brothers come out and their shirts are just soaking wet but we sat on the outside right here and uh we sat in these chairs outside and praise the Lord uh it we did we did have they had fans blowing inside the church but we had a little bit of a breeze every now and then it was it was really welcome to have that breeze bleow past you cuz it was really scorching but and then the eating area is right back there in the backs where they and then the and the cooking area is just to the left of that and those sisters they were there I think I think they stayed there all the time I don't think they ever left they just cooked all the time it was and then they had some of the young sisters they were in there cleaning up at night but uh it was they done excellent job I I my hats off to them they were really I I pray for them it was just a real blessing to to see them and all these brothers they they travel from all around Honduras and some of the other countries and man they get together and uh it was hot and they were and you know this is not their this is not their uh summer and I was like I don't want to be here in the summertime yeah I'll let y'all handle that but it was it was wonderful to be there and the fellowship with these brothers and uh when we got there uh Tuesday night when we were there uh brother pacco who's one one of the minister he's an evangelist there and he and he uh he's a uh he goes he's a missionary he goes out and and goes into the jungles and and visits the U Indians and stuff but he welcomed me there Tuesday night at the at the the meeting so the ministers have this meeting and then just beyond the tent on the other side is they have a big tent set up and at night everybody's welcome and they have the different brothers that come and and preach and brother Paco preached Tuesday night and they welcomed me there and he told me brother Aaron was there and then I had people coming up to me started talking I didn't have no idea what they were saying so I tried to find somebody and they finally found I think brother Luis or brother Eric somebody interpreted for me and come to find out brother Aaron mcari had been there 20 years ago and preach and when they said brother Aaron was here they they got me mixed up with brother Aaron McGary and I and I told him I said obviously y'all don't remember what brother Aaron looked like I was like because one of us is significantly well I wouldn't say significantly noticeably taller than the other one one of one of us one of us is a little bit uh there's there's a noticeable difference in size and and height but uh yeah they they want to know if I was the if I was the brother Aaron and I was like no there's a difference but uh the they were really precious Brothers I I really enjoyed it and U there was a the brother with sitting with his back to you there on the far left of the of the screen brother that's brother Santos I believe is his brother's name and uh brother Santos is like 70 years old and he's still going rides on a motorcycle and he he is just still going out and evangelizing he's an evangelist and nothing slows that man down and uh brother Lis was talking about it several two years ago something like that he can probably tell you more about it but brother Santos was in a in a motorcycle wreck and didn't break a bone he just got scratched up just a little bit motorcyc motorcycle fell on him and uh but he uh I was he's uh he sent out a letter I got the letter give it to all the pastors they're they're raising money to build another church in a Chula and I I give brother Santos I just you know always always real careful about giving money to people about for different things and and I talk brother Eric brother Eric said brother if you want to give him money you feel led you can give him some money so I gave him I gave him some am all I had was American money but I gave him some and I told Brother I walked up to brother Santos he was by himself it was just me and him and I walked up to him and I told I was pointing to the letters that he had and I told him I said elaia and I give him the money and he said elcia I said see and then so he counted the money and it just he broke down and I thought he was going to squeeze me so hard I was going to stop breathing but he just stood there and just praise the Lord amen and so y'all y'all remember them I know there's people that you know they need a lot of help over there and and so we just give them a down payment and maybe the Lord find somebody else to help just put all together and you know everybody's I heard one of the brothers that was talking about trying to find people to just give a certain amount a certain amount you know if we just had 10 people to give an X number of dollars I was like we just you know if everybody just give a little bit of something you know just a small amount brother bisco was talking about if just everybody just gives a small portion we don't need because brother Bisal said one time that he said the most faithful that he saw was the people that didn't make a lot of money but they were the most faithful and given to the missions and it's not the not the ones that have great deal of money you'd think they would be the ones giving the most but he said I've seen people that just barely get by but the Lord's always blessed them to be because they're so faithful and putting money into the into the the missions and I was like well we just give them a little bit and then uh the Lord just blessed cuz that's all it takes to just give him a little bit and he'll take the rest just like he done the fishes and the loaves it just takes a little bit and uh we were in San Lorenzo and this this right here is is a lifesaver and I don't I I I don't I just I just you just can't say enough about this this is purified water you can't drink the water there but there's a lot of purified water but the what's nice about this right here this is cold this comes in a bag and so they come in a little bag about this big and it comes in a plastic bag a clear plastic bag about the size of 5 G bucket and you get a lot of water over there that's not cold but those right there almost always were cold and I I appreciate the Lord that was that was a real blessing and uh if you could get your hands on one of them and uh people just take them and you just tear the corner off of them and you just suck suck all the water out of it and that was that was a that was a lifesaver it's so hot you're just sweltering and if somebody will bring you one of those bags right there I've seen I've seen the brothers sitting in the in the in the ministers meetings and some of those Brothers they took them and they would just sit there in the church and they'd have them sit on the back of their necks like this the whole time they were just sitting there trying to cool off but I tell you what that was a that was a blessing to have and uh I was sitting I was sitting out here one and the and the deacons would sit out here and you see there's some of the brothers and they stand in the doorway and they stand around and they brought me water I sit out there and I would just take I had handkerchiefs and I would just wipe and sweat all the time those Brothers bring me bottles of water and uh I can't remember if it was if it was Wednesday morning or Thursday morning Wednesday Wednesday morning brother Eric asked me he said why is it that they bring you water and they don't bring me any I said because you're supposed to be used to this because you're from here I said they feel sorry for the Gringo I said the deacons are bring now that was it was room temperature water but let me tell you what it was nice to have it and uh brother Lis said I wasn't supposed to add this but I told him I said if if I'm going to say anything I'm going to talk about the truth and this and this is truth right here uh this this was Thursday morning Wes Wednesday morning that's right this is Wednesday praise the Lord let me tell you what when it's hot and I'm talking about hot you sweating and we we told the brothers that we're going to go get some we went bought some Cokes and some Waters at the store went down to the convenience store but brother Lis said brother there is a Wendy's within sight and he said let's go get a Frosty and I and I didn't argue with him about that it's like yes brother I I got your Revelation let's go so here we are and it don't taste like our frosties it tastes like soft serve ice cream but let me tell you what it was chocolate and it was cold and it was [Music] good and so that that was that was our that was our our you know the you know the rock in a weary land so that was a place and that uh we we got a little bit of a break brother lis had not felt good and I know Bella and and them hadn't and I think Zoe hadn't felt good either and we were just really holding them up in prayer and you know they just kept going on and uh I know brother Luis didn't feel like it and brother hoel come and told him that this is at he come and told you at supper time so he only had like an hour or so before the night service and brother hoel come and told him said brother he said we want you to preach tonight and you could just tell brother L like Lord I need some help tonight but I tell you what brother Louise if they they have that video and I wish somebody could interpret that and put subtitles or something on that because brother Eric interpreted for me that night and let me tell you something that brother brother Lise that night that brother preached and I I told him I said I know what God called you to do he called you to preach to the the Hispanic people cuz that brother right there he done an excellent job that night Wednesday night I had to I had to wait on the interpretation but I still I still got into the the end of the sermon it moved me and I was I I was really blessed and I told Brother Luis afterward because I know he was wore out and he had not he had not felt good but he really pressed through that night thank you Lord and we were standing out by the tent that night and I told Brother Lis I saidou my hero go man he really done he' really done something he really yielded himself that night and it was really it was really good it really blessed me and uh so there's a picture of the tent and uh you know the Latin countries they all the women sat on one side and all the men sat on the other all the churches and but they really it was it was really a blessing to to be with them and and there's brother Edgardo and he's just he's just wonderful to be around brother BR said you know there's some people you just you just love to be around you just you know you just and that's the way brother Edgardo is he just you don't speak the language and and but we done the best we could at understanding each other uh when we had time we used Google translate but he's but he he's just and when when he so he he let sing in Wednesday night at the tent as soon as he comes out even little kids everybody's got their phones videotaping him and everybody wants to come shake his hand and hug him and uh have their picture made with him and he's just he's just really giving and people have a lot of regard for him and uh he heard he was in Africa and he heard the song We Sing there's no one There's No One Like Jesus there's no one there's no one like him he took that song and he translated it to Spanish and they sing it and uh we got to hear them and then uh brother Paco and we got to see brother uh Paco and uh brother Louise at the Youth Camp they got up and were uh doing the dancing they got up because they were and uh because brother Paco he don't stay in one spot and uh but they they had a real good time but he's done he's done a lot of uh traveling and um just just a really precious brother and I really I was really honored to spend my time with him and amen on uh Thursday night on the after I I preached Thursday night at the at the Min at the ministers meeting the the night service and I we stopped by a convenience store and we got sandwiches and stuff on the way home and and I told him I said I got to write this on my calendar I got to buy brother Edgardo a a sandwich and a cup of coffee so I ain't always say I've done that for him but here's brother Lis and I preaching Thursday night they come and as they come and told me at lunchtime that day and brother Eric told me said because brother Luis preached Wednesday night and brother Eric told me saidou probably going to be preaching tomorrow night and brother hoel come and told me at lunchtime he said brother they going to preach you preach tonight so so we preached Thursday night and I took my took the sermon out of Isaiah 61 he said and he a point unto them talking about Beauty for Ashes the allil of joy for mourning and what God give us he gave us all those things he appointed them all unto us and uh I think it was a real blessing to the people and uh so Friday Friday morning uh we got back early Friday morning then Friday night brother Lis wasn't feeling well so I went to uh Lia it's a little town not too far from Brother uh Eric's and I got to preach for brother Lucas the brother that has does the TV show and that's brother Lucas's Church there and uh I got to got to preach there Friday night and then ask brother Lucas

this is at the Youth Camp here and uh getting ready to preach Saturday morning so I preach Thursday night Friday night Saturday morning and Sunday morning and uh this is at the youth camp and if you saw any of the videos you'll notice that uh there's a pull pit or there a platform behind me and brother Luis right there but uh it was it was not built for for me um the other brothers would stand up there in the in the platform the pull pit and everything would move and I told Brother Lis ain't no way neither one of us going to get on that thing I didn't have faith anyway to to do that so I didn't have faith for both of us to stand up there so so I told him I said we can we put the plat the pull pit down there so we we sat down there at the front but uh had a wonderful time there and there's brother Paco and uh some of y'all may remember remember brother Paco brother Paco used to live in Alabama used to go brother Homer Longoria's Church many years ago and uh the Lord had been dealing with him for a number of years to go back to Honduras and work and the Lord was calling him to do a work over there and he didn't respond and he was uh just waiting and the Lord knows what he's doing he just canceled brother Paco's visa and sent him back to Honduras so he's like well that's how the Lord gets your attention to do the work amen but he preached so he preached Tuesday at the ministers meeting Tuesday night and he preached Friday night at the youth camp and brother Paco is just a really precious brother and they really they really go when uh him and brother elely and and the different ones they really go and go to the jungles and different places and man they really have a desire for to get the word out and uh so um this is some of the sisters that were at the Youth Camp that done the cooking some of them and these and you um I I just can't give enough praise these sisters they really worked hard I mean some times I think they were there at 4:00 in the morning and they really worked hard I mean they had a lot going on and uh they they really put a lot into what they do and they really worked hard and you just can't give them enough so I want to include that and uh this is at the at the youth camp and that's where they were cooking out underneath that canopy there next to the red brick wall there and that's where they and they sat underneath that canopy to the left and that's where the that's where the picnic tables that's where they were eating at and on I think it was Friday was it Friday night Saturday one of the nights right there where that tent is all the way back to the left as far as you go they just had tables lined up they didn't even have a cover over them they just had them out and they were just rows and rows and rows of tables they were just people everywhere and those sisters they just cooked all the time and uh man you just you just uh can't give them enough enough praise enough credit they really they really

work that went on and you just can't you just can't tell you know it was hard to put into words but I really appreciate all of the work they they really worked really hard and uh you know everybody talks about just the ministers coming and I always talk about they put a lot of uh emphasis on the word which we do but you know you can't you can't Minister and you can't have a a a any kind of Camp you can't have meetings because there takes so many people behind the scenes it takes finances and it takes people that that you know that don't get any credit but I mean they I mean they slave they

everybody has gifts and you know at all you know the Apostle Paul said you know there's helps and governments in the Bible in the Bible you know the body all and so we all have to work together am and uh this was Sunday Sunday morning I drove from so brother Noel come picked me up and uh I didn't know where I was going from one day to the next I didn't know where I was going to be preaching I didn't I didn't know all I told Brother Eric was I I told him I said will you just tell me you know what time I need to be ready and who's taking me and you just and he would just because it was kind of fluid sometimes about where you going to be at and I told him I said brother I'm just here I said you just tell me what you want me to do and uh you know that's that's that's just my job and I'm I'm just here just to be a help and uh so you just tell me what what and so he would just tell me brother they coming to get you at a certain time and you're going and so brother Noel was a really precious brother I I really enjoyed my time with him and uh he's got two his mom's an American citizen I got I got to meet her and uh she doesn't speak a lot of English but she's an American citizen and two of her children go to brother Mike Wall's church and brother Noel when he lived in the United States he was in in Maryland so he speaks pretty good English and uh but he come and got me and he was just a precious brother and uh the doors open up everywhere just so many people that want to come and help you brother Noel he drives a cab and and does different things he said tell he said brother he said if you need to come he said you just call me ahead of time tell me you're coming and he said we'll take you wherever he said I'll work on getting my schedule changed and if the doors open up he said you just let me know he said I'll come travel for you he said I'll interpret for you just wherever you wherever you need me you just let me know and and it's just amazing and uh amen it's just how giving they are and you know they don't want to take gas money from you they don't want to take money for you for nothing because they feel like this they're doing God's work you come and you know even the first time I tried to give brother Eric money you know he kind of kind of was a resistant and I was like well brother they give me this money to give to y'all I said it's not my money I said people give me money to give to y'all to to help y'all so this is Brother beckin Church in k k is that right cananas and that means the singing frogs singing frogs that's the name of the name of the town and uh so this is this is me and brother Noel interpreting and uh everybody asked me said why is he got a green screen and they is that the true color of the of the church I said yes it's a green screen it's green well I didn't realize till later but when when they do that they he changes the back the backdrop of the church because he's using a green screen so he puts different things on there but uh I preached on I preached on the sound of the abundance of rain that that Sunday morning and uh I was talking about you know because of the Judgment that come upon Israel you know God told Elijah that they was going to stop the rain but he had you know Elijah went to to the brook and then he prepared a widow woman to come and God brought the word to that widow woman woman to sustain her and you know I was I was talking about that widow woman and giving out of her out of her lack and of all of of her need and yet she gave to the prophet to to help and because she obeyed the word and she was blessed and then after the service was over with brother beckon was telling me that his grandmother was the first one to he hear the message and she was a young Widow and she had I think four or five children and had very little to do had very little means but she wanted to have a place that they could hear the word preached and she saved up her money didn't tell anybody but she saved up her money and had a little church area built right above where brother beckon church is and it was just a little place and it's called the house of prayer and brother Melco from toosi gulpa and some of the other brothers they come and dedicated so the ministers could come and preach the message to them in that area and what struck me was I was preaching about that widow woman out of her out of her need God come and sustained her because she she obeyed the word the word come to her and she obeyed the word and not even thinking about it till later brother beckon was tell me the story about his grandmother and I was like man isn't that amazing that that God gave me that to preach that morning amen and it test you know it was just the testimony just like his grandmother and brother beckon is like a year younger than me but they are just wonderful people and this is the church this most of the church people and most of them are family and there's brother beckon standing next to me and then his wife is standing just to the to his uh the picture would be just to his right there and uh brother beckon everywhere I went I told him I said everybody wants everybody told me to send their love and greetings to each one of y'all we send our love and not only just our church but many churches here in the United States have been praying for these meetings and these services for us to come and and brother beckon wanted me to let y'all know that he sends his love and greetings to y'all also and they are just wonderful people and uh they just everybody wants you to come back and when you when you get a chance to come but uh just to see what God has done and I was telling brother beckon I didn't get to tell everybody but we had Fellowship after church and I was telling brother beckon about our church and having the number of people with my family my mom grandmother when brother brandom's meetings and the different ones from our church have been brother banham's meetings and you know anointed ones at the end time brother Brams mentioned Gainesville Georgia and the different ones and uh brother George and brother Tatum and them singing on the brother Mo singing on the the the six seal and just and uh I told him I really appreciate the Legacy that we have at our church that amen what God has done in this little place amen and we're really blessed people amen and but there there really really precious people there that we able to got to go and uh so um that was Sunday morning then we come back and this is what Sunday night brother Lis is preaching but the the the mid service on Sunday they had the uh the youth service and brother uh well I can't remember what service it was but uh they had the in the youth service they they had one time they had the uh small groups and brother Paco was preaching one night and he was asking them about different things about the message and was asking them questions and the young people were having is you know struggling trying to answer some of the questions and so they had these uh little small grp group sessions and some of the young ministers that were there they took each group and they broke up uh why do we why do we baptize in in the name of Jesus by immersion and why are we not a denomination and they took different topics and you know they just kind of broke it all down and and I thought brother Lis done a really good job this was the last service and he was and he was talking about Revelation 10 Revelation 5 and and the opening of the seals and the word and and I I thought brother Lis done a real good job trying to break it down for the young people for them to understand because you got to see this this message come for you and this word's got to open to you and it's not just something that took place in 1963 that happened to brother brandham but you got to see that the word the opening of the word is for you and you've got to see the word open to you just as John you know because John we but see when John was able to see his name in the book that was a revelation to him that wasn't nobody else's Revelation that was John seeing his name seeing Redemption and see brother Bram had the same experience the word had to open to him to see that you know when brother Bram standing there and said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand not their stand but he saw that the lamb was there opening the word it was a revelation to him and it was really I thought it was really good brother Luis done a great job that night and and try to get the people the young people you got to have this Revelation for yourself you got to have where the and so I thought it was good some of this some of the young people that were there this is uh brother hson and sister Danielle and they're just really precious people he speaks some English and he wanted ever he met me and he just wanted to speak English to me and practice his English and and he's just a really precious brother and uh he texts me all the time on WhatsApp and I've already got I've already got a message from him while I've been up preaching he's already texting me he just a precious brother just has a real desire and some more of the young people and they just and that's brother Steven Cruz from Nicaragua and he was one of my interpreters and uh he just just really precious then brother hael and uh just a wonderful musician these people these these young people they just really have a desire for the Lord and they just really touch your heart and uh it it's hard to talk about them because these they really get get a hold of your heart and I just thank the Lord for and uh and this is brother hoell and this brother right here he's famous because he got coffee

little bit of of some of the of of Honduras but it was it it I took away a whole lot from there and they you know they they struggle there there's a lot that that they don't have but I tell you what one of the things they do have is they have faith and I I really I really appreciate them and their response to the word they it really it really was a blessing to me and and I I thank the Lord and brother Neil son you know he he's asked me to come and to Nicaragua and some of the uh some of the young people asked me when you come to Nicaragua you come to Honduras when you come to Nicaragua and I was like well when the Lord opens the doors but I I thank the Lord for this opportunity and it's been it's been 18 I think 18 years it's right before Levi was born when we were in we went to Jamaica and uh they they don't want it to be that long before I go somewhere else but the Lord just really blessed and I appreciate the Lord I appreciate all of y'all and being attentive today and I hope it's been a it's been a blessing to you and there's so many more picture you know there's so much stuff and I'm just trying to pack everything into in a in a short period of time but I just hope it's a it just gives you a glimpse of of what we saw and the and the PE I wish I you know y'all could I could really convey to you what it meant to be there and these people but you know we're all one in in Christ and you know that's what's so wonderful is the is the word is what unifies us together we're all baptized into one body and and I just appreciate all them and you know we all have the we all fight the same devil you know they over there they're fighting the same thing you know we've got believe the sign and everybody walking away from the message and calling brother Bram a false prophet and and you know Saturday morning when brother Eric he wanted us to cover the things that we believe what are the things that we believe in the message and one of the things I covered s Saturday morning the Lord just laid on my heart as I got up I took the life of the Apostle Paul I said here was a man that was by his own testimony was a blasphemer and a murderer and when it come time that God Called Paul into the Ministry called him into the into the mess into the word was bringing him into the kingdom of God and when he come to that place God told ananas to go pray for Saul because I've got a work for him to do and ananas is like you want me to go pray for him and I told him I said tell me anybody that you've ever seen anybody in in the scripture that God didn't use that there wasn't controversy in their life everybody there's always look look I told him I said Jesus said you talking to the Pharisees said you polish the tombs of the prophets and your fathers are the one that put them there why because they did not they rejected the word of God what they brother R said that they hated Elijah when he told them that they were not going to have any rain for three and a half years he said there wouldn't be and he said they hated him and he said what was the reason he said it wasn't Elijah he said it was because the people had turned down the word they turned their back on God and judgment came but it was just him bringing the word and I was like the same thing we see today they've turned the word down and now they're receiving judgment that's what brother brandham come to do he come to tie up the loose sins but that was what he come to bring back because the Judgment of God was coming Pentecost had walked away from the from the foundation that came on isua street they had walked away from that and that's what that's what the prophet came to do was to is to bring judgment amen but it's a fulfillment of God's word amen and just like Paul you know he come to fulfill those things but Paul stood there and said if if an angel preaches anything different than what I've already said they said let them be a cursed you know it's the same we've we' received that same Ministry amen right God done the same thing in our day yes we've had a we've had a prophet in our day that come and brought the word opened up and it wasn't it wasn't brother brandom that done it it was Jesus Christ that came in the last days to open the word to us and I told him I said you know whether anybody else believes or not that's what I believe that's what's real to me and you know I you can't convince some people of anything and that's all right but I'll give you I I'll give you an answer for the hope that lies within me and that's all you can do am amen well God bless you this evening we'll have the musicians come we're going let's all stand and I hope I didn't we you out and uh I it's kind of hard because you got so much that you want to say and I just trying to what was it the they said brevity is the soul of wit and uh some I told him that when I preach sometimes when I got when I was in Honduras I told him I said I'm sorry that I preached so long that uh I said sometimes we feel like we're Eternal and uh and I that was one thing I always tried to do was like Saturday morning I I got and I told Brother Lis you know we've only got so much time because we've got other things going on that day and because of breakfast and different things they had a late start and so I just I just put 55 minutes on my phone and I and I I told Brother Lis I said we got a whole lot to ground to cover we going we're going to try to do everything we can because we got 55 minutes to get this and I just you know just and the and the problem is is when you get over there brother Elie when he preached he preached a solid hour and the man you know he don't ever seem like he takes a break he just goes goes goes and then brother Lis they done a great job and I told him I said I got to wait on y'all to interpret everything one I forgot what night it was they they uh it was at the tent Thursday night when I preached at the tent one of the brothers came up to said brother you preached two hours I said no I did not I said I preached one hour and I said Lise done the rest y I only covered so much I said the rest of it was brother Lis talking but they were they're just really precious people and and y'all just continue to hold them up in prayer and you know it's you know we we pray for the bride you know we pray for the bride around the world there's so many of them that have needs but it's something different when they when they come up to you those Brothers come up to you and they hug you you know they tell you they love you and they and they appreciate you and it just you know when you start putting names and faces together you know it it's something different there's there's something about that Fellowship together but you know I just told him I said if I don't see you on this side anymore I said we're going to see you one the one of these this great morning there's a great morning where we're all going to get together and I said we won't ever have to worry about having language problems there won't be it won't be any more everybody trying to find an interpreter said we'll understand we'll all understand because we'll all have
