[0:00] never heard that before have
[0:01] you all right we are live so we've been
[0:05] going that's Bob's brother yeah this is
[0:07] my brother if y'all hadn't met being
[0:09] before younger baby brother small
[0:15] child special guest he's the baby yeah
[0:17] Special he's
[0:23] special so we have been going through
[0:25] the Beatitudes and we are on the blessed
[0:28] are the p and heart they shall see God
[0:31] and last time we kind of started going
[0:33] through uh we we
[0:37] reviewed blessed are the poor in spirit
[0:39] we we I'm just kind of quickly go over
[0:41] these um blessed are the poor in spirit
[0:44] for those is the Kingdom of Heaven
[0:46] blessed are that the mor blessed are the
[0:48] Meek um and we're blessed are the pure
[0:51] in heart for they shall see God and we
[0:52] talked about being pure in heart is
[0:54] having uh pure motives not anything to
[0:59] uh not Desiring your own motives not
[1:02] Desiring to to things of the world like
[1:05] uh we talked about people that desire or
[1:07] you know preachers that desire money or
[1:10] things like that and they're they're not
[1:11] motivated by Purity then when God comes
[1:13] in and fills you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:15] he cleanses you and begins to uh begins
[1:19] to open the word to
[1:21] you and um shall seek God and you know
[1:25] brother Ram talked about in uh many
[1:28] sermons about show us the father and
[1:30] it'll suffice us and and uh many sermons
[1:34] that he preached he he walked down this
[1:36] U how we can see God in his Universe in
[1:40] his word in his son and then in his
[1:44] people and we kind of talked about last
[1:47] time how you can see God in the the in
[1:50] everything around you in the universe
[1:52] when you look up at the stars at night
[1:53] you can see God and the Ancients when
[1:56] they would look up into the sky they
[1:57] would they would be aware of one star
[2:00] that was out of place if any if anything
[2:03] was
[2:04] abnormal then uh something they knew
[2:08] something uh was they they could
[2:11] identify it and I I believe that's how
[2:13] we should be when we're we're reading
[2:15] the word when we're we're studying if if
[2:18] everything should be just perfectly fall
[2:21] in line because there's not you know
[2:26] when you're reading God's word and you
[2:27] think one thing is out of place and it
[2:29] doesn't tie together it all fits
[2:31] together like a perfect puzzle amen
[2:33] everything if if there's if you got the
[2:35] the uh like that story brother R told
[2:37] about about the puzzle the painting if
[2:40] you got the cow in the sky or the clouds
[2:43] on the ground or something it's not
[2:45] right and that's how the Ancients looked
[2:47] up in this the night sky and they could
[2:49] see that story the story of that we now
[2:52] read in our Bible told in the
[2:55] stars and this whole story is told this
[2:58] this uh God revealing himself is told in
[3:02] John 1 so let's turn to Big John 1 and
[3:08] um kind of look at how John expresses
[3:11] this condescending down from God in his
[3:14] Universe God in his word God and his son
[3:16] and then God and his
[3:20] people and this this whole story is is
[3:23] the the idea behind it is God wanted
[3:26] himself to be known that when you read
[3:29] your word and you think well uh sometime
[3:32] I remember just in my Christian
[3:34] experience you kind of get frustrated
[3:36] sometimes and I can't understand this
[3:38] but God just rest knowing that God is is
[3:42] God will open it up to you if you keep
[3:45] if you're patient and you're diligent
[3:48] and keep
[3:49] studying now John 1
[3:53] one oh I'm on first John I was actually
[3:57] going to go
[3:58] there
[4:10] in the beginning was the word and the
[4:12] Word was with God and the Word was God
[4:15] and that that's talking about God
[4:17] revealing himself because he wanted to
[4:19] be made known he wanted us to see him
[4:21] and the only way for us to see him is
[4:23] for him to be made manifest in his son
[4:26] that brother Brown talked about that
[4:28] little Loos that came spinning out out
[4:30] back in the beginning and uh in the Old
[4:33] Testament remember when uh the the king
[4:36] of the Babylon was it darus or uh the
[4:38] one that when the four Hebrew children
[4:40] were cast Into the Fire he looked down
[4:42] and he said uh the three Hebrew children
[4:44] he said I see four in there and one of
[4:46] them is like the Son of God because he
[4:48] knew even he knew that if I could see
[4:51] God it would have to be the son right to
[4:54] make manifest God the same was in the
[4:57] beginning with God all things were made
[5:00] by him and without him was not anything
[5:02] made that was made we know that we
[5:05] talked about the how the four gospels
[5:06] present Jesus in Christ in four
[5:09] different ways and and John presents him
[5:11] as John the eagle presents him as God
[5:14] this whole gospel is presenting God
[5:17] Jesus as not just somebody that was born
[5:20] in a manger but he was from the
[5:24] beginning all things were made by him
[5:26] when you look up in the night sky now I
[5:29] think it's is interesting that when you
[5:30] look up into the night sky there's not
[5:31] one star that you can see that's not in
[5:33] the Milky Way think consider how big how
[5:36] vast the universe is with your naked eye
[5:39] you can only perceive the stars that are
[5:41] in in the Milky Way then you when you
[5:43] open up a telescope when you look
[5:46] through a telescope you can begin to see
[5:48] things that are even beyond our galaxy
[5:51] and God just open he continuously opens
[5:53] up his word when when you look through
[5:56] the eyes of the Prophet this prophet's
[5:58] message you can see out so so far
[6:01] through that eagle
[6:02] anointing in him was life and the life
[6:06] and the life was the light of men and
[6:09] the light shineth in darkness and the
[6:12] Darkness comprehended it not there was a
[6:15] man sent from John sent from God whose
[6:18] name was John the same for witness to
[6:20] Bear witness of the light that all men
[6:23] through him might believe he was not
[6:25] that light but was sent to Bear witness
[6:27] of that light that was the True Light
[6:30] which lith every man that cometh into
[6:32] the
[6:33] world and uh just all through scripture
[6:37] you see types of Light how in the
[6:39] beginning when in in creation when God
[6:42] first the world was in darkness speaking
[6:44] of uh that you can see your own
[6:46] Christian experience in the Genesis 1
[6:48] creation how first you were in darkness
[6:50] and then God uh brought light and
[6:53] separated the light from the darkness in
[6:56] your life and and and then John came to
[7:02] testify that the light this light was
[7:05] coming that he knew it was coming and
[7:07] and uh moving on down then we are lights
[7:12] that should not be hid under a bushel
[7:14] that God put his light in
[7:16] us that was the True Light which lith
[7:19] every man that come cometh into the
[7:20] world he was in the world and the world
[7:23] was by him and the world knew him not
[7:25] because they couldn't see him they
[7:26] weren't looking for him they couldn't
[7:28] perceive him he came unto his own and
[7:30] his own received him not but as many as
[7:33] received him to them gave he power to
[7:35] become the sons of God even to them that
[7:38] believe on his name which were born not
[7:40] of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[7:42] nor of the will of man but of God and
[7:45] the
[7:46] word the word was made flesh and dwelt
[7:49] among us and we beheld his glory the
[7:51] glory is of the only begotten of the
[7:53] father full of grace and truth brother
[7:56] Brown talked about how you can see God
[7:59] in word when you read your the Bible and
[8:02] uh you agree with the word believe it
[8:04] what the word says then you can rest on
[8:06] that and know that God will bring it to
[8:08] pass like Exodus 15:26 I am the Lord
[8:10] that Health thee and all the promises
[8:13] throughout the scripture about God being
[8:16] Our Redeemer and and the promise that
[8:18] this this promise is to us and to our
[8:21] children not just to us that we can rest
[8:23] on those promises
[8:27] because God is in his word to fulfill
[8:38] it John bear witness of him and cried
[8:42] saying this was he of whom I
[8:47] speak he that cometh after me is
[8:50] preferred before me for he was before me
[8:54] not just he didn't begin just at the
[8:57] manger but he was before me he was he he
[9:00] he was the beginning of he he you know
[9:03] he was the beginning the Alpha and the
[9:05] Omega and of his fullness have we have
[9:07] all we received and Grace for grace for
[9:10] the law was given by Moses but Grace and
[9:12] Truth came by Jesus Christ no man ha
[9:15] seen God at any time the only begotten
[9:17] son which is in the bosom of the father
[9:20] he ha declared him and then keep on
[9:22] coming down God and his people he was
[9:25] the the son but we are the a son to
[9:29] declare him to God coming and putting
[9:32] his attributes in us to declare him just
[9:34] like Jesus
[9:37] did no and this is the record of John
[9:40] where the Jews sent priests and Levites
[9:43] from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou
[9:44] and he confessed and denied not but
[9:47] confessed I am not the Christ and they
[9:49] asked him what then art thou elas and he
[9:52] saith I am not art thou that prophet and
[9:54] he answered no then said they unto him
[9:57] who art thou that we may give an answer
[9:59] to them that sent us what sayest thou of
[10:03] thyself we were talking about uh uh our
[10:08] our our role in in this plan and John
[10:11] knew who he was and what we was he was
[10:14] sent for he said I am the voice of one
[10:17] crying in the wilderness make straight
[10:19] the way of the Lord as said the prophet
[10:22] Isaiah cuz
[10:25] the the word is the expression of of the
[10:29] attributes of God and the word has a
[10:31] voice John the word was declared in John
[10:35] and they which were sent with were of
[10:37] the Pharisees and they asked him and
[10:38] said unto him why baptized thou then if
[10:40] thou be not that Christ nor lies neither
[10:43] that prophet and let's uh skip on
[10:48] down so what I'm getting at where we're
[10:54] going God in his Universe God in his
[10:57] word God in his his son he came to
[11:01] declare all of his fullness in his son
[11:03] so that we could see him so that they
[11:05] could in John first John 1:1 uh John
[11:09] said we we have handled him with our own
[11:11] hands we handled him when we saw him we
[11:13] heard him and in job 45 I think it's 452
[11:18] he said I heard with my ears but now I
[11:22] seeth with my eye with his eye and we
[11:25] talked about let your eye be single the
[11:27] eye of your soul that that can uh to P
[11:31] to see the things of God and maybe job
[11:34] never actually saw like Saul Jesus or or
[11:38] saw God walking before him he could see
[11:41] see with the eye of his heart right the
[11:44] uh word being open and that's
[11:47] how uh you know we sing that song Open
[11:49] the Eyes of My Heart now John uh John
[11:54] had disciples and he preached he he
[11:57] taught them that one day this Messiah
[11:59] was going to come and they uh they
[12:02] wanted to see for their own for
[12:04] themselves and so they were waiting
[12:07] expecting to see for their eyes to be
[12:09] open and they they could not perceive
[12:11] they couldn't they couldn't discern who
[12:14] what from all among all the people that
[12:16] were coming down to the river Jordan who
[12:18] was it that would that would be the
[12:19] Messiah and there was two disciples
[12:21] Andrew and John and one day John and his
[12:24] disciples were walking and Jesus passed
[12:26] by and there and John pointed them to
[12:31] the word just like brother Brandon
[12:33] pointed us to open our eyes to see God
[12:37] in his word and he said there there he
[12:39] is and John and Andrew looked and
[12:42] immediately they went and followed him
[12:44] and they went and asked him where do you
[12:45] dwell and uh we can go into that how
[12:47] they they wanted to abide where he was
[12:50] where where do you dwell they didn't ask
[12:52] him immediately what his Doctrine was
[12:54] but they asked him where do you dwell
[12:56] and they went and they stayed till the
[12:58] 10th hour
[12:59] because they could see God they began to
[13:01] see God and his son and then the process
[13:03] continues on God here in his
[13:07] people I just wanted to read first
[13:10] John
[13:12] 1:1 real
[13:14] quick where John
[13:17] said that which was from the beginning
[13:20] which we have heard which we have seen
[13:22] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[13:23] and our hands have handled of the word
[13:26] of life for the life was man ested and
[13:29] we have seen it and bear witness and
[13:31] show unto you that eternal life which
[13:33] was with the father and was manifested
[13:35] unto us and now it's manifested in us
[13:39] and this last one is maybe the hardest
[13:41] one to see it's so hard to see God and
[13:44] his people remember the next chapter on
[13:47] the third day Jesus went to the wedding
[13:49] supper and there was six Stone pots and
[13:53] they they he told the servants to put
[13:55] water in the pots and you know it's said
[13:58] TI the Holy Ghost there was six empty
[14:00] pots that the wedding supper had was
[14:03] empty of all of their Joy right this the
[14:05] stimulation of Revelation that comes
[14:07] from the wine of God's revealed word and
[14:10] they put water in the pots and the the
[14:13] servants put the water in the
[14:15] pots and to anybody else looking upon it
[14:18] Jesus never said Jesus never said let
[14:21] the water become wine he never declared
[14:24] let the water become wine to to the to
[14:26] just someone observing it was the
[14:28] servant
[14:29] that turned the water into wine that's
[14:31] what it looked like from the outside but
[14:33] behind the scenes it was God that turned
[14:35] the water into wine God hearing his
[14:38] people you look upon the outward and
[14:40] from the outward appearance it looks
[14:42] like it might look like nothing's
[14:43] happening but behind the scenes on the
[14:46] inside God Is quickening Us and making
[14:49] us his manifested word
[14:54] hallelujah now uh this is in Christ is
[14:57] the mystery of God revealed 1963 brother
[15:00] brand and you know you could start
[15:02] talking about the three-fold uh pieces
[15:05] of the seventh seal and but this this is
[15:08] what the brother R talked about the
[15:11] threefold purpose of God's plan down
[15:13] Through the Ages first to express
[15:15] himself completely God in Christ second
[15:19] to have the preeminence is by this in
[15:21] his church which is his body the bride
[15:23] till he can have the preeminence to
[15:24] express himself through them and
[15:26] thoroughly to restore the kingdom to his
[15:28] right position so just all down through
[15:31] scriptures you can see God descending
[15:33] down to reveal himself and his people
[15:35] and we read this last time if you want
[15:37] to see God in his Universe get him on
[15:39] the inside if you get him on the inside
[15:42] then you can see him everywhere you he
[15:44] opens up your heart to see God where
[15:47] others
[15:49] can't and we talked about you know when
[15:52] the Ancients looked at Aries uh how if
[15:55] unless except by Revelation how would
[15:58] you see Aries in this little it's not
[16:00] even a shape it's just one line but only
[16:03] by
[16:04] Revelation and uh how the on the third
[16:07] day the second chapter we were just
[16:09] talking about on the third day God uh
[16:12] fil turned the water into wine and we
[16:15] are the third planet on the third day
[16:18] life came on the
[16:21] earth so last time we were looking
[16:23] through the stars and we read through uh
[16:25] how you can see God in his Universe we
[16:27] read some of these scriptures about um
[16:29] God made Arcus Orion and plees he named
[16:31] these stars and they had special
[16:34] meanings any little move meant some
[16:37] spiritual significance it just like when
[16:40] we read the word anything out of place
[16:42] uh there's something wrong with our
[16:45] Revelation if we can't put everything
[16:47] together in its
[16:52] place and uh we talked last time about
[16:56] um how there there are great ages where
[16:59] every thousand years or so the the sun
[17:02] moves into begins in a new constellation
[17:05] but every year the sun moves each month
[17:08] into a new constellation and uh you know
[17:11] brother random talked about how we're in
[17:13] can Cancer and Pisces and and some of
[17:16] these things I honestly can't put
[17:18] together rightly and but um the the the
[17:22] line the path of the sun through the
[17:24] constellations uh tells a story that the
[17:27] ancients could look before the first
[17:30] word was even written in the Bible and
[17:32] uh we don't look to the Stars today to
[17:34] for our Bible because the same story is
[17:37] magnified in this Bible amen so if you
[17:39] want to look at uh find out what the
[17:41] Virgo means now you can look in here and
[17:44] see Isaiah wrote about how a virgin will
[17:46] conceive and you can look and read in in
[17:48] Luke 1 about how the uh how Mary said be
[17:52] it unto me according to to Thy word so
[17:55] the story that was told in part in the
[17:57] stars that something was going to take
[17:59] place it now magnified it was magnified
[18:02] a little bit in the in in the pyramid
[18:04] and and then it will became even greater
[18:07] in the written bible and we talked about
[18:10] how the an ancient the ancient Egyptian
[18:13] temple in is has the reading
[18:15] instructions that you read it from the
[18:17] Virgin to the
[18:19] lion and um so in this last little bit
[18:25] we looked at how Virgo we're we're
[18:27] looking at the ancient the how the
[18:29] Ancients named called these the stars in
[18:32] the constellations and the names of the
[18:35] stars tells us the meaning of each of
[18:37] these
[18:38] constellations Virgo has the name of the
[18:40] Stars the branch the Messiah um who
[18:43] shall come down it has four
[18:45] constellations that are part of it
[18:47] called coma the woman and child the
[18:48] Desir of all
[18:51] Nations and uh Libra the weighing
[18:56] Redemption now in the Old Testament the
[18:58] the handwriting on the wall said you
[19:00] weigh in the balance and found warning
[19:02] but our price has been paid by the blood
[19:04] of the lamb and that's that's the story
[19:07] now uh there's uh the Stars just like
[19:10] the Bible has sometimes it has many
[19:12] different meanings so you can look at
[19:15] these constellations and see maybe a
[19:17] natural like what what constellation
[19:19] you're born under might have a natural
[19:21] an influence on what kind of person
[19:23] you're going to be uh but I I can't
[19:26] explain that um so if you ask me what uh
[19:30] you know they say if you're born under
[19:32] Aries then you uh you don't like to be
[19:34] told what to do um and I I can't expl
[19:38] looking at the people at work there's a
[19:41] there's a lot of people that I work with
[19:43] that are not born under Aries and they
[19:45] also don't like to be
[19:51] told pretty much covered
[19:57] everybody
[20:00] uh so so what I'm focusing on is the
[20:03] story of of redemption in the Stars not
[20:06] um and you know uh if you you you can
[20:10] almost focus on that too much all of my
[20:12] problems I I don't want to look into the
[20:14] Stars to find out what my problems
[20:16] because this word tells me how to to
[20:19] mortify the problems of the Flesh and uh
[20:23] you know if you have a good every
[20:25] morning get up and read your Bible at
[20:27] night or in the morning spend time with
[20:28] God then over time the flesh will be
[20:31] more and more mortified that's right and
[20:33] you'll become uh just buried deep down
[20:36] inside
[20:39] him Scorpio the conflict the attack of
[20:42] the enemy there's a deep red star at the
[20:44] beginning entireties that means the
[20:46] wounding and there's a star in the tail
[20:48] of L that means the perverse uh it's the
[20:53] star and the stinger and there there's
[20:55] constellations in Scorpio serpents in o
[20:58] fukus the struggle with the am remember
[21:00] OAS is the one wrestling with the
[21:01] serpent and OAS has his foot on the on
[21:05] the Scorpion now Hercules the mighty
[21:09] one there's ofus wrestling with the
[21:11] serpent stepping on the
[21:13] Scorpion Sagittarius the redeemer's
[21:15] Triumph the beauty of the coming forth
[21:19] the gracious one the going or sending
[21:21] forth pray there's four constellations
[21:23] praise for the Conqueror the heart the
[21:25] altar fire prepare prepared for his
[21:28] enemies and the Zodiac of dendas a man
[21:30] with a flail of his hand and drape of
[21:32] the Dragon cast down and he's curled

[24:04] four
[24:05] conversations taus in Hebrew means sure
[24:08] ruling the stars that make it up are Al
[24:11] debron the governor eln wounded palum

[24:34] eridanus the river flows from Orion's
[24:36] feet Orga the shepherd let's take a look
[24:38] at Orion cuz I think this is one of the
[24:41] most easy to spot constellations it's
[24:43] got these three stars right in the
[24:45] middle to make up ayan's belt and this
[24:47] is his shoulders and these are his knees
[24:49] and he's got his sword raised up over
[24:51] his head the bringer of light when you
[24:54] read the Bible and he opens it up to you
[24:56] think about Orion open up up your word
[24:58] to open up his word to
[25:00] you and
[25:04] uh there's
[25:06] a a lot of people look at the pyramids
[25:08] and remember the pyramid was the next
[25:11] coming on down the Bible was the the
[25:13] stars in the heaven with the first Bible
[25:14] then the pyramid a succession and then
[25:17] the the third was that the written word
[25:19] that came by the god in men and if you
[25:24] look up in the night sky the pyramids
[25:26] kind of make the same uh matched Orion's
[25:28] Belt this is the Great Pyramid and the
[25:30] other two pyramids fit this is actually
[25:32] a photograph of the Orion's belt
[25:34] superimposed on the um the pyramids and
[25:39] they it it seems to match up pretty
[25:42] good and book three Gemini a woman now

[26:39] himring the
[26:41] Lambs sheltered in the hiding place and
[26:44] the constellations that make up cancer
[26:46] are Ursa Minor now remember Ursa Minor

[26:53] the redeem the the the the little sheep
[26:57] that that are protected and Argo the
[26:59] ship
[27:03] um and then uh Leo the last one Leo now
[27:09] um you know if you if you reject brother
[27:13] Brown talked about how if you reject the
[27:15] Lamb's offering what he had done for us
[27:18] and turn it down then he'll Mercy always
[27:20] follows judgment and uh Leo represent
[27:24] look at these an Egyptian the name was
[27:28] pouring out the name of in Hebrew it's

[28:05] brother R said he leaves the throne to
[28:07] be an intercessor of a slain lamb to be
[28:10] a lion king to bring the world to
[28:12] judgment who is rejected his message
[28:14] he's not a mediator remember the Old
[28:16] Testament teaching now as we heard when
[28:17] the blood went off The Mercy Seat what
[28:19] was it judgment seat and when the lamb
[28:21] slain walked forward from eternity out
[28:23] of the father's throne and took his
[28:24] rights it was a judgment seat then eny
[28:27] come not a lamb but a lion king and he
[28:29] calls for his Queen to come stand by his
[28:32] side and uh I just put this in the
[28:35] PowerPoint if you get a copy from Joe
[28:37] all L this came from this book Francis
[28:39] Rolston in the 1800s did a lot of
