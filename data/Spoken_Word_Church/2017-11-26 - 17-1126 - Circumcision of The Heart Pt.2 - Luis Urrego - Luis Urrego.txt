TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] they're trying to get the screen that knows what we were watching let's go so it was happy you and it's great yeah there you go okay alright so we're gonna continue the part two of circumcision of the heart and this might lead into a part three but I'm not gonna be able to huh I'm not gonna be able to - oh yeah that's not oh it's not working oh they are having an issue with the microphone so anyways let's continue where we left off last time we might let it end up leading to a part 3 after there this is part two but then was this might held to a part three because but I'm not gonna be able to do part three until maybe February because brother Aaron he's taking all of next month and I think for the Ryan you're taking January okay his brother Bob is taking January I'm taking all February and then brother Ron is taking March all right so we're gonna continue where we left off last week just slide this over that was good by the way thank you all right so last time we left off by talking about job for Chapter five and if you were here to service on Tuesday we spoke about this and what the significance of this was in regards to our day now so if the this is when the children of Israel had crossed over into the Promised Land and at at that crossing after that crossing was when the Lord told them to told Joshua to go ahead and circumcise the children of Israel the second time so again God instituted a circumcision at the beginning with Abraham continued it on with Moses and then continued it on here with the third messenger I guess you could say here with Joshua and so God had never forgotten about his original word about circumcision it was continuing on you see even with Joshua so we read that last Sunday I'm not going to read that so the children of Israel were in full obedience and the reason why I read this and I put these is because it's quicker to read them especially because we're still limited on on Sunday mornings that's the reason I just read it you just read with me and then I'll just explain a few things the children of Israel there were in full obedience after they were circumcised for the second time and after they had crossed over into the promised land under the leadership of Joshua and Caleb and it was after after that we have believed God's promise and that and after we've stepped into that promise by faith then God can go to circumcise in our hearts all right we know that the Holy Spirit is the token he is the one who does circumcising right a lot of people think I need to change from the ins from the outside in before I can come to Christ but that's not the case God wants one God wants to reiax God wants to have you the way you are just as the song goes just as I am that's how I come to the Lord you know God that's how he wants you because he's the one who's gonna be doing the circumcised right you can't circumcise yourself right spiritually it's it's tough for somebody you know many times you think oh I'll do better tomorrow I'll do it I'll do and then you fall again the same thing in the same rut and it's a constant rut you know what I've learned what I've learned is if you just let the word before you and you just let God like David said David said I always put the Lord before me what is what it was the Lord the Lord is the word and he said I always put the words before me and when the word is fighting for you then you don't have to fight them you see he's doing the work for you and to me that is that is like the more time you you take to to be involved in the things of God the less time you're doing things for the world things for yourself you see what I'm saying be involved something I'm not I'm not just talking about that church what I'm talking about at home get involved with something because it's usually at the time when we're bored or when we have nothing in our mind that we get involved in doing something we're not supposed to be commended right I mean I just picked that for experience yeah and so when you get involved getting the word get put on a message you have children get involved with your children something spiritual do something that involves the word the word will fight for you and after a while you know you start having more victories in your life over that whatever that is in your life you see Amen so so after we have believed God's promise and stepped into that promise by faith then God can go to circumcise in our hearts Holy Spirit and then we'll be enjoy the benefits of guts that God's Spirit brings see it was after they had crossed over into the Promised Land it was when God told them circumcise Joshua circumcise their children for the second time because look as I said Tuesday you can be in this message forever a long time and you still not have the Holy Spirit in your life you still not have the new birth but yet you have all knowledge all of you that will not take you anywhere that that will not bring victories in your life but when you know and your anchor this word is anchored in your heart amen there's not even not a devil in hell can get you out of it you say that because I mean how can you explain people being in the message for 40 50 years and then one day they just get up and say I don't believe it anymore because the message was not in them that's right right message was all up here we don't want just intellectual knowledge sure you have to have intellectual knowledge and then that knowledge turns into a revelation because a lot of people say well you have to have a revelation but really you have to receive it in your mind first right then that can turn down and then it can turn into into a new revelation but a lot of people just have it up here and that's it and what did Malachi 4 say he said I will turn you say will turn the hardest of the children not their minds the hearts of the children back that's well that's what God wants to do he wants to heart amen Joshua chapter 5 verse 10 it says in the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal and kept the Passover the eating of the lamb which is Jesus on the fourteenth day of the month this was after the circumcision then they took they they they had the Passover they kept the Passover you know that the Passover is when they ate the lamb back in the Exodus before they exited out of out of Egypt and and the only way that we're gonna be able to enjoy feeding off the lamb is if the one the lamp is in us in the form of the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit cannot feed on anything else but himself so now I've didn't get to this on Tuesday but forgot to mention this but verse 11 says and they did eat of the old corn of the land on tomorrow after the Passover unleavened cakes in parched corn in the self-same day verse 12 and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land so here is where the manna stopped falling for them it was after they had crossed over and the circumcision had taken place they were in full opinions and that milk food in other words soft soft food had ceased they were mature in other words they just type them things out they were matured in full obedience and the Bible says here says but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year so they were they were eating strong meat now see very evening meat now and that's the thing you know there's got to be a point where you're just not feeding just on milk but at the same time I say this you can't stop because when you eat meat or you drink or when you when you eat food sometimes I'd like to have a glass of milk with my food as well you can't stop just drinking the foundations of the word you see you have to have the foundations there but also be able to upgrade to the to the more of God the strong meat and but a lot of people have where they just they're just eating the foundations and that's it no no long hair don't cut your hair no makeup and you know then all these things but then they can't go ahead of that they can't go past that you see there's a lot more involved in the word man that's just the foundation that's just milk and so but we need both of them still throughout the Christian life we need a balanced duck right praise the Lord so the children of Israel enjoyed the benefits of this promised land which is the Holy Ghost after they were full opinions to God because remember the promised land when they crossed over is not heaven is not the Millennium why because they still have battles and struggles in that land problems they still have to go conquer Jericho right yeah so it's not the Promised Land I mean it's not the Millenium or heaven so the only way Israel was a Macross over if the Promised Land was by crossing it take God at His Word take and just do it you see and sometimes it's tough for us maybe as Christians am I am I gonna overcome this or whatever you know what take out his word just do it just go at it you know now spiritual circumcision is the results of receiving the token now what is the token Holy Ghost exactly it's the sign amen well so what was circumcision well to Abraham it was it was to be a token as a sign right but uh brother Brent says he remember the Covenant blood the Covenant blood is not recognized without the token you cannot you will not you say well I've been sanctified from things that's not the token so you can you can be can be cleaned from things but still be a Pharisee Pharisees believed clean but then the day they they could not see the the word sent for their day amen which was Jesus Christ that's not the Tilton look what he says it's the Spirit it's the token the Spirit of Christ upon you believe it the token is the sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted now you can't get the token from the railroad fare until you pay the price and the only way you're going to pay the price is paid that's why I said above I said the only way is real is a bird across the promise I was by crossing you think that's right what believe it accepted full obedience to the whole Word of God will entitle you to the token that's what Jesus said the father sends the Holy Ghost to them that believed that obey Him right full obedience not the part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ now what if what if you was just all in but your feet hanging out what if you was all in with hands hanging out most all of us in but the heart hanging out see the heart is the hearts in the world yet see but we don't do that full complete obedience puts you in the word one you believe every bit and all of it it's in you and you watch it working through you so the Covenant of circumcision that God gave to Abraham was to be a universal blessing because it was to be for Abraham see alright and Abraham seed extends beyond just his physical seed all right but it has to do with his spiritual seed as well that's why spiritual circumcision is a universal blessing as well we are the spiritual seed of Abraham wave we're not the physical seed of Abraham but we are the spiritual seed of Abraham by faith because Abraham took God by faith and what he was doing I mean like I said last Sunday can you imagine God talking to you and telling you leave this leave your hometown leave the town or wherever you live leave leave Athens and go move to another city or another country that you know nothing about and in God said and I'll lead you okay Lord they made me know his name or nothing but yet still took by faith except that what he was saying that's what we do so since this is a universal blessing acts 2:38 4 to 30 to 39 was read 38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the token for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all there are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call so there's no there's no limit there right there's no limit to but of course Jesus Christ knows who will and who won't be except right therefore he could predestinate accordingly right so faith in God's Word is what Abraham's seed possesses amen now look look what wrote look what Paul says here in Romans and he Abraham received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised this faith that Abraham had he had it before the actual sign came to paint the beam that's what Paul is saying that he might be the father of all them that believe that's including us right so Paul is talking about that faith right though they be not circumcised he's talking about physical circumcision that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only in other words to the Jews right but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised because the Jews hold circumcision so strongly but Paul is here is talking in saying listen circumcision has nothing to do with you receiving Christ's physical circumcision has to do it has to do it's it's you can be uncircumcised and yet be a believer in Christ physically verse 13 for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed physically through the law through the law but through the righteousness of faith all right for if they which are of the law be heirs then faith is made void so in other words if it was just for the physical seed of Abraham then was to use for us to exercise faith right in this hour it's what Paul is saying faith is for not that faith is in that invalid and the promise made of none effect so we wouldn't be able to receive the promise because none of us have been circumcised you know not always have been circumcised physically because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all deceive amen not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all amen you know and whenever you get the time read Romans the book of Romans it's so it's so good so circumcision was was to set the seed of Abraham and Israel apart from the rest of the nations and and it wasn't necessary for Israel to physically prove to the whole world that they were circumcised but it was by the works and the things that they were doing although that physical sign was there but it was by the works and the things and they were doing in the signs that were around them that proved that they belonged to something different or somebody different right there were different people so we don't go around with a Sun on our back saying that we are Christians all right your life will prove whether you're a Christian or not it's your life yeah I remember brother Brandon when he said up when he was talking about if Jesus Christ was standing here today you he wouldn't be wearing a robe and Palestinian garments and stuff like that no he fit right in with the people right but people be like people people would probably wouldn't accept it and like nah he looks like a common person you know right common man you know but he'd fit right in here brother and said he'd be wearing a suit and tie you don't have to a lot of people think that you have to act all you know me y'all different and you know dress different and you know you have to act different of course but be y'all dress different and it you know to look humble that's not the case I mean God made us in different ways that's right some I was like things that with some of them don't they meant but you don't have to be all out there you know to say I'm a Christian you know no just be who you are a man leave got college means I don't now I want you to look at this member guavamama number of public me and brother Bob we were first was talking to brother Paul me and brother Bob where he brought this to my attention and I thought this was really good because if you read an Acts chapter 16 I was just reading here real quick it says then came he to Derbe and Lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a Jewess and believed that his father was a Greek so timotheus mom was a Jewess a Jewish lady but his father was a Greek so in other words a Gentile so he was a human color cement I guess you could say if if he lived in that area right if you lived in some area but so he was half to half Greek now verse 2 says which was well reported of by the Brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium him would Paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised them because of the Jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a Greek so Paul wanted to take timotheus with him to the ministry but he was afraid that the Jews were going to say something this man is half Gentile and I don't think he circumcised so how do you think how do you how do you think they would they would approve that he was circumcised other than physically showing right but I don't think man would be going around showing all constantly you know you see so this is interesting so there's the question how would the Jews know if timotheus had been circumcised or not circumcised to the Jews so being Greek people just automatically knew that that's right that's the reason why Paul was afraid to take the monkeyest with with me because of the Jews what they would think so he he certainly he had him circumcised it's what we just read right well there's a well the physical circumcision alone would not have been sufficient for the Jews see they wouldn't have even accepted that just just to show that that was done you see the brie ceremony would have had to have been observed so there would have been a mohel or mo l to testify now what is a mo L a mole is an expert in the surgical aspects of circumcision as well as knowledgeable in the laws of and customs pertaining to a traditional circumcision and ceremony a mo L is a person who is certified to be capable and not knowledgeable in both the surgical aspects of performing circumcision as well as the traditional aspects of performing a kosher circumcision and the traditional ceremony so they would have the Jews would have to go to the melt MOA who circumsized timotheus to say was this really take place can you certify that this really took place and they would have if he of the mo L really did it then he would have to so yes I did perform the circumcision and that man was always believed you see they couldn't argue with that man because he was certified in doing that and he was there so Timothy as they have to physically show the Jews they could just go to the mole and ask him right and who is our mole for today when the when the world is a Demming us and and satan comes to you and says you know your your look what you're doing look what you're not doing Amen armorless Christ that he managed man he's testifying on our back Oh amen and praise God I just thought that was beautiful wait man hey man look what first John 2:1 says my little children these things write unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous we have an advocate a man that moil is like the habit and right he's speaking for our behalf he's certified in all those ways in that spiritual circumcision right he knows hmm the first Timothy 2:15 for there is one God and one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus and Hebrews 8:6 but now have he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant this is the better covenant that he's talking about his spiritual circumcision right which was established upon better promises praise the Lord so I thought I'd throw that in there because God the Holy Spirit dwelling in you Jesus Christ that Holy Spirit will testify amen if you do have so from the beginning this this is what God really wanted a circumcision of the heart and he didn't this wasn't something just that that was that was mentioned in the New Testament this was also something this was actually mentioned in the Old Testament men wasn't sin and what they really needed was a change of heart not a cover-up of sins but God had to start that way first because again he had to he had to start from the beginning from the foundation and men were physical and that's how they they acted you know like I said last Sunday they were rough back then you know they were they it was physical everything was physical for them and for the old time God is looking is looking at the heart they met and look even in Deuteronomy 30 I'll skip down to verse 6 over verse success and the LORD thy God will circumcise dying heart so even in the Old Testament he's already speaking about circumcision of the heart not this job not just physical circumcision he's talking about circumcision in the heart and the heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayst live so he asked that in the Ten Commandments love that love thy God with all thy heart died like soul I like strength right but really that couldn't be done unless it was actually physically from the heart I know actually from the heart right you know because if that if that really took place from the heart the the Pharisees wouldn't have rejected Jesus Christ the way they did they just had it on the physical physical the flesh but they didn't have the spiritual aspect of and they would have never rejected the Messiah mmm praise God so God's intention from the beginning was to have the heart circumcised amen now once you're circumcised the hardest chains it's been altered right not physically but spiritually you've been altered when you come to Jesus Christ you're not the same Amen you're not the same and all things are passed away behold all things are new rightfully so when a physical circumcision I'm not trying to be disgusting here but understand what I'm trying to say I brought this out at a church one time and I guess I kind of worded it wrong and I had some sisters they were they were laughing while I was I'm sitting there preaching this so I kind of changed the wording here around a little bit but when physical circumcision takes place there was an alteration in the man's Anatomy right we're all adults here all right and you couldn't go back to the way the man's member was before the physical circumcision took place right there's no way to go back to it it's been altered it's been it's been altered so you couldn't go back to the way things were right not it not no not as much as the man might want to you couldn't go back to the way things were right the same thing with the Holy Ghost once your heart has been circumcised and your spirit renata me has been altered by Christ and there's no way you can go back to the way things were before and feel comfortable all right I feel comfortable you can't there's no way you may you yes you're growing yeah you might fall you're gonna make mistakes amen but you couldn't quickly repent okay something in you is like I got it I got it I gotta take care of this quickly you don't feel right anymore I don't feel right doing things if I fall into into things that you know something says wait a second that that's not that's not me anymore that's not meaning right we've all experienced that and you'll feel out of place out there in the world right and you just don't you can't fit in you don't if you don't feel out of place in the world and you didn't get your heart circumcised that offers you everybody right praise God so what is circumcision in our circumcision of the heart means the Holy Spirit going in and doing a work in the heart of man cutting off excess flesh yeah right none of you God doesn't want God doesn't he does want you but he doesn't want you to be living so much that he's not living with him right and in circumcision of the heart has nothing to do with the flesh and yet it does because again how I said the earlier the work starts from the inside out don't stop smoking your cigarettes before you come to Christ you'll never stop smoking cigarettes don't stop drinking alcohol before you before you say off before I come to Christ I need to stop drinking I gotta finish drinking my twelve case of beer and in the fridge before I come to church you know or come to crack know just do what just come to Christ all right I you know and then when there's been a true repentance a true work of Christ has been working you know has taken place that 12-pack of beer will take care of itself you know this is like I said it I said you know and that I just speak from my experience you know because when I was younger and and the Lord was dealing with me this was still in the Baptist Church this was the naming and the message there is things when I came when I accepted the fact that I needed to accept the Lord Jesus as my Lord and Savior even in that God was already doing the work in my life right even in that there was things that were falling there were that I didn't want to do anymore you know that I didn't want to get involved in anymore and I had friends friends would tell me you know because I love video games I still like playing them but you know there was certain video games that I would play back then they weren't really appropriate for for a Christian to play and and I was wanting to get rid of these video games and I'll tell my friend here I told my friend that I was a game gamer with I said look I just threw away the games and he said why did you throw him away why don't you just give it to me I said no because it's like me taking this poison and giving this poison to you yes it was a passing the poison over and so that's not what I wanted to do you see but nobody had told me to do that nobody it was just something that others are there rose up there wait a second this isn't this isn't godly this isn't what a Christian does right this isn't gonna help me grow in Christ to obtain a closer walk with Christ he must have a change from within which will didn't manifest on the outside amen the circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost and God gave to Abraham the circumcision son after he had accepted God and his promise and walked out into a strange country I will just skip this away free go last slide right here Deuteronomy 10 again look at verse 16 it says circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiff necked Jim the Lord talking about circumcision of the heart amen praise God so we'll just we'll just stop it right there we'll continue at another time [Music] I've never seen that
