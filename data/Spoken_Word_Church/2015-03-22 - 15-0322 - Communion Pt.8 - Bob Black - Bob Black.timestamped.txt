[0:00] I use the video today it says we keep
[0:03] having audio problems
[0:04] with the other
[0:08] some have said that it's a little bit
[0:10] staticky and whatnot on that yeah
[0:16] so we're going to continue our thought
[0:18] on communion uh before we get started
[0:20] let's just go the Lord in prayer and we
[0:22] have I know brother Matthew said he was
[0:24] up all night with a fever hey you know
[0:27] when you get uh when the when the Lord's
[0:29] fixing to do something then I believe
[0:31] that Satan and Satan all always tries to
[0:33] hinder and he'll start um
[0:36] shaking things up right and that's one
[0:38] of the things I want to talk about this
[0:40] morning is how things get shaken up to
[0:43] see what you're gonna do and how you're
[0:45] going to react and to bring you into
[0:47] communion with anything that's right and
[0:49] maybe in a lot of Our Lives he's he's
[0:51] shaking things are getting shaken a
[0:53] little bit but there's there's one in us
[0:56] that's greater than everyone that's in
[0:57] the world
[0:59] God we thank you Lord Jesus are your
[1:02] grace to us
[1:04] God I pray though that you'll come on
[1:06] sing for real Matthew this morning
[1:09] God granted I pray that your leader
[1:11] brother dawn this morning Lord and God
[1:13] gather the doctor's hands Lord and give
[1:14] him strength to recover quickly Lord
[1:16] Jesus and just be with him you give him
[1:18] strength in the sorrow Oh God God I pray
[1:21] that you'll be with Brother Gary and all
[1:22] the other ones the Lord Jesus that are
[1:24] sick and Afflicted and going through
[1:25] trials Lord granted Lord Jesus said to
[1:28] me with the service and be with us a
[1:29] little lesson this morning God that
[1:30] you'll help us to doing something that's
[1:32] wrong
[1:36] amen amen because you know prayer is
[1:40] important because uh if you just stay
[1:43] with your nose in the Bible all the time
[1:45] you you got to you've got to combine
[1:47] what you learned let the Spirit come and
[1:50] Quicken it amen prayers when you get in
[1:52] with that little secret place and let
[1:56] communion with God and let it speak back
[1:58] to you right now
[2:06] so I wanted to start off forward
[2:09] just kind of look at this little picture
[2:11] because the the scene we just read was
[2:13] was Paul as he's describing in First
[2:16] Corinthians chapter 11.
[2:18] communion and you know a lot of times we
[2:21] read through the the verses about how uh
[2:24] about how a woman should have a long
[2:26] hair and a man should have short hair
[2:27] and we we kind of look at that as do's
[2:29] and don'ts but make a read between the
[2:31] lines and look at look at how God is
[2:33] trying to bring us into communion how
[2:35] he's trying to bring the bride into
[2:38] headship with my husband and the angels
[2:41] are bringing us the the the the the
[2:43] prophets down Through the Ages the
[2:45] ministers the angels angels bring us
[2:47] into are trying to bring us into
[2:48] fellowship with God Amen back in the
[2:51] Garden of Eden those four cherubims were
[2:53] driving driving us away from the Tree of
[2:56] Life and now they're driving us back
[2:58] towards it towards the Tree of Life the
[3:00] fellowship with him and real communion
[3:03] with God starts not like that uh that
[3:06] that that that building that that Satan
[3:09] building down through Christian nimrods
[3:11] that starts at the head but real
[3:13] communion starts at the foundation right
[3:16] it's got to start at the feet that's
[3:19] what Jesus said he told Peter if if your
[3:21] feet are clean if you're if your
[3:23] foundation is right then you're all
[3:26] clean you're you're everything's
[3:27] everything's it's it's right it's good
[3:30] to go
[3:31] so get your foundation right get it get
[3:34] your foundation the foundation planning
[3:36] and him on faith where God's faith is
[3:40] given to you and it's it's a faith that
[3:43] cannot be shaken no matter what what the
[3:45] devil throws at you amen it's something
[3:48] that that's unmovable and then you're
[3:50] you're planning on Firm Foundation I
[3:52] don't think in seconds
[3:54] so
[3:56] the Holy Ghost was really uh even before
[4:00] before Jesus began to preach John on the
[4:03] River Jordan he preached this little
[4:05] sermon and he was he was telling the
[4:07] people on the on the river he said I
[4:09] indeed bam tip baptized you with water
[4:11] under it but he that cometh after me
[4:14] is mightier than I whose shoes I am not
[4:18] worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with
[4:20] the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan
[4:24] is in his hand and he will thoroughly
[4:27] prepared it for him and gather his weed
[4:30] into the garnery but he will burn up the
[4:32] chaff with unquenchable fire
[4:35] now that's what that's what God's doing
[4:37] through the new birth you start off on
[4:39] that found that firm foundation and he
[4:41] begins to roll through you now think
[4:43] about all the things that we've covered
[4:44] we cover the stone that came out of the
[4:47] mountain and it rolls through Babylon
[4:48] it's cleared it out we're talking about
[4:51] the Holy Ghost that is a consuming fire
[4:53] that's purging the Earth and purging to
[4:56] believe her Persian the believer of all
[4:58] unbelief so that when somebody quotes
[5:00] you a little scripture or or tells you
[5:02] something that they heard in the Bible
[5:03] you don't say well is that right or not
[5:06] but you can stand upon your faith
[5:08] believing and that faith will take you
[5:11] yet resting on the written word of God
[5:14] the revelation of the written word of
[5:16] God will is what will take us into the
[5:19] Rapture
[5:20] the fan is in his hand and he's
[5:23] thoroughly Purge his floor
[5:27] Malachi chapter 4 verses one through two
[5:30] that's speaking of the same thing but
[5:32] for behold the day cometh that's your
[5:34] burn as an oven and all the proud ye all
[5:37] and all that do wickedly shall be
[5:39] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[5:41] burn them up saith the Lord have hosted
[5:43] it shall lead them neither root or
[5:44] branch
[5:45] now when you when you look at scripture
[5:50] God has to give you a revelation up
[5:52] because one brother can say well I see
[5:55] that God is going to clean the Earth off
[5:57] and you say well I got it now
[5:59] but then now apply that personally to
[6:02] your old life that you know that God can
[6:05] God get there's there's uh as he you
[6:07] know how brother Brown talked about how
[6:09] when the Seven Seals were open it was
[6:10] like fireworks bursting off there's so
[6:13] many little aspects and different things
[6:15] that you can see as God's word begins to
[6:17] reveal to you so he's cleaning off the
[6:19] Earth but he's cleaning this Earth
[6:23] so that's what I kind of want to focus
[6:25] today you know the the Earth is going to
[6:27] be cleansed but we're our focus and
[6:31] that's kind of what brother Matthew was
[6:32] getting at yesterday is it at the focus
[6:34] of the Bride the specialty of the Bride
[6:37] in this day is to take a body change
[6:39] there's going to be an elect a little
[6:42] group of people that's going to believe
[6:43] God up until the end and just and just
[6:46] going to step off the Earth just like
[6:47] Eno did
[6:48] for behold the day cometh they shall
[6:50] burn as an oven and all the proud of you
[6:53] and all that do wickedly shall be
[6:54] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[6:57] burn them up say at the Lord of hosts
[6:59] that it shall leave them neither root
[7:00] nor Branch but unto you that fear my
[7:04] name shall the son of righteousness
[7:06] arise with healing in his wings and he
[7:08] shall go forth and grow up as calves
[7:10] with a stalk now we know how brother
[7:13] explained uh the son of righteousness
[7:16] arrives with healing in his wings yes
[7:19] he's come to give us healing in our body
[7:21] but what's the ultimate goal of the
[7:23] healing in our body to completely heal
[7:26] it and to give us a Rapture to change
[7:28] our bodies into immortality and how are
[7:31] we doing it by eating by feasting on the
[7:34] revealed word of God by growing up as
[7:37] calves of the star a little calf in the
[7:40] star just keeps eating and eating and
[7:42] eating eating on the word that God has
[7:44] given to us
[7:47] which is why it's so important that God
[7:51] sent a prophet in this last day to seal
[7:53] up to to finish up everything so there's
[7:56] no there's no questions anymore there's
[7:58] no doubt it takes away all of that in
[8:01] the days of divorce of the seven of Asia
[8:02] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[8:04] of God should be finished as he hit the
[8:06] glad to servants the prophets there's no
[8:08] more doubt about whether there's there's
[8:10] one God or three gods or or what
[8:12] happened on the River Jordan or or
[8:14] what's going on because the whole
[8:16] mystery of God is finished and now we're
[8:19] supposed to know who God is and who we
[8:21] are and how we fit in the picture and
[8:23] and not just uh like like the have
[8:27] pieces and the puzzle Miss right right
[8:30] now look this is this is one of my
[8:32] favorite scriptures and this is one this
[8:33] is the scripture that brogram read when
[8:35] he was preaching Christ The Mystery of
[8:36] God revealed amen well I made a minister
[8:39] according to the dispensation of God
[8:40] which is given the mission to fulfill
[8:42] the word of God
[8:44] even the mystery which has been hid from
[8:47] ages and from Generations but now is
[8:50] made manifest to his sight Amen to whom
[8:54] God will make known what is the riches
[8:56] of the glory of this mystery among the
[8:58] Gentiles which is Christ amen
[9:02] the hope of glory amen
[9:05] I believe everybody should have that
[9:07] scripture just uh just memorize and some
[9:11] of you know when you come to my house
[9:12] that's the wireless password to my
[9:14] network so Colossians 1 27. you gonna
[9:17] get on the internet you gotta type that
[9:19] in
[9:22] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[9:25] that's the mystery that God is revealing
[9:28] today that God has he came to unfold
[9:30] himself in in in in the person of Jesus
[9:33] Christ
[9:34] and in his bride
[9:36] and now he's restoring eating back and
[9:38] all these things he's that stone was
[9:40] coming through rolling through to
[9:42] restore everything back to take that uh
[9:45] to take us back to the to the original
[9:47] condition
[9:48] and and this is the scripture uh brother
[9:50] Branham also read when he was
[9:53] explaining without controversy great is
[9:55] the mystery of God unless God was
[9:57] manifesting the flesh justified in the
[10:00] spirit singing of angels preached
[10:01] another Gentiles believed over in the
[10:03] world received up into glory and all
[10:05] these Mysteries should be if we're in
[10:08] the word and constantly stand prayed up
[10:11] and studying they should be unfolding to
[10:14] us so that there's no doubt amen
[10:16] because the whole point is to get to
[10:20] bring us in the communion communion is
[10:22] Union
[10:23] communion with God takes is taking two
[10:26] things that are separate and bringing
[10:29] them together whether it's disagreement
[10:31] you can't one can't talk or the other
[10:33] one can't know what the other's all
[10:35] about and he's bringing us together so
[10:37] that we can be one you know
[10:42] and this is a scripture that we all
[10:43] should know Revelation is 11 15. and
[10:46] this just ties into death of 70 weeks
[10:48] and the Seven Seals and and uh the the
[10:52] whole purpose of what God's doing the
[10:54] seven things will sound it
[10:57] right before the third world yeah the
[11:00] second world has come the third world is
[11:03] on its way which is the third world war
[11:06] uh the seventh angel sounded and there
[11:09] were great voices in heaven now what's
[11:11] what's the message supposed to do it's
[11:13] supposed to just bringing us so that
[11:15] we're saying the same thing as God what
[11:18] we are we have the same conversation we
[11:21] have we're saying the same thing Adam uh
[11:23] uh when Adam was walking through the
[11:25] Garden of Eden he like brother Louise
[11:27] was preaching he he knew
[11:29] exactly what God wanted those animals to
[11:31] be named he he had the same mind of God
[11:35] and that's what God is bringing us up we
[11:38] can say exactly what he's saying we know
[11:41] what he wants and we say the kingdoms of
[11:43] this world are become the kingdoms of
[11:46] our Lord and of his Christ and he shall
[11:48] reign forever and ever amen now you look
[11:51] at the kingdoms of this world
[11:53] but also all the kingdoms of this world
[11:57] right all the little ideas and things
[11:59] that I had all the denominational things
[12:01] that from Luther Wesley all that stuff
[12:04] has been purged by the Holy Ghost and
[12:07] Fire now so there's the nuns live it's
[12:10] it's being rooted out and blasted away
[12:13] right
[12:15] and remember what Satan's kingdom is the
[12:18] stone tore down Satan's kingdom what is
[12:21] Satan anything contrary to the word he
[12:24] doesn't have salvation he doesn't have a
[12:26] light his kingdom is Darkness
[12:28] the inner of his death
[12:30] darkness and death is Satan's kingdom
[12:33] brother Brandon repeat it again it must
[12:36] be good let's be important what is
[12:39] Satan's kingdom
[12:40] anything contrary to the word of God
[12:44] right amen anything contrary to the
[12:47] precepts of God the word of God is not
[12:49] God what is it what is sin righteousness
[12:51] perverted what is death life perverted
[12:53] what is the kingdom of Satan anything
[12:55] that's setting something to take the
[12:57] place of the word anything any teaching
[13:01] one word just one word
[13:04] you might believe every bit Eve believed
[13:06] every bit of it to that one word that
[13:09] one word is all she needed to disbelieve
[13:11] that one word is all you need to
[13:14] disbelieve amen
[13:16] foreign
[13:19] which is what God's doing he's tearing
[13:21] it out he's he's all the unbelief
[13:24] and the guy brother Reynolds said at the
[13:27] finishing of the seventh seal the
[13:28] mystery of God should be finished to
[13:30] know who God is what he is how he lives
[13:34] his nature his being why is that so
[13:37] important so we'll have faith so we can
[13:40] believe God's word when when when when
[13:42] when Jesus stood in the temple and said
[13:44] this day this scripture is fulfilled he
[13:46] was identified himself with what the
[13:48] scripture said you can identify yourself
[13:50] with the written word of God it gives
[13:53] you power to believe you know when when
[13:55] when uh you just look all the all the
[13:58] Old Testament people that went through
[14:00] these little stories and things where
[14:01] God could come down and show them what
[14:03] was written them and you could you see
[14:05] yourself in the word I'm going to show
[14:07] you a little scripture in a second that
[14:09] when I was born again God showed me
[14:10] myself in the world
[14:14] the clarity among the Nations this is a
[14:16] scripture in Jeremiah chapter 50 verse
[14:18] 2. declarity among the Nations and
[14:20] Publishers set up a standard publish and
[14:22] conceal not say bad is taking Baal the
[14:26] confounder which we looked at
[14:28] The Bell the confounder is confounded
[14:32] by the the fullness of preaching right
[14:34] by the the Simplicity of the Gospel
[14:37] Meredith the rebel is broken in pieces
[14:40] her Idols are confounded her images are
[14:43] broken in pieces and Daniel chapter 2
[14:45] which we read that sauce to the stones
[14:47] cut out without hands we smoke the image
[14:49] upon his feet that were of iron and clay
[14:50] and break into pieces
[14:52] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[14:54] silver and the gold broken the pieces
[14:56] together and became like the chaff of
[14:58] the summer threshing floors
[15:00] look at that now of the summer dressing
[15:02] flowers
[15:03] and the wind carried them away that no
[15:07] place was found for them and the stone
[15:10] to smooth the image became a great
[15:13] mountain and filled the whole earth
[15:15] right
[15:16] became like the chaff of the summer
[15:19] threshing floors
[15:20] where did Ruth find Boaz what was he
[15:23] doing right he was working away he was
[15:26] busy doing something
[15:27] then Naomi her mother-in-law said under
[15:29] my daughter shall I not seek rest for
[15:31] the internet made me wealthy and now as
[15:33] Boaz of our Kindred when whose
[15:35] maintenance that I was behold he went on
[15:37] with barley tonight in the threshing
[15:39] floor
[15:40] because God's not just sitting by
[15:42] because Boaz you know is a type of
[15:44] Christ and Christ is not just sitting by
[15:47] when when Adam and Eve went out he said
[15:49] I am going to make away afterwards he
[15:53] began to winner get separated he said
[15:56] I'll put enmity between the woman's seed
[15:58] and the serpency
[16:00] and you could say well as soon as he
[16:02] died on the cross it was finished but
[16:04] it's not finished to you right until you
[16:07] have the new birth right now until that
[16:09] until the woman's seed is given to you
[16:12] right is is part of you enjoying inside
[16:15] of your soul you and God together like
[16:17] brother Randall said then you can say
[16:19] there's enmity between the Surface seed
[16:22] and the woman's seed as he begins to win
[16:24] them and in your life right and get rid
[16:27] of all the all the unbelief and all the
[16:29] things that aren't supposed to be there
[16:31] so what what's he doing he's working
[16:33] away
[16:34] and this is a picture of a a man with a
[16:37] fan in his hand winning the barley and
[16:40] what he would do is he take this this uh
[16:42] uh this little fan and he'd fill it up
[16:45] with with uh the the
[16:48] tears and the wheat and everything and
[16:50] and then he he kind of bounce it up so
[16:52] that the wind
[16:53] would blow away all the stuff that's not
[16:56] supposed to be there and it would fall
[16:58] it would blow away
[17:00] now
[17:02] the gospel message is blowing away
[17:04] everything that's not supposed to be
[17:06] there you say well I don't need to come
[17:07] to church you better get in that wind if
[17:09] there's no wind blowing
[17:12] you got to get all that all that chaff
[17:15] and everything yeah the gospel is the
[17:18] the prophet's message you got to stay
[17:20] into the message
[17:21] like that calf is growing in the stall
[17:23] that we just read and and uh
[17:26] and and all those things so so God just
[17:30] imagine God
[17:32] over the last since Adam and Eve left
[17:34] the Garden of Eden right he got to work
[17:37] yeah he was doing this getting things
[17:40] back trying to trying to do everything
[17:42] he could to bring us back in the perfect
[17:44] communion with him
[17:48] which is what this type is in Ruth
[17:50] chapter 3 verse 14-15 she laid his feet
[17:53] into the morning
[17:55] ready to do whatever it takes and she
[17:59] rose up before one could know another
[18:00] and he said let it not be known that a
[18:02] woman came into the floor also he said
[18:04] bring the veil of thou has to pull me
[18:06] and hold it and when she held it he
[18:07] measured six measures of barley and
[18:10] later on and she went into the City and
[18:13] brother random said that was six
[18:15] thousand years and God was working six
[18:18] majors of barley until the whole thing
[18:20] the whole process is finished and full
[18:23] Redemption is completed now that was
[18:26] full Redemption you've got the Holy
[18:28] Ghost full Redemption is is our bodies
[18:32] are changed we go back to the way the
[18:35] whole process is completed right
[18:38] and when she came to her mother-in-law
[18:40] she said who art thou my daughter and
[18:42] she told her all that the man had done
[18:43] to her and she said these six majors of
[18:45] barley gave him me for he said to me go
[18:48] not empty unto thy mother-in-law then
[18:50] said she sit still my daughter
[18:54] because look when you get the new birth
[18:57] you're not working you're not trying to
[18:59] do something it's not you it's God doing
[19:01] it inside of you that's right it's the
[19:03] power of God it was the power of God to
[19:05] delivered the Israel from the Egyptians
[19:08] sanctification as they cross the Red Sea
[19:10] it's the power of God that took them
[19:12] over the Jordan River right the Baptist
[19:14] and the Holy Ghost
[19:15] the power of God is what will deliver
[19:17] you from things of this world Amen if
[19:20] it's the power of God if they had to
[19:22] come over the Red Sea and still been
[19:24] arming armed with the Egyptians that
[19:25] shows us something's wrong right because
[19:27] the power of God can deliver you from
[19:29] things of this world you say well I I
[19:31] got the Holy Ghost but I'm still going
[19:32] out to alcohol or or any of those any
[19:35] tobacco whatever you want to say what
[19:36] are all those things in the world then
[19:38] it shows uh you're you're going back and
[19:41] you're walking arm and arm with
[19:42] Egyptians that should have been consumed
[19:46] by the Water by the power of God that
[19:48] was destroyed destroyed all the
[19:50] Egyptians in the Red Sea and they came
[19:52] over
[19:53] and kept on their Journey until they
[19:55] until they crossed over the Jordan River
[19:56] amen but that when they crossed over
[19:59] that Jordan River they were resting and
[20:01] it was God that delivered Jericho in our
[20:03] hands it was God that delivered the
[20:04] amalekites and the the all the other
[20:07] tribes it was God and did that they
[20:09] picked up the sword and went after him
[20:11] but you know not one perished a God God
[20:15] would fight their battles right and
[20:16] that's what's what God is doing in the
[20:18] New Birth we're resting in him as he
[20:20] delivers us from our unbelief amen until
[20:23] I knew how the matter will fall for the
[20:26] man will not be in rest now see there's
[20:28] a picture we're resting but God is busy
[20:32] yeah God is a working diligently to
[20:36] purify us for the man will not be unrest
[20:38] until he have finished the thing this
[20:41] day right
[20:42] he will not rest until we're until our
[20:46] bodies are changed until until there's
[20:48] somebody that takes a body change
[20:52] and Hebrews 12 24-29 it's Jesus the
[20:55] mediator of the New Covenant and to the
[20:57] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[20:59] things than that of April
[21:00] see that ye refuse not him to speak it
[21:02] for if they escape not who refused him
[21:04] that speckled Earth much more shall not
[21:06] we escape if we turn away from him that
[21:07] speak it from Heaven whose voice then
[21:10] shook the Earth
[21:11] and now he hath promised saying yet once
[21:14] more I shake not the Earth only but also
[21:18] heaven and what's he doing he's shaking
[21:21] to get rid of all this stuff that's not
[21:23] supposed to be there amen amen and he's
[21:25] gonna shake the Earth
[21:27] to get rid of all the chaff so we can
[21:29] live on it with him all right and this
[21:32] word get once more signify the removing
[21:35] of those things that are shaking as of
[21:38] things that are made
[21:41] everything that's made will be removed
[21:43] but only only the things that are
[21:46] Eternal will remain and that those
[21:48] things which cannot be shaken
[21:50] May remain wherefore we receiving a
[21:54] kingdom which cannot be moved amen let
[21:57] us have Grace whereby we may serve God
[21:59] except to live with reverence and godly
[22:01] fear and there he finishes it that's
[22:03] where we started isn't that good for God
[22:06] God is a consuming fire amen he's
[22:09] rolling through the Earth clearing out
[22:10] everything that shouldn't be there yeah
[22:11] and you're rolling through our lives
[22:14] I see why it's so important that you
[22:17] have the new birth that's right because
[22:19] without the new birth you don't have
[22:20] that fire inside of you to cleanse and
[22:23] purify you right amen
[22:26] and get you ready real comedian now this
[22:29] is the scripture this is after I got the
[22:31] new birth this is one of the first
[22:33] things that God revealed to me and
[22:35] really I I began to see myself in the
[22:37] scripture and I called up I know I was
[22:39] calling my brother Aaron McGee back then
[22:40] I said brother look at what I see in the
[22:43] scripture but uh Galatians 2 20. I am
[22:47] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[22:49] live yet not I
[22:52] but Christ lives in me and the life
[22:55] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[22:59] the Faith by my faith
[23:01] it's not my friend
[23:06] by the faith of the son of God
[23:11] who loved me and gave himself
[23:24] so there's just one seal that's right
[23:26] the grieve not the holy spirit of God
[23:28] whereby you are seal until the day of
[23:30] redemption
[23:32] and that's that
[23:34] that's what God gives you his faith you
[23:36] know to begin carry out all unbelief
[23:40] from your life
[23:41] and then you're sealed in
[23:47] what was the Holy Ghost to give it for
[23:48] this is this is one of the most if you
[23:51] go back and look and you just see the
[23:53] continuity of the message even back in
[23:56] the you know people want to throw out
[23:58] the messages that program preached
[23:59] before the seals and stuff but way back
[24:02] then he was preaching things that he
[24:04] would preach later just by The
[24:05] Inspirations always and uh
[24:09] so many good things in this message what
[24:12] was the Holy Ghost given for you can see
[24:14] the statue of perfect man you can see
[24:16] full Redemption all these things in this
[24:18] message that so I encourage you to go
[24:21] back and listen to it
[24:22] and see what the Holy Ghost was given
[24:24] for that's it what the Holy Ghost was
[24:26] given for what I was talking about is to
[24:28] bring us in the communion with him
[24:30] there's only one way to find out find it
[24:32] there's there was a stone cut out of the
[24:34] mountain without hands that rolled into
[24:36] the world and smashed it out and become
[24:37] like weak or chaff on the threshing
[24:39] floor
[24:40] let that stone the Christ Jesus that
[24:43] stumbling Stone to the world a stone of
[24:45] an offense a laughing Stone a stumbling
[24:48] block to the church but a precious and a
[24:50] low Stone to the believer a stone of
[24:52] assurance a stone of rest
[24:55] resting
[24:57] like Ruth I know that I've passed from
[25:01] Death unto life
[25:02] my soul is at rest
[25:05] and then he goes oh come unto me all ye
[25:07] that labor and every Laden and I'll give
[25:08] you rest to your soul
[25:11] assign this to be evil spoke enough said
[25:14] to talk to Mary it'll be a sign amen
[25:18] and Daniel saw the same thing or rocks
[25:20] took the world was cued out without
[25:22] hands and the whole image of the systems
[25:24] was broke down and become like chaff on
[25:26] a summer threshing floor remember I just
[25:28] read this read down
[25:30] so it it we just got a few more minutes
[25:33] let's kind of review remember we were
[25:35] looking at Nimrod the three things that
[25:36] Nimrod wanted to do you want to set up a
[25:38] kingdom he wanted to build a strong
[25:40] nation which he started from the head of
[25:42] gold right instead of starting in
[25:44] humility from the feet
[25:46] he wanted to propagate his own religion
[25:48] which he did he wanted to make a name
[25:50] for himself which he also accomplished
[25:52] and he said let's go to let us build us
[25:54] a city in the tower whose top May reach
[25:57] unto hell and let us make a name unless
[25:59] we be scattered abroad upon the face of
[26:01] the whole Earth
[26:02] because a real a real relationship with
[26:05] God always starts in humility God save
[26:08] me I can't do it on my own man you ought
[26:10] to help me all right somebody was was uh
[26:14] somebody was telling me about how years
[26:16] ago they were in a church and and they
[26:18] remember this this little sister she get
[26:20] up and sing and she'd say I'm gonna make
[26:24] it
[26:25] what about you you know pointing fingers
[26:28] and I'm saying I I wonder maybe if we
[26:30] are instead of pointing fingers maybe
[26:32] pulling our fingers in inwards a little
[26:34] bit and examine our own lives examine
[26:37] our own self and humility Washington one
[26:40] another's feet like Jesus did our
[26:41] example to help one another along
[26:44] instead of instead of judging so much
[26:49] this is a quote we're all familiar with
[26:52] notice again now what's his threefold
[26:54] purpose this is the purpose
[26:56] God's purpose and then prayer that with
[26:59] with nimrod's purpose nimrod's trying to
[27:02] set up a kingdom and God's trying to set
[27:04] up a kingdom and I'll finish in just a
[27:06] second
[27:07] now notice again the what's this
[27:08] three-fold purpose manifests itself in
[27:10] Jesus Christ to come into the body by
[27:13] Jesus Christ to have the premise to what
[27:15] restore back you can bring on the back
[27:16] that which was lost yeah the only thing
[27:19] out of it where all the rest of his
[27:20] things was in order
[27:22] God in his body
[27:26] let's be able to express himself in full
[27:27] and so forth as God in a deity through
[27:29] his church have the pureness in this
[27:31] church make us Anointed with the word
[27:33] amen
[27:36] and this is what I kind of wanted to
[27:37] finish on because communion is bringing
[27:41] two things and we just read it first
[27:43] Corinthians 11. as often as you eat this
[27:46] bread and drink this cup eat this bread
[27:48] and drink this cup there's two things
[27:50] that can be
[27:52] you do show the Lord definitely coming
[27:54] back so what did Jesus tell the woman at
[27:56] the well in John chapter 4 20 23 24 the
[27:59] hour cometh and now is when the true
[28:01] worshipers shall worship the father in
[28:03] spirit
[28:04] and in truth for the father seeking such
[28:08] to worship him God is a spirit and they
[28:10] that worship Him must worship Him in
[28:11] spirit and in truth
[28:14] in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 in him
[28:17] who be also trusted after you heard the
[28:19] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[28:21] salvation and who also after that you
[28:23] believe you are sealed with that Holy
[28:25] Spirit of promise even with your new
[28:27] birth it's a joined together and I see
[28:30] some Sleepy Eye so I'm gonna go ahead
[28:32] and stop here because you want me to be
[28:33] awake for church amen
[28:36] hallelujah
[28:38] God bless you thank you again
