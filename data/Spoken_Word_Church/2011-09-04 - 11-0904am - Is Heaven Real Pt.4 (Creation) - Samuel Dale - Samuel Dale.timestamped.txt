[21:13] virus or whether she got something that
[21:15] you know from a bad hamburger and and
[21:18] made her sick but you know I believe God
[21:20] will make it well everything will be all
[21:21] right so just keep her in your prayers I
[21:23] know you've done praise but remember
[21:24] little eggs and BB or of course you know
[21:28] Aces going through a lot of the
[21:30] Troublesome things but it's father and
[21:32] sister you know DB a little bit about
[21:35] crying and things like that so just just
[21:37] pray that God will you sisters will
[21:39] understand better than than anything
[21:41] else so you pray for her that the Lord
[21:43] will make all things wet right Wade's
[21:46] off preaching this weekend over at
[21:48] brother all things so just remember him
[21:50] and all I believe he's got all the
[21:52] announcements
[21:54] I generally forget something you know
[21:57] but if you like turning your scriptures
[21:58] turn to Revelations 3
[22:01] we read from Revelations 3 14 and then
[22:05] we'll read from John 1 1 through 3.
[22:11] Revelation 3 14. in John 1 1 through 3.
[22:19] father we thank you we love you and we
[22:21] ask you to just do one thing for us this
[22:23] day and that is that you would just come
[22:25] on the scene
[22:27] because Without You on the scene here
[22:29] with us it's just it's just meaningless
[22:31] Gathering a waste of time and effort and
[22:34] all to come together but if for you come
[22:36] to end into our midst and to speak to
[22:38] our hearts and lives and touch each and
[22:41] every one of us then it's a wonderful
[22:43] thing we ask you to take away all of the
[22:45] hendrixes this day we know there's many
[22:47] sicknesses Among Us and father we thank
[22:50] you that you are the Healer and we
[22:52] believe you we commit everything to you
[22:54] it's just give energy strength and
[22:56] whatever is necessary for these old
[22:58] bodies because we're not worried about
[23:00] them we don't let them rule us we rule
[23:03] over them by the spirit of your loving
[23:06] grace and have your way now forgive our
[23:08] sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[23:11] and bless us with your presence in Jesus
[23:14] name
[23:15] amen
[23:17] Revelation to your very familiar because
[23:19] this is the message to this age amen
[23:22] amen each Church age had a message
[23:25] all right
[23:26] but this church age has a very special
[23:29] message
[23:30] that was given unto us there's an Anna
[23:33] to the angel of the Church of the lady
[23:34] of Sia's right these sayings saith the
[23:37] amen the faithful and true witness the
[23:40] beginning of the creation of God
[23:46] then we go to John very familiar with
[23:48] all of us
[23:49] John 1 1 in the beginning was the word
[23:53] and the Word was with God and the Word
[23:55] was God the same was in the beginning
[23:58] with God all things were made by him and
[24:02] without him was not anything made that
[24:05] was made you may be seated the Lord had
[24:09] his Blessing to
[24:11] reading of the word
[24:13] now as I said at this age
[24:16] gets a special Revelation because it's
[24:18] the ending of all things
[24:20] and it gets the Revelation that we are
[24:25] to see almighty God
[24:28] come before us in our understanding by
[24:30] Revelation to be able to understand God
[24:34] and the way he does things and and all
[24:37] like that and thank God for the prophet
[24:40] who came to bring it because without
[24:41] that we wouldn't have anything anyway we
[24:44] would be just like all of the rest of
[24:46] the lady Lucia we would be out there
[24:48] playing with our minds and trying to do
[24:51] things and that's why we try our best to
[24:54] stay with what the prophet had to say
[24:57] and you know and doing it because that
[24:59] way we can we can at least say what he
[25:03] had to say about it
[25:05] but we know then that in our
[25:08] understanding because you know we still
[25:11] haven't left Heaven yet now so we've got
[25:13] a couple more messages so you know maybe
[25:15] two or three that we haven't left Heaven
[25:18] yet and we're going to try today to get
[25:20] into uh the things that happened in
[25:23] heaven
[25:24] and uh I'm trying to get you to see that
[25:27] heaven is real but I you know my point
[25:31] is one thing
[25:33] of every religion
[25:35] now listen of every religion of any form
[25:40] in the world
[25:42] there is a heaven or a place to go to
[25:46] right it doesn't matter what it is the
[25:50] only Indian had the Happy Hunting Ground
[25:52] the the Egyptians had these things it
[25:55] would carry them over into a falcon
[25:57] maybe would carry them through into
[25:59] another
[26:00] place and and things and they didn't
[26:04] believe that that man just died and was
[26:07] gone
[26:08] I'm just cool that's it well you're okay
[26:11] as long as you're alive but then you
[26:14] know why Mo you're gone that's why that
[26:16] even a an atheist would still want to
[26:19] look for a better place to live than
[26:21] besides what's here that's why I never
[26:23] have believed in atheists I believe in
[26:25] idiots but not atheists because you know
[26:28] if you believe that that there is no God
[26:30] then that makes you greater than the god
[26:33] that would be the creation of all things
[26:35] and see then that I just never believed
[26:38] it if I don't make no light of anybody
[26:39] because that's what everybody at least
[26:41] the Constitution allows us to believe
[26:44] what we want to believe now the Bible
[26:45] don't but the Constitution gives it to
[26:48] us so they can be what they want to and
[26:50] believe what they want to and everything
[26:51] like that just let me go on if I'm crazy
[26:53] let me just go on and be crazy you know
[26:57] and
[26:58] but I like what Paul said in the way
[27:00] that's called her if she was how he
[27:02] served God so that's what we're doing
[27:04] all right but now we believe in the
[27:07] the fact as I said this age gets the
[27:10] Revelation that he's the beginning of
[27:12] the creation of God
[27:14] all right and being the beginning of the
[27:16] creation of God is we'll get back to it
[27:18] a while in the quotes we know that the
[27:21] prophet said that makes a lot of people
[27:22] think
[27:23] that
[27:25] God created Jesus in other words and
[27:29] then Jesus created everything else he
[27:31] said making him lower than godhead and
[27:35] he said that's not correct that Jesus is
[27:38] almighty God or else he's the biggest
[27:41] deceiver that ever was okay amen but see
[27:45] being who he was he was able to
[27:47] condescend downward to reveal himself to
[27:51] us and that's what he's been trying to
[27:52] do he's been trying to to show himself
[27:55] to us by the creation you'll find it
[27:58] even in the Romans I gave these to
[28:01] Joseph he's not going to put them up
[28:02] Romans 1 and 20 that even the Eternal
[28:05] godhead
[28:06] can be understood by the things that we
[28:08] see
[28:09] that we're without an excuse that's
[28:11] right man well I've never seen God will
[28:14] look on the blood of Christ amen you
[28:16] breathing aren't you okay I mean you're
[28:19] alive aren't you
[28:21] well then why would you say that you've
[28:22] never seen God right right see we're not
[28:25] we're not in the right channel like the
[28:26] old brother said you know the little kid
[28:28] that couldn't get an answer from the
[28:30] preacher in the Sunday school teacher
[28:32] and all you know
[28:33] he said nobody can see God no fella you
[28:37] know he went fishing with him he said
[28:38] son said all I've ever seen all my life
[28:40] is God it's according to where you're
[28:42] looking from what you're doing okay if
[28:44] we look correctly we can see God in
[28:46] everything of life amen all right but
[28:50] see we we want to hold it to
[28:54] you know God is a spirit
[28:58] and then we like to go with the
[28:59] scriptures you know no man has seen God
[29:03] you know
[29:04] well I thought the Bible said though
[29:07] that the only begotten or the father
[29:09] come to declare or bring him out into
[29:13] the open to where that we could see God
[29:16] and like just recruiting I were talking
[29:18] this morning see that's what I'm trying
[29:20] to get you to see about heaven and leave
[29:23] all of this junk we think this is real
[29:25] but where did it come from
[29:28] it had to come from somewhere so it came
[29:30] from heaven
[29:31] all right we'll get to that in a minute
[29:33] but like we're saying this morning then
[29:34] see we say well God is a spirit
[29:38] but see as long as we're down here in
[29:40] this dimensional realms
[29:43] we read that if God is a spirit
[29:46] in our interpretation of that is what
[29:50] no form
[29:51] no doings no nothing he just
[29:55] blows around goes here and goes ironing
[29:59] on just floating around just what was it
[30:02] before well I went back there he was
[30:04] just nobody knows because we wasn't back
[30:07] there you know
[30:09] you know well we wouldn't back 20 years
[30:11] ago too much either but that's still no
[30:14] point but see we get our mind all set
[30:20] but
[30:21] if we like if it's true what we've been
[30:24] studying of Dimensions that that there's
[30:26] another dimension called the fourth
[30:27] dimension
[30:29] looks just right here with us with TV
[30:32] going right through here right now hey
[30:34] it's in another dimension it's what's
[30:36] something we can't see and we were
[30:38] talking last night Einstein said you
[30:40] could pass one object through the other
[30:42] object
[30:43] in the fourth dimension and and never
[30:46] make a hole in it
[30:47] he could see that
[30:49] he said run around shut up we should
[30:51] have been there
[30:52] when he spoke on his finite universe
[30:55] wait
[30:56] and things that he could see like Aaron
[30:59] was talking about see then Einstein
[31:02] proved that there was something pushing
[31:04] I mean he could prove that
[31:07] we thought no it's just nothing it's
[31:09] just no Force no nothing just floating
[31:11] around but Einstein could prove that
[31:13] there was something pushing
[31:15] he knew more than we would think about
[31:18] you know about it and I'm trying to get
[31:20] you to see that heaven is real right
[31:22] amen amen well in the dimension of
[31:24] Heaven as we call it which is not a
[31:26] dimension
[31:27] we went through that there's only seven
[31:29] dimensions the eighth would be Heaven
[31:31] which is not a dimension because the
[31:34] dimension signifies a a an area a space
[31:37] or something captivating it right and
[31:40] she whereas eternity would have to go
[31:42] beyond that to where there'd be no
[31:44] beginning and no ending to it and and
[31:46] then what if you were living there
[31:51] then the word Spirit would have a whole
[31:53] lot different meaning to it
[31:58] than I were experienced
[32:00] and we deal with Spooks we're afraid you
[32:02] know we see something
[32:03] you know
[32:05] you know a lot of it's our mind but it's
[32:09] real some of it is
[32:11] but get to point now we're trying to get
[32:13] to it see
[32:15] because even the Eternal godhead can be
[32:17] understood by the things we've seen we
[32:19] see out here at night see we see father
[32:21] we see something we see human we see
[32:23] there's that in the other so we can
[32:24] comprehend God all right now we read in
[32:28] the said in Revelations 3 14 that he was
[32:30] the beginning of the creation of God
[32:33] all right then it cannot be that God
[32:35] created Jesus and Jesus created
[32:36] something else that would make him lower
[32:39] than godhead right all right so he has
[32:42] to be the same one moving over in
[32:44] another form the Son of God had to be
[32:46] God in another form to create all right
[32:50] so then now we're getting to the
[32:51] scriptures or where it says and in
[32:54] Hebrews 1 and 2
[32:57] this by whom he made the world
[33:00] who's he talking about
[33:02] Jesus Christ now not Jesus the body
[33:06] right see that's where we connect to
[33:09] uh the reason I use Jesus Christ is
[33:10] because when I say Jesus Christ I mean
[33:12] almighty God now when I say Jesus I know
[33:15] how to say flesh right
[33:17] right I know how to say flesh you know
[33:19] what you're talking about but I'm
[33:20] talking about Jesus Christ I like it in
[33:22] Ephesians 3 and 9 where all things were
[33:25] created by Jesus Christ
[33:28] so what's your problem with the
[33:30] scriptures well if you just leave Jesus
[33:32] out of it see then you don't know what
[33:34] I'm talking about get a revelation pray
[33:36] for God and reveal it when I say Jesus
[33:39] Christ I'm talking about almighty God
[33:40] Amen
[33:42] not a second person or a daughter an
[33:44] idea or a concept and right there with
[33:46] you Colossians 1 and 16 says we're by
[33:49] him were all things create anything
[33:53] all right
[33:55] why can't we believe the scriptures
[33:59] see and like I told you there in John 1
[34:02] where it said in the beginning was the
[34:03] word word was with God see will you we
[34:05] don't use that word with it's not
[34:07] somebody's name beside of somebody
[34:10] why
[34:12] well that's her word I know it but we
[34:15] need a revelation
[34:17] we need a revelation more than anything
[34:19] so pray for a revelation all right now
[34:22] let's get down into something because I
[34:24] said we're still up in heaven now
[34:27] we haven't descended there's no World
[34:29] created there's no atmospheres there's
[34:31] no nothing we're still in heaven we've
[34:33] been there for how many minutes I don't
[34:35] know how many but we've got a couple
[34:37] more to go because we if we get to it
[34:39] this evening we want to talk about Sin
[34:41] originated in heaven
[34:44] now I want to ask you a simple question
[34:46] how can sin originate in heaven when if
[34:49] God is sees it the instant the prophet
[34:52] said in the presence of God he said one
[34:54] sin and you're gone you agree that's
[34:56] right you believe he said no fine just
[34:59] one Split Second
[35:01] well how is it that that could happen
[35:04] maybe God did have a plan and a purpose
[35:07] but when we might find out what sin is
[35:09] we might find out why you're a prophet
[35:11] kept saying sin is not drinking gambling
[35:13] smoking running around with wind you
[35:15] know when the lady finally said brother
[35:17] around I'm quite interested he said it's
[35:19] unbelief right right the disbelief God's
[35:23] word
[35:24] can be so simple
[35:27] until it we may find out that we're
[35:29] still in it
[35:30] all right now
[35:33] but let's talk about the creation
[35:37] because we're only going to be dealing
[35:38] today and this morning with the creation
[35:40] of angels we're going to run around City
[35:41] first made Angels no worship all right
[35:43] so now don't get on to anything else of
[35:45] creation
[35:47] just leave it where we're at hold it
[35:49] till we can get if I do at the end of it
[35:51] we'll try to drop down a little bit but
[35:53] stay with me
[35:54] because see I'm trying my best to get
[35:56] you not to see how smart I am or how
[35:59] much I can read or how much is going on
[36:01] if that's what you think you're in
[36:02] unbelief
[36:05] I ain't gonna back off that word
[36:09] it's your sin
[36:11] if you're unbelief
[36:13] because I'm not going to disbelieve you
[36:16] if you tell me God speaks to you and you
[36:17] can show me the word
[36:21] I'm not going to believe disbeliever
[36:22] don't donkey it told the truth that's
[36:24] right
[36:25] me so where do we get away from that to
[36:27] get down to it
[36:29] but a creation
[36:33] the word creation according to Webster
[36:36] is the act of creating
[36:41] the act of producing
[36:44] are causing to exist
[36:48] the word creation all right
[36:50] now
[36:51] to create
[36:53] well let's finish on creation a thing
[36:56] that is or has been created
[37:00] it can even be an original product
[37:04] of your mind
[37:07] huh
[37:08] now the word create is the cause to come
[37:10] into being
[37:12] as something what's unique
[37:14] that would not naturally evolve or that
[37:19] is not made by ordering by an ordinary
[37:22] process
[37:23] all right you understand this it's it's
[37:25] not something that that is a unique and
[37:28] something just happened is not the
[37:30] pollywog that fell over this way you
[37:31] laid so long then you fought back over
[37:33] this way you know who made the pollywog
[37:36] all right solves a problem but see we
[37:39] don't think those things
[37:41] see it's not just some ordinary process
[37:44] to create this to evolve from a person's
[37:47] own thought
[37:50] or imagination
[37:54] to create is to come from somebody's
[37:57] thought or imagination
[37:59] all right now we know that God cannot
[38:01] change his mind so his first thought
[38:04] about the creation would have to be
[38:06] perfect
[38:07] right because it was a thought from his
[38:09] mind all right now in your Strong's
[38:12] Concordance creation is uh 29 37 which
[38:17] is means creature
[38:19] it means creation it means to build
[38:23] it means the act of
[38:26] founding you know
[38:28] or establishing
[38:31] it means to build
[38:33] it means to bring in to being
[38:37] all right
[38:39] now
[38:40] so let's stay up in heaven
[38:43] and let's start off with some things
[38:46] that your Prophet said and you say well
[38:48] you just confused me by talking about
[38:51] heaven being real well now I'll remind
[38:54] you of what I said to start with the old
[38:56] man didn't have a half a hunting ground
[38:57] you know that's right everybody's got a
[39:00] place you want to go to
[39:02] I never have understood this one about
[39:04] the Atlantic see what that's their
[39:06] business that you know the guy goes
[39:08] there and he gets the guys in the
[39:09] morning it said diversions I never have
[39:11] figured out what the woman got because a
[39:12] lot of them dying now but that's just
[39:14] the point they still believe in a place
[39:16] to go
[39:17] everybody believes in a place to go
[39:19] somewhere once you leave here and you
[39:21] know there is a place to go to
[39:25] we're either going to enter the
[39:27] dimensions of the Lost are we going into
[39:29] the dimensions of them saved as we call
[39:32] it
[39:33] so we're going somewhere because the
[39:35] soul of man
[39:39] because only God can destroy the soul
[39:41] you can blow this body to Pieces but
[39:44] only God can destroy the soul all right
[39:47] now stay with me then as we're talking
[39:50] about in heaven well brother Dale you've
[39:52] never been there but now we've we've got
[39:54] some people that have been there
[39:57] now Paul said he was taken up to the
[39:59] third heaven right right and said he saw
[40:02] things it was not lawful to be said
[40:04] right
[40:06] but why can't we believe
[40:09] of a heaven now listen
[40:11] listen to this amen
[40:13] before you come into this message
[40:16] you believe what mama daddy preacher so
[40:18] and so so and so you read this that the
[40:20] other you believed in heaven
[40:22] why did you get in this message and quit
[40:24] believing in it
[40:29] what you've done
[40:31] you quit believing in
[40:33] it and everything because you're trying
[40:34] to give everything rationalized and
[40:36] bringing it down oh my brother daily
[40:38] comes right down here
[40:40] amen where does it come from okay
[40:45] where does the future home come from
[40:48] Heaven that's right
[40:50] that's right where's it being prepared
[40:52] for us in heaven
[40:55] well why can't we believe in a beautiful
[40:57] wonderful situation of looking at at
[41:01] Heaven as to be you know just Rolling
[41:03] Hills and wonderful things and trees and
[41:07] and Gardens and and all of the things
[41:10] see we're going to get out of a lot of
[41:12] quotes we were talking about some of
[41:14] them last night
[41:16] brother brother said one day he said
[41:18] Jesus will lead us up
[41:22] you gonna take one
[41:24] and he said we'll get down and say papa
[41:27] God
[41:31] why can't we believe that heaven is real
[41:36] she wanted the message hasn't taken that
[41:38] out of us
[41:39] but the preachers have
[41:43] they preached out of us some things that
[41:45] we did how that was truth
[41:56] that old brother died wanted to take
[41:58] some gold with him and said and she
[41:59] would just make it a joke
[42:03] I don't like that kind of joking
[42:07] I don't think that's right
[42:09] you know what they're saying well now he
[42:10] just wanted to take payment up there
[42:13] you know put down on the ground
[42:16] well why what's wrong with your
[42:17] mentality
[42:19] why would we want to even comprehend
[42:21] that
[42:23] the most beautiful I'll read to you
[42:24] later when we get on down in it the most
[42:26] beautiful places in the world that you
[42:28] could think of
[42:31] you just remember that ain't even a
[42:33] negative Harley as comparison to what
[42:35] heaven really is
[42:37] you showed me in the Bible where Heaven
[42:39] has ever done away oh but I got your
[42:42] scripture we've done been through it too
[42:44] the Bible said Heaven and Earth will
[42:46] pass away
[42:48] well
[42:51] did Heaven's going to pass away then
[42:52] Earth's going to pass away the same way
[42:55] so you better back off
[42:58] and brother Reynolds said the first
[43:01] Heaven is a millennium
[43:05] see we better back up and start
[43:08] listening and not get into the place
[43:10] listen to brother Branham sometimes when
[43:12] he talks about it is he making a light
[43:14] or is it a uh see well oh that's in the
[43:17] future home where he says that I want
[43:19] this little cabin down in the corner
[43:24] is it in the future home
[43:28] purged in heaven
[43:31] I can't get a quote there the other day
[43:33] and I'll give it back to you at the end
[43:34] of this where brother random on things
[43:36] that are to be which is 65 and future
[43:40] home was preached in 64 and brought
[43:42] around him in 65 is talking about a
[43:45] heaven on things that are to be and he
[43:47] said Heaven is a real place he said just
[43:49] like this is real he said we're going
[43:51] back to work
[43:54] don't you
[43:56] know what do you mean we're gonna work
[44:00] no
[44:02] we're gonna do what we want to do
[44:06] but see that's 1965.
[44:08] a year later he's still talking about
[44:10] going into heaven
[44:14] don't you think he'd want to go for a
[44:16] policy deterred
[44:19] don't you want to go see what we think
[44:21] well then what we're doing is we're just
[44:23] trying to be intellectual now I'm trying
[44:25] to bring it down to to tie it together
[44:28] with things here
[44:31] to where we could see it I'm not talking
[44:33] about this that God is real I mean that
[44:36] there's a God I'm talking about God
[44:37] being real
[44:39] I'm not talking about heaven it's just a
[44:41] place I'm talking about heaven being
[44:43] real I'm talking about the where we came
[44:46] from
[44:47] with heaven
[44:50] we'll get to it eventually we'll run
[44:51] around and see it
[44:53] what did he say he said that the seeds
[44:55] on this Earth was from another
[44:56] civilization
[45:00] a lot of people in the message believe
[45:03] that there was other worlds created
[45:05] there was other things created there was
[45:07] other people created I mean even in the
[45:09] message people
[45:11] if there was more people created than
[45:13] Adam and Eve
[45:16] but I got one scripture for you because
[45:18] the Bible said he's the mother of all
[45:19] living so you better back off right so
[45:22] that's what I'm saying I just want the
[45:23] Bible all right but what's your problem
[45:27] If Heaven has trees and grass and
[45:30] all kind of beautiful roses and and
[45:33] things like that and fire Gardens well
[45:36] why couldn't God when he created this
[45:38] world just reach down and get a handful
[45:40] of seed and sprinkle it on the earth
[45:41] when he created it where it becoming
[45:43] from that Civilization all right that's
[45:45] right
[45:46] right right
[45:49] not a bunch of monkeys climbing up in
[45:51] the tree somewheres after another planet
[45:57] not extraterrestrial beings
[46:00] I have enough trouble with the ones on
[46:02] Earth all right never run into one of
[46:04] them out there
[46:06] and like I told them last night we're
[46:07] talking about it sure is odd how that
[46:09] these people get picked up by these
[46:10] things and I'm not saying something
[46:12] don't happen
[46:13] which you know they can always talk to
[46:15] him
[46:17] you know I never thought of that
[46:20] oh there's so much Superior
[46:27] I thought I wrote around and said the
[46:28] Son of God had more at the market than
[46:30] even an angel
[46:32] where's our scriptures and what we're
[46:34] doing
[46:35] but listen
[46:36] I like the way brother random talks
[46:42] look at number one on your nose which is
[46:43] taken from
[46:45] I mean you would have with someone who's
[46:46] free but we're trying to save and cut
[46:48] back a little
[46:50] because you're gonna have your hand
[46:51] trying to read and up on your reading it
[46:54] appreciate brother Joe when and Richard
[46:57] and them doing it they said it's gonna
[46:58] get involved in a
[47:01] Brother Anderson all to get involved in
[47:03] this we got enough computer guys to to
[47:05] handle the things and they could take
[47:07] your time about but look what brother
[47:09] Randall said on a message called who is
[47:11] this Melchizedek
[47:13] in 1965 221 the evening service
[47:19] I you recalled I just gave it to you
[47:21] because he's talking about the thoughts
[47:23] the attributes and the things of being
[47:25] expressed all right
[47:27] and secondly he become the word Saint
[47:30] John the first chapter in the first
[47:31] verse noticed is in the beginning
[47:34] but before the eternal
[47:40] now your mind there is no way to
[47:44] comprehend what that Prophet has just
[47:47] said right
[47:49] we are gradually beginning to understand
[47:52] the word Eternal but we can't know
[47:55] really know it
[47:57] but we've used it so long until it's
[48:00] become a part of us
[48:04] um
[48:06] at the grace
[48:08] she could stand up back there and she
[48:10] could say
[48:12] pneumonia
[48:15] now she's four years old
[48:19] if you can't spell it
[48:22] she don't know what it is to her it
[48:25] might be a guitar or a horse to ride
[48:27] and I never have figured out how they
[48:29] started off with a p I won't start it
[48:32] off with an end
[48:33] if it's pneumonia
[48:37] um
[48:37] you understand yes
[48:40] we can do a lot of yaka Yaki from cause
[48:42] we've been trained
[48:45] all of our Lives we've been trained and
[48:48] told these things
[48:50] well then it's hard to get away from
[48:54] what mama told us mama told us that hell
[48:56] was eternal
[49:00] it's hard to get away from that
[49:02] right
[49:03] mama told I'm not doing it for Mama I'm
[49:05] just using that Daddy what are you going
[49:06] to do on a claims what
[49:09] but they told us that they were three
[49:11] gods
[49:14] but nobody now son understands
[49:18] you've got to know that we're talking
[49:20] about something special but this is just
[49:22] what I see that is God in three persons
[49:25] Blessed Trinity
[49:28] ain't no problem
[49:32] the Lord not in me in the English
[49:34] language
[49:35] not being any language in the world
[49:39] but yet you go down and talk to somebody
[49:41] and they'll start telling you about the
[49:43] they'll start telling you if we believe
[49:44] the end of the world is here and you
[49:46] just mentioned a few words and say
[49:47] something about God
[49:48] nobody don't understand
[49:56] according to the Bible that says the
[49:57] Eternal godhead could be understood by
[49:59] the things we see
[50:02] where are we at well what's he saying
[50:10] in the beginning but before the Eternal
[50:13] notice in the beginning was the word
[50:15] when the time began it was word
[50:20] all right
[50:22] but before it was word it was attribute
[50:24] or thought then it was expressed in the
[50:27] beginning was the expression the word
[50:30] now we're getting where Melchizedek is
[50:33] that's the mysterious person in the
[50:35] beginning was the word and the Word was
[50:37] with God and the Word was God and then
[50:39] the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[50:41] hold that that point there
[50:45] he is being with Spirit see okay spirit
[50:52] God Supernatural all right the great
[50:56] Eternal second he began to form himself
[50:58] toward flesh in the theophany it's
[51:00] called the word a body
[51:01] this then is the same state he was in
[51:03] when he met Abraham when it was called
[51:05] Melchizedek he was in the form of
[51:07] theophany now we get to that and prove
[51:09] it
[51:09] but see what's my point
[51:12] we say in the beginning was the word
[51:18] now remember brother Brown was saying in
[51:20] the beginning before the eternal
[51:27] but there was never a Time
[51:30] if the word is eternal there was never a
[51:33] time that the word didn't exist
[51:37] if it didn't did not exist and came into
[51:40] being it's some secondary
[51:43] right simple
[51:46] it would be a different God
[51:49] so it was never a time that he wasn't
[51:51] the word
[51:54] there was never a time that he wasn't
[51:56] father son the Holy Ghost and all the
[51:58] attributes he or savior where did he get
[52:01] them from
[52:02] what is that no no when you got here it
[52:04] just like that
[52:08] but you see
[52:12] we think we understand
[52:16] we think we've got it figured out after
[52:18] the prophet has said all of this so long
[52:19] we think we've got it figured out but
[52:21] remember he said in the beginning
[52:24] but before the Eternal right so there's
[52:28] a lot to the beginning
[52:30] to be considered
[52:34] a lot of things that we've got to
[52:36] comprehend
[52:38] to be able to understand
[52:43] so then let's lay aside our thoughts
[52:46] except God's word and believe it and
[52:50] pray for a revelation
[52:53] I thought that's what we needed right
[52:55] amen
[52:57] all right
[53:00] so then what is it then
[53:02] was there ever a time that God didn't
[53:04] exist
[53:07] he wasn't God now you don't understand
[53:10] he wasn't God because God is an object
[53:13] to worship
[53:17] you mean he wasn't God
[53:23] you ever noticed brother random could be
[53:24] able to quote this picture
[53:30] and he'd say in the beginning
[53:33] Elohim
[53:35] created the heavens and the Earth right
[53:39] not not that that dog brother Dale it
[53:42] wasn't out of him it was logos
[53:46] see we think we've got it all going
[53:50] run around could get over to John 1 1.
[53:54] you say in the beginning Elohim
[53:58] was with Elohim and Elohim was Elohim
[54:02] and then Elohim was made flesh and dwell
[54:04] Among Us you know what he's still Elohim
[54:07] he's just not existing alone
[54:12] he's the same I want him that exists
[54:14] existed along but now you're just with
[54:16] his people so he receives more under
[54:18] more titles that's why you get in
[54:21] Genesis he begins to call him Lord God
[54:25] Jehovah Elohim one of the causes
[54:28] signifying the father with his family
[54:29] right
[54:31] but he's already started creating
[54:33] you see when we say no you you don't
[54:35] understand he's not God
[54:42] see that's what we get all tied up and
[54:44] think we know
[54:47] there was never a time that he was from
[54:48] God there was never a time that he
[54:51] wasn't a father
[54:52] there was never a time that he wasn't a
[54:55] Healer now can't be causing nothing sick
[54:58] that's a display
[55:01] right
[55:02] a lot of difference between what you are
[55:04] in a display that's right
[55:07] I mean my kids are a display
[55:12] right but what do we understand
[55:23] what do we understand
[55:26] look at the next one
[55:29] Christ's mystery God reveal 1963.
[55:32] 728.
[55:34] paragraph 102 103 104.
[55:39] may God's Great secret he had before the
[55:42] world began
[55:43] now back in the back part of God's mind
[55:46] I like that
[55:49] how about a prophet that could go into
[55:51] the back part of God's mind
[55:57] but now he tells us what's back there
[55:59] why can't we as peanut brain the idiots
[56:01] understand what he said about what was
[56:04] back there
[56:09] but back in the back part of God's mind
[56:11] there was something that he was trying
[56:13] and was going to achieve and he had a
[56:16] motive in doing it
[56:18] what's his motive in order to let
[56:20] himself be expressed because first there
[56:23] wasn't even a Moon Star at a molecule or
[56:27] anything
[56:29] he was God
[56:31] now see but he actually wasn't God at
[56:34] that time because God is an object
[56:37] divert worship and there wasn't nothing
[56:39] to worship Him
[56:41] what does it mean he wasn't God
[56:44] maybe there's nothing to worship
[56:46] so in his great mind he wanted these
[56:48] attributes to be expressed and then him
[56:50] would love and him was to be father and
[56:53] him was to be son and him was to be a
[56:54] savior and him was to be a Healer and
[56:57] all these great attributes that we see
[56:59] already expressed they were in God
[57:03] again
[57:06] would you see there wasn't displayed
[57:10] if you add an attribute to god what have
[57:12] you done
[57:13] he never gained attributes coming this
[57:15] way he displayed attributes coming this
[57:16] way
[57:18] that's why if we all if we have eternal
[57:20] life the eternal life we have would
[57:22] always love eternal
[57:26] there was a time we didn't have it we
[57:27] had to receive it here but as far as God
[57:29] is concerned it always was eternal
[57:31] because it's his own life amen all right
[57:35] short of my opinion listen the first
[57:37] thing he made was angels
[57:40] and then they worshiped him
[57:43] and that made him God then he started
[57:45] from there as in previous message and
[57:47] I've tried to explain it break it down
[57:48] now then when Angels begin to worship
[57:51] Him
[57:52] and watch that was before there was even
[57:57] a molecule in the Earth
[58:01] now where were the Angels created
[58:06] all right
[58:07] are we reading it
[58:09] that was before there were before there
[58:12] was even a molecule in the Earth there
[58:15] was nothing it was all Darkness there
[58:18] wasn't no sun
[58:20] nor no moon
[58:22] no stars no nothing
[58:25] then he was God
[58:27] and he asked job where were you when I
[58:29] laid the foundation of the world and
[58:30] when he started saying together the sons
[58:31] of God shouted before that was way back
[58:33] before the Earth
[58:36] so his first creation was angels and
[58:38] then we'll get to it in the next message
[58:39] where his first creation is himself
[58:43] you say well how could God be created
[58:45] when God's God
[58:48] well that's what your Prophet said
[58:51] he said God's first creation was God
[58:52] himself
[58:55] so what's he saying
[58:58] he's saying the Eternal God
[59:01] that can in no way be comprehended is
[59:03] going to condescend
[59:06] into another form right
[59:09] the word that we can begin to even
[59:11] comprehend anything whatsoever about the
[59:15] self-existing one
[59:19] he's going to bring it down
[59:22] he's going to come down
[59:24] but now remember
[59:26] the first thing he created was angels
[59:32] that was in heaven
[59:35] before the Earth Moon Stars etc etc we
[59:39] just read it off the quote
[59:42] ever come into being
[59:47] so his first Creation With Angels
[59:51] see we look at our angels and we saw
[59:53] yeah what are you doing he created this
[59:56] he's got these fluffing wings and we
[59:57] flop over here and we flock over there
[59:59] we flop all around you know
[1:00:02] and then now you go down to buy you a uh
[1:00:05] Christmas scene you know with the baby
[1:00:08] Jesus
[1:00:09] and you'll find that unless you've got
[1:00:12] to find her something original or
[1:00:14] something part you'll find that they've
[1:00:16] got a little angel sitting in there
[1:00:20] and you know who that is
[1:00:22] that's Gloria
[1:00:25] a female angel
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:30] see because they're getting that in your
[1:00:32] mind
[1:00:34] I ain't no women angel I saw one
[1:00:38] I played with one when I was a little
[1:00:41] kid
[1:00:42] it was in my little T-shirt party
[1:00:46] Gloria
[1:00:48] and when I get there I want to talk to
[1:00:50] delivery
[1:00:52] you say silliness that's not silliness
[1:00:54] I'm telling it like it is you know that
[1:00:58] we're trained in our mind the way
[1:01:00] mankind wants us to be trained
[1:01:06] right
[1:01:07] come on
[1:01:09] you're serious about it okay
[1:01:13] in the beginning before the eternal
[1:01:19] let's go down to that one man so we got
[1:01:21] we got it in this nation let's go on
[1:01:22] down to number three
[1:01:25] I got 21 1953 729 questions and answers
[1:01:29] on Genesis
[1:01:31] and watch it if God created man in his
[1:01:33] own image and his own Emmy on likeness
[1:01:36] what kind of a man did he create
[1:01:39] a spirit man
[1:01:41] that's right okay God's just a spirit
[1:01:44] but we're just the spirit
[1:01:49] I thought their Spirit man went into the
[1:01:51] garden and control the animals
[1:01:58] come on
[1:02:00] what was your spirit
[1:02:02] they
[1:02:03] which race it is
[1:02:05] now if you'll notice after he'd made all
[1:02:07] the creation and created Spirit man
[1:02:09] because reading of this now to the one
[1:02:11] that asked the question will find this
[1:02:13] that God gave Dominion to the of the
[1:02:15] cattle and the fishes and everything to
[1:02:17] the man
[1:02:18] but in his making of dire he made man in
[1:02:23] his own image
[1:02:25] to lead the cattle lead the Beast to the
[1:02:28] field just like the Holy Spirit leads
[1:02:30] the believer today but in his making of
[1:02:33] their
[1:02:34] you don't fall and Reb run around you
[1:02:36] just read over it
[1:02:39] read very carefully
[1:02:41] dissect every word
[1:02:44] he was in other words Adam
[1:02:47] the first man in the Lord creation of
[1:02:49] God
[1:02:51] the first creation was God himself
[1:02:58] now hold on
[1:03:03] don't say that slow guys let's read the
[1:03:05] rest of the wording read it right off
[1:03:07] the screen
[1:03:08] no what'd you say
[1:03:11] he was in other words Adam the first man
[1:03:14] and Lord creation of God the first
[1:03:16] creation was God himself
[1:03:20] then out of God came to logos
[1:03:29] which was the son of God
[1:03:32] then out of the law gosh which was the
[1:03:34] word in the beginning which the word and
[1:03:35] words with God the word was gone and the
[1:03:37] words would make flesh and dwell Among
[1:03:39] Us
[1:03:39] out of the little guys came forth the
[1:03:41] man bring him on down
[1:03:44] but look at it read it
[1:03:47] how can God be created
[1:03:53] see because our word creation
[1:03:56] is to take something and make something
[1:04:00] right right
[1:04:03] you take metal you make a car
[1:04:06] you take wood you make a house
[1:04:09] so then we look at what well what do you
[1:04:12] mean brother Dale because that would
[1:04:14] mean God was was was back dire and and
[1:04:17] and
[1:04:20] how could he be a creation
[1:04:23] we'll go talk to the prophet
[1:04:25] you say you believe we'll get to that
[1:04:27] this afternoon let's see if we believe
[1:04:29] I'll run around said
[1:04:31] you know we don't believe all brother
[1:04:32] Brown said you know what that is s-i-n
[1:04:38] but you confused me I just don't
[1:04:40] understand no I didn't confuse you
[1:04:41] you're more than confused so don't blame
[1:04:43] me all right we were all born confused
[1:04:47] we've all been trained confused we've
[1:04:50] all been taught confusion
[1:04:52] God is trying to get that out of us
[1:04:54] right
[1:04:56] you mean you're talking about a Rapture
[1:04:58] but you don't know where you're going
[1:05:01] to work on hyper Rapture when he said
[1:05:03] but I guess we play hard when we get on
[1:05:06] because you know the old mythology sword
[1:05:08] Dukes you know whatever they're rolling
[1:05:10] the ball involved and that's what
[1:05:12] thunder and lightning is you know the
[1:05:13] old mythologies when they roll the
[1:05:15] bowling ball it hits the pin that's the
[1:05:16] underlying it are we still in mythology
[1:05:22] are we talking about revelation
[1:05:25] I don't like you and your attitude
[1:05:27] please God pray for my attitude but what
[1:05:30] does the word say
[1:05:32] all right
[1:05:34] I don't like your attitude either
[1:05:36] so we don't love each other that way we
[1:05:39] love each other's Brothers and Sisters
[1:05:40] in Christ
[1:05:42] right right
[1:05:44] you see
[1:05:46] because you know brother Dale is one
[1:05:47] thing he's gonna do it he's going to
[1:05:48] tell you I can hear they're gonna quote
[1:05:49] brother random
[1:05:52] ly you said which if you don't quote all
[1:05:53] it bring it to me
[1:05:56] bring it to me that's the internet
[1:05:58] worldwide anywhere send it to me that
[1:06:01] I'm not saying what wrote around them
[1:06:02] says
[1:06:03] because this is time to quit playing
[1:06:05] these little sugar tits and and be kind
[1:06:07] to everybody and nice
[1:06:09] all right
[1:06:10] I love to be nice
[1:06:13] but I know what my father is trying his
[1:06:15] best to do
[1:06:16] if we're going to that set in a Rapture
[1:06:18] where are we going
[1:06:21] well I really don't know I don't really
[1:06:22] care I just want to go
[1:06:25] well why run around and spend all the
[1:06:27] time telling us about the places we
[1:06:28] could go to
[1:06:30] I think we could take 100 million year
[1:06:33] trip and just walk through the portals
[1:06:35] and the beautiful places you know
[1:06:42] so we use our flimsy excuses
[1:06:45] how is God a creation
[1:06:48] all you can say out of that is one thing
[1:06:50] what
[1:06:52] God
[1:06:53] Almighty you should call it spirit
[1:06:57] begin to
[1:07:00] condescend what other word can I use
[1:07:03] downwardly
[1:07:05] to where that the human being could
[1:07:08] eventually have some idea about God
[1:07:15] now
[1:07:16] so we're back where we started that so
[1:07:18] his first creation is angels
[1:07:23] whose first creation is angels
[1:07:28] what is an angel
[1:07:32] wings
[1:07:34] and then Gloria's got her wings no there
[1:07:36] ain't no such thing as male or female
[1:07:38] angels
[1:07:40] they're all into the masculine form of
[1:07:42] looking but they have no
[1:07:45] masculinity you understand the words
[1:07:48] without being blunt
[1:07:51] they have no reproductive systems they
[1:07:54] have no things to be done because it
[1:07:56] wasn't made that away
[1:07:58] but they are real
[1:08:04] wormwood
[1:08:07] destroyed the world with water
[1:08:11] you remember about a random like
[1:08:13] countdown to the different things
[1:08:14] wormwood come up for and they was down
[1:08:15] to three who grew children were down
[1:08:17] there in the furry furnaces and look
[1:08:19] I'll watch this thing off one time
[1:08:20] letting me loose
[1:08:22] is that fire I ain't gonna bother him
[1:08:24] let her just turned me loose
[1:08:28] the angels are real
[1:08:30] now they are not human
[1:08:34] they have no gender to the point of they
[1:08:37] look masculine
[1:08:40] because they're into the image of the
[1:08:43] God who was creating them
[1:08:46] you agree
[1:08:50] so when he created them
[1:08:53] right around showing an angel walk in
[1:08:55] the room with him
[1:08:57] he didn't have wings right
[1:09:05] would you say that's what we were like
[1:09:06] well brother they don't understand
[1:09:07] they'd rather have wings to do because
[1:09:09] brother Brown saw them going up top to
[1:09:11] her and they were swings
[1:09:14] yeah because that's the way they were
[1:09:16] showing they're saying
[1:09:19] the angel of the Lord came down and
[1:09:21] talked to a man and a woman one day
[1:09:23] right
[1:09:26] not with wings
[1:09:27] a man
[1:09:30] and the Bible said he doesn't marvelous
[1:09:32] works because he went right into the
[1:09:34] fire
[1:09:35] and went right back out
[1:09:40] angels are real
[1:09:42] yes
[1:09:45] now we know that
[1:09:47] brother Brown will give you and why he
[1:09:49] says I don't understand
[1:09:51] and I never have understood it but I'll
[1:09:53] give you I quote it with you brother
[1:09:55] Randall will automatically 99 of the
[1:09:57] time say that two-thirds of the Angels
[1:10:01] accepted Satan's lie and failed
[1:10:04] the Bible says one-third now while he
[1:10:06] said that that's no big it's just to me
[1:10:07] I'm an entrepreneur I'm just telling you
[1:10:09] this sir because somebody come along and
[1:10:11] say well I didn't see that no I don't
[1:10:15] think he was changing the Bible
[1:10:21] but what was the purpose according to
[1:10:23] the scriptures or the creation of angels
[1:10:27] the Bible calls a ministering spirits
[1:10:31] made for what purpose
[1:10:34] why do the Angels come into being back
[1:10:36] there well they come into being to
[1:10:38] worship Him
[1:10:39] is that all they have
[1:10:41] the Bible says there are ministering
[1:10:43] Spirits right to minister to the hours
[1:10:46] of salvation
[1:10:49] run around and said ever
[1:10:52] Born Again believer has an angel
[1:11:01] you see
[1:11:03] but what does it matter see we get so
[1:11:05] caught up into two thirds or one-thirds
[1:11:07] until we we lose the whole thing
[1:11:09] we'll run around must not have been a
[1:11:11] prophet because he contrary to the Bible
[1:11:13] because it says one one third and he
[1:11:14] said two-thirds
[1:11:16] yeah according to Matthew Martin Luke
[1:11:19] and John there were two Blind Men in one
[1:11:20] place and one blind man another place
[1:11:25] are you saying they got naturally
[1:11:26] confused no it's not what they saw
[1:11:29] they wrote what they saw
[1:11:32] what do you understand what I'm getting
[1:11:33] at
[1:11:34] angels are real
[1:11:37] they're in another dimension
[1:11:41] right right
[1:11:43] and they're real
[1:11:46] all right we'll get to this later
[1:11:50] the ones who fail
[1:11:52] do not minister to the hours of
[1:11:55] righteousness
[1:11:56] they pervert our nature amen said
[1:12:01] and he even says that they come and take
[1:12:04] up on themselves human
[1:12:10] but you better read on because he said
[1:12:12] we don't believe in that doctrine that
[1:12:15] the Angels created bodies and stepped
[1:12:18] into them
[1:12:21] so there's a lot right around the stairs
[1:12:23] that we need to sit down and just think
[1:12:26] a minute
[1:12:27] and ask the Holy Spirit to tell us amen
[1:12:31] so what was his first creation
[1:12:33] well then before there was any world
[1:12:35] before there was any molecules before
[1:12:37] there were any atoms before anything so
[1:12:40] it must have been up in heaven
[1:12:43] and how long were they there
[1:12:45] because there's no record of time
[1:12:47] whether it be two seconds or 10 trillion
[1:12:49] trillion trillion trillion three
[1:12:50] trillion years it wouldn't make no
[1:12:51] difference
[1:12:53] they was there
[1:12:55] right and they worshiped God
[1:13:01] borders on the evening message so I'll
[1:13:03] just say a few words
[1:13:07] see then Satan got exalted
[1:13:13] little brown said he got jealous
[1:13:20] now
[1:13:21] let's back up
[1:13:24] God's first creation is God himself
[1:13:30] meaning simply he's trying to condescend
[1:13:33] word
[1:13:34] then the second form of God that we see
[1:13:37] because we don't believe in
[1:13:38] trinitarianism we believe in God in
[1:13:39] another form would be coming down to the
[1:13:42] low gospel need the Son of God in
[1:13:45] another form
[1:13:46] now according to the Bible that we've
[1:13:49] just read
[1:13:50] and you I hope you don't need all right
[1:13:51] around would have to say about it that
[1:13:53] Jesus Christ created all things and
[1:13:56] Jesus Christ is the son of God
[1:13:59] I said Jesus Christ not flesh
[1:14:02] that's why when he stood on the earth
[1:14:03] what did Peter say Thy Art the Christ
[1:14:09] when you get over into Luke it's a dark
[1:14:11] the Christ of God
[1:14:15] gave me another God
[1:14:18] there's God in another form
[1:14:22] all right who created the angels
[1:14:27] God in another form called the word
[1:14:32] he simply said let there be an angels
[1:14:35] appeared
[1:14:38] for millions of years those angels could
[1:14:42] worship him in the beauties of Heaven
[1:14:45] no Darkness we just read what your
[1:14:47] Prophet said no nothing no molecules no
[1:14:50] nothing we're still up in eternity in
[1:14:52] heaven
[1:14:53] we got to stay up there until sin
[1:14:55] originates and then it gets kicked out
[1:15:00] but you see
[1:15:03] Jesus Christ was that word
[1:15:06] that began to create as your Prophet
[1:15:08] would tell you on questions and answers
[1:15:10] on Genesis if you listen to that tape he
[1:15:12] said then we see him he said like a
[1:15:14] little Halo of light comes out he said
[1:15:16] what is that he said that's God in
[1:15:17] another form
[1:15:20] called word
[1:15:21] that he begins to create
[1:15:25] and as you begin to create
[1:15:27] the first thing he created was angels
[1:15:33] now
[1:15:36] who was that that created angels
[1:15:40] why did Satan get upset with him
[1:15:44] remember when Satan then he was the
[1:15:45] anointed Europe stood right beside the
[1:15:48] Lord he was God's right-hand man the
[1:15:50] only thing that was kept from him was
[1:15:52] creation
[1:15:53] right I'm calling him right around him
[1:15:55] you know that's true the only thing that
[1:15:57] was kept from Lucifer was creation
[1:15:59] he could pass out Supernatural gifts
[1:16:02] you could do all kind of signs and
[1:16:04] wonders
[1:16:07] that's what your Prophet is saying
[1:16:10] but he can't create
[1:16:17] it took him no telling how long
[1:16:22] to be able to see those angels
[1:16:27] but he finally deceived
[1:16:31] at least we know a third of them
[1:16:36] I have to ask the people last night
[1:16:38] because these were a lot of questions
[1:16:39] they were asking
[1:16:42] how is it that God
[1:16:47] would not see what Lucifer was doing
[1:16:49] don't you think his omniscience
[1:16:52] would let him know
[1:16:54] don't you know that when he created the
[1:16:56] angels and he created Lucifer don't you
[1:16:59] know that when he created him he knew
[1:17:01] what he would do
[1:17:05] but still sin in the presence of God
[1:17:07] that's why we can't do it now there's
[1:17:08] got to be a bump of blood
[1:17:11] sin in the presence of God one second
[1:17:13] he'd annihilate us
[1:17:15] I don't care how goody goody You Think
[1:17:16] You Are
[1:17:18] we're still sinners
[1:17:22] now
[1:17:24] so why can't
[1:17:28] Lucifer and the angels That Got Away
[1:17:30] into this and if it was billions of
[1:17:32] years and they just went out and they
[1:17:34] they began to form little groups and
[1:17:36] little clicks and little things kind of
[1:17:38] like a church sometimes you know little
[1:17:39] click little groups and little things
[1:17:41] and then they just
[1:17:44] I'll get back to seeing into that more
[1:17:46] on sin but you know
[1:17:51] but one day it finally come to a place
[1:17:56] that God wouldn't stand it no longer
[1:18:01] so he cast him out
[1:18:03] and who cast him out
[1:18:08] right
[1:18:10] which is Christ
[1:18:11] right
[1:18:13] The Book of Revelations 12 we'll get
[1:18:15] back to you that
[1:18:16] just laying the little things into your
[1:18:18] mind for this afternoon
[1:18:22] see then
[1:18:24] what killed
[1:18:27] in other words you understand what I
[1:18:29] mean he understands God and the Earth
[1:18:32] the annuals
[1:18:34] he knows what you're doing
[1:18:37] but what if he went over and said
[1:18:40] all that except that liar dead
[1:18:44] it would have been done right
[1:18:46] so now you can do what you want to do
[1:18:48] with my carnalities and my way of
[1:18:49] looking thing but some way God turned
[1:18:51] his mind right
[1:18:56] he turned away right
[1:18:58] now I'm talking about all Mighty
[1:19:00] self-existing
[1:19:03] because he had one standing there in
[1:19:05] another form right that could protect
[1:19:07] him amen you know that Michael kept them
[1:19:09] from being destroyed
[1:19:19] right right when Adam and Eve had sinned
[1:19:23] and God the Bible says came down every
[1:19:26] day and walked in the midst of the
[1:19:28] garden
[1:19:29] is that right
[1:19:32] and Eve committed sin
[1:19:35] and how long it was five minutes
[1:19:38] whatever it was she took it to Adam and
[1:19:42] Adam took the sin
[1:19:44] what kept her from being destroyed
[1:19:51] why would he be that God would come down
[1:19:53] and run around and see us
[1:19:55] and say Adam
[1:19:57] Adam where are them
[1:20:01] now don't you know that he known
[1:20:06] but that's not part of the story that's
[1:20:08] right it the part of the story they had
[1:20:11] to be a fall to do that God had to turn
[1:20:13] his way turn away from him and allow
[1:20:16] this to build to a certain place and
[1:20:18] then when it did Michael says that's it
[1:20:20] now I never have believed in fighting in
[1:20:23] heaven now you can believe all you want
[1:20:25] to in all your karates and all of this
[1:20:27] that and the other I don't believe it
[1:20:30] I believe one day Michael called the
[1:20:32] ground and he said hold it
[1:20:36] let's succeed
[1:20:38] you wouldn't say even on a joke
[1:20:42] no more room for you here
[1:20:46] now remember we read a quote that
[1:20:49] brother Branham said the angels and
[1:20:51] things were created before anything come
[1:20:53] into Egypt he said it was Darkness
[1:20:57] now there's no darkness in heaven
[1:20:59] so we must have been talking about some
[1:21:01] more than that
[1:21:02] but he said it was Darkness
[1:21:07] so that's what Michael said
[1:21:10] to Outer Northwest
[1:21:15] he couldn't fight him
[1:21:19] you can't do it now you remember in the
[1:21:21] Book of Daniel
[1:21:23] before Gabriel could come to Daniel
[1:21:24] Michael had to come to the aid of
[1:21:26] Gabriel and Gabriel is a great Angel Arc
[1:21:28] the Archangel that delivers the messages
[1:21:30] of the coming Messiah Etc all of that
[1:21:33] but he wasn't no match for the devil
[1:21:36] but Michael came to his Aid I love what
[1:21:40] it said it says you're a prince
[1:21:45] Michael came okay
[1:21:46] and stopped it
[1:21:48] Gabriel could come on
[1:21:51] to Daniel
[1:21:53] that's right see we're not out of the
[1:21:54] Bible
[1:21:56] we're giving illustrations and doing
[1:21:59] things
[1:22:00] but we'll pick that one up right there
[1:22:02] this afternoon
[1:22:06] but let's back up there now
[1:22:11] let's back up to where and we get back
[1:22:15] to the creation
[1:22:17] of the Angels
[1:22:21] and we see that they could worship Him
[1:22:22] and there was a wonderful thing
[1:22:25] those angels were busying themselves all
[1:22:27] over heaven
[1:22:28] performing chores do anything
[1:22:32] well what kind of chores would need to
[1:22:33] be done
[1:22:34] I don't know The Profit was going
[1:22:37] to work when we get there
[1:22:40] yeah but I I believe in his own way we
[1:22:42] didn't work so you're lazy
[1:22:45] sorry
[1:22:46] the Dale's too blind I know you just
[1:22:49] flat lazy now that's why you want to go
[1:22:51] to a place somewhere to lay up let some
[1:22:52] angels feed
[1:22:58] and she was because it's exposing you
[1:23:01] and me
[1:23:04] like I told the doctor the other day I
[1:23:06] said listen doctor
[1:23:07] he said Sam said we're running these
[1:23:09] tests I said let me tell you something
[1:23:12] I said you're gaining ground getting to
[1:23:15] the place
[1:23:17] and I said this is only about that Satan
[1:23:19] has been able to conquer me in the flesh
[1:23:22] when I'm getting over it
[1:23:26] but I said you're gonna get ground one
[1:23:27] of these days and you'll know what I'm
[1:23:28] talking about
[1:23:30] I said I'm 70 years old I said if I sit
[1:23:32] down I will draw up and die
[1:23:36] listen no sorry
[1:23:39] I will keep going and all the energy
[1:23:41] I've got Within Me
[1:23:49] you sit down you're gonna die
[1:23:53] old Undertaker
[1:23:55] you know like brother Tom sitting one
[1:23:57] over there
[1:23:58] he reached them to get them old people
[1:24:01] what arm you know and he's shaking
[1:24:03] he said just lay around take it easy now
[1:24:05] you know you you read you were Rich you
[1:24:07] spent your life you know and I'll she'll
[1:24:09] now just take it easy well he's the
[1:24:12] Undertaker
[1:24:15] he wants you to die
[1:24:19] I said get up
[1:24:22] my wife will tell you that this is not a
[1:24:24] lazy man
[1:24:25] I'm up and going because I'm not going
[1:24:27] to let Satan get this body he's gonna
[1:24:30] fight me for it
[1:24:32] keep on going keep kicking all right
[1:24:37] but let's back up there
[1:24:40] and let's look at this place
[1:24:43] remember my point now
[1:24:46] Angels were created while God was still
[1:24:49] in heaven
[1:24:54] um
[1:24:56] so now let's read some of the things
[1:24:57] right around there to say
[1:24:59] time just a few minutes then we'll quit
[1:25:03] number five four on the notes for the
[1:25:06] joke
[1:25:09] questions and answers on Genesis
[1:25:15] paragraph 28 excuse me let me give him a
[1:25:18] glass of Acts 26.
[1:25:22] now no man has seen the father at any
[1:25:24] time
[1:25:26] see we just read over these we just pass
[1:25:28] them
[1:25:29] but listen to your Prophet describing
[1:25:31] something
[1:25:32] no man has seen God seen God in the
[1:25:36] bodily form
[1:25:40] do you know what you're saying when the
[1:25:42] scripture says no man is seen the father
[1:25:43] any time what does it mean
[1:25:45] what nobody seen it
[1:25:49] you mean the Angels were in heaven and
[1:25:51] didn't see you
[1:25:53] you mean the Angels were created they
[1:25:55] couldn't see you
[1:25:56] I thought you believed it when we said a
[1:25:58] while ago and I thought you when all of
[1:25:59] that quote was God means your object to
[1:26:01] worship so are they the angels are first
[1:26:03] well where's he at work in is it over
[1:26:05] here is he over I don't see him do you
[1:26:07] see him
[1:26:09] come on
[1:26:11] I'm actually
[1:26:15] so what does it mean brother Brown when
[1:26:18] no man has seen the father at any time
[1:26:20] no man can see God in the bodily form
[1:26:26] now remember
[1:26:27] Moses was allowed because he wanted to
[1:26:30] see him
[1:26:32] he was allowed to see God's back heart
[1:26:35] brother Randall said
[1:26:38] you remember in The Rock he passed by
[1:26:41] and he was able to see him but he
[1:26:43] couldn't see his face
[1:26:46] because you couldn't do that but you
[1:26:48] better believe one thing there was a man
[1:26:50] one day by the name of Moses that he
[1:26:53] went closer than just seeing those
[1:26:55] things because the Bible said he talked
[1:26:57] to God
[1:26:58] face to face
[1:27:01] lit to ear
[1:27:05] you think he didn't see a lot
[1:27:07] but look at it why he see no man can see
[1:27:10] God in the bodily form
[1:27:12] because God is not in bodily form God is
[1:27:16] a spirit see all right no man answering
[1:27:18] the father but the only begotten off the
[1:27:21] father hath declared him
[1:27:24] declared means to reveal to bring out
[1:27:26] into the open
[1:27:28] all right to show him
[1:27:30] now but notice now there's nothing
[1:27:32] there's just face
[1:27:34] there's no light there's no dark there's
[1:27:37] no nothing it's just singing just seems
[1:27:40] nothing but in dire is a great
[1:27:42] supernatural being
[1:27:44] Jehovah God
[1:27:45] who covered all space and uh all space
[1:27:48] of all places at all times
[1:27:52] he was Everlasting from Everlasting he
[1:27:55] is the beginning of the creation
[1:27:58] that's God
[1:28:00] can't see nothing can't hear nothing not
[1:28:02] a move of an atom in the iron or nothing
[1:28:05] not nowhere no nothing yet God was there
[1:28:09] that was God
[1:28:11] he said I'm just watch him unfold
[1:28:14] going down reading
[1:28:16] this is questions and answers on Genesis
[1:28:19] Department of 28.
[1:28:22] which would be a continual reading room
[1:28:24] now notice then after a while I began to
[1:28:26] see a little sacred light began to form
[1:28:29] like a little Halo or something
[1:28:33] you could only see it by the spiritual
[1:28:34] eyes to look now
[1:28:36] while we're looking at the church now
[1:28:39] we're standing on a great big banister
[1:28:41] watching what God's doing
[1:28:44] well get right down to this question
[1:28:46] here and you'll see how it brings it in
[1:28:48] no man has seen God
[1:28:51] and now the next thing we begin to see
[1:28:56] May the eyes of Supernatural looking
[1:28:58] amen we see a little white light forming
[1:29:02] out there what is that
[1:29:04] that was called by Bible readers logos
[1:29:07] are anointed or the anointing
[1:29:11] or as I was going to say that the power
[1:29:14] of God began to develop into something
[1:29:17] so human beings could have some type of
[1:29:20] an idea what it was it was a little low
[1:29:23] a little light movie he that was the
[1:29:27] word of God
[1:29:28] now God gave himself birth to his son
[1:29:33] listen
[1:29:35] which was before there was even an atom
[1:29:37] in the air or an hour to make an atom
[1:29:41] that was Jesus said glorify me father
[1:29:44] with the glory that we had before the
[1:29:46] foundation of the world see way back
[1:29:48] under
[1:29:51] mm-hmm
[1:29:53] gave birth to his son
[1:29:57] I asked a question many years ago
[1:30:00] I said when I say son of God what do you
[1:30:02] think of
[1:30:05] and everybody recorded that we're
[1:30:07] thinking of 2000 years ago
[1:30:09] I said you can just call it or snow
[1:30:13] some of you got offended to me for
[1:30:15] saying that
[1:30:17] I dug you out of a pit of Hell of your
[1:30:20] belief
[1:30:21] and you got upset with me
[1:30:25] I wasn't making light of you because it
[1:30:27] was a time I did see it
[1:30:32] what you see God gave birth to his son
[1:30:36] of terrorism no
[1:30:39] because a son
[1:30:41] is the father made manifest in another
[1:30:45] form
[1:30:47] he's just called a son
[1:30:50] it's a part of God
[1:30:54] not like an arm went off and he's
[1:30:56] sitting up there he got an arm you know
[1:31:04] and we think we fully understand
[1:31:07] let me get this last part look at the
[1:31:10] next one 366 your textbook
[1:31:15] later Center change the beginning of the
[1:31:17] creation of God
[1:31:19] this that is who the Lord Jesus says he
[1:31:22] is
[1:31:24] but those words don't mean exactly as
[1:31:26] they sound to us
[1:31:28] just taking them the way they sound has
[1:31:31] made some people
[1:31:33] in fact multitudes of people get the
[1:31:36] idea that Jesus was the first creation
[1:31:39] of God
[1:31:40] making him lower than godhead now what
[1:31:43] about this River Jordan Doctrine the
[1:31:45] message now thing
[1:31:47] then this first creation created all the
[1:31:50] rest of the universe and whatsoever it
[1:31:51] contains but that is not true you know
[1:31:53] that doesn't line up with the rest of
[1:31:55] the Bible the word said he's the
[1:31:56] beginning beginner or author of the
[1:31:59] creation of God we know for a surety
[1:32:02] that Jesus is God very God he is the
[1:32:05] creator or John 1 3 all things were made
[1:32:07] by him without him with not anything
[1:32:08] made it was made he is the one of whom
[1:32:10] it said in Genesis 1 1 in the beginning
[1:32:13] God created the heavens and the Earth
[1:32:15] also it says in Exodus 20 and 11 for in
[1:32:18] six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth
[1:32:20] the sea and all that
[1:32:23] all that in them is and rested the
[1:32:26] seventh see there is no doubt that he is
[1:32:29] the creator
[1:32:30] he was the creator of it and I say that
[1:32:33] word Creator because I know I I thought
[1:32:35] I said but I'm emphasized he is a
[1:32:37] creator
[1:32:38] I ain't saying he's creature
[1:32:41] I I don't like it I'll actually create
[1:32:43] or sorry southern English he was the
[1:32:46] creator of a Finnish physical creation
[1:32:48] sure we can see what these words mean
[1:32:51] now to have any other interpretation
[1:32:53] would mean that God created God how
[1:32:55] could God be created when he himself is
[1:32:58] the creator amen
[1:33:00] huh
[1:33:02] now
[1:33:04] the Trinity developed at nicaea
[1:33:09] 325 A.D because their thought was
[1:33:12] that their question if you'll go back
[1:33:15] and read it you'll see it's right
[1:33:17] that their question was whether or not
[1:33:21] that there was one God now they wouldn't
[1:33:23] argue it now I see a 325 a day or with
[1:33:26] regards now go read your history
[1:33:28] go read the book
[1:33:30] the question wasn't about three gods
[1:33:32] the question was one thing or just what
[1:33:35] I just read
[1:33:37] they were questioning whether Jesus was
[1:33:40] the same substance of God
[1:33:45] that's the question that 325 maybe not a
[1:33:48] trinity that was 606.
[1:33:53] the question that I see around was
[1:33:55] whether or not that Jesus was another
[1:33:58] substance
[1:33:59] isn't it odd here in the end time that
[1:34:01] that's where the people of the message
[1:34:03] are going now they're saying that Jesus
[1:34:04] wasn't God until the River Jordan
[1:34:07] they're having their nice evening
[1:34:08] Council again
[1:34:10] so they developed it nice here
[1:34:13] that Jesus was another substance
[1:34:20] all right that didn't go over too good
[1:34:23] because Aries and I believe it's
[1:34:25] athanasia there were two arguments over
[1:34:28] it and if you'll even read it you'll
[1:34:30] find out that even the guy that finally
[1:34:32] developed the Trinity seemed to have a
[1:34:34] better understanding of the godhead
[1:34:36] I remember reading that when I was first
[1:34:38] started in this message
[1:34:42] but their argument was whether Jesus was
[1:34:44] almighty God
[1:34:46] or was another substance
[1:34:51] so they developed that he was another
[1:34:53] substance
[1:34:55] and that's where they've been then
[1:34:57] developed that it was God in three
[1:34:59] persons Blessed Trinity they didn't
[1:35:01] develop
[1:35:03] that until it become later on in the
[1:35:05] other doctrines
[1:35:07] all right giving you that point to get
[1:35:08] you to see that's my people to say
[1:35:10] remember I'm saying the multitude stain
[1:35:12] that God created Jesus and Jesus created
[1:35:15] everything
[1:35:17] he said that ain't tried he said he was
[1:35:19] almighty God
[1:35:22] himself Elohim stepped over in another
[1:35:25] form
[1:35:27] and began to create
[1:35:29] he said like a father a child playing
[1:35:32] before the father's door but you see
[1:35:33] that's what we want to do
[1:35:35] we want to get our mind into the great
[1:35:37] thinking and we think we've got it all
[1:35:38] figured out and we quote run around how
[1:35:40] old God was he poured into Christ and
[1:35:42] all Christ poured into church
[1:35:44] analyze what the people are saying
[1:35:49] analyze what people are saying all God
[1:35:52] was he poured into Christ ain't no God
[1:35:54] left
[1:35:56] be right back to the Nicene Council
[1:36:02] and all Christ born in the church ain't
[1:36:04] no Christ
[1:36:05] you're right in the devil's trap that he
[1:36:07] said he wanted to be God
[1:36:09] and to be worshiped his God you're
[1:36:11] exactly when I see him running around
[1:36:13] and said developed it in Ikea was
[1:36:16] Satan's stronghold
[1:36:21] and said when they accepted Barabbas and
[1:36:26] crucified Jesus they exalted Satan to
[1:36:29] the throne that he desired amen
[1:36:33] why don't we read
[1:36:36] why don't we listen to the prophet
[1:36:38] or at least listen to somebody that can
[1:36:40] tell you something about what the
[1:36:42] prophet had to say
[1:36:44] no but brother Neil I just I just
[1:36:49] I'm not trying to make nothing
[1:36:53] I want you to see almighty God is real
[1:36:56] I want you to see heaven is real yes I
[1:36:59] want you to see there is a place to go
[1:37:00] to are you going to do away with Heaven
[1:37:02] because
[1:37:03] maybe there's an earth
[1:37:10] what are you gonna do
[1:37:11] when the Bible says that heaven and
[1:37:13] earth will pass away and brother Brown
[1:37:15] said that is not annihilated
[1:37:17] he said it changed his name to another
[1:37:20] form
[1:37:22] what do you want to do away with any of
[1:37:24] that
[1:37:29] why don't we just want to come together
[1:37:30] in Jesus Christ
[1:37:34] why can't we see
[1:37:36] I'll use each note later
[1:37:38] to finish it up but at least maybe the
[1:37:40] doctor
[1:37:45] God is wanting to make himself known
[1:37:50] to reveal himself to mankind
[1:37:52] except us a prophet
[1:37:55] it's not whether or not see when I asked
[1:37:57] a question right around
[1:38:00] what is the new birth
[1:38:03] George Sanders yes this one said this
[1:38:06] happened I didn't say this is that now
[1:38:07] they say that it's not justification
[1:38:09] thank God there's a bad deal with my
[1:38:10] lord it's just a bad kiss on the Holy
[1:38:12] Ghost Well everybody's got it then as
[1:38:14] far as the anointings
[1:38:19] yeah I believe in the old-fashioned
[1:38:21] justification of Saint petition baptism
[1:38:23] in the whole ghost being a new murder
[1:38:25] so I asked right around the questions
[1:38:26] what's on Chrysler
[1:38:28] Crossing mystery God revealed what is it
[1:38:30] page 45 I'm pretty sure it send a
[1:38:32] message but around what is the new word
[1:38:34] he says it's a revelation
[1:38:36] of Jesus Christ
[1:38:38] personally to you
[1:38:45] do you have anywhere
[1:38:48] because if you don't have a new birth
[1:38:49] and you don't know where Heaven's real
[1:38:50] or not you're taking somebody's word for
[1:38:52] you don't know whether or not God is
[1:38:55] real
[1:38:55] you're having to take somebody's words
[1:38:59] but if you have the experience within
[1:39:01] your heart
[1:39:02] see when I come in this message you know
[1:39:05] the story of what I'm fixing to say for
[1:39:07] two years I never claim the baptism of
[1:39:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:39:12] 99.99 of the people that come in this
[1:39:14] message say they got your new work
[1:39:15] because they proved it because they come
[1:39:16] in the message right
[1:39:19] I believe everything Prophet said well
[1:39:21] that can be argued but
[1:39:23] still
[1:39:24] I didn't do it
[1:39:27] because I saw what brother Brown was
[1:39:28] talking about and you were
[1:39:32] I still have my trinities and my
[1:39:35] doctrines and my eternal Hells and my
[1:39:37] ideas
[1:39:39] so for two years I studied this message
[1:39:44] almost rejected my family
[1:39:47] this was working and and steady when
[1:39:50] preaching back Dansby is working and
[1:39:53] studying
[1:39:54] brother caught me who knows that I can
[1:39:56] set up there with him day in and day out
[1:39:58] in red amen six books a day and two
[1:40:02] takes one going to work one back home
[1:40:06] why because if I was going to believe
[1:40:08] the prophecy I wanted to know what he
[1:40:09] said
[1:40:12] brother told him he said you've done all
[1:40:13] of that but you wasn't born again I said
[1:40:15] no sure it wouldn't mind
[1:40:18] but I know when the person of Jesus
[1:40:20] Christ come into this meeting
[1:40:23] and I knew what everyone was talking
[1:40:24] about
[1:40:25] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ's
[1:40:27] personality to you
[1:40:30] it ain't what you see
[1:40:33] I saw God when I was 11 years old you
[1:40:36] know that how do you heard much lower
[1:40:40] but I would not accept it
[1:40:44] he run me until I was
[1:40:47] which was in 69.
[1:40:50] it would have made me what 29.
[1:40:53] did he chase me
[1:40:56] until he found me
[1:40:59] that's why I know he's real
[1:41:03] I don't talk about something I don't
[1:41:04] know
[1:41:06] I've had the experience
[1:41:09] have you had the experience
[1:41:12] of Jesus Christ in a new birth
[1:41:16] not a thought or a conch shell
[1:41:20] you remember when we was bringing that
[1:41:21] out the other day musician come on you
[1:41:23] remember what you bring it out the other
[1:41:24] day about when the Morning Star signed
[1:41:26] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:41:27] joy and they said run around you got a
[1:41:28] new religion he said no way he said I
[1:41:32] got the oldest religion that's ever been
[1:41:35] he said the religion I'm talking about
[1:41:38] began in heaven
[1:41:41] before the world ever begun right
[1:41:45] so you talk to people they think you
[1:41:48] have a new religion
[1:41:50] that's just something new doctrine about
[1:41:52] no we got the oldest one
[1:41:56] that way it don't deny talking to her to
[1:41:59] preachers are the other day at the
[1:42:01] funeral and I said I don't deny anything
[1:42:03] Luther told Wesley tall Pentecost talk
[1:42:06] if it was the truth
[1:42:12] I still believe everybody
[1:42:14] the truth they taught
[1:42:16] I believe you
[1:42:19] I don't have to deny anything
[1:42:21] now era I don't believe in that
[1:42:25] and I believe the truth
[1:42:27] let's Stand Together

[1:43:20] foreign

[1:44:16] the same as what sin is
