TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you like turning your scriptures turn to Romans 8 where we've been reading from and then Ezekiel 18. just remember each one we know we got a lot of people out today and sicknesses and traveling and different ones and all Wade and June is up at brother uh Tom Christian's preaching this weekend so remember them on the way back I know brother boy and them's traveling so remember them and and evidently Brother Dean must be traveling so remember all of these if it just remember now the announcements there will be no service here on December the 25th we want to make sure you you remember that that's on a Wednesday so we won't be having service that Wednesday remember the watch Night Service will be on the 31st and that'll be on Tuesday night and there won't be no service on Wednesday the first day of January just remember that brother Timothy Burdette will be here preaching for us and we'll be starting about eight o'clock and if you want your sisters to bring the finger foods and the things you know the kind of little snack things or finger foods and all for us to be able to eat a little bit before and after the service just make sure you you get together or talk about it or whatever and bring it on we'll all have a good time that way we don't have to go out on uh New Year's Day you know New Year's Eve night and with the rest of the world we can just stay here so just remember that I think that's about all the announcements remember my wife and I will be going up into Tennessee tomorrow because we got to take her sister back home came down for the cash Christmas and we got to take her back home tomorrow she'll remember that the weather will be okay okay Romans 8 and Ezekiel 18. any other announcements I'm not missing anything okay Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace and your love and do us we thank you for all things and you said you give them to us freely so we appreciate that Lord we don't have to do anything all we got to do is accept it we ask you to just have your way with each one of these that are away the different ones that are are traveling in the different things Lord that you would just protect each one and let your love be there just have your way with a way there as he's ministering for brother Tom bless all of these things and we just committed all to you we know that you are God and you change not so that's one thing we can depend upon because you'll always be the same have your way with us now as we speak about you you come on the scene and speak to our hearts forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and let your grace and love be with each one in Jesus name amen okay Romans 8. maybe the Lord willing next weekend we might get around to talking about predestination more a little more I hope this is coming into view on it to help you but you know not just getting right on the point of this that or the other okay Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us that's a great point isn't it just one scripture in Ezekiel we'll just read one scripture verse 4. Ezekiel 18 4 behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the Soul at sinneth it shall die you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've tried to uh get a little too tired on the back of my neck right we tried to bring out you know a lot this especially this past Wednesday night that I hope you enjoyed and uh pray that you'll listen to it if you haven't heard it because we we tried to express some points on it and I want to back up into that just a little bit and go on into a point because I was asked back some time ago to uh speak about you know the soul what a solely is and and things like that so we'll try to speak on that today if we can to to bring forth the point and it'll all line up with predestination because of what we're looking at now remember what we just read here he said All Souls are mine all right now Satan cannot create so no matter what who whatever every person come from God by the point of him creating bringing into being the soul of that individual because Satan cannot give your soul that was where I differed with the the two Soul people many years ago that they said well God give your soul Satan give your soul let make him a Creator so I couldn't go along with it it was just a point that I couldn't do but you know you get a lot of things involved in it and we'll try to get down to it in a minute but I want you to think about what I was saying Wednesday night I want to make sure the point got across good God I don't want you to miss you know misunderstand me and in doing it then we'll we'll just read a couple of quotes that we read there uh Wednesday night go ahead and pull up number one brother and uh this is taken from adoption number three paragraph 177 and 178 reached in 1965-22 in the the morning service now think about it Jesus never died to give you an inheritance right does everybody understand that I wanted to make sure because I know that's a blunt statement compared to what most people think because most people you know most people think well Jesus done this well that's right but it's got to be in the right way if it's not then you're messing up so look what he says inheritance by predestination now that would be enough to stay there a long time I said I ain't heard it's something what inheritance there had to be somebody to leave me an inheritance when you say Jesus left me an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid the price paid for your inheritance done what brought you to your inheritance which your name was put on a lounge book of life before the foundation World God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first the inheritance and Jesus never left me one you say well well I don't understand how that that is because I I thought he he did well see that's where we're looking at it in the wrong direction because Jesus the flesh was a man right his body was created it was perfect but it was not eternal all right see then you were tying up to the point of saying Jesus done something now what did he do that's what I was trying to get across Wednesday night that human body the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily that human body died but God Spirit soul but he can't die so what did he do the product of death was made the Hebrews 10 if I'm a body that has prepared me and that body was not eternal it had to be made eternal all right and see then in that flesh lived the life of almighty God that's why we're not Trinity and we're not Oneness all right but we're in the scriptures of what it's saying all right he gave his soul a ransom as we'll get to it in a little while so that you and I could have eternal life now remember when we were talking about it that God didn't step in heaven he come down to live with us and he came on down until God lived in a human vessel and that human vessel was a creation perfect beautiful right but not Eternal because you can't create something eternal all right then in doing that when he died what happened he released the life that was within him so he come down to pay the price the body paid the price right that's right the body died it paid the price that was our Kinsmen that's our brother all right but see he couldn't give us it wasn't that Jesus was another person see if you're thinking that Jesus gave you or left you an inheritance then you're making him another person separate from God and that won't work he was almighty God in human flesh all right the body of the spirit was almighty God the flesh was a creation all right and then as the prophet said it then what he said Jesus never left me an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance he paid for you in there he brought you to your inheritance and what's what he's saying God buys foreknowledge seen exactly he would be saved and who wouldn't be saved He sent Jesus to save those that had already he had already chosen did Paul say five verses above the heart he showed us in him before there even was a world that's our inheritance God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price the what the shedding of his blood that no sin would be accounted to us nothing you do he paid the price by dying by giving his own life the life that was within him is he coming out of the body the body died had it not been raised back up it would have totally rotten why because it was a human element but he doesn't said he wouldn't do it he wouldn't let him see corruption but he wouldn't leave his soul in Hell either so all right so who was that man that we talk about body a man spirit and soul was almighty God all right that's why it's Emmanuel God With Us all right so what did he do he paid the price he came down and died in flesh that you and I could have eternal life that was the only way as the people talk today I see I always was eternal well then you didn't need Jesus to die that's what I tried to tell them two Soul people years ago they said well all you had to do was just kill that old soul it's because you didn't need nothing on the other there's always Eternal I said okay all we got to do is knock him in the head we'll feel Heaven up you said that's being sarcastic now that's being truthful I could do it at Church of Christ man I said you mean water baptism is under regeneration yes I said I'll meet you on Lake Lanier we'll just put them all in the water if that's all it is but you said oh no brother brother you don't know you know I know see I know that I'm an arrogant hateful old dude but I try to stay with the truth and believe it and see then by making statements people don't like me well that's all right I don't like you either but in God I love you or I wouldn't still be preaching all right but now you see what I'm talking about He sent Jesus to it wasn't God's sin in Jesus that's like another son that's like we know better than that he didn't send a son he came himself but yet in terminology as we speak God sent the son that's like two different people now he came himself that's right he released that life that was within there but did you catch what I was just saying it to lies that's that's the main point I want you to see look at the one that we read on paragraph 56 Gable's instructions to Daniel 1961 7 30 in the morning service number two of you of your notes brother did you understand what he's saying and we found that he was our kinsman redeemer he took the book out of the hand of the original owner it's a title deed to Redemption we found that remember the study is the title deed of redemption it's an abstract deed with it that God required life for death in the Garden of Eden now what happened in the Garden of Eden they sinned they died he required life he took the life of the animals right okay are you with it then Jesus the righteous one died and took a title deed and was able to break the seals reveal what was into him and give the inheritance that belonged to him to his people The Inheritance belonged to him he was the only way you and I could ever have an inheritance right there is no inheritance outside of Jesus Christ paying the price okay now so what'd he do he gave he give the inheritance that belonged to his people eternal life that he inherited by doing that no we know the Eternal God had eternal life or was eternal life not had but the body was not eternal You Realize by releasing like I said Wednesday by him releasing that life out of him the body then was made Eternal in the resurrection right so he inherited eternal life what God inherited eternal life the flesh man inherited eternal life I just wanted to make sure you understood that because you can say well boy I'll tell you what you know like what now he said what's your Prophet is saying eternal life that he inherited by doing that he inherited eternal life his body was made eternal because he released that life out of that body now if he'd stayed with that life in that body his body would have never been eternal come on look then what'd he do he passed his own life back out at Calvary and divided it Among Us by the Holy Ghost amen no man has never been able to come to ever think of the love that was see he passed his own life back he released it all right and once he released it see then it gave him the inheritance of eternal life and flesh all right your prophet's right he just takes a revelation to understand what is being said you see he inheritance eternal life that he had inherited by doing it look at the next one I didn't give this Wednesday I just found this when it's look at number three which is paragraph 161 of the Revelation chapter 5 61 6 18. he breaks the seals reveals gives us he is what reveals gives us his inheritance to the people now he gave us eternal life right he made the way for us here but you know what by coming and living in this flesh he's going to give us the eternal life that he inherited in flesh right that's right it's all right now what is it he gives inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer all right and freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it himself he gives it back to the people that's his love for us right what do you understand he inherited eternal life and flesh by releasing the life out of his flesh all right then he comes and lives in you and I in the new birth lays claim on our body right no that's why we don't believe in getting a new body Jesus didn't have a new body he raised with nail prints in his hands see if this body then made eternal from the inside which is the holy spirit living in us and that's completing the Plan of Redemption as we're reading our Wednesday the earnest of our inheritance what until the Redemption of the purchase possessed it's already purchased right but it hasn't been applied Israel's salvation has already been purchased right but it hasn't been applied to them your inheritance my inheritance of eternal life and flesh has done been purchased and when he gave you the Holy Ghost he laid claim on that all right see then that would give us eternal life all right brother Brown said on the message I didn't give them this one now on the message the faith of Abraham 1955 he said you got every Redemption blessing Jesus died for as your personal property all the Redemption blessings Jesus died for is our own property rule death is mine not my enemy you can't do anything to me you can't take his my life until God's true with me so why do I worry all right but see we went through the fact of saying that when we're born again we receive the earnest of our inheritance according to the scripture which is a new birth right all right until the Redemption of the purchased possession then see that's this body totally redeemed but then the world will be redeemed why because he's already taken us out of this world now remember the point I was trying to say the Rich Young Ruler he said I've done all of these things from my youth Jesus said give all you got that's what we put it on give it all away but then what'd he say he said come follow me right which is giving away all this money was going to be the concern no that just wound up showing that the man was too too stingy too tight to this that's the other and wasn't going to give it up but he didn't go follow him right where did he want him to follow him too you remember that Matthew 19. and not Matthew 19 28-29 follow me in the Regeneration and you'll inherit everlasting life so he told a Rich Young Ruler what it would take to come and follow him he knew right then he could not give him the eternal life that he had within him right there was no way to get because the Bible said the Holy Ghost did not been given because Jesus not been glorified all right so he had to die so he told a Rich Young Ruler follow me all right come and go with me and walk right into the Regeneration the new birth which is what came on a day of Pentecost right all right showed on the damn Pentecost he gave back the life the prophet said what he said he sent his soul back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost well I thought it was just a spirit that came well then you're just an anointed one good anointing ones out of the eternal spirit of God on them the baptism of the Holy Ghost your Prophet says genuine you can have that on your spirit and die and go to hell so as we enter the thought of what we're talking about remember the soul is the most important part of you your body's not important Spirit that's within you is not the most important thing because it can be Anointed with the spirit I don't mean you're saved but if you have that eternal life in your soul all right and so watch what we're getting at Jesus told them he said come and follow me now watch the point I wrote down to start the service today we uh Baptist we used to talk about you know one of these days we're going to get up to heaven I think I'm saved I believe I'm saved I hope I'm safe I you know I believe I have eternal life but I'm going to get eternal life when I get to heaven what I like about it is one thing is being a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ now listen You Realize by being a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ that you and I receive our full inheritance while we're here on Earth nobody else gets that the Bride of Jesus Christ receives Body Spirit and soul eternal well we're right here you say well what's the difference in eternal life to a foolish virgin and eternal life we have that's the difference Even Adam was just imparted to him eternal life but Jesus it wasn't imparted to him he was eternal life all right and see then it's not just an imparting to you and I it's a process we have to go through which is justification jumping off the piscience sanctification cleansing and setting aside and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is a new birth the soul of God to come and live in you and I now the soul of man is the most important part about him go ahead and pull that up brother from there the first one I gave you did you see what the Greek and the Hebrew says about the soul and while they're doing that Webster says soul is a human being a person it can mean Spirit or we'll read in a minute because it's interchangeable so it's an essence it's the core of anything it's the heart amen of anything the the core or heart of a peach is not dead center in the peach it may be off a little bit but it's the seed right the heart of it all right the Greek which is the New Testament it says that the word soul is life mind heart ILY it means breath you remember you breathed into Adam's nostrils and he became a what Living spirit well no no that wasn't what it said it says the living soul God it means breath means the Breath of Life the vital force which animates the body and shows itself in breathing of animals of man you remember they're giving the definition all the way they're not dividing it to see them the animal don't have a soul they're just giving a definition because you'll see in a minute that the word where I hear it is the New Testament usually soul in spirit interchangeably because it will have the same meaning if you use it it's just like saying eternal life and then say an everlasting life well everlasting's got a point it started and then not when you're referring to the life of God so in the scripture when it's speaking of everlasting life he's talking about eternal life so if you're reading and it says Soul it says spirit don't worry about it just get what you're talking about Jesus said my soul is troubled into thy hand I commend my spirit those words can be interchangeable right but look he says the the human nature is the point that in which there is life a living being a living soul the soul the seed of the feelings Desires affections aversions in other words human soul as far as constituted by the rights use of the AIDS offered it by God can attain its highest end and secure Eternal blessing the soul regarded as a moral being designed for everlasting life the soul as an Essence which differs from the body and is not dissolved by death distinguishing from the other parts of the body yeah because as I said the other day and I got a quote letting on my desk at home if you didn't believe it was right you wrote around says you can kill a person but you can't kill them he said it puts them in another dimension see we think death is to find out now it just moves you to another dimension well because that's the soul that's right we want to get to today look at what the Old Testament says about him it says that the word Soul itself life creature person appetite mind living being desire emotion a passion that which breeds the the breathing substance being troll inner being of man living being living being with its life in the blood the man himself self-person individual seed of even your appetite seed of emotions and Passions activity of mind activity of will what is a soul it's you all right now if you don't get the whole message part you miss it just remember the Bible says the soul that sent us we read it shall die there's no scripture said the spirit that Sinners shall die you don't have that it says the soul that's sinneth it shall die all right and remember in Ezekiel as we read to make sure you hold a point it said oh soldier of mine sold to the father soul to the son all sold your mind he said that's why you can get to understanding it right around and said that he said I've gotten a man from the Lord he said it don't make no difference who Mom and Daddy is my mama and daddy don't give you nothing but a body right it don't give your spirit it don't give you a soul well I'm just like my mom and daddy well you don't have to be you can do something about it why because you're a living Soul you're not your mom and daddy reincarnated or what's that other word they're using now where they were trying to make a a double out of you what is it cologne you're not a cologne you might need some cologne but you're not a cologne but listen we then get the point we here receive our full inheritance which is sonship while we're alive because one of these days even if you're dead you're going to the Grave your body's in the grave sold under the altar Spirit goes back to God whatever you want to do with those terminologies but one day that spirit will be released and come to the soul soul to the body and you'll stand up so we get it all right here the dead will be raised right here it won't be when we get over there they raise and go no we're going to all go together right right and have a body like unto his glorious body the Bible says because we'll be like you why because we're his offspring all right now in doing that see we start our inheritance by the new birth now if you believe you always was eternal then you don't have a starting of an inheritance you'd have your full inheritance without Jesus and I don't believe that I believe he had to die to release that life and then we have to receive that life or we don't have eternal life you're gonna have to rewrite your Bible you'd be saying to Nicodemus Nicodemus all you got to do is believe like I've always said he believed a pretty good bit he said we know you're a teacher come from God we know all these things right but he couldn't understand when he said you must be born again that's the way it is today people don't they don't want to talk about the new birth there's one of some concept or some thought what wrote down I believe the message shows the devil will be what do you got well he don't believe it like I do I agree with you he believes it more than you do okay no but the wonderful part of being the Bride of Jesus Christ we don't have to wait until we get there right neither do we believe we always was without Jesus Christ in the new birth so then we know the truth and you know the truth it'll set you free all right now what is the soul now before I start I want to explain something that people have been massively confused on a lot of times in the early Ministry brother Branham would explain he would say you are body Soul spirit and in the ending of his ministry he would say your body spirit and soul he said well there's no message to correct all of that you don't have to have a correction because I challenge you to bring me any quote you want to and look at that quote and see what he's saying he gives the body five senses he taste filled smell in here he gives the second realm of man whether he calls it Spirit or soul he gives it five senses memory reason conscious affections Etc he gives us inner sense one is he the faith or doubt you say that's two no it's either Faith or doubt it's one of those it's not hyphen height all right so we're either born again or we're not born again there's no gray area to that point all right so listen to him what is a soul better ran them now as I say it when you're using the word soul just look and see what the senses are because he never he doesn't always say you know and put it as a soul be in the spirit in the early Ministry he doesn't every time you see soul in the early Ministry doesn't mean that it's supposed to be changed the spirit you don't have to do that read what he's saying but remember irregardless of what you think the soul is the real you that's what you are no brother damn I'm Body Spirit and soul amen I'm glad you can think but just remember the body can be annihilated and the spirit will go somewhere else but your soul will live on until Judgment Day or either you will be the bride of Christ right so the soul is the real you okay brother random what is a soul okay so let's just read a little bit go ahead number four the world becoming flesh in the India trip 54 1003 morning so let's get a point now we are a threefold being so Body Spirit now see he doesn't always say old men in the old you know say Body Soul Spirit he doesn't always say that we'll read one in a minute where he goes just like this but to try on being is what he's explaining that you're a what your soul your body your spirit but you're only one because the Triune being is not a trinity of beings it takes that to make you right I think I've got it in here brother Ryan said with anyone left out you are not complete you know if you leave all Soul you leave all spiritually leave off body you're not complete all right that ought to be sensible watch we are threefold being so Body Spirit we know that what this flesh is we realize that's here we know what the spirit is it controls the flesh but what is the soul the soul is the nature of the spirit now the soul is the nature of the spirit now if you put that in to a lot of people's hands today and let them Define that Soul being the nature of the spirit you've got a lot of problems because your two Soul people used to call it they used to quote it this way the soul is just the nature of the spirit I want one quote out of brother Brown's message to say that I want one quote where he says the soul is just the nature of the spirit they added one word just because it's not in there search it I've been searching 40 years I searched it without the computer I certainly been real good to search it with a computer you know so he's not saying the soul is just the nature of the spirit see then that would mean it's nothing it's just a whatever that is well you know it's a bird dog you get what I'm saying but yet people quote that as like you quote the soul is the nature of spirit that quote the soul is just the Nature's fear and swear by it but it's not in there why because you're not making this you're not making the soul as to be real you you're just making it a nature or something all right so we hear you're the devil I got them in here oh here you're the devil you know we hear your God and you don't know which one you are just the nature soul is a person come on how many times we went through that Jesus Soul Spirit theophany of his being the prophet said went to hell to preach the souls in prison when he went beyond the curtain of time he said that angel referred to that as saying Souls under the altar but now brother Dale that can't be because Souls under the dollars fifth sealed you in all of it see we think we're right just because we can make a quote anything you give me somebody try it sometimes anything you give me I'll give you all talk my head a quote seems totally contrary to it we just discussed it this morning we run around them in Revelations in the seal book it's in the seventh seal I'm pretty sure he's talking about revelation 7. he said that's not the bride of 1963. in the church age book he said it was the bride in Christ The Mystery of God's revealed which is actually the seals he said it was the bride in questions and answers from 64 he said it was the bride well which one's right brother Dale he's right both times he's writing both ways he's saying it it's according to what he's saying did you see that's where the holy spirit in a teacher or a person supposed to be able to put that together instead of coming up with mass confusion well I don't know what he means let me ask you a simple question are you mathematically calculating that Revelation 7 is after the Rapture and it is well you see where did I come into trouble with I do too much thinking I guess according to my Bible revelations 10 7. is if after Revelations 4 1. Revelation 18 4 is after Revelations 4 1. Church don't you see that even a human man as brother around him was when they asked him the question of Revelations 5 he says that is not the bride he said because she's already gone brother Ned Iverson's one had done it he said brother Brown reads a question over he read the question over and he said I was wrong that is the bride he said she's in heaven Revelation 7 is Israel and the foolish virgins in heaven but it's Israel and the bride and the foolish virgins all in heaven choice of compound meaning Revelation 18 4 come out I heard my peoples talking about Israel physically he's talking about you and I right now coming out of our organizational denominational thoughts you see you know today was people taught I heard of this or heard of the message the man didn't even have a soul until the law came into being you ever heard that doctrine that was a Doctrine the man it read it to me I said well according to my Bible it said he'd breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he become a living soul I wondered about that too but it didn't change his Doctrine he went on teaching and man didn't have a soul until the law came the soul is the real you it's not just a spirit or it's just not real so what is it what is the soul the nature of the spirit all right the prophet says the nature of your soul is it sold in prison if I don't get to it he said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again he said but if not it's the nature of the world all right the nature of your soul so the soul is the nature of the spirit your spirit displays outwardly what's within you amen amen right see in my soul is eternal life and I'm trying my best to give it away right what yeah I'm trying to give it to you because see Jesus gave it to me in the basis he allowed me to be able to receive it he released that life that was within him and it came back on the dead Pentecost I would love to be able to release the life I have in me to be able to give it to you would you be willing to do that Paul said ought to be a Castaway if Israel could be saved would you be willing to do that would you ever be willing to give up your eternal life if you could give it to somebody else now brother Dale ain't going along with her I'm just going to say it and you can do what you want to you don't have the eternal life I have come on because I've been trying my best to give away what I got see I know I can't I know I can't lose it right so I try my best to preach the gospel just like what I was explaining there my Ministry if it's anything has always been to take those things that sound like they're totally contrary one to the other and let the Holy Spirit bring it together and it makes a beautiful picture I was explaining to somebody else the other day about this and asked the person a question about the revelation 7. I said it is uh are you back there in uh Ezekiel or Genesis oh I'm in the New Testament well I know how to do we ain't yours in is it all right so come on sisters when it says in the scripture there are the Old Testaments her not to wear a garment pertains to a man well that's the Old Testament within Hebrews 13 8. is where the Prophet said he failed and that's where we fail you see you see somebody come along and the Holy Spirit can put it together I ain't gonna listen to that I know what it is Souls Nature's fear it's just the nature it's just the nature of the world it's the nature of this the nature of that well the prophet said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again that's quoted that to a man standing in Jeffersonville Indiana one day about his two soul man he said how can a nature have a nature I said go talk to the prophet you want to say I said don't talk to me about it did you happen to Nature tonight you're just a nature see that's the point of people they want to make your soul just the nature of your spirit and it's not just the nature of your spirit it is the nature of your spirit now unless you be a hypocrite and I got one in here after a while we'll get to it where brother Brown said those Pharisees we're Hypocrites you know we call them hypocrites he said be called out of one corner of their mouth they said he was a master and God and said out of the other corner of the mouth they said he was Belgium up from their nature their soul they were speaking right no we don't speak from our mouth do we someone else is talking but just think about it now what is the soul it's the nature of the spirit so you've got a bird dog all right he's got a nature you don't teach him the point right you got a hound dog he don't point he chases right there's two different Natures of the same animal all right just explaining the point we were born into Satan's domain and because of the fall in the garden our soul was doomed when it got here right but now let me go back to explain something when God created that baby that baby's the soul was perfect I didn't say Eternal I said perfect all right the domain we're in brings us the nature of that domain right so that's why we wound up being kin folks to the devil the beautiful wonderful soul that God gives to a baby mankind perverts it but yet we do it even in the religious realm what you take your little kids you send them to Sunday school and wanted to get up there and they do they sing the songs praise Father Son and Holy Ghost a trinity and then the preachers got to come along later and preach that out of us and don't think it don't hinder you don't think it don't hinder me it still hinders me to yeah oh but I got rid of it well praise God pray for me you see because that devil he is not in my soul but he's in the rest of me the rest of me still belongs that old domain my spirit my body is still in this domain of Satan my soul is the only thing that's eternal so then the Soul is the real you the real you God didn't come down to die for your body like I said the other day in a message you you might not listen to me sometimes but listen you might get something I was talking about the body that Jesus dwelled in you believe he was almighty God in flesh the Bible said he could give eternal life to who he desired right paraphrasing it the son of man he could raise the dead heal the sick what do you need to speak us a glorified bodies sister Gayle and just forget the whole thing because we would have been in a glorified body with a sinful soul right our spirit and our soul would have been sinful so he couldn't do that well he could have just no he couldn't just speak eternal life into you and I he had to make a way release that eternal life and to do that it cost him his life to let that Soul come out of him that could come back in you and I but before it could come back and you and I it went to hell and and preached to the souls even in that scripture of get it there if you'll read it it says the spirit's in prison read your scripture it doesn't say the Soul's imprisoned brother Branham put that to it because he said that's what it's saying that is the soul but the scripture says the spirits that are in prison they were disobedient and long suffering the days of Noah but are you listening the nature of the spirit so our soul comes forth in Satan's domain lost we take the nature of the world that's not just in our spirit the nature of the world is satanic's Realm Satan can't give you a soul right but he can pervert the nature of your soul he has no soul to be able to give he's a spirit being but it's just like the children of Israel when Balaam couldn't get God to curse him right what did he tell balik he said you get them more about women down here with them boys and it'll take care of it and that's what happened and God had to curse him see he knew how it was done but he couldn't make it be done himself so no matter what that we look at we look at a little baby and you know I love them little babies tonight but that baby is born in Satan's domain and by the time it's two years old it's live and Mama and Daddy don't lie but that little baby alive right you get him in somewhere along and I would call it the terrible twos yeah don't give him a stick he's going to want somebody in the head he's going to do like my wife she comes in one day and her daddy was laying on the couch and he was sound asleep and he was snoring at his mouth she thought he was hungry she goes and gets some soda crackers and she packed them in his mouth of course he tried to get that little devil out of her when he got through with her because he gave her a spanking right what you see the best you can train them little kids they gonna be kids if you don't want a kid to do something tell him not to do it right you better explain why he's not supposed to do it don't just tell him not to do it in terms of don't go out that door he's going to go out that door it don't make no difference he's going to figure out a way because he's a kid you got to explain it and they would whip the kids so I sat down and talk to him and they finally they discovered that Daddy just left me but I want to know why there's getting there with him explain to your kids when you get don't grab one up and slap it through the face let me see will you do that around here and I'm gonna have a talk with you because that ain't right there's another part of them that you can get more attention you remember what the little boy said he said my throats are hurting but they're going to give me a shot somewhere else I don't understand that well it got his attention and it'll get the attention to you get your little Hickory and just pan them lags just a little bit and you know what that old brain will start thinking because a baby is a soul now here's my point why do we want to raise them correctly the best we can do come on why do you want to raise your kids the best you can do what you you don't ever think about raising kids you want to raise them right don't you that's right why you want to raise them to where they can make the right choices they can do the right thing and it won't be hateful and mean and arrogant right you know what you're doing you're molding the nature of that Soul that's within that child the reason I preach I want my kids to hear the truth I'd have done quite a long time ago if it wasn't for that you say that's selfish I'm preaching to you too Lana I want you an opportunity to hear the truth I Don't Preach to go to heaven I don't have to worry about that but I want you to see the truth even if I got to make you mad if I got to make you arrogant and hateful with me and everything in the world I want to tell you the truth because then one of these days you'll come back and you'll say brother Dale you've done it right we just had problems yes and I did too but you see you're molding the character of that child well I'm not going to whip my child because the Bible says Spire the rod what convert the nature of the child in the wrong way did I mistranslate that or does that what that means fire the rod and spoil the child my kids didn't get down in the floor and scream and holler and kick I've seen them in Walmart that done that I've seen them in church that done that my kids didn't do that I didn't want that nature in them why don't you try to raise them right well I want them to mold their character turn them loose let the devil raise them then because that's what you're doing yeah but I don't want to hurt my child's feelings huh oh why is it so bad today that kids are now just killing their mamas and daddies Grandma and Grandpa brothers and sisters wow because somebody turned them loose and let them mold their character into a demonic condition that's right you say you don't you know better than that you don't don't talk to me about loving these kids around here know me they know one thing for sure brother Dale's a well Papa he's straight but he loves them you let that child know you love it why is it why is it a sign I mean a psychological effect that your kids would do wrong to get you to correct them then if you don't correct them what is wrong or somebody else's they're going to turn to something else you understand what I'm saying we're talking about Soul being the nature of the spirit that Soul inside of you has been brought to a condition by mankind we'll get to it in a minute we get time we don't we'll get to it next year all right see we are training our children to be wrong and then you bring them to me 16 years old brother Dale pray this Spirit off this child um I need to pray it off you first right but have you had ever had this I've done everything I can do but little Johnny he's got his own way who gave him his way there's one thing mom and daddy never had that you're looking at and these kids are sitting here can tell you but Nanny corrected I didn't come in honey she shouldn't have done it that way when I corrected him she didn't come along say now he shouldn't have been that mean to you and whipped you uh-uh we might talk to each other later about maybe we was a little bit tough you know but we didn't do it in front of the kids oh my Lord what do we got now he is hers and theirs I'll tell you what if this old boy ever entered one of them situations to marry there's going to be a lot of paperwork signed and that paperwork's going to say I can whip your kids and you can whip my kids I said will not Beat to Death but you deferred what you you tell me what the Bible means when it says about a child beat a child it won't die right that's not child abuse you're child abuse when you won't correct your children I didn't mean to get on that so maybe that'll at least let us know what a soul is nah Terence one day we was walking around there or we're under looking at some land and this old guy was standing there in a little long hair and he we got in the car and we started back around he said Daddy I'm glad you didn't look like Anna I said what are you talking about he said well that's the way I'd want to look you look like that remember they got their heart shorter than mine before I got mine shorter so we're not going either way all the way right but listen Church what about that nature all right the soul is the nature of the spirit so whatever you see on display something down inside is causing the problem now come on we can be Hypocrites because that's what Jesus was saying we'll get back to that he said you're a bunch of Hypocrites he said cause with your mouth you're saying you love me and I'm the master but said with the other you're trying to kill me all right there's Hypocrites there's people like that but we're not talking about that we're supposed to be talking about straight right Christians now how does that work let's read a few quotes and then we'll just one or two more and we'll quit we'll take it up this afternoon so look at the token preached in 1964 308 preaching Dallas number five on your notes my life could not come back into human because they wouldn't match the animal life has no soul in it the human life has her soul the animal doesn't know he's naked he doesn't know right from wrong he he he's a spirit but not a shovel now remember now the soul is the nature of the spirit of course he said let me read one or two look at the next one Revelations chapter 4. number 2 1961. uh 101 paragraph 248. and now on this system of Body Soul now if you'll get the word soul and look it up now this is your Prophet telling you it'll tell you in the Bible dictionary R Webster any of them what's it going to tell you what a soul is right it's the nature of the spirit now watch him explaining now here's a man we say here's John Doe all right John Doe and here's Sam Doe all right now John Doe is a man body he's a brother to sound dog now John is a spirit soul body and Sam doe is the same thing Body Soul spirit that's what I said read all you want to you're going to get confused but what's he saying John is a spirit soul body Sam is a body Soul Spirit well one's Runway and one he said it was the same he's explaining the three Realms of mankind not the position they're in come on he is Body Soul Spirit now this man is evil mean she's still alive commit adultery and evil thing and he can and any evil thing that he can do with this man is full of love peace Joy they both got soul body and spirit well what's the difference this man can go back and say I remember my mama I remember things that we done when we were boys both of them can they both got Spirits they both got Souls they both got body but the nature of this man's spirit is evil the nature of this man's spirit is good so the nature of the spirit is the soul of man according to that Spirit to have a nature is from the inside right so God is trying to get into what the spirit and heart of man where the spirit lays in the heart now God we can read Body Spirit soul soul Spirit we got it all figured out we'll pick up right here called in the next one let's read a little bit of it souls in prison this is 1963 11 10 paragraph 36 or just read the first part now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that's the nature of the spirit and then when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are hidden God through Christ see you there by the holy spirit that wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died come on it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world see the soul is the real you and whatever your spirit shows to the world is what's on the inside now we may be able to be our crit and tell people we love them but it won't be long you know when those Pharisees kept telling Jesus you're the master we believe you you're the but then when they killed him they kind of let them know where he's let him know where they stood didn't it don't worry about it you're only going to be a hypocrite for a while because you're going to be made manifest but around and said people talking about loving said fill a knife in your back right you see I've always believed in one thing I always believed in one little point if you love me then there's nothing I can do to make you not love me if you really do because I remember the Bible that says most what love covers what I wanted you to see him so no matter how bad I am if you love me you're gonna love me and that's from a deep-seated thing because you don't love with your body you just play love with your body you don't love with your spirit because that's this hypocritical guy body ain't no problem that Spirit can go either way but it's down inside of there there's a speck of the love of God then you can't help but love me that's what I told a man one time he was talking about having discernment I just went up to him later I said listen if any day the Lord tells you anything about me you just come tell me I'll be glad to hear it I said but there's one thing I want you to do for me I said if you got discernment and you can discern that I am wrong you can also discern that I want to be right because your discernment is of God right you discern but don't cut off well I just see you as wrong no if you got discernment it'll show you what I am in what my desires are you ever heard me make this statement come on brother I don't care for my wife knowing anything I've ever thought about her how many brothers would be willing to say that you don't care what your wife you know everything you've ever thought everything you've ever said everything you've ever done how many women would you say that I wouldn't care for my husband to hear everything I was but see there's an end to that statement that you don't listen to sometimes my wife says something and I don't agree with her and I don't like it I get upset and I think wrong but in a little bit the holy spirit says you know sometimes Prophet said people say thing to you see what how are you going to behave I said Lord forgive me but you see the main thing about my wife is because if she just ever remember the last thing is I love you it's a life thing it said at night before we go to sleep I love you foreign love covers a multitude of sin you tell me you don't think wrong I tell you you're dead we need to bury you right but yet the end of my thought you see the reason I say that is because that's the way I am with God sometimes I get frustrated sometimes I get all out of shape the way God's doing things and want me to do it and I don't want to do it I get all upset and I say Lord how about just letting somebody else take this thing and carry it on you know I just seem to work for me let somebody else carry it on but then I walk back and I think until somebody else comes along and can take it over I just keep going the way I am you know why because my part of the last is I want people to hear the truth not mass confusion like it is today now the people of the message are what trying to prove brother Brown was wrong like when Brother Ray was talking a while ago people hit 30 years ago would Squire about what he said and beat you if you said something wrong but now they're trying to pick it apart and they have the ability now to understand well see church we are displaying to the world what's within us and just remember there is an old saying you can deceive some of the people some of the time but what is it but not all the people all the time and just remember another thing you ain't deceiving yourself to start with because you know what you're trying to do the nature of the world is a strong force it takes the new birth to be able to conquer it then even in life what are we the prophet said until a change comes we'll be a sticker and we don't like that one do they don't mean we're sinful that's not what he's talking about it's a human being just be a human being we've got no problems right we're a sticker let's stand together what do we got brother number 668 Inspire book remember the soul is the real you it's more real than your body go ahead in your spirit last time some dinosaurs no more conditions what do we think about uh Jesus beautiful sins which were made into my life this Jesus came is steadfast thank you yes from anybody what are you doing you know what I say this yesterday let the nature that's within them that's a fall that Rose them anybody else foreign black dog trying to find a fire you're dismissed remember the service this afternoon father dismissed each one leaving everybody
