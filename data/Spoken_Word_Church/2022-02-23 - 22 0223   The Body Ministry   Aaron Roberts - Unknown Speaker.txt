[Music] amen praise the lord praise the lord amen that was my that was my song i i sang that so many times when after i broke my elbow and i spent a lot of days in pain but the lord got me through all of them and i just appreciate him and i still think about that that's all standing the goodness of the lord so i appreciate each one of you and good to be in the house the lord and um and just have a couple of uh i had a couple of prairie quests and um i didn't want to make mention i didn't i didn't do this sunday but uh it's just something that's i just want to share with you it's a something good's a testimony our brother from nepal brother ted she calls and talks to me and texts me all the time and asks about everybody and he watches the services so he knows when everybody's sick he knows more about what's going on in the church than we do sometimes he's he's very but he's very mindful and he and he does a lot of praying and uh he always he always asked me about brother dale sister peggy always wants to know how they're doing and and the different ones and but uh this past weekend for the first time in in three years they had church they've not had they've not had to have zoom meetings they actually got together in in church building and so he was so he was so happy to be able to you know because you know we take it for granted sometimes when you know we all get together but you imagine three years of zoom meetings the most people that they could have together at one time was five people and that was church and they would go from one house to another house to another house and and so it may take you know it may take you weeks or months to see everybody and all you get to see is just that little zoom screen you know that your internet connection and that was fellowship and so i just wanted to share that with you that appreciate that because he was he was very excited and i just want to share that with you thank the lord that they are able so maybe one of these days if the lord tarries and makes away maybe we'll get to go over there and see them and fellowship with them over there and he just he's just a real precious brother and just tries to help out you know and kind of goes along with what i uh want to speak about tonight but uh if you have your bibles we'll just go right into the scripture and then i have uh some just like we all do we just got some prayer requests and a lady that she requested prayer for her brother it's been several years ago the lord touched him he had cancer he had he had to go through the treatment everything but the doctors were amazed at how well he had done and so uh she told me the other day that they sent him back to the doctor it's been several years since he's been i guess in remission and they're saying the cancer has come back or they're they're running tests but that's that's what the doctors are thinking so i said well the lord done it the first time i said he'll do it again so i said well definitely mention it to the church that we'll just put him on the list and we'll continue to pray his name is leonard and then and you know he knows that the lord touched him the first time because doctors can only do so much but it takes it takes the lord to do the rest of it and so so we're definitely going to hold him up in prayer i said well we've seen this battle before and the devil was defeated so we just believe that so if you have your bibles we're going to go to romans chapter 12 and then we're going to go to ephesians 4 and just very familiar scripture and i don't may not want to try to hold you along tonight but just want to share a few things with you and then encourage you be a blessing amen amen so let's just all bow our heads and we'll speak to the author before we read the scripture tonight our heavenly father lord jesus we're just so thankful lord to be in your house again tonight lord together with those who like precious faith lord that we can come into your house and lord to to just feed on your word tonight and lord jesus we can gather and sing the songs of zion and worship you and that you can come and speak to each one of us tonight lord you said where two or three are gathered you'd be there in the midst and lord we're just so thankful lord that even if we never felt your presence lord we know that you'd honor your word and be here and lord we just pray that everything that we do tonight will be for your honor and glory lord that you'll just come and and just anoint each one of us lord the speaker and the hearers alike lord let us all be just in one mind and one accord lord jesus that you can have your preeminence lord that you can have your way with us tonight lord let us just not just be another gathering lord but we just want to see you high and lifted up and father we commit all things lord for all the needs that are represented in this building lord of many ones that have the hands that have been raised lord the ones that have been read lord lord there's so many we sometimes we fail to remember them all lord but we know that you're mindful of every one of them lord you said before we even ask lord that you would answer and lord we know that you have all the answers lord and we know that lord that we just committed to you and we just thank you for it lord because we know it's a finished work lord we just commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ tonight amen yeah romans chapter 12 again at verse 1 and very familiar scripture and it says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the propitiation of faith a proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exalt exhorted on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness amen and so we'll go to uh ephesians chapter four and read another very very familiar scripture you almost almost quote this but and it says verse 11 says and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him and all things which is the head even christ for for whom from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen god bless you tonight you can be seated and tonight i wanna very very simple title the the body ministry and you know here paul's speaking and you know you know he says that every man that has been given a a portion and and brother branham you know we'll we'll see later on where brother i'm talking about you know every person has a has a ministry amen and here's paul saying you know we shouldn't think uh any higher of ourselves and we all think but we all think soberly and and that's the and that's the one thing that that kind of caught my attention in in reading this scripture he said but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith they said for we have we have many members in one body and all the members don't have the same office but we all work together and we all have a have a ministry and the scripture tells us that each one of these positions is for the edifying of the body and so if we all have a position then we ought to we ought to think about what our position is and what god has called us to and to be and to think about it what god has given us and to think soberly about that position because if if god give us called us to this place god didn't call us into the body of christ just to be part of the body but there's a position and everything has to work together just like in a natural body there all has to work together and there's everything is has to work in harmony and so there's a total function in the body that has to take place and when you have this it all has to work together and you know so when when we we think about these things you know you know many times and i want to read ephesians because most of the time when people talk about ministry everybody goes to the fivefold ministry and they look and say this is the fivefold you know because they put this is the ministry and we failed to and sometimes it's not that you know we look at somebody else and we think about their ministry but sometimes what what paul was reading about in when what paul was quoting here in romans the first part is to be a living sacrifice you know to to think of ourselves but but i want you to see that to see what you know because i can point out that that brother danny has has a ministry or i can see that sister monica has a ministry or i can point somebody else has a ministry but then i then i put myself in a position where it's like well what do i'm supposed to do because you know what because the the and the problem and the problem is this is if we don't take an account of who we are and it's not and it's not well you know we're part of the five-fold ministry whatever your position is whatever your part is it's important and god called you to that and you shouldn't think any less of yourself than anybody else because you have a part in the body and the part that you play is important and not only is it important to do your job to find out what your position is but to fulfill that position because i i later on i want to maybe look at some things and you know when you see things in the scripture when they when they start to stand out to you then you know what it it it makes it makes the things that god has called us to do it gives it it gives it a a greater importance because because it becomes a more a more uh a cherished thing in your life to to uphold these things and you know and you know because many times we we have people and and and they can look into the scripture and they'll go to hebrews and then they say you know forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as the sun as this as the manner of some is and he said and so much more as the day approaches well the thing is is it's not that we're that you know that something's going to happen that you know it's but the problem is is you know you don't realize what when you come together it's all of those licks of fire coming together and so you know as as as it talks about you know each one of us have our has a ministry each one of us has a place and and so when you when you look at these things we look here in the in the scripture you know i want to get into some things but you know when you see when you look into the scripture and you see these things you see the position that god called people to do and when you see these things you know when you look at them it may not look much to you but in the long run it became very important because even later on even when when paul gets into reading and talking of the scripture talking about the body you know he said that you know you you can't say because you know you're one part of the body that you know i don't have no need of another part because you know you're the you're because you're the eyes he said well i don't need i don't need the ears or i don't need this other part because i have no need of you but he said every part had had a position because there's a because it's a where you know it's not all just sight or or hearing or speaking but it's a whole body and it's it's a whole body ministry and sometimes we you know and when that starts when we start this out it starts here in the local assembly it starts really it starts in the family that's where that's where this the ministry starts in your family because you know you as men being the head of the household and overseeing the spiritual life of the family and then then a mother being the fifth gospel then raising the children and then everything that they do everything that we say and do is is an example of of christ in the church or christ in the bride so the way we handle each situation as paul instructs men he said he said to love love your wife as your own flesh and and to le and to love your wife as christ loved the church and then sometimes when we began to see these things then you know what we we realize that we we are way below our stand below the standard we we live because sometimes you know we life gets in the way and we allow things to get in the way that hampers our walk with god and so when when the the life that we live affects the people around us and when we've seen the uh the the example that that has been given to us in this day you know i was thinking about where where you know brother billy paul always told the told the uh testimony about brother branham and he said you know he said he never you never could tell who brother branham's friends and enemies were because he treated them all the same when you know when he knew that people were there and they hated him and they done everything behind his back that they could undermine him and you know what he still loved them and still fellowshipped with them and he knew and he knew what was going on and and brother perry green tells the tells the uh story one time and and he was up and they were out in the uh i guess they were in the woods or the wilderness on the mountain wherever you know they were out hunting or whatever and uh brother brandon began to share with some things about things that were going on with some brothers and the things that had happened well you know you know big brother perry green he got up there and he was just like he was just like well i'm gonna go give them a double anointing of texas you know he was just ready he was ready because you know brother perry green he wasn't no little fella but you know he was ready and and brother branham later on they were going down through they said you know he said if we had time he said we should just go over this way so those brothers over there he said we ought to go fellowship with them and brother perry had to pick his jaw up off the ground he's like ghost fellowship with them after that what they've done and he rebuked brother perry for his attitude he said brother that's the wrong attitude to have you shouldn't approach things like that because if they the way they act the way they do things shouldn't affect the way we handle them we should we should be able to hand because that's that's the work of god in our lives that we should handle them the way god would that when you know when as brother brown was talking about in the in the statue of a perfect man when you when you're dealing with your brother and you see the things that goes on and the things that he's he's had to battle and and the the battle of the different things he's going through and knowing how to handle it and understanding where your brother's coming from and under and so knowing how those are different you know to have brotherly kindness and and and patience and the different things with with your brothers and your sisters you know this is from the this is from the message the smyrna church age 1960 brother brown said god never intended the church to be run by men god runs his church and he runs it through gifts of the spirit the gifts of the spirit is in the church to correct the spirit he's got five ministerial offices in his church and i i wanted to emphasize that because you know some people some people think well it's just the spirit we know the the spirit and the gifts are in a man so you know and and as i've said many times and as as long as i i can't i'm i'm going to still say the same thing but you know i thank god for our pastor i thank god for the ministry and and i think what i think god what he's done for me through them and so when we talk about you know the the spirit yet there's a divine order how the spirit works so you know it's not it's not just floating here and there and running all over the countryside or whatever and and you know but but god has a divine order on how these things work and so when he says that he never intended to be run by man it was by the spirit of god well then the spirit of god is what's working in the man if you have if you have a real ordained god called man then it's the spirit you know because then the spirit is what's leading it's not the man that's leading so when when we see that you know so when he talks about it's the spirit that's running the church then yes it's the spirit of god in the man it's it's working through the he said through these offices he says first of them is apostles or missionaries and he says a missionary is one who's is the highest there is apostle the one that's the word missionary who means one sin apostle means one cent and he said why they ever chose to be called missionaries i don't know but their apostles are not apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors now that's the elected offices of god in his church then in each local church there's nine spiritual gifts that come come among the people that is knowledge wisdom he gifts of healing working of miracles tongue speaking with tons interpretation and i think the one that brother branham doesn't quote here i think is discernment of spirit i think is the other one and all these things go in each local body and each person in the church has an individual ministry and that individual ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of jesus christ so i wonder i want to read that because you know when we see when we talk about the the ministry and what god has for each one of us then you know we have to see that god called us to do something whether whether it's to sit on sit on the church pew and that's okay because you know there's some people that sit behind the scenes and you'll never see them they don't get up and sing because they couldn't carry a tone in a bucket i was talking to i was talking to a lady the other day and you know talking about people singing in church and i was like yeah you know asked me about me singing i told her i said yeah they like for me to sing the dismissal song and she's like what do you mean i said well that's how they get everybody out of the church quick you know i start singing they just run them out you know she started laughing i was like no it's not true but anyway uh but you know you know some people you know they could they could clear the building i mean if you know they would have that gift to be able to do that but you know everybody has has a gift and one of the things i want i want to say you know we don't try to push people into doing something but you know we want you that have a gift that god has given you a talent to do something then use it for the honor and glory of god that is a ministry you know i mean some people are very musically inclined and you know that that would be a great thing to use that's a great asset to have you know i mean you know some people couldn't find middle c on a piano to save their life and some people couldn't even tell you that there was a middle c on the piano because they never heard of that but you know god but see the thing is if if you know that god has blessed you with a talent and then then you know then if you will put that before god then god will cultivate that i've seen i've seen people that you know they they have they have a gift and then i said well you know they have to they have to practice something they have to work at something i was like well you know i have never ever seen anybody that does any kind of you know it doesn't matter what it is in this world that they ain't never practiced at it you know i mean let's take for instance uh michael jordan you know the great michael jordan you know and everybody talks about you know him being the the one of the greatest you know the basket that's ever played basketball i mean he he is like the standard that everybody looks at when they talk about basketball this is the same same young man that many years ago back in north carolina did not make his high school basketball team would stand outside in the pouring rain and shoot baskets making free throws now it wasn't that you know that he didn't have talent but it was something that he put in that he cultivated that to get to that place so it was it wasn't something that you know he was just automatically just born into that it just automatically just you know he just he just automatically done it but there was pride there was practice and you know it's just it's just like you know you look at some of the great composers of the world bach and beethoven and and the different ones you know somebody had to show them how to hold a violin somebody had to teach them the basics and they started them on the journey well then guess what it didn't take some of those composers very long and the teachers were like i can't teach them anything else but somebody had to start them on that journey they had to show them and so there was that was something that was they were blessed with but something had to take place and and you go back and look at the great men of this world somebody had to had to see that there was a gift that was inside of them and it had to be cultivated something had to take place when when abraham lincoln was was a was a small child and his mother passed away you know his dad all his dad thought of him was somebody that could go out and hold rows of corn and split logs for fencing and that's all he'd ever amounted to was a backwoods farmer but his stepmother when his stepmother came along his stepmother saw that god had a gift in that boy's life now she didn't know what he was going to do but she knew god was going to use him and she continued to tell him all the time that he needed to study and read and wanted him to have an education when his daddy wanted to have him in the fields all the time she kept telling him and that's the reason that one of the things that he talks about even brother i'm talking about him you know he had such a desire to study and he fed on the word of god and reading and reading fox's book of martyrs and pilgrims progress and he began to cultivate and you know he was he was one of the most amazing men that because of somebody that come from the backwoods of kentucky and yet when he wrote and he spoke he had such a biblical influence in his writing they said that there's never been another writer in the whole history that they can see of writings that was so influenced by the bible and here and here this man was that never went to college had you know just a few years of schooling but on his own he became a lawyer that god called him into this place and you know god he began to study and under grow and you know he had a lot of hardships and difficulties and different things that happened in his life but he overcame all of that to become what god wanted him to be and here's brother branham saying the greatest president that we ever had yet yet he had a gift in his life but you know what he had to go through hardships and he had to cultivate what god give him and you and i are the same way god gives us gifts but you know what they have to be cultivated they have to be worked at there has to be a struggle there has to be an overcoming through that you know just because you know god calls you to to be a minister you know well it just god just don't drop everything in your lap and then everybody thinks well god called brother branham and god gave brother branham the word and it just fell in his lap and i you know always point people back well let's let's go back and we'll read what brother ram said he read all the commentaries and he said he appreciated all the things that scofield wrote and all the different ones throughout the history and that he read everything that they had to say and so he began to study all of these things been reading so it wasn't like you know that he didn't read the scripture he didn't study he didn't pray he had a he had a great understanding of things but so then god when god and then when when he was preaching on the i think it was the 70 weeks of daniel and he was talking about those encyclopedias that was given to him he said you know that brother gave him he said well see brother he said i found this information i was looking for in those encyclopedias well see then the encyclo that was god working that he gave brother branham those encyclopedias for him to use them but you know what the book just didn't fall open and the page is scurrying and it's like in the light shown on this one section read this brother branham but you know that's what but sometimes you know we want to have some kind of supernatural thing to take place but you know the bible tells us he said to study to show thyself approved so it's not it's not you know you think about all the times that brother dale always talked about you know uh reading all those books and listening to two tapes and every single day doing the exact same thing reading all those books all listen all those tapes and just feeding on the word of god well you know what it wasn't like brother brandon or brother dale got something the lord just opened up every time that he read something he just opened up he just wasn't quick into him every single time but you know what he fed on that and he had something and that he held onto that for the lord to quicken that and so it's the same way with you and i if we can feed on the word then we have to have something there that has to be sown for it to be quickened so you know when we have when god calls us in the end of this ministry god calls us to a place then you know it takes a it takes work and it takes it takes time to and brother i'm talking about you know you yield yourself into that you know that you yield yourself to that position and find out what god calls you to and when we then we can find what god then we can exercise in that because you know if if god calls us in into the body and then as as we are as we come to faith then then there's a there's a growth development then they said add to add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance well as you're growing then you're becoming more but see that's all of that is taking place to bring you to a place that god can use you because you know you know it's it's good that when you have little children when your kids are little that you can teach them to do certain things that they that you know they can pick up after themselves and you know they they can they can put their plates away they can pick up their toys they can do certain things you know you don't have to get to a certain age you know you hopefully that that you don't have to tell them to blow their nose that they can figure out how to do that on their own you know there's as is you know because you you train a child and they learn how to go to the bathroom and do different things and you know you don't have to tell them to go wash their hands because they figure out how to do that because as as the child grows and then it becomes more things for them to do and then you know because you get to a place where you know what you don't have to tell your children all the time to when the trash can can's full to take it out praise the lord we're going to get there one day i know it i just believe it but you know there's a there's a growth where those things they take place but you know what they're there there's a greater time that's coming when when a child gets old enough to drive then guess what they can do things for you you know because you know it's like well you know when you know they you you buy all the groceries and they decide to they they have this uh unction of the spirit to eat everything in the house it's like well good now you can go to the store and get some more instead of me having to go get it then you can you can go get the groceries yourself and so you know as as time progresses as things go along as they grow up then there's other things for them to do and so as they can as they grow and become more mature then they they can have more responsibilities they can do more things and there's and there's more opportunities for them and so it's the same way in the gospel god gives us more as we become more mature christians then god is calling us up from being just just babes but coming up in the stature of the fullness of christ that we can become more like him that the world can see that we can be more of a ministry to the body not just not just being babes but as as as as we grow up in christ then then god can use us in the place that he wants us to where he wants us to what he wants us to do what he's called us to do and so you know we don't all we don't always get there right off the bat and it may be a slow process but you know what we if we keep our eye on the goal and not and that we see that god has called us to a place and god called us to minister to each other it's one of the things that that caught my attention about brother richard this weekend talking about the the four living creatures and he was speaking of you know being the with having the spirit of the ox and and being being a a burden bearer and you know going through all these things you know that's that's what we're called to do is be a minister to to be a servant as jesus as jesus said the time there and i believe it said mark you know he said that you know whoever is going to be the greatest among you he said let him be the servant of all you know if you want to be great then learn how to then learn how to be humble learn how to be small that's what god wants and so if we cannot learn how to be humble as as you know as a scripture what speaks of you know jesus he made no reputation of himself but but he humbled himself into the death of the cross and you know so he just became humble and and realized who he was and what god had called him to do you know as as many times you know the we spoke of before you know the old testament when the when you go back and look in the old testament when they saw what the mighty conqueror was coming to do the messiah was coming to conquer and yet they didn't realize that there was a whole other side of the ministry that was going to come that he was going to become of a humble birth be born of obey you know be born of a virgin that became a babe into the world and then that he would that he would suffer these things and you know come not not the way that they expected him but he become humble one because if it wasn't for spiritual eyesight that the lord had spoke to them they would have never saw him well because it was only to the elect that he came it wasn't to the rest of them and so they missed him because they didn't they weren't looking at it the way that god wanted them to the great the great leaders of the day the ones that had such great understanding and looking into the word but yet they lack the the revelation of the word they lack the leading of the spirit to show them the word they had created their own denominations brother branham said so they had their own ideas their own thoughts and when he came they missed him excuse me so i want to look at something here and when you look in the old testament and looking at the children of israel and this this may look a little a little bit off uh just bear just bear with me is this not a rabbit trail i don't think anyway uh but you know when you look in the old testament and you see the the um the children of israel go back to when uh jacob when he was in come out of you know come out of egypt uh when he was in egypt and um he had the all the all of his sons and you know he began to you know he's living in in egypt and all around the all of the the all the ites that were there that you know kind of tried to intermingle with them and and you know when we see how jacob was was there and when one of his uh daughters donna's in the scripture you know one of the princes of one of the cities uh took advantage of her and you know what when he when he took advantage of her you know had had two sons levi and simeon and you know they the the the prince wanted wanted their dog their their sister wanted jacob's daughter for his wife and you know he he wouldn't have that now he had done his uh i guess you'd call it um deceit this deceitfulness there but you know he pulled it he pulled and told him you know that that if you're going to go through this then you have to go through circumcision which they did and you know simmy and levi went in there and killed the whole you know they went and cleaned the house and and killed the whole city and you know and it it made jacob mad jacob jacob told him he said he said why have you done this and and we're we're in this location where we have all these heights around us and here here we are we're in this location he said you know they could come up and double up on us and then you know he said they could destroy us and and levi says you know he says he said but why would you allow your daughter to be treated as a harlot and then later on we see in the scripture in genesis 49 when when jacob and what's so amazing is he was so afraid but you know he was anointed he was anointed of god that he's that that he his seed because he was he was the seed of abraham and so that their seed would be innumerable so he couldn't be destroyed if he wanted to no matter what come against him because they couldn't be destroyed because he was the seed of abraham and they were supposed to still fulfill the the law the word of god but uh and and when jacob is is blessing the sons before he passes away he comes and he speaks of simeon and levi and he speaks and he says simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations he says o my soul come not bow into their secret unto their assembly mine honor be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their willful their self will they dig down a whale cursed be their anger for it is fierce and their wrath for it is cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel so the one thing that that you find in when he blesses the the sons and he places them in the promised land and he tells them what their what their possessions are he did not give a possession to simeon and he didn't give one to levi so that was the two that were left out now we know later on in the scripture that in joshua we find out that judah i'm sorry simeon gets a portion of judah's possession because he was giving it to him because they said our portion is too large he said so simeon will have this portion so the one that got left out was levi but you know it's it's an interesting thing when you when you begin to read this and and you and you see that when when they we see what happened but you know it was something that that struck levi that what levi was going to do was he was going to stand where nobody else was going to stand and then we see later on that in in the scripture that the levites were the ones that when they when they had their gathering with the golden calf and and the different things and god rose up to rebuke them the levites were the ones that rose up to destroy the children of israel and so they were they were the ones and then brother branham here and this is from questions and answers 1954 brother branham says he said now one day there was sin in israel and there was a man by the tribe of the name of levi he said they pulled their swords and they went they went with moses to the camp and they destroyed everything that was seen is that right god looked down and said because you did this and stood for me your all these others will serve you you go right into the temple as priest is that right you stay right in the temple and the rest of them will work and bring you in a tent and take care of you is that right oh hallelujah if you can see what the temple was that the levites was the bride now when sin is awakening on every hand the levites is pulling their sword the holy ghost born bride is standing out saying jesus christ in the positive is jesus christ in the negative just the same sin is still sin god says come you now blessed of my father that is the bride so when and and so i i wanted to i want to to show these things because when when he begins to speak of of levi and levi was the one that didn't have a portion in the land they were they were cut out but we say that brother uh in in deuteronomy chapter 10 he says he said at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the the lord to minister unto him and to bless his name unto this day wherefore levi have no part nor inheritance with his brethren the lord is his inheritance as according as the lord thy god promised him so then then we see that the rest of them had a portion in the land but god because of what they done what they stood up for god became their portion and god separated the levites out from the rest of the children of israel to be unto thee unto him numbers chapter 3 and and it says and the lord spake unto moses saying bring the tribe of levi near and present them before aaron the priest that they may minister unto him and they shall keep his charge and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle the congregation to do the service of the tabernacle and they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation and the charge of the children of israel to do the service of the tabernacle we've got there and thou shalt give the levites unto aaron and to his sons they are holy given unto him out of the children of israel and thou shalt appoint aaron and his sons and they shall wait on their priest's office and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death so when he begins to speak of them being cut off because jacob was so upset with them that he said you're not going to have a portion in the land but you know what that's exactly what god wanted because god realized that you know what that's all right because i'm going to be your portion and of all the rest of them had a portion but god had his portion for levi in the land the levites were going to be he is and brother branham says and and this is this is from uh who do you say this is uh from 1964 and and brother branham says now it it was then hallelujah when moses stepped forth and said who's for me and god amen he said it was the levite pulled his sword and went through the camp and utterly stray slayed everything that was connected with it amen everything every man that had a moabite woman they killed him right there together killed them right together now the hour has come he said where is that man where is aaron's sons come of the priesthood that's willing to pull the so the word of god this sharp two-edged sword said now who stands for me and god where is he at can invite invite but nobody answers see what i mean we don't get it he said there's something wrong notice there they was it was then that moses stood and said these things he said notice their sin that they did there when they denominated themselves with moabite and made them one body their sin was never forgiven them i'm just going to coast on that a minute he said it's late but just a minute their sin was never forgiven them not one of them ever made it the promised land ever made the promised land jesus said excuse me saint john 6 he said in saint john 6 when they said our fathers ate manna in the wilderness they were pentecostal brothers they eat manna they had the real thing jesus said and they're everyone dead they perished they're eternally gone their sin was never forgiven then what did they do they broke the covenant with god and organized with balaam the hiring prof the hireling prophet that wouldn't take the warning of god wouldn't take the take the word of god wouldn't take nothing of god but he was determined to get them all one can you see the folly i can stay on that for a long time but i think you get it's either their sin never was forgiven not one of them that lived under those blessings and eat that manna and everything so there was one group that stood up that god called and they they didn't have a portion but god gave them a portion and they were the ones that stood up and when nobody else did they were the ones that stood and took charge and because of what they done that god honored them and set them aside and said them to himself and said they will serve aaron see in the original when god called them into the building of the tabernacle and setting the priesthood the only ones that could serve in the portion of the tabernacle and the priesthood and the sacrifices everything was aaron and his sons but the levites were set aside now they were called out people that were set aside and they were to minister to aaron and his sons and so there was a portion that was given to them but they were a set aside people but they was given a ministry that was set aside from the priesthood but they were still called of god and was given a portion and so when brother branham goes back and and he says and said if you understand the temple he said you see that the levites are the bride so then then we understand that when the bride the bride everybody the bride has a ministry will the bride have a ministry yes and brother ryan says yes the maid of apostles provide a preacher evangelist and pastors but you know what that didn't do away with the other portion of the of the levites you know there was a portion that was called to do one thing and you know they were called they were singers there was a portion of the levites and they were musicians and there was and there was a portion of the levites that never served never served in the office of the priest but you know what you couldn't be you couldn't be a priest without being a levite but you could be a levite without being a priest now lots of times when you go into the scripture and you read them it's an interchangeable word but when you begin to read the scripture and you see that there is a distinction made between the levites and the priests but see god called them a separated people anointed people god that give them and they gave them he was their inheritance he gave them an inheritance and they were called to a position but see the thing is is they didn't they didn't do this other part but they had their own part to do so when you see when we when you speak of having a ministry understanding that you know that we're all called of god and we're all anointed of god and we all have the same inheritance but you know what god has called us to a different portion so that we all have to find our part to find out what god wants us to do so god didn't call us all to be the exact same thing but there's parts that we have to do now when we go into the scripture here in numbers i want to i want to read a few scriptures here from numbers chapter 3 and when brother when moses began to to lay this out and he began to speak to the children of israel and he begins to talk to aaron about what was to take place and how everything because the one thing that they had to learn though in the first part of the of the of the book you know moses are writing and these and he's telling them hey listen when you build when you build the tabernacle the tabernacle has to be you know each each pole has to be a certain length and it has to be made of this and you and you and you and the altar has to be made of this and you know it has to be this much gold and everything has to be a certain way and the length of the curtains have to be so long and the cords have to be a certain color and all these caps and all these different things there's a different part that everything lays out and they all built all these parts that they built a tabernacle and then he said he said then the the cloud of day was the the pillar of fire at night and the cloud by day was there and he said you know what he said the presence of the lord would come down and he said well he would stay there and he said while he was there when the cloud was there he said they stayed but you know there was a there's an interesting part of what had to take place they had to move when the when the cloud began to move or the pillar fire began to move whether it was day or night you know what they had to pick up and move they followed the cloud wherever the cloud was going they were going so the thing is that you have to low not only have to put everything together and know where all the portions go there was an interesting part that had to be taken that had to take place is everybody had to know how to take this thing down and load it up everybody had to have their part now in numbers chapter 3 we see and it says and he and he takes moses uh god calls moses and he tells him to take the three of the sons and he says and the charge of verse 25 he says and the charge of the sons of gershon and the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle and the tent and the covering thereof and the hang of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the hangs of the court and the curtain of the door of the court which is by the tabernacle and by the altar roundabout and the cords of it and all the service thereof and then we go to verse 29 and it says and the families of the sons of cough shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward and so that's another thing that you find out is the children of israel had to lay had to be in divine order around the tabernacle where the the the levites had to do the same thing because you know aaron and moses and they were on the east side of the tabernacle but you know they even had to be laid out in in their divine order also that and it says and the chief of the house of the father of the families of kohites shall be elephant the son of uzio and their charge shall be the ark the table the candlestick and the altars and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister and the hanging and all the service thereof and eliezer the son of aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the levites and have the oversight of them to keep the charge of the sanctuary and then and then we see if we drop down in verse 36 it says and under the custody in charge of the sons of mirari shall be the boards of the tabernacle and the bars thereof and the pillars thereof and the sockets thereof and all the vessels thereof and all that serveth thereto and the pillars of the court round about and their sockets and their pens and their cords so not only was it was they given a portion that each one of them had to do when it was when the tabernacle was broke down they just all didn't pitch in and do their own thing but god called them each even in that portion that they had to do their own part of breaking down the tabernacle and it was given each one of them that each one of them had to follow their own part and what what i thought was so interesting about this is you know when when david decides hey we're going to bring we're going to bring the ark of the covenant down and he says you know here we are we're going to put them on we're going to put on an ox cart because you know this is the new modern way of doing things and then brother brown says you know it was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the levites but you know what was so amazing according to the scripture it didn't have you couldn't just have any levite touch the ark of the covenant because god called those the only certain ones that could have that sound like a condenser fan is going something's out there anyway praise the lord but you know each but he said he said when they come he said he said when the the brother ham said that when when the ark began to slide and he said the levite could only touch it but only one only a certain part of the levites could do that because only certain ones of them and yeah it was carried on the shoulder of the levites but you know what not every levite was called to carry the ark not every not every part of not all the levites were called to do every certain part they were all given a certain portion to do and so then when you see the god has called each one to do their part then when it when there's a part to be done then what god called you to that's your part and then you know it's important to do your part to understand what your part is so and and so from uh reading uh this is from uh first corinthians here when when peter paul's speaking of the gifts and he says now he said now there are diversities of gift but the same spirit he said there are differences of administrations but the same lord he said there are diversities of operations but is the same god which worketh all in all he said but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to prophet with all so we understand that there are diversities of gifts and all these things it's the same spirit that works through all these gifts and different the same lord but he said that the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit the whole body so that it's too so you know you know when you see you know so when you see that god called you to do some you know to be a a part of this body whatever it is then you know what you know we're going to be incomplete without you whatever whatever part that you do it's incomplete because you know god's not complete without you whatever whatever little part you think that that you think is is is so insignificant but god called you and it's it's still to god it has a part so there's a portion for each one and it says and for one he said it's given the spirit of the word of wisdom to the word of knowledge and to another the faith and so he said to another working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits another kind another diverse kinds of tongues another the interpretation of tongues but all these work if that one and the same self spirit dividing to every man severally as he will so then you know everybody has a part but you know you can be you can be used in more than one office and one have more than one gift operating because you know the spirit of the lord because you know god get god's in control and he does how however he wants to do it and so if if he wants to if he wants more than one person to have more than one gift and that's then that's the way he has it's his uh prerogative or you know that's his divine will of how these things will go they said for as the body is one and half many members all the members of that one body being many are one body all so also is christ he said for by one spirit we're all baptized into one body whether it be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit he said for the body is not one member but many he said if the foot shall say because i am not the hand am i not the body is it therefore not the body if the ear shall say because i am not the i am i not the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole uh the whole body where i where were the hearing if the whole we're hearing where were the smelling but now have god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him so you know you know god doesn't have doesn't make accidents y'all don't have accidents and things just don't happen by happenstance but you know what god has called each one of you and each one of us to a place at his own pleasure at his own divine will and he said if if they were all one member where were the body now are there many members yet but one body they said in the eye cannot say unto hand i have no need of thee nor again the hand of the foot i have no need of you name much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our own calmly parts have more abundant comeliness for our commonly for our commonly parts have no need but god have tempered the body together having given more abundant order to that part which lacked that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another so when you look at your body even even the smallest parts that you think are not significant and yet yet they are more significant and they are having given more honor because you know when you you know because even even a child when when they're young you know they have they have modesty because you know what they have a they have a reaction because you know what they'll cover themselves up and so there's certain parts that you know that that we we give honor to and other ones that we don't have to you know you don't have to wear a hat but there are certain parts that do have to be covered and you know you have to look over these these ones you care about so there's care that's given to these other parts that so you know even even though they may look insignificant even even the smallest part of your body you know you all you all you gotta do is get a paper cut or a splinter and you know what they you know they talk about you know having having you know gunshot wounds and a lot of pain it's like well sometimes one of the worst aggravating pains you can have is a is a splinter it'll drive you up the wall but so you know and so when we see these things we think you know these may not have a a a function that that is like any other one but yet they're still a part of the body and you know it says can you can you say well because you're not this i got no need of you well you got to do is wait to wait till it gets cut one time find out if you if you need it or not if if you if you miss it or not you know i i cut my finger washing dishes when i was a kid and uh i had my hand telling brother luis i think was i had my hand down in the glass and i was washing and thing broke the whole side of it just popped off and i cut my hand and i sliced that thing right there back and it just laid open and let me tell you what i thought i was going through the ceiling but you know i still got the scar right there and you know it ain't never it's always been odd looking because it and you know what you know it's like well that's kind of insignificant but you know what it was significant that day it was significant for a while i didn't i didn't i i only speak english but i think i could have spoken other languages that day but you know what it's it's it may be insignificant but you know what it still has has an importance and because he says you know he said so much more these members of the body which seem to be more feeble or more necessary and those those members of the body which think less honorable upon these we bestow more honor and our uncommonly parts we have more abundant calmlyness for our calmly parts have no have no need but god have timbered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked that there should be no schism in the body so then all all the parts no matter how small or insignificant or whatever they all have a part and they have to all work together but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it and ye are the body of christ and members in particular and god has set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets third teachers after that miracles then the gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues he said are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret he said but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way so then all of those things and you know every part has it has its part and it all has to work together so he you know so we're not all doing the exact same part but we all have to work together it all works together and so there's a part that each one of us have to do for it to for it to work right you know because you know you know if you if you've ever have have a problem in your in your body the one little part then you know other parts of the body have to compensate for that you know you know because and you know when you when you um like me when you when you when you break your elbow and you can't move your arm you know it um you don't you don't do a lot you know because you know it's like they said well move your move your arms like listen we ain't moving this arm i was black and blue and everything else and you know it was like i couldn't you know i was like i kept my arm right there that's all i wanted i didn't want to move it you know and sarah had to help him take a shower and then you know they want you to move it they want to look at he's like no we ain't moving this it hurt too bad to move it and you know because you know i could i couldn't hardly move this thing out and it was like i was trying to hold it sarah was trying to hold it was trying to move it so i know you know you know i want some pain medicine y'all gonna plan on moving this thing if y'all plan on doing anything we're gonna we're gonna have to make some accommodations because this ain't working and so you know when you see people when they when they go through things and and i think it's sister monica you know when you when you when you have a you go through your you know a problem with you like with your hip you know and then everything has to compensate and that affects every other part of your body and so you know everything so you know the god doesn't doesn't have you know you know what we're we're just going to you know because you know it's like you know you know here's a body with missing feet or here you got one that you know you got one foot that works and one that don't or even even if it's a finger or whatever little part it all has to work together it all has to function together and so you know when we begin to see these things you know all of these things have to work and all of us have to be an integral part of this and so when we see that what god has called us and and because you know because it's part of the of your family your your family and then you know the families make up the local assembly and so we make up this body of believers here which which is a family and so each one has a portion but you know each one of these that god has called us to you know god has called you here to be a part of this family of this body to do what god has called you to do and so you know what we can't we can't be a whole body without you and you without you doing your part and so you know when we see how how the ministry that you know what we do here is a ministry whether whether you get up and and all you do is take up the offering well then praise god you know you have a ministry that you're important that you function as a part of this family as a part of this body and then when we see that we all come together we all bring our licks of fire together and we all work together and we all edify one another and we all uplift one another and we all do that as a body then the others think that when you step up just a little bit higher than when you see then you know then we see that the bride at this age then we see that all the body the believers that you know we work as this body here this church but you know what we're connected with every other believer in this age all the believers around so that we're all still the body of christ so you know what then when the when the when the the ones in in central america when they hurt and when they have needs then you know what do we minister to them well because that's part of the body when they're on the other side of the world and you know they don't have modern conveniences and they don't have a lot of things and you know then you know what then we minister to them in the way that we that we can when you know i think about when one brother biscuit years ago he was uh i believe he went to india i believe it was where it was but you know he went and he was talking to the to the brothers over there and uh and uh when he went over there and he was uh talking to the uh might have been the philippines but anyway uh when he was talking to the brothers about how many many books that they had and he was talking about all the ministers over the years people had went over there and ministered and then brother biscuit was like how many books do you have brother and he was talking about you know he had they had ministers that had been preaching the message they had been following and they only had three message books and you know and some some of them only had one some of it somebody didn't have any soil just had a few and that's all the message that they had and it really stirred something brother biscuit you know what to get them the message what do we have to do to get them the message and so you know then it became a part of the body to help minister well because that was that was a commission that was given to to spread the gospel to preach the gospel to get them because we have to get this and i thank god for what god has done over the years that he's taken and we have all these modern conveniences now that we have all the technology to do that but for years you know there was brothers that that labored they labored in the word to get what they had when you when you talk about the this night back in the 60s when when when brother dale and them you know waiting on books out of jeffersonville and you know they were they were jacobs because they were going to get their books when you think about brothers they went and had to travel overseas you know some of these brothers they would travel to other places and sit down and listen to brother branham and they would write their own notes they would write their own message books to have the word they would write their own they would listen to other tapes and they would write the whole message and that would be copies of the message that they had see sometimes sometimes we think about that you know we don't we don't put into it what god what other people have we have not we have not because you know what when we have it in in every every kind of format that you can think of and we allow other things to hold us back when other people have to travel and they have walked and traveled and paid to ride on buses to go find and listen to the voice of the prophet when we can listen to it 24 hours a day seven days a week and sometimes you know what we don't have time to listen to it we ain't got time to read we ain't got time to pray when other people have done everything under the sun and because you know what they would give up their last breath they would give up their food to go and listen to something or be able to listen and read something from the scripture or read something from the message and how how weak are we when we don't do the exact same thing when we don't when we have come to church and you know what we don't take the time to pray before we come when we've not spent time before god and you know i'm not you know i'm preaching on myself because i'm i'm in that category i'm guilty just like anybody else but you know what it it's it's for us to put the time in god called us to administer if we plan on coming getting closer to god and coming and getting to a place and realizing that today the day that we live in when we see the the hour in which we live is such a late hour and we don't have time to play we don't have time to play that we have that we need to you know lord help me that i can be more and i have more zeal that i have that i have more concern about what needs to be done because you know what because that's what it's going to take to get out of here it's going it's going to take us to draw a little closer uh uh us to shed off the things that hold us back to move up a little closer in god because that's what god wants us because you know he's there drawing us that it's us to answer that to that drawing and then walk in that that we can become more because you know if it's if it's our day that god what god has called us in this day and i'm gonna try to i'm gonna try to close but what god has called us in this hour is to take a body change then you know what then we've got the only way that you're going to get a body change is not talking about it but you're going to have to get in the word until the word gets in you and then the word becomes quick and then you become the word then we have to we have to lay aside every weight and every and every sin that so easily besets us and run the race that god's called us to why because god's given us a ministry was like well what kind of ministry within that's what we have to find out to find out what god has called you to and so we see that this what god has called us to this age and then we see that that hebrews 11 40 says they without us cannot be made perfect well then you know what if if if paul run his race and irenaeus run his race and all the ones down through time all these other ones these great men have run their race and done their part then you know what then we have to meet them with the same conviction with the same zeal with the same desire to do the exact same thing that they've done that we have to now we have to run the race the way they did then we have to then we have to lay aside everything that that we could that we can bring because you know what they're waiting on us they're waiting on us we have been it's our day that's been given this challenge to come to this place and but they realize realize god has called you to this god just like the levites god you're a separated people that god has separated to this god has given us an inheritance god has given us a portion god has anointed us to this that god has called us to this to operate in this way then get into our job is to come when we come to the house of god then you know what we should we shouldn't have you know all the things we should be able to shed all the things of the world and come in and worship god you know we should be able to get behind the pastor we should get behind the preacher you know what we should be able to pull on the gift we we should operate in a different realm you know i i think sometimes you know some of the when you go back and read some of the uh old uh stories of of those men that you know all the things that just like john wesley all the all the years that he had to travel and you know and go on horseback and all those different things and and all the things that people had to suffer through you know peter cartwright you know going in there i always always liked that story you know when he went in that bar and he told that man he was going to have church and that man come in there and told him said listen if you plan on having church in here said you got to whip me and he said well that's just the next thing i'll do then just like cleaning the floor and mopping the way you know cleaning the windows and everything like that well just whipping this other guy didn't matter to him it's the same thing if we come to the house of god then we should come in in the right attitude we should come with the right thought in the right spirit what god has called us to you know not to not allow the devil to hold us back but god has called us and every one of us have a ministry i want everybody to understand it's a body ministry it's not just one person it's not it's no big eyes or little use but you know what we're all a poor we're all part of this and we're all important to this we're all precious in the sight of god and all of us have to work together to do this i want i want i want to be i want to be faithful and i i i you know i don't want to be like like any other time in my life i don't i don't i want to be i want to turn all out away i don't i don't want to act like that anymore i want all that in the past i want to i want to press toward the mark i want i want i want to do i want to be exactly what god wants me to be i i you know i have a desire for you know for our young people and for my children you know whatever it takes i want i want god to get a hold of them i want them to have an experience for themselves i want them to know not just not just books and tapes and belt buckles and all these things but i want them to know what the life of jesus christ is i want them to know what the new birth is not some kind of idea or thought but i want them to know what it is to pass from death unto life i want i want my children to know what that means i want i want them to when they see me i don't want them to see just daddy but i want them to see jesus christ i want everybody to see that i want i want i want everybody even the neighbors i want everybody to know that the lord get a hold of me mold me and make me into your image i want that's what that's my desire let's all stand this evening have the musicians come but you know what god has called us to apart and i i don't i don't want to just be another service when we come in but i i want i want to be i want to get on so far on so far for god that everybody catches them amen i appreciate each one of you and 288 red book [Music] troublesome times are here filling men's hearts with fear freedom [Music] will [Music] love is so [Music] when these signs come during to end at last it will come very fast troubles will sound jesus [Music] the trumpets will sound all

bless you tonight regular service all right well before we go sister rebecca wants to give a testimony so [Music] you'll have that turn come on uh thank the lord just um i want to give a quick testimony well it's kind of lengthy but i won't i'll shorten it um i always want to give the testimony because i want god to keep giving them to me i want god keep giving me testimonies i don't want to keep holding it in and you forget about it god is real in my life and um anything he does i want to keep sharing it and encourage anybody else to do the same so um anyway i'm gonna call this one when i'm weak he's strong when i'm weak he's strong the other day um when we left sunday um the test came right away right when i got in my car and looked at my phone i was faced with something i had to deal with so um anyway i got a message from uh a family member and um these were the people this is my my my youngest son uh grandmother so you know they're up north or whatever and they knew me when i was not living right so i'm still dealing with some stuff with that but anyway the test came in i got a text message and uh it caught me off guard a little bit and my flesh wanted to handle it in a way my old nature would have you know i'm saying i wanted i wanted to like kind of snap a little bit ain't gonna lie and uh but i was i was driving home and i'm like oh my god we just got out of service um i can't no i'm not giving myself no credit this is for god okay so i didn't know how to handle it i didn't know how to operate in love because i was angry with this situation and i felt like i don't have that love just yet you know like i was praying lord give me that love because i don't i don't have it and i don't want to be phony i know um the prophet says they know when you acting so you can't just put on that like you love somebody and they they can feel when you don't know when you got some tension there so i'm just being honest with the lord like god i just don't have it yet to respond to this right now so give me give me something you know give me give me something give me a crumb give me a give me the right attitude at least before i respond like give me the right attitude and i was serious with him and um i always believed like when you keep it real with god he he honors that you know i feel that way that's how he's dealt with me i just keep it real i ain't got it yet i'm gonna need you to help me to get it till i get there so um i was like lord just give me the right attitude before i respond because you know how that little flesh want to react right away without even thinking first well that's all i get sometimes to be honest so um i was like lord give me the right attitude to just respond in the right way so that this thing don't just turn into something they don't have to turn into so anyway um he did that he gave me the right attitude and he he was able to just calm me down and just answer the situation um with humility and i appreciated that he gave me a crumb and that's what i asked for just a little bit of something with the right attitude and that whole situation turned out to be some so different and so better than if i would have handled it wrong it would it would have it would have just satan would have had an open door to come in and just mess things up and uh right now my my youngest son need me to get along with that side of the family because he's he's only three years old and i need things to go right because i'm trying to get him but satan wants to come in and just destroy things you know what i'm saying so i just want to thank god for giving me the uh strength i need through his strength when i'm weak all right so um it's one more testimony but i hold off on that i know it's kind of late um but it was it was about me and isaac he might not want me to share that but he's smiling so i guess he do and um the other day ain't gonna lie the test has come the testes are easy when it's dealing with outsiders you know you can go on your way and okay bye and go on your way whatever my test has come when i'm with my family sometimes i don't know about nobody else so um it was between me and my son one day was in the house and uh it was kind of late so i just told them early on that okay we're gonna kind of do the dishes and clean up a little bit before it get too late and we heading back to sleep or whatever so he knew that so anyway it was about seven o'clock and um a little bit after seven and i came in this room i was like okay let's let's go ahead and knock out a few things so we can get ready for bed so um he came out or whatever and um he had like a little attitude first you know he had a little attitude why you wait so late so in my mind i'm like okay well i already tell you was gonna clean up you know why you wait so late you know you could have did it earlier and getting all into that so i'm feeling myself boiling up like okay my mind going into everything i do for you and uh the past the future oh when your coach tell you do something you do it for him why you got to argue me my mind going into the whole future the past everything right so i'm getting upset based on what i'm thinking about you know it's all in the head i'm getting upset more and more he upset so um by this time you know how the scriptures say a soft word turn away wrath well i might it i wasn't being soft either you know so i'm getting all upset with him we're talking back and um back and forth each other and um it's escalating because i'm getting more and more upset he's getting more upset so um at this point i tell him you know god said just just go outside the door and stand out there whatever just get out you know what i'm saying i'm getting like that just get outside the door and just stand out there because both of us are getting together ain't helping so um he go outside and i'm i can't keep quiet because i'm still upset he's outside the door and he hear me upset still talking so he's talking now my mind's thinking about the neighbor and then all this stuff so i'm like well come back in the house he come back in the house we're both still yelling or whatever at each other and in my spirit i feel myself wanting to calm down but i can't cause i'm just already giving it out i'm giving out the wrath already so i'm like man you know so he's upset and um you know i'm getting warm up saying more and more things i'm thinking i'm all in my emotions so i'm saying more and more stuff and uh he's upset the dishes are not getting done by now he he's um he you know i'm saying i don't know if he won't be terribly supportive i'm just keeping it real so um i'm getting him upset and i'm not helping because i'm not calming down myself and um so he he walks off and he punches two holes in the wall and while i'm talking i'm seeing this and it's like everything happening in slow motion you know what i mean so two big holes in the wall and i'm like at this point you gotta get up out of here you got to go you got to get out the house i can't think no more so i'm not in a calm state of mind where i'm like you know um well you know let's sit there and talk about it i'm heated you know he heated so um he got his little book bag and left out the door and um since there's nobody to argue with you you kind of calming down now you know like okay ain't nobody to fuss with i'm talking to myself like man i gotta find him somewhere to go boot camp something you know because your mind is in the future you thinking this gonna be a young man one day you know how in the world we'll handle this so all these thoughts are in my mind boot camp army everything you know you're trying to figure out the future in five seconds or five minutes right so i'm like man you know so anyway i go in my room and uh some something happens to me while i'm in the heat of my moment something just stops me and say pray for him because you just put him out you know so i started praying oh my god i'm so mad right now and i i'm so mad i don't want to calm down but lord he's out there lord jesus and i i'm i'm sorry but please just do something for him lord do something for me because i'm really upset and um you know i i don't feel right about this whole thing you know so uh while i'm praying i get a phone call and i thought it was him because it was an unknown number so i pick it up and it's actually uh another sister and she asked me you know how i'm doing so i just kept it real when i'm like you know right now i'm just really upset man my son got into and i just told him to get out and um she said sister you know um i'm gonna tell you something and she said i know you're upset right now but um you know he's 14 years old and for him to be out there that can be a domino effect because i used to she said she used to work for the authorities or whatever she said if something happened to him while he's out there they're gonna come to you she said um i know you're upset right now but just calm down and she told me a few testimonies about her and her kids she got some older kids too she said just just love on him when he called just love on him forgive him he need a place to feel safe right now you know he's a teenager he might be going through stuff and he's just not communicating with you and you just don't understand everything because you know they don't always share everything and she said just love on him don't even worry about the hole in the wall tell him something like you know you needed him walls knocked down anyway he can probably knock down the rest of the wall so you're going to make it bigger than that so she just gave me like a sense of humor with it and um should i just love on him for giving don't even worry about it you know sis just forgive him and and let him know you're here for him if he need you and you can talk to him and just let him feel safe where he can come to you and talk to you if he needs to you know because you never know what they're going through and i'm listening to her and i know she's ministering to me and in my spirit i feel like it is so true you know it's so true and i'm calming down more and more and i'm like yeah you know man you know so i get another phone call while she's talking and it's isaac and isaac's like mom i'm so sorry i love you and i apologize and um i'm so sorry you know i i'm sorry about the hole in the wall and everything so by this time i'm calm so i'm like you know i was like i'm i'm so sorry too forgive me forgive me for getting like that and um and i love you so much and don't worry about the hole in the wall you know and where you at right now anyway he's like well i'm at my friend house i know their little friend was at he said well i'm over there right now so i can come get get you if i want he was like no i just want to be here for a minute so i said okay okay just let me know and i can come get you if you're ready or whatever if you want to walk back so um he came home first of all i think the sister like sister thank you so much that was god that had you called just now you know and uh she isaac came home i love my son but we never loved on each other the way we did when he came home i mean we were just so i don't know how many times we hugged that night and just apologized to each other that night and it was god grace that stepped in when i was weak he's strong and he stepped in and he saved that situation when you know you just don't know what to do sometimes things just happen off track sometimes you're tired you're worried for the day you're just not handling things right i don't always handle it right but when god steps in his grace covers that whole thing and i don't remember man isaac ever really loving it on each other like that i know we love each other but god grace came in and just it was a whole difference it was it made me humble myself like you know i was isaac whenever i get upset i'll go for a ride i won't put you out like that anymore that's crazy you know what i'm worried i'm thinking about you know so um it's just got grace and i just wanted to share those things just just some everyday real life stuff you know while god helping me to grow and helping us to grow and showing grace when um when i don't know how to do it you know so that's it amen amen well god bless you tonight and appreciate that god's grace is real it gets us through everything so god bless you tonight and uh look forward to sunday and uh also uh my bible study we got not not that saturday but the following saturday so praise
