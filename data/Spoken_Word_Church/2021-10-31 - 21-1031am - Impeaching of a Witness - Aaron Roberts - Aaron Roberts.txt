the lord and certainly our young ones our kids we pray god we'll just continue to deal with them amen you know my dad told me he said you know not too long ago he said john and my dad you know he was

just appreciate the lord blessing them and appreciate brother dale allowing them to go and help them get there and everything you know everything we do for the kingdom of god we won't know all what

going to be a great day over there we'll get to see all of the things that you know many times we we don't look you know the one of the things that kind of what we might talk about this morning but you the devil that's his job he likes to cloud your vision and you know hide things but you know what it's nice to as peter said stir up your your pure minds in a way of remembrance when you get to looking back at the things and you know we're going to see one of these days all the things that we've overcome all the former things are going to be passed away we're going to know that we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony so it's going to be a great day but we're having a great day today and just one member brother wade and brother ultic and the different ones and

from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all and what he has seen and heard he that testified and no man receiveth his testimony he that hath received his to his testimony has set to his seal that god is true for whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him the father loveth the son and have given all things into his hand he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life he that believeth not on the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him and then we're going to go to acts chapter one very familiar scriptures here and it says the former treatise have i made oath theopolis of all that jesus began to to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy spirit had given commandments unto the disciples whom he had chosen to whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of him forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and all judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth god bless you this morning baby seated [Music] it's getting warm up here i don't know if y'all if y'all know we had a little issue with the air conditioner we got heat we got no air conditioning so we we can get all if you're cold you can get hot all you want but we'll have to work on that in in in the future but this morning i want to speak on impeaching of a witness and uh the i want to read the quote from the message the testimony of a true witness and brother branham says he says now a testimony he said before a person has has to have an experience before they can testify if you were called in court and you have to give a testimony you have to know something before you can testify and a witness is a person that has seen something that knows that it is the truth and they're called to give witness and then a witness must know what he's talking about he must not he must be not someone told me a certain certain thing he must be the witness himself if not he's speaking of someone else that could be a witness at the scene he said no i think that being that we see out from our congregation that life is so fragile then death that is so positive a positive not like death is a positive thing but it is something that carries you through so it's just an avenue to get into the presence of god but you know i mean it is something that we all have to face so one of the things we i will look at this morning is because if death is is something that's certain see it's when when brother talking about bypassing death he's not really talking about you're going to bypass death because the last enemy to be destroyed is death so it's not like we're going to go around it like we're going by but we're going to overcome it so it's not that it's not that we're going you know everybody's know you're going to face death as brother brown said you know you're just going to wipe it off but he's still going to come you're still fighting the effects of death every day you're still getting older we're all getting older we're all still having problems we're still faking that thing but you know what but we're going to overcome it because as the scripture said see he overcame and so then if we are a part of him then if he overcome that we overcome he's overcome these things he said we need to come to a place that we are positive sure that this that we speak of is right see it is not nothing that we can just haphazardly as we would would say accept it you've got to be positive sure that it's right because we do not know what kind of of an end that we will come to and he says that's the reason i'm that i am a calvinistic thinker a security of security of the believer is because that i believe that when a man or a woman is in their right mind that is in the time to that is is the time to accept the lord jesus and get it all settled in once forever because when we come to the end of the road we don't know just where how we're going to be sick we may be sick in our mind there there might be a fever that you know that would really cook our very brain and we might not might not say anything or do anything at the end of the road we don't know but you see if we have already anchored in christ no matter what sickness takes us or what condition we are what we are when we go it's already settled we are sealed unto the day of our redemption ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed until the day not of your death but of your redemption see after death's done over you're still sealed so this morning when we speak of being a part of god and being a witness and just reading the scriptures here brother brown said when he read john and one of them talks about a testimony and the other one he said talks about a witness and so this morning i want to speak on being a witness but impeaching of a witness and the um definition of impeach means to dispute to disparage deny or contradict he said to attempt to prove that a witness has not told the truth or has been inconsistent by introducing contrary evidence including statements made outside of the courtroom in dispositions or in statements of the witness heard by another so when we speak of having an impeaching of a witness then there's there's three witnesses that has to has to be uh looked at this morning that we won't look at and and the and the first one is god and when we look at god being a witness because god spoke yes and in the and we'll see here in a minute you know brother branham said i believe it was in the message at thy word brother branham says that god believed his own word and the things come into existence and then we we see that jesus was a witness jesus was a witness of the father he was a manifestation and so we said we see and then there is the witness of you and i we are we are a witness and so you know because brother branham said one time he was talking about political parties and you know when you when you start talking about political parties that's how you get into impeachment because you know that's the big thing now you know you don't like somebody going to get rid of them but you know when you when you begin to look at this and brother branham says you know he said god voted for me and he said the devil voted against me but he said i voted with god he said so i know my vote's right and he said he said because he said you know they were talking about political parties he said my party's in heaven so i know i know where i'm where i'm voting from but you have to make that decision but see if we're going to be if we're going to be a a witness to see the things of god then we have to believe what has been told and so as as brother m talked about in a court trial you know he began to put the the word of god and and the holy spirit on trial and and say you know is this really true and we're gonna we're gonna prove whether it's right or not and so you know you have to decide whether it's true or not but you know the scripture there where it talks about in acts acts 1 and 3 i thought was so good because and he says he said to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many many infallible proofs so he began to show to the disciples that he was alive and the things that he had done and you know as we've covered the last few uh sermons you know we've been talking on the on the life of christ and looking at it and and bringing the parallel a little bit between seeing this message and seeing that the life of jesus christ and this message is the same because it's one and the same and it's not anything different but it's the exact same thing it's the life of jesus it's the word of god because he was the word he is the word made flesh and that's what we've received in our day is the word made flesh again so there's no difference between what we've received and what was written in the old in the new testament and what we've seen because you know many people you know they they want to try to disparage or discourage and contradict this message but they can't the more that they've tried to tear it down the more they can't tear it down why because god never has been without a witness he's always had a witness and you know what when when everything comes when he said when when the enemy comes in like a flood he said he'd raise up a standard against it he'll always have an answer but you know the thing is you because those that are believers there's no power in hell there's nothing that's going to take them away from believing but those that are unbelievers it doesn't matter you're not ever going to get them to believe you know brother bran was talking about that man that didn't believe in divine healing and he stood there and he was like i don't care how many doctors you bring up here he said i don't believe in divine healing he said i don't care what evidence you bring and brother ram said well that's true he said because it wasn't for you he said but it was for them that would believe it's for those that will believe so when when he makes the divine promises of god or yea and amen but it's only to those that will believe what god said and it's not it's not for the world but you know you know you're not going to argue and you're not going to condem convince these people of what what the truth is but the only thing is is we're going to god's going to have a witness in this last day the bride of jesus christ is going to show to the world what is written in this book why because she's going to be the book made manifest you know you know we you're not going to argue and you're not going to turn people to the truth the only thing can do that is the holy ghost but you know what we're going to proclaim this word he pro jesus done his part he walked and he was the word made flesh and he began to speak to him and he and the scripture says you know he told himself who convinced me of sin who can who can show that that i have walked from contrary to the word and many times it's it's you and i we're going to get into this but you know if he said that you and i are born of his bone and flesh of his flesh and life of his life then we should be able to make that same claim but whose witness will we will we believe who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed as isaiah said who who's going to believe what god has said this is from the message at thy word lord he says he said you don't know how you'll get up out of that chair get away from there tonight see you don't know how you're going to do this or how these other diseases are going to be healed he said but at the word lord i'm going to let down the net at thy word lord i'm going to raise up from here i don't know how i'm going to do it but at thy word lord that's it take god at his word and god's spoken word must will materialize and produce just exactly what it says it will listen the right mental attitude toward any divine promise of god will bring it to pass i don't care what it is he said if you plant it if you plant corn you plant corn water corn leave corn alone it'll produce corn is that right wheat will produce wheat he said the promise of salvation will produce a christian the promise of the holy ghost will bring it to you the promise of divine healing will make you well any divine promise of god and the bible said that the word of god is a seed is that right jesus said that a sower soaked he said if you'll just take it in your heart and don't dig it up every day to see how it's getting along just sink it in your heart and settle it that's all walk right on god will take care of the rest of it he's obligated to his word do you know that everything that you see tonight is god's word materialized said do you know your body is god's word materialized do you know them beings there is god's words materialized do you know that concrete is god's word materialized do you know this whole earth as god spoke and said let there be and he believed his own word and it come into existence if it didn't where did it come from well you say it'll come off the sun well he spoke the son into existence see everything is god's own word the worlds were framed by the word of god the bible said so god just spoke it and he believed his own word and that was that's what it was he said now god has spoken his word to us just believe him and watch what happens now when he speaks something this is his word initially first and any other word that's contrary to this is not god's word it has to come from the bible so this is what god has spoken and everything that we have and he believed his own word so he began to he saw what god what he believed what he said because he knew what was going to take place he had what he had in his mind his vision of what was going to take place and the great thing about god is god's never been shocked nobody's ever taken him by surprise he knew always what was going to take place he knew that you'd be here this morning no every problem that you ever faced but you know what when every problem came your way whatever this decision whatever it was that came your way you know what he's already made a way for you he said with every temptation he said there would be a way of escape mate so whatever the problem was that you came here this morning with whatever bondage or whatever problem it is you know what god has already got the answer for it you know there's never been a problem that's come that god doesn't already know what the answer is it has the answer already for you he said but he said before you call i will answer so then when the answer is already there then all we got to do is believe it that's right but the problem is is do we believe it because one of the one of the problems that we have that we'll see here is when when there's there's a witness that is coming and and the holy spirit has come to witness the word so when the holy spirit has come to witness the word then he speaks what the word is and he speaks it to you but then the other the other witness that we have is the devil and the devil is there and he's going to begin to speak to you and who are you going to listen to because when we when we get through some of the and later on in the scripture and here we're going to see that you know you've got to that's the reason i said we're going to impeach the witnesses because we're going to look at their at the outcome of the witnesses so when brother and said when you go to court then you have to have a witness that has the truth that is an eyewitness to these things and then you've got to have a witness that's inc that's a credible witness to testify because if you've got one that's not then you're going to get up there and you're going to bring the contrary evidence to what they said and then you bring it and say well you know what you're not a credible witness well then you know what then you cancel out that witness's testimony so when we begin to look at here in the scripture when we begin to look at at the witness then you know what when the holy ghost has spoken when will you look then say well is the holy ghost true who is what the holy ghost has spoken is it true does it come to pass but then you take the things that the devil has said and then you say what is he a credible witness he's what the devil has said because you know what we allow him to sit on our shoulder and have a courtroom in our mind and he'll stand there and tell us and talk about into our mind and we'll take up time to listen to what he has to say but is he a credible witness but then when you say well then who are we going to listen to are we going to listen to god are we going to listen to the devil because that's what we do we take up time to listen to what what the devil has to tell us to live in a world of fear and somebody was talking about recently talking about you know the the problem is is living in the in the fear of the unknown but the thing is is if we get into the word and the word is in us and we've we've received the word then we've become the word by receiving the word then then with the word then it becomes known to us it becomes open to us so we're not walking in darkness but we're walking in light now we may not see all things as as paul said but you know we start to but he said we see christ so we're walking in the light as he is in the light so it's not we see everything no but we continue to walk as that man was talking to brother branham and he brother massimo said well how are you going to get home because he said he didn't agree with everything that brother branham had to say about divine healing different things and he said well how are you going to get home he said well i'm just walking in the light he said he said where's your home he said it's over the hill there he said well can you see it no i can't see it well how do you know it's there he said well you know i i've been there i've seen it he said but how do you get there he said i've got to walk this path he said well how you going to walk in the path he said i got this light and he said i'm walking because i can see the path in front of me and i keep walking and he said the further i walk the more the path that i can see and i just keep walking in that path and i keep going forward they said brother he said that's the way it is in the word of god he said we're walking in the light as he is in the light so we just continue to walk in the light that god shines in our way and we begin to keep walking in that way we don't see it all we can't see it all at this time but you know what we're just a daily journey and with god because we know where he's taking us we put our faith in him so we can just walk day by day and have confidence in him this is a read john chapter 8 verse 39 says so here's the here's the pharisees speaking to jesus he said they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus said unto them if you were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham he said but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham now you seek to kill me you do the works of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god jesus said unto them jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me he said why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word amen he said you are your father the devil in the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth you believe me not he said which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art the samaritan the house of the devil jesus answered i have not a devil but i honor my father and ye do this honor you do dishonor me and i seek not my own glory and there is not one and there is one that seeketh and judgeth verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death so when he when he begins to speak here you know we understand that the the word is the only thing that brings life and you know when he when he begins to speak to him and he and begins to tell them as we as we covered previously you know there was so many things that that the pharisees and and the religious leaders had had spoke about and you know everybody had their own different denomination brother brown talks about you know one believes this and one belief believed that and there was all these different confusions but they all said well we all believe the word we all believe the word it's all the same we believe that jehovah spoke to us and we've heard the word but everybody's got their own idea of what was going to take place but when the when the prophets began to speak then they began to unfold the scripture to to the the word began to unfold to the people then they stood there and he said y'all will go out there and you your fathers who the god had spent sent the prophets to he said they've killed every single one of them and he said he said then they go out and he said y'all are the ones that go out there and polish their tombs you garnish the tombs of the prophets and he said your fathers were the one that killed them because god spoke the word to them and you didn't believe it and he said even today it's the same it's the same thing he said because the word that the prophet spoke of is is the same word that i speak of that is me that is that i am making manifest in this time and he said you don't believe it right he said you don't believe me he said you're of your father the devil it's the same spirit because they didn't because their fathers didn't believe it he said oh we're abraham's seed well abraham rejoiced to see our day abraham rejoiced to see this day he was looking for this day but y'all weren't looking for this day why because they had their own preconceived ideas how how he was going to come how jesus would come and fulfill the scriptures but he began to point them right back to the scriptures to show that the scripture had been fulfilled but they began to miss that but nicodemus come there come to jesus that night and even nicodemus told him said look lord we will still see and understand that no man can do these things except god be with him we know who you are but when they stand in front of the crowds and all of the people they didn't want them to know because they would have to tear down all of the things that they had built all of their ideas and their and their seminaries and all the things that they had built all of that would have to be torn down because they would have to come back and realize you know what we've missed it all right but he was but he began to show the people what was what the truth was and taking them right back to the scripture to show what was spoken in the old testament was exactly what was taking place right then it's the same thing today god is god is here and he has opened the word and and we've we've had a a great ministry in our day to show us these things that were in the scripture but it was all these things that took place it was it was god that done these things in our day but you know you try to point people back to that to show them what exactly what the scripture says but they've missed it and you know we find many people that have walked into this truth and and stood up and proclaimed all these things and now now that you know everybody they spent all their time trying to tear it down but we realized you know that's what god said would take place in the last days there's a great falling away but you know what it it's it's a it's a great time because we see that they see that as well you're just following amanda you're just following error because you can't see the truth but in our day i see it because it's a great rejoicing time because god is showing us what was taking place because he told us these things would take place so when we see these things we're going to take place well then we you know it's time to rejoice and look up because our redemption draws now because we realize these are the things that are supposed to take place in our day and this is uh mark chapter 14 and it's a little bit of a lengthy reading here but uh mark 14 beginning verse 44 and he said and he that betrayed him had given them a token speaking of this speaking of jesus saying whosoever i shall kiss that kiss is he take him and lead him away safely and as soon as he had come he'd go a straight way to him and said master master and kissed him and they laid their hands on him and took him and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest who cut off his ear and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as against the thief with swords and with staves to take me he said i was daily with you in the temple teaching and you took me not but the scriptures must be fulfilled and they all forsook him and fled and there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold him and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked and they led jesus away to the high priest with him were assembled all the chief priests and elders and the scribes and peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire and the chief priest and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death and found none for many bear false witness against him but their witness agreed not together and there arose certain and bear false witness against him saying we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and within three days i will build another maid without hands but neither did their witness agree together and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answer thou nothing what is it with these which these witness against thee and he held his peace and answered nothing and the high priest asked him and said unto him art thou the christ the son of the blessed and jesus said i am and you shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven then the high priest ran his clothes and saith what need we any further witnesses ye have heard the blasphemy what thank ye and they all condemned him to be guilty of death and some began to spit on him and cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands so we see here in the in the scripture you know when that when he come to when he come to take him he was when they when they come to take him you know jesus spoke to him and you know they said listen i i've been with you all this time and spoke and they didn't realize he said you know all this thing has taken place but he said i want you to understand i understand what's taking place he said the scriptures might be fulfilled you know he never he never got into in a situation where he was flustered right or he was he was oh you know worried or feared anything he knew what was taking place so he told him said i understand what's going he said but why are you doing this he's pointing it back to them so y'all don't see this but this is the fulfillment of scripture because you know that's what that's what the scripture said the prophecy would come that i would be that he would be betrayed by one of his own and so as here it is he's speaking to these things and you know he said you come at me like this and he tells peter you know when peter takes the sword and he cuts the high priest here listen this is not the time to do these things don't worry you know look i understand what's taking place and you know peter you know he's he's always the hot-headed one you know he's a little real you know the hot you know little uh quick on the trigger as they say but you know he was a little he's like listen i understand listen this is what's going to take place and we know that even the scripture said that they would come against him and false witness and these things and and the scripture says that here they all of these witness trying to find somebody that's going to stand up but you know he said he said none of their witnesses would would agree they didn't have all of the witnesses i could talk tell about jesus and not a single one could get their story straight and even even when they went to the scripture and they took the exact same thing that jesus told them jesus told him he said you tear down this temple in three days i'll raise it up again and he said they all stood up there and told the same story and they couldn't even get that one to agree and he and not understanding that's the scripture and so you know and and i want y'all to see this morning if we understand that even even when people begun to take the scripture even when the devil comes and speaks to you if he's trying to tell you the scripture even when he tries to tell a scripture he can't tell it right when he was on the mountain with jesus and he began to talk to him about the scriptures when he began to tell him these things he didn't even get the scripture right because jesus rebuked him with the word went right back to the word because he had misplaced the word and so you know when everybody begins well i'm going to tell you what the scripture says well you know what there's no place that if you if you're true and begin to walk in the light you can you cannot turn down any part of the word but you know what anybody that comes by and wants to wants to change the word or whatever if it's not all of the word is contrary it's contrary to the spirit of god because you know what there's always going to line up every time there's always going to be one word that somebody's got to turn down if it's going to be contrary to the word of god the spirit the antichrist is not going to receive every word when when satan begun coming and spoke to eve in the garden see she had to turn down one word she had to turn down one word to fall and so if you're fortified behind the word you've got to be fortified behind every single word that's when jesus said he said man shall not live by bread alone he said by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so it's every word that we must receive every word and we receive every word then we stand fortified behind it he said even even when they begin to take the word and try to bring it and try to come contrary to show that jesus was not right was not who he said he was trying to show that he had blasphemed that he had disbelieved the word and even in the time they were trying to take the word they couldn't prove that it was right he said even he said their witness couldn't wouldn't agree together see it takes the holy ghost that's the reason he said he said it's not just the word he said but it takes the spirit he takes the holy ghost to put the word together what brother brahm said he said when he said what we need is a revelation said it's a revelation he said it's because what did he was talking about he said you know we don't need a new a new book he said we don't we don't need a new translation we don't need this he said what we need is the spirit he said it takes the spirit to put it together because many people you know he said he said you know it's not just comparing one scripture to another not one what one thing to the other but it takes the holy spirit because many people have read the scripture and have studied the scripture and spent their life dedicating their life to the study of the scripture and reading and everything and they can quote the so much of the scripture to you and all these things and be able to know all these things but the problem is is they don't know the author when you have somebody that can stand up and they know so much of the scripture but when it comes when it comes to water baptism in jesus name they have no idea what you're talking about but they've read the scripture cover to cover and it's like all of a sudden all of a sudden there's there's this covering or they don't they don't see that when they when they don't see how how that uh when a prophet is supposed to come or how women are supposed to dress or anything like that when they when it shows it in the scripture and you begin to bring these things out and show how it is and nobody has any idea what it's talking about see why because it takes it takes more than just reading the scripture it takes more than just reading and it takes more than just people being around this message and saying i believe that brother brennan was a prophet well it takes more than that because if it doesn't if it's not the holy spirit many people are standing around and you know i believe what i believe what god done in our day but it takes more than that because it's got to be an indwelling not just an anointing you know many people you know they they live in a realm where you know they get so wrapped up and it's all about um what what kind of emotions they can have in in church and all these things but you know it's not it takes more than that it takes it takes a life it takes an indwelling not just an anointing of the spirit people i'm you know i've spoken tongues and and i've and you know i've had these miracles and these different things happen but what you know the thing is but do you agree with the word do you know what the word says when the word is presented to you do you accept it or do you say well i don't i don't you know that's not that's not for me or that you know i don't believe that my church doesn't teach that the thing is is is it what what has been said do you put truth in that because that's what it takes in this hour because you know then when you begin to see these things then then are you listening to what the word says are you listening to someone else so are you listening so as as we see that in the scripture we understand how these things are supposed to take place so we understand are you going are you going to believe what what god has showed or we believe the devil and it's like well we're just going to cut a little corners here we're going to shave a little this you know we're going to get into little gray areas no because brother brown said you know he's like talking about those men riding running that wagon running on that oh no he's like well how close are you going to get to the edge well i can get this close i can't get this close this other man is like no i'm hugging the wall he said i'm scraping the side of he said i want that fella over there he said i want the man to get away as far as way off the cliff as he can not the man that tries to figure out how many how many microns he's riding on the edge of the cliff i want to be i want to be the man who gets away you know so like when you talk about well let's see how how close we can get in the world how much we can dabble on the edge or you know no we don't need any of that he said he said resist the devil and he'll flee from you he said he said to turn away from all even the appearance abstain from the even the appearance of it well you need to shun all of the stuff you know just even even if it don't even might even not even look good we need to be mindful of those things to even try to just totally shine those things brother braham says this is uh believe us thou this he says now look let's let's think of the day of our master reading of the text brings us to a spot in his life where he become very popular he was born with an illegitimate accusation against him and he came in the way of a stable could you imagine and veiled and unveiled he was immanuel god was in it was in him god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and he was a king of glory come down and tabernacled amongst men making himself subject to death that he might taste death for all the human race in spirit he could not so god created a blood cell in the womb of mary that brought forth the son christ jesus and god dwelt in that body jehovah tabernacled in the body of the son which was the son of god and here he came through a main barn door he lived a humble life no no place to lay his head and he went out of the world through capital punishment and shame and disgrace for us and now he was the inside and that was to be lifted up and i'm so thankful tonight that he did that for me and you now after all these years we have his favor and fellowship by with us by skeptics have a rose up and many bob ingersolls and so forth have tried to condemn the word and tried to say well it was this way and that way and it was days past but we as a christian holy spirit-filled people have the holy spirit as a witness of the word see the holy spirit is a witness now not only the word whatever we want to say about it that's one thing or another but we know that we have the scriptures right here we have the scriptures right for we have the holy ghost as a witness that's the witness so god looking down through the optical eye as it was and looked down through the magnifying glass and seeing the end from the beginning why he knew these skeptics would rise and try to twist the word in and out like that so he said i'll leave i'll not leave you comfortless but i'll pray the father and he'll send you another comforter which is the holy ghost and he will abide with you and he says until 1950 which is he preaches in 51 forever amen that's right forever all right and he would declare and testify of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so we have a wonderful witness of that tonight don't we see that's right he said what kind of people should we be then while we should be free and happy oh my no condemnation living above sin and disgrace not by our own but by him see not what we are but what he is i don't accept god don't accept me for what i am he accept me he accepts me for what christ has done for me it isn't my holiness my righteousness it's his he said i have nothing to offer but i have accepted he is amen so i know he's pleased with that for he said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and he raised him up from the dead and just as he raised him from the dead so shall we be raised for he for we are his bride flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and we shall be with him and this is from right this is the rising of the sun brother brown's taking speaking of the the mechanics and the dynamics they said he said that's what he proved hallelujah that's what easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was god himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of jesus christ cold stiff and dead in the grave shake into life and rise again and roll away the stone he said i am he that was dead so dead till the sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he's not only the mechanics god word but he's the dynamics to prove it he has the dynamics to prove it and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelation any others has spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken she had taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made the die the mechanics and the dynamics until the church or the people so we see that he has he was they proved that it was that that we had the mechanics but it was the dynamics that came through him and he said then the bride has the same thing she has the she has the we've had the mechanics but we have the dynamics now but see the thing is we've got to recognize that we have the dynamics the dynamics is here because it came through the word right so when the word came the holy spirit was there to quicken the word to bring it to pass but the thing is is you've got to realize that that's that is what's speaking to you it's your it's your time it is it is your inheritance it's it's for you many times he was like well you know that's for brother brandon that's for brother dale that's for somebody else no that's for you many times people want to put that on somebody else and say well you know we're just waiting on brother bob because your brother bob he's the he's the one well no brother bob's not the one he's not the only one because many people they want to put it on somebody else no it's you and i have to do it each one of us have to have our own part you see it's because it's a body ministry so it's not just one that we're just gonna wait on somebody else to do it it's not just one one of us that's gonna manifest it it takes every one of us to do our part and many people you know so if we're gonna do it as a whole as a whole group it's the whole body it's the whole bride that's going to do it that's right and if we receive that we really realize that you know it's mine yes we see we have to believe that we say well you know that's what well when the bride recognizes when now's the time to recognize who you are that's what god wants to do is he wants you to recognize who you are that you have that we've had the mechanics but we've got the dynamics too if we can just light the gasoline we've got we've got the car polished up and everything and it's ready to go but the thing is is we've got to operate it it's got to be us it's got to be it's our job what god has spoken to us see we understand what god has given us in this hour for us to do here in this is uh matthew chapter 10 and it says jesus speaking said behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves he said be ye therefore wisest serpents and harmless as doves he said but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and will scourge you in their synagogues and you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gentiles and when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death and ye shall be hated of all men for my sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved and when they persecute you in the city flee ye into another for verily i see unto you ye shall not have gone over the cities of of israel till the son of man become the disciples is not above his master nor the servant above his lord it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his lord if they have called the master of the house bills above how much more shall they call them of his household fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye unto the housetops and fear not them which shall kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both the body both soul and body inhale so we begin to speak you know when he begins to speak here you know we see what was good they're going to come against you you know as he's telling the disciples here you know listen these are things that's going to take place and if he and he spoke the way he spoke of me and then he's going to speak of you it's coming against you the same way and you know and it's the same way as it is in in the same way today not just what it was to them but it's to every believer you know every every believer has uh in every age has been the outcast has been the scourge of the earth has always had everybody turned against them but he said he said you know when you when you come into these situations when you go and you have to be brought before all these he said don't worry about what you got to say he said he's one because the words will be given to you you know many times when when things come to you and you know somebody will ask you a question or whatever happens different things you know something i just pray lord just give me what needs to be said because sometimes i amaze myself at what i say why because when when somebody asks a question sometimes you don't want to you don't even know how to answer the question you know brother i was listening to brother branham and he was talking about uh the brother that come and asked him about the serpent's seat and you know then he was standing there and he's like lord how am i going to answer this question but you know the lord gave him the answer it's right here yes right so you know when when the lord comes and you know you just trust him he said don't have to work because it's not it's not us that's going to answer the question because when those questions come up you know then he will always have his answer he will always have a witness that's going to answer these questions but i love that when he said he said when he speak to these things he said you know you don't have to you don't have to hide you don't have you don't have to back up he said when you hear these things he said preach them from the housetops you know as as people always you know they want to try to put put the the message down and put things back you know these things weren't done in a back room somewhere they weren't hit because you know they have been preached all around the world and you know brother i'm standing up there in chicago in front of 300 ministers of the chicago the greater chicago ministerial association want to question him on his doctrine and brother tommy hicks and all them were standing up there and he was and he began to speak about those things and he stood there and he told brother tommy he said brother tell me he said you preached for me to not he said you know you get up and speak and he said brother brown i couldn't do that i can't do that i can't do that he said why he said yeah you know i would do anything for you and i you know you said you'd do anything for me oh i i can't can't do that no that's my brother ram tom said listen bro tommy he said that's what he said they got a trap set for me he said they're coming after me he said we're not even going to be in the room that you think we're going to be in all of it was laid out brother brown told them exactly how things were going to take place what would take place and when they walked in there exactly where everybody was going to sit and everything how everything was going to be that night and stood there and told him he said well come here he said yo he said y'all want to question me on the baptism of the holy ghost and baptism of jesus name and all these things he said well bring your bibles and come here this message went all the way around the world brother brown said i traveled to europe he said i've traveled around the world seven times see he's not he's not left the world without a witness he's not been not been hidden somewhere or whatever but if but if the same jesus that brought him up from the that brought jesus from the dead and he said if he dwells in you if he's the same one see you didn't make brother branham anything but it made god everything and if it's the same one that was there when brother branham stood behind that pulpit and said this is the word he said bring your bibles and let's see if it stands the truth or not if it's the same if it's the same one that it's the same life that lives inside of you it's the same one then you know what if it's the same jesus christ if we're the sting that was that is the same bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life if it's all the same then you know what we can do the exact same thing we don't have to back up we don't have to stand back you know we can stand and claim our god-given rights what god has given us because it's the truth and it will stand the test of time it has stan it has stood the test of time but whatever god has given you then then you can claim it and believe it but the thing is is god has in our day has spoken and has revealed his self and revealed the word to us and that is and it was a witness to us to show us these things all the infallible proofs that we've seen because you can say is there anybody in this building that can raise your hand and say you've not seen god move in your life then we've seen god how many people can stand and say i've seen god move i've seen the supernatural in my life there's things that i know what god has done for me then you know we can stand and claim what god has done for us but you know what then the satan and as we've seen and what satan has done because everything that he has done is contrary we know what the scripture said that his end will be well because we we know how of all the things that he has done in your life and all the things that he has done we don't even have to read the scripture when we look at what he's done but if we just go back to what what the devil has done in our lives of what he's tried to do and we know what god has done for us to overcome the power of satan then you know that we can say why are we listening to him why don't we even entertain the time that the devil has to come and tell us things that are contrary to what he says one time every time you get a little little chest pain a little backache you go to something other and it's all well that's a heart attack how many times how many times how many people in here has had a kidney stone how many times you ever get a backache somebody's like oh oh guinea stone that's a kidney song i don't know kidney stone it's a backache i don't sign for that package that's right i had i had one and i told him i said i don't wish that on my worst enemy i had to have surgery to get that thing busted up i tell you what i wouldn't want to have to go through that again i know what it is to pray for somebody when they say i got a kidney stone i know how to pray for people sarah can tell you i had one i was rolling around in the bathroom floor i didn't think i was ever gonna make it i didn't know what was wrong with me i was hurt so bad i thought somebody was splitting me apart but you know we listen to satan he's going to tell us all about all these things about well you know what you're not going to get well or your children aren't going to make it or you're or you can't pay your bills or whatever's going to happen you're going to lose your job you're not going to get the job or whatever's going whatever the problem is i stole i was told brother sister dale was over at the house over their house the other night you know what's how about brother dale i always stay it's always stood with me always stayed with me you know years ago brother brother sometimes like the lord spoke to him and told him he said he said you know i've taken care of you this long all these years he said i'll take care of the rest of the way what's to say it's the same it doesn't matter you know because we're all god's children well if we're all god's children then you know what he doesn't do something for one that he won't do for the other that's right god ain't got any favorites now you know sometimes when your parents you know down in and being early parents know when you've got multiple children you know it's kind of hard sometimes to try to make everything even it don't always work out that way but you know what god don't do one for that he won't do for the other one that's right he said well because he said he said that we are heirs of god and joint heirs with christ well then whatever he god we got the same thing then we don't have to we don't have to worry about what god has done for us because if it's the same thing that god done for one he's going to do for the other one then if if he's done it for one and we've seen it take place then you know what we can claim the exact same thing but you know we give because really we don't give place to the devil we don't listen to what he has to say people get out and they try to run down this message and tear it all to pieces and then but you know what god has given the truth and you know what when it comes the time it's always come to pass that somebody's been just like they got out there talking about you know you know there wasn't the cloud was wrong and all this is all man-made all kind of stuff and then somebody comes along when brother bill comes roster and come along and proved everything he's like well you know what y'all don't want to believe the word of god well let me tell you when you look at something scientific then you tell me how it was not supernatural if you've not seen the videos i encourage you to see them now there might be sometimes when people start listening to that when brother bill gets in there they gets over in the weeds sometimes and people think well brother bill's way over my head that's all right you just keep listening to him and brother bill get to the point where you realize there's only one thing that brought that cloud into being there with brother branham out there in arizona and that was god that was a supernatural event and i don't care what anybody has to say they can try to tear it down everything that brother branham has ever said to always try to tear it down but you know what god has had a witness in this day to show what the truth is [Music] when they when they when they tried to talk about brother brown talking about the bridge and all these other events and all these things god has always had a witness to show that it was the truth and then the other thing is is people say well it's it's you know they have well it's not the truth or whatever but you know what god has raised up a group of people that stand and walking in the truth and they say well you know it's it's hard to live this life or whatever more you know what god has had a group and he's got a bride that he's showing that he's going to show the satan he said she's not going to fall like like the other eve there's going to be one that's going to stand up and they're going to walk they'll walk and they're going to take a body change and no nothing that he can do is ever going to stop that why because he's given us the proof he's given us the life and because he did it he said because i've done it you can do it you will do also the same things that i've done he said shall you do also and so we've seen these things but we've got to believe the witness so while we've seen what every time because all you all it takes i'm gonna stop here in a minute i promise you but when we we say one time all it takes is one time when you have a witness in court when they fail one time all it takes is one lie to catch them at one inconsistency one inconsistent statement one false statement and you know what you can you can disbar that witness you can remove that witness well how many times have you seen that satan come to you and tell you something that's not be right how many times has he come and tried to tell you that you're not going to you're not who you are and you're not going to get what you have need of and all these things he's come against you and you've seen the devil thwarted when you've seen the devil defeated every single time and you know what if it's only been one time that you know what the devil's defeated we already but we already know by the word of god that he's already defeated even today he can't he doesn't have any legs doesn't he have a place to stand doesn't have anything to stand on doesn't have a leg to stand on and he's already defeated but you know what we will steal in our human mind in our human existence still let take the time in our day to listen to what he has to say so what we need to do is just say listen you're dead you're gone but you know we'll people will still listen and you know when when the devil comes and and the doctor's got these things to tell you you know you've got all these issues and all these problems no i don't have any of them i'm not accepting them i don't have to i don't have to accept any of those things what did he give us he gave us the word hebrews 4. he said he's quick and power is sharper sharper than any two-edged sword anything anything that comes against us we have we have the weapon of choice to destroy that power that whatever it comes that situation whatever it is we've got the weapon of choice to destroy it we're going to have have the musicians coming and i i just want to read this one this one last quote here and this is from oneness you know brother i'm talking about the he talks about the sword in the hand you know that sword he said he said you know when you have a fight you've got two people with swords and he said he said we've got the sword which is the word of god and he said the devil don't even have a sword he said he's got a stick so he's got he's got a stick he said he don't have a sword he said how is he going to battle he don't even have a he don't even have a real weapon to fight with he said oh god this is from oneness he said oh god how how i could think when the church was on the move when moses got a little scared down up there at the sea he began to cry to the lord and the lord said why are you crying to me what are you what are you crying to me speak and go forward haven't i commissioned you to to the job speak speak what speak the word of god it's in you speak and go forward don't cry unto me go forward so when if if he give the commission to moses then you know what brothers and sisters he's given us the commission too because that's exactly what acts tells us acts 1 he said but you shall receive power that when the holy ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses so you're going to be a witness to these things and he said and lord god today i come in the name of jesus christ i'm yielding this sword of faith claiming the oneness of god in man by the holy ghost through the mercies and sacrifice of jesus christ his son he said i defy every devil that's bound anybody
