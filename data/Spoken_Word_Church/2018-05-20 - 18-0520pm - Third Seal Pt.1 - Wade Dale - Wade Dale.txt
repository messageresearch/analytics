who needs an emoji this is thumbs up hey man get a real thumbs up on that one but good to be in the house of the Lord by the way of announcements again brother Bob will be preaching for us Wednesday night so keep them in your prayers the fathers Dave amended fishing trip if you want to go aren't thinking about going brother Joe has an information packet for everything you need what to bring when it is where it is addresses and everything so he has an information packet see brother Joseph Canada if you're thinking about attending like I said there's space for about thirty of us and and there'll be some modern conveniences instead of the the woods the atmosphere still gonna be a little woodsy but it's not gonna be like it was up there you know eight miles back in the boondocks so but thank God that we can do stuff like that that we can still get together as brothers and then sisters can get together too and do things so it's really wonderful that we can do that so and we think brother Dale for allowing us a chance to do it amen so if you would if you got your Bibles let's turn now we're going to start on we'll get the chart back up here in a second we're going to start on the third seal this morning we were on number two now remember keep this in the back your mind God is perfected in threes the man God is perfected in three that's why I said this third seal is going to be maybe I hope all this is it's not something new but it will it maybe it'll help you think a little more about not just the seal in the horses in the black in the red but it still they all come together to paint a picture there's a picture that God wants us to see because we are visual people all right and God wants us to understand and look this is the only way God wants us to understand or he would have wrote it totally different so this is the way amen so we don't want to change you to say well God should have done it this no it's perfect than the way it was written the first time we've just got of what the Bible say conformed to his image problem is is we want God sometimes to conform to our image but gods that we need to conform to his image all right and there's nothing on this earth can stop us except ourself we are our own worst enemy amen hey man they meant we're own worst enemy so he's still working on me amen so revelations now we're going to revelation 6 verse 5 this will be the third seal part 1 remember now again God is perfected in threes now remember there are four parts to this that we're going to cover number 4 for the rapture amen because there's four combat beasts there was four worms that ate the tree down so there's got to be for life messengers which is the lion ox man an eagle to restore but God is perfected in threes all right ma'am so let's bow our heads before we get started dear Lord we thank you again today that we have this opportunity to stand in front of the cream of the crop no doubt nowhere could a person stand and have the greatest people in one building except for your bride and that's right here Lord today we are speaking to the ones that the Bible says to whom the end of the world has come upon but Lord we're not scared for that oh if we're if we're scared Lord take that fear away from us if we're scared that means we want to stay here more than we want to be with you Lord just take that fear away Lord that will that you will surely reach into the womb of our mind and implant the perfect seed Word of God and that it will cultivate and grow and it'll be into a stature of a perfect man which was you Lord you walked on this earth a perfect man so you gave us the example that we can walk on this earth as a perfect man Father forgive us of our sins and bless this day that we're we have here Lord set aside speak to the people Lord you be the speaker be the active participant in the service Lord be the one that does the speaking and the hearing and only one that can do the revealing father just be with us we were the ones that are traveling big with mom and dad as they're on the way back that you'll be able with them and bless them maybe give them a little time there to rest and relax then we all start all over again and to your word father just take care of us be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father we have seized things in Jesus name Amen all right remember God is perfected in three all right and we had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand now there are several different things that are different in this sea you had seal one you had seal two now the third seals a little bit longer and also the third seal has got a little added something to it there's something added to this one that's not in any of the other ones all right and what is it verse six a voice all right because remember the third beast said come and see and then John is the eye I beheld or looked and lo a black horse and him that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand so that's what John saw and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts and there right in the middle of the lion ox man an eagle there was a voice went out that happened in no other seal except this one why that's why we're here to help you understand the why say and then What did he say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of Arlie for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine you may be seated in the Lord I just blessing to the reading the word while brother Danny's getting that I want to read this to you you won't have it in some of using heavy notes you won't have it by I just came upon this and the Book of Isaiah cuz we're heading toward if we look at the third seal its perfected in threes but we'll read it on the screen here how about that got okay Isaiah 28 12 I try to every morning I've tried to at least read about ten minutes of Scripture and I try think about - you know meditate on a little bit because you know you read the Word of God it's not just like reading anything you read the Word of God it's got talking to you but well I came upon this and I thought man right here in the Book of Isaiah 28 12 to whom he says this is the rest now what we're talking about you said what's this got with a third do with the third seal we'll show it to you in just a little while because we're talking about this is the rest what is the rest to a believer it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is your rest all right to whom he saying this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the Lord wasn't to them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little in there little that they might go and fall backwards and be broken and snared and taken that's for the ones that wouldn't hear all right wherefore hear the word of the Lord hear the word of the Lord you scornful men that ruled this people which is in Jerusalem because you have said we have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement now that's the scornful man but watch what Isaiah when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us but we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves now that's not good and then but watch this therefore thus saith the Lord that is God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation of stone stone is a revelation a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation that he that believeth shall not make haste y'all gonna try to set up on the front row today good I have some subjects judgment also will I wait to the line and righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the water shall overflow to the hiding place and your covenant with death everybody this born has a covenant with death and your covenant with death shall be dis an old that's the only time that words used in the Bible now there's a word dissing o or dissing oweth but the word dissing old means atonement when you look up the word atonement it comes right back to that definition when you look up dissing old it takes you right to make an atonement so there's already been an atonement made to break this covenant with death and your agreement with hell shall not stand man I love man when I saw that oh god it's all laying in the word that's our body change that's our body change our covenant with death shall be dissin old done away with atoned for amen from the time it go forth it shall take you now he's talking about the scourge going through the land we're never have a part of that we're not going part of that I'm gonna go by what Gautreaux back down nobody that's saith the Lord God that's what I'm gonna take and if we you and I are the daughter of Zion I lay in Zion so we're the daughters of Zion we get the benefits of this and this was written under the blood of bulls and goats but you know what it's the true Word of God and man when I saw I said man there is our body chains laying right there in the Book of Isaiah my covenant with death shall be dissin old in other words done away with or it has already been atoned for you manage that alright that's enough we can go home then if you Hey if you just believe that we don't need nothing else but we got to go through and we got to we got to explain it a little bit maybe so now we come up to the third seal everybody all right say Amen first three church ages was the first seal got it the second seal typed the mental age and the lap overs of age three four and five is that okay because there is a lap over I'll read it to you next Sunday where brother bottom talks a couple of times about a lap over so we got to do not put number seven in here but now what's covered in the third seal is here this is Lutheran Wesley's age or the age of Reformation starting in the restoration and then here's your lap because this is your man age so what happened in that go back to Revelation six if you wish please is that third beast which is the man step forward and said come and see and then there went a black horse and it was the same person that was riding on the other horse amen Satan riding the horse but he had a pair of balances in his hand and then I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for penny and three measures of the barley for a penny and see thou not hurt the old one now we all know as in studying the message of the hour that brother Branham tells us that that's the seal the seal is is the measure of wheat for a penny when they started selling novenas and trying to sell your way into heaven from sister Anna Canard when the Catholic Church she knows that that it's not it's not fiction it is fiction to us but to them it's a reality I mean you pay four dollars you say twelve Hail Marys you know you kissed your for rosary beads and you're done and that's the truth in it now why the Catholic Church got so that's so mm-hmm got so rich during this time people started paying for it you know paying their way out now you got to pay your way out of purgatory but listen they fell for it they fell for it they got on that horse and they rode that horse and that horse was black so now we can skip let's go to let's go let's go down to matthew 24:6 we know that this we're talking about Redemption so this has got to be Redemption Redemption Redemption I keep saying it over and over again but the word Redemption means what to bring back so what God wants to do is bring back full fellowship he wants to bring back to where he and us can talk face to face hey man that's what he wants and that's what you should want amen I don't want a substitute I want to talk to God amen I don't want to have to do like Catholic Church and go through a priest who goes through dead Saints who goes to God somewhere in there the interpretation might get wrong and I might not get what I asked for but if I say something to the man himself then I'll get what I asked for amen so Matthew 24 verse 6 the prophet of God said this is Jesus preaching the seals they meant amen this is Jesus preaching the seals you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom I wrote in my Bible I put Satan right above here and I put God right above here because God's kingdom don't fight against God so it's Satan's Kingdom against God's kingdom there shall be famine pestilence earthquakes and diverse plate look what's happening now all these are the beginning of Sorrows you say what's all this got to do now look we got to go back now and say the oh this is this is white right red now we come to black now what happened in these ages and I'll bring some of the quotes next week this is the white righteous church so there had to be a real church on the earth right then you had to have a red horse rider which was in this age right here that there was 68 million killed bloody war a man killed actually they didn't even how much to fight with they were just killed a man all right they were just killed by what the Roman Catholic Church and you say well it's the Roman Catholic Church no it's the devil under the auspice of a Roman Catholic Church the man it could be the devil under the message if we start killing people man so it's the it's the as the attack came from the person that was on the horse all right which was Satan not God amen so then you got your red horse running through this age now we come up here to my age coming out of the Dark Ages everybody with me coming out of the Dark Ages I'm gonna keep you awake today coming out of the Dark Ages into what the man anointing we had a lion anointing bold strong fearless in that first church age that second church agent part of the third church age silver and gold have I none but what I have give I unto thee rise up and walk pretty bold all right all these different things you come down to this the age of the Ox it was a labor just to be a Christian you were killed and they labored through the longest church age which was number four that church age lasted over a thousand years some of the other ones only lasts a few hundred all right now we come out of that now when we come out of that you in your studies in in school that would they will call it the Renaissance days the Reformation is when everything starts what happens is is everything begins to be educational they were ignorant and unlearned fishermen in this age couldn't write their name but you know I was thinking the other day let me give you a little let me give you a little Porter brother Brian said that the new birth can be understood by the most illiterate person now what is an illiterate person that means somebody can't read doesn't have a formal education but how can that person have the whole to get the Holy Ghost it's not in written word right take a guy take a man or a woman take a man that has never read one thing because look Peter never read anything it's kind of obvious Peter couldn't even read the Torah he couldn't read now Paul could read he takes the Old Testament and he would tithe that's why he wrote most of the Bible but Peter just took you by faith amen but you take a man that's a literate and unlearned he's a man right but he knows one thing for sure whether he can read one word out of a book he should know that there's something wrong with him that he's lost he should know that without having to read anything cuz listen how many of us saw Jesus how many have saw him on the cross how many of us how many of us have a case that we can build no we gotta have it by faith anyway but we can't read but sometimes what we read may be wrong but the most illiterate person the Prophet said could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it's not intellect of man it's a man living in this world realizing there's dirty thoughts there's dirty things going on and you know what he only has to have one person one person to live a Christian life and if he sees that person he's condemned that's all he needs if he sees that person he's condemned he ever gets preached one sermon too he's condemned so he don't have to be able to read he's gonna believe in his heart where you should believe to start with but he's going to believe in his heart whether he has to read it or not so that's where the most illiterate person can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it's not written down oh yeah they're just written all through the Bible brother wait it's not written down how that way Dale can get saved because the way I got saved it might be a little bit different the way he got say because he had a different background okay you may receive the Holy Ghost in the altar I may receive mine somewhere else amen but this word directs us back to it okay so that's why you reason I'm saying that is when we come up to this third seal I see why it's black intelligence listen we made gunpowder it started out as firecrackers in China right then what they do they decided to shove it down in a barrel and shoot you with it Amen right intelligence of man the development you think about you see we're still we're still living in this man age because look at this age now my goodness a computer you buy a computer today and three months later it's obsolete why because of technology not because of God because of technology we wonder about all this Wi-Fi service God's always worked Wi-Fi he's always the hot spot to me I don't have to look for a hot spot he is the hot spot but you see he communicates but look so Satan is going to pervert that and what I'm getting to it Satan is going to pervert that he's going to bring come out of this they jump on this black horse and he's going to have a pair of balances in his hand now what imbalance is for weight to weigh something balance is never you remember using those old yeah some of us do some of us are going what you mean it's digital yeah no we used to have to take in either add weights or slide away to cross right okay now all we do is sit it on the thing hit the button and it says you know seventeen point three four ounces well we didn't care about the three four ounces when we were first coming up we just care didn't wait 17 ounces go that's all we had on the little thing that we pulled across the scale but you see how man is as man has progressed because remember we'll read it next Sunday the Bible says has your light become darkness that's the worst that's the worst thing is that you think you have light and it's dark man has put things together and thought this is the greatest the greatest thing that we've ever come on to and what is it done now y'all remember July the first I think it is in the state of Georgia you can't use your cell phone while you're driving down the road and you don't get grace man don't have grace you know why 1,600 people a year in the state of Georgia die die are injured because of texting and cell phone you see what I'm saying we think man that thing everybody's got a cell phone pretty close by right if you lost that sucker you'd be like you know you lose your kid lose you dog but don't lose your cell phone but honest honest but what we've come to though is depend on that so much we drive down the road and we go we hit some man kill them right so what it's technology that we tame and this is how do we do without you know we come through the era we come through the era of a pager you better remember a pager oh yeah that was the greatest thing well it wasn't cuz they could find you then right we thought pager man this is this is something yeah vibrating you bout run off the road anyway you know but then that thing now is you know I read the paper this morning listen to this email has become obsolete email has become obsolete because it's texting an instant messaging Instagram and all these they don't email anymore if we keep going if y'all keep going like you're going you're gonna put me out of business because the post office is not getting any first-class mail anymore we're only delivering packages because we don't we're not in the email business or the Instagram or anything like but let you see what I mean about technology technology is great I don't mind it I've got a cell phone myself but you better be careful with that thing if I think kills 1600 people a year what it's done is is that technology is being used but what's happening there's death there's always what man advances there's always death attached to it but now on the flip side whatever God makes there's life attached to it hey man whatever God brings to us is there's life attached to it that's why in this third Church in this third search is in the third seal we see that it is man and it's not this knowledge will not like the Bible says knowledge puffeth up you know even the Bible says come let us reason together but we shouldn't reason you see what I'm saying I was thinking about this in there just a few minutes ago when we talk about and we compartmentalize that soul the soul is either faith or doubt and then but now remember they're all connected you can't pull them apart but God can by the word through a prophet he can pull them apart and show you what their characteristics are but you can't have a soul without a spirit you can't be without a soul can't soul without a body can't everybody was better so they're all connected and then but now once they're connected you can disconnect the spirit or the soul I mean and put it in the sixth dimension and your body stays here you can do that in death but watch what God does god tapes and says all right you got memories and constant effects and imagination in the middle realm you've got faith or doubt in this realm there's no gray area but in this realm here your memory is the greatest thing you need need to remember what God said but you also your memory is what's killing us and then so they split down the middle even in the spirit realm you've got two memories you've got two reasoning sometimes we reason against the Word of God but the Bible says come let us reason together now let's talk about something our conscious our conscious is what condemns us but I'm also conscious that God's in my soul and that if I let him he'll do the work memory reason conscious affection now listen that's one thing you can't do remember brother Branham said that that your soul is it's perfect love if you're boarding you alright that's perfect love everybody wants to know watch perfect love it's the new birth you said how do you know that you got to go back and watch what brother Branham said he said when I went across that curtain of time in the sixth dimension he said all that was there was perfect love now what do they all have in common not that they were green green not that they were tall short black white orange purple three no what was the one thing I don't know where that came from Susan made me say that you looked at me and I said green but what do they all have in common in that dimension every person in that dimension had eternal life in their soul when they can't when they were on the earth they received about different Holy Ghost a guy that went into that dimension then the Burt the perfect love it's what everybody's looking for you know you these people with you know the return ministry and stuff their ball brother bonds got to come back brings perfect love no I don't think so I think we have perfect love now I think we have perfect I don't think I know we have perfect local that's what's gonna take us to that side if we have to go I said if we have to go then if we don't guess what we're gonna bring that here but memory reason conscious affection listen you don't love your wife with a godly love sorry because you love your wife with feel your love now the unfeigned love of the Brethren is the guffy love that's in the Bible that's the love of God all right but now your spirit realm remember look what brother Brown said he said it goes from it goes from what it goes from God's love to the love for your wife and you then you got love for your kids then you got then it all what comes all the way down to lust you see how the Satan is using that middle room he's bringing it to lust amen God don't have anything unless it's not included in anything God does yeah man he is the most pure love that we ever seen in our life and that's what we're working toward because we got to keep going up it statue of a perfect man the man and then reasoning conscious affection imagination boy now there is no imagination in God he's real there's no imaginary God there's no well I imagine if God's gonna know if he said he was gonna do it he's gonna do it brother right he said he's gonna do it he's gonna do it you know what he's got this is what I I love what brother said one time he said I think was brother Ernie he said he said I want to attach myself to the eternal hey man I want to attach myself to the eternal because if there's eternal life God said I could have it God said I could live for an eternity God said I could live on this earth in an eternal body I'm just gonna believe it I can attach myself to that hey man y'all must not cuz you're not too happy about it hello that's our problem we say eternal life they go people go yeah no eternal life so life your mom and daddy didn't give you it's a life that God give you hey man so our intelligence is not so bad if we use it right we have to bring a message but sometimes in our intelligence we muddle things up sometimes we get stuck on the details we do we all do but you know what we're doing we're reasoning using our own reasoning well what if and what if well what if they know what if and God like I said before he said it read Isaiah now if we would just believe that one passage the scripture I read you man to go it's appointed unto man wants to die oh we got to go we got to die because God said in the Bible this appointed unto man once to die well now how can he say it's appointed unto man once to die and he says your covenant would there shall be dissin old there's something in our reasoning that's not put that to them - together and then there's something in our reasoning that's not put this thing together well now in this seal that coming up we look at this we look at this thing called black we look at this and we go that is so bad yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death or fear no evil right black no it might be black in a certain place but there must be light go there's a shadow and then so you take the black horse Satan jumps on that black horse and he then it's not seized he's smart he come from here made itself really righteous and God itself in and like I said attached itself to that early church sure he did all right he comes in here and you know what he shows his color and he says if they don't believe me I'll just kill him if they don't believe me I'll just kill him I'll try to wipe out as many of them as I can wipe out and when he saw though when he saw that he couldn't wipe them all out that God started right back would see because here's the Roman Catholic Church and they're going along and Satan's like man I got in the man of the hour I got the Pope and I got everything going right we got all these monks and we got all these people getting money for novenas and they're paying penance and we got command this thing it's great all of a sudden Martin Luther says stop talkin drop Satan goes pretty come from because God had him hid God had him hit right in the very thing that was killing the people God had Martin Luther in the system riding Satan's Eden he had a man of God the blackest hour there ever was Roman Catholicism covered the whole ran they meant right and Satan's like going now kill them all Martin Luther goes hey we don't have to do what they say what Luther we don't have to do what they say he said no he said the just shall live by faith read it right here says it in the Old Testament even before the new was wrote the Old Testament says it's just a live effect amen and then he made that the problem that Satan had was that there was some believers that believe what Martin Luther said if it would've just been one man oh he started out as a one-man army but then this one started believing what he said this one started believing what he said this one started believing what he's saying and they started believing what Martin Luther said why because there were believers there there was the seed Word of God laying there ready to be quickened right in the Roman Catholic Church I love I love God for saving my soul but I love him that he I can do things that is impossible seemingly impossible that he can take the very church and start you know that's why we're Protestants come from I know he most you know that Pradas that means protest they were Pro Parton Luther protested the Catholic Church the 95 theses that he nailed up on the wall right so there was a Protestant Reformation began with Martin Luther in the blackest hour God takes a man they Martin Luther and as Satan is he's man he's got it I'm gonna make this place just as dark as I can make it I don't want no Christians nowhere around me Martin Luther teaching it wherever in Oxford to wherever he was over there and he looks in the Bible and he goes the Bible says the just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith so Josh shall live by faith and it strikes him what the word struck the man and what he did he turn the world upside down because people didn't begin to believe Jim's dad always blesses her Jim's dad always thought that my dad thought William Brennan was a prophet nobody else when we first met you know he he thought this William Branham man was just some man that my daddy attached yourself to and and there was nobody else we have this radical place up here in Lula Georgia that nobody this was in the 70s then nobody knew nothing about and who ever heard of this William Branham person and the Lord there was an odd thing happened Jim's dad was at the house one day and was it brother for cash first brother for cash comes to visit this guy from India believes the same thing y'all believe yeah just a few weeks later Keith Reed or somebody came into the house and Jews daddy was there and here's Keith Reed and he believes that William Brandon was a prophet he believes the same thing we all believe there's somebody Jamaica believes what y'all believe so he realized but see he thought we was so narrow-minded he really thought that that we was the daddy was the only person that believed William Brennan was a prophet that's what Satan wanted to do he wanted to take Martin Luther and say no Martin Luther you can't do that but see you can't put out the plan of God the plan of God is forever settled in heaven and it's going to be carried out on earth remember because Redemption doesn't take place in heaven redemption takes place here amen hey BAE all right so now what Martin Luther did is Martin Luther come out of that of that time of the fourth church age coming into the fifth Church aid and Satan jumps on his black horse and said okay all right I'm not gonna kill them physically now I'm gonna let them live but I'm gonna get to them intellectually and they can be alive and be the deadest people on the face of the earth the dead is Pete and that's the works dead like I said before dying it's not bad it's being alive and be dead amen but now also let's flip that over because we've got a we're gonna watch this today you got to flip that over because to be for you to be alive Christ King Live Paul said dead dead not divorced dead that old man has got to be dead so that Christ can live in your heart everybody all right now look we're gonna stop right here just for a second because I I think we kind of got the basis of this third seal it's a black horse and he's going to be riding with a pair of balances of weights of scales and we'll talk about the voice and then these are going to be the listen there's more things happen this is you know a thousand years this way and this is pretty much only five hundred years this way and there was more in this of look what happened you know your horse and buggy even in our age you know you look you some of you older ones can remember horse and buggy even just in our place that we're sitting around here we've come from we've come from yeah we've come from all that to what we up do now even in our lifetime you understand what I'm saying so in this short period of time though Satan jumped in and said I'm going to make everybody intelligent and you know what I'm going to do I'm going to divide them divide and conquer the Pope is not saying peace when he does this right he's saying divide and conquer all right that's why you don't want a you know peace brother yeah divide and conquer and that's what he did right here because remember there was no denomination anywhere around here now there was denominational ideas but there was no Methodist Baptist Presbyterian right that happened right in this time of this man anointing this black horse riding Satan said I'll just kill him while there while they're alive remember the Bible says a woman sees she's dead while she's living what is a woman his church the church is dead the church is dead they think they're alive but they're dead they took a Creed instead of the Word of God now I want to read you a couple of things right here because brother Branham he stopped go to number four on the third seal I'm just going to cover this and then we'll stop won't take too long today cuz they want to cover something next a little bit longer skip through there you go down the third seal now what we're doing is is remember we've got to make Redemption fit into all this and then it's not just a horse rider riding it's not just black and the white in the red maybe we read the quote that's the seal that's what was sealed up the man couldn't see and then when that seals broke though it does one thing it shows you the complete plan of redemption no one has ever had the complete plan of redemption at their disposal till today no one amen and now we find out that these mysteries are supposed to be revealed and why didn't these other men Wesley Luther and those great reformers who brought out justification sanctification the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and things why didn't he catch these messages why didn't they get them because they were reformers just like take it on the other side there was people come in who was had power as kings but wasn't Kings see see you have to notice the Bible terminology of anything now watch but these the reason that all these stray ends of the mysterious part about justification so it's not just justification there's a mysterious part behind it the mysterious part of sanctification and the mysterious part of the baptism the Holy Ghost you know what the mysterious part of the baptism the Holy Ghost and not just you got to wholly go because you cannot the whole goes without the seal but you can't have all these virtues working in your life truly without that and that's the same man that's down here but that what don't what brother Brown say seals it in seals you as a unit what steps out into that middle realm that memories and conscious affects an imagination and lets God brother Brown said fill me up Lord fill me up Lord well brother Brown you're full of the Holy Ghost fill me up Lord I need more there's a mysterious part Martin Luther brought justification but there's a mysterious part that we've been talking about right here that those who he's justified he's already glorified amen those who he's justified he's already glorified the mysterious part of sanctification what that you can be a sanctified vessel that God can what what we just well we just read a couple of days a couple of days ago there are a couple of Sundays ago well just today this morning - we are the blood I don't want the blood over my doorpost not anymore that worked in the Old Testament because it was a blood of substitute that when the Death Angel saw it what happened was they did what God said God said put the blood over the lentil and I'll not it didn't do it way with death cuz those people died eventually but it stopped death amen right because those people died in the wilderness physically dead they died in the wilderness so it didn't stop death now what I'm talking about is going to stop death in its tracks because when the tokens inside of you on display amen when the tokens inside of you on display there is the devil's answer putting it over your doorpost swing it on your kids throw it all over your car you're just gonna have a mess you just gonna have a mess but put that life that was in that blood inside you put it inside you you know what listen let me be real plain if you want your children you claim them but you better make sure you got the Holy Ghost first because you can't apply the token if you don't have it as brother Dale said many times the way we act in front of our kids the kids may not want it for that gets you silent and makes you squirm a little bit is it the truth have we turned them away by telling them its do's and don'ts and tell them it's this and that tell them how God lit your fire oh my god lit your fire let God do the rest they meant stray ends of justification sanctification the mysterious part of the baptism hole goes then he goes to Eve eating an apple and all these things so we see now that we've come up to justification the mysterious part of sanctification because you know what when John Wesley came to sanctification under the anointing of that age which was under the man anointing he knew that something had happened I was just reading brother Bama I can't remember the quote I was looking up but he said you got to know something happens to you that are sitting here today you got to know where you're at you got to know that something happened now if you're walking through life and the same old stuff is dragged just like we're like Bob this morning you know if you're still dragging that you're the only one that knows it that's why it's an individual fare with God you go to God and say god this thing's bothering me we all have little things that bother this things bothering me you know what he's honored for you to ask because he's not gonna take it away unless you ask remember he's a gentleman the Holy Ghost of the gentleman he's not gonna come and say stop that business yeah oh yeah he may give you a conviction but until you get ready to get rid of it because that unclean spirit goes out and you do what I kind of like that I think I'll put it back you see that to me the mysterious part of sanctification is is that God can clean your slate totally totally clean your slate it by what by the word that you hear now not a pass not what's coming what's right now God is our now God he's not a past God we can let people live off the past lord of mercy things that happened 40 years ago so what big deal there's a lot of water with another bridge and a lot of people died so when I bring up what happened 40 years ago he's a now God if you forgot forgiven of that guess what you're the only one worried about it I stay my time the other day you know what if you worry about something that you've asked God to forgive you and you truly believe you forgive you but he keeps coming back and keep coming back you're the only person in heaven and in earth that's that even those you did that that's right so who's the liar it's got a liar No Satan's the lighter Satan's one just bringing it up to you but look now let's take this right here real quick let's read the fifth quote here this isn't a third seal if you'll notice read the third seal brother Brown talks a lot about he goes back and reviews all right so that's kind of what we're doing a little bit today we're going to catch everything up and then we'll start next Sunday and bringing the meat of it but on the third seal my brother Brown is beginning to talk now that's what the reasons today the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir so he must be pretty adamant no no no no no sir you know why because he's got Pentecostals that were sitting there latter-day people they said all this is that this is the great this is brother bronson aim guy here yet don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival no we're no no the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's there's been no revival there no manifestation look now look in his life at the manifestation and he said there's no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet the whole of the that's what I want to see that's why when seeing the openings and says what look we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it so it's here it wasn't to the group he was preaching to he said that already so we must believe it's uh something is going to have to wake us up and it can be no more than the opening of the Word of God no make a can be up oh yeah I can be a feeling we can go put a tent up we have millions of people we can go on television and tell the world about all these great things and we even have signs and wonders but it said it will take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up what was the Thunder remember it was the voice of God when he reveals something to you let's don't wait on it let's become it like the guy that goes to the goes over to wherever there in the foreign country since I'm looking for the Welsh revival and the guy who looked at the guy looked to him and said you're looking at it he was a one-man revival that's what we always do we go now when Brooke Colley when he starts shouting speaking in tongues we'll have a revival and that's probably the truth knowing brother Colley since I was a little boy but that's not it if we all wait for brother Colley to do that he may be here a while but why don't you do it why don't you say God not fanaticism not junk but we're coming to the opening of these seals I believe the crystal is here you I believe the word is here I believe we got somebody that can preach it not just me everybody is bringing everything up the brother last night I heard doing a real good job over at the fellowship meeting I think people get on the bad way where it's not just hair and dress and closing all that it's it's the meat of the word it's something you can choose something you can eat because remember if he said he would send it and he promised he would send it he's gonna have somebody here to receive it because look God doesn't just spread something out like I said before here's Martin look I mean here's John yeah Martin Luther sitting there just teaching the Catholic doctrine away and just teaching in the schools and and doing the things and I'm sure he's doing his Hail Marys and he was he was Catholic he was doing he was kissing the Pope no toll or whatever he done right but one day one day God spoke to his heart and said read that one more time he may read it a million times he said read that one more time and when he read it something sparked in his heart and he said that just shall live by faith and that's what you and I are gonna do we're gonna take these things and say look that rip that what it's me not the wife that rode the horse that white righteous church is still here and then I'm still washed by the blood and if I'm not dead the problem with me is as I live Paul said it's not all that liveth but Christ that liveth in me now listen he I want to work this right he did not see the opening of the seal he did not could the one for him yet he wrote this is what's the paradox yet he wrote 80% of the New Testament where we get the meaning of the seals out of same way with John John was getting ready to rise to thunders I got a quote I'll read it next Sunday we're brother Brown I was trying to find it I finally found it on the third seal where he said John saw the thunders and was getting ready to ride him down so it's not something so mysterious that John couldn't see the plan and get ready to write it down so it wasn't a man or seven man our seven voice is like we've heard before and all other stuff no it's the plan of redemption the mysterious part comes up and we only look see we just look at things oh well God save my soul that's fine God save your soul but you know what there's a part we have to play in this endtime that's why I said this third seal is very important because remember to me if we typed if we type the this ages justification and this part of the seal of sanctification then the third seal which is what God works in threes and he's perfected in threes then this church then this seal to me shows the baptism of the Holy Ghost you go look read the third seal and see how many times because there's only this one time what does it say see if I can fund it see thou hurt not the oil and the wine now there's a voice it's not the man anointing it's not the man it's a voice brother Branham said it was the lamb he has put a stamp on this seal that's why it's important it's only time that the voice and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine now what is oil in the Bible Holy Ghost amen oil always talked the Holy Ghost in the Bible amen and the wines of stimulation of Revelation you can only get revelation if you got the holy go amen so what is it sealed to me this is the Holy Ghost seal this is the justification seal sanctification seal the third seal is the Holy Ghost seal and you'll read it several several times it was so important that the lamb spoke yourself now where does redemption come from the lamb the lamb is the redeemer revelations 5 he ties everything together he brings it right out and he says hurt knock the old and wine in the darkest time that the Catholic Church was getting stronger and stronger God said hold on a minute I'm gonna fill Martin Luther with the Holy Ghost and I'm gonna send him out then I'm gonna fill John Wesley with the Holy Ghost in the morning send him out not saying these didn't have the Holy Ghost what I'm saying is is this is this was the faith of the fathers and it was heading down in this direction if I see what I'm saying it was heading down this way now this is going back to a Reformation but it's also a beginning of restoration to restore the full word back to where now we have it it's in book form we have the whole we can hear it on tape listen brother Eddie knows one thing for sure when we first got the the computer that thing was this big just for the message you know it was like this and daddy would say you put in faith or you put in the just shall live by faith and you can go cut the grass and come back and it's still turning now it's on your phone in your pocket I've got the table on my wellit's in there I've got the whole table if I need to look up a quote on my phone don't do it while you're driving there's a time for all things you know what the Bible but you can look up a quote so what now we've but now look let's take that before we finish right here I want to read one more thing let's take that though and we've become then a bunch of quoters quotes will kill you what will kill you but I've always told you and I'm going to tell you one more time the essence of this message is what we need the essence of the message is what we need not the not the exact quotes because you you know like I said you bring me a quote and I'm bringing one that sounds different I said I said sounds different but it's not God is not confused you and I are confused all right let's read this one thing because remember we're talking about these two Church ages and then we'll start back over next Sunday we're talking about this church age which is what you got the Sardis Ian Sardis and in Philadelphia that's what income passes if we're if we're paralleling it with the seals and we're paralleling the seals with the church ages the to church ages are right here and that's the Sardis and have you ever read let's turn to Revelations 3 verse 1 and let's read what God told them to do now we're coming with you all in the wine we're talking back the Holy Ghost all right we'll talk about the Holy Ghost in you and into the Angel of the Church of Sardis write these things says he that hath - what 7 spirits of God and the Seven Stars no or the sevens there's not 7 spirits of God brother Bromstad it's the Spirit of God in those seven churches messages right is that Alright saying ma'am I know that word that thou has a name that thou liveth and our dead dead sound familiar black a name that you're living by dead because remember when Martin Luther come out of the Catholic Church he still baptized in the name of Father Son Holy go he still believed in the Trinity but that wasn't time for that to be took away from but remember thou has the name that I'll live us than our dead be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die they will go back to black again for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou has received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments Luther and they shall walk with me and what which is why does the what righteousness of the saints if you put the scripture right right which is the Holy Ghost is all right for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment type of the Holy Ghost and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says into the churches now let's go to the Philadelphia heats because it is still the age of of the to me the third seal and the man anointing until the angel the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth in other words God is going to reveal what he wants to reveal starting with that anointing of that age I know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door you know brother ram top set is the missionary age ok well I'll you won't that's ok but we need to be missionary there's some things in my life that I need to get rid of hey ma'am I need to be missionary I have set before thee an open door no man can shut it God opens the door we need to realize God has opened the door for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name now cuz remember look when we come from the Philadelphia and when we head into the Laodicean Church age right in here is when in 1906 in 1912 is when what the oneness came out the oneness doctrine of you know brother Graham's not to want to come up with the oneness doctrine it was before he just tied two loose ends up and put it all together where it's supposed to be because remember when he said maybe we had to dream he said I took a limb from the Trinity I took a limb from the one that's planted it and it became a great tree right behold I will make them wait a minute that's kept my word and that's denying my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know now look God don't love The Devil's kids God's loves his kids and to know that I have loved thee because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth behold I come quickly whole-fat that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go in the more out sounds like somebody's at rest right and I will write upon him the name of my God the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem with cometh down out of heaven listen the only people are gonna see that what remember John said this is I see the city coming down and it's what looks like a bride adorned for a husband with a bride is the Holy Ghost filled amen and I will write upon him my new name he's an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches God said I will restore and he's starting right here in the darkest time when that black horse gets on it and he starts riding with his denominational ideas God is right there doing what he wants to do building a church getting it ready got to be two shoots you got to be the stock got to be the tassel to make the grain cuz you and I are not to plant with the grain we're the seed we are what was planted amen to me that's the mysterious part of the Holy Ghost is what the mysterious part of the Holy Ghost is is to know exactly how to use it you so long use it yes know exactly how to use it just listen to what brother Branham said before we close right here brother Branham goes out in Arizona and he has a vision of a sword right in his hand he said it fit me perfect typing the sword being the word and fitting him perfect amen but you know what he also said people don't people don't talk about the rest of the of the vision because he goes out of the vision and he starts making a comment brother Branham said it takes the strong arm of faith to take it to the heart of the enemy not that you just got the sword you know you set up in you wave a sword all you won't do but if you're not worthy if you don't know how to use it a real good swordsman will take that sword away from you and kill you but a strong hand of faith knowing how to use the word it's what we come to here because look in the blackness of Satan riding that black horse with a balance everything is balanced everything's got to be weighed not Wade Wade everything's got to be w AI GA CD I went to veins can wade and that's what we're doing now you're weighing now whether you want to go on with this or just yeah well this is just another sermon okay something's got a spark something's got a spark if it's not sparking I don't know I can't save you I can just tell you what God's already saying and in that that third seal that to me is that mysterious part of the Holy Ghost is how to use it when you got it to me that's just a hole we can paint the building any color you won't do it's just how to use it because you know what a baby with a gun is disastrous right brother branham said power without character power without character it's satanic but power with character is to know how to use the sword let's stab it's to know how to use that sword there's no high any situation we listen we hear all these testimonies of how God's done things for people that's a god thing that's something God's done for his children and I don't want to say this in light but God's not taking care of the Devils kids they've made their choice yeah they've made their choice so in making their choice they don't get the promises of God but you being a child of God you get the promises of God so if you got the Holy Ghost learn how to use those promises and that's what we do I believe every Sunday I learn how to use what I've already got I'll learn how to use what I've already got and then that's what you can read you're not gonna do we come up to this third seal we got to know how to use what God's already give us so there's no new message there's not a different Holy Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost in every church age but it's the amount of word that they had to use you and I don't have an excuse because our books open any promise that God has in there you need to take a hold of it you need to be able to use it you saw I'm not a minister I'm not of this that's just a title that's just a title the only gift difference in me and you is is I got a little bit of a gift maybe to put something together so that God can speak to you but it's not me talking to you it's God God's gonna have to give you something because you know we've listened to a dissertation and many things that were not true that were false but now how many times though have you said in a in a place and you heard something wrong and some little something that right boy if that's never happened to you you need to let it happen to you one time because they don't puff you up it makes you so humble to know that God has said hey I'm protecting you don't go that way don't do that hey hey you're a son of mine don't do that amen see none of that then then what do we do we go soaked over in the corner oh my goodness no you say thank you God thank you God thank you that I didn't have to do that thank you for hitting me off at the pass that's how you then you know what take that and the next time Satan brings it you go already got a awards for that I've got a t-shirt don't want that no more all right so that's what we got to do when we talk about these seals it is a mysterious part cuz you know what the world can't understand how that there's something except just believe in God sure this all starts that way but you got to you got to see that that God has listened he decided to come down in human flesh he decided then to come back into baptism the Holy Ghost into your flesh and made all the provisions that you need you know what our problem is though we say no that's enough I don't want any more of that all right that would require me to study amen our problem is our problem amen sing us a song brother these young guys and young sisters are doing a wonderful job give my hand we like to let them participate because you know what if we get older they're the ones going to take over so Lord bless you read that third seal though read it before next Sonny you go around here let's sing there's power in the blood page 137 page 137 in the which book in the fire book 137 in his power book let's sing it sing it to him [Music] and there's power in the blood power in the blood there's wonderful power in the blood there is power power wonder-working power in the blood of the late and there is power power wonder-working power in the precious blood of the Lamb listen to this would you be free from your passion and pride there's power in the blood power in the blood come for a cleansing to Calvary's side there's wonderful power in the blood there is power your brother man said don't ever forget what happened at Calvary now that's where it all ended up there is power power wonder-working power in the precious blood of the Lamb or would you be wider much wider than snow there's power in the blood power in the blood since things are lost in its life-giving float there's wonderful power in the blood Saotome there is power power [Music] wonder-working power in the blood all the line there is power power wonder-working power in the precious blood of the land would you do service for Jesus your king there's power in the blood power in the blood would you live daily His praises to sing there's wonderful power in the blood there is power power wonder-working file in the blood [Music] and there is power power wonder-working power in the precious blood amen let's remember one thing you must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul to go in the rapture amen bottom line that's a requirement okay and you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you have the new birth then let's use it take the sword to the heart of the enemy you got the sword brother Harris preached a long time ago how the the experience is that brother Branham had no we know he was he was a prophet and we're not but you must have a sword in the hand experience because the words got to be skillful in you it didn't matter if it was skillful and brother Branham now yes it did you understand but for me I can't I see that's the problem we go what he had it that means I got it that don't mean nothing but when I can say hey God's give me a word no sir a word gods give me a word to defeat the devil with I just read it in house like that was the word for you to have your covenant with death shall be dissin old and your agreement with hell shall not stand take that and put it on your refrigerator read it to the devil everyday cause I'll promise you he's right there with you yeah read it to him and say sorry buddy this thing's been dis annulled there's no power in you there's no power in Hell hell has no power he'll don't have even a foundation and then but we have a sure foundation and it's the Lord Jesus Christ behold our lands on a foundation of stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste I like that I like that a lot Isaiah out there you know that's a complete commentary of the Bible so there's your there's your whole thing I was there so but you know what Isaiah done I was there went to a grave I said went to a grave maybe not even knowing never brother branham said you know when when Isaiah you know brother Branham was wonderful telling stories held that Isaiah stood up one day and said a virgin shall conceive and bring forth the child under inspiration he went home out of an out of the inspiration his wife said what did you say what do you mean of urgency I don't know but that's what I said you and I are recipients of that virgin that conceived and brought forth that child and now that child that human child that's God Almighty in human flesh has now brought God Almighty and human flesh into me and you we gonna realize that one day either that or were a second person which by the seals showing us where brother Brown said here stands the lamb and there goes a wild horse rider he said if you got to one of them's got to be the devil see what we make ourselves sometimes we are guarding human flesh for the manifestation of the day that we are in amen you love the Lord let's bow our heads definitely father we thank you for today the time we've had to speak about you Lord it thrills our heart to be able to stand before the people that are gonna make this thing manifest gonna bring this thing to a close where the Bible says the end of the earth have come upon us but it's not the end for the bride this is just the beginning Lord just bring it to us Lord and just fill us so full until you feel every fiber of our being and then it'll help us Lord in the days to come that we know as the world gets darker and more black and just a pitiful place to be but Lord you put us here and you equipped us you didn't put us here and not give us anything Lord what would even a
