[0:46] bless you you can take your
[0:50] seats so uh we'll keep studying on
[0:54] through the Book of Job this morning I
[0:56] want to just uh we'll we'll call this um
[1:00] job's Testament of character this
[1:02] morning and we'll start at Job U chapter
[1:05] 1 verse
[1:07] one and it
[1:13] says
[1:15] um I didn't really give them my heads up
[1:18] back there so if you've got your Bible
[1:21] um turn to I'm I'm not plugging in I
[1:24] don't have any slides I'm just I'm just
[1:26] uh talking so we'll turn to Job chapter
[1:29] one and and uh and just read from the
[1:31] very
[1:33] top and it says there was a man in the
[1:36] land of O whose name was
[1:38] job and that man was perfect and
[1:42] upright now so so the the the writer
[1:46] here is kind of set in the stage of job
[1:49] how job was and how uh how how uh
[1:54] perfect his life was how well situated
[1:56] he
[1:58] was and one that Fe feared God and assu
[2:01] Evil and there were born unto him seven
[2:04] sons and three daughters his substance
[2:06] also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels
[2:10] and 500 Yol of oxen and 500 she asses
[2:14] and a very great household so that this
[2:16] man was the greatest of all the men of
[2:19] the East he was he was a blessed man he
[2:23] was doing everything right he feared God
[2:26] he had uh many sons and daughters he had
[2:29] all kinds of substance and wealth and
[2:32] his sons went and feasted in their
[2:34] houses everyone his day and sent and
[2:37] called for their three sisters to eat
[2:38] and to drink with them and it was so
[2:42] when the days of their feasting were
[2:44] gone about that job sent and sanctify
[2:46] them and Rose up early in the
[2:49] morning and offered burnt offerings
[2:52] according to the number of them all for
[2:55] job said it might be that my sons have
[2:58] sinned and curse God in their hearts
[3:02] thus did job
[3:05] continually so was we're trying kind of
[3:07] meditating on these words just think
[3:09] think about what kind of a person job
[3:11] was and we can try to align ourselves
[3:13] with after this pattern that job was the
[3:16] kind of person that he wanted to do
[3:17] everything
[3:19] right he was very concerned you can see
[3:24] his his children are going off eating
[3:25] and drinking and doing things and and
[3:27] he's but job's very concerned about
[3:31] doing things by the
[3:33] book and he took his position as the
[3:36] leader of the family
[3:38] seriously everything that his you know
[3:41] he's watching his children and his
[3:42] family doing and he's like if there is a
[3:45] eye that's not dotted or the te a tea
[3:49] That's not crossed I want to make sure
[3:51] that it is taken care of and he
[3:54] continually offered sacrifices just to
[3:57] make sure that everything was covered up
[3:59] that everything was taken care of I
[4:02] think that's the kind of person that God
[4:04] wants to look down and see if he that's
[4:07] the kind of person that God will be
[4:09] proud of when you go through a test to
[4:10] see that you're trying to do everything
[4:14] right he in other words he was the kind
[4:17] of person that understood the gravity of
[4:19] the situation that understood the
[4:22] gravity and the seriousness of sin and
[4:25] so he was concerned with maintaining a
[4:29] right standing with God now you'll find
[4:33] as we study these things out and go
[4:35] through the Book of Job you'll find out
[4:37] that being right with God mattered to
[4:40] job more than anything else you'll find
[4:44] out that that word integrity is what
[4:46] we'll look at here in a little bit
[4:47] longer is it's used continuously through
[4:50] this book of job to job being right with
[4:54] God mattered more than having a lot of
[4:57] stuff having a lot of popularity
[5:00] being right with God mattered more than
[5:03] anything else and you can see how this
[5:05] story is framed up that job he was ready
[5:09] before the trouble came now you think
[5:12] about this job there was no indicator
[5:15] that trouble was going to come
[5:16] everything was going good he had all the
[5:19] wealth and all the popularity and all
[5:20] the possessions and everything
[5:22] everything was going great he had a
[5:23] great reputation there was no indicator
[5:27] at all no prediction that trouble was
[5:30] coming but nevertheless job was making
[5:34] sure that he was ready I think that's a
[5:37] lesson that we can all take to heart is
[5:41] you know sooner or later there's going
[5:43] to be some kind of a Calamity or some
[5:46] kind of a trouble in your life and you
[5:48] don't want to wait until Trouble Comes
[5:51] to be
[5:52] ready maybe maybe trouble won't come
[5:55] until you're laying there on your
[5:56] deathbed maybe you've lived a nice life
[5:59] with maybe like these billionaires of
[6:01] the world and things living on their
[6:02] yachts and things and trouble doesn't
[6:04] really come until you're laying there on
[6:05] your deathbed and then you find out that
[6:08] you didn't make
[6:09] ready maybe trouble comes in different
[6:12] ways maybe maybe Trouble Comes when
[6:13] maybe your children uh not believing
[6:16] like you do or doing wrong or or maybe
[6:18] you got marital problems and things but
[6:20] you don't want to wait until the Trouble
[6:22] Comes to get ready and job made ready
[6:26] before the trouble came he was mind ful
[6:30] of his home his children he was aware of
[6:33] the gravity of the he was sincere about
[6:36] it and he it says he continually offered
[6:39] up sacrifices for his
[6:41] children I thought about that a lot a
[6:43] lot of times when I'm you know in the
[6:45] dead of night when you're praying for
[6:46] your family and you're you're wondering
[6:49] you know did have is there anything off
[6:51] kilter and you start laying those things
[6:54] before God you you can you can lay lay
[6:56] things with the same kind of Faith
[6:58] before God that like job did if there's
[7:00] anything wrong I want my home to be
[7:02] Sanctified I want everything to be in
[7:05] order I and you get so concerned just
[7:07] like job did if there's any kind of
[7:10] magazines or filth in my home I want it
[7:12] gone if there's anything wrong if
[7:14] there's if my children are looking this
[7:15] stuff on their computer wrong if there's
[7:18] anything wrong I want everything to be
[7:20] right and you get so concerned like job
[7:24] then then you're prepared when the
[7:26] trouble comes then you can have
[7:27] integrity in your heart to know that
[7:29] you're doing everything right or at
[7:31] least you're trying to do things right
[7:34] you're trying and so the Bible says that
[7:37] job was blameless and upright in other
[7:40] words his his his he had a solid
[7:44] spiritual Foundation that served as a
[7:47] Bedrock during all his
[7:50] trials he was blameless and
[7:53] upright and he was habitually righteous
[7:56] he consistently and repeatedly make
[7:59] sacrifices for his
[8:01] children of course we know that you know
[8:04] this is laying the the the the framework
[8:06] for the story that you can do everything
[8:08] right and still Calamity
[8:10] Falls you can do everything right and
[8:12] still bad things will happen but you
[8:14] want to be prepared when those things
[8:16] happen do like job and brother Bram said
[8:19] job thinking of his children he said now
[8:21] now per Adventure when they go out they
[8:23] might sin so he offered the only
[8:25] preparation that he knowed about was a
[8:27] burnt sacrifice the shedding of blood
[8:30] and he shed the blood of a lamb for his
[8:32] children making preparation if they did
[8:35] Sin you see it job was mindful of his
[8:38] children to make a preparation for their
[8:41] sin and mother and father if we would
[8:45] quit spending money on our children
[8:47] learning tap dancing and things like
[8:49] that and some kind of how to be an actor
[8:53] and put more time of pleading the blood
[8:55] of Jesus up over them and showing them
[8:57] love and fellowship
[9:00] we'd get along better the child would to
[9:04] teach your child oh you see what he's
[9:06] saying is he's let's let's put our Mo
[9:09] our our our all of our tensions on the
[9:11] things that really matter we can send
[9:13] our kids to to baseball camps and and
[9:16] all kinds of different thing activities
[9:18] and things and stay real busy with those
[9:20] kind of things but what about being busy
[9:22] about the things of God and preparing
[9:25] preparing for our the spiritual journey
[9:27] of life don't wait until trouble comes
[9:30] to start praying or to get your heart
[9:32] right or to clean up and get
[9:34] right don't wait until trouble strikes
[9:37] to do things
[9:39] right now you see much about this story
[9:43] of job is about doing things right doing
[9:46] things where you know that you're doing
[9:49] what the word of God says now in Job
[9:52] chapter 2 verse three it says the Lord
[9:54] said unto Satan uh he still holds fast
[9:57] his integrity
[9:59] that that the Satan saying still he
[10:01] holdeth fast his Integrity although thou
[10:03] movest well actually sorry sorry this is
[10:05] the Lord speaking to Satan still he
[10:07] holdest fast his Integrity although thou
[10:09] movest me against me against him to
[10:11] destroy him without cause he's still
[10:14] holding fast his integrity and in job
[10:18] 2:9 the question that his wife asked him
[10:21] is job are you still are you still going
[10:24] to have your
[10:25] integrity won't you just Curse God and
[10:28] die you you still have your integrity
[10:30] are you still everything's been taken
[10:33] away from you are you still going to
[10:35] live for according to the things that
[10:38] you know in your heart to be
[10:40] true and job 274 to5 Job saying all the
[10:45] while my breath is in me and this is a
[10:48] great confession all the while my breath
[10:50] is in me and the spirit of God is in my
[10:52] nostrils my lips shall not speak
[10:55] wickedness nor my tongue utter deceit
[10:59] God God forbid that I should justify you
[11:01] he's speaking to his all his friends
[11:03] that have been saying all their bad
[11:04] things to him till I die I will not
[11:08] remove my
[11:10] Integrity from me so job is somebody
[11:14] that had
[11:16] Integrity now you know Proverbs 10:9
[11:19] says whoever walks in Integrity walks
[11:22] securely but whoever takes crooked paths
[11:25] will be found
[11:26] out Psalm 25:21 says says may integrity
[11:30] and uprightness protect me because my
[11:32] hope Lord is in you you think what he
[11:36] the D the psalmus is saying there my May
[11:39] integrity and uprightness protect me to
[11:43] be able to walk in a position where you
[11:45] know you're doing what's
[11:47] right Proverbs 11:3 says the Integrity
[11:50] of the upright guides them but the
[11:52] Unfaithful are destroyed by their
[11:55] duplicity and duplicity is dishonest
[11:58] Behavior that's intended to to trick
[12:00] somebody so you can see those two
[12:02] opposing thing duplicity is is is doing
[12:05] something tricky and integrity is
[12:09] walking according to the word of God
[12:12] walking according to your personal
[12:13] revelation of what it says and James 417
[12:17] says if anyone then knows the good they
[12:19] ought to do and doesn't do it it is sin
[12:21] for them so sin comes from you're not
[12:24] walking according to what you know to do
[12:26] which is the opposite of Integrity so
[12:29] what is integrity Integrity is living
[12:33] true to the
[12:34] standard you know if you know what the
[12:36] standard is then you can stand for it
[12:40] and and that's what God is looking for
[12:42] somebody that will stand for what they
[12:44] believe in no matter what no matter if
[12:48] they have lost all their friends if
[12:50] their wife is standing there cursing at
[12:52] them and saying W you why don't you just
[12:53] abandon everything if if if you've lost
[12:55] everything but yet you know you you'll
[12:58] stand for some God wants somebody to
[13:00] stand for something in the face of
[13:02] adversity and you know if you're a real
[13:04] Christian you're going to have to you've
[13:05] got to stand for something I I I we were
[13:09] talking the other day about my my girls
[13:12] they wear a dress you know to the to
[13:14] their they the little Chick-fil-A job
[13:16] and uh when you when you start the job
[13:19] all they got in their uniform is pants
[13:21] so they had to you know kind of go jump
[13:23] through some hoops and everything we we
[13:24] got to wear a dress and they stand out
[13:27] there and people start asking question
[13:29] questions and making fun and giving
[13:31] those strange looks and it's so strange
[13:33] today in today's society that that you
[13:36] know uh people of other religions and
[13:38] things don't get made fun of and you
[13:40] know you don't make fun of uh
[13:42] homosexuals and you know you're supposed
[13:44] to they say well we put our love around
[13:46] we just want to love everybody but you
[13:47] try to take a stand for being a
[13:49] Christian and you're ostracized and
[13:51] treated strange and you see but it's
[13:54] it's taking a stand you you got to this
[13:56] is this is what Integrity is it no
[13:59] matter what if somebody makes fun of
[14:00] your long hair or the way that you dress
[14:02] or the way that you look but yet you're
[14:05] standing for what you believe in and it
[14:07] doesn't matter if you like in the in the
[14:09] days going by if you're when they used
[14:11] to take the Christians out and put them
[14:13] on a sheet of ice in the middle of
[14:14] winter and make them stand there in the
[14:16] cold until they gave up their life or or
[14:19] in a prison a dank dark prison where
[14:21] they put them on the rack and stretch
[14:22] them it doesn't matter what they do to
[14:24] you or how much they take away you're
[14:26] going to take a stand for what you
[14:29] believe in now God wants somebody that's
[14:31] going to take a stand like job did and I
[14:34] I I think that should encourage all of
[14:35] us we I know we've got the young people
[14:37] up here this morning and I'm glad to
[14:38] have you but I I want to encourage you
[14:40] this morning to take a stand that God
[14:42] wants somebody to to know what they
[14:44] believe in and that will stand for that
[14:47] no matter what right and you remember
[14:50] that if you stand for God if you stand
[14:53] for God's word that God will stand for
[14:55] you he will back you up he'll back you
[14:58] up when the the hard times come it
[15:01] didn't look like it what job was going
[15:03] through but God was backing him up and
[15:05] God was proud of him because job had
[15:08] Integrity in the midst of the adversity
[15:10] that's right you think about how proud
[15:12] God was that he could say he could say
[15:15] to the devil do whatever you want to to
[15:18] this man but he ain't going to give up
[15:20] his faith because he knows what he
[15:22] believes in and he is going to have
[15:24] integrity no matter what you know so
[15:27] what Integrity Integrity is a
[15:29] essentially it's about being true to
[15:31] yourself and your standard even when
[15:35] it's tough even when it's
[15:38] rough maybe we could ask this question
[15:40] this morning do you what do you stand
[15:42] for right do you do you have do you know
[15:46] what you stand for are you just kind of
[15:48] going through life like a vapor but are
[15:51] you standing for
[15:52] something what do you stand for this
[15:55] morning when you go home this afternoon
[15:58] and do you stand for something are you
[16:00] just going to let anything that that you
[16:03] look at on the internet go in your mind
[16:04] are you just going to let anything that
[16:06] your friends tell you go through your
[16:08] mind and you're thinking and and it
[16:09] doesn't matter it doesn't matter what
[16:12] your teachers tell you it doesn't matter
[16:13] what Tommy rot the world system puts in
[16:15] but do you stand for something do you
[16:18] stand for are you going to stand for
[16:20] something in the midst of adversity no
[16:22] matter what do you stand for something
[16:24] so here's what Integrity looks like in
[16:26] real life it's honesty it's owning up to
[16:29] your mistakes even if it means facing
[16:32] consequences even if it means losing
[16:34] everything you're going to be honest and
[16:37] I I'm one that believes in being on be
[16:39] it tell the truth if it hurts somebody's
[16:41] feeling if it hurts you tell the truth
[16:43] be honest all the time because that's
[16:45] what integrity means and you know
[16:47] Integrity is not character but it's part
[16:50] of it part of your character and that
[16:53] see that's what we want we want to have
[16:54] a character that God can look at and say
[16:56] he's acting just like I do he's acting
[16:59] just like his daddy and integrity is
[17:02] part of that Integrity is consistently
[17:06] your actions match your
[17:08] words if you preach about environmental
[17:11] issues you're going to make an effort to
[17:13] recycle and reduce waste that's a good
[17:15] eort a good example if you if you're if
[17:17] you're saying we need to do do something
[17:19] and you don't do it that that's not
[17:22] consistent and and integrity is moral
[17:25] courage when you see somebody getting
[17:27] bullied on the playground you're going
[17:28] to have the enough moral courage to
[17:30] stand up and say that ain't right or
[17:32] maybe you see somebody at church being
[17:33] bullied and you got enough moral courage
[17:35] about you to stand up and say that ain't
[17:37] right that ain't right to talk to
[17:39] somebody like that that ain't right to
[17:40] talk down to somebody like that and you
[17:42] got enough moral backbone that's
[17:44] Integrity to stand up and say well that
[17:46] ain't right amen Integrity is
[17:49] responsibility you you'll do what you'll
[17:52] say you'll do and that's where you know
[17:55] as we grow up as as young people and
[17:57] whatnot you you come to a place where
[17:58] you got a job and and maybe one day that
[18:01] you know you get married and a man's got
[18:03] to go to work and provide for his family
[18:06] that's Integrity you don't just sit on
[18:08] the couch and watch TV and and waste
[18:10] waste your hours away but you you're
[18:12] you're responsible like job was job was
[18:16] responsible for leading his family which
[18:19] is why he kept offering those sacrifices
[18:21] consistently he was responsible for it
[18:25] you know every one of us has a
[18:26] responsibility to God yeah mothers have
[18:29] a responsibility to raise up their
[18:30] children right and fathers have a
[18:32] responsibility to lead right and that's
[18:34] all part of integrity and integrity also
[18:36] is respect treating other people with
[18:40] dignity doesn't matter who they are or
[18:43] what they can do for you I like what
[18:44] brother Joel said when we were up there
[18:46] in Tennessee about how you might come
[18:48] across people sometimes that don't smell
[18:50] the way that you think that they should
[18:53] but yet you treat them the same way cuz
[18:55] we're and that's Integrity Integrity
[18:57] they might not look way that you think
[18:59] they should look they might not smell or
[19:01] or all those kind of things and despite
[19:04] all of his trials job always maned his
[19:07] maintained his
[19:09] Integrity in job 2:9 that that scripture
[19:12] we keep going back to his wife said unto
[19:14] him does thou still retain thine
[19:16] Integrity Curse God and die but he said
[19:21] thou speakest as one of the foolish
[19:23] women speak us
[19:26] what shall re now this this is this is a
[19:29] confession of a mature
[19:31] person shall we receive good at the hand
[19:34] of God and shall we not receive evil and
[19:39] all this did not job sin with his
[19:43] lips brother bram's definition of
[19:46] integrity he said the Integrity of our
[19:48] heart is to do that which is right in
[19:51] the sight of God according to his word
[19:55] you remember when Abraham told a little
[19:57] story about his his his his wife this is
[19:59] my sister and that and he took and he
[20:02] gave her away to that king and the and
[20:04] the King God spared his life he said
[20:06] because I know the Integrity of your
[20:08] heart and he he warned him because he
[20:11] knew the Integrity of that king's
[20:13] heart and the message presuming it said
[20:15] he said I'd like to walk into a
[20:18] church this is how important Integrity
[20:20] is he said I'd like to walk into a
[20:22] church I hope I get to see it before I
[20:24] die walk into a church sometime and walk
[20:26] through there and just see oh how sin
[20:29] couldn't even set in that church any
[20:31] member would have to confess it before
[20:32] they even got there the Holy Spirit
[20:35] would call it right out on the spot like
[20:37] that see just like see the women sitting
[20:39] there look like ladies see men like men
[20:44] really Men of Integrity Holy Ghost
[20:47] filled men spirit filled let just one
[20:52] sin be in the church anywhere the Holy
[20:54] Spirit call it right out he's talking
[20:57] about men that are filled with Integrity
[21:00] in the church that men that have a
[21:02] backbone that they are honest that
[21:04] they're living right and walking right
[21:06] and doing right and they're standing for
[21:08] right and they know they're doing right
[21:10] and that's the kind of a church that God
[21:12] will back up that they're doing
[21:13] everything right and the uncertain sound
[21:16] brother BR said Israel was the leading
[21:18] nation of the world in her days because
[21:20] they had re great godly men men like
[21:24] David like Solomon Men of Honor man of
[21:27] integrity men that knowed God and
[21:30] trusted God but one day there come a
[21:33] renegade Ahab a borderline believer so
[21:37] he asked the question and knoweth it
[21:39] not where is John Quincy
[21:42] Adams's where is our Abraham Lincoln's
[21:45] men of principle where is our Patrick
[21:48] Henry said Give me liberty or give me
[21:50] death where is a man that stands for
[21:53] what's right where is the man that's not
[21:57] afraid to speak out
[21:59] regardless the whole world is against
[22:01] him speak out for what's right and stand
[22:03] for it and die for it where is our
[22:05] Arnold V Von Winkle read again today
[22:08] where is Men of Integrity where is men
[22:12] with Spirit they're so wishy-washy and
[22:15] gommed up until they don't know where
[22:17] they stand now you see if you don't know
[22:20] what you stand for then you can't have
[22:23] integrity because Integrity is lining up
[22:26] your actions with what you stand for for
[22:29] so you got to stand for something now
[22:31] see there's there's there's a lesson for
[22:33] you when you when you CH young people
[22:35] when you're going to school what do you
[22:37] what do you stand for what do you
[22:38] believe when you're on that playground
[22:40] and somebody does something that you
[22:42] disagree with or whatever are are you
[22:44] just going to well oh well are you going
[22:46] to stand for something are you going to
[22:48] have a backbone God wants somebody that
[22:50] will stand for right no matter what
[22:53] right which is what Ephesians 6 says
[22:56] take unto you the whole armor of God
[22:57] that you may be be able to withstand in
[22:59] the evil day and having done everything
[23:01] everything you can do then stand stand
[23:04] for
[23:06] something let's keep reading on in the
[23:08] last few minutes in verse six it says
[23:10] now there was a day when the sons of God
[23:14] came to present themselves before the
[23:16] Lord and Satan came also among
[23:19] them and the Lord said unto
[23:22] Satan whence comest
[23:25] thou then Satan answered the Lord and
[23:27] said from go going to and fro in the
[23:29] earth and from walking up and down in it
[23:31] now now as we're reading this you know s
[23:36] all the Satan's minions can come and
[23:38] he'll anoint people and you can see the
[23:41] same characteristics and this is how you
[23:44] identify Satan's at work here look look
[23:47] s Satan's attributes you can look and
[23:49] see his attributes that Satan is a RoR
[23:52] he he's not he he don't he's not settled
[23:55] he constantly going around trying to
[23:57] trying to find a place of rest but he's
[23:59] he's going to and fro trying to find
[24:03] fault and the Lord said unto
[24:06] Satan hast thou considered my servant
[24:09] job that there is none like him in the
[24:12] earth a perfect and an upright man one
[24:15] that fearth God and asseth Evil then
[24:20] Satan answered the Lord and said do job
[24:22] fear God for not so right there we can
[24:24] see that even Satan recognized that job
[24:27] feared
[24:28] God and I if you want to know what fear
[24:31] in God is a good message to go back and
[24:33] listen to is that sermon respects that
[24:36] that brother Brandon preached that he he
[24:37] broke it down I was listening to this
[24:39] yesterday while I was mowing grass that
[24:42] you fear you fear your mama you fear the
[24:46] church but not fear like afraid but
[24:49] you're you you're in reverence you fear
[24:52] the ministers should fear the church
[24:54] because they don't want to put a
[24:56] stumbling block in front of the church
[24:58] you're you're you fear you fear your
[25:00] mama because you want to do what you
[25:02] want to not bring shame or reproach to
[25:05] the way that she raised you you you fear
[25:08] God because you're in in awe and
[25:10] reverence of of his power and and and
[25:13] and everything that all is creation and
[25:16] and and and the relationship between you
[25:18] and God and you want to do things that
[25:20] are right you want to do things right
[25:22] and that creates a a rever a fear an awe
[25:26] to the to a living God that's watching
[25:28] you and observing you you think about
[25:31] that that job didn't realize that all
[25:34] this was playing out in another
[25:36] dimension there was somebody watching
[25:38] him right Jo uh job was being watched
[25:44] and God was pointing at him and Satan's
[25:46] looking at him and Satan's examining and
[25:49] and you know think about this Satan knew
[25:52] all this stuff about job he knew that
[25:55] there was a HED he already knew when
[25:57] when s when God brought it up to Satan
[25:59] that there was a hedge around him that
[26:01] he feared God he knew all these things
[26:04] why cuz there was another dimension that
[26:07] was observing the situation right oh you
[26:10] think you think about that this morning
[26:12] there's another dimension that's
[26:14] watching you yes uh my wife and I were
[26:17] talking the other day about how when we
[26:19] were young you know sometimes you just
[26:21] get these like profound senses that
[26:23] God's watching you to see what you're
[26:25] going to do with your life and and maybe
[26:28] I can impress upon you this morning God
[26:30] wants to see he's he's watching you to
[26:32] see see what decisions you're going to
[26:34] make are you going to believe his word
[26:37] or are you going to accept the devil's
[26:39] lie look what Satan said hast thou not
[26:41] made an hedge about him and about his
[26:44] house and about all that he hath on
[26:45] every side thou has blessed the work of
[26:48] his hands and his substance has
[26:49] increased in the land but put forth
[26:52] thine hand
[26:53] now touch all that he hath and he will
[26:57] curse thee to thy my face you think
[26:59] about God sitting back no he won't no I
[27:05] I want God to be that proud of me you
[27:08] you think now many times we we'll lay it
[27:10] out God knew what was in job's heart he
[27:12] knows what's in your heart too he knows
[27:15] but you see it's got to be expressed all
[27:18] these Li all these lessons about faith
[27:20] without works is dead you can have faith
[27:22] but if it's not expressed it it it
[27:25] where's the life in it it's got to be
[27:28] expressed so you it's like you know you
[27:31] plant a seed in the ground but and and
[27:33] you you know it's an apple seed and it
[27:36] grows up a tree it you know the plant
[27:39] The Gardener knows it's an apple seed
[27:41] it's an apple tree but it's got to
[27:43] express the fruit and then when the
[27:45] fruit gets squeezed out you can grab
[27:48] that Apple off the tree and said this is
[27:50] a good apple I know this is an apple
[27:53] tree cuz I'm tasting of the fruit you
[27:55] got to you got to express and that's
[27:57] what God wants to see he wants to see
[27:59] your character he wants to see that's
[28:02] what this chart is on the back of the
[28:04] wall here your character he wants to see
[28:06] not just how much you know how much
[28:08] information you have but he wants to see
[28:11] that character expressed in your life
[28:13] and part of your character is your
[28:15] integrity that you stand for something
[28:17] that you're not you're not just floating
[28:18] around on on every wind of doctrine that
[28:20] you're standing for something that you
[28:23] have a backbone that you are a real
[28:24] believer and no matter what comes in
[28:26] life you're standing for something and
[28:28] it all comes because you fear God and
[28:30] you have a reverence and you have a
[28:32] relationship with him and your life is
[28:34] not just based on how much you know but
[28:35] a revelation of this living God that you
[28:37] serve and your character the fruits of
[28:40] your life is expressed and now other
[28:42] people can drink from your life and come
[28:45] to you like a you're a Wellspring of
[28:47] everlasting life a Wellspring of water
[28:49] and you're not a bubbling up water of
[28:51] toxicity of a garbage can of Filth and
[28:54] putrification but you're a Wellspring of
[28:56] life that others can drink from and and
[28:58] and get something from get some virtue
[29:01] from and we'll stop there as The Mists
[29:03] come forward if we truly fear God we'll
[29:07] be cognizant of our actions you see God
[29:09] wants to see God wants to see what you
[29:11] will do and what you'll stand for and
[29:15] how you will react he wants to see your
[29:18] character expressed your character has
[29:21] got to be on
[29:24] display you look at the seals it's got
[29:26] to be written on the inside and the out
[29:28] side it's written on the inside where
[29:29] you can see it but it's got to be
[29:31] written on the
[29:32] outside visible where everybody can see
[29:36] it amen God bless you
[29:38] [Applause]
