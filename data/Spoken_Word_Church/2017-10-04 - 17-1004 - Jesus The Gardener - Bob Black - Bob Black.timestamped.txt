[3:27] might be beneficial and edifying tonight
[3:29] for God we know that we're living in a
[3:31] trying time where there's clouds of
[3:33] darkness all around and it seems like
[3:35] there's confusion on every hand or God
[3:37] but Lord Jesus we just thank you tonight
[3:40] that we can stand I believe with
[3:41] understanding knowing the hour and the
[3:43] day that we live in and I pray Lord
[3:45] Jesus that you'll just come upon the
[3:47] scene for me Lord Jesus and just call my
[3:49] nerves lord help me Lord God to be able
[3:51] to yield myself to You Lord Jesus

[4:03] you can come and speak through me
[4:04] grant and I pray get ordered you'll come
[4:06] upon the scene for us tonight or God
[4:08] because what kind of a church would it

[4:17] be welcome and just quick in the word to
[4:19] us we pray God I pray Lord ER tonight
[4:22] that you make it a real church service

[4:27] in the power and the demonstrations of
[4:28] spirit
[4:29] Oh God that's your quicken it to us we
[4:31] pray we ask these things in the name of
[4:33] the Lord Jesus Christ you mean I feel
[4:38] good already so this is just a little
[4:46] something I've been meditating on the
[4:48] just a little thing that the Lord put on
[4:49] my heart and maybe this might seem you
[4:53] know I believe so many for so many years
[4:56] it's so many have made the message kind
[4:58] of more way more complicated and
[5:01] mysterious that it needs to be so later
[5:03] tonight I just want to make take a
[5:05] little real simple little message maybe
[5:07] it seems simple and and just kind of
[5:10] talk on this thing that that was kind of
[5:12] that John chapter 20 tells us about so
[5:17] let's kind of read through this kind of
[5:20] a good amount of reading and then we'll
[5:22] kind of go into into the teaching
[5:24] tonight John chapter 20 verses 1 through
[5:26] 15 and it says the first day of the week
[5:28] come with Mary Magdalene early when it
[5:30] was yet dark unto the sepulchre and
[5:32] seeth the stone taken away from the
[5:35] sepulchre this you runneth and come with
[5:38] this Simon Peter and to the other
[5:39] disciple whom Jesus loved with and saith
[5:41] unto them they have taken away the Lord
[5:43] out of the sepulchre and we know not
[5:45] where they have laid him Peter therefore
[5:49] went forth now that other disciple and
[5:52] came to the sepulchre so they ran both
[5:54] together and the other disciple did
[5:56] outrun Peter and came first to the
[5:57] sepulchre and he's stooping down and
[6:00] looking in saw the linen clothes lying
[6:02] yet went he not in then cometh Simon
[6:05] Peter following him and went into the
[6:07] sepulchre and see if the linen clothes a
[6:08] lie and the napkin that was about his
[6:12] head not lying with the linen clothes
[6:14] but wrapped together in a place by
[6:16] itself then when and also that other
[6:19] disciple which came first to the
[6:20] sepulchre and he saw and believed for as
[6:23] yet they knew not the scripture that he
[6:24] must rise again from the dead then the
[6:27] disciples went away again unto their own
[6:29] home but Mary stood without at the
[6:31] sepulchre weeping and as she wept she
[6:33] stooped down and looked looked into the
[6:35] sepulchre and seeth two angels in white
[6:37] sitting the one at the head and the
[6:39] other at the feet where the body of
[6:40] Jesus had lain
[6:42] and they say under her woman why weepest
[6:44] ow she say it unto them because they
[6:46] have taken away my Lord and I know not
[6:49] where they have laid him and when she
[6:51] had thus said she turned herself back
[6:53] and saw Jesus standing and knew not that
[6:55] it was Jesus jesus saith unto her woman
[6:58] why weepest thou whom seekest thou shes
[7:01] supposing him to be the gardener saith
[7:04] unto him sir if thou have borne him
[7:06] hence tell me where thou has laid him
[7:08] and I will take him away you may be
[7:11] seated the Lord had his blessing to the
[7:13] reading of the word now that might seem
[7:15] like a strange place to stop that
[7:17] scripture because you know you keep
[7:18] reading home down and and you keep
[7:20] following on to where Jesus turned to
[7:22] her and he said call her by name and she
[7:23] recognized his voice she didn't
[7:25] recognize the way he looked but she
[7:26] recognized that boy's but I want to stop
[7:29] on that little scripture she's supposing
[7:31] him to be the gardener saith unto him
[7:33] and and let's just kind of go back and
[7:35] look at what the set the scene of what's
[7:37] going on because we know that that what
[7:40] what was taking place here was they had
[7:42] the Jews and all the different ones that
[7:45] had advised the Pharisees and everything
[7:47] they were afraid that Jesus that they if
[7:51] the believers would come and take his
[7:53] body away and then it would they would
[7:55] have something to claim that Jesus had
[7:57] risen from the dead so they they took
[7:59] the tomb and the Romans they sealed that
[8:02] tomb with a Roman seal they put the seal
[8:04] on it so to make excuse me to make sure
[8:08] that nobody could tamper with that that
[8:11] he couldn't come out nobody could go in
[8:13] it was sealed it was closed off and it
[8:16] was a Roman seal on that thing and to
[8:20] top that all off they put guards in
[8:22] front of the tomb they put guards in
[8:24] front of it so that if anybody came
[8:25] around that nobody would there was
[8:29] nothing that they could do to get in or
[8:31] he could get out and you know that's
[8:34] kind of the theme I want to follow
[8:35] tonight that that's what the Roman the
[8:37] Roman system the Roman dogma all of that
[8:39] has kept the word of God sealed all
[8:42] through these years until the last day
[8:44] when we have the word is being made
[8:47] clear before since being made flesh it's
[8:50] being made manifest right in our midst
[8:52] so so they came to the Mary
[8:54] she got out real early in the morning
[8:57] when it was still dark and and you know
[8:59] she couldn't see it was in darkness the
[9:01] Sun had not come up yet and the first
[9:03] day of the week it says come with Mary
[9:05] Magdalene early early when it was yet
[9:07] dark under the sepulchre and seeth the
[9:09] stone taken away from the sepulchre she
[9:11] saw the stone taken away from the
[9:13] typical she saw the seals removed maybe
[9:16] that kind of kind of speaks to what's
[9:18] happening today where somebody could say
[9:20] to you the seals have been torn off the
[9:22] seals had been broken the seals have
[9:24] been removed but yet she didn't
[9:26] understand what it was and so just
[9:28] because this somebody says the seals
[9:30] have been has been removed somebody
[9:32] tells you that it's been removed it's
[9:33] got to be revealed to you personally
[9:36] it's got to be understood to you
[9:37] personally then she runneth and cometh
[9:39] to Simon Peter and to the other disciple
[9:41] which was John of course we know he's
[9:43] writing this book and so it's such
[9:45] meekness and such humility that he
[9:47] didn't want to say his own self and he's
[9:50] a sociopath of the Sepulchre so she said
[9:57] somebody somebody came and took him
[9:59] she doesn't not quite enough faith even
[10:03] to realize that God hasn't risen from
[10:05] the dead hear it he rose from the dead
[10:07] after all the things that he had spoke
[10:10] after all of the things that he had said
[10:13] yet still failing to grasp what was
[10:16] taking place they have taken the Lord
[10:19] out of the sepulchre and we know not
[10:21] where they have laid him Peter therefore
[10:23] went forth and that other disciple and
[10:25] came to the Sepulcher so they ran both
[10:27] together and the other disciple John is
[10:29] a little bit faster runner he here
[10:31] outran Peter and came first to the
[10:33] sepulchre and he they stooping down he
[10:34] looked in and he saw the linen clothes
[10:36] lying yet went he not in so there's the
[10:39] evidence the linen clothes laying there
[10:42] all laid out and exactly the type of
[10:45] what God was gonna do he put the linen
[10:47] clothes a body over here and he put the
[10:49] head over here showing that there was
[10:51] something else yet to come some work
[10:53] that God was going to perform him then
[10:56] cometh Simon Peter following him and
[10:57] went into the sepulchre and see if the
[10:59] linen clothes lie on the napkin that was
[11:01] about his head not lying with the linen
[11:03] clothes but wrapped
[11:04] together and a place by itself you see
[11:08] how perfect scripture here is it's so
[11:10] perfect that that these things that have
[11:12] been hidden for years now we can look at
[11:14] and see plainly a mystery that was
[11:16] hidden for thousands of years why would
[11:18] the scripture bother to say that the
[11:20] napkin was placed over to the side and
[11:22] that the linen clothes was right
[11:25] together at position just that way
[11:27] because when Jesus rose from the dead he
[11:29] knew exactly what was going to take
[11:31] place he knew exactly the the the order
[11:34] and the things that the scriptures will
[11:36] be fulfilled in and so he put it right
[11:38] there
[11:38] so that you could look back later on in
[11:40] Scripture and see that he put it the
[11:43] body and then the head coming then went
[11:47] in also that other disciple which came
[11:49] first to the sepulchre and he saw and
[11:51] believed for as yet they knew not the
[11:54] scripture that he must rise again from
[11:56] the dead then the disciples went away
[11:59] again unto their own home
[12:01] could you imagine after all this things
[12:04] that you've seen it he must be risen
[12:06] from the dead and then then they go home
[12:08] instead of linger and well if he's risen
[12:11] from the dead he's got to be around here
[12:13] somewhere he's got to be let's let's
[12:17] linger for a little bit and wait and see
[12:20] where he is but they went home but Mary
[12:23] stood without at the sepulchre weeping
[12:25] and as she wept she stooped down and
[12:28] looked into the sepulchre and you know
[12:30] so many times in Scripture is a woman
[12:32] that's doing the act as Ruth and Boaz
[12:36] and Rebecca and all the ones down
[12:40] through Scripture that that are speaking
[12:42] and doing things and responding to the
[12:45] scripture and you would think well it's
[12:48] got to be a man it's got to be a man
[12:49] doing it but a woman that types the
[12:52] bride that types she's there waiting and
[12:55] watching and all down through skips you
[12:57] can follow these types of of how look at
[13:00] Eliezer he came with the water but he
[13:02] said Lord let her speak I'll say give me
[13:05] the water water water give me some water
[13:08] and let her if she's the right one then
[13:11] let her say I will give you water and
[13:15] you
[13:16] camels also and she spoke back there's
[13:19] something for the bride to do too you
[13:20] see
[13:21] the bride has to speak back it's got to
[13:23] be a call and a response that's even the
[13:26] way in computers you know the old old
[13:28] dial-up little phone it what did you did
[13:30] you and everything and then the server
[13:32] would respond and that's the way it is
[13:34] with computers that's the way it is with
[13:35] the spiritual to God calls and the bride
[13:38] has to speak back that's the same way it
[13:41] is in the natural it we don't want to
[13:44] get into carnal things but the bride has
[13:46] to speak back and all those kind of
[13:48] things that's you see and and but Mary
[13:53] stood without at the sepulchre weeping
[13:55] and she went she stooped down and looked
[13:57] into the sepulchre and seeth two angels
[13:59] in white sitting the one at the head and
[14:02] the other at the feet where the body of
[14:05] Jesus had lain one at the head and the
[14:08] other at the feet what what do you think
[14:11] that speaks of and you know we can we've
[14:15] we've come a long way many of us and and
[14:17] now we can begin to look into the
[14:18] scripture with new eyes and see all the
[14:21] different patterns that have been laid
[14:23] out I know that you know you might
[14:25] remember the last sermon I preached it
[14:27] was about looking at the pattern of
[14:29] doors and how the scripture has the
[14:31] pattern of doors all the way down
[14:33] through scriptures but now tonight I
[14:36] want to look at a different pattern that
[14:37] we'll get to in a second that you can
[14:39] see all the way down through the
[14:41] scripture and when the when you lay
[14:43] these patterns out then the scripture
[14:44] begins to come alive to you that's
[14:47] that's really I think what a teaching
[14:49] ministry has to do is to lay these
[14:51] patterns out so that you begin to say oh
[14:53] that's how it works
[14:55] oh that's how you're that's how you're
[14:57] born again oh that's how you grow and
[14:59] you begin to see these patterns laid out
[15:02] so the description becomes clear and
[15:03] that's how simple the gospel is because
[15:06] God follows these patterns over and over
[15:08] and over it's three three three seven
[15:10] seven seven over and over and over and
[15:12] there's tens and there's and 49s and and
[15:14] and this repeated over and over and over
[15:17] again because he knows that we need a
[15:18] repetition he knows that we needed to be
[15:21] repeated because we're simple and we
[15:23] need he came down from glory
[15:25] so that we could he condescended so that
[15:27] we could get it because he knows what we
[15:31] are we're just a little compared to his
[15:33] glory and majesty were just a little ass
[15:35] as compared to us and when she is and
[15:40] they say unto her woman why weepest thou
[15:42] she saith unto them because they have
[15:44] taken away my Lord and I know not where
[15:46] they have laid him and when she had thus
[15:48] said she turned herself back and saw
[15:50] Jesus standing and knew not that it was
[15:53] Jesus that's another thing I want to
[15:57] talk about tonight well how Jesus could
[15:59] be standing in your midst or let's say
[16:02] like that maybe not the person but the
[16:04] word could be standing there in your
[16:05] midst and you fail to recognize it the
[16:08] word is in our midst today the word is
[16:10] in the and the building's night I
[16:12] believe could we recognize the word and
[16:18] knew not that it was Jesus jesus said
[16:20] unto her woman why weepest thou whom
[16:23] seekest thou she supposing him to be the
[16:25] gardener saith on him sir if thou have
[16:29] borne him hence tell me where thou has
[16:32] laid him and I will take him away where
[16:35] thou has laid him in other words not
[16:38] maybe not quite convinced that he was
[16:41] actually alive but tell me where you've
[16:44] taken him because even in death you know
[16:46] like those people when when brother
[16:48] Brandon passed away that I remember them
[16:50] telling testimonies of how they would
[16:51] they wanted to be close to him they
[16:54] would get on the plane and just hoping
[16:56] believing that he was gonna rise again
[16:59] and you can you imagine back then this
[17:02] must be how they must have felt even if
[17:04] this body is dead I want to be close to
[17:07] him because I loved him that much and so
[17:10] she said she thought that he was the
[17:13] gardener unless let's take a look at
[17:16] that little thought right there she
[17:18] thought that he was the gardener and of
[17:20] course they were in a garden they were
[17:22] in a garden and and just think about how
[17:25] apt that was for him to be to rise from
[17:30] the dead in a garden there in a garden
[17:33] where all the plants were coming up a
[17:35] seed had gone into the grass
[17:37] and a plant had risen from that seed and
[17:40] come to maturity and you could see the
[17:43] fruit maybe there would be fruit trees
[17:45] in that garden you could reach up and
[17:47] grab ahold of an apple or whatever in
[17:50] that garden where the the the joseph of
[17:53] arimathea is his rich tomb had been
[17:56] prepared and if you if we want to get do
[17:59] a little history they say that he made a
[18:01] lot of money shipping ten down from
[18:03] England or somewhere so he was very rich
[18:05] and he had set up his tomb in this
[18:07] garden and and think about how apt that
[18:11] was that that this man and I want to say
[18:14] I want to my contention tonight that
[18:16] this man is Jesus the gardener I want to
[18:20] preach on Jesus the gardener thirty two
[18:22] tonight because the Bible says that in
[18:25] the very beginning the Lord planted a
[18:27] garden eastward in Eden he planted a
[18:29] garden in that garden that brother brown
[18:32] talked about he he formed a man out of
[18:35] the dust of the earth and you could even
[18:37] say that that man was planted because he
[18:40] said he had his foot he formed him and
[18:43] his foot was like stuck in the dirt and
[18:45] then he he breathed the breath of life
[18:46] and he put a soul into him and then he
[18:48] put eternal life into that man and he
[18:51] began to he planted that man and he then
[18:54] he out of his rib he pulled the wife and
[18:56] just all down screws through scriptures
[18:59] you can see the type this pattern of God
[19:02] planting and if you look at all this
[19:05] economy of what took place down through
[19:08] the scripture you find Gardens this
[19:10] garden the original garden seeds vines
[19:14] trees rain wheat tears and little foxes
[19:17] grafting a husband man laborers and you
[19:21] all in this garden economy and if we go
[19:24] all the way back to this their very
[19:26] beginning of this garden economy that
[19:28] God planted he put a garden he planted a
[19:31] garden eastward in Eden and then he put
[19:33] this man and and out of his side took
[19:36] this this woman and he he was put every
[19:39] evening they would walk with him and he
[19:41] would plant within them his word as he
[19:43] would speak and I were getting a little
[19:46] bit deeper I guess you know sometimes
[19:48] you begin to speak along things like
[19:50] show me show me a quote for every little
[19:52] thing so just hang on they began to eat
[20:00] from the tree of life a tree of lies or
[20:03] two trees in the garden to treat a tree
[20:05] of knowledge of good and evil and a tree
[20:07] of life and see there's that type again
[20:10] of trees and planting and Gardens and
[20:13] seeds and they began to eat from that
[20:16] tree of life and you can see the Satan
[20:18] began to work his scheme his scheme is
[20:21] to keep the Word of God from being made
[20:23] manifest if he can get in there and make
[20:26] a blockade then that he's accomplished
[20:29] his purpose of course we know that he
[20:32] can never eat can never accomplish his
[20:34] purpose he's he's fulfilling God's plan
[20:36] even though he doesn't realize it
[20:38] he's buffeting you and buffeting the
[20:41] world and everything just to make sure
[20:43] that God's plan and purpose comes out
[20:45] exactly the way that he had tended but
[20:47] what Satan's scheme was was if he could
[20:50] just get in there because having a
[20:52] knowledge of the principles of life you
[20:53] see the principle what is the principle
[20:55] of life so a seed and that seed is gonna
[20:58] come up and before long you got what you
[21:00] planted that seed that's the principles
[21:03] of life so the devil knew if he could
[21:05] get in there and he could if he could
[21:07] plant his own little little idea or
[21:10] something then it would mess everything
[21:12] up so that's so that's he sold that
[21:17] hybrid seed that started out from
[21:19] beginning from the beginning there was
[21:21] those two those two lines going through
[21:23] now not so much natural now we're not
[21:26] getting into that we're talking
[21:27] spiritual this morning because no
[21:30] regardless of where your natural lineage
[21:33] come from regardless of where your
[21:34] natural history comes from the power of
[21:37] the blood is able to wash away all the
[21:40] spot of this world all the spiral is
[21:42] seeing everything so I'm not so much
[21:43] concerned about looking back through the
[21:45] natural lineage everything y'all believe
[21:48] in the power of the blood of Jesus
[21:49] Christ tonight y'all remember all those
[21:51] stories that brother been taught about
[21:53] how the bleach it'll blot out any city
[21:57] seen anything do you realize how
[22:00] powerful that is tonight and so when you
[22:02] come up with doctors and
[22:04] things that say well I don't know that
[22:06] these people could be saved I don't know
[22:07] if maybe there's something within your
[22:09] flesh that would prevent you from being
[22:12] saved you see then sees that see where
[22:15] where do you put the blood of Jesus then
[22:17] then you're forming a blockade you're
[22:19] doing exactly what the devil scheme is
[22:21] you're accepting the lie of the devil to
[22:23] put a blockade in front of the Word of
[22:26] God and then then the Word of God it has
[22:29] no power because there's a blockade you
[22:32] he can only move as far as you allow it
[22:35] and in your mind and your reason and all
[22:38] that all those things all those flus get
[22:40] stopped up and in the Word of God has no
[22:42] effect because it's got to be it's got
[22:44] to have a clear pathway to operate you
[22:47] see that's the way that it works and so
[22:53] so here we see that he he just on Easter
[22:57] morning he just the Romans that room and
[23:00] Dogma just let's put it that way so it's
[23:02] real clear the Roman doggin with a Roman
[23:04] system that had put him in the ground
[23:06] they they had sealed that grave and he
[23:09] just busted through that you could have
[23:12] put a concrete wall you could apply a
[23:14] concrete bunker in front of that and it
[23:16] would have been nothing to the power of
[23:18] Christ rising up and and that's what
[23:20] made it another thing that I would like
[23:22] to get across tonight is that where when
[23:24] the Son of Man is risen then death
[23:27] cannot stand in his presence the son of
[23:30] man rose because when Jesus was on earth
[23:32] wherever he went
[23:34] death could not stand in his presence he
[23:36] raised Lazarus he raised Jairus his
[23:39] daughter all the different ones when he
[23:41] came into their presence then death had
[23:43] to flee because the Son of Man was risen
[23:47] the Son of Man was on the scene and so
[23:49] that corn of wheat that had no hybrid
[23:52] that corn of wheat that quart of wheat
[23:54] that is the first thing I want to talk
[23:56] about that had to be planted it had to
[23:58] be planted so that you could have life
[24:01] to make a way for you to have life and
[24:04] that's maybe maybe another little
[24:06] doctrine that I want to attack tonight
[24:08] you know would you get up behind the
[24:10] pulpit you're really going to war really
[24:12] really at battle and so the another
[24:16] another little doctor that I want to
[24:17] attack tonight instead you had you had
[24:19] freedom you had liberty to receive the
[24:22] new birth even before Jesus died even
[24:24] you know brother brain I've told us all
[24:26] over and over and over that when they
[24:29] when they killed a lamb in the Old
[24:31] Testament the life of that lamb could
[24:33] not come back upon the believer the life
[24:36] could not come back it died there was no
[24:38] way it was no opening for the life of
[24:41] God to come back and dwell inside of the
[24:43] believer now they could have faith for a
[24:45] time and for a season they could believe
[24:47] you know David could believe and and and
[24:49] and and all the different ones samsoon
[24:52] could believe and had faith that he if
[24:54] he took up that jawbone of that donkey
[24:56] he could slay a thousand Philistines but
[24:59] it he to go off and and well let's me
[25:01] just be honest sleep with people women
[25:03] and and and David the same thing he'd go
[25:06] do different things within faith
[25:08] believing but he he would slip back
[25:10] there was no constant there was no
[25:11] anchor down on the inside because there
[25:13] was no way the way had not been made for
[25:16] God to get down on the inside of that
[25:18] believer and live for that believer
[25:21] that's Galatians 2:20 the faith the life
[25:24] that I now live I live by the faith of
[25:25] the Son of God because when you get the
[25:27] new birth it's God living on the inside
[25:29] of you he's living for you as much as
[25:32] you will allow through your fruit
[25:34] through your free moral agency so the
[25:37] the reason that God had to send it that
[25:40] God had to come himself that quart of
[25:43] wheat with no Harvard at all I
[25:44] absolutely pure the reason that that
[25:47] corn of wheat had to be planted in the
[25:49] earth and go down into the ground and
[25:51] they come up on Easter morning was to
[25:52] make a way for you to make a to clear
[25:55] the way for you so let's look at that
[25:57] corner week just a little bit because
[26:00] you know when they failed and when he
[26:04] rose from the dead Mary failed to
[26:05] recognize who he was well on the road to
[26:08] Emmaus they failed to recognize who he
[26:10] was at all down through history men have
[26:12] failed to recognize the word when it's
[26:15] standing in their midst and they look
[26:17] back to bygone eras are they are they
[26:19] maybe he's coming someday is far away
[26:22] but they failed to recognize what God is
[26:24] doing right then and there in that hour
[26:26] and that day so I want to stress open
[26:31] your eyes to see it seems like yeah
[26:36] let's just go let's just kind of compare
[26:40] some of the ones through history that
[26:42] failed to recognize the Word of God for
[26:45] their day like like for example Cain now
[26:48] you know look at the aspects of Cain and
[26:50] what he was he was a real believer and
[26:53] fighting on the way up here my wife was
[26:55] reading to me out of the church age book
[26:57] and she read the quote where brother
[26:58] Branham was saying there was no
[26:59] difference between Cain and Abel except
[27:03] for one thing except for one thing
[27:05] except for the word except for the
[27:07] original seed there was no difference I
[27:10] think about that now they both went to
[27:13] church they're both sitting on the Pew
[27:15] so to speak there was there was no other
[27:19] difference beside then they broke if it
[27:21] wasn't a message church today and Cain
[27:23] and Abel were sitting there than what it
[27:25] would probably look like as they were
[27:27] both be rejoicing they would both be
[27:29] shouting they would both be saying their
[27:31] hallelujahs and saying that was a good
[27:33] sermon or maybe critiquing the minister
[27:36] or I you know did whatever things it
[27:38] would be going it would look like just
[27:40] any other message believer because it
[27:43] would look exactly the same but yeah one
[27:46] could not accept revelation and look
[27:49] look what came Dean now we know that
[27:52] we're talking about gardens and planting
[27:54] and seeds and everything Cain looked at
[27:56] it with a natural eyes he I'm gonna
[27:59] bring the fruit of the field do you see
[28:01] how close that is the fruit of the field
[28:04] the fruit from out there go pick up some
[28:06] stuff but Abel knew that God he had a
[28:09] revelation that God was trying to do
[28:12] something in people he had to redeem
[28:14] something and the original cause was the
[28:16] blood and so he took he went took a lamb
[28:19] the only way that he could have known to
[28:22] do that
[28:22] is bye-bye a revelation and that's
[28:25] there's a difference between believing
[28:27] and understanding either believeth in
[28:29] the earth my words and he that believeth
[28:31] in here my words in here with him that
[28:34] sent me there's a difference between
[28:36] believing and hearing you could say I
[28:40] believe but when you receive a new birth
[28:42] and God begins to open up your eyes and
[28:44] put the put the pattern together then
[28:46] you begin to understand and then
[28:48] everything begins to fall in place you
[28:51] could you could if the word were puzzle
[28:54] pieces you could throw it out on the
[28:55] floor and if you have a revelation you
[28:57] could pick it all up and know exactly
[28:59] where everything goes because you
[29:00] understand all the patterns all the
[29:03] puzzle pieces I know where everything is
[29:05] supposed to go but Cain did not have an
[29:08] understanding so he he went out and just
[29:10] by his own natural understanding picked
[29:12] up some flowers and some things like
[29:14] that which looks see how similar that is
[29:17] we're talking about seeds seek second
[29:24] Timothy 3:5 says having a form of
[29:26] godliness but denying the power thereof
[29:29] from such turn away like Balaam who
[29:32] liked religion but his doctrine was that
[29:35] we're all the same and don't matter what
[29:37] what church you go to or we're not so
[29:40] much interested in doctrine now let's
[29:42] not talk about doctrine because that we
[29:43] don't want to hurt nobody's feelings we
[29:46] don't want to step on nobody's toes but
[29:48] we're just all the same where everything
[29:50] is the same
[29:50] you know we it's God's Word that says
[29:54] we're different it's God's Word that
[29:56] says we're separated people would say is
[29:57] God's Word it says we're a special
[30:00] people that we're called out people
[30:02] we're not saying that about our own
[30:03] selves it's God's Word we're just
[30:05] quoting what God's Word what it says and
[30:07] so when Balaam said something elsea God
[30:10] never forgot that doctrine that doctrine
[30:13] of Balaam that we're just all the same
[30:15] don't worry about any differences you
[30:16] can marry one of these people with this
[30:18] all right if you yoke yourselves
[30:19] together with an unbeliever or whatever
[30:21] that's fine
[30:22] just go ahead and and don't worry so
[30:25] much about the doctrine and yet they
[30:27] felt see Cain failed to see the
[30:29] revelation that Abel had and Balaam
[30:32] failed to see the pillar of fire that
[30:35] was in Mose
[30:35] as camp he failed to recognize the word
[30:38] for their day the word for his day that
[30:41] it was enable it was down there and they
[30:43] camp with Moses that the that Ark of the
[30:46] Covenant had the tables of stone that
[30:48] was the revelation of Jesus Christ right
[30:50] down there in the camp they failed to
[30:53] see that and lie he had he had enough
[30:57] believing to know that the word was
[31:00] right but not enough to leave the world
[31:02] he wanted one foot in one foot out just
[31:04] like Judas half in and half out he
[31:06] wanted to be able to hold the money bag
[31:08] but yes say he was a believer at the
[31:10] same time and and you know the scripture
[31:12] says that the day the point where Judith
[31:15] Judas made his turning point was where
[31:17] that that little woman came and watched
[31:19] Jesus feet with the ointment and it says
[31:21] from that time he sought to betray him
[31:24] from that time when he was like how much
[31:26] money did you spend to put that on my on
[31:29] Jesus's feet if he had recognized the
[31:32] word for his day then he would have been
[31:34] glad to spend with what we know amounted
[31:37] to a whole year's worth of salary or
[31:40] what $20,000 in the days money it is
[31:43] that's how much money she spent on
[31:45] washing his feet and Judas got all upset
[31:47] about that because he didn't recognize
[31:50] the word for his day and see how how
[31:55] easy will say easy to fail to see to
[31:59] recognize the word for your day and to
[32:01] see what's happening to see what God is
[32:06] doing because you know even after Jesus
[32:12] rose and the disciples went forth
[32:14] preaching there were some that were
[32:16] still stuck they didn't quite understand
[32:19] what was taking place and they still
[32:21] they still look back at they wanted to
[32:24] follow a man and they found John the
[32:26] Baptist and they saw that he was they
[32:28] knew that he had preached even though he
[32:30] had got his head cut off and and Jesus
[32:32] had risen from the dead and they but
[32:34] they get they were still hanging on John
[32:36] the Baptist preached a message of
[32:39] repentance he mentioned he preached all
[32:41] of these things he came out just you
[32:44] know like brother Branham explained how
[32:45] it's so different from the way that they
[32:47] expected it that he came out not just
[32:50] opening up scripture so much but
[32:52] preaching on nature preaching preaching
[32:54] about serpents and things and about
[32:56] laying an axe to the root of the tree
[32:58] and just laying all those things out and
[33:00] and everybody it was so different and so
[33:04] amazing and it just caught the peoples
[33:06] of tension that so many they couldn't
[33:08] move on from that and let me clarify
[33:11] what I mean by move on because what time
[33:14] today's time it seems like so many I
[33:18] have there there they are still looking
[33:20] at the pillar fire still looking at the
[33:23] things that brother branham dear the
[33:25] stories that he did and ignoring the
[33:27] message that he brought and that's what
[33:30] I mean about not going on so they John
[33:35] John John's message if you would go back
[33:37] and read in the Bible he said there's
[33:39] one coming after me after me that I'm
[33:43] not even worthy to unloose the the
[33:45] buckle for me shoe I'm not even worried
[33:47] - do something like that but there's one
[33:50] coming after me now what came after
[33:53] brother branham not another messenger
[33:55] not it but the word that he preached
[33:58] would become lived in the people and
[34:01] would become a reality lifted from the
[34:04] pages of history and would become a
[34:06] reality and if you don't understand the
[34:09] message that's what you're felling to
[34:10] see so they so bad let's go back to John
[34:13] and the days of John that Paul went
[34:15] around and they let's look at it like a
[34:18] quill and Priscilla a man and his wife
[34:20] they met well I think it was Apollo's
[34:24] and and they began to speak to him and
[34:26] he it turns out he was he knew about
[34:29] John and he was a fire little preacher
[34:31] but yet he didn't know anything about
[34:34] Jesus you see he didn't know anything
[34:36] about the Son of Man he didn't know
[34:38] anything about the coming of the Son of
[34:40] Man but he knew that God had sent a
[34:42] forerunner he knew about the introducer
[34:45] he knew about the man that was going to
[34:47] introduce Jesus Christ but he didn't
[34:50] know anything about the coming of the
[34:52] Son of Man and then they introduced to
[34:55] him the Son of Man and they told to him
[34:58] about the scriptures and explained to
[35:00] him
[35:00] the Bible said and Apollo's hit the
[35:03] ground running and appalled even quoted
[35:05] him in conjunction with himself he said
[35:07] I have planted and Apollo's have watered
[35:10] now tell me then that nobody know
[35:13] there's no fivefold ministry that the
[35:14] church has messenger fulfilled
[35:16] everything how can you say that the
[35:18] church has messenger fulfilled
[35:20] everything that no nobody else has a
[35:22] right to preach when even back there in
[35:24] the beginning Apollo's was preaching
[35:26] right next to Paul that doesn't even
[35:29] make sense and you come up you come
[35:32] along all the way down through the seven
[35:34] churches and you got and you and you say
[35:37] that God changed his mind that he
[35:39] changed his pad and he changed his
[35:41] playing and all of sudden he's got it
[35:42] where it's just the Church agent
[35:44] messenger and nobody else can preach no
[35:47] one else can preach when it wasn't even
[35:49] same from the same for the beginning
[35:51] think about how that little that little
[35:53] Church the the Ephesian Church was
[35:55] started because who's that Paul and then
[35:58] they got to Ephesus and and they began
[36:00] to speak to a little small group of
[36:02] people that says it was only 12 men
[36:04] there there was only 12 men and they
[36:07] hadn't heard about Jesus yet they didn't
[36:09] know about the Son of Man all they would
[36:10] their their their their experience was
[36:13] based on the baptism of repentance that
[36:15] John preached and and so they knew about
[36:18] John they knew about the introducer but
[36:20] they didn't know they didn't have a
[36:21] revelation of the coming of the Son of
[36:23] Man and so he had to take it all the way
[36:27] up to today that I've already talked to
[36:29] you about but recognizing the day and
[36:32] your message recognizing what's
[36:33] happening today the messenger has come
[36:35] but let's hear the message let's feast
[36:38] on the word of life because the word has
[36:41] been planted but now it must be planted
[36:44] in you we're talking about planting and
[36:48] he said I am the resurrection and the
[36:50] life he that believeth in me though he
[36:52] were dead yet shall he live because
[36:55] where the resurrection is you it takes
[36:58] you from death to life death cannot
[37:01] stand in the presence of the word
[37:08] I got it I gotta hit this real quick too
[37:11] cuz it's gonna tie in a little bit later
[37:14] because so we're talking about this
[37:17] corner wheat and this corner of wheat
[37:20] there was nothing hybrid in and Jesus
[37:22] Christ
[37:23] there was nothing contrary to the word
[37:25] in him he was absolutely perfect he was
[37:29] God manifest in play in flesh he wasn't
[37:32] some second person or anything like that
[37:34] he wasn't some some lower form that that
[37:39] something happened on the River Jordan
[37:41] or anything like that they made that
[37:43] caused him suddenly to become part of
[37:45] God but he was born God born Jehovah
[37:48] born and Mendel crying in the cradle and
[37:51] so after his life all through his life
[37:56] Satan is examining him examining him and
[38:00] I'm bringing this out because I want to
[38:02] hit this that he's examining you too
[38:05] he's examining his church the church
[38:07] he's examining the individual and he's
[38:11] examining he's examining the we plan and
[38:14] he wants to see if there's a way that he
[38:16] can inject himself in there and stop the
[38:19] word from becoming manifested I wonder
[38:23] if I was just meditating on this I
[38:24] wonder if we realize the power of the
[38:27] revelation of Jesus Christ you know
[38:30] sometimes it seems like many kind of
[38:34] things that get in their head and it's a
[38:36] philosophy that we're coming to church
[38:38] to learn a lot but there is power power
[38:41] in the Word of God there's power to take
[38:45] you like that Lily that brother Ben
[38:46] talked about to take you from the dirt
[38:48] and the dust and the mud and the dirt
[38:51] and take you from the sin of this world
[38:53] and transform you by the renewing of
[38:56] your minds so that you're not like the
[38:58] world anymore that's the power of Jesus
[39:00] Christ that I'm talking about power not
[39:03] just some philosophy or something like
[39:06] maybe Mohammed or Buddha my teach but
[39:09] its power that when the word of God
[39:11] becomes it when
[39:13] when it's revealed to you it's not just
[39:15] learning but it's the word being made
[39:18] manifest in your members and you become
[39:21] a part of that a part of Jesus Christ
[39:24] and so the devil wants to test the devil
[39:27] wants to look and see if there's a way
[39:29] that he can get you off of the word and
[39:33] I'm just kind of review some of these
[39:35] things that the ways that the devil
[39:37] tested Jesus because in Matthew 4 3
[39:42] verses 3 to 11 he goes through the
[39:45] testing that Jesus endured after the
[39:48] River Jordan and it says and when the
[39:49] tempter came to him he said if thou be
[39:51] the Son of God command that these stones
[39:52] be made bread but he answered and said
[39:55] it is written man shall not live by
[39:57] bread alone but by every word that
[39:59] proceedeth out of the mouth of God in
[40:01] other words I'm not deviating one bit
[40:04] from the world then the devil taketh him
[40:08] up into the holy city and set him on a
[40:09] pinnacle of the temple and saith unto
[40:11] him if thou be the Son of God cast
[40:13] thyself down for it is written he shall
[40:15] give his angels charge concerning thee
[40:17] and into our hands they shall bear thee
[40:19] up lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[40:21] against the stone
[40:22] in other words let me maybe I'll let
[40:26] something miraculous happen and then
[40:29] everybody can look at you now think
[40:31] about this now
[40:32] this is how the devil will examine you
[40:36] and we know how that brother Brennan
[40:38] talked about how that the devil is
[40:40] watching you all of your life and he
[40:43] knows your weak points and you have to
[40:45] fortify yourself behind the Word of God
[40:49] and Jesus said unto Him it is written
[40:51] again thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy
[40:53] God again the devil took because he knew
[40:56] who he was what did brother Branham say
[40:59] when the bride begins to realize who she
[41:03] is she will be an invincible army again
[41:07] the devil taketh him up into an
[41:09] exceeding high mountain and showed him
[41:11] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[41:12] glory of them I said it's a throne II
[41:14] I'm all these things will I give thee as
[41:16] I will fall down and worship Me in other
[41:20] words I gave you a big place I give you
[41:22] I set you up real high now I he'll do
[41:25] that to you too
[41:26] he'll give you an offer he sure will
[41:28] then saith Jesus unto him get the hint
[41:32] Satan for it is written thou shalt
[41:34] worship the Lord thy God and him only
[41:36] shalt thou serve
[41:37] then the devil leaveth him and behold
[41:39] angels came and ministered unto him and
[41:41] so we know that that Jesus the corn of
[41:44] wheat that was planted in the earth he
[41:46] had to be planted to make a way and he
[41:48] was at before the planting was before he
[41:52] was buried in the earth he had to be
[41:53] examined by the devil he went through
[41:56] all the examining and then right there
[41:58] at the end Rome itself said Pilate said
[42:00] I I don't find any fault I find no fault
[42:03] so the devil's gonna examine he's got to
[42:05] examine the wheat plant and poked and
[42:07] prodded it because that's his job to
[42:10] poke and prod and see if he can find any
[42:12] loose parts and then the call of wheat
[42:16] was planted in the earth to make a way
[42:18] for you to be planted the Bible says all
[42:22] through the scripture it talks about you
[42:25] being planted in the Old Testament and
[42:27] then in the newest full field in the Old
[42:29] Testament it says Psalm 88 it says thou
[42:32] has brought a vine out of Egypt thou has
[42:34] cast out the heathen and planted it in
[42:37] Psalm 92 it says those that be planted
[42:39] in the house of the Lord shall flourish
[42:41] in the courts of our God they shall
[42:42] bring forth fruit and old age they shall
[42:45] be fat and flourishing those that be
[42:47] planted in the house of the Lord shall
[42:49] flourish in the horse and the courts of
[42:52] our God that planted in the house now
[42:54] you think about that planet your planet
[42:57] when you Jesus Peter told us the formula
[43:01] on the day of Pentecost when the bride
[43:03] tree was planted he told us the formula
[43:06] for the individual to be print planted
[43:08] because he said repent and be baptized
[43:10] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[43:11] you'll receive the promise it promises
[43:13] to you if you'll just hang on and
[43:15] believe and wait until you begin to
[43:17] understand and the word begins to unfold
[43:19] it to you repent because you you've got
[43:23] to be planted you've got to die you've
[43:26] got the grounds got to be tilled up it's
[43:28] gotta be all tore up and everything
[43:30] looked like David David told us in the
[43:32] scriptures he said the God is a desiring
[43:35] somebody with a pure and a contrite
[43:36] heart a contrite heart that's all
[43:39] I don't want to be a sinner anymore and
[43:42] so when you've got to make sure that
[43:47] that your planning is successful by
[43:49] making sure that your ground is all tore
[43:51] up that all the green briars and the
[43:53] stickers and the thorns and the roots of
[43:55] bitterness and all that's all tore up so
[43:57] that the Holy Spirit can come down and
[43:59] quicken the word that you've heard make
[44:01] sure that seed is planted because you
[44:04] see God has put laborers in his vineyard
[44:06] but you also have a part to play in that
[44:09] and so many times I think we put we put
[44:12] all the emphasis on the laborers that
[44:13] they're not doing right there they're
[44:15] not treating me right and all that kind
[44:16] of stuff but we have a part to play
[44:18] we've got to make sure that I don't
[44:20] we've got to care for our own vineyard
[44:22] like the in Song of Solomon that the the
[44:25] the bride the type of the bride I forget
[44:29] her name there and it's only Solomon she
[44:31] had her own little vineyard to keep to
[44:33] keep the boxes out of to keep all the
[44:36] little things from from impeding and one
[44:38] of the little foxes this Satan's wily
[44:40] schemes his dog may encroach it in to
[44:43] keep the Word of God from being made
[44:45] manifest in their life and so even in
[44:47] the individual you see the seed is
[44:49] planted it's got to be kept trimmed and
[44:51] free of bugs that little bugs that will
[44:53] eat down that and and cause the word to
[44:56] not become it eats away at the leaves
[44:58] that eats away at the bark and it keeps
[45:00] it from keeps you from growing and and
[45:03] and the little tree it begins to grow up
[45:05] and sway it in the wind and every time
[45:08] little things come along every time the
[45:11] devil buffets you those roots just dig
[45:13] in deeper and and you just keep purging
[45:16] and and the laborers come along and
[45:18] they're trim the tree that cut off
[45:20] things that aren't supposed to be there
[45:21] there's a little maybe a little sucker
[45:23] limb that's just sucking all that all
[45:25] the juicers can't get the sucking all
[45:27] the SAP can't get the fruit to come the
[45:30] way it's supposed to so they they trim
[45:32] that away and make sure that the the
[45:34] tree is coming along exactly the way it
[45:37] can show that it was so that it can bear
[45:40] fruit because that's the goal the goal
[45:43] is to bear fruit and you know what this
[45:47] is behind it behind me here that's
[45:49] that's really your individual tree
[45:51] cause you're planning and then you begin
[45:53] to grow up it grows and grows and grows
[45:56] and you put out shoots and you put out
[45:58] tassels and then then the fruit begins
[46:00] to bear out all the way up the word is
[46:04] receiving you and and you were
[46:06] predestinated to fulfill his word in
[46:08] other words to stop the work of the
[46:11] devil you when you when God's Word is
[46:14] tuefel feeling you it ceases the devil
[46:16] can't do nothing to you and you know
[46:18] brother Branham said you can get so
[46:19] close to God until the devil doesn't
[46:21] know what to do he doesn't know what to
[46:24] do with you and what's happening is
[46:26] you're growing from the earth like that
[46:29] little Lily you're growing out of the
[46:31] earth growing away from the carnal
[46:33] desires and the lust of the flesh and
[46:34] the pride of life growing from all of
[46:37] that stuff up higher and higher and
[46:38] higher just like just like when Judas
[46:41] keys escape from the earth he he came
[46:45] from down and the bowels of the earth
[46:46] from Hell and he walked around and then
[46:49] he ascended on high you're climbing
[46:50] higher and higher and higher up jacob's
[46:53] ladder until you come to what the
[46:56] revelation of who Jesus is and who you
[46:59] are which is what the fivefold ministry
[47:01] was giving forward right what is the
[47:03] fivefold ministry they're going around
[47:04] with a little little bug sprayer
[47:06] spraying that this the sprayer I hope
[47:10] that sounds alright
[47:12] sprayer keeping the bugs from eating the
[47:15] plant so that you can grow into maturity
[47:19] that's right spread those bugs because
[47:24] like on the day of Pentecost brother
[47:26] there's a quote I was going to read
[47:27] where brother I'm saying the restoration
[47:29] of the bride tree he said and then the
[47:30] prostate
[47:31] he said he talking about the day of
[47:33] Pentecost but there came from Hibbing
[47:34] the sound of a rushing mighty wind that
[47:36] filled all the house where they were
[47:38] sitting that's right coming down through
[47:40] them leaves own trees poured over the
[47:44] bark see there's that pattern again of
[47:47] these trees on the day of Pentecost like
[47:49] Ezekiel said I see tree I saw trees
[47:51] walking trees because what it is that
[47:54] you're you when that when they're holy
[47:56] goes quickens a word and you then that
[47:59] his life is resurrected in you his life
[48:02] brings you from death
[48:04] and then you begin to eat on the
[48:06] doctrine you begin to eat on the word
[48:08] and you grow bark because the bark is
[48:10] the word and it allows that life to just
[48:13] cut the bark is that doctrine and that
[48:15] allows the it's a conduit like a bark on
[48:17] a tree for the life to come through and
[48:20] you begin to put forth leaves like
[48:22] leaves of joy leaves of that that
[48:28] Pentecostal experience the real
[48:30] Pentecostal experience of joy and you
[48:33] know I bring a joy what brings joy is
[48:36] when you're taken from the dust to life
[48:39] when you're delivered when you
[48:41] experience the delivering power of Jesus
[48:44] Christ that'll give you joy not not put
[48:46] on not just dancing around like like
[48:48] Paul said bodily exercise profiteth
[48:50] little popping around no prophet a
[48:52] prophet too much but when it's something
[48:54] that's power and from the inside and and
[48:57] moving you because you know you have
[48:59] experienced the grace of Jesus Christ to
[49:01] take you from this to this then that
[49:03] gives you real joy and I you know I
[49:06] think that a lot of times it seems like
[49:11] we just let me say let me see how I can
[49:14] say this right you know the young people
[49:16] I believe that they they fail to see
[49:19] sometimes that the message is more than
[49:22] just about learning and studying
[49:23] everything it's it's about a real joy
[49:26] and it will bring joy if you get into
[49:28] the word and study the word and
[49:30] understand it it's more than just just
[49:32] arguments and debates and and like in
[49:34] the old days of bringing weapons to
[49:36] ministers meetings and stuff and getting
[49:38] all up in here everybody's face but
[49:40] there's a joy out real a real true joy
[49:43] to being a message of believer I thank
[49:46] God that you're not I believe here I've
[49:47] got that joy in my heart tonight it's
[49:49] pulsating it's pulsating still it's a
[49:51] real true joy that keeps powering on
[49:53] powering on and if you don't have that
[49:55] joy tonight then seek God until you get
[49:58] it because there's a real genuine joy to
[50:01] serving God it's not just rules and
[50:03] regulations and beating one
[50:06] go ahead and trying to get one another
[50:08] to do things that we think they should
[50:10] but there's a joy to serving God there's
[50:12] a joy to loving one another and a joy to
[50:14] brotherly kindness that only comes from
[50:17] the true revelation of Jesus Christ and
[50:20] you keep going up up up until your
[50:22] bearing forth fruit the nine fruits of
[50:24] the spirit love joy peace long-suffering
[50:26] gentleness goodness faith meekness
[50:27] temperance against such I really like
[50:31] that part I guess such there is no law
[50:33] how can you hold anything against hold
[50:37] anything against the elect and what is
[50:41] the fruit the fruit now we know an apple
[50:44] it's the structure around the seed right
[50:47] but that's not so in the we plant and
[50:49] the we plant the fruit and the seed is
[50:51] the same thing so when you bear forth
[50:54] fruit it's gets taken back to the
[50:55] original it's going running all the way
[50:57] back to the original like what brother
[51:00] Branham said he said when the new priest
[51:02] was ordained they they get it they had a
[51:04] right to go back in there and scoop out
[51:06] a big old handful of that matter of the
[51:07] original manner that the original the
[51:11] original doctrine the original word
[51:13] that's what we want to run it back to
[51:15] the original thing and that's what
[51:17] that's what God has been restoring back
[51:21] all down through the seven churches the
[51:23] restoration of the word restoring back
[51:26] that broad tree that was planted on the
[51:28] day of Pentecost and that's the third
[51:30] thing and I want to talk about tonight
[51:31] and you can probably guess I'm gonna
[51:33] wind up in a little bit because I'm
[51:35] running out of trees we talked about we
[51:38] talked about the corn of wheat that was
[51:39] planted in the ground we talked about
[51:41] the individual but there's also the
[51:43] broad tree and you know that's almost a
[51:46] strange thing to explain because you
[51:48] yourself are tree Christ is the tree is
[51:52] the tree of life but when you are
[51:54] planted in righteousness you become part
[51:56] of that tree and it is growing up as
[52:00] well and that's what can be a little bit
[52:03] confusing to say well you know there's a
[52:05] doctrine that says well if I was born
[52:08] again in this Ephesus church age then
[52:10] it's only only as far as up as I could
[52:12] go his face but see it doesn't quite
[52:15] work like that because jesus said or
[52:17] grandma taught us that on the day
[52:19] pentecost's that they had all of these
[52:21] virtues all of them even though they
[52:25] were in the first churches now the ones
[52:27] that on the street that heard the
[52:28] preaching of the word rot off and hadn't
[52:30] had all that teaching for three and a
[52:31] half years they had a little bit too
[52:33] growing to go but see how there's two
[52:36] things happening there there's the
[52:38] planning of the individual and then
[52:40] there's the planning a growing of the
[52:42] broad tree and when it all comes to
[52:45] fruition in this last day it all comes
[52:47] to a head then something has to happen
[52:50] because if this is if if this is the son
[52:55] of man with a head and a body and you
[52:58] take that son of man and that was back
[53:01] there before the foundation of the world
[53:03] and put him in flesh so that he's
[53:05] restored back again walking around in
[53:08] the people not just one individual boy
[53:10] in the people that have heard the
[53:11] message and I believe the message then
[53:14] death cannot stand before the Son of man
[53:17] death cannot stand something's got to
[53:19] happen and if the son of man has made
[53:22] manifest again then the dead in Christ
[53:24] will have to rise they cannot stay in
[53:28] the ground something's going to happen
[53:32] either part brother Brown told us when
[53:35] you get born again or whatever age
[53:37] you're in or you you fall into the
[53:39] rhythm of the word the rhythm of the
[53:41] word for your day and I believe the
[53:43] rhythm of the word for our day is not
[53:46] just preaching on piddly things in the
[53:47] past but - preaching the deep things the
[53:50] mysteries of God that I've been hidden
[53:52] through the father's from the foundation
[53:54] of the world and are now being made
[53:56] manifest that God is under here he
[53:58] revealed himself in Christ that now he's
[54:00] revealing himself in the bride tree but
[54:04] also in the individual he's revealing
[54:07] himself in you and I you have to come
[54:09] from a baby form all the way up to a
[54:12] full a full stature even as the bride
[54:15] tree is growing up my goodness I ain't
[54:21] read any of my quotes I hope I'm not
[54:25] shouting there y'all
[54:27] I feel like I am a little bit but look
[54:36] how see Satan's scheme at work with the
[54:39] bride tree all down through the seven
[54:41] churches you can see Satan Satan's
[54:44] scheme was to to seal off the Word of
[54:47] God so that you couldn't get to it to
[54:49] put a barrier in there so that it
[54:50] couldn't be manifest and of course we
[54:52] know that that was all working in God's
[54:54] God's will his perfect plan because
[54:56] there are things that can be discussed
[54:58] now that could not be said then there's
[55:02] a time and a season for all things for
[55:05] example if he preached if the things
[55:07] that are being preached now were
[55:09] preached back then then you wouldn't
[55:11] have had an opportunity to be born but
[55:13] God had to wait for you to come into
[55:16] manifestation he had to wait for you to
[55:18] be here so that the word this word could
[55:20] be preached and then the whole plan the
[55:23] whole tree could be finished and you see
[55:28] you see Satan's scheme at work is as
[55:31] each of these Warriors went went to
[55:34] battle against the doctrine that Satan
[55:36] was was throwing out their ireenie us he
[55:39] was he did battlers only a few writings
[55:41] of him but he did battle against that
[55:43] idea that Jesus was not the Son of God
[55:44] he did he did battle against that idea
[55:47] that he was a separate person and he
[55:49] wrote against not Gnosticism the idea
[55:52] that a lower form of God came was like a
[55:57] creation the Demiurge they called it
[55:59] came out and that's the same doctrine
[56:02] that's being preached today on the the
[56:03] River Jordan doctor and that's the same
[56:05] thing you could trace it all the way
[56:06] back
[56:07] that's what I read his word against he
[56:09] had a story that he told a Polycarp or
[56:12] John John the Revelator in in a
[56:15] bathhouse and this guy named Cerritos
[56:17] that was teaching this this new stur
[56:19] sysm came in there and John said I don't
[56:22] even want to be in the same place with
[56:24] him lest the house fall down
[56:26] that's how much he disagreed with that
[56:28] doctrine you know I I wonder what it
[56:31] what would we do if the ones that were
[56:33] in that first church age came back and
[56:35] preached behind that pulpit what if they
[56:37] were standing here preaching
[56:38] Tom melius and and Alexander and
[56:41] philetus well and the things that they
[56:43] preached against you know Alexander and
[56:45] philetus you could say all they
[56:47] disagreed was was that the resurrection
[56:49] and was already passed
[56:50] that's all they disagreed with would you
[56:53] be alright with that today would you be
[56:55] fine with somebody disagree disagree in
[56:57] with the word like that today it seems
[56:59] like that's fine today but there's gonna
[57:01] be a people a real wheat germ that will
[57:04] not be fine with that they're gonna
[57:06] stand for the word and they're gonna say
[57:07] that ain't what Paul preached and if
[57:10] nobody else will I'll say it if nobody
[57:11] I'll tell you what if nobody ever
[57:13] invites me anywhere to preach if nobody
[57:16] if I don't have anywhere to preach but
[57:17] to the fencepost behind my house then
[57:19] let me sing the truth because like
[57:21] brother Brennan said I'd rather feast on
[57:23] own branch of water and soda crackers
[57:25] then stand for a lot of tommyrot that's
[57:27] being preached today so I Rania's stood
[57:31] for the truth and on down more and stood
[57:34] for the truth and you know you get in
[57:36] your head that that the devil aid the
[57:39] word down so much let my voice hear then
[57:43] a lot of these brothers barely had
[57:45] anything to preach but look Marta Jesus
[57:48] brother Brennan said Martin was the
[57:50] greatest since Jesus Christ to ever live
[57:52] he was a like that God shown that to
[57:56] shine light to call the people that were
[57:58] leaving to open the door for them to
[58:00] come out from the doctrines of
[58:02] denominationalism that have come up to
[58:05] come out from all that stuff and enter
[58:08] into the open door that's prepared for
[58:10] you and look at Colombo who was Martin's
[58:13] nephew he write all all the way up to
[58:15] Colombo he was baptizing in Jesus name
[58:17] is what the church age book says he was
[58:20] baptizing in Jesus name and still
[58:22] preaching one God but then at Nicaea
[58:25] that they got the the word began to that
[58:29] the devil began to get in there and
[58:31] slide his little ideas in there that
[58:34] maybe Jesus wasn't the same as God and
[58:36] he was a different person and it began
[58:38] to all these doctors began to encroach
[58:40] until they even lost their that's a
[58:43] great meaning of communion they lost the
[58:45] true baptism all these things but the
[58:48] Bible says in Joel chapter 2 that I will
[58:51] restore say
[58:52] I will restore what the the pommel worm
[58:54] and the cankerworm and the caterpillar
[58:55] and the locusts all these bugs all these
[58:59] bugs that have been eating away at the
[59:00] bride tree all this time you know
[59:03] they're eating away at the individual -
[59:05] it's false doctrine it's incorrect
[59:07] teaching and God has sent a five-four
[59:10] ministry gifts into the church to spray
[59:12] just spray down the bugs and get all
[59:14] that stuff off to cut away at the tree
[59:16] to cut on to trim them and prune and get
[59:20] everything straightened up so that so
[59:22] that God will have a perfect bride a
[59:25] true bride that's standing for the Word
[59:27] of God who doesn't feel the same way who
[59:30] doesn't fail to believe all the word all
[59:33] of the word do you believe that in this
[59:36] day God's gonna have a bride that
[59:37] believes all of the word do you know
[59:44] what that means
[59:45] that means that she's not gonna say I
[59:47] don't know why we got understanding on
[59:48] 70 weeks I mean she's not gonna say I
[59:51] don't know why we got to understand
[59:52] Christ mystery God reveal that means
[59:54] she's not gonna say I ain't got time to
[59:56] read marriage the divorce that means
[59:58] she's gonna be she's gonna be in the
[1:00:00] tape she's going to be in the message
[1:00:01] all the way because she's called the
[1:00:04] revelation she's caught the vision of
[1:00:06] what that means to get in the word and
[1:00:08] to accept the word accept the messenger
[1:00:11] certainly we believe and we're thankful
[1:00:13] that God sent a messenger but he sent a
[1:00:15] message he preached the message and he
[1:00:17] said I must decrease decrease so that he
[1:00:19] can increase what's increasing the Word
[1:00:22] of God in the people the people are
[1:00:25] catching the message and it's getting
[1:00:27] down to the wire now it's getting down
[1:00:30] to where you know brother but that's one
[1:00:32] one quote I have in my stack somewhere
[1:00:34] where brother brand said get in the
[1:00:36] wheat get in there because time is
[1:00:38] running out I'm gonna wind up in just a
[1:00:45] second here
[1:00:45] but you know what it is it's harvest
[1:00:49] time because we've come down to where
[1:00:56] you know the Bible says that when two
[1:00:58] there was two sewers that went out a
[1:01:00] sower went forth to sow and then when
[1:01:02] men were sleeping not watching then
[1:01:04] another sower went out
[1:01:06] and he began to sew tears and it wasn't
[1:01:09] till after the fruit the the real wheat
[1:01:11] began to bear forth fruit that they
[1:01:13] noticed that there were tears in there
[1:01:14] and that how it always is the the
[1:01:17] impersonator sees the real true and they
[1:01:21] want to impersonate that now that may be
[1:01:23] that I hip you understand the seals a
[1:01:25] little bit because first God does
[1:01:27] something and then the devil
[1:01:28] impersonates it that's always what
[1:01:30] happens and and and in in the church in
[1:01:34] the individual everything God does
[1:01:37] something in somebody's life and
[1:01:38] somebody wants to impersonate now don't
[1:01:40] be an impersonator because there's a way
[1:01:42] there's a way back there's a way back
[1:01:44] for Cain if he would have accepted it
[1:01:46] boy that's a controversial statement but
[1:01:49] the power of Jesus Christ is enough to
[1:01:51] purge any sin there's a way back for a
[1:01:53] tear he can take a cook a bird and turn
[1:01:55] it into a wheat plant that's the power
[1:01:57] of Jesus Christ I'm telling my power not
[1:02:00] some kind of idea but the real power I
[1:02:04] hope that was well-received all right
[1:02:10] because when when the real wheat term
[1:02:13] when the real wheat is made manifest
[1:02:15] again all the way from Lutheran Wesley
[1:02:19] all the way up from Pentecost then it's
[1:02:21] it's gonna receive the word it's gonna
[1:02:24] manifest the word there's not gonna be
[1:02:26] an impersonation to it it's gonna be the
[1:02:28] real genuine and there's got to be in
[1:02:30] this day the wheat germ made manifest
[1:02:33] just like that corn of wheat there fell
[1:02:36] into the ground where there ain't no
[1:02:38] hybridization to it you know almost
[1:02:42] makes you say like they said when Jesus
[1:02:44] said I'm rich man candy and they're
[1:02:45] entering heaven how is it possible but
[1:02:47] jesus said with God all things are
[1:02:50] possible amen and he said I am the
[1:02:55] resurrection and the life you know
[1:02:58] brother Branham back in the in the 30s
[1:03:00] or whatever he had those seven visions
[1:03:02] about all the things that were gonna
[1:03:03] take place and you can see all look
[1:03:05] around and see all the things that are
[1:03:06] happening he talked about how Mussolini
[1:03:08] would come up on the scene and he said
[1:03:10] if Mussolini ever goes toward Ethiopia
[1:03:12] marked this down there never
[1:03:15] peace till Jesus Christ comes and then
[1:03:18] he had that that vision of of Hitler and
[1:03:21] and fascism and Nazism come and then
[1:03:24] they combined up into communism and then
[1:03:26] he had the fourth vision of the
[1:03:27] technological advancements on how
[1:03:29] there'd be a little car and these are
[1:03:31] all things that they're poking fun at on
[1:03:32] the owner the internet and things
[1:03:33] there's no car that drives itself oh yes
[1:03:36] there are that's plenty of cars all you
[1:03:38] have to do is go to google and type in
[1:03:41] an egg-shaped car and you'll get like
[1:03:43] five pages of egg-shaped cards come back
[1:03:45] that are all that drive themselves and
[1:03:48] on down into the he began to talk about
[1:03:50] the the decay the immorality and then
[1:03:54] that powerful woman that will rise up
[1:03:56] and all these things that would that
[1:03:58] would transpire as the wheat is maturing
[1:04:02] all these because the earth is quaking
[1:04:04] the nations are quaking there's
[1:04:06] something's awakening something's
[1:04:08] happening the signs that the prophets
[1:04:11] foretold are here among us and we can
[1:04:13] see that wheat being full the week
[1:04:16] coming to maturity so if I could leave
[1:04:19] you with anything it would be run as
[1:04:21] fast as you can and give everything you
[1:04:24] have to getting into that wheat plant
[1:04:26] because when the wheat matures and the
[1:04:29] door is shut
[1:04:30] something's gonna happen I know I'm
[1:04:39] about to run out of time no hang on just
[1:04:42] for a few more minutes all right and we
[1:04:48] talked about how Jesus was tested we
[1:04:50] talked about how Satan's tests he's got
[1:04:53] to test that corner Weaver and he tests
[1:04:55] the bride tree he's testing the bride
[1:04:58] tree as a whole and he's testing the
[1:05:00] individual tree the individual he come
[1:05:04] to you and do these things that brother
[1:05:07] Branham talked about in the message the
[1:05:09] harvest time oh how about that talking
[1:05:12] about the harvest and you know he talked
[1:05:15] about how there's three things that
[1:05:17] ministers have to watch out money women
[1:05:19] in popularity but but you know I think
[1:05:21] these kind of art maybe another class a
[1:05:24] different class these things that we
[1:05:27] looked at in the scripture the
[1:05:29] now that the devil came and tested Jesus
[1:05:31] so let's see how the devil will tempt
[1:05:34] the individual first he tempts you like
[1:05:38] like he tempted Jesus to get away from
[1:05:40] the bread of life to tempt you away from
[1:05:43] the word that to get away from the idea
[1:05:46] the the revelation that man shall live
[1:05:49] by every word because it's not what the
[1:05:54] seminary says or what somebody else said
[1:05:56] or what Miss Jones thinks about it or
[1:05:58] what doctors showing so think about it
[1:06:00] now hang on now because I know I won't
[1:06:02] be hitting on now because you know
[1:06:05] there's so many say I heard
[1:06:08] such-and-such to preach this on the
[1:06:10] internet now what has that got to do
[1:06:12] with anything
[1:06:13] when you start talking about when you
[1:06:16] begin to look at personalities instead
[1:06:19] of the word then you're getting off
[1:06:21] you're getting off the beaten path now
[1:06:23] this is only the first thing that the
[1:06:25] devil does he says will you take the
[1:06:27] word or will you take what just somebody
[1:06:32] said somebody somebody famous
[1:06:34] somebody reputable in the message drops
[1:06:38] some some statement that is miles off
[1:06:41] from the word and you know us off the
[1:06:43] word you know but yet this a personality
[1:06:47] is somebody that seems really got to be
[1:06:50] enlightened and you know I I got caught
[1:06:54] up in that one when I was an early
[1:06:56] Christian I remember sitting in church
[1:06:58] one day and brother Wade was there and
[1:07:01] this brother that I had mired so much he
[1:07:04] he dropped this this bomb he was
[1:07:06] preaching behind the Pope and he said
[1:07:07] Jesus was not God until the river Jordan
[1:07:10] and I I think I cried for like a week
[1:07:14] I cried and I pray God if you just speak
[1:07:17] to this brother and open up his eyes but
[1:07:20] look you can't take something from
[1:07:23] somebody just because they're a
[1:07:25] personality that's what the devil will
[1:07:28] lay right in front of you and say well
[1:07:30] this seems like he's he sweats a lot and
[1:07:33] he's preaching he's flinging sweat
[1:07:34] everywhere and he he needs all of these
[1:07:37] things after he prayed and he's a gator
[1:07:39] but or whatever but that don't mean
[1:07:42] nothing if it's contrary to the word you
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:52] know the next thing the devil do is
[1:07:56] he'll come to you and he'll do like he
[1:07:57] did to Jesus he'll say cast yourself
[1:08:00] down now he that's what he told Jesus
[1:08:02] because Jesus could cast himself down
[1:08:04] but he'll give you a little bit
[1:08:05] something different something he'll give
[1:08:07] you a supernatural offer he'll give you
[1:08:11] a dream or vision he'll give you you
[1:08:14] know that's how that's one of the
[1:08:15] devil's cheapest ways to get in and mess
[1:08:18] up everything is to give somebody a
[1:08:21] dream and they'll say I know this has
[1:08:23] got to be from the Lord and he'll lay a
[1:08:26] vision out there but it says contrary to
[1:08:28] the word is anything but they want to be
[1:08:31] special they want to be supernatural
[1:08:33] they want to be an elite person in the
[1:08:36] church and so the devil will give that
[1:08:39] person a dream or a vision and I had
[1:08:41] well let's get let's get personal for a
[1:08:43] little bit I'm debating let's say
[1:08:55] somebody came to my family one time and
[1:08:57] I said I had this vision that you called
[1:08:59] to do such a such a thing
[1:09:01] oh I'll even go to I'll tell another
[1:09:03] story I know a minister brother of mine
[1:09:05] that he said a sister came to him and
[1:09:08] said you I know God gave me a dream that
[1:09:11] you're supposed to marry this person
[1:09:13] your God gave me a dream and he gave me
[1:09:16] all these things
[1:09:17] well what that's that's fine if it's led
[1:09:20] of the Lord because God speaks and
[1:09:22] dreams and he speaks in visions but it
[1:09:24] has to be it has to run in continuity
[1:09:27] with the word and you know I remember
[1:09:30] there was a story that the I can't
[1:09:32] remember his name but he's a brother out
[1:09:34] west that he told he said brother
[1:09:35] Branham told him how to find the will of
[1:09:37] God how to know whether it's the will of
[1:09:39] God in your life and he said there's
[1:09:41] these three lights and this is a tape
[1:09:43] table quote I hope I don't get in
[1:09:45] trouble for telling this but he said
[1:09:47] that the lights line up there's three
[1:09:49] lights and the three lights are that the
[1:09:51] it's got to be in the scripture it's got
[1:09:54] to be scriptural it's got to be a
[1:09:55] revelation personally to you that's the
[1:09:58] second and then God has to make a way
[1:10:00] for it to happen and then you know that
[1:10:02] it's the will of God but now if if
[1:10:05] something leads you off of that path it
[1:10:07] leads you away from the word you don't
[1:10:09] have any kind of revelation about it and
[1:10:12] it takes you in a different direction
[1:10:13] then stay away from that so see the
[1:10:18] devil the devil will try to tempt you by
[1:10:20] taking you away from the word by giving
[1:10:23] you a supernatural offer and see I'm
[1:10:25] bringing this out it don't let's not get
[1:10:28] sidetracked this is important to the
[1:10:30] lesson because this these are the things
[1:10:32] that the wheat will not stand they will
[1:10:35] not fall for the wheat the genuine wheat
[1:10:39] will see this coming a mile away and the
[1:10:43] third is a position a position in the
[1:10:47] church and that's what the devil offer
[1:10:51] Jesus so I yeah I'll give you all this
[1:10:54] thing I'll give you a position I'll give
[1:10:56] you I'll give you king of everything
[1:10:57] we're not having to die for it and
[1:10:59] everything but jesus said thou shalt
[1:11:00] worship the Lord only because that's the
[1:11:03] answer when when a minister gets up
[1:11:05] there it's not right for a minister to
[1:11:07] be preaching on their self and
[1:11:08] everything and making their self
[1:11:09] something be seeking a great big
[1:11:11] position of following it to be an
[1:11:13] overseer of a group of churches to set
[1:11:15] themselves up as some great leader
[1:11:17] because every ministry a god called
[1:11:19] ministry will always point to Jesus
[1:11:21] Christ that's what they're pointing to
[1:11:24] and that's what Jesus said when he said
[1:11:27] thou shalt worship the Lord only we're
[1:11:30] not seeking great positions and
[1:11:31] everything but it's it's written every
[1:11:33] man julia by every word of god and
[1:11:35] brother branham said it like this he
[1:11:37] said not by your proposition I'll make
[1:11:39] you the general oversee or a presbyter
[1:11:41] or deacon or I'll let you play the piano
[1:11:45] because you see people get so tied up in
[1:11:49] there are little positions and things
[1:11:50] that if if something happens and they
[1:11:53] get moved out or whatever something just
[1:11:55] kind of things move then instead of just
[1:11:58] letting the Lord have his way have his
[1:12:01] leading we get all upset about things
[1:12:04] like that
[1:12:05] you know all I have in life is let's
[1:12:08] let's get real here I like to preach I
[1:12:11] like to help people but if something
[1:12:13] happened in the Lord it took it away
[1:12:15] from me
[1:12:15] this is not all I have all I have is
[1:12:18] Jesus Christ that's all I have all all I
[1:12:23] have everything's wrapped up in Jesus
[1:12:26] Christ and I'm not saved because I'm
[1:12:28] preaching I'm preaching to help to edify
[1:12:30] but this is not everything that my whole
[1:12:34] life and my whole being and everything
[1:12:36] that I'm living for I'm living for Jesus
[1:12:39] Christ and I want to help the kingdom of
[1:12:41] God in any way that I can don't get me
[1:12:43] wrong now oh brother chance I'm gonna
[1:12:47] get in real trouble
[1:12:48] I'll be wrapping up in just just a
[1:12:51] minute hang on
[1:12:52] but so the wheat is maturing the wheat
[1:12:56] is coming to fruition the bride tree and
[1:12:59] and the individual tree and what happens
[1:13:02] when the wheat comes to fruition and you
[1:13:05] can see the wheat standing against all
[1:13:07] these schemes of the devil against all
[1:13:09] these things that the devil throws at
[1:13:11] them and something happens God has
[1:13:14] called for a separation and when the
[1:13:17] wheat begins to mature then the shut
[1:13:19] will pull away why why now now let's
[1:13:22] think about this for a second and what
[1:13:24] be closing and just give me give me like
[1:13:26] three more minutes and we'll be closing
[1:13:28] real quick
[1:13:28] now when Jesus began to preach he went
[1:13:32] out in the healing the sick and and
[1:13:33] discerning spirits casting out Devils
[1:13:35] and all of those things but then when he
[1:13:37] began to preach the word everything else
[1:13:40] began to pull away all the people began
[1:13:43] to pull away and what really did it was
[1:13:45] he said you got to eat my flesh and
[1:13:47] drink my blood and he said things like I
[1:13:49] and my father are one because because he
[1:13:53] knew his position he knew what was going
[1:13:56] on and when the wheat begins to come to
[1:13:59] a place where she knows who she is and
[1:14:01] has come to a position and she says I
[1:14:03] have an understanding of what the
[1:14:05] message was about then others it begins
[1:14:10] begins to draw away my brother brems
[1:14:14] said in the harvest time he said in that
[1:14:15] day jesus said when the Son of Man
[1:14:18] is being revealed not man the son of man
[1:14:21] not an organization the son of man the
[1:14:24] word living itself again among the
[1:14:27] people the word itself made flesh in you
[1:14:30] what happens to it he said what happens
[1:14:33] to that church finally listen that shut
[1:14:35] pulls away from that week when it begins
[1:14:38] to be manifested what happened the life
[1:14:41] was in the shook went all out in the
[1:14:44] week and the ministers can go ahead and
[1:14:47] come cuz I'm gonna I'm just gonna wrap
[1:14:49] wrap up and he said again in the harvest
[1:14:52] time he said not any man may touch it
[1:14:53] it's all pulling away we'll have nothing
[1:14:56] to do with it you have to do that he
[1:15:00] said this is where he said oh brother
[1:15:02] get in the wheat let your life this and
[1:15:05] you come out into the wheat will you
[1:15:08] believe God just stay with God are you
[1:15:12] sure you're going to make it when he
[1:15:16] said once again he said and the anointed
[1:15:18] ones at the end time notice the anointed
[1:15:20] ones only the word will separate them
[1:15:23] not the signs everybody's doing the
[1:15:25] science the only thing that will
[1:15:28] separate them is the word and it will be
[1:15:31] just like in the days of Jesus just like
[1:15:34] in the days of Jesus where Apollo said I
[1:15:37] don't know anything about the Son of Man
[1:15:38] they were able to teach Apollo's but
[1:15:41] will there be time left
[1:15:42] well there'll be time to absorb all the
[1:15:45] things that we've heard all over the
[1:15:47] years and to grow up or we'll well the
[1:15:53] time is running out it's time to get in
[1:15:56] the wheat plant and I'm gonna go ahead
[1:15:59] and turn it over to both day
[1:16:04] [Applause]
[1:16:14] [Applause]
[1:16:19] make sure you tell her brother how much
[1:16:21] you appreciate it but I believe it don't
[1:16:23] you I believe it we're in the wheat time
[1:16:27] we're not in all these others we drill
[1:16:34] [Music]
[1:16:40] we're not someone
[1:16:44] [Music]

[1:21:30] opportunity that the world has never
[1:21:32] been able to receive because they can't
[1:21:35] listen they don't have the years that
[1:21:37] they were able to hear they don't have
[1:21:40] the ability to be able to just sit down
[1:21:42] and get away from their own ideas and
[1:21:44] accept what you have to say unto us the
[1:21:47] Lord we thank you for the message and
[1:21:48] not in the messenger that brought it in
[1:21:50] to us we love you for your word because

[1:21:56] you now that you'd go there and be with
[1:21:57] a little Lily Lord and you take away
[1:21:59] that temperature we condemn it under the
[1:22:02] blood of Jesus Christ and saying Satan
[1:22:05] you have to take your hands off because
[1:22:07] the little bride is calling for it it's
[1:22:09] all the finished product nosed around
[1:22:10] the world and all that are watching
[1:22:12] today and whatever the time they're
[1:22:14] still praying to Lord and we all pray
[1:22:17] and bind this power of the devil
