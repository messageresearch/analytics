[1:52] says here green wasn't always the color
[1:55] of st. Patrick's Day paintings show the
[1:59] patron saint wearing blue robes and the
[2:03] official color of the garment order of
[2:05] st. Patrick was sky blue in 1541 British
[2:10] monarch Henry the eighth declared
[2:12] himself the king of Ireland
[2:14] indeed the country a royal blue coat of
[2:17] arms but as this enchantment with
[2:21] British rule grew over the centuries the
[2:23] Irish adopted green as a symbol of
[2:26] rebellion when you go back when you go
[2:34] back in history you realized why don't
[2:36] we do the things we do today and then
[2:39] you know you come back over all the st.
[2:42] Patrick's Day used to be a solemn
[2:44] commemoration of the day he died in 1927
[2:48] Irish officials even banned the sale of
[2:51] alcohol on his name day as well as on
[2:55] Christmas and dip front partly at the
[2:58] insistence of the Catholic Church until
[3:01] the early 1960s one of the only places
[3:03] you could buy a beer in Ireland on st.
[3:06] Patrick's Day was the well attended
[3:08] Royal Dublin Dog Show commercial
[3:13] pressure led to the lifting of the ban
[3:15] in 1960 March 17 regs fourth on the list
[3:20] of busiest holidays in America this
[3:23] doesn't hear buzias
[3:26] yeah in America by New Year's Eve
[3:31] Christmas and the fourth of July the
[3:32] drinks of choice
[3:33] the world so people are gonna do what
[3:38] they want to do and I'm so thankful that
[3:43] we celebrated different a different
[3:45] occasion today right the resurrection of
[3:48] the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:49] and you the believer in men
[3:53] praise the Lord how many believe he's
[3:55] alive he's alive and well amen so let's
[4:01] uh we're gonna read up here from Romans
[4:03] chapter 8 and we're just gonna have a
[4:07] responsive meaning here for just a
[4:09] moment and then huh
[4:10] then we'll get to a little little
[4:12] subject I was coming to I was gonna go a
[4:15] certain direction this morning but I
[4:17] didn't get time to get everything
[4:19] gathered together the way I wanted to so
[4:25] maybe at another time so I decided to go
[4:28] this route instead so let's uh let's
[4:32] read Romans chapter 8 and you're welcome
[4:34] to look here or vary your Bible for you
[4:38] have not received the spirit of bondage
[4:40] again to fear but you have received the
[4:43] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[4:46] Father and if children then heirs heirs
[4:57] of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so
[5:01] be that we suffer with him that we may
[5:04] be also
[5:07] [Music]
[5:16] for the earnest expectation of the
[5:20] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[5:22] of the sons of God because the creature
[5:36] itself also shall be delivered from the
[5:39] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[5:42] liberty of the children of God and not
[5:53] only they but ourselves also which have
[5:56] the firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[5:59] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[6:02] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[6:05] of our body but if we hope for that we
[6:21] see not then do we then do we with
[6:25] patience wait for it
[6:27] [Music]
[6:42] and he then searches the hearts knoweth
[6:45] what is the mind of the Spirit because
[6:47] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[6:51] according to the will of God remove me
[7:04] therefore know he also did predestinate
[7:06] to be conformed to the image of his son
[7:09] that he might be the firstborn among
[7:11] many brethren I would say then what
[7:30] shall we then say to these things if God
[7:32] be for us who can be against us who
[7:47] shall lay anything to the charge of
[7:49] God's elect it is God that justifies
[7:52] [Music]
[8:06] who shall separate us from the love of
[8:08] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[8:12] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[8:15] peril or sword nay in all these things
[8:28] we are more than conquerors praise God I
[8:57] always received comfort when I read
[8:59] those words yes that was one of my
[9:02] favorite scriptures because it gives us
[9:05] a hope so it confirms that hope that's
[9:10] already it should be lady and then I say
[9:12] man that none of these things no matter
[9:15] what takes place no matter what happens
[9:17] in our lives they can't separate us from
[9:19] the love of God they can't separate you
[9:22] from what God has already started in
[9:24] your in your in your soul is in right
[9:27] that's that's eternal right and if it's
[9:30] eternal that means it's an anchor that
[9:32] just can't be moved you see Satan would
[9:36] want to make you think that it's uh it's
[9:39] it's for for a short time got to take it
[9:42] away any moment God doesn't love you go
[9:44] but you see when when you have an anchor
[9:47] and you know whom you have believed that
[9:49] you Paul says I know who I have believed
[9:51] in this way and I'm persuade when you
[9:54] persuaded about something but nothing
[9:58] nothing can can keep that away from you
[10:02] I mean it can't take that away from
[10:03] right
[10:04] I mean I'm persuaded if that my wife is
[10:07] my wife
[10:08] nobody to take that away from me you
[10:11] can't tell me she's not your wife you
[10:13] can't tell me she's she doesn't she
[10:15] doesn't live in the house with you she
[10:17] doesn't sleep in the same bed that you
[10:19] sleep in keep me awake for about an hour
[10:22] to two hours last night I'm not fully
[10:31] there this morning because she stayed up
[10:33] let's not watch him brother waited in
[10:35] the Philippines so but at the same time
[10:38] I understand it's because it was the
[10:40] anniversary of the Royals meeting and
[10:42] that's the trishing roping before she
[10:44] came to America so it's very dear to her
[10:47] heart you know it's very special she
[10:49] wanted to watch it live and of course
[10:51] you know where the wait was they're
[10:52] ministering so hard I'll give it to her
[10:56] but it but it yeah I went to I went I
[11:01] went to bed late and then of course you
[11:03] know a few hours later you know she she
[11:05] was up side every now and then I'd wake
[11:07] up and not here by the way but anyways
[11:19] but you know thanks
[11:21] yeah I know I know that that's my wife
[11:24] that you can't persuade me any other way
[11:26] no you can't tell me I promise Christine
[11:29] is not my wife because I know that I
[11:31] know it I know that she is that's how we
[11:34] have to do that's how we have to see God
[11:36] in our lives amen that you know that you
[11:39] know that you know that he's your father
[11:40] and that you are him and he meant and
[11:44] that he is you praise God that he's in
[11:47] you amen
[11:48] that's how that's how we have to stand
[11:51] on the word in that way amen and so much
[11:54] that it makes us act upon the word when
[11:57] you stand upon something and when you
[11:58] really convinced on something you act
[12:01] upon that right right I know she's my
[12:04] wife and that's the reason why I do
[12:07] husband type things for her right
[12:10] because I know she's my wife
[12:13] but if she's not my wife I wouldn't do
[12:15] there are certain things I wouldn't do
[12:16] you see big finding if I knew for sure
[12:19] she wasn't my wife but I know for a fact
[12:21] that she's my wife and I'll do I'll act
[12:24] upon that you see so so there's uh
[12:27] that's how we have to sing God in our
[12:29] life thing man and in Saints you know as
[12:32] we were reading here just while ago the
[12:35] earth and that's what I was looking at
[12:38] I've been looking at a couple of a
[12:40] couple of days just kind of is kind of
[12:42] thinking how the earth was cursed
[12:46] because of men's of because of men's
[12:48] decision there in the Garden of Eden
[12:50] right you know Adam wasn't cursed it
[12:53] wasn't it was the earth that was cursed
[12:55] you see the ground and because of that
[12:57] curse thorns and thistles came about
[13:00] now those thorns and thistles were not
[13:02] there to kill the man right then you
[13:06] don't get killed by a thorn in a thistle
[13:08] right you don't you don't die if you get
[13:11] poked by a thorn in this one but those
[13:14] thorns that they hurt it hurts but those
[13:17] thorns and thistles were there to
[13:19] constantly keep a reminder to men that
[13:22] where they came from there their fallen
[13:24] condition they're in a falling condition
[13:27] and God had to come in in some way or
[13:31] another and remember when Christ was was
[13:33] crowned with a crown of thorns maybe he
[13:36] took all those thorns all that sin all
[13:39] that all that in other words I'm
[13:42] liberating everything even though even
[13:44] from from that amen is gonna liberate
[13:48] your your whole earth he sees and we're
[13:52] another brother Brendan preached to
[13:54] feature home and he talked about how how
[13:57] the earth is not going to be a one point
[14:00] in time cuz thorns and thistles weren't
[14:02] on the original creation
[14:06] thorns and thistles came about after man
[14:08] sent so it's so interesting how how he
[14:12] was crowned with a crown of thorns to
[14:15] let us know hey it's all on me it's all
[14:19] going back
[14:20] he's the head right and just thinking
[14:24] about that and how how god is you know
[14:28] those little things are in the scripture
[14:29] like that for a reason you know you
[14:31] think Oh crown of thorns is there to you
[14:33] know for pain and suffering but that had
[14:35] a symbol and Romans are there Romans are
[14:37] there doing what they were doing to
[14:41] Christ not knowing they were fulfilling
[14:43] bigger scriptures you know and things
[14:46] are set so it's amazing how God does
[14:50] things in the scripture and we could
[14:52] just take some time and pay attention to
[14:54] the certain details of the word amen
[14:57] just just think sometimes you know even
[15:00] brother brown says that sometimes as
[15:01] we're praying some as we're praying God
[15:06] just is one of the best times it up I'm
[15:08] getting I'll get like thoughts that just
[15:10] come to mind you know just I guess if
[15:12] you can say revelations you know I mean
[15:14] I've gotten sermons just out of print
[15:17] yes
[15:18] you know like wow yeah I didn't see that
[15:20] before why is because now Paul is Paula
[15:23] st. here sometimes you don't know what
[15:24] to pray about but it's it's the prayer
[15:27] that's groaning within you right just as
[15:30] that creep the creation and the creature
[15:32] is groaning we are groaning as well
[15:35] because we have a connection to this
[15:37] earth right they have a connection to
[15:39] the creature there's a good we have a
[15:41] connection to out of the dust we came
[15:43] and
[15:43] and right now the dust we will go that
[15:47] you know in the current simple state
[15:49] that our bodies are in right now but we
[15:51] have a connection with it but sometimes
[15:53] we don't know what we need to pray for
[15:56] right but he knows so if you get in the
[15:59] spirit as you pray all of a sudden just
[16:03] things start flowing and you don't even
[16:04] know you don't even know oh my goodness
[16:06] how do you even know that that was that
[16:08] was laying there but it's God and if God
[16:12] lays in you you know he's dwelling in me
[16:15] he'll give you he'll he'll let you know
[16:17] what you need sometimes we think we need
[16:19] something in reality we need something
[16:22] else that'll lead to the to - to the to
[16:27] the you know - to minister to that
[16:31] specific point that you think that you
[16:33] need we think that God made needs to do
[16:36] it as in this certain way you know but
[16:39] in reality God knows the exact to
[16:43] minister to that specific music yeah so
[16:46] we just appreciate the Lord amen amen
[16:51] so I'm gonna go here to Romans chapter 5
[16:56] Romans chapter 5 and
[17:03] that's here in verse 1 it says therefore
[17:06] being justified by faith we have peace
[17:09] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[17:12] by whom also we have access by faith
[17:16] into this grace wherein we stand and
[17:19] rejoice in hope of the glory of God and
[17:22] not only so but we glory in tribulations
[17:26] also knowing that tribulation worketh
[17:28] patience and patience experience and
[17:32] experience hope remember in the last
[17:36] spiritual we just talked about hope
[17:37] right there's that hope within us that
[17:41] we're not going to live you know in this
[17:43] pest house in this condition right
[17:49] and-and-and-and because we're we're
[17:51] groaning for that that means there a hat
[17:53] that has to be out there for us see
[17:55] otherwise our bodies wouldn't be calling
[17:57] for that remember our brother Graham
[17:59] talked about the little boy who was
[18:00] eating the petals off the bicycle
[18:02] because his body wasn't even sulfur and
[18:05] your body will tell you if you need a
[18:06] certain nutrient in your body it'll tell
[18:08] you you need this it'll start something
[18:10] will start coming out of your skin or
[18:12] something it'll tell you hey you need
[18:14] such a circus of such and such a
[18:17] nutrient or a deer and because if that
[18:20] new trip wasn't available if that new
[18:24] tune wasn't available it wouldn't be
[18:26] giving you that sign right but it
[18:28] because that nutrient is available for
[18:30] you or that thing is available for you
[18:33] think that's the reason why you're
[18:34] getting that time you think are you
[18:36] getting that smile the boy was even the
[18:38] petals off of the devices because he was
[18:40] needing sulfur so we have a hope we were
[18:43] desiring more than this than what we
[18:45] currently have right yes verse three and
[18:49] not only so but we glory in tribulations
[18:51] look out Paul says we glory in
[18:53] tribulations
[18:59] that's so that's that's that the hard
[19:01] thing isn't it sometimes we think
[19:05] tribulations is just you know what the
[19:07] martyrs went through when they were
[19:09] being ripped apart by horses and things
[19:11] like that but you know you can be going
[19:13] through a personal tribulation but Paul
[19:18] says he we glory in them not because
[19:21] there's a bigger picture there's a
[19:24] bigger picture we glory in tribulations
[19:28] also knowing that tribulation worketh
[19:32] patience and patience experience and
[19:36] experience hope a hope and hope maketh
[19:41] not ashamed because the love of God is
[19:44] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[19:48] Ghost which is given unto us for when we
[19:51] when we were yet without strength in due
[19:54] time Christ died for the ungodly amen so
[20:00] you know sometimes Jesus he allows us
[20:03] you know to go through pain shame
[20:05] suffering because he knows what our
[20:08] expected end will be right he wouldn't
[20:12] give you something that you can't there
[20:15] he will allow for you to go through
[20:17] something that you're not gonna be able
[20:19] to go through what that would be unjust
[20:22] for him to do that right what an unjust
[20:25] got it they would be if he puts you
[20:27] through something that you can't that he
[20:29] knows himself you're not gonna be able
[20:31] to make it through but because you go
[20:33] through something a lot of us because he
[20:35] has so much confidence in you that you
[20:37] know that you that's what Jeremiah 29
[20:41] gemenon 2011 says for I know the
[20:43] thoughts that I think toward you right
[20:47] says the Lord says thoughts of peace and
[20:51] not of evil to give you an expected end
[20:57] think of God is expected he knows what
[21:02] the outcome is gonna be to him it's not
[21:03] a surprise yes right to you and me it's
[21:06] a surprise yes oh my goodness but then
[21:09] yeah
[21:09] it's no surprise at all why because it's
[21:13] an expected end if he knowing the
[21:16] beginning from the end what would
[21:18] something that takes place in our life
[21:20] what would it take him by surprise it's
[21:23] right you see it doesn't doesn't doesn't
[21:27] do one thing he just knows he knows
[21:30] what's gonna what the outcome is gonna
[21:32] be
[21:33] and so he's smiling about it not knowing
[21:35] it's gonna be a good outcome about this
[21:38] right it's molding a character in my
[21:41] sons and my daughters its molding of
[21:45] patience its molding experience its
[21:48] molding a hope in them that they didn't
[21:51] have before right so so the events in
[21:57] your life you know they're they're
[21:59] expected by God the Colossians 3:3 says
[22:02] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[22:06] with Christ in God that is in your life
[22:11] is so your life should be so hid in
[22:14] Christ with God in the anointing right
[22:18] with God the Satan can't even find it
[22:23] should be so that's how kid you are so
[22:27] something's happening in your life
[22:30] you're already getting Christ you're
[22:34] already hitting Christ Christ already
[22:36] Christ already has you covered
[22:39] you see when something's happening in
[22:41] your life
[22:44] and you know God has a vision for each
[22:48] and every one of us and he knows what it
[22:52] will take to get us to that place yeah
[22:55] amen he knows exactly what what you need
[23:00] you know when when I when a potter is
[23:02] working with with clay he is not he's
[23:08] not sitting there treating that clay all
[23:10] nice and all smooth and all you know
[23:17] this way I'm going to the base is gonna
[23:20] come out of just me you know kind of
[23:22] like rubbing a cat you know you know
[23:25] there's gonna be a vase to come out of
[23:27] this and he's in there that you think
[23:29] that base is gonna come out of him just
[23:31] sitting there doing that no we're a
[23:34] beautiful you know something
[23:36] nothing like that is gonna come out of a
[23:40] real Potter now yes right you know a
[23:43] real Potter
[23:44] a fake Potter maybe you know you it'll
[23:46] probably show you yeah I know how to do
[23:48] things I'll make a vase the base never
[23:52] comes out right but a true Potter
[23:56] he looks electro two-parter already has
[24:00] in his mind the end goal yes right and
[24:04] that's what's motivating him to do what
[24:07] he's doing and so he's taking water he's
[24:10] taking he takes mud at a mud and clay
[24:14] out of out of the ground and dumps it on
[24:17] the and starts it starts shaping this
[24:20] thing on this on the potter's a wheel
[24:23] and it starts going I mean he's he's
[24:25] come and he's moving and he's he's
[24:28] squeezing and he's he's using his hands
[24:30] why because he's a true Potter and he
[24:33] knows exactly what needs to happen in
[24:35] order to to mold that into what he
[24:38] already knows that it's gonna be there
[24:41] he knows what he's doing and the clay is
[24:44] probably funny he doing this to me not
[24:46] there no but that's where he needs you
[24:50] in order to build that beautiful little
[24:52] part that he that maybe that little side
[24:55] with the handle you know yeah he needs
[24:58] to do that right in order to build that
[25:00] little handle in your life right and so
[25:03] and so you know that's what I that's why
[25:05] I think is the scripture that says Kenda
[25:07] can the clay say to the Potter don't do
[25:09] this to me no they can't so what's the
[25:13] best thing for you to do is just to
[25:15] submit to him
[25:17] submit to what is going on in your life
[25:20] submit to what is happening because God
[25:23] is in full control you didn't take you
[25:25] by surprise right he knew her from the
[25:28] before the foundation of the world and
[25:31] so if he knows it from the foundation of
[25:32] the world why by why are we get we get
[25:36] so alone I understand we get alarmed and
[25:38] we did we did humanly speaking we do
[25:42] that's gonna happen right writers truth
[25:44] that's gonna happen but then we have to
[25:47] reflect and see the bigger picture I
[25:49] have to stop and say what's the bigger
[25:52] picture here and and and and ultimately
[25:57] if it's happening to you God is only
[26:00] concerned about fulfilling his word
[26:01] right and so if it's happening in your
[26:04] life God that means God is concerned
[26:07] about fulfilling his word in your life a
[26:09] minute so so pain amen I if I guess I
[26:14] could give this a title the purpose of
[26:16] pain in a Christians life because pain
[26:18] is part of that vision that God has that
[26:22] painting has to come yes right you know
[26:26] they say no pain no gain
[26:27] if you don't sacrifice anything in your
[26:30] life if there's no if you don't if you
[26:34] don't put it you know if we don't
[26:36] sometimes we need to let our children
[26:38] experience certain things in life so
[26:41] that it can understand what it means to
[26:43] be in that condition and I can come out
[26:47] of that you see but if we don't let our
[26:51] children experience anything bad in our
[26:53] lives and things like that
[26:54] they're never gonna grow up and learn
[26:55] and learn anything yeah we need to let
[26:58] them sometimes experience they're going
[27:01] through that in their life you pray for
[27:03] them you led them to a certain point but
[27:06] now God you have to do the rest
[27:09] I can't I can't be there you know
[27:13] sometimes Bella she's getting older and
[27:16] he's always getting older and I I can't
[27:20] be there 24/7 with him right right and
[27:23] they make mistakes and then they come
[27:25] back
[27:26] Bella sometimes I'll pick her up from
[27:27] school and she comes back baby crying
[27:30] and and I said what's in the best thing
[27:33] for you to do as a father as a parent
[27:35] just to listen to him just talk with
[27:37] them you know and just say what's going
[27:39] on and they'll start pouring their heart
[27:41] out to you and then you realize how you
[27:43] say something oh my gosh but to them
[27:47] it's really and to them it's a pain and
[27:50] then it's it's something then but
[27:52] because you should have more maturity to
[27:55] see it that way you know so because
[27:57] you're they're coming to you for help
[27:58] right now because they see you as a
[28:01] guide right we're there God until they
[28:04] get the Holy Ghost right yeah they come
[28:08] to you with with this with this pain in
[28:10] their life something that happened to
[28:12] them and they're in there and and and if
[28:15] you're if you know if you're not there
[28:17] to listen to them you know and to guide
[28:20] them scripturally you know they're gonna
[28:23] go off and listen look listen to
[28:26] somebody else or tell it to somebody
[28:28] else a friend or something something
[28:30] they want to be heard right now so pain
[28:35] but but in going back to that but
[28:39] sometimes they need in your mind you're
[28:41] thinking but you know what they need to
[28:43] go through that yeah they need to have
[28:45] experienced that because when they get
[28:47] to be alone on their own no you can't be
[28:52] there for them right every time so when
[28:54] they get to be the butter on their own
[28:56] so god it is molding us in that same way
[29:00] you think we think we're mature and we
[29:03] think we're we read and we are all
[29:06] Muslim you know the older ones here
[29:09] obviously they're more mature
[29:10] and I am and and some all of us are in
[29:14] different levels of maturity you think
[29:16] God knows better than them than we do
[29:20] and you might you might be a certain age
[29:22] but but and but God knows exactly what
[29:26] else you need in your life to get you to
[29:29] where he has envisioned before in the
[29:32] foundation and you can be you can be 75
[29:34] 80 you can be 50 you can be 21 it
[29:39] doesn't matter but if you're still here
[29:42] on this earth it means God's not done
[29:44] with you you still need to fulfill
[29:48] something in your life and you still
[29:51] need to grow all right
[29:54] we're still grown and it's like a story
[29:59] that I was reading about it there that
[30:01] was caught in a trap you know there that
[30:05] a hunter you know he's caught matrac the
[30:09] berries continent trapping a kind hunter
[30:12] he wants to go help free the bear and
[30:14] the bear is there wrapped in pain you
[30:17] know he's in pain but the the hunter all
[30:21] he wants to do is go and help him out
[30:23] but as he's trying to take the the trap
[30:26] off of him the bear thinks that he's
[30:28] trying to hurt him even north because he
[30:30] feels the pain even more and in that
[30:34] bear in the North you know and he's
[30:36] trying to take and so the hunters I the
[30:39] only thing I could do this tranquilize
[30:40] him you know so he takes the get the gun
[30:43] out you know the and the bear screams
[30:46] out even more you know but he the better
[30:50] is not realizing that all the hunting
[30:53] do is just the help all the hunter wants
[30:56] to do is to get them to an expected end
[31:00] right right
[31:01] and it's painful it's painful but as I
[31:08] always say problems have a beginning and
[31:09] they have an end they're not eternal
[31:13] God's eternal right yes
[31:16] problems have problems they're not
[31:19] eternal
[31:20] problems have a beginning
[31:26] so some Psalms 23 says time we got a
[31:33] couple more minutes some 23 says the
[31:35] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[31:39] so the Lord is our Shepherd a sheep puts
[31:45] full confidence in his pastor in his
[31:48] Shepherd yes she that's what a sheep
[31:52] does yes I'm confident that as soon as I
[31:55] hear the voice of my shepherd I go to
[31:58] him and if he's dropped us off here to
[32:01] eat grass I'm confident that he knows
[32:03] what he's doing and if he's left he's
[32:06] walked over there and and he's not
[32:08] around I just keep my eyes on him as I'm
[32:12] eating but I'm confident that he knows
[32:14] what he's doing
[32:15] right amen so it's amazing how David
[32:19] said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[32:22] want
[32:22] in other words there's nothing that I'm
[32:25] that I will lack in my life because he's
[32:27] my shepherd right he makes me to lie
[32:31] down in green pastures he makes me say
[32:35] he leads me he makes me to lie down in
[32:38] green pastures you know when you have
[32:42] that in your mind you're thinking peace
[32:44] you're thinking comfort you you're
[32:46] thinking rest right he leads me beside
[32:50] the still waters
[32:51] and then he restores my soul
[32:56] amen he leadeth me in the paths of
[32:59] righteousness for his name's sake yea
[33:01] though I walk through the valley of the
[33:04] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[33:07] thou art with me not that you will be
[33:10] with me but you are with nothing and do
[33:13] I walk through the valley of the shadow
[33:14] of death
[33:15] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[33:17] Fowler prepares the table before me in
[33:20] the presence of my enemies in other
[33:23] words before my enemies before my
[33:25] problems I'm still eating good as far as
[33:30] the spiritual you know I'm still
[33:33] enjoying the benefits of God even though
[33:37] these problems all surround me right
[33:40] none of these things can overtake me
[33:43] because I'm in the Shepherd's hands
[33:44] right right before me in the presence of
[33:48] mine enemies thou anointest my head with
[33:51] oil my cup runneth over
[33:54] in the midst of trials in the midst of
[33:56] problems in the shadow of the valley of
[33:58] death and your cup can run over that's
[34:02] what David's saying that's right right
[34:04] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[34:07] me all the days of my life even in those
[34:10] days where problems are just up to here
[34:13] when you're drowning in problems and
[34:16] issues surely surely goodness and mercy
[34:19] shall follow me all the days are now and
[34:22] I will dwell in the house of the Lord
[34:25] forever amen praise the Lord
[34:47] I used to be a big comfort and I'll stab
[34:53] it in my mind you know what maybe me and
[34:58] Bob need to do that when we have to meet
[35:08] the new man what you gonna do then you
[35:11] have it 20 30 songs with me my wallet oh
[35:16] good what was what you use it for well
[35:20] but that was a that was an enemy in her
[35:22] life so it works for her right is how
[35:26] you take the wording man it would that's
[35:31] why I read one that's why we read the in
[35:33] Romans you know who shall separate us
[35:35] from the love of God yes nothing in this
[35:38] life we're in Christ nothing man so
[35:44] sometimes God allows us to make a fool
[35:47] of ourselves so that we can understand
[35:51] why this perfect will is for us yeah
[35:55] kind of like that you know one-way door
[35:58] mousetrap you know you know you think
[36:03] how do you think you got it all figured
[36:04] out you go right in it's wonderful in
[36:11] here
[36:11] all right stuff for me to get out it's
[36:17] not so easy now to get out isn't thought
[36:22] you knew you thought you had it all
[36:24] figured out how am I gonna get out of
[36:27] this Lord then the Lord allows for you
[36:32] to give through those one-way door
[36:34] Travis yeah not really a trap but it's a
[36:37] position as a place where he's trying to
[36:39] put you in to make you realize listen
[36:42] you don't know everything you need me I
[36:46] know everything
[36:48] God you don't you need me you're gonna
[36:52] put tight position right now let me open
[36:54] the door for you right and then you
[36:57] realize oh god I should've trusted you
[37:01] all along man but that's you know that's
[37:05] the permissive will versus His perfect
[37:07] will right guard allows he will allow
[37:11] you to go through things in life and to
[37:13] you know for you to you know for you to
[37:18] realize what okay in that position I
[37:21] know that he or she is going to come out
[37:26] knowing this realizing this that's why
[37:32] that's why you know I've had times where
[37:33] I've had to let villages okay go ahead
[37:36] you're right sometimes you know she like
[37:39] poppy in school such and such and such
[37:41] and I know in my mind and my wife with
[37:43] knows I know my mind it's not that way
[37:45] okay then the next day she goes it's
[37:49] cool yeah puppy yeah I wasn't that the
[37:51] way I thought saying you know I wanted
[37:54] you to realize it on your own that's the
[37:57] best way you know for people to learn
[37:59] lessons instead of you being on top of
[38:00] them all the time you know let's let
[38:03] them go through it on their own you know
[38:06] that's how my mom and dad did to me and
[38:09] look at the way I came out
[38:18] the Saints really my mom and my dad when
[38:22] we came to the states I was 7 years old
[38:23] my mom and dad did not a speak English
[38:26] then oh no all of my dad knew was just
[38:28] to go work and then to raise his family
[38:31] and my mom was working as well a lot of
[38:34] times me and my sisters we have to just
[38:36] fend for ourselves we have to learn
[38:39] English and not knowing any bit of
[38:42] English and we came to the United States
[38:43] I was 7 years old
[38:47] we were in the house we had to do chores
[38:51] around the house and I'm talking about
[38:52] me not just go clean your room I'm
[38:55] talking about we had to go in and watch
[38:57] and said watch the bathtub wash pots and
[39:00] pans and things like that because my mom
[39:03] and my dad they had a longer vision of
[39:05] things you see a bigger vision it wasn't
[39:07] just oh I don't want to do this to my
[39:09] child it was a bigger vision you see
[39:12] exactly by then going through those
[39:15] experiences they're gonna learn bigger
[39:16] things in life and be more responsible
[39:19] in life and out and and and become
[39:20] something in life you see and that's the
[39:24] same thing with God and you God's not
[39:26] feeling bad what you're going through
[39:27] right now he understands he has he has
[39:31] he's looking at the outcome he's not
[39:33] looking at what you're going through
[39:35] he's looking his up the out and so my
[39:39] mom and dad date the my mom she has no
[39:41] regrets that she made us do chores
[39:43] around the house and things like that
[39:45] you know I had to there's things that I
[39:48] just have to do that I just have to
[39:49] learn how to do but you know I'm in a
[39:52] new country grew up was born in a
[39:55] totally different country and come to
[39:57] the states not knowing anything
[40:02] there's things my mom and dad can help
[40:04] us with my mama that can help me with
[40:06] school then you know the English
[40:08] language I had to understand learning
[40:12] the in acts go and learn and see and
[40:14] learn how to ask my teacher can you help
[40:16] me with this because I don't know I
[40:17] don't understand you see so it's not bad
[40:21] for you to have to go through something
[40:23] in life you will understand later why
[40:25] right
[40:26] you realize this is why I had to go
[40:29] through that because I'm like I I now
[40:31] know this yeah God's taking me through
[40:33] steps every way men and uh oh my and
[40:39] just just to finish with this brother
[40:41] branham remember when he went hunting
[40:42] that one time when he was in on his
[40:47] honeymoon with with his with his wife
[40:49] and his Billy Paul remember that he said
[40:53] well I'm gonna be in the honeymoon so
[40:55] I'm gonna go hunting at the same time
[40:57] then he thought he said he refueling
[41:00] what he says he I thought I was a
[41:02] woodsman no hunter and he realized he
[41:05] was lost and it had to come to a point
[41:09] where like that he had to say Lord I'm
[41:12] lost
[41:12] can you help me because my wife and my
[41:15] child they're down there at the bottom
[41:16] of this mountain waiting for me I need
[41:18] to get back to them but God knew where
[41:21] he was at he just wanted him to know
[41:22] where he was at four hundred to a point
[41:25] where he needs to know where he's at and
[41:28] God said okay I can
[41:29] you out now right so that's that's the
[41:32] same thing with us that's the purpose of
[41:33] pain in our lives I hope you get
[41:36] something out of it and just just be
[41:38] prayerful just just continue believing
[41:40] God's promises for your life amen
[41:42] no matter what you're going through god
[41:44] bless
