[39:38] heavenly father we thank you for all
[39:41] things and we know that you give them to
[39:42] us freely
[39:44] but then you told us to ask and we shall
[39:47] receive
[39:48] you said you knew what we had need of
[39:50] before we prayed but yet you still tell
[39:51] us to ask
[39:53] so we just asked lord not a miss to
[39:55] consume it upon our lust as the word
[39:57] says but
[39:58] to be able to
[40:01] lord let you guide each one of us into
[40:04] the correct way
[40:05] and guide us now and teach us to wait

[40:30] keep us in your grace in jesus name
[40:33] amen
[40:35] revelations 1
[40:39] maybe we'll get off of this in another
[40:40] message or so but we'll see
[40:43] says the revelation of jesus christ
[40:45] which god gave unto him
[40:48] to show unto his servants things which
[40:50] must come
[40:51] must shortly come to pass and he sent
[40:53] and signified by his angel unto his
[40:55] servant john who by a record of the word
[40:58] of god and the testimony of jesus christ
[41:00] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[41:02] he that readeth and they that hear the
[41:04] words of this prophecy
[41:06] and keep those things which are written
[41:08] therein
[41:09] for the time is at hand now let's go
[41:12] over to revelations 4 1.
[41:21] it says after this now the prophet says
[41:23] that after the church ages
[41:26] all right
[41:27] you you go through one two and three so
[41:29] you get two and three gets the church
[41:31] ages covering after this i looked and
[41:34] behold a door was opened in heaven
[41:36] and the first voice which i heard
[41:38] as it were of a trumpet talking with me
[41:41] which said
[41:42] come on up hither and i will show thee
[41:45] things which must be hereafter and
[41:47] immediately i was in the spirit and
[41:48] behold the throne was set in heaven and
[41:50] one said on the throne and he that set
[41:53] was to look upon like a jasper and
[41:56] started in stone and there was a rainbow
[41:58] round about the throne inside of
[42:00] insight like unto an emerald amen you
[42:03] may be seated the lord had his blessing
[42:06] to the reading of the word
[42:09] now
[42:13] we kind of put in a little thought there
[42:15] wednesday night you know just had a
[42:17] little message on prayer
[42:20] and
[42:21] things and
[42:22] but
[42:23] we just kind of injected that as a
[42:24] thought in the middle
[42:26] of our
[42:27] our series that we've been going on
[42:30] you know
[42:32] but see we've covered
[42:35] pretty well now revelations one
[42:38] we haven't went through you know at all
[42:41] like we need to i'm sure that but
[42:43] we've covered it and we didn't read the
[42:46] church ages you know but we have been
[42:48] talking about the church ages and
[42:51] and the things of of what is transpiring
[42:55] and
[42:56] you know so it's bringing it down
[42:58] and whatever the point we've been trying
[43:00] to make is
[43:02] that
[43:04] jesus didn't know these things when he
[43:07] was up on earth
[43:09] about his part in the kingdom
[43:11] he didn't know about uh you know his
[43:14] coming
[43:15] and all and
[43:17] that's what we've been trying to cover
[43:19] that when he comes here to john on
[43:21] patmos
[43:22] then now he does know that see after his
[43:24] death burial his resurrection and
[43:26] everything now he knows so he's coming
[43:28] it's not two gods or whatever it's god's
[43:32] way of doing things i wish you would get
[43:34] that in your mind
[43:36] that uh say what do you mean jesus being
[43:38] y'all say jesus was god but yet he
[43:40] didn't know everything
[43:42] well do you know everything
[43:45] oh well all right since no solve the
[43:48] problem
[43:49] but see that's what we
[43:51] because when you start doing things like
[43:53] that you think you do know all things
[43:54] okay maybe i shouldn't say those things
[43:56] but i will because when you when you're
[43:59] trying to figure out something you're
[44:00] trying to say that god didn't have it
[44:02] right
[44:03] all right but he had no other way of
[44:05] doing it we've been through that and he
[44:07] has
[44:08] made it manifest all right
[44:11] now
[44:12] see then he would know
[44:15] the lord jesus christ knew who he was
[44:17] he said unless you believe that i am he
[44:19] you'll die in your sins but there was
[44:22] something withholding from him which
[44:24] would have been
[44:25] the coming of his coming
[44:28] uh you know in his second coming and it
[44:30] would also be his future work
[44:33] in the church ages to come and even on
[44:35] down through into the future all the way
[44:38] to the future home the ending of all
[44:41] things
[44:42] all right but he he's come here to
[44:44] patmos to bring these things
[44:47] to
[44:47] uh the church
[44:49] yeah that's who it's directed to because
[44:52] it's given to john and it was given by
[44:54] the angel messenger
[44:56] and we've been through that to cover you
[44:58] know the messenger and what the
[45:00] messengers are and and the things but
[45:08] i want to emphasize that
[45:12] he's covering here
[45:14] to
[45:15] be written
[45:17] to where we could have it
[45:20] all right
[45:21] that was why i put a a couple of
[45:23] messages in there about the writing of
[45:25] the bible
[45:27] because
[45:28] uh
[45:29] how would we have known these things
[45:32] had it not been that he chose this way
[45:36] to bring it unto us you know
[45:38] see because we would have had the
[45:40] writings of the apostles we would have
[45:42] had those things but we would have not
[45:44] had the church ages and the future
[45:47] part of life or time you know on down
[45:50] and all that so he's he's been so
[45:52] marvelously gracious to give us the book
[45:55] of revelations to where we would
[45:57] actually know then the future and all
[46:00] the way down showing us all the ways i
[46:02] said to the future home all right
[46:04] now
[46:06] now jesus christ knew one thing he knew
[46:08] that he came to die
[46:11] all right
[46:12] he came to die
[46:15] and to be able to do that he would die
[46:18] to give his life
[46:21] now just a little small background
[46:24] to bring his life to where that he could
[46:27] come
[46:28] and live in you and me
[46:31] you know he knew that had to be that way
[46:33] there was no other way for it to come
[46:35] other than to do that and that that
[46:37] would bring forth then the father's
[46:40] strong our domain it would not bring
[46:43] forth the domain that he came and spoke
[46:46] of the kingdom he would speak of and and
[46:48] like the little sister there wanted her
[46:51] children to set boys you know sit one on
[46:52] one side in your kingdom and all and he
[46:55] said that's not for me not to you know
[46:57] be be understood or be given at this
[46:59] time but one of these days it will all
[47:02] right now we know that the father strong
[47:04] was the the baptism of the holy ghost
[47:06] down to the church ages
[47:09] all right and that was what he come to
[47:11] make way for
[47:13] or his kingdom see but one day there
[47:16] will be a kingdom on earth
[47:18] which will be the millennial reign
[47:21] all right and that was the point that
[47:24] was being made because that was what was
[47:26] told to
[47:27] to uh
[47:29] david
[47:30] there in uh what is second samuel 7 and
[47:34] 16 where he said thy kingdom shall be
[47:36] established forever
[47:38] or ever me and he showing him that it
[47:41] would be done and it was speaking of the
[47:43] coming forth of solomon in the natural
[47:46] right to sit on the throne of david all
[47:49] right but mainly speaking of the coming
[47:51] of jesus christ
[47:54] and how that he would come and one day
[47:56] he would sit jesus christ will sit on
[47:59] the throne of david
[48:01] to rule and reign in the millennial
[48:03] reign all right in doing that see it's a
[48:06] fulfillment of scriptures
[48:08] all right there were certain things
[48:09] jesus understood but certain things he
[48:12] didn't understand because it was not
[48:14] made known to him okay
[48:17] in that way see we we look at it as
[48:19] understanding then how god is revealing
[48:22] himself but are you getting what i'm
[48:23] talking about now
[48:25] that he first came to make way now we
[48:28] gave you number one there on one little
[48:30] bethlehem on your notes to word it was
[48:32] talking about david uh was the great
[48:35] anointed one
[48:37] you know and all but he was speaking
[48:38] really of the promised spiritual seed
[48:41] and he swore an oath that christ would
[48:44] sit on the throne of david
[48:46] all right it's a spiritual seed solomon
[48:49] set there at a natural but solomon's
[48:51] kingdom came to an end right
[48:53] see because it ended as far as when he
[48:55] died that was his kingdom you know it
[48:57] went on to somebody else but still it
[48:59] was an end to it
[49:01] and uh you know but she was promised
[49:05] the throne to sit on
[49:08] all right
[49:09] then we get there in the church ages you
[49:10] know he that overcomes and sit with me
[49:12] and my throne you know sit with my
[49:14] father in his throne then we'll overcome
[49:16] and sit with him in his throne and
[49:17] that's showing that in the last
[49:20] day something would take place upon the
[49:23] earth that we want to cover in a few
[49:24] minutes but you know but but i want to
[49:27] you to to uh to see something because i
[49:30] believe this is the point we need to
[49:33] to cover
[49:34] all right
[49:35] now
[49:36] that's why the in the scriptures
[49:39] you don't see him called the lord jesus
[49:42] when he was on earth
[49:44] he kept saying son of man
[49:47] son of man
[49:49] all right and see they didn't understand
[49:51] that they understood the point don't
[49:54] mismiss me now they understood the point
[49:57] that son of man
[50:00] in the basis of that it would be
[50:02] prophetic
[50:03] they understood that part now don't
[50:05] misunderstand when i say they didn't
[50:06] understand
[50:08] they understood that it would be a
[50:10] prophetic
[50:11] doing and they look for the messiah to
[50:14] be you know
[50:16] the christ
[50:17] the prophet that was promised to come by
[50:20] moses you know that god would raise up a
[50:23] prophet like unto me if you don't hear
[50:25] him see you'll be cut off now they
[50:27] understood that point but they didn't
[50:28] understand what he was actually making
[50:31] doing see they was looking for some kind
[50:34] of a conqueror some kind of something
[50:36] like that to be the messiah
[50:38] instead of looking at a little man that
[50:40] would be pushed around and seemingly run
[50:43] over all through his life and you know
[50:45] and everything and and they couldn't
[50:46] comprehend that you know had he come out
[50:49] killing the romans and fighting they
[50:51] would have probably a big portion of
[50:52] people joined in with him
[50:54] but because of him coming the way he
[50:56] come
[50:57] you know it would be that way but he had
[50:59] to come that way
[51:01] because how would the holy spirit ever
[51:03] come to the church
[51:05] you know i've got a message coming
[51:07] behind this
[51:08] on the soul and you know the things and
[51:11] predestination it'll be on over in a few
[51:13] weeks
[51:14] but
[51:15] i'll make this statement to you the the
[51:18] the soul of god was not seen in full
[51:21] manifestation in the old testament
[51:24] because if it had been i'll make the
[51:26] point then we'll come back to it because
[51:27] if it had been you would have been able
[51:29] to brought it into man
[51:32] but it wasn't no way to do it because it
[51:34] wouldn't you can't bring it out like
[51:36] that so we'll get to that later all
[51:37] right but now what i want you to see is
[51:40] he knew that he must die
[51:44] to release the life that was in him
[51:47] and that's what those pharisees and
[51:49] teachers and things
[51:51] they couldn't understand that
[51:53] right yet they would sing you know
[51:56] they pierced my hands and my feet they
[51:58] would read the scriptures
[52:00] of looking at it from isaiah on the
[52:02] different ones you know and they would
[52:04] see those things in the bible but they
[52:06] couldn't understand
[52:08] that
[52:09] here was their god that was going to
[52:12] come and die right and we're the only
[52:14] group of people in the world of any form
[52:16] of religion that has a god that many had
[52:20] to die
[52:22] all the others want some kind of doing
[52:23] this or some kind of doing that
[52:26] but our god had to die to release his
[52:28] life
[52:28] because he had not done that well see
[52:31] then he had to come then the son of man
[52:35] all right and he'd have to declare
[52:37] himself as son of man
[52:40] all right now we get down to it in a
[52:41] minute the reason why that has to be
[52:44] in the in the in the order but he had to
[52:46] be known as son of man
[52:49] because that way he would die son of man
[52:53] and he would raise son of god to come
[52:54] down to the church ages now we know it
[52:56] was the son of man that died it was the
[52:58] son of man body that was raised up sure
[53:00] we understand but that's not the story
[53:03] to be able to follow it that he died son
[53:05] of man he couldn't die son of god
[53:08] he had to die to release that life so
[53:11] while he was here up on this earth
[53:13] brother branham let's see i've got it in
[53:14] here at a while he said who is this son
[53:16] of man he said in the beginning was the
[53:18] word word was with god and the word was
[53:20] god now the son of god
[53:24] the spirit the logos the theophany god
[53:26] was dwelling inside of that flesh
[53:29] but when that time was here that he was
[53:32] on earth
[53:33] he was to be full fulfilling the son of
[53:35] man
[53:36] right all right then see none of your
[53:38] scholars understood that none of your
[53:41] people back there understood it um even
[53:44] after uh
[53:45] you know matthew mark luke and john
[53:47] writing other things and saying son of
[53:49] man you hear paul mentioning it not
[53:52] whatsoever
[53:53] i'm sure he probably thought of it and
[53:56] talked on it or whatever but it's not in
[53:58] the word of god
[54:00] because they would not understand what
[54:02] son of man meant
[54:04] the son of man would be the prophet
[54:08] all right as i said now they could
[54:10] understand that part
[54:12] they could understand that that a
[54:14] prophet was to come
[54:16] all right because they believed in their
[54:18] prophets but they didn't understand that
[54:20] this prophet would be god
[54:23] that's the part they couldn't comprehend
[54:25] and why he would keep saying
[54:27] son of man and why he would say
[54:30] to uh you know like pilate or whoever it
[54:32] was there when he said you know uh you
[54:34] know they say you're a king or you're a
[54:36] king he said unto that end i was born
[54:41] not that right then right and see he
[54:43] didn't worry about him because he said
[54:46] you know if if it was time in other
[54:48] words
[54:50] my people would fight but i'm not here
[54:53] to fight you pilot i'm not here to or
[54:55] pharaoh everybody is i get all them
[54:57] mixed up but
[54:59] he was telling him you know i've not
[55:00] come to do that now well he just turned
[55:03] him loose you know he wanted to free him
[55:04] because he couldn't see any uh
[55:06] connection of what uh you know would be
[55:09] uh any threat to it
[55:11] so he was willing to turn him loose but
[55:14] the jews wouldn't let him all right but
[55:16] now see he had to die
[55:18] he had to bring forth the father's
[55:21] strong
[55:23] and to do that many would have to die in
[55:25] flesh
[55:27] to release what was inside of him
[55:29] where that that was inside of him could
[55:31] come back
[55:33] up on the church on the day of pentecost
[55:36] in the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:38] so now we believe in many forms
[55:41] many ways god
[55:43] manifests himself but we don't believe
[55:46] in many gods
[55:47] because see we keep it in the order of
[55:50] one true and living god all right so
[55:52] then what did he do
[55:54] i gave you that on the unveiling of god
[55:56] number two and you know it's where it's
[55:57] talking about when the holy spirit came
[55:59] and he's talking about god being the
[56:01] spirit he was the holy spirit right son
[56:03] of god he lived through the church ages
[56:05] the son of god
[56:07] now in the millennium he'd be son of
[56:08] david because he's already with cain as
[56:10] son of man look like a paragraph a book
[56:14] now remember this is a very important
[56:16] part
[56:17] remember between the son of god and the
[56:19] ladies in age they put him out
[56:22] and in luke he said he would be revealed
[56:24] again the son of man
[56:28] the prophet fulfilling the rest of it
[56:31] said the scriptures are perfect it's the
[56:33] same god all the time just changing his
[56:35] form in morphe all right
[56:37] now
[56:38] what did he do
[56:40] he came to die
[56:42] the son of god could not come into the
[56:46] new birth could not come into the people
[56:49] until the death of the testators is that
[56:52] true
[56:54] we see it even in the old testament was
[56:56] required the death of an animal
[56:59] to make a sacrifice so that it meant
[57:01] that that god would have to come and die
[57:06] in flesh
[57:07] not die as god that's where that's my
[57:10] god can't die you know well you can't
[57:12] die either i can blow your head slap off
[57:14] you can't die
[57:17] that's that's not it you're gonna go
[57:18] somewhere else and wait a while
[57:21] see that's where we think we're really
[57:22] so smart we're using our terminologies
[57:25] when we show our stupidity
[57:27] in what we're doing
[57:28] but see
[57:30] one day he will sit
[57:32] upon the
[57:33] throne of david in the millennium
[57:36] all right
[57:37] but now if he's son of god then the
[57:39] catch is that see he would come as son
[57:42] of god the baptism of the holy ghost
[57:44] now as i said he could not come as son
[57:47] of god
[57:49] right there when he walked on earth and
[57:51] say i'm the son of god that would
[57:53] require uh or made a way or started a
[57:56] form to where that that some way he
[57:59] could enter into us
[58:01] right
[58:02] and everybody would just get anointed
[58:05] but that wasn't the story it requires
[58:07] the death
[58:08] to release the soul
[58:10] all right so now you understand it that
[58:12] way so i didn't understand it this way
[58:15] see then down to the ages he would be
[58:17] son of god
[58:19] all right
[58:21] but then right at the end time
[58:23] luke 17 30 would start being spoken
[58:26] about this prophet only
[58:28] that said you don't have the writers
[58:30] they don't write very little about the
[58:32] son of man you might find some here and
[58:34] yonder would mention something but
[58:36] the the catch is
[58:40] that he would have to come back in the
[58:41] end time and son of man
[58:45] now there's the thing that that the
[58:47] theologians that the writers and all
[58:50] they couldn't follow that line right
[58:52] but he's to come back in the end time
[58:56] thing
[58:57] and to do that he's gonna have to come
[58:59] back as son of man
[59:00] because you can't go from son of god to
[59:02] the millennium no more than you could go
[59:05] from son of god
[59:06] to the baptism of the holy ghost without
[59:09] it coming through the son of man
[59:12] see to live up on earth
[59:14] and give his life right are you you
[59:17] following me that way then it would
[59:19] release the life
[59:20] all right so then down in the church
[59:22] ages there's no way from going this well
[59:24] what do you mean brother dale it's just
[59:26] this son of god we believe the holy
[59:28] ghost and it's the holy ghost now glory
[59:30] hallelujah we're here ready to go well
[59:33] why haven't we gone
[59:35] i mean that's just the main thing
[59:38] but you see
[59:39] so he would have to come down to the
[59:41] ages
[59:43] and coming down through those ages as
[59:46] son of god
[59:48] the new birth
[59:50] coming back to the faith of the fathers
[59:53] by way of malachi 4.
[59:55] then see then coming to the point of
[59:57] being the son of man dwelling on earth
[1:00:00] again just for a little time in the end
[1:00:02] time amen now we'll get them down in a
[1:00:04] few minutes and read some what the
[1:00:05] prophet said but just remember brother
[1:00:07] adam was not the son of man
[1:00:12] he was a son of man
[1:00:15] these son of man is the lord jesus
[1:00:16] christ
[1:00:18] all right
[1:00:19] now see that separates it we'll read
[1:00:21] that in a minute to you
[1:00:23] but the point i'm trying to get you to
[1:00:24] look at is
[1:00:26] that
[1:00:27] watch it to the agency then here would
[1:00:29] come the prophet even before the seals
[1:00:31] would break anything you know
[1:00:33] immediately he would start talking about
[1:00:36] son of man
[1:00:41] and as as he would bring forth the son
[1:00:43] of man
[1:00:44] he's laying in order the scriptures
[1:00:48] that's right
[1:00:49] all right
[1:00:50] to show us
[1:00:52] what was to be in the end time right all
[1:00:55] right now
[1:00:57] because see we didn't know the scripture
[1:00:58] spoke like that that's right
[1:01:01] i mean you know i've never read any
[1:01:03] commentator or anything that spoke of
[1:01:05] how that he had to come back as son of
[1:01:07] man to be able to to to bring this thing
[1:01:10] to an end
[1:01:12] they might say he would come and son of
[1:01:13] man if they did they would just say he's
[1:01:15] going into the millennium from there
[1:01:18] but we've got to have a rapture
[1:01:21] and that's got to be related to the son
[1:01:23] of man
[1:01:24] right
[1:01:25] all right
[1:01:26] so then we're trying to follow the point
[1:01:29] now look at the next one
[1:01:31] which is the mighty god unveiled 1964
[1:01:35] uh
[1:01:36] 629. look what he says
[1:01:40] then we find after his death burial and
[1:01:42] resurrection he came on the day of
[1:01:43] pentecost as son of god god the spirit
[1:01:46] in the form holy spirit what was he
[1:01:48] doing he was changing himself making
[1:01:50] himself known to the people in a
[1:01:51] different form like the holy spirit
[1:01:54] which is god he came to deal through the
[1:01:56] church ages the son of god the holy
[1:01:57] spirit but in the millennium he comes
[1:02:00] the son of david to sit on the throne of
[1:02:02] david king
[1:02:04] he was to take the throne of david he's
[1:02:06] on the father's throne now see the son
[1:02:09] of god
[1:02:10] and then he said he that overcomes
[1:02:12] yourself with me on my throne as i've
[1:02:14] overcome instead of my father's throne
[1:02:16] he says it's the same god all the time
[1:02:18] going down to the next feast of the
[1:02:20] trumpets
[1:02:21] 64 7 19
[1:02:25] page 14
[1:02:27] now he's been revealed through the
[1:02:28] church ages now watch through the church
[1:02:30] ages the son of god god be in the spirit
[1:02:32] the holy spirit he revealed himself in
[1:02:34] the church ages
[1:02:36] as in the congregation now he followed
[1:02:38] him the holy spirit among the people
[1:02:41] we find in the lady you'll see in church
[1:02:44] age the last church page he's put out of
[1:02:46] the church
[1:02:48] you know he's going to be put out at son
[1:02:50] of god
[1:02:51] right
[1:02:52] because that's what they've turned down
[1:02:53] as the baptism of the holy ghost oh yeah
[1:02:55] they got their shouting and their glory
[1:02:56] hallelujahs and everything but it
[1:02:59] doesn't matter what you call it
[1:03:01] that's anointed right
[1:03:03] he's put out of the church nowhere else
[1:03:05] was ever put out
[1:03:07] in any age but in the lady of seeing
[1:03:09] aids because they said we're rich and
[1:03:11] have need of nothing he was put out of
[1:03:12] the church age and then according to
[1:03:14] luke 17 30 as it was in the days of
[1:03:17] sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:03:19] the son of man
[1:03:21] see now
[1:03:23] bringing it to the basis
[1:03:26] that you would see him
[1:03:28] in what he's supposed to be
[1:03:31] seeing him in the point
[1:03:36] of what means son of man
[1:03:39] and as i said get it in your mind then
[1:03:41] does everybody understand what i'm
[1:03:42] trying to bring whether you agree with
[1:03:44] me or not
[1:03:45] i mean you've got to let god reveal it
[1:03:47] to you i can't do it right but i want
[1:03:49] you to understand my terminology
[1:03:52] because that way that's the only way i
[1:03:54] know to bring it all right
[1:03:56] see that he would be son of god
[1:04:00] because that's who he was born
[1:04:03] all right
[1:04:04] he was born son of god
[1:04:06] he was born lord to christ
[1:04:09] all right
[1:04:10] now i know what brother ryan says now
[1:04:11] what's the what's the
[1:04:13] thing now
[1:04:14] he said see our city never called
[1:04:16] himself son of man i mean son of god
[1:04:19] said he always called himself son of man
[1:04:22] then one day he says it like this
[1:04:24] he said you say
[1:04:27] now people were probably quoting him
[1:04:29] back
[1:04:30] to him but he caught their point he said
[1:04:32] you say that he never said he was son of
[1:04:34] god he said oh yes he did
[1:04:39] that he acquired himself to be the son
[1:04:41] of god
[1:04:43] with signs and wonders and things see
[1:04:45] showing us what
[1:04:48] that even though we can take quotes we
[1:04:50] can have 90 quotes of son of man that
[1:04:53] that he never called himself nothing but
[1:04:54] son of man and then you got one where he
[1:04:56] called us the son of god if you don't if
[1:04:58] that won't come together
[1:05:00] then you're gonna have to make him wrong
[1:05:02] in one place
[1:05:04] but who was he
[1:05:05] he was born lord to christ which was the
[1:05:09] son of the living god
[1:05:12] he came on earth in that way but as he
[1:05:14] grows up and growing in grace and
[1:05:17] knowledge and coming out through the
[1:05:18] word you know and to his ministry he
[1:05:22] became then
[1:05:23] under that dispensation
[1:05:26] the son of man
[1:05:30] the son of man because he became the
[1:05:32] word made flesh is what the son of man
[1:05:35] is dealing with are like prophetic
[1:05:37] ministry
[1:05:38] all right
[1:05:40] and so he's dealing then to show us
[1:05:42] where you know the things that we're
[1:05:44] we're to see
[1:05:46] all right
[1:05:47] so we must return back
[1:05:49] i hope you understand what i mean on
[1:05:50] that he must return back in the end time
[1:05:55] and i believe he has so don't say i'm
[1:05:56] looking for somebody to come no no no no
[1:05:59] no
[1:06:00] because everybody knows 1969 in athens
[1:06:03] georgia i preached the message the first
[1:06:06] one ever preached in this message as a
[1:06:08] message quote i used to teach sunday
[1:06:10] school and thing
[1:06:12] but i preached a message and entitled it
[1:06:14] son of man and i proved our and i still
[1:06:16] haven't written in the front of my bible
[1:06:18] i proved there in athens georgia in 1969
[1:06:22] that the bride of jesus christ would be
[1:06:24] the son of man brother adam is a son of
[1:06:26] man part of the body of christ
[1:06:29] so he'll be part of the son of man all
[1:06:32] right you know do you understand what
[1:06:33] i'm saying he he was a son of man
[1:06:37] but yet being part of the body of christ
[1:06:39] made him part of the son of man to be
[1:06:41] fulfilled in the last days through the
[1:06:43] bride of jesus christ so it's a
[1:06:45] wonderful opportunity or a great thing
[1:06:48] to see what we're talking about
[1:06:52] so we read now it's the same god
[1:06:56] he's just changing his form
[1:07:00] all right he didn't understand
[1:07:04] all himself
[1:07:08] and as i always say to you you say well
[1:07:10] how are you god doesn't understand we'll
[1:07:13] explain to me how he don't know my sins
[1:07:17] in order to solve the problem right
[1:07:19] because he don't know my sins if i ask
[1:07:22] him to forgive me
[1:07:24] now you tell me that he don't know that
[1:07:26] i done them things
[1:07:33] is he total amnesia to cut it off
[1:07:36] no the blood covers it right
[1:07:39] and he can't see it right and never will
[1:07:41] be able to see it because it's under the
[1:07:43] blood
[1:07:44] he won't drag it out and like i said
[1:07:46] when brother branham said that one time
[1:07:47] he said somebody has something under the
[1:07:49] blood i can't bring it out under the
[1:07:51] discernment he said because it's under
[1:07:52] the blood and that was that was great to
[1:07:54] me now all right
[1:07:57] see he didn't understand his part
[1:08:00] and
[1:08:02] actually he didn't understand fully his
[1:08:04] part in the coming of of the father's
[1:08:07] strong
[1:08:10] because
[1:08:10] he would have to come now and tell those
[1:08:12] things
[1:08:13] that's what he came to to patmos was to
[1:08:16] tell
[1:08:17] of his part in the father's throne or
[1:08:19] the baptism of the holy ghost down
[1:08:21] through the seven church ages all right
[1:08:23] that would be what he would be coming
[1:08:25] for
[1:08:26] was to show those things all right and
[1:08:29] to show on all the way into the future
[1:08:31] of what's going on harley gave you a
[1:08:33] quote where you could have it
[1:08:35] revelation chapter 1 1960
[1:08:39] 1204
[1:08:42] when our lord was on earth the disciple
[1:08:43] would ask him master will you at this
[1:08:45] time restore the kingdom to back to
[1:08:47] israel jesus said it's not for you to
[1:08:49] know this hour or time
[1:08:51] and no one would know said even the son
[1:08:54] as yet did not know
[1:08:56] but after his death burial and
[1:08:58] resurrection and ascension into glory he
[1:08:59] receives from god the father i mean from
[1:09:02] god the future of the church he returned
[1:09:04] back to brandon's message to the church
[1:09:07] and this message of his coming in the
[1:09:08] condition of his church down through the
[1:09:10] ages he could not do it before his death
[1:09:13] burial and resurrection because he had
[1:09:15] not yet knew it he did not notice he did
[1:09:19] but did you notice the scripture that's
[1:09:21] the revelation god gave to jesus how
[1:09:23] that god the father gave the revelation
[1:09:25] to his son jesus christ and he sent an
[1:09:27] angel to john to signify these things of
[1:09:30] which was which is and which is to come
[1:09:32] all right
[1:09:33] now i know that i've read these a lot
[1:09:36] but just remember there's other people
[1:09:38] listening
[1:09:39] that have not heard what you've heard so
[1:09:42] bear with me while i read some or give
[1:09:45] you some of these things sometimes over
[1:09:47] and two or three sermons
[1:09:49] and repeat them because we're trying our
[1:09:52] best to not pastor the world i'm not
[1:09:54] caring about that but if there's anybody
[1:09:56] out there wants to hear you know a
[1:09:57] sister from india she she listens and
[1:10:00] she'll be listening in as quick as this
[1:10:01] goes through what it has to to get to
[1:10:03] that and she'll be listening in and she
[1:10:06] writes back comments about things and
[1:10:08] and you know and how that the lord has
[1:10:10] blessed her through aaron's message of
[1:10:12] the day she's mentioning it and all
[1:10:14] right well praise god
[1:10:16] you know
[1:10:17] if anybody wants to hear that's all i'm
[1:10:19] doing it for i'm not trying to pastor
[1:10:21] nobody not getting no money out of it's
[1:10:22] costing me
[1:10:25] it's not me you know we're not getting
[1:10:26] nothing back it's costing
[1:10:29] to send these things well there's a lot
[1:10:30] of people and some do send money but
[1:10:32] we've told them over and over don't send
[1:10:34] no money you know all right
[1:10:36] but now let's get on with the message
[1:10:40] see
[1:10:42] now
[1:10:45] here's the part i want to get to
[1:10:51] see then it was revealed
[1:10:54] to jesus christ
[1:10:58] and he brought it to john
[1:11:00] on patmos
[1:11:03] signifying it or bringing it announcing
[1:11:06] it
[1:11:07] by his angel
[1:11:10] that would come and telling the church
[1:11:12] ages and the things
[1:11:14] and not only that would tell him all the
[1:11:16] way through the future
[1:11:17] you know
[1:11:19] about israel about a rapture about
[1:11:21] israel and and things like that you know
[1:11:24] and it will go all the way as i said to
[1:11:26] the future home
[1:11:27] all right now to me
[1:11:31] to me i want to use this when we get
[1:11:32] down to speaking a little bit on
[1:11:34] predestination because to me that's
[1:11:36] what it means in revelation 10 7.
[1:11:40] there's
[1:11:41] the mystery
[1:11:43] of god
[1:11:44] it doesn't say mysteries it says the
[1:11:46] mystery revelation 10 7 it says the
[1:11:49] mystery we see it takes all of the
[1:11:52] mysteries
[1:11:53] to make that mystery
[1:11:56] you understand it takes all of the
[1:11:58] mysteries to make that one mystery
[1:12:00] all right and see that's why it's saying
[1:12:02] it that way and what we're talking about
[1:12:04] of the coming of the son of man to be
[1:12:07] coming in the end time
[1:12:09] back to the church
[1:12:12] is part of that mystery now i won't say
[1:12:15] it but people ain't going to like it but
[1:12:17] most of the people of this message i've
[1:12:19] actually heard very little that's right
[1:12:22] very little now i've heard some from
[1:12:25] brother richard and brothers there and
[1:12:27] all but i'm talking about this very
[1:12:28] little
[1:12:29] that i've heard of them talking about
[1:12:32] why the son of man had to come back
[1:12:37] they just talk about cinnamon right
[1:12:38] around with son of man brother
[1:12:40] and they i've never heard any of them
[1:12:42] say you know outside of brother richard
[1:12:44] and him but that
[1:12:46] that the bride of christ would be
[1:12:49] the son of man have you now i'm just
[1:12:51] honest have you heard them out there no
[1:12:53] we don't hear them out there
[1:12:55] they don't talk about it
[1:12:56] because they don't understand
[1:12:58] all right now i'm not throwing off on it
[1:13:00] it's not my badness
[1:13:03] that's between them and god what god
[1:13:05] reveals to them
[1:13:06] but see my whole point ever since i said
[1:13:09] from 69 up until now what do you think
[1:13:11] about now if i believed in 1969
[1:13:15] that the bride of jesus christ would be
[1:13:17] the word made flesh according to the
[1:13:19] prophet even be the fullness of the
[1:13:21] godhead bodily according to the prophet
[1:13:23] right on unlike uh the unveiling of god
[1:13:26] mighty god unveiled and all and would be
[1:13:29] the son of man made manifest for a short
[1:13:33] period of time upon the earth
[1:13:36] now there's a reason for that
[1:13:40] there is a reason for it to be
[1:13:43] the son of man for a short period of
[1:13:45] time all right now i made it back there
[1:13:48] and i you know that's been enough to
[1:13:50] hold us
[1:13:52] that
[1:13:52] it has to come to that before you can go
[1:13:54] to son of day son of david in the
[1:13:56] millennium but there's more to go with
[1:13:58] the story now that's what we need to
[1:14:00] cover now
[1:14:02] and i've covered it and and spoke upon
[1:14:04] it but
[1:14:05] try to now to get it all together to
[1:14:07] where we can follow it so follow with us
[1:14:10] and study on it
[1:14:12] well brother i don't understand you well
[1:14:13] how many times have you went back to
[1:14:15] listen to the tape
[1:14:16] how many times have you prayed for god
[1:14:18] to reveal it to you
[1:14:25] i mean
[1:14:26] how many times like i said if you went
[1:14:28] back and re-listened
[1:14:29] well i didn't get it then i ain't gonna
[1:14:31] get it again well
[1:14:32] why don't you do the bible that way just
[1:14:33] throw it away because you don't need it
[1:14:35] anyway do you
[1:14:38] oh brother dale you're too sarcastic
[1:14:39] well if that's sarcastic then i don't
[1:14:41] understand what anything else would be
[1:14:43] it's god's honest truth
[1:14:45] how many times have you read the bible
[1:14:47] over over over over over right
[1:14:51] and every time you read it you get more
[1:14:52] out of it don't you how many times you
[1:14:54] listen the prophet's message over over
[1:14:57] over i told you about it from the
[1:14:59] unveiling of god where the lord revealed
[1:15:00] that we listen to that we used to play
[1:15:02] tape going to work every day and coming
[1:15:04] back and we listened to that tape four
[1:15:06] days in a row because nobody didn't take
[1:15:08] an extra one and we listened to the
[1:15:10] unveiling of god
[1:15:13] all right and that meant eight trips you
[1:15:14] know because you're coming back home
[1:15:17] all right
[1:15:18] and i'd sit there with a pencil and turn
[1:15:19] that recorder because the batteries
[1:15:22] would run out and i mean there was like
[1:15:24] 12 of them in there you know so it was
[1:15:26] hard to buy a bunch but anyhow we'd done
[1:15:28] it to do but one day it clicked on me
[1:15:32] son of god son of man son of god son of
[1:15:35] david
[1:15:36] that's the only three sons he comes in
[1:15:39] but you go back and listen to that
[1:15:40] unveiling of god and keep in there and i
[1:15:43] gave you the quote there a moment ago
[1:15:44] where that he comes back see
[1:15:47] as son of man
[1:15:48] so it's son of god
[1:15:50] then he returns back the son of man
[1:15:52] and then he'll go to son of david
[1:15:54] because that's where it started son of
[1:15:56] man son of god son of man son of david
[1:15:59] see how many times do you need to listen
[1:16:00] maybe you need to listen to the services
[1:16:02] over again no
[1:16:05] now there's a key that we need to
[1:16:07] understand
[1:16:09] that i want you to see today
[1:16:11] all right
[1:16:13] because to me now
[1:16:18] the son of man
[1:16:21] was the voice
[1:16:24] that raised lazarus
[1:16:26] amen
[1:16:27] from the dead
[1:16:30] right
[1:16:35] but it was the voice of the son of man
[1:16:40] and i'm not different
[1:16:42] i'm just telling it on down the road
[1:16:44] it's not just the holy spirit
[1:16:46] right it's the voice
[1:16:48] through a man
[1:16:49] which was the holy spirit yes speaking
[1:16:53] all right
[1:16:54] but you see
[1:16:55] the son of man was the voice of the
[1:16:57] resurrection that's right
[1:17:00] that's why jesus had the resurrection
[1:17:03] ministry
[1:17:04] you remember
[1:17:05] as jonah was in the belly of the whale
[1:17:06] three days three nights and then they
[1:17:08] misunderstood it so you know he said
[1:17:10] you'll have this see it's the
[1:17:11] resurrection ministry you're talking
[1:17:13] about
[1:17:15] the son of man was the one that could
[1:17:16] raise the dead amen
[1:17:19] the son of man could heal
[1:17:21] right
[1:17:22] all right
[1:17:23] the son of man could even forgive sins
[1:17:28] like connected to the son of man that we
[1:17:29] nearly need to study a lot
[1:17:31] but i want you to think about it today
[1:17:32] for one thing
[1:17:35] the son of man was the voice of the
[1:17:37] resurrection
[1:17:39] all right
[1:17:40] now that's why brother branham could
[1:17:42] stand
[1:17:43] in the end time
[1:17:45] under
[1:17:46] the son of man ministry
[1:17:49] and say bring me 24 of your worst cases
[1:17:52] and i'll guarantee you healing for every
[1:17:55] one of them
[1:17:56] now where's ever been a man could say
[1:17:58] that
[1:18:01] well was it five or seven people raised
[1:18:04] from the dead in the ministry of brother
[1:18:06] branham
[1:18:10] me
[1:18:10] why because he had the son of man
[1:18:12] ministry
[1:18:14] are you following me
[1:18:17] he had the sign of the resurrection
[1:18:21] because the sign of the resurrection is
[1:18:23] healing
[1:18:26] right
[1:18:28] and the ultimate of healing are raising
[1:18:29] the dead
[1:18:32] but then preaching the gospel to bring
[1:18:35] us to the ultimate of the change of the
[1:18:36] body all right
[1:18:38] now
[1:18:39] that's why i had to come back as son of
[1:18:40] man in the last days and you'll see what
[1:18:42] i'm talking about as we go along so
[1:18:44] right the son of man was the voice of
[1:18:46] the
[1:18:47] resurrection that raised lazarus
[1:18:53] now
[1:18:54] now i know and i can relate backwards
[1:18:56] and forth and go with you and so i'm all
[1:18:58] right but you'll just have to pray i
[1:19:00] know brother rhino will say the son of
[1:19:01] god i know the scripture that even says
[1:19:04] we're brother random quotes that the
[1:19:05] voice of the son of man in this next one
[1:19:08] i know the scripture in john 5 25 where
[1:19:10] it says the son of god
[1:19:13] you'll hear the son of god and be raised
[1:19:15] in the last days
[1:19:16] but just remember the son of god is the
[1:19:19] son of man
[1:19:22] it wasn't two gods
[1:19:24] it was god manifesting himself
[1:19:27] on the earth
[1:19:29] see the lord jesus christ was the son of
[1:19:33] man
[1:19:36] the sign of the messiah
[1:19:38] the resurrection
[1:19:40] amen
[1:19:42] all right and here comes the prophet in
[1:19:43] the end time
[1:19:46] with that same side
[1:19:48] but he says that's got to be in the
[1:19:49] bride
[1:19:51] right well now who you think's going to
[1:19:52] have this come on
[1:19:54] i've told you over and over what it is
[1:19:57] the same ministry of the lord jesus
[1:19:59] christ i believe is in the earth today
[1:20:01] but it's around the world it's not in
[1:20:03] one person it's not to be in one person
[1:20:07] that was in brother branham the
[1:20:09] resurrection sign that was in the lord
[1:20:11] jesus right but that same ministry is
[1:20:13] supposed to be in the bride around the
[1:20:15] world
[1:20:18] all right
[1:20:19] how do we believe that
[1:20:21] but look what he says
[1:20:26] number six on you know paragraph 108
[1:20:30] i have heard but now i see 1965 11 27
[1:20:34] the evening service
[1:20:35] but remember the promised word of god by
[1:20:37] the mouth of jesus christ the very god
[1:20:39] that spoke creation into existence
[1:20:42] it was the one before the foundation of
[1:20:44] the world that spoke the words and let
[1:20:46] there be now who is that the lord jesus
[1:20:48] christ
[1:20:49] i don't want it done that right
[1:20:52] that and there was he said he was in the
[1:20:55] world and the world was made by him and
[1:20:56] the world knew him not but as many as
[1:20:58] did know him to them gave the power
[1:21:01] get them he gave power to become the
[1:21:04] sons of god
[1:21:05] the very creator the very creator
[1:21:07] himself
[1:21:09] when he raised up lazarus from the dead
[1:21:12] listen
[1:21:13] he said this is not strange for the
[1:21:15] hours coming that when all that's in the
[1:21:18] grave will hear the voice of the son of
[1:21:20] man
[1:21:22] and shall come out
[1:21:24] the very god that said let there be said
[1:21:26] the voice of the son of man
[1:21:28] would wake those that are in the grave
[1:21:30] it has to happen in its season he's
[1:21:32] spoken
[1:21:33] all right now here's where we stand see
[1:21:36] we stand on a prophet's message but if
[1:21:38] you're preaching this to a
[1:21:39] denominational world they'll immediately
[1:21:41] jump over and they'll tell you like i
[1:21:43] said they'll tell you over in matthew
[1:21:46] 5 25 which is the scripture brother
[1:21:48] branham is using here to show you that
[1:21:51] this that they would hear
[1:21:54] all right now they're listening that
[1:21:56] they would hear the voice of the son of
[1:21:58] god
[1:22:02] now
[1:22:05] see here's where it's great to have a
[1:22:06] prophet
[1:22:10] because he's the son of man now he
[1:22:12] wouldn't correct in the scripture
[1:22:14] he'll call it son of god
[1:22:17] all right but listen
[1:22:20] if you relate it only to the son of god
[1:22:22] then i'll tell you up front and i'll be
[1:22:24] glad to show you where the prophet says
[1:22:27] that scripture is not talking about
[1:22:30] in other words now or whatever that's
[1:22:32] the end of the world
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:36] that's right that's at the end of the
[1:22:37] world when everybody hears the voice of
[1:22:39] the son of god you know why
[1:22:42] because that's the reason i love it see
[1:22:43] if i can get it correctly now if i miss
[1:22:45] it forgive me but son of man is ruler of
[1:22:47] the earth
[1:22:48] but son of god is ruler of all things
[1:22:51] amen that's right
[1:22:52] i believe that i know that quotes that
[1:22:54] way the son of god is ruler of all times
[1:22:56] see all right so then what would it be
[1:23:01] the son of god would be over there to
[1:23:02] raise everything but the son of man
[1:23:05] is going to be here
[1:23:07] that's right to raise the dead in this
[1:23:09] day
[1:23:12] and it was proved by the prophet's
[1:23:13] ministry of five or seven times or which
[1:23:16] one it is that the dead was
[1:23:18] raised but that's only speaking of the
[1:23:20] resurrection right
[1:23:23] all right that's only speaking of it
[1:23:24] okay
[1:23:25] see
[1:23:27] so we don't remember
[1:23:30] he was in the office of the son of man
[1:23:34] while on earth
[1:23:36] and that office would include the
[1:23:39] voice of the resurrection
[1:23:42] which would be
[1:23:45] able to raise the dead
[1:23:47] the healing of the sick
[1:23:49] that would be why he would be there see
[1:23:51] but the son of god was in the son of man
[1:23:56] that was the voice of the resurrection
[1:23:59] the son of god that was in the son of
[1:24:00] man but he still used the son of man the
[1:24:03] son of man had to bring the dead forth
[1:24:06] why would it be would not be that god
[1:24:08] would just speak out of heaven and did
[1:24:10] raise it
[1:24:12] he's got to have a voice
[1:24:14] all right so follow me
[1:24:18] all right
[1:24:20] see then we know the voice of god
[1:24:25] all right
[1:24:26] son of god
[1:24:28] voice of god
[1:24:30] is the creator god
[1:24:34] right right
[1:24:35] and we know all things were created by
[1:24:37] him john 1 hebrews 1 colossians 1
[1:24:40] and ephesians 3 and 9.
[1:24:42] all things were created by jesus christ
[1:24:46] so we're not leaving off the son of god
[1:24:48] and just running over to a son of man
[1:24:50] that's what people do because they can't
[1:24:52] follow and keep it all together
[1:24:55] remember when he was on earth that son
[1:24:57] of god was standing there in that son of
[1:24:59] man the son of man was the office that
[1:25:01] was being made manifest
[1:25:05] sunshine
[1:25:08] how does that lighten up
[1:25:10] what is it supposed to be fatherhood
[1:25:12] right old testament
[1:25:14] sonship right
[1:25:16] then holy ghost dispensation so where
[1:25:19] was his sonship does that tie with
[1:25:20] adoption
[1:25:23] the word made flesh
[1:25:25] huh see why that you you got so much
[1:25:28] all right but now watch
[1:25:31] so then the lord jesus
[1:25:33] christ while he was on earth here he had
[1:25:35] the voice of the resurrection
[1:25:40] okay
[1:25:42] the son of man had the voice of the
[1:25:44] resurrection
[1:25:48] which would have to be the voice of the
[1:25:49] archangel
[1:25:54] okay
[1:25:56] now we'll get on over to the
[1:25:58] thessalonians where the lord himself
[1:25:59] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:26:00] voice of an archangel
[1:26:04] and the trumpet
[1:26:07] let's tie something together right here
[1:26:09] that we've been on for a while
[1:26:12] and i hope you was been listening to it
[1:26:15] see
[1:26:16] who is this great one in jude 1 and 9
[1:26:19] that says that
[1:26:20] michael
[1:26:23] the archangel
[1:26:28] now listen i know come on just don't
[1:26:30] worry about it get into it if anybody's
[1:26:32] listening that thinks there's you know
[1:26:35] the scripture doesn't call brother uh
[1:26:37] doesn't call the lord jesus christ the
[1:26:39] archangel
[1:26:42] he's called the angel of the covenant
[1:26:44] all et cetera et cetera
[1:26:45] but brother branham calls him the voice
[1:26:48] of the archangel all right so now we
[1:26:50] depend upon what he's saying that that's
[1:26:52] telling us what the scripture is really
[1:26:54] saying
[1:26:54] right
[1:26:57] i just say that's great somebody comes
[1:26:59] along they're listening to you and they
[1:27:00] say well what about this side the other
[1:27:01] they said well boy he picked that out
[1:27:03] for when once i thought of it he said it
[1:27:05] well maybe i ain't claiming discernment
[1:27:07] on this claim problem plains common
[1:27:09] sense
[1:27:10] because that's what it takes
[1:27:12] all right
[1:27:13] so now let's get into something
[1:27:15] in jude 1 and 9 then
[1:27:18] because michael the archangel
[1:27:23] in daniel he's called the chief of
[1:27:25] princes
[1:27:28] he's called your prince
[1:27:30] he's called a great prince michael is
[1:27:34] in the book of daniel
[1:27:36] all right now there's only like the the
[1:27:39] four times it's mentioned and this is
[1:27:40] michael now the word michael's used in
[1:27:41] the bible don't misunderstand me there's
[1:27:43] a lot of kids named michael all right
[1:27:46] but i'm talking about what the use of
[1:27:48] what it's doing but now we know for sure
[1:27:50] what brother random said
[1:27:52] number seven beginning into the gentile
[1:27:54] dispensation to 55 109 evening and at
[1:27:57] that time michael shall stand the great
[1:27:59] prince
[1:28:00] michael was christ of course who fought
[1:28:03] the angelic wars in heaven with the
[1:28:05] devil
[1:28:06] all right now we're going down to christ
[1:28:08] the mystery of god reveal number eight
[1:28:09] sixty three o
[1:28:11] seven twenty eight
[1:28:14] and he says the first thing that lucifer
[1:28:16] done to separate the fellowship of god
[1:28:17] and man he wanted to build him a united
[1:28:19] kingdom of great splendor and seemingly
[1:28:22] more cultural cultured
[1:28:24] a greater kingdom than michael
[1:28:27] christ had
[1:28:29] now
[1:28:30] so michael is christ
[1:28:32] that's why i say satan never did
[1:28:34] understand that
[1:28:37] he was standing there thinking he was
[1:28:39] the number one guy standing beside the
[1:28:41] lord and out comes a pillar of fire
[1:28:45] a halo of light
[1:28:47] or whatever and it goes forth and begins
[1:28:50] to create
[1:28:52] all right
[1:28:53] and that's the fella that he wound up
[1:28:55] not being able to whip
[1:28:57] and like i said now even gabriel is a
[1:29:00] great
[1:29:01] one
[1:29:02] that is to deliver
[1:29:04] the messages
[1:29:06] but yet he couldn't conquer satan
[1:29:09] you know
[1:29:10] right
[1:29:11] see michael had to come to his rescue
[1:29:15] so michael cast him out in the beginning
[1:29:17] and michael will cast him out in the end
[1:29:20] all right
[1:29:20] so then we're not saying that jesus now
[1:29:24] jesus was michael now i didn't say that
[1:29:28] jesus christ is michael
[1:29:34] the christ
[1:29:36] is michael
[1:29:38] all right
[1:29:39] now
[1:29:40] see then in doing that then we've got it
[1:29:42] lined up correctly
[1:29:44] that who is the voice of the archangel
[1:29:47] michael
[1:29:50] which is christ
[1:29:54] all right
[1:29:56] now if we see who christ is
[1:30:00] then we can understand what's going to
[1:30:01] take place in the high states
[1:30:03] all right going pretty slow but
[1:30:09] so we know that
[1:30:12] the one that could raise the dead
[1:30:15] was
[1:30:17] the son of man right
[1:30:22] all right
[1:30:25] the son of man the lord jesus christ
[1:30:28] okay
[1:30:29] and that was michael which is christ
[1:30:34] christ you remember the other week when
[1:30:35] we had it
[1:30:37] week ago
[1:30:38] christ michael is the son of god
[1:30:42] below god's the theophany the thing
[1:30:44] right that's christ that's michael
[1:30:47] he later became flesh and would be known
[1:30:50] as jesus because that would be the name
[1:30:52] of god
[1:30:54] but he's the christ all right
[1:30:57] now
[1:31:00] see then watch what i'm talking about
[1:31:02] see was the voice then michael is the
[1:31:04] voice of the archangel
[1:31:08] which is the voice of the son of man
[1:31:13] all right
[1:31:14] look at number nine on your notes
[1:31:19] because here's where we're going to get
[1:31:20] back to where we are in revelation 4 1.
[1:31:26] laying all that down to get you to see
[1:31:27] who the voice is
[1:31:32] now we read in revelations 4 1
[1:31:34] that he heard a voice
[1:31:38] in heaven
[1:31:39] that said come up
[1:31:42] who was that voice
[1:31:46] it wasn't the angel
[1:31:48] because you're getting too close
[1:31:50] the angel is just telling you what takes
[1:31:52] place
[1:31:58] voice did john hear
[1:32:00] revelation chapter 4 part
[1:32:02] 1
[1:32:04] 1960 12 31
[1:32:06] that same voice said to john come up
[1:32:09] here
[1:32:10] i'll show you some things that's fixing
[1:32:12] to happen
[1:32:13] that same voice that shall sound when
[1:32:16] the dead in christ rise
[1:32:20] now get all of this same voice
[1:32:25] remember it's not the one god
[1:32:30] for the trumpet the trumpet what is the
[1:32:32] trumpet
[1:32:33] the voice of christ
[1:32:35] the one who shouted and summoned him up
[1:32:38] he heard the voice like a trumpet sound
[1:32:41] and said come up hither
[1:32:44] see how the resurrection will be
[1:32:50] i'm reading it it'll be in a moment in
[1:32:52] the twinkling of an eye that clear
[1:32:54] astounding voice and he summons the
[1:32:57] church calling
[1:32:58] come out of it
[1:33:00] that great summons and voice
[1:33:03] all right
[1:33:08] number 10 revelations chapter 4 part 2
[1:33:11] 24 elders 61 101
[1:33:15] is after that mean that
[1:33:18] after meant that after the church had
[1:33:20] you deceased john was summons to come up
[1:33:22] higher come up higher hither
[1:33:25] which means come up here he showed him
[1:33:27] all that was going to happen in the
[1:33:28] world of the church age
[1:33:31] then after the church ages was over we
[1:33:33] find then that john was a type of ever
[1:33:36] true believer
[1:33:38] that will be summoned by christ on high
[1:33:40] that right summon come up hither
[1:33:44] and we find out that the voice that
[1:33:46] spoke to him was the voice of a trumpet
[1:33:49] clear distinctly
[1:33:52] now what's he
[1:33:55] and it was the same voice that spoke to
[1:33:57] him here on earth
[1:34:02] now that's two things the man that was
[1:34:04] talking to him while he was going
[1:34:06] through his ministry but you'll get it
[1:34:08] in just a minute what he's talking about
[1:34:09] on earth because he's on earth when
[1:34:12] he sees revelations 1 10.
[1:34:17] okay
[1:34:19] as long as he was in the midst of the
[1:34:21] seven candlesticks so now is where we
[1:34:23] are
[1:34:25] where's he at
[1:34:27] he was speaking to or from
[1:34:29] oh i like that speaking from the
[1:34:31] candlesticks
[1:34:33] see he was in the candlestick speaking
[1:34:35] from them to his church then when the
[1:34:37] church ages seized he left the earth and
[1:34:39] moved up into the heavens and called his
[1:34:41] redeemed up with him oh isn't that
[1:34:43] beautiful
[1:34:44] it just makes me my heart jump
[1:34:49] and where'd he hear the voice
[1:34:51] he heard a voice to call him up into
[1:34:53] heaven right for one
[1:34:55] this is the same voice that he heard
[1:34:57] while he was on earth
[1:34:59] which is in the church ages part of
[1:35:00] revelations 1 10 because we prove as
[1:35:02] we're going down
[1:35:04] we heard a voice behind him
[1:35:08] revelations chapter 4 part 3 throne of
[1:35:10] mercy thrown mercy
[1:35:12] 61 108. then we find out here after
[1:35:15] these things he heard a voice was
[1:35:16] speaking to him what was it the spirit
[1:35:19] left the earth after these things starts
[1:35:21] out the first chapter or the first verse
[1:35:24] after this i looked and behold a door
[1:35:25] was open in heaven revelation 4 1 after
[1:35:28] the church is gone then a door was open
[1:35:30] and we went through all of that and
[1:35:32] found that that was that that was christ
[1:35:35] was the door
[1:35:37] and the same voice that was walking in
[1:35:39] the midst of the seven golden
[1:35:41] candlesticks also was the same voice he
[1:35:44] heard in heaven saying come up hither
[1:35:47] john went up it represented church going
[1:35:49] in the rapture
[1:35:51] all right
[1:35:53] number 12.
[1:35:58] revelation chapter 4 part 1 16 12 31
[1:36:03] the same voice that someone john come up
[1:36:06] the same voice that said to john come up
[1:36:08] is the same voice that'll summon the
[1:36:10] church someday amen someone's the church
[1:36:14] all right now you follow me
[1:36:16] the voice that calls him up into heaven
[1:36:19] is the voice that spoke to him on earth
[1:36:21] now we're going to find out in a minute
[1:36:22] that that voice would be the same voice
[1:36:25] as i said a compound which would be the
[1:36:27] voice that called john and told him to
[1:36:28] turn around
[1:36:31] well you don't have the word john there
[1:36:33] no but i got the word charlie
[1:36:36] and he said charlie the voice that told
[1:36:38] you to turn around his voice was called
[1:36:39] you one day and tell you to come up
[1:36:41] all right which is charlie cox okay
[1:36:45] now watch
[1:36:46] so now what are you dealing with
[1:36:49] the same voice that someone john come up
[1:36:50] the same voice that said to john come up
[1:36:52] he's the same voice that'll summons the
[1:36:54] church someday amen summons the church
[1:36:57] so what are you looking for brother dale
[1:36:59] i'm looking for
[1:37:01] the same voice that called me
[1:37:04] to tell me to come up
[1:37:06] all right now he called me here on earth
[1:37:09] and john was here on earth remember in
[1:37:11] revelations one
[1:37:13] he was still on that part
[1:37:15] now this all saw the same voice that
[1:37:17] summoned john to come up it's the same
[1:37:18] voice that summoned dead lazarus out of
[1:37:21] the grave
[1:37:23] that same voice of the archangel
[1:37:26] christ is the voice of the archangel
[1:37:30] voice of the archangel oh that trumpet
[1:37:33] voice of christ summoned john to come up
[1:37:35] the same voice summoned lazarus did you
[1:37:37] notice that the graves of lazarus he
[1:37:39] spoke with a loud voice not just said in
[1:37:41] other words he imitated it in his
[1:37:43] weakness not saying that's what lazarus
[1:37:46] come forth it summoned him from the dead
[1:37:49] all right
[1:37:51] it's the loud voice
[1:37:52] but it's all the same isn't it
[1:37:55] okay
[1:37:57] all the same
[1:37:59] look
[1:38:00] revelations chapter 4 part 2
[1:38:04] uh 24 elders 61 101
[1:38:08] that's the same thing that takes place
[1:38:09] right here
[1:38:11] the church was taken up into heaven and
[1:38:12] john now that's john you know and john
[1:38:15] now is brought up with it as a type of
[1:38:17] the resurrected
[1:38:20] so you gotta have the resurrection
[1:38:21] before the church going to rapture right
[1:38:24] come on you understand what i'm saying
[1:38:27] john was taken up it doesn't mention
[1:38:28] resurrection in the scriptures
[1:38:31] but it's all got to be the same right
[1:38:34] and find out the same voices summoning
[1:38:35] him to look back on earth
[1:38:38] was the same voice that summoned him to
[1:38:40] come up
[1:38:42] and every christian you know all right
[1:38:44] so you understand
[1:38:45] every christian
[1:38:47] that means you write your name there you
[1:38:49] know write it down there you know
[1:38:51] all right write dick addison you know
[1:38:52] right
[1:38:53] all right
[1:38:57] and every christian the very voice
[1:38:58] charlie that summons you one day down
[1:39:00] there in kentucky to turn around
[1:39:03] is the same voice that'll summons you
[1:39:06] come up
[1:39:08] now
[1:39:09] what was the voice that told him to turn
[1:39:10] around his salvation right
[1:39:13] in other words when it saved jesus one's
[1:39:15] going to call you up where are you
[1:39:16] looking for the voice to come from
[1:39:20] aren't you glad of that brother evans
[1:39:22] the voice that said turn around same
[1:39:24] voice said come up oh my there are what
[1:39:26] are summons
[1:39:27] what a really what a reality clear
[1:39:29] distinct like a trumpet
[1:39:31] turn around
[1:39:33] serve me
[1:39:34] come up to where i am did you see how
[1:39:36] you split that turn around and serve me
[1:39:38] that's your salvation come up to where i
[1:39:40] am all right
[1:39:42] now
[1:39:43] so there was where he was
[1:39:46] and it's the same voice that called you
[1:39:49] because it's the voice of the lord jesus
[1:39:50] christ
[1:39:52] and jesus christ is the archangel and
[1:39:54] michael is the archangel right so can
[1:39:55] you see that michael is christ
[1:40:01] it's the way that he's being used or
[1:40:02] what is being done
[1:40:04] when once we leave out of here he'll go
[1:40:06] back to israel right right who's going
[1:40:07] to israel michael who will that be
[1:40:10] christ
[1:40:13] jesus the human flesh doesn't stand and
[1:40:15] talk to israel in the tribulation
[1:40:18] he's through two witnesses
[1:40:21] they meet him in the millennium
[1:40:25] now revelation chapter 4 part 1 16
[1:40:29] 12 31 the voice was the same that walked
[1:40:32] into seven golden candlesticks same
[1:40:34] voice
[1:40:35] the voice didn't change
[1:40:37] but the voice were it was when he heard
[1:40:39] it
[1:40:40] the first time and he remembers
[1:40:43] where's john here at the first time and
[1:40:44] i talked about the salvation
[1:40:46] in the first church age
[1:40:48] behind him i was in the spirit on the
[1:40:50] lord's day revelations 1 10 in the
[1:40:52] spirit and went to put that down to
[1:40:54] revelation 1 10 and 13. i was in the
[1:40:57] spirit on the lord's day and i heard
[1:40:58] behind me as a voice of a trumpet
[1:41:00] sounded like many waters now he's tying
[1:41:02] many waters because that many waters is
[1:41:04] not mentioned in revelations 10.
[1:41:09] now he's coming this many waters maybe
[1:41:11] it might be in revelation 10 let me look
[1:41:12] at it
[1:41:14] i mean revelations 1 10.
[1:41:16] i better correct myself
[1:41:20] no he said i was in the spirit on the
[1:41:21] lord's day and heard behind me a boy
[1:41:23] great voice as of a trumpet then later
[1:41:25] on it called it the voice of the of the
[1:41:27] people which is a voice of many waters
[1:41:29] so now brother around tying it all
[1:41:31] together all right
[1:41:32] so now watch it
[1:41:34] he showed him all the mystery of the
[1:41:35] seven children candlesticks holding the
[1:41:37] seven stars and the white wig on and so
[1:41:39] forth to feet like bryson then you heard
[1:41:41] the same voice watch speaking from
[1:41:42] heaven and he looked up and he saw an
[1:41:44] open door oh and open door into heaven
[1:41:47] how do you get in i crossed that one
[1:41:49] door one way no other way all right
[1:41:54] revelation chapter 4 part 1 61 12 31
[1:41:58] paragraph 109 that was paragraph 102
[1:42:01] right above there
[1:42:02] now after the church edges were over and
[1:42:04] everything was come ready
[1:42:06] made ready the setting of the fourth
[1:42:08] chapter here the church ages were done
[1:42:11] he had done left the earth you see
[1:42:13] remember the voice that spoke to him
[1:42:15] behind him in the seven golden
[1:42:17] candlesticks
[1:42:18] the word was finished and now that same
[1:42:20] voice was speaking up in heaven what was
[1:42:23] it he had done redeemed his people his
[1:42:26] earthly work was finished and he was in
[1:42:27] glory calling to john
[1:42:29] come up hither amen that makes me feel
[1:42:32] like shouts come up here
[1:42:36] all right
[1:42:37] now
[1:42:42] michael
[1:42:44] christ
[1:42:46] voice of the archangel
[1:42:49] same voice as in revelation 1. what do
[1:42:52] you think we'll get over revelation 10.
[1:42:54] you know what brother around makes that
[1:42:55] as plain as can be and people have
[1:42:56] argued ever since i've been to mexico
[1:42:59] where he stands with one foot on land
[1:43:01] and one on the sea and raised his hand
[1:43:03] and brought around and said that's
[1:43:04] exactly the same as revelation 1 13.
[1:43:08] the one standing in the midst of the
[1:43:09] seven golden candlestick like on the son
[1:43:10] of man and people's trying to figure out
[1:43:12] what that is happening over there
[1:43:14] because you see for a week we can't be
[1:43:16] over in revelations 10 1.
[1:43:20] if you're in revelation 10 1 you've
[1:43:22] missed a rat shot
[1:43:24] because the rapture is revelation 4 1.
[1:43:27] and from 4 1 to 19 about 21 or somewhere
[1:43:31] i i'll give you exactly brother and said
[1:43:33] that's israel
[1:43:34] right
[1:43:35] yes well brother dale revelations 10 i
[1:43:37] know i've been through that with
[1:43:38] ministry
[1:43:40] it says in the days of the voice of the
[1:43:42] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:43:44] sound
[1:43:45] that's right
[1:43:47] but just remember this message is what's
[1:43:49] going to israel
[1:43:51] but brother branham will go to israel
[1:43:54] so it's got to have that meaning to it
[1:43:56] okay let's bring it on over tight
[1:43:58] together for a minute and quit
[1:44:01] number 16 on your notes the rapture
[1:44:02] 1965-1204
[1:44:05] in the first thing that is the sounding
[1:44:07] this is this is first thessalonians
[1:44:09] right the lord himself shall descend
[1:44:10] from heaven the shout voice of an
[1:44:11] archangel and trumpet now this voice of
[1:44:13] the archangel has got to be the same
[1:44:14] voice of the archangel
[1:44:16] that raised lazarus
[1:44:19] got to be the one that called john
[1:44:23] or how many archangels have you gotten
[1:44:24] what are you dealing with
[1:44:27] but if you see christ and all of that
[1:44:28] then you can understand
[1:44:31] voice was shouted then a voice and then
[1:44:33] a trumpet what
[1:44:34] shout a messenger getting the people
[1:44:36] ready
[1:44:37] the second is a voice of the
[1:44:39] resurrection
[1:44:40] what the same voice that a loud voice in
[1:44:44] saint john
[1:44:45] 11 38 and 44 that caused lazarus from
[1:44:49] the grave
[1:44:52] same voice
[1:44:56] whose own says getting the bride
[1:44:57] together because it's the forces of
[1:44:58] resurrection which is the voice of the
[1:44:59] message
[1:45:00] getting the bride together that's why
[1:45:01] brother around had the resurrection
[1:45:03] ministry
[1:45:05] he had to have
[1:45:06] so the lord himself descends from heaven
[1:45:08] with a shout voice of an archangel
[1:45:11] all right
[1:45:12] now
[1:45:15] raptured
[1:45:16] 1965-1204 program 164. therefore the
[1:45:20] message calls the bride together the
[1:45:21] shout and the trumpet the same morning
[1:45:23] with a loud voice
[1:45:25] he screamed out with that shout
[1:45:28] in other words jesus screamed out with a
[1:45:31] shout
[1:45:32] and and voice and woke lazarus
[1:45:36] it was jesus's message
[1:45:38] his voice that's what i was saying there
[1:45:40] while ago it's not to just say holy
[1:45:41] spirit
[1:45:42] it was the voice of the son of man
[1:45:46] amen the holy spirit using the man to
[1:45:49] speak
[1:45:51] but not to just say the holy spirit
[1:45:53] because that would just put it as a
[1:45:54] it could speak anywhere but it can't
[1:45:56] speak anywhere
[1:45:57] that's why we're going to get to it
[1:45:58] later on these days and you'll see that
[1:46:00] soul of god was not back in the old
[1:46:02] testament made manifest
[1:46:05] it was there
[1:46:07] and it was being made partially manifest
[1:46:11] but nobody in the old testament had it
[1:46:15] you got adam and eve and then you come
[1:46:16] on down
[1:46:18] all right
[1:46:19] voice that wakes up the sleeping dead
[1:46:23] amen
[1:46:25] that's going to be in the end time
[1:46:27] rapture paragraph 130 65 1204 jesus does
[1:46:32] all three of them when he he's descended
[1:46:34] a shout what is a shout is a message
[1:46:36] going forth
[1:46:37] first the living bread of the living of
[1:46:40] the life bringing forth
[1:46:42] god has a way of doing things he never
[1:46:45] changes his policy
[1:46:47] so what it's going to be in the end time
[1:46:52] there would have to be a message
[1:46:54] brought by
[1:46:56] the son of man
[1:46:59] not brought around him now the son of
[1:47:01] man amen
[1:47:03] using a son of man to bring his word
[1:47:06] using the very lips and everything
[1:47:08] because you've got to have the lips
[1:47:09] you've got to have the connection to the
[1:47:11] son of man see that's the point i'm
[1:47:12] trying to get in a hurry
[1:47:13] all right
[1:47:15] now the next one is a repeat
[1:47:17] which is number 12 and just get the
[1:47:19] point john summoned him to come up he
[1:47:21] said the same voice that summoned john
[1:47:23] is the same voice that someone did
[1:47:24] lazarus out of the grave the same voice
[1:47:26] of the archangel christ is the voice of
[1:47:28] the archangel voice of the archangel and
[1:47:31] that trumpet voice
[1:47:32] of christ summoned john to come up so it
[1:47:34] will also do the same thing in the end
[1:47:36] time okay
[1:47:38] now
[1:47:40] you know the next one down there 340 of
[1:47:42] the church age book where under her
[1:47:44] messenger the bride will be the final
[1:47:46] voice amen to the final age
[1:47:49] because she's going to be the son of man
[1:47:51] she will be decent a man right
[1:47:54] she won't be a son of man right now
[1:47:56] we're going to get on something this
[1:47:57] evening to really open that up i hope
[1:47:59] she's going to beat this on a man that's
[1:48:00] why mary was not the seed
[1:48:04] she was a carrier
[1:48:06] mary represented associate street
[1:48:08] pentecost
[1:48:11] but it's got to be the same all right
[1:48:14] now follow me just a second
[1:48:19] so then what are we looking at
[1:48:24] the son of man was the voice of the
[1:48:26] resurrection
[1:48:29] call the dead out of the ground
[1:48:34] release the life of god
[1:48:37] to be able to come back upon the church
[1:48:39] in the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:48:42] to be the son of god
[1:48:43] to live through the seven church ages
[1:48:45] right in the end of the seventh church
[1:48:47] age you would begin to see him appearing
[1:48:49] as in speaking of the son of man and the
[1:48:52] son of the son of man would be coming
[1:48:54] back into view
[1:48:55] through brother brown
[1:48:57] which was the sign of the lord jesus
[1:48:58] christ
[1:49:00] he had the same ministry the lord jesus
[1:49:02] christ had right raised the dead healed
[1:49:04] the sick cast out devil now it wasn't
[1:49:06] brother branham right come on
[1:49:09] it was god fulfilling his word
[1:49:12] because he said in the in the days when
[1:49:14] the son of man would be revealed
[1:49:17] we'll get on some more this evening on
[1:49:18] that
[1:49:19] not these not the no the angels not the
[1:49:22] son of man brother and said it anointed
[1:49:24] one's the end time
[1:49:26] he said the son of man is god in other
[1:49:28] words jesus christ
[1:49:31] but you see it's happened down through
[1:49:32] the ages to bring it back to work that
[1:49:35] the resurrection can come
[1:49:39] and the resurrection can come in the end
[1:49:41] time and it'll be the bride that would
[1:49:42] be calling for it
[1:49:44] because what is it hebrews 4 hebrews 11
[1:49:48] 40
[1:49:49] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:49:54] so everybody even brother branham is
[1:49:56] sitting waiting on us
[1:50:00] waiting on the bride to become the word
[1:50:01] made flesh
[1:50:03] we got a great job ahead of us
[1:50:05] and the bride will have then the
[1:50:07] ministry of jesus christ which she will
[1:50:09] be christ made manifest in the last
[1:50:11] quote i gave you the scripture speaks of
[1:50:13] the on the groom speaks of the bride
[1:50:16] so all right so in the end time it will
[1:50:18] be the son of man the lord jesus christ
[1:50:21] making himself manifest upon earth
[1:50:24] through the bride that the prophet has
[1:50:26] brought the message to us and without
[1:50:29] him bringing the message to us
[1:50:31] we would not be able to understand that
[1:50:33] simple
[1:50:36] but he's part of the body of christ
[1:50:39] so he'll be part of that where the
[1:50:41] prophet said that the bride will be the
[1:50:43] fullness of the godhead bodily and raise
[1:50:46] the dead that there'll be a voice come
[1:50:47] forth then we'll raise the dead and
[1:50:49] we'll go into rapture
[1:50:54] the voice of the archangel
[1:50:58] the lord himself shall descend from
[1:50:59] endless shout message right
[1:51:02] voice of the archangel
[1:51:06] the word the son of man in the bride he
[1:51:09] said well how in the world can we ever
[1:51:10] become that
[1:51:13] because god promised it
[1:51:17] that's the only way
[1:51:20] you want me to give you about a
[1:51:21] 50-something quote where brother branham
[1:51:23] i have these my brother ryan says you
[1:51:25] are the word made flesh
[1:51:27] that's it
[1:51:29] we see everybody think oh no no we're
[1:51:30] not are you born again
[1:51:35] if you're born again you're a child of
[1:51:37] god
[1:51:38] you have eternal life
[1:51:40] right
[1:51:43] but the growth development brings you up
[1:51:45] through the stature of a perfect man
[1:51:47] bringing it out to adoption
[1:51:50] where he can pour in his fullness
[1:51:53] and raise the dead and we'll go into
[1:51:54] rapture
[1:51:56] it's all in me and you
[1:51:58] because it's michael christ
[1:52:04] who's fighting for israel michael well
[1:52:06] who's going to fight for the bride
[1:52:08] well now it's michael over there but
[1:52:10] it's christ over here see
[1:52:12] how many gods you got
[1:52:16] what are you talking about
[1:52:19] i'm talking about the same god made
[1:52:21] manifest in many different forms
[1:52:24] that once he was brought jehovah in the
[1:52:26] old testament fatherhood
[1:52:28] then he came into the sonship
[1:52:32] and under that sonship he was the son of
[1:52:34] god
[1:52:35] born the son of god
[1:52:37] he became the son of man which he became
[1:52:40] the word made flesh
[1:52:43] he grown grace and knowledge into the
[1:52:45] position he was the word made flesh
[1:52:50] he was the word 13 years old or
[1:52:52] something correct in those people but
[1:52:54] then he became the word and his fullness
[1:52:56] made flesh why because he didn't know
[1:52:58] everything
[1:53:01] if he did why did it say he learned or
[1:53:03] grew in grace and knowledge
[1:53:06] but you see
[1:53:08] the bride of jesus christ is going to be
[1:53:10] the voice of the resurrection let me
[1:53:11] quote that correctly vern you know
[1:53:13] because that's where the arguable way
[1:53:15] the man did it says on that quote 340 of
[1:53:17] the church age book under her messenger
[1:53:20] she will be the final voice to the final
[1:53:22] age well that's what the quote says
[1:53:25] but see people think it's oh you you're
[1:53:27] trying to make it
[1:53:29] well
[1:53:29] the brother branham is part of the body
[1:53:31] of christ amen
[1:53:33] i'm trying to make him what he is
[1:53:36] amen
[1:53:37] he was the one god used but he was part
[1:53:40] of the body of christ he's not outside
[1:53:41] the body is he
[1:53:43] of course that's what they're saying now
[1:53:44] all about this is christmas trees and
[1:53:46] things like that that brother random
[1:53:47] could have a christmas tree because he
[1:53:49] was in another age
[1:53:52] we we can't have one because we're over
[1:53:54] here in a different age now you got your
[1:53:56] messenger in one age and you and another
[1:53:58] one that's about as much garbage as i
[1:53:59] know
[1:54:01] and i'm sorry but that's just about as
[1:54:03] much garbage as i could recognize
[1:54:04] anywhere how can you have your messenger
[1:54:06] in another age
[1:54:13] but you know this messenger is waiting
[1:54:15] on you and i right
[1:54:17] god is waiting on you and i
[1:54:20] as jesus growed in grace and knowledge i
[1:54:22] thought that's what we talked about the
[1:54:23] statue of perfect man with us growing in
[1:54:25] grace and knowledge
[1:54:27] out to adoption let's stand together
