[11:55] i got to welcome visitor wrote me a
[11:57] whole bunch of notes this morning
[11:58] and everything trying to get it uh right
[12:02] uh we've all you've had the voting and
[12:05] everything's in order
[12:06] see we are set up that we have to vote
[12:11] on the things because the way our church
[12:13] is set up with the government
[12:15] you say well what are you voting for a
[12:17] pastor said brother brown said there for
[12:19] life well that's true
[12:21] but in the state of georgia we have to
[12:23] vote
[12:24] to be able to keep our our church
[12:27] running in the order that we do
[12:29] and all of having it in that order so we
[12:31] vote and it's technically really just
[12:34] for the pastor but it has to be a vote
[12:36] situation i wanted some time to explain
[12:38] that because people say
[12:39] well what are they voting for brother
[12:41] dale is he you know
[12:43] he just we have to do things according
[12:45] to that all right so remember those
[12:47] things
[12:48] uh we have
[12:51] an order starting this year and things
[12:54] are getting
[12:55] we are going to make a few little
[12:58] not changes but we're going to put
[13:02] in order kind of a little situation to
[13:05] work
[13:05] that things can be handled a little
[13:07] better all right brother joe
[13:09] handles the computer in he's tops on the
[13:12] computer
[13:13] line up and we're going to tell brother
[13:15] anderson we haven't talked to him but
[13:18] he's hearing it on internet
[13:20] he will be an aide to brother joe and
[13:23] they'll be working the computer end
[13:25] of everything and handling that part
[13:28] then richard and
[13:33] josh they are in on the basis of
[13:37] keeping up the computers built up doing
[13:39] doing wiring et cetera et cetera
[13:42] and doing that and we're putting richard
[13:44] into the basis of one thing
[13:46] that he will be uh in charge of
[13:50] or in other words would be the
[13:51] purchasing agent for what is needed for
[13:54] the computer end et cetera et cetera
[13:56] all that's into that order terrence will
[13:58] be in charge of like outside because he
[14:01] does a lot of the
[14:02] the work and the things but the building
[14:05] uh
[14:05] doing and what will be handled by
[14:07] terrence so we're seeing see what we're
[14:09] doing we're putting in two purchasing
[14:10] agents
[14:11] that are not overflowing each other and
[14:14] to do
[14:14] but we're saying it this way now if you
[14:16] come up to anything
[14:18] it was you just come up and you could go
[14:20] to one or do that
[14:22] from now on you have to go through
[14:25] if it's something out of not a not a
[14:27] piece of paper
[14:29] not of things there is points that lisa
[14:31] takes care of all of the
[14:33] buying of you know necessities etc
[14:37] and doing those things but terrence and
[14:38] then will be in charge of the building
[14:41] and in charge of the computer system in
[14:43] other words we need a new computer
[14:45] uh you have to go to richard and richard
[14:47] says okay
[14:48] we've got to go and we've got to contact
[14:50] the
[14:51] trustees to let them know what we're
[14:53] doing
[14:54] on to that because we're trying to put
[14:56] some things in order
[14:58] to where that it won't be just left well
[15:00] we don't know who's in charge of what
[15:02] well see now if you're thinking about
[15:04] something in the computer inn
[15:06] your purchasing agent is richard you're
[15:08] thinking about something well we need a
[15:09] new window we need a new door
[15:11] then you go to terrence because that
[15:13] purchasing agent is on to that point
[15:15] so you don't go to lisa and tell her
[15:18] about it you
[15:19] you go to these and they will take care
[15:22] of that and transfer it on
[15:24] and everything so uh you know
[15:27] uh okay uh
[15:30] i believe that's all of it
[15:34] i hope it is anyway if isn't it we'll
[15:36] take care of it later
[15:37] and come up and announce it somewhere
[15:39] but we're trying to put everything to
[15:41] the basis that somebody's in charge
[15:45] then if you get what you want you've got
[15:47] to go to the person in charge
[15:49] because the way it is now it just slides
[15:51] in and out and goes backwards and forth
[15:53] and then
[15:54] and two while we're at it we will be
[15:56] going in this year
[15:58] we wind up a lot of times in having uh
[16:01] special meetings for the church
[16:04] and when we have a special meeting for
[16:06] the church
[16:08] like the valentine that's coming up see
[16:10] then
[16:11] nobody else is invited to come because
[16:14] that's the church
[16:16] but you must be a tithe-paying member of
[16:18] the church to be qualified
[16:20] for those situations you know because
[16:23] that's
[16:24] the prophet said the the tithe payers is
[16:27] what
[16:27] in other words they're the ones that's
[16:29] doing it it ought to go through them
[16:31] so then you won't be able to just come
[16:33] up and say well i want to come to this
[16:34] or i want to invite my uncle
[16:36] to come no when it's for the church now
[16:40] like christmas valentine
[16:44] things which will be the valentine is
[16:46] for the couples of the church
[16:50] husbands and wives see valentine couples
[16:53] of the church
[16:55] that are tithe payers let's see that way
[16:58] then it's up to you whether or not
[17:00] you're a taxpayer
[17:01] that's the one thing i've always because
[17:03] i don't like to talk about tithing i
[17:05] remember that i laughed about it but
[17:07] i had never preached on tithing and boyd
[17:09] helm
[17:10] uh invited his daddy to come and he told
[17:13] his daddy he said
[17:14] one thing brother dale don't never do is
[17:15] preach on money
[17:17] he don't preach on tithing or nothing
[17:19] like that well that very service that
[17:21] his daddy came
[17:24] i preached on tithing for the first time
[17:26] in my life i guess
[17:28] but i preached on tithing of your time
[17:30] your talents
[17:32] your money your everything you know
[17:34] priesthood in one thing
[17:35] and uh boyd said he went out and said oh
[17:38] he don't never preach on money huh
[17:40] well see then we put everything in order
[17:43] to try to do it if you don't understand
[17:46] then ask us and we will try to explain
[17:49] it because that's what we're trying to
[17:50] do
[17:51] see we wind up giving a lot of money
[17:53] away a lot of times
[17:55] and in doing that people just come up
[17:57] and stick their hand out well
[17:59] if you're not a title player don't
[18:00] expect to get anything back
[18:03] now we're not talking about kids we're
[18:06] talking about
[18:06] adults that are capable of working
[18:10] and tithe players kids you don't want to
[18:12] come up and say well okay
[18:14] uh you know lily back there how much
[18:17] time does she get
[18:19] but i do like to know that times that
[18:21] some of the kids i've known this for
[18:23] years
[18:24] you know some of the kids they get paid
[18:27] for something they'll come up and pay
[18:28] their tithe
[18:31] you know i like that because that means
[18:34] that they're concerned
[18:36] all right i hope everybody gets if you
[18:38] don't get it and i didn't put it plain
[18:39] enough we'll make it again
[18:41] my life one time we had a situation here
[18:43] and this old
[18:44] baptist preacher used to come in every
[18:46] once in a while and see us you know and
[18:48] visit with us
[18:49] really want to come preach but anyhow
[18:51] he'd come down every once in a while
[18:52] live right up here
[18:54] and uh he came in and we had a situation
[18:58] well he was
[19:01] so sure enough he missed about two
[19:05] months
[19:06] well you know what some people thought i
[19:08] wasn't plain enough about what i said
[19:11] so that day i picked that day and i
[19:14] brought the things up and uh
[19:16] and went right back through the same
[19:18] thing word for word that i had done the
[19:20] two or three weeks or months or before
[19:22] and there he's setting
[19:24] i bet he had a wonderful idea as a
[19:26] matter of fact i don't think he ever
[19:27] came back
[19:28] he probably thought man that guy's mean
[19:30] is a rattlesnake and
[19:32] all of that but but that's doing okay
[19:35] all right if you'd like turn in your
[19:36] scriptures i hope we got everything
[19:38] playing on that part
[19:46] for the day brother danny is sick
[19:50] back always back okay all right too did
[19:52] you i didn't hear it in there
[19:54] uh how many of you remember betty
[19:56] cunningham
[19:58] she was our piano player for probably
[20:01] 10 years i guess i don't know really in
[20:04] the beginning and she
[20:06] passed away yesterday is that right
[20:10] today two weeks ago well y'all late
[20:14] getting me the message
[20:15] that's uh there you go because we always
[20:18] thought to world of sister betty and
[20:20] bill
[20:21] and all and they was with us for years
[20:23] and then but they
[20:24] went back she went to a nursing on
[20:26] assisted living
[20:27] you know and was there doing that but
[20:29] she passed away so remember
[20:31] to pray for the you know i don't know
[20:33] how many's in the family or whatever but
[20:35] she was they were with us they were
[20:37] actually ones of the first ones
[20:39] that started this building in the
[20:42] services you know and coming here
[20:44] with daddy and bill okay but we just
[20:46] pray the lord would bless the families
[20:48] on each side
[20:49] all right lord jesus we thank you for
[20:52] your grace and your love we thank you
[20:54] for all things
[20:55] and we just ask you now to help us lord
[20:57] and let what little bit we've said be
[21:00] enough to help us understand
[21:02] how that we have to operate sometimes
[21:05] according to different things by the the
[21:08] laws and the situations and all
[21:10] we have to do those things because
[21:12] they're not
[21:14] taking anything away from us we'll just
[21:16] be do that ourselves
[21:18] we we thank you father and we ask you to
[21:20] just be with us now bless the
[21:22] the families that are of the of betty
[21:24] and all we don't know how many of them
[21:25] would still be living or whatever

[21:32] we ask you to be with us here in the
[21:34] service today have your way
[21:35] that your love may be with each one in
[21:38] jesus name
[21:39] all right our scriptures is second
[21:42] corinthians
[21:44] 5 16 through 19 and colossians 2
[21:48] 6 through 9. okay
[21:51] we've changed our topic if you noticed
[21:54] we haven't announced you know and
[21:56] we've been on one topic for 10 services
[21:59] so we're going now into further look so
[22:02] let's go to second corinthians
[22:06] 5 16.
[22:09] wherefore henceforth know we know man
[22:12] after the flesh
[22:14] yea though we have known christ now
[22:17] remember this is
[22:17] this is paul talking but he's relating
[22:20] to the rest of them because he never
[22:22] probably ever met christ but
[22:24] anyhow what he's saying no we know man
[22:26] after the flesh
[22:28] yea though we have known christ after
[22:30] the flesh
[22:31] yet now henceforth no we him no more
[22:35] what if to the flesh
[22:38] we know him no more after the flesh
[22:42] all right because we know him in spirit
[22:43] right because that's what it's saying
[22:44] here
[22:45] therefore if any man be in christ he's a
[22:47] new creature
[22:48] old things are passed away behold all
[22:50] things are become new
[22:52] and all things are of god who hath
[22:55] reconciled
[22:56] us to himself by jesus christ and
[22:59] watched now and hath given to us the
[23:01] ministry of reconciliation
[23:04] it's given to the church what you buying
[23:07] what you lose
[23:08] all right are we in the scripture all
[23:11] right
[23:12] given to us the ministry of
[23:13] reconciliation to wit to understand
[23:16] i know you can you witness you can do
[23:18] that but to understand that god was in
[23:21] christ
[23:22] reconciling the world unto himself not
[23:24] imputing their trespasses unto them
[23:26] and hath committed unto us the word of
[23:29] reconciliation
[23:30] to the bride see for us now then we are
[23:34] ambassadors of christ as though god did
[23:37] beseech you by us we pray you in christ
[23:40] said be ye
[23:41] reconciled to god okay let's go over to
[23:45] colossians 2. we'll pick up verse
[23:50] 6
[23:55] through 9 as you have therefore receive
[23:58] christ
[23:59] jesus the lord so walk ye in him rooted
[24:02] and built up in him
[24:05] and established in the faith as ye have
[24:08] been taught abounding
[24:10] therein with thanksgiving be wireless
[24:13] any man spoil you
[24:14] through philosophy and vain deceit
[24:18] after the traditions of men after the
[24:21] rudiments of the world
[24:23] and not after christ just beware that
[24:25] man is trying to take you away from
[24:26] christ which is the word
[24:28] is that what he's saying okay for in him
[24:32] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[24:37] bodily you may be seated the lord had
[24:39] his blessing
[24:40] to the reading of the word
[24:43] now i'm trying to start another i guess
[24:46] it'll be
[24:47] another but i said when we were in the
[24:50] series
[24:51] back there of the the revelation of
[24:54] jesus christ
[24:56] that we would pick up some topics along
[24:58] the way
[24:59] but i think this is a very good time i
[25:02] tried to
[25:03] cover in some things into the message
[25:07] about uh you know uh
[25:10] the godhead and things because that's
[25:12] one of my favorite topics
[25:15] and i wanted to uh pick up some things
[25:18] to uh just talk about them a little bit
[25:21] some things that we view along the way
[25:24] in doing it
[25:25] uh now we know
[25:28] that there's just one true and living
[25:30] god all right
[25:33] now we can say well we believe this we
[25:36] believe that there's just one true and
[25:37] living god
[25:39] but you know what i like to look at
[25:41] things a lot of times
[25:43] to the bases that uh you can take
[25:47] what is said here and what is said here
[25:50] and put them together they will come
[25:53] together to express
[25:54] god in his ways and things like that so
[25:57] we're going to be talking about the
[25:58] godhead
[25:59] maybe a couple of services or whatever
[26:01] but it'll be really the godhead made
[26:03] plain
[26:05] are clear to us because i think after
[26:08] all of these years of studying 50 years
[26:11] in the message
[26:12] that i think we ought to be able to
[26:15] comprehend the things the prophet has
[26:18] said to us
[26:19] and how he would explain things and
[26:22] that's what we will be doing
[26:24] is going with what he said you know
[26:27] to express it but maybe take some
[26:28] thoughts of ourself
[26:30] and just place it within it to try to
[26:32] click the mind because
[26:35] that to me is is um
[26:40] you know you uh you say well i
[26:43] understand but a lot of times
[26:46] you know you can understand to a point
[26:49] but not see it clearly and it just keeps
[26:51] unveiling
[26:52] that's what i said i've been studying
[26:54] this message for 50 years
[26:56] well you know what it's more clearer
[26:58] today than it was then a whole lot more
[27:00] because it just keeps unfolding i read
[27:03] it then
[27:03] i could preach it then i preached on the
[27:05] godhead in the in the
[27:07] in the uh late 60s early 70s
[27:11] and preached a lot of services about
[27:13] those things
[27:14] that you know you can go into the
[27:16] computer and pick them up and see that i
[27:18] was preaching it back there
[27:19] and preaching it and believing now i
[27:21] believe in one true and living god
[27:24] but we you have to be careful the way
[27:26] you place things
[27:28] because you can be misunderstood and
[27:30] people can think that you're a oneness
[27:33] because that's very close
[27:36] you know it's very close to the truth it
[27:39] was closer than the trinity
[27:42] see because you had three and like a man
[27:45] told me it worked one day and i was
[27:46] trying to explain it to him
[27:48] you know that there was just one god and
[27:50] father son and holy ghost and
[27:52] and he said well you know well i see
[27:54] that that god in jesus is the same
[27:57] and said uh you know i said well then
[28:00] you've done away with one of your gods
[28:02] why don't you just do away with one of
[28:04] the others and you'll be right
[28:06] you know and put it in one god because
[28:09] if you can say you see
[28:10] this now we'll just do away with one
[28:12] more well if that's the way you think
[28:14] let's just do
[28:16] one more see we know that the trinity
[28:19] is a uh point that was brought through
[28:22] from the catholic church back from
[28:24] 325 a.d and things coming down and
[28:27] coming into the situation of where we're
[28:29] at
[28:31] but yet to think about it see then you
[28:33] don't want to go to the trinity
[28:35] but it takes father son and holy ghost
[28:38] to make one god
[28:41] now god is not complete without
[28:45] those three offices uh
[28:48] attributes etc of father son and holy
[28:52] ghost you leave out one
[28:53] then your understanding is not complete
[28:56] you say well i can see it as far as
[28:58] hearing god in the spirit
[29:00] and the thing but i just can't see what
[29:02] see then you've got a
[29:04] problem with understanding that you need
[29:07] to have some
[29:08] help to pull that together but not to do
[29:11] away with anything
[29:12] uh you know i'll be making some
[29:15] statements as i go along like
[29:17] i believe and this is where i've always
[29:19] believed because if you
[29:20] it would be the only way you can keep
[29:21] your one god correctly
[29:23] see i believe that one day when this
[29:25] world is over with we'll be on the other
[29:27] side
[29:27] right all right and
[29:30] when you get there are you going to see
[29:33] as the catholic said it are you going to
[29:35] see a little
[29:36] altar over here for the father and a
[29:38] little something over here for the sun
[29:40] and a little something over here for the
[29:41] holy ghost
[29:44] you know now you're going to see jesus
[29:47] and know who he is
[29:50] see once that body came into being
[29:53] statement listen
[29:54] once that body came into being
[29:57] see two thousand years ago birth etc
[30:00] once that body came into being and god
[30:02] entered that body he will never leave
[30:04] that body
[30:07] he will not go make another body to live
[30:09] in the millennium
[30:11] or another one to go to the future home
[30:14] see jesus said if you've seen me
[30:16] you've seen the father
[30:20] well see it never will be that he'll do
[30:23] away with anything
[30:25] see that's where the people that do and
[30:27] you start with doctrines and start
[30:29] talking with people and you'll see them
[30:30] immediately start doing away with this
[30:32] and doing away with this and
[30:33] you know right in there talking if
[30:35] you'll watch them and then just stop and
[30:36] say hold it a minute now
[30:38] like i told a man at work one day he
[30:40] said i'm going to explain the trinity to
[30:42] you
[30:43] i said well go right ahead but only
[30:44] problem that i have i want to make sure
[30:46] i understand you
[30:49] i said now i mean that's the main thing
[30:52] and i said
[30:53] when you say something i want to say uh
[30:57] what do you mean i said because i want
[31:00] to understand what you're saying
[31:02] well he said i just popped my hand up he
[31:04] said this ain't going to work
[31:08] you know he was saying the word because
[31:11] he knew
[31:11] you know that that that was a problem i
[31:13] talked to brother in this message and
[31:15] he said if you ever see me off of
[31:17] anything raise your hand well
[31:19] two words
[31:23] i'm sorry you're the one who said it
[31:26] you know all right but listen
[31:30] see when we get there do you expect to
[31:34] see
[31:35] three things sitting nothing
[31:38] or you expect to see one god
[31:42] which is the lord jesus christ
[31:45] in a human flesh called a son
[31:51] not him as a son as a second person
[31:55] no but him as a son
[31:58] because remember if you have one god
[32:02] you've got to have to have one god
[32:04] you've got to have a father son and holy
[32:05] ghost
[32:07] okay that makes one god
[32:10] leave one out try to add in something
[32:12] else release it to the point that you're
[32:14] missing it and see your trinity would
[32:16] follow it up okay
[32:18] now you can't fall onto the side of the
[32:20] oneness
[32:22] in an easy way to illustrate brother
[32:24] dick addison used to
[32:26] we used to talk about this a lot uh
[32:28] about it
[32:29] uh you know when you talk about
[32:32] one god and people just run you over
[32:35] into a oneness
[32:38] well uh
[32:41] the oneness doctrine
[32:44] is at the point that
[32:47] jesus was the liest
[32:51] form of god now go
[32:54] go study your oneness doctrine and
[32:56] you'll come to that end of understanding
[32:59] that they believe that jesus was the
[33:02] final
[33:02] immorphy or form of god
[33:06] well i mean i'm sorry myself now you go
[33:09] you're
[33:10] uh the i believe the bride is the final
[33:14] voice to the final age
[33:16] i believe the bride is the last in
[33:18] morphy of god
[33:21] all right so then now your oneness is
[33:23] gone
[33:25] there's another way of seeing it the
[33:26] oneness believe he's one like your
[33:28] finger
[33:30] and see you say father son
[33:33] holy ghost one like your finger that
[33:36] won't work
[33:37] you've got to have the manifestations
[33:42] of father son and holy ghost to have one
[33:44] god
[33:46] so then those things i'm saying those
[33:49] things should be
[33:50] taken out of our understanding
[33:54] as to doing it because you know but to
[33:57] me one main thing
[33:58] is the what i just said the bride is the
[34:01] final voice
[34:03] now we're talking about to the gentile
[34:04] dispensation because we know that he
[34:06] goes to the jews once we leave out of
[34:08] here
[34:09] in a rapture et cetera he'll go to the
[34:11] jews
[34:12] but when he goes to the jews he takes
[34:14] this message that we have
[34:16] so it won't be god in another form you
[34:19] know another form of him
[34:20] it'd be the same form that it is to you
[34:22] and i because we are here at the age of
[34:25] where everything
[34:26] is coming up and finalizing it and
[34:28] seeing it as right here
[34:30] i'm not preaching about what was
[34:34] sometimes you have to do that to bring
[34:36] it down to get your understanding
[34:37] and i'm not looking as to what will be
[34:41] and that's fine but i i like to see
[34:45] about what's
[34:46] living right now you know i'm
[34:49] i'm a present tense person i guess you'd
[34:51] call me i like to see things where i'm
[34:54] at
[34:55] and seeing it from my understanding and
[34:57] and
[34:58] you know let's see
[35:02] see then watch this statement this
[35:04] there's a point that i like
[35:07] i thought about this the other day
[35:09] you'll see me up here a lot of times i
[35:10] know the preachers think i'm writing
[35:12] notes maybe to jump on to them but
[35:14] i don't on i write notes and put them in
[35:17] my pocket well nanny's here
[35:18] but why she won't never throw away them
[35:20] little piece of notes
[35:22] because she knows there's some writing
[35:23] on it but she doesn't understand it
[35:25] because
[35:25] she'd have to translate it and
[35:29] and uh yeah so she won't throw it away
[35:31] she'll keep it
[35:32] but see i like to write down little
[35:34] notes
[35:36] all right now if it's true and we've
[35:38] read
[35:39] here that in him dwelt the fullness of
[35:43] the godhead bodily
[35:46] all right now if that's true
[35:49] where's your trinity
[35:56] because whatever you got would have to
[35:58] be in him
[36:00] the fullness of the godhead bodily would
[36:02] have to be in him
[36:04] all right see then if it's there
[36:08] where would where would your other
[36:10] persons or personalities or whatever you
[36:13] want to bring for your trinity and
[36:15] doctrine where would you get to with it
[36:18] you got it all in jesus christ
[36:22] that's just like the lord jesus and
[36:23] matthew there he said you know
[36:26] um all powers given unto me
[36:30] in heaven and in earth but around him
[36:34] one day said it like this
[36:35] he said where then is the power of the
[36:38] father
[36:43] did you do away with something to come
[36:44] down to that situation
[36:46] or do you incorporate i don't know that
[36:48] may not be the correct way but i
[36:50] i just got enough english to talk but
[36:53] you know when you
[36:54] to me god is trying to bring things down
[36:57] to a
[36:57] situation to where that you can look at
[37:00] it and see it as complete
[37:04] finished you know and complete
[37:07] and can you bring your can you bring
[37:09] your ideas
[37:11] through the bible and come out at the
[37:14] place to where you can see it
[37:16] then and follow it can you do that see
[37:19] if you can
[37:20] all right then you lined up for
[37:21] something anyway
[37:23] but if you say well i just don't
[37:25] understand that i don't understand
[37:27] how that jesus could be there on earth
[37:30] and talking to a father in heaven
[37:36] well you got the baptism of the holy
[37:38] ghost
[37:39] i'm quoting brother branham or you
[37:40] believe it or not you got the baptism in
[37:42] the holy ghost who do you pray to
[37:46] well i pray to the one inside of me be
[37:48] careful now that
[37:50] you've got some good truth but remember
[37:56] you're praying to the father that's what
[37:59] a man said one time he said that's the
[38:00] funniest way you people are said
[38:02] you start off with prayer you ask the
[38:04] father to help you and to heal you
[38:05] and you close it in jesus name
[38:10] well okay that's true because jesus is
[38:14] the name of the father
[38:16] his name is jesus but not a oneness
[38:20] point see that's what i've been trying
[38:23] to bring up
[38:24] through the series of uh getting you to
[38:28] see
[38:30] that even though you
[38:33] you look back and wonder what started or
[38:35] worded everything
[38:36] brother branham explained it so we went
[38:38] through it
[38:40] he said god's first creation was himself
[38:44] well he wasn't talking about creating
[38:46] something mold it up and making it you
[38:48] know
[38:48] that that's not the word that's the word
[38:51] we use but that tricks us mind
[38:54] and our mind goes haywire and we start
[38:55] talking about well what did he do here
[38:57] and
[38:58] how did he make it he takes so much
[38:59] calcium potassium to pile it together
[39:01] now we created by his word
[39:07] see then the prophet could easily say it
[39:09] even the scholars
[39:11] the scholars if you'll read scofi i mean
[39:15] uh you know scofield if you'll read
[39:18] back there with those guys they will
[39:20] explain that the son
[39:22] was back there
[39:27] he said well how can he be back there
[39:28] when he was the father see that's where
[39:30] you're not seeing it correctly
[39:32] that's where he started condescending
[39:34] when he started condescending he was the
[39:36] first
[39:38] to be unfolded or revealed he's
[39:41] revealing himself
[39:43] all right then he changed her form
[39:47] and then morphing change over to making
[39:49] it
[39:50] that he the word comes into view
[39:55] all right see then you can see that the
[39:57] word is right
[39:58] and the word creates all things so the
[40:00] father didn't create
[40:04] it's the word but it was the father in
[40:07] another form so don't misunderstand that
[40:09] the father
[40:10] he would change his form and come forth
[40:13] as being the
[40:15] the creator because the bible said
[40:17] talking about jesus
[40:18] the bible said all things were created
[40:20] by him
[40:21] and without him there was not anything
[40:23] made that was made
[40:25] all right so then it comes forth and
[40:27] clarity to understand
[40:30] that what you're seeing is you're seeing
[40:32] god unveiling
[40:34] in the acts of a play that
[40:38] one person plays many parts the
[40:40] difference in the natural acts of a play
[40:44] is that person has to to eventually go
[40:47] out of existence
[40:49] somewhere down the road trying to do but
[40:51] god doesn't do it
[40:52] he just unfolds one stage
[40:55] he steps over in another stage he's the
[40:59] word that creates all things
[41:01] then you can call him the logos the
[41:03] theophany the things that the prophet
[41:05] began to use
[41:06] that we think we know a whole lot about
[41:07] it because we can quote it
[41:09] but if we don't know it by heart then we
[41:11] don't if we don't have the logos within
[41:13] us then don't worry about knowing what
[41:14] the logos is
[41:16] because it won't work all right but see
[41:18] that god comes in
[41:20] you because we're going to make a
[41:21] statement in a minute of like this
[41:25] see god is not complete without father
[41:28] son and holy god
[41:29] let me back up i can get like weight i
[41:31] get to walking
[41:33] you can always you can always tell the
[41:34] difference in me and wade he walked this
[41:36] way
[41:37] i walk that away so that's that's the
[41:39] difference in
[41:40] they're doing all right but you see
[41:46] god now follow me he was unveiling
[41:50] himself
[41:53] which is an increase each unveiling
[41:57] from coming from the first creation then
[41:59] into the creation
[42:01] of to what we would talk about the word
[42:03] being there that's a deeper
[42:05] depth or more understanding of that god
[42:07] than when you say
[42:09] the son of god see the son of god
[42:15] is exactly what it was back there
[42:18] he was back there the son of god was
[42:20] back there
[42:21] all right but not back there as another
[42:24] personality that's where you get you
[42:26] wrong
[42:28] ever what you're doing like what i was
[42:30] doing see i'm stepping down to real
[42:32] to illustrate going from one
[42:36] part to another part but not persons
[42:40] it's the same person that's being
[42:43] revealed
[42:45] but it takes all of these uh may i use
[42:48] the word personality
[42:50] or identities because that's the one
[42:52] thing the prophet said
[42:53] god was trying to do was to show us his
[42:56] identity
[42:59] right through the opening of the word
[43:02] all right
[43:03] it keeps unveiling and he just keeps
[43:06] unveiling
[43:08] and he unveiled itself down to the point
[43:10] till it comes to genesis 1
[43:12] 26-27 all right
[43:15] let us make man
[43:18] and there was a spirit man come into
[43:20] being which is not another person
[43:25] with the same person in another form
[43:28] all right see at the end of you go on
[43:31] for a little while and
[43:32] and and and here comes adam as a human
[43:36] being that
[43:36] brother brother said god just took that
[43:39] 126 put it into 2-7
[43:42] and he said you've got god standing in
[43:45] human flesh
[43:46] on the earth breathe into his nostrils
[43:50] according to blasphemous names that he
[43:52] breathed into his nostrils and adam
[43:55] became a living soul
[43:56] said especially into adam eternal life
[44:03] he put 126 into 2
[44:06] 7 and that was putting eternal life
[44:10] god's own life all right then who was
[44:14] adam
[44:17] he was the first adam
[44:21] but then i was hoping you'd listen to
[44:22] the things that i was trying to express
[44:25] because you see then that puts it looks
[44:28] like an odd situation but you've got
[44:31] genesis 1 26-27 then you got 2-7
[44:35] and you've got adam standing on the
[44:37] earth he said first he's standing with
[44:39] his feet in the earth where he molded up
[44:40] from
[44:41] and made him and he said then he
[44:42] breathed into his nostrils
[44:45] well see then breathing into his
[44:47] nostrils
[44:49] the breath of eternal life
[44:52] all right but the thing that never made
[44:55] it very far because brother brown said
[44:57] god
[44:58] said adam fell from eternal life to
[45:00] death in the garden that's a seal book
[45:02] all right i don't agree with that water
[45:03] but he didn't fall to hell
[45:07] get all those things out of the way well
[45:08] where did he go when he died
[45:12] he never got to it
[45:18] see that's taking brother branham and
[45:19] just changing a few words and what he's
[45:21] saying
[45:21] and it comes down to clearly adam fell
[45:25] from eternal life to death in the garden
[45:28] where'd he fall what'd he do what went
[45:30] on
[45:32] no he never felt that way he never got
[45:34] there
[45:38] so he fell from in other words the tree
[45:40] of life was there
[45:43] right and what does the bible say
[45:46] when sin had entered the picture
[45:50] let us put the man out of the garden
[45:52] lest he partake of the tree of life and
[45:54] live forever
[45:56] he had already sinned in body he had sin
[46:00] involved in spirit but in soul he was a
[46:03] child of god
[46:04] [Music]
[46:06] i hope you never get the point to think
[46:08] that you can't do wrong
[46:10] that's one thing i've drove over and
[46:12] over and over you say well i'm a child
[46:14] of god i can't do wrong you
[46:16] you're already done wrong right then
[46:18] cause you let the devil
[46:19] tell you a lie
[46:23] that's why you need a savior all right
[46:25] but see there was
[46:27] adam coming into being as a natural
[46:31] being
[46:32] before jesus even come into being
[46:36] the natural flesh
[46:39] right adam comes into being yes
[46:43] jesus the natural flesh never come into
[46:45] being
[46:47] the flex man jesus didn't come into
[46:49] being back there it was four thousand
[46:51] years later
[46:54] before that adam i mean before that the
[46:56] lord jesus became the second adam
[47:01] and took the place in the creation line
[47:04] all right
[47:05] well see believing then keeping it to
[47:07] one true and living god
[47:13] then god is not complete
[47:17] without father son and holy ghost
[47:24] that enough to where we've got the point
[47:26] there god is not complete without father
[47:28] son and holy ghost
[47:30] so then it's not going to get up to
[47:31] heaven and we're going to find this one
[47:33] over here and there's over here and
[47:34] there's no over here
[47:34] and they finally caught back up together
[47:36] and we got three now like one feller
[47:38] said said what are you going to do when
[47:39] you go there and you don't find three he
[47:40] said i'll leave
[47:43] well i'm the other way if i get there
[47:44] and find three i'm going to leave
[47:48] now you do what you want to i'm getting
[47:50] out of there because it'd be the wrong
[47:52] place
[47:54] all right i'm not making a joke but just
[47:57] telling it like it is
[47:59] all right but see he's not complete
[48:02] without father-son old you're not
[48:03] complete without body spirit and soul
[48:06] right that don't make you three
[48:13] but out of that body spirit and soul man
[48:15] that you are
[48:16] you can be us a father
[48:20] a grandfather you've got many attributes
[48:23] that can come forth but you're not
[48:24] bringing no more personalities into view
[48:26] just leave that out that's what brought
[48:28] him up when he hit me that day
[48:30] so hard you know how do you believe it i
[48:33] said well i believe in
[48:34] one truth living god because baptist
[48:36] doctrine there's one god
[48:39] you've never been there you go back and
[48:41] check on it baptist doctrine is one true
[48:43] and living god they'll explain it that
[48:45] way
[48:45] but then you say well explain it that's
[48:47] the way i explained to brother mode i
[48:48] said he's gotten three persons
[48:53] he said would you mind explaining that
[48:56] i said well you know the father was a
[48:58] person and the holy ghost was a person
[49:00] and
[49:01] i said i knew he had me nailed to the
[49:04] wall boy
[49:06] he was sitting there grinning i was
[49:09] sitting there crying because i knew i
[49:11] nailed the wall somebody done took me
[49:12] apart
[49:14] he said a person is a personality right
[49:18] i said yes sir he said then are you
[49:21] saying there's a personality of the
[49:22] father personality of the son the
[49:24] personality of the holy ghost
[49:27] i said i don't believe that no more
[49:30] that's what i said because i knew there
[49:33] was no argument
[49:34] i said i i don't believe that no more
[49:37] explain a lot of these things to me but
[49:39] i don't believe that one
[49:40] at least i've got this personality
[49:42] strength thing straight
[49:44] because he said you're a father you're a
[49:46] human you're you're a
[49:47] child you're but there's only one of you
[49:52] we hear brother branham say those things
[49:53] and we think oh those little silly
[49:55] illustrations that he's making they
[49:58] ain't too silly to me
[49:59] they're wonderful
[50:02] because they're expressing to me as a
[50:04] human being something i can understand
[50:06] a theologian try to build it up with all
[50:08] these other big words and i can't get it
[50:12] but i can listen to a prophet and he can
[50:14] just
[50:16] explain it all right do you agree then i
[50:20] don't mean
[50:20] you gotta vote on it or hold your hand
[50:22] up do you agree then that
[50:26] all is pointing down that looks like
[50:28] three personalities but it's not
[50:30] personalities
[50:31] it's all the manifestation of one person
[50:35] but that one person is coming forth
[50:40] see i agree wholeheartedly
[50:44] that jesus never become the fullness of
[50:46] the godhead bodily
[50:48] until the river jordan i do
[50:51] because he couldn't die for your sins as
[50:53] a as a two-year-old baby
[50:56] so he couldn't manifest
[50:59] he couldn't make manifest until he come
[51:01] forth into a man of time to manifest
[51:03] so then there he was
[51:07] but that's the problem when you try to
[51:08] make it the other way and see then it'll
[51:10] go wrong
[51:11] but now think about it
[51:18] you realize that uh
[51:24] god is not complete without you
[51:31] i didn't say that your prophet did
[51:36] okay let's just read it okay
[51:42] go ahead to number number two brothers
[51:46] and then we'll get to number three
[51:50] or i love to where they can bring up
[51:52] things so listen
[51:53] to the message on christ the mystery of
[51:55] god reveal
[51:57] just read on it you read before and
[51:58] after and come back and tell me whether
[52:00] i miss it you know when i got the paper
[52:02] here
[52:03] god expressed in jesus who was both
[52:06] father son and holy ghost
[52:09] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[52:13] the complete fullness of the godhead
[52:16] bodily
[52:17] dwells in his
[52:20] church
[52:24] the preeminence all that god was he
[52:27] poured into christ and all christ was
[52:29] he poured into the church to believers
[52:33] all right
[52:37] go to the next one which should lean out
[52:40] to your understanding and understand it
[52:42] so we see if you were in the
[52:44] foreknowledge of god then you are
[52:46] becoming a part of god and the only way
[52:49] you can be a son of god or a daughter of
[52:52] god
[52:52] you have to be a part of god now that's
[52:56] sensible in it
[52:58] okay you had to be a part of god
[53:01] and god isn't complete without you
[53:08] like i said if if it's true that the
[53:10] bible says it and we talk about
[53:12] that in him dwelt the fullness of the
[53:14] godhead bodily
[53:16] so then if there was never a time that
[53:18] you and i were in him
[53:20] then he ain't complete
[53:25] but when he manifests itself through you
[53:28] he's gaining one more
[53:30] uh one more little speck of eternity
[53:36] that keeps on until all of it comes
[53:37] together
[53:39] and then you got to complete fullness of
[53:42] the godhead bodily
[53:44] how many do you want because you know
[53:45] it's there where brother brown said the
[53:47] bride is the fullness of the godhead
[53:49] bodily
[53:53] well i just i just can't see that well
[53:54] see that's what i mean
[53:56] that's what i do a lot of times i say
[53:58] things and then i i
[54:00] say well you know well i just can't see
[54:02] that we'll see
[54:05] go back and study something go back and
[54:07] think about it
[54:11] if he's not complete without you then
[54:14] who's he waiting on
[54:19] he's waiting on you and me to come to a
[54:22] place right you had to be a part of god
[54:25] and god isn't complete without you
[54:26] has to be that's right because dire is
[54:29] one
[54:30] only one resource of eternal life
[54:33] so you can't have the father with
[54:35] eternal life
[54:37] and the son with eternal life
[54:41] i'm talking about different
[54:42] personalities now and the holy ghost
[54:46] see as a personality separate from the
[54:49] others
[54:49] and try to have eternal life
[54:53] because like brother brown said it who
[54:54] created who
[54:58] the bible said all things were created
[55:00] by jesus christ
[55:01] well did he create the father
[55:06] no the father created him
[55:11] but you see that's word that we don't
[55:13] think about what's being said
[55:15] in the simplicity and listen to the
[55:19] prophet in simplicity
[55:21] as he expresses scriptures and things
[55:27] and see that he's not complete without
[55:29] you
[55:30] you realize the eternal life that you
[55:32] have within your soul
[55:35] is a part of god amen
[55:38] right he's imparted himself
[55:42] into you
[55:46] does that make us anything no because he
[55:48] done all of it
[55:50] that makes him something that makes him
[55:52] a father
[55:53] that makes him a healer a savior etc etc
[56:00] because you've got to come over into the
[56:01] human elements of flesh and things
[56:04] to be able to understand those things
[56:06] just like i was trying to explain to you
[56:08] during that series
[56:09] how that adam come into being before the
[56:12] lord jesus did i'm talking about the
[56:14] flesh man
[56:15] the flesh man adam came into being
[56:17] before the flesh man jesus came in to be
[56:20] you know why you ever thought about it
[56:22] why
[56:24] because in adam then would be the
[56:26] capability
[56:27] of falling
[56:31] the capability of falling god didn't
[56:33] make him fall
[56:35] but the capability came into being
[56:37] through adam and eve
[56:39] then god can what not throw him down
[56:41] brother branham
[56:42] explain it he said god did not curse
[56:45] adam
[56:47] he said god did not curse eve
[56:52] he said he cursed the snake he cursed
[56:54] the earth and the thing
[56:56] but he never cursed adam and eve why
[56:59] how could he curse them if they had
[57:00] eternal life in their soul
[57:05] right how could you curse them if they
[57:08] had eternal life in their soul
[57:12] see when we listen to a prophet explain
[57:14] things and we talk about
[57:16] abraham and sarah and think about what
[57:18] he's talking about
[57:20] a lot of times we just take it away
[57:22] there and it goes out
[57:23] but you realize that the reason
[57:28] god could not destroy
[57:31] sarah the reason that he couldn't
[57:35] destroy eve
[57:37] was because they were apart
[57:41] right eve was a part of adam
[57:46] all right sarah was a part of abraham
[57:51] he couldn't destroy him that's wonderful
[57:56] come on church i've tried my best to
[57:58] express things to not get into deep
[58:00] too far with it of understanding you
[58:02] realize your children are a part of you
[58:06] and who's going to claim them if you
[58:08] don't
[58:12] who's going to claim those children if
[58:13] you don't
[58:15] yeah but look how bad they're getting
[58:17] come on let's
[58:18] just don't get off on that i'm talking
[58:20] about bad too because i don't worry
[58:22] about it i'll just bring up me and you
[58:25] you think about how bad things are
[58:28] the least little thing before god is
[58:30] death
[58:34] i had adam and eve you remember that
[58:37] had they not been an atonement
[58:40] before adam sinned he would have been
[58:43] cast out
[58:45] he said wait a minute wait a minute now
[58:46] where was the atonement before the
[58:48] foundation of the world
[58:51] he stood as a lamb slain so when adam
[58:54] come forth and done what he'd done
[58:56] god couldn't destroy him because there
[58:57] was eternal life in adam
[59:00] he'd have been destroying his own self
[59:03] just trying to talk to you about
[59:05] something on god
[59:07] and the godhead to understand
[59:10] to get it to a basis that we can see
[59:12] things for ourselves right
[59:20] see there's only one resource of eternal
[59:23] life
[59:24] and that is god and him alone has
[59:26] eternal life
[59:27] now and you were a part of him now watch
[59:31] in so much that you are an attribute
[59:36] are in his thinking in the beginning and
[59:39] that
[59:39] because he thought of you
[59:43] in the beginning it gives that little
[59:45] tug towards him
[59:48] that's what has to be quickened
[59:51] some of them will never be quickened
[59:53] they just don't have it
[59:56] they don't get that i love that right
[59:58] there the little tug
[1:00:01] and that was the prayer brother moat
[1:00:03] would pray when somebody was
[1:00:05] receiving her praying for the holy ghost
[1:00:11] he said lord said just give them a
[1:00:14] little tug
[1:00:16] on their heart
[1:00:20] see we like that beat them on the back
[1:00:22] and jerk them up down scream and holler
[1:00:24] i ain't against none of that that's your
[1:00:26] business
[1:00:28] but i do like i did one time we was
[1:00:30] praying in a prayer line
[1:00:32] and this brother he was that he was
[1:00:34] there and boy he was
[1:00:36] and i ain't throwing off on him now i'm
[1:00:38] just saying what happened
[1:00:39] he was shouting and glory hallelujah and
[1:00:41] everything
[1:00:42] and praying for the people and i was
[1:00:45] right next to him
[1:00:47] when he come to me i said let's hold it
[1:00:49] just a minute
[1:00:51] let's settle down and let's think this
[1:00:54] thing over
[1:00:57] we're talking about something that's
[1:00:58] salvation
[1:01:02] i was trying to get that little tug in
[1:01:03] the heart to him see
[1:01:05] well that brother he was and i ain't
[1:01:06] joking now that brother he was over here
[1:01:08] and he was praying to them people
[1:01:10] and he started seeing that these same
[1:01:12] people that was coming by here
[1:01:14] were dried-eyed and standing you know
[1:01:16] okay you prayed for me
[1:01:17] but when they passed where i was at
[1:01:19] trying to get that little point
[1:01:20] you'd see at least tears in their eyes
[1:01:25] and he'd go i ain't kidding you
[1:01:29] next night we lined up same prayer line
[1:01:33] you know what he was saying because i
[1:01:35] got right outside of him wanting to
[1:01:37] listen he said now let's be serious
[1:01:39] about this
[1:01:40] let's take this thing over i said well
[1:01:43] okay
[1:01:44] i'm not against emotions i believe in
[1:01:46] emotions i believe anything that's
[1:01:48] that doesn't have emotions is dead
[1:01:52] but i don't put emotions ahead of god's
[1:01:54] word i put his word first and then the
[1:01:56] emotions will come
[1:01:58] if they don't come then you've got a
[1:01:59] problem thinking about the word and you
[1:02:01] need to consider it all right
[1:02:03] listen so all right we've read
[1:02:08] that in jesus christ was the fullness of
[1:02:10] the godhead
[1:02:11] bodily all that god was he was poured
[1:02:14] into christ how many times brought
[1:02:15] around would make that stone
[1:02:17] and all christ into the church to take
[1:02:19] us back to the garden
[1:02:20] how many times did he make that
[1:02:22] statement i'd be scared to say less than
[1:02:24] 100 or
[1:02:24] 200 times that he said it you know
[1:02:27] because he meant
[1:02:28] it all god was he poured into christ
[1:02:32] and all christ into the church well now
[1:02:35] i'm asking you
[1:02:37] see i'm trying to i try to make you
[1:02:39] think okay
[1:02:40] i'm asking you if all the wave was put
[1:02:44] into donny
[1:02:45] wade's out of the picture right
[1:02:50] am i right i mean any sister
[1:02:53] brother whatever if if it's always put
[1:02:55] over then
[1:02:56] that's out of order that's not so god
[1:03:01] it's not exactly opposite all
[1:03:04] god was was poured into christ that
[1:03:06] magnified
[1:03:09] him that brought more into being just
[1:03:12] like he's not complete without you
[1:03:14] once you come in then that part of god
[1:03:16] is complete
[1:03:17] in that basis why are we looking for the
[1:03:20] last one
[1:03:24] all right and we do and it will be
[1:03:29] but until that last one gets here and
[1:03:31] comes in
[1:03:33] let's try to build a body to get it
[1:03:34] strong
[1:03:36] so that in a day like this where your
[1:03:38] viruses and your
[1:03:39] your your things and all you won't be
[1:03:41] falling apart
[1:03:45] i'm going to say this statement and
[1:03:47] leave it to those
[1:03:49] if you stop coming to church because
[1:03:52] you're afraid of the virus
[1:03:54] what would you do if they came in here
[1:03:58] with guns
[1:04:00] to kill us
[1:04:05] well brother dale i'm scared i'm not
[1:04:07] telling nobody to go to church
[1:04:09] heaven help me now you get the wrong
[1:04:11] thing you say brother dale's
[1:04:12] beating on us cause we ain't coming no
[1:04:14] but i'm just asking you the question
[1:04:18] what would you do if it was any other
[1:04:24] situation
[1:04:27] if we can't keep up with the footman
[1:04:30] what about when the horsemen get here
[1:04:32] if we can't survive in the what is it in
[1:04:35] a
[1:04:36] time of plenty in other words what we do
[1:04:40] when the swelling of jordan it gets down
[1:04:42] and we ain't got nothing
[1:04:45] amen well brother there you just don't
[1:04:48] say a lot about these things
[1:04:50] why because
[1:04:54] we should get into the word and let
[1:04:56] these things take care of itself
[1:04:59] god will take care of you and i if we
[1:05:01] are his bride
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:06] but you didn't hear me come around and
[1:05:08] say well now
[1:05:09] uh if you get the virus you ain't of god
[1:05:13] no
[1:05:17] i think you're wrong when you say it
[1:05:18] like that
[1:05:21] yeah but the bible says that he won't
[1:05:23] let these things come on
[1:05:25] he won't let it take you and drive you
[1:05:27] to hell
[1:05:28] he may take you to the grave i spent
[1:05:36] five days in the hospital
[1:05:39] with double pneumonia they said
[1:05:42] come out of it and i'm getting my
[1:05:46] strength back i'm getting everything
[1:05:51] why because i believe that god is a
[1:05:53] healer
[1:05:54] and the people praying for us for me
[1:05:56] around the world that would bring it to
[1:05:58] the basis that it would come forth one
[1:06:00] day
[1:06:01] all right see let's talk about the
[1:06:04] healer
[1:06:06] it's not because you're sick that you're
[1:06:08] of god or not of god
[1:06:09] because you're sick let's get on to the
[1:06:13] healer
[1:06:14] let's talk about i'm healed amen
[1:06:20] let me ask you a question how do you get
[1:06:23] salvation
[1:06:25] sitting there last night just thinking
[1:06:29] how do you get salvation
[1:06:34] well start off god has to call you
[1:06:39] right no man can come unless god called
[1:06:42] him
[1:06:43] god has to call you all right
[1:06:46] now you've got to believe
[1:06:51] that he saves you right
[1:06:56] now what's the other one believeth with
[1:06:59] his
[1:07:00] heart and confess with his mouth
[1:07:03] now those are identically two parts but
[1:07:05] it's the same thing right
[1:07:08] if you can't confess that you're healed
[1:07:12] then you are not healed
[1:07:15] you are just saying what somebody else
[1:07:18] says well brother so-and-so said i was
[1:07:20] healed
[1:07:22] praise god but when you're gonna say for
[1:07:26] yourself
[1:07:29] when you're going to talk about yourself
[1:07:32] when you're going to say by his stripes
[1:07:33] i'm healed
[1:07:35] when you're going to walk up to
[1:07:36] something to death and look at it in
[1:07:38] this life
[1:07:39] and say bye stripes i'm healed
[1:07:42] i sit in that hospital room
[1:07:46] five days the greatest comfort i got
[1:07:52] was the times that i would talk to the
[1:07:54] family and thing
[1:07:55] and they'd say everybody
[1:07:58] is praying for you
[1:08:04] well if you don't confess you're healed
[1:08:09] you can't be healed if you don't confess
[1:08:11] you're saved
[1:08:12] you can't be saved because it's in the
[1:08:14] same sozo you know same eternal life or
[1:08:16] the same
[1:08:17] doing all right just talking to us about
[1:08:22] things
[1:08:27] well brother dale i don't want to say
[1:08:28] i'm healed when i'm not i may
[1:08:30] you're making a shame to not say you're
[1:08:32] healed amen
[1:08:34] you're in reverse
[1:08:37] you're in the devil's trap when you say
[1:08:39] oh well i'm not healed
[1:08:42] you'll never be healed see people say
[1:08:46] when i get healed i'll tell you
[1:08:48] okay you're gonna die
[1:08:54] am i got no problems you won't get in
[1:08:56] the scripture with me let's talk about
[1:08:57] it you're going to die
[1:08:59] because if you don't confess you're
[1:09:00] healed you can't be healed
[1:09:02] if you don't confess you're saved you
[1:09:03] can't be saved
[1:09:06] you're saying what somebody else says
[1:09:09] say it until it comes to fights who was
[1:09:11] that one that said i'm gonna preach
[1:09:12] faith until we get faith it was one of
[1:09:14] the one down through time
[1:09:16] he said i'm gonna preach fast do we get
[1:09:18] faith
[1:09:22] i like what the story is told but it's
[1:09:23] told about a joke you know about the
[1:09:26] preacher preaching so much on sin and
[1:09:27] the deacons got together and said can't
[1:09:29] you get something else he said let them
[1:09:30] all repent and they'll get something
[1:09:32] else
[1:09:37] see the truth of salvation in things
[1:09:40] are thought about in the simplicity
[1:09:43] because
[1:09:44] if jesus was the fullness of the
[1:09:46] god-head bodily
[1:09:48] what happened to the father and the holy
[1:09:50] ghost
[1:09:55] now i'm asking you to make a thought in
[1:09:56] your mind
[1:09:58] what happened to the father and the holy
[1:10:00] ghost
[1:10:06] you're going to make them personalities
[1:10:07] you got to divide it up then
[1:10:12] no no no no they're not personalities
[1:10:14] they're you know
[1:10:15] all right see then if you get down to
[1:10:17] one you can find out where you're going
[1:10:25] think about it
[1:10:29] oh god was he poured into christ
[1:10:33] does that mean there is no god
[1:10:37] well i'm in english i mean we've got
[1:10:39] school teachers here and
[1:10:41] things i've heard preachers in this
[1:10:43] message preach
[1:10:44] all god was he poured into christ
[1:10:48] see there all means all i'm not sitting
[1:10:51] there thinking my lord man
[1:10:54] wake up if all of god was poured into
[1:10:59] christ there ain't no god
[1:11:02] if that's the way you're thinking
[1:11:06] if you're thinking it that way in the
[1:11:07] human terminologies
[1:11:09] then there is god is not in no existence
[1:11:11] anymore
[1:11:14] come on make it another step all christ
[1:11:16] put in the church where's the christ
[1:11:24] but you see like i've been trying to
[1:11:25] preach to you i want a whole service
[1:11:27] about it
[1:11:28] what the more god unveils himself
[1:11:32] the more he comes into being the more he
[1:11:35] comes to a reality of a real person
[1:11:40] brother said he's not like the wind
[1:11:44] just blowing here in yonder he said he's
[1:11:46] a being
[1:11:47] yes he said well brother the wind blowed
[1:11:50] in the tree
[1:11:51] yeah okay see now you think you got
[1:11:54] smart
[1:11:57] no you come out to be a smart aleck in
[1:11:58] that terms
[1:12:01] because you're trying to destroy
[1:12:04] instead of thinking about something in
[1:12:06] the correct terminologies
[1:12:07] see oh god was he poured into christ
[1:12:10] that didn't do away with god that meant
[1:12:13] god stepped over
[1:12:16] what happened when jesus was brought
[1:12:18] into being
[1:12:22] god stepped in to jesus christ
[1:12:28] that was when he was a baby he was born
[1:12:31] to emmanuel i like the prophet in the
[1:12:33] way he said
[1:12:34] he says yo god with no teeth that gets
[1:12:36] me
[1:12:37] i just think about it see him laying
[1:12:38] there you know go go go go
[1:12:44] but you see it increases
[1:12:48] instead of decreasing it's the acts of a
[1:12:52] play yes
[1:12:53] but don't do away don't move that actor
[1:12:56] out
[1:12:57] that actor stays right exactly where he
[1:12:59] is because he's playing that part
[1:13:06] see all god was he poured into christ
[1:13:11] that didn't do away with god's existence
[1:13:13] of doing because i'm getting down to ask
[1:13:15] you some questions about it
[1:13:21] i'll get back to these in the next
[1:13:22] message i know but let me ask you a
[1:13:30] question when jesus was standing here on
[1:13:33] earth
[1:13:37] and he could talk to the father
[1:13:43] right and you know at times the father
[1:13:46] could talk to him
[1:13:50] that's why brother branham said it looks
[1:13:52] like
[1:13:54] that god has a dual personality you want
[1:13:57] these i've got almost three times he
[1:13:59] says it
[1:14:01] looks like that it's a dual personality
[1:14:05] no they can't be but one person
[1:14:08] it's dual in the basis that it's
[1:14:10] identifying what you're doing to your
[1:14:13] compared to what you're doing here like
[1:14:16] i said there are a while ago in it did
[1:14:17] you notice
[1:14:18] the river jordan brother branham says it
[1:14:21] emphatically
[1:14:22] on the river jordan that was where the
[1:14:24] fullness of the godhead came into being
[1:14:26] in jesus christ
[1:14:28] that's exactly right but where was the
[1:14:30] fullness before then
[1:14:33] jesus could not die for your sins at 3
[1:14:36] years old 10 years old
[1:14:38] 20 years older
[1:14:43] until he came into his ministry or
[1:14:46] anointing
[1:14:50] all right see then under river jordan he
[1:14:53] became the anointed messiah
[1:14:58] it wasn't that he wasn't god before them
[1:15:00] he was god but there was something about
[1:15:02] god that had not come into being
[1:15:07] i quoted a while ago was you listening
[1:15:09] matthew 28
[1:15:11] 18. we like 28-19 we'll try to travel
[1:15:14] 28-18 sometime
[1:15:18] and see okay
[1:15:21] can i do it 28 18.
[1:15:41] all right i have to find it
[1:15:48] 28 that'd be better if i'd get over a
[1:15:53] little further
[1:15:55] you're not old enough to do that yet
[1:16:02] i was getting 18 trying to find
[1:16:06] 28 and that don't work too good
[1:16:15] and there's no excuse me i'm still off
[1:16:18] on something
[1:16:24] you know the scripture somebody can find
[1:16:27] it there where jesus said
[1:16:29] who do men say i the son of man now
[1:16:34] he said dart the christ
[1:16:38] the son of the living god
[1:16:43] who was talking
[1:16:50] who was talking
[1:16:53] when you're talking who are you talking
[1:16:58] see what about it
[1:17:03] in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[1:17:06] bodily
[1:17:11] well
[1:17:15] if he is all powers given unto me in
[1:17:18] heaven and earth what i'm trying
[1:17:19] was trying to find all power is given
[1:17:22] unto me in heaven and earth where's the
[1:17:23] power of the father
[1:17:25] where's the power of the son
[1:17:30] but you see that couldn't be said all
[1:17:32] right i got it up now
[1:17:33] that couldn't be said until that time
[1:17:37] you realize you know what that is after
[1:17:40] his death
[1:17:41] burial and resurrection
[1:17:45] right come on it was after his death
[1:17:49] burial and resurrection
[1:17:50] and after it he said all power and
[1:17:54] heaven and earth is given unto me
[1:18:00] well where was the father's power
[1:18:04] there stood the father
[1:18:08] sometimes the father would speak
[1:18:10] sometimes a son speaks
[1:18:12] a dual personality
[1:18:16] you realize that if you're speaking by
[1:18:18] the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:18:21] and you say it what's the difference
[1:18:24] in you saying it and god's saying it if
[1:18:27] it's the anointing of the holy ghost i
[1:18:29] said that
[1:18:29] correct because it didn't matter if
[1:18:30] judah said it if it was anointing of the
[1:18:32] holy ghost come on just
[1:18:33] stay with me of what i'm saying
[1:18:39] if you say not if i say
[1:18:44] if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:18:48] and doubt not in your heart
[1:18:51] see then you're a dual personality
[1:18:56] you're a human being that has our
[1:18:57] quoting brother branham
[1:18:59] that has a job you go out every day
[1:19:01] working and you do it that's one side of
[1:19:02] you
[1:19:03] you have another one that when god comes
[1:19:05] in and anoints you
[1:19:07] there's something else inside of you
[1:19:09] taking over
[1:19:10] and speaking
[1:19:13] that's why that we don't get healed
[1:19:16] most of the time because we're not
[1:19:20] saying what the one inside of us is
[1:19:22] saying
[1:19:22] we're saying what the one outside is
[1:19:24] saying
[1:19:26] the one outside is agreeing with it and
[1:19:27] saying okay yeah i believe i'm healed
[1:19:29] sure i'm healed let me say it the way
[1:19:32] the prophet says it
[1:19:33] buy stripes i'm healed let me set that
[1:19:38] brother brown said a prostitute come
[1:19:39] across the platform
[1:19:42] and get healed he said a true sign come
[1:19:46] across
[1:19:46] it and fail to get it
[1:19:52] you said well how was that all right
[1:19:55] that prostitute she got down far enough
[1:19:57] inside of her to be able to say
[1:19:59] something in my inner being is saying my
[1:20:02] drops i'm healed
[1:20:06] where the other person is standing there
[1:20:07] saying well if
[1:20:09] if if brother dale would tell me i'm
[1:20:12] healed
[1:20:14] i would go say that i'm healed
[1:20:18] two brothers in this message we all come
[1:20:20] up to and two of them
[1:20:22] we were baptized the same day and this
[1:20:25] one certain brother i won't call his
[1:20:27] name but he
[1:20:28] was well known and he uh he said i
[1:20:30] believe y'all three of y'all got the
[1:20:32] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:35] well you know one brother in that crowd
[1:20:37] he said i believe i got it because he
[1:20:38] said it
[1:20:41] i said i didn't get it
[1:20:46] that's the way i said it i said i didn't
[1:20:47] get it it was almost two years later
[1:20:50] before i got it
[1:20:53] the brother was just stating what he was
[1:20:55] saying and it's tried to do
[1:20:57] say bye stripes i'm healed put your name
[1:21:00] in there donnie farbush is healed what
[1:21:02] are you trying to do
[1:21:06] you're trying to contact between the two
[1:21:08] worlds
[1:21:10] whatever you'd say i don't know you've
[1:21:12] got a world of you that's a human being
[1:21:14] and an element
[1:21:15] you've got a world that is in a
[1:21:17] christian is a set aside position
[1:21:20] and being you got to get that to where
[1:21:22] that you can bypass
[1:21:23] that's what this statue of a perfect man
[1:21:25] is supposed to do
[1:21:26] bring us to the place that we can get
[1:21:28] past that natural thing
[1:21:34] and let him say it is that what the
[1:21:35] bible says take no
[1:21:38] thought for what you shall say
[1:21:41] because it will be given unto you
[1:21:45] where from
[1:21:49] what are you going to do brother dale
[1:21:50] they come in here with a gun in the hand
[1:21:52] well i'm going to ask him can i buy it
[1:21:54] first
[1:21:57] because they're getting to where they
[1:21:58] ain't you ain't gonna be able to get
[1:21:59] them very long
[1:22:01] go try to buy some ammo right now for
[1:22:02] your gun
[1:22:04] you'll find out you
[1:22:09] national rifle association according to
[1:22:11] the paper your thoughts yesterday
[1:22:14] filing for bankruptcy
[1:22:17] that's the only fighter against
[1:22:20] taking all your weapons away
[1:22:24] and why they got to take your welcomes
[1:22:26] away let's take your ammo
[1:22:29] what good is a gun without ammo tony it
[1:22:32] don't it don't go bang bang
[1:22:33] if we don't have no ammo
[1:22:38] you say well what are you saying what
[1:22:39] are they going to do i don't know what
[1:22:40] they're going to do
[1:22:41] but i ain't going to worry about it
[1:22:46] they broke in the door when the old door
[1:22:47] was right here the old building
[1:22:50] they broke the lock actually prys it
[1:22:52] apart broke it
[1:22:54] and if it hadn't been just my eye caught
[1:22:56] it i came up here and
[1:22:58] started to unlock the door and when i
[1:23:00] did it
[1:23:02] [Music]
[1:23:04] this thing has been broken i didn't
[1:23:07] scream and holler i just come in and
[1:23:09] waited a little while then i told the
[1:23:11] church because i didn't want to scare
[1:23:12] nobody
[1:23:14] i said ain't no telling how many bugs is
[1:23:15] in this church
[1:23:18] but back then that's what they're doing
[1:23:19] they come in bugs you you know put
[1:23:21] things
[1:23:22] i said it could be everywhere i said
[1:23:25] ain't looked at all
[1:23:26] i ain't trying to look under seats or
[1:23:27] look nowhere i said because
[1:23:29] i want them to hear what we're saying
[1:23:33] i said just let them listen to what
[1:23:35] we're saying i said because they got in
[1:23:37] here
[1:23:41] we're in a day now when they don't need
[1:23:43] nothing you know what goes with the
[1:23:45] story of that
[1:23:45] there was a man came here a little black
[1:23:48] brother
[1:23:49] and he'd come to the altar ever service
[1:23:51] and screaming crying and begging
[1:23:53] for god to heal him and different things
[1:23:56] lived right over here in a tent
[1:24:01] he came for a while
[1:24:05] and one day i walked up to him and i
[1:24:06] said
[1:24:08] brother i said something's telling me
[1:24:13] that you're a government agent
[1:24:16] they sent in here to check us out
[1:24:19] he stone faced me and i knew then i had
[1:24:21] him
[1:24:22] he didn't start you know because his
[1:24:24] nature none of you remember him
[1:24:26] his nature would have been oh brother no
[1:24:28] no no he stoned face me look straight at
[1:24:30] me
[1:24:31] i said do a good job but i said
[1:24:35] tell the truth don't lie about us
[1:24:40] i said that's all i'm asking you i never
[1:24:42] told a church never you told my wife or
[1:24:44] family or nothing for three months he
[1:24:46] had done left and went on went to a
[1:24:48] church on feather in the south
[1:24:52] why because i wasn't afraid
[1:24:55] they don't need bugs now they got
[1:24:58] telephones
[1:25:00] it don't matter where it's on or off
[1:25:03] they're sitting there listening to what
[1:25:04] you're saying and that's where it's
[1:25:06] going to be they're going to come up and
[1:25:07] say did you say this you'll have to say
[1:25:09] yes i said it because there it is
[1:25:13] all right but that's that's beyond me
[1:25:16] i don't care about that i'm caring about
[1:25:18] getting you and i to a point of thinking
[1:25:20] about
[1:25:20] where we are right now if god is not
[1:25:23] complete without you
[1:25:25] then you are a part of god made manifest
[1:25:28] in a human flesh
[1:25:30] in this earth today and that's exactly
[1:25:32] what the lord jesus christ was
[1:25:34] quoting brother branham the difference
[1:25:36] between
[1:25:38] jesus and me are you
[1:25:42] he was virgin born we are not
[1:25:48] because what's the difference in your
[1:25:49] flesh what's going to be the difference
[1:25:52] when it's changed
[1:25:57] now here's my point of saying while i'm
[1:25:58] going
[1:26:01] you've got to say that you're healed to
[1:26:03] be healed
[1:26:05] you've got to say that you're saved to
[1:26:07] be saved
[1:26:11] what's wrong with saying we're already
[1:26:20] changed i'm sick
[1:26:23] well somebody strives i'm healed
[1:26:26] because the prophet preached a message
[1:26:28] and one of you brought it in many of
[1:26:29] them this way
[1:26:30] no divine healing no
[1:26:34] resurrection
[1:26:36] is that what he's saying no divine
[1:26:39] healing well if you've got to confess
[1:26:40] you're healed to be healed
[1:26:41] if you've got to confess you're saved to
[1:26:43] be saved why don't we start confessing
[1:26:45] that we're already changed
[1:26:50] you know i just can't do that well see
[1:26:52] then you're not talking about what i'm
[1:26:54] talking about
[1:26:55] right you're not talking about the god
[1:26:56] i'm talking about because the god i'm
[1:26:58] talking about
[1:26:59] could live in many many many many many
[1:27:02] positional situations or
[1:27:04] or whatever you know not personalities
[1:27:07] or persons but many ways of doing
[1:27:11] until it would finally come down until
[1:27:13] he would be
[1:27:14] made manifest
[1:27:17] because he's already went through these
[1:27:19] things
[1:27:22] is that right did the prophet say i want
[1:27:25] the doctor that's performed the
[1:27:26] operations
[1:27:27] i don't want one today perform no
[1:27:29] operation to operate on me
[1:27:31] i want somebody that's had experience
[1:27:34] well that's what i'm trying my best to
[1:27:36] do i want somebody that's had experience
[1:27:39] the experience of the baptism of the
[1:27:40] holy ghost
[1:27:46] do you believe today that you're born
[1:27:48] again
[1:27:50] what can you put it on
[1:27:54] come on i shouted i cried i spoke in
[1:27:56] tongues i've done all these times
[1:27:58] heal the sick raise the dead and do
[1:28:01] every bit of that
[1:28:02] still be lost but what's the one thing
[1:28:10] that satan cannot impersonate
[1:28:15] the opening of the word
[1:28:21] oh he can preach about it
[1:28:24] but he'll always leave you dangling
[1:28:28] i like to hear somebody talk about what
[1:28:30] i believe they know themselves
[1:28:34] hey come on hey you can't put it on this
[1:28:37] old boy
[1:28:38] this oh boy don't quote brother branham
[1:28:39] now don't start stuff like that with
[1:28:41] john and see
[1:28:42] you've got the people in the message
[1:28:43] that'll do that we ain't we ain't
[1:28:45] you know we're we we've got the message
[1:28:48] we're we're we're beyond that prophet
[1:28:50] no huh
[1:28:54] come on we're not beyond the prophet
[1:29:00] he's in the grave we're just walking on
[1:29:02] top
[1:29:06] come on things don't happen pretty quick
[1:29:08] we're going to be in the nursing home
[1:29:11] whether you've got yours picked out they
[1:29:13] could actually say our mind's already
[1:29:14] picked out
[1:29:15] parents and them has already picked me
[1:29:16] up one sent me a nanny too
[1:29:24] huh it wouldn't matter to me if they put
[1:29:27] me in one
[1:29:30] this give me a book give me a book
[1:29:34] give me my bible i can take it with me
[1:29:37] or i can have something to enjoy reading
[1:29:42] because i'm coming out one way or the
[1:29:45] other
[1:29:47] either they're going to bodily take me
[1:29:49] out or either god's going to come
[1:29:52] and change us why because he cannot
[1:29:56] leave out his bride
[1:30:03] all god was he poured into christ all
[1:30:06] christ he pours into the church what is
[1:30:07] to do
[1:30:09] to take her back to the garden of eden
[1:30:12] because they ain't now listen have you
[1:30:14] ever noticed that
[1:30:15] i mean this is the way i think i'm sorry
[1:30:17] all god was reported into christ all
[1:30:19] christ supported in the church
[1:30:20] now what are you going to do
[1:30:23] you ain't got nowhere else to pour it
[1:30:29] right oh god wasn't poured into christ
[1:30:31] and all christ reports in the church
[1:30:33] what comes next but it runs to take her
[1:30:36] back to the garden of eden
[1:30:39] all right the change the change comes
[1:30:44] what are we waiting on the change
[1:30:49] but somebody start confessing it i've
[1:30:52] never
[1:30:53] said anything bro they used two years
[1:30:55] ago
[1:30:57] they used to tell us about these
[1:30:58] brothers that was off the message
[1:31:01] well you know what we done we get in the
[1:31:04] car
[1:31:04] and we would head that away because
[1:31:08] there would be a lot of brothers that
[1:31:09] they'd be
[1:31:10] talking about you know this that and
[1:31:12] they say they're off the message well i
[1:31:14] wanted to hear
[1:31:15] from firsthand what the people had to
[1:31:18] say
[1:31:19] we've done a lot of traveling to where
[1:31:22] other people
[1:31:22] i'm not going down there and getting
[1:31:24] messed up them doctrines
[1:31:26] oh wow you already messed up i'm going
[1:31:29] down there and find out whether or not i
[1:31:30] am one of them
[1:31:34] only way i can find out if i messed up
[1:31:36] is go listen
[1:31:38] and compare it with the rest of the word
[1:31:42] so when they'd say so and throws off the
[1:31:44] word we go listen to him
[1:31:49] all right but you see church
[1:31:53] somebody is going to see it and i
[1:31:58] believe we're there
[1:31:59] i'm not throwing off nobody or nothing
[1:32:01] but i'm just
[1:32:02] making the point let's start being more
[1:32:06] positive about who we are
[1:32:12] now years ago our ideas was like this
[1:32:15] if they come in here to take you and i
[1:32:17] out then
[1:32:18] me and brother motor already had
[1:32:20] buildings to where we would
[1:32:23] we would just tell you to gather at that
[1:32:25] building
[1:32:27] we'd ride around find buildings brother
[1:32:30] moat was
[1:32:31] a brain he knew how back then to take an
[1:32:35] alternator or it might have been a
[1:32:39] one of them but you change the diodes
[1:32:42] and automatically puts out electricity
[1:32:46] it's either the alternator changed over
[1:32:47] we'll make it to the generator you know
[1:32:49] generator
[1:32:50] one one or the other you can do that you
[1:32:52] can you can change the diodes in it and
[1:32:53] make up electricity we already had to
[1:32:55] figure out how
[1:32:56] we could have lights in the building
[1:32:59] and enough food in my house to feed this
[1:33:02] whole church for a year
[1:33:08] boy we fattened up god gave terence a
[1:33:10] hog
[1:33:11] and that we fattened up that hog and
[1:33:13] that booger got up to five or six
[1:33:15] hundred pound i believe
[1:33:18] because we started feeding that food to
[1:33:20] it
[1:33:21] why because i realized hey
[1:33:25] now come on just don't misunderstand me
[1:33:27] and think i'm one of those doomsdays
[1:33:28] this
[1:33:29] that or the other because i've
[1:33:30] automatically told you now what
[1:33:32] you ought to have in your home enough
[1:33:35] food to last you a few weeks because the
[1:33:37] power can go off
[1:33:40] it would be a sensible thing to hold you
[1:33:43] up a little bit of cornmeal or something
[1:33:45] where you could have something to cook
[1:33:46] if the power goes off cause we're on the
[1:33:48] end of the line the power goes off we're
[1:33:50] weak getting the power back
[1:34:00] man we wound up with the benefits out of
[1:34:03] it because that old hog was so big
[1:34:05] i know we'll forget him he was so big
[1:34:07] until he couldn't walk
[1:34:09] and and eat he would go get at the end
[1:34:12] of the trough and
[1:34:13] struggle and get up there and he'd scoop
[1:34:15] it up
[1:34:19] well we got our money's worth i mean
[1:34:23] but still if you go to the house we got
[1:34:24] canned stuff we got food
[1:34:26] we got things in the basement i think
[1:34:28] you ought to have
[1:34:29] oh no we're gonna wait until god creates
[1:34:32] it
[1:34:34] okay go ahead
[1:34:40] but you know where to go to in case you
[1:34:43] need some food
[1:34:46] right
[1:34:50] the church listen i'm just trying to be
[1:34:52] sensible
[1:34:53] to all of us and every line in every
[1:34:58] form
[1:35:01] if in him dwelt the fullness of the god
[1:35:03] ahead bodily
[1:35:10] then how could
[1:35:13] there'd be three gods
[1:35:20] you're going to come up with two you're
[1:35:21] going to come up mess yourself up
[1:35:23] so think about it
[1:35:26] one true and living god
[1:35:31] see all it took back there was the
[1:35:32] nicean council coming up with a point of
[1:35:35] saying
[1:35:36] and they never come up with a thing of
[1:35:37] saying that jesus was not god or
[1:35:40] anything like that
[1:35:41] they said that he was a lesser form
[1:35:44] another person so they come up with the
[1:35:47] trinity and thoughts of persons and
[1:35:48] personalities
[1:35:50] they never never in nazi one of the 325
[1:35:54] never came up with the fact that there
[1:35:55] were
[1:35:56] three gods it was 606 when they
[1:35:57] developed it go study your history
[1:36:01] but think about it
[1:36:05] they thought that jesus was god
[1:36:09] in another form
[1:36:14] oh pretty close because i just said
[1:36:19] a few minutes ago that i believe that
[1:36:21] the bride is god in another form
[1:36:24] called a bride but that's not going with
[1:36:27] their ways
[1:36:28] their ways is bending down to one man
[1:36:31] and you're seeing him now he's coming up
[1:36:37] he's making statements and doing things
[1:36:42] because he knows he's going to take over
[1:36:45] all right what are we going to do come
[1:36:47] on musicians
[1:36:49] what are we going to do are we going to
[1:36:51] fold up
[1:36:54] and they come in here and say the next
[1:36:56] person that comes in here gets shot what
[1:36:57] are we going to do
[1:37:06] we'll just see what happens
[1:37:11] but you see we can make statements we
[1:37:12] can do things we can do a lot of things
[1:37:16] but just remember
[1:37:22] i've tried to explain it to you and let
[1:37:24] me say it this way
[1:37:25] the great eternal god before the
[1:37:27] foundational world kept condescending
[1:37:29] downward
[1:37:31] until he created a world and created man
[1:37:34] and then he had to stop in his
[1:37:36] creational form
[1:37:38] or creating form and went through the
[1:37:42] four thousand years but when he did here
[1:37:45] come a man walking out there
[1:37:50] it was almighty god unless you believe
[1:37:54] he said i am he you'll die in your sin
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:37:57] you know they killed him because he was
[1:38:00] saying that he was the son of god
[1:38:02] now listen listen
[1:38:07] do you realize what it means when you
[1:38:09] say you
[1:38:10] are a son of god
[1:38:18] see that's why they killed jesus
[1:38:22] you're a man making yourself god now it
[1:38:25] was god making himself a man
[1:38:27] they just didn't have it right
[1:38:30] when you say you're a son of god you
[1:38:33] realize you're god in human flesh by the
[1:38:35] way
[1:38:36] plain language
[1:38:40] and you sisters or whatever are you
[1:38:41] talking about
[1:38:44] you're god in human flesh
[1:38:48] well that's just a little bit too strong
[1:38:50] a little bit too strong for what
[1:38:52] it's what the word says it's what the
[1:38:53] bible says it's what the prophet says
[1:38:56] it's what he's taught to us when are we
[1:38:59] going to start saying it
[1:39:06] what we got let's stand
[1:39:11] a woman in the bible days
[1:39:16] her last meal almost gone
[1:39:21] but god sent elijah
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:31] what is it don't you worry
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:43] i was on the
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:53] well way is on the way you have a need
[1:39:56] it's right here now
[1:39:58] present tense
[1:40:03] brother dale i just can't say this but
[1:40:06] then i'm already changed i got too many
[1:40:08] problems
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:11] well
[1:40:14] just hold on a little
[1:40:20] help is on the way
[1:40:24] troubles of this life come by
[1:40:28] and burdens get you down
[1:40:33] you think no one is listening
[1:40:37] you think no one's around
[1:40:41] just remember what his word says
[1:40:47] trust him and obey
[1:40:50] keep your eyes towards the heavens
[1:40:55] in the name of jesus christ our
[1:40:57] brother's having to take these
[1:40:58] treatments
[1:41:00] so we ask you to sanctify the treatments
[1:41:02] and the things
[1:41:04] and make it in a reverse form to come
[1:41:05] back and make he says he's weak and
[1:41:08] you come back you give him strength
[1:41:11] you touch him because
[1:41:14] we've asked and we committed
[1:41:18] lord to you and saying by your stripes
[1:41:20] our brothers
[1:41:21] in jesus name
[1:41:32] help is on the way
[1:41:35] just hold on a little longer
[1:41:48] [Music]
[1:41:53] just remember brother hal thomas he
[1:41:55] called me yesterday
[1:41:57] maybe listening now he said brother dale
[1:42:00] i'm just
[1:42:01] losing my mind
[1:42:06] he's like 83 84 years old
[1:42:09] since i'm losing my mind i can't think
[1:42:12] right
[1:42:13] i said well we'll just pray about it
[1:42:16] we'll just pray about it because that's
[1:42:19] all we can do
[1:42:21] we can't go and do this out of there
[1:42:23] there ain't something you can do
[1:42:25] so you pray so remember brother hal
[1:42:27] thomas is

[1:42:36] pray we pray every night and then as i
[1:42:39] pray
[1:42:40] i'm asking god to touch each one of you
[1:42:44] sometimes i go down the aisles calling
[1:42:46] the names
[1:42:47] just to be personal
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:51] but you see i believe he's the healer
[1:42:56] i believe we're already healed
[1:43:01] if you're born again today you're
[1:43:02] already sealed by the baptism of the
[1:43:04] holy ghost
[1:43:07] let's start saying by stripes i'm healed
[1:43:10] these bodies are changed
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:14] he said well i don't want to lie you're
[1:43:16] lying when you
