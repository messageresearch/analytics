[9:59] 1:06 that stove the first one went under
[10:02] the whole thing's crazy the Lord of give
[10:06] thanks unto the Lord for he is good for
[10:08] his mercy endureth forever
[10:10] [Applause]
[10:17] Vesta there they keep judgment and he
[10:19] then do it watching us at all times
[10:30] then I'm asleep a good my children that
[10:34] I may rejoice my gladness as I mention
[10:36] that I made for thought with time
[10:39] inheritance our fathers understood do
[10:49] not they they wandered in Egypt they
[10:53] remember not the multitude of thy
[10:55] mercies but provoking that the city even
[10:58] at the Red Sea and he might make his
[11:05] mighty power to be known he reviewed the
[11:09] Red Sea also and he will dried out so he
[11:11] man meant to the depth as through the
[11:14] wilderness
[11:23] and the waters covered they're animated
[11:26] there was not one of them left milady I
[11:30] need is worse than exam is ready they
[11:34] soon forgot his work and they wouldn't
[11:36] not horse concert their soul society
[11:55] reward the earth open and swallow up
[11:59] Nathan and poet accompany the mayor
[12:10] captain Harold and worship the image
[12:20] if for god god they're say savior which
[12:24] had done great things in Egypt while it
[12:27] works in the land of terrible things by
[12:31] the red city therefore we said that he
[12:34] would destroy them had not Moses has
[12:39] children stood before him and agrees to
[12:41] turn away his wrath that she should
[12:44] destroy them but murderer and their ten
[12:54] and hearken unto the voice of the Lord
[13:02] enos to overthrow their seat also among
[13:07] the nation and to scare them in the land
[13:17] thus they provoke him to anger with
[13:20] inventions and the play breaking open
[13:23] men
[13:30] and there was content on to a handful
[13:34] what - that's not - all generations
[13:36] forever more because they provoked his
[13:48] spirit so they spit are not that much
[13:51] with his lips destroy the nation but
[13:59] will mingle among the heathen and learn
[14:02] their works
[14:07] yeah they sacrifice their son their
[14:10] daughter meant to do
[14:20] [Music]
[14:24] thus were they defiled with it only
[14:27] works in the mouth more under their own
[14:30] invention therefore was arrived to the
[14:34] Lord and said Lord is honored there and
[14:40] they gave to the hand many times did you
[14:54] deliver them but they provoked him with
[14:56] their counselor and were broke below
[14:58] before their iniquity and he remember
[15:07] from them his covenant or appendant
[15:10] according to the multitude perfect
[15:12] Mercy's name
[15:18] save us O Lord our God and gather us
[15:22] from among that even to give thanks unto
[15:24] the Holy Name after the triumph and I
[15:27] pray together lasting to everlasting and
[15:35] that all the people say Amen
[15:47] no matter what Israel done oh it's going
[15:51] to do today it's just still not God's
[15:57] chosen people so it doesn't matter what
[15:59] they do
[16:03] hey read this today from the Israel and
[16:07] church brother ever said now when they
[16:11] left
[16:12] Moltres dying they started off to work
[16:14] the promise man at the very not close we
[16:17] haven't got too much time but they
[16:19] started towards the promised land who
[16:21] came who came in their way
[16:23] but one day there was an old king but
[16:26] awfully excited but the bunch of Hebrew
[16:29] was coming through there through there
[16:31] and they know that God was with them so
[16:33] he went over and got a prophet to come
[16:36] in person by the name of baden-baden got
[16:39] prophet by the name of Balaam and
[16:41] baylin's straddled a little on you after
[16:45] he ate John talking not to go and you
[16:48] know he started through the writings
[16:51] mean with a couple of service he was
[16:53] born over to curse Israel sure I'll go
[16:57] take care of them
[16:59] bunch of holy rollers for you I'll fix
[17:01] them up so he got on him you know wait
[17:04] he went right down through there
[17:07] you know the mule that more spiritual
[17:10] sight than the creature because right
[17:12] Emile's so the holy ghost Bennett in the
[17:14] road with Sauron you run out into the
[17:18] field master old creatures for him for
[17:21] him really what you need today is more
[17:25] mule writing don't you believe that
[17:28] that's right
[17:28] yes there he come here on out in the
[17:31] field he saw the angel aura standing in
[17:33] the way so the next time he the holy
[17:37] both went over and there were little
[17:40] narrow strip mistook there again and the
[17:42] first thing you know began to spur the
[17:45] own view and tried to get him through
[17:47] and then you just lay right down he
[17:50] started kicking him and beating him at a
[17:52] stick and then you turn on a spoken and
[17:55] union boss and say heaven I served you
[17:59] well all this all this thing and the
[18:01] provost still was so mad never even
[18:05] noticed what the mule was saying oh my
[18:07] if God can use a tongue of the mute to
[18:10] talk surely you can use a woman they'll
[18:13] surrender himself to God Allen and now
[18:17] then the first thing he scaled up top
[18:20] the creatures eyes and look over there
[18:22] and he saw that was a man up there stood
[18:25] the Holy Ghost or the angel
[18:26] Lord in the way he went on down and he
[18:29] thought that surely he was going to
[18:31] curse those people so when he goes down
[18:33] with pieman a picture in Jude just turn
[18:38] over or turn over listen when he got
[18:41] down there he said I watched Balaam and
[18:44] beta is going to Chauvet non-integral so
[18:47] he goes and builds his altars he was a
[18:49] prophet velen would know he just showed
[18:51] me a part of Israel just the worst part
[18:55] and that's just exactly the way to build
[18:58] us today you showed you the worst part
[19:00] of the thing that's what they will show
[19:03] some of these modern preachers for
[19:06] yelling I'm sorry but you just do the
[19:12] you say if not I'll carry John Doerr
[19:15] they used to live over here you run
[19:17] awfully strong sold Wyatt go ahead
[19:20] enough of that bunch of over rose he
[19:23] didn't think about not - or - citizen
[19:26] did the same thing that's right but they
[19:28] can cover it up but listen he's showed
[19:32] him to just being just so much as Israel
[19:35] they took him back and showed him so
[19:37] much there but when it come to a place
[19:39] and Balaam he thought surely had done
[19:43] wrong they did they do wrong they've
[19:47] done everything in God's calendar wrong
[19:49] nearly but what and Balaam thought that
[19:52] a holy God will surely curse the people
[19:55] that have done that much wrong
[19:57] he thought sure surely God would do it
[20:00] so when he got done and he was so many
[20:03] crazy until he could see what the reason
[20:06] that God was
[20:09] that God wasn't cursing them and then
[20:12] each time you tried to curse them you
[20:14] would bless them
[20:15] you tell all this prophecy like that and
[20:17] instead that person it would be a
[20:19] blessing to fall back to them
[20:21] ratchet obey or what I tend to call
[20:24] Israel how great that was instead of
[20:26] course enough it was a blessing what
[20:28] Bailey tailed to see who'd want that
[20:31] modern preachers and modern people
[20:34] failed to see the holy ghost ship today
[20:36] you see I know a lot of em call them
[20:39] selves is that and the other a lot of
[20:41] things they don't admit that brothers
[20:44] they say they blow up this and they've
[20:47] done that down there that's true I'll
[20:49] admit that they done wrong but we're
[20:52] bailing failed to see that that bracelet
[20:54] serpent the spittin rock go on before
[20:57] Israel to making that old man the God's
[20:59] calling because unless they will cause
[21:03] people call them and separate them with
[21:07] a certainty for them as an atonement and
[21:10] a spitting Rock and Balaam able to see
[21:13] that and then they the modern preachers
[21:15] fail to see the power of the Holy Ghost
[21:17] to spin you subscribe they we were in
[21:20] his body by one spirit are we all
[21:23] baptized into one body and our members
[21:27] of the party
[21:34] and the message the common start brother
[21:36] Brent said he said don't worry the fig
[21:39] tree is putting forth his buddy
[21:41] that's the last sign that sign oldest
[21:45] flag in the world plays over Jerusalem
[21:48] she's a nation of her own mouth with her
[21:50] own army she was blinded for a little
[21:52] season but she's coming together in I
[21:54] promise it the an event gentle will be
[21:58] then they are looking for a messiah I
[22:02] like this part
[22:03] you know God was at one time can you
[22:06] forget Israel he said haha this disguise
[22:09] a deep is the earth measure the Prophet
[22:12] said I can't he said neither can I ever
[22:15] forget Israel it's an apple on my own
[22:20] I know this is the last time jesus said
[22:30] when you see the fig tree when the
[22:32] fourth is but no one at the time is nigh
[22:35] even at the door it really began to be
[22:38] restored they got their own mind
[22:40] about four weeks ago she is her own
[22:42] currency
[22:43] everything she's the whole nation what a
[22:45] weight if all of this was in it
[22:50] sixty
[22:56] because of this it was sort of was
[22:59] always a type of the church that was the
[23:01] church national business church
[23:02] spiritually they were called out and as
[23:05] soon as they were called out they passed
[23:07] through the Red Sea baptized on the
[23:09] motor and it suddenly came on the other
[23:11] side they were baptized now the spirit
[23:14] Marian picked up tambourine and down the
[23:17] bank she went dancing hallelujah yes sir
[23:20] she had the victory we sure ever get
[23:23] that much all right
[23:24] she was dancing in the spirit and all
[23:26] the daughters of Israel follow her
[23:27] dancing
[23:28] Moses stood with his hands up and sang
[23:31] in the spirit
[23:44] speak to the rock now we're going to
[23:47] talk about Germany how God brought his
[23:50] people out of Egypt into the Promised
[23:52] Land perfect type leaving sin and coming
[23:55] to the spirit blame
[23:57] now there's three stages of the journey
[23:59] first Israel in Jupiter
[24:02] Egypt Israel in that journey Israel and
[24:05] Palestine we should perfect type
[24:07] justification by faith coming up thank
[24:11] the petition as they pass through their
[24:13] blood and baptism the Holy Ghost is
[24:15] perfect the stages of the church and I
[24:18] believe the meeting is ahead right now
[24:20] it's going to bring the gospel to the
[24:22] Jews again in Palestine and then a
[24:25] Gentile is finished
[24:27] my name's you Jews received the Holy
[24:29] Ghost again in Palestine you Gentiles
[24:33] are finished your screen proud to do
[24:36] whatever you want to but mercy has truly
[24:38] starting to Israel again that's right a
[24:40] Gentile goes down the wall not till they
[24:43] can tell dispensation we'll be finished
[24:46] and then it's over for you so you right
[24:50] now is God you sure that's right
[24:54] [Music]
[24:57] the message Redemption and completeness
[25:00] we take the Israel 9 their journey
[25:03] coming out of Egypt top of the world on
[25:05] their way to Palestine that promised man
[25:07] I think it's a beautiful beautiful thing
[25:09] I just love it
[25:11] 39a a week I sit down and read through
[25:14] the book Exodus I like to put that I
[25:19] actually like to talk about Moses
[25:21] because I can't talk and if I can or as
[25:30] much as I can my daughter because her
[25:32] type of the church today the condition
[25:34] and how God is moving and moving then
[25:37] well he did it and that's well then he's
[25:39] doing this critter last year not only
[25:42] Israel that natural where they see look
[25:46] move them out of a certain man into
[25:48] another natural and now we're moved by
[25:51] the Holy Spirit and born now into the
[25:53] Promised Land
[26:00] and the message impeccable gods both
[26:03] work
[26:04] remember when arab-israel went down into
[26:07] each other they never lost their
[26:09] covenant they just lost their blessing
[26:11] their covenants Gus come and stay the
[26:14] same you're sure God already made it
[26:17] with Abraham no matter where they go
[26:18] he'll still still made it that's right
[26:22] it's still there
[26:31] in that sheet they see supper says duh
[26:36] and they seat opposite the gate of
[26:39] enemies and the scripture said that when
[26:40] we were getting Christ we become Abraham
[26:43] see Paul speaks of it that which which
[26:48] is Jew non Jew in relief a Jew what were
[26:52] able Jew Emory therefore kid you were
[26:55] born of the Spirit are your Abraham see
[26:59] or hear that Abraham according to the
[27:02] promisee
[27:12] every problem the God gave Abraham is
[27:14] just because virginity or Abraham seen
[27:19] here more of a Jew than you would be to
[27:21] have born in the Jewish blood and then
[27:24] be an art photography in that church and
[27:27] deny that precious Holy Spirit or Jesus
[27:30] Christ
[27:31] you're more of a Jew because you're a
[27:34] Jew there's bones of a promise from
[27:37] heaven whose God gave Abraham and
[27:39] Abraham accepted that my faith and
[27:41] that's what made him what he was after
[27:44] all a Jew be just a separation and
[27:48] crossed over even or so forth attest
[27:54] marriage of the land Abraham's seed with
[27:58] Isaac
[28:05] every time see Isaac which was Jewish
[28:09] that and natural but the bro seed was
[28:12] Christ through the promise and that was
[28:14] Christ was does work mate meant that in
[28:18] it innocent our hearts today that we eat
[28:21] abide in me and our
[28:23] that's what you will have be done for
[28:26] you for sinking on
[28:30] why didn't he manifests himself Jesus
[28:32] when he was on earth to a gentleman that
[28:34] same sign to show that because the
[28:37] Gentile were looking for no Messiah the
[28:41] Jews were looking for a messiah and the
[28:43] Samaritans were different aside in the
[28:46] demon assist manifested himself as the
[28:49] Messiah until Peter when he preached the
[28:52] kingdom and blind environment on his
[28:56] face stuff him and their woman with
[28:59] about issue support of the Jews but here
[29:02] is now before the Samaritan and he comes
[29:04] to this America himself know that the
[29:07] truth Messiah now for for hundreds of
[29:11] years for true sense Americans have
[29:13] believed that theirs was coming in
[29:16] Messiah so the Messiah was on earth
[29:18] itself to and massage to manifest
[29:20] himself
[29:28] Church choosing north of grace that's
[29:31] the way it is today that's the way it
[29:33] was four years ago with our fathers of
