like traveling home well it's a great day to be traveling great time to have to where you can do it Howard that we're leaving you know it ought to be moving on because the words moving home right thank God for the word amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord we're glad to have brother he's read with us to minister for us today and we'll wait just a little bit more cuz some are coming up and getting into it so make sure you get everything today in together and knowing where you're going and how you going cause it's gonna be a man's going one way the women go in another way then you know so we're gonna have a good time out of it but it's a good time for a Father's Day so we say to all of you fathers you got a blessing an opportunity to be a father man so that's the best thing into let's just give all the father's a good yeah we appreciate brother Colley sitting there while ago that man just run a red light right in front of it and we you know you can get killed in a hurry so we thank God for taking care of him right I think that the angels will guard her and count about those who fear Him so I believe that they're having more work to do now the older we're getting you know the more that they're having to be called on duty to come forth the helm and introdu but good to see everybody glad to have sister Reed back there with us of all of these with us and as his father's day well you know it it's an opportunity of a Father's Day so well I guess it's surprise to announce there's going to be a father among us pretty quick and I haven't figured out yet for you know what it's gonna work out to because they say they don't know yet but we're talking about brother Kern and sister Trudy okay so when they find out whether it's a girl or boy I'll know where I'm uncle arranged see that that'll make it all work out there will no high other things to go in Tesla but we appreciate the father sufficient opportunity to be able to know who our father really is because he you could have been like I was they offered to adopt us out when I was a child you know about four or five years old because Dad died and they wanted to adopt us out well maybe material wise I would have been in good shape because of know the person that would have would have been the one to adopt us out but that still would have changed a lot of things and it's not not to be but you know because of all of that I found out who my true father is the natural father is wonderful that's good the Father's Day we give the gifts we do the cards we do everything but a real father is the lord himself so we thank God for brother Reed coming in minister for us today and with us just saying open her out of our heart as he comes on diminished her the word was older we were just waiting for a few more to come in never open the eyes of my heart [Music] I won't [Music] me [Music] amen praise God only glad to be in the house of the Lord certainly when I thank God for His mercies towards us and for always affording us this privilege to be in his house he may not say like them of all I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord amen and I say to their fathers this morning and the potential fathers happy Father's Day Amen praise God hallelujah it's a wonderful experience being a father and you know I think I certainly thank God for that experience of being a father myself and really loved the children but and it would be good to have more but then the girls come with mouths and they talk so much so you've might get a wear a hearing aid so we're satisfied with what you've got amen praise God so god bless you and for those of you don't know me I'm just a simple person from down in Jamaica I mean we certainly thank God for the fellowship and for the Brethren that we have here we've had many many years of fellowship and growth and we certainly thank God for that amen more than ever we thank God for the purpose why we know each other and why we're friends is because of the Word of God amen had it not been for God's Word we would have never cross each other's paths but because God has sent us a voice in this day amen praise God hallelujah so I'm just greet you all and thank God for your fellowship and for your support over the years and trust God that he would bless you and me Lulla grow from strength to strength amen praise God we want to go to the word this morning I'd like to read first from the book of Acts chapter three and as we find this morning we want to speak to the author of the word Amen just want to thank God him I've always thought of myself as you know very disorganized kind of a preacher you know I was in Ghana and the brother said to me and said brother Keith I mean I can't believe you still preach from papers and notes and all of that really it seems to them I was kind of backward that's all right you know I'm the kind of person who will step into the office and getting ready to preach and then ah ah I just got the message praise God so I mean if God deals with everybody differently and we just thank God for our Portia let us bow heads everywhere our gracious God enough father Lord we want to thank you for this grand privilege that we have Oh God you have brought us together at a time like this Oh God and an hour like this Lord God - Lord reveal you to your people heavily father Lord God we we're under expectation always for you God that Lord we're not just Paul to have Church but we called Oh God to pick you're a bride for a rapture and Lord God as we walk Lord God we know that along the path we deviate Lord God is destruction along all paths what Lord God when I keep to that straight and narrow path of God that lead to life everlasting Lord God we pray that you'd bless us O God this morning to the the heady fiying of the body of Christ Lord remember those that are without - this morning Lord God we pray that you would bless O God give us a godly example by your word God we pray blesses now when we thank you for all things and believe you speak to our lips and may the years that would be anointed hear your word of God today and Lord God may be an experience for a walk as we pray believing in Jesus name Amen and amen you know I was just in in Ghana and I was looking at the different custom of people you know you know everywhere we do things a little different and so you know I was there and you know I realized that when somebody died the customs and so really you know what they do brother we'd the day before the funeral you know they would have gone to the funeral home and it's a fanfare and they go and they collect the body and they take it home and they set it up in the house or they set it on the veranda and they said you know if the person was a tailor they put him in front of a machine and give him a crouch and all of that and they kept him on to tomorrow so I went you know III could hear them you know playing the music and so from where I was staying and I walked there because I wanted to see what is I'm a very inquisitive kind of a person and when I go I saw this guy you know just crouching up in a chair really and I thought it was somebody alive I didn't know that's the guy that was dead and so they they kept that for three days yeah well they they buried the body the next day but they keep that music and everything for three days and I realized what it is it's like the people from the community they go and they everybody don't need money and after three days the family come together and they count upon which they have because that's when they pay for the funeral where I tell you you know I could be with the guy I could collect all the money but I didn't want that dead person in the house you know it doesn't matter how much you love each other man there's something about debt you know you there's a separation incidentally we have one of our sister you know died just about two two weeks ago and she was 15 years ago she was actually in an accident a very serious accident she was going to the market and you know the the car at an a crash and there were seven persons in the vehicle and six of them died she was the only person that survived really and so 59 years after God took her you know and so we certainly thank God for life and so and so we were going back to do the funeral in July it's a why so long that's what we do it in Jamaica you would have where the first in three days of manner to us that's like disrespect if we love you keep it for long deal of the lordís morning shake somebody and said god bless you god bless you amen in Acts chapter 3 let me read from verse 12 of Acts chapter 3 and when Peter saw it and answered the people Heymann of Israel why Marvel II this or why look he saw earnestly at us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk the God of Abraham but of Isaac and of Jacob the god of Our Fathers has glorified His Son Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let him go but he denied the Holy One and the just and desired murderer to be granted on to you and killed the Prince of life whom God has raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses I'm glad to be a witness this morning reign and his name true fate in his name has made this man strong whom he see and know Eve the faith which is by him as given him the perfect soundness in the presence of you all and now brethren I wot that through ignorance he did it as did also your rulers but this but those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all the it's that Christ should suffer and ask so fulfilled repent he therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the Evin must receive until the time of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began for Moses truly said unto the father's a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall he hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and he shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people yay and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many as a spoken of likewise foretold of these days he are the children of the prophets and of the Covenant which God made with our fathers are saying unto Abraham and in thy seed shall all the Kindred's of the earth be blessed unto you first God having raised his son Jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquity Amen hallelujah may the Lord life is blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated I would like to speak this morning on the New Testament church the New Testament church this is not Judaism no this is not the Church of the Pharisees or the Sadducees no this is a church which begins on the day of Pentecost amen and the Prophet says that hallelujah the church that started on the day of Pentecost has no end in other words Pentecost he says as a beginning it has no handle and so we've got to realize of a church that we're in today is a Pentecostal church amen you know they said Pentecost hallelujah is a shouter and so I'm glad that I'm not afraid of a shout Amen as a matter fact we shout a lot hallelujah because we're that church where the continuation of the church which begins on the day of Pentecost the Bible says and when there were nice abroad hallelujah him and they came and they speed they said these men look like they're drunkard he said we're not drunk as you suppose but this is that which was spoken their lies manifesting in that time was updating the scripture hallelujah amen of the prophets here we are today and I tell you the way that church was that's the way this church ought to be hallelujah amen still believing in the power of Almighty God the Bible said that the Word of God comes not in words only but in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost are you there with me and then I find that the problem among us today is that we don't have the faith to exercise in the power of God amen we know what it is fundamentally hallelujah but we don't exercise our faith in God's Word hallelujah and so the prophet of God Center now do we get into that church he said for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body which is the body of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah we don't come into the church buyer and shaker we don't come in by association we don't come in by all of us or who we love no sir we come in one way is that right certainly when we're gathered together there's a multitude and then there are those that are born again and there are those that are not born again him in these young people sometimes of the church where they're there because their parents are made them to be there but in the body of Jesus Christ we come in by the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it means that every one of us must know who Jesus is is a central theme of our experience him and I was reading last night in question and answer 1964 somebody wrote a question he said brother branham you know they said that hallelujah you're not just a normal man you are Jesus Christ and brother Branham said you know he said if you take that literally the weights said he said that's the greatest error but he said but yet you've got some truth you see what he did he did not put it all on himself he said but you that as Christ in you it's another Jesus Christ on the face of the earth if we can take it like that you see the problem with the people is that they put everything on the prophetic for rudder and nothing on the bride but Roux Liam brand was not the object of Christ coming in this day know you are that of the object of that are you here with me hallelujah he's not the continuation of Christ you are the continuation of Christ is the writer he come to bring us to a position is the rod but if we don't become that word then all that is failure is the writer hallelujah so you know you begin to tell us er him in our God is known are you there with me in the message believe us know this some sir my brother you can have this to it 6004 0 to him in paragraph 74 I'd like to take this really remember of this organize he said where do they find him where did they find Jesus right where they left him where did they leave him at the feast of Pentecost hallelujah amen where do we leave Jesus where did the church at the feast of Pentecost when we get away from that old-time Pentecostal power him in the feast of Pentecost we walk away from Jesus that's exactly right friends we are living on our privileges amen yes sir him and they left him at the feast of Pentecost and there's only one place that Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals will ever find him is go back where you left him at is that right where is the joy of the Lord I would ask that this morning where is the joy of the Lord hallelujah because wherever God is this joy where is the power of our Lord the church acts today what happened to God of history a man is waiting for his people to call him on the scene again is the writer and we can't do it payment through denominations no sir because when we get to denominations we're taking some man's idea over the Word of God his errata we can't do it on the psychology no sir because we're looking at the traits of men hey man we can't do it under artist thematical or we can't do it with education no sir we separate ourselves divide ourselves we are not divided we are one person indeed in Christ Jesus we are all one in Christ and our denominations will never do it as good as they are they won't do it our education is the greatest endurance to the gospel ever is that right amen what we need is not education we need the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost back into the church to demonstrate the power amen Jesus never said going to all the world hallelujah hey many he said going to the world and teach he never said going to the world and do he said going to all the world and preach the gospel and the gospel it's the demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost is errata the resurrection we are still a million miles short where we should be let us move forward let's go back to where we left him at the feast of Pentecost Jesus said in John I believe a 15 chapter he said I am the vine ye are the branches well now if that vine put forth the first branch and out of that branch wrote a book of Acts he said the second branch will make another book of Acts and the third branch will make another book of action is a rod hallelujah and every branch that comes out of that vine will be the same branch amen he said no notice he said the vine does not bear the fruit it is a branch that bear the fruit hallelujah so if we're waiting said well when Jesus come back this is gonna happen you see that's what the people who go and brother branham come back we'll see the power again but what about the power that God has invested in you this is a church in action is it run where do we take our yardstick not from what somebody says oh we find that this kid grow up on our land because people said well if you see a certain thing they said ah you're trying to be like the Prophet what if the Prophet that being like Jesus Paul said follow me as I follow Christ is the right amen so where are we going to be we are going to be another book of action that's a New Testament church amen hallelujah him in 1947 faith is a substance hallelujah paragraph 69 he said God is not in material things no sir God is in men you know where the church has gone today him and apostles are pulling for more and more and more riches and they're preaching a gospel of prosperity you you know your your blessing is in your catalog in the parking lot your blessing is in your cabin upon the hill your blessing is in material things but brethren I say to you if the blessing of God is a material things that you have then those that are outside of Christ and more than you've got think about it amen that is not your blessing no sir I've got a suit on because I work and buy one yes if you labor there's something that goes with it it's a Rotter maybe that's not the blessing of God I'm coming there down to it these are the Holy Ghost never fall an organization it fell on men and so many people today say they don't belong to my fate well if you're the fate of Christ it's all the same God doesn't care about he said our organization don't mean anything that to him and he said the people got their self to a place it's just a big organized world and it that's the reason I'd rather have it in an auditorium he said if it's with the oneness Church the Trinity won't come if it's a Trinity Church the oneness won't come if it's the Methodists their Baptist won't come if it's in a Baptist Church the Methodists won't come hallelujah one body one person said should we be baptized over now in order to comma to be prayed for mercy that's as pagan as we can ever get that's right now he said for by one spirit we're all but into one body brethren there's only one way justification sanctification that baptism of the Holy Ghost put you into the body of Jesus Christ amen and that means whether you're first generation second generation third generation it doesn't matter what generation it's the same way and it will never change amen he's a regardless of who you are and where you are that's right so it doesn't make any difference what organization you are you don't have to belong to Baptist Church or Methodist Church or Pentecostal or whatever it is you have to have faith in God and frankly you don't have to belong to no church but you've got to heal and go sing them again and no sin again it will come on you again worse than it was in the first place you go somewhere then to church and serve God God don't heal you for the devil's glory I wish we were to hear that amen you see people want to be healed they want deliverance but they don't want the God of the deliverance then they want to be healed so they can go back and sit at the bar stool and drink their beer they don't want God they want to give from the giver but they don't want to give up in the message hear him he said God don't save you to lose you he'll be defeating his purpose because sometimes we make heaven so high and so glorious now the common people can't walk into it I was in a missis meeting and they were talking about the simple salvation and I'll tell you a man that being in this message for over 30 years and I hear some ministers talk about salvation I wouldn't know what to go in there finish I wouldn't know what to do amen because they're so deep I don't understand what they're saying but the Bible said but by one spirit are we all baptized into one body Oh glory to God yes sir a man I'll tell you the truth amen you know we put such a standard a mean you know we dig so deep until we say it and we say that we say that and the children don't know what to do amen but the Bible it says believe on the Lord Jesus and you and your household shall be saved amen that I like is that right amen expectation 1950 paragraph 10 he said and the teachers here of the scripture will teach you these things that's 9 spiritual gift in the church now brethren the New Testament church must be the church that begins on the day of Pentecost amen hallelujah do you believe the Scriptures are right you know somebody said well you're going back to the shock and there was power when they shot that's not in the seed there's something runs somewhere amen because brethren when we leave here in a rapture there be not one fever one among you who will we ever get there I tell you church divine healing is a minor but it's a harvest of your resurrection and if there's no divine healing there's no resurrection is a Roger although we said all yes I believe yes I believe now put your faith in action there's a rod there's a ministry for the New Testament church there's nine spiritual gifts in the church they operate any in the church for instance if this stood here tonight concealed the entire body of Christ the Holy Spirit leave the body of Christ and in this body there's nine spiritual gifts hello is that the Bible are you there with me hallelujah they are here in the body gifts of healing give some prophesy and then it might fall upon someone here tonight I mean this lady sitting here this man or this man and he may give a prophecy and it would be true but it won't never work on him maybe again it might come back other me pause and then no here is it now we're not making profits we're not making healers we're not making people with the wine of wisdom but wherever the New Testament church is this nine spiritual gifts in the church Oh hallelujah we can go back to the fivefold ministry and the fivefold ministry has got his position in the church it's for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ until we all come to the stature of a perfect man but when the word has gone fault brethren what are the people becoming our very name in the church when he says in the church when Paul said in the church he did not mean in the fivefold ministry higher very may brethren if there's a sick person in the church and we would agree together and pray and believe brethren what will we be when we come to a stage where somebody's sicker and we can't put food to arm outer remember we're not see God and storm the porters of glory but until we have an answer that's a New Testament church I remember I was over there in in Liberia just a few months after the World Health Organization had declared ebola-free then they said in the church there was only one person that called the disease but the pastor of the church he said when the government was calling to the churches pray pray for our nation when one person in the church contacted the disease he said we will not leave Church we will not get out of here we're gonna fast and pray unto God mover it was three days and after three days of fasting / there was no more Ebola the brother was totally healed Zaki said new testament church hello where did we get to here we're bound the Holy Ghost in the church we found the power of God and we've got all kind of excuse white should not be oh brother you shouldn't shout so loud you shouldn't say man this is when you ought to say it you're gonna wait until I'm finished with a statement then you say men you know sisters you gonna say maybe a little bit more poison hallelujah we try to make it as the church by your own understanding what we need is Liberty in God's house by the power of God can operate amen and I'll tell you when a people don't know how to pray then the church will be powerless amen hallelujah glory or break it you're passionate I'm passionate about God's word Amen hallelujah amen so now you know you said all so you trying to be a prophet uh-uh but what if the word of that come through you well what were you going to do amen well what if the words of knowledge is it scriptural come on with me hey do we forbid to speak with tongues come on with me hello do we bind interpretation then brethren that's the New Testament church right it's a rat how are you gonna get back to it it was there in the book of Acts it was there in brother branham's ministry then what about the church today Oh hallelujah my my see that doesn't make him a prophet I continued the quote amen where in the body and by one spirit we have that sighs did the body and subject to the gifts and then then what other gifts nine spiritual gift in the church amen we're always leaning to a certain brother and we said this brother's got a certain gift so we're going to call this brother over to preach and we expect that gift to operate but brethren in the New Testament church it wasn't exactly like that no when the people hear the word they become the word yeah and if you're hearing it every day and you're not becoming what you're hearing it's not doing it oh good amen the Word of God must bring it to a position is that right Oh hallelujah Brenton art a water Haman there are to be in the church mother's because they are mothers Haman they know the pain of Haman upbringing falter and they know how aiming to intercede for our children there's got to be fathers Haman like Jacob ah Haman that will put the thing before God God if you do these things you're going to be my god are you very mayor maybe there's got to be people who carry the not the body of Christ your burden is not just to pay your tides and come and sit down no you are the Word of God amen hallelujah glory and when the body's setting here remember that Paul said if something be revealed to one sitting by let him hold his Pisa and so forth you know he's sitting order like that amen that's the apostolate Church that's where it should be now Oh hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelujah amen brethren I'll tell the church had been order until the power of God start to move amen I'd like to see a church rise in power because God has energized the people I'd like to see a people hear the word amen become so convinced of the Word of God that they're becoming the word and the word is becoming them are you fearing man because the blood is for that is it wrought hallelujah it's not by my education no sir it's by faith that I know God and I'll tell you when you're in tune with God hallelujah you don't need nobody to teach or to tell you what you are to do because the Spirit of God grant water runs in the house of God amen hallelujah oh can you take and Holy Ghost fill man and tell him that listen Amy you've got a quench the Spirit of God in you and come and sit and listen to the tape know listen who or we thank God for what he has done in this hour we thank God for the word listen there's not a subject that we can have need of that Malachi 4 revelation 10 7 has not dealt with that we can go back and see are you feeling me but God the fire of God has not quenched in the house of God him in there are men that are filled with the Holy Ghost amen to preach the are you doing there and this people are filled with the Holy Ghost amen to receive the Word of God and become the Word of God when we said ministry hey man it's not just a faithful ministry the church has got a ministry there's a writer and when the world has gone thought then your ministry now comes into action is that right oh you don't tell that's a pastor's problem so enjoys it but that's the pastas problem that's the Evangelist brother and you go to your home and you eat your chicken and everything is all right no we have the body of Jesus cried we carry the burden of the house of God let us think about the church when we come together on a Sunday morning we come with the burden of the body of Christ on recitation does he got mover amen hallelujah you see the fire that came on the day of Pentecost never quench no never quencher he continued on his errata Peter was still in June aimin to hear from God hallelujah and when was time for the Gentiles amen the father said acts 10 Oh carnelian hallelujah was a good and just man a man that gave us to God and the people hallelujah and the angel of God came to him and God working on to answer him and then coming to Peter hallelujah in Simon's house the Tanner hallelujah haven't seen the sheet coming down Peter Selassie all kind of four-footed beasts and creatures and saw and the voice said rise Peter kill Anita

only but God is a fate he's a Rotter hallelujah and they said all that were drunk with the Holy Ghost they said it doesn't matter what nature what country hallelujah they mean what race of man is where he's drunker he behave the same way men who are drunk are loving amen they're drinking from the same class hugging and crying all over the blues because they're drunk and when you're drunk in

pray you're the only man that preach like that but you don't get no complex brother the way you preach you're the only man that preach like that is it rah you know we might have thoughts from each other amen because the same spirit of 19 it's a wrath but I don't want you to be like me I don't want to be like you no sir God give us different ministry it's all funny body of Jesus Christ one brother come to tell me what brother key when he was preaching he said this he said I said leave him alone Ezra when a man has no other alternative to do wrong just leave the man alone brother branham such 771 matter does that amount to anything well what if it was 700 or 7,000 what would that be that's not the point all you know what he missed caught so we won't listen him again come on with me brethren there's more to it than that we're worried about the little fencer and the things that we should be focusing on it's not happening amen do you feel cancer sooner diabetes your problem that doesn't dr. declare high blood pressure what are you doing about it we take a whole bottle of tablets and we've got a God we preach about that is a God of healing and we all accept that's your feet you take it until you die amen hallelujah somebody says you see people preaching about him and faith healing I tell them go prove it hey but I say it like this I will pray for the sick and I expect them to be healed and brother when our prayer if the sick not heal it's not my business the Bible said is there any sick among you let them call for the elders of the church let them anoint them with oil and the prayer of faith shall save this is that the scripture when I keep god's word i don't worry about that's God's business no amen but God will honor his own word but brother Branham said it doesn't matter how much i pray for you if you don't believe you'll never be healing here so do we quit preaching it because somebody don't believe i still preach it because God is a healer amen I just come up from Ghana hallelujah and two things that bother the people there it's malaria and epi' Titus and you brought this person oh what's the problem hepatitis C I don't know what that is man I'd have to go google and research and final but I just got convinced myself that's a demon that needs to be get rid of her and pray and it's a brother kita the person is totally well I said that's the power of God you know brother Branham could go back and brother grandma say depression is a demon like a dark shadow and he said one was like aiming a turtle with curved legs and and all of that really listen I can't see all of that but I don't need to see the boy is and the Lord that healeth thee that's a New Testament church Alleluia and Brigitte Ottawa in first Corey gets to 13 but though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I become a son in brass and a tinkling cymbal and though I give up my body to be burned and do I feed the poor and have not charity it profits me nothing amen hallelujah we're not saying this is a hallmark but I said the New Testament church was of the power of God amen hallelujah in the three witnesses 1951 through 728 paragraph 10 now there's a body and in this body we're baptized by the Holy Ghost into this body and made partakers of God and of eternal life and that is the essence of it really we are made by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're made partakers of God and of eternal life through the gift of God which is a free gift of God given to all so ever we'll let him come amen know that put us in the body and when we're in the body in that body is nine spiritual gifts or spiritual gift operating is a right and it will come upon one I better leave the subject alone let's see I never come here to teach I come here to talk to pray for the sick it might be a little against your theology theological teaching you see but anyhow God be with you and help you and bless you is my pearl alright amen hallelujah first Corinthians twelve by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body become members of that body hallelujah and brother Branson and in that body this nine spiritual gift in the early church here it was that the Bible said they had all things in common you see the attitude of the early church is that any day they were going to be taken in a rapture that's the attitude they were ready to go that they did not know that we would still be here no sir that table every day was tomorrow and so they they sell what they had Halloween they distributed that all may not all things in common and didn't command the people to do it but out of love people are doing that because the charge of the gospel had put an anointing over the people and Ananias and Sapphira they sold what they had but they didn't have the fit to do like others do and so they thought within themselves well you know I mean if anything happened and this thing will work out we want something to run back to it's like you're coming into a field marriage until you into a marriage like that it's going to feel you know when she says you know I'm gonna keep this because if the marriage will work out I want to have something to come back to and and if he says daddy leave my room they're vacant because if it don't work and I'm you're gonna go back to that room because you don't go in it with all your heart I'm not here to preach that I'm just saying this if there's a way out you're gonna find a way out amen when you come to crisis like a marriage and yell so here in an a sense of farah nobody tell them to do it but you see they did what they didn't you know he comes in to the apostles and he think that well this is just Pete and the rest of them and he said we were so little and this is all we got Peter said man why you lied to the Holy Ghost because he thought that when he comes to church it was Pastor Dan and pastor wind and pastor black and you know buzzer he thought it was just them II didn't realize catch the revelation that is the holy gloss that is leading the church so he thought that if I just say that everything is alright and right there in the presence of the Holy Ghost he dropped dead and they lift him and they take him out a church and his wife never realized what was happening you know she was checked chatting to the girls in the other side you know when the woman come to church what they do and so she now comes in and says hey you know you he's solely because that was a plan and there's all we got he said the same man's that carry out your husband they're gonna carry you out too because they lie not to the men of God but they lied to the Holy Ghost brethren when we realize that it's a Holy Ghost that operates the church then our action would be different amen cuz there's some people that love their pasta to debt and there's some people that heat is good because he preached a message one time and it stepped right on their tour and they'll never forget that hallelujah I tell you one thing people have to same anywhere you go on Wednesday night I was saying something in church and this morning I was in a dream and I was dreaming the same thing and Ron I was dreaming Frenchie wake me up and you know last week I was dreaming and he you know it's a wife and a husband the husband was in that dream and she woke me up and now the wife was in this dream and she woke me up this morning so mom what kind of woman is this but I was still in the church you know I remember two times were the way they had something to honor me as their pasta and you know it was fine that they did that or they even add that thought to do it really but I felt crushed inside and bliss is why I felt crushed it's not the people that are there that come to give you know say something nice about you is those that did not come because they think I mean why should we do this to our pasta your unibrow weird across your feelings laugh you you know they don't that somebody don't like me and it's not a thousand that like it's not one that show you that they really hate your guts and in the dream this morning I was telling the sister they hate your guts it's a pastor's wife but I was saying to her they eat your gut as a human you feel it but you gotta pray for them in here and she should walk you out of the sleep amen so I might as well tell you I don't know it might be for somebody here somebody's gonna hit your guts but you prefer them in here it's Christ in you the New Testament church had come into a body that there were a family together as one in the church there was no big I I know little you everybody had all things in common that the minister of the church becomes that they gave to those who did not have and the stronger support the weaker because there were a family together brethren that's what the church ought to be today but the church is not just a mechanical setting the church is a spiritual supernatural body moving with the impulse of Christ that brother Branham said if you say that I'm Jesus Christ he said that's pagan that's an hero but if you say that we want Jesus Christ and musasa he said you're perfectly right don't put it all in the past of the preacher the farfel ministry because the body of Christ is moving with the same impulse of Christ and what a day when we are so affected by the Word of God at the same time of the same amount of time the minister's fanta with God to bring you a message use spend the same amount of time in Perth and focus that God would speak to me when I get to the else of God what a church that is going to be and I say it would fit because that is where we're going we're going to get to a day when the skeptic obnoxious the unbeliever is gonna leave us you see yesterday we thought that the greater position of the message it's gonna be from way outside of the message today we realize the very core hello the very call the central call because God is saying to you and i trusting nothing but in my word the new testament church will not be an organization no sir no sometimes than the message we're in circles this is my little circle and we fellowship with this one and that one and that one over there and that one don't there and outside of that we don't finish with nobody you know brethren i don't agree with all men but I respect call me for that which God has given to them amen and even the man that you figured that you know he ain't got much to say that God has so anoint him that is able to edify the body of Jesus Christ because what we need in the Church of God today is not a Leawood no no no we don't need a preacher with a lot of fare a flair we need somebody that hears from God amen and if we can get somebody that hears from God then God is satisfied with what we do Amen hallelujah so we go back to the scripture first Corinthians chapter 12 let me just take from verse 1 of 1st Corinthians chapter 12 now concerning spiritual gifts brethren I would not have you ignorant now here is the Apostle Paul speaking to the church in the first church amen to the Corinthians you know that you are Gentiles carried away with dumb idols even as you were lid where if I give you to understand that Norman speak by the Spirit of God called Jesus a curse and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost in other words it's not just saying it out of your mouth but speaking by revelation that that's what it really means amen now there are diversities of gifts by the same spirit and there are differences of administration but the same Lord now brethren let me pause by saying this a lot of people think that this creature is no no longer applies to us they said with with pass this really well brethren let me tell you if the nine gifts of the Spirit kept that first clean back then then we certainly need it today amen and there divert and there are diversities of administration by the same Lord and their diversity ZUP of operation but it is the same God which work at all in all but the administration of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal for by one is given the spirit of the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy how will it work to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongue but all these worketh that one and the same cells spirit dividing to every man severally as he will and I believe that the New Testament church will still have the nine gifts of the Spirit amen I don't believe that that day's pass because I don't believe that the days of miracles pass I don't believe that the days of tongues has passed I don't believe that prophecy or interpretation is fast I believe we are still in the cycle of the New Testament church amen because how can we accept no verse 12 but we don't accept everything that comes before that are you there with me for as the body is one and has many member and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by once for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into that one spirit you see the Spirit of God therefore and brother Boyd is a same spirit of God in me and it's the same spirit of god in brother Terrence is the same spirit of god in brother kern what does that mean it means that our actions are the same are you there with me because it's the same spirit for the body is not one member but many members no hear me no here's my body with many members now if my hands start to take the operation of my feet that I'd be walking upside down but my hand is a certain work to do and my feet has got a sir so that the body is in unison operating positionally by the Spirit of God are you there with me hallelujah so you said well somebody said well then I believe that God poor is freed on everybody so everybody can have the same operation no no sir because the Word of God is true from Genesis to Revelation and God cannot say something in Genesis all it as a law and when you come to Revelation he changes mine no sir you see when Paul comes on the scene he said let the women keep silent in all the church for it's not permitted unto them to speak in other words they should not usurp authority over the men it was right there because of Genesis amen no how could the New Testament church be otherwise no because he said if the vibe put votes another branch it must be like the first Amen and if the foot shall say because I'm not the end I am NOT of the body you know I was just him and do you something back home you know sometimes people have respect of persons and in the church you know it's just normal as human being you know somebody's got a favorite person and you've got a favorite family and you know you love this child and him and it's my favorite challenge and that child so you know if you've got something in the church and you know you're gonna give give sir so you give a nice big one to this one and a little bitty one to that one and you know tomorrow Haman is this brother's birthday and you're glorifying you know you do things and then tomorrow there's another one in there or happy birthday and so somebody gets offended because we are human and so there's some things that we are not to do in the church because we've got to be sensitive that we don't come here to offend one another you know human beings will have favorites and you might have liked him for one movie alone oh but listen that's not the place for the church you know you know what it is to a child when you give your giving gifts to children and you give this one and you give this one you didn't give that one again that one you know this car that you put on that one and you'll never realize it but that child will take that for years and years and years and it means a complex and that's all will be deficient in some ways because there's something is car that you're putting that child really the New Testament church must be sensitive and being the Spirit of God that the things that cause offence among people we lay those things aside because when we come to the house of God they said at the foot of the cross everything is liver at the foot of the cross the same blood that you require is the same blood that I require are you there we may a man the same affection that you need is the same that I need you know if when one calls or that I'm sicker you know you go to Mauser when somebody else's sick you've got to go the same two miles are you there with me and brethren are Tewa you know the only way we can be that we've got to come to that place a lord love the body of christ screaming you get what I'm saying it's not my love Lord love them through me that you are not preachers realize that you've got a ministry that you are not following the leaders of the church you've got a ministry and where will that minister fall when you come to the position that your actions edify the body of Christ your actions is pulling down on the body of Christ something's wrong with your experience love one another by this shall all men know that you're my disciples because you have love one for the other hallelujah and in that ministry when the word go forth howl if something must happen you know I remember we had a visiting minister Annie preacher real powerful message that just energizes the church and at the end of his preaching you know the people got so anointed on the Spirit of God and a brother got so anointed he began to speak in tongues right there in the congregation and the brother dropped the mic and walk away from the pulpit and I know he was upset because you know they said if there's gifted one among you that was we let him take a room somewhere brethren I tell you this is the oath of God and the Spirit of God can't have Liberty in this house where will the Spirit of God of Liberty the wind blow where it lists and no man know when it comes or when it goes sometimes you feel real anointed sometimes you feel an inspiration and what are you supposed to do brother tell me wench that's freed of God and who'll yourself know the house of God must have Liberty in the Spirit of God and so the brother Carboni wants to come back I won't have him to come back no I won't I won't man you had one chance in you blow it because that's just the truth because brothers let me tell you if there's anything that must break the order of what you think is the Church of God let it be the power of Almighty God right in that presence we people are being healed people are being delivered you said I can't exercise myself then if I can't exercise myself in the period of God in church where should I do it it's not that we've got legalistic we just got so starchy hello hello and I'll so much form of godliness but we deny the power of Almighty God amen you know it is that people don't come out and they don't lay out and / no more because they don't see no need for it but you know what I believe brethren you know when there's sickness and the else of God we've got a responsibility because we can drive those demon back to the pit of hell I don't care what the doctor says and I love my doctor but he's not my healer amen I believe we need to get real serious about God and the things of God hello because brother Branham said when the word is restored the power is also restored to the church if I can tell you hallelujah the Revelation 10:1 his revelation 8:1 the mighty angel come down that's Christ coming down there was silence in heaven for the space in half an hour because he was very stepped down and hurt because the word has been flashing you if I can tell you that revelation 10 7 is revelation 3:14 the angel to the church of little seer if I can tell you revelation 8 will tell ugliest 10 hate to 11 that's a bride in action feeding on the Word of God then where is the power of God in homage hello brethren we've got to become God's Word and that was what happen in the book of Acts when Peter and them were going to hallelujah to the temple of the home of pearl and the man beg for harm Peter said look at us and he looked as though he's going to receive something Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have I give it unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk that was their contention in Acts chapter 3 by what name or by what power Peter was and acts 4 I think that says whether it's right or wrong for there's no other name given am a man on the heaven whereby men must be saved but by the name of Jesus hallelujah and I still believe this powering that name today this boy in the name of Jesus to heal sickness this Paul in the name of Jesus to put marriages this power in the name of Jesus to heal sickness hello this power in the name of Jesus for salvation still to save the vilest of sinner do you believe believe us now this that is a New Testament church in action again hallelujah when salvation is no longer preached as though nobody can get safe when salvation is do you believe brother Branham is our prophet then you've got the Holy Ghost I don't believe that I really don't believe that I believe in an experience with God and in the book of Acts they had an experience with God amen and you wonder why your children are not interested you need to first get an experience with God and then let them get that experience that you've got with God because you can't tell them about an experience that you've never had sometimes we're just reformers you know we come up in the message we believe the message we walk with the message we believe brother Branham is a prophet we believe all the courts we study them we can put quotes the courts the courts and it sounds just right in the circle of message people but concern the power of God that was back then yesterday there's no more power today you know I remember some weeks ago we had a sister that came to church and you know when when she came the first time she was there and she was rejoicing and you know I didn't know who she was my sister telling me she said I know that woman she's a Jehovah's Witness I said certainly she's not anymore because the way she rejoice at the world and you know there might be another week or so she asks for a baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus and then I realized she had she was Jehovah's Witness she went to a trinitarian and somebody she met a backslider on the road he was driving a taxi a backslider from her church and she brought up religion and he set her straight and tell her where she ought to go for the true experience with God and so she left her church and she come to church and man she had an experience with God we baptize her in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so you know I went away and I came back and I didn't see her and I asked the brother said oh she hasn't been in church for two weeks I got a number I call her she said oh sigh I have two boys and they're artistic and you know I can't manage them I said sister manatee that's what God wants bring them to church bring them to church I'll tell you the first time she came to church and she was paddling with these two little boys you know there's a hyperactive going everywhere and you know the sisters come it's good to have met your people in church one take this one that way one take the other one let her rejoice and Alleluia we will take the trouble while you hear the word of God and you know that service amen they brought them to the altar and my heart a little boys the brothers woman and they were just fighting to get away but we prayed over them the end of that week she said man she said they went to school and the first time she came back they came back from school singing the songs that they were teaching them in school she could not believe it blue Erma but we put a challenge we said God going take care of them and so another Sunday she coming I said where the boys she said I'll leave them like I said listen when you come to this house carry them because the Holy Ghost not done with them yet it's not right that's the challenge that we take has the body of Jesus Christ and watch God do it people said well what if you say all these things and God don't a challenger a challenger the God who I serve it keep his word and you know what God want he wants somebody that's stupid in us to take him at his word I would have been fooling I want to be childlike enough to take God at His Word he said it and that says brother branham's that God becomes guilty of his word until he brings it to pass and we're watching those boys coming to church and they're a little bit calmer and a little bit calm I said thank you lord thank you lord he's still working do you believe that this morning the New Testament church must be another book of Acts and so read the book of Acts and see where they were and look where you are and see if you've got the feet that they've got in the book of Acts because brethren the word is taking us back to the same place not in words only no but in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost when the sick come to the outer to be prayed for then the elders come also that's what the Bible says when the sick comes to the altar to be prayed for the elders must come also the elders must anoint them with oil and pray for them because the Bible said is there any sick among you let them call for the elders of the Church let them anoint them with oil and the prayer of faith shall save the sick do you believe that that's what the Bible says God bless you this morning the musicians would come I'd love to sing but if I sing you wouldn't like it so somebody need to come and sing with me is there any sick among you this morning is there any troubled lives among you this morning God is still here amen he's got the power that he had 2,000 years ago where he was in 1947 in 1958 in 1965 God still got the power today and we thank God that we've had a prophet that turn us back to the Word of God not to theology therefore we don't have to understand it all we've got to do is to believe God's Word and if we believe God's Word then whatsoever we ask for believing God will grant it to us as we pray this morning hallelujah and it would like to be remembered you can lift your hand right where you are God knows your heart this morning Lord Jesus we thank your God for the salvation of our soul we thank you Lord God because you are still a healer you're still a problem-solver burden Bera Lord God we thank you God because Lord you still deliver Lord we thank you God because the book of Acts is still in action the Lord God we are the manifestation of the power of Almighty God the Lord God the word made flesh in this day the
