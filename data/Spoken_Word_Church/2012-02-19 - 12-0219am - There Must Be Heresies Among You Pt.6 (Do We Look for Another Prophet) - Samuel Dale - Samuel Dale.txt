========================================

foreign like this song I sing out a song with the service it's in the black notebooks we don't know it uh Open the Eyes oh I am with me holy holy field right into the word that's right amen and you'll find it good to see everybody in the house forward you like to turn where we've been reading in First Corinthians 11 and first Peter 3. get right into the services remember the Lord willing this next Sunday for a couple of Sundays at least maybe more but for that weight we'll be speaking on the Family you know and and bringing forth the things he done a good job last night I really enjoyed it and it really you know we had a good time last night at the uh the banquet and we just pray that the Lord would bless each and every one for being a little late because we was last night we stayed there until 10 30 or better but you know it turned out real good yeah it's a good time we had a good time in in the Lord and appreciate everybody that worked and the things that you've done to provide it for us and the cleaning up the doings and the schedule and that's right I think my wife there especially for getting it all together in the basis of of having everything ready for us and everything so we appreciate that you know so just remember that but remember now the Lord willingness come in Sunday wait will be speaking on the family and come and be with us and I just wrote my own self a note like this let's see how many of Miss Easter services about your life they started out on it last night so let's just see how many it's going to lay out during this time and plan your vacation or something you know to do whatever all right remember that okay we have another special event today or not just today uh this past Friday brother Anderson became a an American citizenship to view all of that so we we appreciate it I think it was on Friday amen we appreciate that remember too then brother Claude by singer will be here with us on the Lord within on the 29th that's the Wednesday the the last day of this month so he'll be speaking for us all right I guess that's all but the amen so remember that okay yeah fellowship meeting will be here on the third Saturday in March this the minister to be announced later amen okay let's just pray and then we'll read our scripture the heavenly father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for the day and the hour that we have thank you for you and we pray now today that you would just come on the scene in our hearts and our lives and be Lord not just an onlooker but to be a preeminent one in each one of us to reveal yourself unto us because that's what we need more than anything you revelation of your word we love you and we thank you and you promised it that's not hard to pray when we can read so much in the word about how you promised in the end time what you would do so it's not hard to be able to do that yet you did say pray that the Lord would send laborers into the Harvest in Lord we just pray that you'd bless down God as we read your words you come and speak to each and every one of us and forgive our sins lead us in thine understanding in Jesus name amen First Corinthians 11 and first Peter that have a brother and sister in there with us they've been here before so they're just getting welcome this man down with us because they're part of us amen right so let's think on these things first Corinthians 11. we've read this a lot because that's what we've been doing it's just uh you know taking these things that we see in the message some of the doctrines and things that we do not agree with and you know I might get around to find something matter why we do agree with it but not a whole lot of don't agree to get them out of the way okay but let's read our scripture First Corinthians 11. 17 well 18-4 first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there be divisions among you and I partly believe it for there must be also herishes among you why why is God going to let heresies right you know divisions splits problems right come that day which are approved may be made manifest among you in other words we're going to see it's going to stay with the truth right all right first Peter 3 15. but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason and a hope that is in you with meekness and fear and you maybe see that the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now don't let me get everybody remembers twin brother uh Solomon Jacob the brother there was the Israeli citizen you know you know I think he was from Egypt or somewhere over with Iran or something anyhow he was and then he but he was a Jewish right you know his daddy was like a Jew his mother was a one way or the other you know and so he had enough to be able to be a Jewish Citizen and you remember he was going back there when he left from here and he sends us a little note of thank you for all of our prayers and our support to him and all brother Solomon Jacob and there is some pictures if you want to look at them brother Joe has some downstairs and and all and he's thanking each and every one of us for the time because they do at this time have a message Church there in Israel you know I know that maybe some of the others said well we've been there first but I don't have no argument about that I'm just telling you there is a message Church started an official recognized and where they could rent a building and be able to you know to take care of things so you know we appreciate that and just pray for him that was their main point we have to pray for him okay now we've been covering some doctrines I said we would try to to cover a few things that I know the doctrines among the people of the message that that we don't agree with and and then tell you why we don't agree with it because it's not to just say well name a Doctrine I don't agree with that name a drunk I don't agree with that you know that doesn't answer any questions or any thoughts so forgive me for being maybe sometimes even taken to one whole service on a Doctrine to be able to express to you why I don't believe it like that and maybe you may have heard of these doctrines and I always put this on there that number one is that this is the best that I know of of what I have heard myself and things I don't try to take too much secondary information I try to find out myself what somebody's talking about is when I'm listening to somebody and I have listened to some women as many as 10 or 11 messages to myself to be able to understand it and I don't listen to try to find their error I listen for their thought and intent and naturally the error will show up right if you have the Holy Spirit right all right and number two I I know that once we would say name something that there's so many different groups that are divided off about those thoughts and everybody would not agree with all of the thoughts that maybe a certain brother brought of a certain message and I'm staying away from naming the names but like I said if you contact me later about it I will personally tell you who follows this this this this as much as I know all right not to be derogatory or hateful or arrogant or whatever and we covered uh starting out with the two Souls the doctrine that started many years ago and then we went into the two Lords and then we went into the one that's coming or come out later about the people that believe Jesus wasn't God until the River Jordan you know and the things of that order and showing you why I don't agree with those things amen then we went through the one called the seventh under virtues and covering that that we don't agree with on that point or what they're trying to make and then we went through the one that was called the no Holy Ghost Doctrine in other words you don't have the Holy Ghost today like they did on the day of Pentecost and we went through that trying to express it now this past Wednesday we covered of a doctrine that is prevalent among the people of the message the ministers that brother Branham was the one that came to John on Atmos to deliver to John the message and I showed you why did I didn't believe that because first off surely no one would believe that that was the literal body of brother Brown that would come to John on Patmos because that would be total pre-existing right and that wouldn't work out at all but I'm sure there are some people that believe that no all right but then they some believe it was this way and some believe it was that away and I just showed you what I believe because even if you believed that brother random did come to John on Patmos to deliver you got to remember that that is the writing of the word that was the emphasis I tried to make Wednesday that is the writing of the word right because it was coming to John to rock John was described someone claimed to John and John wrote that's the writing of the word right I'm not as concerned about who's writing the word right it doesn't matter to me what it would be Matthew Martin Luther John or Paul or Peter or whatever that would write it or John you know it the my my main point is I want to know what God Said Amen I want to know what the spirit has to say because that's my my way of doing it and that's why I put it that way that the writing of the word was what would be dealing with in the Bible but we want to know who come to run around right to bring us the Revelation amen off the message of an hour and then we're going to try to tie this message today kind of in with it to to show you a little more you know about what we're talking about all right and uh you know if you differ that's fine that's what you believe I just plainly tell you what I believe you can't get most of the ministers to tell you what they believe they want to kind of play around a little to where that you know they can flow with you or whatever and they need to be in this group and right you know maybe in this group and you know they can kind of I just can't do that that's why I couldn't never be an evangelist right you know because eventually I yeah I mean it's like I've always said how can I go appreciate anything all right if I preach on one God it's contrary to a lot of the people in this message I preach on serpent seat it's contrary to a lot of the people of the message on the marriage and divorce it really would be contrary what a lot of people would think but you know but I just still try to do the best I can and you forgive me you know and pray for me because that's what I want to do because I'm not pastoring the world unless people may be listening today and we will listen to this on the internet sometimes you know but I'm not your pastor you must have a pastor to pay your tithes to because that's where the Prophet says you pay your tithe where you get fed right and you know we do have one that sends in kind that does listen you know but outside of that that's the only one that sends in their tithes uh monthly and I don't ask for no money from anybody period about anything whether they're tapes or whatever they are they're sent out free of charge about 180 or something the other day mailing out to some overseas people you know because we want to do that and let them hear what they if they want to hear it's out there you know it's out there if you want to hear it don't forget it right turn me off that's no problem but pray for me amen that's the main thing pray for me you know and that's my point all right now let's tie this in kind of with the point because of what I said about that you know I do not believe that brother Brown came to John on Patmos because you would be getting too close into another doctrine that followers right after that is that there's a lot of people in the message believe that brother random was God now there's many forms of that right some would say deity yeah some would say Christ some would say this away or that way so you understand what I'm saying you know I'm trying to cover my point but yet also out there say well okay uh my brother my pastor doesn't believe he's God he believes he's Jesus well that's yeah that's gone amen and uh you know I gave one they can go ahead and put it up on the 1am on doing but I don't know who we got on the board back there today I don't know who's missing because we got someone swapping about I'm glad of that that they are swapping out into so it must be Richard and and Bob backyard today because that's the two heads I see missing Tom Richards in the corner so Bob may be back there by himself I don't know but anyhow here's a quote that we we say look someone say brother random is the son of man I thought the color fire was the son of man am I mistaken this is questions and answers 1964 823 that number two if you're looking in your books well that's a good question very good but I am not the son of man but a son of man there's quite a bit of difference Jesus Christ was the son of man the Son of God the son of man the son of David all right he was not wrote around him is not the son of man amen we do not believe that we do not believe that he was uh God right now you say well now we take this we'll pull it around into the right place and get it to the right order Moses sure was God to the people but when he stepped back he was Moses that's right right am I quoting brother Brown he was God as long as he was speaking but when he said back he was Moses all right let's get it in the right order and then we'll we'll believe it in the correct way look at the next one and let's see what brother Randall had to say what this is questions and answers book 3 1964 8 30 in the morning service paragraph 88 now run around could Jesus look like you are you be Jesus or something like that one steps of the word that's exactly the truth amen amen another sense of the word it's an antichrist amen that's right now that's the difference between right and wrong that's right okay and look how close it is to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist see for that person of the Lord Jesus Christ is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high and will come again in great power and Glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him right it's exactly the truth amen and you become Christ amen remember my message on Messiah yes you see you are the word Messiah means the anointed one now you are if you have the Holy Spirit you become the anointed one so you've embarrassed all kinds of anointed ones all right now you become the anointed one I was up in Jeffersonville Indiana and a man was talking one day I told you this and he was talking about brother random being deity and I said well my brother I said I'll tell you what that's it uh I believe in deity right I should not believe anything all right but I said the way I believe it is and I pointed over this other brother and I said now I believe that brother right there with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right yes the prophet of God would say it's the same as deity speaking and I believe that's deity right and I said now laying all things aside uh brother Brown's Ministry and the anointings that brought it you know that he brought I said putting that aside to the point that I believe then brother Branham was deity if we believe that he was a born-again Believer right amen because they were born again Believers amen I believe it that way every born-again Believers the Christ that's right all right but to make him he said the Lord Jesus Christ you see that brother naturally he looked at me and he said no I don't agree with you okay okay no problem you know because see he believed he was the Lord Jesus Christ right you know what's that people oh no no I don't believe he's the Lord Jesus Christ he's just God and I don't believe he's God I believe he's the Lord well I don't believe he's the Lord I believe he's a Christ yeah yeah but he's a greater Christ than we are Christ said outside of the ministry the the gifts and the callings that was in his life he was a born-again believer in the body of Christ right you agree amen if you wasn't then you're in bad shape right you know I mean you you know you have to believe that he was a member of the body of Jesus Christ amen that's why it made him as the the message goes on to show about him greater than all the prophets that's right amen now you realize we're going to get to that in a minute because the the second part of this see this part is do you believe that right around him with God or whatever you know and the second part we would be dealing with uh whether or not you believe another Prophet is to come all right see then do you realize that brother random now this is what I'm saying brother random we know would be number four of Elijah right Elijah Elisha John the Baptist brother Branham the two witnesses to Israel right one of them will be Elijah right so you agree with that yes now let's see if you agree with this brother Brown is the only one out of those five times that is in the body of Christ right right that's right that's right come on Elijah went in the body of Christ it wasn't there right Elijah wouldn't end the body of Christ all right John the Baptist was the introducer but he was not born again let me quote scripture the least in the kingdom is greater than John that's right right all right amen so then we know for a certainty that brother random was greater than all the prophets why even though Paul was a born-again believer and a prophet for his day right right you agree with that that's right that he was a prophet for his time all right but brother random was greater than all the prophets because he was a born-again believer in the body of Christ putting him into a great position that you'll find all of those quotes you know of saying with you know the greatest of all the prophets all right could I believe that amen but I don't believe he was the Lord Jesus Christ that's right you can call him to cry you can call it those things like that and that's fine as long as you keep it in the correct order yeah we do not worship brother brown right right but you know the Christ that is in you is the gods you worship right amen that's why he's your personal savior right amen I don't worship the god in in dick Anderson right right now that's our strong name wait a minute now we bring one God no get the point get the point worshiped that God right I worship the Lord Jesus Christ that way I don't worship brother random amen I thank God for him coming and bringing us a word and where would we be without you a bunch of garbage cans bad enough like it is right amen but where would we be but I do not believe brother random was gone no right Amen to the people right well we got quotes we'll bring all you quotes but just remember you got to come all together and he said if you make me the Lord Jesus Christ you've made me the Antichrist amen he said I am not the son of man I am a son of man right right all right amen amen now then in being that she did we put it in the correct order amen all right we put it to be now that he would be the greatest of all the prophets that's right because of him being a born-again believer in the body now listen not only a born-again believer in the body he came to the adoption right that's right you agree amen yes sir all right and then he went on to The Headstone right of adoption because that's what I believe adoption is right she didn't hauling them never reached that position of the headstone right nope okay right now you're short they never reached that position of the headstone but the prophet said that the stone hadn't come yet but in his ministry there's where he came right and I believe those seals and brother rand's message after the seals broke no there was a restoration all right now after The Shield's broke the prophet brought his message to the bride amen that is The Headstone to the bride right amen right so look at the positions you put him in right and how close is he said there while ago that you know that looks good and in a way that's right yep but if you want it the wrong way look what you're making amen an antichrist amen but in the correct order he's not the Lord Jesus Christ right he's not not the object to worship though amen even as we covered about Jesus in the Life part of the the message there was times even Jesus when he was here on Earth would not accept worship right right sure but there's times he would because he knew what they were thinking right right he knew what they were worshiping right he said worship God right well when they seen that was God he'd accept it right but when they looked at him he said don't worship me because that was not to the right order all right does anybody understand that's the way songs that's the way I believe I don't believe what a random was I no more deity than the least member of the body of Jesus Christ as far as the new birth right right amen now the the Gibson callings the position he was in the elevation that God brought him to the understanding of the word the the adoptions and the things like that sure put it into a higher order right amen and he's the one going to introduce us to all right wonderful thing to think about him being that but yet he's not let me state it again then I believe ever born again believer by the new birth is deity inside of you amen you're an anointed one you're a Christ right right you're a messiah but we're not the Messiah right right we don't worship the god in each and every other one of us because your God is personal to you right right man all right that way we keep it in the correct order amen all right so everybody understand what I'm getting at me maybe let's go on to the next part then to where that we can talk about it of we'll give a quote in a submit it but we'll just leave that note there we'll use it just a second do we look for another Prophet to come or do we look for another person you know human form being mortal no you you following me now human form being moral right and we look for another person to come is there scripture or quote from the prophet that there is another to come after him to the Gentiles right that's it now to the Jews there will be two witnesses right amen right and one of them will be of the spirit and prayer of Elijah all right but we're not promised to another messenger no amen your only promised the house seven Church ages right and you've got seven church-aged Messengers now we've been through that if you want tapes on it and things like that you still got to bring bread around them and as the one to introduce the Messiah right amen amen we agree with that wholeheartedly that's right but do we look for another prophet because there's a Doctrine among the people of the message when we went to Jeffersonville Indiana in 1968 I guess for the first time they were discussing Dorothy and who is to lead us who is to take over since brother Brown was gone right and you know that back falling back on a doctrine of what we were talking about the seven Thunders and running around saying the thunder was the voice of God when the seal broke it's not just Thunders that are thundering out to our lives right that can take place right but it is the voice of God I believe there's only one voice of God for this age amen right that's right all right one messenger that's what Brethren said they don't believe in the one-man message all right now we're going down here in a minute and see if you agree with the rest of it but you can say well I agree to that point yeah that brother random was the last one promised right according to Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 etc etc then we know what he was to do all right but he was to bring us the message and there's not another messenger to come now I wrote this and if you don't agree with it anybody out there fine see these other doctrines that we have covered they were men that started those doctrines and those brethrens ever one of them about six times let's see one two three four five six or seven this is number seven where the number seven would have been uh the thought of believing that brother Brown was God you know that all of them say if you don't follow us you're out right right right right right now come on if you're not in their little click right you know they're little Doctrine then you're unwelcome correct right all right and see then wouldn't it be that they would believe that they were the messenger to come sure even to people straightening run around them out and saying run around was wrong and some dumb enough to even say that Jesus was wrong that's right and I'm not joking that's the doctrine of the people that believe that that Jesus wouldn't go out to a river Jordan now if you want to know later who's preaching they come to me and ask and I'll tell you right you might find out if somebody you'll honor yourself and thank their fine father it's nobody to get sellers hey man but I I'm telling somebody the other day I think it was Brother Gary I showed it to somebody the other day and it got funny to me and I'm sorry I'll just put this in oh I'm gonna say in Brazil I come to find out that they had had a big split over there and some groups that pulled apart they had a lot of people there was thousands of them and there's hundreds of ministers that were gathered together in trying to follow the message all right now and they had a big split well this group pulled apart and you know what brother Brown said he said I'm not against people but what they say he was against the system right right he said he went against people said he was against the system right well that brother when he told me that I started laughing because you know what happened I mean I was talking to the one side of the group I'm sure and you know but the other side that they pulled away which was hundreds of ministers and thousands of people following it they call themselves The System okay I put life in Portuguese so I done it in English I didn't want a lambaste anybody but I was giggling because brother Brown said he was against the system and they said they pulled away they was the system and so okay see sometimes you don't think about what you say and people were doctrines you know and the things they don't think about what's going on and somebody's thinking about listening to the system okay but but continue on now I believe that there was never to be but one send out Prophet to this stage amen that's right all right now in doing that I believe brother Brandon was the man to bring that message you and I amen and our total dependence is upon him to be who he declares himself to be so look at the number one that we got on the Note now this is not the the other arms get that out of the way all right so look what he says we've read this over and over and over Place 327 Church age book this message your Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecost pathology exactly so all right now even some of them in their doctrines that you know they will agree to certain things they would agree to Malachi 4 to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and and uh and they will even agree that that God used bread around them to bring the the seals to us but see then they go on beyond that and they have their own doctrines and by having their own doctrines it automatically puts them as to be the leader it's like I told a man one day I said if you can straighten brother Branham out because that's what a lot of people Ministry believe I said put your big toe up here I said I want to kiss it you say well that's Catholic no no no no no no that wasn't what I was talking about I was talking about it anybody straight and run around them I would have to be almighty God if you straight him out not think you found the quote that was wrong where he said 700 instead of 7 000. and brother so and so corrected him on that one time and I heard him and said bill and I were talking about what the evidence of the Holy Ghost was I thought man you're mine yes smart but your brain is stupid that you could talk to a prophet about what an Evidence is that would be like me trying to tell Einstein how to split an atom when I can barely turn on the light or change the light blue right that's not a joke that's right if you can straighten brought around them out then we're supposed to be following you amen you was the one to be sent but I can't find it in the Bible where you used to be seen right man I I can find the word Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 always to be connected to the seventh Church age messenger amen Israel God the prophet of God to our generation I can't find that right all right well I I can't find anything extra amen and this one used to be right down below us he's dead now I'm passing on this with him between him and the Lord but he believed that he was the one that run around come to introduce that he was the Lord they would run over in India way back a long time ago that believed that he was the Lord there's people that have been more closely related with us I say us okay let's believe they were the son of man and their people believe that the brother was the son of man to stand between the six and seventh seal for them so you know where that puts it closer yeah related to people that we know um right but see I can't follow today he brought a random wooden leaks on a man there is nobody else can leave this on a bank right and he said he was Ace on a man we just got through reading right right see you with Ace on a man that needs on a man came to right right sure you gotta house somebody a voice speak yes amen that's where we're going to and so watch what he goes on to say now in the next one look number two this is the 1963-11-16 the evening matching trip bring back the church to the word now what is this messenger of Malachi 4 to do restore back the original faith the resurrection faith that they've seen Jesus after he had raised the dead seen him walking or working among them now I'm looking for the resurrection right amen I'm wanting Resurrection Faith right this message would have to have the resurrection and message to raise you and I right because then brought around could stand there and say I am not the son of man I am a son of man but let these son of man come now and show you the resurrection because that was the sign that he had right run around had the resurrection sign given by the Lord Jesus he could not perform it himself he said I'm waiting on him man right but that was the resurrection sign now I don't know of any other sign after then right I've studied this message for 40 something years now and studied my Bible for over 60 years no and in doing that I can't find these things all right that people speak of you know somebody else to come all right see because I'm not looking for another person our Prophet I use the word person right if some people would come along oh I don't claim to be a prophet brother they'll say prophets I don't my pastor don't claim to be a prophet he just claims to be the one to take over what should I use Percy or profit right now our thing amen okay okay so that gets in the nouns and pronouns you know person place or things all right all right now so we're not looking for another person a prophet or somebody lead us now you say no this is what I remember Jeffersonville you say but brother Dale Moses only led the people up to the land but Joshua had to come and take over right oh yeah and take them through and I agree with you that's exactly right all right but now who is the Joshua of this day right man all right all right so let's pull that up and just see who is the Joshua of this day so we'll just cover a few things and then we'll see what it's talking about this is the message adopted in 1965-18 adoption which would be part two if you're using your books for the new new computer system did you notice Moe's just that great miracle performer that brought down Israel down through the land and brought them up to the promised land but did not Place their inheritance to them right he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but Joshua divided the land to the people is that right and Christ brought the church up to the place to where their possession was made to them was given to them just a Jordan to cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in order right the Joshua of the day puts the church in its order all right right now who is the Joshua this day the Holy Spirit right now the Holy Spirit had to have somebody to work through so brother brown right he brought the word that's what I was talking about of the the point of talking about that John and the brother around supposed to become the general patents that was only to bring the word to write it yeah right around him could only bring the word that God gave to him right right but he could not reveal the word oh the prophet revealed these things now you don't go too far there you're making him dead then don't realize what you're saying right yeah he could only speak the word amen God has to reveal it to you and I right amen the Holy Spirit then is through Joshua and sure Joshua placed him in the land that's right sure he did all right but now if Joshua is a is the Holy Spirit he said yeah let's run around could do something the other well I stopped deliberately how many he kept reading didn't wear a stop but the holy spirit is the one who says the church in order because Joshua today puts the church in his order giving to each one gifts places position and I worked right around and give us gifts nope come on read your profit he couldn't give us skills he couldn't Place us positionally God has to do that all right should we let around me then right and he is the voice of God speaking to the inner man that Christ had saved the Holy Spirit now Joshua placed them in the natural land now the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the land that they're in the position that they belong in their inheritance right around cannot give us gifts no he cannot bless us in the body of Christ right all right look at the next one as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee in 1969-11 paragraph 228 looking down into the bottom you just read all before and see if it's right we're looking for the Joshua of this day which is the Holy Spirit to lead us to the land he has to speak through somebody come on Amen now all right he has to speak through somebody because he's a spirit right okay I've told you what he stole me now you believe and be healed come on yeah Joshua could speak through brother Branham right right but that didn't make him Joshua oh come on I I give you know things and I know that I shouldn't be that way but makes it man in this message that they believe he was Aaron to take over after Moses left now if you want to know who that is meet me later but yours too because you've heard of it he's supposed to be Aaron I said don't type me like that right because Aaron never made the promise I see you Mr Thompson right oh you want to yeah but just don't get me involved amen because I certainly don't want to be Aaron because he never made it to the promised land that's right that's right he didn't even get there later according to the profit I don't know maybe he did I don't know if it ain't sure that wouldn't like Moses and it was right all right but now listen so then who are we looking for who are you looking for or what is it to be thank you clean off my nose look at just letting off the pressure 1962 518 paragraph or E55 and one day he went down to the Jordan of deaths crossed over the Jordan come back on the third day now who's that amen that's the Lord Jesus Christ right right okay bringing the evidence that there is a resurrection to the dead Hallelujah he stood in a fish he was with them for 40 days showing himself alive said handle me I'm not a spirit I'm a man flesh the moment what was he the Joshua of our time that's crossed the river of death and return back with the evidence not only that but he said whosoever believeth in me she'll never die and they were commissioned to go up in way and he was going to send them the earnest of their salvation eight minutes so then Joshua would not be brother Branham all right but God would use brother Branham as a symbol of Moses to bring the word right right and as with Joshua to speak and to Proclaim that word yeah right but he couldn't Cross Jordan for none of us right right so that's taking out two things at one time about the deities and the things and believing he's God putting it all together I don't set up with Brother John we were going another way that I'll bring this afternoon and I said uh we're gonna have to do a switching route here you know so we'll bring this message this morning and then we'll switch over this evening to the other one so we can all time together all right now now think about it could run around give us gifts any places could he Cross Jordan for any of us well could he raise for any of us right no all right Jesus was the only one and that's why I loved it because I used to have them Yep they're in my own understanding about years ago and I told you about it once it was brought forward and the Lord revealed it because you see the Lord Jesus went through everything for you and I right even to death to those who pass on go on and pass away Resurrection to bring them up yes and then a change in a moment the twinkling of an eye right yes that's right do us that are living right see that ain't what he covered it all right amen so we don't need anybody else to help us or whatever that way but we need somebody to express it to us until where we can receive it right now there's where the prophet of God came in and he brought the message he brought the message of eternal life check on the seals and and go after the seals and even read the titles of the sermon Christ the mystery God revealed who is this melted things that are to be future home all of them will cover eternity yes right that's right because he was the one to do as uh um who is it let's see uh Leviticus 25 8 right the day would be 7 7 49 but then in the 49th there would be a messing sound for a jubilee to come in the 50th and that's what exactly brought around and brought amen showing us all the way through the scriptures and he brought the message he got eternal life right amen right but he could not reveal it unto us I know that's contrary to a lot of people's thinking because they said he'd revealed to me now he the holy spirit is the only we gave it the other day Christ The Mystery of God's revealed look around and said the Holy Ghost is the holy spirit is the only revealer of the word Jesus said even my own life paraphrasing it from the future home that were brought around my Blues right where he was bringing it said even my own life didn't reveal that unto thee amen we're talking about Peter you know it's a daughter to Christ the son of the Living God Jesus said my own life didn't reveal that right the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word all right the father and the Holy Ghost have to be the self-stain one all right now but you say what brother Dale the prophet of God is now off the scene and we have his message all right and I stated over and over and over so I'm one more time with her I'm not looking for another Prophet I can't find it in the Bible right right amen right right but I can find a faithful Ministry amen amen in the Bible their position right and I don't read these things and do this to just cause of myself you know I didn't write the book right amen all right do you understand what I mean right I didn't write the book that talks about a fightful Ministry I I wasn't a prophet that spoke of a faithful ministry right man I just happened to be one that God can use and whether I'm a five-fold or a tenfold or what fold I am or no fold at all don't worry about it the dumb donkey told the truth right because this dumb donkey can tell the truth to you then glory in the truth amen is this y'all have a good time let those donkey go into hell amen that's why I'm playing I don't worry about it at least you don't have to sleep what's he talking about I'm talking about the truth I believe the five-fold ministry is here right to do is the prophet of God say it right amen right whether or not I'm a part of it is none of your business or my business the truth is what it is amen man it will not put you in a Rapture to know I'm part of the thoughtful Ministry it will not put you in a Rapture to know brother random what's wrong it won't put you in a Rapture to know that Jesus Christ lived come on but if you have a personal experience with Jesus Christ in your life that's it to bring you the new birth then you got something connected all right being you connected to the prophet of God Amen to be the only messenger of this age right bring the message to you and I yeah all right right but now you got to tie it right back down to the powerful Ministry amen right because if you don't talk to that where are you going to leave it right you're going to say what the man said years ago all God was he poured into Christ all Christ was he poured into brother round he died and took it with him we don't have nothing left you want me to quote that again where you make sure to understand it because I heard a man say he said all God was he poured into Christ all Christ he poured into brother Brown brother Brown died and took it with him we don't have nothing we're just waiting on the bus to pull up yeah well remember the bus in Gainesville doesn't pull up to where it used to pull up to so you better know where it pulls up because brother prakash straight me out on and he told me one time he said there's a bus depot in gangle I said there's no such thing I said I know when the bus was down bus depot was down into at the train station that's where it used to be you went to the train station down here on Railroad Avenue and you got your your tickets your bus go right there you should know oh brother Dale there's a bus station in Gainesville I said no that's not brother because I've been around here all the life I know when they closed it he said would you mind call this number he said you got to be one I got the number it's a game for Georgia I dialed it in I said where y'all at they said you know where the tractor place is up here in the middle answer the highway yep he said that's where we're at so my point is what go to the depot and wait down at the train station you're not gonna get anywhere you find out we're the best way and then you better sit down and wait on the bus because you might be like a brother was that we was hunting one night when he told me he was a kid's son he told me where he was at he said where's the bathroom man Danny wrote All Over The Core because we knew that was his last stop we went everywhere and we're running up down the road and I was asking these people you know where is the bus depot well did they come through here today before his I said well what's this about the petrol because see that's that's Fjord of them overseas you know natural you know except oh oh he said you're talking about the diesel station that are you talking about that great big place down on the petrol that's where they you know all the trucks stopped right we got to standing at the Retro telling me I'm hunting in the court all right so we got to get straight okay wake you up should make you a little listen now I wouldn't want to make this next statement so unless that brother around and make the statement number seven oh okay yeah number six this is 1965. 1205 things that are to be paragraph 14. but I'm very thankful for these open doors and I've had to go into and the inspiration is give do young men like your pastor here let's cause them as I'm beginning to get old and know that my days are numbered and know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on in the coming of the Lord if it doesn't come in my generation which I'm hoping to see him I look daily for him and watch keeping myself prepared for that hour now he said these young men would take it on right and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord amen right okay from that must be the thoughtful ministry right right which we've been on to the coming of the Lord all right now in doing that it he said I'm beginning to get old you know in a group the ones that believe that Jesus wouldn't God to the River Jordan as we call it in that group there is a brother that made a statement one time he said brother Branham as he was here now said he'd be an old man but she was born like 1906. 6 1909 1990. all right what would that make him I'd make him a hundred and two or three years old so you wouldn't be an old man and his brother he made a statement he said if brother random was here he'd be an old man she wouldn't be able to preach and he said you know what he'd be doing he said I believe he'd be sitting on the front row listening to my pastor I don't think he'd be on that road not with that doctor sir I'm just honest now but that was what the man said right away with his master okay all right but I just don't believe I'd work out no and sleep right around the dumptation going on right so somebody's got to help us right and who is that in five four minutes right now according to Ephesians yeah according to Ephesians 4 in there somewhere right it says it verse 11-14 if the Firefall Ministry is for the Perfection of the science all right now in that doing the a five-fold Ministry to carry us on right okay now let's see what brought around had to say about this thoughtful Ministry number seven on you know all right which would be sure as we would see Jesus 54 328. but you see paragraph or e35 but you see God has men to build houses he has shown to preach the gospel some to teach God has said God has said in the church first apostles a prophet teacher teacher evangelists and Gifts of healings and working on Miracles right and so forth all for the perfecting of the Saints Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now I ask you to show me I'm just honest now I want you to show me any word the Bible said brother Brown and was for the perfecting of the Saints I want you to show me brother random says that he and his Menace Troopers but yet he said there was a Firefall Ministry to do that take the message and sweep it on okay okay look at the next one Gibbs preached 1956 1207. E28 now we're in the church five officers Apostles are missionaries either one both the same word means one sin an Apostles prophets teachers evangelism pastors God sent them into church but because one would be an apostle the prophet couldn't say you're not in it are the pastor to the advantage of this or so forth but they're all little ones of God that's put into the church for the perfecting of the Saints okay so your Prophet is holding the point and I think of our word that a brother that there was a Doctrine that's related to us that we knew a whole lot about I'll say that so that makes it close to us that he elevated the prophet up and made him that and his people did and uh you know that's where I told him that you'd have to elevate all five of the thoughtful Ministry because I can't Elevate one right right you don't put them right and I said now beside that if you're going to quote let's quote right around correctly in the Bible I said the teacher the president nobody in the file form Ministry could touch the teacher and putting the word together that's right well of course you didn't like that because he thought he was the prophet above the powerful Ministry well I don't believe that I don't believe he's a prophet above the five four Ministry if I got time I'll get on down to a few more little things in here all right all right let's read on look at number nine again this is Macy's 1962 10-14 or more Insurance that's your perfect man remember last night don't try to take the other man in office and some evangelists some pastors or some teacher first perfecting of God does it read like that congregation says no the perfecting of what they honored out Saints who are the Saints the Sanctified one amen one started from down here going to the next one all right this is paragraph 405 and the statue of a perfect man God has set in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it for that Perfection of the coming of the son of God now I didn't make that statement you talk to him amen the powerful Ministries to do what to bring all these virtues into the body of Jesus Christ right foreign Ministry and take the prophet's message there's no problem you know there's no problem with the point of our thoughts about what it is if the let's see how does Paul say it um how can I hear without a preacher and how can he preach unless he be sent is that your scripture that's right see if he ain't sense you don't have to worry about anyway that's right he just gonna bring half Doctrine High Crews and his own doctrines and ideas but if you've really sin has the Holy Spirit why would he deal with anything other than trying to follow the prophet's name well could he come up with his own idea where could it be right couldn't work out that way right okay now that won't work those are all tied together into other things that I will mention I've got a few minutes and I will mention this one and we put it in here that you know because we're on the powerful Ministry that there's a lot of people believe that Joseph is a prophet okay I believe that too because brother Ryan said now I wouldn't believe it about somebody else maybe or me or something like that my brother didn't say it right I wouldn't believe it about some brother in this message to call his name because I never heard run around say it right right all right but he said Joseph was a prophet yep all right amen I believe it's the prophet he said well all right now what are you going to do is he the one to straighten this out I don't believe if anybody needs to straighten this out right that's right amen amen I believe the message is right it's not for the five-fold ministry straighten out the message it's a message straight out the final four Ministry exactly amen well she didn't I don't believe that Joseph some believe it was God right yeah I don't believe that no no he can be the cross like we covered one ago if he's a born-again Believer that's between him and God but if he's the Cry he's a born-again Believer he's Christ that's fine that's right but he's not the Lord Jesus Christ no sir he wasn't the one that brought around him come to introduce run around him come to introduce Jesus Christ amen see not Joseph so then I don't believe Joseph could be anything other than a faithful Ministry Prophet right right now you have prophets in the bible elevated at that bit above the other but you got to be in a faithful Ministry form right you have an agabus is there petrified in the Bible has to be a prophet yes sir all right but where are you going to put him right angle but still had to answer to Paul right right well Paul was a major guy right right all right so then if Joseph did anything of a prophet it'd be only a powerful Ministry problems right how can you put him a six-fold how can you have him a prophet outside of what the file for Ministry is because there's no promise for it to come right and no problem for another Prophet to come I always used to say Samuel to hell and the other brother but I just put Samuel Dale because Samuel Dale ain't no Prophet to come right I never have said I was a prophet never thought nothing about it so I'm here said one time said you're a prophet it doesn't work come to you I said the word comes in spirit field don't start that business because you're going to drive me onto the field if I'm a prophet you I can't be your pastor that's right that's right I'll go to the field because that's all I can do that's right yeah I can't live the way I live and do the way I do and be that so don't get that in the ideals that's right right the word comes the spirit feeling the word comes to you if you've got the bad deals that is the profit amen all right now but see then I'm not against Joseph all ready for him right in no way I believe he's what brother Brown said he's a prophet yep he said well you don't have no quotes where he's a FireFold Ministry no but you don't have no quotes worry something outside of that yeah oh okay all right come on if you got him bring them to me what brothers I don't give a hoot what brother so and so say it I don't care about your private interview views with brother Branham if they don't match up or watch the books and takes right right I had a discussion the only discussion I ever had with Billy Paul was up on the basis that a brother had said he said something I called him the only time I've ever talked to him personally I've talked to it at meetings shook his hand Etc you know okay but I called him I said they're saying you said it he said I never said it I said well here's the name and the address and the telephone number I'd suggest you call the brother and tell him you didn't say that he did somebody did it all right because it was going into the wrong thing right the and I called another brother because it was about something about killing Too Much Game Etc and I said can you show me red around them ever killed gang for anybody else after the Holy Spirit convicted in mind he said brother there's a tail I said I don't care about your Tails I want to know get right around saying I know the tale they said they went two people went out hunting right around there with the brother and they had a tag it used to be different and they had a tiger each one and the tail was it brought around killed an elk for somebody else there's a whole lot of lost chains and a lot of things and you check into them you find out the one I wanted to check into was in Canada when blood around them told brother bisco brother bisco said the tech moves for Elk or something walked across the road and stood right there you said brother Ryan said he's yours kill him he said I couldn't find a place to shoot him which is close to him stand on the side of the road when I went to Canada that's the first question I asked to God now the dean knows that Wade knows it I said what's your laws you see you shoot right down the middle of the highway he said but you're responsible for what you shoot at right I said you mean you ain't got no rules about you got to get off the road he said no that's what Russell we'd probably killed a deer to a piece that we just sat out there on the side of the concert room back in there but when it's nice about it try not to do that come by that Brother Dean the last day when he went over there by yourself I'll check into things there used to be a lot of different laws there used to be what they call a camp meatball that if you kill something back in the old days you could kind of just count me and it wouldn't count it against your records there used to be laws like that well see I don't care nothing about it that's why I asked the brother I said can you show me brother Brown I'm never saying right I said first off you're arguing with God because he wrote around and said God told him not to kill it right and God said you kept your word that's right it's in the argue with him I'm sorry I'm blunt I know it but that's time to be blunt when you blunt I'm not hateful I'm blunt amen between the two I guess but not much but you understand I don't believe see these things I don't believe that Joseph there's no more than a powerful ministry right right and the body of Christ right amen but I believe he's a prophet right my brother run said he was all right see now I would if he come down here and I'd be glad for him to come but you don't want I'd be listening to what he said going the way his daddy had to say all right all right not according to what he thought all right because his daddy was speaking from this word I'm honest amen yet he was a man that's right yep he was gone those are your signs I believe and don't believe I don't believe there's anybody that comes straight and brought around because that's what one of the doctrines was that the son of man come to straighten out the prophet that that's what happened in the seal to the son of man came well who'd he come through right right come on well brother so-and-so he's different I don't give a dude I'm sorry no offense just playing right amen I believe there's one true in living God and he's the Lord Jesus Christ right amen and I believe brother Branham he said if you call me let's say let me stay he said if you make me the Antichrist he said you're further away than he would if you made him Jesus Christ never spoke to that extent but then the other quote said what if you make him the Lord Jesus Christ you make a man cry how could you separate a man that could stand and talk to you and just tell you everything that was going to happen that's like uh who was it um they could was either one one of those or theirs said you know how can you argue with a man when he can tell you where the fish is at when you're going to catch him yeah somebody told them how many fish did you catch that day you know see people got too close to brother Brown right because it got dependent upon them and that's what a lot of people have done about the ministers in this message yes sir there's people in this message that won't buy a Carly ask your pastor that's right they don't buy a house that's your parents they won't do anything to ask your pastor that's right well don't bother me back come on folks you're gonna ask the car dealer what kind of life there's no one man I'm putting this to the life the faithful Ministry but there's no one man in that powerful Ministry got any more Authority or doings or whatever you want to call him I've been all five of them yeah and that's right that's right that's right those are all five whether or not it's just a simple pasture of a church yep that's right he's still ordained of God he said your pastor ordained to lead you through now listen read the rest of the quote if these ordained people just don't read that my pastor ordained leading me through he's off the word well I think he's off the word but he's already leaving too now that anyone wrote around saying he said if your pastor's off the word get away from your pastor amen find you one that'll stay with the word right that's right no problem right I'm not your God right certainly don't ask me what color clothes to wear or whatever to do come in I am trouble enough like it is my wife lays mine out so if you're going to ask anybody ask her don't ask me what I don't give a Hooters yours will tell you that I don't care whether I got on blue jeans or whatever you know I try to be nice at church or try to be nice around together and I think ought to be right amen I think we're to come to church in our good clothes and things like that but I did say one thing and I'll say this well the brothers is coming I told some of them last night I said if they ever come here to this church and they say we've got a rattlesnake and we want to give it to the pastor I'm going to say now according to the rituals and rash of religious world the pastor is always the best dressed might you laughing he's always the best for my brother-in-law's Baptist preacher not kidding you he wouldn't cut his grace let's have a suit closing I'm working with garbage in the club ain't no joke that's the Customs see you're supposed to be up like that you know you know what I told him if you ever come in and say well where's the pastor I want to say find the best dressed guy in the building he's the pastor give it to him Mercy right give it to you be dresses better than any interesting that's right that's not a joke why because we're trying to serve Jesus Christ amen amen that's right amen it's not whether what suits you got on and everything that's good brother told me one time he said sit with my coat you know he said whoa getting a little better suit there ain't better material I'll tell you what if you'll run off a few more people let him come to my church I'd buy me one of them Johnny Carson soon a jerk I believe we've had a profit we need a five-fold Ministry yes Amen to lead us home okay but you know what I like one thing that brother with me made a statement years ago and it really I liked it he said a little worse woman with the baptism of the Holy Ghost can help you that's right amen she can hit people if you just listen right that's why I love to hear your testimonies and your things about what God is to you because then I can relate to it and do it yeah that's what we got which is 206 inspirable 206 anybody having a daughter's open forgive me for life and or whatever dude there should be what we are foreign foreign foreign foreign here we go oh my God
