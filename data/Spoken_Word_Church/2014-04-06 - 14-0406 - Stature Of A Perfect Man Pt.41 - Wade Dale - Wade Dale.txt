TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're going to read second peter 1. a little patient that's okay if we stay on patients a little bit longer maybe help us have uh come on come on test him one two three four five six seven eight nine hello hello i can get this thing working but i can't okay patience according to his divine power had given unto us all things that pretended unto the life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature so we're talking about the divine nature of something having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this give all diligence and to your faith virtue already been through those to virtue knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patience into patience godliness so the next one we're coming up to is godliness and it's right up there getting up close to the top but we got to get through patience first patience we said was steadfast constancy endurance all right then we read scriptures those who endure to the end and then hebrews or hebrews 6 15 talking about abraham so after he had patiently endured see everybody wants to our problem with patience is is like the old saying is june's um mother-in-law had it over in the kitchen god give me patience but i want it now not my mother mom no well your stepmom there we go but she it was on her it was in her kitchen it says no real it says lord give me patience but i want it now well that's kind of not the way we want to deal with this because let us run with patience the race that is set before us after he had patiently endured so we there's something we got to go through in other words this is the journey that we have to go through and sure we we've got to become a christian first we've got to go through like bro hank you know it wants to be baptized in the different ones you've got to be baptized but the first thing you got to do the bible says repent all right and we have to repent every day because as christians we make mistakes and we do wrong if you don't repent every day then you're just a lot better off than i am because i have to repent every day ain't a day that goes by that i don't repent for something that i do amen man i'm talking about even little things you know we were talking about last night well something was brought up about lying that when you become born again you don't lie well now what's inside of you don't lie but brother branham told a big lie it was a little one but he told a big one didn't he yeah he said he did talk said tell him i'm not here well he went outside when he went to pray for that baby the holy ghost said get your dirty hands a prophet going to pray with a gift with an angel with all these gifts and things you know that we don't have and the holy spirit said don't put your dirty hands on that baby but what happened it was in his conscience it wasn't his soul it was in his conscience and that's when we do all of our all these uh virtues to me it's working on our conscience that the second realm that spirit realm the memory reason conscious and imagination that's where these virtues develop from because they're already in your soul yes you don't receive yes patience when you get born again you got pace that born again person that genesis one person has patience already right it's just inside you waiting on you to get rid of you to get it out that's right because it works from the inside out it doesn't work from the outside in see working from the outside in is like clogging i were talking about last night that's that's reformation that's alcoholics anonymous that's reforming somebody alcoholics anonymous says once an alcoholic you're always an alcoholic no if you'll get born again you might have been one but you'll never be another an alcoholic that's wiped away and done clean because it's devils that we deal with deals with medicine and they deal with psychology and they deal with natural drugs which there's nothing wrong with that all right there's nothing wrong with that okay but we deal as christians we should deal on the spiritual side where god said hey if i took it away from you it's gone it's right it's done and you can't reform yourself you can try to do it like you know smoking and stuff you can try to quit you can suppress that thing you can push it down and you can you can stand on top of it and you should do that but then you've got to do like brother tom von bush said he's he said god take away the need and the desire that's right see that's the right approach take away the need and because your body needs that right sure it doesn't need it but it needs it because when i was dipping that my body needed that nicotine it was a drug right it's like any other drug it's a drop it needed it knows you you ain't a good meal you want a smoke cigarette boy well i want i put a dip in my mouth yes but it's a it's really it's it's it's what's in your body and sure you can run and you can clean it out and you can but still that devil's there but see you get that unclean spirit out right and whenever the unclean spirit went out of me i knew that it was over because i had no more desire i mean that was no more than just picking this up you know same way with hank he it's no it's no problem to just do that because it's what his body is craving number one the need and the desire you got a desire to quit the thing that's right but when brother tom prayed that said god don't just don't just fill me with the holy ghost don't just do take away the need and the desire of that because the body is still going to crave it but when that unclean spirit goes out that's when you know that you won't ever need another one you want you can look i mean there's people uh smoking a room and old smokers you know they usually especially you know somebody just naturally quit smoking they kind of you know they get that little urge but once that thing's gone once that thing left me with with the dipping and all the chewing tobacco and stuff i mean i've got friends that do it all the time and it no more bothers me than than anything else why because that need and the desire is gone but god's drove that unclean spirit out i can't drive it out same way with these virtues i can't give myself patience that's right i can't give myself knowledge i can't but when i bring what i have now here's the key i kind of thought about this other day excuse me when i bring what i have which is the holy ghost when i bring that hole it goes into a place that's right to where he can he he can hear you say here he is god yeah he is god but brother brown said he was in there waiting on you to bring the word because that word is what's going to quicken this whole thing that's right the word's the key that's why the word's so important it's not alcoholics anonymous we're not just trying to live a good life because of uh alcoholics anonymous or what they say the power of positive thinking now that's close that's real close because you got to start thinking positive but you think positive under the auspice of the message of not even the message of the hour the word that's right the bible you look at the bible and you see that there was many things ray have the harlot uh you see the woman at the well you see the the woman that washed jesus his feet he said your sins are forgiving you he said go and sin no more well i don't believe that woman went back to being a prostitute i don't think ray have the harlot she married an israeli general and god brought the seed of david through that well go down to jesus if you want to that's okay but that's in the spiritual part but the natural seed line was king david right i'm talking about from ray hammond solomon to boat to obed to boaz right to david come right through a prostitute that's right so god can clean these things up and and do some i said well i say weird things because it's weird to me in the old testament but when you take the woman at the well and people like that i don't think they it's never recorded but once you meet god on that basis and he says go and sin no more i think it's done that's what you've got to see in your life you got to say that god is going to say to you go and sin no more yeah right just wait how is it that david could come through right half of harlot and you're not supposed to come in ten generations i don't know i don't understand that okay i don't understand that at all clark's gonna touch on a little bit of it today about the 400 generation how could david come through a harlot's womb when they considered that a bastard child but you got to remember one thing when rey have the harlot when they when jericho was destroyed if you have no witnesses she was just rahab it's true that's true it's true she was just rahab she was a harlot she you can't go back and fix all that right but god done something to that woman because she took that atonement the red string she hung it out the window well god just killed all of her accusers that's right what did jesus say to the woman what jesus said to the woman they throw the woman down and said we caught her in the act of adoption what do you say that's right in other words if i would have been there he said i didn't see it and then he starts getting rid of the woman's accusers because he knew if they hung around long enough they would have to stone her brother branham said that because they had been with them why i don't know but they are conscious because jesus would keep saying whoever has the no sin catch the first stone that's right well jesus knew if he could get rid of her accusers he didn't see it happen now if jesus would have seen that one committed adultery he'd had a stoner that's right see that's why jesus don't see our sins he hears our voice through the blood even a sinner's covered by the blood of jesus christ right a sinner's even covered right right now there's a blood covering over the earth that's here for everybody yes because brother brown said if he even saw us one second without the blood he'd have to kill us because these things are against god these are contrary amen okay now the one inside he won't destroy that's right but this right here he'd have to destroy because it was born in sin it was born totally contrary to what god wanted that's right all right but it was allowed then he had that blood covering because he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world all right so let me ask you a question i don't know what about ruth ruth was a mole bite that's right is that right that's right now the bible clearly says and clark's going to read it today if he gets to it in deuteronomy it says the ammites ammonites and the moabites cannot enter into the temple for the 400 for the gen 400 generation 400 years 400 years well 400 years 10 generations that's 400 years right now here's ruth there's the moabite maybe it's talking about the mail though you don't say well it says bastard child it doesn't say bastard ma'am somebody didn't know enter an end no it says a child a bastard child can't name him maybe it's talking about the male scene not being a little bite she was a mobile so anyway she was an old bite she couldn't suppose she wasn't supposed to have nothing to do with boaz that's right well see we as gentiles shouldn't have nothing to do with christ that's setting up the title right he came to get his own people which was the jewish people right israel was here israel was his right but here we are gentiles we were we didn't care if there was a god but he came to get us because he knew once that we would see him what would happen he knew what would go on uh brother jones you have your hand up oh go ahead guess what i thought about a bastard job man somebody didn't believe in the lord no that in that it was a bastard child with a child born out of weight loss okay that's that's a definition between that yeah master child is a child born out of wedlock does not have a marital father but not today not today no not today now that doesn't mean today if you were if you were born out of wedlock today the blood of jesus christ covered you because remember that was under the blood of bulls and goats that's right okay which only would move sin it would push it back it didn't do away with sin and god hated that thing so much so he would not he you know what it is the type of us keeping this congregation clean because we don't allow bastards to come in here now there you go spiritual not to the natural yeah okay because the bastard child remember if you can't take correction the bible says you're a bastard child now whether you were born of godly parents or not if you don't take correction you're a master child so they put that that bastard in there which is a child that's born out of weight loss which means you can't take correction which means in other words you weren't born of him that's right you weren't born of god you weren't born of jesus christ you wasn't part of that genesis 1 26 man which is the children of god there's a place in the bible where it talks about mercy being extended for more generations navigations so that covers it absolutely sure because remember even though that law says that for 400 years a bastard child can't enter in his lineage after 400 years could go back in so it wasn't forever in eternity that's right there was grace there but god was going to keep that thing out until it weeded itself out but even after 400 years they were allowed back in they kept records hey they kept records and they knew what went on and they knew what was going on and they kept records and after 400 years that bloodline could go back into the temple if there was nothing happen between in that 400 years and that was a lot of people that's a lot of people between when it happened and 400 years later right the united states is only a couple hundred years old so man it's you know you're looking at 400 years but now i've come to that accountability if you would bastard or whatever you want and you're you get saved or born again that cuts all that off yeah when jesus died at calvary and and gave his life for us then we have the perpetuation now that he can do away with that situation because remember you didn't have nothing to do with it okay you're having to do with it so god will god will not a bastard child is one that won't take correction now that's what the new testament comes up now and says all right i don't care how holy you were born if you if you go against the word of god or you don't take correction then you're just like that bastard child that was in the old testament that physically couldn't enter into the temple right and and i didn't say that god did all right so we have to deal with that but we remember with ray having all these ones and types in the old testament that there is grace everybody sees the law in the old testament but man i see grace when i see ray happen right i see grace when i see ruth yes i see grace when i see these people that um that do things that seemingly is wrong that would be wrong now like having a prophet go marry a prostitute yes boy you better not do that in the new testament see what i mean but the old testament carried over and that's why that now let's bring it back to patience that's why that word patience is not in the old testament that word patience don't look up that word there's no word patience now abraham had patience right job had patience but it was only when paul come over and wrote about it in the new testament he showed that they had patience but they patience was not dealt with in the old testament because they weren't born again they didn't have anything to keep him patient job was a type and so was abraham was a type because remember abraham is not my father genetically okay abraham's not my father genetically but he is my father he is the father of the faith that i have yes okay he's the father of the faith that i have that's right i have faith because i can look back at abraham and see that he was 99 years old see he or he was 100 years old sarah was 90 years old and god changed them back and and gave them a child and gave them all these promises what about a man that said abraham wherever the souls of your feet remember when i preached on footprints means redemption everywhere you walk abraham's yours yours wherever you go doesn't matter it's all yours everybody it's all yours now buddy that's the possession that's right okay but he had patience all right now look let's look in james a second and we're gonna go up front be patient therefore brethren to the coming of the lord james 5 7 behold the husband when waited for the precious fruit of the earth and had long patience for it until he received the early and later reign james 5 and 8 be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord night grudge not one another brother unless you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience see as an example of patience behold we count them happy which endure now endures the same thing endure means patience you have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord and the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy i'm going to swap over here and read a quote on my patients number two now you may not be able to read all that but i changed the fonts a little bit let's read this one right here and then we'll quit and go upstairs sorry port louisiana 1956. no wonder paul could stand in the face of death and say oh death words are staying great where's your victory sure through tribulations he has learned the love of god through tribulations he had learned the love of god suffering brings patience remember i told you the other day i would call it suffering is a part of joy suffering is a part of happiness you can't be happy about something if you hadn't had a little suffering to go with it right suffering brings patience works tribulation to bring patience of course now patience makes love trust and when that bull got within about six or eight feet of me now some of you that don't know uh hank and martha that brother branham was walking through uh he was walking through a field one day going to pray for a man or any way he stopped on the side of the road and instead of going around the field he cut through the field jumped over the fence and went through the field well there was a killer bull in that fence that had already killed one man and had the big horns and he was huge and everything you know and he charged brother branham and brother brown said now look patience makes love and when that bull got within six to eight feet of me he just threw his feet out and stopped and he looked at me he looked this way he looked that way so depleted just quietened right down walked over and laid down i walked within five feet of that bull and he never even turned and looked at me i walked right out of that pasture what is it it was the love of god the power of god he had come to a place where he had patience he didn't turn around and run when the bull came stood his ground all right but what something came over him super natural not naturals natural we'd turn around but supernatural took over and his patience through suffering he's telling the story works tribulation to bring patients of course now patience makes love so being patient with the bull he was able to overcome that and the bible says in your patience possession your soul well you know what's going to happen is is we'll read the rest of it next sunday but patience patience brother around says faith because you how can you have how can you have patience with something if you don't believe if you don't believe that god's going to do what he said he's going to do why have patience that's why people in the world are just going all the time blah blah blah blah blah blah because they don't have patience brother ramsey had patience with god that he would do what what he said he was going to do true all right let's go oh sorry next week can you touch on the sin that's remind me i'll touch on that
