whatever they want to call it but we're getting through it we're good bro Kylie we good I was thinking out the wheat we had all those services with just the men we're here and this you know we got some good men singers but we can't compare with y'all girl uh Monica said I that's right no kidding I've been asking sister julienne nyla well maybe not nyla but I asked Trudy to sing that song Christian man named Crowder sings though yeah it's been two years I'll get to that the song has been out a couple of years my Christian men and crowd or not it and I really sometimes I I don't look at the person singing it I'll watch for the words and those words you are just beautiful all my hope is in Jesus we have no other hope without without Jesus Christ so I asked her two years ago if she would sing it so Crowder ain't got nothing on you two when you get to spirit-filled people singing the song it ain't like no other body singing in the world nobody can compare to this bride as far as singing and it coming from here not just here amen so god bless you by way of announcements you know what look look in your look grab you grab your little do this somebody just hold onto this like this look hold it like Freda free this upside down and holding up they go okay now look look look what I want you down see that so you can't mix it up this is June this is you I this is Joe Frieda

Wade say this is your calendar put it on your refrigerator and we're gonna read it look what it says it says well I'm gonna have different brother Bob it's gonna be preaching four swings tonight so we'll keep him in prayer I'll show the calendar Bible study look right here Bible study Jim this says everybody got that between six and eight o'clock and for brother Thomas sister Rebecca good to

right Kyle listen it's just a name that we that we associate with with the there you go Rachel Rebecca that's there you go any arse all right so there's Bible study from 6:00 to 8:00 all right it's good to have a brother Thomas sister Rebecca Anastasia with us they're from we've known brother Jim at Dalton for years and been out there hunting with him in the 90s this was my BC before I knew Christ so now you get to see the new me so brother Tom's been just kind of right-hand man but they moved to go to Gainesville so they're going to be close by with us so if you're looking see now look after second service we're gonna have a birthday party for sister Dale everybody got that same n okay then the youth is gonna conduct that service second service everybody got that say you ma'am okay then the youth is gonna stay for questions and answers in pizza youth brother Colley sorry young people yeah yeah I'm coming I'm coming and then look the ladies trip today you're gonna meet in my Sunday School class the ladies that's me and we don't have to meet a lot we just need to bring our fishing stuff y'all have to y'all got all them you know what color flowers is in the room and we don't care thing about that but Astra's going to be with you downstairs because the ladies are gonna take a trip that same Father's Day weekend we always have an annual fishing trip up in the mountains we've rented a lodge for all the brothers and the kids to come man oh sorry my son says I'm hitting my microphone sorry about them so it's keeping them awake at the moment so there's your calendar and then look flip that thing right over and there's July Saturday July the 4th brother Andrew Glover is going to be here we're gonna have a youth service starting at 11 o'clock you can come if you wish you older ones that's fine but you'll need to sit downstairs because this will be for the youth but if you want to come in some people will need help because we're going to serve hamburgers and hot dogs after the service is over and have stuff for the kids there buddy got that all right that's on July the 4th then brother Andrew will be here that Sunday also some as we make announcements just keep this with you even if you want to just keep it by your seat and you can just write little notes in it and it will help you understand when I start making these announcements we've never had times like this we've never had where we have to adjust and we're gonna have to adjust next Sunday because what happened was we had a bunch of people in my Sunday school class waiting for the small Sunday School classes to get finished well we're gonna take sister Monica's class and put it in my Sunday school class next Sunday all right she knows that so most of you don't need to know it but you can the ones you that come here that want to sit downstairs you can come into the big area next Sunday and be able to sit down there first instead of crowding up in my Sunday School class and that's my that's my fault I apologize all right so thank you everyone for being patient thank you everyone for coming thank you everyone for trying to do the best we can we still want to do the social distancing we still we don't practice it outside but we probably need to but just make sure you keep your hands washing and look out for the older people bro Kali this building has not been the same without you buddy and I mean that from the bottom of my heart I mean that from the bottom of my heart brother Kylie were he sitting at this moment that didn't exist when he first started coming to church here brother Tom the the building was like this the door was right there and that was a wall and the pulpit was right here and piano was right here and the little seat theater seats were right here that wasn't a door there that was in 1971 so we've come a long way from there and we love each and every one of you so that's turn in our Bibles I think that's about got it 2 Corinthians we've been speaking on the book of Esther we might get finished today if we don't we'll finish next Sunday I love the book of Esther it's one of the greatest books in the Bible because I can I can see my journey I can see all the characters just as we did in the Book of Ruth we can see those characters but we're going to read in Corinthians 10 verse 11 to get an example I'm sorry first first corinthians they'll pull it up on the screen here in just a second but we'll have it probably if we get finished I told brother Dale the other day or yesterday we were talking about stuff and I want to I want to try to go back over the feast days again so if you want to kind of get your mind wrapped around that a little bit because the feast days are to Israel we know that for a fact but it does have implications to you and I because it's the spiritual part there's seven feast days that actually fits just like all these book of Esther Book of Ruth all these were given for example those feast days we're not just for Israel only because we're spiritual Israel we have a Passover we have a firstfruits we have a right we have a ingathering we have a day of atonement but you see we don't have a day when Jesus come he said it's not a day now the day of the Lord is not one day it's a period of time and we know for a fact that the first four feasts were fulfilled by Jesus Christ but the other three feast have to be fulfilled by the bride okay so we'll get into that and those first four feasts were in April in April in May in two different places and then now the last three feasts are gonna be in like around October so we'll see how that God will show us something if we will pay attention that man so first Corinthians 10 sorry to keep you standing but they'll keep you awake a little bit longer let's bow our heads the Heavenly Father thank you Lord for this day thank you for the testimony that we can give of somebody like brother Colley and different ones that's been here Lord for forty some odd years Lord in standing at the post of duty in and to see them back again Lord it's just it's like I was thinking the other day it's just like David when the Ark of the Covenant was in a different country and God told him to go get it and bring it back to Israel my he danced he danced the dance he was so happy and Lord I'm so happy to see your bride coming back together this church coming back together and fulfilling the passage of scripture that says forsake not the assembling of yourself together and lord I pray that you'd be with us today in a special way not be a bystander but Lord be the active participant in this service you do the speaking you do the revealing father we pray that you'd just be with us give us strength bless the ones that are sick give the missionaries Lord in the foreign fields give them fruit for their labour father bless your little bride all around the world Lord I ask again Lord that you stay this plague this all over the world Lord that because now truly the whole world is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God we pray this you to be with us now and to further Melissa service in Jesus name we pray amen I want you to get if you don't get anything else get one thing's for sure everything that was written everything that was done everything that was portrayed out in these people was for your benefit and mine naca nominal world not anybody out there yes they're gonna be a cause and effect of what's going on we see that now but everything in this Bible was written for me and you for our example all right let's go to the very last scripture saved now all these things happened unto them for example these talking about Moses and all the different ones and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come now how specific is that because the Corinthians were not looking at the end of the world we are we're looking right at the end of the world it's already begun the end has begun you may be seated in the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now if you'll just for a little background for for brother Tom and sister Rebecca just for a second we've been going through the journey of Abraham we've been going through the journey of Ruth but we titled this the journey of a believer and we're on part 13 and we noticed that that in in these journeys we see four parts and each one of the journeys we see the four parts and we put them up here because the prophet of God told us he said even in when he was preaching the future home he said I taught the three works of grace since a child and I've not deviated one iota so we must believe as believers as the believers we must believe in the three works of grace justification sanctification of baptism of the Holy Ghost not that you believe this message the devil believes it he just can't manifest it you and I can but then also remember we come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the new birth and we see that that's what's required and that's what's been required down to the church ages until this age no one has been required to take a body change to go from Mortal to immortal while they're on the earth so we see that there was a fourth stage we we know that if we look at your types and we're going to see in the book of Esther threes and sevens but we know there's a four comes in there and then a lot of people before is an antichrist number but you've got to you've got to bring into redemption that if the that if the four beasts are for bugs eat the tree down as in the bride tree brother Brown said what it was a pummel worm canker caterpillar and locusts ate the tree down there had to be for life messengers bring that tree by God and we know the for combat beasts are the four messengers with a lion the Ox the man and the Eagle so we see that it's this Eagle Aegis where we're in so we can go higher we can be I don't say more revelaed but we've got more word available to us because we're required to go up this statue of a perfect man it's not a suggestion like the ten commandments the ten commandments are not a suggestion they're our requirement so as we come to the end time brother Brown did not come to bring us a new new birth he did not he can't bring us anything outside the Bible so he brought us what was already what had been hid down through the ages through the through the times and man our own ideas had covered it up and then now you come up to the end time and and you say well it's just believing the message no it's not it's making that word live in your life it's making that message to live in your heart but we believe according to the prophets message that we don't stop here it's like a brand-new baby you got a brand-new baby oh it's wonderful the baby's alive the babies the babies crying the baby's drinking milk but all of a sudden you take that baby prettiest baby in the world and put that baby in the closet somewhere it's still a baby it's still a human but if you don't feed it it's gonna die if you don't feed it it will die I'll promise you so that's what God wants us to do in the end time because even through the journey of Abraham we've seen we see all these positions because you come to to justification where what Abraham had to make a decision got called many people but Abraham responded and said I'll go alright same way with me in you same way with Ruth right in Ruth's first part she had to make a decision there was or fine that was Ruth Ruth the type of the bride or the type of the denominational Church though she didn't go on with God she went what back to her old denominational world but Ruth decided Abraham or Abram decided you and I must decide it's still free moral agency folks it's not just that you are a Christian and you just dropped on top of your head why did the Bible say this was all given for our example especially from the wins in the end of the world has come upon so we see that brother branham taught us all these three stages we see Abram and Abraham coming through this stage Ruth serving going through the going through the harvest and gleaning what gleaning what the preachers left for amen then you see that now remember we come to this spot here and we see that Abraham come to a place to where God accepted his faith member we read those quotes God accepted Abraham's faith turned him a new name giving the name Abraham and then he circumcised himself but he was circumcised as a type of God accepting his faith type of the baptism of the holy ghost same thing with you and I we have to have this circumcised the circumcision of our heart but now remember Abraham had one more step so did Ruth Ruth was resting root Boaz comes up he takes his shoe off he said I have bought I have bought Naomi's possession and he gets Ruth right all right so there's three stages three stages but we see when there's one more because remember there was a marriage and the conception there was a marriage and a conception there was a marriage and a conception they had a baby Isaac but 12 years later God brought Abraham to a place and said now take that boy up and kill him he wanted to see and place him just like we're placed now an adoption same way was with Ruth what was rewarded with Ruth was rewarded with Boaz being her husband and them having a child and taking that child and giving it to Naomi and then same way with you and I you and I must what well it's great to be born again it's great to be under the the power of the Holy Ghost but God wants a mature Christian he wants somebody with some maturity he don't want to have to bottle-feed us this church not been bottle-fed God didn't give me these teeth up here to chew milk with he gave me incisors and he gave me canines that you meet with a man so that's what we have here we have we're just were meat eaters I love the meat of the word and man I love the meat of the word because it's in our journey it's a continuation then God give us the Holy Ghost which had all four of the combat beasts the lion ox man and the eagle so where's the eagle the eagle is higher than anywhere else any other any other animal if you look and see as we've always said before the lion is very strong very powerful but he's only about this tall if he gets in grass about this tall well Tommy can't see very far but yet he's powerful that was the same that was what the word was the word was powerful in the first three church ages but they just couldn't see any further the ox was white a little bit taller but he wasn't he wasn't he didn't eat things he was of what he's a beast of burden through the through the dark ages he was a beast of burden all right then the man here we are standing a little bit taller and we got more intelligence anybody got me amen but the eagle can go high and look this way this way this way in this way they look higher than any other animal you can't go any higher than that so here we are in the Eagle Age and we'll see that we've come to a place that let's go ahead and skip all the way through to if you want to follow it being the book of Esther you can take your book out our will you can go ahead and and pull up Esther where it says King because each one had there's a character we know that there's a character in each one of these where Ruth you had Ruth was the was the bride or Foe was the denominational Church the old Jewish church was Naomi and Boaz type of Christ everybody got that same man should have because we've already been through this all right but see the book of Esther is the same way there's a king involved in this Kings not just the king of Rhode Island he's not just the king of Lulla Georgia this king rules from India all the way to Asia Asia Minor all the way across over into Rome in all the different places of the Medes and Persians so this King was a mighty king king of Soros he was not just like I said he wasn't just somebody that just well you know we who are you know everybody knew who he was so that King we're going to type in the book of Esther that King type - the king himself King Jesus King God whatever you want to call him Esther then is going to type the bride of Jesus Christ - die is going to type the church we know that because what did she do she refused further 'men of the word then Mordecai Mordecai is a little man he's going to portray a prophet that comes into the scene and he has a very very huge impact on Esther alright and her development and then we have Haman which is the devil and we're gonna look at Heyman even Haman's natural lineage takes him back to that so let's go to the book of Esther and let's read a few things that we're gonna we're gonna fly through this pretty good because we had it last last weekend because it's it's rather a long story simply because you've got so many players and you know what our journey our journey is not a microwave journey it's a crock pot it's a long journey we've been in this thing a long time and you know what God's let it go this long like black says thank you God just ran I'll assist thank you god she's Becca shaking her head now we just baptize these young people we baptize about six or seven or eight people since the first of the year well we've come to a place now to where we got the eleventh hour people on the field I believe I believe we have all the players here I believe God's over there raising 144,000 right now waiting on us to get out of the way so what are we doing here we're waiting on the last we're waiting on my kids and your kids hey man you got a blank you got a claim that and then claim it so here we are now it came to pass in the days of a source this is the king now watch this is the king who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty seven provinces like I said he wasn't just the king of a little Georgia with two hundred 200 residents he he impacted millions of people all right by the decisions that he made then on those days when the king of storr sat in the throne of the kingdom which was in Shushan the palace in other words he had a place in the third year of his reign he made a feast here we go with the threes in the sevens in his third year why wasn't it two or four or nine it's three in the third year of his reign he made a feast what is the feast it's a gathering unto all princes and his servants the power of Persia Medea and the nobles in other words this guy had a lot of power when he showed the riches of his glorious Kingdom verse for the honor of his excellent majesty many days even 180 days what word mercy s alone time and when these days were expired the King made a feast unto all the people you need to I've lost you need to keep scrolling okay and when these days were expired the key made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace both under great and small as we said before it didn't matter great and small in the feast was seven days we've had a seven-day feast the king called the feast on the day of Pentecost and he was gone for seven church ages and what's happening during this time we're at the very end of it amen in the court of the garden of the king's palace with white and green blues look at all the different colors of the different things purple silver verse seven and gave them drinks and vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another the vessels being diverse but made of gold you and I were gold tried in the fire but we're diverse what's telling brother Tom we've got many nations that are that are represented here countries they're represented in this congregation well God's calling all of us and he's what has he given us he's giving us the royal wine wine being a type of the Holy Ghost all right in abundance he didn't just pour it one time right in abundance according to the state of the King so here you got a king and this King has made a feast for seven days and and he's got this thing going on and you know what he wants to do he's got a queen over there he's got a queen over there and he wants to show her off he wants to show her off okay but what did that Queen do that queen is Baxter he hadn't got to the one that he really didn't know he was looking for see God's not that he knows but this King didn't know so look at verse nine also vast time which means beautiful hey look John admired that Church in the Book of Revelations he admired that beautiful church that was full of what dead man's bones harlots and all these different things so but Vashti the Queen made her a feast in a royal house which belong to the king so there's Bastile setting up another meeting here's God he's got his purpose he's got his seven church ages he's got his seven angels he's got his seven stars in his hand he's got his seven spirits that come to anoint that church age and then all of a sudden his bride that he thought was very loyal she said I don't want to have anything to do with that the property God tells us that she said King I'm not gonna do what you say anymore ain't that what the denomination world are doing now God never taught him a Trinity God never taught him they could cut their hair God never taught them they could do whatever they wanted to do amen so where did that come from that didn't come from the king but vast I get this idea that she's going to be her own she's gonna do her own thing that doesn't sound like the people today I'll do my own thing remember in the Bible it tells us that in the end time that seven women will take hold of one man and say don't tell us what to do but we want your name we'll see they want the name Jesus Christ but they don't know the name Jesus like Christ like brother Dale was talking about an intimate relationship with God in fact at one time had had an intimate relationship with the king but she decided that she wasn't going to have anything else to do she's going to have her own and on the seventh day when the heart of the king was married with wine he commanded as we were talking last Sunday it's kind of it's not it's not funny but the word is so perfect look may ma'am mr. harbona Victor a bagasse that's our and what's the last one carcass where the carcass is there will the eagle's be gathered carcass number seven he wasn't five or four he was seven the seven Chamberlain's that served in the presence of a source the king now what were they they were his advisors preachers everybody got that to bring vast I'm the queen in other words go out and preach the gospel tell the people about this queen but because he's going to say go bring vast I'm the queen before the king with the crown royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on but the Queen vast I refused now listen if you refuse a king normally that's death you don't refuse to come into a king of the King calls for you there's two things you don't do you don't go see a king unless he calls you and you don't not go if he calls you so what she sees now coz water denouement denominational world now they're dead they're dead to God they're dead to their King amen I'm just telling you what the Prophet told us he hated that God hates that denomination you don't hate the people but he hates that idea what the idea that they can do what they want to do that they've got a vast Isle that's going to refuse to come to the Kings commandment by his what his preachers therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him verse 13 then the king said two wise men which knew the times for so was it this King had it together he had seven Chamberlain and he had seven advisors now who watch who these advisors our then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the Kings manner toward all that new law and judgment and the next under him was carshena sets are now look here we go one two anetha three torches for marriage five marason death and ma'am you can ma'am you can these messengers ma'am you can means dignified but watch what the whole story is there's six other opportunities for somebody to come up with an idea because the King's got a dilemma here's his beautiful Queen that he's trying to show off to the world and she's saying I don't want to have anything to do with the game so he's calling these wise men and saying hey what can I do and the one that speaks up is number seven not the first one or the third one or the tenth one there's no tension but seven watch the seven prince of the Persian of Medea which saw the Kings face at which set the first in the kingdom what shall we do unto Queen Vashti according to the law because she has not performed the commandment of the king of sorts by the Chamberlain and then here number seven memucan answered before the king and the prince and the princess back style the Queen hath not done wrong to the King only but to all the provinces you know why because that mother has got daughters a man that mother got daughters and them daughters are gonna listen to Vashta and if they don't do something the whole kingdom is gonna say we don't need a man we don't need headship that's what that's what the denominational world are telling they don't need headship and ma'am you can't answer before the king and the princess banks not the Queen have not done wrong to the King only but also to all the provinces to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king of sorts for this deed of the Queen shall come abroad into all women what's a women top of churches so that they shall despise their what their headship they've despised the headship of the word when he shall be reported the King of sewers commanded by styler queen to be brought in before him but she came not so he's got a dilemma so ma'am you can comes up with this idea because watch likewise show the ladies of Persia Medea say this damn to all the Kings princes which has heard of the deed of the Queen thus shall there arrives too much contempt and wrath the whole country is going to be affected if it pleases the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes that it be not altered eleven hundred sermons sent to all the provinces that bastok came no more come no more listen when that seventh angel messenger hit the earth he condemned that denomination system and says she's dead and never will come back again that's the same thing this guy's telling them ma'am you can't say it look this is what we need to do that best I come no more before King the source and let the King give her royal estate unto another that is better than she now listen you and I are not better than the world but if you're the bride of Jesus Christ you're the best there is none none compared to you they'd be okay that Bank stock come no more in other words cut her off and let the King dur of her royal estate unto another that is better than she and when the Kings decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire eleven hundred sermons published and giving all over the world all the wives shall give to their husbands honor both to the great and small what did the property God come to do he came just like the Elijah come to restore the method of worship remember what Elijah did they jumped up and down on the altar and they spread it out everywhere and here comes Elijah sitting him stones back together same way with the prophet of God he'd come to set everything back in order plus plus if I got that because remember the message of Malachi forced to do two things restore the hearts of the children to the father's and bring those unknown mysteries that nobody ever looked that nobody ever looked upon what to change our body that's to get us at the top at the headstone because what's gonna happen is in this story if we ever get finished with it in this story you've got this girl she's not even on the scene yet extras not even here yet sure she's there she's alive she's walking around somewhere out in the world but this Queen has been replaced by Esther as we continue into the story and then when we get to the end of the story you don't even see the King anymore Esther's doing all the ruin with Mordecai so what a wonderful story I mean it ought to throw your heart that this was done for me and you so that we can look at that and say God you worked through that whole life for that whole scene of Esther because remember extra was not an original book that they were going to put in the Bible the scholars wanted it put in because it typed so much of Christ in the Jews and not letting them die on all these different things so it was given to me though so that I can look at it because look the saying please the king and the princes and the King did according to the word of memik and what a powerful word this man had for he sent messages into all the kings problems into ever promised according to the writing thereof and look and every person after their own language it was recorded in all different languages this must be a pretty important message that every man should bear rule in his own house why did brother Branham restore he restored headship votes headship is what was lost down through the church ages he restored the headship back the church and every man should rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language in other words none is going to be left out everybody is going to get this spreading of this message this seventh messenger that spoke to the king thank God we had a messenger thank God we had somebody we're gonna see in a minute we're gonna see Mordechai now come on the scene extra chapter two and after these things when the wrath of King of sorts was a piece he remembered last time what she had done and what was decreed against her then said the Kings servants that minister unto Him let there be fair young virgins stocked for the King sought for the King and let the King appoint officers and all the province of his kingdom he's looking for a bride so he's going to appoint preachers not a onefold not a press play but a fivefold ministry that God is going to work through flesh again to find his bride I may hurt your feelings but unit needs to be I guess if you believe that then said the King service that ministered unto Him let there be fair virgins and let the King appoint officers and all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins under Shushan the palace to the house of the women into the custody of Hagee the Kings Chamberlain now here's a guy that's a eunuch it's a man that keeps up with the women but he's been fixed where he can't you understand what I mean I don't have to go any further than that alright but you know what that word means if you dig deeper to your overlying meaning is a different meaning but if you look it up a little bit deeper that word or that name means the word so how better are we going to find a bride then through the word keeper of the why what are women church's brides and let their things for purification be giving them verse four and let the maiden which please it the King now look this is God just you got to go with me here for a minute you see what God is doing he's giving this responsibility this King is given that responsibility over to his people the seven Chamberlain's and the different ones he's giving you said well what about listen folks brother Branham said he said God never does tire of you telling him what his word says he knows what it says he knows what you gonna do but he wants you to speak it that's where we all get involved sisters brothers and all of us and let the mate in which please it the King be queen instead of last time and the thing please the King and he did so now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew now watch here we come this guy named Mordecai now those you've been around the message long enough you ought to know who the Mordecai means a little man his literal meaning of his name is and I can't remember what number it is in the in the Greek lexicon but his name was Mordecai which means little man we had a little man coming in town and this little man is going to guide this bride to the king now what did brother Brown do he guided the bride to the king now and she's shown the palace of a certain Jews name was Mordecai the son of jar the son of Shem I the son of Kish a Benjamite but now less this is this is not funny but you know what you know where you know where Kish came from don't you yeah who was the who was kiss his son Saul you say how can you type that lineage anybody ever know what brother Brown's family was like drunks alcoholics mother Brown said died with the boots on not much to be you understand what I'm saying so this guy that we're typing with Mordechai he couldn't have this great lineage he had to be the end of the type of brother branham he had to be a son of Kish a Benjamin Knight a Benjamite who had carried away now remember more to come if you'll remember the back of the story that we've told a long time ago some of the Jews in a dispersal state in Jerusalem a lot of them came out and went to this place because that was where all the hey that you still like the money that's where the money was was under these Medes and Persians they were carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and he brought up this girl now remember she had a name called Hadassah Hadassah was her Jewish name but she got a name change amen she got a name change now remember what Esther means we know extra means star but you know what Hadassah means but that's that means Myrtle Myrtle tree Myrtle so if you look in the bittakers 23:33 myrtle is used under the Feast of Tabernacles what do we what are we feasting under now brother Dale told you this morning under the feast of tabernacle all right so then you say well what are you saying I'm saying this esther is not just an extra of all the bride this esther is an end time bride this extra somebody that me and you can relate to and he brought up Hadassah that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither what father and her mother she had no ties supposedly no ties to the world when you become asked her do you have any eyes of the world no I know it's hard after every time I say after she turned to looked at me because this is an ester here we've got an extra Martinez and Esther wherever she is but every time I say something Esther looked over at me so anyway asked her up here okay after his uncle dart she need to father a mother the maid was fair and beautiful who Mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter in other words he took her in because she had a mother and a father and they died so she took him he took her in and he what he raised her as her own daughter as his own daughter listen focus properly in the end time people can say whatever they want to about him I really don't care but he was sent on this earth to get me to Jesus Christ he was sent to raise me right he was sent to show me what to do and that's what that Mordecai did because that girl Esther had no direction she had no father no mother no sisters no brothers so Mordecai comes on the scene and says hey I'll take you in I'll help you out I'll get you to the king that's our goal because listen if we look in the rest of the story there's thousands of virgins literally thousands of virgins that the king could have paid thousands but he picked her why because I'll show it to you just a second so it came to pass when the King command went and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together under Shushan the palace to the custody of Haggai because he raises us i see william branham didn't raise this folks you know that the words what raised us but he spoke the word through God spoke to brother Branham to give us a word to live by and man that Esther was brought also into the Kings house to the custody hey guy keeper of the women and the maiden pleased him and shipped ain't look she didn't come in and say blessed God I'm the only one I'm the only one in this place you gotta look at me no she comes in she obtains kindness of him of who hey guys she don't even know what you don't even know King yet and he speedily gave her her things for purification what's purifying you and I today the Word of God is what purifying us to this day which such things has belong to her and give her seven maidens which were meat to be given her out of the king's house and he preferred her and her maidens into the best place of the house of the women but now look extra had a secret after had a secret after was a Jew extra had a secret but Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred for Mordecai charged her that she should not show it so Mordecai saying look your Jew I know you're different but just hang on a little while cuz you're gonna need that difference in just a little while for something coming up and Mordecai look Mordechai walked every day before the court of the woman's house to know how Esther did he didn't come up one day and say alright Esther there's the king I'll see you later no he brought us sermon after sermon and years and years of labor to bring me in you and thank God they put it in booking tape for him so that we still got it and this Mordecai's willis today in word form telling us what to do and how to get to the king to know how yesterday and what became of her now when every maids turn was come in to go to a king to the king a source after that she had been 12 months look this is not like I said it's not a crock-pot journey I mean this is not a microwave journey this is a crock pot journey twelve months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purification and if you'll study this we don't have time to go through it I studied it not too long ago well several years ago because six months they would wash you six months in oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odours you'd think by then they'd smell good after a year of that but there's a there's an implication of that but we're not going to save time then the scam ever maiden into the king whatsoever she desired was given to her now here's the key with her out of the house of the women until the king's house in other words hey guy comes and says what do you need I want this beautiful dress with wherever where's my wife at with with glitter on it my wife hates glitter glitter and all this stuff real shiny so that so that it'll catch the attention of the King because remember it's not just a few women as hundreds it's thousands of women trying to get the attention of the king then thus came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given to her to go out with her out of the house of the women into the king's house in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of chefs cause the Kings Chamberlain which kept the concubines now look they were all concubines at one time all right she came in into the King no more except the King delighted in her and had to call her by name got to the Prophet he says now I call you bride now you have a name now when the turn of Astra now look look at me just a minute a king has looked at a thousand women must have a pretty good memory to remember all of them but when he meets one all the others go away he probably remembered this one had a had a dress on that had glitter and he this one had feathers in her hair and this one had makeup on their face and this one that had earrings brother branham tells us about that but when he come Esther's turn all she took was who she was she took her character into that room with the key now when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abigail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her for his own daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what hey guy the Kings Chamberlain in other words the word she closed herself with the word an Esther up came favoring the side of all of them that looked owner that got to the king yet so Astra was taken into King asaurus unto King a source into his house royal in the tenth month which is a month of T best in the seventh year not for not not not to seventh the seventh year of his reign he finally meets the bride that he's been looking for she don't have one no makeup she don't have on a pantsuit never had do you don't have brother I'm call him here Bob's don't have here bob was hanging over here and look what happened he instantly falls in love with her I'm gonna read you a quote right here I picked it they don't have it back there brother Brian said in the marriage of the lamb real quick Esther it was to become a bride but she didn't want none of the adorning of the world she wanted to go in to the king just like she was she adorned themselves like the Pentecostal women ought to with a meek humble spirit and when all these fancy first ladies came by with all their newfangled things and the King looked at them and put them in the chamber with the concubines but when this Esther came into his side he got a glimpse of that sweet humble meek spirit he said that's her go get the crown go get the crown and put it on her head that's how quick when God sees the Holy Ghost filled woman when God sees his true bride he don't mess around he said she's mine she's mine thank you for pulling it up that's okay so last row was taken in the king source into his house the tenth month in the seventh year of his reign and the King loved Esther above all the women and she obtained Grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of last time then the King made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants and it became not the Kings feast it became Esther's feast it became his Brides feast he was going to put his bride on display because he had found the right one he had found the right person even Esther's feast and he made a release and that word release in the original is rest hey listen when you find your bride you're not looking no more when you find your bride you're not looking the more you come to a rest and he made a rest to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king now watch real quick I got all this written down in my Bible excuse me now look and when the Virgin's were gathered together the second time then Mordecai said in the Kings gate now if you look back in your history the Kings gate was right at the king's palace now you couldn't go in unless the King called you but you were so close you could hear what was going on inside the palace that reminds you of something this prophet in the end time he wasn't out there sitting in the our room he wasn't out there sitting somewhere else he was sitting right at the Kings gate he had a connection to God like no one else but now he didn't use it for his own glory Mordecai everything he heard he told her everything he turned he had he heard he told Esther same way her brother branham thank God he couldn't keep a secret amen now look and when the virgins were gathered together the second time Mordecai sat in the Kings gate now look here's Esther Esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people so they didn't know she was a Jew as Mordecai had charged her for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai walk this like us when she was brought up with him she did what her prophet told her to do hey man she was loyal she was sweet she was almost she didn't say bless God I you need to you need to attend to me I ain't got no mama or daddy no she went that way she listened to Mordecai just like she listened to her own mom and daddy do we do we do we listen all we want to listen to what we want to listen to in those days while Mordecai said in the Kings gate to the Kings Chamberlain's now look this Mordecai guy he's pretty sharp and he gets revelation because he can hear where me and you can't hear that's what the Prophet does right he hears from God and then he gives it to us right Amen so he hears this plan of these two guys that want to kill the king and the thing was known to Mordecai and Mordecai did what Mordecai got a revelation from God that something was going to happen and he tells Esther because Esther can go see the king of the king an Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name and when inquisition was made in other words this is a natural story it was found out that for they were both hanging on a tree and it was written in the book of The Chronicles before the king so here this Mordecai guy he's he's right there at the Kings gate he gets to hear what revelation from God revelations from the King hello laughter three now this guy's coming into being here his name is Haman now there's a little bit of history behind Haman because everybody's got a lineage so Haman is the evil guy he's tough he's the type of the devil in this whole story there buddy got that and after these things did king of sewers promote Haman now you wondering where this is going but look if you'll go to I had it written down somewhere if you'll go to I think it's Ezekiel Ezekiel God's talking to the devil and he says I made you perfect I put you above all the anointed cherub I put you above everybody and that's what this King just did he promoted Haman now Haman the son of hat Hamid otha the a guy now if you'll remember back in your Bible the a gots or a guys in first time you'll 15 it was one of those Kings that Saul didn't kill maybe I got that but that lineage of Haman comes from Amalek the grandson of Esau and what did God tell Moses and all of joshua to do he said kill every malachite because remember when Amalek when they want israel one to go through the country in their exile or went in their Exodus the Amalekites wouldn't let them go through their land so God said kill them all get rid of not no more today will I have anything to do with it well that's where this guy Heyman came from this work the devil come from Devils gotta Lenny he was created perfect but he decided he made a decision to but it didn't he tried to justify itself he didn't get justified and advanced him and sent his seat above all the princes that were with him and all the king's servants that were in the Kings gate bowed and reverence Haman but now watch this for the King had so commanded concerning him but Mordecai bowed not you know why Mordecai knew his lineage Mordecai knew his natural lineage he knew where Haman came from he came from that Amalekite that Mordecai seek God told me never to bow to them people so he didn't listen the prophet of God many times the devil would come remember the devil came and said all your religion what's going on you know what God's taking you kid and taking your wife and what's going on here prophet he never bowed to the devil hey and Mordecai never either nor did him reverence then the king's servants which were in the Kings gate sent in the Mordecai why transgresseth now the Kings commandment he never answered him you'd have to he knew in his heart he wasn't going to bow to that Amalek lineage now it came to pass when they spate daily into him and he hearkened not unto them that they told Haman to see where the more to come matter Mordecai was no matter would stand for he had told them that he was a Jew and when Haman saw that Mordecai about not nor did him reverence then was Haman full of wrath and he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone for they'd showed him the people of Mordecai which is what the Jews listen the devil hates the Jews the devil has persecuted the Jews forever and when Mordecai they had showed unto him the people of Mordecai where for Haman saw destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of the source even the people Mordecai I've always said before you look at that spirit that was on Haman that spirit that was on Haman when Haman died that spirit went right over to the next to 8070 in Titus then then when Titus died that went right over to where Hitler and Mussolini and all the different ones because that spirit never dies because Haman is now he hates the Jews because of Mordecai he hates the Jews and he wants to get rid of all of them everybody got that now look we'll do this we'll get to this certain spot right here and then we'll stop the looking look what's going on here you got Haman which type of the devil in the first month that's a month Nissen of the 12th year of king of source that casper that is the law before Haman from day to day and from month to month to the 12th month that is the month adar and Haman said unto the king of stories there is a certain people there's a certain people that I hate because God's going to allow what's God always allowed the devil to do drive his people back to their homeland because Israel at this point in time Israel is not in their homeland not all of them so he's going to use the poor old devil to get everybody back in the homeland just like right now look at them over there now same thing and Haman said in the king of sorts there's a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people than all the provinces ain't that what happened to the Jews after 80 70 was what dispersed all over the world but remember God's not gonna deal with them until they get back in the homeland all right to watch this and their laws are diverse they go by that Old Testament huh they go by that Old Testament we don't go by that no more Haman says all right look but there's excuse me and their laws are diverse for all people neither keep day the Kings law oh my goodness therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them or let them live if it please the King let it be written that they may be destroyed and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver devils always gotten the money in his hand to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the Kings Treasuries and the King took his ring from his hand and he gave it to Haman now wait a minute we got a problem here God is taking his ring off and he's giving power to Haman where does that come from revelations chapter 6 power was given power was given Satan has no power he had had power given power was given unto the devil to do these things power was given unto Haman to do these things he was an enemy of the Jews and the king sent unto Him and the silver is given to thee of the people also to do with them at Saint what seemeth good to thee then were the Kings scribes called on the 13th day of the first month and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the Kings lieutenants and to the governor's that were over every province to the rulers of every people of every province in other words Satan sending his message out to everybody got that he's sending his message out listen the devil hates our ways the devil hates us we have diverse ways we have ways that are different from the world and Satan hates that what he loves all that out there he hates us when we do the things that God tells us to do so he hates these natural people but now watch what happened and the rulers of every people have ever promised according to the writing there of them to ever people after their language and the name of King Soros was it written and sealed with the king's ring and the letters were sent by posting to all the king's provinces to destroy the killing caused the perish because you know what the letter killeth the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life both young he's going to destroy all Jews young and old little children women in one day it's gonna be on the 13th day of the 12th month which is the month a doll ready to take the spoil of them for a pray the copy of the writings because look if we don't do what God says this thing around here is gonna kill us and you know what the devil is going to use this to kill us with it that's the devil gonna use nasty words and all the different things out there to kill us with no he's gonna take this right here and say oh you're okay don't worry about it don't worry you come Church when you want to listen to prophet and when you won't it really doesn't matter it just just make sure you read your Bible do your little devotion every day that's not what God wants he wants a Living Word the copy of the writings for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all the people that they should be ready against that day the post went out being hastened by the Kings commandment and the decree was given in Shushan the palace and the king and Haman sat down to drink but the City of Shushan was perplexed now we're gonna stop right there because it's 3:30 I'm not gonna go any further because we got communion to take and a meeting so we've come up this far we've had we've got Mordechai we've got Esther and Mordecai coming together we got the bride and the Prophet together now we've got the devil involved all right we got the devil involved and what's going to happen is is this is a whole key to it because God can't change this right here God can't change this word right you either live by it or die by it can't change it well that's what happens in Onan to this story because what they're going to do is is they're going to tell the king that Haman is going to destroy this whole Jewish Kingdom and the King lifts Adam and says I can't change my word that was the whole kingdom of the Medes and Persians when the Medes and Persians came into power when the when the word of the king was written it could not be altered this word can't be altered there's going to be billions of people that die because of this right here and go to hell but to me and you we know what it is it's a living word well that's what's gonna happen when we come to this place where the king says I can't change but you know what he done he gave them a chance to defend their self he gives us a chance to defend ourselves what he give us he give the Holy Ghost the real Victor is the baptism of the holy God can't change the word brother Donny but he sure can't let you defend yourself by this word of God right here that's gonna kill people but the King's gonna say look there's nothing I can do and you're gonna see in the story a little bit later this is the great part of the story that Esther was not called by the King so you can't go in to see the King without the King calling you certain death but Esther says if I die I die if I live I live I'm going in to see that King because my people are gonna die and what happens when she walks into the room she took her character into that room and sister Freda there's no way that that King was gonna kill her he was so happy to see her he said whatever you want and listen folks that's what God's telling us today whatever you want not to half my kingdom Earth there ain't no King of Kings Lord of lords that's wonderful she has him and it's not what I said brother ray that's what God said I'm just telling you what God said that the bride of Jesus Christ I was thinking about that this morning when brother Nelson King of Kings Lord Lord go all the way back to the book of Genesis before the fall Eve didn't have a name her name was Adam it was an uppercase in a lowercase that hasn't happened yet but what to restore back to restore back in Redemption it's King of Kings my bride is back again and not just back again sitting with twiddling our thumbs no power and authority has been given to me and you by the word of God let's stand to our feet musicians coming will sing us we'll just sing a song give somebody an opportunity to come and then brother Dale will come and we'll take communion we're gonna take communion here and downstairs so be reverent love you with the love of the Lord we thank you for all the people all you all that we do we've assembled a wonderful group of people I was thinking about yesterday God will give you the desire of your heart and that right and he's the only one that knows your heart but if you'll have brother Boyd if you'll have the desire of your heart to want to come to church regardless of the virus regardless of all these different whatever's whatever he'll know the desire of your heart he knows that sometimes you just want to show up or you don't want to show up but he knows the deep desire of a heart and a deep desire there's the other extra and the other desire of his heart is he knows the desire of your heart that King when you get over into the over end of this story you see Esther there comes another Esther you see Esther coming on the scene and you see the king backing off and that's what I love about that story it's not that the King but you know what that makes the King greater because he's got a queen that has his mind they don't have to quarrel about things when she says it I don't name the animals well that looks like a wine Rotom Garden didn't go now that's that's not one no he said that's exactly what I was thinking that's exactly what I was thinking why because they had the same mind that's what you and I have to have what we don't need a heart change heart as in the thumping thing we need a change up here this is where the change begins in the womb of your mind is where that change begins in the womb of Adam's mind had not been polluted yet so him and God would just like this I love what brother Brown said he said God and Adam and Eve standing in the Garden of Eden was true oneness see that's what we got to get back to now we look at it we go all those three people standing there if we're an observer but if you got a revelation Adam as the son of God Eve came from Adam there's only one standing there and that's the same ways what getting back to king of kings and Lord of lords he made us that don't ever try to justify yourself let's sing a song and then we'll have communion pray for brother Bob on Wednesday

touch real quick real quick well we'll meet him face to face and we'll go set somewhere for three and a half years and let God do what he needs to do here and then we'll come right back here as Billy Dale said we're gonna ride into that millennium and we're gonna be on a honeymoon we ain't got a work we got a toil Wingo struggle we're not got to do anything we're just there in a wonderful honeymoon we don't know even know we listen we don't know how to build a temple the Jews know how to build a temple how to build a temple but we're gonna let them build the temple and we're gonna walk in that thing and you know what's gonna happen it's just like when Solomon dedicated the temple the glory the Lord is gonna fill that building it's gonna fill that building and he ain't gonna be quiet
