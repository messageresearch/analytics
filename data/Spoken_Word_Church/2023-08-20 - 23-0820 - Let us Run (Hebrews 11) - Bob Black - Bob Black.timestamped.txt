[0:00] God bless you Saints amen good to be in
[0:03] the house of the Lord
[0:05] it's brother Aaron taking this morning
[0:10] changed things up a little bit this
[0:11] morning
[0:13] let's go the Lord in prayer Lord we're
[0:15] so grateful to be able to gather
[0:16] together this morning Lord and I pray
[0:18] Lord that you'll just bless our study as
[0:20] we study these things out the things
[0:21] that are said Lord that will be edifying
[0:23] to your people Lord help us to
[0:25] understand Lord and place ourselves into
[0:26] scripture granted Lord that you'll just
[0:28] be with brother Aaron and this morning
[0:30] and myself for this afternoon that
[0:32] you'll bless the services today Lord and
[0:33] be with us Lord we ask in your name
[0:36] amen
[0:38] now
[0:40] um all right you know we're closing in
[0:42] on uh there's only I think 13 chapters
[0:45] in Hebrews or almost to the end
[0:47] um I'm uh just praying and trying to
[0:51] seek the Lord's guidance on which way to
[0:54] go next I'm thinking about
[0:55] um maybe doing a little study on the
[0:57] church ages
[0:59] um or the book of Romans but if anybody
[1:01] has any suggestions let me know if you
[1:03] want something like a deep study on
[1:06] something that's just been laying on
[1:08] your heart let me know and we'll we'll
[1:10] consider that
[1:13] Hebrews 11 39 and 40 were just kind of
[1:16] wrapping up Hebrews 11 it says these all
[1:19] having obtained a good report through
[1:21] faith receive not the promise God having
[1:24] provided some better thing for us that
[1:26] they without us should not be made
[1:28] perfect and we were talking about what
[1:30] Perfection Perfection comes from Christ
[1:32] he's the one that's perfected so what's
[1:35] happening as you as you receive the word
[1:37] you become the word you take on his life
[1:41] and his characteristics and you are
[1:43] actually becoming
[1:44] um God manifested in Tabernacle in flesh
[1:47] and so that's the process of perfection
[1:49] that as you perceive the word you are
[1:51] you are being built into the stature of
[1:54] a perfect man and that completes your
[1:55] profession
[1:56] and so those that are in the ground are
[1:59] waiting on us to come to that place so
[2:01] that we will pull them out of the ground
[2:03] like a magnet as they as they uh the
[2:05] word comes to the word and then
[2:08] um you read in Revelation chapter four
[2:10] where the that last trumpet sounds and
[2:13] uh John heard a voice calling come up
[2:15] and said we are pulled up by that same
[2:18] word that we've heard we've become the
[2:20] word and it pulls the dead Saints out of
[2:21] the ground and we hear the word and it
[2:23] pulls us up in a Rapture and so
[2:26] it all hinges on us yielding ourselves
[2:29] and and uh becoming fervent and as we
[2:32] see in Hebrews chapter 12 when we get
[2:34] into that Paul just all through the book
[2:37] of Hebrews encourages us to not don't
[2:39] give up you're running a race don't give
[2:42] up and what is our race for the finish
[2:43] line is perfection the Finish Line
[2:46] you're you're racing you're uh going
[2:48] through this this process of cleansing
[2:50] of the process of of the the virtues
[2:54] being birthed into you
[2:56] being manifested in your life and and
[2:59] and until you're racing it's a it's an
[3:01] endurance contest to not give up and you
[3:05] and you know you see we see so many that
[3:08] kind of drop off and give up and that's
[3:10] what Paul is trying to get impress on us
[3:12] in in Hebrews chapter 12 don't give up
[3:15] don't just keep keep going keep moving
[3:18] and the statue of a perfect man brother
[3:20] Brown would say he said you get it these
[3:22] people who died in here are depending
[3:24] and waiting on us
[3:26] so this church has got to come to
[3:29] perfection in order to bring the
[3:31] resurrection
[3:34] excuse me
[3:35] and they're under Souls under the altar
[3:37] waiting for this church to come to us
[3:40] Perfection that when Christ does come
[3:43] and this church you see is coming
[3:45] smaller in the minority
[3:47] now you think about that it shouldn't
[3:49] shouldn't surprise us with all the
[3:50] messages brother Brown preached about
[3:51] wanted a million and how Enoch really
[3:53] types the Rapture church and and there
[3:56] was eight went over on the r but one
[3:57] that took a Rapture and so forth it's
[3:59] coming down you oh you can see all
[4:01] around people dropping away and people
[4:03] leaving and things because they're just
[4:04] they can't they're not running the race
[4:06] well like Paul said but it shouldn't be
[4:08] a surprise to us because Paul and
[4:11] brother Branham told us these things
[4:12] Paul the Bible says there's going to be
[4:14] a great Falling Away
[4:16] and he said it would come look what he
[4:18] said it's a whole lot sharper than that
[4:20] but just like to write that across there
[4:22] see a whole lot sharper than what you
[4:24] and I would think it's come to a
[4:26] needlepoint
[4:27] a needlepoint
[4:29] now now that's just not in people but
[4:32] that's also in doctrine that your
[4:33] Doctrine is going to become so razor
[4:35] home down where you know what you
[4:37] believe in you know what you're talking
[4:39] about you know whether how to be
[4:41] baptized and how to be born again and
[4:42] how to grow and what the son of man is
[4:44] and all these things keep build up
[4:47] building up precept upon precepted let's
[4:49] hone down
[4:50] hone down to Precision until the church
[4:53] and the minority has got to get into a
[4:55] place until it's the same kind of a
[4:57] Ministry that this left because when
[4:59] this headstone comes back the same kind
[5:01] of what same kind of Life same kind of
[5:03] person same kind of deity and you and I
[5:06] God manifesting us the same way that he
[5:09] was manifested as he walked the shores
[5:12] of Galilee God In the Flesh back again
[5:15] so Paul in Hebrews chapter 12 says
[5:18] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[5:20] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[5:22] let us lay aside every weight
[5:25] and the sin which does so easily beset
[5:28] us and let us run with patience the race
[5:31] that is set before us
[5:34] now I've got this picture
[5:36] what Paul is trying to impress upon us
[5:38] that we've got all these people in
[5:40] Hebrews chapter 11 that are cheering us
[5:42] on and I've got a runner here that's
[5:43] running and he's getting like in a
[5:45] marathon and he's got he's he's clapping
[5:47] the hands of people or if you could look
[5:49] over the just see the ones in Hebrews 11
[5:51] looking over the banistry of Heaven at
[5:53] us what oh they're cheering us on
[5:55] because they know that without us they
[5:58] can't be made perfect
[6:00] so we've got all these examples that we
[6:02] can look to of people that that ran the
[6:04] race well by looking not at their
[6:06] circumstances but looking straight to
[6:08] what God promised and so that's how you
[6:10] that's how you run this race ignoring
[6:13] all the people that have preached false
[6:15] Doctrine ignoring all the people that
[6:16] ain't living the life ignoring all the
[6:18] people that say things bad about you
[6:21] ignore it and just look straight to
[6:23] Christ and that's how you win let us run
[6:26] with patience the race that is set
[6:28] before us patiently you know you come to
[6:30] church it's Wednesday like brother
[6:32] Louise has preached on it's the mundane
[6:35] you know just you're just going through
[6:37] your actions of a Christian just Sunday
[6:40] and Wednesday Sunday and Wednesday with
[6:42] patience because you're running a race
[6:43] and and things are happening when you
[6:45] come to church maybe it doesn't seem
[6:47] like it but you're you're slowly and
[6:49] steadily being changed
[6:52] know you're not in First Corinthians 9
[6:54] 24 4 says Paul's talk he loves to talk
[6:57] about this race know ye not that they
[6:59] which run in a race run all but one
[7:01] receiveth the prize so run that ye may
[7:04] obtain in other words he's saying don't
[7:08] run haphazardly and like well
[7:10] I guess I guess I'm here I guess now
[7:13] that I'm in church it'd be a good time
[7:15] to take a little snooze and I hadn't had
[7:18] a good nap all week so now that I'm in
[7:20] church it's time to just rest a little
[7:22] bit but run like you're going to you're
[7:25] like you're you're involved run like
[7:27] you're engaged run because you you know
[7:29] what you're running for when we come to
[7:31] church we know what we're doing here
[7:33] we're running to for for Perfection
[7:35] there's a there's a reason why we're
[7:37] here and Paul and and so he said
[7:40] wherefore seeing we also are
[7:42] compassionate about what's so great
[7:42] cloud of witnesses what to say it aside
[7:44] every weight and the sandwich does so
[7:46] easily beset us and let us run with
[7:48] patience the racing has set before us
[7:51] so we're running
[7:52] and in First Corinthians again know ye
[7:55] not that they was running a race run all
[7:57] but one received the prize so run that
[7:59] you may obtain and every man that
[8:01] striveth for the Mastery is temperate in
[8:04] all things now they do it to obtain a
[8:06] corruptable crown but we an
[8:08] Incorruptible somebody that's just
[8:10] running a normal race is running to just
[8:13] obtain a crown that you could you it
[8:15] might be a plastic crown that you could
[8:16] throw in the crack trash and it just
[8:19] it'll rot in the landfill but we're
[8:20] Racing for a crown that will never pass
[8:23] away
[8:24] I therefore so run not as uncertainly so
[8:26] fight eye like a boxer so far not as one
[8:29] that beat at the air I'm not just
[8:30] swinging at the air and not doing
[8:32] nothing the series impressing on us that
[8:35] we know what we're doing we have there's
[8:37] a purpose to these things
[8:39] but I keep under my body and bring it
[8:41] under subjection into subjection unless
[8:43] that by any means when I have preached
[8:45] to others
[8:46] I myself should be a Castaway but what
[8:49] he's trying to say let's not run the
[8:51] race and then halfway through the race
[8:53] you're something that everybody else
[8:55] passes along and they they look you know
[8:57] in life there are shipwrecks along the
[8:59] way where you can look at as a lesson to
[9:01] yourself to say well I don't do that and
[9:05] so you he's saying I don't want to be
[9:07] one of those examples that other people
[9:08] can look at like that a shipwreck where
[9:10] you can say well don't go to those rocks
[9:12] over there don't do like that preacher
[9:15] did right there that I myself should be
[9:17] a Castaway but so how are you going to
[9:20] avoid those things
[9:21] Paul tells tells us in verse 2 looking
[9:24] unto Jesus the author and finisher of
[9:27] our faith who for the joy that will set
[9:30] before him endure the cross he's talking
[9:32] about the race now he endured the
[9:34] endured all these hard sufferings and
[9:37] things
[9:38] despising the shame and is set down at
[9:40] the right hand of the Throne of God
[9:43] for consider him that endured such
[9:46] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[9:49] lest ye be weird and faint in your minds
[9:52] contradiction of Sinners why why would a
[9:54] sinner put put the sinless one on the
[9:56] cross why would they treat him that way
[9:58] that's a contradiction lest ye be weird
[10:01] and faint in your minds ye have not yet
[10:03] resisted under blood striving against
[10:06] sin
[10:07] he's telling everybody you haven't you
[10:09] haven't done like Jesus did you haven't
[10:11] walked that Via De La Rosa with with all
[10:14] your that your back beating up and your
[10:18] your kidneys showing and you hadn't got
[10:20] to a place like that so you're you say
[10:23] well boy it sure is hard coming to
[10:25] church and people maybe say things that
[10:27] I don't like and preach maybe I get
[10:29] pre-stone every now and then can you not
[10:31] endure you haven't come to a place where
[10:33] you're walking like Jesus did yeah you
[10:35] if you don't have blood dripping into
[10:37] your eyes and maybe maybe one of your
[10:39] eyes has gone blind or something because
[10:41] the thorn is sticking into it you hadn't
[10:44] come to it that's what Paul's saying
[10:45] don't be weary don't faint when you get
[10:48] to a place where you think like it's
[10:49] real tough and everything and and
[10:52] because he's saying endure what is
[10:55] endurance the fact or power of enduring
[10:57] and unpleasant or difficult process or
[11:00] situation without giving away
[11:03] ha
[11:05] oh you know you know the Bible even says
[11:07] if you put your hand in the plow and
[11:08] turn back you're not even worthy of the
[11:10] Kingdom to give up to give up that's
[11:12] what Paul was stressing if you give up
[11:14] if you if you come to church a little
[11:16] bit come to church and it's preached you
[11:17] get preached on maybe a little bit and
[11:19] things you know it's if sometimes you
[11:22] feel like you're getting priest on the
[11:24] the antidote for that the fix for that
[11:25] is keep growing a little bit until you
[11:28] don't feel that you're getting preached
[11:29] on
[11:31] that's what this is right here
[11:34] if you if you don't have these things
[11:37] that are on the board back here that
[11:39] just keep growing and then then you'll
[11:40] come to a place like brother Adam said
[11:42] until you don't feel like you're getting
[11:43] pre-stone anymore so when you get when
[11:45] you feel like you're getting something
[11:47] you know you just feel like your
[11:48] spirit's vibrating or something
[11:49] something's out of kilter when the
[11:51] word's going forth oh you got to have
[11:53] enduring power you got don't give up
[11:56] don't give up and just go home and say
[11:57] well I I don't like I don't like the way
[12:00] they talk to me or whatever you just
[12:01] keep keep running a race like this
[12:04] person that I've got a picture of here
[12:05] going up the mountain
[12:07] you got to keep going you got to keep
[12:09] moving don't stop
[12:11] the endurance is the ability to
[12:13] withstand the hardship or adversity
[12:18] now talking about shipwrecks along the
[12:21] way you you and I both know we we can
[12:23] look around and see people that have
[12:24] given up well I'm just going to stay
[12:26] home and just I'm going to listen to
[12:27] tapes because I can't endure that's not
[12:30] what God wants you to do he don't want
[12:31] you to separate yourself and be isolated
[12:33] just you just keep running the race
[12:36] keep pressing on Paul would say in verse
[12:38] 5 and ye have forgot I know this is a
[12:41] little bit small so y'all just I'll just
[12:43] read it I'll just listen
[12:45] ye have forgotten the exhortation which
[12:47] speaketh unto you as unto children my
[12:49] son despise not thou the chasing of the
[12:52] Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[12:55] him for whom the Lord loveth he
[12:57] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[13:01] he receiveth and if ye endure chastening
[13:04] God dieth with you as with sons
[13:08] for what son is he whom the father
[13:10] chastes nothing not
[13:12] but if ye be without chastisement
[13:16] whereof all our partakers then are ye
[13:19] bastards and not Sons so that's how you
[13:23] know that's how you know that God cares
[13:25] about you is he'll put somebody behind
[13:26] the pulpit to correct you he'll give you
[13:28] people relationships in your life where
[13:30] people will say what you don't need to
[13:32] be doing that don't put your money in
[13:34] that do this or whatever but you got
[13:36] people in your life that'll tell you how
[13:38] how to live and how to do and that's how
[13:40] you know that God loves you is because
[13:42] he's trying to straighten you up that's
[13:44] that's why oh people get so bent out of
[13:46] shape about preachers preaching on
[13:48] coming to church but it's for your good
[13:50] because we're running a race for
[13:52] Perfection and how you going to get
[13:54] perfected outside of the word how you
[13:56] going to get perfected if you're not
[13:58] under subjection to the word if you
[14:00] can't and you're chastening then what
[14:03] does what does he say there in verse 8.
[14:05] if he can't endure if you can't endure
[14:08] chastening then you the the the calls is
[14:10] because you don't know who your daddy is
[14:12] oh see well that's why you got to be
[14:14] born again when you're born again then
[14:16] you know who your daddy is and then you
[14:18] can take Chad kazak because you know why
[14:20] it's coming you know the reason for it
[14:23] is for your perfecting and you want to
[14:25] be a better Christian and you want to
[14:27] walk better and do better and and act
[14:29] more like Jesus
[14:31] come on now I don't draw up on me
[14:35] y'all know this is true
[14:37] exhortation of Divine Healing brother
[14:39] Brown said now sometimes I would admit
[14:41] this that our heavenly father
[14:42] sometimes I apologize that's a little
[14:44] bit small I wouldn't expect it to be
[14:46] that small I was doing this late at
[14:48] night and uh I I usually do a better job
[14:51] of blowing this up so y'all forgive me
[14:53] y'all gonna show me some Grace yeah all
[14:55] right
[14:56] that our heavenly father sometimes
[14:59] chastens us with sickness
[15:01] that's so these are quotes on how God
[15:04] chastens us when we do wrong and we need
[15:06] to be corrected that our heavenly father
[15:08] sometimes chastens us with sickness
[15:11] permitting Satan to do it to try us
[15:13] sometimes to bring us back
[15:17] if we go out of the way then our
[15:20] heavenly father might let something
[15:21] happen to us to bring us back right so
[15:24] that's one way that God chases that he
[15:26] gets that gives us a little good
[15:28] whipping by letting us get real good and
[15:31] sick
[15:32] to make us realize that we need God to
[15:36] get things straightened up to be to to
[15:38] have a little old me moment oh oh I need
[15:41] oh God I need you on the scene you know
[15:44] when you get a real good case of the flu
[15:46] or something and you're laying there you
[15:48] you start thinking different don't you
[15:50] oh Lord I need you and the message the
[15:54] supernatural he said our heavenly father
[15:56] we come to thee on this sabbath day
[15:58] raining on the outside we might call it
[16:00] Gloom hazy rainy weather now look what
[16:03] he's trying to say gloomy hazy rainy
[16:05] weather but how could the farmer put in
[16:08] his crops if we didn't have much
[16:09] moisture this spring there'd be no food
[16:12] raised ground would be dry people would
[16:14] perish we we realize that this is like
[16:17] experience of a Christian sometimes we
[16:20] have to go through terrible chastisement
[16:23] chastening of the Lord many things to
[16:25] correct us that will be fruit bearing
[16:27] Christians so those gloomy hazy periods
[16:31] of our life where things don't seem like
[16:33] they're going right
[16:35] oh that that's what where God is molding
[16:38] your character I I was talking to a
[16:41] young person the other day about how he
[16:42] just could not understand how some like
[16:44] young young people can be mean to one
[16:45] another sometimes and people were
[16:47] talking bad about him and stuff and
[16:49] saying horrible things but you know you
[16:51] look back at those times where some
[16:52] maybe it may be another Christian said
[16:54] something mean and horrible and even
[16:56] what at what it is God is molding your
[16:58] what's he doing is he's molding your
[17:00] character to a place where you don't
[17:02] react badly anymore well maybe at first
[17:06] you wanted to get revenge you wanted to
[17:08] get back at that person but God is using
[17:11] that to mold your care he's using the
[17:13] gloomy dark times to change you for your
[17:18] for your better yeah and the layout of
[17:20] see in church age he said now he says to
[17:22] his own as many as I love I rebuke and
[17:25] chasten to rebuke is to prove to rebuke
[17:29] to reprove is to expose with a view to
[17:33] correction
[17:34] chasing does not mean to punish it means
[17:37] to discipline because the subject's
[17:39] amendment is in mind
[17:42] like a Potter
[17:44] making something
[17:46] amen and the layout of Satan Church he
[17:48] said here it is now set forth the love
[17:49] of God
[17:50] he desired and loved a family of his own
[17:53] a family of sons like himself
[17:56] there before him lies all mankind as one
[17:59] lump of clay
[18:00] out of that same lump he will now make
[18:02] vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the
[18:05] choosing will be his own choosing then
[18:07] those chosen ones born of the spirit
[18:09] will be trained to conform to His Image
[18:13] in their walk
[18:14] so what Paul's asking us is can you
[18:16] endure the training when you come to
[18:19] church and I I don't want to be trained
[18:21] to be a Christian then it shows that
[18:23] you're not
[18:25] it shows that you're like Paul said to
[18:28] be plain a bastard
[18:30] he reproves with all long-suffering and
[18:33] gentleness and mercy he chastens with
[18:36] Nell's guard hands sometimes this Potter
[18:39] must take the vessel he is working on
[18:41] and thoroughly break it down in order
[18:43] that he may rebuild it exactly as he
[18:45] desires now that's what's painful when
[18:47] you get broken down when you're broken
[18:49] down wrestling with the angel like Jacob
[18:51] was wrestling at night and you're just
[18:53] broken down and you're tore up and
[18:55] there's snot all over the floor and
[19:00] that's where God wants to eat you
[19:02] sometimes
[19:03] but it is love
[19:05] that is his love
[19:07] another way of his love there is not
[19:09] there cannot be
[19:12] in Revelation Chapter 3 Verse 18 it says
[19:15] I counsel thee divide me gold tried in
[19:17] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[19:19] white raiment that thou mayest be
[19:21] clothed and that the shame of thy
[19:23] nakedness did not appear and anoint
[19:25] thine eyes with ourselves that thou may
[19:27] see as many as I love I rebuke and
[19:30] chasten so you know he loves you when
[19:34] you're getting straightened up
[19:36] you know he loves you when you're
[19:38] getting straightened up
[19:40] and Jesus at the door he said notice
[19:42] what our lord said all that live Godly
[19:44] in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[19:46] every son that cometh to God must first
[19:49] be tried chasten child training now
[19:53] that's what we don't like we don't he's
[19:55] going to try you to see if your
[19:57] character holds he's going to try you to
[19:59] see if you're patient if you really got
[20:01] patience give you put you in a little
[20:03] circumstance to see if you if your
[20:05] patience really holds put you in a
[20:06] circumstance to see if you're going to
[20:08] fly fly off the handle with a temper to
[20:10] see if that Temperance really hold or
[20:12] not he'll put you through trials and
[20:14] Things No Exceptions every son that
[20:18] cometh to God
[20:19] must be tried
[20:21] and the message Fellowship he said and
[20:23] many people think sometime because
[20:25] disaster happens to a Christian oh he
[20:27] got off the will of God they left the
[20:29] church they went out sometimes that's
[20:31] not right because God chastens every son
[20:34] that comes to him he cleanses him and
[20:37] purges him and tries to see if he will
[20:42] stand that's what he was doing in the
[20:44] time of job
[20:46] now let's look let's take a closer look
[20:48] at how God chastens you now chasing
[20:51] means to correct by punishment or
[20:53] suffering
[20:54] to put you through a really hard time
[20:57] now now it's one way he'll chasing you
[20:59] is to give you you'll you'll you'll be
[21:01] pricked in your heart when you do
[21:03] something wrong you know you've done
[21:04] something wrong maybe you slip up and
[21:06] you go you go drink some alcohol or
[21:08] something you know you shouldn't be
[21:09] doing that and boy you get away what
[21:11] kind of whipping you get you down on the
[21:14] inside something will be grieved and you
[21:16] just won't be able to stand it you won't
[21:18] be able to you won't be able to get away
[21:19] from that prayer closet it'll be drawing
[21:21] you to just get down on your knees and
[21:23] make things right and and that's the
[21:26] kind of whipping oh oh you you know that
[21:28] something Supernatural is taking place
[21:30] when you mess up and up down on the
[21:32] inside you just can't stand it you say
[21:35] something harsh to somebody and
[21:37] something on the inside you know I've
[21:39] heard people say well like almost like
[21:41] there's something wrong with you if you
[21:43] have regret when you do something wrong
[21:44] no no that that's right that's the good
[21:47] that's that's a sign that God is dealing
[21:49] with you that that that's almost the
[21:51] same one of the evidence is that that
[21:53] God is living in your soul is when you
[21:55] mess up that you feel bad about it and
[21:58] you want to go make it right that's a
[22:00] good little whipping from God that
[22:02] there's something on the inside that's
[22:03] calling you and drawing you to make
[22:05] things right
[22:06] unpleasant circumstances
[22:09] that God will make you that God will
[22:11] bring you through a path of your journey
[22:13] where that it's gloomy and cloudy and
[22:17] and uh uh everything is not going right
[22:20] maybe a situation at work where you're
[22:22] just getting pounded and of course what
[22:24] he's trying to get you bring you to a
[22:26] place where you get on your knees and
[22:27] you just have confidence in God that
[22:29] he's going to bring you through maybe
[22:31] maybe an unpleasant circumstance where
[22:32] you're looking at your kids doing wrong
[22:34] and you're oh God something's got to
[22:36] happen and you begin to put all of your
[22:39] confidence and all of your faith in God
[22:41] instead of your own abilities that's
[22:43] what the chastening of the Lord does it
[22:45] brings you to a place where you it's
[22:47] like you're all the juice is getting
[22:49] squeezed out that's why we shouldn't we
[22:52] rejoice in chasten and Chase oh when you
[22:55] look at it this way chastening is is is
[22:58] is such a beneficial thing for us your
[23:02] loss of Peace relationship fractures
[23:04] physical illness or even death in First
[23:07] Corinthians 11 30.
[23:09] now that's a good a good you see maybe
[23:12] one of your loved ones will pass away
[23:13] and you begin to really think about
[23:15] things differently maybe a young person
[23:17] looking at that to recognize that you're
[23:19] not going to be able to live in this
[23:20] Earth forever the way that you are you
[23:23] begin to see things different you begin
[23:25] to that's God chastening you
[23:28] now we can see in the cycle of Judges
[23:30] that God will chasten them in the Old
[23:32] Testament the Israelites would they
[23:34] would get real happy and prosper and
[23:36] everything would be going really well
[23:38] and then they start to get away from God
[23:39] and what would he do he'd he'd start
[23:42] squeezing them letting the amorites come
[23:44] in and beat up on him a little about a
[23:46] while until they started looking back to
[23:48] God for Faith and straightening up their
[23:50] life getting things getting things
[23:52] straight again and then God would send
[23:53] them a judge and they'd put their
[23:55] confidence in God and God would deliver
[23:56] them and they could they would keep
[23:59] repeating that over and over and over
[24:01] again
[24:02] as many times as they would repeat it
[24:04] God would squeeze them again
[24:06] Hebrews 12 verse 9 says furthermore we
[24:10] have had fathers of our flesh which
[24:12] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[24:15] shall we not much rather be in
[24:16] subjection unto the father of spirits
[24:18] and live
[24:19] for they verily for a few days chasing
[24:22] us after their own pleasure for what
[24:24] does that mean for their after their own
[24:25] pleasure you got a father in the flesh
[24:27] maybe he's running a business and he's
[24:28] like you got to get up and he'll you
[24:30] know yank the covers off of you or
[24:32] whatever time to go to work and he's
[24:33] chasing you for his play he wants he
[24:35] wants the money for the business he
[24:36] wants to keep the family prosperous or
[24:38] whatever he wants you know that kind of
[24:40] thing but that's not God is doing it for
[24:43] your Prophet he's chastening you not to
[24:46] make money or for anybody to be popular
[24:48] or all those kind of things but he's
[24:49] doing it he's chasing you to mold you
[24:51] into the character of a real Christian
[24:54] but he for our Prophet that we might be
[24:57] partakers of his Holiness now no
[24:59] chastening for the present seemeth to be
[25:01] joyous
[25:02] but Grievous nevertheless afterwards
[25:06] amen it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of
[25:08] righteousness unto them which are
[25:10] exercised thereby and I think all of us
[25:13] this morning that have gone through
[25:14] chasing and you can look back and
[25:16] remember the chastening in in a more
[25:19] positive light than when you were going
[25:21] through it you can look back and thank
[25:23] God that God took me through those times
[25:25] it was it was rough maybe when you were
[25:28] getting bullied and people were saying
[25:30] rough things and maybe you were sick on
[25:33] your bed a hospital bed or whatever but
[25:35] when you look back and see how God
[25:37] brought you through those situations and
[25:39] changed you for the better
[25:41] it's all worth it wherefore lift up the
[25:45] hands which hang down
[25:47] and the feeble knees and it makes
[25:50] straight paths for your feet unless that
[25:52] which is lame be turned down to the way
[25:55] but let it rather be healed what is he
[25:58] saying he's saying be encouraged all
[26:01] these things are for your benefit so
[26:02] just keep like this man here going down
[26:04] the going down the trail just keep
[26:06] walking keep going because you're
[26:08] running a race and you've got to endure
[26:10] and you've got to be patient don't get
[26:12] discouraged
[26:14] follow peace with all men he's saying in
[26:16] verse 14.
[26:18] and Holiness with without which no man
[26:21] shall see the Lord looking diligently
[26:23] lest any man feel of the grace of God
[26:25] lest any root of bitterness bringing up
[26:28] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[26:30] lest there be any fornicator or profane
[26:33] person as Esau who for one morsel of
[26:35] meat sold his Birthright for ye know how
[26:38] that afterward when he would have
[26:39] inherited the blessing he was rejected
[26:42] for he found no place of repentance
[26:45] though he saw that carefully with tears
[26:47] and this will be a good place to stop
[26:50] for ye are not come unto the mount that
[26:53] might be touched and that burned with
[26:55] fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and
[26:58] Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and
[27:01] the voice of Words which voice they that
[27:03] heard and treated that the word shall
[27:05] not be spoken to them anymore for they
[27:07] commit could not endure that which was
[27:10] commanded and if so much as a beast
[27:13] touched the mountain it shall be stoned
[27:15] or thrust through with a dart as so
[27:17] terrible was the the sight that Moses
[27:20] said I exceedingly fear and Quake and
[27:23] we'll get on that next time but what
[27:25] he's talking about is the story maybe
[27:26] you can read this as your homework read
[27:28] Exodus 19 and 20 because that is the
[27:31] story of of Israel when God wanted to
[27:34] have a relationship with them and they
[27:37] and they turned it down and said we
[27:38] won't we just want you to talk through
[27:40] Moses and we want a lot of stuff to do
[27:41] it's Devin having a instead of God
[27:44] showing his grace to us and it's having
[27:46] a relationship and that's what Paul is
[27:48] saying here now you now in the Old
[27:50] Testament they had that that they were
[27:52] looking at but now ye are not coming to
[27:55] that but you are come under the promise
[27:56] of the Living God and we'll stop on that
[27:58] God bless you
[28:00] all right
[28:02] [Applause]
