[19:23] for me
[19:24] i think i'm having a heart attack or
[19:26] something so i go in and
[19:28] the doctor asks a bunch of questions as
[19:30] they do and he starts squeezing and
[19:32] poking and pulling
[19:34] and he says i'll give you an ekg so it
[19:37] gives me an ekg and that checked okay
[19:39] and

[20:06] worried start going over the first time
[20:08] we go is look up what is an abdominal
[20:10] aneurysm
[20:12] and it's
[20:13] then he says well you could have this
[20:15] because of the treatments you had with
[20:16] osteomyelitis that it's weak in your
[20:18] blood vessels and they are so weak that
[20:20] they could just burst
[20:22] of course by then i'm about to wreck
[20:24] thinking myself what's going on
[20:27] and i kept telling
[20:28] the lord i said lord this is a lie of
[20:30] the devil and i'm not believing
[20:32] as soon as i started confessing that
[20:34] things started to turn around but we got
[20:36] over the ct scan

[41:26] father we thank you and we love you for
[41:28] your grace lord touch his wife lord
[41:30] brother dylan
[41:32] father meet that need father just having
[41:34] served you like myself but oh god you're
[41:36] a healer
[41:38] we've seen your power this morning lord
[41:41] man couldn't hardly speak yesterday
[41:43] fallen sick but oh god when jesus came
[41:48] no sickness can stand before you lord
[41:50] thank you for that transfusion of the
[41:52] blood lord
[41:54] father we thank you this afternoon that
[41:56] have your willing way for we ask you in
[41:58] jesus christ's name amen and amen
[42:02] you may receive it
[42:05] i'd like you to talk a little bit about
[42:07] this afternoon
[42:09] the value
[42:10] of the blood
[42:12] amen
[42:14] you realize that the blood
[42:16] is so valuable to us
[42:19] we look without the
[42:21] shedding of blood
[42:23] there is no remission of sin
[42:25] you know a lot of people say
[42:28] you know a lot of times they say that
[42:30] maybe
[42:31] you know we don't we don't need we've
[42:33] gone beyond the blood
[42:35] we don't need the blood but
[42:37] i'm here to tell you this afternoon
[42:39] it's so precious to us
[42:41] for without that blood there'd be no
[42:43] remission of sin
[42:45] and without that blood there'd be no
[42:47] life come back on the believer right for
[42:49] the blood didn't have any value then why
[42:51] wouldn't the
[42:52] blood of bulls and goats work
[42:55] that wouldn't all it did was just to
[42:57] cover it
[42:58] oh my when jesus came right
[43:01] when he came and gave that supreme
[43:03] sacrifice
[43:04] on calvary
[43:06] when he shed that precious blood
[43:09] he had a purpose in his life he come to
[43:12] shed that blood into his very life
[43:16] the very life would come right upon the
[43:18] believer
[43:20] that me and you
[43:22] once again could be reconciled back
[43:24] together with christ
[43:26] to thank that the prophet god said
[43:28] here's jesus and he took the hand of god
[43:31] and took the hand of man
[43:34] and put him back together
[43:36] that is how valuable it is to us this
[43:38] afternoon that's how wonderful that
[43:40] blood is to us i know that we've been
[43:42] saying the prophet said we went went
[43:44] beyond the blood but he was talking
[43:45] about the the lift that the lat the
[43:48] blood itself not that not the life or
[43:50] nothing to do with the blood but we're
[43:51] going to the whole going on into the
[43:53] holy ghost the life in the blood
[43:56] but
[43:57] we're so thankful for that shedding
[43:59] that shedding to think that he
[44:01] the king of kings
[44:04] the lord of lords would estimate me and
[44:06] you
[44:07] more valuable than his very own life
[44:10] i mean it's a paradox to think that the
[44:13] the king of glory would come down step
[44:16] into a human body and live the life of a
[44:19] man because in his heart in his desire
[44:23] he wanted to become kinsmen he wanted to
[44:25] be
[44:26] a redeemer he wanted to be a savior he
[44:29] wanted to be a healer he wanted to be
[44:31] all those attributes
[44:33] and the only way he could redeem mankind
[44:35] because of the fall in the garden is he
[44:37] had to come down and become near kinsmen
[44:40] amen he become brothers to us
[44:43] he become blessed brothers to us he
[44:45] becomes took on the blood of man the
[44:47] blood of god in a man come down into a
[44:50] human form
[44:51] and loved us so much that he would take
[44:54] all that the theme of leaving his glory
[44:57] to come down here to be spilled
[44:59] to have his beard plucked out to be malt
[45:02] to be made fun of
[45:04] and we we see that he was so
[45:06] so intact with his desires his will to
[45:10] please the father and fulfill the
[45:13] scriptures but it didn't stop him he
[45:16] didn't have no guile found in his mouth
[45:17] you could find nothing wrong with what
[45:20] he said how he conducted himself
[45:22] how he moved as a human being
[45:25] how he lived and he comes with such a
[45:27] great testimony to us right
[45:29] that he would show us that he's not
[45:31] by might amen not by power but it's by
[45:35] his spirit
[45:36] amen and we see with that spirit he
[45:39] showed us how we can take this word my
[45:41] brother and sister take this word and
[45:43] defeat the enemy any place
[45:46] anywhere
[45:47] anytime that's right
[45:50] he could tell he had the devil and this
[45:52] afternoon we have the devil's answer
[45:55] we have the answer
[45:57] to the devil when he tells us
[45:59] this and he uses scripture on us so many
[46:02] times but we have the ability to say
[46:05] satan
[46:06] it's also written more right it's also
[46:08] written man shall not live by bread
[46:11] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[46:13] out of the mouth of god
[46:15] i'm thankful this afternoon for that i'd
[46:18] like to look at just for a moment the
[46:19] estimation
[46:21] what do we estimate our savior at
[46:23] tonight what do we estimate this message
[46:26] at what value have we put on it what how
[46:29] much does it mean to us does it really
[46:32] mean as much to us as we say we do right
[46:35] is it more mean more to you than your
[46:38] very life
[46:39] your wife
[46:41] your brothers your sister your children
[46:43] your pastor
[46:45] is it that valuable to you
[46:48] oh it's more
[46:50] valuable to us than anything in this
[46:52] world
[46:53] for the true value that was placed was
[46:57] on the lost souls right jesus
[47:00] because everything else is going to pass
[47:02] away
[47:04] he become the word made flesh
[47:07] for he said heaven and earth will pass
[47:08] away but my word shall never pass away
[47:12] she said i want little little messiahs
[47:15] little word bodies of mine
[47:18] you know we don't realize how valuable
[47:20] we are to each other right
[47:22] for paul talks about when one member of
[47:24] the body suffers the whole body suffers
[47:27] you'd never think a big toe
[47:30] would humble somebody so much
[47:33] you don't understand how valuable that
[47:35] toe is
[47:37] how valuable you need that thing a lot
[47:39] of times we'll say well you know this
[47:40] brother's weak and he went off and he
[47:42] done these things
[47:43] he's backslidden
[47:45] he couldn't you know a lot of times
[47:46] they'll say well he went out from us
[47:47] because he was not elvis but we have to
[47:49] be careful right maybe it's just
[47:51] overtaking it a fault right you know a
[47:54] lot of times we don't value our brothers
[47:56] and sisters it's a value we should value
[47:58] right our lord valued
[48:00] us
[48:01] and more valuable than our very own life
[48:03] right
[48:05] when we realize when one part of the
[48:07] body suffers the whole body pays for it
[48:09] right when my toe begins to start giving
[48:11] me so much trouble i never realized that
[48:13] my toe could affect my whole body
[48:16] but once it got infected right it
[48:18] started affecting the bloodstream you
[48:20] know when there's an infection in the
[48:22] church and it gets in the bloodstream
[48:25] it affects every member of the church
[48:28] shut it let one part of the body start
[48:31] to have infection in it
[48:33] and see where the whole body responds to
[48:35] it
[48:36] you don't think right
[48:38] you don't have right pain changes people
[48:42] suffering changes people
[48:44] either it builds character in us
[48:47] oh yeah oh it shows what we really made
[48:50] pressure shows what we have
[48:53] let's look at this word estimation for
[48:55] just for a few moments the estimation is
[48:58] to form or to give an approximate
[49:00] opinion or calculation
[49:03] in his mind
[49:05] the great
[49:06] mighty god
[49:08] thought of me in you
[49:10] as he hung on that cross he knew there
[49:11] was no way back
[49:13] for man ever to come back and to be in
[49:16] full fellowship with god again right
[49:19] that's why they went into a place he had
[49:20] to prepare for him before the blood was
[49:22] called paradise
[49:26] and even the witch of endor
[49:28] could communicate with him
[49:30] still through man or through a gift
[49:33] could it be communicated with right but
[49:36] we see that when the blood come
[49:38] there's no more communication
[49:40] for the unbeliever to communicate with
[49:43] the believer
[49:44] i'm so thankful that he separated me and
[49:47] you from that place right he gave it an
[49:50] approximate opinion of me and you
[49:53] even though he was dead in sins and
[49:55] trespasses this bad shape is or some of
[49:58] us might have been in
[49:59] he valued you more than his own life
[50:02] when he walked down that crawl when he
[50:04] walked down walked down that hill del
[50:06] gotham
[50:08] i like what a buddy of mine sings you
[50:09] know he said he traveled the last mile
[50:13] on his knees
[50:15] you know what's wrong with us brothers
[50:16] and sisters we ain't traveled long
[50:18] enough on our knees
[50:22] god give me this trick the cow this last
[50:25] mile of the journey on my knees
[50:29] turn my cross
[50:32] carry my cross up the hill to down right
[50:36] you know that's what we need we need to
[50:37] kill him
[50:43] even through all the pain and the
[50:44] suffering and the agony that he went
[50:47] through amen it never stopped him
[50:50] he cried so much for me and you in the
[50:52] garden of gethsemane that his own tears
[50:55] became blood right
[50:57] his sweat became blood you talk about
[51:00] agonizing for his children
[51:02] what about me and you when our brothers
[51:04] and sisters have need
[51:06] we'll never maybe get to that place to
[51:08] do those things but we can we can sign
[51:10] and cry
[51:11] what about he said he's sending an angel
[51:13] to mark those who sigh and cry for the
[51:16] abominations done in this city what
[51:18] about your neighbor that you live aside
[51:20] and he's in trouble and he needs help
[51:23] you know what we're writing there'll be
[51:24] a time attempt that we'll pray for and
[51:26] they'll get rain
[51:29] where's the mercy see that right send
[51:32] the bride amen
[51:34] i'm glad he lives on the heart of man
[51:40] it's a primary opinion or statement
[51:43] of an approximate
[51:45] cost
[51:46] for a certain thing
[51:48] i can i cannot even ima i can't even
[51:51] comprehend
[51:52] in the natural mind
[51:54] the value that he placed on me in you
[51:56] yeah the value that the king of heaven
[51:59] would place that kind of value on me and
[52:01] you
[52:02] never love me and you more than anything
[52:05] even his very own life
[52:09] we look at romans
[52:11] 3
[52:13] verse 23-26 he says for all have sinned
[52:17] and come short of the glory of god
[52:19] being freely justified by his grace
[52:23] through the redemption that is in christ
[52:24] jesus
[52:26] whom god has set to be a propitiation
[52:29] through faith in his blood
[52:32] to declare his righteousness for the
[52:35] remission of sins that are passed
[52:38] through the forbearance of god to
[52:40] declare i say at this time his
[52:43] righteousness
[52:44] that he might be just and a justifier of
[52:48] him which believeth in jesus
[52:52] oh my i'm so thankful that he even gave
[52:54] us the faith
[52:56] to believe in him right you could go out
[52:58] and ask anybody do you believe in god
[53:01] they'd say yes problem you could ask a
[53:03] drunkard do you believe in god do you
[53:05] believe jesus christ yes i do
[53:08] but it's a different kind right i
[53:10] believe
[53:11] it's the faith of god believing in god's
[53:13] word
[53:15] he give us this faith right and then
[53:18] he's going to reward me and you
[53:20] for accepting it it's a paradox brother
[53:22] dale the thing that he'll give you he
[53:24] has given us these things he's going to
[53:27] reward him just because we accepted him
[53:30] and we believed him
[53:32] you didn't have to work for it
[53:34] you didn't have to slave what you had to
[53:36] put in so many hours
[53:37] you didn't have to do anything you
[53:39] freely give
[53:41] he said free life give unto you
[53:43] freely you give unto others
[53:46] you know it's already the cost has
[53:48] already been paid for
[53:51] i like what paul said in hebrews 9 14
[53:54] through 22. he said how much more shall
[53:57] the blood of christ who through the
[53:58] eternal spirit offered himself without
[54:01] spot to god
[54:02] you know i had a pastor in this message
[54:04] tell me one time brother there
[54:06] he said that
[54:07] jesus
[54:08] was not the perfect sacrifice
[54:13] and then i began to wonder
[54:15] if he really was
[54:16] in this message
[54:18] because if he wasn't that perfect
[54:20] sacrifice
[54:23] then we're all right amen
[54:26] because he had to be accepted right well
[54:28] there was no acceptance of god for me in
[54:30] you
[54:32] and you know you begin to wonder those
[54:33] things
[54:34] it's just the way people you know it's
[54:36] not it's a spirit's all it is it's not
[54:39] the man it's not the person and i said
[54:41] thank you lord for letting me see that
[54:43] glory
[54:45] he said how much more shall the blood
[54:47] of christ who threw the eternal spirit
[54:49] over himself without spot to god
[54:53] purge your conscience
[54:56] we needed it
[54:57] because look at when the blood of bulls
[54:59] and goats
[55:00] was applied they went right back out and
[55:02] done the same old scene
[55:04] every year they come back and offered it
[55:06] for the same things they was doing
[55:09] but this flight
[55:11] this power this spirit that come back
[55:15] has purged us
[55:17] purged our conscience from dead works to
[55:19] serve a living god amen right when we
[55:22] was out in the world we served
[55:24] everything
[55:25] we served sports stars we made islands
[55:28] out of them we served this we served
[55:30] that brother said we was nothing but a
[55:33] bunch of healers we walked around with a
[55:35] club on our back right we worshiped
[55:37] everything
[55:38] i like what the great apostle paul said
[55:41] when he was over there he walked up
[55:42] seeing that inscription
[55:44] to the unknown god amen boy you talk
[55:47] about revelation he said let me tell you
[55:50] who he is
[55:51] i'm glad that it takes revelation to be
[55:54] able to say those things and to be able
[55:55] to witness to people about who god
[55:57] really is that's right
[55:59] they still brushing him up in three
[56:01] pieces the denominational world even
[56:04] when he get down to the jesus only still
[56:06] got him in a box right they don't
[56:08] understand that he he is omnipotent
[56:11] omnipresent he is everywhere
[56:16] but we see
[56:17] that it comes through revelation he said
[56:20] and for this cause he is the mediator
[56:23] of the new testament right meaning you
[56:25] needed a mediator
[56:27] we needed somebody to stand in mine in
[56:29] your corner
[56:30] we needed an attorney right
[56:33] we was guilty
[56:35] we deserved hell
[56:37] but this great mediator
[56:39] of the new testament by the means of
[56:42] death
[56:43] for the redemption of transgressions
[56:46] that were under the first testament they
[56:49] which are called might receive the
[56:51] promise of eternal inheritance
[56:54] for where a testament is there are also
[56:57] a necessity be the death of the testator
[57:00] amen
[57:01] the death that blows him
[57:03] and goats wouldn't do it brother aaron
[57:05] right right
[57:06] he said for the for a testament is a
[57:09] force
[57:10] after men are dead
[57:12] otherwise it is
[57:14] it is of no strength at all
[57:16] while the testator lived
[57:19] he had
[57:21] to die
[57:22] he had
[57:24] to show
[57:25] us that he was willing to give his life
[57:28] right
[57:30] oh
[57:31] you we can't help but love him look at
[57:33] the price he has paid for us
[57:36] he says
[57:38] for the testament
[57:40] for testament is a force
[57:42] after the men are dead otherwise it is
[57:45] no strength at all while the testator
[57:47] lived whereupon neither the first
[57:50] testament was decided was dedicated
[57:53] without blood for when moses had spoken
[57:56] every precept to all the people
[57:58] according to the law he took
[58:02] he took the blood of calves and of goats
[58:04] with water and scarlet wool and hiss
[58:07] and sprinkled both the book
[58:09] and all the people saying this is the
[58:11] blood
[58:12] of the testament which god has enjoyed
[58:14] unto you
[58:16] moreover he sprinkled with blood both
[58:18] the tabernacle and all the vessels of
[58:20] the ministry and almost all things
[58:24] are by the law of purge with blood and
[58:27] without shedding of blood he's no
[58:29] remission right
[58:31] i am so thankful
[58:34] for that
[58:35] that he was willing to pray the supreme
[58:37] price for me and you
[58:39] right you know when i first heard the
[58:41] prophet said that there was a more near
[58:44] kismet redeemer than god
[58:46] it kind of being a young christian i'm
[58:48] like
[58:49] wow how could that be from god created
[58:52] all things and by here all things were
[58:54] created for him right
[58:56] but he said because of the fall in the
[58:58] garden right there was one called
[59:00] lucifer
[59:02] and he was afraid
[59:04] that me and you
[59:06] would mar
[59:07] just testimony oh yeah well i'm glad he
[59:09] refused to redeem me under his covenant
[59:13] right because we didn't all belong to
[59:15] covenant of death hell in the grave
[59:18] right
[59:19] but there was one
[59:20] that said ah
[59:22] i'll take it right i'll take it since
[59:24] you don't want it lucifer i'll come down
[59:27] right
[59:28] i'll give my life
[59:30] i'll take on the kids will redeem me
[59:33] i'll take it i like what the apostle
[59:35] john wrote in john chapter 1 verse 17 he
[59:38] says any of his fullness
[59:40] have already received
[59:42] grace
[59:43] for grace brother said in this age we
[59:46] have received
[59:47] double grace right
[59:49] oh my brothers and sisters what a
[59:52] magnificent thing to see that god has
[59:55] sent in the most wicked the most
[59:57] adulterous age of all he has sent me in
[1:00:00] you double grace
[1:00:03] we see that in corinthians first term
[1:00:05] went to the book of the corinthians
[1:00:07] first corinthians six
[1:00:08] read two little scriptures here 19 and
[1:00:11] 20.
[1:00:12] amen you still love the lord amen amen
[1:00:15] we can't help but love him
[1:00:18] it says verse 19 and what
[1:00:21] know you not that your body
[1:00:23] is the temple of the holy ghost which is
[1:00:25] in you
[1:00:26] what you have of god
[1:00:28] and you are not your home
[1:00:30] you know what's wrong with a lot of us
[1:00:32] we still have our own will
[1:00:33] we have our own desire we still have our
[1:00:36] own want to know
[1:00:38] he said for ye are bought with a price
[1:00:42] therefore glorify god right in your body
[1:00:46] and in your spirit which are gods
[1:00:49] you see here the apostle paul is showing
[1:00:51] us that we have been bought with a price
[1:00:55] it's a double declaration to the
[1:00:57] believer we have been brought through
[1:01:00] redemption and then reconciled
[1:01:02] reconciliation back to god
[1:01:05] but to become one with god look at jesus
[1:01:07] he said my greatest desire father as as
[1:01:11] me and you are one
[1:01:13] that father they'll be one right oh my
[1:01:16] not one like this but one with god amen
[1:01:20] god living in us
[1:01:22] we see that redemption
[1:01:24] has a greater source of obligation than
[1:01:27] creation or preservation
[1:01:30] redemption
[1:01:31] of this man the man that he created he
[1:01:34] said and he breathed the breath of life
[1:01:37] into the breath of adam but his
[1:01:39] obligation let's look at that obligation
[1:01:42] look at when the angels fell god never
[1:01:44] moved
[1:01:45] but when man failed god came to him amen
[1:01:49] oh come down to see where fallen man was
[1:01:54] where the fallen woman was
[1:01:56] god himself came down right
[1:01:59] adam
[1:02:01] where are you son
[1:02:03] i'm so thankful that that's his love for
[1:02:06] his creation he let the one well
[1:02:08] one-third of the angels fall off lucifer
[1:02:11] and all them
[1:02:12] but when man fell right our lord
[1:02:16] loved us so much
[1:02:18] that god himself come down
[1:02:21] look at you where are you
[1:02:23] i'm glad he gave me that call one day
[1:02:26] when i was out there in the wilderness
[1:02:28] of sin
[1:02:29] out there in god out there in satan's
[1:02:31] pigpen
[1:02:32] eating the swine huss is a prodigal son
[1:02:36] he came one day and said yeah
[1:02:38] richie
[1:02:39] where are you
[1:02:42] me lord
[1:02:43] why do you want me lord
[1:02:45] that's the first thing we ask you
[1:02:47] lord what do you want with me
[1:02:50] why do you want me
[1:02:52] i'm worthless i'm wretched i'm no good
[1:02:56] there ain't no hope for me
[1:02:59] he said but oh yes they are yeah
[1:03:04] all right you know what i'm even saying
[1:03:06] many times those are the people that's
[1:03:07] been raised in the message and they went
[1:03:09] off
[1:03:10] but you know what the satan played with
[1:03:12] my mind for all them years brother donny
[1:03:14] he played with my mind he said you went
[1:03:15] too far
[1:03:16] yeah you crossed the line
[1:03:18] your predestination see
[1:03:20] you cannot cross the line right because
[1:03:22] god wanted paul said in ignorance
[1:03:25] i even blessed me right the holy ghost
[1:03:29] talking about redemption that's the only
[1:03:31] sin unpardonable that's right but look
[1:03:33] where grace was right grace come to him
[1:03:36] knowing it was in ignorance
[1:03:38] calling the condition he was right right
[1:03:41] so we have to be careful
[1:03:42] what would you say about one another
[1:03:44] right you know they used to tell my
[1:03:46] mother said well you know
[1:03:47] you serpent seed you know
[1:03:49] you know if you can't
[1:03:51] you know your son you know raise this
[1:03:53] mess you went off you know how hard they
[1:03:54] used to be bro yeah no hope for us
[1:03:57] you know what i believe that brother
[1:03:59] i believe
[1:04:00] this man this flesh man believes
[1:04:01] something on the inside wouldn't let me
[1:04:03] swallow it he wouldn't do it
[1:04:05] but i believe
[1:04:06] i said yeah maybe i did
[1:04:08] satan said yes you did
[1:04:10] you know i held that carry that rock in
[1:04:12] my sack all in years
[1:04:14] until jesus came you know i told him i
[1:04:16] said lord i went too far
[1:04:18] i went too far he said your problem son
[1:04:20] you never went far enough
[1:04:22] you never did get bored again
[1:04:32] i'm glad he he made a one-on-one
[1:04:34] visitation to me
[1:04:36] i'm glad he loved me that much that he
[1:04:37] would come down and speak to me all
[1:04:39] right
[1:04:40] i like what brother brown said in the
[1:04:41] results of a decision that jeff and uh
[1:04:44] chicago illinois 1955. he said not long
[1:04:48] ago i was standing
[1:04:49] by a big museum we've heard this many
[1:04:51] times
[1:04:52] he said it had the estimation of the
[1:04:54] human body
[1:04:56] a man that weighed about a hundred and
[1:04:58] fifty pounds was worth
[1:05:00] 84 cents in chemicals
[1:05:03] he kind of he said last year
[1:05:06] he said put a ten dollar hat
[1:05:09] on at 84 cents boy i'm telling you
[1:05:13] he said put a
[1:05:14] 500 mink coat
[1:05:16] around 84 cents and stick your nose up
[1:05:19] if it rained it drown you he said then
[1:05:22] you think you're somebody
[1:05:24] and worth 84 cents
[1:05:27] he said you sure take care of that
[1:05:30] but brother you've got a soul
[1:05:33] that'll never die
[1:05:35] somewhere you'll take any old kind of
[1:05:38] dogmatic stuff
[1:05:39] for that swallow it
[1:05:41] down i like where he said even he tells
[1:05:43] somebody said you're going to a
[1:05:44] restaurant if we went to the cracker
[1:05:46] barrel last night and there was a spider
[1:05:48] in my in my crawling around in my
[1:05:52] roast beef and gravy
[1:05:53] i've been mad
[1:05:55] but he said and you'd want to serve but
[1:05:58] he said you take any old thing yeah and
[1:06:00] swallow it down whatever we watch just
[1:06:01] any old thing we listen to just any old
[1:06:03] thing
[1:06:04] we do just any old thing
[1:06:06] be careful what you feed you're so less
[1:06:07] than right right the white and the black
[1:06:09] dog live
[1:06:12] do you think you can't resurrect that
[1:06:13] black dog
[1:06:15] oh yeah
[1:06:16] he loves to eat you see but the only one
[1:06:19] way you can control him is you have to
[1:06:21] starve him right
[1:06:22] if you feed him and then you wonder why
[1:06:24] he raises up so much you've been feeding
[1:06:26] him some good nutritions the world
[1:06:29] you've been giving him the taste that he
[1:06:30] likes you know what that's even the
[1:06:33] world don't understand it when the
[1:06:34] prophet god preached a message called
[1:06:36] the thinking man's filter
[1:06:39] has a holy man's taste you know what
[1:06:41] people a lot of people around we don't
[1:06:42] understand but they can be a religious
[1:06:44] filter
[1:06:45] i'm gonna preach on that sometimes a
[1:06:47] religious film you know religious filler
[1:06:49] he can take any old thing he can take
[1:06:51] all these old he can take all his old
[1:06:53] contemporary a lot of contemporary music
[1:06:55] he'll take a lot of these other things
[1:06:57] and he can suck it right through there
[1:06:59] and you know what he gets a religious
[1:07:00] man's taste
[1:07:02] he jumps he rejoices but you know what i
[1:07:04] thought about taking temporary music we
[1:07:06] have to be very careful about that music
[1:07:08] because i come out of the world yeah i
[1:07:10] used to listen to all that rock and roll
[1:07:12] and boogie woogie
[1:07:13] just because they say certain things
[1:07:15] don't mean it's christian
[1:07:18] but he said many will cry lord lord in
[1:07:20] that day and won't enter in i've often
[1:07:23] wondered
[1:07:24] about this and
[1:07:25] you know when they've probably seen that
[1:07:27] preview of america's bride she was being
[1:07:29] led by a witch to the beat of rock and
[1:07:31] roll i wonder if it was contemporary
[1:07:33] gospel music
[1:07:35] because she was religious
[1:07:36] but she had no covering she was naked
[1:07:39] that's a religious man's filter right
[1:07:42] you know what i've never seen so many
[1:07:43] brothers there's so many people that say
[1:07:45] they're christians look at the
[1:07:46] homosexuals that make such a great move
[1:07:49] into christianity
[1:07:51] and saying you know we're all one yeah
[1:07:54] well that sounds like that sounds like
[1:07:55] the tower of babel
[1:07:58] they're doing a lot of foolish battling
[1:08:01] you know because not all of us
[1:08:04] are christians
[1:08:05] only those who are about by the blood of
[1:08:08] jesus christ and i believe the
[1:08:09] homosexual can be saved amen but he
[1:08:11] still won't do the same thing he still
[1:08:13] won't deal with john
[1:08:16] right you know what one of the biggest
[1:08:18] moves in contemporary one of the biggest
[1:08:19] ones i heard him say this i'm gonna say
[1:08:21] i'm gonna drop this
[1:08:22] i'm gonna drop this was ray boltz
[1:08:25] powerful
[1:08:27] contemporary
[1:08:28] singer from that pledge allegiance to
[1:08:30] the lamb
[1:08:32] the anchor hose but you know what he
[1:08:35] came out and said he said i am a
[1:08:36] homosexual
[1:08:39] and i believe i'm closer to god now than
[1:08:41] i've ever been
[1:08:43] you better be careful but we are here
[1:08:45] right you better be careful the bible
[1:08:47] tells me to try every spirit
[1:08:52] you know what some people say i want you
[1:08:54] to listen to songs so religious i mean
[1:08:56] it's so
[1:08:57] so beautiful and you get to listen to
[1:08:59] that thing and you pull it through that
[1:09:00] thank you mess filter and you know what
[1:09:01] it won't go
[1:09:03] you're good
[1:09:04] it's like having a piece of it you ever
[1:09:06] been drinking your tea and sucked up one
[1:09:07] of those uh lemon seeds in there
[1:09:10] that's the same way it is with god's
[1:09:12] filter right when you go to sucking on
[1:09:14] that thing he'll stop it up
[1:09:16] see the holy man's the holy man's
[1:09:17] children won't allow to go through that
[1:09:20] you don't get no more teeth until you
[1:09:21] get to until you get the seed out of the
[1:09:23] straw
[1:09:25] so what we need is we need a filter
[1:09:27] cleaning
[1:09:28] we need the holy ghost to clean out our
[1:09:30] filter
[1:09:31] so we can draw off the things of god
[1:09:34] right right
[1:09:36] i like what hebrews 7 7 says and without
[1:09:39] contradiction
[1:09:41] the less
[1:09:42] is blessed
[1:09:43] of the better
[1:09:45] me and you being the less has been
[1:09:47] blessed as the better of jesus christ
[1:09:49] i'm so thankful for that so thankful
[1:09:52] that he loved me in you so much that he
[1:09:54] give his life for me and you
[1:09:57] see when you have a blood transfusion
[1:09:59] you don't have all that confusion right
[1:10:02] because when you get that holy spirit
[1:10:04] he said he'd lead you and guide you into
[1:10:06] all truth right you know what when
[1:10:08] there's something said and it ain't
[1:10:09] quite right
[1:10:10] it's a little red light goes off you're
[1:10:12] right i've heard people say something i
[1:10:14] mean they'd be good yeah and it wasn't
[1:10:16] right right wasn't right i said oh that
[1:10:19] rob brown said they said that man had
[1:10:20] that dream he said
[1:10:22] it's a good dream
[1:10:24] but it ain't according to the word
[1:10:26] it won't go through the thinking man's
[1:10:28] filter
[1:10:31] so we have to try and see
[1:10:33] well it's all gone amen then we try to
[1:10:35] bring it through here and then what if
[1:10:37] it don't light up
[1:10:39] it ain't no good right i'm thankful for
[1:10:41] that i'm thankful that we got our own
[1:10:44] little light that lights up on the
[1:10:46] inside and tells us
[1:10:47] right tells us what we are you know
[1:10:50] without that blood
[1:10:51] we have no blood type
[1:10:54] you know what we're all humans
[1:10:56] but i said every one of those cattles
[1:10:58] was cows
[1:11:00] every one of them
[1:11:01] but he said he wasn't looking at even
[1:11:03] the brand on them that's right
[1:11:05] the brand they all had different brands
[1:11:07] on them all right you want to say well
[1:11:09] this one right here is from lula and
[1:11:11] this one's right here so
[1:11:12] gastonia this one here is from tennessee
[1:11:15] this one here is from kentucky he went
[1:11:18] looking at that right
[1:11:20] he was looking for a black tank all
[1:11:22] right
[1:11:23] now that you was
[1:11:25] born of his bone
[1:11:26] flesh of his flesh
[1:11:28] life of his life blood of his blood
[1:11:31] spirit of your spirit
[1:11:32] i'm glad we have a tag
[1:11:34] i'm glad we've not been bored through
[1:11:36] our ears
[1:11:38] they all had something but they we all
[1:11:41] had to have that we all have to have the
[1:11:43] dna of god right we all come from
[1:11:45] different races different cultures
[1:11:47] different ways of life
[1:11:48] but we're all born progressing the holy
[1:11:50] ghost all right no different right i'm
[1:11:52] thankful for that when the holy ghost
[1:11:54] comes here we all right
[1:11:57] we all like like our daddy
[1:12:00] i'm glad we're bored of god
[1:12:02] you see somebody ain't acting right
[1:12:05] they hadn't been born again or they
[1:12:06] hadn't mercy or they've got a spirit on
[1:12:09] because daddy
[1:12:10] don't misconduct himself
[1:12:13] our father knew how to conduct himself
[1:12:15] as we spoke this morning he knew he had
[1:12:18] the right behavior
[1:12:19] he he conducted himself just like the
[1:12:22] father
[1:12:23] he was so much like him i like what
[1:12:25] t.l.r said the prophet to god one time
[1:12:27] they got him you might have heard this
[1:12:29] brother they got him over there and they
[1:12:30] wanted him to say something against the
[1:12:32] prophet of god you know he's in the
[1:12:33] first assemblies and all those still out
[1:12:34] there i don't understand why i ain't
[1:12:36] come out of that
[1:12:37] i don't understand that that's between
[1:12:38] him and god and i'm not calling names or
[1:12:40] be little people but uh they got over
[1:12:42] there he was in africa because you know
[1:12:44] the message has just boomed over there
[1:12:47] well not longer they called him over
[1:12:48] there and they want him to because he'd
[1:12:49] been with the prophet they wanted him to
[1:12:51] say something about it tell me this is
[1:12:52] all frozen this can't be of god
[1:12:55] but i like what he did he got up and he
[1:12:57] said him and hit him in the pool but
[1:12:58] they said kill we want you to kill it
[1:13:01] count it on him show him surely this is
[1:13:03] a fanatical move this is all wrong
[1:13:07] but i like what he's saying
[1:13:10] he said he said tell him he's a false
[1:13:12] prophet but he got up early said
[1:13:15] you know
[1:13:16] so there's one thing i can say
[1:13:19] if there was a prophet
[1:13:20] hey for this age it was william
[1:13:24] amen thank god for him understanding and
[1:13:26] then we
[1:13:28] we're afraid to say we think about this
[1:13:30] message here's a man that ain't even in
[1:13:32] this message that has enough love of god
[1:13:35] to stand there and tell what's truth
[1:13:37] right for that no matter what he what
[1:13:39] he's done or whatever however he
[1:13:41] believes but he stood and told the truth
[1:13:43] honesty always counts and you know what
[1:13:46] they said well you know tal said well
[1:13:48] they baptize him his name and they do
[1:13:49] all these things
[1:13:51] he said well let me tell you something
[1:13:52] about william man brett
[1:13:55] he said you know it's like an old
[1:13:56] blacksmith
[1:13:58] he said when he put that piece of iron
[1:13:59] in that fire and he got that hot fire so
[1:14:02] hot he said that iron
[1:14:04] and that fire become one he said you
[1:14:07] couldn't tell the iron from the fire he
[1:14:09] said that's the way the william branham
[1:14:11] was he said he lived so close to god
[1:14:13] that people mistake him for god
[1:14:16] i want to ask us this afternoon has
[1:14:18] anybody been stick mistaking me and you
[1:14:21] i don't want to go
[1:14:22] we got to come to that place my brothers
[1:14:24] and sisters i got to come to that place
[1:14:26] that's the greatest testimony he could
[1:14:27] ever say about the prophet he lived so
[1:14:30] close to him right until he become one
[1:14:32] with the father glory and people
[1:14:36] he mistaken him for god
[1:14:39] not that we worship the prophet by no
[1:14:40] means we worship the same god i serve
[1:14:44] the god of elijah that's right
[1:14:46] and he works with him in spirit and
[1:14:48] truth right he
[1:14:49] he was lived such a life
[1:14:51] and he lived so close to god that he
[1:14:53] manifest that he manifested the fruits
[1:14:56] yeah that's what we need to do we need
[1:14:57] to start manifesting some fruits
[1:14:59] we've been in the garden a long time but
[1:15:01] we need a lot of pruning yeah we need
[1:15:03] putting off the flowers to bring forth
[1:15:05] to bring forth the fruit
[1:15:07] we're producing a lot of leaves
[1:15:10] we ain't producing a lot of fruit
[1:15:12] oh i'm glad the master of the vineyard
[1:15:15] sent somebody to come and come to the
[1:15:17] grave
[1:15:18] let's look at what jesus said here in
[1:15:20] matthew 10 verse 29-31 he says and not
[1:15:24] to spare us so for our father
[1:15:27] and one of them shall not fall on the
[1:15:30] ground without your father
[1:15:33] he said
[1:15:34] but the very hairs
[1:15:36] of your head are numbered so i hadn't
[1:15:38] lost one
[1:15:39] they're all coming back
[1:15:43] he said fear ye not therefore
[1:15:46] ye are more
[1:15:48] they uh of more value
[1:15:51] than many spirits
[1:15:53] he didn't die
[1:15:55] for creation right he died for man
[1:15:58] right he died he caught he
[1:16:01] he got creation in the in the price he
[1:16:04] paid right he come and shed his blood on
[1:16:06] the ground and redemp and redeemed
[1:16:08] that but he come that that life in that
[1:16:10] blood might come on me and you amen see
[1:16:13] they don't have a soul come on but me
[1:16:15] and you do right so your soul is worth
[1:16:18] more than ten thousand worlds right and
[1:16:22] i like what the prophet said in one
[1:16:23] place my pastor said he seen one place
[1:16:25] where he said 10 million worlds yeah
[1:16:28] so what value where do we place our
[1:16:29] value look at moses just for a minute
[1:16:32] now moses could have been the greatest
[1:16:34] man in egypt and he was he was fixing to
[1:16:36] be the pharaoh right and if he wouldn't
[1:16:38] have done what he did he wouldn't took
[1:16:40] his choice right now i wonder a lot of
[1:16:42] times what choice would we make right
[1:16:44] yeah when it come even preachers i
[1:16:45] wonder what choice will you come saul
[1:16:47] had a choice too
[1:16:49] king saul
[1:16:51] but the people was
[1:16:53] we want that come on let us keep these
[1:16:55] calves let us keep these guns you know
[1:16:58] what i thank god for a man is not not
[1:17:01] afraid to tell the truth
[1:17:03] that's the difference between a higher
[1:17:04] level right
[1:17:05] and one that god has called right right
[1:17:08] it's not about
[1:17:09] big
[1:17:10] who who's got the most
[1:17:12] it's about genuine robin said
[1:17:15] hey god ain't into all that glitter and
[1:17:18] shine
[1:17:19] he's into the glowing i'm looking for
[1:17:21] character that's what god's looking for
[1:17:24] the character of christ when he come for
[1:17:26] a wife when he talked about the man he
[1:17:28] was coming looking for the wife
[1:17:30] he's looking for character
[1:17:32] you know old lady little girl she went
[1:17:33] out there and she watches this she
[1:17:34] didn't complain her cousins made fun of

[1:21:37] god just let's you know when he comes
[1:21:39] brother
[1:21:40] oh he comes out such a sweet loving
[1:21:42] spirit
[1:21:44] and he said
[1:21:46] take her over there
[1:21:47] through the qualifications right i'm a
[1:21:49] deacon
[1:21:52] you know
[1:21:52] i'm hidden
[1:21:54] he said she must he must be
[1:21:57] the husband
[1:21:58] of one wife amen
[1:22:03] i said besides where is the word
[1:22:05] dickiness
[1:22:06] in the bible
[1:22:08] so he bailed me out of that i thought
[1:22:11] hold on
[1:22:12] she said well wait a minute i want to
[1:22:13] know about the woman preacher
[1:22:16] i knew it was coming i knew i could i
[1:22:18] could tell the tension was built
[1:22:20] and i said well
[1:22:22] show me one place in the bible
[1:22:24] where there was a priest that handled
[1:22:26] the fire the word of god that was a
[1:22:28] woman right
[1:22:30] she said
[1:22:31] i could hear you know that religious
[1:22:33] demons
[1:22:34] said that's a powerful deal that's a
[1:22:36] powerful name or being preaching on the
[1:22:38] radio i've run into a lot of those
[1:22:40] powerful demons you'll get more response
[1:22:42] to have a raw center than you will the
[1:22:44] religious people
[1:22:45] they'll stone you they'll pick up stones
[1:22:47] and they'll stone like they said they
[1:22:48] pull them out of their bag their bag's
[1:22:50] empty because they've used them
[1:22:57] careful that our bag's not empty
[1:23:02] she said
[1:23:03] well so i took it over the table god
[1:23:05] said turn over to timothy i said oh my
[1:23:07] okay lord
[1:23:09] with that spirit was in that sweet
[1:23:11] spirit and then when he comes in he
[1:23:13] there that's right i mean
[1:23:16] you know a lot of us get more let me
[1:23:17] tell you
[1:23:18] you're wrong we're going to hell
[1:23:21] in that way right it's just a sweet
[1:23:24] homeless spirit
[1:23:26] i said well let's look over in timothy
[1:23:28] let's look over there this wasn't me i
[1:23:30] couldn't do those things he's bringing
[1:23:31] them back to me brother whenever i show
[1:23:33] your word you know worship not a woman
[1:23:35] to teach have authority over the man but
[1:23:37] to be
[1:23:38] silent
[1:23:39] in church that's all she can stood
[1:23:42] that's obviously just good to stand
[1:23:44] well that see i said show me one apostle
[1:23:49] yeah i mean i'm still young but
[1:23:51] he showed me this thing
[1:23:53] and boy i could feel her growling
[1:23:55] i could hear her breath on the other
[1:23:56] hand

[1:24:16] different thing i said that if i have
[1:24:18] offended you forgive me i said but if
[1:24:20] you're offended by the word
[1:24:22] you know and she said here give the
[1:24:24] other you're talking that man he ain't
[1:24:25] nothing but a male show this pig
[1:24:27] now he can't wait to get on the phone he
[1:24:28] said he said but you know what brother i
[1:24:31] said but
[1:24:32] he said that's the way our pastor you
[1:24:34] know a lot of times that's what we say
[1:24:36] around the message that's the way our
[1:24:38] pastor teaches it oh my god sees
[1:24:40] anything but a word
[1:24:45] i said well it's like this you know god
[1:24:47] gives you wisdom i said it's like this i
[1:24:48] said now if a man told you
[1:24:50] to walk and he said now buddy you can
[1:24:53] fly
[1:24:54] now this is how simple god just made me
[1:24:56] a simple man
[1:24:57] i'm glad he did
[1:24:59] he said if a man tells you you can jump
[1:25:00] off that empire state building you can
[1:25:02] fly
[1:25:03] i said would you get up on top of that
[1:25:05] empire state building and jump off
[1:25:06] because he told you you could fly he
[1:25:08] said no way i said that's the same thing
[1:25:09] you're doing now right you ain't in the
[1:25:11] word you are committing spiritual
[1:25:14] suicide right
[1:25:16] i got the phone
[1:25:17] hung up the phone and grief come on me
[1:25:19] brother and i began to pray for him i
[1:25:21] said god
[1:25:22] forgive them that's right for they don't
[1:25:24] know
[1:25:26] because i didn't want to lay that charge
[1:25:27] too right hoping that god would save
[1:25:29] their soul right see you don't
[1:25:31] understand the holy spirit that wouldn't
[1:25:32] mean i couldn't do that a lot of times
[1:25:34] in this collection they said that boy i
[1:25:35] want to show them yeah boy let me show
[1:25:37] you you know this man wants to be he
[1:25:39] wants to be he wants to take credit
[1:25:41] if he ain't got the holy ghost that man
[1:25:43] wants to make himself known
[1:25:45] he wants to prove something i like what
[1:25:47] my pastor told me one time he said
[1:25:49] brother richard brother richard he said
[1:25:51] one thing about he said well god gives a
[1:25:53] man revelation
[1:25:55] it humbles you
[1:25:57] he said but when man gets revelation
[1:26:00] it exalts you right exactly so that's
[1:26:02] how you can tell if god give it to him
[1:26:04] by another man the way he conducts
[1:26:06] himself and he says those things
[1:26:09] and you know
[1:26:11] i just thank god that he gives us this
[1:26:13] ability the value you know you could we
[1:26:15] can we have to be careful this message
[1:26:17] because this message is like an atomic
[1:26:18] bomb
[1:26:20] we got to we got a bomb that's right
[1:26:23] this is that and we have to be careful
[1:26:24] who we use them right right we've got to
[1:26:26] be careful when we drop that bomb right
[1:26:28] we can destroy people's lives amen and
[1:26:30] they can seal their destinations by
[1:26:32] their words exactly right
[1:26:34] we have to be very careful we have to be
[1:26:35] led the spirit yes
[1:26:37] you know but they still kept calling
[1:26:38] they'd call me said when you pray for me
[1:26:40] and we pray for you to sit i thought
[1:26:42] praise god
[1:26:43] thank god
[1:26:44] just moved it over lord if i'd have done
[1:26:46] it myself i'd mess it up we
[1:26:48] always
[1:26:50] the lord does me brother sometimes you
[1:26:51] know you want to tell somebody
[1:26:53] and then when you tell when i can tell
[1:26:55] when it ain't when it ain't god he'll
[1:26:57] stutter me
[1:27:00] all right
[1:27:02] i know
[1:27:04] he knows what that man will think or
[1:27:06] what that woman will say
[1:27:08] and we have to be careful how we give it
[1:27:09] to him that's right because they can
[1:27:11] turn that thing around and they can
[1:27:12] blaspheme that's right
[1:27:14] he knows this thing i'm glad he does
[1:27:16] that when i'm saying okay
[1:27:23] okay lord
[1:27:25] i understand that you know we have to
[1:27:27] grow up but let's look over in matthew
[1:27:29] chapter
[1:27:30] 27 just for a minute i'm gonna stop
[1:27:32] right here i'm gonna get this right here
[1:27:33] i'm gonna finish it right here
[1:27:35] we sure appreciate each and every one of
[1:27:37] you
[1:27:39] verse three said then judas
[1:27:41] which had betrayed him
[1:27:43] when he saw that he was condemned
[1:27:46] repented himself and brought again the
[1:27:48] thirty pieces of silver
[1:27:51] to the chief priests and the elders
[1:27:55] this is saying i have sinned
[1:27:57] and that i have betrayed the innocent
[1:27:59] blood
[1:28:00] and they said
[1:28:02] what is that
[1:28:04] to us
[1:28:05] look at their attitude
[1:28:07] he says see thou
[1:28:09] to that
[1:28:10] and he cast down the 30 pieces of silver
[1:28:12] in the temple and departed and went and
[1:28:15] hanged himself
[1:28:17] and the chief priest
[1:28:19] took the silver pieces and said it is
[1:28:22] not lawful for to put them into the
[1:28:24] treasury because it is the
[1:28:26] price of blood
[1:28:28] right
[1:28:30] he said and they took counsel and
[1:28:32] brought with them
[1:28:34] bought with it
[1:28:35] and bought within the potter's field
[1:28:39] to bury strangers in
[1:28:41] oh god hit you glad repent
[1:28:43] buried in christ
[1:28:45] he said wherefore the field was called
[1:28:48] the field of blood unto this day
[1:28:52] then once fulfilled that which was
[1:28:53] spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and
[1:28:56] they took the 30 pieces of silver the
[1:28:59] price of him that was valued
[1:29:02] whom they are the children of israel did
[1:29:04] value
[1:29:06] and gave them
[1:29:08] for the potter's field
[1:29:09] as the lord appointed me
[1:29:12] remember when we read over there
[1:29:15] and deuteronomy
[1:29:17] and uh
[1:29:18] deuteronomy
[1:29:20] i want to look at the price right here
[1:29:21] for just a minute i'm going to stop
[1:29:23] right here let's look at this now let's
[1:29:25] look at those silver pieces god showed
[1:29:28] me this little simple thing and i want
[1:29:29] to share it with you now let's look at a
[1:29:32] joseph he was estimated at the young
[1:29:34] man's price you can turn back to look
[1:29:36] with me in deuteronomy chapter 27. look
[1:29:38] at those first 10 verses everybody talks
[1:29:40] about values
[1:29:42] but look at this now we know that joseph
[1:29:45] was a soul of his brother for the price
[1:29:49] of 20 pieces of silver god spoke to me
[1:29:52] and said that was the price of a young
[1:29:54] man right and look at the woman she was
[1:29:57] sold for 30 pieces of silver god said i
[1:30:00] wasn't even valued at the price of a man
[1:30:02] because i didn't come to redeem me i
[1:30:05] came to redeem my wife right
[1:30:07] and there is the estimation of those 30
[1:30:10] pieces of silver that judas
[1:30:13] sold jesus for
[1:30:15] the female was estimated he took the
[1:30:17] value
[1:30:18] of the woman to redeem his wife
[1:30:21] 30
[1:30:22] pieces of silver amen he said i come to
[1:30:27] redeem my way
[1:30:29] amen
[1:30:30] not to redeem the man the man was 50
[1:30:33] pieces of silver what about that what
[1:30:36] about that god
[1:30:38] went ahead and said i'll take the value
[1:30:40] of the woman
[1:30:41] you can value me at the value of a woman
[1:30:44] it was supposed to be it was supposed to
[1:30:46] be disgraceful to him to be valued as a
[1:30:49] man at that price that's 30 pieces of
[1:30:52] silver but in his disgrace
[1:30:54] we took on his grace
[1:30:57] isn't that beautiful how god and you
[1:31:00] know what every scripture has a meaning
[1:31:02] every scripture has a thought and i
[1:31:04] dolphin wondered what did that 30 pieces
[1:31:07] of silver
[1:31:08] had a value what did it really mean i
[1:31:10] knew it solely for but where it has to
[1:31:12] be somewhere in the scripture and the
[1:31:14] lord showed it to me one day he said
[1:31:16] read that again
[1:31:17] i preached on the vein of the blood one
[1:31:18] other time
[1:31:19] uh another time
[1:31:21] and he said go back and read that again
[1:31:22] i want to show you something i was back
[1:31:24] there in the study
[1:31:25] he said read that again
[1:31:27] i read that he said look at joseph
[1:31:30] 20 pieces
[1:31:32] i said
[1:31:33] ah
[1:31:34] i never thought that
[1:31:35] you know it's i think when god gives it
[1:31:37] to us because he gets the glory
[1:31:39] he said read on down
[1:31:42] 30 pieces for the female
[1:31:44] woman
[1:31:45] you know he didn't come to buy our baby
[1:31:47] and come to marry a woman i'm a cuter
[1:31:49] bride
[1:31:50] and he said now look at what judah sold
[1:31:52] me for they estimated me like the value
[1:31:56] of a woman amen he said but i was
[1:31:59] willing to take that because i
[1:32:01] didn't need redemption but the woman did
[1:32:04] and i said my
[1:32:06] thank you lord that you estimated me
[1:32:09] that you estimate yourself and you took
[1:32:12] on my price
[1:32:13] you know where it said the priest will
[1:32:15] value and give an estimation he was
[1:32:17] willing being the faithful high priest
[1:32:19] to take that value of what they valued
[1:32:21] at him
[1:32:22] and he took that on
[1:32:24] and he become the redemption for mankind
[1:32:27] amen now i like where it says down in
[1:32:29] the scripture you know what
[1:32:31] and the prophet of god talked about
[1:32:32] jeremiah when he talked about that he
[1:32:34] went down and he bought the potter's
[1:32:36] feet
[1:32:36] with that that's where me and you come
[1:32:38] from the partner went down into the
[1:32:41] field
[1:32:42] and getting in you to mold me and make
[1:32:45] you into vessels of honor
[1:32:47] i said oh my god you make the scripture
[1:32:50] so alive all right
[1:32:52] you make the scripture come so alive you
[1:32:54] went down to the you know what the
[1:32:56] problem god said one time he said we
[1:32:58] have come

[1:33:02] house to be broken when he go down to

[1:33:28] of a woman

[1:33:33] ask to estimate a man at the value of a
[1:33:36] woman him being a man
[1:33:38] but he said there was no disgrace to me
[1:33:41] he said because i didn't need redemption
