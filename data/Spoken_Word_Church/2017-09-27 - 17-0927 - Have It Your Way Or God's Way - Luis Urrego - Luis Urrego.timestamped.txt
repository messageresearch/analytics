[3:12] it's up to you between you and God if
[3:14] you don't feel that way
[3:16] amen praise the Lord let's let's just go
[3:19] to the let's go to the to the scriptures
[3:24] tonight and in Jonah chapter 4 Jonah
[3:28] chapter 4 and appreciate each and every
[3:34] one of you for praying for us to Sunday
[3:37] we were in South Carolina ministering
[3:39] for brother Burley Williams there and
[3:42] near my hometown well where I grew up
[3:47] part of my life there in Anderson so it
[3:51] was good to see all my family there and
[3:52] everything said and the Burley wasn't
[3:55] there he's he was in the UK but the
[3:59] Saints there they send greetings to you
[4:01] all brother Dale and everybody amen so
[4:04] we had a good time amen I believe the
[4:07] Lord Lord bless the people and it's kind
[4:10] of strange because I had to administer
[4:11] in English and Spanish you know they
[4:13] have people there that don't speak
[4:15] English and so when brother Bradley gave
[4:18] me a call he said brother Louise my
[4:21] interpreter is not gonna be there either
[4:22] he was in Oregon ministering as well so
[4:25] he said you think you could do it in
[4:26] English and Spanish and I've done that
[4:28] once before I believe I said well let's
[4:30] do it but the Lord helped me out and you
[4:33] know so you know transitioning between
[4:36] English and Spanish you know is you know
[4:38] interpreting is a little difficult but
[4:40] then when you're having to preach in
[4:41] both languages you know that's another
[4:43] thing but but we had church amen so
[4:45] appreciate the Lord for that amen
[4:48] praise God let's just turn let's just go
[4:50] to Jonah chapter 4 Jonah chapter 4 verse
[4:52] 1 it says but it displeased Jonah
[4:56] exceedingly and he was very angry and he
[5:00] prayed unto the Lord and said I pray
[5:02] thee O Lord was not this my saying when
[5:06] I was yet in my country therefore I fled
[5:09] before unto Tarsus for I knew that thou
[5:13] art a gracious God and merciful slow to
[5:16] anger and of great kindness and
[5:19] repentance thee of the evil aren't you
[5:22] thankful that he's that way amen
[5:25] that's why he's God and I'm not
[5:28] therefore now O Lord take I beseech thee
[5:32] my life from me for it is better for me
[5:35] to die than to live then said the Lord
[5:39] there was now well to be angry I wonder
[5:42] if that's a question that the Lord asks
[5:43] should ask us some of us so Jonah went
[5:47] out of the city and sat on the east side
[5:50] of the city and there made him a booth
[5:52] just go whine a little bit and said
[5:54] under in the shadow till he might see
[5:57] what he would would become of the city
[5:59] Amen let's just have a word of Prayer
[6:00] our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[6:02] further your blessings that you provide
[6:04] for us through your word now father God
[6:06] anoints lips that we just have just to
[6:09] say what you would want us to say Lord
[6:11] you know the needs of your people and
[6:12] father God just help us you speak to you
[6:15] the people father God open up our ears
[6:17] of our understanding that we were only
[6:19] here Oh father God what you would have
[6:20] to say unto us Lord and not what a man
[6:23] has to say father we pray we commit
[6:25] ourselves into you now in the name of
[6:27] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[6:29] any man praise God you may be seated
[6:31] this evening praise the Lord I also
[6:35] wanted to read proverbs chapter 14 verse
[6:38] 12 says which says there is a way which
[6:42] seemeth right unto a man but the end
[6:45] thereof are the ways of death amen
[6:48] praise God and I want to call this out
[6:52] title this message have it your way or
[6:55] God's Way
[6:56] man you know the step by the way do you
[7:01] know he's been preaching about the seals
[7:02] brother Dale's been bringing forth what
[7:04] he's been bringing and now we're gonna
[7:06] just kind of get a little bit down to
[7:08] our lives a little bit and if I say if I
[7:10] say something that might might step on
[7:14] your toes well maybe they needed to be
[7:17] step on you know because let me tell you
[7:20] we all have a little bit of Jonas in
[7:23] each and every one of us and if you say
[7:25] if you say that you don't or you've
[7:27] never experienced some of the things
[7:30] that Jonas has a Jonah here has
[7:32] experienced maybe you're lying because
[7:37] all of us have a little bit of Jonah
[7:40] some of us have a lot of Jonah and I'll
[7:42] be the first one to raise my hand I'm
[7:45] hard-headed stubborn but I pray God that
[7:47] God would just take that Oh and he's
[7:50] working on me just like the little song
[7:52] says he's still working on me I'm glad
[7:54] he is that means he's not done with me
[7:56] because he's still working amen praise
[7:59] the Lord so the you know and I want to
[8:02] just throw this in I wanted to throw
[8:04] this in that in second Timothy chapter 3
[8:06] just for those who say well you know
[8:09] what he's not preaching deep you know
[8:11] he's not going deep but let me tell you
[8:13] about the grace of God the grace of God
[8:14] is very deep it's something that you and
[8:16] me don't understand and we can't
[8:18] experience the grace of God we don't
[8:20] know how to have the grace of God the
[8:22] way God has the grace the grace for
[8:26] people you and me it feels up to you and
[8:28] me I thought I'd kill people you know
[8:31] what I'd say Lord take him out take him
[8:33] out because that's not what out you know
[8:35] but God sees things a different way amen
[8:38] and second Timothy chapter 3 says all
[8:41] Scripture is given by inspiration of God
[8:43] it says all scripture and is profitable
[8:47] for doctrine for reproof for correction
[8:49] for instruction in righteousness that
[8:52] the man of God may be perfect thoroughly
[8:56] furnished unto all good works I believe
[8:59] we can add the Book of Jonah in there
[9:00] hey man
[9:02] praise the Lord how many love the Lord
[9:03] Amen so you know Burger King they had
[9:07] they had a saying
[9:09] for a long time they said have it your
[9:11] way when they were sell their food how
[9:14] many remember that have it your way and
[9:16] they were trying to let the people know
[9:19] that you know you want it you're gonna
[9:22] get it the way you want it
[9:24] in reality you know there was already a
[9:26] cookie cutter method for them to serve
[9:28] your food but they were trying to bring
[9:30] that to the people you know to have it
[9:32] your way
[9:33] and but you know I don't know about you
[9:36] and the spiritual there is your way and
[9:39] I don't want that you know your own way
[9:40] will lead you to destruction I would
[9:43] rather eat God's hamburger than my own
[9:46] hamburger amen
[9:47] God's hamburger taste better it doesn't
[9:50] have any fillers and doesn't have any
[9:52] antibiotics and all these kinds of
[9:54] things amen and you know there is a
[9:57] consequence you know if you're
[9:59] constantly eating at Burger King right
[10:01] you're gonna see it are you gonna see it
[10:04] show up amen the view that that's what
[10:06] you constantly eat and so there is going
[10:09] to be a consequences for you to have
[10:11] your way I'd rather have God's Way amen
[10:14] praise the Lord Jesus amen so tonight I
[10:18] want to gear this message you know it's
[10:19] for all of us but I want to also gear it
[10:22] to the toward the young people as well
[10:24] amen so I believe each and ever one of
[10:27] us are young
[10:28] we're heading to youth and those who may
[10:31] feel little wearying that you're you're
[10:34] becoming younger amen praise God amen so
[10:39] we know just a little bit of background
[10:41] we know Jonah he was a true prophet of
[10:44] God he meant and you know people
[10:45] criticized and I know we have a little
[10:47] Jonah's here tonight and brother Joe
[10:50] little boy but when I'm a brunette when
[10:53] I'm talking about Jonah well I'm not
[10:54] referring to him I'm talking about this
[10:56] Jonah amen amen
[10:59] so so Rachel and and brother Joe you you
[11:03] you know that amen praise God but in the
[11:07] Bible we don't know too much about Jonah
[11:09] other that he lived in the days of one
[11:11] of Israel's Kings which was Jeroboam ii
[11:14] there's another scripture in the Bible
[11:17] where it talks about Jonah and that's in
[11:18] 2nd Kings chapter 14 verse 25 which says
[11:23] worse 23 I'll start here at verse 25 he
[11:26] restored the coast of Israel from the
[11:29] entering of hema 'the unto the sea of
[11:31] the plain talking about King Jeroboam
[11:33] the second according to the word of the
[11:35] Lord God Israel which he spake by the
[11:38] hand of his servant Jonah the son of
[11:41] Amitai the prophet which was of gaffer
[11:44] so we see here that Jonah was who we
[11:48] seen here that he was the son of Amitai
[11:50] and he was also from gaffer and gaffer
[11:54] is a area in Israel just right above
[11:58] just right above Jerusalem around the
[12:01] place where Jesus was actually born near
[12:03] Nazareth and so and so during this time
[12:09] that Jonah during this reign of Jeroboam
[12:11] ii there was a lot of political and
[12:14] economic prosperity in the kingdom but
[12:18] there was not any spiritual prosperity
[12:21] and if there was very little king
[12:24] jeroboam reign for about forty one years
[12:26] according to what the Bible says and so
[12:30] Jonah he prophesied that King Jeroboam
[12:32] he was going to have this prosperity
[12:33] that was going to come to Israel at that
[12:36] time so we know that he was a God sent
[12:38] God called man right I don't think any
[12:41] one of us could argue with that Amen
[12:42] praise God and so we see here in in
[12:47] Jonah chapter one in Jonah chapter one
[12:51] if you want to if the brothers would
[12:52] just want to bring it up on the screen
[12:54] and we'll just kind of we just want to
[12:56] kind of go through through the Book of
[12:58] Jonah here is four chapters amen but
[13:03] they're very powerful chapters the story
[13:07] of Jonah is very interesting amen and so
[13:09] you know the Lord was just been been
[13:11] dealing with me about this and and so I
[13:14] hope something you receive a blessing
[13:16] from it Amen praise God it says it says
[13:22] in Jonah chapter 1 it says in verse 1
[13:24] now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah
[13:26] the son of amat I see we see there again
[13:30] who he
[13:31] referencing that he was the son of
[13:33] Amitai saying arise go to Nineveh that
[13:36] great city and cry against it for their
[13:40] wickedness has come up before me amen so
[13:43] we see here that God is telling Jonah to
[13:47] arise because there is a city that needs
[13:51] his that needs his his ministry man and
[13:56] we know God God could do things himself
[13:58] but I mean we know he uses man he used
[13:59] he used the man in this hour right he
[14:02] used as a fivefold ministry in this hour
[14:04] to speak to us amen to help us amen and
[14:07] so we had and we know that God knows the
[14:11] beginning from the end so before even he
[14:13] called he knew what was going to happen
[14:15] he knew what was going to be Jonas's
[14:17] response and so he he tells him go and
[14:21] cry against this city for this city is
[14:24] uh
[14:25] is wicked and the stench of the city has
[14:28] come up before me now I wanna I wanna I
[14:31] want to read just just a little bit of
[14:34] just a little bit of history about about
[14:38] the the city about the city Nineveh so
[14:41] the Nineveh was a very prosperous city
[14:44] and it was very elaborate it was very
[14:47] elaborately well built populated by
[14:49] different kinds of peoples from the from
[14:50] around the Middle East so it was
[14:52] somewhat like the city of Los Angeles
[14:54] which was a group a group of cities that
[14:57] they made the the city of Los Angeles
[14:59] right it was a pagan city Ishtar was the
[15:03] goddess of fertility and war and that
[15:06] was the goddess that they worshiped and
[15:08] they also had another goddess by the
[15:09] name of ninja and ninja was was the
[15:13] female version or the female counterpart
[15:15] of Dagon which was the fish God and
[15:18] brother branham he talks about the this
[15:21] that this city they worshipped the fish
[15:23] God and it was very possible that when
[15:26] Jonah rose and landed on the shore that
[15:29] they saw that he came out of mouth of
[15:31] the fish and therefore that's the reason
[15:32] why they served you know they repented
[15:34] and they heard and heard his message but
[15:37] now look at what the Israelite people in
[15:41] Jonah one of the reasons why he didn't
[15:43] want to go
[15:45] this is this is what it's talking about
[15:46] Nineveh just looking at some history
[15:48] says when God said that Nineveh was
[15:50] wicked he was not kidding not only were
[15:53] they extremely immoral but the Assyrians
[15:56] had a reputation for cruelty that is
[15:59] hard for us to fathom their specialty
[16:02] was brutality of a gross and disgusting
[16:05] kind when their armies captured a city
[16:08] or a country unspeakable atrocities were
[16:12] occur things like skinning people alive
[16:16] decapitation mutilation ripping out the
[16:19] tongues making a pyramid of human heads
[16:22] this is when they would go and conquer a
[16:25] city or a nation this is what they would
[16:27] take all the males and decapitate them
[16:30] and make pyramids out of out of the the
[16:32] male's heads piercing the chin with a
[16:35] rope and forcing prisoners to live in
[16:37] kennels like dogs ancient records from
[16:40] Assyria boast of this kind of cruelty as
[16:42] a badge of courage and power
[16:44] so the Assyria and the record assyrian
[16:46] records where the Nineveh is currently
[16:48] located word or it was located it's
[16:51] right it's located where Mosul Iraq is
[16:54] currently right now and it's just later
[16:56] ruins right now but this is what they
[16:58] record and they were proud and they
[17:00] boast of these things so you see no
[17:03] wonder that Israelite people hated hated
[17:06] the Assyrians hated the people of
[17:08] Nineveh and and why would Jonah's not a
[17:11] same thing he hated these people he
[17:14] hated he would be more than glad to have
[17:17] seen them being destroyed just like you
[17:20] know today you know a lot of a lot of
[17:22] Christians and a lot of people and I
[17:24] believe in some form of programming but
[17:26] they have this thing against the the the
[17:28] that the Muslims are gonna come and get
[17:31] us and all these kinds of things and and
[17:33] you know what and they have this this
[17:35] hate towards the Muslim people but you
[17:38] know what God loves the Muslim people
[17:39] just as much as he loves you I believe I
[17:42] believe that God can save the Muslim
[17:44] people amen I believe that God there's a
[17:47] sister there's a sister up in Canada
[17:49] that she was a Muslim and she goes to a
[17:52] messege church up there in Canada and
[17:54] she got saved so God can save Muslims
[17:58] amen so they're not they're not they're
[18:00] not all evil amen
[18:03] praise God we got God where God has a
[18:06] heart for the people that we Don that's
[18:08] why we don't understand what grace is
[18:09] all about it men and you know it's a
[18:13] very common word that's be that we use
[18:16] the grace of God in that it's using
[18:18] Christianity when you say the grace of
[18:20] God the grace grace but it's sometimes
[18:25] hard for us to to fathom you know if
[18:27] somebody's trying to give us something
[18:28] somebody calls you up and says well
[18:31] you're going to do the book you want a
[18:35] Bahamas trip for five days and five
[18:37] nights - you know - the Bahamas on a
[18:40] cruise well the first thing that comes
[18:42] to your mind is uh well what's the catch
[18:46] because I mean there's nothing free in
[18:48] life there's nothing free in life you
[18:51] know what's the catch and you're
[18:52] wondering what I'm gonna have to pay
[18:55] something in just a moment something's
[18:58] gonna my brother's good bank account is
[18:59] going to be something's gonna come out
[19:02] of my bank account because there's you
[19:04] know we're being programmed nothing's
[19:05] free in life but God a man all the way
[19:08] for instance since uh since even before
[19:12] a since Abraham he was showing us what
[19:15] hid what His grace was all about in
[19:17] Exodus chapter 34 he says when and when
[19:20] speaking to Moses he says and the Lord
[19:22] passed by before him and proclaimed we
[19:26] speak when he was speaking to Moses and
[19:28] proclaimed this is what the Lord
[19:30] proclaimed he said the Lord the Lord God
[19:32] merciful and gracious long-suffering and
[19:35] abundant in goodness and truth they
[19:38] meant keeping mercy for thousands
[19:41] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[19:43] sin and that will by no means clear the
[19:47] guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[19:49] father's upon the children I'm glad that
[19:51] he mentioned grace and mercy before he
[19:54] mentioned that he was going to visit the
[19:56] iniquity of that you know that's why
[19:58] he's all about he would rather give
[19:59] grace and give mercy and forgive before
[20:02] he would gen send judgment that's our
[20:04] God amen
[20:05] praise the Lord I'm thankful for that in
[20:08] this hour
[20:08] because like I said I certainly needed
[20:10] that grace I certainly needed that mercy
[20:13] amen
[20:14] and so grace is very shocking to us as
[20:17] humans something we don't understand the
[20:21] grace of God that's why I said I'm
[20:23] careful that he's God and I'm not
[20:25] because that's the first thing I would
[20:27] do you know I the homosexual out here
[20:30] what we want to do condemnation God said
[20:33] in his word God can say the homosexual -
[20:36] amen the prostitute out here the
[20:39] drunkard the no matter who it is amen
[20:41] you know what and you and me could have
[20:43] been that way if it wasn't for the grace
[20:46] of God amen and we know that the the
[20:49] capstone amen the headstone is crying
[20:52] grace grace grace amen
[20:54] I'm thankful because if that grace which
[20:57] is Jesus Christ amen if that grace is
[21:00] abiding in you and me then that's what
[21:02] we need to be shown to people as well
[21:04] grace grace and this our mercy before
[21:07] judgment but we're so quick to to judge
[21:10] when somebody does us wrong or where we
[21:13] hear that somebody's saying something
[21:14] about us or something's talking about us
[21:16] you don't even get the whole story you
[21:18] just heard it from that person and
[21:19] you're quick to judge amen
[21:22] but so that's the that's that's what
[21:27] grace we don't understand what grace is
[21:29] all about amen so Jonah here in in in in
[21:33] Chapter 1 he receives a phone call from
[21:36] God and says go to Nineveh because
[21:40] there's a people that you need to preach
[21:42] to over there amen
[21:43] and and and sometimes in that type of
[21:47] phone call then you know sometimes we
[21:49] may get a phone call that way and it
[21:52] changes your life completely and maybe
[21:54] on that line they may maybe somebody the
[21:56] same well you have a great aunt or
[21:58] something like that and you're inherited
[22:00] hundreds of thousands of dollars well
[22:02] that'd be great news but then they're on
[22:05] the other line they could be somebody
[22:06] who's saying you know somebody that
[22:08] close just passed away and it just
[22:10] changed your life forever right and this
[22:12] is the kind of message that that Jonah
[22:15] received something that had changed his
[22:17] life forever because I'm sure he wasn't
[22:19] the same from then on
[22:21] amen so we see here in Jonah and Jonah
[22:23] and Minh that's the thing that God he
[22:27] loves to pull us out of our comfort
[22:29] zones you know I mean what is your
[22:33] Nineveh you each and every one of us
[22:37] have an innovating our lives sometimes
[22:39] we just get so comfortable and lacks Oh
[22:42] every Sunday we're gonna go to church
[22:44] and we know that there's gonna be 45
[22:47] minutes of song of 30 minutes of song
[22:49] leading and brother Dale is gonna come
[22:52] out and preach and then we go home and
[22:54] you know we just kind of get in the
[22:56] routine and and but maybe our Nineveh is
[22:59] that next-door neighbor next to your
[23:01] house that you that just gets on your
[23:04] nerves because you don't cut the grass
[23:07] maybe that's your Nineveh maybe maybe
[23:10] the your Nineveh is uh you know
[23:13] something something for the young people
[23:16] you know in Nineveh
[23:17] I can't I can't I can't get on the phone
[23:21] like the cellphone the way out the way I
[23:22] want to you know chat on Facebook I come
[23:25] why can't I have a Facebook account the
[23:26] way you know just all open access you
[23:29] know and everything you know but you see
[23:32] God knows exactly what he needs to do in
[23:36] order to to make us to kind of rubber
[23:38] our fur a little bit a man and this is
[23:41] what he did to Jonah a man so we read we
[23:44] continue to read here in Jonah chapter 1
[23:46] is in verse 2 it says arise go to
[23:48] Nineveh that great city and cry against
[23:50] it for their wickedness has come up
[23:52] before me but Jonah rose up and you
[23:55] would think here in the next verse that
[23:57] they would say now Jonah rose up and he
[24:00] went to Nineveh but that's but that's
[24:05] not what it says right that's but Jonah
[24:08] rose up to flee on to Tarshish you see
[24:11] that was his intention to flee on to
[24:13] Tarshish from the presence of the Lord
[24:15] and went down to Joppa and he found this
[24:19] ship going to Tarshish so he paid the
[24:21] fare thereof and went down into it now I
[24:25] want you to see how the Lord is saying
[24:26] down down
[24:31] and we see that later on he goes down
[24:34] down further down you know and that's
[24:37] the spirit that's our spiritual life
[24:39] sometimes because when you're not when
[24:41] you're going down you're certainly not
[24:43] going up later on we're gonna see that
[24:45] he's down in the cabin then he goes down
[24:48] into the sea and then finally he's down
[24:50] into a whale's belly or if big fish
[24:53] belly and his that's the climax of his
[24:55] spiritual life but but God you know God
[24:59] has certain say he has all intentions to
[25:01] go to Tarshish all intentions to go to
[25:04] Tarsus and he goes and he buys a ticket
[25:06] and I'm sure when he boards the boat you
[25:10] know he I'm sure he he's packing his
[25:11] bags and everything the night before he
[25:13] says I'm leaving I'm sorry Lord I'm not
[25:18] going over there to speak to Nineveh
[25:20] that's just not me he goes packs his
[25:23] bags leaves play pays for his ticket and
[25:26] he goes down into a cabin and he
[25:29] probably takes off his sandals and in
[25:31] the sits on the bed and just just to
[25:34] relax wow this is nice you know probably
[25:38] has a nice little cabin window right
[25:40] there next to him where he can look at
[25:41] the ocean view and and and so he's just
[25:45] relaxed you know and the Bible says in
[25:48] verse 4 said but the Lord sent out a
[25:50] great wind into the sea and there was a
[25:53] mighty tempest in the sea so that the
[25:54] ship was like to be broken so God we see
[25:58] that God is the one that's doing all
[26:00] this amen and when Jonah thought that he
[26:03] was able to escape from the presence of
[26:05] God or try to get away when he bought
[26:08] that ticket to Tarshish you know when
[26:10] Satan when when you want to flee from
[26:13] the presence of the Lord in your
[26:14] spiritual life when you're trying to get
[26:16] away from the God and you're trying to
[26:18] do you know Satan and he'll provide a
[26:20] boat for you he'll provide a way for you
[26:23] to get you know I got many boats to
[26:26] choose from you want to go you want to
[26:27] go here you want to go here you want to
[26:29] go here there's plenty to choose and
[26:31] he'll provide the transportation for you
[26:34] and so he found a ship to go to Tarshish
[26:37] and but you know what when we think that
[26:40] we're doing the our own thing and we
[26:42] think we're getting away from the Lord
[26:43] and the Lord
[26:44] Huff's he just allows us to just do just
[26:47] go ahead go go on go on
[26:50] that doesn't mean you're right doesn't
[26:54] mean you're right but he lets us because
[26:57] he snows that he has a lesson to show
[26:59] here and that's why he's gonna show here
[27:01] and just say he has a lesson for Jonah
[27:03] amen and verse four says but the Lord
[27:07] sent out or we would just read that
[27:08] verse 5 then the Mariners were afraid
[27:11] and cried every man unto his God and
[27:13] cast forth the where's that's the cargo
[27:16] that were in the ship into the seat
[27:19] lightened to lighten the boat so we see
[27:22] here that God sends this this this storm
[27:29] and it was so strong that they had to
[27:31] cast out the the cargo from the boat
[27:33] amen
[27:34] and it was it was and God had it was
[27:38] just looking at Jonah's the whole time
[27:40] and the only reason why this was
[27:41] happening to the ship was because Jonas
[27:43] was on the boat and and the people were
[27:46] being affected by what was going on they
[27:49] didn't they didn't they didn't do
[27:50] anything it wasn't their fault that the
[27:52] ship was in chaos and they were in the
[27:54] middle of the storm it was all Jonah
[27:57] showing us that that you you know you
[28:00] don't sin alone when you sin and you're
[28:04] doing things behind behind people's back
[28:07] you're you're not just gonna affect
[28:09] yourself you're gonna affect your wife
[28:10] you're gonna affect your children you're
[28:13] gonna affect the church you're gonna
[28:14] affect the pastor you're gonna affect
[28:16] everybody around you so you think you're
[28:19] doing something sneaky and you're trying
[28:20] to get away with with with something and
[28:24] nobody's seeing you for first of all God
[28:26] sees you that's more than enough for two
[28:29] to bring the fear upon you right but
[28:33] eventually you're gonna affect the
[28:35] people that you love around you amen
[28:38] I've been there done that and you affect
[28:42] the ones that love the ones that you
[28:44] love around you and and this is what
[28:48] happened to Jonas so he the people that
[28:52] there wasn't it wasn't they're there
[28:53] they're there their fault so verse 6 it
[28:57] says here - so - it
[28:58] Master came to him and said unto him and
[29:01] I can imagine the ship master that the
[29:02] ship was in the middle of this chaos and
[29:05] this ship master he's he's going around
[29:07] and around the cabins knocking to make
[29:09] sure is everybody okay is everything
[29:12] going okay
[29:12] and he goes over to Jonases uh cabin and
[29:16] he finds him sleeping because he's over
[29:20] there knocking and nobody is opening the
[29:22] door he knocks again excuse me sir
[29:26] nobody's opening the door finally he
[29:28] just kind of latches the door open and
[29:30] he sees this man sleeping and in the
[29:32] middle of this storm and you know what
[29:35] Satan Satan when you're out doing wrong
[29:37] and stuff like that he's got sleeping
[29:38] pills for you
[29:40] he's got pills where you you you have
[29:43] nothing you know nobody knows anything
[29:45] and and so everything's okay you know
[29:47] everything's quite all right and I'm
[29:50] here in my I'm doing it by myself and
[29:53] everything's quite all right and and you
[29:55] know and you're blind to what's going on
[29:57] this is exactly what's happening to
[29:59] Jonas in the middle of the storm
[30:01] such storm that they had to throw out
[30:04] their cargo mariners are panicking all
[30:07] over the place and Jonah's downstairs
[30:09] sleeping yeah my yeah I'm wondering if
[30:13] some of us are not sleeping in this hour
[30:15] you know the Bible says that there's
[30:17] going to there's a sleeping virgin in
[30:19] the light and then in the in this Howard
[30:22] there's a sleeping virgin and that's not
[30:24] just the denomination that could be
[30:27] those who say they believe in a prophet
[30:30] Oh III believe the profit I've came into
[30:36] the message you know fifty years ago and
[30:38] I know I'm saved and filled with the
[30:40] Holy Ghost but when the word goes forth
[30:44] in this hour when don't when when the
[30:47] word is is being laid out you know in in
[30:50] brother Wade's been bringing out some of
[30:52] the good things on the seals and stuff
[30:53] like that and you cringe about that are
[30:58] you receiving the word for your day amen
[31:01] because I mean we're beyond God sent a
[31:04] prophet I mean we should be amen I
[31:07] believe God sent a prophet I believe I
[31:10] believe that he sent but I want to know
[31:12] what he said that's what I want amen
[31:15] I want to know what he said praise God
[31:17] so the shipmaster came to him and said
[31:20] unto him what meanest thou o sleeper
[31:22] arise Colin died Gardens it's a sieve
[31:25] maybe if think upon us that we perished
[31:27] not and they said every one to his
[31:31] fellow come and let us cast lots that we
[31:33] may know for whose cause this evil is
[31:35] upon us so they cast lots lady in there
[31:39] knitting that they didn't know what else
[31:40] to do the destroyit started gambling in
[31:44] the middle of this storm started
[31:46] gambling that you know I don't have they
[31:47] had dice or what but they cast lots
[31:49] somebody's causing this and it might be
[31:52] that sleeper down there and so they cast
[31:56] the Lots and the Lots we know and just
[31:59] trying to avoid a little bit of reading
[32:01] so like the time but and the Lots fall
[32:04] on Jonah and don't you think that God
[32:08] wasn't in control of those Lots now I'm
[32:13] gonna show you a scripture here in the
[32:14] Bible the Bible says in proverbs chapter
[32:18] 16 verse 33 it says the law is cast into
[32:21] the lap but the whole disposing thereof
[32:24] is of the Lord so people can you know
[32:27] people through these Lots in the ship
[32:29] but it laying it and it landed on Jonah
[32:31] Atlanta for Jonah and God was in full
[32:34] control of all that just as he was in
[32:36] full control of the storm coming in and
[32:38] I believe he even allowed for him to
[32:40] even board the ship as well
[32:43] he said okay Jonah is that what that's
[32:45] what you want let me go ahead and uh
[32:48] here you go here you go and Jonah
[32:50] thinking the whole time he's getting
[32:51] away from the presence of God I wonder
[32:53] if that's how some of us don't think you
[32:55] know oh I'm just getting away with it
[32:58] I'm having my own way but Nederland
[33:00] knowing that God he is perfect his his
[33:03] permissive will will always turn into
[33:05] his perfect way amen praise God amen and
[33:09] you know Jonah probably thinking in his
[33:10] mind before he boarded the ship he's
[33:12] probably thinking oh my well because you
[33:15] know how sometimes we rationalize things
[33:17] in our head and we spiritualize things
[33:21] and say Lord will Lord maybe I mean I
[33:25] know in Tarsus they need the Lord just
[33:27] as much as an in event so I'm gonna go
[33:30] to Tarshish you know and I prayed about
[33:32] it you know and you know everything's
[33:35] everything's everything's all right and
[33:37] you know what Lord I'm confident because
[33:39] I went down to Joppa and I had the money
[33:43] to pay for the fare III was there was a
[33:46] ship it's straight for Tosha so this has
[33:48] to be the will of God yeah and he's
[33:50] probably there just you know Lane when
[33:52] he was laying down and fell honestly
[33:54] just thinking about that just reason and
[33:56] don't we do that sometimes the reason in
[33:58] our heads you know about whether we
[34:00] should do something or not
[34:02] and brother brother Graham said if
[34:04] there's a question about it don't do it
[34:05] at all you know there's a question about
[34:08] it right praise God so the lot falls on
[34:14] Jonah and so we continue reading here in
[34:17] verse nine or verse eight then said they
[34:21] unto him tell us we pray thee for whose
[34:23] cause this evil is upon us what is done
[34:26] occupation or no what is your job and
[34:28] whence where when do you where do you
[34:31] come from whence cometh thou what is
[34:32] that country and of what people art thou
[34:34] and he said unto them Jonas is that I am
[34:38] a Hebrew and I fear the Lord the God of
[34:41] heaven which hath made the sea and the
[34:43] dry land isn't it a shame that that's
[34:46] that that we have to confess you know
[34:50] the weird out doing the worldly things
[34:52] and when we're out in the world you know
[34:54] and eventually when that's not really
[34:57] in us to do but we're just following the
[34:59] crowd eventually we're gonna have to
[35:00] really confess who we really are it's
[35:02] gonna show forth a man I know what I
[35:05] know when I was uh when I was a out in
[35:08] the world doing the things of the world
[35:10] I know how it was raised I was raised
[35:11] right I was raised to serve God and I
[35:15] accepted the Lord Jesus as a savior when
[35:17] I was 12 years old and I was out daily
[35:20] downlink of the world and with my
[35:21] friends and they're out smoking
[35:23] cigarettes and I'm sitting there trying
[35:24] to smoke cigarettes and couldn't do it
[35:27] just couldn't do it I never did inhale
[35:32] [Laughter]
[35:38] you know I just I never learned how
[35:41] and you've heard that before
[35:44] top ranking official but and you know it
[35:51] was something like okay yeah I wanted to
[35:53] fit in but at the same time I couldn't
[35:55] fit in and they would ask me what's
[35:57] wrong it's wrong well you know I just
[35:59] can't do that I'll get you venture I
[36:01] would have to let them know you know
[36:02] that's just not I can't do that you know
[36:05] and when you're when God is dealing with
[36:07] you a man young people listen when God
[36:09] is really truly dealing with you you
[36:12] can't do the things of the world and
[36:14] he'll it and live happy and the things
[36:16] of the world you can't be happy with
[36:18] with uh you know just just doing any old
[36:22] thing and getting by with it and
[36:24] thinking you know when God is really
[36:25] working in your life if God is really
[36:28] working and doing their work in your
[36:29] life right amen
[36:31] things are gonna change in your life
[36:32] they're not gonna be the same they're
[36:35] not gonna be the same praise God so
[36:38] first believe burst and then we're the
[36:41] man exceedingly afraid after Jonas told
[36:44] him this and why has thou done this for
[36:46] the men knew that the fled from the
[36:47] presence of the Lord because he had told
[36:49] him so the people were afraid on the
[36:51] ship because they knew about Israel I'm
[36:54] sure they knew about Israel and I'm sure
[36:56] they knew about the guy how God is with
[36:57] was with Israel and when they told him I
[36:59] served a lot of the Lord of the Hebrews
[37:02] they were exceedingly afraid the Bible
[37:04] says then said they unto him what shall
[37:09] we do unto thee that the sea may
[37:11] be common to us for the Syrah and was
[37:13] tempestuous and he said unto them take
[37:17] me up and cast me forth into the sea so
[37:19] shall the sea be come unto you for I
[37:22] know that for my sake this great tempest
[37:24] is upon you to see Jonas knew the whole
[37:26] time
[37:27] he knows nevertheless I want you to see
[37:31] verse 13 nevertheless the man rode hard
[37:33] to bring it to the land but they could
[37:36] not for the sea rock and most impetuous
[37:39] against them these men had more grace
[37:42] than Jonah did they were trying to save
[37:45] Jonah they were trying to save Jonah
[37:49] before they would cast him into the sea
[37:51] so they had me had more they had more
[37:53] grace for Jonah than Jonah had for them
[37:56] and so in verse 14 wherefore they cried
[38:00] unto the Lord and said we beseech thee
[38:02] after they found out that they could not
[38:04] get to the land we beseech thee O Lord
[38:06] we beseech thee let us not perish for
[38:08] this man's life and so now these people
[38:10] are crying out to the Yahweh the Lord
[38:12] God the same God that Jonah the same God
[38:15] of the Hebrews they're crying out to the
[38:17] same Lord when in previous verses they
[38:20] were crying out to their gods but they
[38:21] decided their gods wasn't listening
[38:24] it's another cry out to the Lord and so
[38:27] Jonah all this has taken place
[38:29] Jonah's back slid but yet God is
[38:31] changing the situation to where people
[38:34] are knowing the true and living God and
[38:38] yet God is and yet Jonah's back slid but
[38:45] people are being saved in other words
[38:47] think about that your situation in your
[38:51] life no matter how negative it may seem
[38:52] it could be used for the positive right
[38:55] God has all of these things in control
[38:57] amen
[38:58] he knows every single detail and whether
[39:01] we understand it or not God has every
[39:04] detail in controlling man and so we see
[39:07] here that they took up Jonah and they
[39:10] cast him forth into the sea and the sea
[39:12] ceased from from her region so the storm
[39:14] stopped then demand then the man feared
[39:18] the Lord exceedingly and offered a
[39:21] sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows
[39:24] so without Jonah trying he made these
[39:29] man he made these man got saved and made
[39:34] the missionaries to Tarsus because I'm
[39:36] sure that boat was continuing to Tarsus
[39:40] out of all this chaos and Jonah's in the
[39:42] sea back slid in and and feeling all
[39:46] this guilt and all these things but yet
[39:47] God is working everything out where
[39:49] these men they recognize who the true
[39:52] Living God is because I'm gonna tell you
[39:54] these men when they get to Tarshish or
[39:56] wherever they get to they're gonna
[39:58] testify about what happened I mean I
[40:00] would I mean I just got saved from from
[40:04] a sinking storm in the middle of the
[40:07] Mediterranean Sea I was I'd be
[40:09] worshiping the Lord - and offering
[40:11] sacrifices my praise God and so
[40:18] continuing here in chapter 2 and says
[40:21] then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God
[40:23] out of the fishes actually verse 17 back
[40:26] on chapter 1 now the Lord had prepared a
[40:28] great fish to swallow up Jonah and we
[40:34] know that there's a there's a thing you
[40:35] know people would say well it was a
[40:37] whale where it was it was a fish - what
[40:39] it doesn't matter it just says that the
[40:41] Bible said that God prepared this fish
[40:43] that's how we worried about
[40:45] and God prepared this fish and he told
[40:48] the fish you know what fish you're going
[40:50] to you're gonna gave him like GPS
[40:54] coordinates you know and told him he
[40:55] said you're gonna come over here to this
[40:57] specific spot and in this part there's
[40:59] gonna be a man that's gonna fall down
[41:01] and as he's falling down you're gonna
[41:02] open up your mouth and you're gonna
[41:04] swallow him up
[41:05] don't don't chew on him just swallow him
[41:08] up and that's exactly what the fish did
[41:12] fish obeyed God more than Jonas did
[41:16] and you know one time uh what was it the
[41:20] the Prophet who with the donkey you know
[41:23] that donkey speak through the donkey
[41:25] they obeyed the God more than the
[41:27] Prophet did now as we're looking through
[41:31] this Jonah's life you just think about
[41:33] the things as gone in your life amen
[41:35] or maybe things that are going on right
[41:38] now you know what's happening in your
[41:41] life is their stubbornness of your life
[41:43] because let me tell you God is not gonna
[41:46] lose not one of his children and God is
[41:49] gonna fulfill his word no matter what
[41:51] and you can go through your stubborn
[41:55] situations in your life you can go
[41:57] through I'm not gonna do that I'm not
[41:58] gonna obey the Lord in this even though
[42:01] the Bible says so but God's gonna make
[42:03] sure that his word is going to be
[42:06] fulfilled by you and he's gonna be
[42:07] obeyed by you whether you like it or not
[42:10] but I know eventually it will you will
[42:12] end up liking it because I'd rather have
[42:15] his his grace amen
[42:17] then his judgment Amen because we see
[42:22] here that Jonas in Chapter two we're not
[42:24] gonna read the whole prayer but but in
[42:26] Jonas chapter two he prays to the Lord
[42:28] and he's confessing to the Lord and he's
[42:31] and he's saying he's saying and said I
[42:34] cried unto I cried unto the Lord I cried
[42:38] by reason of mine affliction unto the
[42:40] Lord and he heard me out of the belly of
[42:43] Hell cried I on to the her and thou
[42:45] heard it's my voice amen and we know
[42:48] brother Bama said that he was in a Jonah
[42:50] was in a in the belly of the well of the
[42:53] fish and when he looked at his left
[42:55] there was fish guts and when he looked
[42:57] at his right there was fish guts when he
[42:58] looked forward there was fish guts
[42:59] behind him fish guts
[43:01] everywhere was fish guts and I'm sure it
[43:02] was darkened and nasty in there and
[43:06] stunk what else are you supposed to do
[43:10] there was no place station to play in
[43:12] there certainly and he couldn't get on
[43:15] his cell phone there was no signal what
[43:18] else is there to do but pray me and you
[43:21] can read his prayer in your own time
[43:23] amen but just the kind of highlight he
[43:26] says here in verse five the waters
[43:29] he's verse four says then I said I am
[43:31] cast out of thy sight
[43:32] yea I will look again toward thy holy
[43:34] temple Amen and when we're in trouble on
[43:37] this our Saints you know the Holy Temple
[43:39] was Jerusalem at that time you know was
[43:41] the temple there in Jerusalem but what
[43:45] is our temple in this hour is Christ
[43:46] amen
[43:47] hey and and when we look to him amen
[43:50] no matter what we're going through
[43:52] Saints no matter how how the situation
[43:54] how bad the situation is just look to
[43:57] the Word of God we cannot wait that's
[43:59] the only place where we can get help
[44:00] from amen you know you can go to the
[44:02] psychologist you can go to the brother
[44:05] you can go to the sister but there's
[44:06] suddenly a limit that they can do amen
[44:09] but when I turn to Christ amen he's
[44:12] limitless amen
[44:14] there's no limit to him and there and
[44:16] there's always a solution provided by
[44:18] him amen it may not be right away
[44:20] sometimes may not be right away
[44:23] but God has a solution for each one of
[44:26] our problems amen verse 5 the waters can
[44:29] pass me about even to the soul you know
[44:32] say young people you know sometimes we
[44:35] let the waters are though of this life
[44:36] of this world compass' us even it
[44:39] affects our soul you know too much video
[44:44] gaming
[44:44] too much Facebook too much too much
[44:47] Instagram too much Twitter too much all
[44:50] of this you know all this eventually can
[44:51] affect your soul right now saying those
[44:54] things are bad within themselves they
[44:56] have their place
[44:57] but what are you feeding on where you
[45:00] spend in town more is it the real
[45:04] Facebook God's Word face that book amen
[45:09] or is it Facebook amen
[45:12] because I'm telling you you know a lot
[45:14] of people find themselves marriages have
[45:19] been destroyed because of this
[45:21] relationships have been destroyed
[45:23] because of this Amen but there is a
[45:25] there's a there's a there is a way that
[45:29] these things can be used for good amen
[45:31] but anything that you spend more time on
[45:34] than God amen is a god to me
[45:36] amen it can be hunting it can be
[45:39] Facebook and can be basketball it can be
[45:41] whatever it is you
[45:42] more time more than God it's it's your
[45:46] God amen
[45:49] the weeds were wrapped around Bob my
[45:52] head you know and you may be going
[45:53] through trials and situations and demons
[45:55] may be talking to you God doesn't love
[45:58] you you've extinct you extent you you
[46:01] you you there's no more grace for you in
[46:03] this hour a man if you're still a lot
[46:05] there's still grace for you you know
[46:08] just have to run to it
[46:10] amen praise God verse 9 but I will
[46:14] sacrifice unto thee with the voice of
[46:16] Thanksgiving a man I like that because
[46:19] Jonas is say even in the midst of his
[46:21] trouble he's thanking God and that's the
[46:24] best thing for us to do amen is thank
[46:26] the Lord when we're going through these
[46:28] trials and tribulations amen
[46:30] we don't know what to do just thank God
[46:32] amen I took one there was a brother in
[46:35] North Carolina one time that told me a
[46:37] young older brother and and I was young
[46:40] I'm younger the way younger than him and
[46:42] he was asked he was telling me he was
[46:44] like he's like my brother Lewis you know
[46:47] I get to a point now where I can't pray
[46:48] I don't know what to say when I pray
[46:50] like what he's like yeah I don't know
[46:53] what to say I said wood don't have to
[46:56] say anything just start thanking God
[46:58] just start worshiping God start praising
[47:01] God and then when you get into that
[47:03] atmosphere or that mode of worship
[47:04] eventually things will start flowing
[47:06] amen I mean that's what happens with me
[47:09] things with God this the Holy Spirit
[47:11] will speak and start speaking through
[47:13] you he meant praise the Lord amen and I
[47:18] will pay that that I have bowed
[47:20] salvation is of the Lord so out of out
[47:24] of Jonas's stubbornness this is what he
[47:26] comes to he comes to realize that it's
[47:30] not about me and it's not about it's not
[47:33] about me it's not what I desire is not
[47:35] what I want it's about him amen
[47:38] and he's gonna have his because the
[47:40] Bible says in first Corinthians 7 23 you
[47:42] are bought with a price and you're not
[47:45] your own amen but you are bought with a
[47:47] price
[47:47] your life belongs to God praise the Lord
[47:52] so when you're out dilly-dallying with
[47:54] the things of the world and the things
[47:55] that
[47:56] they are not helping you spiritually
[48:00] you're doing your own thing you're
[48:04] forgetting that you are bought with a
[48:05] price
[48:07] spiritual adultery on God amen in the
[48:13] Lord watch verse 10 and the Lord spake
[48:15] unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah
[48:18] upon the dry land so there is a way out
[48:22] of the problems you know I always say
[48:26] problems have a beginning and they have
[48:28] an end problems are not eternal no
[48:31] matter what it is because they have a
[48:33] beginning and they have an end and so
[48:35] when God sees you that your attitude is
[48:37] right your heart is right Jonah's heart
[48:39] we see here that is right now right he's
[48:41] he's he's right and asked the Lord to
[48:44] forgive him and all these things and
[48:46] when God sees that you are in that's in
[48:50] that in that you might be coming out of
[48:52] your trial
[48:53] little by little or sometimes you can
[48:54] just come out right away Jonas came out
[48:57] right away
[48:59] vomited just like that out of the fish
[49:02] and what would you say when you were
[49:04] letting when you land on the shore I
[49:07] mean what would you do if you if you've
[49:09] landed on the shore and you got fish
[49:10] guts all around you you smell like fish
[49:14] you may look like a fish I don't know
[49:17] what are you supposed to do amen
[49:23] so chapter 3 Jonah
[49:26] the Bible says 2 - Jonah says and the
[49:29] word of the Lord came unto Jonah the
[49:30] second time and I like that baby because
[49:34] we know that God is a God of second
[49:35] chances amen
[49:36] and I'd just second chances but third
[49:38] chances fourth chances fifth chances you
[49:41] know Peter asked that's Jesus he says
[49:43] Lord how many times am I gonna forgive
[49:44] my brother is it seventy times and he
[49:48] said no i say unto you seventy times
[49:50] seven
[49:50] oh you mean four hundred it was at four
[49:53] hundred forty nine times okay four
[49:56] hundred and forty-nine times then so
[49:58] when I get to four hundred forty eight
[50:00] and brother Dale transcript brother Dale
[50:02] 448 you better be careful four hundred
[50:07] forty nine is coming you better not do
[50:08] it
[50:09] is that what the Lord met the Lord
[50:13] unlimited now not amount of times he
[50:16] maybe I'm in wouldn't you want to be
[50:18] forgiven I'm limited amount of times I
[50:19] mean you know God does have punishment I
[50:25] mean the Bible says that those that are
[50:27] his he's not going to let him get away
[50:29] if they're his you know if you're my
[50:31] child you know when I'm in Walmart or
[50:34] wherever I ain't punish somebody else's
[50:37] child when they're out in the floor
[50:38] crying and and and screaming and and and
[50:42] hitting their parents I I can't I can't
[50:44] punish them because they're why they're
[50:45] not my children but if my child was
[50:48] doing that I could punish them for that
[50:50] right because they're my child and if
[50:53] you're not feeling just like Jonah you
[50:54] know he was thinking he was getting away
[50:56] with all of this mmm sometimes the Lord
[50:59] just let you go for a little while so
[51:01] that you can suffer the consequences of
[51:03] it later amen
[51:06] verse 2 is in in verse 2 and chapter 3
[51:10] says arise going to Nineveh that great
[51:12] city and preach it didn't preach unto it
[51:15] the preaching that I bid thee I will see
[51:18] a little bit more sternness in the
[51:20] Lord's voice here now preach what I
[51:23] print out what I bid thee to preach so
[51:26] Jonah arose and went on to Nineveh
[51:28] according to the word of the Lord now
[51:32] Nineveh was an exceeding great city of
[51:34] three days journey now I want the
[51:36] brothers to see if they could pull up
[51:37] this the the graphic that I sent to them
[51:42] they don't mind and while they're doing
[51:45] that if they could pull the the the
[51:51] other one they have the other one
[51:57] now here's gaffer right here this is
[52:02] where Jonah was or was where he's from
[52:07] Joppa is right here this is the mission
[52:12] Nineveh it's about 500 miles from there
[52:17] but he decides he wants to go to
[52:19] Tarshish all the way up into Spain
[52:21] that's where Tarsus is it's about 2,500
[52:26] miles and that's what we do sometimes
[52:29] we'd rather take the long road then take
[52:31] this the short road they meant to do
[52:33] good to do to do what God tells us to do
[52:35] oh I'd know I'd rather do it this way
[52:38] you know because I think it's just
[52:40] better Oh fine go ahead the Lord says
[52:44] but right here somewhere in here that's
[52:47] where that's where he gets caught up in
[52:48] the storm now so there's Nineveh right
[52:52] there and you remember how we were
[52:56] talking about how corrupt Nineveh was
[53:00] and uh and so this thing that even
[53:06] though Jonah had repented and he had he
[53:09] had gone through this situation that
[53:10] he's gone through even though he had
[53:12] repented he still had this this fright
[53:14] for to go to go to us you know and he
[53:18] had this thing because later on we'll
[53:20] see we'll see why and Jonah began in
[53:22] verse 4 in chapter 3 verse 4 and Jonah
[53:25] began to enter into the city a day's
[53:27] journey and he cried and said yet forty
[53:30] days and Nineveh shall be overthrown and
[53:33] that's all he told them that's all the
[53:36] message that he had for them was 40
[53:39] repent because in 40 days your cities
[53:41] gonna be overthrown didn't say anything
[53:45] else to them 40 days you better repent
[53:48] or else the city will be overthrown and
[53:50] he steps out from the city after
[53:52] preaching he steps out from the city and
[53:54] we'll just read that in chapter four he
[53:55] steps out and sits not in the east part
[53:58] of the city and sits down to wait to see
[54:01] him so the Lord can destroy the city and
[54:03] isn't that how sometimes we wait you
[54:06] know for the people you know when they
[54:07] do wrong but well can't wait to see that
[54:10] destruction from the Lord okay wait for
[54:12] God to punish them oh my I'm gonna sit
[54:15] here with my crunch bar in my popcorn
[54:17] and I'm gonna have me a good time
[54:19] that's what later on Jonah does he's
[54:22] waiting for the destruction of the city
[54:24] to take place and the Bible says that
[54:27] the city they hear they don't hear Jonah
[54:30] but they hear Jonah but they hear they
[54:32] hear what they hear what God had to say
[54:34] through Jonah and they immediately from
[54:37] the king to the rest of the people they
[54:39] put on sackcloth they start repenting
[54:41] they start they start saying the the
[54:45] stop stop feeding the cows and stop
[54:47] feeding the chickens stop feeding your
[54:49] dogs put on sackcloth not just for the
[54:52] human people but also for the even the
[54:54] animals were to put on sackcloth the
[54:57] bankers stopped banking the teachers
[54:59] stopped teaching everybody stopped
[55:03] because we wanted to see if this if we
[55:05] can appease the the grace of God amen
[55:08] we can appease the Lord and the Bible
[55:11] says that they repent and in chapter
[55:15] four chapter 4 says but it displeased
[55:21] Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry
[55:24] and he prayed unto the Lord and said I
[55:28] pray thee O Lord was nothing was not
[55:31] this my saying when I was yet in my
[55:33] country therefore I fled before unto
[55:38] Tarsus so he's given us the reason why
[55:40] he fled on to Tarshish because I knew
[55:44] that thou art a gracious God and
[55:46] merciful slow to anger and of great
[55:49] kindness amen
[55:52] thank God and the people of Nineveh this
[55:55] is what they experienced so in verse 3
[55:59] he says therefore now O Lord take I
[56:01] beseech thee my life from me for it is
[56:03] better for me to die than to live now
[56:05] John is acting like a little baby you
[56:07] know you know when you have when you
[56:09] have your your your child and he's
[56:12] screaming and hollering and saying I
[56:14] want it I want it and you know you can't
[56:16] have it but why you know and that's what
[56:20] Jonas is doing screaming and crying
[56:23] like a little child and this is a god
[56:26] called man
[56:29] the prophet of the Lord
[56:32] and I wonder sometimes you know we're
[56:34] caught God called people amen but that
[56:37] we love the people out here Amanda
[56:39] the same way we love the people in
[56:40] church you know just as I said earlier
[56:46] you know the prostitute out here the
[56:48] drunkard they need God just as much as
[56:50] we as you and me did I said well we
[56:53] blast those denominations and we say we
[56:55] you know and forgetting that you came
[56:59] out of one yourself at least I mean I
[57:02] did some of us may have come out from
[57:05] straight from the street you know but
[57:07] God saved each and every one of us Amen
[57:09] sinners saved by grace amen praise God
[57:16] then said the Lord do us that well to be
[57:19] angry in other words are is it okay for
[57:22] you to be angry so Jonah went out of the
[57:24] city and sat on the east side of the
[57:26] city and there made him a booth and
[57:29] senator said under it in the shadow till
[57:31] he might see what would become of the
[57:33] city he was so sure that God was just
[57:35] gonna destroy this city just I'm just
[57:38] positive I mean he's set there probably
[57:40] he got front-row seats you know just to
[57:43] watch the whole show not knowing that
[57:45] inside the city the people were doing
[57:47] what he had where he was requesting what
[57:50] he had and so Jonah I can imagine I'm
[57:53] just thinking you know John is probably
[57:54] mad because he has to go back to Israel
[57:57] and probably tell the people in Israel
[57:59] they never repented and people Israel
[58:03] hated the Ninevites what if what would
[58:06] that make him look like you know his
[58:08] pride you know
[58:09] sometimes our pride you know gets but
[58:12] gets the best of us amen
[58:16] and the Lord God prepared a gourd and
[58:19] made it to come up over Jonah that it
[58:21] might be a shadow over his head to
[58:24] deliver him from his grief I'm just
[58:28] thinking you know the Lord probably
[58:29] prepared this gourd this tree or this
[58:32] load there's something to kind of calm
[58:35] him down a little bit
[58:37] give him some shade you know take away
[58:40] this is this anger this thing they that
[58:43] he's gonna but he's got a lesson for him
[58:45] as well amen
[58:47] so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd
[58:49] oh we're so happy when the blessings of
[58:51] the Lord come
[58:52] oh my you know and and everything's
[58:55] going alright you know the world is
[58:56] dying but you know we're blessed you
[58:58] know
[58:58] oh my we're not you know I have food in
[59:01] my house I have I have money in the bank
[59:04] I have everything's going fine but the
[59:06] world can can go to hell but I'm blessed
[59:10] I have food and everything's okay you
[59:12] know and we're supposed to be gracious
[59:16] people we're supposed to be people full
[59:19] of grace amen Saints but God prepared a
[59:25] worm when the morning rose the next day
[59:28] and it smoked the gourd that it withered
[59:31] and it came to pass when the Sun did
[59:33] arise that God prepared a vehement east
[59:36] wind so here's God preparing all this
[59:38] the whole time and the Sun beat upon the
[59:41] head of Jonah that he fainted and wished
[59:45] in himself to die and said it is better
[59:48] for me to die than to live my goodness I
[59:55] mean what would you think of this man
[59:57] yeah if you were dealing with him you're
[1:00:01] a god dealing with this man what would
[1:00:03] you do for the weights but yet God still
[1:00:16] shows his mercy and grace to give us
[1:00:19] this I mean if I'm not mistaken I mean I
[1:00:22] believe was Joe names that wrote this
[1:00:24] I'm not sure exactly I would have been
[1:00:27] Jonah I believe he learned a lesson for
[1:00:32] him to write amen and God said to Jonah
[1:00:35] doest thou well to be angry for the
[1:00:37] gourd and he said I do well to be angry
[1:00:40] even unto death
[1:00:41] that's the reply that he gives to God
[1:00:43] yeah I am angry so take it take it or
[1:00:48] leave it
[1:00:49] you know kind of like cane the way he
[1:00:50] responded to God take it or leave it
[1:00:54] Lord then said the Lord thou has had
[1:00:58] pity on on the gourd for the which thou
[1:01:02] has not laboured neither made us to grow
[1:01:04] which came up in the night in Paris
[1:01:08] tonight
[1:01:09] so God telling Jonah look I could do
[1:01:11] whatever I want I do whatever I want to
[1:01:15] I could take you out if I wanted to and
[1:01:18] you're here whining like a baby and and
[1:01:21] and and saying why is it that I forgave
[1:01:24] the people is didn't you do what I asked
[1:01:27] you to do and I told and and and they
[1:01:30] did what I wanted them to do so
[1:01:33] therefore what else could I do
[1:01:37] it's trying to tell Jonah they repented
[1:01:41] verse 11 is should not our spared and
[1:01:44] innovate that great city wherein are
[1:01:46] more than six score thousand persons
[1:01:48] that cannot discern between their right
[1:01:49] hand and their left hand and also much
[1:01:52] cattle so God can do whatever he wants
[1:01:55] to Saints amen
[1:01:57] so that's what he's trying to show Jonah
[1:01:59] and you know what Saints just wondering
[1:02:02] you know if if we don't have that type
[1:02:05] of attitude Amen sometimes right you
[1:02:08] know and God is trying to god is trying
[1:02:10] to let us know like well such as such
[1:02:14] you know such and such sister or such
[1:02:16] and such brother you know they might
[1:02:17] come into church and and they may be
[1:02:19] here for a while and there's something
[1:02:21] that you may be doing right but they
[1:02:23] might not be doing right and but but men
[1:02:25] of the Lord is dealing with people amen
[1:02:27] can't you just show grace to them let
[1:02:31] the Holy Spirit work in their lives amen
[1:02:33] let the Lord do the work in in people's
[1:02:35] lives amen because when the Lord does
[1:02:37] those types of work when the Lord does
[1:02:39] the work the Lord the work will be done
[1:02:41] right but when you try to do the work
[1:02:43] it's gonna it's gonna fall to pieces
[1:02:46] when Jonah tried to do his own thing
[1:02:49] amen it all fell to pieces the boat
[1:02:51] almost sank people around him almost
[1:02:53] died a storm came he ended up in the
[1:02:57] whales belly when you try to do your own
[1:03:01] thing
[1:03:01] when you try to bring your own word
[1:03:03] forth amen
[1:03:05] be careful not you may not do more harm
[1:03:07] than than you think you're doing good
[1:03:09] amen sometimes you know as the prodigal
[1:03:12] son the prodigal son when we read the
[1:03:14] Bible about the prodigal son the father
[1:03:17] he'd just let him go he said look okay
[1:03:20] here's the inheritance just go he never
[1:03:22] stopped him once but he was the Bible
[1:03:26] says that he was looking for him
[1:03:27] everything every day it was there at the
[1:03:29] door at the door waiting for him
[1:03:31] people probably tell me you know what
[1:03:33] your son's not coming back what are you
[1:03:34] talking you might say that but I know he
[1:03:37] is he's my child I know him I know her
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:43] it's been 40 days he's coming he's
[1:03:48] coming she's coming
[1:03:50] your child amen your child may may may
[1:03:54] may be out in the world and been out in
[1:03:56] the world 10 15 20 30 40 50 years what
[1:03:59] doesn't matter I prayed for him I've
[1:04:04] prayed for her I'm claiming them amen
[1:04:07] I'm claiming her amen
[1:04:08] God's gonna bring him amen and it won't
[1:04:11] be me but I'll be right here waiting
[1:04:13] I'll be right here waiting for him amen
[1:04:15] and that's what the that's what the
[1:04:18] father did and eventually the the just
[1:04:23] like Jonah the the prodigal son he got
[1:04:26] into mischievious things you know went
[1:04:31] out and spent his money and bought
[1:04:34] expensive probably bought all kinds of
[1:04:37] expensive basketball shoes and bought
[1:04:41] all kinds of all kinds of things and he
[1:04:44] said to the people one time in the bar
[1:04:46] and all his friends he's like look all
[1:04:48] the beer for its it's all on me he
[1:04:54] thought that he had unlimited amount on
[1:04:55] his card one day he goes to charge it
[1:05:00] out in a nightclub and you come come
[1:05:04] back and come back denied look at your
[1:05:08] card is being denied what I know I got I
[1:05:11] have more than that it's key charges it
[1:05:14] again
[1:05:15] comes back tonight look you're gonna
[1:05:18] have to pay or some way somehow for
[1:05:20] these things you know that you you you
[1:05:22] got your own DJ in here and you got your
[1:05:24] own you're gonna have to pay up well
[1:05:27] that's that's the only card I have well
[1:05:29] I'm sorry then go work then you go labor
[1:05:32] with pigs then that's the way you're
[1:05:34] gonna have to pay us then so that's
[1:05:38] where he ended up but he learned his
[1:05:39] lesson the Bible says that he came to
[1:05:42] himself and when he came to himself amen
[1:05:46] the the father wasn't on the cell phone
[1:05:48] calling him you know talking to him you
[1:05:50] know and and all that late son when are
[1:05:52] you gonna come to church son when are
[1:05:54] you gonna do this some are you gonna do
[1:05:56] that the father was just praying for him
[1:05:59] and eventually the father a man the
[1:06:02] Bible says he came to himself and he
[1:06:04] came up walking up to the road and he
[1:06:06] said look the servants have but there
[1:06:09] lived better than I do
[1:06:10] walking up the road and the father there
[1:06:13] waiting for him and he and before he
[1:06:17] even came before he even got to the
[1:06:19] father the father had already his arms
[1:06:20] around him hugging him and telling him
[1:06:24] in telling him son you've come back I
[1:06:27] knew you would I knew you would and the
[1:06:32] he the son get ready to to tell him
[1:06:35] Father forgive me and the father says
[1:06:38] don't worry about that he looks back and
[1:06:41] he says calls out to his servants bring
[1:06:43] me the robe bring me a ring bring me
[1:06:46] shoes bring me this because my father
[1:06:48] was my son was lost but now he's found
[1:06:51] was blind but now you can see Amen
[1:06:56] that's the grace of God Saints so how
[1:07:01] many of us have experienced the grace of
[1:07:02] God in our in our lives they men how
[1:07:08] many are still experiencing the grace of
[1:07:09] God amen
[1:07:12] as I said I certainly needed a man I
[1:07:15] need the grace of the Lord amen
[1:07:17] you know I told you all our this year
[1:07:20] something happened to me that that out
[1:07:24] in the sea you know that uh
[1:07:26] I just bought lost my life if it wasn't
[1:07:29] for the grace of God middle of the there
[1:07:33] you know knocking the just trying to
[1:07:35] have a good time
[1:07:36] but being stubborn my wife telling me
[1:07:39] you be careful be careful those waves
[1:07:41] are kind of hot they feel good they're
[1:07:43] slapping on my back and it feels great
[1:07:45] you know and then see you know and then
[1:07:50] that undercurrent you know it just takes
[1:07:52] you and then there's nothing you can do
[1:07:53] you feel vulnerable you can imagine how
[1:07:55] Jonah feel felt I mean the reason why
[1:07:58] you know that the fish is but the the
[1:08:01] well the fish's belly where he was then
[1:08:03] that was that was his his his rescue
[1:08:06] right there you know he was safer in
[1:08:08] there and then he was out you know and
[1:08:10] and some song while I was out there and
[1:08:14] current pulling me and I'm sitting there
[1:08:16] screaming for help and nobody can hear
[1:08:18] me
[1:08:19] nobody can hear me because it was hardly
[1:08:21] anybody there on the shore and my wife
[1:08:23] she's fur but she saw that something was
[1:08:26] wrong and at that moment she says lord
[1:08:28] help him and I'm sitting there thinking
[1:08:30] is this how I'm gonna go Lord is this
[1:08:33] how I'm gonna die in the middle of
[1:08:35] Alabama in Alabama I'm not even in
[1:08:39] Georgia I'll die in Alabama in the ocean
[1:08:42] somewhere but God provides the fish for
[1:08:48] me God provided the vehicle for me amen
[1:08:52] right some way or another there was a
[1:08:54] wave that just popped right in and just
[1:08:56] pushed me right in I don't know how it
[1:08:58] happened I was able to grab with my feet
[1:09:00] amen on the shore and was able to walk
[1:09:03] out amen
[1:09:04] I know each and every one of us have had
[1:09:07] close calls in our life some way or
[1:09:10] another how is it Lord that I got
[1:09:12] through that if it wasn't for the grace
[1:09:15] of God because there's something there's
[1:09:18] something for you and me that we're not
[1:09:20] done completing here on this life you're
[1:09:22] here because God is not done with you
[1:09:25] it's not to make money although that's
[1:09:28] part of you know you have to live you
[1:09:29] have to live alright it's not because
[1:09:33] you have to have girlfriends
[1:09:34] you know boyfriends you know like you
[1:09:37] know God has a purpose for you God has a
[1:09:41] purpose for each and every one of us
[1:09:43] amen and it wasn't for his grace amen
[1:09:49] praise God brother Brown says here in
[1:09:53] that message man running from the
[1:09:55] presence of the Lord he says oh how many
[1:09:58] denominational ships have we got going
[1:10:01] down to Tarshish for the Jonah's of
[1:10:03] these days 900 of them something our
[1:10:06] ships
[1:10:07] I believe there's more of that now
[1:10:09] there's many more now something our
[1:10:12] ships that takes the easy route don't
[1:10:15] want to face up to it
[1:10:16] Jonah they didn't want to face up the
[1:10:19] thing of going to the Gentiles he didn't
[1:10:21] want to take that cruel message over
[1:10:22] there within 40 days you'll perish if
[1:10:25] you don't repent he hated to do that I
[1:10:29] mean you know but God likes to get us
[1:10:34] out of our comfort zone because you know
[1:10:37] he wants to teach us lessons and he
[1:10:41] thought them Gentiles is hard to tell
[1:10:43] what what they'll do to me but he had to
[1:10:45] face up to see it see but he took an
[1:10:49] easy ship and went down to Tarshish went
[1:10:52] down in the whole of the ship and went
[1:10:54] to sleep
[1:10:54] took the easy route that's not sometimes
[1:10:58] we do we just take the easy route you
[1:11:00] know we'd rather instead of going 500
[1:11:01] miles we'd rather go 2,500 miles to
[1:11:03] Tarshish and like I said Satan will
[1:11:06] provide the vehicle for it too you know
[1:11:08] you know it's an easy way it's a popular
[1:11:13] way with the people it's easy to take
[1:11:15] the way where everybody can pat you on
[1:11:17] the back and say you're a good fellow
[1:11:18] and this is so and so uncertain and the
[1:11:21] world will look upon you it's easy to go
[1:11:24] to the popular way am i it's easy you
[1:11:27] know it it would be easy for for
[1:11:30] ministers to get up here by the dáil and
[1:11:32] by the way to get up here and just
[1:11:33] preach you know easy sermons God loves
[1:11:36] you and God cares about you and he does
[1:11:39] but when that word goes forth
[1:11:43] can you take it taking criticism amen
[1:11:48] but that's part of it that's part of
[1:11:49] doing God's will they meant hey no man
[1:11:53] that has ever done God's will was not
[1:11:56] ever criticized or ever talked about
[1:11:59] every one of them even Jesus so you
[1:12:04] might as well accept the fact that when
[1:12:06] you serve the Lord you're going to get
[1:12:08] criticized when you're trying to when
[1:12:10] you try to do something for God
[1:12:12] somebody's going to criticize you when
[1:12:15] you're trying to young people's young
[1:12:18] girls you're trying to wear your long
[1:12:19] skirts and you wear your hair the way
[1:12:22] the Lord says in the word to do it some
[1:12:24] there's somebody out there gonna
[1:12:25] criticize you there's gonna be there's
[1:12:28] gonna be people that look at the way she
[1:12:30] wears her hair it's gonna be criticism
[1:12:35] boys don't wear shorts you're gonna get
[1:12:40] criticized you're gonna get criticized
[1:12:45] but when you have and this is so and so
[1:12:49] uncertain the world will look upon you
[1:12:51] it's easy to go to the popular way but
[1:12:52] when when you have to do something
[1:12:54] different when you have to stand to your
[1:12:56] conviction of what you know to be the
[1:12:58] truth there's where the hard part that's
[1:13:01] that's the rub comes right there amen
[1:13:04] praise God are you willing to take the
[1:13:09] the hard route or the either are you
[1:13:12] willing to take God's Way have it your
[1:13:14] way or the Lord's way amen I want to
[1:13:19] have it God's Way and I know that if I'm
[1:13:23] a child and daughter or God amen even if
[1:13:24] I have to go through if I get off course
[1:13:27] God said okay that's fine
[1:13:30] I'm gonna teach you a lesson out of this
[1:13:32] and other people are gonna be affected
[1:13:35] by it as well amen don't don't you know
[1:13:40] sometimes God you know the Lord allows
[1:13:44] that those things in our in our lives
[1:13:45] and maybe there's no just no other way
[1:13:47] to learn lessons in life you know but to
[1:13:51] go those hard routes but God knows our
[1:13:55] beginning from there and
[1:13:56] and he has he has everything already
[1:13:59] prepared prepared amen and nothing takes
[1:14:02] God by surprise that's the thing nothing
[1:14:05] takes God by surprise you know you being
[1:14:07] here
[1:14:08] and you going through whatever you're
[1:14:10] going through whatever's happened in
[1:14:12] your life you know God didn't say oh my
[1:14:14] goodness why is that happening to him
[1:14:16] that's not what I it's not what I saw
[1:14:18] no God saw that exactly but God knows
[1:14:22] that there's a solution for it as well
[1:14:24] I'm thankful for that amen
[1:14:26] so no matter what your problem is Saints
[1:14:28] no matter what's going on in your life
[1:14:30] Amen let's just trust in God let's put
[1:14:33] it over to him and let's just be
[1:14:35] thankful during the times amen once
[1:14:37] trials and tribulations are in our midst
[1:14:39] amen
[1:14:40] just like Jonah man he was in the fish's
[1:14:42] belly nowhere else to turn nowhere else
[1:14:45] to go no one to call no one to go but
[1:14:49] look up amen to look up amen and and to
[1:14:53] seek Him amen that's the time to seek
[1:14:55] Him
[1:14:56] a lot of people think when problems are
[1:14:58] coming in their life and bad things are
[1:14:59] happening in their life well that that
[1:15:01] means God doesn't love me God God's not
[1:15:04] worried about my situation and they feel
[1:15:06] that that is the excuse for them to just
[1:15:08] stop serving the Lord that's the time
[1:15:13] for you to draw closer to God amen
[1:15:16] because they meant something is
[1:15:18] something as God is doing something I
[1:15:20] always ask myself you know situations
[1:15:23] and whatever it is I meant I always say
[1:15:25] Lord what are you trying to teach me in
[1:15:27] this in this situation what are you
[1:15:30] trying to teach me Amen what what is it
[1:15:32] that you're that I'm not getting that's
[1:15:34] that's the hidden under part we see the
[1:15:36] superficial part death sickness disease
[1:15:41] problems you know sexual problems
[1:15:44] whatever the issues may be but Lord what
[1:15:47] is it that you're trying to do
[1:15:48] underneath that's what I want to know
[1:15:50] Lord that's that's my desire and I
[1:15:54] trusted that is your desire to know any
[1:15:57] man those guys so let's cling on to the
