[32:51] you order know them anyway god bless
[32:57] y'all good to be here in the house of
[32:59] the Lord so much is happening I'm sorry
[33:02] I've missed the last couple of meetings
[33:03] but I was out of peanut butter but we
[33:08] bought a big old bucket of it so the
[33:11] message means more to me now than it
[33:12] ever has in my whole life
[33:15] we're living in a world where people are
[33:17] looking for proof of what's right or not
[33:19] you know so they seek it on the Internet
[33:22] you know just recently you could always
[33:24] look up on Snopes and that would be a
[33:27] website to tell you what the truth of
[33:29] the matter was well brother Homer they
[33:31] got arrested for lying if you know we we
[33:38] are in a world where there's a lot of
[33:39] versions now of the Bible there's lots
[33:42] of if you if you wanna I told someone
[33:46] will brother Brian and prayed for
[33:48] someone and you know that they could see
[33:50] again he says well watch this and he
[33:52] showed me on a website or a man was
[33:54] walking on the water you know in a pool
[33:56] and so because of modern technology you
[33:59] can see all sorts of things and so if
[34:03] you're looking for proof of whether
[34:04] something is right or not it depends
[34:08] where you found what you found I was
[34:13] shown the message of the hour by people
[34:16] by the life of the message living in
[34:19] them I was shown the message the hour
[34:22] when I was sick and they said God heals
[34:24] and I got healed it was proven to me by
[34:28] what happened to me and I don't think
[34:32] you can ever find out if something's
[34:34] right or wrong online I think it'll be
[34:37] between you and the good Lord if that's
[34:40] where you got it from and I just
[34:42] encourage everybody you know I
[34:45] I I saw I got comforted when I had a son
[34:48] who died I've got I got I got carried
[34:51] when my mom died by by believers
[34:54] I witnessed people come together when my
[34:59] daughter was was sick I felt it I I
[35:04] asked them in Cambodia why do you
[35:06] believe the message of the hour this
[35:08] what we felt the anointing of God when
[35:10] we heard the word preached I I asked
[35:14] them in Chile why do you believe the
[35:16] message of the hour they said we saw God
[35:18] in a people and I see God in a people in
[35:22] the incredible strength of truth is
[35:25] something that will not go away in it
[35:28] the truth can't be disproved I I just
[35:32] love this with all my heart and just it
[35:34] will carry us through and it will show
[35:37] us everything we need to know speaking
[35:40] of the Holy Bible message the hour I
[35:43] believe the Bible is our absolute I
[35:45] believe the prophets have the revelation
[35:48] to that absolute and I believe that's
[35:51] absolutely the truth and you know I saw
[35:55] you know people lose a wife and continue
[35:57] on I remember one time when my daughter
[36:02] come home from the hospital and she
[36:03] probably get so embarrassed you know I
[36:05] was mentioning but we we we couldn't
[36:08] help her and she was getting worse and
[36:10] worse after all the work of that
[36:11] hospital
[36:12] I witnessed Christ come in people and
[36:17] this little family come over and they
[36:19] just took over the care of my daughter
[36:21] and right in front of me
[36:23] showed me what to do and they just loved
[36:27] her right back into into health I saw
[36:31] that you can't take away something that
[36:33] someone is witnessed
[36:36] and if we love the Lord with all our
[36:38] heart he promises he'll be in the midst
[36:40] of our worship he promises where two or
[36:43] three are gathered together he'll be
[36:45] there he promises he will never leave us
[36:47] nor forsake us
[36:48] he promises Aussie will be with us even
[36:51] unto the end of the consummation this
[36:55] message of life is true because it lives
[36:59] in me and I continually witness it in
[37:02] others and it will carry you it as great
[37:06] get back up power it as it has great
[37:10] reconciliation power don't be foolish
[37:13] enough to disclude some of our people
[37:15] because they are no longer believe in
[37:18] don't worry God will take care of that
[37:20] he knew the end from the beginning you
[37:22] know it you know he even spoke about the
[37:25] sparrow he had a sermon about the ant
[37:28] people take care of everything in it
[37:30] it's been a wonderful wonderful time and
[37:33] I just I see less of Tom crochet now
[37:37] brother homer than I guess twenty years
[37:39] ago
[37:40] and maybe a little bit more of the Lord
[37:42] and I love them with all my heart I'm
[37:45] still seeing when the word goes out it
[37:48] just needs to be landowner on a seat of
[37:51] God and if the seat of God hears that
[37:53] word it'll do what it's what the Bible
[37:55] promises that we're doing and you know
[37:58] there are some people on this earth that
[37:59] can hear no other voice but the voice of
[38:02] God jesus said my sheep hear my voice
[38:04] and another they won't hear you know and
[38:08] I I'm getting to feel so sad for those
[38:10] that can't hear the voice I'm not angry
[38:13] at them I I wish some of my family could
[38:16] see this I would I would walk to

[1:07:58] know and because I know God's I know
[1:08:01] their hurt you know and you lose your
[1:08:03] mom and dad at the same time you know

[1:08:10] certainly want to remember them amen in
[1:08:13] our prayers and then just good and but I
[1:08:16] do want to add something what brother
[1:08:17] Dale said now the reason we want you to
[1:08:21] get out of here and we get out of here
[1:08:23] is because the sisters has to clean up
[1:08:26] after we leave and they need to come to
[1:08:28] church tomorrow and they're waving at me
[1:08:31] so that's one of the things I said now
[1:08:35] well we're driving down the road dry
[1:08:37] you're cleaning up hello and so so
[1:08:42] anyhow that's why we want to help them
[1:08:45] too right I mean they got feelings you
[1:08:48] know you know and so after they prepare
[1:08:51] it and then they've got to feed you and
[1:08:53] and then they you know and then they
[1:08:54] clean up while we go home full stomach
[1:08:57] amen so uh amen I appreciate -
[1:09:01] appreciate that brother tom has got to
[1:09:03] fellowship meeting in May
[1:09:04] you know God willing if we
[1:09:07] - that long and and you know and I was
[1:09:10] thinking about something my brother
[1:09:11] Billy Paul said one time and they they
[1:09:15] asked him he said do you understand all
[1:09:19] that's in the Bible he said no I don't
[1:09:22] understand he said the thing it bothers
[1:09:24] me is the part that I do that I don't
[1:09:27] see in my life that I don't see in my
[1:09:32] life that support it bothers me
[1:09:36] all the message you know they don't
[1:09:38] bother I've heard it I've read my Bible
[1:09:40] through and through and through and
[1:09:41] through and through but deported bothers
[1:09:43] me is how much of it is being identified
[1:09:47] because you see you know as brother
[1:09:50] better said the church is gonna be in
[1:09:52] the minority and he keeps saying you
[1:09:55] know it's getting smaller and smaller
[1:09:56] and smaller this because you know you
[1:09:59] know my little my little grandson
[1:10:03] great-grandson and Herman saying you had
[1:10:06] some mini and so I'm just getting them
[1:10:08] by the droves I mean they just come in
[1:10:12] like you know like you know whatever and
[1:10:15] and so my little grandson the other day
[1:10:18] he says he walking around the house and
[1:10:21] he said I just need the Holy Ghost he's
[1:10:27] two years old
[1:10:30] and I said son what did you say he said
[1:10:34] Papa we just need the whole ego so his
[1:10:38] daddy come in and he said daddy we need
[1:10:40] the Holy Ghost he said what is it where
[1:10:44] you get it at he said you got to go to
[1:10:46] church and I thought if I ever was a
[1:10:52] true saying if there ever was a need is
[1:10:55] the Holy Ghost I mean a real birth amen
[1:10:59] not not just to baptism a real birth a
[1:11:02] birth of this word in this hour amen the
[1:11:06] word actually changes our life actually
[1:11:08] it's not just looking up here and saying
[1:11:10] brother Branham said amen it's something
[1:11:12] amen it actually changes you amen and
[1:11:15] actually you know this satisfies you no
[1:11:18] matter what amen and so it's something
[1:11:22] that keeps us when you can't keep
[1:11:24] yourself amen and what you don't even
[1:11:27] want to keep yourself
[1:11:28] amen it keeps you it's an anchor amen
[1:11:31] amen and thank God that he sent this in
[1:11:34] this hour but if he had never sent the
[1:11:36] Holy Ghost amen we could hear the
[1:11:38] Prophet 24/7 you know never understood
[1:11:40] or you never got ahold of it but because
[1:11:43] of the Holy Ghost that we could receive
[1:11:45] the spiritual revelation of the word of
[1:11:47] God for the hour that you said Amen that
[1:11:49] he's sin so so by God's grace amen I
[1:11:53] appreciated my grandson coming up Ernie
[1:11:55] said I don't want to look at cartoons he
[1:11:56] don't want to look or if he wants to
[1:11:58] hear gospel music they meant and so I
[1:12:01] said I won't ever stay at my house no
[1:12:04] amen so somebody told me said get you a

[1:19:16] read the scripture says examine yourself
[1:19:18] see whether you're in the faith or not I
[1:19:21] titled the message
[1:19:23] examining yourself the computer industry
[1:19:29] pull that message of the Internet
[1:19:38] they had to put it back home because
[1:19:40] they found out they pulled it wrong but
[1:19:44] all it was was just taking a wording
[1:19:46] that a fly throws up see what I'm saying
[1:19:50] that's how close they are they broke in
[1:19:55] this church here 40 years 40 years ago

[1:20:01] in here and told the Turks I said

[1:20:09] don't you think you're hiding or what
[1:20:11] you're doing you're out in the open if

[1:20:20] to do something just cause real flesh

[1:23:32] amen and only the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:23:36] has that 20/20 spiritual supernatural
[1:23:39] vision to be able to see the word in
[1:23:42] this day the bride is naturally
[1:23:45] spiritual and normally supernatural a
[1:23:48] true believer of this message has a
[1:23:51] divine purpose in their life they have
[1:23:54] supernatural intelligence intelligence
[1:23:57] that cannot be seen by the FBI or the
[1:24:00] CIA or the NSA or the Mossad or all the
[1:24:03] intelligence agencies of the world that
[1:24:06] spend billions and billions searching
[1:24:09] for intelligence on other governments
[1:24:11] and yet Jesus Christ was able through a
[1:24:15] humble prophet and be able to come in
[1:24:18] and confound the entire world because he
[1:24:22] had a bride that he had to impregnate
[1:24:24] with that supernatural seed to believe
[1:24:27] this word and I'm so happy to be here so
[1:24:31] happy - brother Sam invited me to come I
[1:24:34] called them up and told them I was
[1:24:35] coming last month and gonna visit some
[1:24:38] churches so he asked me to come for the
[1:24:40] fellowship meeting
[1:24:43] I bumped it on and so I've been in North
[1:24:48] Carolina and South Carolina then I flew
[1:24:50] home and came back and I always loved
[1:24:54] southern hospitality I was born in the
[1:24:57] north just outside of Boston and didn't
[1:25:00] get civilized so I came down south when
[1:25:04] I was a kid I used to pack the car in
[1:25:06] Harvard Square and take a shower every
[1:25:08] hour and when I came down South had
[1:25:11] learned talked all over again and when I
[1:25:13] heard people say y'all I said oh god
[1:25:16] never let me say that word and three
[1:25:18] months later I see y'all coming and it's
[1:25:23] so wonderful to be here and to look at
[1:25:25] so many familiar faces and so much
[1:25:28] history that I have with so many people
[1:25:31] in the audience I was glad to hear
[1:25:34] brother Wes thing today and brother
[1:25:36] Bisco sends his greetings and sister
[1:25:38] Bissell and all the saints in Cloverdale
[1:25:41] and i don't know how many people told me
[1:25:43] to greet brother Wes and I could tell
[1:25:47] you a lot of stories about brother Wes
[1:25:50] maybe I'll tell you one real quick first
[1:25:53] time I come to Cloverdale we're at a
[1:25:54] special meeting and in brother Wes he he
[1:25:58] saw me and he had a little a little it
[1:26:00] looked like an egg and he said hey
[1:26:01] brother and he catch and he threw this
[1:26:03] rubber egg and I was expecting a thing
[1:26:05] to explode all over me but it was a
[1:26:07] rubber egg and he thought that was funny
[1:26:09] so then after the meeting we're getting
[1:26:13] ready to go over to have dinners about
[1:26:14] 15 people waiting for dinner and so
[1:26:17] brother Wes comes over he's a brother
[1:26:18] and he I want to show you something he's
[1:26:20] 12 years old now I said yeah what he got
[1:26:22] with he said I got these handcuffs I
[1:26:24] said yeah he said I want to slap him on
[1:26:27] you so I said alright brother Wes go
[1:26:29] ahead he slapped them on me they were
[1:26:33] real genuine police handcuffs and then
[1:26:37] he sat back and a big old smile he says
[1:26:39] no key
[1:26:43] and it was true there was no key and for
[1:26:48] hour-and-a-half they had to search all
[1:26:50] around the houses and garage looking for
[1:26:53] that key and brother West's dad brother
[1:26:56] Ken he saw what happened and brother Wes
[1:26:59] he got some posterior stimulation and I
[1:27:06] can tell you a whole bunch more but I
[1:27:08] won't I'm just so glad at what God has
[1:27:10] done in West's life and and see his
[1:27:13] family and to hear them saying and it's
[1:27:17] just so great to be among real believers
[1:27:20] and knowing that we came from the mind
[1:27:23] of God we're going back to the mind of
[1:27:26] God and I just want to start by opening
[1:27:29] the Word of God today and I'd like to
[1:27:32] invite you to the book of Acts and
[1:27:34] chapter 9 and we're going to start
[1:27:38] reading at verse 1 and before we read
[1:27:43] let's let's pray father words sometimes
[1:27:53] seem so inadequate to be able to thank
[1:27:56] you that you have passed by billions and
[1:27:59] billions of people who are living on the
[1:28:02] earth now and the billions who have
[1:28:04] lived and died since a prophet of God
[1:28:06] has come and yet Lord you have looked
[1:28:10] down upon us and you have seen fit
[1:28:13] before the foundation of the world to
[1:28:15] call us your children and to reveal to
[1:28:19] us this great and mysterious and
[1:28:21] glorious supernatural message Lord
[1:28:23] you've taken us from insanity to reality
[1:28:27] to deity Lord and to know that we're
[1:28:31] deity and it's such a humbling
[1:28:32] experience father lord I pray that you
[1:28:35] would take the word today and only you
[1:28:37] can make this word live in the hearts
[1:28:40] and minds of of your children father you
[1:28:43] know you have a purpose for this meeting
[1:28:45] lord I pray that all all flesh would get
[1:28:49] out of the way and that only the Holy
[1:28:50] Ghost would be seen and heard and have
[1:28:53] its desired impact
[1:28:55] on our lives today we ask all these
[1:28:58] blessings and your precious name of our
[1:29:00] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:29:02] in Acts chapter 9 and verse 1 and Saul
[1:29:15] breathing out threatenings and slaughter
[1:29:20] against the disciples of the Lord went
[1:29:23] unto the high priest and desired of him
[1:29:26] letters to Damascus to the synagogue's
[1:29:29] if he found any of this way whether they
[1:29:32] were men or women he might bring them
[1:29:35] bound unto Jerusalem so let's have our
[1:29:38] seats there I just want to start with
[1:29:40] with just a couple of scriptures I know
[1:29:43] you've been standing for a while and if
[1:29:45] we can just go back just a little bit
[1:29:47] when Stephen was preaching about Jesus
[1:29:52] Christ and Stephen was a deacon and he
[1:29:55] was preaching a very powerful message he
[1:29:57] was blasting the religious leaders for
[1:29:59] what they had done to Jesus Christ and
[1:30:02] identified them as Messiah and and
[1:30:05] finally they were so outraged and they
[1:30:08] were so beside themselves that they look
[1:30:10] for somebody that could give them
[1:30:12] authority to stone Stephen and here's
[1:30:15] Saul a young man he's standing there and
[1:30:18] Saul consented to their death he said
[1:30:20] you get the rocks
[1:30:21] I'll hold the coats and they stoned
[1:30:23] Stephen and in the last word Stephen
[1:30:26] said he said I saw the Lord standing at
[1:30:29] the right hand of God I believe that the
[1:30:31] Lord stood to receive Stephen as Azzam
[1:30:34] as a martyr and and and now when Saul he
[1:30:38] was a religious fanatic his family were
[1:30:42] wealthy people and he could have gone
[1:30:44] into the business world but there was
[1:30:46] something inside of him that he wanted
[1:30:48] to serve God and by his own admission he
[1:30:51] was he was religious he was if anybody
[1:30:55] fasted Paul fasted more if anybody
[1:30:58] studied Paul did more if they prayed
[1:31:00] Paul did more he excel everybody around
[1:31:03] him and and so now all of this time Saul
[1:31:08] has got a
[1:31:08] zyre wants to serve God and then this
[1:31:11] this situation with Stephen comes up in
[1:31:13] the Sanhedrin Council
[1:31:15] they say Saul we're looking for a guy
[1:31:17] like you we've got a big problem here
[1:31:19] we've got these people called Christians
[1:31:22] these these vermin you know I could use
[1:31:25] a lot of other words you know I could
[1:31:28] use the word cockroaches because that's
[1:31:30] the way the Pharisees thought about the
[1:31:32] Christians and we need an exterminator
[1:31:35] we need somebody to rid Jerusalem and
[1:31:39] rid all of our land from these people
[1:31:41] they are heretics
[1:31:42] they are blaspheming and they are
[1:31:44] causing a nuisance and we've heard about
[1:31:46] you and we need you we need will empower
[1:31:50] you we will fund your ministry
[1:31:52] whatever you need you need man you need
[1:31:54] horses whatever you need you just go and
[1:31:57] do whatever it takes
[1:31:58] lock them up beat them whip them kill
[1:32:01] them whatever it takes you can imagine
[1:32:05] Saul's mind now so I knew all that
[1:32:08] praying was gonna pay off someday I knew
[1:32:11] all that fasting and now look at me
[1:32:15] Sanhedrin Council World Council of
[1:32:19] Churches needs me they got a job for me
[1:32:22] to do an important job and he went after
[1:32:26] his job with enthusiasm he was like a
[1:32:30] pit bull dog on a meat wagon he was like
[1:32:33] a heat-seeking missile like a laser beam
[1:32:36] and he did everything that he could now
[1:32:40] remember these people that Paul went
[1:32:42] after these were Holy Ghost filled
[1:32:46] freshly minted Holy Ghost filled
[1:32:49] Christians men women and children and
[1:32:53] Saul and his men I mean you know that
[1:32:57] they were dog they were lower than dogs
[1:32:59] and they didn't care if they beat him
[1:33:01] and they whipped them and they threw him
[1:33:02] into prison and Saul I mean he was he
[1:33:06] felt justified he was proud of what he
[1:33:09] was doing and one day you know here is
[1:33:12] and he's right maybe riding on his big
[1:33:14] steed and the Lord said okay Saul you
[1:33:18] and I've got an appointment and he comes
[1:33:20] let's read a little further
[1:33:22] and so any desired letters to damascus
[1:33:28] to the synagogues that even found any in
[1:33:30] this way whether they were men or women
[1:33:32] he might bring them bound to Jerusalem
[1:33:34] and as he journeyed he came near
[1:33:36] Damascus and suddenly there shine around
[1:33:39] him a light from heaven and he fell to
[1:33:41] the earth and heard a voice saying unto
[1:33:43] Him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me
[1:33:48] now brother Branham said Saul being the
[1:33:52] kind of a Pharisee that he was he never
[1:33:55] would have said what he said here unless
[1:33:58] he knew what he was saying and he said
[1:34:01] who art thou Lord Saul knew that was the
[1:34:05] pillar of fire that had knocked him off
[1:34:07] his horse and now Saul said who art thou
[1:34:10] who are you that has just intercepted my
[1:34:13] life and knocked me down to the ground
[1:34:15] and the Lord said I am Jesus whom now
[1:34:20] persecute us and Jesus said this very
[1:34:23] succinctly he said it's hard to kick
[1:34:26] against the pricks isn't it you know
[1:34:28] people who are backslidden and want to
[1:34:30] serve the world for a while it's hard to
[1:34:33] kick against the pricks because of your
[1:34:35] true Son of God you're gonna come some
[1:34:38] way if God has to knock you over the
[1:34:40] head or a car accident or a sickness or
[1:34:42] whatever it is you're gonna come and so
[1:34:45] come easy you know come home come home
[1:34:47] quickly brother Branham said when he was
[1:34:50] here it was three minutes to midnight I
[1:34:52] wonder how many seconds to midnight it
[1:34:54] may be right now and so he said it's
[1:34:57] hard to kick against the pricks and he
[1:34:59] trembling and astonished said Lord what
[1:35:02] wilt thou have me to do
[1:35:05] so Paul Najee this is an emergency this
[1:35:07] is a 900 situation Paul says what do you
[1:35:10] want me to do
[1:35:12] shucks he said Jesus Jesus just knocked
[1:35:16] me off my horse the Messiah the one that
[1:35:19] they are saying was Messiah and it was
[1:35:22] true and he said unto Him arise go into
[1:35:27] the city and it shall be told thee what
[1:35:30] thou must do and the men which journey
[1:35:32] with him stood speechless and he
[1:35:34] boys but seeing no man and Saul arose
[1:35:37] from the earth and when his eyes were
[1:35:39] opened he was blind I think his eyes
[1:35:43] were open he saw no man he was blind but
[1:35:47] they led him by the hand and brought him
[1:35:49] into Damascus and he was there three
[1:35:51] days without sight
[1:35:52] my brother branham said do you like to
[1:35:55] read between the lines is the sweetest
[1:35:57] truths or between the lines and when you
[1:36:00] think now here's Saul you know he was
[1:36:02] knocked off that big old horse now he's
[1:36:05] blind maybe he's had to hold onto the
[1:36:07] bridle of the saddle and the men lead
[1:36:09] him into a room and he's got a
[1:36:11] predestinated place to go and spend
[1:36:13] three days and he did not eat or drink
[1:36:19] Saul he was he was in a crisis situation
[1:36:24] and there was a certain disciple at
[1:36:28] Damascus named Ananias and to him said
[1:36:31] the Lord in a vision Ananias and he said
[1:36:33] Behold I am here Lord I wonder why
[1:36:36] people have trouble believing that God
[1:36:38] speaks to people through angels and
[1:36:40] visions they have to they have to just
[1:36:42] disavow the supernatural essence of the
[1:36:45] Bible and so he said he said I am here
[1:36:48] and he said unto Him arise and go unto
[1:36:52] the street which is called a straight
[1:36:53] and inquire in the house of Judas for
[1:36:56] one call Saul of Tarsus before behold he
[1:37:00] praedyth if anybody in the world was
[1:37:03] praying Saul was praying but but but
[1:37:07] Ananias he said in a scene a vision of a
[1:37:10] man Ananias coming in and putting his
[1:37:12] hand on him that he might receive his
[1:37:14] sight now Ananias right away you know
[1:37:17] it's
[1:37:18] he's an emergency situation he said Lord
[1:37:21] you know just paraphrase he said lord I
[1:37:24] have heard about that man he is a
[1:37:26] dangerous man and now you want me to go
[1:37:30] in and go to see him the Lord said don't
[1:37:33] worry he's fryin and he says he said he
[1:37:37] says I have heard many of this man how
[1:37:40] much evil he had done to thy Saints in
[1:37:43] Jerusalem and here he had Authority now
[1:37:46] Ananias is reminding
[1:37:48] Lord what he knows about this guy he has
[1:37:50] authority from the chief priests to bind
[1:37:52] all that call on his name but the Lord
[1:37:55] said unto him go thy way for he is a
[1:37:57] chosen vessel unto me to bear my name
[1:38:00] before the Gentiles and kings and the
[1:38:02] children of Israel for I will show him
[1:38:04] how great things he must suffer for my
[1:38:07] name's sake
[1:38:08] I believe maybe the Lord just showed him
[1:38:10] a little bit I believe if the Lord
[1:38:13] showed saw all that he was going to have
[1:38:15] to suffer he would have fainted he would
[1:38:18] have not even wanted to start that race
[1:38:20] so he said I must show him the things he
[1:38:24] must suffer for my name say and Ananias
[1:38:27] went away and entered into the house and
[1:38:28] putting his hands on him said with a
[1:38:32] koppel love to this man that was cursed
[1:38:37] you know but by all the Jews in that
[1:38:39] area for what he had done with a koppel
[1:38:43] love he says brother Saul the Lord even
[1:38:47] Jesus had appeared unto thee in the way
[1:38:49] as how camus hath sent me that thou
[1:38:53] mightest received thy sight and be
[1:38:55] filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:38:56] immediately fell from his eyes that had
[1:38:58] been scales and he received sight for
[1:39:00] with and arose and was baptized and when
[1:39:03] he received me he was strengthened then
[1:39:06] was Saul certain days with the disciples
[1:39:08] would for at Damascus now this is where
[1:39:10] I want to speak a little bit I want you
[1:39:12] to take and put yourself just try to be
[1:39:15] a fly on the wall when Saul this man who
[1:39:19] has just experienced one of the greatest
[1:39:21] paradigm shifts in the history of the
[1:39:24] world now a paradigm shift the
[1:39:26] definition of a paradigm shift is a
[1:39:29] radical change of thought brought about
[1:39:32] by a very unusual situation or a keen
[1:39:37] insight into a matter and Paul he had a
[1:39:41] great paradigm shift it was a radical
[1:39:44] change of thought a revolutionary truth
[1:39:47] had come into his life and now he goes
[1:39:51] among the Apostles the ones that he had
[1:39:53] persecuted now Saul he's still the same
[1:39:57] radical religious man he still got that
[1:40:01] same
[1:40:01] passion that same burning desire for God
[1:40:04] but now he has been rerouted now he sees
[1:40:08] the error of his ways now he goes among
[1:40:12] the Apostles the disciples that had been
[1:40:14] with Jesus the same one that had knocked
[1:40:16] him off his horse and now he goes down
[1:40:19] among them and they don't trust him they
[1:40:22] they they they don't want to they don't
[1:40:23] want to have anything to do with it they
[1:40:25] thought it was a trap they thought it
[1:40:27] was a trick and the Romans and the Jews
[1:40:29] were going to get all them together in
[1:40:31] one place and just take him and arrest
[1:40:33] them now the Jews when they heard what
[1:40:36] Saul was doing they said put a hit team
[1:40:39] out on that guy we got to take that guy
[1:40:41] out he's a traitor and so now here's
[1:40:45] Saul and he's going among the disciples
[1:40:47] and he's trying to talk to them and he
[1:40:49] can see they're hesitant he can see the
[1:40:51] fear amongst them he said what's the
[1:40:53] wrong with you I thought you believed in
[1:40:56] Jesus don't you believe in justification
[1:40:59] I've been justified don't you believe in
[1:41:03] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:41:05] Holy Ghost that's me it's happened to me
[1:41:08] I'm one of you my life has been changed
[1:41:11] I'm not the man that I used to be and so
[1:41:16] he goes and he tries to preach in the
[1:41:18] synagogue's he but it doesn't work
[1:41:21] doesn't work and the Apostles finally
[1:41:24] said hey you know you you need to go
[1:41:27] away and they sent him away and he goes
[1:41:30] to Arabia goes to the desert God loves
[1:41:34] to send his men to deserts like he sent
[1:41:38] Moses he sent Joseph to prison he put
[1:41:41] Daniel in the lion's den he puts all in
[1:41:44] prison had Peter in prison but God knows
[1:41:47] what he's doing whenever he puts us
[1:41:49] through a trial whenever he puts us
[1:41:51] through a test for a true believer it is
[1:41:53] a predestinated test no trial no
[1:41:57] sickness can get to you before it goes
[1:42:01] through God God has to approve that
[1:42:03] before it comes to you and with that
[1:42:06] kind of confidence no matter what we go
[1:42:09] through testing trial challenge whatever
[1:42:13] it is if
[1:42:14] we've got the right attitude if we've
[1:42:16] got the right perspective on life
[1:42:18] there's nothing that's going to be able
[1:42:21] to stop us
[1:42:22] it's like brother Homer said there's
[1:42:24] something in us that keeps driving us
[1:42:26] we're unstoppable
[1:42:28] we're unmovable we're unbreakable when I
[1:42:31] first came into the message I was
[1:42:33] excited I was excited when I got saved
[1:42:35] in a Baptist Church you know one thing I
[1:42:38] want to say about the Baptist the
[1:42:40] Baptist they don't have any problem
[1:42:42] praying for the sick as long as they
[1:42:47] don't get well they and so I was the
[1:42:50] best little Baptist that you could be
[1:42:52] and then I went from the Baptist to the
[1:42:54] Assembly of God you want to talk about
[1:42:56] excited filled with the Holy Ghost now
[1:42:58] and somebody priests Ephesians six to me
[1:43:01] about the principalities and the powers
[1:43:03] and the rulers an evil spirit I said you
[1:43:05] mean there's a war going on a spiritual
[1:43:07] warfare they're after me and I've got
[1:43:09] weapons I've got the weapons of my
[1:43:11] warfare I've got the helmet of salvation
[1:43:13] breastplate of righteous loins Girt
[1:43:15] about and so it changed my life it made
[1:43:18] me a warrior then I went away to Bible
[1:43:20] School then to the United Pentecostal
[1:43:22] church commonly referred to as the
[1:43:28] underprivileged children and so now I
[1:43:32] get excited the more I go the more light
[1:43:35] that I see the more excited that I get
[1:43:37] and then I come to the message now I'm
[1:43:41] intoxicated at a level I cannot even
[1:43:43] begin to experience and I go to the
[1:43:47] first message church and they were
[1:43:52] living in the Land of Nod the preacher
[1:43:54] said something I'm standing I'm sitting
[1:43:59] on the front row you can ask brother Wes
[1:44:01] I have never sat anywhere except the
[1:44:05] front row the front row in it I want to
[1:44:08] be at the spot where the glory comes out
[1:44:10] I don't want anybody getting my blessing
[1:44:13] and now we got young people in the
[1:44:16] church and I got to get there a half
[1:44:18] hour early for my seat it's a challenge
[1:44:21] for these guys they come there and they
[1:44:22] take their Bible and they park it on my
[1:44:25] seat eight years old ten
[1:44:27] years I got brother nice eat and they
[1:44:30] laughed the thing they think is good so
[1:44:32] I just take their Bible and I put it
[1:44:34] behind my back and I move over to my
[1:44:35] seat and they come back there look for
[1:44:37] where's my Bible I said hey here you go
[1:44:40] brother so now we got a we got a whole
[1:44:42] new army of people that want to be at
[1:44:44] the front row and so now when I was at
[1:44:47] that first church excited and they were
[1:44:49] saying well you know he's just excited
[1:44:51] just got all that enthused he says he's
[1:44:54] kind of like one of those norman vincent
[1:44:55] peale kind of guy you know he'll cool
[1:44:58] off after a while well I never cooled
[1:45:00] off I mean listen this message this
[1:45:04] message is the only thing in the world
[1:45:06] that sounds like it's too good to be
[1:45:08] true and yet we cannot even plumb the
[1:45:11] depths of how good it is what God has
[1:45:14] done for us brother Branham said when
[1:45:16] the bride fully realizes who she is then
[1:45:20] we'll be gone it's it has to be a
[1:45:23] crickety I believe there has to be
[1:45:25] another super quickening for us to
[1:45:28] become that super church that super race
[1:45:32] of people realizing that we've got God's
[1:45:34] DNA inside of us God's genetic code
[1:45:37] inside of us we got that royal blood
[1:45:40] drawn from Emmanuel's veins inside of us
[1:45:43] it's it's it's a blood that can defeat
[1:45:46] any enemy brother branham's at any time
[1:45:49] you can defeat the devil any time in any
[1:45:51] situation all you got to do is stand you
[1:45:55] know if I stand the devil can't make me
[1:45:57] raise my devil can't make me do anything
[1:46:00] people say the devil made me do no devil
[1:46:02] never made you do brother Bram said the
[1:46:05] devil never got on your ground you were
[1:46:07] not good on his ground and that's where
[1:46:10] we get into the problem areas in our
[1:46:12] life so Saul now he's doing everything
[1:46:15] he can to convince the disciples of the
[1:46:18] reality of his conversion how
[1:46:21] frustrating that must have been for a
[1:46:24] man with his desire and the potentials
[1:46:27] that he had inside of him and the
[1:46:29] disciples supposed to have supernatural
[1:46:32] insight and discernment they couldn't
[1:46:36] know this can't be true you know I mean
[1:46:38] he know Jesus is good
[1:46:41] the Gospels good the Holy Ghost is good
[1:46:43] but him him no no way not him not after
[1:46:48] what he's done do you think that didn't
[1:46:52] that didn't stay with Saul all of his
[1:46:54] life how he had cast down memory cast
[1:46:58] down imagination cast down cast down
[1:47:01] everything that he had previously done
[1:47:04] all that he had been a part of so now he
[1:47:08] goes to Arabia and it's give you a
[1:47:09] little illustration I'll get a chair so
[1:47:12] Saul you go he goes to Arabia and he
[1:47:14] sits down mmm and it takes all the
[1:47:17] scrolls and he starts reading you know
[1:47:20] that 714 prophecies of Messiah in the
[1:47:24] Old Testament and being a man like Saul
[1:47:27] you had to have the whole Torah
[1:47:28] memorized so Saul goes in there and he
[1:47:31] starts reading and maybe while he was in
[1:47:34] that room maybe Jesus walked around in
[1:47:37] his brain but he was wounded for our
[1:47:39] transgressions bruised for our iniquity
[1:47:41] chastisement of his peace upon us by His
[1:47:44] stripes we're so now salt for three
[1:47:46] years sits there it's real oh god what
[1:47:53] are you gonna use me and finally after
[1:47:54] three years Barnabas and him they get
[1:47:56] hooked up and at this time there is a
[1:47:59] problem they have in real serious issue
[1:48:02] when who's that for a minute brother
[1:48:03] says there's real serious issues in
[1:48:05] Jerusalem and Saul he gathers up
[1:48:07] resources and brings them to Jerusalem
[1:48:10] he wants to be a blessing and he's
[1:48:12] received in the beginning everybody was
[1:48:14] happy to see him but then they found out
[1:48:16] do you know who that guy is the one
[1:48:20] who's coming in here pretending to be a
[1:48:22] Good Samaritan
[1:48:24] that's all that's that's the guy that we
[1:48:28] hired to wipe out these Christians now
[1:48:31] the Jews they get a garis they get a
[1:48:33] squadron of soldiers to get them and and
[1:48:37] the Christians they don't know what to
[1:48:39] make of him they still are not convinced
[1:48:41] but he keeps preaching keeps preaching
[1:48:44] keeps preaching now while he's preaching
[1:48:47] the Jews are so enraged and the
[1:48:49] believers are so and they don't
[1:48:52] what to do so there's a riot taking
[1:48:54] place and so that Centurion comes down
[1:48:57] looks out there what's going on and they
[1:49:00] see seasons it's out of control so he
[1:49:02] has his guys grab Saul and he puts him
[1:49:05] into a place he said what's going on so
[1:49:07] everyone says this one one says that one
[1:49:10] so finally he takes him into a safe
[1:49:13] place and that the Jews come and we need
[1:49:16] that guy that guys are black you don't
[1:49:18] know the problem that you know he ever
[1:49:20] he ever heard the word ringleader in the
[1:49:23] Bible or Saul they said he's the
[1:49:25] ringleader he's the ringleader of this
[1:49:27] sect of the Nazarenes causing chaos in
[1:49:32] all of our synagogue and we want peace
[1:49:35] we want peace in the province and this
[1:49:38] man he needs to be dealt with and we
[1:49:41] need to deal with him and so now he
[1:49:43] keeps him he keeps him away and then
[1:49:46] Saul when he gets a chance let me speak
[1:49:48] to him again and Saul gets up there and
[1:49:50] he wants to bless them again now they're
[1:49:53] so angry the end result is 40 men took a
[1:49:58] vowel we're not gonna eat we're not
[1:50:00] gonna drink until that man is dead
[1:50:04] wonder what happened those guys brother
[1:50:06] Sam and so now there's a truck they set
[1:50:12] a trap now and they come in they said
[1:50:15] well you know we want to speak to that
[1:50:18] fella not anything bad we just want to
[1:50:21] speak you know things about himself and
[1:50:23] the things about what he believes
[1:50:25] meanwhile they got they got the whole
[1:50:28] squadron of all these these Jews or
[1:50:31] laying weight ready to trap him and
[1:50:35] Saul's sisters son Saul's nephew he
[1:50:40] hears about this plot so he goes to see
[1:50:43] the Centurion and and they let us didn't
[1:50:46] let him see him the centauri Amir's him
[1:50:48] he verifies it's true and then Saul he
[1:50:53] gets an escort two hundred soldiers
[1:50:56] threescore and ten a horseman and then a
[1:51:01] whole bunch of spearmen I think
[1:51:03] altogether those that I know is over 500
[1:51:05] maybe over
[1:51:05] six-hundred escort that Saul got on the
[1:51:10] road to protect him from the ploy
[1:51:12] God knows how to protect his own so now
[1:51:17] Saul he gets there and yes he has a lot
[1:51:21] of great experiences he's gotten Liberty
[1:51:25] he's gotten freedom he has won the
[1:51:27] people over they see his nature they see
[1:51:29] his character and so everything is you
[1:51:32] know he's still imprisoned but
[1:51:34] everything is going you know kind of
[1:51:37] okay and then he has to get on a boat
[1:51:40] and he goes on the boat and the boat it
[1:51:44] comes into an incredible storm a
[1:51:47] horrible storm and and these men the
[1:51:50] sailors that they're fasting 14 days
[1:51:53] brother Tom they never had a bite of
[1:51:55] food and they're just trying they're
[1:51:58] doing everything they can throw in cargo
[1:52:00] overboard and Saul brother Bram talks
[1:52:03] about him down in the belly of the ship
[1:52:06] he said is his hands and his arms all
[1:52:09] callous from the chains that that had
[1:52:12] that it held there's this holy prophet
[1:52:14] and the angel of the Lord appears to
[1:52:17] Saul he says Saul all will be well no
[1:52:22] life will be lost
[1:52:26] 276 Souls
[1:52:28] on that boat Saul says he goes up there
[1:52:31] he says no souls will be lost but the
[1:52:35] ships gone she ain't gonna make it
[1:52:37] well how do you know all these thing he
[1:52:39] said the God that I serve had appeared
[1:52:42] to me and he has assured me that all
[1:52:44] will be well but the soldiers they were
[1:52:47] not ready to believe it and they're
[1:52:49] still throwing stuff overboard and
[1:52:50] finally it comes to a point where
[1:52:53] they've got to take drastic action they
[1:52:55] threw out the anchors and they finally
[1:52:56] decide to go in and ditch the boat in
[1:52:58] this little play but before they do one
[1:53:01] of the soldiers say hey we can't let
[1:53:03] these prisoners live
[1:53:04] what if they escape we got to kill them
[1:53:07] all but the Centurion wanting to spare
[1:53:09] Saul he said no no no no just let
[1:53:13] everybody on their own let everybody go
[1:53:14] for themself so here they all go and
[1:53:17] it's hard
[1:53:19] whilst or when they got the shore that
[1:53:20] didn't mean the storm stopped it was
[1:53:22] still raining it was still cold
[1:53:24] these guys are soaked to the bone and
[1:53:27] they find out these people in Malita and
[1:53:30] their brother the Bible said their
[1:53:32] barbarous people heathens raw pagans and
[1:53:36] yet they that they they offer no small
[1:53:40] kindness to all these people who were
[1:53:43] shipwrecked so Saul he's building a fire
[1:53:46] and he picks up a log putting the log on
[1:53:48] the fire and and a beast of viperous
[1:53:51] beast comes and fastens on the Saul's
[1:53:54] hand and he shook it off all these
[1:53:58] people says he's got to be a murderer
[1:54:01] you know Karma's got this guy now and
[1:54:04] they sat there looking at him waiting
[1:54:07] for him to die and they said after they
[1:54:10] sat there and waited for him for a long
[1:54:13] time to die and he didn't die then they
[1:54:16] said well he's not a murderer he's a god
[1:54:19] and they wanted to make a god out of
[1:54:21] Saul so now they have the chief one of
[1:54:24] the chief people on the island their
[1:54:27] publicity and he's got a home and they
[1:54:30] go there and he's got a sick father and
[1:54:32] saw praise for him and he's healed and
[1:54:35] then all the people who were sick they
[1:54:37] all came and saw heal all of them so now
[1:54:42] acts end but now we can turn to the book
[1:54:44] of second Corinthians
[1:54:50] what a man saw was you know I was
[1:54:53] telling brother Sam yesterday and this
[1:54:55] would be this would be an alert for all
[1:54:58] of us coming out in May you know the
[1:55:03] world thinks that Israel was formed in
[1:55:05] 1948 we know it's 46 May the seventh the
[1:55:10] same time the angel of the Lord was
[1:55:12] walking into that cave to meet brother
[1:55:14] Branham he said look on the pan-american
[1:55:16] clock same moment David ben-gurion is
[1:55:19] signing Israel in as a nation the angel
[1:55:21] of the Lord comes to brother but the
[1:55:23] world they think it's 48 because that's
[1:55:25] when they recognize Israel so now 70
[1:55:28] years from 48 is 2018
[1:55:31] may 2018 and they have prepared a movie
[1:55:37] the Vatican only the second time in
[1:55:40] their history they have ever co-opted
[1:55:42] with Hollywood people to produce a movie
[1:55:45] the movie is going to be called Francis
[1:55:48] a man of his word they're going on I've
[1:55:53] seen little clip it's from a little
[1:55:55] trailers they go all around the world on
[1:55:58] all of his excursion showing the
[1:56:00] hundreds of thousands of people him and
[1:56:03] his popemobile all decked out to the
[1:56:05] nines they show him washing the feet of
[1:56:07] the homeless people they show him in the
[1:56:09] prison they show him praying for the
[1:56:11] little deformed babies you want to talk
[1:56:14] about the world getting shocked by
[1:56:16] believing this man is a Superman it's
[1:56:20] all preparing the way friends for the
[1:56:23] Beast the false prophet is going to
[1:56:26] become the bee when he gets kicked you
[1:56:28] know he doesn't leave heaven or wherever
[1:56:30] he is he doesn't leave that place
[1:56:32] willingly he gets booted out and when he
[1:56:35] gets booted out we get raptured in and
[1:56:39] when he comes down he needs a body that
[1:56:42] going to and he finds the body of the
[1:56:44] false prophet and he becomes the beast
[1:56:46] you know brother Branham said the
[1:56:49] Catholic Church is the highest form of
[1:56:50] spiritualism there is on the face of the
[1:56:52] earth I was there for nine years in
[1:56:55] Catholic school seven years as an altar
[1:56:57] boy people have no ideas of the depth
[1:57:00] and the wickedness and the deception
[1:57:03] of that devil and how he's got billions
[1:57:05] of people around the world thinking he's
[1:57:08] a holy man so now when he comes down to
[1:57:11] earth he is angry what he goes in the
[1:57:14] body of that false prophet becomes a
[1:57:16] beat he's angry why is he angry
[1:57:18] the bride is escaped she's gone but I'm
[1:57:22] gonna get I'm gonna get those foolish
[1:57:24] virgins and I'm gonna get those 144,000
[1:57:27] now I'm gonna get mode I'm gonna get
[1:57:28] Elijah well you're talking about a you
[1:57:30] want to talk about a beast on a mission
[1:57:32] he is a beast on a mission and he
[1:57:35] fulfills his mission he gets all the
[1:57:38] foolish virgins he gets a hundred
[1:57:40] forty-four thousand he gets Moses and
[1:57:42] Elijah and the world finally somebody
[1:57:46] has brought some hope a glimmer of hope
[1:57:49] to bring things back to way they used to
[1:57:52] be some semblance of normalcy and that's
[1:57:57] when it's all over for him and we come
[1:57:59] back from that wedding supper and we
[1:58:01] come back and the thousand-year
[1:58:03] millennium reign friends all these signs
[1:58:07] that we're seeing you know we have
[1:58:08] tomorrow's headlines today when
[1:58:11] something happens we just look at it we
[1:58:14] see huh brother Branham said that here
[1:58:16] that's fulfillment of prophecy well and
[1:58:18] I'll tell you friend this movie is not
[1:58:20] only going to be a boost for the
[1:58:23] Catholic Church but the religious world
[1:58:26] as a whole people who are just you know
[1:58:29] lukewarm president you know you know
[1:58:31] what a Presbyterian or a Methodist or
[1:58:33] Lutheran is there's just Catholics that
[1:58:36] flunk Latin that's all they did they
[1:58:41] never got the Hail Mary they never got
[1:58:44] the rosary in the novenas and they never
[1:58:47] got the scapular they never got all the
[1:58:49] details and brother Browns are the only
[1:58:51] thing to figure out is communion and
[1:58:53] they'll figure that they're gonna figure
[1:58:56] it out and last year last year the year
[1:58:58] before Kenneth Copeland you know it's
[1:59:00] all over the Reformation is over we are
[1:59:03] now one friends we are the ones upon
[1:59:10] whom the ends of the earth have come to
[1:59:15] you know we have an awesome
[1:59:17] responsibility I heard many of the
[1:59:19] brothers talk about how blessed we are
[1:59:21] but Tom said it for how blessed we are
[1:59:24] but you know we also have a
[1:59:25] responsibility the definition of
[1:59:28] responsibility is response ability or
[1:59:32] having the ability to respond and the
[1:59:36] question is do we have God's response
[1:59:39] ability are we responding to the word
[1:59:42] that has been sent brother Branham says
[1:59:44] I wonder and anybody when he said it at
[1:59:47] smoke he said I wonder if we are
[1:59:49] sufficiently impressed with what God has
[1:59:53] done
[1:59:54] amongst us in this day are we just
[1:59:58] coasting lukewarm just you know well you
[2:00:01] know friends this is not the time this
[2:00:03] is the midnight hour this is the
[2:00:05] homestretch for the bride of Jesus
[2:00:07] Christ if you are ever going to pray now
[2:00:11] is the time to pray if you're ever going
[2:00:13] to witness and hold the token over your
[2:00:16] family now is the time to hold it over
[2:00:19] your family I was listening last night I
[2:00:21] was listening about the watchman and God
[2:00:24] spoke to Ezekiel he said now Ezekiel he
[2:00:27] said if you go and you warn the people
[2:00:29] and they don't listen then their blood
[2:00:31] is not on you but if you don't go and
[2:00:35] you don't tell them if their bloods on
[2:00:38] you friends I know and then when I wake
[2:00:42] up in the morning one of the first
[2:00:44] thoughts I have as I go about my day and
[2:00:47] I'm so happy to be able to go about my
[2:00:49] day for a couple of years I was not able
[2:00:51] to go about my day for a couple of years
[2:00:54] I was afflicted with an illness that
[2:00:56] going from the bedroom to the bathroom
[2:00:57] it was a challenge in my church and the
[2:01:01] people that loved me and cared for me
[2:01:03] you want to talk about a gospel love
[2:01:04] I've never expected it was so humbling I
[2:01:07] never wanted to be one who needed and he
[2:01:10] helped people brought food people took
[2:01:12] me the doctors took me here took me
[2:01:13] their love took care of my car clean my
[2:01:18] house moved me when I had to move to
[2:01:20] another house friends when you're in
[2:01:23] need that's when you need to know that
[2:01:27] you've got a support team
[2:01:28] around you and the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:01:31] is the greatest support team and so now
[2:01:34] here we owe and I wake up in the morning
[2:01:36] and I say when I go out I have in my
[2:01:39] mind I probably believe will be to a lot
[2:01:44] of people I meet for the first time
[2:01:46] today I will probably be the only Son of
[2:01:49] God that they ever come in contact with
[2:01:52] in their entire life and the same for
[2:01:56] you you may be the only son or daughter
[2:01:58] of God that they ever come
[2:01:59] eyeball-to-eyeball with and if you hear
[2:02:02] God if you see if you just feel just a
[2:02:04] little quickening or there's are so many
[2:02:07] wonderful tracks out now you know the
[2:02:09] one brother Tim Pruitt's church is done
[2:02:11] on the the knowledge of the tree of good
[2:02:13] and evil I have passed that out like
[2:02:15] it's like they were candy I used to give
[2:02:17] candy to the kids you know and then the
[2:02:19] mother said we don't pay the dentist's
[2:02:20] bill brother Ernie and so now I just
[2:02:22] passed out tracts and you know I've only
[2:02:25] had two people ever give me that track
[2:02:28] back the other four four of them they
[2:02:30] got a revelation right away when they
[2:02:33] read the book several of them are still
[2:02:35] looking at it and only two said no this
[2:02:37] is not for me but the way that they lay
[2:02:39] it out they got a beautiful introduction
[2:02:41] and then they lay out the scriptures
[2:02:43] question question question question
[2:02:45] scripture scripture question a person I
[2:02:49] don't think me rude a person is either
[2:02:51] got to be stuck in stupid or deep and
[2:02:53] dumb to be able to read that tract and
[2:02:55] not be able to see that it that it was
[2:02:57] that what happened there
[2:02:59] you know the brother who witnessed to me
[2:03:01] he's a big old guy brother Arnie big old
[2:03:03] guy and when he first came to the
[2:03:05] message big ol Italian fella you know he
[2:03:07] would have been a good mafia hit man I
[2:03:09] mean he was great and I think you know
[2:03:11] him brother home or brother West knew
[2:03:13] him and but you know what he would go to
[2:03:15] witness the people he say now look he he
[2:03:18] did he didn't he couldn't take scripture
[2:03:20] in place he said you look right here see
[2:03:22] that Genesis 3 he said look he said you
[2:03:25] know that wasn't no Apple on that tree
[2:03:28] it was sex and you know it put on your
[2:03:32] big-boy pants you think you know
[2:03:34] something about God well naturally it
[2:03:38] wasn't the best way to witness the
[2:03:40] people
[2:03:41] it's an old saying that said people
[2:03:43] don't care how much you know until they
[2:03:44] know how much you care and it's not so
[2:03:47] much the matter you cover it's the
[2:03:48] manner in which you cover the matter
[2:03:50] that makes all the difference
[2:03:51] I'll give you illustrate if a man and
[2:03:53] the wife are sitting down having a
[2:03:55] romantic dinner and the husband says you
[2:03:57] know honey
[2:03:58] when I look at you when I look in your
[2:04:01] eyes it just seems like time stands
[2:04:04] still that would be nice right what if
[2:04:07] he said your face could stop a clock you
[2:04:13] said the same thing but you're going to
[2:04:15] get two very different reactions P and
[2:04:19] so we got to be sweet when we present
[2:04:21] this word this is sweet fresh manna that
[2:04:25] we're delivering to people and so now
[2:04:29] after this let's turn to 2 I don't even
[2:04:34] know who my glasses are that I drop them
[2:04:36] down there anywhere Sam well I found my
[2:04:42] watch now I got my glasses okay we're a
[2:04:43] good and in the second second
[2:04:46] Corinthians and we're going to start
[2:04:53] reading at chapter 9
[2:05:03] no I'm sorry sorry chapter 11 and we're
[2:05:07] going to start reading with the first
[2:05:09] verse now by this time Saul he has been
[2:05:12] through some trials he's out there you
[2:05:14] know he's evangelizing he's pioneering
[2:05:16] churches and you know he did not have an
[2:05:19] easy go of it think of the people that
[2:05:21] Saul had to deal with first of all he
[2:05:24] had the Jews that were semi converted
[2:05:27] from Judaism and they're trying to see
[2:05:30] Messiah so that may be like their the
[2:05:32] the Messiah you know the Jesus for cry
[2:05:34] she's pews for Jesus kind of Greipel you
[2:05:36] know and they're halfway in but still
[2:05:38] holding to all their custom then you got
[2:05:40] the raw Hagar the pagan heathens they
[2:05:42] don't know anything about God and so
[2:05:45] they're all coming together in a house
[2:05:46] church and the Jews are who you mean I
[2:05:50] got a fellowship with these rats and and
[2:05:52] and and so so Paul had to deal with this
[2:05:56] he had to bring them together had to
[2:05:58] have that agape love then we look at at
[2:06:01] Galatian in Galatians or argue about
[2:06:03] who's got the better gifts who's more
[2:06:04] spiritual and then we look at Ephesians
[2:06:07] and and the church has kind of grown too
[2:06:10] mature the book of Ephesians it may be
[2:06:12] the most profound book in the entire
[2:06:14] Bible when it comes to a relationship
[2:06:16] between God and man
[2:06:18] but now Saul he's still he's still in
[2:06:21] early early trials and Saul now he says
[2:06:24] word to God
[2:06:25] you would bear with me a little in my
[2:06:28] folly now the message I'm only gonna be
[2:06:30] a little while but the message I want to
[2:06:32] drop today is a fool for Christ okay now
[2:06:37] Paul gives the first time he mentions it
[2:06:39] word to God you would bear with me a
[2:06:41] little in my folly on in my foolishness
[2:06:43] and indeed bear with me for I am jealous
[2:06:47] over you with godly jealousy and I have
[2:06:50] espoused you to one husband that I may
[2:06:54] present you as a chaste virgin to Christ
[2:06:56] I remember back in 88 I heard brother
[2:06:59] Bisco he say now unless the human
[2:07:02] language has lost every bit of meaning
[2:07:05] Eve was not chaste and she was not a
[2:07:08] virgin he said but I fear lest by any
[2:07:11] means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[2:07:14] through his subtlety so your mom
[2:07:17] should be should be corrupted from the
[2:07:22] simplicity that's in Christ for if he
[2:07:25] come preaches another Jesus whom we have
[2:07:27] not preached or if you receive another
[2:07:29] spirit which he had not received or
[2:07:30] another gospel which we have not
[2:07:35] accepted you might well bear with him
[2:07:37] but I suppose I was not a whit behind
[2:07:39] the very chiefest of apostles and then
[2:07:43] he admits but though I am rude in speech
[2:07:46] you imagine what it must have been like
[2:07:48] for Saul the Pharisee to preach first
[2:07:52] Corinthians thirteen the love chapter
[2:07:56] one of the greatest books ever who were
[2:07:58] greatest chapters of any time ever and
[2:08:01] God had to speak that through saw what a
[2:08:04] transformation had to take place so he
[2:08:08] said for though I may be rude in speech
[2:08:09] yet not knowledge but we have been
[2:08:11] thoroughly made manifest among you in
[2:08:13] all things now we drop down to verse 13
[2:08:16] and he's talking about the the people
[2:08:18] who come into the church he said for
[2:08:20] such a false apostles deceitful workers
[2:08:22] transforming themselves into the
[2:08:24] apostles of Christ and no Marvel for
[2:08:27] Satan himself is transformed into an
[2:08:29] angel of light therefore it is no great
[2:08:32] thing if his Satan's ministers are
[2:08:36] transformed as the ministers of
[2:08:38] righteousness whose end shall be
[2:08:41] according to their works
[2:08:42] now so he starts again he says now he
[2:08:45] said I say again let no man think me a
[2:08:50] fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive
[2:08:58] me that I may boast myself a little now
[2:09:02] listen to this Paul says that which I
[2:09:04] speak I speak it not after the Lord soul
[2:09:11] says the Lord didn't tell me to say this
[2:09:13] the Lord didn't tell me to do this but
[2:09:18] as it were foolishly in this confidence
[2:09:23] of boasting saul is saying i should not
[2:09:26] have to do this
[2:09:28] you should have received me you know my
[2:09:31] life you know my nature you know my
[2:09:33] character you know what I've been
[2:09:34] through I should not have to even tell
[2:09:36] you these things that which I speak I
[2:09:41] speak not after the Lord but as it were
[2:09:43] foolishly in this confidence of boasting
[2:09:46] seeing that many glory after the flesh I
[2:09:48] will glory also for you suffer fools
[2:09:50] gladly seeing yourselves are wise a
[2:09:54] little bit of sarcasm there you suffer
[2:09:56] fools but you guys are all smart you
[2:09:58] guys know it all you got the message all
[2:10:00] figured out not talking about you I'm
[2:10:02] something other people Paul was talking
[2:10:04] to for you suffer fools gladly seeing
[2:10:08] yourself a wise for if you suffer if a
[2:10:11] man bring you into bondage if a man
[2:10:13] devour you if a man take of you if a man
[2:10:17] exalt himself if a man smite you on the
[2:10:19] face and again he goes back he said I
[2:10:21] speak as concerning reproach as though
[2:10:24] we had been weak howbeit were and so
[2:10:27] ever any is bold and in parentheses Paul
[2:10:30] says I speak foolishly I shouldn't be
[2:10:33] saying this
[2:10:34] I shouldn't be humbling myself I
[2:10:36] shouldn't have any you heard about the
[2:10:38] guy he prayed for 10 years Eyre was he
[2:10:41] wanted to be humble after ten years
[2:10:44] while he was praying he said Lord I
[2:10:46] think I've done it I think I'm humble
[2:10:49] and God said now you're guilty of pride
[2:10:54] so Paul is saying he's saying here for
[2:10:59] you suffer fools gladly if you suffer a
[2:11:01] man bring into bondage from and devours
[2:11:03] a man take of you if a man exalt
[2:11:05] themselves if a man smite you on the
[2:11:07] face I speak his concern a reproach as
[2:11:09] though we had been weak howbeit we're
[2:11:11] and so ever any is bold
[2:11:12] I speak foolishly I am bold also are
[2:11:16] they Hebrew I just hear Paul speed are
[2:11:19] they Hebrews so am i sometimes we read
[2:11:25] this we tell are they Hebrew so a
[2:11:26] mileage no no take some take take take
[2:11:29] and read try to imagine what Paul was
[2:11:32] saying while he was read are they Hebrew
[2:11:35] so a mine are they Israelites so am i
[2:11:38] are they the seed of Abraham so am I
[2:11:42] are they ministers of Christ again he
[2:11:44] says I speak as a fool but I know I
[2:11:47] shouldn't be doing this I don't want to
[2:11:49] do it I hate doing it but I got to do it
[2:11:53] I think ministers of Christ I speak as a
[2:11:58] fool I am more in Labour's more abundant
[2:12:01] in stripes above measure five times Paul
[2:12:09] got 39 lashes on his 195 lashes from
[2:12:15] these torturous monsters that took that
[2:12:19] Roman whip with the lictors the little
[2:12:21] lead balls at the end of it and they
[2:12:23] crack that whip and they pulled it back
[2:12:25] and those lead balls went right into the
[2:12:28] flesh rip the flesh Bruhl out everywhere
[2:12:31] xxx I don't believe a man today I don't
[2:12:34] care how strong he is or how in shape
[2:12:36] I don't believe a man could take a
[2:12:38] hundred and ninety-five lashes today
[2:12:40] like Saul did so he said five times
[2:12:44] received by forty stripes save one
[2:12:47] thrice I was beaten with rough that
[2:12:49] couldn't have been easy beaten with rods
[2:12:51] three times once was i stoned
[2:12:55] they had a rock party and they killed
[2:12:57] Saul and they left him under the rocks
[2:13:00] and they left and God raised up Saul he
[2:13:04] brushed himself off check this itinerary
[2:13:07] Marsh right on to the next city Saul a
[2:13:11] fool a fool for Christ a knight in a day
[2:13:17] I have been in the deep in journeyings
[2:13:19] often in perils of water and perils of
[2:13:21] robbers in perils by mine own countrymen
[2:13:24] in perils by the heathen in perils in
[2:13:26] the city in perils in the wilderness in
[2:13:28] perils in the sea in perils among false
[2:13:30] brethren in weariness and painfulness in
[2:13:34] watchings often in hunger and thirst
[2:13:37] Paul was a homeless man for most of his
[2:13:39] life after he got converted he didn't
[2:13:42] have the Rose the Rose peddled beds to
[2:13:45] go and laid he didn't have 5-star Hotel
[2:13:47] he didn't even have a motel 6 of goats
[2:13:50] that would have been like the Taj Mahal
[2:13:51] for him
[2:13:53] in watchings often in hunger Thor in
[2:13:56] fastings often in cold and nakedness
[2:14:00] those Roman jails they were designed for
[2:14:03] torture they were designed to make
[2:14:06] somebody as uncomfortable as possible
[2:14:09] besides those things that are without
[2:14:11] Nepal saying besides everything I'm
[2:14:14] going through in my flesh mentally and
[2:14:18] emotionally everything in the natural
[2:14:21] realm besides all that
[2:14:27] besides those things that are without
[2:14:29] that which cometh upon me daily the care
[2:14:33] of all the churches here's a prophet a
[2:14:37] prophet messenger his ministry is to the
[2:14:42] Gentile church around the world and so
[2:14:46] he has to go through all that physical
[2:14:48] torture and at the same time he's
[2:14:51] worried about corinth worried about
[2:14:53] Galatia worried about it worried about
[2:14:56] all the false bread that all the wolves
[2:14:59] that are going in spreading false
[2:15:01] doctrine about Paul's message who is
[2:15:04] weak and I am NOT weak who was offended
[2:15:07] and I burn not if I must needs glory I
[2:15:10] will glory of the things which concern
[2:15:12] my infirmities when saw when they had
[2:15:16] that there's this garrison of a people
[2:15:18] looking to kill him Saul says the God
[2:15:21] and father of our Lord Jesus which is
[2:15:22] blessed for evermore Noah that I lie not
[2:15:25] in Damascus the governor under arethis
[2:15:28] the king kept the city with a garrison
[2:15:34] desirous to apprehend me and through a
[2:15:39] window in a blanket a basket I was let
[2:15:43] down by the wall and escaped his hands
[2:15:47] think of there was all points bulletin
[2:15:50] out for Saul they wanted to kill him
[2:15:53] that they they couldn't do it fast
[2:15:56] enough
[2:15:57] it couldn't be bad enough couldn't be
[2:15:59] bloody enough they wanted to rip this
[2:16:02] guy limb from limb if they had ever got
[2:16:05] a hold of him and now for for our last
[2:16:09] scripture if we can turn over to
[2:16:11] Philippians in chapter 3 verse 1 I'm
[2:16:17] just going to read quickly save time
[2:16:20] finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord
[2:16:23] to write the same things to you
[2:16:30] sorry finally my brother rejoicing the
[2:16:33] lord to write the same things to you to
[2:16:35] me indeed is not Grievous but for you it
[2:16:38] is safe beware of dogs beware of evil
[2:16:41] workers beware of the concision that
[2:16:44] means taking the message and splicing
[2:16:46] the message you know taking a little
[2:16:47] using the message for a smorgasbord pick
[2:16:50] out what you like and leave what you
[2:16:51] don't like beware beware of the
[2:16:53] concision for we which are of the
[2:16:55] circumcision which worship God in the
[2:16:58] spirit and rejoice in Jesus Christ and
[2:17:00] have no confidence in the flesh though I
[2:17:02] might have confidence in the flesh if
[2:17:05] any other man thinking that he whereof
[2:17:07] he might trust in the flesh I more and
[2:17:09] again soul he has to he has to boast a
[2:17:13] little bit circumcised the eighth day of
[2:17:15] the stock of Israel of the tribe of
[2:17:18] Benjamin an Hebrew of the Hebrews and
[2:17:21] touching the law a Pharisee considering
[2:17:24] zeal persecuting the church touching
[2:17:26] righteousness which is the law blameless
[2:17:31] think about how radical he was to keep
[2:17:34] the law every jot every tittle probably
[2:17:38] had those phylacteries those scriptures
[2:17:40] all around is his arms and his legs
[2:17:42] everywhere he went a check Isaiah said
[2:17:45] to see everywhere he went he was like a
[2:17:48] walking talking buck well you know what
[2:17:49] a believer you are a walking talking
[2:17:52] supernatural encyclopedia that's who you
[2:17:55] are and people who try to tell you this
[2:17:58] whole earth came about by the big bang I
[2:18:01] say you really believe that if you
[2:18:04] believe that the Big Bang cause every
[2:18:06] species and men to be created you would
[2:18:10] believe I could take a stick of dynamite
[2:18:11] and throw it into a print shop and I
[2:18:14] would come a dictionary
[2:18:18] their minds are gone the the world is
[2:18:22] insane spiral it's insanity on steroids
[2:18:26] our country is on the verge of a civil
[2:18:29] war not a racial civil war a political
[2:18:33] civil war and there are people who are
[2:18:36] designed to take our country down if
[2:18:38] only they could take one man down we
[2:18:43] know the man that's in the office is the
[2:18:45] man God put in that office just like the
[2:18:47] last man was enough he was designed to
[2:18:50] put to bring America to the state she
[2:18:52] was in but those things don't don't
[2:18:54] concern us friends we're concerned with
[2:18:57] another kingdom a never-ending Kingdom
[2:19:02] wherefore God as also highly exalted him
[2:19:06] and given him I'm sorry and be found in
[2:19:10] him not having this is verse 9 and be
[2:19:15] found in him not having mine own
[2:19:17] righteousness which is of the law but
[2:19:18] that which is through the faith of Jesus
[2:19:21] the righteousness which is of God by
[2:19:23] faith that I may know him and the power
[2:19:27] of his resurrection let's stand to our
[2:19:30] feet friends that I may know him and the
[2:19:32] power of his resurrection and the
[2:19:35] Fellowship of his sufferings being made
[2:19:37] conformable unto his death if by any
[2:19:41] means I might attain unto the
[2:19:45] resurrection of the Dead not as though I
[2:19:47] had already attained either we're
[2:19:49] already perfect but I follow after it
[2:19:52] that I may apprehend that for which also
[2:19:55] I am apprehend of Jesus Christ finally
[2:19:59] he says brethren I count not myself to
[2:20:01] have apprehended but this one thing I do
[2:20:04] and I trust that each one of us when we
[2:20:07] walk out this door we can take this
[2:20:09] scripture this one thing I do forgetting
[2:20:11] those things which are behind you ought
[2:20:16] to forget them because God already
[2:20:17] forgot them why should we remember them
[2:20:20] if God can't remember them if we are
[2:20:22] like God's we can forget them we can
[2:20:24] forget our brothers Falls our brothers
[2:20:26] of mistakes we can forget all those
[2:20:28] things
[2:20:29] forgetting those things which are behind
[2:20:31] and reaching forth under the things
[2:20:33] which are before I press forward to the
[2:20:37] mark for the prize of the high calling
[2:20:39] of God in Christ Jesus the the phrase
[2:20:45] that I love Paul said I am not ashamed
[2:20:48] of the gospel of Jesus Christ let's bow
[2:20:52] our heads father we thank you for how
[2:20:58] you have allowed us to see the first

[2:21:08] has ever known what a life what a zeal
[2:21:12] what a character Lord he had one thought
[2:21:15] one desire and that was heaven and to

[2:21:20] him father and here you have come again
[2:21:23] and you have with your messenger in this

[2:21:34] in the entire Bible how not for the
[2:21:37] press is how numb how dull how
[2:21:40] desensitized the church has gotten over
[2:21:43] the years but not the Bride of Christ

[2:21:48] she's blazing a trail of glory she's
[2:21:53] living she's going to be so much like
[2:21:55] Christ that people are going to be able
