[3:35] when the lord brought me back

[3:44] i'm coming up here playing second fiddle
[3:46] somebody that's better than me that

[15:30] and good to see about that in the house
[15:32] of the lord this afternoon
[15:34] we'd like to turn in your scriptures
[15:35] turn back where we've been reading from
[15:37] revelations 1 and
[15:41] 2 peter 1.
[15:44] now remember the lord willing brother
[15:46] samson sheddy will be here with us on
[15:48] wednesday preaching for us
[15:50] and then on the
[15:52] night
[15:53] brother
[15:54] samuel
[15:55] prakash kocha for the cash's son will be
[15:58] here preaching for us on the night
[16:01] and then remember the next weekend
[16:03] the third saturday will be the
[16:05] fellowship meeting that brother
[16:07] so remember that and just pray that the
[16:09] lord would bless if you want to ride
[16:10] with us make sure you let us know and
[16:12] we'll be glad for you to ride on with us
[16:15] to the fellowship meeting and back all
[16:17] right
[16:18] and so i think that's all of the
[16:20] announcements uh bible study saturday
[16:24] be on justification
[16:26] so come and be with us and let's have a
[16:28] good time in the lord right
[16:30] father we thank you for your love and
[16:31] your grace we thank you
[16:34] for you being you because
[16:36] that way we can depend on it
[16:39] because you're always the same you never
[16:41] change
[16:42] if ever how you deal with each one of us
[16:44] you'll always deal with other people
[16:46] that way if we'll just allow it to
[16:48] happen
[16:49] you'd reveal yourself back there to them
[16:51] then surely you'll reveal yourself unto
[16:53] us here now
[16:54] we pray that you would just bless and
[16:56] guide each one as we read your words you
[16:58] come lord and have your way with each
[17:00] one of our hearts and lives forgive our
[17:02] sins and cleanse us from all
[17:04] unrighteousness
[17:06] may we walk in you lord we love you and
[17:08] we thank you
[17:10] in jesus name
[17:12] amen
[17:14] revelations
[17:16] 1
[17:20] you're back on where we've been we just
[17:22] kind of took a little gap
[17:24] this morning and i hope you'll take that
[17:25] message and study it
[17:27] and think about it a lot because
[17:29] you may say well it just didn't sound
[17:31] like much to me but
[17:33] it's been on my heart a long time
[17:36] that to
[17:37] speak and say you know that
[17:39] you know we could be in idle worship
[17:44] worse than false god
[17:48] amen so how do we know
[17:53] so we better know right
[17:55] we better know whether the one speaking
[17:56] to us is real or not
[17:59] just remember the way you know see i
[18:02] didn't finish the message but the way
[18:04] you know is remember it was
[18:06] your own personal experience but it's
[18:08] the word
[18:10] because if that one's speaking to you
[18:13] abram went from abram and he met god he
[18:16] journeyed with him he met him on
[18:18] different occasions and then he made him
[18:21] and changed his name
[18:22] not all in his journey but around said
[18:24] the journey of every christian would
[18:26] come like abraham absolutely right if
[18:29] that one that's talking to you that's
[18:30] led you so far
[18:32] we'll just keep talking to you
[18:36] but if it ever stops leading you to the
[18:37] word
[18:39] you want to know who's talking to it he
[18:42] said will he lead us part of the way yes
[18:43] he'll lead us part of the way
[18:45] and that was the seriousness of what i
[18:47] was wanting us to see
[18:49] because i've seen so many people in this
[18:51] message come in it
[18:53] and be in it a while
[18:55] and to see them just fall away
[18:57] well evidently something stopped talking
[18:59] because god is the same right he never
[19:02] changes right
[19:03] that was my whole point of trying to get
[19:05] across to unified
[19:08] so the revelation of jesus christ which
[19:10] god gave unto him to show unto his
[19:12] servants things which must shortly come
[19:14] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[19:16] his angel and to his servant john
[19:19] who by record of the word of god and the
[19:21] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[19:23] things that he saw
[19:25] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[19:27] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[19:29] those things which are written therein
[19:32] for the time is at hand
[19:35] now we're going to second peter
[19:38] excuse me
[19:40] first peter
[19:43] one
[19:45] receive verse nine receive the end of
[19:47] your faith even the salvation of your
[19:50] soul
[19:53] be on the head of myself souls is to the
[19:56] soul of which salvation the prophets
[19:58] have inquired and searched diligently
[20:00] who prophesied of the grace that should
[20:02] come unto you
[20:03] searching what or what manner of time
[20:06] the spirit of christ which was in them
[20:07] did signify
[20:09] when it testified beforehand the
[20:11] sufferings of christ and the glory that
[20:13] should follow
[20:14] unto whom it was revealed that unto that
[20:17] not unto themselves but unto us they did
[20:19] minister the things which are now
[20:21] reported unto you
[20:23] by them that have preached the gospel
[20:25] unto you by the holy ghost sent down
[20:27] from heaven which things the angels
[20:29] desire to look into
[20:31] wherefore god of the loins of your mind
[20:33] be sober and hope to the end for the
[20:35] grace
[20:36] grace is a revelation
[20:38] that is to be brought unto you at the
[20:41] revelation
[20:42] of jesus christ you may be seated
[20:45] lord that is blessing to the reading of
[20:48] the word
[20:49] right now
[20:51] i want to try to
[20:54] not
[20:55] review as much
[20:57] today but i want to make a point
[21:00] of the message and we'll get to it in
[21:02] order to bring it down into
[21:04] what i wanted us to see
[21:07] and then the lord willing i don't know
[21:09] exactly how
[21:11] we will start approaching the
[21:14] uh the rest of the book of revelations
[21:16] uh i may choose to
[21:19] uh speak a little bit on it and
[21:21] things but it will not be in a lengthy
[21:24] uh discussion of each seal that's more
[21:26] or less maybe take a seal you see what
[21:28] it is see what's doing and you know go
[21:31] from that
[21:32] and uh try to go on into the book of
[21:35] revelations
[21:36] but
[21:37] you know
[21:38] now
[21:40] we're over in chapter five
[21:43] and we've been in this for quite a while
[21:46] and showing that
[21:49] you know that there was a
[21:51] book in the hand of the one sitting on
[21:53] the throne
[21:55] in verse one it says that book is sealed
[21:58] with seven seals
[22:00] now
[22:01] the emphasis most everybody has placed
[22:04] upon that is
[22:06] um the part of it where it says written
[22:08] within and on the backside sealed with
[22:10] seven seals
[22:11] they totally you know just do away with
[22:13] thinking about the seals part of it and
[22:16] just wondering whether it's inside or
[22:18] outside
[22:19] and uh you know that's kind of what
[22:20] we'll be dealing with on the daniel 70
[22:23] week so you pray for us about it
[22:25] because most of the thing is a
[22:27] discussion of whether that's three and a
[22:28] half years
[22:29] left after the rapture or seven years
[22:31] left after the rapture
[22:33] instead of you know even trying to
[22:35] understand
[22:37] uh anything about the plan of redemption
[22:40] to just arguments over whether it's
[22:42] three and a half or seven and like one
[22:44] brother said said well just put them
[22:46] both together and it'll be ten and a
[22:47] half so that's not too good of an answer
[22:50] for anything
[22:51] you know uh of doing but you know
[22:58] this book is sealed
[23:00] in the hand of the one sitting on the
[23:01] throne a proclamation goes forward you
[23:04] know
[23:05] for somebody some man to be able to come
[23:07] and take the book
[23:08] and to loose the seals
[23:10] now taking the book would be fine but
[23:13] we're not interested in just someone
[23:15] taking the book
[23:17] but to loose the seals thereof
[23:20] is the emphasis john is making see
[23:22] are the angel to him and and you know
[23:25] and that's exactly the way it is it
[23:27] needs to be understood that we've got to
[23:29] understand what's within the book
[23:32] all right now today we will be dealing
[23:34] with
[23:35] what is related to us
[23:39] us
[23:39] here people rightly age time where we're
[23:42] at
[23:43] uh of the seals and the things and then
[23:46] we will go into the
[23:48] other parts of that later
[23:51] i'm sure of some but now watch
[23:55] the book is closed
[23:58] it's sealed right
[24:00] a proclamation comes forward
[24:03] all right
[24:04] and then
[24:06] the angel says now the the root of you
[24:09] know the the
[24:11] king has
[24:13] overcome he can do it right but when he
[24:16] looked he saw a lamb
[24:18] he saw a line you know calling for a
[24:20] line
[24:21] but because he knew it would tie
[24:23] together with redemption of the line of
[24:25] the tribe of judah
[24:27] but then when it comes forth i tried to
[24:29] emphasize that you know the the odd part
[24:32] was that you see a lamb with seven horns
[24:34] and seven eyes
[24:37] and you know
[24:39] that to me as i've tried to make
[24:41] emphasis upon is the fact that you and i
[24:44] must produce that lamb
[24:48] all right
[24:48] it's not just an
[24:50] uh well it was done at calvary
[24:54] you know that's fine that's wonderful
[24:56] because it's got to be the same lamb
[24:58] right
[24:59] all right the same lamb that was at
[25:01] calvary
[25:02] but it's the end time
[25:05] to see and understand
[25:08] our day in knowing what's taking place
[25:11] here in this hour
[25:12] among you and i and what will bring to
[25:15] pass
[25:18] the uh
[25:19] rapture
[25:22] so we see here in chapter five that the
[25:24] the pride is in glory
[25:27] so we know for certainty that this will
[25:30] come to pass
[25:31] amen in our day amen
[25:33] one because we've already looked forward
[25:35] to seeing the uh the bride and glory
[25:38] after the rapture
[25:40] so then it means it's not worth it or
[25:42] not we may do it
[25:45] it means that we have done it or it will
[25:47] take place
[25:49] now there are things i believe in the
[25:52] journey of the christian
[25:53] life and the part to do with with uh
[25:56] bringing about these things
[25:59] i believe that
[26:00] a lot of those things are already taking
[26:02] place right
[26:04] all right
[26:05] i'm not looking for one of these days
[26:08] when
[26:09] something's going to happen or
[26:11] somebody's going to raise up uh you know
[26:14] whatever and a great move starts
[26:18] on the basis of
[26:20] you know some kind of a help to get us
[26:22] out of here
[26:23] i believe the message has already been
[26:25] brought back
[26:27] i believe we must get into the message
[26:29] right now all right
[26:31] and by doing it then i can stand here
[26:33] and say
[26:34] somebody will right right mm-hmm right
[26:38] why because it's there in the words
[26:40] the picture is shown you remember the
[26:42] scene
[26:43] the prophet i kept emphasizing the scene
[26:47] preparing for the opening of the seven
[26:48] seals
[26:50] all right
[26:51] that scene has to do with you and i
[26:55] because that lamb
[26:56] comes from the church ages because it's
[26:58] got the seven horns and seven eyes the
[27:00] lamb that was crucified at calvary
[27:02] didn't have seven horns and seven eyes
[27:05] that was the beginning that was the one
[27:07] to pay the price
[27:09] but in the end time he's to come back
[27:12] in his people
[27:14] and remember the last message i was
[27:16] bringing to you that
[27:18] i believe the bride of jesus christ must
[27:20] become
[27:21] as the prophet we gave emphasis
[27:24] the fullness
[27:25] total fullness of the godhead bodily
[27:29] he said well how can you prove that
[27:30] without even a quote from the prophet
[27:32] i could prove it by the fact that this
[27:35] is chapter five
[27:36] somebody has already made it to a place
[27:40] to where this is showing
[27:43] it already finished
[27:46] right
[27:47] right so somebody's going to have to
[27:48] become the word why can't we believe
[27:50] that we're part of it
[27:52] why can't we put the emphasis upon where
[27:54] we're at right you know why can't we we
[27:56] believe this is it
[27:59] why are we looking for something else
[28:02] you know are we waiting for another bus
[28:04] to pull up or another messenger to fall
[28:06] out of heaven or some form or something
[28:09] no
[28:10] we're here at the end of all things
[28:14] and i don't mind making the emphasis
[28:16] because it's already shown it will take
[28:18] place but if this bride doesn't become
[28:21] the word
[28:22] and everything behind her is gone right
[28:25] amen that's right
[28:27] hebrews 11 40 they without us cannot be
[28:29] made perfect right
[28:31] so it's dependent upon you and i am
[28:36] no no brother leo it's dependent upon
[28:38] jesus christ well what do you think i'm
[28:39] talking about right
[28:41] if the bride becomes the fullness of the
[28:42] godhead bodily then jesus christ will be
[28:45] in his church here in the last days
[28:47] that's sensible right he will even be
[28:49] visible among us without being corporal
[28:52] but he'll be visible among us and raise
[28:55] the dead and we'll go into rapture
[28:56] that's what your prophet had to say
[28:58] all right
[29:00] but in doing that now
[29:04] see we we look at it
[29:09] and we we're kind of looking at
[29:10] something that
[29:13] is a mystery
[29:17] and a mystery
[29:20] is something that's
[29:22] going on
[29:24] but not fully comprehended right
[29:27] you agree with that definition that's
[29:28] dale's definition okay
[29:30] a mystery is something that's going on
[29:33] or being made known
[29:34] but not fully comprehended
[29:37] that's why it remains a mystery and the
[29:39] prophet said even a supernatural element
[29:42] will remain
[29:45] even to the fact it is revealed
[29:48] all right
[29:49] see now we've read this for 40 years
[29:52] right
[29:54] right
[29:56] we've read the prophet's message for 40
[29:58] something years
[29:59] about these things
[30:02] all right
[30:04] but you know
[30:05] it must be somewhere that it will come
[30:08] to pass
[30:11] and as it does then we'll see
[30:14] the hour and time that we're living
[30:18] all right
[30:20] now
[30:22] to do that i want you to just
[30:24] kind of think with me on a line that
[30:29] this one that comes and takes the book
[30:34] is the lamb of god
[30:38] all right
[30:40] this lamb of god
[30:42] does not have to come
[30:44] now listen to me please
[30:47] this lamb of god that we're looking at
[30:48] in revelations in this end time doesn't
[30:51] have to come to take away the sins of
[30:52] the world
[30:55] that was done at calvary
[30:57] that's right all right but then it can't
[30:59] be a different lamb right amen
[31:03] you you can't have it a different land
[31:08] but you can have it in a different the
[31:09] land in a different form right amen
[31:12] remember father son of holy ghost is not
[31:14] three gods
[31:16] it's god in a different form or
[31:18] manifestation
[31:20] all right
[31:22] so here in the end time we're not
[31:23] looking for him to come upon a cross and
[31:25] die again but we're looking for him to
[31:28] become in our own experiences remember
[31:31] now i preached this over and over in our
[31:33] experiences
[31:34] can you see in your experience that that
[31:37] lamb has been restored to the throne in
[31:40] your life
[31:44] can you see in your life in your
[31:45] revelation and your thoughts
[31:49] are are we still just tied up in all
[31:51] kinds of doctrines
[31:52] right
[31:54] well we don't know whether this is right
[31:56] someone's so saying that situation well
[31:58] that you'll never get anywhere from this
[32:00] morning's message because
[32:02] if you remember it i emphasize
[32:04] that voice that speaks to you let's keep
[32:06] on speaking to you
[32:09] will change us will be the same thing
[32:12] that we started with just in a different
[32:14] being a deeper meaning not a different
[32:16] meaning
[32:19] so then we're looking at it and we're
[32:21] seeing that
[32:24] this lamb
[32:26] that comes afford to take the books
[32:29] would have to be in our experience
[32:31] that's right that's true
[32:35] all right
[32:36] if it's dependent upon us
[32:40] come on now all right if it's dependent
[32:42] upon a people to become the word
[32:46] and god has
[32:48] said that would take place
[32:50] already to work right
[32:52] then it will come to pilates amen
[32:55] the only difference is that we have the
[32:56] opportunity to be able to
[32:59] make ourselves available exactly
[33:01] maybe it's a bad way of saying it but
[33:04] what else can you say
[33:07] because it is left up to us
[33:14] that was the one thing of the 70 weeks
[33:16] of daniel i don't know we may emphasize
[33:18] it a lot when we get up there but i
[33:19] doubt it but because it don't matter the
[33:21] angle people ain't gonna listen to you
[33:22] when you say it by the way but that's
[33:24] where i proved in 1974 that we could
[33:26] pass the year 2026
[33:29] and later on i corrected that to even go
[33:31] up that we could pass the year
[33:34] huh
[33:36] 3 000.
[33:39] and not break brother brown's message
[33:43] so don't just think that time has run
[33:45] out some time running out means we gotta
[33:47] be here
[33:48] now time running out don't make us eat
[33:50] right okay that's right that's right
[33:54] what makes us it is when the word
[33:55] becomes revealed to us
[33:57] you remember i kept asking the question
[33:59] one day could
[34:00] you take your revelation and go to
[34:03] israel
[34:06] and them receive jesus christ
[34:10] now
[34:12] listening to him the other day where he
[34:13] was talking about listening with that
[34:15] jew you know
[34:17] said that you said you can't take that
[34:18] thank god in three pieces
[34:20] give to us jews
[34:23] so they'll tell you right real quick
[34:24] where that come from so they know it
[34:26] comes from the catholic church right
[34:29] you see they studied it they know where
[34:30] it comes from
[34:34] now
[34:35] in doing that then
[34:37] you couldn't take a trinity and go there
[34:40] no that's right well could you take the
[34:42] two lords or something like that and go
[34:43] there
[34:45] or jesus wouldn't god to the river
[34:46] jordan
[34:48] could you take that and go to israel
[34:53] well they just laugh at you
[34:56] but a real true revelation of one true
[34:58] and living god in the correct
[35:00] order that's why brother run says
[35:04] you won't go because it ain't going to
[35:06] be you
[35:08] he said it's going to be two prophets
[35:10] they are the ones that's going to have
[35:12] that revelation and they are the ones
[35:14] that's going to have the signs to back
[35:16] it up right you might be able to go over
[35:17] there and make an intellectual speech to
[35:19] the jews
[35:20] but remember we had to take the rapture
[35:22] yet if we hadn't taken the rapture yet
[35:23] the gentile age is not over yet right
[35:25] right if it is over you and i missed it
[35:30] i don't think so
[35:33] but now listen
[35:39] so then why would a prophet
[35:43] if you're looking at the book of
[35:44] revelations and looking at it all over
[35:45] that away and
[35:47] seeing things that way instead of seeing
[35:50] that you and i
[35:52] must first be here on earth
[35:54] all right
[35:56] now how many years have i preached it
[35:58] matching pieces how long have i been
[35:59] preaching on
[36:00] we must match what this is
[36:03] we must be what this is
[36:05] when we get dire will not be a change of
[36:08] what we
[36:10] are when we sit on the throne with him
[36:13] when we're the book in his hand
[36:15] it won't be that we're all messed up
[36:17] here and then we're changed up here
[36:20] no we must be that here
[36:24] before we can go there
[36:26] right all right
[36:28] now see then that way you got your
[36:30] matching pieces yes
[36:32] that's about what six years seven years
[36:34] ago ten years ago
[36:36] all right 95
[36:38] that's that's a view over there
[36:40] all right
[36:41] but now listen
[36:44] we spent a lot of emphasis upon bringing
[36:46] it down and we get to
[36:48] verse seven there of the you know
[36:51] the lamb in verse six for the seven
[36:52] horns and seven eyes
[36:54] in verse seven it says and he came and
[36:56] took the book
[36:58] out of the right hand of him that said
[37:01] all right
[37:02] they come and took the book they don't
[37:04] mean the books open right we just took
[37:06] the book
[37:08] okay
[37:10] now
[37:13] your prophet made a statement go ahead
[37:15] brother
[37:17] i think but bob's on the horn today
[37:21] didn't give him two references i gave
[37:23] you a relaxing
[37:26] but just follow what he's saying
[37:29] and let's see let me
[37:31] do it on me reading the whole thing
[37:33] let's get the emphasis upon the
[37:35] scripture part back
[37:36] down
[37:37] because we want the scriptural part
[37:40] all right and he's getting into the
[37:42] verse and where he's talking about all
[37:43] these things behold and oh in the midst
[37:45] next quoting the scripture that is the
[37:48] when it comes to that that's the eighth
[37:49] verse
[37:50] right
[37:52] the meaning let's see let me make sure
[37:55] because i want the emphasis upon and
[37:57] when he had
[37:58] taken the book before when he beats
[38:01] me
[38:03] it comes to the one sitting up on the
[38:05] throne
[38:07] just get that part
[38:08] now watch what he says
[38:11] and he comes go ahead and wrote it up
[38:12] now when he comes to the one sitting on
[38:14] the throne all right
[38:16] now the sailing church aid the
[38:17] messengers kept the fire burning et
[38:19] cetera he's explaining it four beats
[38:21] four and twenty elders and all the thing
[38:23] look what he said now watch
[38:25] when he had done that watch what taking
[38:27] place
[38:30] you talk about jubilee now this is
[38:32] exactly
[38:34] the breaking of them seals
[38:40] and on the
[38:41] 99 version and on the
[38:43] the uh
[38:45] seal book from the 99 it says taking
[38:49] you know
[38:50] place
[38:51] when they brought it up to the
[38:53] 2010 or whatever they know what they
[38:55] call it one the new one they took it but
[38:58] they put it what and said seals take
[39:01] place it's the same thing all right
[39:03] he said we'll get into that silence in
[39:05] heaven why would a prophet talk about up
[39:08] in heaven
[39:10] the breaking of the seals
[39:15] when the breaking of the seals in heaven
[39:16] will help no one
[39:18] right
[39:19] is that sensible
[39:24] that's like the lamb that was stood as
[39:26] flame before the foundation of the world
[39:28] as long as that's up in heaven not gonna
[39:30] help anybody
[39:33] that have to be transmitted down to
[39:34] earth
[39:37] all right
[39:39] so why would he come in to emphasize
[39:41] here in the fifth chapter
[39:43] and he would say this is the bride of
[39:45] christ in glory after the rapture
[39:49] and he says this is exactly the breaking
[39:51] of them sevens to themselves
[39:57] what's his emphasis upon
[39:59] what is he trying to make a point for
[40:06] all right verse 8
[40:09] and when he had taken the book the four
[40:10] beasts and four and twenty elders
[40:12] fell down before the lamb having every
[40:14] one of them hearts and golden vials full
[40:17] of odors which are the prayers of the
[40:19] saints
[40:23] now that's when he took the book
[40:27] verse 7 he takes the book right
[40:29] takes a book out of his hand
[40:32] verse 8
[40:36] you see something a scene
[40:40] getting ready for the breaking
[40:43] verse nine
[40:45] this group of people who
[40:47] not only just see this
[40:49] but must become this that we're talking
[40:51] about
[40:52] they start rejoicing
[40:58] right they're rejoicing
[41:01] having a good time
[41:03] about their salvation
[41:06] right
[41:08] but then in verse 10 it says
[41:11] and has made us
[41:14] under our god
[41:16] priests and kings and we shall reign on
[41:18] the earth
[41:20] all right
[41:22] now where's the break into the sequence
[41:26] that's my point that's what he said it
[41:27] was now this is exactly the breaking of
[41:29] the seals
[41:32] in chapter five
[41:34] all right
[41:36] now
[41:37] remember
[41:40] remember now
[41:42] whatever you sleep dire
[41:46] has to be taking place here
[41:49] now
[41:50] or it won't be there right now
[41:54] all right
[41:55] that's why i i can't understand the
[41:57] people of this message
[41:59] why of not the joyous rejoicing within
[42:02] their heart
[42:03] about the word that's revealed to us
[42:05] right you know
[42:08] instead of arguing and fussing about the
[42:10] little
[42:11] nitty-gritty points or something right
[42:13] you know
[42:16] not a joyous happy wonderful time
[42:20] to understand
[42:22] we're fixing to go there
[42:25] if it's 20 years what does it matter
[42:27] just be a little older that's right
[42:30] maybe i have more maturity than by the
[42:32] end or something
[42:33] might be able to preach my way around
[42:35] another 20 years
[42:37] no
[42:38] but listen
[42:40] see we're looking for something to
[42:42] happen or some way or
[42:44] instead of
[42:45] seeing that
[42:48] right here
[42:51] something's got to take place in this
[42:53] end time
[42:55] right here
[42:56] right all right
[42:59] now
[43:00] then we look at it there and see that
[43:02] he'd say this is exactly
[43:07] the opening of those seals
[43:12] well
[43:14] now according to the prophet peace
[43:17] i think it's 45 it's the rise of the sun
[43:20] may miss it a little bit it's in the
[43:21] right in the sun
[43:23] he says
[43:25] he is those seals
[43:28] he said what are these seals in other
[43:30] words what would be the emphasis the
[43:32] prophet would place upon the sin he said
[43:34] it's a revelation of jesus
[43:38] christ there's the seals
[43:42] not an antichrist right now
[43:44] that's right amen we'll get to that as
[43:46] we get to the seal partners actually
[43:48] trying to go through
[43:49] the seals is not revealing the
[43:51] antichrist
[43:54] i preached that for how long
[43:58] going within the 40-year bracket
[44:03] because
[44:04] the seal is the holy spirit
[44:08] the holy spirit reveals jesus christ
[44:14] the antichrist is seen in opposition
[44:19] of the holy spirit right so it cannot be
[44:23] the holy spirit cannot be the seal and
[44:25] the seal being the antichrist
[44:29] the holy spirit is the holy spirit that
[44:32] reveals the revelation of jesus christ
[44:37] all right
[44:40] now
[44:42] to go with the part up here they drop
[44:43] back to earth okay
[44:45] so go with me for a second and what i'm
[44:47] trying to say
[44:49] in verse eight when he had taken the
[44:51] book
[44:53] the beast and all the worship and all
[44:55] things are going on
[44:59] and they poured out the prayers of the
[45:01] saints
[45:04] and then they sing a new song right
[45:07] we know that's the bride but the prophet
[45:08] said it was right
[45:12] it's just the song of full redemption
[45:18] because this time i mean these people in
[45:20] the end time
[45:22] we see more about redemption
[45:24] than anyone has ever seen up on the
[45:26] earth
[45:28] right
[45:29] that's why i kept reading that peter
[45:32] there you know
[45:33] what they done they looked forward to
[45:35] seeing it be us that would do it not
[45:37] them
[45:40] you know speaking of us
[45:42] you said well why not something david
[45:45] david just just killing that goliath
[45:48] well that's what i told sister gail when
[45:50] years ago we started a sunday school
[45:51] class and
[45:53] he said well you know kind of what he
[45:54] won't talk to him i said
[45:56] i want you to teach each one of them
[45:58] children
[45:59] that they're a little bitty david with a
[46:01] slingshot
[46:03] and they can take down any giant that
[46:05] comes their way right
[46:07] that's the
[46:09] opening of the word
[46:11] let's see it in the correct order
[46:13] not just be good and be wonderful right
[46:16] but to see who you really are
[46:21] and so then you see
[46:26] him it's verse 10 then
[46:31] you know what's verse 10 and you'll see
[46:32] the opening of the seal
[46:34] i don't know what is the opening of
[46:35] seals
[46:37] come on the revelation of jesus christ
[46:40] true
[46:42] everybody with me all right whatever you
[46:44] want to call seal or whatever it's a
[46:46] revelation of jesus christ
[46:49] now read verse 10
[46:53] and has made us
[46:57] under our god
[47:00] kings and priests
[47:04] and we're going to reign with him on
[47:05] earth
[47:07] head back to the millennium reign
[47:09] one day on earth
[47:12] ruling rain with him for a thousand
[47:13] years
[47:15] all right
[47:16] now there's the breaking of the seals
[47:18] because there's a reveal in jesus christ
[47:20] the revealing of jesus christ if you
[47:22] remember all that i've taught you if not
[47:24] i would go back and read listen
[47:28] we are the revelation of jesus christ
[47:32] we the bride of christ
[47:34] or
[47:35] the revelation we're the revelation of
[47:37] god made known for the hour that we're
[47:39] living
[47:40] where christ made manifest right
[47:43] in another form called the bride right
[47:45] and that bride can sing a new song
[47:48] they couldn't sing the song now come on
[47:50] listen they couldn't sing the song
[47:52] before redemption
[47:54] back in the ages because there was no
[47:56] way to get this body redeemed that's
[47:58] right
[48:00] their songs of redemption was like i
[48:02] said that wesley then would sing
[48:05] i know it was the blood
[48:09] when we're not saved by the blood
[48:12] right
[48:13] we're kept saved by the blood right
[48:15] right amen it's the life that's in the
[48:16] blood that saves us
[48:19] see they sang the song to their age in
[48:21] their time
[48:22] we sing the song the redemption for body
[48:25] spirit and soul
[48:28] our whole being
[48:30] right right never has been an age
[48:34] that the whole being could probably be
[48:35] brought into view
[48:37] right
[48:38] what if the rapture had taken place
[48:40] before this age
[48:43] then you would have
[48:45] they would have had because we would be
[48:46] there
[48:47] they would have had to have a new body
[48:50] because they wouldn't know how to redeem
[48:51] it
[48:53] but we're in the plan of redemption
[48:55] that's right
[48:57] the seals
[48:59] revealed a complete plan of redemption
[49:01] right
[49:02] i'm quoting brother brown they reveal
[49:04] what was what is and what shall be
[49:06] so the entire journey of man upon the
[49:08] earth is revealed in those seals right
[49:12] so are you chasing the journey of
[49:15] god through the seals or rejection the
[49:17] journey of the antichrist
[49:19] right
[49:20] we try to see him
[49:23] which one is it
[49:26] but you see verse 10 he says
[49:29] you've made us priests and kings
[49:31] you've made us
[49:33] what you was
[49:36] come on is that true we are what he was
[49:39] is he that has made us not we ourselves
[49:41] amen
[49:42] right it's the beginning of the creation
[49:45] of god
[49:46] the seventh church age revelation 3 14
[49:49] the prophet said we're the continuation
[49:51] of that creation
[49:54] he said this is a revelation of god in
[49:57] his church
[50:00] and god in his church becomes so real
[50:02] and connected to god it can be called a
[50:05] lamb
[50:07] all right
[50:09] with seven hearts and seven eyes that's
[50:12] right
[50:14] can you have a book in his hand
[50:18] that that book can be the believers
[50:20] that's in the word amen
[50:24] yep
[50:26] being the believers in the word then we
[50:28] can see ourselves
[50:33] and follow it right out to the end
[50:37] the brotherhood said this is the actual
[50:39] opening of themselves
[50:41] now what's he talking about now
[50:45] because i realize even after preaching
[50:47] that part about it
[50:49] that you're probably still thinking
[50:50] what's he talking about
[50:54] you see church
[50:57] you are the bride of jesus christ
[51:02] and god told abraham one day
[51:06] he said how can i hold anything from him
[51:10] seeing he's the heir of all time
[51:13] well now how can he hold anything from
[51:15] you and i seeing that we're his bride
[51:18] we're his wife we're his
[51:20] children we're his offspring we're all
[51:23] of the things that are preached about
[51:24] back there because we are him made
[51:27] manifest in another form
[51:29] amen
[51:31] is he going to hold anything from us
[51:36] now that's right in 1963 a man went to
[51:39] arizona
[51:40] and god came down and spoke to that man
[51:43] and told him to come back to
[51:44] jeffersonville because of visions and
[51:46] things
[51:51] he said it'll be told you then what
[51:52] these seals are
[51:56] now i ask you a simple question
[52:00] he comes back home he preaches what
[52:02] seven nights or so whatever
[52:05] like sunday through sunday or whatever
[52:07] it turns out
[52:08] and he preaches the seals
[52:14] all right
[52:16] was those seals in the manifestation
[52:19] when he preached them
[52:24] if he was when turk were
[52:26] we had a lot of problems
[52:28] right
[52:30] because the fifth one is to israel and
[52:32] right that's right
[52:33] a lot of that is to take place after we
[52:35] get out of here
[52:37] and the sixth one is the tribulation
[52:39] period
[52:40] and we certainly don't want to thank you
[52:41] where's our yet
[52:44] so then there must be a difference
[52:45] between the actual
[52:47] happening under a seal
[52:50] that is opened up and you look at it
[52:53] and the fact that god could speak to a
[52:56] prophet
[52:58] and tell him what those things are
[53:07] you listening
[53:11] there would be a vast difference between
[53:13] it
[53:14] because when the prophet would stand
[53:16] here and tell you what that is
[53:19] he wouldn't tell you
[53:21] we're already there
[53:26] we don't want to be there
[53:30] but he told us what's going to be there
[53:32] just like we can look at it and see
[53:35] you know what we'd see just want to be
[53:37] there
[53:38] that's right
[53:43] you can see why now so many years i've
[53:45] tried to express to you
[53:48] that the seals are israel
[53:50] amen
[53:54] the seals don't take place until after
[53:56] we get out of here
[54:00] the first seal is the man of sin sitting
[54:02] in the temple of god showing himself to
[54:03] be asked god that's what your prophet
[54:05] said it was
[54:07] what do we
[54:08] see now we're going to go back in the
[54:11] seals as we've done back in 79 when i
[54:14] preached on them the first time we're
[54:15] just going to try to go back into them
[54:16] and just pick up where the antichrist
[54:18] comes from where it happens and what
[54:20] takes place you know they can't be a man
[54:22] of sin to sit in the temple of god join
[54:25] himself to be as god or the beast
[54:28] until he first is a
[54:30] saying a doctrine
[54:32] antichrist spirit
[54:35] pro you know false prophet or prophet
[54:37] false prophet
[54:39] um
[54:40] incarnate false prophet
[54:43] and then he can become the beast after
[54:45] we leave out here
[54:46] you can't be the beast while we're here
[54:49] let's contour the scripture
[54:51] that's right
[54:52] all right
[54:53] so then
[54:55] we can look and see where that come from
[54:59] and we can see where it's going
[55:01] right
[55:04] but we're certainly not back where it
[55:06] started
[55:07] 2 000 years ago
[55:10] and we're certainly not wanting to be
[55:12] over there where it ends
[55:14] in reality
[55:17] but if you see that man of sin walk in
[55:19] that temple of god over there
[55:22] wherever you want to put it
[55:24] if he walks in there
[55:26] you don't miss the rapture
[55:28] right
[55:32] so then the breaking of the seagulls is
[55:35] the revelation
[55:37] to be revealed to the bride of jesus
[55:39] christ right amen
[55:42] and you understand it
[55:43] the revealing of the seals the breaking
[55:45] of the seals that god could break
[55:48] do that well he broke them two thousand
[55:51] years ago that's in the bible
[55:54] the lamb broke the seal we'll get to
[55:55] that he broke the seal in the bible
[55:59] there you know two thousand years ago
[56:01] but a prophet could be revealed what
[56:03] that is
[56:05] and he could tell us because we are
[56:08] the bride
[56:11] so we can be told the whole journey by
[56:13] the way by the way
[56:16] and we don't have to be here when it
[56:18] takes place
[56:20] right no
[56:21] we don't have to be here with the stars
[56:23] right
[56:25] we see who we are
[56:30] just what's happening to revelation 5.
[56:35] you realize in revelations 5
[56:38] you are going to be standing there
[56:42] the glorious decked out wonderful
[56:44] beautiful
[56:45] bride of christ
[56:48] right you agree relationship five we're
[56:50] already in glory come on now
[56:53] man supper whatever you want to put it
[56:56] you're gonna be there eternal body
[56:58] spirit soul amen yes sir
[57:01] but it's because you become the word
[57:03] here yeah right
[57:05] or we don't go there right
[57:07] now
[57:09] and in doing that he can say
[57:11] i'm going to show you
[57:14] now do you remember the messages yes
[57:17] i'm going to take you not down on earth
[57:22] i'm going to take your revelations
[57:26] i kept asking that question right yes
[57:29] could god take your revelation and go
[57:31] convert the jews with it he's going to
[57:33] take your revelation
[57:37] and come back to earth to two witnesses
[57:40] right amen
[57:41] remember how i emphasize it yes
[57:47] they will be told
[57:49] that jesus christ was almighty god right
[57:52] right and they'll realize
[57:54] they have crucified him right
[57:57] right
[57:58] and they'll say where did you get them
[58:00] nail prints
[58:02] in your hands
[58:05] he'll stay in the house
[58:07] in other words you say you
[58:09] your representative your people rejected
[58:12] me
[58:14] and crucified me
[58:16] i am the very god of glory
[58:22] told you when i'm late
[58:24] whether you agree or not that's all
[58:25] right i'm just crazy
[58:29] but when they tell them
[58:32] those two witnesses tell them jews
[58:38] you missed the right of sonship
[58:41] because of your rejecting me
[58:45] and crucifying me you rejected the wrong
[58:47] sonship
[58:48] and it went to the gentiles
[58:50] right now they're going to go weak
[58:53] because they realize they can never be
[58:56] a changing of the situation
[59:01] they'll pull aside and
[59:02] weep because sure they killed their
[59:05] savior
[59:06] but mainly because they actually
[59:09] killed their own right or some ship
[59:11] they destroyed their route
[59:13] of sonship
[59:15] you can't blame somebody else they won't
[59:18] get mad at the gentiles
[59:20] right because they accepted it
[59:25] they'll see they rejected it themselves
[59:27] right
[59:29] you said well the poor people over right
[59:31] now go over and try to tell them about
[59:32] jesus
[59:34] and see if they're not still rejected
[59:36] come on
[59:38] the bible says that the veil is over
[59:41] their heart
[59:42] until this time
[59:47] all right
[59:49] they can't even see the nail prints hey
[59:50] look say
[59:51] you know you now come on
[59:53] you go over there right now and you tell
[59:54] some in jews
[59:56] i want you to look at
[59:58] something now you're listening
[1:00:02] get the point
[1:00:03] you go over there now and you say
[1:00:06] there it is in the word
[1:00:09] would you agree
[1:00:11] that you just killed this man
[1:00:13] call jesus and they'd say yes
[1:00:18] come on
[1:00:19] because they did history proves it
[1:00:22] their own rules their own writings their
[1:00:24] own doings prove that they killed that
[1:00:26] man
[1:00:28] they'd be glad to say it
[1:00:30] we sure did because he was a blasphemer
[1:00:33] yeah
[1:00:35] he was he was
[1:00:38] a devil a bounty bug right
[1:00:50] did you jews kill jesus the man that you
[1:00:53] call jesus whether or not you talk about
[1:00:55] it being guard and accident we leave
[1:00:56] that out of it i just want to know did
[1:00:58] you people kill jesus
[1:01:00] and they'd say yes
[1:01:02] and said we ought to kill him
[1:01:08] because he didn't believe he was god
[1:01:11] but when they come to the realization
[1:01:13] that they did kill god
[1:01:17] it'd be a horrible time
[1:01:22] right
[1:01:24] wouldn't it be something brother marlow
[1:01:26] for you
[1:01:29] i'm making a story okay
[1:01:32] and
[1:01:34] our old brother bill
[1:01:36] does my brother bill he's
[1:01:41] he was a girl brother loved him
[1:01:43] he probably liked this story but
[1:01:47] now you'd say well
[1:01:49] daddy
[1:01:50] i want my money
[1:01:54] you owe me some money
[1:01:57] you're rich
[1:01:59] and you owe me some money
[1:02:03] bill is saved son you don't need it
[1:02:05] right now
[1:02:06] now is that not the product for some
[1:02:07] story it can't come following
[1:02:13] and richard would say well i'll tell you
[1:02:14] what i'll do i'll just go
[1:02:16] make sure i'll be doing a lot of that
[1:02:18] today right right you better not take
[1:02:21] out a lot of insurance
[1:02:26] i see some wives with eyeballs rolling
[1:02:28] up
[1:02:31] i don't have a lot of insurance right
[1:02:33] there i don't mean that wrong
[1:02:36] but get the story
[1:02:39] and there you go kill your daddy
[1:02:42] to try to get an inheritance
[1:02:49] and you find that that inheritance
[1:02:52] we had stipulations in it
[1:02:56] that inheritance would say
[1:02:59] i have other children
[1:03:02] some of the boys
[1:03:04] you immediately would be downhearted
[1:03:06] because you figure you're gonna have to
[1:03:07] cut it when it's both for five ways or
[1:03:09] something all the kids
[1:03:11] go out divide it up about five ways
[1:03:14] man i don't lost a whole lot i'm still
[1:03:15] very good but i haven't lost a lot
[1:03:20] but what if you come to the day of the
[1:03:22] reading of the will
[1:03:25] and in that wheel
[1:03:27] bill would say
[1:03:29] richard
[1:03:31] if you hadn't had me killed
[1:03:34] you would have got everything
[1:03:38] now wouldn't that be a down-hearted time
[1:03:41] because you know you're in trouble
[1:03:42] you're going to jail
[1:03:46] but wouldn't that be down-hearted and
[1:03:48] know that you killed the one
[1:03:50] that could give you something
[1:03:52] right that's right
[1:03:54] you know that's what they've done
[1:03:58] killed a man that could give them
[1:03:59] eternal life
[1:04:02] and then killing that man
[1:04:04] they lost everything right
[1:04:10] they deserve hell i'm not against the
[1:04:13] jews but they do
[1:04:14] but so does every gentile eternal turns
[1:04:16] down jesus christ deserves help
[1:04:19] no matter who we are
[1:04:21] but you just think about when they see
[1:04:23] him
[1:04:26] and they'll realize like joseph when he
[1:04:28] was appearing to his brethren
[1:04:31] and they realize ours the man that we
[1:04:33] don't know where
[1:04:34] right there'll be no saying well we
[1:04:36] didn't do this
[1:04:39] you know it's not mentioned of which one
[1:04:41] was it um
[1:04:43] the oldest one
[1:04:44] is in judah but no one is the oldest one
[1:04:47] anyhow the one that tried to spare
[1:04:48] joseph you remember one day one of the
[1:04:50] brother and tried to spare he was going
[1:04:52] to leave it in well hitler's sneak take
[1:04:53] him out read the bible remember the
[1:04:55] story he's gonna take him out and you
[1:04:57] know get him free
[1:04:58] right well you know he wasn't still
[1:05:00] feeling too good when he got there
[1:05:02] i don't guess he thought
[1:05:05] the other guy's gonna get it
[1:05:07] you remember when i tried to help you no
[1:05:09] i don't think you would do it
[1:05:12] i think you realize they were all in bad
[1:05:14] shape yeah that's right right
[1:05:17] you get one point when you get there
[1:05:18] there won't be no argument
[1:05:20] over what i've done and how i've been
[1:05:23] good and how i kept the word through the
[1:05:24] letter i've lived it i've been a jew for
[1:05:27] a jew all the way down
[1:05:29] a little argument
[1:05:31] they'll see they rejected jesus christ
[1:05:35] and then they'll realize they lost their
[1:05:37] own sonship
[1:05:41] but the gentiles received it
[1:05:45] see we're going to israel not as a
[1:05:46] person not as people
[1:05:48] but as the word of god that's been
[1:05:50] revealed in the last days those two
[1:05:52] witnesses are going to take this book
[1:05:55] that i preached to you for so long out
[1:05:56] of the revelations 5 about an open book
[1:05:59] and things how did it come open what
[1:06:01] happened
[1:06:03] how did it become a book how did it
[1:06:04] become closed because the book is closed
[1:06:07] in revelations 5.
[1:06:11] now where did brother around him get it
[1:06:12] anything to preach it from it closed in
[1:06:14] revelation 5.
[1:06:17] he got it from god
[1:06:19] at that word of the mystery that we
[1:06:21] gentiles would receive the complete
[1:06:24] revelation of the redemptive plan
[1:06:28] for all mankind by way of a prophet
[1:06:30] messenger yeah
[1:06:33] that's why it says it in revelation 10
[1:06:37] 1-7
[1:06:42] when it says but in the days of the
[1:06:44] voice
[1:06:46] of the seventh angel
[1:06:50] the mysteries would be revealed
[1:06:54] john you remember how tried to express
[1:06:55] it john's writing all of these things
[1:06:57] and he's thinking now how can i get this
[1:06:59] back to the church
[1:07:00] but he looks back into revelations 3 14
[1:07:03] and he realizes that's going to have to
[1:07:04] be a prophet in that age so he said he
[1:07:06] looks at it and he said how they get
[1:07:07] back he looks back and says but there's
[1:07:09] an angel that can break the word of god
[1:07:16] you see the literal happening of the
[1:07:18] seals never broke in 63.
[1:07:22] come on
[1:07:23] the literal things of what was taking
[1:07:25] place
[1:07:27] you better not happen yet
[1:07:34] with the revelation
[1:07:37] oh man
[1:07:39] the revelation no wonder that man could
[1:07:42] stand there and say i was hoping
[1:07:45] somebody would catch it
[1:07:50] he said it's been them seven angels
[1:07:53] bringing me back here for this message
[1:07:56] tonight when he got on the seventh seal
[1:08:01] those angels
[1:08:04] bringing the word down to a prophet on
[1:08:06] earth
[1:08:10] not seven angels like seven angels right
[1:08:12] not seven angels like seven spirits of
[1:08:14] god
[1:08:17] but the prophet did say
[1:08:19] the angel was the first one met him on
[1:08:21] that first night
[1:08:26] and told him what that was right
[1:08:30] that's one of the people in the message
[1:08:31] trying to make it the fact of saying
[1:08:32] brother brown met his own theophany
[1:08:35] i met his own self
[1:08:39] why do you want to go that way
[1:08:41] you're trying to make some mystery tell
[1:08:43] me what he said
[1:08:46] but forgive me for being playing i don't
[1:08:48] give a hoot how i got here
[1:08:52] that's old plain southern language i
[1:08:53] don't give a hoot i got here what i care
[1:08:55] about is what is it
[1:09:00] you come to my house you stand out in
[1:09:01] the yard you say brother dale i got you
[1:09:03] something
[1:09:07] brother dale i got you something
[1:09:09] three days later brother dale i got you
[1:09:11] something no no no bring it in the house
[1:09:13] you can't park it out in the back
[1:09:18] no cadillac in the back
[1:09:22] and we got a dodge in the front now
[1:09:24] so i got two gifts
[1:09:26] you know
[1:09:27] you have a truck in the front yard and
[1:09:28] the cadillac the backyard
[1:09:31] everybody on the internet boy they think
[1:09:32] man that guy's rich
[1:09:35] i thank god for my 2000 cadillac it's
[1:09:38] got 107 000 miles on the boat still love
[1:09:40] it
[1:09:42] oh god sitting out in the front's got
[1:09:43] 290 thousand and i still love it
[1:09:46] we ain't rich around you folks
[1:09:50] but we're rich in the gospel
[1:10:00] but get what i'm saying so revelations
[1:10:02] 10 when it says thou smite that's kings
[1:10:04] and priests
[1:10:06] right see that's what's going to israel
[1:10:08] that's right sure now actually break
[1:10:10] into the sea so it is the breaking news
[1:10:12] sure
[1:10:13] he first said it was one
[1:10:15] revelation 5
[1:10:17] was a scene preparing for the opening
[1:10:20] right you remember we read that we
[1:10:22] preached it we preached it yes now he
[1:10:24] says this is actually
[1:10:30] but remember
[1:10:32] this ain't took place yet
[1:10:36] that's in heaven
[1:10:38] sure i don't think we're there
[1:10:41] if you think we're in heaven now
[1:10:45] i'd rather preach it the other way and i
[1:10:47] don't believe it that way they are
[1:10:49] summoning this message preaching we're
[1:10:50] already in hell here
[1:10:52] but i don't quite agree with that either
[1:10:54] they preach we're already in the
[1:10:56] tribulation i don't agree with that
[1:10:57] either
[1:10:58] right
[1:11:00] but you know this has never taken place
[1:11:02] that's right we've never sung the
[1:11:04] complete plan of redemption really
[1:11:07] we're only beginning to get the verses
[1:11:09] up
[1:11:11] you know what i was thinking the other
[1:11:12] day about this kind of not to be funny
[1:11:14] but
[1:11:16] you know right around said if you get it
[1:11:17] all mixed up he said you've got
[1:11:19] a cow
[1:11:21] up in the top of a tree
[1:11:25] trying to eat grass
[1:11:30] i got to thinking about that
[1:11:33] and i thought you know what
[1:11:38] i believe we've got the cow on the
[1:11:39] ground
[1:11:42] yeah that's right
[1:11:44] grass might not be too good right now
[1:11:46] but
[1:11:48] at least i believe we've got the cow on
[1:11:50] the ground
[1:11:51] you know
[1:11:52] in other words we're in the story that's
[1:11:54] right we're in the happening we've at
[1:11:56] least got the picture right except for
[1:11:58] the brown burn up grass
[1:12:02] you'll take care of that
[1:12:04] why not cause the cows on the ground
[1:12:06] sorry about calling you a cow but that's
[1:12:08] the bride anyway
[1:12:12] but listen folks
[1:12:17] he said this is the actually
[1:12:20] the opening of the silvers
[1:12:23] now he'd already said this is the same
[1:12:25] preparing for the opening
[1:12:28] and then he finishes up
[1:12:31] but this is actually the opening
[1:12:34] say church that's to you and me that's
[1:12:36] what's taking place now
[1:12:39] this is the actual opening of the seals
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:43] after literal things that happen
[1:12:45] underneath each one of those things you
[1:12:47] know places are sealed
[1:12:50] this is the bride
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:55] this is the church the bride becoming
[1:12:57] the word
[1:12:59] amen and god has taken off of the entire
[1:13:02] bible not just the book of revelation
[1:13:04] not just of chapter 5 or 10 or whatever
[1:13:07] right he's taken the veil off the entire
[1:13:09] book
[1:13:10] right
[1:13:12] and by way of the prophet messenger has
[1:13:14] handed it down to his little bride
[1:13:25] that's right
[1:13:29] which would be the greatest if you were
[1:13:30] going to
[1:13:31] go and
[1:13:32] say brother donny you was going to
[1:13:34] go to
[1:13:37] he likes what's that down under
[1:13:39] australia he loves down there i don't
[1:13:41] know why because it's down on the other
[1:13:42] side you gotta look up but yeah
[1:13:47] wouldn't it be something if you go down
[1:13:48] there and say boy i got something i'll
[1:13:49] tell you
[1:13:53] i got permission from the united states
[1:13:55] to give you everything we got
[1:13:59] well you know that people would argue
[1:14:00] hey what's good but you know what a man
[1:14:02] can stand and look at the promise to die
[1:14:06] right right
[1:14:08] the only saying is hey you gotta give
[1:14:10] the belly something you promise the head
[1:14:11] all you want to yeah
[1:14:13] you know you can talk about what you're
[1:14:14] going to get
[1:14:15] one of these days we're going to have
[1:14:17] this
[1:14:17] but you don't have to feed you
[1:14:20] need a little bit of babies they got a
[1:14:21] whole lot more sense than we have but
[1:14:22] you know what they do they just start
[1:14:24] crying
[1:14:28] know what we do we go i try to do this
[1:14:29] try to do that maybe start crying
[1:14:35] the church
[1:14:39] instead of going over there and telling
[1:14:41] them all you give them
[1:14:44] what would it be though if you could
[1:14:45] pull up with attract loads of food
[1:14:48] to some of those countries that are
[1:14:49] starving today
[1:14:52] and you just knock up there and say eat
[1:14:53] to your heart's content
[1:14:58] that'd be a whole lot better with it
[1:15:01] and see that's what god has done for you
[1:15:02] and i right right he just didn't promise
[1:15:05] us these things
[1:15:06] he just didn't tell us what we're going
[1:15:08] to be one thing but please give it to us
[1:15:12] i sit down think about the things that
[1:15:15] maybe you don't pay no attention maybe
[1:15:16] we need to start a record of what god
[1:15:19] has done among us
[1:15:20] to get people to realize that god is
[1:15:22] with us
[1:15:24] you know
[1:15:28] just remember the things that have been
[1:15:29] testified lately that god is doing among
[1:15:32] us
[1:15:33] sure and i want to see more
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:36] i'd like to fill it with a watermelon
[1:15:38] that's good but thank you some more
[1:15:41] see church
[1:15:43] what else could you and i want
[1:15:46] than what god has given us that's right
[1:15:50] amen a million dollar
[1:15:55] a billion dollar
[1:15:59] a trillion
[1:16:01] and that would be one-twelfths what we
[1:16:03] owe
[1:16:03] i think that's around 12 trillion or
[1:16:05] something
[1:16:06] 16 trillion that'd be 1 16th of what we
[1:16:09] owe
[1:16:10] i'd be gone in the hurry
[1:16:13] but to give us eternal life
[1:16:18] and let us stay here on earth
[1:16:20] to prove
[1:16:22] yep
[1:16:23] what around them said and paraphrasing
[1:16:25] he said god's going to turn loose or
[1:16:27] allow that devil to get after that bride
[1:16:30] in the end
[1:16:31] to show that she won't fall like the
[1:16:34] first bride did
[1:16:36] you mean god's going to do it yes
[1:16:39] and you remember in the scripture
[1:16:41] he said a man among you and he
[1:16:43] prophesied
[1:16:45] and it come to pass and he leads you to
[1:16:47] another god
[1:16:48] he said i've done that to try you yeah
[1:16:56] but there wasn't everything going wrong
[1:16:58] with me i've got my turn around why is
[1:17:00] it wow
[1:17:06] biggest bunch of babies has ever been
[1:17:08] i'm talking about from the pulpit to the
[1:17:09] back
[1:17:14] you see church the most beautiful thing
[1:17:17] that god could ever think of is his
[1:17:18] bride
[1:17:20] and he's got her here in the end time to
[1:17:22] prove
[1:17:24] that she ain't falling like
[1:17:26] he fell in the garden she ain't gonna
[1:17:28] fall like they did it and i see it wrong
[1:17:30] right
[1:17:32] i know a lot of people they don't like
[1:17:33] it the way i appreciate it that's all
[1:17:34] right you go get right around and study
[1:17:36] it
[1:17:37] they say oh that prided wrong did not
[1:17:40] see it wrong didn't fall she left went
[1:17:42] home yeah looked around and said
[1:17:44] quote
[1:17:46] they already had gotten the thought and
[1:17:49] they took it home with them
[1:17:51] and that caused the downfall
[1:17:55] of the little bride of
[1:17:56] christ yep all right
[1:18:00] you see
[1:18:02] we just need to believe all that amen
[1:18:08] but can you see see the book of
[1:18:09] revelations is laid out it's not before
[1:18:11] you got to move this back over here and
[1:18:13] get this over here and pull that over
[1:18:15] here and bring that over here
[1:18:20] the prophet said that the ends and the
[1:18:21] butts was in the right way
[1:18:29] listen church
[1:18:31] let me just say this and quit
[1:18:40] the seals
[1:18:43] is not a revelation of another god
[1:18:48] there's not a god there and a god here
[1:18:50] in the goddard one day there's no wonder
[1:18:51] brad and one
[1:18:53] there's only one true living god
[1:18:58] brother ryan says if it comes down to
[1:19:00] the word that it's christ
[1:19:02] in the
[1:19:06] further
[1:19:07] revelation of the one and sign god
[1:19:10] living in his church
[1:19:16] not another god
[1:19:18] same god
[1:19:21] here in bride form
[1:19:26] still revealing himself
[1:19:29] i thought we'd believe what he said in
[1:19:31] christ the mystery the brightest part of
[1:19:32] the mystery must be revealed that's
[1:19:34] right
[1:19:35] i thought we believed that the prophet
[1:19:37] when he got into the church book is
[1:19:38] where i was looking trying to find it
[1:19:39] there got it on the note
[1:19:41] the word this is the capstone revelation
[1:19:43] of himself in this generation this last
[1:19:45] days is the capstone revelation yes
[1:19:48] of jesus christ what is the capstone
[1:19:50] revelation of jesus christ
[1:19:54] revelations 5 verse 10
[1:19:57] that he hath made us priests and kings
[1:20:00] right
[1:20:01] we are that part of god that's revealed
[1:20:03] in the last days
[1:20:05] amen to be made manifest to face satan
[1:20:09] the satan you're going to have to back
[1:20:11] off
[1:20:14] you're going to have to step back oh boy
[1:20:17] now can i tie it together for a second
[1:20:19] with this morning then
[1:20:22] has god spoke to you in your heart
[1:20:25] after all these years and say
[1:20:29] you are my bride
[1:20:32] you are the people in the end time
[1:20:35] but not another group to come not
[1:20:36] another generation
[1:20:41] the world can't stand another generation
[1:20:44] now i didn't say the bride i said the
[1:20:45] world came right right amen
[1:20:49] i mean
[1:20:50] another few years and we're all going to
[1:20:52] be without a home that's right whether
[1:20:54] you own it or not
[1:20:56] you're going to be without one
[1:20:58] you're going to have them foreclosure
[1:20:59] signs sitting on the front
[1:21:01] and the only ones that's going to own
[1:21:03] them houses
[1:21:04] is the ones that goes over and takes the
[1:21:09] lead up are the form of bringing the
[1:21:11] antichrist into being so be careful what
[1:21:14] you're signing
[1:21:18] i've told you before they're already
[1:21:19] saying that a lot of your subdivisions
[1:21:22] you cannot have no worship service in
[1:21:24] your home
[1:21:29] why because
[1:21:31] they've done past so long you say they
[1:21:33] can't do that
[1:21:38] you signed the paper
[1:21:40] yeah yep come on you signed the paper
[1:21:43] that's all he gonna do when you say
[1:21:44] something say is that your signature
[1:21:48] well you signed it
[1:21:52] just like i told you
[1:21:54] you can't start a church in this city
[1:21:57] without being accepted by churches in
[1:21:59] this city
[1:22:02] the regards one of them
[1:22:04] they couldn't get it
[1:22:06] he had to go from a baptist to a church
[1:22:08] of god or something to get permission to
[1:22:10] even have them in church right over
[1:22:11] there you say they can't do that to us
[1:22:14] don't they already have
[1:22:15] because you signed it away yourself
[1:22:18] yep
[1:22:24] always watch one thing
[1:22:26] i'm not a governmental man i'm not what
[1:22:28] is that liberal or whatever
[1:22:34] conservative
[1:22:35] or a liberal i don't even know what it
[1:22:37] means
[1:22:39] honestly i figure conservative means it
[1:22:41] conserves
[1:22:42] but a liberal just gives it away i
[1:22:44] figure that might be what it is i don't
[1:22:46] know
[1:22:47] but listen church
[1:22:52] you watch when they pass into
[1:22:55] laws especially
[1:22:57] when they're going to pass one on social
[1:22:59] security again pretty quick
[1:23:04] you need to find out what the writer
[1:23:06] bills are
[1:23:08] you know what a rider bill is
[1:23:10] a rider bill is stuck on we've got
[1:23:12] people here who work for government
[1:23:14] knows that's the law that stuck onto
[1:23:17] that law if this law prices that law
[1:23:19] passes
[1:23:21] automatic
[1:23:23] so they'll attach all these things right
[1:23:25] over there and you're going to vote
[1:23:29] to make sure you get your social
[1:23:31] security
[1:23:34] and you're going to vote away your
[1:23:35] rights
[1:23:37] that's right brother you're right
[1:23:42] we're selling ourselves off
[1:23:46] and listen i'm not talking about the
[1:23:48] worldly denomination of people i'm not
[1:23:51] preaching out there i'm talking about
[1:23:53] what are you and i going to do
[1:23:58] what are you going to do when
[1:24:00] grandma can't get social security
[1:24:02] anymore
[1:24:04] terrence said they're going to put me in
[1:24:05] the in a nursing home
[1:24:08] but what's he going to do with his money
[1:24:12] so when mine runs out he is going to run
[1:24:15] we're gonna do
[1:24:18] grandma can't get social security you're
[1:24:20] gonna take grandma back home
[1:24:21] you need to pay grandma's medical bills
[1:24:25] see
[1:24:26] it's all coming in so
[1:24:29] until you voted your way into where we
[1:24:31] are
[1:24:33] and then like me i turn and say not me
[1:24:35] brother because i don't even vote well
[1:24:37] that's just as bad
[1:24:40] amen
[1:24:41] do not vote it's just as bad as the vote
[1:24:46] i understand that i just don't know who
[1:24:48] to vote for
[1:24:50] amen
[1:24:55] i mean who do you want this next race
[1:24:58] come on they're listening to all that so
[1:24:59] i'm going to listen
[1:25:01] you know
[1:25:01] government can listen all this stuff any
[1:25:03] way they want to
[1:25:04] when are you going to vote for the
[1:25:05] president we've got are you going to
[1:25:07] vote for whoever wrongly or what who are
[1:25:09] you going to vote for
[1:25:11] i wish axonomatics had come up and
[1:25:13] started running again
[1:25:14] i might even go register to vote for him
[1:25:19] listen church
[1:25:23] that's right
[1:25:24] think about it
[1:25:28] no seals
[1:25:30] we'll get into it and see it
[1:25:32] they're going to be broken when we get
[1:25:34] out of here in reality
[1:25:36] but they've already been
[1:25:39] because they was broke 2 000 years ago
[1:25:43] that's right the bible said the lamb
[1:25:45] took the book
[1:25:46] that had to be
[1:25:48] 1895-96 if no word left
[1:25:52] well that's what it was written
[1:25:55] the lamb took the book and broke the
[1:25:56] first seal second there the same lamb
[1:25:58] broke ever see
[1:26:00] it says when the salad seed was opened
[1:26:02] so it was opened 2000 years ago
[1:26:07] all right amen
[1:26:09] revealed to a prophet
[1:26:11] that spoke to us to tell us what it is
[1:26:14] and then one of these days
[1:26:16] literally things will start taking place
[1:26:21] when the actual seal itself is fully
[1:26:23] broken
[1:26:27] you can't beat the beast until you and i
[1:26:29] get out of here
[1:26:32] all right let's get close
[1:26:34] yep amen right come on absolutely
[1:26:38] back on these things as we try to finish
[1:26:40] this part up with revelation 5 then
[1:26:42] we'll go under maybe revelation 6. and i
[1:26:44] said may hit those seals one two three
[1:26:46] four maybe get them all together in one
[1:26:48] or whatever to do
[1:26:54] but i just want you to see
[1:26:58] there's a difference a vast difference
[1:27:00] between
[1:27:01] the breaking of a seal
[1:27:03] make it known of a seal an actual
[1:27:06] happening one of the things under that
[1:27:08] seal when it takes place
[1:27:10] there's a vast difference
[1:27:13] people arguing whether the seals are
[1:27:15] broken or especially itself the bible
[1:27:16] said it was open 2000 years ago
[1:27:22] well we don't know what it is
[1:27:24] oh
[1:27:25] he was fixing to say we don't know
[1:27:27] whether this is right or not
[1:27:31] well then you're questioning the word
[1:27:32] that's right
[1:27:34] right
[1:27:36] maybe it remembers about
[1:27:41] well 77 78 somewhere 77.
[1:27:47] he said when brother brown said that he
[1:27:48] predicted i said you thought it was
[1:27:50] prophesy which
[1:27:52] was i've heard sermons preached it
[1:27:54] it had to be by the end
[1:27:58] you know
[1:27:59] ridiculed by saying that we could pass
[1:28:01] by there
[1:28:03] but we have
[1:28:06] then come along about
[1:28:08] 80.
[1:28:11] and they started in the end well we got
[1:28:12] to get out of here by what 84 or
[1:28:15] something because of the israel and the
[1:28:17] 44 and i mean 46 and and 48.
[1:28:21] and then we're arguing that
[1:28:23] you know that would have been 86 or 88.
[1:28:26] he come on down and i told you i said
[1:28:28] first off you question what the prophet
[1:28:30] was saying
[1:28:32] second off you're questioning whether
[1:28:33] dates will be correct whatever's taking
[1:28:35] place but i said the third thing when it
[1:28:37] passes 2000 you're going to question
[1:28:40] the word of god
[1:28:45] and that's on tape
[1:28:48] because now people are questioning
[1:28:50] whether the word is right or not
[1:28:53] people of this message we say
[1:28:56] are questioning whether the bible is
[1:28:58] right that's right
[1:29:00] they've already declared that the
[1:29:02] prophet was all messed up
[1:29:04] and you can't keep up with dates and
[1:29:06] times and governments so now if people
[1:29:08] are beginning to question me
[1:29:12] your total defense has been destroyed
[1:29:18] you better have
[1:29:19] that still small voice
[1:29:21] that i spoke of this morning that one
[1:29:24] that spoke to your heart
[1:29:26] and no matter what they do if they burn
[1:29:28] the bible and burn all the books they
[1:29:30] can't burn what's in mine
[1:29:37] why because it's being revealed
[1:29:39] listen
[1:29:42] what do we got brother number 116.
[1:29:48] we're
[1:29:49] floating down
[1:29:59] oh
[1:30:15] me
[1:30:22] is
[1:30:43] shall we
[1:30:44] shall be
[1:30:56] where she
[1:31:03] is
[1:31:17] is
[1:31:42] don't worry
[1:31:52] is
[1:32:23] oh
[1:32:49] get out of here
[1:32:58] oh
[1:33:13] oh
[1:33:34] girls
[1:33:36] is
[1:33:56] now
[1:34:06] oh
[1:34:20] sometimes
[1:34:58] is
[1:35:26] if oh
[1:35:54] again
[1:36:00] oh
[1:36:19] shall be
[1:36:49] is
[1:37:28] is
[1:37:43] everybody
[1:38:07] is
[1:39:09] that told me in the beginning
[1:39:12] has brought me to where i'm at
[1:39:15] and i still depend upon that one
[1:39:18] to speak to me
[1:39:20] and keep me going
[1:39:23] but it's always been the same
[1:39:24] he said well i know brother dale has
[1:39:26] been god well
[1:39:27] that's what i guess already took two or
[1:39:29] three services this morning but
[1:39:31] you know sometimes we can think god is
[1:39:32] leading us when we really don't realize
[1:39:34] it
[1:39:35] we might find out the devil's in charge
