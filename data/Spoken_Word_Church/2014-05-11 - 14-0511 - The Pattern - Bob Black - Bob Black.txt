TRANSCRIPT
========================================
like a little a little thing that do we have in here it's on that camera somewhere yeah you can't say it though yeah i guess that's nice all right so let's turn back to exodus 25 and read the first nine verses again and we're gonna finish on verse nine and then we're gonna go over to colossians 1 26 and 27 but before we do that let's go to the lord and pray real quick lord god we thank you god for your grace to us we thank you most of all for the truth lord jesus that you've given it to us because lord we know that this is how we become into the stature of a perfect man god i pray that she'll be with us today lord open our hearts to hear your word and god grant the lord it's going to remember the services today and remember us all the ones that couldn't be here today lord jesus yeah touch the ones that are needful lord we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ a little bit more i'm kidding all right exodus 25 verse 1 and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart he shall take my offering you know all the children of israel had to bring their offering willfully right and that's if i could stress anything in this little lesson this morning that would be to offer up your own ideas so that god can deliver you of you because that's what hinders us all is our own ideas our own when we when we come and we'll we prefer to take our own ideas instead of god's word right then that is what henry just said more than not now what i'm what i'm about to say uh if you would like the proof of it then i would like to refer you to read hebrews 5 and hebrews 9 and the message brought around priests in 1963 look which is uh he says things and that sermon is way more profound maybe than than what i'll get into now but that that sermon is just just listen to that sermon and think about what i'm about to speak on so they brought the the things to build the tabernacle willingly but not holding back not like ananiasis fire that they uh made like a show that they were they were real christians and and uh put on some kind of public show where in private they were withholding things but they gave willfully that god's plan and purpose could be brought to pass and this is the offering which he shall take of them gold and silver and brass not just not just like a little cheap thing but he took the most prized possessions the best that they had to offer and this is the offer in which he shall take it in gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goat's hair and ram skins dyed red and bad their skins that's your teamwood all for the life spices for anointing oil for sweet incense onyx stones and stones that you said in the ephod and in the breastplate look what i think is just so amazing they didn't know what was going to happen with all these things that they were giving but god had a plan and purpose that for every one of these things that the onyx stones the things that would be make up the breastplate everything had a predestinated plan and purpose that everything went right into even though they didn't realize it and i i think that in the message look brother brown talks about how we should be prayerful that we can see god's plan and purpose and align ourselves because in our own in our own carnal mind you how how are we supposed to know uh how do you know who to marry who which church to go to what where to move what different things in your life that god can direct you and move you we sh that we should be spirit led or spirit land people because the little things in your life as god moves you down life's path you may not realize how things are gonna line up and he said and then let them and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them according to all now that's a scripture to remember that i may dwell among them according to all that i shall show thee that according to all that i show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it now that's what i want to talk about this morning the pattern of the tabernacle because i believe that god showed that god took moses up into the mountain red where he took him up into the mouth and with a cloud and and and uh it reminds you something else that there was a cloud that came on the mountain and the prophet of god was taken up and when he was up there god showed him the plan now we know brother branham was taken up by the angels and he didn't know the mysteries of the seven seals until he returned back but it followed the same kind of pattern he was taken up into the cloud taken up and here god showed moses the pattern and i believe the pattern that he showed moses was not just something like a scroll a piece of paper or something but he showed him a heavenly pattern of the completed what the completed tabernacle would look like it was already finished when moses saw it what he saw was and maybe just to create a little dramatization maybe moses could actually walk through it and observe because look at all the details that that moses came back with right he the details of every little thing of how the tabernacle should be constructed because they were all very important every little detail and if you look in the message look brother branham stress and just all through the message of how just one word off you get your own carnal idea right you start thinking well maybe this candlestick doesn't need to knock or maybe this uh this uh the euro thurman doesn't need as many uh little onyx stones or a little stump different kind of stone maybe we can lose this jasper stone out of it but it won't work because it's got to match god's plan and purpose it's got to match his pattern and you can see how that down uh you you can see how that uh god's reasonable plan and purpose is kind of revealed there in genesis 1 26 27 there was the pattern and that heavenly pattern was brought down to earth and adam walked out when that spirit man was put into a body and began to be made manifest and you can see how that god just looking at the pattern how the pattern was brought to earth that god is not a trinity like three different people because here comes the pattern made manifest and one man walks out this is matching the pattern god's not like you you can see you can see uh god as he makes himself manifest in in the earth to see the heavenly pattern you can see who god is and how he is by looking at how he make makes himself manifest and all down through scripture that the natural shows what's in the heavens in first john 5 7 8 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy the holy ghost and these 301 and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit in the water and the blood and these three agree to one there's a heavenly and there's a natural because god is taking that heavenly pattern and revealing himself in the natural and look at this little scripture now just for a second how is he revealing the father the word in the holy ghost by the uh water blood and spirit he's taking those three and so that he can take himself and put himself in the flesh and make himself made manifest now let me uh let me go over to let's go over to i said we're going to read colossians 1 26.7 and i completely forgot about that for a second so let's go over to colossians now this is uh this is the scripture i believe that i think it's really interesting because i kind of believe that colossians 1 26 27 parallels genesis 4 26 27 now here's the pattern that we're talking about the pattern in the heavens that god is trying to make manifest right and all down through the through the ages this was a mystery that nobody really understood now as they brought the onyx stones and all the the gold and silver and all these things they had no idea what god's real plan and purpose was they were just following the leading of their messenger and uh you know down as brother branham brought the message for years i i feel like many uh didn't really understand what the purpose was that he said right about the coming of the lord the the seals would be revealed and it seems to me like that the this this uh little gospel train that we're on is moving faster and faster and pick it up more and more speed and the things that used to be kind of mysterious now are becoming so plain right for me anyway but it's just becoming wide open that all these little mysteries are are completely unveiled they used to be hidden and that's uh you know the gospel is preached in a public way jesus said i didn't i didn't come in secret i didn't i didn't come you know it's just put out for everybody to see but it's in your private secret place right where this the hidden misters are made known to you and that's why it can be revealed to you and not somebody else that's sitting right next to you that's hearing the same teaching it's because it's got to be a personal relationship and that's what this tabernacle was really speaking of it was speaking of god coming down and dwelling in a human vessel first christ and then you so that he can make that time that pattern in the heavens may manifest in your earth so colossians 1 26 27 okay uh let me start at verse 25 whereof i am made a mystery according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to the saints amen now the mystery is not do's and don'ts it's not uh that women should dress right and and not cut their hair and yeah and that uh clothesline gospel right the mystery will make you do that right right you're going to fulfill that that's right that's what the mystery is right i'm going to say that one more time let me do that one more time the mystery of god the pattern coming and dwelling in the human flesh will make you will bring to pass the clothesline gospel in your life that's what will make you dress right and walk right and live right and do right that's what the lived voices is that we're going to talk about that's the live the voice of god living out in his people's minds amen it's not it's not just a closed line that is god dwelling in human flesh amen even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints amen you should be so thankful that you see this mystery because there are so many even around this place i believe that do not see this mystery see how you can paul is all plainly spoken right but you can read these words and not understand that's why it's preached perfectly but if you don't have a personal revelation right of what's being preached it's got to and of course the words got to be shown in the field before the spirit can make it and bring it to life that's why that's why the preaching of the gospel is so important yes all right verse 27 to whom god will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles now if you just want a little taste of the riches of the glory of this mystery then go listen to that sermon look right i just want to encourage that that sermon among the gentiles which is what is what is the mystery this mystery that's been hidden christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man and all wisdom let me just finish up with this because i wasn't planning but that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus whereunto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mindly and i like that because even if nobody else's belief even if even if nobody you know what if what if uh a thousand people heard me preach it and only one person came to the lord and and saw this mystery that i i believe that's that's worth it just for that one soul because absolutely if all the world says that that this is wrong that this is incorrect and and calls you names and you know the early apostles they they encountered it wonderful they're privileged to be to be uh scourged and struck and all those things it's so now look look how god back in the beginning he he he he worked through a process to bring this pattern down to earth and he even in the days of creation he started through a process and look how in this day it kind of it kind of parallels him and just bear with me a second now follow me because now as god began to create move in his creation first thing he did maybe was he uh gave life to a little fishy and then a little moved up a little bit and and he said uh looked out into the trees and said uh i want a squirrel right there and but then he moved into what his real plan and purpose was was to bring that pattern down into human flesh so that he could have fellowship and so god spoke and that pattern came down and walked in adam in human flesh i hope you can see what what god is doing with it right with this smash is today right how brother branham came and he spoke to a little fishy right and brought it to life and then he spoke to the squirrels and said a little fish a little squirrel is going to run out on the limb over there but then what really is happening the whole plan and purpose is for god for that pattern to come down and leaving us right right and that pattern cannot be complete if you add your own idea if you add if you think and you know we can have really good ideas we're gonna have really what seems to be like a good idea i think it would be a good idea just for example for me to go work for such a such company or for me to go do such a thing i think it will be good but some many times those ideas are are fraught with peril and don't end up in the right way but in everything in your life if you will seek the will of god and if you read the message look because in that brother branham says and he's quoting how brother branham said that if uh or jesus said if i if you're in me and my words abide in you right then ask what you will and it will be given to you why why is that so because you're asking according to what's in the pattern and the pattern is already finished man what's in the pattern the pattern is already complete that's right you know what the pattern is is your inheritance right right it's your it's your body change it's your healing a happy marriage it's everything that god has laid out for you so that he so that the pattern his plan and purpose can be made manifest in your earth and i'm trying to make where the message looked 1963 that's right um so you know as the children of israel journey through the wilderness they you know they failed to meet that pattern when they got to cades barnea but then as they moved on and and the the ones that failed to believe uh died off they began to get more and more locked in locksteps and i believe that if you read in joshua and different chapters in bible to talk about their approach to the to the jordan river it just thrills me to see how they begin to move more and more in lockstep in perfect harmony with the message and with a message for their day until when they when i i believe when rehab maybe looked across the river and she saw them moving with the word in the middle and the pillar of fire leaving them and signs and wonders following and everything was just perfectly in line she saw there so that's what i see i see the pattern living and i want to be like that that that is something that attracted her so they the the pattern was that they were conforming to the pattern of their day but the pattern was still not that that's not what god's plan and purpose was the pattern was not real did not really begin to be made manifest until one day mary said be it unto me according to thy word and that just her saying that whatever whatever the aim the messenger says i agree with it and that allowed the pattern to be to the the the pattern was christ himself let's let you know let me we don't have much time left so i'm going to jump ahead and read some of these quotes about what the pattern is because you know brother brown talked about that that god chooses us by the pattern and there's all these quotes about how he he cut out the pattern and you know for you when i was growing up you know it's like how did well is it random is he choosing the pattern randomly like cutting it out he didn't mean a mighty mother so ephesians one to four as courtney as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love amen he chose us because he saw us in that pattern before the foundation of the world having predestinated us under the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the pleasure of his will and the infallibility of god spoken word in 1956 he cannot deceive those whose names have been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world the same god that spoke and christ was crucified before the foundation of the world the same one called you at that time and wrote your name in the book that doesn't that just make you through all the all the things button out now the pattern with all the little knobs and all the little things all those details and you were in that pattern if i'm kind of dramatizing a little bit if you could take that tabernacle because the tabernacle is is representative of what the real pattern is and where you know this this pyramid on the wall is representative of the pattern but if you take take that tabernacle that symbolizes a three-part being a body spirit and soul stand it up right and what do you have you have christ right and that's what we're trying to conform to we're trying to conform to christ to the image of the living god so god places the pattern in 1954 questions and answers um while jesus told the disciples that he was with them and he had chosen and knew them before the foundation of the world was ever laid is that right so god places the pattern and he said now they're being elite they'll go in the rapture and there'll be a group of people that's good upright holy living god said people that will not be in the rapture and they'll come up in the second resurrection because now they they don't go all the way this is me for them saying they don't go all the way through justification and satisfaction they're bashing the holy ghost to meet to conform to that pattern because that's the way to to get into that pattern you must be in him i'm trying to hurry and events made clear by prophecy 1965 he says see the world and the people are watching for some little outlet some little bypass some little shortcut but there's no shortcuts in the word of god you must you got to come by he has he has provided away all the little steps and he says there's there's one pattern you must cut yourself and fit that pattern not try to cut the pattern to fit you right that's right everybody must do that that's the only way god has of doing it so what is our pattern the marriage of the lamb 1962 and no wonder people says they haven't got what they say they've got this church of the pentecostal move off to be so bound together with the power of almighty god until the very life of jesus christ will be reflected in it why is that if the pattern that heavenly pattern is living in you then you will be exactly like that pattern you know the early church the defeat in ephesians when paul began to preach that we all look back to that because that is our pattern we've got to compare back to that the same god that was back there doing signs and wonders and and preaching the word and doing those things should be living in our lives today right but we want the pattern after the world he says we're going to do it anyhow in that something we're going to do it anyhow that's our problem is we'll get something in our eye and our mind or something would think it's a good idea and it sounds real good and we won't go back and compare it with the word right right right and you know what to be honest that kind of it scares me i think in a good way when i am studying to come out and preach because i'm afraid that maybe i'm remembering something that is just a table book or something that i heard i want to go back and make sure that brother brown said it right because we should be going back to the pattern go back to the to the bible to make sure that everything lines up just right you know paul said that the the bible the pattern is a is like a mirror that you can look you can look into and see where you are the statue of the perfect man where you are right in in god's plan and how far along the building process is has god just laid the foundation or is he is he almost complete right is he where where is he in the building process we're going to do it anyhow see we want to have our way about it but we shouldn't do it it's wrong to do it the churches is just like the woman went wild let me see so in the message why in 1962 paragraph e33 he said that's the way it is today that the churches are trying to pattern after the other churches that's right and that's something you can try to pattern after that you can try to pattern after after uh get some man that you think is living a real good life and pattern after them and then uh years down the road they might slip and do something or who knows but if you keep your eye on the on christ then that that is what he says christ is our pattern so exactly then and now that's what he's cutting he's cutting out to choose a bride he's cutting out that that those that match the pattern which is christ if when he looks at us and sees himself reflected back and sees himself in us walking and talking and and living exactly like he did and and believing his word and trusting in him and he says now they didn't want it they didn't want the message what what if that king would have humbled himself what if he could have come down to many millions and went back to god and repented and uh i forget who he was talking about several examples in the bible that didn't listen of those that didn't listen and uh i'll just read a few more and we'll finish up and and the voice of god in this last days 1963 he says you can't base your eternal destination upon some sensation satan can impersonate any of those sensations not it's to know christ something changes in your life watch your life and pattern it with the word and see where you're at taking inventory certainly and why i'm against organized religion in 1962 he says you know in the dedication this morning moses followed the pattern that he saw in heaven and pitched a tent to represent it when solomon built the temple he what did he do follow the pattern that moses by the tent keeping the scripture in line and when god come to his temple for the last days this temple the holy ghost a body has now prepared him the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost the message was repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remissions of submission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to them that fall even as many as the lord our god shall call if you want to call your minister a doctor dr simon peter wrote a prescription an eternal prescription that's what cures the sick and then he i just had that quote about how he he died for you at calvary and god's provided away 1953 in there he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace upon him with his stripes we were healed so you can look at that and look and see how god took that pattern that pattern is made manifest now for you to take advantage of everything that was in that pattern is available for you to read the benefits now if you need healing or whatever i believe that that that should increase our faith it helped my faith to see that all the things that are in the pattern are now may manifest for now to take to take benefit of them to take advantage of and i'll just finish that right amen amen
