[4:04] never faced
[4:05] and lord we just pray that you to help
[4:08] us true
[4:09] guide us and keep us in jesus name
[4:12] amen revelations 3 14.
[4:17] we keep reading this because it's the
[4:19] message to this church age
[4:21] right okay and unto the angel of the
[4:25] church of the lady of siam's right
[4:27] these things saith the amen the faithful
[4:30] and
[4:31] true witness the beginning of the
[4:33] creation
[4:34] of god all right now we come down to
[4:38] that and it's used
[4:39] speaking of the beginning of the
[4:41] creation
[4:42] when really it's the winding up of the
[4:44] creation or the finishing of the
[4:46] creation
[4:47] is into this age here but that's that's
[4:51] one of those things
[4:52] that we look at all right let's go to
[4:54] revelations
[4:57] 1 26
[5:00] and god said let us make man in our
[5:02] image after our likeness and let them
[5:04] have dominion
[5:06] over the fish of the sea and over the
[5:08] fowl of the air and over the cattle and
[5:10] over all the earth
[5:11] and over every creeping thing that
[5:13] creepeth upon the earth
[5:15] so god created man in his own image in
[5:18] the image of god created he
[5:19] him male and female created he
[5:23] them all right now we know that's a
[5:26] spiritual creation
[5:29] that is not a physical we'll get to that
[5:31] as we go through
[5:32] now we go to the physical part because
[5:35] the prophet said
[5:36] god took 116 the spiritual man
[5:41] put it in human flesh in genesis
[5:44] 2 7. and the lord god formed
[5:49] man of the dust of the ground and
[5:51] breathe into his nostrils or breath of
[5:52] life
[5:53] and he became a living soul you may be
[5:57] seated the lord had his blessing
[5:59] to the reading of the word
[6:09] now i i don't want a shortcut and do and
[6:12] drop
[6:12] off but i want to try to move up today
[6:16] because we spent some time
[6:18] talking about the calling it the new
[6:21] creation
[6:23] i look back and my notes and things and
[6:26] on the computer
[6:27] about four or five years ago i spoke on
[6:29] this
[6:30] uh new creation new race and uh
[6:34] you know it can never end
[6:37] because it constantly unfolds
[6:40] you know as we're going along and you
[6:43] know
[6:43] we uh we know that you you got to
[6:49] justification sanctification the baptism
[6:52] of the holy ghost
[6:53] and that brings you into the body of
[6:56] christ and making you
[6:57] a new creature a new creation
[7:01] all right now that's wonderful and all
[7:04] and that's what i've been driving hard
[7:06] to see
[7:07] for us to follow the line of seeing that
[7:11] god's first creation was himself
[7:14] not a creation he didn't create that's
[7:17] that's where we
[7:18] we uh take those words and we we destroy
[7:21] ourselves by thinking on those words
[7:24] instead of thinking in the right order
[7:27] god
[7:28] didn't create who created who uh mankind
[7:31] some believe see that god created jesus
[7:35] and jesus created everything else well
[7:38] that wouldn't
[7:39] that that wouldn't work out you're still
[7:42] you're hung in your trinitarianism
[7:44] i don't care if you claim it in the
[7:46] message of of believing one god you're
[7:48] hung in trinitarianism
[7:50] when you're still hung up with the the
[7:52] point of trying to explain it that way
[7:54] and it's not that way so we know that
[7:56] god never had a beginning like we talk
[8:00] of the word term using it of the
[8:03] beginning
[8:04] he always was eternal so then you can't
[8:08] say well now he created but it's just
[8:10] terminologies when the prophet said
[8:13] god's first creation was himself
[8:16] well it simply means to me now as a way
[8:19] the prophet explained it
[8:21] it's just god's way of explaining or
[8:24] manifesting or showing himself
[8:27] just like the bible says no man hasn't
[8:29] even seen the father
[8:30] except the son all right which is
[8:33] bringing him forth
[8:34] and manifesting him all right see then
[8:36] that's where it started in the beginning
[8:38] god
[8:39] he was trying to condescend down to
[8:42] mankind
[8:44] or down to life and bring mankind
[8:47] into being is a better way of saying it
[8:49] because this is all
[8:50] we know we spent quite a while studying
[8:53] about the
[8:54] the creation of god in that form was
[8:56] back before the foundation of the world
[8:59] all right and see the first creation
[9:02] then was god himself
[9:04] and then out of god came forth the logos
[9:06] the theophany the
[9:08] the words that we use to express
[9:11] the eternal god and as it did then
[9:14] god made man in his own
[9:17] image genesis wonder all right man and
[9:21] male and female he made them in his
[9:24] image
[9:25] all right then what is the image of god
[9:29] the well it's a glob it's a this is that
[9:32] no we've been over these over the years
[9:35] god is a being
[9:37] all right now you say well now
[9:41] uh but but brother dale we're we're not
[9:44] in the image of god
[9:45] this flesh man is not the man
[9:49] that's with inside of that is the man
[9:51] that you're talking about
[9:53] so then genesis 1 26 and 27 he made man
[9:57] in his
[9:57] own image whatever the image god was
[10:01] or likeness or whatever whatever he
[10:05] looked like you know
[10:10] then when he created man in genesis 1
[10:14] 26 he created a man in that image
[10:18] or in other words he brought forth that
[10:21] man
[10:22] in that image he didn't create because
[10:25] that's where we get
[10:26] our words and and terms i was thinking
[10:29] uh some i've tried to study back you
[10:32] know to where i can
[10:33] can speak more but the prophet said that
[10:36] adam was god's first creation in the
[10:39] mankind line
[10:41] all right he's bringing it forth and he
[10:43] he came forth adam was created
[10:47] all right now but jesus was begotten
[10:51] all right now watch you say well look
[10:54] that's the same thing
[10:56] no it's not you're a long ways off and
[11:01] you've missed your point
[11:03] because remember adam
[11:08] was created full grown
[11:13] right he wasn't created a baby
[11:17] but jesus was created a baby
[11:20] or come forth in that image all right so
[11:24] then we
[11:24] we try to make words to fit something
[11:28] to explain ourselves but it's it's
[11:30] humanly impossible
[11:33] but see god has tried to reveal himself
[11:37] that's the whole point to make himself
[11:40] manifest
[11:41] to where that he could reveal himself
[11:44] to his people and what was the purpose
[11:47] he was lonely
[11:51] he was lonely because he was by himself
[11:54] he was elohim self-existing all right
[11:58] he existed alone and it wasn't that
[12:00] jesus was with god back there
[12:02] see you're in your trinitarianism
[12:06] no it was the way he is coming forth
[12:11] all right he comes forth to reveal
[12:14] himself
[12:15] and what was his first creation than
[12:17] himself
[12:18] in other words he steps over enough to
[12:21] where mankind will be able to eventually
[12:24] comprehend what's taking place
[12:28] and as he does then he's showing himself
[12:31] of who he is see then he makes the man
[12:35] well then if you want to know what god
[12:36] looks like
[12:38] look at the man now not the physical
[12:42] because that's in the animal all right
[12:46] but the spiritual man is the spiritual
[12:48] god
[12:49] you know the spiritual god himself
[12:51] coming forth to manifest himself
[12:54] or unfold himself showing
[12:57] what he is and see that that way
[13:00] you know people don't understand me a
[13:02] lot of times i guess when i'm trying to
[13:04] speak
[13:04] and maybe i don't understand myself
[13:06] that's all right see i believe god is
[13:09] real
[13:12] now i know the bible says god is a
[13:14] spirit now i know the prophet
[13:16] what he's saying that god is not in
[13:18] bodily form
[13:20] right we know that he's not in bodily
[13:23] form
[13:25] he's in spirit form but what did he look
[13:28] like
[13:29] well i don't know you just don't know
[13:32] well
[13:33] he made demand
[13:38] he may demand his own image for whatever
[13:41] god whatever man is god is that
[13:43] being and whatever god is man is man he
[13:46] is god is
[13:47] he comes forth as being an understanding
[13:50] see to me i'm trying to get you to see
[13:52] god is real
[13:55] because i believe he's real brother
[13:56] brandon said he's not like the wind
[14:01] it just blows backwards and forth he
[14:04] said he's a
[14:04] being
[14:09] see he's the person
[14:12] the terminologies we use maybe foul up
[14:14] what our
[14:15] thought is but he's a person
[14:18] and he's real and see then we're going
[14:22] back to that
[14:23] image because that's where
[14:26] that's what i'm saying i'm trying to
[14:28] bring this point
[14:30] in to bring to a close but yet
[14:33] it's seeming so hard because we're just
[14:36] now getting started
[14:41] do you realize
[14:44] that the eternal god is trying to reveal
[14:47] himself
[14:50] to mankind
[14:54] and in doing that he had to use
[14:58] channels and ways and things
[15:01] because i i hope he was listening to the
[15:03] message i've tried to bring
[15:06] and and and listening to you know what
[15:09] i've been trying to stumble
[15:11] around and find words to talk about yeah
[15:14] because how can you talk about the
[15:16] eternal god
[15:20] and see then you'll get in your mind god
[15:21] is a spirit
[15:23] you can't see a spirit we can't see a
[15:26] spirit if he's don't if he don't take a
[15:28] form
[15:29] that's right i mean you can't see god if
[15:33] god don't take a form
[15:34] that he can come forth that the person
[15:36] can comprehend him
[15:41] the best you could say would be you
[15:42] could feel him maybe or something but
[15:45] you can't see him because god's not in
[15:49] that
[15:49] a realm that we live in in the natural
[15:52] like that
[15:54] but yet he's there and see he was there
[15:58] before the world ever begun
[16:04] you mean brother dale you think that god
[16:06] has a a
[16:08] a form about him right
[16:12] i've always believed that he's not just
[16:15] like the wind just popping around you
[16:17] know and he's
[16:18] just going and all that no
[16:21] he's real
[16:23] [Music]
[16:25] and the reason that i know that that
[16:27] what i'm talking about is the truth
[16:29] because we're going toward that image
[16:35] i hope you've been listening to the
[16:37] point i've been just easing up a little
[16:39] easing up a little
[16:44] and to come to find out the church is
[16:45] the last image of god upon the earth
[16:49] right so what does god look like
[16:53] it looks like a spiritual image of what
[16:55] it is now not the physical man
[17:00] but the spiritual man
[17:03] brother random would say what kind of a
[17:05] man did god create he said spirit man
[17:08] what he said because god's a spirit
[17:12] well now you're you're a whole lot more
[17:15] uh i hope you think about yourself as
[17:17] being
[17:18] real you know i mean
[17:21] uh we're not just a spirit that's
[17:24] floating around
[17:28] right we're a being amen
[17:34] and god is trying to bring forth into
[17:36] understanding where we can see it
[17:41] and comprehend
[17:46] that god was trying to reveal himself
[17:50] and as he did it would come from god to
[17:53] adam
[17:57] all right and adam then was not first
[18:02] created
[18:02] human flesh he was first created a
[18:05] spiritual being
[18:09] because god is a spiritual being
[18:14] no all right then
[18:17] in genesis 2 and 7 then he becomes a
[18:21] natural man
[18:26] a natural man a human man a flesh man
[18:32] looking like the animals
[18:36] in their image instead of in the image
[18:38] of god in that natural part
[18:41] but yet still when he comes forth
[18:45] you know you go from god to adam
[18:53] and bring adam in as a spiritual being
[18:55] first
[18:59] don't bring him in as a physical being
[19:02] bring him in is it supposed to be a
[19:03] spiritual being
[19:06] in the image of god all right
[19:11] see you're going then from god to adam
[19:15] in the spiritual image then you go from
[19:20] you've got to come in there with that
[19:23] creation of adam in natural
[19:28] i don't mean this wrong i mean this way
[19:31] if you that haven't heard the life's
[19:34] message i preached on this
[19:36] i would ask you to do me a favor
[19:41] you say you yeah because it would help
[19:43] you to understand
[19:45] i've listened four times i think it is
[19:47] to that service
[19:49] that's not bragging on me it's the fact
[19:51] that i would have loved to hear
[19:53] and then just sat there friday night and
[19:56] hearing our brother and he just come
[19:58] right down the line
[20:00] i was watching him very close
[20:05] and he came right out to a point that i
[20:07] haven't even got to
[20:13] and see i want to talk to him you know
[20:15] see how far he can go on and on
[20:17] i enjoyed it i thought he'd done a
[20:20] marvelous job
[20:22] but i'd ask you to get the last message
[20:24] that i tried to preach
[20:26] well let's go to any good time you got
[20:29] time to do everything else
[20:32] don't talk to me about stuff like that
[20:34] and jump
[20:35] you know i mean if you were in school
[20:37] and the teacher
[20:39] uh you know told you to read a certain
[20:42] book you ought to read that book
[20:45] and to me the greatest book of all to
[20:46] read right now and what i'm talking
[20:48] about is christ the mystery of god
[20:50] revealed
[20:54] if you get that message and go through
[20:56] it you'll see exactly what i'm talking
[20:58] about
[21:00] what i'm trying to bring it forward
[21:02] because there's something about the
[21:03] creation that i haven't touched yet
[21:11] am i just saying it that way i'll touch
[21:13] on it today
[21:15] let's see if you can follow it or try to
[21:19] so you go from god in the basis of god
[21:22] being the beginning
[21:23] and being there in the beginning and
[21:25] being the eternal god
[21:27] the self-existing one and then he starts
[21:30] condescending downward
[21:33] and as he does he becomes in to be known
[21:36] as the word
[21:37] logos theophany word anointed or
[21:40] anointing
[21:42] and even come down to the son of god
[21:47] that's what i've always told you that's
[21:48] the hardest thing seeming to get people
[21:50] to think about
[21:51] that the son of god was back before the
[21:54] foundation of the world
[21:55] but the son of god and a spiritual form
[22:00] god in another form called a son
[22:05] he's the word
[22:09] he is the word the son of god the word
[22:14] the word created all things is that true
[22:18] the bible said all things were created
[22:20] by him by who
[22:22] not jesus the flesh man he was not back
[22:25] there to do that
[22:27] jesus the spiritual man
[22:31] so you're coming from god to adam now
[22:35] adam's not physical now keep with me
[22:40] he's just in the image of god
[22:44] he's eternal because god is eternal
[22:48] that's what brother branham says
[22:50] blasphemous names now
[22:52] i'm not i'm sorry if you won't go read
[22:55] the book to see what
[22:56] the prophet has to say about it then all
[22:58] i got to say is to you
[23:00] you're the one that's losing not me
[23:03] because i've taught it over and over and
[23:04] over
[23:05] brother brennan blasphemy's name he said
[23:07] especially into adam
[23:08] he breathed the breath of eternal life
[23:18] see because adam was an eternal person
[23:20] with god
[23:25] now the spirit man adam not the flesh
[23:27] man
[23:34] the spirit man let us make man
[23:38] and he made a spirit man or in other
[23:41] words he just
[23:43] expanded himself he just stepped over
[23:47] into another form
[23:51] called the word and begin to create
[23:56] all right see then
[23:59] you look at that and you see that adam
[24:02] in this and eve in the spiritual
[24:04] condition what if there had
[24:06] been no fall
[24:13] what if it had been no fault
[24:19] but see there would have been no
[24:20] displaying of the attributes right
[24:25] so it's not messing it up it's coming
[24:27] out to the right order
[24:30] adam in the spiritual man
[24:33] could not fall
[24:40] brother random said adam and the natural
[24:42] man fail
[24:45] but we've got to cover that because
[24:47] that's hard to understand
[24:50] you can't make adam die and go to hell
[24:52] don't get into your line of thinking
[24:54] so when brother brown said adam died
[24:58] think about natural
[25:02] but you got to get the man here first
[25:05] see
[25:08] you've got to get the man adam here
[25:11] because there is no fallen condition
[25:14] with the spiritual man adam
[25:19] the spiritual man adam is in the image
[25:21] of god
[25:22] and lightness and cannot fall
[25:32] all right then if we believe the prophet
[25:35] in saying
[25:36] that god wanted to display his
[25:37] attributes
[25:39] he was a savior and there was nothing to
[25:42] be sick there was nothing to be lost
[25:47] so what did he do
[25:52] god had to make a way that the
[25:55] attributes could
[25:56] come into being
[25:59] what'd he do he made adam
[26:02] a flesh man genesis 2.
[26:08] he made him a flesh man
[26:12] and he put
[26:15] that genesis 1 26-27 man spirit man
[26:19] into flesh
[26:26] now he has a way to express his
[26:31] attributes
[26:33] because adam was a human being
[26:38] see adam had eternal life in his soul
[26:43] because that was the image of god put
[26:46] into adam
[26:47] genesis 1 put into genesis 2. all right
[26:51] now when he comes to that place then
[26:53] adam is standing there
[26:57] a flesh man
[27:01] god had to create adam that way
[27:06] to be able to make to where that he
[27:09] could bring his attributes into being
[27:13] see now he has the ability to do that
[27:16] because adam is a flesh man
[27:25] adam is a flesh man
[27:28] so adam and eve would come forth
[27:30] blasphemous names
[27:32] he would be eternal in soul
[27:36] adam and eve would be but not eternal in
[27:40] body
[27:42] because if he's eternal in body there
[27:44] wouldn't be no ability to fall there
[27:46] wouldn't be no
[27:47] no would do it now wait what i'm saying
[27:49] hey brother adam blasphemous names
[27:52] what did he fall the seal book
[27:56] around him said adam fell from eternal
[27:58] life to death
[28:00] in the garden
[28:07] where'd he fall to do you die and go to
[28:09] hell
[28:12] no well why can't you just think a
[28:16] little bit
[28:19] put on your thinking cap and spiritually
[28:22] think it over
[28:27] god is bringing forth a way that his
[28:30] plan
[28:30] of redemption can be made manifest
[28:38] well man had to fall
[28:44] to worry that there could be a
[28:45] redemption
[28:49] and he couldn't create a sinner
[28:55] so he created him perfect
[28:58] i didn't say eternal now he did in the
[29:00] spirit man but not the physical body huh
[29:03] adam's body was not eternal
[29:07] that's what i said about that scripture
[29:08] there in
[29:10] in corinthians if we have time to get to
[29:12] it
[29:13] you got the first man adam and the
[29:15] second man adam
[29:18] first man adam was a human being
[29:22] second man adam was the lord jesus
[29:24] christ
[29:25] do you realize then that god created
[29:28] adam
[29:29] into a human being before jesus the
[29:33] flesh man
[29:34] came into being did you catch that
[29:39] before the flesh man jesus could come
[29:42] into being
[29:43] it took four thousand years
[29:49] really six you know you know coming over
[29:52] into where we're at but
[29:54] 4 000 years
[29:58] to be able to bring forth the human body
[30:02] of the lord jesus christ
[30:05] so adam came first according to
[30:07] corinthians there
[30:09] which came first see adam came forth
[30:15] and god created him in the way
[30:18] that he would be subject
[30:23] not sinful but subject to sin
[30:27] because he'd be a human being
[30:30] the spiritual man couldn't fall
[30:36] huh so when brother branham gets into
[30:39] the seal book he said
[30:40] adam fell from eternal life to death
[30:46] but you're not listening to the rest of
[30:48] what he says
[30:53] he said you say then adam died
[30:58] he said but before adam died said he had
[31:00] a lamb
[31:03] now
[31:06] you can't make adam fall the way you
[31:09] think he fell
[31:11] because he didn't fall to eternal death
[31:15] he fell to natural death
[31:19] in other words he never never did reach
[31:22] eternal life in flesh
[31:26] he had eternal life in his soul
[31:30] in the image of god but he never did
[31:32] come to the
[31:33] that natural man never come to the
[31:37] position of eternal life
[31:41] even the natural man jesus christ
[31:45] didn't come into the world with eternal
[31:47] life in his flesh
[31:56] the key to the whole thing is where he
[31:58] come to where he was supposed
[32:00] to be
[32:05] see if you'll read corinthians 15 you'll
[32:07] remember one thing if you'll read it and
[32:09] read it and read it
[32:10] corinthians 15 read the whole chapter
[32:13] there
[32:16] paul is talking about the resurrection
[32:24] no resurrection
[32:28] no change in the body
[32:32] okay so listen
[32:36] see so in the natural create in other
[32:39] words in the creation
[32:41] it goes from god and his coming to forth
[32:44] of the word and thing
[32:45] and then he brings adam into being
[32:48] now he's got somebody that he can
[32:50] fellowship with
[32:57] and he's got a man remember that was put
[33:00] over the animals
[33:01] not the physical man adam the spiritual
[33:05] man is the one that was put over the
[33:06] animals to
[33:08] rule them and control them in things
[33:12] naturally the human element would come
[33:13] involved but yet it's still not there
[33:19] see jesus didn't come forth in flesh
[33:26] until 4 000 years later amen
[33:32] he said well i don't i don't understand
[33:34] what you what are you i'm talking about
[33:36] one simple thing
[33:38] first it's god coming down condescending
[33:41] bringing it over
[33:42] and when he does he brings man into
[33:44] being in a spiritual condition
[33:49] oh genesis 1 26-27
[33:54] then that's not no way then god looking
[33:58] at it there's no way that he can
[34:00] do anything because man has not fallen
[34:03] so he can't display
[34:04] the attribute of savior healer etc
[34:08] he can't do that those are parts of his
[34:11] attributes of his being of his person
[34:17] brother brother said if you want to know
[34:18] what god looks like he said just look
[34:20] for what he's making manifest
[34:24] all right
[34:28] see so it's god coming down and bringing
[34:32] adam the spirit man into being then he
[34:35] puts that over into the flesh
[34:37] and when he does man falls
[34:45] he's standing there with eternal life in
[34:48] his soul
[34:49] but his body is not eternal don't
[34:52] think don't ever get it in your mind
[34:56] don't even consider the thoughts that
[34:59] you can say
[35:00] well i'm a christian i can't be lost
[35:05] i'm saved i can't be lost don't get that
[35:08] in your mind
[35:12] adam never died and went to hell no
[35:17] but yet he never reached eternal life in
[35:20] flesh
[35:22] there's never been but one man
[35:26] that ever reached eternal life in flesh
[35:32] and that's the lord jesus christ
[35:40] there's the key to the whole thing that
[35:41] i've been talking about there's the part
[35:43] of complete of uh
[35:45] creation that i haven't spoke of
[35:48] all right so we talked about three
[35:52] stages from god existing alone
[35:57] and then coming down now he exists with
[35:59] adam
[36:01] and eve because he was in adam that's
[36:05] what brother rome said now you can argue
[36:06] with him if you want to
[36:08] said he was in adam and theophany so
[36:10] that's right with me but you just do
[36:12] what you want to because you are anyway
[36:15] you're not going to listen
[36:18] you think you got it figured out
[36:23] but you see i'll go ahead and listen
[36:24] just see if you got it figured out you
[36:26] really
[36:27] realize the new creation you race hadn't
[36:29] started yet
[36:34] it's never been in but one man
[36:44] i'm just beginning to get started of
[36:47] understanding
[36:50] but trying to get you and me to
[36:52] understand what the the stages of
[36:54] creation
[36:57] that god condescended downwardly
[37:01] in his creation if you want to call it
[37:05] in his being and his coming forth
[37:08] he came down into where that he could be
[37:13] comprehended
[37:16] all right and when he did he brought a
[37:18] man into being
[37:20] adam spirit man
[37:23] in his own image right
[37:27] that still wasn't enough there's no way
[37:29] that adam in that condition could fall
[37:36] so he puts him in natural flesh
[37:43] come on right he puts him in natural
[37:45] flesh
[37:46] the natural flesh man can fall not
[37:50] to hell not to be lost eternally but can
[37:53] fall from the point of what's doing
[37:55] because adam never
[37:56] attained unto the position that god
[38:00] wanted him to do
[38:02] he failed in sin
[38:05] well i don't understand that no you're
[38:08] not
[38:08] wanting to understand
[38:14] if you want to understand just simply
[38:16] listen
[38:18] you come from god
[38:22] to adam everything's still perfect
[38:28] no sin no savior no nothing
[38:35] then you come
[38:39] from adam the spirit man to the natural
[38:44] man
[38:48] an atonement appears
[38:54] natural man fell from receiving
[38:57] attaining unto the position that he
[38:59] should have been
[39:00] had there been no fall adam would have
[39:03] walked right straight in
[39:05] and you and i would have been able to
[39:06] walk right straight in with him
[39:08] because remember one thing for certain
[39:10] the tree of life was in the garden
[39:15] right the tree of life was in the garden
[39:20] we deal with the tree of death with adam
[39:22] i mean with the
[39:23] with satan and the beast and the thing
[39:27] and we we don't get the point of seeing
[39:30] the tree of life we're standing there
[39:42] god had to make an atonement
[39:47] i know i preached funny and i preached a
[39:49] word that you've got to understand
[39:50] because i want it to be that away
[39:55] see because that way you have a hopes of
[39:57] being able to receive
[40:02] have you thought about what i'm saying
[40:06] that that when adam came into being
[40:10] now you have something that can fall
[40:16] but not be eternally lost
[40:20] why because before the end of atonement
[40:23] had already been made
[40:28] before adam sinned the atonement
[40:31] the lamb that's why they brought around
[40:33] and said
[40:35] did you say but brother branham said
[40:37] adam died he said before adam died
[40:39] he said he had a lamb where was that
[40:42] lamb
[40:44] before the foundation of the world
[40:47] amen
[40:51] that's what your bible says the lamb
[40:54] slain before the foundation of the world
[40:58] when was that lion slain before the
[41:00] world back there
[41:01] when he was existing alone
[41:08] because he was making a way
[41:15] come on church one split second in the
[41:19] presence of god
[41:21] without an atonement you're dead
[41:24] agree
[41:27] we'll see if adam and eve had ascend
[41:32] without the atonement already paid for
[41:34] them
[41:35] where would they be they would have been
[41:38] lost
[41:43] but the lamb was already slain you said
[41:46] that was in god's mind
[41:48] hey god's mind is a whole lot more real
[41:50] than me and you so don't don't go that
[41:51] away with me
[41:53] this day women listen
[41:57] see when the natural man came into being
[42:01] he came into being perfect
[42:05] god didn't create him wrong
[42:08] he didn't create eve wrong
[42:13] he created eve to be what she wound up
[42:16] being
[42:16] a mother
[42:20] right he didn't create her to be a male
[42:25] he created to be a female that's why
[42:28] this
[42:32] but you see then you get adam here from
[42:36] the spiritual condition
[42:37] then you get him here as a physical
[42:39] being and you can see the fall
[42:42] transpires
[42:45] and the fall when it comes into being
[42:48] then god can start coming on the scene
[42:51] but the flesh man jesus didn't come back
[42:54] there
[42:55] it was 4 000 years later
[43:02] when jesus come into flesh
[43:11] so you got it from god to adam
[43:15] spiritually speaking then you've got
[43:16] adam coming into being as a part of
[43:19] genesis 2
[43:21] as to where he's the flesh man and he
[43:24] brings the
[43:24] ability for the fall to follow forth
[43:30] and you've got a long ways
[43:34] before you come to the new creation
[43:37] in your race you've got four thousand
[43:41] years of mankind upon earth and man
[43:43] stumbling
[43:44] trying to find his way to god and god
[43:46] trying his best to reveal himself to man
[43:50] but there's nobody in the old testament
[43:53] received eternal life
[43:59] nobody came like adam you see no nobody
[44:02] come like no that's right nobody didn't
[44:03] come back jesus but nobody come like
[44:05] adam
[44:07] because adam comes spirit man first
[44:11] which was eternal life in his soul the
[44:13] natural man
[44:14] comes second all right
[44:18] now so then from adam
[44:22] to jesus you have the natural man
[44:27] flesh man
[44:31] you have mankind in a fallen condition
[44:36] but just remember all the way through
[44:38] you still have the atonement
[44:48] the atonement was made before the
[44:50] foundation of the world
[44:51] so when mankind sinned it just brought a
[44:55] display of that
[44:57] attribute into being
[45:02] i'm home church i sitting there the
[45:05] other day cried
[45:06] i thought god can the people see what
[45:09] i'm talking about
[45:15] by approaching it the way i'm talking
[45:17] about it when you got adam coming into
[45:19] being
[45:20] as a spiritual man first then he comes
[45:23] into being as a physical man
[45:25] now you have the ability for god to
[45:28] display his attributes
[45:32] because adam sinned
[45:37] well you can't sin he was he had eternal
[45:40] he didn't have eternal life like you and
[45:42] i have eternal life
[45:43] now that one's going to take a while to
[45:45] explain
[45:50] you mean there's a difference yes adam
[45:53] never went through a new birth
[45:57] there's a difference in adam and a and
[45:59] jesus
[46:00] adam was created brother random said
[46:02] straight from the hand of
[46:04] almighty god and he was created a
[46:06] full-grown man
[46:10] but when jesus come it took four
[46:12] thousand years before that baby could
[46:14] come into being
[46:17] but when that baby would come into being
[46:19] he would be
[46:20] to be the only begotten
[46:27] adam was his first creation jesus was
[46:31] his only begotten
[46:34] the only one that was ever begotten that
[46:36] away
[46:37] the only one that ever come that away
[46:41] come on
[46:42] am i right
[46:46] eve conceived of the holy ghost not true
[46:50] man
[46:52] i mean mary conceived not through man
[46:59] jesus was virgin born adam wasn't virgin
[47:03] born
[47:06] adam was created
[47:13] right adam was created
[47:18] jesus was virgin born
[47:21] begotten of the father amen
[47:25] a body brought into being by god
[47:29] almighty himself
[47:34] see then you have adam to jesus
[47:38] you have natural man
[47:43] in a sinful condition
[47:52] when you come to jesus now you have the
[47:55] ability
[47:56] to talk about now i'm talking about
[47:58] jesus when he came into birth
[47:59] and came on up and now not he wasn't
[48:02] capable of dying for our sins when he
[48:04] was first born
[48:05] he you know you understand what i'm
[48:07] talking about he had to wait until the
[48:09] ministry was there the thing
[48:11] but yet when it did there stands
[48:14] a new creation
[48:21] nobody between adam and
[48:24] and jesus was virgin born
[48:30] amen a new creation
[48:36] god and man to meet together
[48:39] in a human element
[48:43] and be a new creation no longer dealing
[48:47] by ways of the natural creation
[48:51] he dealt with adam i'm quoting brother
[48:53] branham and adam fail
[48:55] he dealt with no moses and moses failed
[48:58] he met with abraham trying to do it on
[49:00] abraham failed
[49:03] see nobody's ever been able to do
[49:04] anything during that time between
[49:07] adam coming forth as a human being
[49:12] in flesh
[49:17] nobody down through there had a virgin
[49:19] birth
[49:25] right
[49:29] but then one day here come
[49:33] the one that could make a new creation
[49:38] and jesus was a new creation
[49:42] god and man met together in human flesh
[49:48] the birth of that flesh
[49:52] why was it not okay that david the great
[49:55] god loved david why couldn't he just let
[49:59] him have
[50:00] a baby and things and it'd be all right
[50:02] you know what i'm saying through a wife
[50:04] or whatever
[50:06] they couldn't do it there wouldn't be no
[50:09] new creation
[50:12] the old creation
[50:16] okay are you following me
[50:20] see then when jesus comes on earth the
[50:22] baby jesus
[50:23] there is a new creature
[50:29] and i said that the way i meant it there
[50:32] come a new creature
[50:36] god and man in human flesh
[50:45] a new creature not like all the rest of
[50:48] them
[50:49] not like the rest of mankind
[50:53] but a new creation
[50:58] there he stood on this earth there's a
[51:01] new creation
[51:04] there he went through his life in 30
[51:05] years and
[51:07] a new creation yet he couldn't display
[51:11] it
[51:13] are you with me he couldn't display it
[51:16] because as it was in the garden there
[51:19] had to be a fall
[51:20] so he had to permit adam to come
[51:23] now when you see jesus standing on the
[51:26] earth
[51:29] he's a total new creation
[51:33] he's god in human flesh
[51:39] right the man christ
[51:43] jesus the second adam
[51:48] was god in human flesh
[51:53] god created a body to come down and live
[51:56] in
[51:59] that body would make the atonement
[52:11] but you put him as a human being and
[52:13] what was he standing there in a top now
[52:15] an
[52:15] example you had adam
[52:19] standing with eternal life in his soul
[52:22] but yet his body was not eternal
[52:26] so you have the same situation existing
[52:29] when jesus comes on the scene
[52:35] the soul was eternal but the body was
[52:37] not
[52:42] brother brown said it even at river
[52:44] jordan there
[52:45] that the body had to be
[52:48] redeemed the body of jesus not that it
[52:52] was sinful
[52:53] no but because it had a beginning
[52:57] and anything that has a beginning as an
[53:00] ending
[53:02] right
[53:06] adam's body had a beginning he'll have
[53:08] to have an
[53:09] ending it has to be made eternal
[53:14] are you following me
[53:20] but you see when it happens
[53:24] with mankind god and man becomes one
[53:32] by the new birth we're a new creature
[53:37] according to the bible a new creation
[53:42] distinct from the old creation now is
[53:45] there any difference in you and
[53:46] and and uh david
[53:51] no we look alike we act alike we live
[53:54] alike we eat a light we do
[53:56] i'm just saying david you know any man
[53:58] anybody you want to put it
[54:05] but in jesus christ was the ability
[54:12] just as it was in adam the ability to
[54:15] fall
[54:17] was god's plan
[54:20] i said ability to fall i didn't say made
[54:23] god didn't make adam fall
[54:27] but the ability to fall came into being
[54:31] now you've got one coming that can take
[54:33] away the fall
[54:38] jesus was a new creation
[54:46] a new creature
[54:49] he wouldn't know no of the old race
[54:53] he wasn't born from mary
[54:56] you know what i'm talking about
[55:01] he was born by the spoken word
[55:06] he was spoken into existence he was
[55:08] begotten
[55:12] not created
[55:19] jesus wasn't created he was begotten
[55:24] he came forth from the wound of a woman
[55:27] right but yet he had to do that to be
[55:29] able to be our brother
[55:31] amen our savior
[55:36] those attributes could not be displayed
[55:38] they were things back in the old
[55:39] testament
[55:40] like healings and and things and there
[55:42] was a salvation of the old testament yes
[55:46] but it was not a salvation of eternal
[55:48] life in the soul of mankind
[55:54] nobody none of us didn't even come like
[56:00] adam
[56:02] jesus is the only one that came in the
[56:03] correct way
[56:14] you see when jesus stood on this earth
[56:21] it was the beginning of a new creation
[56:29] huh
[56:31] no longer dealing like that like he was
[56:33] with adam and
[56:35] abraham and moses and all of them
[56:39] because they couldn't do it
[56:44] god and man met in jesus christ
[56:52] in a new creation
[56:58] but let me say it this way and then i'll
[57:00] get back to it eventually
[57:02] do you realize that being a new creation
[57:06] you raise
[57:10] the lord jesus standing on earth was
[57:12] god's plan
[57:15] and purpose
[57:20] god's desire
[57:23] had been made flesh
[57:26] because there stood our healer our
[57:29] savior
[57:30] our redeemer all the things
[57:34] sit on earth in a man called jesus
[57:43] he was a new creation totally different
[57:48] now maybe that will dawn on you if
[57:50] you'll just listen to a minute
[57:52] if he's a new creation and a new
[57:55] creation
[57:56] meant for him to come the way he came
[58:00] then do you realize the way you came
[58:07] he didn't have to come by a new birth to
[58:10] be a new creation
[58:13] but we have to have a new birth
[58:18] to be a new creation
[58:22] right we have to have a new birth
[58:26] we have to go through justification same
[58:28] case the baptism of the holy ghost
[58:32] the receiving of eternal life into our
[58:34] soul
[58:38] still we just reached a position that we
[58:40] have eternal life in our soul
[58:42] because we don't have eternal life in
[58:43] our body and our spirit
[58:49] there's things god has not displayed yet
[58:51] too
[58:52] one thing is he hasn't changed our
[58:54] bodies
[58:58] he said well how can that come it'll
[59:00] come because we
[59:02] all right listen
[59:09] so we have to have the new birth to be a
[59:12] new creature
[59:17] but even though we have the new birth
[59:22] it doesn't mean we have the virtues etc
[59:24] we don't have all of the things
[59:26] we have to grow into those things as
[59:29] children
[59:31] in a new creation but at least we can
[59:34] talk about a new creation
[59:37] but just remember one thing you're
[59:40] sitting here right now as a new creature
[59:42] in christ jesus by the new birth into
[59:44] your soul
[59:44] but your body is not redeemed
[59:49] it's paid for all right
[59:53] but it's not redeemed
[59:58] see jesus reached that position
[1:00:03] jesus became a new creature
[1:00:08] because there was never a creature like
[1:00:10] that
[1:00:11] before and he was the beginning of the
[1:00:14] creation of god
[1:00:16] god in human flesh
[1:00:22] yet he had to walk in that human flesh
[1:00:28] it was not eternal
[1:00:34] but in his death burial and resurrection
[1:00:38] he reached it that's why the bible says
[1:00:40] that
[1:00:41] no man hath approached to immortality
[1:00:45] except jesus christ
[1:00:50] immortality is eternal life
[1:00:54] in a human element
[1:00:57] there's never been a man with eternal
[1:00:59] life in a human element
[1:01:01] outside of the lord jesus christ
[1:01:04] and he had to give that life to be able
[1:01:06] to even just to make us new creatures
[1:01:09] sure we're a new creature but there's a
[1:01:11] lot more to go with it
[1:01:17] there's a lot more to that has to be
[1:01:19] covered in a new creation
[1:01:21] because see you and i are only adopted
[1:01:23] into
[1:01:24] we'll get to that
[1:01:31] but just stay with me for a second
[1:01:37] let me just read this because i tried to
[1:01:40] read it the last time and
[1:01:43] still didn't get it fully read let me
[1:01:50] go ahead brothers to number
[1:01:53] number 11
[1:01:56] because it's the thing that we've been
[1:01:58] reading over and over to try to get you
[1:02:00] to understand
[1:02:03] and now listen the key is to
[1:02:06] listen very carefully to the wording of
[1:02:10] the prophet
[1:02:12] because in the wording he's laying down
[1:02:15] the plan
[1:02:16] of redemption
[1:02:19] but see justification cases of baptism
[1:02:21] in the holy ghost
[1:02:22] is not the full plan of redemption
[1:02:28] you got to have a body change
[1:02:34] there's a plan of redemption that's not
[1:02:35] covered it's a
[1:02:37] body change so listen to what he's
[1:02:40] saying now
[1:02:43] but now he's standing in the midst of
[1:02:45] the church
[1:02:46] it's about the lord jesus christ
[1:02:50] as he stands there revealing who he is
[1:02:53] in this life's age
[1:02:56] he calls himself the author of the
[1:02:59] creation of god
[1:03:01] that's the author means the creation you
[1:03:04] know
[1:03:05] that's the point of it trying to get you
[1:03:06] to see look now
[1:03:09] he calls himself the author of the
[1:03:12] creation of god
[1:03:13] this is another creation
[1:03:19] now
[1:03:22] if he's the author if he's the if he's
[1:03:25] the creator
[1:03:26] this is an another creation
[1:03:31] this is the church coming forth into the
[1:03:33] same creation that he is
[1:03:36] may i say it that way
[1:03:39] you think we're not going to have to do
[1:03:40] that we're going to have to come to the
[1:03:42] same way he came amen
[1:03:48] listen this is another creation this has
[1:03:51] to do with the church
[1:03:54] this is a special designation of himself
[1:03:56] so what is the church
[1:03:59] the church is the born-again believer
[1:04:02] that
[1:04:02] is a special designation of god
[1:04:06] so now you have by the new birth in you
[1:04:10] god in human flesh
[1:04:15] called a new creation no it's not
[1:04:18] finished no
[1:04:19] we've got a lot more to go but it's we
[1:04:21] can say that
[1:04:23] because listen this is a special
[1:04:25] designation of himself
[1:04:28] he is the creator of the church the
[1:04:31] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:04:33] bride
[1:04:35] as the spirit of god he came down now
[1:04:38] look i don't know how they done what
[1:04:41] they're putting in it but
[1:04:42] listen the heavenly bridegroom created
[1:04:45] his own bride
[1:04:47] stop now now the next part of the
[1:04:51] sentence is going
[1:04:52] over to well let's read it
[1:04:56] he is the creator of that church the
[1:04:58] heavenly bridegroom
[1:05:00] created his own bride
[1:05:03] all right as the spirit of god he
[1:05:08] came down and created in the virgin mary
[1:05:11] the cells from which
[1:05:12] his body was born now he's gone to the
[1:05:14] body
[1:05:20] right
[1:05:22] come on he's gone to the body now
[1:05:26] all right see then the body is
[1:05:30] going to have to be made a new creature
[1:05:39] the new birth makes your soul a new
[1:05:41] creation
[1:05:44] but something's got to happen to this
[1:05:46] body
[1:05:49] so look where he goes from has to do
[1:05:52] with the church this is a special
[1:05:53] designation of himself
[1:05:54] okay he is the creator of the church
[1:05:58] the heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:06:00] bride amen stop his sentence and listen
[1:06:02] for a minute now
[1:06:07] now as the spirit of god he came down
[1:06:10] and created in the virgin mary
[1:06:13] the cells from which his body was born i
[1:06:16] want to repeat that he created the very
[1:06:18] cells in the wound of mary
[1:06:20] for that body it was not enough
[1:06:25] for the holy spirit to simply give life
[1:06:28] to a human over
[1:06:29] over he pronounced supplied by mary see
[1:06:32] that don't work we don't believe mary
[1:06:34] supplied no egg nothing
[1:06:36] no god created egg and sperm okay
[1:06:40] that would have been sinful mankind
[1:06:42] produced in the body
[1:06:43] that would not have produced the last
[1:06:46] adam
[1:06:50] if if he if mary had anything to do
[1:06:54] with the birth of jesus christ it would
[1:06:56] not have produced a second adam
[1:06:59] the second adam is the lord jesus christ
[1:07:01] the god of glory
[1:07:03] first adam is the god you know of the
[1:07:05] human elements and the things of back
[1:07:07] there
[1:07:07] listen that would not have produced the
[1:07:11] last adam
[1:07:12] of him it was said lower body thou hast
[1:07:15] thou father
[1:07:16] prepared for me god not mary provided
[1:07:19] the
[1:07:19] that body mary was the human incubator
[1:07:22] and she carried that holy child
[1:07:25] and brought him to birth it was a god
[1:07:28] man he was the son of god he was
[1:07:32] of the new creation
[1:07:36] now man and god
[1:07:40] met and joined he was the first
[1:07:44] of this new race he is the head of this
[1:07:48] new race
[1:07:50] he is the head of the body the church
[1:07:52] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:07:53] the dead
[1:07:54] that in all things he might have the
[1:07:56] preeminent
[1:07:57] are you listening are you thinking about
[1:07:59] what he's saying
[1:08:06] but let me just get this and i'll quit
[1:08:09] because i know i can't go
[1:08:15] we have to come you and i
[1:08:18] somebody has to come
[1:08:23] to a certain position
[1:08:27] i believe that i've always taught that i
[1:08:28] believe it i believe that it's
[1:08:30] involved in the basis of you and me
[1:08:32] reaching a position
[1:08:35] and that position is a new creature
[1:08:39] it starts from your soul makes your soul
[1:08:43] eternal
[1:08:45] then you start up the stature of a
[1:08:47] perfect man growing in grace and
[1:08:49] knowledge
[1:08:50] and those things see it's not finished
[1:08:52] there
[1:08:54] the word of god had to come forth in the
[1:08:56] last days to bring the ability to reach
[1:08:58] that position
[1:09:01] right is that what the prophet is that
[1:09:03] his words
[1:09:05] all right and see then what is it doing
[1:09:08] is to bring forth a new race of people
[1:09:15] you realize by the new birth that you're
[1:09:18] a new race
[1:09:21] let's get it right now hold it you're
[1:09:23] born again believer you
[1:09:25] are are of a new race
[1:09:28] you're not the old order made over if
[1:09:30] you are you're not born again
[1:09:33] that's what the prophet's saying he said
[1:09:35] it's not the old order
[1:09:38] see we've got to reach the position that
[1:09:41] adam
[1:09:41] was in the garden and adam in the garden
[1:09:45] was a human being
[1:09:47] with eternal life in his soul
[1:09:51] but yet his body
[1:09:56] he couldn't get to the tree of life
[1:10:01] well see in the end time the bride of
[1:10:02] christ has to come to the tree of life
[1:10:04] which is the word of god
[1:10:09] all right
[1:10:15] he comes down and designates himself by
[1:10:17] bap the baptism of the holy ghost just
[1:10:19] came
[1:10:20] because baptism of the holy ghost makes
[1:10:22] her part of this new race
[1:10:27] look what a race it would have been had
[1:10:28] adam had not fallen
[1:10:31] can you comprehend that i know that you
[1:10:34] say well that's impossible to be because
[1:10:35] it wasn't going to happen
[1:10:36] i know it but what if it had do you
[1:10:39] realize what it would have been
[1:10:40] had adam not fallen
[1:10:46] you realize it would be a wonderful
[1:10:48] world
[1:10:52] and even the worst that satan could do
[1:10:56] would not be able to take us down
[1:11:02] but what about a group of people
[1:11:05] coming to a position through jesus
[1:11:08] christ in the new birth
[1:11:09] a new creature until she's part of a new
[1:11:13] race
[1:11:19] you're part of a new race you're a new
[1:11:21] race of people
[1:11:24] you're a new order of people
[1:11:28] you have the greatest ability that could
[1:11:32] be thinking about
[1:11:34] you have eternal life in your soul
[1:11:39] and you have a right to the tree of life
[1:11:42] to take of that tree of life and live
[1:11:44] forever
[1:11:45] you can't live eternal as to pardon adam
[1:11:48] was saying
[1:11:50] that's why i said it would live forever
[1:11:53] all right
[1:11:55] you right now have the new birth
[1:12:00] that makes your soul part of that new
[1:12:06] creation
[1:12:09] but the one who made it possible for us
[1:12:11] to come to that place
[1:12:13] went on further
[1:12:17] than just the new birth
[1:12:21] his body was made eternal in the
[1:12:24] resurrection
[1:12:27] now he is a new creation a new race
[1:12:35] truly god and man living in a human
[1:12:38] vessel
[1:12:40] you realize that's what it's going to be
[1:12:41] for us to get out of here
[1:12:45] well we just can't do that brother well
[1:12:47] then we're not going to get out of here
[1:12:48] then
[1:12:49] so quit quick flummer around about it
[1:12:51] and think about it
[1:12:55] by the new birth we have the ability
[1:13:00] to be the part of the body of jesus
[1:13:02] christ
[1:13:07] we're waiting the redemption of our body
[1:13:10] to finish this new race do you realize
[1:13:14] what it's going to be
[1:13:18] brother ray if you get eternal life in
[1:13:21] your body
[1:13:22] then you're not an old race
[1:13:28] you're a new creature
[1:13:32] but you're what god wanted
[1:13:36] now he doesn't want us to stop without a
[1:13:38] change of the body
[1:13:39] getting the change in the body to go
[1:13:41] with this
[1:13:44] new creature people deal with it you
[1:13:47] talk about new creation
[1:13:48] huge creature and they'll say yes that
[1:13:50] new creature that's in jesus christ
[1:13:52] amen but somebody's going to go on to
[1:13:57] until this body is changed
[1:14:01] he said well i don't know whether i can
[1:14:02] make it or not with all right then just
[1:14:05] don't get in nobody's way is that the
[1:14:08] best way the prophet had to say
[1:14:11] did he make that statement he said don't
[1:14:13] let me if i can't do it don't let me
[1:14:14] hinder somebody that can
[1:14:21] i've preached over 40 years
[1:14:27] and over the 40 years i've preached from
[1:14:29] genesis to revelation new creation new
[1:14:31] race
[1:14:36] but i admit right now that i've seen
[1:14:37] more about that in the past year than
[1:14:39] i've seen
[1:14:43] in all my life just trying to bring it
[1:14:47] to you
[1:14:49] that you're a new creature
[1:14:52] but it's not finished
[1:14:56] this body is hindering us this body is
[1:14:59] in our way
[1:15:05] the statue of a perfect man is supposed
[1:15:07] to get involved
[1:15:09] want to try to take over this old flesh
[1:15:10] man
[1:15:12] and do it but see the bible says that
[1:15:15] jesus was the only one come on musician
[1:15:17] only one's to reach immortality
[1:15:22] eternal life in human flesh the lord
[1:15:25] jesus is the only person
[1:15:27] but see you and i'm gonna have to come
[1:15:29] that or we're not part of that new
[1:15:30] creation you race that he is
[1:15:33] i hope you listen to what i just said
[1:15:36] if we don't come to a change of the body
[1:15:40] we are not
[1:15:43] totally a new creation you race
[1:15:49] we're a new creature
[1:15:53] we're christian we're christian we're
[1:15:56] we have eternal life
[1:16:00] but when you talk about a new creation
[1:16:02] you race
[1:16:05] you're talking about god living in human
[1:16:08] flesh
[1:16:09] that has been made eternal
[1:16:13] you mean you think that these bodies are
[1:16:15] going well if they're not what are we
[1:16:16] going to do
[1:16:18] i mean we're going to just keep dying
[1:16:19] and just keep running and just keep
[1:16:21] going and just
[1:16:22] just going away and just you know up
[1:16:24] another the group
[1:16:25] oh we'll get it in this generation if we
[1:16:28] don't we'll get it in another generation
[1:16:32] um time's running out
[1:16:36] whether you like it or not it's running
[1:16:38] out on every one of us
[1:16:39] physically speaking it's running out
[1:16:47] but you see if we can come to that point
[1:16:49] the new birth brings you to the point of
[1:16:51] a new creation
[1:16:56] but the change of the body is going to
[1:16:58] bring you to a new race
[1:17:01] a race that god before the world
[1:17:06] saw in his mind of what he wanted
[1:17:11] and he's going to provide that he said
[1:17:14] well we just can't do it what
[1:17:16] okay just don't get in the way of the
[1:17:18] others who want to
[1:17:20] you know what i'm saying in other words
[1:17:21] don't try to down something
[1:17:23] i just don't see what brother they are
[1:17:25] talking about i can't understand this
[1:17:27] and i'm saying
[1:17:28] well i are you in
[1:17:31] lifting up or tearing it down which way
[1:17:34] because you're tearing it down you're in
