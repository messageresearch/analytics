[13:32] appreciate each one of you and
[13:36] appreciate the lord
[13:38] getting us through and
[13:39] all of his blessings
[13:41] and we continue to pray for each one
[13:44] that's sick and needy
[13:46] and
[13:47] i don't know if brother bob mentioned it
[13:48] tonight i didn't i didn't hear but
[13:50] janine's at home tonight
[13:52] and i don't know if he mentioned that or
[13:54] not but
[13:55] uh jane's been sick she got a lot of
[13:57] nasal stuff and everything and just
[13:59] she ain't feeling too well so and y'all
[14:01] just prayed for her so
[14:04] she come home last night and tried to
[14:05] eat supper and after a while she just
[14:06] finally laid her head on the table so
[14:09] she was not feeling good so
[14:11] and because she started a new job she
[14:13] doesn't have any vacation or sick time
[14:14] or whatever she's just trying to play
[14:16] right through so y'all
[14:18] pray for her tonight and
[14:20] just remember
[14:22] a lady that i worked with her husband
[14:24] passed away
[14:26] yesterday and
[14:28] his name is tim bean and just remember
[14:30] the damn the bean family and all them
[14:32] they had just within the last few weeks
[14:34] they had just went to a house fire
[14:38] and
[14:39] it wasn't a full loss but if anybody's
[14:41] ever been to been to a house fire
[14:44] it ain't what they what gets burned up
[14:47] it's what gets damaged
[14:49] water damage everything gets wet and
[14:51] everything collapses if you ever go in a
[14:53] house and it's completely covered in wet
[14:55] sheet rock and insulation and and all
[14:58] that i mean there's just so much that
[14:59] gets ruined and
[15:01] and
[15:03] they just bought their daughter clothes
[15:05] for school and you know just a lot of
[15:07] different things and
[15:08] you know
[15:09] they've been trying to work on that and
[15:11] then he got sick and they ended up
[15:12] putting him in the hospital and then
[15:15] he was struggling and then just he took
[15:17] a turn
[15:18] and there was no turning back you just
[15:21] so y'all certainly remember her
[15:24] and and the two girls because
[15:27] i don't know what i do in their
[15:28] situation
[15:29] but we certainly can't hold them up
[15:31] because god is the one
[15:34] he's the god of all comfort he's a god
[15:37] of all answers so anyway i'll just
[15:39] remember them and i know brother rowell
[15:41] and all the different ones you know i
[15:42] think about
[15:44] you know different ones that
[15:46] have been sick and you you see that you
[15:48] know
[15:49] people have different issues and things
[15:51] going on but
[15:52] if i want to hold them up in prayer and
[15:54] because god
[15:56] is a god he has a prayer answering god
[16:00] and the thing is you keep holding them
[16:01] up for god
[16:03] because god said ask and you shall
[16:05] receive
[16:07] so we're just going to
[16:08] you know
[16:09] take him out of his word
[16:12] so
[16:12] god bless you now we're going to look in
[16:14] the scripture in matthew chapter one
[16:17] very familiar scripture
[16:18] and uh
[16:19] i titled this
[16:21] that it might be fulfilled which is
[16:23] part of the the scripture here than in
[16:26] the reading and
[16:28] we're going to tonight i
[16:31] i want to look at the life of jesus
[16:35] but i want to look at the birth of and
[16:36] the prophecies
[16:39] and i want and i want to
[16:41] with god's help i want to look at
[16:43] something
[16:45] because
[16:47] i want to
[16:48] read something that brother brown said
[16:49] because we understand that you know many
[16:51] times people look and they say well god
[16:53] spoke to peter
[16:55] and peter had a revelation well that
[16:57] didn't remove all of peter's doubts
[17:00] they didn't remove all of that peter's
[17:02] confusion
[17:04] you know but he didn't have a revelation
[17:07] so
[17:08] i just want to look at this that it
[17:09] might be fulfilled the scripture
[17:11] looking at the old testament prophecies
[17:13] in the life of jesus and just just in
[17:15] the first part of you know his life
[17:17] because i don't want to
[17:18] uh there's so many things to get into
[17:20] and i just want to cover this part i
[17:22] don't want to be long tonight but just
[17:24] uh share a few things with you and
[17:27] maybe we'll pick this up some other time
[17:28] but
[17:29] uh y'all just pray for me tonight

[19:38] and
[19:38] speak to each heart
[19:40] you know we just committed to you in the
[19:41] name of jesus christ we pray amen
[19:44] matthew chapter 1 verse 18 very familiar
[19:48] scripture it says now the birth of jesus
[19:50] was on this was
[19:52] when as his mother was espoused to
[19:54] joseph before they came together he was
[19:56] found she was found with child of the
[19:58] holy ghost
[20:00] then joseph her husband being a just man
[20:02] and not willing to make her a public
[20:04] example was minded to put her away
[20:06] privately
[20:07] but while he thought on these things
[20:09] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[20:12] unto him in a dream saying joseph thou
[20:14] son of david fear not to take unto thee
[20:17] mary thy wife for that which is
[20:19] conceived in her is of the holy ghost
[20:21] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[20:24] shalt call his name jesus and he shall
[20:27] save his people from their sins
[20:30] now all this was done that it might be
[20:33] fulfilled which was spoken of the lord
[20:35] by the prophet saying behold a virgin
[20:37] shall be with child and shall bring
[20:39] forth a son and they shall call his name
[20:41] immanuel which being interpreted
[20:44] is god with us amen god bless you
[20:46] tonight you have your seats
[20:50] and
[20:55] i want to speak
[20:59] and
[21:00] looking at this
[21:01] and you know god
[21:04] has always wanted to make himself known
[21:09] and everything that he's done is is to
[21:11] make his self known it's
[21:13] you know he
[21:14] he was he dwelt along but when he
[21:17] created man he wanted to
[21:19] reveal himself in the fullness in in all
[21:22] things and and let
[21:25] uh reveal the you know who he was in in
[21:27] the essence of him
[21:30] make himself known
[21:32] and when he began to do that
[21:35] he had to speak
[21:37] to prophets
[21:40] there was an essential part
[21:42] in that you know he wrote
[21:43] he wrote three bibles
[21:45] we know he wrote one in the heavens
[21:47] we know we know it was the pyramid
[21:50] but he began to speak to man
[21:52] and he wanted man to know he wanted to
[21:54] speak to man to let him know
[21:56] who he was and
[21:58] his fullness
[22:00] but you know when he began to speak
[22:04] as
[22:05] brother wade was speaking the other day
[22:07] you know when when you look at when god
[22:10] began to speak in amos 3 when he said he
[22:14] said he would do nothing except he would
[22:16] he would reveal his secret
[22:18] to his servants the prophets
[22:20] when he began to speak
[22:22] see
[22:24] when brother brahm said this great
[22:26] mystery secret that god had from the
[22:27] foundation of the world he had this
[22:29] thing this thing that he wanted to make
[22:31] known well when he began to speak
[22:34] to the prophets
[22:35] the prophets began to see these things
[22:38] but then when they began to write about
[22:40] it
[22:41] see when when nahum was there and he saw
[22:44] the chariots jostling in the streets and
[22:47] the running with lanterns and running
[22:48] like lightning and all these things well
[22:50] he could express it in the words that he
[22:52] knew
[22:54] but but he couldn't express
[22:56] cars
[22:58] because he had never seen that but he
[23:00] began to express that
[23:02] now see it was a secret to nahum
[23:05] when he when he saw that thing just like
[23:07] when isaiah stood there and said behold
[23:09] a virgin shall conceive
[23:12] now that was what god spoke to
[23:14] as isaiah now he saw this and he began
[23:18] to speak it
[23:20] but the problem is just like many times
[23:21] whether i'm talking about the the
[23:23] prophets you know they had to stop and
[23:24] say well you know where did that come
[23:26] from
[23:27] because even even in their own speaking
[23:29] they were they didn't have full
[23:31] understanding of what they was just what
[23:33] they were speaking but they spoke what
[23:35] what god give them to speak
[23:37] they didn't have all the answers they
[23:38] didn't understand everything but they
[23:39] spoke what god gave them
[23:41] so when he begins to speak there was a
[23:43] the secret was when he began to make it
[23:46] known
[23:47] even in the heavens and everything that
[23:49] he began to do he was revealing it but
[23:52] it was a secret
[23:54] but
[23:55] he began but that was also a part of a
[23:58] revelation because he began to reveal
[24:00] himself he began to unveil himself
[24:03] but the problem is is has he began to
[24:05] unveil himself that created a mystery
[24:09] because because if if brother wade and i
[24:12] have a secret
[24:13] until i begin to speak of that nobody
[24:16] else knows about it but me and brother
[24:17] white
[24:19] that's the myth there's a secret between
[24:21] us
[24:24] so when he began to speak to him then
[24:26] they had to speak well they began to
[24:27] speak with what they began to speak make
[24:29] no sense to some people
[24:32] because that created the mystery
[24:34] but he began to unveil himself and he
[24:37] began to veil unveil himself all through
[24:39] the prophets
[24:42] as the scripture the prophets built the
[24:44] body
[24:45] well as they began to speak the word
[24:47] then they started to walk in the in the
[24:48] light he began to make himself known in
[24:51] the prophets
[24:53] so as he began to unveil himself through
[24:55] the prophets yet people didn't see that
[24:59] how many people understood that when
[25:00] moses walked and he began to speak that
[25:03] that was god veiled in flesh
[25:07] no that was just that honorary guy that
[25:09] pushed us around and made our lives
[25:11] miserable
[25:14] they just saw a man in flesh
[25:18] why because if if uh miriam
[25:23] what she would just become con he just
[25:24] moses just become common to her her it
[25:28] was just her brother it was just a
[25:29] common person
[25:31] and aaron in the same situation
[25:34] that they would say something against
[25:35] moses and not realizing he was the
[25:38] anointed prophet
[25:41] then what happened see god come back to
[25:43] miriam and rebuked her
[25:46] for for saying against the prophet
[25:50] now to her it's just her brother
[25:54] but to god see it was an important
[25:56] office
[25:57] and she did not
[25:59] uh honor the pro the office of the
[26:01] prophet
[26:04] so she didn't see so many times they you
[26:06] know as as jesus began to speak later on
[26:09] you know he's like you know how many of
[26:10] the prophets that you didn't kill
[26:14] but you but you uh honor their
[26:15] supplicures and all these things but you
[26:18] killed them
[26:20] you stood against them
[26:22] you didn't you didn't stay with their
[26:24] word
[26:25] but now years later when they look back
[26:27] oh what a great prophet jeremiah was
[26:32] you know what a great prophet isaiah was
[26:36] but the when but when you look at the
[26:37] forefathers when he turned back when
[26:39] jesus began to point them back to their
[26:41] fathers
[26:42] and their forefathers he said he said
[26:44] look what they didn't they didn't honor
[26:46] moses they didn't honor any of these
[26:48] things
[26:50] and as and as time progressed we see how
[26:53] things begin to open and because because
[26:56] of them not staying with the word
[26:59] they created their own denomination
[27:03] now
[27:04] brother branham said here and he said
[27:06] why am i against
[27:08] organized religion
[27:10] he says
[27:13] he said so see nicodemus's organization
[27:16] understanding meant nothing to god
[27:19] now no matter if he was a big shot as we
[27:22] call it in the organization a master in
[27:24] israel of all his learning and
[27:26] understanding it didn't mean that
[27:29] when he stood before christ only a
[27:30] rebuke to him now i imagine all the
[27:33] people say holy father nicodemus holy
[27:35] father nicodemus we bow to you sir but
[27:38] when jesus
[27:40] he stood before god he rebuked him for
[27:42] his ignorance
[27:44] so you see what all that goes to forget
[27:48] it
[27:48] come on let's go to god that's right all
[27:50] right neither did cora's great
[27:52] understanding mean anything or adam's
[27:55] each denying god's vindicated message
[27:59] now let's listen close now we're going
[28:00] to get into some high waters in a minute
[28:02] see each one of them the reason that
[28:04] they got in trouble nicodemus cora
[28:06] nimrod and so forth is because they
[28:08] didn't recognize god's messenger with
[28:10] the vindicated word of that day
[28:12] anyone knows that no we've said that
[28:14] that a long time but god predicts and
[28:16] says a certain thing will take place man
[28:18] makes organization
[28:20] gets man set just exactly they believe
[28:23] that there was a coming messiah
[28:25] owe them jews
[28:27] oh my sure
[28:29] but when jesus come the way he did they
[28:31] said that can't be him
[28:33] they fail to understand the word
[28:36] now jesus didn't come contrary to the
[28:38] word did he
[28:40] but he come contrary to the organization
[28:43] interpretation of the word
[28:45] moses didn't come contrary to the word
[28:47] but he come exactly with the word but
[28:49] cora failed to see it and all down
[28:51] through it's that way
[28:54] and he says now look
[28:56] this message of the day just can't be
[28:58] something saying we got the truth and we
[29:00] got this and that
[29:02] he said it has to be foretold in his
[29:04] word
[29:05] then after the word is brought forth it
[29:07] has to be properly vindicated by the
[29:09] word
[29:10] jesus was properly vindicated of god by
[29:12] the word he said if you had known moses
[29:15] you'd have known me known of my day
[29:18] well did the prophet speak of him well
[29:20] all the prophets said what he was and
[29:23] yet it blinded them they couldn't
[29:25] understand it see but jesus was and i
[29:27] don't i want to say this for the tape
[29:30] and for you see the messenger with the
[29:32] message of the day
[29:39] now some of y'all probably got
[29:42] probably have some idea of where i want
[29:44] to
[29:45] where i want to go with all this
[29:47] but i want but i want i want to lay a
[29:49] background
[29:50] looking at the life of jesus
[29:52] because when you see the life of jesus
[29:54] and and you see there's so many things
[29:56] that when you when you begin to study
[29:58] all of the things that when jesus came
[30:01] and all of the the things of the
[30:02] scripture and the jews and i mean you
[30:04] know brother brethren
[30:06] i said one time he was talking about
[30:09] you know he said we got 900
[30:10] denominations and he said you know the
[30:13] the pharisees they had like four or five
[30:15] you know the pharisees the sadducees all
[30:16] the religious jews of the day they all
[30:19] had he said they all had their own way
[30:22] he said he said when he began to
[30:24] prophesy and when the scripture began to
[30:27] speak and they began to speak of
[30:29] of john coming
[30:32] that there would be a forerunner to
[30:34] jesus before the messiah would come now
[30:36] when they began to speak and he
[30:39] would say that he was going to
[30:41] come
[30:42] but yet when they looked
[30:45] they were
[30:47] looking for somebody great
[30:51] because of all the scriptures that that
[30:53] the old testament prophets and all of
[30:55] the religious leaders had read
[30:58] there was nothing in the life of john
[31:00] that fulfilled any of the scriptures
[31:02] he didn't he didn't fulfill any of that
[31:06] but he fulfilled the scriptures but it
[31:08] took
[31:08] because you know when you're when you're
[31:10] looking they were looking forward
[31:13] to the prophecies
[31:16] but it takes looking back
[31:18] because jesus spent all of his time
[31:20] pointing them back to the scripture
[31:22] showing that the scriptures had already
[31:23] been fulfilled
[31:26] because how many times did they stand
[31:27] there and even when they asked jesus
[31:29] about elijah coming and he said you know
[31:32] we thought elijah would come and he said
[31:34] he shall truly come but i tell you he's
[31:38] already come
[31:41] and then they perceive by is what he
[31:42] said then they realized that he was
[31:44] speaking of john john had come and
[31:46] fulfilled the scripture but they didn't
[31:48] see that
[31:50] when the when the uh when the when
[31:53] campus and or
[31:55] cleopas and then on the road to emmaus
[31:57] when they began to speak
[32:00] they began to speak the whole time of
[32:02] the word
[32:04] in the presence of the word
[32:06] and they didn't realize what was going
[32:08] on
[32:09] and that well and even when he began to
[32:12] when jesus began to speak to him and
[32:13] tell him shouldn't all these things have
[32:15] taken place didn't you hear these things
[32:18] didn't you know these things and yet
[32:19] they were dull of hearing they were
[32:21] blind
[32:23] and he spent all that time beginning to
[32:24] speak to them
[32:28] but when
[32:31] with jesus
[32:33] when the word came
[32:36] so as the prophecies began to unfold
[32:40] for jesus to come
[32:42] there were many that didn't uh
[32:45] see those things because he said you
[32:47] know they had been taught
[32:50] all of these things by the by the
[32:53] religious leaders of the day
[32:56] and brother bradham says in in the
[32:58] message
[32:59] the evening messenger
[33:01] he says now take for instance jesus this
[33:04] is quote number two brothers he said now
[33:06] take
[33:06] let's take for instance jesus how hard
[33:08] it was for him to come and change the
[33:10] message from law to grace
[33:13] yet the bible said it would come that
[33:14] way
[33:15] there'd come a messiah and the daily
[33:18] sacrifice would be taken away
[33:20] now we know it was prophesied through
[33:21] the prophets
[33:23] what a great thing it was for him
[33:26] to do that
[33:27] but we find
[33:29] we find that he did it
[33:31] and the one he did it because the
[33:33] scripture said and the believers of that
[33:34] day so-called believers absolutely would
[33:37] not agree with him
[33:39] look at all those pharisees and
[33:41] sadducees they had their own traditions
[33:44] and not one's going to shake them from
[33:46] it
[33:47] that's what they believed
[33:49] their mother believed that their daddy
[33:51] believed that
[33:52] and their grandpa grandma believed that
[33:55] and moses said so
[33:59] but the same moses that give the law was
[34:02] the same moses
[34:03] said this guy would come and they failed
[34:05] to recognize it because they had got the
[34:08] true word of god in traditions and had
[34:10] left off the main principle of it and it
[34:13] had and it had to be that way
[34:16] so when they began to speak they he
[34:18] began to speak but they had their own
[34:20] traditions
[34:22] they had their own ideas about how
[34:23] things would be
[34:26] but it was you know as jesus as the
[34:28] prophets began to speak to to the people
[34:32] see each time he the prophets came and
[34:34] each time they came they pointed the
[34:36] people back to the prophecies that had
[34:38] already come
[34:40] and began to speak to the people about
[34:42] about what had been spoken
[34:45] and trying to point them back and tell
[34:47] him y'all have erred
[34:49] and how many times did he raise
[34:51] like jeremiah and the different ones god
[34:53] rose them up and tell them you go speak
[34:54] to them and tell them
[34:58] when he began to speak to him he said he
[35:00] said he said you have left me
[35:03] the fountain of living water
[35:05] and he said you have hewed out cisterns
[35:08] he said broken cisterns i can hold no
[35:10] water
[35:13] now you know how how silly is a person
[35:17] when you come to a place when you when
[35:19] you're seeing i you have left an
[35:21] artesian whale of living water
[35:24] and god began to speak back to that
[35:26] living water the whole time and he told
[35:28] them he said y'all chewed out your own
[35:30] cisterns
[35:31] he said he said you're dry you have no
[35:33] water you have nothing but he said i
[35:35] keep pointing you back
[35:38] just as the children of israel was with
[35:40] moses and he began to lead him he told
[35:42] me listen i'll bring you out by a strong
[35:44] hand
[35:46] when he began to bring the children of
[35:48] israel out of bondage
[35:51] they thought how are we going to how are
[35:52] we going to come out
[35:56] but you know they had enough faith to
[35:57] believe in what god said
[36:00] they stood there with their shoes on at
[36:02] their staffing their hand and eating the
[36:04] even the eating that lamb that had been
[36:06] cooked complete
[36:11] yeah whole know it always amazes me when
[36:13] that when he talks about how they cook
[36:15] you know he said they couldn't separate
[36:16] anything they had to cook it whole well
[36:17] you know you know the intros and all
[36:19] that kind of stuff is in there when you
[36:21] cook that thing it might not have been
[36:22] the greatest smelling food you ever had
[36:24] in front of you
[36:26] but you know what it spoke of the entire
[36:28] word the fullness of the word had come
[36:29] that they were supposed to eat
[36:31] they were to eat of that word and then
[36:33] they were supposed to come and then at
[36:35] the midnight they were at the time they
[36:37] were supposed to leave he said when the
[36:38] death angel come through he said it was
[36:40] going to destroy them he said but you'll
[36:42] come out of this
[36:43] he said why because you've marked the
[36:45] door
[36:48] so when you've marked the door then you
[36:50] have then you have a protection why
[36:51] because you followed the word
[36:54] so when you followed the word then when
[36:56] he come then when the death angel passed
[36:58] he could not touch them but the ones
[37:00] that didn't have faith that didn't
[37:01] believe then there was death but then it
[37:03] was all the time that they come out
[37:06] and as they begin to come out of out of
[37:08] bondage then here's here's this amazing
[37:11] thing that you know
[37:12] pharaoh didn't want them to leave
[37:14] but you know what they were able to
[37:16] leave
[37:18] but you know the first the first hiccup
[37:19] they had the first little problem they
[37:20] had and they all fell apart
[37:22] even moses did
[37:24] that's right
[37:26] he's out there getting what lord what am
[37:27] i going to do he said why christ down to
[37:29] me speak and go forward he said you've
[37:31] been anointed you've been called you've
[37:33] been you've been brought to this place
[37:36] so if you've been brought to this and
[37:38] why are you crying to me he said you
[37:39] know what to do
[37:42] so then he began to speak and do the
[37:43] things that god told him to do that it
[37:45] was time for him to go and they cost
[37:48] over then when when they crossed over
[37:51] the red sea then when they come over
[37:53] then in the midst of all that then they
[37:54] look back and saw their enemies coming
[37:58] he's like well you know what we're not
[37:59] getting into i thought we're going to
[38:00] get away from them here they come
[38:02] where are we going to go now
[38:05] well you know what they didn't wait on
[38:07] god
[38:11] see they should have been up there
[38:12] rejoicing why because they were getting
[38:13] ready they were looking at destruction
[38:17] their enemy was being going to be
[38:19] destroyed right in front of them but
[38:20] they were saying oh i don't know how
[38:21] we're going to get through this do you
[38:23] see all that that big cloud of smoke or
[38:26] dust coming up from those chariots here
[38:28] they come
[38:30] and you know they're so worried
[38:32] all we're going to do now moses look at
[38:34] him
[38:36] but what'd he say
[38:38] stand still
[38:40] see the salvation of god
[38:44] then when they saw their enemies
[38:46] destroyed you know then they had
[38:48] pentecostal revival they were rejoicing
[38:52] but i mean they couldn't they couldn't
[38:54] see the miracle that god had done for
[38:56] them but the next time they had a
[38:57] problem they wanted to come and argue
[38:59] with moses
[39:02] it's like uh y'all remember
[39:04] the red sea miracle army getting killed
[39:07] you remember that
[39:09] right well that's what god done
[39:10] yesterday we don't know what he's gonna
[39:12] do today
[39:14] but he promised him that he'd take him
[39:16] to a land flowing with milk and honey
[39:20] it's like out here in the wilderness are
[39:22] you in the are you gonna lay enough milk
[39:23] honey no well guess what
[39:25] you still gotta go
[39:29] he didn't he didn't leave them
[39:32] just in just in the old testament when
[39:34] you began to look when he hit when he
[39:36] made the ark of the covenant the ark of
[39:38] the testimony as the scripture calls it
[39:41] when you see the alt or the testimony
[39:43] what was it what was it about the test
[39:45] the ark of the testimony what was that
[39:49] that was that was not only was it a
[39:51] rebuke to them but it was but it was a
[39:53] monument
[39:56] it was a
[39:57] token
[39:59] to them of what god had done for them
[40:04] one because he brought them through
[40:07] and he fed them and he brought them
[40:10] through
[40:13] and they they wanted to argue who was
[40:14] going who was going to lead us who was
[40:16] going to lead us well they put all the
[40:17] rods in
[40:18] and before the ark of the covenant
[40:21] in the holy place and guess what it
[40:24] aaron's rod budded the rest of them
[40:26] didn't
[40:28] but it was a supernatural event to the
[40:30] people
[40:33] but he showed who he had called
[40:36] it was a supernatural so when when they
[40:38] had when they had aaron's rod that had
[40:40] budded and the almonds
[40:43] he was showing that god had done a
[40:44] supernatural event to them
[40:47] he had done the supernatural when he fed
[40:49] rain manna down from heaven every single
[40:51] day and they went out and they and they
[40:53] gathered every man to their their
[40:55] fullness and they never went hungry
[40:59] but he took an omer of that and he put
[41:00] it in there and every time the priest
[41:02] would come up and he would enter into
[41:04] the priesthood he could go in there and
[41:06] eat that but it was a testimony to them
[41:10] and the tablets
[41:12] of god speaking the word to them
[41:15] god spoke to the word and what was it
[41:17] they it was god in letter form but they
[41:19] thought they were just getting rules
[41:21] they did not see that it was a
[41:22] supernatural happening
[41:25] moses is in the mountain and god's
[41:27] speaking to him and he's writing the
[41:28] word in the tablets and they're down
[41:31] there messing with a golden calf
[41:35] but he began to speak to oh they thought
[41:36] well god had left us out here we're out
[41:38] here moses in the mountain he's gone
[41:40] what are we going to do
[41:42] well we got to get it we got to start a
[41:43] denomination out here we got to have our
[41:45] own
[41:47] well they got away from god in our and
[41:49] god was you know stay where you are god
[41:51] you're right where you need to be
[41:54] but not not to them they have oh we got
[41:56] it we got to work out we get nervous
[41:58] and here they are they're going right
[41:59] out and getting into the end of these
[42:01] things
[42:03] turning their back on the word and yet
[42:05] god laid that testimony out there the
[42:07] ark and he said listen he said it was a
[42:08] rebuke to them because they did not
[42:10] believe the word but it was a rebuke to
[42:12] them because god followed them all the
[42:14] way through
[42:15] he carried them all the way through he
[42:17] blessed them all the way through but
[42:19] they were the ones that turned him down
[42:21] he didn't turn them down
[42:25] and it's the same thing brother sisters
[42:27] you know
[42:29] we have been so blessed
[42:36] this is from the message presuming
[42:39] it's number three
[42:41] he said when god when john came to
[42:43] introduce which was the right way
[42:46] the pharisees had their way sadducees
[42:48] had their way the publicans had their
[42:50] way different ones had their way their
[42:52] denominations organizations john didn't
[42:54] go to any of their schools he went in
[42:57] the wilderness and waited he studied the
[43:00] word the first thing you know god told
[43:02] him out there in the wilderness that
[43:04] this messiah
[43:06] would have a sign following him
[43:08] as he always did what he talked about
[43:11] last night what we talked about last
[43:12] night so john waited he didn't join any
[43:15] of them he just waited till he was sure
[43:17] he didn't presume anything
[43:19] he said no wait see there's the
[43:21] pharisees they're good people they're
[43:22] holiness people why sure that's all
[43:25] right he didn't i presume they're all
[43:27] right that wasn't god see
[43:28] john waited for the sign
[43:31] john waited till he was sure see
[43:33] certainly did he didn't presume he
[43:34] waited until he was sure he had seen the
[43:37] true sign of the
[43:38] messiah he said nathan as soon as he as
[43:41] irritable as he could be see he just
[43:42] said now
[43:43] i don't believe it i'll have to see it
[43:46] when he got up there and seen it was the
[43:47] messiah it was satisfied then he said he
[43:49] didn't presume he just waited until he'd
[43:52] seen it
[43:55] so each one of them
[43:58] so they had their own way
[44:00] they had their own ways of seeing things
[44:04] but god had spoken to them through the
[44:06] prophets
[44:10] but instead instead of waiting like john
[44:12] did john waited
[44:14] he didn't understand he but he saw what
[44:15] was given to him that that the messiah
[44:17] would be there with a sign
[44:19] right
[44:20] but they you had to wait on him to give
[44:23] the revelation
[44:24] he said he waited for him the sign to
[44:26] take place he knew what was going to
[44:27] take place
[44:28] and then when when that took place then
[44:30] he would he would know who was who was
[44:32] the one
[44:35] but see
[44:37] when you go back and and study the the
[44:39] pro the prophecies
[44:42] and
[44:44] you know many times what we look at we
[44:45] look at the denominational world that we
[44:46] live today and
[44:48] even the
[44:50] the message
[44:52] in and around this message and we see so
[44:55] many things that people believe and
[44:57] preach and and it's like you know i mean
[44:59] people will believe things that's not
[45:00] even in the scripture and things that
[45:02] are even contrary to the things that
[45:03] brother branham said in black and white
[45:07] but what is it they don't they don't
[45:09] hold to to the to because it's like well
[45:12] i've you know they've got to presume
[45:13] they got to try to answer these
[45:15] questions no you wait on god
[45:19] i know i don't try to figure these
[45:20] things out we because god didn't tell us
[45:23] to figure it out he told us to believe
[45:25] it
[45:27] because if you believe these things then
[45:28] it be made known to you
[45:32] and as he began he's speaking to the uh
[45:35] the disciples you know he said he said
[45:36] if you believe these things he said the
[45:37] greater things you'll see
[45:40] but you have to believe these things and
[45:42] wait on god because at the right time
[45:44] god will let these things be made dawn
[45:47] and you know
[45:49] when i began to look at these things and
[45:51] and you see the the situation and and
[45:53] the the history of of a lot of uh
[45:57] the things that that are spoken of the
[45:59] uh
[46:01] of the prophets
[46:02] and the messiah
[46:04] and a lot of the the um
[46:07] jewish understanding you know many times
[46:09] people
[46:10] that's the reason i was struck by what
[46:12] brother brown was talking about he said
[46:13] you know the pharisees and the sadducees
[46:14] you know they all had their own own way
[46:16] of things the way they done things what
[46:18] they believed and you know even even
[46:20] down through history you go back and you
[46:22] start to read all of the the re the
[46:24] writings
[46:26] of the prophets of the rabbis
[46:29] and you think you think that we we live
[46:31] in a screwed up mess
[46:33] and then you begin to see that even
[46:35] though even the rabbis had their
[46:37] problems
[46:39] i mean it was so it was so because when
[46:41] you go back and you start to look
[46:43] because and you know because the
[46:45] scripture tells us one of the biggest
[46:47] problems that the jews had
[46:50] is that because jew the jews when they
[46:53] saw the writings of when they when you
[46:55] look at the writings of the messiah
[46:58] the the writings of the messiah have to
[47:01] do with a mighty conqueror
[47:05] you know because you know when you start
[47:07] to if you go back and look and as you
[47:09] know he talks about
[47:11] isaiah 9 6 says for unto us a child is
[47:14] born unto us a son is given and the
[47:17] government shall be upon his shoulder
[47:19] and his name shall be called wonderful
[47:20] counselor the mighty god the everlasting
[47:22] father the prince of peace
[47:24] of the increase of his government and
[47:26] peace there shall be no end upon the
[47:28] throne of david and upon his kingdom to
[47:31] order it and to establish it with
[47:33] judgment and with justice from
[47:34] henceforth
[47:35] even forever the zeal of the lord of
[47:38] hosts will perform this
[47:40] so when they began to speak of the
[47:43] messiah they saw a mighty conqueror
[47:47] that's all they saw because when they
[47:48] were looking forward to the prophecies
[47:50] that's all they saw
[47:52] because there was lots of prophecies
[47:54] that were given that they don't
[47:56] attribute to the messiah because all
[47:58] they saw was a mighty conqueror because
[48:01] when when moses stood up and said god
[48:03] will raise up a prophet like unto me
[48:07] then they look forward to a mighty
[48:09] conqueror
[48:10] and when they when they look at the
[48:12] scriptures of david he said he said he
[48:14] was set on the throne of david well
[48:16] they're looking for a mighty conqueror
[48:18] he said the government shall be on upon
[48:20] his shoulders and he said upon his
[48:21] kingdom he said there shall be no end so
[48:24] when they began to look that's all they
[48:26] saw was a mighty conqueror
[48:29] there's coming a day where we will rule
[48:31] the world
[48:33] our god will be the the god of this of
[48:36] the world
[48:37] he will there will be a kingdom set up
[48:40] that will that will establish peace and
[48:42] prosperity and all these things all
[48:44] throughout the world
[48:46] and that's what they're looking for
[48:48] that's all they see
[48:50] when they begin to look forward to see
[48:52] and so all of the you look at all the
[48:54] scriptures that's all that's all they
[48:55] can see is a mighty conqueror
[48:58] but they don't see the rest of it
[49:02] and so when they begin to argue there's
[49:04] there's many scriptures that that you
[49:06] look at in the writings of the uh rabbis
[49:10] all the way back through history you
[49:11] know they they all
[49:12] they all had some
[49:14] odd ideas about things
[49:22] in genesis
[49:24] 3 15 it says i will put my enmity
[49:26] between thee and the woman and between
[49:28] thy seed and her seed and it shall
[49:30] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[49:33] his heel
[49:36] now they they a tribute to when you go
[49:38] back and read some of that do you know
[49:39] they attribute that to adam and his
[49:42] descendants
[49:44] they don't attribute that to one person
[49:49] and even even in in some of the
[49:51] categories when you begin to look at the
[49:53] writings and they even have some rabbis
[49:56] in the past when they begin to speak of
[49:57] these things and they would say well
[49:58] what about this and what about that do
[50:00] you know that some rabbis actually
[50:02] believe there to be two two messiahs
[50:08] why because they said well the one
[50:10] messiah has to be the mighty conqueror
[50:12] but the other one will suffer
[50:16] it's like have you you know and it's
[50:18] like you wonder why brother i'm talking
[50:19] about there was 900 different
[50:20] denominations in the in the pharisees
[50:22] and the sadducees and all them they all
[50:24] had their own ways of looking at things
[50:27] why because they could they couldn't
[50:28] wrap their mind around that that the
[50:30] that the messiah would come
[50:33] like when brother rambled speaking to
[50:35] the rabbi that day and he asked him
[50:36] about isaiah 9 6.
[50:40] see when he began to look at that you
[50:42] know he said well tell me what part of
[50:44] it he didn't fulfill
[50:47] see when they began to look at the
[50:49] scriptures see they they saw that mighty
[50:50] conqueror
[50:53] but there was a lot of things in the
[50:54] scripture they couldn't put together
[50:57] but instead instead of just waiting on
[50:59] god to show these things what they do
[51:01] they started making their own
[51:02] denominations
[51:05] and then one says well it's this way and
[51:07] one says it's that way
[51:12] and then they don't need to even
[51:13] attribute genesis 3 15 to the messiah
[51:18] and then when when you begin to look at
[51:19] all these things i mean they're they're
[51:21] so over the years that they've come up
[51:23] with all these ideas and no wonder when
[51:25] you when you begin to look at all these
[51:26] things that were written
[51:30] one of the things that some of them were
[51:31] writing about was that
[51:33] the messiah didn't even have to be born
[51:36] a virgin
[51:39] someone believe hey as long as long as
[51:40] he was born and he was anointed he was
[51:43] anointed the messiah
[51:47] so when so when you when you when you
[51:49] get begin together about these things
[51:51] and even even today the the jews there's
[51:53] a groups of jews that don't even believe
[51:55] they ought to be in the homeland
[51:58] they're against they're against being in
[52:00] palestine they don't even believe
[52:02] because they don't believe that they
[52:03] should be there until the messiah comes
[52:08] so when you begin to look at all these
[52:09] different things and even even when it
[52:11] comes to the scriptures of daniel
[52:14] of daniel 9 when you begin to read some
[52:16] of the writings of the daniel 9 and even
[52:18] then they don't even attribute that to
[52:20] the messiah
[52:23] and some of the writings that were
[52:24] written they don't even they attribute
[52:26] to other people
[52:28] didn't even attribute that to and they
[52:30] were talking about all these different
[52:31] ones that come through and one of the
[52:33] problems that they had was they couldn't
[52:34] understand the 70 weeks because they
[52:36] couldn't understand it because they
[52:38] couldn't line up the 483 years
[52:43] but but they have all these groups and
[52:45] one says well i believe it's this one
[52:46] and i believe it's that one
[52:48] and you know they were they were so
[52:49] they're so con convinced of what they
[52:52] believe that you know that they said
[52:54] that the prophet was wrong when he gave
[52:56] the dates and the years and the weeks
[53:02] they are so convinced of what they
[53:03] believe that they stand there and say
[53:05] that none of this is correct
[53:08] because it's spiritual time it's not
[53:09] natural years
[53:12] and some of them sit there and they're
[53:14] trying to figure this thing out and say
[53:15] well some of them don't believe it's 30
[53:16] days to a month
[53:20] and that's and and that's a jewish
[53:21] that's a jewish law that's a jewish
[53:23] calendar
[53:24] to have 30 days in the i mean that's
[53:26] jewish law and yet they they have all
[53:28] these things and they try to prop these
[53:30] different things why because they don't
[53:31] understand it
[53:33] and so you begin to i mean when you
[53:35] begin to read some of these things and
[53:36] you and you wonder why
[53:39] when when you begin to see all these
[53:40] things when when the scriptures become
[53:42] to come if people if people had been
[53:45] pulled all these things and everybody
[53:47] was confused on all these different
[53:49] things then when he said when jesus came
[53:52] he said you're not in because you don't
[53:54] fit the scripture
[53:56] but what did what did brother brother
[53:57] brown said he said it's because you
[53:59] didn't fit their organizational their
[54:01] interpretation of the word
[54:03] you didn't you didn't fit their
[54:04] interpretation of the word not what was
[54:06] spoken
[54:07] why because they keep looking forward
[54:09] but they can't understand why because it
[54:12] takes god to give the revelation and
[54:14] then when he began to point back to the
[54:16] scriptures
[54:17] then he begins to open up
[54:19] and he began to see the revelation of it
[54:22] and it takes it takes god to do that
[54:26] but see they were so they were so
[54:27] confused on all these things and what
[54:28] was going to take place and when jesus
[54:30] began to speak to the to the disciples
[54:34] and he began to express all these things
[54:36] that he had spoken of himself
[54:40] and yet they were so confused on all
[54:42] these things and were still waiting on
[54:44] these things because that's all they
[54:45] were gripped by
[54:48] because here he was and he began to
[54:49] speak to him of all these scriptures and
[54:52] he began to point them back
[54:54] and he began to speak even when he spoke
[54:56] to the pharisees and he began to expound
[54:59] on the parables of the scripture
[55:01] and he began to open up the scriptures
[55:03] and he began to speak and rebuke and
[55:04] then the pharisees could give him an
[55:06] answer
[55:08] and they said why do you speak to them
[55:10] in parables
[55:13] so they don't understand
[55:15] but he said it's given to you
[55:17] to know the mysteries
[55:19] and so when they came they said well
[55:21] please explain us to the parable of the
[55:22] sower please explain us the parables
[55:26] so then he began to express the parables
[55:29] so when they began to look back
[55:31] he began to show them all the things
[55:33] that they had seen
[55:35] then they was like oh we understand that
[55:39] but in the but when it comes to after
[55:41] his resurrection when he was
[55:44] risen and he was about to leave them
[55:46] then the first thing that come out of
[55:47] their mouth is it now that you're going
[55:49] to restore the kingdom to israel
[55:53] and what did he say it's it's not this
[55:55] is not the time you forgot to know these
[55:57] times it's not for you to know these
[55:59] things he said he said but the one thing
[56:01] that i'm going to tell you the one thing
[56:02] that you will know
[56:04] of the things that you've known and i've
[56:05] breathed on you to receive the holy
[56:07] ghost he said you shall receive power
[56:10] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[56:12] and he said you shall be witnesses unto
[56:15] me
[56:16] in in jerusalem and judea and he said
[56:18] even the uttermost part of the earth
[56:21] so you'll be witnesses of me but you
[56:23] won't know these things but you but he
[56:25] said he said when he the spirit of truth
[56:27] has come he said he's going to lead you
[56:29] and guide you into all truth so the
[56:31] thing is is they held on so when when
[56:34] peter stood there and in matthew in 16
[56:37] when when jesus was speaking to peter
[56:39] and he and to the disciples and he asked
[56:41] him he said who do men say that i the
[56:43] son of man am
[56:44] when he began to ask them well we've
[56:46] heard all kinds of stuff
[56:48] that's right
[56:50] you're jeremiah
[56:51] one of the prophets you're you know
[56:53] you're somebody
[56:55] but who do you say that i am
[57:00] he said you're the christ the son of the
[57:02] living god
[57:04] it's what god jesus said blessed aren't
[57:06] you peter because god has revealed this
[57:08] to you
[57:10] this is what god has revealed to you
[57:12] amen
[57:13] and he said listen he said that's what
[57:14] we're going to build the church home
[57:16] he said upon this rock a revelation what
[57:19] god showed you he said that's what we're
[57:21] going to build the church on
[57:22] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[57:24] against it
[57:30] when we see all the scriptures that were
[57:32] written all the way through the
[57:35] through the scripture
[57:36] and he began to speak of all the things
[57:38] that had taken place
[57:41] yet he want he wanted them to know these
[57:43] things but he began to speak to him
[57:46] and you know even even when he rose from
[57:49] the dead
[57:51] and you know he was standing there in
[57:52] the and
[57:54] the ladies had went to the the sepulcher
[57:56] to uh
[57:58] prepare the body
[58:00] and they and he come and he told them
[58:02] listen he's risen
[58:05] and they couldn't believe it so
[58:07] we can't believe what he rose from the
[58:09] dead
[58:12] and the bible tells us he said and they
[58:13] remembered his words
[58:17] after all these things and they began to
[58:18] remember the words that he had spoken to
[58:20] him
[58:22] and so you know all the way through the
[58:24] scripture we began to see these things
[58:25] that that god had been speaking to the
[58:27] people and yet they didn't see these
[58:29] things
[58:32] even when we go back
[58:34] you know you think you think of those
[58:36] that you know they were the devout
[58:38] people that that were looking for these
[58:40] things and yet when when the things
[58:42] began to unfold to them they didn't see
[58:44] it
[58:47] you know what what amazed me is you look
[58:49] at the scripture in the in the in the
[58:51] scripture of jesus and we see that here
[58:54] here are these men
[58:56] they are talking about the the magis and
[58:59] you know the the great men they spent
[59:01] all of their time studying the stars
[59:03] they studied all of the sky and they
[59:05] knew everything they knew what was going
[59:06] to take place
[59:08] when they saw those supernatural things
[59:10] take place in the sky they knew
[59:11] something was going to take place
[59:13] and they come all of that way
[59:16] traveling
[59:18] for years to get to jesus
[59:21] and when they got there then they said
[59:23] where is he that was born king of the
[59:25] jews
[59:28] now what
[59:30] now listen we go to synagogue every day
[59:33] we got rabbi so-and-so preaching to us
[59:36] all the time
[59:37] well you what do you mean you got some
[59:39] who do he's out here come in there
[59:40] talking about the
[59:43] where is he born king of the jews what
[59:48] what are you talking about
[59:50] we don't know nothing about this
[59:54] but they began to expound what god had
[59:56] showed them what he had showed those
[59:58] magi that's
[59:59] and something had had quickened in them
[1:00:01] so much for them to journey all that way
[1:00:05] that wasn't going around the corner
[1:00:08] i wasn't going across town
[1:00:11] as long arduous journeys cold
[1:00:15] heat
[1:00:16] robbers you never know what those men
[1:00:19] had had to face all the way
[1:00:23] but something struck them and they went
[1:00:25] all this way
[1:00:27] and here and here here are these people
[1:00:29] good hearted honest people
[1:00:32] and they come in there and and when when
[1:00:35] mary
[1:00:36] had heard when gabriel had spoke to her
[1:00:38] she knew she had a revelation
[1:00:41] she knew what had taken place
[1:00:43] joseph knew what had taken place
[1:00:47] they had an angel visitation they it was
[1:00:49] it was supernatural to them they knew
[1:00:51] what took place
[1:00:54] but you know what a lot of people didn't
[1:00:55] believe that
[1:00:56] they didn't follow that
[1:01:00] and you know what there was a lot of
[1:01:01] days she probably didn't want to go out
[1:01:04] in public
[1:01:07] that's right when you when you have
[1:01:09] everybody that runs you down and
[1:01:12] you know when when they like brother ram
[1:01:13] talked about you know when he was when
[1:01:14] he was a young man and walked down the
[1:01:16] sidewalk people would walk on the other
[1:01:17] side of the side you know across the
[1:01:19] street because they didn't want to walk
[1:01:20] beside him
[1:01:23] and here's mary
[1:01:25] fulfilling god's word
[1:01:27] and they didn't want to have anything to
[1:01:29] do with her
[1:01:31] and she walked and had had to go through
[1:01:33] all that ridicule
[1:01:34] and all those things but you know what
[1:01:36] she knew what was in what was in what
[1:01:38] had taken place what god had showed her
[1:01:40] what joseph but when all of a sudden one
[1:01:42] of these days these men come in
[1:01:45] no doubt they probably looked a little
[1:01:47] funny probably looked a little different
[1:01:48] if they come from a far country they
[1:01:50] probably didn't dress like people in
[1:01:53] bethlehem or where you know
[1:01:55] nazareth galilei where
[1:01:59] they probably didn't dress the way they
[1:02:00] did
[1:02:02] probably had a little bit different
[1:02:04] speak language
[1:02:08] but when they walked in there that day
[1:02:10] and they saw that young
[1:02:12] child
[1:02:15] after they'd come all that way
[1:02:18] and they brought gold
[1:02:20] frankincense and myrrh
[1:02:26] when you think about what mary had heard
[1:02:31] and what the scriptures had said because
[1:02:33] when you know when gabriel had spoke to
[1:02:35] her when she went back and started
[1:02:36] reading the old testament prophets what
[1:02:38] isaiah and it became a brand new book to
[1:02:41] her
[1:02:42] it was it was it was illuminated well
[1:02:45] everybody else is looking forward but
[1:02:46] you know what she's starting to see
[1:02:47] these things open up
[1:02:50] and then when she when she saw that he
[1:02:52] shall save his people from their sins
[1:02:55] well if she understood what the gifts
[1:02:56] were that were brought by the wise men
[1:03:01] when you saw those gifts when they were
[1:03:03] bringing those things in
[1:03:06] no doubt it stirred something in that
[1:03:08] mother's heart
[1:03:13] to see
[1:03:14] men
[1:03:15] from a far country bring in and it was
[1:03:17] gold
[1:03:18] deity
[1:03:19] dedicated to death
[1:03:21] the gold frankincense and myrrh and if
[1:03:23] you if she understood what those things
[1:03:25] represented you know it had to touch her
[1:03:27] to see those things
[1:03:30] when she had when she had reached when
[1:03:32] jesus had reached the eighth day and
[1:03:35] they took him into the temple and
[1:03:37] you know simeon
[1:03:39] said i won't pass
[1:03:42] until i see the lord's christ
[1:03:45] and she was standing in that temple
[1:03:49] and no doubt no people some people
[1:03:50] wouldn't look at her
[1:03:53] and you know she was she was the
[1:03:55] off-scale of the earth you know
[1:03:59] as soon as she walked into that temple
[1:04:01] that day
[1:04:02] the holy spirit began to speak to simeon
[1:04:05] the fulfillment of the prophecy is here
[1:04:10] and it meant something to simeon
[1:04:12] and everybody well he's got one foot in
[1:04:14] the grave and went on a banana peel
[1:04:16] you know he's he's a good man but you
[1:04:18] know he's he's starting to slip a little
[1:04:19] bit you know he's oh we just we just
[1:04:21] humor him you know
[1:04:23] but when he walked out there that day
[1:04:26] and took that little baby in his arms
[1:04:30] and he stood there and held it
[1:04:34] oh my goodness
[1:04:36] thank god my eyes have seen my salvation
[1:04:42] it didn't mean anything else to other
[1:04:44] people people just stood there looked at
[1:04:45] him
[1:04:46] he hadn't lost his mind what's going on
[1:04:48] here
[1:04:50] and then anna began to prophesy
[1:04:53] of who he was
[1:04:54] and what he was supposed to do
[1:04:58] it didn't mean the other people they
[1:05:00] just saw this act they just saw these
[1:05:02] things they didn't mean anything but it
[1:05:04] spoke something to mary
[1:05:07] because she had walked all this time and
[1:05:08] those things but then she began to see
[1:05:10] these things open up
[1:05:13] and it's the same way see these things
[1:05:15] have begun to open up
[1:05:19] the world
[1:05:20] the world is not called to these things
[1:05:25] that's right but it's more precious than
[1:05:27] gold
[1:05:30] so
[1:05:31] when we see these things they were
[1:05:32] written in the scripture to
[1:05:34] know and it's and it's now time for
[1:05:37] these things to be fulfilled
[1:05:41] you know
[1:05:42] i went to my
[1:05:45] aunt's funeral monday
[1:05:49] and the and the preacher was up and
[1:05:51] and he he was speaking of
[1:05:53] of the of the things and he's like you
[1:05:55] know we don't understand all things paul
[1:05:57] said we don't see we see through like a
[1:05:58] glass darkly we don't see all these
[1:06:01] things
[1:06:02] but he said we know what paul said
[1:06:04] we know what god said and so it's not
[1:06:07] for us to understand these things
[1:06:11] but he said he said he's given these
[1:06:12] things he's for us to believe
[1:06:15] for us to trust in god when we see these
[1:06:17] things
[1:06:18] and he began to speak all the things
[1:06:19] through the scripture and he was and
[1:06:21] there were certain things that he began
[1:06:23] but he was talking about my aunt passed
[1:06:25] away and she had she had dementia
[1:06:29] that's not what
[1:06:30] killed her but uh she passed away from
[1:06:32] it she suffered with it for a number of
[1:06:34] years but
[1:06:36] you know we saw about you know we only
[1:06:38] see so much while we're here
[1:06:42] but he said he said then as time
[1:06:45] progressed she didn't know she knew less
[1:06:48] and less
[1:06:49] and then she was in a only world she
[1:06:50] didn't know her own family she didn't
[1:06:52] know anything
[1:06:54] but he said there's a beautiful day
[1:06:55] coming
[1:06:56] he said when she crossed over
[1:06:59] she had complete understanding
[1:07:01] there was a place that she went to
[1:07:03] that god began to show her these things
[1:07:07] he said he said i don't know he said i
[1:07:09] can i can tell you what the scripture
[1:07:10] says and he said i believe the
[1:07:11] scriptures
[1:07:13] he stood there and he said i don't know
[1:07:14] if god's coming to take this
[1:07:17] this body these elements that's in this
[1:07:19] casket i don't know if he's going to
[1:07:20] take these out or if he'll just create a
[1:07:22] body out of elements
[1:07:25] but he said i know we're going to have a
[1:07:26] glorified body amen
[1:07:29] he said i don't understand all the
[1:07:30] scriptures he said but i know we're
[1:07:32] going to be called up we're going to
[1:07:33] meet each other and we're going to be
[1:07:35] meet him in the air
[1:07:37] he said i don't know how all that's
[1:07:39] going to work out or all the
[1:07:40] he said we all got questions we don't
[1:07:41] know because we read things
[1:07:44] but he said there's a day coming
[1:07:46] we're going to have complete
[1:07:46] understanding
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:49] and you know the thing is is each day
[1:07:51] god wants to reveal something to you
[1:07:54] and you know it's you know sometimes it
[1:07:56] takes a long time we we read the same
[1:07:57] thing over and over and over
[1:07:59] and you know we have our own thoughts
[1:08:01] our own ideas about things
[1:08:03] because when you read something as a
[1:08:05] human it automatically creates a picture
[1:08:07] in your mind
[1:08:09] when you hear things all things
[1:08:11] automatically kick in your mind
[1:08:15] but then there comes a time
[1:08:18] that it has to be made known
[1:08:21] as peter said you know as a child as a
[1:08:22] child i spoke as a child i understood as
[1:08:24] a child
[1:08:25] but he said when i became a man he said
[1:08:27] i had to put
[1:08:28] childish things away
[1:08:30] there's a lot of things that we don't
[1:08:31] understand
[1:08:33] but you know we trust in god
[1:08:36] amen but you know there's a blessing
[1:08:38] because he said a real true eagle will
[1:08:40] understand
[1:08:43] peter
[1:08:44] peter and all of the disciples here they
[1:08:46] are walking in the midst of all this
[1:08:47] confusion
[1:08:49] and all the things that had happened and
[1:08:51] all the things that they saw but you
[1:08:53] know what they held on to what god had
[1:08:54] revealed to them amen
[1:08:57] and let's just hold
[1:08:58] to what god has revealed to us
[1:09:03] unless the musicians stand
[1:09:05] and come let's stand
[1:09:08] let's sing that song
[1:09:10] hold to god's unchanging hand
[1:09:17] because you know that's what we have to
[1:09:19] do we have to build our hopes
[1:09:22] and not just hopes but you know because
[1:09:24] it is
[1:09:24] it's a a hope
[1:09:28] because brother ram said
[1:09:30] our faith
[1:09:32] the majority of our faith is a mental
[1:09:33] faith
[1:09:34] but he said when the word is poured into
[1:09:36] that mental faith he said it becomes a
[1:09:37] spiritual revelation
[1:09:40] hold on to the things that god has said
[1:09:42] to you we know we know these things and
[1:09:45] he said hold on
[1:09:47] hold to god's unchanging hand
[1:09:50] because we may not know
[1:09:52] what things are going to happen but we
[1:09:53] know who holds tomorrow
[1:09:57] i was speaking to somebody the other day
[1:09:58] and
[1:09:59] they were
[1:10:01] we was talking about things that
[1:10:03] how things have happened and we don't
[1:10:06] see the future and a lot of you know a
[1:10:07] lot of questions and
[1:10:09] i told them i said
[1:10:11] i i got no worries about things
[1:10:15] i know i know what it was
[1:10:18] i was talking to somebody about the
[1:10:19] covet shot
[1:10:22] and i said well i i plan on taking it
[1:10:24] but if i had to i'd take it
[1:10:27] i told him i said i got i got confidence
[1:10:29] in god i said you know what he's brought
[1:10:31] me 47 years
[1:10:35] i i've made it i've made it this long
[1:10:36] and you know you can say well it was mom
[1:10:38] and daddy and and all this you know what
[1:10:40] it was god that got me here
[1:10:45] god it's been the grace of god i got 47
[1:10:47] years
[1:10:49] you know all the different ones that
[1:10:50] have been here you know
[1:10:52] many many years
[1:10:54] that you know 80 plus years and all that
[1:10:56] it's been god that's got us here
[1:10:59] you know because the scripture says you
[1:11:01] know grace has brought us this far and
[1:11:02] grace will lead us home amen
[1:11:05] i said god's brought me this far
[1:11:07] 47 years i've made it
[1:11:10] and i said everything has come and gone
[1:11:12] god's always been been my deliverer he's
[1:11:15] always been my waymaker he's always been
[1:11:17] my physician
[1:11:19] but if i told him i said but if i had a
[1:11:21] job that required me to take the shot
[1:11:23] you know what i told him
[1:11:25] i said brother dale always tells us when
[1:11:27] we get medicine he said come get you a
[1:11:28] prayer cloth
[1:11:30] and take it they said go put in your
[1:11:32] medicine cabinet he said he said do
[1:11:34] the doctor's program
[1:11:37] well if if
[1:11:39] push come to shove where i had to
[1:11:41] then you know what i'd take it
[1:11:44] because you know what there's no weapon
[1:11:46] formed against me that'll prosper
[1:11:51] but you know what if i don't take the
[1:11:53] shot it's still no weapon formed against
[1:11:55] me shall prosper
[1:11:57] the devil can't touch me unless god
[1:12:00] allows him to
[1:12:02] i'm not i'm not i'm not worried i've
[1:12:04] made it this far
[1:12:07] you know there's things when you look
[1:12:08] back at your life you shouldn't be here
[1:12:12] and you wonder why things have happened
[1:12:14] in your life and they worked out the way
[1:12:16] they did and many times we wonder
[1:12:17] you know it it looks like it looks like
[1:12:19] a mess and never did understand why
[1:12:20] things happen and when we look back then
[1:12:22] we begin to see you know what's been the
[1:12:24] hand of god that's brought us all the
[1:12:25] way through there
[1:12:27] when we didn't see the blessings of god
[1:12:29] when we were looking forward at things
[1:12:30] when we're going through things we don't
[1:12:31] see the blessings of god when we get to
[1:12:33] look back and see what god's done then
[1:12:35] we've seen that god's brought us through
[1:12:40] so if if something comes my way then you
[1:12:42] know what i'm st he's still the one
[1:12:43] that's in control
[1:12:46] you know none of us are promised to make
[1:12:47] it through the night
[1:12:53] but you know what
[1:12:56] i got confidence in god
[1:12:59] that if i left this world
[1:13:01] i got a place to go to
[1:13:06] amen
[1:13:07] i all i can all i can do is put trust in
[1:13:10] him
[1:13:14] he's brought me this far
[1:13:20] he's the one
[1:13:22] that called me and filled me with the
[1:13:24] holy ghost
[1:13:29] and you know what i have failed him
[1:13:37] and you know you look you see sometimes
[1:13:38] you look to be an unprofitable servant
[1:13:42] but you know what there's still grace
[1:13:44] there
[1:13:47] there's still grace
[1:13:50] no matter how far you go
[1:13:52] if you're a son or a daughter of god
[1:13:53] there's always grace god's always
[1:13:55] calling you back
[1:14:02] sometimes we wonder
[1:14:04] it's just so amazing to us
[1:14:06] what god has done for us
[1:14:08] amen but you know what i have trust in
[1:14:09] god i can't trust nothing else
[1:14:13] the world is falling apart there's
[1:14:14] nothing you can put trust in
[1:14:19] you know we're worried about silver or
[1:14:20] silver and gold and houses and lands and
[1:14:24] properties and and all these things
[1:14:26] it's all cannon fodder it's all going to
[1:14:28] be burnt up one day
[1:14:32] you know when god comes back you know
[1:14:33] he's not going to live in this filthy
[1:14:34] world
[1:14:37] he's not going to have any any part of
[1:14:39] this
[1:14:40] many times we get worried about
[1:14:42] frustrated about things that happen
[1:14:45] one of these days it's all going to be
[1:14:47] the former things are will be passed
[1:14:50] and it will never come into our
[1:14:51] remembrance
[1:14:54] so we just live day day by day
[1:14:57] and trust him
[1:14:59] amen god bless you now we're going to
[1:15:00] sing hold to god's unchanging hand

[1:21:45] not praying without ceasing now you got
[1:21:48] a problem
[1:21:49] we got calls coming in from everybody
[1:21:52] across the country and all the different
[1:21:53] places that are that are sick and needy
[1:21:56] and
[1:21:56] and man those people in tennessee that
[1:21:58] lost all their homes you know i don't
[1:22:00] know if there was any believers in that
[1:22:01] but that it doesn't matter they were
[1:22:03] human beings
[1:22:05] that a lot of them they still hadn't
[1:22:06] found them yet
[1:22:07] you could just see their houses floating
[1:22:09] down the river now think of a bad day
[1:22:11] you've had bad days but you never had a
[1:22:12] bad day when you watch your house
[1:22:14] watch your house come off of its
[1:22:16] foundation and go 10 miles down the
[1:22:17] river
[1:22:18] and your loved ones are in that house
[1:22:21] right

[1:22:23] prayers we we
[1:22:25] we sometimes we say well were they
[1:22:27] believers it really doesn't matter

[1:22:32] through something that hopefully
[1:22:34] by god's grace you won't have to go
[1:22:35] through
[1:22:36] but your prayer may help somebody get
