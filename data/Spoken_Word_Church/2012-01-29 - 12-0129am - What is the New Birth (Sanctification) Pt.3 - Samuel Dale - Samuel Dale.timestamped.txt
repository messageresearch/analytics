[7:28] name amen
[7:33] john 3
[7:38] there was a man of the pharisees named
[7:39] nicodemus a ruler of the jews
[7:41] the same came to jesus by night and said
[7:44] unto him rabbi we know that god are
[7:46] a teacher come from god for no man can
[7:50] do these miracles that thou doest except
[7:52] god be with him
[7:53] jesus answered and said unto him verily
[7:56] verily i say
[7:57] unto thee except a man be born again
[8:00] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[8:03] nicodemus says unto him
[8:05] how can a man be born when he is old can
[8:08] he enter the second time into his
[8:09] mother's womb
[8:10] and be born jesus answered verily verily
[8:14] i say unto thee except a man be born of
[8:17] water
[8:17] and of the spirit he cannot enter into
[8:20] the kingdom
[8:21] of god that which is born of the flesh
[8:23] is flesh and that which is born of the
[8:25] spirit is spirit
[8:27] marvel not that i say it unto thee you
[8:30] must be born again
[8:32] now our thought will be coming from this
[8:34] scripture in ii
[8:35] thessalonians 2 and verse 13
[8:39] but we are bound to give thanks always
[8:41] to god for you brethren
[8:43] be loved of the lord because god hath
[8:45] from the beginning chosen you
[8:47] to salvation through sanctification of
[8:49] the spirit
[8:50] and belief of the word you may be seated
[8:54] lord that is listening to the reading of
[8:57] the word
[8:58] now we know that jesus is
[9:01] we're trying to bring out speaking to
[9:03] nicodemus
[9:06] and you know telling them you you must
[9:08] be born again
[9:10] and uh you told him he must be born of
[9:12] water
[9:13] and a spirit in other words you must
[9:15] have uh your water baptism
[9:17] and then your holy ghost baptism water
[9:20] and spirit i i want to go over
[9:22] and just pick up a scripture that i'm
[9:24] looking at this morning let's see if i
[9:26] can find it
[9:27] and uh just let that be tied together
[9:31] it's first john
[9:34] 5.
[9:41] first john 5 verse 6
[9:44] this is he that came by water and blood
[9:47] even jesus christ
[9:49] not by water only but by water and blood
[9:52] and it is the spirit that beareth
[9:54] witness because the spirit
[9:56] is truth now just looking at that
[9:59] scripture this morning thinking about
[10:02] you know what it's actually saying
[10:05] because for us to have a new birth
[10:08] we realized that jesus christ had to die
[10:12] well then it was and i've got some
[10:14] quotes in there that i ran off after i
[10:16] looked at that a little
[10:17] brother brown said the thing that
[10:19] constituted
[10:20] the new birth you know
[10:24] going through justification
[10:25] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[10:27] ghost
[10:28] of water blood spirit you know
[10:31] and he said it came from the body
[10:34] of jesus christ to be able to give us a
[10:37] new birth
[10:38] to constitute the new birth all the
[10:40] elements came forth so that it would be
[10:43] water blood you know
[10:46] water and and and you know when
[10:49] there when they pierced its side out
[10:50] came the water and blood as it joined
[10:52] together
[10:53] and then the life was released and then
[10:55] it could come back
[10:56] upon the believer uh there in the book
[10:59] of acts
[11:00] so i was just looking at that point i
[11:02] thought that was very
[11:03] uh complementary of the prophet saying
[11:07] that the things that
[11:08] would constitute our new birth was the
[11:12] things that come from
[11:13] the lord jesus christ and that's we know
[11:16] that to be true but i'm just saying it
[11:18] was
[11:18] it just stuck out to me when i began to
[11:20] see those things this morning looking at
[11:22] it
[11:24] but now we're talking about what is the
[11:27] new birth
[11:29] now the lord willing this afternoon i
[11:31] hope we will not be lengthy i will try
[11:33] not to be
[11:34] because i have to i'll break it up but
[11:38] uh i want to get into something about
[11:40] the new birth
[11:41] that i believe is very confusing to
[11:45] people
[11:46] and we'll try our best to express it
[11:49] you know this afternoon so if we're a
[11:51] little lengthy i'll tell you now
[11:53] so you can lay out this afternoon and uh
[11:56] you know you won't have to fool with me
[11:58] but uh
[12:00] you know uh we just say well what is the
[12:03] new birth
[12:05] amen and see they've come in the message
[12:08] now to say that
[12:09] that it's not uh three stages of grace
[12:13] or anything that brought around
[12:14] change later and says now it's just the
[12:17] baptism
[12:19] well i read where brother branham and
[12:21] i've got them i'll try to bring it this
[12:22] afternoon where he said you say it's
[12:24] just
[12:25] the baptism now he's not talking about
[12:27] the anointing on your spirit now
[12:29] and we know that can happen you can have
[12:30] the anointing on your spirit to be lost
[12:33] but he said the pentecostal say it's
[12:34] just the baptism he said you're wrong
[12:38] you know so you know i hope that goes
[12:40] out and some people will listen to it
[12:41] but
[12:42] won't do any good other than to the
[12:43] predestinated seat
[12:45] and that's that's all we're talking to
[12:47] anyway but we're not going to argue with
[12:49] anybody about what they believe
[12:51] you believe what you want to as long as
[12:53] you don't try to make me believe
[12:54] that's the difference you know all right
[12:56] but see we've been talking about
[12:59] and we spent a couple of messages
[13:01] speaking on
[13:02] uh justification and how that
[13:06] you know justification is a chopping off
[13:09] of your past sins and i've asked you
[13:11] to please uh read or listen to the tape
[13:15] the future home
[13:17] i hope you have and will because it
[13:20] would help you
[13:21] you know especially about 15 16
[13:24] 17 of the the book and we've given you
[13:28] most of that through the quotes
[13:30] but now we want to to just talk a little
[13:35] while and
[13:36] and try to get something about
[13:37] sanctification as we did on
[13:40] justification because trying to show you
[13:42] that it's
[13:43] a work of the holy spirit but it's not
[13:47] it's not a work it's not three words
[13:51] of grace it's a working of the holy
[13:55] spirit
[13:55] but it's the same holy spirit it's not
[13:58] three works of grace we gave that
[14:00] to you and you know and i'll just quote
[14:02] these words to be on the tape
[14:04] that brother around says on he swore by
[14:06] himself paragraph 140
[14:08] um 54 12 12 it's not three works of
[14:12] grace
[14:13] then he goes on to questions and answers
[14:15] and law having a shadow 54
[14:18] 516 e14 said it's not three words
[14:22] but it's three manifestations right
[14:26] just like it is with three
[14:29] manifestations of god
[14:31] and he said i taught those three stages
[14:34] on christ on the future home he said i
[14:37] taught it from the beginning and have it
[14:41] changed my doctrine so now when we get
[14:43] down this afternoon
[14:44] you're going to think he changed
[14:48] see because i'll tell you that up front
[14:50] because it's it's a confusing point
[14:53] of a lot of the statements brother
[14:54] branham makes it's confusing
[14:57] if you don't lay it in perfect order and
[15:00] get it right
[15:01] you know it is confusing because it does
[15:04] look like
[15:04] that he taught it one way and he taught
[15:06] it another way and backwards and fourth
[15:09] but i've always been one that is kind
[15:12] of uh i guess when you see a
[15:15] controversial point
[15:17] that it stirs my curiosity
[15:21] all right and i don't mean because i'm
[15:22] not gonna argue with you about nothing
[15:24] that way i'm not gonna you know
[15:26] i don't mean that the wrong way i just
[15:28] mean when
[15:29] when things like daniel 70 weeks where
[15:31] brother brown said
[15:32] if you don't understand daniel 70 which
[15:34] you can't understand the seals
[15:36] i didn't say that he did well then uh
[15:39] you know i began to study in that realm
[15:42] to see what he was really talking about
[15:44] to try to bring it to understanding and
[15:47] things
[15:48] and uh you know he's standing he'd say
[15:51] uh let's stand now we're blessed we'll
[15:53] uh approach or
[15:55] pray to the to the third person of the
[15:57] trinity
[15:59] when you know he never taught a
[16:01] trinitarian doctrine
[16:03] see in those things when they come up
[16:05] see it it makes people
[16:07] think that there's so many
[16:08] contradictions and things throughout the
[16:11] message and they think the same thing of
[16:13] the bible
[16:14] because they don't wait long enough for
[16:16] it to be able to
[16:18] come together and be a revelation amen
[16:20] and i don't claim to understand
[16:22] everything but i'm just saying that does
[16:24] uh bring me to a point that i think well
[16:26] now the people needs to understand
[16:29] and we were listening last night to a
[16:30] tape uh i would ask you to listen to one
[16:33] where
[16:33] let's see i'll try to believe it's 59
[16:36] but
[16:36] uh it's discernment of spirits and in
[16:40] that message brother branham
[16:41] is very very um
[16:44] adamant about explaining that it's not
[16:48] what a person
[16:49] believes he said i can
[16:52] put up with anything you know he said
[16:55] but it's according to what
[16:57] they live you know paraphrasing bringing
[17:01] down a whole message
[17:02] it's what they live he said you can have
[17:05] all the word and still miss it
[17:07] please but you can't have all the
[17:09] revealed word that makes it
[17:11] so now that puts it in a different
[17:12] category right so that not that's just
[17:15] what we'll try to do this afternoon so
[17:17] bear with me if i'm a little lengthy on
[17:19] it okay
[17:20] but now we we talked about
[17:24] justification just trying to back the
[17:26] front of her
[17:27] that we know and realize that no one can
[17:32] come to god according to john 6 44.
[17:36] see jesus said no man can come accept
[17:39] the father
[17:41] drawing all right then you'd say you
[17:44] know and i tried to emphasize and get
[17:46] the point across that you say well how
[17:48] do we know that god is drawing us
[17:50] well why are you concerned right that's
[17:53] right
[17:54] right something must be drawing us amen
[17:57] or we would not be concerned
[17:58] the devil is certainly not going to try
[18:01] to draw us
[18:02] sure he draws to his way but a point but
[18:06] see
[18:07] uh you know so then the bible does say
[18:10] we love it towards matthew 5 and 6.
[18:12] we're blessed
[18:13] are they that hunger and thirst after
[18:14] righteousness one for they shall be
[18:16] filled
[18:17] the prophet said it's just it's a
[18:19] blessing to just be a have a hunger
[18:22] well can't you see then that what i was
[18:24] trying to explain that even
[18:25] a person who'd never heard of god but in
[18:28] the form of we talk about
[18:30] the lord jesus christ or our one god
[18:33] that he's he's worshipping a totem pole
[18:35] or something but he still
[18:38] he has that soul within him that longs
[18:41] out for
[18:43] to know about his creator well you know
[18:46] he's being drawn
[18:49] right because he goes to that form so
[18:52] then it's wonderful to think about how
[18:54] that god would call us
[18:56] and i wrote it like this why would we be
[18:59] concerned
[19:00] if god wasn't calling us i mean what
[19:04] would you be concerned about
[19:05] while you're in church what are you
[19:06] doing what's the point
[19:09] if you don't know whether god is calling
[19:10] you or not so then don't worry about
[19:12] whether he's calling you
[19:15] just make sure you follow the rest of
[19:17] the scripture to make your
[19:19] calling and election sure
[19:22] you just go on with the rest of the word
[19:26] we certainly didn't put the thirst our
[19:28] desire
[19:29] for god into our own sails because we
[19:32] have a thirst and a desire for the world
[19:35] all right for satan and his doing all
[19:38] right
[19:38] but now let's go on as we start into
[19:41] this second work and as i said i just
[19:42] quoted these
[19:44] that we we don't believe in three works
[19:47] of grace the prophet would say works
[19:49] that's fine as long as you understand
[19:51] what you're saying
[19:52] but it's not three works of grace it's
[19:55] three stages
[19:56] of the same god because it's not three
[20:00] gods it's justification
[20:02] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[20:04] ghost it's
[20:05] father son holy ghost all comes together
[20:09] to make one
[20:10] all right so then as we'll get to it
[20:12] this evening that will help you very
[20:14] a lot to remember that
[20:18] each one is a work of the holy spirit
[20:21] but it's the same holy spirit
[20:24] the prophet said the same holy spirit
[20:26] that justified the lutheran
[20:27] sanctified the messages baptized the
[20:30] pentecostal right
[20:31] all right same holy spirit it's just god
[20:34] in his ways
[20:35] of working his form of salvation
[20:38] to to bring it to that right all right
[20:41] so keep that in your mind now as we we
[20:44] start into the message
[20:46] because we certainly don't want to have
[20:48] one god of a justification
[20:50] and another one to sanctify us and then
[20:52] another one to fill us
[20:53] you know or something like that or
[20:55] trinitarian concept we want to
[20:57] hold together with the one true and the
[20:59] living god
[21:00] all right now so it's the holy spirit
[21:04] in us bringing forth
[21:09] the salvation that he wants us to have
[21:12] but we've got
[21:13] to accept that now that was the point i
[21:15] tried to to get across where
[21:17] you know people say oh it's not whether
[21:19] i accept him it's whether he accepts me
[21:21] well that's good we'll get to that this
[21:23] afternoon
[21:25] because when you get the baptism of the
[21:27] holy ghost it's truly when god accepts
[21:29] you
[21:30] all right so that will go in with that
[21:32] part but see then it's not to just say
[21:35] that we don't
[21:35] accept him because if you don't accept
[21:37] him he can't accept you
[21:42] you must believe in your heart confess
[21:44] with your mouth
[21:45] it's not that you get saved and then you
[21:47] believe in your heart you confess with
[21:48] your mouth
[21:50] you got to do that to be saved see we do
[21:52] have something to do with that part
[21:54] but the salvation is of god because he's
[21:58] doing the work
[21:59] and his goodness is what leads us to
[22:01] repentance
[22:04] and truly more to see that the
[22:05] sanctification then would be
[22:08] you know something working within us
[22:12] to try to bring us to a place that god
[22:15] could be pleased to dwell
[22:17] all right now we know that the disciples
[22:21] were justified
[22:23] and i know what the prophet would say
[22:25] even of the word that he says their
[22:27] potential
[22:28] but just remember it is justified they
[22:30] were justified by believing the reason
[22:33] he's calling
[22:34] justification and sanctification to the
[22:36] disciples now
[22:38] you know the disciples with him it's
[22:40] because the holy ghost had not been
[22:42] given
[22:42] right and the holy ghost could not be
[22:45] inside of them
[22:47] right working it it wasn't working upon
[22:51] them but not inside of them in their
[22:54] soul
[22:55] to you know the new birth wasn't in
[22:57] there jesus christ hadn't died
[22:59] all right so then we look at it that we
[23:02] they were believing unto right
[23:06] they were justified potentially
[23:07] sanctified potentially
[23:09] because they were believing on two all
[23:12] right
[23:13] and believing on two they were in good
[23:15] shape
[23:17] but just remember in that stage we can
[23:20] lose it too if we're just believing unto
[23:23] it
[23:23] if we haven't come to the place to be
[23:25] sealed in by the holy spirit
[23:27] we can lose that part what we call
[23:29] salvation
[23:30] we went through that but the disciples
[23:33] were
[23:34] justified by believing on the lord jesus
[23:36] christ
[23:37] believing that he was the one who had
[23:40] come to die
[23:41] in their place you know they maybe not
[23:44] understood what he was saying but
[23:46] yet they did believe him all right there
[23:49] was a lot of people believed in if
[23:50] you'll read matthew mark luke and john
[23:52] you'll find a lot of people believed
[23:54] right but yet they didn't go on
[23:56] that's right but the disciples went on
[23:59] with him because
[24:01] peter you know he said where can we go
[24:03] that's it man
[24:04] that's right he confessed him as being
[24:06] the christ the son of the living god
[24:08] all right and see that's what we do of
[24:10] our justification
[24:12] we repent of our sins we accept jesus
[24:14] christ as our savior
[24:16] we go forth confessing the work behavior
[24:18] done within us
[24:20] to save us you know confessing him to be
[24:23] the savior
[24:25] declaring him to be the christ the son
[24:27] of the living god
[24:28] all right and in doing that then we
[24:31] realize
[24:32] what has taken place
[24:35] remember peter
[24:39] it was told to him when he said our the
[24:41] christ
[24:44] in other words his confession it was
[24:47] told peter there in matthew
[24:49] uh 16 18 verse upon this rock i'll build
[24:53] my church
[24:56] upon the revelation of jesus christ
[24:59] all right so then remember when we
[25:01] started in justification
[25:03] that we were talking about he that
[25:04] cometh to god the scripture says
[25:08] must believe that god is
[25:11] not was history can prove he was
[25:15] i don't save you to say he was it's when
[25:18] you can say he
[25:19] is amen and when he comes to us to
[25:22] repent of our sins
[25:23] and condemns us that is a present tense
[25:27] condemning us that's right it's not that
[25:29] we do and that's why the prophet said
[25:31] i'm against alder calls
[25:32] in the basis of trying to force people
[25:34] to an altar or tell them
[25:36] your mother was a good christian you
[25:38] know if you you want to go to heaven
[25:40] with your daddy or you find me
[25:42] you need to be saved he said don't do
[25:45] that
[25:46] why because it's not a work of the holy
[25:48] spirit among
[25:50] the work of the holy spirit at
[25:51] repentance is a present tense god
[25:54] i hope you was catching that one i tried
[25:56] to bring it out you know
[25:58] of that god is even that justification
[26:02] even to get you to repent of your sins
[26:04] it brings a present tense god right
[26:07] into our presence so i i hope you would
[26:10] catch on to that and hang on
[26:13] all right we know then the disciples
[26:15] went on further than just believing
[26:18] because john 17 jesus said sanctify them
[26:22] through thy truth
[26:25] thy word is truth in other words
[26:27] sanctify them cleanse them
[26:31] and how are they sanctified now remember
[26:34] it wasn't in john 1.
[26:37] that's when there's believing that's
[26:40] when there's repentance
[26:41] you know you understand the reason i'm
[26:42] saying john 1 ain't talking about the
[26:45] i'm talking about it's not in the first
[26:47] chapter of john it's in the 17th chapter
[26:50] that went on for a while before they
[26:52] came to a place that he would speak of
[26:54] sanctification
[26:58] because he knew what was in their lives
[27:00] all right so then when jesus spoke of it
[27:03] he was speaking of their journey in
[27:05] their salvation
[27:07] he said sanctify them through thy truth
[27:11] see they had heard the word from the
[27:13] lord jesus
[27:17] all right you say well well bro dale on
[27:19] sanctification and just
[27:21] you know i just quit smoking i quit
[27:24] dipping snuff
[27:25] i quit chewing i quit doing this that or
[27:27] the other
[27:28] that's not sanctification
[27:34] see that's what i'm saying that people
[27:35] don't understand it people call that
[27:37] sanctification
[27:39] whereas you quitting something being
[27:40] sanctification
[27:42] that'll be your righteousness
[27:46] if sanctification is a work of the holy
[27:49] spirit
[27:52] and that's what your prophet said it was
[27:55] so then it would be that i quit
[27:59] it would be that something happened to
[28:01] me
[28:03] to make me quit that's right not be
[28:06] quitting
[28:06] yes that's why the prophet will go on to
[28:08] say you know that even drinking gambling
[28:10] smoke not said that's not sin
[28:14] then we get all confused with those
[28:16] statements
[28:17] but sanctification is not just because
[28:20] you quit something
[28:21] it's when the unclean spirit goes out
[28:24] that's right
[28:25] all right see that would be dealing then
[28:29] with
[28:30] something on the interior now watch what
[28:33] i'm saying listen
[28:35] justification is just a repentance from
[28:38] an honest heart
[28:40] the prophet said does nothing to the
[28:42] future
[28:44] in the future home we read the other day
[28:46] but sanctification
[28:49] is not just driving out the unclean
[28:52] spirit out of your spirit
[28:57] now listen the unclean spirit is coming
[29:02] out of the soul
[29:03] amen we certainly need it out of our
[29:05] spirit
[29:08] but all that happened to the soul of the
[29:10] individual justification
[29:12] was just chopping off the things they
[29:14] had done
[29:16] erasing them all right
[29:19] but sanctification starts dealing with a
[29:22] point
[29:22] and i'll repeat these as we go along but
[29:26] it's like brother around says the future
[29:27] home he said
[29:29] jesus you know dropped his blood upon
[29:32] this earth
[29:34] to cleanse and claim it
[29:37] and remember your body was right in
[29:39] there that's right so your body's
[29:41] already cleaned
[29:42] it was in the earth he'd done that all
[29:45] right but see claiming it not to just
[29:48] wash it
[29:51] did reclaim it he claimed his earth by
[29:55] dropping his blood on him
[29:57] all right our bodies as i said was in
[29:59] there but what he was claiming was the
[30:01] soul of man
[30:06] in doing that the disciples had come
[30:08] through
[30:09] justification by believing on the lord
[30:12] jesus christ
[30:13] and they had become sanctified according
[30:17] to saint john 17
[30:19] by the hearing of the word or the
[30:21] washing
[30:22] of the word they heard the word
[30:25] they come to a place like i said peter
[30:27] said where can we go
[30:31] you know we can't go back to fishing
[30:34] we could do that they tried it but it
[30:36] didn't work after
[30:38] the death of jesus christ but he said
[30:40] where can we go
[30:42] in other words what church can we go to
[30:46] where can we find a place that'll help
[30:49] us
[30:50] so we can't do it no we just stay with
[30:52] you we don't understand but we just stay
[30:54] with you
[30:55] all right see what was happening the
[30:57] word
[30:58] get it and we'll get more into
[31:00] sanctification
[31:02] the word that is planted into your soul
[31:05] the prophet of god we gave one daughter
[31:07] the other day where said he said you're
[31:09] begotten
[31:12] like a baby in the wound of a mother
[31:16] begotten see that's what happens at
[31:20] sanctification
[31:23] that unclean spirit as jesus said goes
[31:27] out
[31:30] it's driven out by the planting of the
[31:31] word
[31:33] all right now see if we take these and
[31:36] if we went on to
[31:37] greater depth then you know where we
[31:39] would be going
[31:42] is that brother brown said that there
[31:44] was a mysterious part about
[31:45] justification sanctification of baptism
[31:47] with the holy ghost under the seals
[31:49] so we'd be going on dealing with you and
[31:51] i right now
[31:53] what do you mean brother i strike about
[31:55] a long time ago but
[31:56] that unclean spirit keeps trying to come
[31:58] back
[32:03] i said a born-again believer it keeps
[32:06] trying to come back on you and i
[32:08] just keep trying to take us back into
[32:10] the things that we've done
[32:13] so we have to keep on dying daily as
[32:16] paul said
[32:18] to ourselves just because we're born
[32:20] again don't give you
[32:22] a right to just sit down and say well no
[32:23] matter what i do
[32:26] no you're more concerned about what you
[32:29] do
[32:29] after you're born again than you are
[32:31] before you're born again
[32:33] amen all right but see sanctification
[32:38] it's like the prophet said you pick up a
[32:41] glass
[32:42] out of the yard you see that's
[32:45] justification you've got a reason for it
[32:48] he said you don't take in the house put
[32:49] water in it he said you sanctified
[32:52] you scald it you cleanse it
[32:55] we said that's still not in service now
[32:58] he said it's just washed the vessel
[33:01] to get it clean all right so now when we
[33:04] repented of our sins
[33:06] that's what most people think though
[33:08] they come to an altar and they repent of
[33:10] their sins
[33:12] and they feel good because they're
[33:13] repentant
[33:16] well they think it's all finished that's
[33:17] good baptism man i got it when i believe
[33:21] you know well where in the message do
[33:23] you hear people preach
[33:24] that you must be justified sanctified to
[33:27] be able to be filled with the baptism in
[33:29] the holy ghost
[33:31] they've got forgotten all about that
[33:33] they're so great so mysterious mysteries
[33:36] are the great things
[33:38] and how can you preach the mysteries if
[33:40] you don't understand the simplicity
[33:43] right you know i'm not i'm just honest i
[33:47] try to say things to get you to think
[33:52] about your salvation
[33:55] see what happened to you then you might
[33:58] find out
[33:59] what happened to you wouldn't enough
[34:02] right
[34:03] that's right because that justification
[34:05] you get rid of a load of sin
[34:07] makes you feel good you go to church
[34:12] you get baptized you start reading your
[34:16] bible
[34:16] but what's happening that word then
[34:19] starts driving out that unclean spirit
[34:22] oh i just want you pray for me brother
[34:25] dale and this this
[34:26] i know this they don't go across good to
[34:28] the people of the message that go ahead
[34:30] you out there on the internet you just
[34:32] remember oh brother dale's crazy but
[34:35] i always have believed when i heard the
[34:39] prophet
[34:42] and i told you about it that i never did
[34:44] say i was had the baptism in the holy
[34:45] ghost because i came in the message
[34:48] you know i was addicted at 23 years old
[34:50] in the church
[34:52] honored by the people because of my
[34:54] ability to teach and do things
[34:57] but yet when i saw what he was talking
[34:59] about the baptism in the holy ghost i
[35:01] knew i didn't have it
[35:04] i believe i was living a sanctified
[35:06] clean life but i didn't have the baptism
[35:08] with holy ghost
[35:09] well see i won't know what the baptism
[35:11] of the holy ghost was there
[35:14] so i started reading all i could read
[35:16] that the prophet was telling it
[35:18] you know then i found out what he was
[35:20] talking about justification
[35:22] and i thought well that's good now let
[35:24] me walk back
[35:27] even though i've been walking maybe that
[35:29] line or repentance of my sins
[35:31] but i hadn't been baptized correctly so
[35:33] that was one point but
[35:35] god went through their ignorance someone
[35:36] was baptized wrong but then when we
[35:38] heard the truth we got baptized and
[35:40] named the lord jesus christ
[35:42] all right see and then when we did
[35:46] we started repenting not just that time
[35:51] you know you know not just repent of
[35:54] your sins and he don't repent no more
[35:57] i mean i hope that didn't happen to
[35:58] anybody
[36:00] i mean it should be a daily repentance
[36:04] but we don't have to repent for what
[36:05] we've done two times
[36:08] you know what i'm saying repenting for
[36:10] what we was and was born that away have
[36:12] done
[36:13] fine that's why the prophet said you
[36:16] don't repent for what adam done
[36:18] well see adam what adam them done made
[36:20] us the way we are
[36:22] it looks like he's telling us something
[36:24] wrong doesn't it
[36:26] but he said you don't have to repent for
[36:28] what adam done he says what you've done
[36:30] right well then you find out as i was
[36:32] trying to bring that it wasn't a spirit
[36:34] that killed jesus is my sins
[36:39] he hung on the cross for me well then
[36:41] why wouldn't we want to keep repenting
[36:44] and saying lord forgive me help me and
[36:47] lead me
[36:48] all right and it wouldn't matter how
[36:50] close you got to god you'd still be
[36:52] doing that right
[36:54] brother prairie greens at that time
[36:55] right around and told him said brother
[36:56] prairie
[36:57] he said when you feel god close to you
[36:59] he said just tell him that brother brown
[37:01] loves you
[37:03] he meant it he loved it and he wanted
[37:05] him he wanted everybody to tell him you
[37:07] know
[37:08] all right will you follow me
[37:10] justification
[37:12] is god working on me and you and then we
[37:16] keep repenting
[37:17] all right then we start hearing the word
[37:20] but but now brother dale what i don't
[37:23] understand about you
[37:24] is that you seem to put the new birth
[37:27] over a period of time
[37:32] well now i thought that it took three
[37:34] and a half years to get the disciples
[37:37] to the places they could receive the
[37:38] holy ghost right that's great
[37:40] all right you know that's what i thought
[37:43] now
[37:44] i'm mistaken there you tell me about it
[37:47] right
[37:47] but now
[37:50] then i i've tried to explain if brother
[37:53] gary was here he's listening he'll say
[37:55] amen because
[37:57] you know we used to talk about it he
[37:59] wanted the baptism in the holy ghost and
[38:00] i said
[38:01] brother gary you're going at it wrong i
[38:03] said just forget about
[38:04] trying to receive something just forget
[38:06] about now didn't mean
[38:08] what to do i said just go on with the
[38:10] lord
[38:11] and just keep praying and seeking god
[38:14] and reading the word and studying and i
[38:16] said one day he'll cross your path
[38:18] right yeah
[38:22] and one day he called me from going well
[38:24] used to call it the
[38:25] the greatest battle ever fault because
[38:27] it was out of the ride to alabama where
[38:29] he was
[38:29] going over there hauling uh films
[38:33] backers and fourth you know
[38:34] and we call it the battle of i-20 and so
[38:37] one day he called me from the rest area
[38:39] and he said brother dale's over
[38:43] that's okay i told you but you see
[38:46] everybody wants to come up
[38:47] one time and thank god i believe god can
[38:50] do it
[38:53] i believe he can give you the baptism of
[38:55] the holy ghost
[38:56] i can prove that by the bible because
[38:58] the three thousand
[39:01] only heard one sermon and received the
[39:03] baptism in the holy ghost
[39:06] so they had to go through justification
[39:08] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[39:10] ghost
[39:10] in that sermon they heard but still
[39:13] remember it could not come until they
[39:15] heard the word
[39:16] that's right all right
[39:20] well then it may happen to you that way
[39:22] you may have come to the altar went
[39:24] through all three
[39:25] right there at the altar and receive the
[39:27] baptism of the holy ghost
[39:29] i'm not going to say you didn't i'm
[39:30] going to say amen
[39:33] because he will prove whether we got the
[39:35] holy ghost tonight about what we do and
[39:37] how we follow the word so you know
[39:39] that's no problem but i'm going to tell
[39:42] you on the average percentage
[39:45] there's going to be a whole lot more
[39:48] because of one reason
[39:50] and i'm sorry to have to say it this way
[39:52] but that's
[39:53] the best way to say it because most of
[39:56] the churches don't preach you need to be
[39:58] justified
[39:59] you need to be sanctified and you need
[40:01] the baptism of the holy ghost
[40:05] they don't preach it that way they just
[40:06] preach you believe the prophet
[40:11] and by not doing that the people don't
[40:13] go through the stages
[40:16] they don't go through those stages of
[40:18] seeking after god
[40:20] why not
[40:24] not seek after gone every day i thought
[40:26] i i i don't understand that
[40:29] but you see if you don't know what
[40:31] happened so just go through the stages
[40:32] with me
[40:33] as we're talking on the people on the
[40:35] internet or you here or whatever
[40:38] if you think you're not born again just
[40:40] listen to see where you can find where
[40:41] you're at
[40:43] then when you find where you're at you
[40:45] can do something about it that's right
[40:46] right
[40:47] cause we'll try to instruct on further
[40:50] as we go
[40:51] and talk about it see all right so we
[40:54] repent of our sins
[40:56] we get forgiven we go to church
[41:00] we get baptized looks like a good
[41:02] christian though
[41:04] and that's wonderful and we're going to
[41:06] get this afternoon where the prophet
[41:08] made the statement
[41:09] he said sure he said
[41:12] you're believing and he even says you
[41:15] have eternal life
[41:20] he said you just repented
[41:25] your new birth has just begun
[41:28] that's what he says he says if you die
[41:31] right now
[41:32] sure you're going to heaven i explained
[41:34] that the other night
[41:37] i believe that but i believe you're
[41:40] going to have to go there
[41:41] as a foolish virgin or something we'll
[41:43] get to those points as we go along
[41:46] but still forget there you get time
[41:49] all right but see sanctification then is
[41:53] is to cleanse and set aside
[42:00] and it's washing out but it's not just
[42:03] washing out
[42:07] are you listening that's why it's not
[42:09] just quitting things
[42:10] that's right it's cleansed
[42:13] and you know sanctified
[42:19] washed and cleansed
[42:23] something happened it's a compound word
[42:27] cleansed and set aside
[42:31] see it's a whole lot deeper than just
[42:33] repentance of your sins
[42:36] well that deeper point than just going
[42:38] to church
[42:39] and being baptized is to go on
[42:42] in a life to work that you can say
[42:46] god is dealing with me
[42:49] to bring me to that place we see
[42:52] sanctification
[42:54] is us hearing and acting upon the word
[42:58] right that's what the disciples done
[43:02] they heard the word for three and a half
[43:04] years
[43:08] they listened daily
[43:12] all right then jesus in matthew 12 43
[43:17] he said the unclean spirit is gone out
[43:21] of a man
[43:23] that he walketh in dry places seek us
[43:26] rest
[43:26] find us none say you'll come back to the
[43:28] house if it's not filled
[43:30] paraphrasing amen he said it'll come
[43:32] back in right
[43:34] all right now the prophet said that's
[43:35] the most dangerous stage
[43:38] right sanctification is a dangerous
[43:41] point
[43:43] more dangerous of a stage than
[43:45] justification
[43:47] because you you just repented at
[43:49] justification you start trying to do
[43:51] good
[43:52] but at sanctification you get more
[43:54] concern
[43:57] about your life and your doings
[44:01] and then you quit cutting your hair you
[44:03] you you you quit painting your face you
[44:05] know you
[44:06] you and they cut their hair off and and
[44:09] and they start acting right doing right
[44:11] you know
[44:12] all right see then that's the dangerous
[44:15] stage because
[44:16] there's where that unclean spirit will
[44:18] come back now if you need these i'll be
[44:21] glad to give you anybody on the internet
[44:22] you should know if you know the message
[44:25] the prophet said a lot of times that
[44:27] devil comes back
[44:30] he said he don't make you go back to the
[44:32] bars
[44:34] see something doesn't happen to you you
[44:36] don't make you go back to smoking and
[44:38] drinking
[44:40] something's happened
[44:43] he said but he'll put you in church
[44:50] that's why he said if you need these
[44:52] i'll be glad to find him
[44:54] because i've been preaching this for 40
[44:55] something years
[44:58] and he said he'll put you in a church
[45:02] and you'll start doing things in the
[45:04] church
[45:06] even become a deacon i did
[45:11] see start living a good clean life
[45:17] being conscious of the wrong in the
[45:19] things that's right
[45:24] and he said it's because of that unclean
[45:25] spirits come back
[45:28] because see we think of the devil we
[45:30] always think of the devil as a
[45:31] two-horned guy in the
[45:32] pitchfork and the the dirty bars and the
[45:35] the messed up places literally said he
[45:37] ain't there
[45:38] you know where he's at this morning i'm
[45:42] glad there ain't nobody on front view we
[45:43] were
[45:44] wrong about
[45:58] and i admit he's a little closer than
[46:00] that amen
[46:04] he's up you're telling me right now that
[46:06] you don't want to hear this
[46:08] and that you've heard it so many times
[46:10] the weird that's just old hashed over
[46:12] stuff
[46:13] well he's a whole lot closer than that
[46:14] front view then
[46:17] because he's still talking to us he said
[46:20] well you're not there will he talk to
[46:22] the lord jesus
[46:23] all right talking to us ain't no problem
[46:27] it's just yielding to it
[46:29] you know a lot of times i admit i yield
[46:31] to it and it was like brother donny said
[46:32] we went outside like
[46:34] our wednesday night and i i kind of you
[46:36] know i didn't go too long
[46:37] we went outside and about nine o'clock
[46:40] we got through the whole song service or
[46:41] something
[46:42] he said you could preach 45 more minutes
[46:43] because people stayed 45 more minutes
[46:45] that's right
[46:46] well you know then i've condemned for
[46:48] going too long and i'm condemned because
[46:50] i've been
[46:50] long enough you ain't gonna win over him
[46:54] so don't worry about it just
[46:56] just forget it with that old root of
[46:59] evil
[47:02] now like i said if it goes out
[47:08] and it'll come back
[47:11] it can be a religious demon
[47:16] okay a religious demon
[47:20] wants to go to church wants to study the
[47:23] message
[47:24] wants to know all the prophets said
[47:28] real quick to condemn you about
[47:31] something about the prophet what he's
[47:33] saying
[47:35] become legalistic that reminds you of a
[47:38] lot of preachers
[47:40] that all they preach is hiring clothes
[47:42] and shoes and
[47:44] doing some you know
[47:48] and i agree with every bit of that i
[47:51] agree that it's right
[47:52] that's right because i've said to you
[47:55] over and over
[47:58] if we live like the devil we've got the
[48:00] devil living in us
[48:02] so that solves the problem that's reason
[48:04] you don't hear brother dale preaching
[48:06] every week about hiring dress and
[48:07] clothes
[48:10] because you didn't hear jesus preaching
[48:12] about it
[48:14] and you're going to bible show me
[48:18] he was against every bit of it but that
[48:21] wasn't the way he preached it
[48:23] when your prophet came it sounds like
[48:25] he's so hard and hammering
[48:26] would you listen to him he says you can
[48:29] do every bit of that still die and go to
[48:31] hell
[48:33] he knew what it was to be sanctified
[48:37] he knew what it was to have the unclean
[48:38] spirit driven out of it
[48:40] how many people understand how many
[48:42] people have been sanctified
[48:45] and had it driven out
[48:48] but be careful because it can come back
[48:51] and when it comes back it comes back
[48:52] religious
[48:53] and that's the danger you say oh no
[48:57] i know whether it's god or the devil now
[48:59] you you're sure right in the middle of
[49:00] the devil's trap
[49:03] he said the devil when he talked to me
[49:05] he said he talked meaning rough
[49:08] he said when god talks to me sweet noble
[49:10] now you got it right in reverse that's
[49:12] right
[49:13] i'm going to tell you you got it in
[49:14] reverse right because god generally
[49:17] speaks heart and stern
[49:19] get behind me satan was that what he
[49:22] said to peter
[49:23] he didn't say peter now you love him
[49:25] sleep with the little guy would you mind
[49:26] walking back over and get him over
[49:28] out of the way no he said get behind me
[49:31] and the devil he's real sweet
[49:36] that's enough to let you know who's
[49:38] talking to you that's right
[49:40] it's not always you know
[49:44] the bad things and the good things so
[49:46] just take it for the word
[49:48] that's why i love to talk about
[49:49] sanctification
[49:52] because that's what i'm trying to do in
[49:54] you and i
[49:56] in the higher stages is to to those that
[49:59] are born again
[50:00] is to preach sanctification like brother
[50:04] brown did under the sixth seal
[50:06] that there'd be such a cleansing that
[50:07] god can come on the scene
[50:10] all right soul cleansed and set aside
[50:13] until god can come on the scene
[50:16] in our hearts and our lives all right
[50:18] but now you listen
[50:22] everything we get go ahead brother
[50:26] anderson pull up number one but we'll
[50:28] start remember how we brought it to
[50:31] justification
[50:34] that all you get from god must come by
[50:36] faith
[50:38] a revelation
[50:42] need to be revealed to you something
[50:46] from god that's why it is god in us
[50:49] doing it
[50:50] so look what the prophet of god says
[50:51] about this root of evil
[50:55] now he's tying and i hope you'll listen
[50:58] in a minute when we get one especially
[50:59] if i can remember
[51:01] he'll tie the ages and the church
[51:03] together because he always does
[51:05] because that's why it was so amazing to
[51:07] me when i first heard brother branham
[51:09] preaching
[51:10] and i heard him because i knew a little
[51:13] bit about the doctrines
[51:14] not much but i knew at least about what
[51:16] the lutheran believed a little
[51:18] what the methodists believe the
[51:19] presbyterian the bad discs the things
[51:22] and even a little about the pentecostals
[51:25] and things you know
[51:28] and as i began to listen to him he would
[51:30] talk and he would talk about
[51:32] luther anytime he would speak about
[51:36] justification he speaks of luther
[51:41] well you know what i knew that that was
[51:43] at least a move of god
[51:46] but it proved out to be true and i
[51:48] believe the just shall live by faith
[51:50] don't you
[51:52] see so then justification would be laid
[51:55] up on faith so listen what he's saying
[51:57] then after martin luther preaching
[51:59] justification john wesley come along
[52:01] preaching saints again
[52:02] he preached that a man after being
[52:04] justified
[52:08] now that's where most people take the
[52:09] ages and they just bring it down to lump
[52:11] things in
[52:14] the first work that we would the first
[52:16] stage was justification
[52:18] under martin luther now wesley believed
[52:23] what martin luther preached
[52:26] wesley was preaching justification
[52:33] come on go study history wesley was
[52:37] preaching justification
[52:38] he came to america
[52:42] to convert the heathen
[52:45] he ran into the more ravens or how you
[52:47] pronounce the name
[52:49] and they were actually the ones that
[52:51] taught him or showed him the message of
[52:53] sanctification and then when god began
[52:57] to deal with him
[52:58] he went back home and he said lord i
[53:02] went there
[53:02] to convert the heathen and found out i
[53:05] needed to be converted
[53:07] it wasn't that he needed to be justified
[53:11] he needed to step into the next stage
[53:14] of god's word which was sanctification
[53:18] all right see you've got to believe in
[53:21] justification
[53:23] wesley believed in that and god gave him
[53:26] sanctification the pentecost i'm talking
[53:29] about the truth now i'm not talking
[53:30] about the junks
[53:31] all right i'm going to talk about
[53:33] everybody claims i'll show you i've got
[53:35] a quote but brother
[53:36] said a lot of people believe justified
[53:38] he said
[53:39] they didn't get it a lot of people
[53:41] believed sanctification they didn't get
[53:43] it he said a lot of people believed the
[53:44] baptism in the holy ghost
[53:46] and they didn't get it but see john
[53:50] wesley
[53:51] accepted what luther had taught
[53:54] and then god added more to it
[53:57] of the the stage of sanctification so
[54:00] look at it
[54:01] john wesley come on preaching
[54:03] sanctification and he preached that a
[54:04] man
[54:05] after being justified it's all right but
[54:08] you've got to be sanctified
[54:10] cleansed the root of evil taken out of
[54:12] you by the blood of jesus
[54:15] now you can't expect the lutherans to
[54:16] preach sanctification
[54:18] because they're not going to do it right
[54:21] he goes on down and showing that the
[54:23] others won't do it this won't do it
[54:25] but listen wesley
[54:30] he may have not preached it from matthew
[54:33] on called it the unclean spirit going
[54:35] out of the land
[54:38] but when brother brown describes his
[54:40] message
[54:42] he describes his message as the unclean
[54:44] spirit or the enemy
[54:46] going out because that's what
[54:48] sanctification is
[54:51] is god working and working us to drive
[54:54] out that
[54:55] unclean spirit
[54:58] all right so then watch what it's
[55:00] talking about and i said that's what so
[55:02] thrilled me
[55:03] because i knew a little about the
[55:04] doctrine you know when brother rather
[55:07] would say that
[55:08] well it is right that you lutheran's
[55:10] preached justification
[55:14] and i knew there was a lot of other
[55:15] things in between but and the message is
[55:17] free sanctification
[55:20] and then i knew that there was like a um
[55:24] some coming in there you know people
[55:25] from holiness etc
[55:27] i knew a little bit about those that you
[55:29] know came in right in between just
[55:31] before you get to the pentecostal
[55:33] and i knew the pentecostals preached the
[55:35] baptism of the holy ghost it's what they
[55:37] called it speaking in tongues but that
[55:38] wasn't everybody
[55:41] there were good people there it was a
[55:43] move of god
[55:44] you agree it was god bringing his word
[55:47] to pass
[55:49] all right but see then that way i could
[55:51] see the agent of the way
[55:54] you never heard nobody talk about that i
[55:57] can see what the new birth is
[56:00] brother ronald said the last three ages
[56:05] completed the verb
[56:10] justification sanctification the baptism
[56:13] in the holy ghost
[56:15] the birth they didn't say the birth was
[56:17] done it just brought you to a birth
[56:20] all right but now follow what we're
[56:22] talking about look at the next one
[56:24] the future home where brother brown
[56:25] talks about
[56:28] sanctification all right
[56:31] and when you ask you're forgiving your
[56:33] sins you're only done this
[56:35] taking that away so that's justification
[56:38] he had lines in there representing sin
[56:40] and things so we evidently raised it out
[56:42] all right and watch but the thing that
[56:45] made you do it is still there
[56:48] do you think that's something you come
[56:49] to the altar you repent
[56:51] you come to church you start you get
[56:52] baptized you start to and the prophet of
[56:54] god says that
[56:55] the devil is still in there
[56:59] bless god without you can't tell me and
[57:01] when i got saved i got saved
[57:04] well what you upset about
[57:07] i mean you've proven that you didn't get
[57:10] it
[57:10] on the action you remember the two
[57:13] brought around running to the one that
[57:15] it was running around with the woman you
[57:17] know and he heard one speaking tongues
[57:19] and
[57:20] the other interprets you know one of me
[57:22] talked to him the guy said you spoke in
[57:24] tongues he said no searcher and he said
[57:25] you ain't got it
[57:28] you talk to the other one he said well
[57:29] just go ahead you don't try to believe
[57:31] you're going but
[57:32] you know he wasn't all dogmatic like the
[57:34] other one you see somebody dogmatic
[57:36] you got a problem
[57:40] all right but now look what he goes on
[57:42] to say
[57:46] it's the old root of evil it's still
[57:48] there notice then you repent
[57:50] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[57:52] christ that he forgave you of your sin
[57:54] notice then secondly comes
[57:56] sanctification which sets our mind in
[57:58] order
[57:59] for holiness
[58:02] now hold on to these words mind in order
[58:08] mine not brain that's right
[58:13] brain is where it comes through all
[58:15] right wonderful
[58:17] mind mind what paul talks about is the
[58:20] mind that was in christ be in you
[58:23] he's not talking about the brain
[58:27] all right so keep that in your thoughts
[58:29] secondly on sanctifications which sets
[58:31] our mind in order for holiness
[58:33] to think right taken away
[58:36] sanctification is a compound greek word
[58:39] which means cleaned
[58:40] and set aside for service
[58:45] sanctification i said a minute ago in
[58:46] just one word it's two words
[58:50] cleansed and set aside let me use it
[58:53] this way we'll get back on the way i'm
[58:55] gonna get this morning but
[58:57] you probably want to hear that message
[58:58] on the new birthday season i still be on
[59:00] sanctification
[59:02] but
[59:05] set your mind in order
[59:10] now get what i said not your brain in
[59:12] order
[59:13] it should come in order by the inside
[59:17] working
[59:18] so sanctification begins to work in the
[59:21] soul of man
[59:26] around draw the heart and then our heart
[59:30] he had a snake and then that heart he
[59:32] had alliance which represented sin
[59:34] future home really
[59:36] now he draws two hearts i've told you
[59:39] you know you can say what you want to
[59:41] i believe he was emphasizing the same
[59:43] heart but what was the reason
[59:44] because he never took out the unclean
[59:46] spirit and he never took the sin out and
[59:48] then put a dove in
[59:50] he showed one with the dove and one with
[59:52] the unclean spirit
[59:54] and the sin all right so it sets your
[59:57] mind
[59:59] justification is the forgiving of the
[1:00:02] sins of the soul
[1:00:04] because that's why the bible said the
[1:00:05] soul of synthesis will die
[1:00:08] now then that soul begins to be cleansed
[1:00:12] by the opening of the word are there
[1:00:14] the reading of the word to study in the
[1:00:15] word how many of you was like i was that
[1:00:18] when i first got converted i thought
[1:00:20] if i'm going to be a christian i need to
[1:00:22] know what the bible says
[1:00:25] i mean that was my point i need to know
[1:00:26] what the bible says right
[1:00:28] so i set out to read the bible right
[1:00:32] well because i was going to be a
[1:00:33] christian i was supposed to know what it
[1:00:36] said
[1:00:37] all right but see then sanctification
[1:00:40] starts dealing with that
[1:00:41] inward part of us called the soul to
[1:00:44] cleanse and claim it that's right and
[1:00:47] set our mind in order for holiness
[1:00:51] set the soul in line
[1:00:55] for god to be able to deal with it
[1:00:59] and to be able to bring us to that place
[1:01:01] now go to the third one on the message
[1:01:03] how can i overcome
[1:01:04] brother brown calls it says the enemy
[1:01:07] now
[1:01:08] so we want to know what the enemy is
[1:01:09] talking about satan
[1:01:11] the root of evil satan what happened
[1:01:14] then
[1:01:14] when the enemy that went out under
[1:01:16] sanctification that was washed out
[1:01:18] returned back and found the house not
[1:01:20] filled with the holy ghost
[1:01:21] now the state of the church is joined
[1:01:24] with the
[1:01:25] with the league of the churches with the
[1:01:27] world council of churches
[1:01:28] and he's explaining what
[1:01:33] if you want me to be playing he's
[1:01:34] explaining that that's what happened to
[1:01:37] the church world
[1:01:40] when luther refused now you'll hear
[1:01:43] brother and make these statements so you
[1:01:44] know
[1:01:45] that i'm saying it right he said refu to
[1:01:47] refuse to take this
[1:01:49] the fundament of the word now you know
[1:01:51] he's not talking about martin luther
[1:01:53] he's talking about the lutheran
[1:01:56] luther was a man of god he he he done
[1:01:59] the best he could do
[1:02:01] but the lutheran couldn't do and what
[1:02:04] happened
[1:02:06] when the westminster regular where you
[1:02:07] can follow it when the wesleyan come
[1:02:09] along the methodists
[1:02:10] and the unclean spirit went out see
[1:02:13] those that didn't go on with god
[1:02:15] waiting on the father of the opening of
[1:02:17] the word
[1:02:18] what happened the unclean spirit came
[1:02:20] back
[1:02:22] just like it comes back into the soul of
[1:02:24] an individual he came back in the church
[1:02:28] then you go over to a good match at this
[1:02:30] church i'm not talking about where my
[1:02:32] brother goes if they were
[1:02:33] bikinis on the beach
[1:02:37] i'm talking about a good mess at this
[1:02:38] church you'll find i'm preaching some
[1:02:39] good times
[1:02:41] and living some good things i come up to
[1:02:42] them thing i'm 72 years old
[1:02:51] see i come up when
[1:02:55] people were trying to live right
[1:03:00] now there's still people out there
[1:03:01] trying to live right now
[1:03:04] but what's wrong with them why won't
[1:03:06] they accept what you've got
[1:03:08] i'm just honest now i'm not throwing off
[1:03:09] on nobody why don't they
[1:03:12] just say well what you're saying is
[1:03:14] right because it's so simple that you
[1:03:15] present it
[1:03:16] till it looks like it's the truth right
[1:03:19] and they say i can't see that
[1:03:22] i don't believe the bible says that
[1:03:23] they'll even tell you that way you know
[1:03:25] and i mean you get this lord right there
[1:03:28] well that's paul
[1:03:30] we don't agree with paul we who
[1:03:33] we there's good people out there
[1:03:38] but they're caught by the system yes of
[1:03:41] the church
[1:03:42] let me said i'm not against people
[1:03:45] he said i'm against the system
[1:03:50] the thing that made the people be like
[1:03:52] they are right
[1:03:55] you some of your parents has turned
[1:03:56] against you
[1:03:58] some of your brothers and sisters maybe
[1:04:00] even you know your mothers and fathers
[1:04:01] has turned against you
[1:04:03] because of what you believe why
[1:04:07] why is it
[1:04:11] you know when you're simply trying to
[1:04:13] explain them
[1:04:14] to them about jesus christ right
[1:04:17] that's right but while they turned
[1:04:20] against you
[1:04:22] because see that unclean spirit had
[1:04:23] already come back into that system
[1:04:26] and it's in the in it's got to be an
[1:04:28] individual people to be in a system
[1:04:29] because
[1:04:30] you know it takes individuals to make a
[1:04:32] church system okay
[1:04:35] everybody understand me so
[1:04:38] it's not just a system of something
[1:04:40] right on the front of a building right
[1:04:42] it's spirits and and lives but just
[1:04:44] think about it
[1:04:45] that unclean spirit that enemy
[1:04:50] the devil and those people are good they
[1:04:53] go to church they worship
[1:04:54] you go right over here i'm not throwing
[1:04:57] up on nobody right
[1:04:58] you go right over here they're
[1:04:59] worshiping one witness right
[1:05:02] right
[1:05:06] you go out and you you go to churches
[1:05:08] and they're doing more worship well
[1:05:14] and see if it's all on the basis of just
[1:05:15] worse them what is it
[1:05:18] let's see how the unclean spirit has
[1:05:20] come back
[1:05:23] all right that's why we had to be born
[1:05:26] again
[1:05:28] you know we had to be born again to come
[1:05:29] out of the church
[1:05:32] are you following me
[1:05:35] to come out of the church you think i
[1:05:39] don't love my people that's in the
[1:05:40] methodist and badness and stuff like
[1:05:41] that
[1:05:43] you think i wouldn't do anything in the
[1:05:44] world i could to help
[1:05:50] it's just that way all right
[1:05:53] but he puts it with the ages go to
[1:05:54] number four so this is also
[1:05:58] how can i overcome this paragraph after
[1:05:59] paragraph 48 we use this program 47
[1:06:02] because of what i wanted you'd look at
[1:06:04] the ages and the
[1:06:06] systems and we'll notice when the
[1:06:08] unclean spirit is gone from a man who
[1:06:10] walks in dry places
[1:06:11] that's exactly what the church has done
[1:06:14] methodist
[1:06:14] baptist methodist those who believe in
[1:06:17] sanctification
[1:06:20] then jesus said the unclean spirit that
[1:06:22] went out returned back to this church
[1:06:24] body and finds the house garnished and
[1:06:26] swept clean
[1:06:27] living pure clean lives all right but
[1:06:30] then if that house isn't filled or
[1:06:32] occupied
[1:06:34] see that's the dangerous part
[1:06:37] you can see it in the ages that have
[1:06:39] come down you can see it in the churches
[1:06:41] why they don't accept what you're saying
[1:06:44] i mean
[1:06:44] all you gotta do is just read two of
[1:06:45] mine amen
[1:06:49] why is it that you and we were the same
[1:06:51] way right
[1:06:52] when they first presented water baptism
[1:06:56] i mean it plainly said black white right
[1:07:00] repeat that one and be baptized in the
[1:07:01] name of jesus christ right there in the
[1:07:03] scripture
[1:07:05] but see the unclean spirit had put into
[1:07:07] us
[1:07:08] father son and holy ghost
[1:07:11] and listen to brother brown when he was
[1:07:13] talking about over in africa or
[1:07:14] somewhere where they were having a
[1:07:15] meeting this storm was coming up and he
[1:07:17] said then which doctor sitting there
[1:07:19] using the three high names he said
[1:07:22] father son and holy ghost father son and
[1:07:24] holy god the brain
[1:07:27] that's how they make them work
[1:07:32] all right the unclean spirit goes out of
[1:07:35] man
[1:07:37] cleanse is set aside for service
[1:07:42] go on down let's read a couple we'll
[1:07:43] just stick with this and i'll try to
[1:07:45] cut it off if i can firstly continue for
[1:07:48] the faith
[1:07:50] look what the prophet had to say the
[1:07:52] first thing you pick it up names
[1:07:54] explaining just case i'm testing back to
[1:07:56] you from home ago
[1:07:56] to somebody that on the internet system
[1:07:59] that don't have these then you'll see
[1:08:00] the prophet was saying
[1:08:01] from the message earnestly continued for
[1:08:03] the faith 1954 404
[1:08:05] morning service the first thing you pick
[1:08:08] it up this
[1:08:08] justification you got in your hand
[1:08:12] you got it in your hand you can't use it
[1:08:14] yet it needs to be cleansed
[1:08:16] then you take it in you wash it
[1:08:18] sterilize it boil it take all the germs
[1:08:20] and
[1:08:21] and the out of it that's what god does
[1:08:23] through sanctification
[1:08:25] takes the desire of sin out of your
[1:08:28] heart
[1:08:32] now hold that point
[1:08:36] because what you hear most people preach
[1:08:39] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:41] takes the desire of sin out of your
[1:08:43] heart
[1:08:45] and you'll hear brother brown say that
[1:08:51] but now here he says sanctification
[1:09:00] sure the baptism of the holy ghost takes
[1:09:04] out things
[1:09:06] sure it does brother around said this
[1:09:07] thing is still left in this because it
[1:09:09] takes a holy ghost and fire
[1:09:10] right that's future home if you read the
[1:09:12] book
[1:09:15] but look what he's saying you can boil
[1:09:18] it sterilize it turn up that's what god
[1:09:20] does through just
[1:09:21] sanctification takes all the desire of
[1:09:23] sin out cleanse you up
[1:09:25] then you're a candidate for the feeling
[1:09:26] of the holy spirit then the word
[1:09:28] sanctify means to be cleansed and set
[1:09:30] aside
[1:09:31] for service that's the old testament the
[1:09:34] altar sanctified the vessels
[1:09:36] and cleanse and set aside for service so
[1:09:37] we've tied it together
[1:09:39] old and new look at the next one
[1:09:47] this is questions and answers law having
[1:09:49] a shadow
[1:09:51] all right listen the blood of jesus
[1:09:53] christ cleanses you from lust and
[1:09:55] passion
[1:09:56] called sanctification the word
[1:09:59] sanctification means to be cleansed and
[1:10:01] suicide for service
[1:10:02] you get what um now that lush spirit
[1:10:06] leaves you
[1:10:07] under sanctification the little lady
[1:10:10] nice goes to church she sings in the
[1:10:12] choir
[1:10:14] she has to mow her grass with a little
[1:10:16] pair of shorts on
[1:10:17] let her get sanctified one time and let
[1:10:19] her put on the fire
[1:10:21] man you've heard around say that there
[1:10:23] ain't no way your holy ghost feel warm
[1:10:24] because on pair of pants
[1:10:26] stuff like that never listen look
[1:10:29] see let the man let that man that'll
[1:10:32] almost have a wreck looking at that
[1:10:34] woman in the yard
[1:10:36] and let him get sanctified one time and
[1:10:37] go down the street
[1:10:39] he'll keep his mind on what he's doing
[1:10:41] that's exactly right
[1:10:43] if he gazes sideward sideways
[1:10:46] he'll turn his head this way the holy
[1:10:49] spirit says turn your head
[1:10:50] there's so much sanctification he says
[1:10:52] the holy spirit tells the man to turn
[1:10:54] his head
[1:10:57] come on that's it there you are that's
[1:11:00] right that's
[1:11:01] sanctification
[1:11:04] the unclean spirit going out of a man
[1:11:11] you see most people preach the baptism
[1:11:13] in the holy ghost is where it goes out
[1:11:15] that's not the way your prophet taught
[1:11:17] it
[1:11:20] it goes out at sanctification
[1:11:23] lust and desires i can stand here today
[1:11:25] and tell you i know that's true
[1:11:28] because i've told you that i came in
[1:11:30] this message and i knew i did not have
[1:11:32] the baptism of the holy ghost when the
[1:11:33] prophet began to talk about it
[1:11:35] but i lived a good life under
[1:11:38] sanctification
[1:11:42] and those problems i had went away
[1:11:47] why because i prayed
[1:11:51] and i asked god to cleanse me and i
[1:11:54] repented every day and i still repent
[1:11:56] every day
[1:11:58] and that's god to help me cleanse me
[1:12:01] lord sanctify me
[1:12:04] because it all just keeps climbing
[1:12:05] higher and higher and higher
[1:12:10] he said well i have no problems well
[1:12:11] pray for me all right i'm just honest
[1:12:14] that's the way i mean it not sarcastic i
[1:12:16] mean it right
[1:12:19] pray for me because i need it
[1:12:23] but the unclean spirit goes out and
[1:12:24] supposed to take out all them desires
[1:12:26] and things
[1:12:28] well i believe i'm sanctified but i
[1:12:30] still just can't help it i still do this
[1:12:32] at the other
[1:12:34] well
[1:12:38] you might already consider to not
[1:12:39] sanctified
[1:12:45] i don't know we're good i know but not
[1:12:47] or to consider it brother that i believe
[1:12:50] the prophet's message and i believe that
[1:12:52] well that's
[1:12:52] wonderful now the devil does too does
[1:12:55] that save him
[1:12:56] right
[1:13:01] now i'm going to explain something that
[1:13:02] i've seen all my life since i did see
[1:13:04] the prophet's message about these things
[1:13:08] that unclean spirit going out that
[1:13:10] unclean spirit comes back in
[1:13:12] he's a religious demon
[1:13:18] right and being a religious demon
[1:13:22] he wants to go to church
[1:13:26] he don't want to go to the honky tonks
[1:13:29] he wants to go to church he loves
[1:13:32] worship
[1:13:33] and music can do it
[1:13:38] he wants to fellowship and talk about
[1:13:40] the word
[1:13:44] because it's part of him you know he's
[1:13:46] thinking that away
[1:13:50] we think of the devil being so mean to
[1:13:52] everything see we blame everything on
[1:13:54] him don't let me everything on the devil
[1:13:56] it's not all that bad anyway
[1:14:00] he's so close if you're going to compare
[1:14:03] judas and jesus
[1:14:08] if you would back there without the new
[1:14:09] birth you'd say judas was a better guy
[1:14:12] until you get down maybe the end you
[1:14:14] know all right but
[1:14:16] you know he was the treasurer he was
[1:14:18] just that or the other
[1:14:19] jesus was out there beating them whips
[1:14:21] running out of temple
[1:14:25] you see that unclean spirit
[1:14:29] they don't want to go to hell
[1:14:34] why does he want to get in you because
[1:14:42] he thinks if he can get into you he's
[1:14:44] going where you're going
[1:14:45] that's right
[1:14:49] think on that because i've seen that for
[1:14:52] a long time
[1:14:54] he don't want to go to hell you don't
[1:14:57] want to be destroyed
[1:14:59] sure he wants to take over but it's like
[1:15:01] i've tried to explain it to you and i
[1:15:03] know i get in trouble when i try to
[1:15:04] explain things
[1:15:06] but see satan don't want to do away with
[1:15:08] god
[1:15:12] he wants to get all the people of god on
[1:15:13] his side
[1:15:15] and if he could do that it would
[1:15:17] automatically bring god
[1:15:19] under subjection to him
[1:15:25] he's not going to destroy god
[1:15:30] he just can't understand i ain't why
[1:15:32] he's not the right hand man anymore
[1:15:36] right
[1:15:38] see satan is very very religious
[1:15:42] now when we get on to the doctrines that
[1:15:44] we ever do get there
[1:15:46] other things we don't agree with i hope
[1:15:48] you remember this
[1:15:50] that what causes a man to go into a
[1:15:53] doctrine two souls seventh under virtue
[1:15:55] peruse et cetera
[1:15:56] river jordan's considered doctrine it
[1:15:59] cannot be the holy spirit
[1:16:03] because the holy spirit doesn't teach
[1:16:05] era
[1:16:08] but you know brother brown said that the
[1:16:10] holy spirit and the devil is so close he
[1:16:12] said
[1:16:13] till the devil can even pass out
[1:16:14] supernatural gifts
[1:16:22] you say yeah but brother dave you're
[1:16:23] scaring me today
[1:16:25] good
[1:16:28] that means you know you need to do
[1:16:30] something about it
[1:16:32] right if i'm scaring you
[1:16:35] the way i preach you know then you need
[1:16:38] to do something about your experience
[1:16:44] and don't ever be satisfied until you
[1:16:46] get the answer from god
[1:16:49] just don't do it but listen
[1:16:54] he said that woman she goes out there
[1:16:56] she goes to church she does it she comes
[1:16:58] home she goes and cuts her grass
[1:16:59] gotta put on her little shorts
[1:17:03] why
[1:17:07] i've always been plain and blunt sorry
[1:17:11] i've always said
[1:17:15] anything that's advertised is for sale
[1:17:23] right he said no that woman is a pure
[1:17:27] she wouldn't do nothing
[1:17:28] it's for sale you just got to make the
[1:17:30] price
[1:17:32] we was coming up the road one morning
[1:17:34] years ago from work and they had this
[1:17:36] talk show on and these people were
[1:17:37] streaking
[1:17:39] and they they were asking calling people
[1:17:41] and asking would you strict would you
[1:17:43] you know would you run down the street
[1:17:44] with your clothes off strict where the
[1:17:46] people
[1:17:46] come somebody received money you're
[1:17:48] going naked in other words you run down
[1:17:50] the road naked
[1:17:51] would you do that no
[1:17:54] this one lady they said would you do
[1:17:56] that no 100 no
[1:17:59] 500 no thousand dollars no 10
[1:18:02] 000 well
[1:18:08] he just hit her price that was the thing
[1:18:14] and that's what i'm saying about all of
[1:18:15] us
[1:18:17] if we're not truly born again christians
[1:18:19] we got a price
[1:18:24] so we better find out and get to pray
[1:18:29] better find out if we are these
[1:18:31] christians that we talk about
[1:18:34] because sanctification is the holy
[1:18:36] spirit working upon the soul of man
[1:18:39] working out through his spirit
[1:18:45] out through his spirit to bring his body
[1:18:47] under subjection
[1:18:51] now how many times you heard me tell
[1:18:54] that the holy ghost is inside of you in
[1:18:56] your soul
[1:18:56] working out through your spirit to bring
[1:18:58] your body under control
[1:19:00] right is that not true what god does yes
[1:19:04] he works from the inside outwardly to
[1:19:06] control
[1:19:09] the unclean spirit comes in works right
[1:19:11] back out the same way
[1:19:12] that's right
[1:19:16] stand the two up right now you're gonna
[1:19:17] see the difference right
[1:19:21] oh one of them blaze the prophet no
[1:19:24] you'll find out most of them is it's in
[1:19:27] the wrong ranks will tell you they
[1:19:28] believe the prophet
[1:19:29] that's right brother brown said let me
[1:19:32] run through this in a hurry and i can go
[1:19:33] on this in brother brown says on the
[1:19:36] future home you don't have to pull them
[1:19:37] up brother
[1:19:38] he said that sanctification paragraph 95
[1:19:42] 96 97 98
[1:19:44] future home says cleanse that desire out
[1:19:48] of him
[1:19:51] because he's claimed it now somewhere on
[1:19:53] there you'll find it you can read
[1:19:56] and you'll see that he's talking about
[1:19:58] claiming that soul
[1:20:03] claiming it may not be the exact quote
[1:20:05] but then
[1:20:06] you go on down to paragraph 103 104 105
[1:20:10] of the same future home you talk about
[1:20:13] claiming it
[1:20:15] see claiming it
[1:20:19] claiming your soul
[1:20:22] the unfeeling spirit is driven out and
[1:20:24] god claims it
[1:20:26] you get over the paragraph 108 and 109
[1:20:29] he's talking about
[1:20:30] abraham and how that when he was offered
[1:20:33] the fact of burying it
[1:20:34] his wife remember the man was so
[1:20:36] wonderful too and he said
[1:20:38] i'll give you the place bury your wife
[1:20:45] look like abraham's sarcastic old coat
[1:20:51] he's annoying by it run around with
[1:20:55] looking like nights at
[1:20:56] all with them prophets top christ he
[1:21:00] said because abraham
[1:21:02] if he'd allowed him to pay it he said
[1:21:04] satan could come alone
[1:21:06] and if jesus didn't go to the cross and
[1:21:08] pay the price he said satan could come
[1:21:10] along and lay claim
[1:21:13] lay a claim on to you me
[1:21:17] all right i'll abide he says
[1:21:23] jesus had to purchase it
[1:21:26] all right then it's all odd thing i'm
[1:21:29] gonna have time to get there bro let's
[1:21:30] make the statement
[1:21:32] it's an odd thing when you get over so
[1:21:33] you put up the lights with number 10.
[1:21:36] when you get over to the seals and the
[1:21:38] prophet is talking about the plan of
[1:21:40] redemption right
[1:21:44] and look what he's talking about then
[1:21:46] the next mystery was wrapped up around
[1:21:48] that one
[1:21:50] inheritance was and stuck out here on
[1:21:52] this side
[1:21:53] the climb to so-and-so and went on down
[1:21:55] until it
[1:21:56] made a scroll because people didn't have
[1:21:58] books like this then it was a row
[1:22:00] how many of them that caught a scroll
[1:22:01] well a seal scroll you know what
[1:22:05] you could break loose out here what the
[1:22:07] mystery of this was and turn it loose
[1:22:09] and you can see what the claim was
[1:22:13] that's why everybody preaches basically
[1:22:15] the seals is the
[1:22:16] the revealing the antichrist i differ
[1:22:19] with you 100
[1:22:21] you reveal jesus christ you can
[1:22:23] automatically see the antichrist right
[1:22:24] away
[1:22:25] amen
[1:22:28] it's the revealing of jesus christ i
[1:22:31] thought the whole bible was a revelation
[1:22:32] of jesus christ
[1:22:33] look at sanctification cleansing and
[1:22:36] claiming it
[1:22:39] look under the sixth seal how that he
[1:22:40] talks about this world
[1:22:44] and how it's going to go through a
[1:22:46] process
[1:22:47] of burning over and things to cleanse it
[1:22:50] why because his blood's already dropped
[1:22:51] on it to claim it
[1:22:53] look at you and i cleanse and claim
[1:22:58] that's what happens at sanctification
[1:23:02] that unclean spirit goes out and the
[1:23:04] holy holy spirit in the form of that
[1:23:06] word
[1:23:07] comes within your soul and begins to
[1:23:09] build like a baby
[1:23:11] in the mother's womb the body is
[1:23:15] completely formed before the baby comes
[1:23:17] from the wound
[1:23:19] that's why the prophet when i was
[1:23:20] looking at those things he said see all
[1:23:22] the elements
[1:23:24] that came out of jesus's body water came
[1:23:28] out
[1:23:29] blood came out the holy spirit came out
[1:23:37] to come and live in you and i
[1:23:41] go to the seals and then you find him
[1:23:42] talking about sanctification
[1:23:46] the mysterious part he says with
[1:23:48] justification saint peter's the bad
[1:23:49] people i want to go
[1:23:51] he gets over to the seventh seal as i
[1:23:53] quoted to you the other day and he said
[1:23:55] now when all this comes up he said don't
[1:23:56] try to figure it out he said go on with
[1:23:58] the same simple message
[1:24:00] because if you don't you'll warm
[1:24:01] yourself away from it
[1:24:06] still preaching justification
[1:24:07] sanctification and baptism in the holy
[1:24:09] ghost
[1:24:09] when he got over 64 preaching the future
[1:24:11] home
[1:24:12] he said if you don't get nothing get the
[1:24:15] plan of salvation
[1:24:17] because the world goes through the same
[1:24:19] as we go through
[1:24:21] the church ages went through what we
[1:24:23] went through if you followed me
[1:24:26] luke there's justification wesley saint
[1:24:28] gates pentecostal baptism
[1:24:29] ain't not wonderful but you and i have
[1:24:32] to do that to be able to come to have
[1:24:34] the new world
[1:24:35] we must go through those stages well i
[1:24:38] just got
[1:24:39] all going to believe that's good baptist
[1:24:42] well i went through it all at one time
[1:24:43] okay
[1:24:44] then don't get scared when i say time
[1:24:48] don't get shook up when i say that most
[1:24:50] people don't
[1:24:52] because i'm not saying you didn't i'm
[1:24:56] just saying
[1:24:56] i didn't and i'm explaining my new birth
[1:25:03] but we don't have to all come the way
[1:25:04] you do you gotta come the way i did
[1:25:08] maybe not exactly the type of journey
[1:25:11] but you've got to come through
[1:25:12] justification sanctification
[1:25:14] and the baptism of the holy ghost if you
[1:25:16] come up here right now and go through it
[1:25:17] at one time you still got to go through
[1:25:19] it
[1:25:20] we proved that with the 3 000. they went
[1:25:22] through it
[1:25:23] but three 120 a half years before they
[1:25:27] were ready
[1:25:29] why because when they got it look they
[1:25:31] went into 120 wouldn't the 3000 was born
[1:25:34] again right here
[1:25:35] but 120 was born again right here with
[1:25:37] all this just didn't know
[1:25:40] this time so they had to have a new
[1:25:43] birth
[1:25:45] sanctification cleanse and set aside
[1:25:47] come on brothers clean and set aside for
[1:25:49] service
[1:25:52] well i pray that the lord would come
[1:25:54] into me and take all of my desires out
[1:25:58] that's good but why don't you just say
[1:26:01] lord just take them out if you're
[1:26:02] sanctifying me
[1:26:04] because we just found out the prophet
[1:26:06] said that's when the things goes out of
[1:26:07] us
[1:26:13] what can we still be tempted yes
[1:26:16] well difference in temptation is sin
[1:26:18] though
[1:26:20] you can be tempted but just don't yield
[1:26:23] yourself to the temptation
[1:26:24] right man because it'll turn out to be
[1:26:26] the wrong thing right
[1:26:28] let's stand together let's put a bunch
[1:26:30] of it before we can
[1:26:31] get to it for more i want to talk about
[1:26:33] we'll review so much this afternoon but
[1:26:36] listen
[1:26:37] sanctification is a very dangerous
[1:26:39] position
[1:26:40] because you think you're saved you get a
[1:26:43] new desire
[1:26:46] right if the unclean spirit goes out and
[1:26:49] the old desires goes out you get a new
[1:26:50] desire to serve god
[1:26:52] this is this sanctification you're
[1:26:54] getting your desire you want to do right
[1:26:57] you want to live right you want to go to
[1:27:00] church
[1:27:01] you want to believe you want to dress
[1:27:03] right in that right
[1:27:06] but that don't mean you're born again
[1:27:08] that's right
[1:27:11] it's been all right back wesley's day
[1:27:14] but this is another day
[1:27:17] that's why they can't understand brother
[1:27:18] branham and i think he talked to new
[1:27:20] birth different
[1:27:21] they can't understand that he's having
[1:27:23] to preach the ages
[1:27:25] what if brother brown i'll give you this
[1:27:27] when we start to make you think a little
[1:27:28] what if brother brown said the the the
[1:27:31] new birth
[1:27:32] is just a baptism the holy ghost like
[1:27:33] people are saying he said what if he
[1:27:34] said that
[1:27:36] you know that would mean that i can
[1:27:37] prove luther never had it
[1:27:42] wesley didn't have it pentecost didn't
[1:27:44] have it
[1:27:46] so i've run into that doctrine too
[1:27:49] and a man come right here i sit right
[1:27:51] down here in
[1:27:52] in gillsville at a supper we had and
[1:27:55] told him that brother branham would talk
[1:27:56] different on what he was saying
[1:27:58] he came right here and said that luther
[1:28:01] and wesley and pentecost didn't have
[1:28:04] nothing
[1:28:09] i had set right down there an hour so
[1:28:12] before then
[1:28:12] he said it and i just made a roundabout
[1:28:16] way talking about
[1:28:17] we wrote around and said that they had
[1:28:18] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:20] they had a new word even he called it
[1:28:22] the new birth of sanctification
[1:28:26] he come right on up here and preaching
[1:28:28] you know why cause he couldn't preach
[1:28:29] error
[1:28:34] you know what people believed him didn't
[1:28:36] believe he brought around
[1:28:39] i'm sorry i just try to believe what it
[1:28:43] says
[1:28:45] and if you had it only as justification
[1:28:48] then you would only have the water
[1:28:50] coming out of jesus's body
[1:28:52] if you had sanctification all you got to
[1:28:54] do then you would only have the blood to
[1:28:56] come out of jesus body
[1:29:03] but to have the new birth there's got to
[1:29:04] be a life come out of that body that
[1:29:06] would be able to come back into you and
[1:29:07] i
[1:29:12] 539 anybody have a need
[1:29:50] uh
[1:30:24] they never had back trouble
[1:30:46] my
[1:31:00] me
[1:31:09] thank you
[1:31:28] oh
[1:31:56] me
[1:32:10] oh
[1:32:24] within me
[1:33:06] me
[1:33:16] within me
[1:33:34] oh
[1:33:48] is
[1:33:58] unto me
[1:34:16] foreign
[1:34:42] within me
