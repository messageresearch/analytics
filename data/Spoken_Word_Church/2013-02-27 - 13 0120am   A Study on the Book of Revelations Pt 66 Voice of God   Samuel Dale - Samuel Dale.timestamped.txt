[4:56] blonde-headed guy that came with Brother
[4:58] Ray and they really you know to remember
[5:01] that

[5:15] and every one of us
[5:16] father we thank you for your grace and
[5:19] your love unto us yes thank you for the
[5:22] day that we have the time that we can

[5:54] delivered us from destruction so we
[5:56] believe you and we just committed all
[5:58] into your hands now as we read your word
[6:00] we ask that you would come and speak to
[6:02] our hearts because that's our desire we
[6:05] love you and we thank you Father
[6:07] committing it all now into thy hands
[6:10] most of all forgive our sins because we
[6:13] want to stand completely and just have
[6:15] your way now in Jesus name
[6:18] amen Revelations
[6:24] one
[6:26] we've been reading this scripture and
[6:28] one of these days we'll get over far
[6:29] enough you'll see why I've been reading
[6:31] Revelations
[6:32] one
[6:34] there's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[6:36] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[6:39] servants things which must shortly come
[6:41] to pass
[6:42] and he said and signified it by his
[6:44] Angel and to his servant John and by
[6:46] record of the word of God under the
[6:48] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[6:50] things that he saw
[6:52] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[6:54] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[6:56] those things which are written therein
[6:59] for the time is at hand and one of these
[7:03] days we'll get over there I think it's
[7:04] about 21 or 22. it comes back to that it
[7:08] says the time is at hand right so we
[7:10] appreciate that okay Revelations eight
[7:14] one and when he had opened the seventh
[7:17] seal there was silence in heaven about
[7:19] the space of half an hour you may be
[7:22] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[7:25] reading of the word
[7:27] now
[7:28] we have been
[7:30] quite a while on the yesterday's getting
[7:33] everything down and
[7:35] you will understand maybe a little later
[7:37] on when we
[7:39] we try to get on over past chapter 10
[7:42] because we really got up to uh the
[7:45] reading eight one but we're over
[7:46] basically in chapter 10 in our studies
[7:50] in the Book of Revelations and you know
[7:53] after this part that we get through with
[7:55] this
[7:57] um dealing with the uh the 11 12 13 14 I
[8:01] don't know how much we'll put into each
[8:03] one uh as understanding but I want you
[8:07] to think about it and I wish you would
[8:09] go back and read the book of Daniel
[8:12] and and read that and then and think of
[8:15] that in relation to what uh we will try
[8:19] to be covering because to me the Book of
[8:22] Daniel is uh it's not many different
[8:26] Visions now I know he had them because
[8:28] it's over a period of time and like John
[8:30] was writing two years on Patmos you know
[8:32] and it only took him two days to write
[8:35] the whole book you know if he was just
[8:37] sitting down writing but he was two
[8:39] years in getting it and writing it down
[8:41] and see the Book of Daniel then to me
[8:44] I've always loved it because it's a
[8:47] continuation of opening up of things to
[8:50] show you uh after the prophet has
[8:53] brought us to understanding showing us
[8:56] the end time showing us the Journey of
[8:58] life and things in the Book of Daniel
[9:01] and this wonderful story but it just to
[9:04] me it's like you see this and then you
[9:06] see more and then you see more and then
[9:08] you see more all right and it's all One
[9:10] Vision then one uh things are
[9:13] transpiring one uh
[9:16] whatever you want to call it uh scenes
[9:20] or or whatever and to me that's the way
[9:22] I see the Book of Revelation
[9:25] because especially as we'll get on over
[9:28] now a little bit later and you'll see
[9:31] that
[9:32] like showing you for instance what I'm
[9:34] talking about in chapter in the sixth
[9:36] chapter where the opening of the seals
[9:38] uh especially say The Sixth Seal and and
[9:41] this talks about an earthquake it talks
[9:43] about things that are transpiring and
[9:46] and we know that the prophet brought us
[9:48] those understandings of it to see those
[9:52] things but then when you read the 11th
[9:54] chapter or something like that that's
[9:57] actually just a repeat of The Sixth Seal
[10:00] because what it is it's just telling you
[10:03] there
[10:04] about this 144 000 and that's where the
[10:07] prophet got the understanding to preach
[10:10] on The Sixth Seal you know
[10:13] and then preaching on The Sixth Seal he
[10:15] would cure it and bring in all about the
[10:18] 144 000 the ceiling in the foreheads and
[10:21] the different thing and see you'll find
[10:23] out then basically from chapter 10 on
[10:25] over to uh
[10:29] the white Throne about the 17th chapter
[10:32] that is actually a three and a half year
[10:34] period right amen
[10:36] uh you know it it will trash it will
[10:39] tell about how these begins and and ends
[10:42] but it's dealing with this tribulation
[10:45] period man it's what it will be doing
[10:48] and that's what I said that's where the
[10:49] Prophet then when he preached The Sixth
[10:52] Seal
[10:54] see he knew already the story behind the
[10:57] two witnesses and so he brings that out
[10:59] and he tells you about this and he
[11:01] brings that out and and things and if we
[11:05] can get there this afternoon I want to
[11:07] make one
[11:08] um
[11:09] message kind of showing you uh what I
[11:13] think that he saw and why he spoke the
[11:17] way he did
[11:18] and and covering the things that he saw
[11:22] and then see if we can see ourselves
[11:25] amen all right
[11:27] now because we're going to start moving
[11:29] up some in our we've just worked
[11:31] basically been grinding
[11:33] to get the foundation all right and
[11:36] that's just my way of doing it but now
[11:38] we want to pick up a little
[11:41] and we'll be repeating a lot of what
[11:43] we've said but I want us to pick it up
[11:46] into what is what does it mean to you
[11:49] and I amen right right
[11:51] you know I mean we can study the Book of
[11:53] Revelation it's like I told you oh
[11:56] anybody today
[11:58] oh they say Oral Roberts University has
[12:00] a complete set of brother Brown's
[12:02] message well you know what they don't
[12:04] wrote around say it right
[12:07] you know you could call them up and if
[12:09] there's anybody studied that right you
[12:12] know you could call them up and say well
[12:13] why did Brother Reynolds say on the
[12:14] first seal well let's say I wanted
[12:16] somebody was writer and and they would
[12:18] tell you the things that he said all
[12:20] about it and give you verbatim
[12:22] the statements of what it is right all
[12:25] right I mean you can say well what did
[12:27] he say about this and they could tell
[12:29] you that why because they have it right
[12:32] but because that we have it
[12:36] doesn't mean we have the Revelation
[12:39] that's what I've been trying to drive
[12:41] home amen and I want to drive that
[12:43] harder and harder because people say we
[12:46] have the message
[12:48] yes well
[12:50] anybody that wants to go on the internet
[12:52] yep that's right that's right
[12:54] right can search the message all right
[12:57] man it's not just because we've got it
[13:00] in our hands everybody's got it that's
[13:03] right once it was made public domain so
[13:06] even anybody can download a sermon
[13:09] anybody can do a search thing because
[13:12] you can go on their internet systems and
[13:15] and and it's not just that you can
[13:17] search to see what wrote around and said
[13:20] anybody in the world today can search to
[13:24] see what the prophet had to say there's
[13:26] never been a day like this
[13:28] even in the days of the Lord Jesus there
[13:30] was no way that the world could have
[13:33] seen everything it was only just a a
[13:36] small group of people
[13:41] or something like that so small a number
[13:44] of people that actually you that Jesus
[13:47] Christ was on the Earth
[13:49] but he realized that whether they want
[13:51] to agree with it or whether they're
[13:53] looking up to argue about it or trying
[13:56] to to whatever that anybody in the world
[13:58] today that has a computer can
[14:01] right get the message
[14:03] and tell you exactly what wrote around
[14:06] him talk
[14:07] and if they don't even have a computer
[14:10] they can get the
[14:12] MP3s the CDs the cassettes and you know
[14:16] any kind of thing to to do and all they
[14:18] got to do is just right
[14:20] and people send it to him so it's not
[14:24] the destination oh we're wonderful
[14:26] people because we have the message
[14:27] that's true amen
[14:30] that's true but we can't rest in the
[14:33] basis of just saying we have the message
[14:35] the world don't have this message now
[14:38] that's where where you people are wrong
[14:41] the world has this message
[14:44] you don't believe me go back there and
[14:46] turn the computer on
[14:49] anybody in the world that has a computer
[14:51] has an ability to tell you what run
[14:53] around saying right amen
[14:56] that can be a good thing or it can be a
[14:59] bad thing because there won't be no
[15:01] argument when you if you're called into
[15:03] judgment
[15:04] they won't get no excuse I'm saying
[15:08] y'all don't know what we're talking
[15:10] about
[15:11] if y'all just knew this message
[15:14] they said well what do you want to know
[15:16] about it yeah you know what you want to
[15:19] know what right around town on one God
[15:20] there's y'all the quotes
[15:23] you want to know what he taught American
[15:25] divorce I heard the book
[15:27] man
[15:29] it's a wonderful day amen
[15:32] but yet they can take the message now
[15:35] twist it earn it do whatever that's
[15:38] right and make it say what you want to
[15:40] do and that asks you to say well did he
[15:43] say this yeah
[15:46] it kind of reminds me I remember a story
[15:48] seeing it that when they were asking
[15:51] Martin Luther you know
[15:53] they said well will you recant for what
[15:55] is written
[15:58] you know he said what I've written I
[16:02] won't right no
[16:05] yeah go see there's a lot of other
[16:07] people that added a lot of things do
[16:09] what he said but he said well what I've
[16:11] written that's right
[16:14] I am no way can recant from them
[16:18] what did you say it's all right to burn
[16:20] all the Catholic churches
[16:26] but we got a book here that says you
[16:28] sitting
[16:31] you see they couldn't argue the point
[16:33] that's like I told you years ago was up
[16:35] in Indiana and I remember it this is
[16:38] probably about 1970 might have been a
[16:40] 68.
[16:42] and brother Billy Paul said that the
[16:44] World Council of churches ordered a
[16:46] church age book
[16:47] well ain't nobody can get a true change
[16:49] book I mean all you had to do was just
[16:52] go to somebody as a Believer and give
[16:54] you a trustee
[16:55] they were just all over the place but
[16:58] you see they ordered one
[17:00] which means they can use it as evidence
[17:04] because you could claim well we didn't
[17:06] write that they said well here's your
[17:08] publication
[17:10] you see Church we're living in a
[17:12] wonderful day amen but we're sitting
[17:15] here facing those things that can
[17:17] destroy us
[17:19] run out of the message Itself by being
[17:22] out on the internets and things like
[17:23] that well what a wonderful day amen all
[17:26] right thank God but at the same time I
[17:28] can search to find out what brother
[17:29] Reynolda said anybody else
[17:34] it's not just because we've got the
[17:36] message
[17:39] it's whether or not it's been revealed
[17:43] she didn't with that in mind I've tried
[17:46] to make that point over to us because
[17:47] see we used to say we we have a message
[17:50] people don't know what we're talking
[17:51] about right
[17:55] now having the message and then being
[17:57] revealed it's two different times right
[17:58] amen amen that's two different times
[18:03] me
[18:05] right it's not something that you don't
[18:07] know about
[18:09] right it's whether or not it's been
[18:11] revealed right amen there's the main
[18:13] thing Amen brother said we need a
[18:15] revelation more than anything
[18:19] now
[18:21] we've been as I said in this
[18:24] talking on the seventh seal
[18:26] found the prophet said a lot of things
[18:28] about the seventh seed
[18:30] and we say well it's just silence in
[18:33] heaven for space a half hour
[18:36] but we found he said a lot of things
[18:39] he's told us what it was
[18:44] he said it was the end of all things
[18:50] he said it was those seven thunders of
[18:52] Revelations 10.
[18:56] which is a revelation contained in the
[18:58] Seven Seals
[19:00] he's told us that this messenger of
[19:02] Malachi 4 will do two things one turn
[19:04] the hearts of the children back and
[19:06] other reveal the revelations of the
[19:08] seven Thunders which is the Revelation
[19:10] contained in the seagulls
[19:13] he told us it's the coming of the Lord
[19:17] now those things we went through right
[19:20] you know go look at it
[19:25] but he's told us that you cannot add to
[19:27] the word
[19:30] you cannot take away
[19:33] then you say well well then my idea the
[19:36] seventh seal is not what what does it
[19:38] make Endeavors what your idea is my idea
[19:40] who's ideal what did the prophet say
[19:43] even Oral Roberts University tell you
[19:45] what he's saying
[19:46] they wouldn't say this is our idea about
[19:48] it you asked us what he said we give it
[19:50] up we'll give you the page number
[19:53] but you see in the message were
[19:55] revelated people
[19:57] we're always looking for some form of of
[20:00] a great understanding that nobody else
[20:03] don't have no and in doing that see then
[20:07] we wind up
[20:09] come find out most time we wind up not
[20:11] having it or sale right amen but still
[20:14] listen
[20:20] to something that the prophet said in
[20:23] the Bible says
[20:25] that there's silence in heaven
[20:29] we've had over the years
[20:32] emphasis placed upon
[20:36] by a lot of preachers and things that
[20:40] in using quotes from run around them
[20:43] they would say that uh
[20:46] see they're the Seven Seals not even
[20:48] written
[20:58] well it says there's silence in heaven
[21:02] there's not a blank in Revelations 8 1
[21:05] right all right
[21:08] it says there's silence in heaven right
[21:10] amen
[21:13] all right then we went through where the
[21:15] Prophet would say
[21:18] this is my revelation of it
[21:22] paragraph 245 of the seventh sealed he
[21:25] said this is my revelation of it
[21:28] well it's like I told you then we we we
[21:31] say well now she'll one two three four
[21:34] five six
[21:37] then we come to seven he said well this
[21:39] is my Revelation he told us what his
[21:41] Revelation was of seal number one
[21:45] I have to be dependent upon him to to be
[21:49] able to understand what seal number one
[21:50] is don't you
[21:53] but he said this is my revelation
[21:55] right well when he come to the seventh
[21:57] seal it wasn't his revelation of a
[21:59] revelation of a revelation and had no
[22:01] Revelation all right amen
[22:03] I hope that come out right I'm trying to
[22:06] put another point in his foot
[22:13] when it says they silence in heaven
[22:15] that's written in the Bible amen
[22:18] so that means the seven sealed in the
[22:20] Bible
[22:21] there was a problem with the brother
[22:23] Brown coming along then and we gave the
[22:25] quote where he said he said this seven
[22:27] sins even spoke up from Genesis all
[22:29] these seals just broke up coming down
[22:31] from Jesus
[22:33] well it's not an addition to the book
[22:35] nope that's right you remember they said
[22:38] to him run around with your ability said
[22:39] you could write a 23rd chapter of
[22:41] Revelation you said they're trying to
[22:43] drown me right
[22:46] he said no he said you can't add two
[22:51] well those seven Thunders brother random
[22:54] won't that be something that will be
[22:55] given to someone he said watch what
[22:57] you're saying right right
[23:01] because you're saying that someone is
[23:04] going to receive something that is not
[23:06] written
[23:07] that's your implication
[23:10] and then that way you can make it
[23:11] anything you want it to be I can say my
[23:14] big doses haven't sealed
[23:18] what you can say it's yours is
[23:22] well that's being silly now it's just
[23:24] I have no scripture for my big Toby and
[23:27] God that's right man
[23:31] but we do have a message that is
[23:35] the message is perfect
[23:38] sure the messenger had flaws in his
[23:40] human abilities in the speech and things
[23:42] but the message is perfect that's right
[23:48] but it's just written and all this in
[23:50] the same basis to me that's why it's so
[23:52] wonderful to read and study is because
[23:54] it's just like the Bible was written
[23:59] then we have the people of nation say
[24:01] you know and it's fine line these up get
[24:03] them lined up with that stud
[24:04] but if you don't know how to get this
[24:07] one lined up with that one
[24:11] I mean you got all you want to about the
[24:14] two shots on the gun thank you yeah
[24:18] and if you lay that gun down in a vise
[24:21] and clamp it down and buckle it down and
[24:24] right get down there and look down
[24:26] through there it's going to show the
[24:27] same thing every time right right but if
[24:30] you hold it up in your hand
[24:32] it's gonna float around right and you
[24:35] ain't gonna be hitting at a horse breath
[24:37] in a hundred dollars
[24:39] you're gonna be lucky with iron shots of
[24:41] the two inch group and 100 yards or
[24:43] something
[24:44] no
[24:46] but you see that's the way we try to
[24:48] make it something
[24:50] why worry about making it something amen
[24:54] that's right if we're going to depend
[24:56] upon one two three four five six
[24:58] of the seals for you know the prophet to
[25:01] review it and we're going to depend upon
[25:03] marriage and divorce if we're going to
[25:04] depend upon this
[25:05] the serpent seat the one God the all of
[25:09] the things then why can't we depend upon
[25:11] what he says about it
[25:12] amen Brothers amen let's say what a
[25:16] prophet said
[25:18] but yet they're arguing whether the
[25:20] Seal's broke or not
[25:23] the Bible says it is
[25:27] yes but we just don't know what we we
[25:30] know what them other seals are
[25:32] now how did you know what they are right
[25:35] how did you come to the ability
[25:38] right of understanding field number one
[25:41] right
[25:42] because of the quote I love to give to
[25:44] you
[25:45] the brother Reynolds said
[25:47] they'd be a prophetic gift
[25:50] we've been over at and over and out on
[25:52] questions and answers on the sealed he
[25:54] said
[25:56] the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything
[26:00] what's going to happen to it because at
[26:03] the end of that church age is to come a
[26:05] prophetic gift
[26:06] to reveal these things amen until we're
[26:09] totally dependent upon him for
[26:11] everything well we better be totally
[26:12] dependent upon the seven three under the
[26:14] seventh seal to tell us what it is right
[26:16] that's right then when he said this is
[26:18] my revelation of it
[26:21] all right amen and then he'll say it's
[26:24] no seven Thunders
[26:26] Revelations 10.
[26:28] then he'll say it's the end of all
[26:30] things then he Obsessed the coming of
[26:32] the Lord
[26:34] the thing that even Jesus didn't know
[26:36] when he would return
[26:41] now we can go through the last
[26:46] message and see what is being said to us
[26:49] to help us to understand amen what does
[26:51] it mean to you
[26:56] to find out what it meant to him
[26:59] we must do that and we'll deal more of
[27:01] that this evening with what it meant to
[27:04] him
[27:06] but if we don't find out what it means
[27:08] to us
[27:13] then where are we at
[27:16] e amen sorry no no different than Oral
[27:20] Roberts University with the tapes and
[27:21] books lesbian in front of me
[27:24] that's right
[27:27] you certainly don't get the message
[27:28] reading Greer's Almanac right amen
[27:38] they truly must come by hearing amen
[27:41] right
[27:42] and hearing by the word of God right man
[27:48] not kept emphasizing something to you
[27:50] the other day that I want you to get
[27:51] this morning
[27:55] it says there's silence in heaven
[27:59] first place and a half hour
[28:03] I know that what the prophet has said
[28:05] and can quote with you
[28:07] know about it so the reason I say that
[28:09] is just for not to be smart ethically
[28:11] but to be the truthful
[28:13] I know that run around covers when it
[28:15] comes to seal number one he kind of
[28:17] drops back to Earth and brings things
[28:19] but remember seal number one number one
[28:22] never broke on Earth
[28:26] foreign
[28:34] was given to John brother Branham say it
[28:38] right
[28:39] and Ben was handed down he said to the
[28:43] seventh angel who proclaimed all right
[28:47] all right
[28:51] so you're not on an Earthly Journey just
[28:53] because that you can see
[28:57] that's right
[28:59] that's why that it turned out to be as
[29:01] we've been over to chapter 10.
[29:04] chapter 10 you find this Mighty Angel
[29:07] standing on Earth
[29:09] which is Christ right right around said
[29:13] that seventh angel has to be on earth at
[29:16] the time of this coming right
[29:18] talking to Revelations 10 1 and through
[29:21] there
[29:22] now you're dropping back to Earth
[29:27] because dropping back to Earth means
[29:29] we're dropping back to the point of
[29:30] where it can be revealed to us amen
[29:35] when John went up over in Revelations
[29:38] foresee
[29:41] five six seven eight nine
[29:44] ten
[29:49] it's things that are transpiring in
[29:51] heaven
[29:54] we want to get to Earth on a lot of it
[30:02] I said what I did a moment ago that
[30:04] chapters when you get into the Sixth
[30:06] Seal it just says there's an earthquake
[30:07] and this happens and that happens this
[30:09] happens right well we run around and
[30:10] covered what happened
[30:12] he said this is the Tribulation period
[30:15] man but he said this is worth 144 000 is
[30:18] called out well it doesn't lift 144 000
[30:21] in chapter and
[30:22] The Sixth Seal is riding out
[30:28] see he's giving you his revelation
[30:31] but he's got scripture for it right
[30:36] it's not just his thoughts
[30:40] he's telling us the scriptures
[30:43] the seal breaks in heaven
[30:53] chapter five is in heaven
[30:56] chapter four is in heaven right
[31:01] right the breaking of chapter in chapter
[31:03] six of the first seal is in heaven
[31:08] Richard Bible
[31:14] see then it's revealed and brought down
[31:16] to us
[31:18] by way of the seventh angel
[31:21] amen right to tell us about these times
[31:24] amen
[31:27] how many years have we preached or the
[31:29] prophet said in chapter four of the
[31:32] Book of Revelation that the bride goes
[31:34] up
[31:35] amen and not seen until chapter 19.
[31:49] but see we're seeing by revelation
[31:52] what transpires in heaven
[31:57] now remember we were trying to bring out
[31:59] about the the prophet said no silence in
[32:02] heaven he goes right over to Revelation
[32:03] 10 and he brings out it's those seven
[32:06] Thunders
[32:10] then you back up to a message because uh
[32:13] Services it's just the time just prior
[32:15] to the seal
[32:19] he said those seven Thunders don't sound
[32:21] in heaven
[32:25] amen
[32:28] people say John was translated up and
[32:31] heard the Thunders right
[32:33] fine sure
[32:35] the blood around said Daniel heard the
[32:37] Thunders that's right but Daniel wasn't
[32:40] translated into heaven
[32:44] he was on Earth writing about divisions
[32:46] that was coming to it
[32:50] see those seven thunder sound on Earth
[32:52] amen
[32:56] amen why is there silence in heaven
[33:01] and where would that silence be related
[33:03] to in the scriptures
[33:06] you remember how I was bringing down and
[33:08] I hope you put this thing
[33:10] at least you snore or not or whatever
[33:12] you know you've been just a hire enough
[33:14] to understand
[33:20] I keep repeating things because it's
[33:22] very valuable to me amen
[33:26] he didn't The Sixth Seal there's no
[33:28] mention of hundred forty four thousand
[33:32] there's no mention of two Prophets
[33:35] in the writing of the 6C it was an
[33:37] earthquake it's things that happened
[33:38] transpired upon the Earth right but the
[33:41] prophet goes over into the 11th chapter
[33:43] 12 and on through and picking up that
[33:49] two witnesses and 144 000 right so that
[33:53] he's tied with the scriptures
[33:55] okay
[33:57] Dooney comes to Revelations 8 1 he said
[33:59] today silence in heaven
[34:02] because I want to tell you my Revelation
[34:04] jumps right over to revelation 10.
[34:09] come on read the book 2 45 with it
[34:13] Shield book I'm sitting here looking at
[34:15] it if you want me to read it
[34:20] he goes immediately to chapter 10.
[34:24] what
[34:28] because it says a silence in chapter 8.
[34:33] in chapter 10 it says Shield up
[34:38] right the things that the seven Thunders
[34:41] said and write them not
[34:44] so then the Bible they sealed with the
[34:46] seven Thunders
[34:49] silver Seven Seals the more you you're
[34:53] really Paul Roberts can say that right
[34:58] I hope they don't mind me using those
[35:00] terms you know because anybody with a
[35:02] book can read that right I can ask you
[35:05] anything that you can go in there and
[35:07] sit down on the computer just type in
[35:08] Thunder that'll come to you eventually
[35:10] and you can read it
[35:15] but listen
[35:16] he goes right straight to the thing that
[35:20] there's related to silence
[35:23] one
[35:25] if something is sealed up
[35:29] it's solid yes
[35:33] The Book of Daniel it comes to the end
[35:34] and Daniel says he's told by the Angels
[35:37] seal up the things
[35:39] and write it on
[35:43] yep
[35:45] would not be made known until the end
[35:47] time when the prophet would come to
[35:49] bring us the message right amen then we
[35:52] can understand the Book of Daniel in the
[35:53] Book of Revelation
[35:55] all right
[35:59] you see why the prophet would
[36:00] immediately go to that
[36:03] watch that this afternoon now when we
[36:05] tied together the Lord willing when we
[36:07] come down to the 10th Vision The Sword
[36:09] in the hand The Turk pull the things and
[36:12] and watch that again be repeating that's
[36:14] what I'm saying so it'd be good to write
[36:17] it down
[36:18] then when a prophet comes over to
[36:21] Revelation 8 1
[36:25] it says silence in heaven
[36:30] he immediately
[36:35] because he knows
[36:37] by chapter 10. the seals have already
[36:41] been broken by the lamb
[36:44] amen come on read your Bible
[36:48] eight one comes before ten okay
[36:51] I'm not good in math if I get above that
[36:54] I'll take my shoes off but I can't at
[36:56] least
[36:59] but listen
[37:02] why wouldn't you immediately go to
[37:05] something that is
[37:07] see you around right
[37:13] around what is revelation 8 1. he said
[37:16] revelation 10.
[37:21] it's the thing that's sealed up
[37:25] those seven Thunders
[37:27] the book is sealed with the seven
[37:29] Thunder remember
[37:31] he said no no no no no you don't
[37:33] understand we got a quote here we're
[37:35] good
[37:36] just keep voting you'll find a good one
[37:40] where the Prophet said the seals are
[37:42] sealed with those seven Thunders
[37:46] sure he's gonna do those to understand
[37:48] we don't know what these seals are
[37:53] he even said that if the seventh seal
[37:56] wasn't broke
[38:00] and all week long he had said this is
[38:02] thus saith the Lord right come on and he
[38:05] said it throughout the week of the
[38:06] seagulls and all you know this is going
[38:08] to say if the Lord
[38:10] he gets over to the
[38:12] questions and answers and he said if God
[38:14] don't come and break that seven seal
[38:16] we're only presuming amen
[38:19] right
[38:21] what about having thus saith the Lord
[38:23] and your only person yeah come on you
[38:26] explain that now if you if you want
[38:28] questions you know people got questions
[38:30] they will watch this and what is that I
[38:32] got a lot of good ones
[38:34] I don't mean yours ain't no good when I
[38:36] just mean I got a lot of good ones
[38:41] but why would it immediately go from
[38:43] Revelations 8 1 over to Revelations 10.
[38:50] he said there's silence in heaven
[38:53] place a half hour
[38:55] to seal up those things which is having
[38:57] Thunder and write it not right but in
[38:59] the days of the voice of the seventh
[39:01] angel when he shall begin to sound
[39:05] the prophet said not in his years of
[39:06] preparation as he was restoring the
[39:09] faith of the fathers but he said when he
[39:11] begins to sound his message
[39:15] he brought around his message began with
[39:16] the opening of the seals right and he
[39:18] preached about three years
[39:21] the other was a restoration back to the
[39:24] faith of the fathers that was written in
[39:26] the book
[39:27] the seals is not an addition to the book
[39:30] or he would be a false prophet amen
[39:34] to try to tell us his revelation of
[39:36] something is not even written at all
[39:38] he just says a silence in heaven
[39:41] now brother randomly face silence in
[39:43] heaven I can understand and go with you
[39:46] and believe you jump over to Revelations
[39:48] 10 to find and show me something dark
[39:50] that is sealed up that nobody don't know
[39:52] anything about
[39:54] and that would make definitely a silence
[39:58] okay
[39:59] a lot of blabbering about what it is I
[40:01] hope I get down to the description in a
[40:03] minute but
[40:04] you know
[40:08] but that brought around I want to know
[40:10] one thing
[40:14] when you got to this
[40:16] part of explaining it
[40:22] and you said all in heaven Heaven stood
[40:24] in all you remember that
[40:30] he said they didn't move
[40:33] because he did said he'd give away the
[40:34] secret
[40:38] nobody around him where you at
[40:40] turning out on there I've got to get too
[40:42] much blabbering going on
[40:45] foreign
[40:53] so he's certainly not on Earth
[40:59] who is in heaven
[41:02] and I ask you a simple question where is
[41:05] a silence in heaven
[41:09] where's your scriptures brother random
[41:12] that you're going to your scriptural
[41:13] Prophet what are you going to tie it to
[41:20] you he said all them cherubims
[41:25] yep
[41:26] all them angels
[41:30] now I'm paraphrasing but I'm quoting him
[41:32] come on
[41:37] come on all those 24 elders
[41:47] standing in all
[41:51] Now where's he at
[41:55] he's in Revelations four and five right
[41:58] hmm come on you understand
[42:02] I hope you're catching on
[42:05] they run around had a scripture for
[42:07] things
[42:09] we must have scripture
[42:13] by way of him see not our own but our
[42:17] own gonna twist it like crazy so if I'm
[42:20] going to depend on him because if my
[42:21] tell me his Revelation I'm certainly
[42:24] going to depend upon him tell me the
[42:25] scripts right all right I I may be doing
[42:28] but I ain't stupid
[42:30] all right
[42:31] but
[42:33] you go to chapter four and five
[42:36] like I said I've got a lot of questions
[42:43] but
[42:45] is the bride does she go up in
[42:47] Revelation 4 1 is that the words of the
[42:49] prophet
[42:54] well I want to ask you a simple little
[42:56] question
[43:01] how can they be 24 elders
[43:04] in chapter four and five
[43:11] a simple question
[43:16] foreign
[43:19] who are those 24 Elders he said the 12
[43:22] apostles
[43:26] and the 12 Patriarchs right right
[43:35] now I can understand because of rapture
[43:38] in chapter four
[43:40] bringing it and John cop in the rapture
[43:43] to be able to go up to heaven to see
[43:46] things
[43:48] but how can those 12 Patriarchs be there
[43:59] I got questions too
[44:03] right
[44:08] would also like something else it was
[44:10] said one time about me
[44:12] you know
[44:14] we were speaking one time on marriage
[44:16] and divorce
[44:17] a certain man he
[44:20] was up speaking and I got up behind him
[44:23] and
[44:24] I asked a few questions and
[44:27] he raised his hand and the end of it and
[44:29] he said
[44:33] I hate it when a man asked a question
[44:35] when he's on the one in the building's
[44:36] got the answer
[44:38] I said I wouldn't ask the question if I
[44:41] didn't have the answer right
[44:47] you want to sit down and talk
[44:49] we talk
[44:51] I don't ask the question that I don't
[44:53] know the answer
[44:55] you say well I asked questions because I
[44:57] don't know them you don't study long
[45:00] enough
[45:01] if you study a long time you'll find out
[45:03] there's an answer all right
[45:06] just like run around them now there's
[45:08] silence in heaven first place a half
[45:10] hour where have you got a scripture for
[45:12] that
[45:22] he said well okay he says
[45:26] although the elders
[45:28] all those angels
[45:31] and all those shirt beams and things are
[45:33] standing in all
[45:39] Now where's he at he's in chapter five
[45:42] he has a scripture he knows where he's
[45:44] at
[45:52] but still brother random I want to know
[45:54] one thing
[45:56] because in chapter 5 all at once it
[45:58] becomes a from a situation of
[46:02] standing in awe
[46:07] it comes to a time of a holly
[46:12] glorious
[46:14] elated
[46:16] wonderful right
[46:18] shouting Glory Hallelujah time
[46:23] in chapter 5.
[46:26] right
[46:31] even John said everybody in the world
[46:34] heard me hollering that's right amen
[46:36] right
[46:40] but you better read your Bible
[46:44] John wouldn't hollering
[46:46] until the lamb took the book
[46:52] right
[46:57] are we in the scripture
[47:00] do we need to read chapter five for you
[47:02] to know what I'm talking about isn't
[47:03] there
[47:08] John sees that
[47:10] lost without a lamb to come over
[47:16] yep is that chapter five because he's
[47:19] all wrong
[47:23] without a lamb
[47:26] pull it up Brothers we might as well get
[47:28] all this out of the way while we at it
[47:30] you have brother Joe pull up chapter
[47:31] five I know you can do that Mary
[47:34] I'll talk a little bit
[47:38] see there's a silence in heaven
[47:47] first base of half hour
[47:51] then there's a rejoicing in heaven
[47:56] I don't really know how long that lasts
[47:58] did you
[48:00] I ain't gonna worry about it right
[48:02] but look
[48:07] I'm showing the right hand of him and
[48:08] said on the throne of what we're written
[48:09] with him on the back side sealed with
[48:11] Seven Seals
[48:13] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[48:15] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[48:16] the book and to lose the sealed
[48:22] Proclamation goes out
[48:26] is there anybody that steps up and tells
[48:28] you now wait a minute you're gonna read
[48:30] them down here just stay with me where
[48:32] I'm at okay but then I said we'll put it
[48:34] up and just read it
[48:40] when you see a book
[48:45] and a proclamation and he says no man in
[48:49] heaven
[48:51] nor on Earth
[48:53] neither under the Earth was able to
[48:58] open the book needed to look their own
[49:03] okay
[49:08] there's much going on
[49:11] and I went much because no man was found
[49:14] worthy to open and read the book needed
[49:16] to look down
[49:18] now you know what the prophet said
[49:19] happened there was he said
[49:21] and this is a man that's had the baptism
[49:23] of the Holy Ghost for 60 years
[49:27] he's not wondering about
[49:31] whether or not he's saved right
[49:34] right right
[49:37] he ought to know by now pretty well that
[49:40] he is saved because he wouldn't be taken
[49:41] up to where he was if he hadn't been
[49:44] saved and you know he didn't use
[49:45] somebody else he used John
[49:49] but when John comes to this point of
[49:52] seeing things
[49:56] he knows there's something about the
[49:58] Plan of Redemption that is not complete
[50:00] yet
[50:01] right
[50:07] he has already written his gospel
[50:12] come only wrote John right you're with
[50:15] me
[50:17] the same one that wrote John the same
[50:18] one went to Batman scene 1995-96 right
[50:21] right
[50:24] he's already wrote about the savior
[50:27] he's already even said
[50:30] and wrote that John the Baptist said
[50:33] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[50:36] the sin of the world
[50:37] amen
[50:40] so he knew he was a savior
[50:44] he knew he was God he explains him in
[50:47] John 1 1 in the beginning was the word
[50:49] word was with God and the Word was God
[50:51] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[50:52] Among Us
[50:54] he's writing this somewhere around 80 50
[50:57] according to the records it wasn't
[50:59] actually pinned as they went along
[51:02] somewhere close to 80 50 before gospels
[51:05] were written you remember Luke and Mark
[51:08] was not even one of The Originals
[51:10] all right
[51:11] and
[51:12] John had already written about these
[51:15] things
[51:17] he'd already seen maybe Millions saved
[51:20] under his ministry
[51:23] right
[51:24] are you the two what Regal difference
[51:26] right two or two million don't matter to
[51:28] God just get the point
[51:31] just what you say you say something to
[51:33] people how did he know they were for me
[51:36] you know then you buy them done gone and
[51:38] you ain't heard nothing else I'm saying
[51:39] you're gonna race it all after your
[51:41] computer went blank
[51:44] your brain
[51:45] open it back up
[51:48] I say those things that make you think
[51:53] the Falcon really run Spencer last night
[51:55] about something I said he said something
[51:58] about your smart man I said no I ain't
[52:00] smart
[52:01] I said a smart man is not one you think
[52:04] knows everything
[52:06] I said a smart man is not the one who
[52:08] knows everything he's already got his
[52:09] brain full of junk right a smart man is
[52:12] a man that knows where to go get what he
[52:14] needs
[52:15] you've heard me explain that a lot of
[52:17] times
[52:18] you know what he said Einstein said
[52:22] he said Einstein said why to try why try
[52:25] to remember what you can write to him I
[52:28] didn't know he said that that's the way
[52:30] these are pretty smart guy me and him
[52:32] get along a little bit
[52:34] don't put me in that yeah
[52:37] but listen
[52:42] I went much because no man was found
[52:44] where to open and read the book needed
[52:46] to look down so there was nobody running
[52:48] around screaming in the hallway
[52:51] it's in a quiet mode
[52:54] nobody's saying I know who can do it you
[52:57] know that brother random said the sages
[52:59] was there
[53:00] the prophets and things were fine you
[53:03] deck of 24 elders and get down in there
[53:05] with it and you'll find out there's a
[53:06] lot of things in there
[53:09] they were there
[53:10] but he said they wasn't Worthy
[53:15] so that get pretty quiet if I sit around
[53:17] here is anybody Worthy
[53:21] I wouldn't raise my hand and you
[53:23] wouldn't do yours either because you
[53:24] know you'd be wrong that's right
[53:26] so things is pretty quiet
[53:29] in heaven
[53:33] but then he went much and what
[53:36] they understand it may we not Behold The
[53:39] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[53:42] David has prevailed to open the book
[53:43] into Luke's The Seven Seals turn up
[53:47] okay
[53:49] a proclamation is made of one that can
[53:51] do it and what's the next verse and I'll
[53:54] be held in low in the midst of the
[53:55] throne in the full beast and in the
[53:57] midst of the elders instead of lamb as
[53:59] they'd been slain
[54:01] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[54:04] are the seven spiritual Gods supporting
[54:06] that all the Earth and he came and took
[54:08] the book out of the right hand to him
[54:10] that set up on the prom
[54:14] um
[54:15] there's your deadly hush silence right
[54:18] there
[54:21] yep
[54:22] even though the lamb has the book in his
[54:25] hand
[54:25] he hasn't said a word right
[54:36] I asked the person a question the other
[54:38] day which was not even a Christian
[54:41] he just don't crossed not derogatory to
[54:44] anybody
[54:46] and I just asked a simple question
[54:52] why was there silence in heaven first
[54:54] place a half hour
[55:02] there's no answer would be able to reply
[55:11] I said what would cause you
[55:15] now first we've got to get to standing
[55:17] all then we get to Rejoice him okay
[55:19] everybody understand how we're going to
[55:20] divide the Book of Revelation 5.
[55:27] well what can you think about
[55:33] what can you think about
[55:36] they would make you stand in awe
[55:43] now the fact about if you stay with me
[55:46] you know write it down if you want to
[55:48] whatever
[55:50] what would cause you
[55:52] to stand and cold all in reverence for
[55:55] 30 Minutes in Heaven which that could
[55:57] mean
[55:59] no telling what on Earth because that's
[56:01] what everybody's trying to figure it out
[56:02] they got it down to 21 years and they
[56:03] got it down to this and they got it down
[56:05] to that well my Lord it says silence in
[56:07] heaven don't say nothing about her
[56:09] watch silence in heaven when Heaven had
[56:12] no time
[56:13] right
[56:15] ain't no days and times and seasons in
[56:18] heaven
[56:19] go ahead but everybody's trying to
[56:21] figure out 30 minutes on Earth
[56:25] well it's about 21 years short door to
[56:27] me well it's over with by now about the
[56:29] 21 yet figure it out
[56:32] yeah but listen
[56:35] what could happen Robbie that would
[56:38] cause you
[56:39] to stand you know
[56:45] I'm afraid to move a muscle
[56:49] afraid about an eye
[56:55] what could happen
[56:58] well now what have you Brother David I
[57:01] just walk up to him and I hand him a
[57:03] million dollars
[57:07] be smart enough to know that ain't right
[57:10] that's right because you know what to do
[57:12] if I started handing out million dollar
[57:14] bills this day
[57:15] they'd be a stampede up this way
[57:21] and they'd be screaming and hollering
[57:27] are you getting the bullet
[57:32] you're letting me silence would it
[57:36] won't be no afternoon service yeah
[57:40] because it wouldn't be nobody here
[57:47] everybody be gone to pay the bills to
[57:50] buy the cars to buy the home to do the
[57:52] what surely wouldn't be silent
[57:59] what would cause you
[58:04] what would cause you because remember in
[58:06] chapter five
[58:08] you are supposed to be there that's
[58:10] right
[58:11] yep
[58:12] maybe not in a Corporal body
[58:15] because I don't personally believe
[58:17] Revelations 5 of this physical corporal
[58:21] I believe it's John in heaven seeing the
[58:24] future that can become physical and
[58:26] Corporal right that's right
[58:33] well it caused you to standing on
[58:45] remember those in heaven must be looking
[58:47] down to earth
[58:52] I made a little point a moment ago I
[58:54] didn't know where you followed it or not
[58:55] but
[58:58] the seven Thunders sound on Earth
[59:10] what would be that would cause you to
[59:12] stand in awe
[59:25] okay brother Dale you tell us what you
[59:27] think it is
[59:29] the thing that would cause me to stand
[59:31] in perfectly all in a condition
[59:34] would not be no materialistic nothing or
[59:37] any form
[59:46] you realize that a revelation
[59:49] is eternal
[59:55] you ever notice that God revealed
[59:56] something to you especially say you
[59:58] preachers you know to think about it God
[1:00:01] reveal something to you it takes you
[1:00:03] five years to preach what he showed you
[1:00:06] in a split second right right
[1:00:10] what about something sister Gail when
[1:00:13] you were standing in the kitchen there
[1:00:14] and
[1:00:18] he's mopping or whatever you're doing
[1:00:19] and
[1:00:21] you know what happened
[1:00:27] something spoke to you didn't it
[1:00:30] you said that ain't nothing but the
[1:00:32] truth
[1:00:33] but you just wasn't gone
[1:00:36] you know that time Stood Still sure
[1:00:39] amen
[1:00:42] now if that was only a blink a twink
[1:00:44] would try to figure out all of those
[1:00:46] things you know twinkling of an eye or
[1:00:48] this is a twitching or what whatever it
[1:00:49] is
[1:01:03] Revelation is eternal amen amen
[1:01:07] there's no beginning
[1:01:09] there's no ending
[1:01:15] when you saw this message was true
[1:01:18] you believe that run around with the
[1:01:20] prophet God sent a prophet
[1:01:23] a split second was what it was right
[1:01:26] right
[1:01:27] I heard people tell about you know that
[1:01:29] God had told him to do this and I heard
[1:01:31] a man one time then and he said God told
[1:01:33] him go fish over here and he said no
[1:01:34] Lord I'm gonna get you over here because
[1:01:35] they moved his water over here ain't
[1:01:37] nothing over there he's like this God's
[1:01:39] kept telling him he said go over here
[1:01:41] and fish
[1:01:43] now you don't argue with God
[1:01:46] if you think you do you're arguing with
[1:01:49] the wrong one you got the guy with the
[1:01:52] horns talking to you
[1:01:54] God don't argue with nobody run around
[1:01:57] and sit come down there in that room and
[1:02:00] meet me and tell me this and he said the
[1:02:03] rest of the day I spent it checking out
[1:02:06] to see whether it was true or not
[1:02:09] quoting from the silver
[1:02:14] you realize when something is revealed
[1:02:16] to you you're in Heavenly places in
[1:02:18] Christ Jesus
[1:02:19] and you agree
[1:02:22] how long
[1:02:25] Earthly time only a Split Second
[1:02:32] and I know God deals with you the rest
[1:02:34] of the day would do it but get what I'm
[1:02:36] saying he deals with you for months he
[1:02:39] does with me and I'm preaching on
[1:02:41] something that he spoke to me one Split
[1:02:43] Second
[1:02:49] I'm talking about how long it was when
[1:02:51] he revealed it to me
[1:02:55] you saw one God you saw water baptism it
[1:02:58] was just a
[1:03:00] was it
[1:03:06] are you catching on right yeah
[1:03:09] what would cause you to stand and all
[1:03:18] I think I can say this about everybody
[1:03:21] here amen
[1:03:24] at least I'll save for myself
[1:03:29] and I'm going to say it in a way there's
[1:03:30] a question
[1:03:37] if God would drop down right now
[1:03:40] and reveal to me in a Split Second
[1:03:44] that I'm just as righteous as he is
[1:03:48] by being in Jesus Christ
[1:03:52] you can have all your money
[1:03:54] you can have all your shoes shouting The
[1:03:57] Flash
[1:04:06] I'd burn the million dollar check right
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:15] but even by telling you
[1:04:18] okay we're going to give you a million
[1:04:19] dollars this morning when everybody here
[1:04:21] to take a check a million dollars
[1:04:24] Michelle you need to come back this
[1:04:26] evening there might be something else
[1:04:28] how many would come back
[1:04:33] yep
[1:04:36] let's say your only condition is you've
[1:04:38] got to burn that million dollar Journey
[1:04:52] I'm just talking
[1:04:56] I'm trying to get a porn cry
[1:05:02] John Saul
[1:05:07] the wanted to take the book
[1:05:09] right
[1:05:10] was he screaming and hollering no
[1:05:15] he waited till he got through taking the
[1:05:17] book then he started hollering right
[1:05:19] amen that's secondary right
[1:05:28] I thought we believe the
[1:05:31] CEOs and the things was his prophet's
[1:05:34] message
[1:05:36] it was the Plan of Redemption that's
[1:05:37] right
[1:05:41] and even though they were back there and
[1:05:43] as they were bringing out while ago that
[1:05:45] the disciples they preached those great
[1:05:47] wonderful things but yet they never
[1:05:48] brought this into manifestation or an
[1:05:51] opening of the scenes and times it was
[1:05:53] left for the end time to be here with
[1:05:55] the bride of Jesus Christ and the
[1:05:56] prophet of God
[1:06:03] The Plan of Redemption
[1:06:11] now remember those that are in heaven
[1:06:14] whether you want to make it literal what
[1:06:17] you want to do with it I ain't going to
[1:06:18] argue with nobody I'm done
[1:06:20] I've already fussed around the world all
[1:06:22] these years
[1:06:23] it ain't done no good
[1:06:25] I'm going on down the road
[1:06:28] I preach what I believe
[1:06:31] you want to know what I believe go back
[1:06:32] and get the tapes of what I believe
[1:06:35] just don't accuse me of saying things
[1:06:36] that I don't say right the tapes are
[1:06:39] there
[1:06:41] I'm going on down the road one time
[1:06:46] this message has brought us the Plan of
[1:06:48] Redemption
[1:06:53] yep
[1:06:55] and you don't understand what you're
[1:06:57] doing it if you don't believe that
[1:06:59] seventh seal is opened
[1:07:03] then you're not even into the silence
[1:07:06] you're not even capable of understanding
[1:07:09] The Plan of Redemption amen
[1:07:12] that's right now how many of you been
[1:07:14] around here for quite a while heard me
[1:07:16] about 82 and 83.
[1:07:18] 79 we don't have the taste but
[1:07:22] we have the 82 and 83s
[1:07:26] where I preach when I believe those
[1:07:28] seals were
[1:07:29] never chose to go back and try to preach
[1:07:32] them over again during 2005 just a
[1:07:35] review for people here
[1:07:38] but I don't believe in arguing about
[1:07:39] anything
[1:07:40] I believe in preaching it and then going
[1:07:43] on down the road up to God the whether
[1:07:45] it's true or not right
[1:07:49] but how many of you remember all down
[1:07:51] through there brother Gary was here he
[1:07:54] could tell you the tape it was on and
[1:07:56] the day I preached it
[1:08:00] these seals revealed The Plan of
[1:08:02] Redemption
[1:08:06] and that the disciples understood the
[1:08:08] Plan of Redemption
[1:08:10] for Soul and Spirit
[1:08:14] which it didn't bring adopt bring it to
[1:08:16] an adoptional form to where that it
[1:08:19] would be to wit the Redemption of our
[1:08:21] body that's right
[1:08:23] to understand the Redemption of the body
[1:08:25] it would take this end time message to
[1:08:27] bring forth and review the whole entire
[1:08:29] Plan of Redemption amen
[1:08:32] but then the prophet's message would
[1:08:34] start and he would bring us the message
[1:08:37] to take to the change
[1:08:39] of these bodies
[1:08:42] the seventh seal then doesn't reveal
[1:08:45] anything about Redemption
[1:08:51] what your Prophet says
[1:08:55] six seal book of Redemption how many
[1:08:57] measures of barley did he give roof amen
[1:09:00] right
[1:09:02] how many seals did Jesus preach amen
[1:09:08] in Matthew 24.
[1:09:12] he denied to preach the seventh because
[1:09:14] he was a seven
[1:09:15] come on you want to argue the point he
[1:09:19] was a Sabbath he didn't have to preach
[1:09:22] it like he was just standing there yes
[1:09:24] amen well I told you over and over when
[1:09:27] I read the seal book The First Time
[1:09:30] when I got over to the seventh seal and
[1:09:32] all I can see that brother Brown was
[1:09:33] talking about himself
[1:09:37] and that drove me for a loop and I said
[1:09:38] Lord I don't understand what the man's
[1:09:40] are doing all he did talking about
[1:09:41] himself
[1:09:43] he supposed to be telling me about you
[1:09:45] yeah come on dude I better back up but I
[1:09:48] don't understand
[1:09:50] I'm back then went to the church age
[1:09:52] book stayed in it for years studying
[1:09:56] and then finally came forth and preached
[1:09:58] it and could see
[1:09:59] you know what he was doing he was
[1:10:01] talking about himself
[1:10:03] I was right all along I just didn't have
[1:10:06] it lined up in Revelation you know
[1:10:09] but he was telling us what happened in
[1:10:11] his own life right right amen
[1:10:13] now what about in my life in your life
[1:10:16] amen amen
[1:10:19] that's right
[1:10:21] the prophet said it and the first
[1:10:25] paragraph of the seventh seal
[1:10:31] he said have we heard the voice of God
[1:10:35] speaking to our hearts through the
[1:10:37] opening of these fields
[1:10:42] he said have we heard the voice of God
[1:10:46] see Church
[1:10:49] the Thunders the voice of God
[1:10:55] we had all we want is some kind of a
[1:10:57] thunder or some kind of a great
[1:10:58] Revelation that nobody else know how
[1:11:02] if you think that's what brother Dale's
[1:11:04] done
[1:11:06] on Sean referee all right amen
[1:11:09] I want to try to preach what God reveals
[1:11:11] to me
[1:11:14] look
[1:11:17] you see
[1:11:19] the Thunder's the voice of God
[1:11:25] that's what Jesus said when he said
[1:11:27] here's the Thunder now I've got these
[1:11:29] all written down here to bring if you
[1:11:31] want if you can read my notes okay
[1:11:34] you know the story
[1:11:38] a voice from Heaven spoke and said I'm
[1:11:41] glorified thy name and will glorified
[1:11:43] again they that stood by John 12 said
[1:11:46] heard it thunder right
[1:11:49] he heard a voice
[1:11:51] yep
[1:11:53] Elijah one day was pulled back in a cave
[1:11:55] and he heard lightning
[1:11:58] wind
[1:12:01] heard thunder that's right
[1:12:07] but he wouldn't get up walk out of the
[1:12:08] cave
[1:12:10] yep until he heard the still small boy
[1:12:15] am I right
[1:12:21] the steel Small Voice the prophet said
[1:12:23] that's what we need to hear amen he said
[1:12:26] that's God speaking in authority to you
[1:12:29] and I right a steel small woman
[1:12:34] what does it matter whose voice is being
[1:12:37] used
[1:12:40] at the time
[1:12:47] are we listening to The Voice are we
[1:12:49] listening to the still Small Voice that
[1:12:51] speaks with inside of us
[1:12:54] but remember voices are speaking outside
[1:12:56] of you and always be questioned right
[1:13:01] Lord spoke to me brother now told me
[1:13:08] is it contrary to the word that's right
[1:13:15] if it is then it wasn't God
[1:13:17] amen I don't care how much loud it got
[1:13:21] right
[1:13:24] it thundered about shiny eye
[1:13:28] I'm scared the people to death
[1:13:30] but Moses heard the voice of God
[1:13:39] they may have
[1:13:41] her son
[1:13:46] that's right
[1:13:48] should go back home it'll because you
[1:13:50] want to be done amen
[1:13:54] have we heard his voice
[1:13:57] that's right
[1:14:00] speaking to us by the revealing of the
[1:14:02] word
[1:14:03] are we just still listening for Thunders
[1:14:06] and Loud things and so and so
[1:14:13] Elijah
[1:14:15] or a steel Small Voice right
[1:14:19] brother random heard a still Small Voice
[1:14:22] and then tried to tell us what that boy
[1:14:23] said to him
[1:14:25] thank God for that right amen
[1:14:29] but have you heard his voice that's
[1:14:31] right speaking
[1:14:36] sister one time year years ago had a
[1:14:38] dream
[1:14:40] she said brother Dale said
[1:14:42] there was a voice in my dreams and it
[1:14:45] was speaking about the Sixth Seal and
[1:14:47] bringing it down in the dream and
[1:14:49] telling what it was
[1:14:53] she said then I realized it was your
[1:14:55] voice
[1:15:00] well you see
[1:15:05] does that make anything out of you no
[1:15:08] right if it did the donkey got just as
[1:15:11] much
[1:15:12] and a rooster too
[1:15:15] right are you in the Bible you know a
[1:15:18] donkey spoke to a prophet one day
[1:15:22] yeah
[1:15:24] it don't matter about what speaking is
[1:15:27] what's revealed
[1:15:32] that's why I asked the man I said
[1:15:35] what would cause you to stand in awe
[1:15:43] going to reveal the Plan of Redemption
[1:15:45] to me
[1:15:47] right because you see the prophet didn't
[1:15:49] say he said they silence in heaven he
[1:15:51] didn't say they were silence on Earth
[1:15:53] and if you go ahead and read the rest of
[1:15:55] whatever was there in chapter five
[1:15:57] you'll find out in a few minutes they
[1:16:00] started rejoicing that all of those
[1:16:02] people are screaming in a holler and
[1:16:04] they're having a Glory Hallelujah
[1:16:06] after the lamb
[1:16:10] not before right
[1:16:12] right
[1:16:15] after the lamb took the book Heaven went
[1:16:18] to Rejoice amen that's right and John
[1:16:20] said everything on Earth hurt him yeah
[1:16:22] so it must have been transmitted down
[1:16:24] right
[1:16:26] so it must be right that the prophet
[1:16:28] said it was given to
[1:16:32] John
[1:16:35] and John handed it Down Right amen come
[1:16:39] on you say now I said Angel which one
[1:16:41] you want
[1:16:43] an angel give it to John and John give
[1:16:45] it to an angel
[1:16:48] how many angels you want why do you want
[1:16:50] to deal with it just get the point
[1:16:54] if John hadn't wrote it down it couldn't
[1:16:56] have been transmitted to Earth right
[1:16:59] but then once it comes to Earth
[1:17:04] and just for a split second God reveal
[1:17:06] somebody you you're standing in Heavenly
[1:17:09] places sure
[1:17:13] amen what about it
[1:17:16] back on these times one of these seals
[1:17:19] and things mean to you
[1:17:26] what about the rejoicing
[1:17:34] it's not been in a Revival ever since I
[1:17:36] came to this message
[1:17:38] I hear everybody else talk about Revival
[1:17:40] in trouble with no you just don't know
[1:17:42] what you're talking about you ought to
[1:17:44] say as far as I'm concerned or if I were
[1:17:46] over with don't say it's over with for
[1:17:49] everybody right
[1:17:51] I just got started in one when I heard
[1:17:54] this message
[1:17:56] because Revival to me is not shouting
[1:17:59] Glory Hallelujah and hooplogs that's
[1:18:01] wonderful that's after effects
[1:18:04] Revival is when God is revealing his
[1:18:08] work
[1:18:09] and I'm saying thank you Lord
[1:18:15] through this silence in heaven when he
[1:18:18] looks down right those in heaven are
[1:18:21] looking down right now
[1:18:24] come on
[1:18:26] do you want me to get in the prophet's
[1:18:28] message with it he said mom was looking
[1:18:30] over the bannister this morning
[1:18:33] he wants to do that
[1:18:36] did they know the Thunders will sound
[1:18:38] forth the thing pretty soon
[1:18:40] who's he talking about
[1:18:44] I know we'll do it with the two
[1:18:46] witnesses to the
[1:18:48] and I know who had a rejoicing time
[1:18:51] bringing it to the Gentiles don't you
[1:18:53] amen well what about you and I receiving
[1:18:56] the same message my way of the prophet
[1:19:00] let the same voice of God is speaking
[1:19:03] right
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:07] see they took word around and says
[1:19:10] thousands of Little Voices thundering
[1:19:12] out which is in the church
[1:19:15] and they made a Doctrine called a
[1:19:17] seventh under virtue
[1:19:21] but see that was before the sea would
[1:19:23] ever broke
[1:19:25] yeah
[1:19:28] of the thousands of live foreign

[1:19:36] if God ever speaks to your heart
[1:19:39] my revelation
[1:19:44] you'll know that's right
[1:19:48] see what does it matter about the vessel
[1:19:50] that's used
[1:19:52] right amen as long as the ultimate end
[1:19:55] is reached that's right
