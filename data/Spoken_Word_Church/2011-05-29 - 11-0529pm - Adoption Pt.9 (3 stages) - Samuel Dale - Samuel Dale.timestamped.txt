[2:29] that's in me planning
[2:38] by the way we've got a little brother
[2:39] here that's been over in Afghanistan
[2:41] amen you know I've seen something on the
[2:44] Internet or this uh Marine had written a
[2:48] book and he was talking about the
[2:51] Brotherhood and how the young men that
[2:54] come back the camaraderie and the
[2:57] Brotherhood that they have over there
[2:59] there's just nothing to take hardly take
[3:02] its place and it takes a while for them
[3:05] to get back into civilian life but God
[3:08] bless you little brother the Lord
[3:16] and this is a song that brother Tom
[3:20] saying and I thought about this this
[3:22] first time I've practiced it okay so

[3:27] of course
[3:36] foreign
[4:55] foreign

[6:25] we'll change over the service
[6:29] amen amen amen amen
[6:35] Open the Eyes of My Heart
[6:46] oh yeah
[7:00] out of my heart
[7:03] my heart you see
[7:10] him then
[7:12] see you
[7:14] here
[7:22] pour out your power in love
[8:00] holy holy holy
[8:03] I want to see
[8:06] me
[8:11] look into the word
[8:15] you can be seen that rothine has a word
[8:17] you want to say to us so if you would
[8:19] come on up
[8:34] I just want to take this opportunity to
[8:37] thank everybody for all the prayers
[8:40] here and everybody else was praying for
[8:43] me because it was a bad thing the doctor
[8:47] said that uh when they felt this thing
[8:50] and it was ugly it was really bad and I
[8:52] could have died and if I hadn't had it
[8:54] taken care of
[8:55] I would have died but see God God knew
[8:59] where that thing was at right Satan had
[9:01] it here he wanted to kill me see but
[9:04] this was for me and for you
[9:07] it was for all it was it was partly to
[9:10] bring us all together that we could
[9:12] truly pray for one another sincerely and
[9:15] see God do something now they told me
[9:18] they told my wife that that maybe six
[9:22] weeks my eyes would start getting better
[9:24] well in six weeks I couldn't tell any
[9:26] difference
[9:27] but just I began I was talking to people
[9:30] here and uh and thank God for the cards
[9:33] and telephone calls and the the late at
[9:37] night when he was praying for me I just
[9:39] can't thank you enough you know and
[9:41] praise God enough but now they told me
[9:44] that it would be a six months to a year
[9:47] and he couldn't go further could go much
[9:51] further well I can see if you can see my
[9:54] eyes my eyes is here
[9:56] now this is a miracle you see the
[9:59] miracle is standing before you and I'm
[10:03] wondering how much we recognize it in
[10:06] America more than one Miracle's here but
[10:09] there's a miracle standing here I saw
[10:12] when I went over to see brother Tom when
[10:14] he was in the hospice I couldn't hardly
[10:16] stand up and back and forth during the
[10:18] service I I had trouble doing that but I
[10:21] still don't learn but I've seen him for
[10:22] hours stood there that's right so I'm
[10:25] and God was trying to show people
[10:29] he is a healing hand is his miraculous
[10:32] hand
[10:33] man and and I don't I don't know if I
[10:36] can I can get it out but it fit to me
[10:38] perfectly what Brother Sam preached this
[10:41] morning
[10:42] I can see this through my whole
[10:44] experience in Christian experience and
[10:48] I've had many things but God says I'm
[10:51] the Lord thy God that delivers you out
[10:53] of them all right so here she has a
[10:55] miracle
[10:57] but now I wonder how many
[10:59] really believes that
[11:02] and sees that for what it is but I just
[11:05] wanted to I I knew it was time because
[11:08] he he said you put it all flowing up I'm
[11:11] still having trouble stuttering
[11:13] and get my brain so your brain has to
[11:16] recompute with your mouth I'm still
[11:19] having trouble with that but it's on its
[11:22] way I had trouble walking having my eyes
[11:26] and my feet together but I'm walking
[11:29] so so I'm just I just want you I want
[11:32] the church to know that none of this
[11:34] this being a priest is in vain
[11:37] because if it was just me and I know
[11:39] there's many of us but if it was just me
[11:43] I see the hand of God in the word of God
[11:46] and we know we never know all things
[11:49] worse to get to the good to together to
[11:52] them see what I'm saying but it all
[11:55] works together to the good of them that
[11:57] love the Lord which are called according
[11:58] to his purpose
[12:00] all right so he's straighten that out
[12:02] and God bless you on
[12:08] um
[12:16] see him come on scene and
[12:21] he said he'd do it he promised it so we
[12:26] see him doing it and then we can't say
[12:28] well there's nothing going on because I
[12:30] believe there is the lovely things is
[12:33] going on Amen I appreciate that
[12:35] testimony yeah I mean if you'd like to
[12:39] turn in your scriptures turn to
[12:40] Ephesians 1 where we've been reading and
[12:42] then we'll go to Romans 8.
[12:45] and just remember now that the Lord
[12:47] willing brother for cash will be with us
[12:50] on the 15th of June that's on a
[12:52] Wednesday
[12:53] and I think that's the time
[12:56] sister is going to be gone and
[12:58] things are taking place but anyhow I'll
[13:01] take care of him might go to my I feed
[13:03] him and
[13:12] we appreciate sister Gail too for fixing
[13:15] bringing the flowers and things of
[13:17] course we really appreciate it and you
[13:19] said this morning we appreciate all of
[13:20] the all of the men the women and
[13:23] everything around the world that have
[13:25] are serving in the military and the
[13:27] things to keep us free that we can have
[13:30] the opportunity the coach had they not
[13:33] been there so you would say well I don't
[13:34] like it because well if they hadn't been
[13:36] over there they'd be over here right so
[13:38] we thank God for that part you know that
[13:40] it stays over there until you know we we
[13:45] can
[13:46] get out of here ourselves but we
[13:48] appreciate it appreciate you know your
[13:50] thoughtfulness and I'm sure brother Dean
[13:52] does about you praying for him and you
[13:54] know and visiting him and and the main
[13:56] thing's praying for him amen oh that's
[13:58] what that's what'll take care of all
[14:00] things see we're not to I have a little
[14:03] thought coming behind this but let's
[14:06] don't let's don't look over the
[14:08] Simplicity of God trying to find
[14:12] some way
[14:13] you remember the prophet said look at
[14:16] the blade of grass
[14:18] you find God
[14:20] it's a simple thing simple thing with
[14:23] y'all you know in their thinking and
[14:26] find God you know so the child should
[14:29] lead them so that's just think about it
[14:31] in that and it's you know I know one of
[14:33] these days I get around to preaching on
[14:34] it but we just appreciate it let's pray
[14:35] and just remember all of these we're
[14:37] waiting them on the way home this
[14:39] afternoon after the service and remember
[14:40] all the little ride around the world
[14:42] because we're all together in one thing
[14:45] getting ready to get out of here father
[14:47] we thank you we love you thank you for
[14:50] your testimony to our brother our Lord
[14:51] because we were all witnesses to these
[14:54] things and all that the doctors would be
[14:57] saying but then we believe that you are
[15:00] the Healer you take care of things you
[15:03] do it in your ways and and all Lord you
[15:05] could do it by just instantly taking
[15:08] away with the prophet of God said that
[15:10] would not bring the faith to us that
[15:13] sometimes of God just you're just
[15:16] allowing us to go through things you
[15:18] know to where we can come forth as a
[15:20] witness see that way then man can't deny
[15:23] what's taking place we love you and we
[15:26] thank you as we read your word you come
[15:27] and speak to our hearts now forgive our
[15:30] sins cleanse us and keep us guide us in
[15:32] Jesus name
[15:34] yeah
[15:35] Ephesians
[15:38] one and then we'll go to Romans 8.
[15:43] blessed be the God and father of our
[15:44] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[15:46] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[15:48] places in Christ according as he has
[15:52] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[15:54] of the world that we should be holy and
[15:56] Without Blame before him in love having
[15:59] predestinated us unto adoption now
[16:02] remember this is our day then
[16:05] predestinated unto adoption
[16:09] this today all right
[16:11] predestinated unto the US unto the
[16:14] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[16:16] himself according according to the good
[16:17] pleasure of his will
[16:19] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[16:21] wherein he hath made us accepted in thee
[16:24] beloved now we'll go back to Romans
[16:28] 8.
[16:29] we'll start in verse 18.
[16:32] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[16:34] present time are not worthy to be
[16:36] compared with the glory which shall be
[16:38] revealed were
[16:40] in US
[16:42] see not just to say reveal this will be
[16:45] revealed in us are really not even to us
[16:48] right
[16:49] that's fine but being revealed into us
[16:52] all right
[16:53] watch what he said for the earnest
[16:55] expectation of the creature waited for
[16:57] the manifestation of the sons of God
[16:59] if you've got a Scofield bible you go
[17:01] over in the middle to your little o and
[17:03] it says the unveiling
[17:05] the unveiling of the sons of God
[17:10] for the earnest expectation of the
[17:11] creature waited for the manifestation of
[17:13] the sons of God for the creature was
[17:15] made subject to vanity not willingly but
[17:17] by reason of him who has subjected the
[17:19] same in Hope because the creature itself
[17:22] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[17:24] of corruption
[17:26] glorious Liberty of the children of God
[17:29] you may be seated the Lord that is Basin
[17:32] to the to the reading of the word
[17:35] now
[17:37] we're trying to
[17:42] bring this
[17:44] adoption
[17:45] that we've been talking about into you
[17:48] know the placing and getting into the
[17:50] right place and
[17:52] you know someone pick up just just one
[17:54] message and they hear it I don't want
[17:56] you to get confused you know because I
[18:00] know what the prophet has said we've
[18:03] given those quotes at previous times
[18:05] and we will keep giving it that your
[18:08] adoption is different from your birth
[18:11] and we know that we understand that but
[18:15] then he would turn around and talk about
[18:16] the new birth
[18:18] and and bring it in and we're you know
[18:21] we're just trying to bring it in a way
[18:23] to to get an understanding so we we're
[18:26] using it as we have many times even back
[18:28] many many many years ago probably 40. uh
[18:33] talking about the adoption in stages to
[18:37] where that we can have an understanding
[18:39] of like the first identity of the Lord
[18:41] Jesus on the River Jordan and then the
[18:44] recognition
[18:46] of the fact that when he came to the
[18:48] amount of transfiguration experience and
[18:51] then going on to and the change of the
[18:55] body so that it would be taught in that
[18:57] way or in a progressive
[18:59] understanding you know growth
[19:01] developments uh all of those words to
[19:05] try to get a better understanding of
[19:09] what we're talking about but we read
[19:11] here where it says that you know the
[19:14] earnest expectation of the creature
[19:17] waited in other words the creation just
[19:20] the translations are which means
[19:22] everything you know
[19:24] the animals the world the mankind the
[19:26] the situations
[19:28] and it's waiting for the manifestation
[19:30] of the sons of God
[19:32] now
[19:33] as I said this morning
[19:36] is the world waiting to come to an end
[19:41] is the animals waiting for a great
[19:44] destruction to wipe out you know the
[19:47] existence of things on the earth like it
[19:51] will come one day
[19:53] I don't think that's the understanding
[19:56] to you if it's waiting for the
[19:58] manifestation of the sons of God and I I
[20:01] know I've given a quote not well find it
[20:04] for you see it's waiting for the time to
[20:07] deliver nature
[20:10] Nature's not groaning to be destroyed
[20:13] the world animals Etc everything's not
[20:15] one wanting to be destroyed it's wanting
[20:18] to be delivered that's right see and
[20:20] let's watch to take place in the last
[20:23] days but then you've got to remember to
[20:26] keep it in the right order
[20:28] that it will only be just for a short
[20:30] period of time and then the world and
[20:34] all creation will be destroyed
[20:36] right
[20:38] Armageddon will take place and things
[20:40] will be transpiring but the point that
[20:43] the Bible is saying is it's waiting for
[20:46] the time to deliver in other words this
[20:50] is a key thing
[20:52] all right the the time that we're
[20:55] talking about now is to me that the key
[20:58] that the whole Bible is tied into the
[21:01] place the position the the doings the
[21:04] were that in this manifestation of the
[21:07] sons of God it will be a time to deliver
[21:12] nature and that would be the most
[21:14] valuable or most important thing because
[21:17] now listen we've had the message we
[21:19] believe that that's why I keep
[21:20] emphasizing recognizing your day the
[21:23] prophet said and its message
[21:26] we recognize the message that the
[21:29] prophet brought we believe that but do
[21:31] you recognize that this is your day see
[21:34] Martin Luther had to recognize that the
[21:36] attack was his day and when he did he
[21:38] was able then to protest the Catholic
[21:40] church and the people believed it but do
[21:43] we recognize this is our day
[21:46] what is our day we say well our day is
[21:49] the day of the change of the body amen
[21:51] now that will take place one day but
[21:54] that's not what the world's waiting on
[21:56] to change of the body right you know
[21:58] that's not creation waiting so it
[22:00] doesn't just say that the children of
[22:02] God are waiting for it says creation
[22:06] which means world and Cosmos the animals
[22:09] the trees the nature is waiting to be
[22:12] delivered all right and see in doing
[22:15] that then you know
[22:17] we are the ones that it's looking for
[22:22] so it's not saying that the world is
[22:24] waiting for for Malachi 4 but around to
[22:27] come
[22:28] that we know and believe that if he
[22:31] hadn't to come we wouldn't have what we
[22:32] have right exactly right but just put
[22:35] the emphasis in the right place
[22:38] the emphasis in the Bible place and what
[22:41] we're talking about is if these if we do
[22:43] not become the Sons and Daughters of the
[22:45] Living God in the basis of what the
[22:47] Bible is talking about
[22:49] in that position of manifestation of
[22:52] making him known where he can make us
[22:54] known then there is no hope for anybody
[22:59] that's right because those that have one
[23:00] owner grown and crying waiting for us
[23:04] he said well I just don't see anything
[23:06] going on well open your eyes wake up
[23:11] please
[23:12] we're looking for something as we said
[23:15] instead of Looking Backward or instead
[23:18] of looking forward let's just say where
[23:20] we're at because we can't do anything
[23:22] about we believe what took place and we
[23:25] look for something to happen but we
[23:27] we're here
[23:29] and you know tomorrow will be today
[23:31] right that's right because that's why
[23:34] the Bible says today is the day of
[23:35] salvation
[23:37] it moves it's with who
[23:39] so when tomorrow comes we'll be looking
[23:41] back to today as history okay
[23:44] all right
[23:45] and another day to come all right but
[23:48] see this state where we're at in seeing
[23:50] that what the world is waiting on
[23:54] as I said if you've got your Scofield
[23:56] bible you look there in the Middle with
[23:58] a little circle around it showing that
[24:00] he's giving you the understanding of
[24:02] what the world is waiting for the
[24:04] unveiling
[24:07] of the sons and daughters now it just
[24:09] said sons of God so I hope the sisters
[24:12] don't get upset and say Well it don't
[24:13] say nothing about the women you know but
[24:15] that's just the way the Bible's written
[24:17] right right see it's the Sons and
[24:19] Daughters of the Living God because I
[24:21] believe you sisters have just as much
[24:23] right to speak the word as we do that's
[24:26] what I I've been kind of you know
[24:28] ridiculed a little bit made by some
[24:30] people for believing it but I believe
[24:32] that Adam
[24:34] was there could name the animal that's
[24:36] right but he couldn't bring a baby
[24:39] whether it come right or wrong he
[24:41] couldn't bring it all right and he
[24:43] couldn't have brought it if it hadn't
[24:44] you know if the sin hadn't happened he
[24:46] couldn't bring it that's what Eve would
[24:47] put there for she had her part
[24:50] she would go equaling him there until
[24:52] the fall came all right but she keeping
[24:55] it in the right order to where that we
[24:57] can understand
[24:58] all right we preached about that you
[25:01] know that the prophet of God said
[25:03] that what is the manifestation
[25:07] he says to making known
[25:10] me all right I've tried to explain that
[25:14] emphasize the point
[25:17] that if we make him known
[25:20] by preaching teaching talking the
[25:23] sisters talking to one another are you
[25:25] talking to your children are you you
[25:27] know all the whole
[25:29] thing of Christianity is we make him
[25:31] known all right and to see then he may
[25:34] trust them by signs and wonders and by
[25:37] things taking place all right see then
[25:40] that way it's the the understanding that
[25:42] the world is waiting on you and I
[25:47] to make it known
[25:48] now I hope you follow me because it
[25:53] doesn't say that the prophet of God was
[25:55] for the perfecting of the Saints
[25:57] according to my Bible it says the
[25:59] faithful Ministries for the perfecting
[26:00] of the same but there's one thing for
[26:02] certain
[26:03] you click it off on your internet but
[26:05] don't listen to this before you click it
[26:07] off you know hear it
[26:08] and one thing for certain you and I no
[26:10] preachers none of us wouldn't have had
[26:12] anything had the problem if he hadn't a
[26:13] problem right so the emphasis goes wrong
[26:15] and you know where he's at he's in the
[26:17] body of Christ
[26:20] Ministry because he could fulfill any
[26:22] part of the faithful Ministry in his
[26:24] doing because of the word he was at so
[26:27] when I say the five full ministry I'm
[26:29] talking about him
[26:31] when I'm talking like brother Adam said
[26:34] he said the 5-4 ministry
[26:38] he said they said will the bride have a
[26:40] Ministry
[26:42] he said sure
[26:44] she consists of Apostles prophets
[26:46] evangelist pastors until
[26:50] so that's what she consists of
[26:52] that's right because all around the
[26:54] world there's people that are you know
[26:56] depending on the ministry to break down
[26:59] the prophet's message we don't have to
[27:01] explain it
[27:03] but break it down speak on it and long
[27:06] enough to the Holy Spirit can explain
[27:07] amen and to where we can get into
[27:09] revelation of it all right see then
[27:11] that's what the world is waiting on
[27:15] waiting on you and I to find our place
[27:19] all right
[27:20] you said well we've been doing we've
[27:22] been talking about these things for 40
[27:23] years yeah but they're coming to pass
[27:25] too
[27:27] and it's been coming to pass that's what
[27:30] my emphasis has been lately on not to
[27:32] say something to come or something that
[27:34] has been it's looking to what's taking
[27:35] place now amen you say well well I just
[27:39] don't see nothing well then you're blind
[27:43] nice you wouldn't say anything when
[27:45] Jesus was dying
[27:47] come on how long could we stand and talk
[27:49] about brother Brown and what he would
[27:51] say about the Apostle Paul
[27:53] said it sure didn't look bad in the days
[27:55] of Paul when he come to the end of his
[27:57] ministry that he was down in jail
[28:00] didn't even have a coat to stay warm
[28:02] with had to send a brother after it or
[28:04] tell him to bring it with him
[28:06] a physician
[28:08] that where he used to be and just speak
[28:10] and people would die and things would
[28:12] happen because it's against him or if it
[28:14] would heal you know the sick was healed
[28:15] but said his last days he's sitting down
[28:18] in the jail
[28:20] saying I'm cold bring him a coat
[28:25] but you know that's one brother random
[28:26] city looked up and he said
[28:28] death
[28:30] where's your sting
[28:32] when he was fixing to get his head cut
[28:34] off
[28:38] wow see the way we look at it Paul order
[28:40] walked up to that old Guillotine or what
[28:42] it was and just laid down there and said
[28:43] follow
[28:44] no guilty and go and just stop
[28:47] and stop we'll bring in a guy with a
[28:50] knack he just stops you know see that's
[28:53] what we think it ought to be
[28:56] but no God had a plan
[28:58] Paul was working as we said this morning
[29:01] all things worked good look at the Lord
[29:04] Jesus in the life of his ministry
[29:08] look at brother Branham right now more
[29:11] personal to where we can understand look
[29:13] at him in the last days of his ministry
[29:15] when he used to preach to 500 000.
[29:19] he used to preach to a thousand maybe
[29:21] two thousand five thousand
[29:23] in his last days he may be 25 in a
[29:26] little old trailer out there
[29:31] and he came down to the spoken word
[29:36] right
[29:38] and how many accounts do you have that
[29:40] he told of of the spoken word
[29:45] come on
[29:48] it was only what five times
[29:52] maybe seven or whatever you call it 20
[29:54] if you want to call it 50 if you want to
[29:56] call him no problem
[29:58] what I'm talking about
[30:01] it looked like the greater part of
[30:03] brother Brown's Ministry was in his
[30:05] early Ministry when he would just simply
[30:06] stand there and say I take every Spirit
[30:08] under my control and demons are just
[30:10] leaving and sick with Hill the dead was
[30:11] raised and
[30:13] the shawl kind of thing
[30:17] you see we look at it wrong don't we
[30:19] so let's just don't miss this one all
[30:21] right because we can't afford it
[30:23] all right but see what I want to do is
[30:25] just give you
[30:27] we read in the Bible
[30:30] that the whole creation
[30:33] the earnest expectation of the creature
[30:35] waited for the manifestation of the Son
[30:37] of God I'd like to read that to you from
[30:39] the original translation
[30:43] this is from the the
[30:46] original dyed lot now all right which is
[30:50] translated straight over into English
[30:52] the original dialogue says for the
[30:55] earnest desire of the creation the
[30:59] revelation of the sons of God look for
[31:04] now that's the original translation
[31:07] so what do you understand it for the
[31:08] earnest desire of the creation
[31:10] the revelation of the sons of God look
[31:13] for
[31:14] dude that's what everything's looking
[31:16] for the revelation of the sons of God
[31:18] all right
[31:19] see myself what is this saying the
[31:22] making known of the sons of God now I
[31:24] emphasize again
[31:26] we can't do anything
[31:29] but if we make him known he will make us
[31:32] not all right now this is the making
[31:35] known of what the bride of Christ right
[31:38] but what is that the making known of
[31:40] Jesus Christ in his bride
[31:44] you agree yes all right so what are we
[31:47] looking at now Strong's gives you the
[31:49] definition of manifestation and it says
[31:53] revelation
[31:54] be revealed
[31:56] to lighten that doesn't mean you know to
[32:00] flatten your load that means to lighten
[32:02] up you know to illuminate or bring into
[32:05] view
[32:06] it means manifestation it means coming
[32:11] I thought we were looking for the coming
[32:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:15] and I thought he had to come here before
[32:18] we could go there
[32:19] all right it means appearing
[32:24] that's what manifestation means a period
[32:27] I thought we believed that he would
[32:29] appear in last days and at the appearing
[32:31] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:33] I thought we were in the scriptures to
[32:34] believe it
[32:36] but what it means too it means to lay
[32:40] something bare
[32:43] you know
[32:44] it means to to actually make something
[32:48] naked
[32:50] the word manifestation that actually
[32:52] means to make something to lay it back
[32:55] or to to actually to make it naked you
[32:58] said well why would it be doing that see
[33:00] because what it's doing is bringing it
[33:02] out from Undercover
[33:04] you understand
[33:06] see when you bring something out on from
[33:08] out from undercover you lay it back you
[33:10] open it up right this is the day when
[33:13] the Sons and Daughters of God are to
[33:15] open up
[33:17] enlightened by the eye of Revelation and
[33:20] to open up and to bring God not naked
[33:24] but to bring him into the bases that you
[33:27] can see him
[33:29] right
[33:31] see lay open to the eye right amen the
[33:35] word is nothing to cover naked means
[33:38] there's there's nothing see in this it's
[33:40] probably water I I can't see it I'd have
[33:43] taste it to know
[33:44] what if it would be some way to remove
[33:46] this outside Shale without the water
[33:49] filling all over the place then see I
[33:52] would lay that bear and it would be
[33:54] naked before my eye
[33:56] otherwise I could see it all right
[34:02] all right let's give you some more uh
[34:06] definitions of
[34:08] well let me finish that one Ultra strong
[34:10] it means a disclosure of Truth
[34:15] now manifestation this is out of your
[34:17] Strong's number 602 is going to look it
[34:19] up
[34:20] a disclosure of Truth
[34:23] so I thought we were to preach Jesus
[34:25] Christ
[34:27] instruction concerning things
[34:31] before known
[34:33] now you can use that two ways either way
[34:35] so it wouldn't matter so before known
[34:37] would mean that it was known once before
[34:40] which it was in Jesus Christ
[34:44] are before known to be down here that it
[34:48] means it's coming into a place of
[34:49] Illumination today to be made known
[34:51] right now that it was never known before
[34:54] so either way you take the definition of
[34:56] what what the person is saying it says
[35:00] it's used now manifestation it's used of
[35:03] event events by which stains or States
[35:06] are persons hit or two withdrawn from
[35:10] view me
[35:12] are made visible to all
[35:16] manifestation or appearance
[35:19] see we're not here to adoption as I've
[35:23] tried to tell you is not the the father
[35:25] going off the scene
[35:27] and the sun coming on the scene I've
[35:30] never preached that right the 47 years
[35:33] I've been preaching I've never preached
[35:35] nothing like that because I didn't
[35:36] believe it then or don't believe it now
[35:37] I believe adoption is the father coming
[35:40] on to sing in the sun because that's
[35:43] what happened when Jesus Jesus was God
[35:47] made manifest in human face what will
[35:49] the bride of Christ be in the last days
[35:51] go and make manifest I tried to say that
[35:54] many years ago well no it's the father's
[35:57] going off oh God quote here where the
[35:59] father he just leaving
[36:01] what it's not right
[36:05] all right listen to what John I'll give
[36:08] you some some other Bibles I like them
[36:10] I've got a book there it's called 26
[36:12] translations of the Bible and I really
[36:14] love to look at what other translators
[36:17] say beside the King James version
[36:20] I stay with the King James version
[36:21] couldn't believe it all right but I
[36:24] still like to read other translations to
[36:26] see what they hold
[36:28] and you'd be surprised sometimes what
[36:30] you can receive from it
[36:32] um taken from the New Testament that was
[36:35] translated or brought forth by J.B
[36:38] Rotherham
[36:41] this is what manifestation or what that
[36:43] scripture is saying are the
[36:45] manifestation of sons of God
[36:47] for the eager Outlook of creation
[36:52] ardently awaited
[36:55] the revealing
[36:57] of the sons of God
[37:01] though the world is waiting for the
[37:03] revealing of the sons of God
[37:05] another translation which is the Epistle
[37:08] of Paul
[37:09] which was written visuals or Paul which
[37:12] was written by W J corn burn
[37:17] b-e-a-r-n-b-e-a-r-e convert
[37:20] just for the longing of the creation
[37:23] looks eagerly for the time when the
[37:27] glory of inferences the sons of God
[37:31] shall be revealed
[37:34] huh
[37:35] good point shouldn't it
[37:37] revised Standard Version
[37:41] more modern translations right
[37:44] so as far as the creation weights with
[37:47] eager longing for the revealing of the
[37:49] sons of God
[37:53] the Amplified
[37:57] fish for creation wakes
[38:00] efficiently for God's Sons to be made
[38:03] known waiting for the revealing the
[38:07] distort disposing
[38:10] is closing you know bringing out
[38:12] disclosing my words are sometimes I
[38:14] can't pronounce them correctly but
[38:16] waiting for the revealing our disclosing
[38:18] of their sonship
[38:21] are they holding a pretty good point now
[38:24] Phillips translation which is his Bible
[38:26] you know the whole creation is on tiptoe
[38:31] to see the wonderful sight
[38:33] of the sons of God
[38:36] coming into their own
[38:39] I like to read those because I like to
[38:42] see the comparison
[38:44] to see how they hold a point you know
[38:46] all right and they all was pointing
[38:50] each of the translations and that's all
[38:53] that's given see if it's 20 tricks
[38:55] translation doesn't mean I got to buy a
[38:56] book with 26 translations it'd be like
[38:59] oh you know it means if there's any
[39:01] different in variation
[39:03] in it they don't they give the
[39:05] difference in variation but if every one
[39:07] of them said during this expectation of
[39:09] the creature waited for the
[39:10] manifestation sons of God they don't
[39:12] they don't put that in there because
[39:13] that's already in one doing
[39:15] he's just giving you something where
[39:17] they have different variations of speech
[39:19] right but now listen
[39:22] so then the world is waiting
[39:26] for you and I
[39:29] to reach a place
[39:33] a position
[39:35] we'll come down to that in the message
[39:37] today if you'll watch it real close
[39:40] and you'll see we're running around
[39:41] places the things has to work to be but
[39:45] I want you to just think about it
[39:47] I believe that this is the most special
[39:49] place
[39:51] now this is that brother they have
[39:52] personal opinion
[39:54] I believe if the Sons and Daughters of
[39:57] God As I said a moment ago cannot come
[40:00] to the position of sonship
[40:03] in order they're supposed to be
[40:05] then there will be no future there is no
[40:08] future home there is no Pace no present
[40:10] no nothing right it's all hinged on
[40:13] whether or not we can reach that may not
[40:15] be but two of us
[40:18] you notice I said us
[40:21] because I'm fully contended as the
[40:23] prophet said if there's not but one in
[40:25] Georgia going I'm the one you
[40:28] need another state
[40:30] that's the way I got to believe it all
[40:33] right but that's the way you've got to
[40:34] believe it all right all right so then
[40:38] the world is waiting on you
[40:42] to reach a place well I just don't see
[40:45] how in the world we can well
[40:48] all right we preached out the other week
[40:50] that brought our Wednesday I guess it
[40:52] was or last Sunday whenever I was
[40:53] preaching a couple weeks ago
[40:55] that
[40:56] even persecution I mean it's just past
[40:58] Wednesday persecution is brought upon us
[41:01] for a reason right
[41:03] drive us to a place
[41:05] the prophet of God says what see we talk
[41:08] about desperation right
[41:11] all right boy we need to get desperate
[41:13] well I agree with you
[41:15] but now do we go to the prophet and say
[41:18] now brother Branham
[41:19] what is that the definition of
[41:22] desperation and what is the definition
[41:24] of how we obtain under desperation
[41:27] so he preaches a message called
[41:28] desperation and you know on that message
[41:30] you remember what he said
[41:32] he said we can't get desperate
[41:36] until he
[41:39] brings it to us
[41:42] but he said now whoa listen but he said
[41:46] as much as we've seen
[41:48] of God in his manifestation in order to
[41:52] bring us to desperation
[41:54] see now let's put it all together but
[41:56] everybody thinks it is I'm trying to you
[41:58] know but that's in the same book the
[42:00] same message and
[42:02] but the point is not to just say well
[42:04] will it sit down and wait on God then
[42:07] well these days he'll make us desperate
[42:09] he gets ready I'm ready
[42:13] well now that's the kind of person for
[42:15] 40 years has gone off into
[42:19] and
[42:21] look back and look forward
[42:24] but the little true variety goes right
[42:25] on down the road
[42:27] and no matter what takes place we're
[42:29] still the same people
[42:32] all right
[42:33] let's see now let's get the point
[42:36] you and I are
[42:39] and we are a special people
[42:41] that all the things of life
[42:44] the world Etc
[42:46] is waiting
[42:48] on a Little Ride
[42:51] a little bride to be able to
[42:54] handle
[42:56] lack of words that I could use
[42:58] the word of God
[43:02] handle means you know that you get a
[43:04] hold of something what I mean by it is
[43:06] is to some see it's the not to go in
[43:09] fanaticism with it
[43:12] it's very easy to take a Bible going to
[43:14] fanaticism I've talked to people I told
[43:16] you I talked to a preacher one day and
[43:18] it was a Pentecostal preacher he said
[43:19] I'm not working on commanding the Lord I
[43:22] mean commanding the devil he said I've
[43:24] done that he said I'm working on
[43:26] commanding the Lord
[43:30] I didn't talk to you anymore
[43:33] I don't want to talk to him anymore
[43:35] he's going to command the Lord he might
[43:37] command and without me
[43:40] a bunch of scared of him I just wouldn't
[43:41] talk to him no more
[43:44] why because when a man gets that foolish
[43:46] what can you say
[43:49] you know bad as one boy told me one time
[43:51] he said the end of the world is here and
[43:53] I said well Glory I believe it too he
[43:56] said yep cause him buzzards is laying
[43:57] three eggs
[44:01] I said
[44:04] well
[44:06] would you mind explain it you know what
[44:09] do you mean he said well you know in the
[44:11] Bible where it takes all them buzzers to
[44:12] eat up the bodies he said budgers used
[44:14] to have one but I was delivered with him
[44:16] I used to be around buzzards I've seen
[44:18] them all my life
[44:19] never did go around with us kids we go
[44:21] around the home place we'd find a buzzer
[44:22] so we would like help and generally had
[44:24] more than one but I didn't argue with
[44:25] anyone had me in the head I was just
[44:27] wanting to hear what he said he said
[44:29] that you know I said all them buzzards
[44:30] said they got to have all them buzzards
[44:32] to eat up the bodies
[44:36] okay
[44:42] that didn't make me too happy you know I
[44:44] didn't feel no great Revelation no no
[44:46] thing over it I just and I wasn't
[44:48] laughing at him either
[44:50] oh this you know and I actually heard a
[44:53] person say one time and it was one of
[44:55] them said like this he said in the Bible
[44:57] where it says watch him pray
[44:59] which was the same guy you told me
[45:02] and he said you know what that means I
[45:04] said well I I do but what do you what do
[45:08] you say it he said well watch and pray
[45:09] means you keep one eye open while you're
[45:11] praying
[45:12] yeah
[45:14] pretty good point you know
[45:16] I mean take it literally and I'm not
[45:18] joking now that anything happened all
[45:20] right but listen folks the Bible's not
[45:24] waiting on stuff like that
[45:26] he's not waiting on the fanaticisms as
[45:29] followed this message this went off into
[45:31] polygamies just went off into
[45:33] Millions following people you know and
[45:36] and all like that and around the world
[45:38] and brother so and so is the the man
[45:40] that took over when brother Branham left
[45:42] you know and this that or the other
[45:44] that's not that's not what the world is
[45:47] waiting on
[45:49] is waiting on sincere on his hearted
[45:53] good people
[45:55] that will take the word of God
[45:57] and just simply stay with it when
[45:59] everybody else has to run out one of
[46:01] their owns and do things you know but
[46:03] just keep on being Christians day after
[46:05] day and just keep believing God and just
[46:08] keep worshiping God and just saying well
[46:10] Lord now I'm not making fun of them it's
[46:12] just that's the way they believe you
[46:15] know I just don't believe it that way
[46:17] you know and it's not waiting on
[46:20] something that we think is great big you
[46:22] know
[46:23] that's what I said you see him in the
[46:24] message see
[46:25] and a young guy I'll come along and boy
[46:27] he's got a little
[46:29] um Charisma or what you call it you know
[46:31] Cash America or whatever how you
[46:32] pronounce those big words and and all
[46:34] that people just flock with him this is
[46:36] it this is it
[46:38] this is what's going to take us out of
[46:39] here
[46:40] well then maybe a year or two later you
[46:43] see him I don't know another dude to do
[46:46] it with him and then they're going back
[46:47] where they come from or going to other
[46:49] places
[46:50] see no it's not that right
[46:55] but you see we think it's some kind of a
[46:58] great big
[46:59] thing
[47:01] that we can't attain them to
[47:05] Alice don't make it that way either
[47:07] I thought the prophet of God should a
[47:09] Christian Life was one that could jump
[47:11] up in the Airship Gloria Hallelujah to
[47:13] walk straight and they come down to me
[47:16] that was a great definition
[47:18] just to be able to walk straight when
[47:20] you come back down to earth you know and
[47:23] just be yourself right
[47:25] and that way you don't get all exalted
[47:27] and blowed up about it you just go on
[47:30] being yourself okay all right we get off
[47:32] today but see what I want to talk about
[47:34] I want to try to hold it to a point now
[47:37] I don't want to go over into we're going
[47:40] to read a little about Matthew 17. but I
[47:42] don't want to go there with it tonight I
[47:44] mean today all right we'll take a
[47:47] message on that but what I want you to
[47:49] do is just kind of hold a point right
[47:50] here
[47:51] and I'll give you the emphasis of the
[47:53] number uh
[47:55] one of all your notes
[47:57] the word that you'll kind of follow me
[48:00] in the line that I'm going because we
[48:03] talk about adoption
[48:05] and actually see we've been in this the
[48:09] process of adoption
[48:12] all right but there is a completion of
[48:15] it all right
[48:16] and and I want to see more of God moving
[48:19] and Etc the great things happening right
[48:21] but I realized too that we must wait on
[48:25] him
[48:26] to be able to go forth brother Brown
[48:29] never run out in this first Ministry you
[48:31] know I'm blessed God I'll take every
[48:32] Spirit here under my control
[48:34] I've seen people heard people say that
[48:37] you know it didn't amount to anything
[48:40] but see after a while he come to the
[48:42] place
[48:45] that when he said that
[48:47] he had every spirit in our under his
[48:49] control
[48:51] because he's tutored and trained and
[48:53] brought to the place right
[48:55] but you see now let's get what the
[48:57] prophet and I said don't try not to go
[48:59] up to Matthew 17. don't try to go there
[49:01] as much in your mind and thinking just
[49:04] kind of hold into the life of Jesus and
[49:07] understand that like I said this morning
[49:09] that
[49:10] from the time he started on the River
[49:13] Jordan as we call it there's something
[49:15] like three years before you come up to a
[49:17] mount of transfiguration then there's
[49:18] only like five or six months from amount
[49:20] of transfiguration going on to Calvary
[49:22] all right so then he was in a tutorship
[49:25] for about three years
[49:28] under his ministry and things but what
[49:30] was taking place
[49:32] sick was being healed debt was being
[49:34] raised
[49:35] do you read and let's say a moment ago
[49:38] do you read that when he went to Calvary
[49:40] when he went to Pilot and them when
[49:42] those people were beating him
[49:44] did he just say
[49:47] and they're killed
[49:51] now that didn't happen
[49:54] and it happened we wouldn't be here
[49:59] it looked like he was in another defeat
[50:04] causing being healed the dead being
[50:06] raised and always taking place back here
[50:09] during the time of his tutorship
[50:12] I can't get away from that because see
[50:14] people keep saying well over 40 years
[50:16] ain't nothing been going on I I differ
[50:18] with you 100 a thousand if I could say
[50:21] it or a million
[50:23] because I got all the Bible and the
[50:25] prophet to stand behind me to say it on
[50:27] look at brother random in his early
[50:29] ministry as I said a moment ago
[50:31] heal death rage and things but then when
[50:33] he gets to his
[50:35] amount of transfiguration experience
[50:38] which will place that as much as we can
[50:41] which I believe was when he went so they
[50:43] met the Angels out there and come
[50:45] forward for the seals you could bring
[50:46] forth because we'll proved it with the
[50:48] Bible all right all right but look at
[50:51] the time before then
[50:54] in the 30-something years he was
[50:56] preaching before he comes to the opening
[50:58] of the seals the Earth where the dead
[51:00] was raised the sick was healed Etc of
[51:03] great Mass numbers
[51:05] but when he comes to the opening of the
[51:07] word it seems like it's smaller amount
[51:10] of numbers right
[51:12] right
[51:14] we look at it and thinking ought to be
[51:17] reversed
[51:18] but that's our car of conception that's
[51:21] right
[51:22] but he knew the will of the father and
[51:25] he only done what the father said that's
[51:27] why Jesus when he got up there he never
[51:28] spoke no more amen very little is said
[51:31] from the time he left the Mount of
[51:33] transfiguration
[51:34] Calvary
[51:37] study your Bible very little is said
[51:40] to leave and come to the place you know
[51:42] he wouldn't even open his mouth
[51:44] man
[51:46] one because your father said don't do it
[51:51] in the garden he had yielded himself to
[51:53] where he was under complete obedience
[51:58] and the father never said a word so it
[52:00] wasn't spoken
[52:02] do we look at things and try to get it
[52:03] into some super
[52:06] place that we can't never Attain
[52:09] oh
[52:12] you can bring it down to the Simplicity
[52:14] of life but don't make it so simple
[52:15] until it's like we just fall into it you
[52:17] know it just
[52:19] people are here like I told you the
[52:20] other day
[52:21] people say that I am up here right there
[52:24] at brutally kindness I'm right there
[52:27] because that's the age I was born in
[52:30] um I don't give you brotherly connish
[52:32] that's no more than Philadelphia Thunder
[52:34] this guy
[52:36] because that's what the word
[52:37] Philadelphia means brotherly kindness or
[52:39] brotherly love
[52:40] you go up there and walk down the
[52:42] streets and you have to keep your money
[52:43] in your front pocket
[52:45] and too much brotherly kindness
[52:48] right but now listen
[52:51] let's just read something the prophet
[52:53] said it'll take it kind of an overview
[52:55] then we're going to drop back
[52:59] it's kind of like a view of looking at
[53:01] it then we're going to drop back
[53:04] and then we're going to to be in
[53:07] discovering things about us all right
[53:08] this is from the message hearing him and
[53:11] I would invite you to you've got an
[53:12] opportunity
[53:14] you don't have to study for a sermon
[53:16] you've got an opportunity I don't know
[53:19] really how many message they are called
[53:21] here you him just on that title so you
[53:24] got an opportunity to click on your
[53:25] computer run it up and listen to hear
[53:27] you him for 24 hours a day
[53:30] for quite a while
[53:32] did it take you to listen I don't want
[53:34] to hear you him
[53:35] and I'd invite you to do that then go to
[53:37] the adoption go to Blasphemous name go
[53:40] to the Statue of a perfect man
[53:43] we'll reach up some blasphemians names
[53:44] the Lord will we get time
[53:47] well look what the prophet said here he
[53:49] him 1957 5 19 the the a part of it now I
[53:53] want you to notice what a beautiful
[53:54] thing when this son was adopted
[53:57] the ceremony was said and the people
[53:58] stood by to witness
[54:00] then that father adopting that son into
[54:02] his own family to which he was born now
[54:05] see you're born when you are born again
[54:09] in the spirit of God
[54:11] then you are a doctor who placed into
[54:13] the body of Christ's position see you're
[54:15] born again and then adopted or
[54:18] positionally placed
[54:20] into
[54:21] Christ's positionally and with the this
[54:25] adoption taking place that boy's name
[54:27] was just as good on the check as his
[54:30] daddy's was right
[54:32] all right now that's a place to be
[54:34] reached
[54:36] all right
[54:38] you know we go through life and we
[54:43] you know
[54:45] you can put on your checkbook
[54:48] you know you go down and you give the
[54:50] permission and you put your children's
[54:52] okay on there for them to sign a check
[54:54] right
[54:56] but you see it's because you give them
[54:58] the authority
[55:00] um
[55:01] you've given the authority
[55:04] all right now watch as we go along I
[55:06] remember Miss cash Jesus back then he
[55:10] just didn't do it but miss cash would
[55:11] would sign Hermann cash by mayor Sherman
[55:14] cash you know the bank of I say
[55:16] they wouldn't do it today wouldn't it
[55:18] because her name went on anywhere to
[55:20] write a check they had to have trouble
[55:22] when when Mr Cash passed away to get
[55:24] everything clear because her name wasn't
[55:25] over I went away but you see it was
[55:29] giving permission is the point
[55:32] when a child of God is Born Into the
[55:35] family
[55:36] of God
[55:38] it has certain rights and and things
[55:42] but when the adoption comes
[55:45] it will come to where that their name is
[55:47] as good on a checkbook
[55:51] as the father all right but before we
[55:54] can come to that position you read all
[55:56] these things going down to number two
[55:58] and you'll see
[56:00] thank you
[56:02] well actually takes place when we
[56:04] receive the new birth
[56:05] it's just a message Jesus Christ the
[56:07] same 1955 603 anything that was included
[56:11] in the atonement is the personal
[56:12] property of every believer
[56:15] I love that
[56:17] when a man gets saved or a woman boy
[56:19] girl God gives them a checkbook
[56:22] as it was
[56:24] Jesus's name at the bottom of every
[56:26] check for anything Redemptive blessing
[56:29] that for anything Redemptive blessing
[56:31] that Jesus died for it's your personal
[56:34] property don't be afraid to fill it out
[56:36] the bank of heaven will recognize you
[56:38] all right I say brother dick would get
[56:41] up you know
[56:43] and he would take and say okay now I'm
[56:46] going to pass out checks today
[56:48] well he could take checks and pull them
[56:50] out and it's just a girl said to leave
[56:51] your money alone
[56:53] but he could pass out checks to
[56:55] everybody in the building right
[56:58] nobody can't cash it right that's right
[57:03] well what if he signed his name at the
[57:05] bottom
[57:07] my wife will tell me sometimes we're
[57:09] starting to go to the bank you know the
[57:10] deposit she's sitting here she gets the
[57:12] things I'm going to deposit he says here
[57:14] go ahead and sign a chance I said no I'm
[57:15] not going to sound like that guy
[57:20] you know what I can have a wreck and you
[57:23] know what anybody coming along could
[57:25] reach in there in my pocket and get the
[57:26] check and go around what they want to do
[57:28] wouldn't do very good but you know it
[57:31] probably got a little rubber in it if it
[57:33] got very big but the point is don't sign
[57:36] the check till you get ready to lay it
[57:38] down at the bank
[57:39] you give somebody a check you just
[57:42] remember
[57:43] you're gambling
[57:46] this is truthful he's all my children I
[57:49] trust them well all right
[57:52] there's a lot of children I wouldn't
[57:54] trust
[57:55] all right
[57:59] you know what I mean just be sensible
[58:00] all right but you see when you're a
[58:03] Christian God don't worry about you
[58:06] where are you gonna write a bad check or
[58:07] not that's right amen
[58:09] all right and here's what Rhoda Brandon
[58:13] would say why ask for a little thing
[58:16] he said ask for the windows of Heaven to
[58:19] be open and poured out upon you all
[58:22] right ma'am
[58:27] what you understand see
[58:29] and don't worry about it like the father
[58:31] said one time said and brother Brown
[58:34] actually said it said God would bankrupt
[58:37] heaven
[58:39] and the streets are paid with gold so it
[58:42] take quite a while but he'd bankrupt
[58:44] heaven
[58:45] to back up a check and he told you that
[58:48] you could sign
[58:49] that when you become a Christian
[58:52] when you become a babe in Christ
[58:54] God gives you the right to use his name
[58:57] he signs his name to the bottom all you
[59:00] got to do is fill out what you want I
[59:01] need healing
[59:04] I need Deliverance
[59:06] whatever you sign let me put on there he
[59:10] found it down here
[59:13] that's what he does for you when you're
[59:14] a baby in Christ
[59:16] he gives you a checkbook because he
[59:18] knows he can trust you that you're not
[59:20] going even though you're a baby
[59:22] you may do things wrong and mess up but
[59:25] still he knows he can
[59:27] you know he gives it right to you
[59:30] because the Bible even says he'll give
[59:32] you the desires your heart
[59:34] you know what they done by getting their
[59:36] desires their heart
[59:37] you remember the Old Testament they got
[59:39] their desires of their heart they wanted
[59:41] me you know what happened well they had
[59:43] to meet in their teeth God come down and
[59:45] destroyed like twenty thousand of them
[59:46] or something because they're mermaid
[59:48] didn't complaining so be careful about
[59:49] what you're doing but see God gives that
[59:52] right to it so now I gave you a few more
[59:53] uh you know
[59:55] ways to run around saying it which is
[59:58] Jehovah Jireh 1961 209 that's quite a
[1:00:01] little off the top of the earth that's
[1:00:02] what it is
[1:00:03] when God Saves a man he gives him a
[1:00:05] whole big checkbook
[1:00:07] now at the bottom it's got everything
[1:00:09] the name of Jesus wrote on it at the
[1:00:11] bottom of the checkbook whatever you ask
[1:00:13] in my name that will I do
[1:00:16] right Abraham C believes that just fill
[1:00:20] out your check and send it in the
[1:00:21] deposits already made it's in the bank
[1:00:24] he goes on to say don't be afraid to
[1:00:27] write the check the bank will pay it off
[1:00:31] don't be afraid to write a check
[1:00:33] don't be afraid to ask God for healing
[1:00:38] see now we go in and we keep a balance
[1:00:41] because the Bible said don't ask a Miss
[1:00:42] to consume and consume it up on our own
[1:00:45] Lush that's right we'll see any
[1:00:47] Christians shouldn't be wanting to do
[1:00:48] that
[1:00:49] that's right I want my daily bread
[1:00:52] I don't want bread for tomorrow
[1:00:55] it gets stale
[1:00:59] I want my daily bread
[1:01:02] but you know I've never seen the time
[1:01:04] that
[1:01:05] he didn't Supply how about you all right
[1:01:09] so he says the bank don't worry about
[1:01:10] your bank will pay it off
[1:01:14] he talks about a ceremony and you know
[1:01:16] and taking him out into the public
[1:01:20] that's going to hear you him number four
[1:01:21] you know 1960 so I'm trying to move up
[1:01:24] just for her now once 806.
[1:01:27] he takes them out a certain ceremony as
[1:01:29] hell for the boys boy taken out of the
[1:01:31] public Fire and Put on a certain Royal
[1:01:32] rope now he's coming to the adoption
[1:01:34] right
[1:01:35] and they performed the father did
[1:01:37] perform the performance of adoption and
[1:01:40] he adopted his own son that he had
[1:01:43] mourned and when you receive the Holy
[1:01:45] Ghost that's one thing you're born but
[1:01:48] now for the ceremony of adoption then he
[1:01:52] adopted his boy into his family and they
[1:01:55] had a ceremony
[1:01:57] and if they'd write checks in other
[1:01:59] words if that's the way they done it
[1:02:00] back then which we know they didn't
[1:02:02] anything that the boy did
[1:02:04] was just as good his name was just as
[1:02:07] good on the check as his father's after
[1:02:09] that adoption
[1:02:15] he was Heir after the adoption
[1:02:18] Galatians says he's no different see
[1:02:20] though he bees
[1:02:23] Lord of all
[1:02:25] huh so my point is now trying to just
[1:02:28] get right in here and stay in this place
[1:02:32] with me Nora
[1:02:34] stay in the place between the point of
[1:02:36] where that we have got the
[1:02:39] checkbook
[1:02:41] with Jesus's name
[1:02:43] written on the checkbook and we fill out
[1:02:46] what we need
[1:02:47] and a certain position
[1:02:51] the to were that it would come to a
[1:02:55] place that when this adoption is
[1:02:57] completed in the manifestation of the
[1:03:00] sons of God or the recognition stage of
[1:03:03] adoption
[1:03:05] then we don't have to let him sign his
[1:03:07] name
[1:03:10] until we start out ask anything in my
[1:03:12] name that's scripture
[1:03:15] so we ask it in his name
[1:03:19] and see then it's written down
[1:03:22] huh
[1:03:23] now
[1:03:24] then we can write a check sign our own
[1:03:28] name
[1:03:29] he said not the head checks in other
[1:03:31] words now you know what he goes on to
[1:03:32] explain I may not have it in here but
[1:03:34] you know what he said what happened back
[1:03:36] in those days he said they had a ring
[1:03:40] and they had like a wax thing and you
[1:03:43] would go in you know to do and you just
[1:03:44] stuck your hand down and that ring made
[1:03:47] an imprint that was made your father was
[1:03:50] okay in you to be able to use that
[1:03:53] see all right
[1:03:55] so but now let's stay in between that
[1:03:57] because
[1:03:59] if we don't we'll move I bleed too fast
[1:04:03] and that we will jump up into trying to
[1:04:05] look at something that's a way out there
[1:04:08] that makes it to where we can't reach it
[1:04:11] now let's move a little bit at the time
[1:04:13] and just understand
[1:04:18] because there to me is the most
[1:04:20] important part of the journey
[1:04:24] the finality of
[1:04:31] and all of what we're looking for yes
[1:04:37] but I believe the biggest part of our
[1:04:39] journey is taking place right now right
[1:04:43] this is where we're learning the things
[1:04:48] this is where we're learning the nature
[1:04:51] of the father
[1:04:53] because you're not going to give the
[1:04:55] Signet or checkbook
[1:04:58] to an unworthy child
[1:05:02] right
[1:05:04] they'll go squander it that's what
[1:05:06] happens to people
[1:05:08] that's why brother Ernie told us and
[1:05:10] very wisely he said don't send those
[1:05:12] people over in those foreign countries a
[1:05:14] large amount of money
[1:05:15] they don't know what to do with it
[1:05:20] he said they'll just go out and buy
[1:05:22] everything
[1:05:23] he said send them what they have need of
[1:05:27] and said they'll learn to use it well
[1:05:31] wise decision
[1:05:33] you know what I'm talking about
[1:05:36] people win the lottery
[1:05:38] and they get a million dollars or
[1:05:41] something all right and then just go
[1:05:43] squander it
[1:05:44] but we're talking last night and
[1:05:45] Terrence what we're talking about a
[1:05:47] neighbor over there that won the lottery
[1:05:48] and bought a home just passed us now 250
[1:05:51] 000 house or whatever they gave close to
[1:05:53] that out of a 500 000 Lottery which she
[1:05:57] probably wind up getting 350 000 after
[1:05:58] paying taxes maybe I don't know the run
[1:06:00] but anyhow
[1:06:02] and they got motorcycles they got trucks
[1:06:04] coming in with furniture and they lived
[1:06:06] in a
[1:06:07] Danny could tell you all about it but
[1:06:10] I don't know where they live but she's a
[1:06:14] cook over there and a little cafe
[1:06:16] all right and they won this Lottery well
[1:06:18] they just you know just like Derek said
[1:06:20] they said well you need it that way here
[1:06:21] and I'll just give you a thousand
[1:06:22] dollars because they don't know what to
[1:06:24] do with it
[1:06:25] Go free anyway
[1:06:27] didn't work put it in the bank if you
[1:06:29] weren't put in the bank you'll be a
[1:06:31] little easier about riding out
[1:06:33] right Cody got to work put more back
[1:06:37] but when it's just locked on you man
[1:06:39] well that's the way God does God doesn't
[1:06:41] love it on us
[1:06:43] right right
[1:06:45] he gives it according to what we can
[1:06:48] handle
[1:06:51] and that's maybe that's my problem
[1:06:53] he knows I can't handle it she just
[1:06:56] giving me a little bit of once in a
[1:06:58] while but still I thank God he's my
[1:07:00] daddy and he gives it to me you know but
[1:07:03] see people couldn't stand it
[1:07:06] give some people the authority of
[1:07:09] preaching the gospel or a pastor of a
[1:07:11] church and what would they do with it
[1:07:14] exactly right
[1:07:17] like my wife never always saying if
[1:07:19] Richard says it and she said she said if
[1:07:22] I Pastor up there I said do I would I'd
[1:07:24] done run everybody off so that's what
[1:07:26] she said and that's what Richard says
[1:07:29] you're arguing them too about it you
[1:07:32] know I said that's why you're not Pastor
[1:07:36] smash for a good reason
[1:07:38] so you know we're not here to run
[1:07:40] everything oh we're here to try to
[1:07:42] instruct right right amen bless God if
[1:07:45] you don't believe it forget it well
[1:07:47] bless God I remember when you didn't
[1:07:49] believe it now here's the problem I'm
[1:07:51] too old folks
[1:07:53] I've had people right here to come and
[1:07:55] say boy I tell you I don't understand
[1:07:56] why that brother didn't understand that
[1:07:58] what a baptism I the first time I heard
[1:08:00] it I've done it
[1:08:05] I can remember the day I started talking
[1:08:07] to you two years later you finally got
[1:08:10] baptized
[1:08:14] all right
[1:08:16] but you see we all think we're just
[1:08:18] super duper
[1:08:20] so that throws it away to a word that
[1:08:22] the real thing
[1:08:23] God can't trust people like that
[1:08:27] and he has to bring as we were bringing
[1:08:29] this morning what heartaches and
[1:08:31] troubles and trials
[1:08:34] what to do to build his nature into us
[1:08:38] or better than ever look back at he just
[1:08:41] flooded with things yeah and we'd be a
[1:08:44] bunch of spoiled brats
[1:08:47] right
[1:08:49] that's right so he doesn't do it
[1:08:52] but in your early night everybody ought
[1:08:54] to relate to this let's see if you can
[1:08:56] or any part of your Christian Journey
[1:08:59] you're bathing Christ right
[1:09:01] you'd ask God for something he'd just
[1:09:04] come do it you remember that you
[1:09:06] remember when you first got saved
[1:09:08] I mean I heard for maybe a year or
[1:09:10] something like that six months to the
[1:09:12] year it was just like you know you were
[1:09:13] just living on a a world this there was
[1:09:17] nothing could bother you and something
[1:09:19] would go wrong you just said oh that's
[1:09:21] just a trial my Daddy's doing that you
[1:09:24] know he he just he's doing these things
[1:09:27] for my benefit
[1:09:29] about a year later I wonder what went
[1:09:31] wrong
[1:09:35] see
[1:09:36] he just floods us when we first get born
[1:09:39] again amen he just Pampers us
[1:09:43] gives it to us
[1:09:45] and then we turn around one day and we
[1:09:47] say
[1:09:48] father I need so-and-so
[1:09:51] you don't say it fine
[1:09:54] what did they've talked before two weeks
[1:09:56] before you asked yourself yes son I'll
[1:09:58] give it to you
[1:10:00] then you ask him one day and you just
[1:10:02] don't hear nothing
[1:10:03] can you relate to this thing amen
[1:10:06] and you asked him and you ask him and
[1:10:08] your father you even begging you've
[1:10:10] never done that lady I know I know you
[1:10:13] never begged me
[1:10:15] he's actually dead
[1:10:22] say one time he said
[1:10:24] if God tells me no he said that's just
[1:10:27] as good as yes
[1:10:30] boy that didn't suit my old ways of
[1:10:33] thinking what about you
[1:10:35] but he said
[1:10:36] if he says no
[1:10:38] that means he's right
[1:10:42] I don't need it
[1:10:44] well Lord I need this after the other
[1:10:47] you said you can't handle it
[1:10:50] and I know hope by the time she's 10
[1:10:52] years old she said Daddy I need a car
[1:10:56] uh what kind of car are you going to
[1:10:57] give me
[1:11:01] you don't give no car
[1:11:04] you might have even bought her a car you
[1:11:06] know or you may do that with your kids
[1:11:07] that's your car
[1:11:08] but it sits under the shed or daddy
[1:11:10] drives it
[1:11:12] I want to drive it no no no no no a
[1:11:17] little more stipulation of this and that
[1:11:18] you know if you don't make good grades
[1:11:20] I'll take the car back
[1:11:23] oh now Daddy
[1:11:25] I didn't know we had stipulations on me
[1:11:29] yeah we have
[1:11:32] you understand you get the point of what
[1:11:35] I'm trying to say
[1:11:36] God in our early Christian Journey he
[1:11:39] just forced things on
[1:11:41] then he begins to seemingly back up
[1:11:47] where before we get down and pray and we
[1:11:49] could just feel this presence and just
[1:11:51] cry and worship and just
[1:11:53] and then we get down and pray and we
[1:11:55] even cry because we can't pray like we
[1:11:56] used to pray
[1:11:58] that we can't worship like we used to
[1:12:00] worship
[1:12:02] and we wonder as God left us
[1:12:05] that's child training
[1:12:09] right
[1:12:12] that's building his nature
[1:12:16] you know why because he went through it
[1:12:18] like that
[1:12:21] he said I do nothing until a father
[1:12:23] shows me don't you think he wanted to
[1:12:26] heal everybody save everybody deliver
[1:12:28] everybody whatever don't you think so
[1:12:30] but he couldn't do it
[1:12:32] do you understand
[1:12:34] okay
[1:12:37] but listen
[1:12:40] get to the place
[1:12:43] that we can realize
[1:12:46] that our child's training period is a
[1:12:48] great
[1:12:49] part of our life
[1:12:54] we went around looked at some land one
[1:12:55] day and
[1:12:56] we're Beyond us there and
[1:12:58] the guy that had it for sale or whatever
[1:13:00] it was came out there and he had no
[1:13:02] Shaggy her hanging down in his own home
[1:13:05] looking iffy looking thing you know
[1:13:09] we got in the car and started back
[1:13:10] around the road and this ain't been just
[1:13:12] a few years ago maybe 10 I get we
[1:13:15] started back around the road and Terence
[1:13:16] looked over at him and he said yeah
[1:13:20] I'm glad you just don't look like that
[1:13:27] I'm glad I don't too
[1:13:30] what do you mean he said what I'm going
[1:13:33] to look like that if you did because it
[1:13:34] won't look Nike
[1:13:36] well that made a lot of change you know
[1:13:37] a lot of talk
[1:13:42] we talk about our children following in
[1:13:44] our footsteps you know and wondering why
[1:13:45] they're stumbling and fall and come find
[1:13:47] out we're the ones are making the
[1:13:49] footsteps the wrong place
[1:13:51] but you understand what I'm trying to
[1:13:52] get to a place
[1:13:55] I mean we can talk about the adoptions
[1:14:01] we can talk about the things that we're
[1:14:04] looking forward to
[1:14:06] but just remember
[1:14:09] the prophet said as we read that last
[1:14:11] one there
[1:14:17] when you're born then you have the
[1:14:20] ceremony
[1:14:22] when you have a ceremony then your name
[1:14:25] is as good on the checkbook
[1:14:28] it's not as good on the checkbook when
[1:14:30] you're young you know starting your
[1:14:32] Christian Journey
[1:14:36] right
[1:14:38] it's when you come to the place that the
[1:14:40] father can trust you
[1:14:44] now I gave you a lot of quotes which
[1:14:45] would be useful in the next two or three
[1:14:47] messages
[1:14:49] but see look at down at number five says
[1:14:52] here you hymn 1960.
[1:14:55] 806. well that's where and that's just
[1:14:58] the continuation of the reading of
[1:14:59] number four okay
[1:15:00] well that's where the church needs to be
[1:15:03] tonight it needs to be to a place that
[1:15:05] God will call you off from work and
[1:15:07] through his glory over you spread his
[1:15:10] power upon you adopt you and place you
[1:15:13] glory into the body where when you speak
[1:15:16] something happens that's what the church
[1:15:19] is needing tonight sure we need that
[1:15:23] and I'm looking forward to that
[1:15:27] but it's just like I've told you many
[1:15:28] times that when I first come into the
[1:15:30] message
[1:15:31] the statements back then were
[1:15:34] one of these days will speak the word
[1:15:38] I made the statement then I still make
[1:15:40] it now
[1:15:41] unless you gotta have it before you can
[1:15:43] speak it
[1:15:46] oh you just being sarcastic that
[1:15:48] wouldn't be as sarcastically being
[1:15:49] truthful
[1:15:52] because see I was looking at things like
[1:15:54] this
[1:15:56] that there's a time going to come sure
[1:15:58] that he can
[1:16:00] trust us
[1:16:03] that he can allow us to write the check
[1:16:04] and to write our name to it
[1:16:07] was all tied together in your Christian
[1:16:09] journey I like to emphasize things
[1:16:12] through your understanding in mind
[1:16:14] when brother Brandon was speaking to
[1:16:16] Sister Hattie Wright
[1:16:19] have you really read that story
[1:16:23] when he was talking to Sister Hattie
[1:16:25] Wright
[1:16:26] he said you say
[1:16:28] you know whatever you say I'll speak it
[1:16:30] behind you
[1:16:35] he said she couldn't
[1:16:37] exactly catch it
[1:16:41] now what did he say
[1:16:45] you go read it
[1:16:46] he said sister Hattie Wright or sister
[1:16:50] he said that's that's saith the Lord
[1:16:56] she called it
[1:16:58] you know what because she'd seen him say
[1:17:00] thus saith the Lord and seeing God
[1:17:03] healed and deliver
[1:17:05] y see she needed a little something to
[1:17:07] help her to believe it
[1:17:09] because this time he was not placing
[1:17:11] upon thus saith the Lord because now
[1:17:13] remember when you say thus saith the
[1:17:16] Lord when brother Brown would say it
[1:17:17] when any Prophet says thus saith the
[1:17:19] Lord you know that's not that Prophet
[1:17:20] talking
[1:17:23] now come on
[1:17:25] right
[1:17:27] if I if I said now now brother dick I
[1:17:30] want to tell you something this is what
[1:17:32] brother Cauley told me to go tell you
[1:17:34] well that's not my word
[1:17:37] that's for the college word thus saith
[1:17:40] the Lord is when the Lord is
[1:17:43] speaking it
[1:17:45] but yet it's coming through your lips as
[1:17:47] from him and this is what God says
[1:17:51] but it come to a day when the prophet of
[1:17:54] God said you don't have to save us saith
[1:17:56] the Lord because it's the Lord speaking
[1:17:58] it
[1:18:01] Chief sister had it right couldn't catch
[1:18:03] that
[1:18:04] you couldn't catch it when brother Brown
[1:18:06] said you say it I'll say it behind you
[1:18:12] I think
[1:18:15] but he said sister that's thus saith the
[1:18:18] Lord
[1:18:20] she knew it then
[1:18:22] she believed it and she got the
[1:18:23] salvation of her sons
[1:18:27] and that's where all of everybody goes
[1:18:29] and do
[1:18:31] years ago they backslid
[1:18:33] what I heard
[1:18:36] they had nothing to do with it because
[1:18:39] done been saying amen amen
[1:18:43] you're still a bit sad that's right
[1:18:45] brother all right they may have a hard
[1:18:46] Road or whatever to take place but it's
[1:18:48] not been said
[1:18:50] because you can't deny it all right but
[1:18:53] now listen
[1:18:58] so just think about it let's see I'm
[1:19:00] trying to just jump down now so you take
[1:19:02] these home where you bring back we'll
[1:19:03] get on to a Wednesday a little bit
[1:19:05] and I'm trying to drop down to
[1:19:07] Blasphemous names it's number nine on
[1:19:09] your notes because I want to tie it
[1:19:10] together with
[1:19:14] this there's some quotes in between
[1:19:16] there
[1:19:17] that word that is speaking of the fact
[1:19:20] of how the child can that you you have
[1:19:23] the right to use Jesus's name
[1:19:26] pretty signs a check
[1:19:29] right but then it comes the time to work
[1:19:33] you sign the check
[1:19:37] right
[1:19:39] but you see that's your adoption
[1:19:43] that's your headstone
[1:19:46] adoption
[1:19:49] that's the part of adoption when God
[1:19:51] comes down and unites with the
[1:19:53] individual
[1:19:55] and I'll get to that
[1:19:57] that's not just a part of your journey
[1:20:00] that's getting into the climax of your
[1:20:03] journey
[1:20:04] Jesus never had a matter of
[1:20:06] transfiguration experience when he first
[1:20:08] started he had a river Jordan experience
[1:20:11] then three years later he had amount of
[1:20:13] transfiguration experience
[1:20:15] place it correctly
[1:20:20] see we we come in as babies and we we
[1:20:23] get into it and we read a little bit
[1:20:24] about what the prophet said and said oh
[1:20:26] look at that my name just as good as his
[1:20:28] is
[1:20:29] I've been around and heard these
[1:20:33] more blessed God we just speak the word
[1:20:37] what
[1:20:42] all these predictions all these dates
[1:20:45] and times and times
[1:20:46] Lord told me
[1:20:49] well now the Bible says kill him
[1:20:52] of course we don't want to be that way
[1:20:53] do we
[1:20:54] and we're not
[1:20:55] well that's what the Bible we read it
[1:20:57] this morning
[1:20:59] Prophet crosses out of the line only
[1:21:01] supposed to be killed that's what
[1:21:02] they're doing with them back there you
[1:21:04] know what that done that done away with
[1:21:05] a lot of that blabbering
[1:21:09] but see instead of that we call them
[1:21:11] brothers
[1:21:12] and they make predictions and then they
[1:21:14] just make another one and that don't
[1:21:16] happen they just make another one and
[1:21:17] all of it is thus that forward
[1:21:20] Lord told me not be like ain't right
[1:21:23] this time
[1:21:26] that's their business
[1:21:28] that's there to draw off people
[1:21:32] I started to try you to see what you're
[1:21:34] going to do about it
[1:21:36] all right
[1:21:37] what you see
[1:21:40] that has a specific position
[1:21:43] of authority that we'll cover later
[1:21:47] but when you come to word that your
[1:21:49] adoption is the point of Jesus Christ
[1:21:52] adoption on Mount Transfiguration
[1:21:57] that comes the headstone that comes to
[1:21:59] those things but let's just stick where
[1:22:00] we're at here's blasphemian's name
[1:22:02] number nine on your nose
[1:22:03] 62 1104 in the morning service do you
[1:22:06] remember over the Book of Matthew the
[1:22:08] 17th chapter of the first verse and the
[1:22:10] first to the fifth verse Jesus on my
[1:22:13] Transfiguration you heard me hear ye him
[1:22:15] that sermon I just hear about a year ago
[1:22:18] preached that become so popular hear ye
[1:22:21] him the placing of a son in Ephesians 1
[1:22:24] 5. now watch Ephesians 1 5 we read
[1:22:29] now watch him he says the placing of a
[1:22:31] son in Ephesians 1 5 this is why I keep
[1:22:34] reading Ephesians 1 5. because Ephesians
[1:22:37] 1 5 says God has predestinated us unto
[1:22:39] adoption of sun
[1:22:41] that's for our day and time see a family
[1:22:43] when a son is born into it it's a son
[1:22:46] then but that son had tutors to raise it
[1:22:49] and if that son never did come to the to
[1:22:53] be the right kind of a son he never
[1:22:56] become heir
[1:22:58] but if he was the right son and the son
[1:23:01] that would obey his father then that son
[1:23:04] was adopted or placed positionally he'd
[1:23:06] become heir of what the father had and
[1:23:09] that's what God was doing on Mount
[1:23:10] Transfiguration when he took his own son
[1:23:13] after he had been given excuse after
[1:23:15] he'd been proven to be the right son see
[1:23:18] and Stuart had stood in Temptations He
[1:23:22] took him through all temptation
[1:23:24] he took him up on map Transfiguration
[1:23:26] and overshadowed him
[1:23:28] you know in the Old Testament they took
[1:23:30] a son dressed him in a nice pretty
[1:23:32] garment and set him out before the
[1:23:34] public and they had a ceremony of
[1:23:36] placing or we called it adopting and
[1:23:38] Galatians start
[1:23:40] I kind of think Paul refers to it as
[1:23:42] adopting Sons
[1:23:44] Now by placing a son ministers will
[1:23:46] understand the spiritual Bible read and
[1:23:49] Spiritual Bible readers placing this son
[1:23:51] in other words the son was a son when he
[1:23:54] was born
[1:23:55] now here's where you Pentecostal people
[1:23:57] made a mistake being born into the
[1:23:59] family by the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:24:00] but then we must be the right kind of
[1:24:03] children tutored by the right tutor
[1:24:06] going over
[1:24:09] still part of number nine because that
[1:24:10] line goes down
[1:24:13] Blasphemous names that was on page we
[1:24:17] started reading on page 23 went through
[1:24:19] into 20 renowned 24 coming out on the
[1:24:22] 25.
[1:24:24] and he tells you what they're doing but
[1:24:26] look down at the now in the Old
[1:24:28] Testament when that son would adopted
[1:24:30] her place into the family his name was
[1:24:32] just as good on the check as his daddy's
[1:24:34] was yes sir they didn't have a they had
[1:24:37] a ring in them days a sign Signet and
[1:24:41] they spit on it and brought around them
[1:24:42] does a spitz joke that was a Signet that
[1:24:45] was just a he wore his daddy's ring his
[1:24:48] his Signet and that was just as good as
[1:24:50] his daddy's now when Jesus had been or
[1:24:53] obedient
[1:24:55] Jesus to God God placed him positionally
[1:24:58] this is him
[1:25:00] now remember you're supposed to want you
[1:25:02] to get now now when the member is born
[1:25:06] by the Holy Spirit into the family of
[1:25:08] God and has proven to have these virtues
[1:25:13] Now read with me
[1:25:16] that God can see virtue knowledge
[1:25:19] Temperance patient brotherly kindness
[1:25:20] and godliness in him then God seals him
[1:25:23] or places him and that there that's when
[1:25:27] you see the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:25:31] so
[1:25:33] when these virtues are in US
[1:25:36] if the virtues are not dire what I'm
[1:25:39] trying to tell you know brought it all
[1:25:40] the time up and down to tell you to go
[1:25:41] to the Statue of perfect man study that
[1:25:43] because see we must have these things
[1:25:45] right
[1:25:47] and like Richard said that time he said
[1:25:49] I didn't know it until I came down here
[1:25:50] that
[1:25:52] it's required and around the and
[1:25:54] statue of perfect man that's required
[1:25:56] that you and I have these things
[1:25:59] in this age it's required it's not a a
[1:26:02] well we make a choice no
[1:26:05] if we're going to make the change
[1:26:08] we got a choice we can go by the grave
[1:26:14] but if we're going to make the change of
[1:26:16] the body
[1:26:16] if we're going to finish this situation
[1:26:18] of adoption out
[1:26:20] then we must have faith virtue of
[1:26:22] knowledge temperature patience
[1:26:24] brotherly kindness
[1:26:27] and we must have the headstone which is
[1:26:30] love all right now we'll make a
[1:26:32] statement and then back off we won't say
[1:26:33] no more because you see that's why
[1:26:35] that's been waiting because your profit
[1:26:37] said the heads don't have to come yet
[1:26:42] now the disciples had these virtues
[1:26:45] but they didn't have a headstone
[1:26:48] so they wasn't positionally placed
[1:26:54] the disciples was not positionally
[1:26:56] adopted
[1:26:59] that's contrary to most people now
[1:27:01] you're gonna
[1:27:03] I'll probably get something back off the
[1:27:05] internet on that that's all right
[1:27:08] that's what your Prophet said
[1:27:11] see that's what everybody thinks
[1:27:15] as I read what he said he said
[1:27:16] Pentecostal people think well we just
[1:27:18] got everything when I got the Holy Ghost
[1:27:20] blessed God I got all these virtues in
[1:27:22] me
[1:27:25] I just preached a message and what being
[1:27:28] born again growing in Grace and
[1:27:30] knowledge and trying to tell you them
[1:27:31] things of how that we come to that
[1:27:34] how do we come to the Statue of a
[1:27:35] perfect man well I need virtue I was
[1:27:38] happy give me some of it when you get it
[1:27:41] if it's that easy to get you can give it
[1:27:43] to me
[1:27:44] now I'm not making a joke I'm making
[1:27:46] truth
[1:27:48] if it's that easy to get give me some of
[1:27:50] it
[1:27:51] you know
[1:27:54] what you see
[1:27:55] it's ever individual
[1:27:58] has to have these things right not just
[1:28:02] the preacher
[1:28:04] right if every member of the body of
[1:28:07] Christ must have these things before The
[1:28:10] Headstone can unite as a unit now you
[1:28:13] you're what I said unit which means the
[1:28:16] entire group
[1:28:18] individuals can have the headstone
[1:28:23] but one day it will be sealed as a unit
[1:28:26] then is when you're going to see the
[1:28:28] powers of God
[1:28:30] you say you're looking to the Future no
[1:28:31] I'm not I'm telling you what's going to
[1:28:33] happen
[1:28:35] what's taking place now
[1:28:37] because I believe
[1:28:41] I believe
[1:28:47] look around
[1:28:51] and how do we look around
[1:28:53] what do we say this morning how do you
[1:28:55] try false prophet
[1:28:58] by the word
[1:28:59] how do you look around to see who's
[1:29:01] right or wrong by the word
[1:29:04] create the condo priest
[1:29:07] doing all that
[1:29:10] it's not a state of the word
[1:29:12] so your Prophet says that when we have
[1:29:14] these virtues
[1:29:15] then we can come to a place to be
[1:29:18] adopted
[1:29:20] all right
[1:29:22] but you see it in the meantime we're in
[1:29:25] that Journey
[1:29:26] right I didn't get my notes where I
[1:29:28] wanted that's all right we're in the
[1:29:30] Journey of a Christian
[1:29:33] we've been in a journey of a Christian
[1:29:36] for all these years
[1:29:38] it's taken all of these years to bring
[1:29:40] it to the place that we could talk about
[1:29:42] these things
[1:29:50] talking about something and preaching
[1:29:52] something that's entirely different to
[1:29:53] me I mean
[1:29:54] sorry about that when I mean talk about
[1:29:57] something I mean we can talk about it
[1:29:58] being in manifestation
[1:30:01] I'm not talking just jabbery
[1:30:04] I mean that there is a people on the
[1:30:07] Earth today that I believe are standing
[1:30:09] in the place
[1:30:12] and listen folks brother Dale has never
[1:30:14] taught it and never will teach it to
[1:30:16] tell you where I'm at because it's none
[1:30:18] of your business where I'm at except for
[1:30:20] one thing
[1:30:22] you can draw from whatever you think it
[1:30:24] is
[1:30:26] it's trying to get you to find out where
[1:30:28] you're at
[1:30:31] if you find out where you're at I ain't
[1:30:34] worried about you find out where I'm at
[1:30:37] just find out where you're at but if you
[1:30:40] don't know where you're at it's like
[1:30:41] wave one time was following my father
[1:30:43] knees what let's see who would yeah
[1:30:45] pulling these boys down through the
[1:30:46] woods and and
[1:30:49] my brother-in-laws are always real good
[1:30:50] at directions and uh anyhow that got
[1:30:53] turned around
[1:30:54] and this little boy never been in the
[1:30:56] woods and and they're standing after my
[1:30:58] brother-in-law is trying to figure out
[1:30:59] where in the world he was at where did
[1:31:01] he get out you know wait said this
[1:31:03] little boy said I think it's right over
[1:31:05] that way
[1:31:06] and my brother-in-law he was like me
[1:31:08] just blunt what he said you know you
[1:31:10] know
[1:31:11] he looked at him he said you ain't never
[1:31:13] been in these woods and you trying to
[1:31:15] tell me how to get out yeah
[1:31:18] that's the way people are
[1:31:20] they know nothing about the gospel but
[1:31:23] yet they can tell you all about what
[1:31:25] it's supposed to be
[1:31:30] I swear I've always told you
[1:31:33] I've got one of my office there's one
[1:31:35] another Joe's office and probably two or
[1:31:38] three downstairs and I got three
[1:31:40] computers at the house but it's the most
[1:31:42] damaging thing that could ever happen to
[1:31:43] the people of this message but it's most
[1:31:45] wonderful thing to do because we can use
[1:31:48] it in a hurry to find what we're hunting
[1:31:50] but it's the most damaging cause you've
[1:31:52] got preachers young ones especially that
[1:31:53] is
[1:31:54] I got 200 quotes on that Wrecking order
[1:31:57] preaching if you've got one that don't
[1:31:59] sound right you better not
[1:32:02] hmm
[1:32:04] look after
[1:32:06] one
[1:32:08] that no God could be one word off
[1:32:14] did you hear me yes
[1:32:17] I didn't know that he'd be one word off
[1:32:21] I thought it would have to tie together
[1:32:23] now I know the prophet May slips of the
[1:32:26] tongues etc etc I know that
[1:32:29] so don't go that way
[1:32:32] just get to reality at one time
[1:32:34] we've had an opportunity to be able to
[1:32:36] hear God's word and gradually like I
[1:32:39] said the other day brother I'm talking
[1:32:40] about that cat eating that grinding
[1:32:41] stone
[1:32:43] I told you that cat eating that grinding
[1:32:46] stone you say it can't be done yes it
[1:32:47] can because when he touches that
[1:32:49] grinding stone one strain goes off of
[1:32:52] the grinding stone his tongues tore all
[1:32:54] the pieces but his tongue grow back
[1:32:57] and I had a while he can get two grains
[1:32:58] made a while he gets enough corns on his
[1:33:01] tongue until he can get four grains you
[1:33:02] know what's happening the grinding
[1:33:03] Stones going away
[1:33:07] it can be good
[1:33:11] to those that have stayed with the
[1:33:13] message there's an opportunity
[1:33:17] of coming to adoption
[1:33:21] but to those that run off after the
[1:33:23] flimsy flimsy little things of the
[1:33:25] people of the message in there there's
[1:33:27] no opportunity so you know what I'm not
[1:33:29] de-christianizing nobody never have
[1:33:31] never will
[1:33:32] they just have to go by the grave
[1:33:36] I've always told you if you don't know
[1:33:38] enough in the message to be able to
[1:33:41] straighten out
[1:33:43] by the message
[1:33:45] your marriage and divorce situation
[1:33:48] you're born by the grave
[1:33:50] me you always
[1:33:55] you say you yeah
[1:33:57] and you
[1:33:59] anybody here want to say they didn't
[1:34:01] ever kissed nobody
[1:34:05] according to your profit that's
[1:34:06] potential adultery
[1:34:09] I don't need the Grace Management boards
[1:34:11] bless God
[1:34:13] well what about the spiritual side where
[1:34:14] you were married to organize religion
[1:34:17] Curt about this Bible convert them to a
[1:34:19] Baptist Faith or a presbyterian
[1:34:25] I think we all need a lot of Grace
[1:34:28] but if you don't know the message enough
[1:34:31] to be able to free you from that where
[1:34:33] are you going
[1:34:37] marriage and divorce is one of the
[1:34:39] greatest messages or to be preached
[1:34:42] to everybody in this message to where
[1:34:44] they can make a choice
[1:34:46] because if they can't see it by
[1:34:49] spiritual Revelation for God to show
[1:34:51] them how it's straightened out
[1:34:54] they're going by the grave
[1:34:59] sorry
[1:35:01] I just tell the truth
[1:35:05] I try to tell it like it is the old
[1:35:07] saying knows
[1:35:09] there you go what do you see what I'm
[1:35:12] talking about
[1:35:13] we have had a wonderful opportunity for
[1:35:16] 40 years
[1:35:18] right here in this building
[1:35:21] to hear the word of God
[1:35:24] that has not been caught in no
[1:35:27] I stand Here Right today
[1:35:30] and you bring it and told me we've never
[1:35:32] been caught by any of these doctrines
[1:35:35] don't show me
[1:35:39] all the doctrines are the two Souls the
[1:35:41] seven Thunder virtue and all the Holy
[1:35:43] Ghost all the perus is all of the things
[1:35:45] we looked at them we studied them but we
[1:35:47] cast them out because it didn't fit the
[1:35:49] rest of the message
[1:35:50] amen maybe we have become exalted
[1:36:00] and going to take care of that
[1:36:05] because he knows how to whip his
[1:36:06] children
[1:36:08] you might accuse us of saying well you
[1:36:11] think you got it all no I don't think I
[1:36:13] got it all there's one thing about it I
[1:36:15] don't think I don't have anything
[1:36:18] I at least tried to make you available
[1:36:22] to where you could say you've got
[1:36:24] something
[1:36:25] by preaching the message to you
[1:36:29] because to me that's the only way you
[1:36:30] can get to virtue
[1:36:33] is to preaching of the Gospel
[1:36:37] I mean that's simple to me I don't I
[1:36:39] don't understand why people don't want
[1:36:40] to hear that
[1:36:42] I don't want them deep things I might
[1:36:44] get confused now
[1:36:47] like a brother said he said
[1:36:50] don't go down there and get confused
[1:36:53] he said what he really was saying don't
[1:36:55] go down there and find out you already
[1:36:57] confused
[1:37:00] that's the point let's Stand Together
[1:37:03] take on these things
[1:37:06] I believe we're in the most wonderful
[1:37:09] opportunity that had been ever given to
[1:37:11] mankind upon God's Earth
[1:37:14] that's my brother Randall said if I had
[1:37:15] any day in the Bible
[1:37:19] that is this what he said he said if I
[1:37:21] had my choice of any day in the Bible to
[1:37:24] be living on Earth what did he say
[1:37:27] he's not take this time
[1:37:30] he must have known something about this
[1:37:32] time
[1:37:33] he said it'd been great to have been
[1:37:35] there when Jesus was there it'd been
[1:37:36] great to been there when Moses and the
[1:37:38] partner of the Red Sea he said but this
[1:37:40] is the day
[1:37:41] the everything is dependent upon this
[1:37:44] day
[1:37:47] as I repeat again if we don't come to
[1:37:51] the place the bride of Christ around the
[1:37:52] world don't come to the place of this
[1:37:54] adoption to be finished in the point of
[1:37:56] the manifestation Sons and Daughters of
[1:37:58] God then there is no heaven to go to
[1:38:07] you see you shouldn't talk like that
[1:38:09] well
[1:38:10] God's word said
[1:38:15] who I don't have to worry about it
[1:38:18] left up to him take care of it amen oh
[1:38:20] he got rid of it
[1:38:23] 152 in the red book anybody having a
[1:38:25] orders open
[1:38:34] ing
[1:38:35] I hear not today with the moral
[1:38:40] maintenance
[1:38:46] Lord I know foreign
[1:39:52] baby
[1:39:56] in Jesus foreign
[1:41:09] because
[1:41:24] our Lord
[1:41:33] let's walk
[1:41:35] that will bring him here
[1:41:39] right here for the change comes
[1:41:42] right here is where we're going to be
[1:41:44] playing
[1:41:45] and while they're waiting on you and I
[1:41:52] know
[1:42:09] I'm ready
[1:42:24] foreign
[1:43:36] foreign
[1:44:48] foreign
[1:45:59] I think
[1:46:24] I'm in my face feel no alarm
[1:46:32] that's what I wanted to know brother
[1:46:34] Perry green said brother and told him
[1:46:36] said brother Pray when you're praying
[1:46:37] and talking to the father he said
[1:46:40] tell him I love him all right he wanted
[1:46:43] God to know that he loved him so when
[1:46:45] you're talking to the Lord just tell him
[1:46:47] say brother Dale said for me to tell you
[1:46:49] he loves you
[1:46:51] God I wanna I want him to do what's
[1:46:53] right in my life do you know what that
[1:46:56] does it takes a death to me but
[1:46:58] you know and sometimes death is hard
[1:47:00] isn't it we want to struggle we want to
[1:47:02] work and do amen we'd ask you for a few
[1:47:05] of the men if you would because we're
[1:47:06] going to try to take down brother Mark
[1:47:08] wants the tapes in the back room of
[1:47:10] brother Branham and all of the things
[1:47:12] brother Donnie's already said he put him
[1:47:14] in the back of his thing and Care at
[1:47:16] home for you so uh if a few of you will
[1:47:18] help we have a couple of drills and all
[1:47:20] we got to do is just take them but don't
[1:47:22] go down there and start getting nothing
[1:47:23] out of the rack now if I get there don't
[1:47:24] get there just just take the screws out
[1:47:27] and change it over and lay it down and
[1:47:29] then all he's got to do is just take him
[1:47:31] pick it up and stick it right back up
[1:47:32] the wall you don't have to remove no
[1:47:33] tapes it won't take just a little bit
[1:47:34] but we're trying to do and rearrange and
[1:47:37] we're really having to shift a lot of
[1:47:38] stuff so forgive us if Rachel and and uh
[1:47:43] Monica would make sure in their room
[1:47:46] that anything you know that you need to
[1:47:48] move around or do move it somewhere
[1:47:50] that's because we're the Little Women
[1:47:51] that's where we're going to be tomorrow
[1:47:52] paint and then and rearranging and doing
[1:47:55] and we thank God for Brother Gary He's
[1:47:58] come up and done a lot of work and doing
[1:48:00] to to do things and and it's a little
[1:48:02] more convenient to wear that Richard's
[1:48:05] on into the back room now with his
[1:48:06] taping things but now just remember that
[1:48:08] when he's in there between services and
[1:48:10] the things you know don't go kids don't
[1:48:13] go running through there he is going to
[1:48:14] lock the doors you know don't go running
[1:48:17] through that little Park you used to we
[1:48:19] left it to work for safety we can get
[1:48:21] out but it's still the word that you
[1:48:25] know Richard can be a little bit more
[1:48:27] private in what he's doing so remember
[1:48:29] that kids don't be trying to run through
[1:48:31] that back or the doors and all because
[1:48:34] he's going to be in there doing his work
[1:48:36] but if you will Monica and Rachel did
[1:48:38] anything you need to move to get it you
[1:48:41] know got to set it out if you don't
[1:48:43] we'll take it down tomorrow and move
[1:48:45] everything and we'll try to set
[1:48:46] everything where you can put it back up
[1:48:48] you know but we're trying to rearrange a
[1:48:50] lot of things make it more convenient I
[1:48:53] hope you went down and looked at the
[1:48:54] bathroom I think it looks real good and
[1:48:57] go into Richard's part over there that
[1:49:00] we've got him set up brother Gary has a
[1:49:02] few more solins than things to make but
[1:49:04] he'll have his own place to where he can
[1:49:06] do his tapes and this stuff in a little
[1:49:08] more private and what it is out there
[1:49:10] were you running backwards and forth so
[1:49:12] we don't have a whole lot to do with
[1:49:13] this whole building but we're trying
[1:49:15] trophy wheel for some of you men will
[1:49:17] just go down there and we've got a
[1:49:18] couple screwdrivers all you got to do is
[1:49:20] I sit now loosen the tapes and just take
[1:49:22] the whole rack and lay it down
[1:49:25] don't try to start taking the tape out
[1:49:27] of the rack
[1:49:27] there's a specific place for them each
[1:49:30] one and brother Mark wants to put him in
[1:49:33] his basement so all you got to do then
[1:49:34] is just put him aboard on the wall stick
[1:49:36] it up there and screw it up and he's got
[1:49:38] the whole message down there in his
[1:49:40] basement that he can work out and do it
[1:49:42] and listen to tapes and whatever he
[1:49:43] wants to do we appreciate everything
[1:49:45] that everybody does and all of the work
[1:49:48] and things that's done uh Nanny and and
[1:49:51] uh June and Rachel and Lisa and all for
[1:49:56] coming up and working like everything
[1:49:58] and getting the water out and getting
[1:49:59] everything you know to fix to where you
[1:50:01] could do it and just pray that that tile
[1:50:04] will just stay to the floor amen because
[1:50:06] most of you remember about 10 or 15 or
[1:50:09] not maybe it's been 30 years ago in
[1:50:11] early now
[1:50:12] that the guy over here left the water
[1:50:13] running and we had just put down brand
[1:50:16] new tops
[1:50:17] I'm talking about just a few weeks we
[1:50:19] had put down brand Utah to Dr Church
[1:50:22] and a heated water came dumped down
