[30:23] that just round the check for $100 okay

[30:30] you're going to take the dve Ramy course
[30:32] those of you that signed up we've got
[30:35] our kits ordered but what we have to do
[30:38] is is we have to do an online sign up
[30:41] and we let the other classes do it and
[30:43] some did it some you know kind of didn't
[30:46] know how to do it but Jim brought her
[30:48] computer and downstairs in the middle
[30:50] room there where we eat she's going to
[30:53] have the computer set up does not take
[30:55] more than 5 minutes if you don't get it
[30:56] all done so there's about 13 separate
[31:00] kits that we're buying so 13 people not
[31:03] 13 people but 13 couples plus you know
[31:06] some that are um that are single are
[31:08] going to take it so it may take a little
[31:09] bit of time and we may do some next
[31:11] Sunday but it's really important that
[31:13] you sign up and even June can get you
[31:16] the information on how to do it at home
[31:19] but we will start not this coming Sunday
[31:22] brother Tom Ern to be with us but we'll
[31:24] start the next one August the 5th at
[31:27] 5:00 so those of you who have not signed
[31:29] up please do if you want to take the
[31:32] course um I'm I'm just really
[31:35] anticipating this one because we have to
[31:38] open it to the we have to open it to
[31:41] everybody because of copyright
[31:44] infringements if we were to close it to
[31:46] just this church we would have to fill
[31:48] out a whole bunch of forms copyright
[31:50] forms and I don't know about paying a
[31:52] fee but if we'll leave it open to
[31:53] anybody and everybody but if somebody
[31:56] wants to come to this church if 5:00 on
[31:57] Sunday afternoon they're welcome to come
[32:00] all right so we've left it open but uh
[32:02] we are compiling there's over 800
[32:05] scriptures in the Bible about how we
[32:06] handle money and there's about 250
[32:10] quotes from The Prophet about money debt
[32:12] and investment the
[32:15] Prophet The Prophet talked about money
[32:19] you need anything go to the put put
[32:21] money in put debt in put something in
[32:23] and I'll promise you our Prophet covered
[32:26] it pretty well so just keep that in your
[32:28] mind also brother jul for will be here
[32:30] Wednesday looking forward to that and
[32:33] then next Sunday brother Tom Ernest and
[32:34] then you heard all the other ones
[32:35] will'll be announcing them along the way
[32:38] the brother that was here this morning
[32:40] he is from Delaware and I think his name
[32:43] is Brother Don or Dan Roberts and he is
[32:46] looking you need to keep him in your
[32:48] prayers he flew down here today or
[32:52] yesterday his wife found us on the
[32:53] internet told her told him to come here
[32:57] and he found the church and then
[32:59] tomorrow he's going for an interview now
[33:01] this afternoon he's going to look at
[33:02] houses so he's looking for an interview
[33:04] to move from Delaware to Georgia that's
[33:05] a good move I don't care if you come
[33:07] here with no
[33:08] job so no
[33:10] offense that's a good move
[33:13] anyway so but pray for him he has a job
[33:16] interview tomorrow a job interview
[33:19] tomorrow uh you know I told him I said
[33:21] brother I'm not going to tell you good
[33:22] luck cuz I don't believe in luck I
[33:23] believe in prayer all right I believe
[33:25] you make your own luck that's right all
[33:27] right so he's come down here though
[33:28] sincerely looking for a job in Norcross
[33:30] some kind of technical job that he does
[33:33] in Delaware but he's looking to relocate
[33:36] down here so let's just pray that that
[33:38] the Lord will open that up and he'll
[33:40] find him a place to stay and he'll find
[33:43] him a u a good job and find him a good
[33:45] church and he really enjoyed this
[33:48] morning and asked Dad for the tape so
[33:49] he's going to take it back I do not
[33:51] remember his pastor's name it's somebody
[33:53] in Hershey Pennsylvania but I I can't
[33:55] remember it starts with an F but it
[33:57] doesn't come to me but I I had never
[33:59] heard of him before but he is a message
[34:01] believer so he wasn't in the wrong place
[34:04] right A lot of times we have people come
[34:06] in and sit down that they know in a few
[34:07] minutes they're in the wrong place and
[34:09] they ease up and go back out to that
[34:10] church over there so U but he was a me
[34:13] he is a message believer so just keep
[34:15] him in your prayers and his wife may be
[34:17] watching in now so the Lord bless each
[34:19] and every one of you but let's turn to
[34:20] Revelations 20 and we're going to take a
[34:24] side a dig a little bit deeper in what
[34:26] brother Dale been speaking on as far as
[34:28] the book and we're going to title this
[34:31] today the book of
[34:35] books that book in Revelation 5 is not
[34:37] just a book of life of every person
[34:41] right
[34:43] right God didn't redeem every person
[34:46] that's right judas's name is not in that
[34:48] book that's right that book the one in
[34:50] Revelation 5 it's not in that book all
[34:52] right but we're going to read I'm going
[34:55] to break down the books for you
[34:57] show you how many they are and sections
[34:59] in them and I got a Little Help From My
[35:02] Buddy out in Oklahoma brother Claud may
[35:05] be listening bless his heart I love you
[35:07] but he U he gave me a few thoughts and
[35:09] ideas on on how to present this and and
[35:12] I really appreciate the support we need
[35:14] support we don't just get this you know
[35:16] from reading a a Sports magazine you
[35:19] know I mean we we we see these things
[35:21] and we listen and Faith does come by
[35:23] hearing it does not come by preaching it
[35:25] comes by hearing so we have to hear the
[35:27] word of God just like you do all right
[35:29] Revelations
[35:30] 20:2 let's bow our heads dear heavenly
[35:33] father we pray today Lord that you
[35:35] would stop time father that we get a
[35:39] point across that needs to be gotten
[35:40] across and that we'll all listen Lord
[35:42] and be attentative that you'll come down
[35:44] Lord among us and Quicken our hearts and
[35:46] our minds and and keep us Lord with our
[35:49] Focus straight on you father not on
[35:50] being sleepy or what we ate or what

[37:35] another book was open which was the book
[37:37] of life and the dead were judged out of
[37:39] those things which were written in the
[37:41] books according to their works now keep
[37:44] that in your mind and the Sea gave up
[37:46] the dead which were in and death and
[37:48] Hell delivered up the dead which were in
[37:51] them and they were judged every man
[37:52] according to their works that's the
[37:53] second time that said that and death and
[37:56] hell were cast into the Lake of Fire
[37:57] this is the second death and whosoever
[38:00] was not found written in the Book of
[38:01] Life was cast in to the Lake of Fire now
[38:06] let's go to job 19:
[38:09] 23 job cries out oh that my words were
[38:12] now
[38:15] written all that they were printed in a
[38:19] book you may be seated in the Lord add
[38:21] his Blessing to the reading of his word
[38:24] now let's get started we got a long way
[38:26] to go go short time to get
[38:29] there pull up the next one here are this
[38:34] I want you to keep this in mind cuz
[38:35] we're going to use this later on this is
[38:37] the strongs number
[38:39] 975 this is most of your new testament
[38:43] definition of a scroll now look what it
[38:45] is a small book a scroll a written
[38:48] document a sheet on which something has
[38:50] been written all right go to the next
[38:54] one strongs number 1697
[38:57] in the Bible this is what it says about
[39:00] a book it's called a speech word
[39:04] speaking it's actually a
[39:07] thing speech or saying or utterance you
[39:11] see the other ones but let's use you the
[39:12] ones for emphasis all right let's go to
[39:14] the next one PM number
[39:17] 5612 look what this one says now this is
[39:19] in the all in the Old Testament all
[39:21] right this was in the Hebrew number 5612
[39:24] anywhere you see it in the Old Testament
[39:26] it pretty much means a legal document
[39:29] certificate of divorce are a deed of
[39:31] purchase right a deed of purchase what
[39:35] are we talking about today Redemption
[39:36] we're trying to we're getting back to
[39:37] that book in Revelations 5 which is a
[39:40] deed of purchase or an indictment or a
[39:43] sign it's also a book or a scroll all
[39:48] right
[39:50] now what is this
[39:54] book it's a book of names
[39:58] and actions tied to those names
[40:01] right everybody understand amen right
[40:06] it's a not just a book of names right
[40:09] because you're not just identifyed when
[40:10] you say you're a person's
[40:12] name there's an identity there there's a
[40:15] there's a there's a definition an action
[40:18] what that person's known
[40:21] by right everybody's known by a
[40:24] different name but but I can call
[40:27] I don't want to call somebody's name but
[40:28] call my
[40:29] name I am definitely not
[40:32] shy I am not
[40:35] quiet okay well then what are you
[40:37] laughing
[40:38] for CU this what what that's what does
[40:41] not identify who I am but the other part
[40:44] identifies who me there's the book it's
[40:47] not just a book of names that's right
[40:49] it's a book of their actions and the
[40:52] motivations in your life because
[40:55] remember
[40:57] how many of you heard this your life is
[41:00] like an
[41:01] open
[41:03] right or I can read you like a
[41:07] b well what does that mean we're not
[41:10] talking about a book that you open up no
[41:13] your life is an open
[41:15] book a
[41:17] testimony a memorial or a
[41:20] manifestation right that's why Paul had
[41:23] to be changed from Saul to Paul the
[41:24] manifestation of Saul was
[41:26] an arrogant King back in the Old
[41:30] Testament that wouldn't fit Paul's
[41:33] character after he's born again all
[41:35] right now you and I the same
[41:38] way and we'll read in invisible Union a
[41:41] little bit
[41:42] later and prove some of that but see
[41:46] that is your there's not there there's
[41:48] not a book in the
[41:50] Bible that is recording a book of names
[41:54] of animals or of trees
[41:56] or of churches or benches you understand
[42:00] what I'm saying yes it's a book of human
[42:02] life right Souls right anything that's
[42:06] got a Soul's got a book attached to it
[42:10] right written Epistles right right amen
[42:13] that's right we're going to look and see
[42:15] where brother random said there was one
[42:16] group that's not aen
[42:19] above their life is
[42:21] recorded but they're not even included
[42:23] in this book that we're talking about
[42:25] right right and I want you to take this
[42:27] and put it in your cap for about an hour
[42:31] from now in Revelations
[42:35] 20 you're not in any of those books
[42:38] right if you're born again that's
[42:41] right it says book and it says books
[42:44] you're not included in that that's right
[42:46] right so that's why I want to call this
[42:49] sermon today the book of
[42:53] books the book of books may I I say the
[42:56] sublime book of books right
[42:59] amen so that book that that lamb took
[43:02] was not just a book of life right it was
[43:06] not special group of people Glory now
[43:11] listen let's go to Hebrews
[43:16] 10:7 then said I lo I come into the
[43:20] volume of the book it is written of me
[43:23] to do thy will oh God now what scripture
[43:25] is this body thou Hast prepared me what
[43:27] is is the Lord Jesus so the book is a
[43:30] person right right l i personal pronoun
[43:35] I come right parentheses to make to make
[43:39] it to make it what it's supposed to be
[43:41] in the volume of the book it is written
[43:43] of
[43:44] me making emphasis of where it's coming
[43:47] from right right in the volume of my
[43:50] life it is written of me to do what he
[43:54] was very specific to do thy will oh God
[43:57] right so that book is a person right
[44:00] Glory it's not just a piece of paper
[44:03] right it's a book of human life
[44:07] Souls also the book is a word judgment
[44:11] comes from the book
[44:13] right right
[44:15] right but there's only one book
[44:19] amen because I just said the book is a
[44:21] word right yes yeah if you got two
[44:25] books you got two
[44:27] words
[44:28] M thought of that right you got two
[44:32] books you got two words you can't be
[44:35] judged that's being double minded God's
[44:37] not double minded he's got one book
[44:40] that's right that you going to be judged
[44:42] out of not two books but there just as
[44:44] there are the Bible with 66 chapters in
[44:46] The Bible but that's one book right
[44:49] there's 66 sections that make up that
[44:51] bible all right there's sections we're
[44:54] going to break those sections down real
[44:56] quick and then we're going to get to
[44:59] what we want to read but if you got two
[45:01] books remember that you got two words
[45:03] that's right but now this book has
[45:05] several sections right I read the Bible
[45:10] a siner reads the Bible right somebody
[45:13] with not the without the Holy Ghost
[45:14] reads the Bible mhm they don't get the
[45:17] same understanding that's it's the same
[45:19] words that's right right it's not
[45:21] changing anything that's you read when
[45:24] you were Baptist or whatever you where
[45:26] you
[45:27] read baptized in the name of the father
[45:29] Son and Holy Ghost you put your stamp on
[45:30] it that's the way you read it that's
[45:33] right that's not what it said no but
[45:35] that's what you read right now let's get
[45:39] into the book let's go to the first
[45:41] quote I brought some I told them I only
[45:43] had six quotes but one of them is about
[45:44] four pages long so I tricked them a
[45:47] little bit in the sardian church
[45:50] age Church a book chapter 7 we're going
[45:53] to let brother random explain
[45:56] about the book now let's run back let's
[45:59] don't go to Revelations 5 come back and
[46:01] let's explain Revelations 20 about the
[46:04] books all right and where people go and
[46:07] what happens to them because it's going
[46:08] to help you in Revelation 5 when we get
[46:10] back to it about 6:00 this afternoon at
[46:12] the very start of our study nobody left
[46:16] at the very start of our study let it be
[46:18] known that there is not one scripture
[46:20] that teaches that God is presently
[46:22] compiling a record of names God does not
[46:24] have to sit down and and physically
[46:26] write down no when he thought it that
[46:29] was
[46:30] it this was done before the foundation
[46:33] of the world as we will point out
[46:35] shortly also it is not a question of
[46:37] Simply involving ourselves with two
[46:39] groups of people both of whom had
[46:41] opportunity to receive eternal life
[46:43] where one group received it and had
[46:44] their names placed on the record while
[46:46] the other ones who refused it did not
[46:48] have their Nam so placed right we will
[46:50] actually show by scripture that
[46:51] multitudes who were not even born again
[46:54] listen to this
[46:56] read that we will actually show by
[46:58] scripture that multitudes who were not
[47:01] even born again will go into eternal
[47:04] life amen right more than it's going to
[47:06] be in the city he going to be outside
[47:08] that
[47:10] city as strange as this may sound it is
[47:13] certainly true we will also show that
[47:15] there's a group of people whose names
[47:16] have been placed on that record before
[47:18] the foundation of the world cannot under
[47:21] any circumstance right exactly amen for
[47:24] predestination amen cannot under any
[47:26] circumstance have those names
[47:29] removed but will also show that another
[47:31] group whose names were on that record
[47:34] before the foundation of the world will
[47:37] have their names removed
[47:42] right now let us go another
[47:45] step but first let's review our case all
[47:48] right he's going to review the case here
[47:50] and then I'm going to break it down for
[47:51] you let the
[47:53] prophet say it then we're going to back
[47:55] up
[47:57] up and show the sections cuz really
[47:59] there's four sections to the
[48:02] book which prop said what right now
[48:05] let's go another step but before we do
[48:07] let's review our case thus far first of
[48:10] all first we know that most assuredly
[48:13] that the purpose of God stands in
[48:14] election it was Pur purp in himself it
[48:17] was God's purpose to bring forth a
[48:19] people like unto himself that would be a
[48:23] word bride amen she was chosen before
[48:25] the foundation of the world in him
[48:27] remember that sermon she was forn and
[48:30] beloved before she was ever brought
[48:32] forth during the ages upon the Earth she
[48:34] was Redeemed by his blood and can never
[48:36] come into condemnation we're going to
[48:37] get into that in a little while she can
[48:39] never be in the Judgment because sin
[48:42] cannot be imputed unto her right amen
[48:46] Romans 4:8 blessed is the man whom the
[48:48] Lord will not impute sin but indeed she
[48:50] shall be with him in his throne of
[48:53] judgment right so that book basically
[48:57] disappears right as far as a remembrance
[49:01] in books that's why I say in Revelation
[49:03] 20 really this first one is not in
[49:06] there it's not we're not
[49:09] judged by the time we get to Revelations
[49:11] 20 we're doing the judging we're not
[49:14] judged we're doing the judging all right
[49:17] so so our book is s here they're
[49:19] actually looking at us right being
[49:23] judged
[49:24] from the Eternal section of the book
[49:27] amen all right so now secondly all right
[49:31] I'm sorry but indeed she shall be with
[49:33] him in his throne of judgment judging
[49:34] the world and even angels her name each
[49:37] of her members was written in a section
[49:39] of the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[49:40] foundation of the world that's number
[49:42] one number two secondly there is another
[49:45] class their names are also in the book
[49:47] of life and they will come up in the
[49:49] second Resurrection such are the foolish
[49:51] virgins and the righteous as are spoken
[49:53] of in Matthew 25 remember the wise
[49:56] virgin and the foolish virgin in this
[49:58] class also are those who do not worship
[50:00] the Beast are become involved in the
[50:02] Antichrist system but die for their
[50:04] faith even though they are not in the
[50:06] bride right when we go up persecution
[50:09] starts in the foolish virgins over here
[50:11] the ones that are not born again all
[50:13] right everybody understand that say Amen
[50:16] in this class also are those who do not
[50:17] worship the Beast or become involved in
[50:19] the Antichrist system but die for their
[50:21] faith even though they are not in the
[50:23] bride not having been born again but
[50:25] they will come up in the second
[50:27] resurrection and go into eternal life
[50:30] amen everybody got that all right
[50:32] thirdly there are the borderline
[50:34] Christians such as we saw in Israel
[50:37] coming out of Egypt these had their
[50:40] names in The Book of Life and their
[50:43] words written in the books keep that
[50:46] word work we're going to get to
[50:49] something these having failed to obey
[50:51] God and being void of the spirit though
[50:54] even listen though even even the signs
[50:56] and wonders were amongst them right will
[50:58] have their names removed from The Book
[51:00] of Life amongst this group will be the
[51:03] ones like Judas who though entirely void
[51:05] of the spirit entirely void of the
[51:08] spirit right right huh yes but our
[51:12] religious will have manifestations in
[51:14] their lives I telling them downstairs
[51:16] and I'm telling you again do not ever
[51:18] base your Christian experience on
[51:20] whether God answers your prayers or
[51:22] not that's right
[51:25] or whether you're successful or
[51:28] not God can heal a
[51:31] prosecute right don't ever I never have
[51:36] I love it when God answers my prayer but
[51:38] I don't I don't put that as a well I
[51:39] know God's with me well I know I'm a Son
[51:41] of God oh sure he he'll answer a son's
[51:45] prayer but he'll also answer a
[51:47] prostitute's prayer right that's right
[51:50] the Bible doesn't stipulate he said if
[51:51] you'll pay your tithe I'll pour out the
[51:52] windows of Heaven he didn't say just
[51:54] because you're my children right
[51:56] no cuz that's what that prostitute does
[51:58] there's no way her filthy
[52:01] life her filthy life cannot do anything
[52:04] but put her in hell but she can walk
[52:06] before somebody and somebody can reach
[52:08] their hand and say sister buy his
[52:10] stripes you're healed and if she would
[52:12] go I believe what that man says God to
[52:14] heal her of anything she's got but the
[52:16] tomorrow she may have five Johns out
[52:18] there that she's working for so don't
[52:20] ever base your Christian experience on
[52:22] that God answers your prayer that's
[52:23] right amen I said don't B it it's good
[52:26] that it happen but don't put it and say
[52:28] this is why cuz I'm going to tell you
[52:30] something God answered judas's
[52:34] prayer heal the sick raise the Dead cast
[52:38] out
[52:39] Devils huh among this group will be one
[52:42] like Judas who though entirely bored of
[52:44] the spirit but are religious will have
[52:46] manifestations in their lives and though
[52:48] on the
[52:50] books were not the elected in him amen
[52:54] that's right I'm prove that to you in
[52:56] just a little while such also are BM
[52:58] will be in that group fourth and finally
[53:00] there's your four groups are the ones
[53:03] whose names have never been or never or
[53:06] ever will be written on the
[53:08] books such as are found in Revelations
[53:11] 138 Revelation 178 all that dwell on the
[53:13] Earth shall worship Him whose names are
[53:15] not written in the Book of Life of the
[53:16] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[53:18] world the Beast that thou sawest was and
[53:20] is not and shall Ascend to the bottom of
[53:21] his pit and go into predition and they
[53:23] that dwell on the Earth shall Wonder
[53:25] whose names were not written in the Book
[53:27] of Life from the foundation of the world
[53:29] when they behold the Beast that was and
[53:30] is not and yet is in other words ones
[53:32] that take the mark of the beast and
[53:35] never is any kind of religious order all
[53:37] right Jesus said that a certain group
[53:39] would accept one who came in his own
[53:41] name that one is the
[53:42] Antichrist and that is exactly what it
[53:45] says of them in Revelations 138 and
[53:48] 178 kind of strange how
[53:51] 138
[53:53] and Hebrews 138 kind of coincide there
[53:56] Jesus Christ say yesterday day and
[53:58] forever all that go on Earth shall
[54:00] worship the other guy whose name is not
[54:02] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[54:03] that's right all right these were
[54:05] ordained of God but not into election
[54:07] and this group is such that are as
[54:09] Pharaoh then he said to him in other
[54:12] words he raises up people see even for
[54:14] this purpose have I raised thee up
[54:15] vessels of Wrath fitted for Destruction
[54:18] Romans 91722 none of these would be
[54:20] placed on the records of life right I am
[54:23] not saying there is no record of them
[54:25] right MH cuz a record is a person we
[54:27] just prove that right a record is the
[54:30] words you bear or the manifestation or
[54:32] the life or the actions that you are
[54:34] amen all right their purpose of
[54:35] existence has been dealt with slightly
[54:38] in the rest of this book but we can add
[54:40] two more scriptures Proverbs 16 the Lord
[54:41] has made the wicked for the day of evil
[54:43] job 2123 2130 the wicked is reserved to
[54:47] the day of Destruction they shall be
[54:48] bought brought forth to the day of Wrath
[54:51] all right so you got everybody got that
[54:54] there's four sections yes Eternal right
[54:57] right right foolish virgin yes ones that
[55:00] will be blotted out amen and ones that
[55:02] are sinners they just they're just going
[55:04] to walk right through right but now
[55:09] remember somebody's going to be judged
[55:11] by their works that's right that's what
[55:13] it says in Revelation and brother Brown
[55:14] just said it right here so let's go to
[55:16] the first section is eternal we're going
[55:18] to break the four sections down
[55:21] Revelations 13:8 all that dwell upon the
[55:23] Earth shall worship Him whose names are
[55:25] not written on the Book of Life slain
[55:27] from the foundation of the world so
[55:29] there's your Lamb's Book of Life when
[55:31] you when it says Lamb's Book of Life
[55:33] what does lamb constitute Redemption
[55:36] amen so there's your redeemable people
[55:40] the Lamb's Book of Life all right cuz he
[55:42] purchased them with his blood yes he did
[55:45] all right Revelation 21:27 and there
[55:48] shall in no wise enter into anything
[55:50] that defileth neither whatsoever worketh
[55:53] Abomination he's talking about into the
[55:54] city
[55:55] or maketh a lie but they which are
[55:57] written in the Lamb's Book of Life cuz
[56:00] remember the ones that are not in the
[56:02] Lamb's Book of Life they're going to be
[56:03] give some will be going to give an
[56:04] eternal life they can come into the city
[56:06] but they got to go back out live outside
[56:09] in the world right in the world I'm
[56:11] talking about the future home I'm way
[56:12] ahead over here in the future home now
[56:14] but the ones written in the Lamb's Book
[56:16] of Life they are the city that's right
[56:19] they don't just involve theel and they
[56:21] are the city that's why the city was
[56:23] built mhm Revelations 20 and 12 and I
[56:26] saw the dead small and great stand
[56:27] before God and the books were open and
[56:30] another book was open which is The Book
[56:31] of Life and the dead were judged out of
[56:33] those which are written in the book
[56:34] according to the words I put that one in
[56:36] there to show you one more
[56:37] time we're not included in
[56:40] that that's the second Resurrection
[56:44] right hello we come up in the first
[56:48] resurrection that's the second
[56:50] Resurrection we're are here judging this
[56:52] group of
[56:53] people here's a key according to their
[56:57] works if you stand before the Judgment
[57:00] seat it's going to be according to your
[57:03] works I don't ever want that to
[57:07] happen how many of you would like to be
[57:09] judged according to your works right now
[57:11] and you're born
[57:13] again nobody raised their
[57:16] hand all right that's the first section
[57:18] now let's go to First Corinthians 6 1-3
[57:21] dare any of you having a matter against
[57:25] another go to law before the unjust and
[57:28] not before the
[57:29] Saints right we fall very short on this
[57:32] scripture right
[57:33] here do you not know that the Saints
[57:36] shall judge the
[57:38] world and if the world shall be judged
[57:41] by
[57:44] you are you unworthy to judge the
[57:47] smallest matters here in other words
[57:50] know ye not that you shall judge Angels
[57:53] how much more things that that pertain
[57:55] to this life right
[57:58] amen that means a brother taking another
[58:01] brother to
[58:04] court two real brothers won't do
[58:07] that won't happen just won't you going
[58:10] to break scripture if you do that's true
[58:12] dare any of
[58:14] you Paul was pretty ill with these
[58:16] Corinthians they were doing a lot of bad
[58:18] things dare any of you having a matter
[58:20] amongst you go to law before in other
[58:23] words before an unjust judge right mhm
[58:26] and not before the Saints do you not
[58:27] know that the Saints shall judge the
[58:29] world but we're supposed to be able to
[58:31] judge and we will be I put that in there
[58:35] to show you that we're not part of that
[58:37] book in Revelations 20 we're doing the
[58:39] judging not being judged we're doing the
[58:41] judging all right so now foolish
[58:46] virgin now everybody knows to save time
[58:49] Matthew 25 1-13 you remember what
[58:52] happened there were five wise virgins MH
[58:55] that got oil in the lamp type of the
[58:57] Holy Ghost and then there was five
[58:58] foolish virgins now they were virgin to
[59:00] the word yes all right but they just
[59:03] didn't go on further they maybe had a
[59:05] pastor that didn't have the new
[59:09] birth your pastor don't have the new
[59:11] birth you don't have
[59:13] it or you going to find you one that
[59:16] does right cuz you can't go any higher
[59:18] than your
[59:19] pastor none of us I don't care who we
[59:21] are can go higher than our pastor okay
[59:24] what that's what the prophet said and I
[59:27] kind of believe it yes M five of them
[59:29] were wise five were foolish the five
[59:32] wise were in the Lamb's Book of Life
[59:34] correct to break this down right they
[59:37] were in the Lamb's Book of Life cuz they
[59:38] had the oil oil is the Holy Ghost the
[59:41] Lamb's Book of Life is the holy ghost in
[59:43] the life of the
[59:45] people that's don't think cleans you up
[59:48] M right holy ghost say don't thing
[59:50] cleans you up that's right so five of
[59:53] them took their lamps
[59:55] and took no oil with them but the wives
[59:57] took the oil with their lamps now you
[59:59] understand what happened when the
[1:00:00] bridegroom carried thank God he
[1:00:03] carried they all slumbered and slept and
[1:00:05] at midnight there was a cowd behold the
[1:00:06] brown Grom comes go out and meet him
[1:00:09] then all the virgins
[1:00:12] arose
[1:00:14] right all of them did and the foolish
[1:00:17] said and the wise give us what you got
[1:00:20] that's cuz there's something not letting
[1:00:22] us get to your
[1:00:25] spot that's right and the foolish said
[1:00:28] un the wives give us of your oil for our
[1:00:30] lamps are gone out but the wiv answered
[1:00:32] said not so least there be not enough
[1:00:35] for us and you but go you rather to them
[1:00:37] that sell and buy for yourselves and
[1:00:39] while they went the bridegroom came and
[1:00:41] they that were ready went with him now
[1:00:43] what happened to the other
[1:00:44] virgins afterwards came also the other
[1:00:47] virgin said Lord Lord open to us but he
[1:00:49] answered said barely verely I say unto
[1:00:51] you brother
[1:00:53] dick I know know you're not right I
[1:00:56] never knew
[1:00:59] you watch therefore for you know neither
[1:01:02] the day nor the hour wherein the son of
[1:01:04] man cometh all right so now let's go to
[1:01:08] the second quote sardian Church age now
[1:01:10] brother R's going to break this down for
[1:01:11] you I don't have to he's already done it
[1:01:13] the question now arises why are these
[1:01:15] righteous ones in the
[1:01:17] Judgment there is no other place they
[1:01:19] can come up for there are but two
[1:01:22] resurrections and since they could not
[1:01:24] qualify for the first resurrection they
[1:01:26] must come up in the second which is the
[1:01:28] resurrection unto
[1:01:31] judgment the ones who qualify for the
[1:01:33] first resurrection the bride are not in
[1:01:36] the Judgment right amen John 5:24 you
[1:01:40] read that save time but notice carefully
[1:01:42] Jesus must have yet another group in
[1:01:45] mind right let's read that very very I
[1:01:48] say to you he that Hearth my word and
[1:01:49] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:01:51] everlasting life that is the believer is
[1:01:53] already the recipient of eternal life
[1:01:56] which he has in his possession now and
[1:01:57] shall not come into condemnation shall
[1:02:00] not come into judgment is what it really
[1:02:02] says but it's passed permanently from
[1:02:04] Death un life everybody like that
[1:02:06] permanently I do but notice carefully
[1:02:08] Jesus must have yet another group in
[1:02:10] mind who at a certain Resurrection will
[1:02:12] receive eternal life they will receive
[1:02:14] it at the resurrection not having
[1:02:16] previously received it as a member of
[1:02:19] the bride all right John 5:28 Marvel not
[1:02:22] at this for the hour has come which all
[1:02:24] all that are in the grave shall hear his
[1:02:26] voice that's not the first resurrection
[1:02:29] right all is not going to hear his voice
[1:02:32] in the first
[1:02:33] resurrection everybody understand yes
[1:02:36] all is not going to hear
[1:02:39] that or was I in which all that are in
[1:02:42] the grave shall hear his voice and shall
[1:02:44] come forth they that have done good
[1:02:46] under the resurrection of life and they
[1:02:48] that done Evil under the resurrection of
[1:02:50] damnation now we all know that John
[1:02:52] 5:28-29 is not the Rapture right for
[1:02:55] only the dead in Christ will arise from
[1:02:58] the graves at that time along with the
[1:03:00] living bride who still is on the earth
[1:03:03] you see what that group is all right 1
[1:03:05] Thessalonians 4:16-17 for the Lord
[1:03:07] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:03:09] sh voice of an archangel with the Trump
[1:03:11] of God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:03:12] first then we which are alive and remain
[1:03:15] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:03:17] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:03:18] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:03:21] there's your first
[1:03:23] resurrection
[1:03:25] right first
[1:03:26] resurrection but it says in John 5:28
[1:03:29] that all are going to come forth from
[1:03:31] the grave this is the very same
[1:03:33] resurrection that is spoken of look in
[1:03:36] Revelations 20 we just read 11 through1
[1:03:38] 15 wherein the dead were brought before
[1:03:41] the Lord and judged according to their
[1:03:43] works and all those names were all whose
[1:03:47] names were not in the Book of Life were
[1:03:49] then cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:03:52] everybody there so far yes all right so
[1:03:54] there's your first section is the
[1:03:57] Eternal section the second section is
[1:03:59] the foolish virgin they will have to
[1:04:01] come before the judgment and be judged
[1:04:03] for their Works remember what a foolish
[1:04:04] virgin is he's a virgin to the word he
[1:04:06] or
[1:04:07] she but he does not receive the baptism
[1:04:09] of the Holy Ghost that's why it's very
[1:04:11] important because you know what if we
[1:04:12] take the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[1:04:14] stand in the judgment and are not judged
[1:04:16] amen if we don't receive the Holy
[1:04:19] Ghost and just in the foolish virgin
[1:04:23] group you will have to be judged by your
[1:04:26] works that you've done on this Earth
[1:04:29] that's right exactly that's right first
[1:04:31] resurrection does not you're already
[1:04:33] judged you're already passed from Death
[1:04:35] un life Hallelujah to that we've done
[1:04:38] past all that but there's a group The
[1:04:40] foolish virgin that got to come up
[1:04:41] because you know what they're going to
[1:04:42] be hunted down like dogs give their life
[1:04:44] for the gospel after we're gone right
[1:04:47] after we're gone the foolish virgin
[1:04:48] still going to hold on to their faith
[1:04:50] they're going to say there's got to be
[1:04:52] something something
[1:04:55] wrong about this world system and about
[1:04:57] this Catholic church and about all this
[1:04:59] stuff and I'm going to make a stand for
[1:05:00] god well God's going to give them
[1:05:02] eternal life for their Works they'll
[1:05:04] come up and say he'll say Hey you stood
[1:05:06] for me this not scripture you stood for
[1:05:09] me so I now will stand for you all right
[1:05:13] but I don't want to be in that group cuz
[1:05:15] one little mess up and you go into this
[1:05:17] next section which is the borderline
[1:05:20] Christians those are the ones that had
[1:05:22] their names put on the book right but
[1:05:24] have been blotted out and then the
[1:05:26] fourth section is the ones that never
[1:05:29] were put on the book now look there's
[1:05:33] five things that can get your name
[1:05:35] blotted out of the book of life we're
[1:05:37] going to look at them right here the
[1:05:38] number three says how to be blotted out
[1:05:40] all right let's go to the next one
[1:05:43] number one is to serve
[1:05:47] Idols what did Dan and Ephraim do they
[1:05:50] served Idols their name was blotted out
[1:05:52] under heaven right
[1:05:54] all right Ephraim is joined to Idols let
[1:05:57] him alone Hosea 4:17 First Kings tells
[1:06:00] you the whole story just keep scrolling
[1:06:02] through for time but you understand that
[1:06:05] that you can be blotted out for serving
[1:06:08] Idols
[1:06:09] right you ain't got to be like the idols
[1:06:12] they were
[1:06:13] serving right no anything you put before
[1:06:17] God is
[1:06:19] a idol that's all right so you can have
[1:06:22] your name blotted out
[1:06:26] if you serve Idols number two if you do
[1:06:28] not
[1:06:31] repent listen Exodus 32 3233 yet now if
[1:06:35] thou will forgive their sin and if
[1:06:39] not blot me I pray to thee out of the
[1:06:42] book talking about Moses and the Lord
[1:06:43] said unto Moses whosoever has sinned
[1:06:45] against me him will I blot out of my
[1:06:48] book he told Moses they sin against me
[1:06:51] they're not repenting they just keep
[1:06:53] going on and on and doing the same thing
[1:06:55] over and over and over again well one
[1:06:57] day God's going to say that's
[1:06:59] it I'm
[1:07:01] done uh you don't need to repent the
[1:07:04] same thing every day if you repent the
[1:07:06] same thing every day you got a devil in
[1:07:08] you yeah right and you need to get him
[1:07:11] out or either you're not born again one
[1:07:14] of the
[1:07:15] two right same thing I mean I mean if I
[1:07:18] got a problem if I had a drinking
[1:07:21] problem and I drink tomorrow and say God
[1:07:23] forgive me
[1:07:24] God I fail sorry next day I go back to
[1:07:26] the liquor store God forgive me I fell
[1:07:29] go back and I got no you're not born
[1:07:32] again cuz what's inside of you will get
[1:07:34] that thing out of there he said
[1:07:36] whosoever has sinned against me him will
[1:07:38] I blot out number three iniquity look in
[1:07:41] Psalm 69 cuz what happened to the
[1:07:45] children of Israel when they said let
[1:07:47] his blood be on us right and our
[1:07:49] children listen to this PM 69 this is
[1:07:52] showing what's going to happen happened
[1:07:54] when they crucified Christ they gave me
[1:07:56] also golf for my meat and in my thirst
[1:07:58] they gave me vinegar to drink let their
[1:08:00] table become a snare before them and
[1:08:02] that which have been for their welfare
[1:08:04] let it become a trap Jesus went to be
[1:08:07] their welfare remember he went to the
[1:08:08] house of Israel he went to his people
[1:08:10] right let their eyes be darkened let
[1:08:12] they see not and make their loins
[1:08:14] continually to shap pour out thy
[1:08:16] indignation upon them and let th
[1:08:18] wrathful anger take hold of them let
[1:08:20] their habitation be desolate and let
[1:08:23] none dwell in their tents for they
[1:08:25] persecute him who thou has smitten and
[1:08:28] they talk to the grief of Those whom
[1:08:30] thou has wounded add iniquity unto their
[1:08:34] iniquity and let them not come into
[1:08:37] righteousness let them be
[1:08:39] blotted out of the book of the living
[1:08:41] and not be written with the righteous
[1:08:45] glory amen all right that's one way to
[1:08:47] be put out right that's pretty bad let's
[1:08:51] look at number three quote let's see
[1:08:53] what brother R say about that when
[1:08:55] Israel rejected the leadership of God in
[1:08:57] the pillar of fire and turned to worship
[1:08:58] the golden calvs their names were
[1:09:00] removed from The Book of
[1:09:02] Life Exodus 32:33 whosoever has sinned
[1:09:05] against me him will I blot out of my
[1:09:07] book if such turn to Idols demands the
[1:09:09] penalty of the removal of names from the
[1:09:10] book of life then most assuredly
[1:09:12] Israel's rejection of Jesus which is
[1:09:15] Iniquity as Messiah would demand a
[1:09:17] severe penalty that is exactly so in
[1:09:19] Psalm 69 which sets forth forth the
[1:09:22] humiliation of Jesus it's says in verse
[1:09:24] 2128 we just read that just we scrolling
[1:09:26] up through that same time let them be
[1:09:29] blotted out of the book of the living
[1:09:30] and not be written with the righteous
[1:09:32] when the Jews rejected Jesus there was a
[1:09:34] literal Turning Away of God from them to
[1:09:37] the Gentiles amen all right we know then
[1:09:39] God did come to the Gentiles now number
[1:09:41] four it's really interesting here CL
[1:09:43] brother Claud and I were talking about
[1:09:44] these so we kind of put these together
[1:09:46] but stop following Jesus look in John
[1:09:49] 666 that brother said it yesterday he
[1:09:51] read several scriptures we're going to
[1:09:53] read today yesterday but John
[1:09:56] 666 number sound familiar
[1:10:00] yes the number of the Beast is it don't
[1:10:03] you think they took the mark of the
[1:10:04] beast cuz what happened this is the
[1:10:05] story of when Jesus said unless you eat
[1:10:07] my flesh and drink my blood you know
[1:10:10] what he didn't stop to explain that
[1:10:12] right he just went right on that's right
[1:10:14] from that time many of his disciples
[1:10:16] went back and walk no more with him and
[1:10:18] I like what the brother said they
[1:10:20] probably didn't go out in the world they
[1:10:21] just went to a started going to another
[1:10:23] synagogue
[1:10:25] another message Church they didn't like
[1:10:26] what the preacher said so they went to
[1:10:28] another message
[1:10:29] church but their names were blotted out
[1:10:32] because they stopped following Jesus cuz
[1:10:35] from that time they walk no more with
[1:10:37] him hey you quit walking with Jesus
[1:10:39] Christ your name's going to go somewhere
[1:10:41] except in the book of life then number
[1:10:44] five is pretty simple add or take away
[1:10:46] reading Revelations 2219 and if any man
[1:10:49] shall take away from the words of the
[1:10:50] book of this prophecy God shall take
[1:10:53] away his part out of the book of life
[1:10:55] and out of the holy city and from the
[1:10:56] things which are written in this book
[1:11:00] all right everybody understand that
[1:11:01] right we are we are to a place right
[1:11:05] now to let me take a
[1:11:11] breather but
[1:11:13] listen talking about this is where we're
[1:11:16] going to get into the book of books we
[1:11:18] got
[1:11:19] time that shows you that when those
[1:11:21] books are open in Revelations 20 that
[1:11:24] you and I are going to be there as the
[1:11:26] judge right right judging Saints judging
[1:11:29] the world judging Angels amen so that
[1:11:32] book's not going to show up anywhere
[1:11:35] until it's Revelations 5 all right cuz
[1:11:38] it's not in
[1:11:39] 20 right right but now foolish virgin
[1:11:43] are going to have to
[1:11:45] stand right right then the Bible says
[1:11:48] they'll be divided as sheep and goats
[1:11:50] not as she not not sheep and goats
[1:11:52] sheep's already in the F but they're
[1:11:54] going to be divided as sheep and goats
[1:11:57] right all right so the goats are going
[1:11:58] to go to hell and the Sheep are going to
[1:12:00] he's going to say enter into the joy of
[1:12:01] the Lord that's going to be somebody
[1:12:02] that changes your tire or it's good to
[1:12:04] you I didn't read that quote but in
[1:12:07] there brother Brown says people that are
[1:12:09] good to the bride will be given eternal
[1:12:12] life and there'll probably be a lot more
[1:12:14] of them than it really will be bride you
[1:12:16] don't know if your neighbor never
[1:12:17] complains you know brother R said that
[1:12:19] woman uh if you saw it in the book she
[1:12:21] had short hair she had on shorts
[1:12:23] accepted a message but brother R said
[1:12:25] God's going to give her eternal life
[1:12:26] well she's going to be one of those that
[1:12:28] walks up right that God's going to say
[1:12:31] your
[1:12:32] Works your Works prove to me yes that
[1:12:36] you honored this man this Prophet yes
[1:12:40] and so enter into the joy of the Lord
[1:12:42] all right so there's the people for that
[1:12:44] then the ones that are blotted out
[1:12:45] that's the borderline Christians that's
[1:12:47] Judas judas's name was in the book right
[1:12:50] Great Signs wonders Miracles and all
[1:12:52] those things he had the min Min brother
[1:12:54] he didn't just was he didn't just have a
[1:12:57] separate Ministry he was in the ministry
[1:12:59] of those 12 going out teaching the word
[1:13:02] of God preaching the word of God having
[1:13:04] signs having wonders having Miracles yet
[1:13:07] he was void of the spirit right and his
[1:13:09] name was blotted out why he didn't go
[1:13:12] any further and he was judged for his
[1:13:14] Works amen all right we don't want to be
[1:13:16] judged for our works amen right we want
[1:13:19] our judgment to be on Jesus Christ amen
[1:13:22] not of our work and I know there's going
[1:13:24] to be a um a section that that we have
[1:13:27] to go through as far as we as Christians
[1:13:29] we're going to have to give an account
[1:13:30] for things that we don't repent of here
[1:13:32] that's right we're going to have to give
[1:13:33] an account for that but it's not going
[1:13:34] to be per se we're talking about this
[1:13:36] book of books all right because it's not
[1:13:38] going to be where you receive eternal
[1:13:40] life or not so we're not going to worry
[1:13:42] about that it's not going to be our
[1:13:43] names can never be blotted out if we're
[1:13:45] born again today your name can't be
[1:13:46] blotted out that's right all right so
[1:13:49] let's don't worry about that let's just
[1:13:51] get in that amen
[1:13:54] book MH become the book yes and we won't
[1:13:57] have to worry about it all right but I
[1:13:59] always
[1:14:02] wondered then we'll start on on right
[1:14:04] here in this quot number four this is
[1:14:06] where we're going to start the book of
[1:14:07] books everybody understand so far about
[1:14:09] what's going to happen at the white
[1:14:10] Throne judgment yes group of people
[1:14:12] comes up giv eternal life for their
[1:14:15] Works yes then there's a section that's
[1:14:18] going to say Hey you could have made it
[1:14:20] but this is why you didn't you're going
[1:14:22] over here then there's a section that's
[1:14:24] just going to just keep on walking right
[1:14:26] never be given eternal life never even
[1:14:28] have a chance because they turn the word
[1:14:30] down they etern God down somewhere
[1:14:32] they've turned God down and are brute
[1:14:35] Beast the Bible says made to be
[1:14:37] destroyed right and I feel sorry for
[1:14:40] those people but you
[1:14:42] know somebody was talking the other day
[1:14:44] in the end time in Revelations 3 it
[1:14:47] tells it says God told the people said I
[1:14:51] wish you were cold
[1:14:53] or I wish you were
[1:14:56] hot he wished that right if you're going
[1:15:00] to be cold be cold right if you going to
[1:15:01] be hot be hot the ones in the middle is
[1:15:04] the ones he going to spew out of his
[1:15:06] mouth the ones that lukewarm in other
[1:15:07] words the ones that profess Christianity
[1:15:10] but don't go all the way all right and
[1:15:12] that's a horrible group but listen to
[1:15:14] this this is really don't even look turn
[1:15:17] that off for a second please thank you
[1:15:20] listen to
[1:15:22] me
[1:15:23] Rahab the Harlot has
[1:15:25] always always bothered
[1:15:29] me she's a plain and simple
[1:15:34] prosecute same way with the woman that
[1:15:36] was thrown down in front of Jesus right
[1:15:40] CAU in the act of
[1:15:42] adulterine all
[1:15:44] right now listen this will help
[1:15:48] you what did Jesus
[1:15:50] do and say to that woman
[1:15:55] woman where's your
[1:15:59] accuser remember he said whoever has not
[1:16:02] committed sin cast the first stone yes
[1:16:04] right well when he looked up from
[1:16:05] whatever he was writing in the dirt when
[1:16:07] he looked
[1:16:08] up there was nobody to accuse this woman
[1:16:13] left and he told her he said your sins
[1:16:16] are
[1:16:17] forgiven you have no
[1:16:19] Witnesses there's no one here to accuse
[1:16:22] you right I always wondered about how
[1:16:24] Rahab got by with that have you ever
[1:16:26] read that
[1:16:28] story God killed all of her accusers
[1:16:32] right right I always wondered how Rahab
[1:16:36] could get by and marry an Israeli
[1:16:38] General and out of that Union comes OED
[1:16:44] and and Boaz and Jesse and David and all
[1:16:47] the way down to Christ and God not
[1:16:49] judged that
[1:16:50] woman he got rid of her
[1:16:54] accuser the Bible says when the walls of
[1:16:56] Jericho
[1:16:57] fell rahab's house was the only one left
[1:17:00] and and God told Joshua said kill man
[1:17:05] woman and
[1:17:08] children so God did away with all of her
[1:17:12] accusers so she could stand and
[1:17:16] marry and become righteous in the eyes
[1:17:18] of God sure didn't do away with her
[1:17:20] being a prostitute thank you Jesus but
[1:17:23] Jesus told the same woman the same thing
[1:17:25] said where's your accusers she said I
[1:17:28] have none he said well I didn't see you
[1:17:30] do it Go and sin no more got rid of all
[1:17:34] of her accusers I've always wondered
[1:17:35] about Ray after the other day I was sent
[1:17:37] on the
[1:17:38] porch and he just came to me he got rid
[1:17:42] of all the accusers amen so he's right
[1:17:45] there in the Bible same way Jesus dealt
[1:17:47] with a harlot in the New Testament God
[1:17:49] dealt with a harlot in the Old Testament
[1:17:51] and that old Harlot was me and you amen
[1:17:54] right we're not talking about some
[1:17:56] prostitute out here on the street we're
[1:17:57] talking about the prostitutes we were
[1:17:59] that's right that's right get forid of
[1:18:01] the accusers and we're going to get into
[1:18:03] that in just a little bit let's go to
[1:18:06] quote number
[1:18:08] four now let's start on the book of
[1:18:11] books cuz this is the
[1:18:14] part that I really enjoy now we're going
[1:18:17] to read the we're going to read this in
[1:18:19] invisible

[1:18:33] books that's going to be mysterious to
[1:18:35] you when you read the book of The Seven
[1:18:37] Church ages now we just quoted that out
[1:18:39] of the church age book the two books

[1:18:45] your name on it you never come off other
[1:18:48] one says you can take his name out of
[1:18:50] The Book of Life this brings it
[1:18:51] perfectly into view right here I'm going

[1:18:55] notes here and catch this before we

[1:19:11] author of Life do you believe that
[1:19:12] congregation says amen our natural life
[1:19:16] here we have is just a perversion it

[1:23:44] in the first place the old Union is in
[1:23:47] the sea of God's forgetfulness when are
[1:23:49] we going to start believing
[1:23:51] that all all of
[1:23:54] sleep you wasn't married to it to begin
[1:23:57] with he the bridegroom bore your shame
[1:24:01] himself for you in your place right he
[1:24:04] took your place for you were
[1:24:06] predestinated for him to be in his bride
[1:24:09] before the foundation of the world the
[1:24:10] Bible said so you are the predestinated
[1:24:14] seed how do you come to do this you were
[1:24:17] deceived into it by your first marriage
[1:24:19] to your adulterous parent e mhm it's no
[1:24:22] fault of your own nobody had any
[1:24:24] dealings with getting theirself here
[1:24:26] amen
[1:24:28] right to your adult's parent Eve it's no
[1:24:31] fault of your own by your natural birth
[1:24:33] you come after Eve who committed
[1:24:35] adultery that's the reason you was born
[1:24:38] an adulteress you're a sinner to begin
[1:24:40] with that's right you was deceived into
[1:24:42] it you had no no you it ain't your fault
[1:24:45] you never did it because that little
[1:24:47] germ that was in you was to be you
[1:24:50] before the foundation of the world that
[1:24:52] little Genesis 126 and 27 right that's
[1:24:56] where that's where it begun if you want
[1:24:57] to say there was a beginning right
[1:24:59] that's where it begun that little germ
[1:25:01] that was in you was to be you before the
[1:25:03] foundation of the world God put your
[1:25:05] name in the Lamb's Book of Life God had
[1:25:09] to open those Seven Seals not in the
[1:25:12] denomination he opened those seven
[1:25:14] mysteries in there that shows forth
[1:25:16] brings forth those things that's been
[1:25:17] hid since the foundation of the world
[1:25:19] might be revealed in the last days to
[1:25:21] who
[1:25:22] Amen to sons of God not to the world
[1:25:26] there is your two books one of them is
[1:25:28] the Lamb's Book of Life your name is in
[1:25:30] there is predestinated on there it can't
[1:25:32] go because you can no more take that
[1:25:34] away than nothing see because it was
[1:25:36] foreordained to be in there but the
[1:25:39] regular Book of Life can take that off
[1:25:41] at any time what we were talking about
[1:25:43] here see you don't repent it's off
[1:25:46] anyhow cuz you're going to stand the
[1:25:48] Judgment the bride don't stand the
[1:25:50] Judgment goes in the Rapture now we're
[1:25:53] just ready for one thing that's the
[1:25:55] coming of the Lord there is your name on
[1:25:57] the book The Book of Life is a word of
[1:26:00] God cuz the word is God and God is the
[1:26:03] only thing that is life so your name was
[1:26:06] represented in the Bible before the
[1:26:09] Bible became on word
[1:26:11] right and if you're here to do that want
[1:26:13] it vindicate that word right is that
[1:26:17] correct that was a pretty long
[1:26:20] quote but that was finished now let's go
[1:26:24] to
[1:26:25] Hebrews
[1:26:27] 105 wherefore when he cometh into the
[1:26:29] world he say sacrifice and offerings
[1:26:31] thou wouldest not but a

[1:27:01] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[1:27:04] ink right this book is not written with
[1:27:06] ink right but with the spirit of the
[1:27:09] Living God not in tables of stone but
[1:27:11] where in fleshly tables of the heart I'm
[1:27:15] getting something
[1:27:16] here fleshly look at all that where it
[1:27:18] says flesh but a body thou H has
[1:27:21] prepared me look look what God's trying
[1:27:23] to get us to see Revelations 5
[1:27:29] now I want us to see something right

[1:30:44] the throne and the four beast in the
[1:30:45] midst of the elders stood the lamb and
[1:30:46] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:30:49] seven eyes there's no way there there's
[1:30:52] no way this scene could
[1:30:54] happen until the church Ages were
[1:30:56] fulfilled that's right amen let's go
[1:31:00] back to the Jubilee year 7 sevens is
[1:31:03] 49 49 you don't all go free partially
[1:31:07] you can go free the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:09] Ghost freed a lot of those people that
[1:31:10] were in that book names yes Paul arenus
[1:31:13] Martin Columba and fill in the blank up
[1:31:16] until now William
[1:31:18] brandom
[1:31:20] right fill in the blank
[1:31:23] but the seven horns and seven eyes had
[1:31:25] to come up it had to be in after the
[1:31:27] church
[1:31:28] ages we're finished amen right it's when
[1:31:32] this
[1:31:33] lamb takes a
[1:31:35] book now
[1:31:37] listen I'm going to go slow so you can
[1:31:40] pay attention to my
[1:31:44] notes in Revelations
[1:31:46] 5 that's why I call this now this is my
[1:31:50] Sublime book of books brother Brown said
[1:31:51] this was the most Sublime scripture in
[1:31:53] the Bible right amen cuz it was a
[1:31:55] special group of
[1:31:57] people that God only knew right the
[1:32:01] devil can't get to those
[1:32:05] people because if you believe the way I
[1:32:08] believe that book was Genesis 1:26 and 2
[1:32:12] right man that's right that Adam
[1:32:15] couldn't
[1:32:16] produce and the original title deed
[1:32:19] owner had to take the book right which
[1:32:21] only had the names of the redeemed amen
[1:32:24] and he had to hold on to it but he came
[1:32:26] as a Son of God and sat down on the
[1:32:28] throne of those seven Church ages okay
[1:32:32] right right that
[1:32:35] true he had the
[1:32:37] book so the book must have been worthy
[1:32:40] that's right in Genesis 126 and 27 there
[1:32:43] is no sin there is no adultery there is
[1:32:47] no condemnation there is nothing right
[1:32:50] so let's start now looking at the book
[1:32:51] is being worthy not just the one sitting
[1:32:54] on the throne not just the lamb taking
[1:32:56] the book cuz you know
[1:32:59] what Jesus Christ is not going to reach
[1:33:01] and grab anything that's not worthy
[1:33:03] that's right he's not going to come
[1:33:06] after something that's not worthy he's
[1:33:09] not going to have this whole scene set
[1:33:10] up and reach and get a book and see
[1:33:12] filth in it that's right praise praise
[1:33:15] the Lord yes Lord Genesis 1:26 and 27
[1:33:19] that was the book of all the Nam of the
[1:33:22] redeemed now
[1:33:24] look if my past is not blotted out I've
[1:33:27] got to stand in front of the Judgment
[1:33:29] that's right only on my works right
[1:33:34] right you remember that from back when
[1:33:37] now look this scene is one on the throne
[1:33:39] with that book and that book is the
[1:33:41] title deed to Redemption that's the name
[1:33:43] of the redeemed everybody understand
[1:33:45] that all right and it's what it's closed
[1:33:50] up closed up now we know by being on the
[1:33:54] father's Throne he did let the names out
[1:33:56] down through the church
[1:33:58] ages right right but for us to come to a
[1:34:02] place for total Redemption something's
[1:34:04] got to be shown Glory all right
[1:34:08] right this is where it gets
[1:34:11] thick now remember the father's Throne
[1:34:13] is the Son of God right yes in spirit
[1:34:16] form the Holy Ghost down through the
[1:34:18] church ages everybody know that right
[1:34:21] yeah
[1:34:22] Spirit God that Throne that one sitting
[1:34:23] on the throne with the book in his hand
[1:34:25] was the son of God that was the spirit
[1:34:27] God down through the church ages right
[1:34:30] theophany okay theophanies don't bleed
[1:34:34] right
[1:34:37] right theophanes don't bleed so there
[1:34:40] had to be a scene of him IM
[1:34:43] morphing right into a human man amen to
[1:34:47] bleed come around take the book and turn
[1:34:51] around and sit down right right there's
[1:34:54] your scene all right now
[1:34:57] listen theophanes don't bleed but the
[1:35:00] lamb bled amen sure I know it was the
[1:35:03] blood I know it was the blood I know it
[1:35:07] was a blood for
[1:35:09] me one day when I was lost he died upon
[1:35:13] a cross Glory the Holy Ghost and seven
[1:35:16] horns and seven eyes produced the lamb
[1:35:17] for their
[1:35:18] ages right right man that's what was
[1:35:21] coming to get amen all right now we're
[1:35:24] talking about the Eternal section don't
[1:35:25] worry about anybody else now we're
[1:35:26] talking about the Eternal section don't
[1:35:28] worry about what happened to Judas and
[1:35:29] what happened to this one what happened
[1:35:30] to grandma or any of these I'm talking
[1:35:31] about you guys okay right if you're not
[1:35:33] born again then you need to get over
[1:35:35] into this section of the book amen all
[1:35:37] right now the father had this book then
[1:35:40] since Adam right right right Father
[1:35:44] Strong he was the possessor of that book
[1:35:47] Glory from
[1:35:49] Adam we know Christ came with the book
[1:35:52] in him cuz he was the man sitting on the
[1:35:53] throne come on he's he's he's he's
[1:35:56] fulfilling he's only one God but he's
[1:35:58] fulfilling Offices here I seen amen
[1:36:02] father's Throne he's sitting here with a
[1:36:04] book in his hand getting ready to hand
[1:36:06] it to somebody but now
[1:36:10] watch it was a blood of
[1:36:13] atonement the lamb wasn't the
[1:36:16] offing it was a flesh God right a body
[1:36:20] that has prepared me sure now we know
[1:36:22] Jesus Christ like Dad said today we know
[1:36:24] Jesus Christ did that but what form did
[1:36:26] he do it in
[1:36:29] yeah you testified to you testified to
[1:36:34] you testified to you Jesus Christ
[1:36:37] himself in in in body form has never
[1:36:39] testified to you right oh yeah amen
[1:36:43] that's right but God in flesh right has
[1:36:46] testified to you God in flesh is the one
[1:36:49] that the seed comes out of the body God
[1:36:51] in flesh went from a from a meeting over
[1:36:54] here to an Ethiopian unit yes
[1:36:58] Philip Phillip was God in flesh yes he
[1:37:02] was for his day he was God in flesh amen
[1:37:07] but remember it was a blood atonement
[1:37:10] blood had to be
[1:37:11] shown everybody got that right and we're
[1:37:14] only set free by they were only set free
[1:37:16] by the Holy Ghost in their soul down
[1:37:17] through the seven Church ages everybody
[1:37:19] understand it up until today today yes
[1:37:22] today I'm talking about today we're
[1:37:23] bringing this right up to today amen all
[1:37:26] right now this lamb takes a book on a
[1:37:32] 50 not a
[1:37:35] 49 that right on a 49 that's what
[1:37:40] they've been down through the church
[1:37:41] ages look in
[1:37:43] Leviticus all the scriptures in the Old
[1:37:46] Testament 49 on that 49th year some
[1:37:50] things could go free free right but on
[1:37:52] the 50 everything went free when that
[1:37:55] lamb takes this book everything's going
[1:37:58] free that's right everything's going to
[1:38:00] be revealed everything's going to be
[1:38:02] made known everybody understand
[1:38:04] that but it had to be
[1:38:08] revealed to be made manifest that's
[1:38:10] right Glory he does it he reveals it
[1:38:13] then he makes it manifest right
[1:38:15] everybody think I'm going slow now cuz I
[1:38:16] want you to listen he does it reveals it
[1:38:18] and makes it manifest course got so he's
[1:38:21] got to reveal it to make it manifest
[1:38:24] right and where's he going to be make it
[1:38:26] made it manifest in you that's right the
[1:38:28] lamb that takes the book that's
[1:38:30] right cuz maybe I'm getting a little
[1:38:32] ahead of brother Dale but that lamb that
[1:38:34] takes the book if you got to produce
[1:38:35] that lamb then that's you taking the
[1:38:37] book sure you're part right cuz your
[1:38:41] name's in that book amen right right
[1:38:43] right
[1:38:45] yes had to
[1:38:48] be in the right hand mhm
[1:38:51] soz there's where the power is right the
[1:38:54] power and
[1:38:55] authority and it had to come to a mature
[1:38:58] group of people but listen to this
[1:39:01] here's the home stretch right here let's
[1:39:04] pull up quote number
[1:39:08] five it is rising of the
[1:39:10] sun there was the first sheath come up
[1:39:13] from all the prophets which was the Son
[1:39:15] of God the king of all prophets there
[1:39:17] has been churches churches Brides brides
[1:39:21] Brides churches Brides brides right been
[1:39:25] a lot of
[1:39:26] brides been a lot of churches you
[1:39:29] reading this with me but there has got
[1:39:31] to come one Glory one Hallelujah there
[1:39:38] has come there has to come a real bride
[1:39:40] not saying the other Brides were false
[1:39:42] that's right right but they got to come
[1:39:45] one right right mhm there must come one
[1:39:49] that's not only got the mechanics but
[1:39:51] the Dynamics with it of it makes that
[1:39:54] church live move in the power of his
[1:39:58] resurrection until we come to that place
[1:40:00] until we find that place find it that
[1:40:04] means we got to seek for it what good
[1:40:06] does it do to polish the Hut what good
[1:40:08] does it do they give her a good facelift
[1:40:10] or a Simoniz job for those of you that
[1:40:12] are younger Simoniz means wax cuz there
[1:40:15] was only one thing back when we were
[1:40:16] growing up and that was simonit Turtle
[1:40:19] Wax all right so why I give it a
[1:40:21] facelift or a simonized job when there's
[1:40:23] no Dynamics in it no matter how much the
[1:40:25] mechanics proves to be right there's got
[1:40:27] to be Dynamics to make it work that's
[1:40:29] what he proved Hallelujah that's what
[1:40:32] Easter proved he wasn't only the word
[1:40:34] but he was God himself the Dynamics in
[1:40:37] the word that made the body of Jesus
[1:40:40] Christ who are you and I right cold
[1:40:44] stiff and dead some of y'all came raise
[1:40:46] your hand and say hallelujah praise
[1:40:49] God but if you go to have life in you
[1:40:51] one day you'll be able to
[1:40:59] go man I hate to do this but you know
[1:41:02] you go to other functions and man you
[1:41:04] know people throwing stuff and you know
[1:41:08] doing all this and we just say well
[1:41:10] praise God he saved
[1:41:13] me no he's going to come a power in this
[1:41:16] bride that you not going to be able to
[1:41:17] control
[1:41:18] yourself that made the body of Jesus
[1:41:21] Christ cold stiff and dead in L Jordan
[1:41:24] Shake into life and rise again and roll
[1:41:26] away the stone I am he that was dead so
[1:41:28] dead Till The Sun said he was dead the
[1:41:30] moon said he was dead the Stars said he
[1:41:32] was dead all nature said he was dead and
[1:41:34] now the whole world has to recognize
[1:41:36] that he's alive how is that and his
[1:41:41] bride and now the whole world has to
[1:41:43] recognize that he's alive again he is
[1:41:44] not he was not only the mechanics God's
[1:41:47] word he was the D Dynamics to prove it
[1:41:49] amen and has he being the groom I want
[1:41:52] you to listen to this real close CU I'm
[1:41:54] going to bring out something right here
[1:41:56] and as he being the groom the bride has
[1:41:58] to come forth cuz it's part of him now
[1:42:01] he said he's had Brides brides churches
[1:42:03] churches Brides brides but there's
[1:42:05] coming one right right that's right and
[1:42:08] it can only be the manifestation of the
[1:42:10] fulfilling of all the Revelation yes sir
[1:42:14] any others has spoke of the Bride let me
[1:42:17] read it again it can only be the
[1:42:20] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:42:22] the revelations they didn't have all the
[1:42:24] revelations down Through the Ages any
[1:42:26] other has spoken of the Bride it can
[1:42:28] only manifest if it does something
[1:42:31] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:42:33] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[1:42:36] bone of his bone life of his life power
[1:42:39] of his power she is him as man and woman
[1:42:44] are one a woman taken from his side she
[1:42:47] had taken the spirit the feminine Spirit
[1:42:48] from him the flesh from his side made
[1:42:51] both mechanics and Dynamics the wife
[1:42:54] amen hold that word
[1:42:58] wife cuz it was Brides brides churches
[1:43:02] you can have
[1:43:03] Brides but you only got one wife that's
[1:43:07] right the spirit of him and the Flesh of
[1:43:09] him and put it together made mechanics
[1:43:11] and Dynamics until the church or the
[1:43:13] people in other words till we wake up
[1:43:15] and realize that we're just going to sit
[1:43:17] here and preach sermons just like this
[1:43:19] so now Revelations
[1:43:22] 197 I want you to really pay attention
[1:43:25] to
[1:43:29] this cuz
[1:43:31] remember God's an
[1:43:33] accuser of the Brethren right all down
[1:43:37] Through the Ages he's accused of all
[1:43:40] kind of stuff you know right right you
[1:43:43] not do that you no I guess y'all I'm
[1:43:45] farther long than I am
[1:43:48] then listen to this
[1:43:53] Revelations 19:7 let us be glad and
[1:43:55] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:43:58] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[1:44:00] wife has made herself ready yes yes
[1:44:05] Lord now down through time brother BR
[1:44:07] said we he's had Brides brides churches
[1:44:09] churches but there's coming one right
[1:44:13] one there's coming one that he's looking
[1:44:15] for that's right the devil has beat us
[1:44:18] around as long as that book is closed we
[1:44:20] can't become the part that we're
[1:44:22] supposed to be right that's true it's
[1:44:24] sealed up right right right sealed
[1:44:28] right let's go to Deuteronomy 22 I know
[1:44:32] this is a carnal um
[1:44:35] comparison but it was put in the Bible
[1:44:37] for some reason and I'm going to you
[1:44:39] know it's like I heard a brother uh
[1:44:41] actually brother Aaron brought this
[1:44:43] point out
[1:44:45] Sunday brother Aaron McGary when we were
[1:44:48] in witcon I thought it was good let's
[1:44:51] remember don't take these types all the
[1:44:52] way but let's watch and see what happens
[1:44:55] here if any man take a wife and go in
[1:44:57] her and hate
[1:45:05] her remember who you whole husband used
[1:45:07] to be oh yeah and give occasion of
[1:45:10] speech against her and bring up an evil
[1:45:12] name upon
[1:45:15] her and he's going to say I took this
[1:45:17] woman and when I came into her I found
[1:45:18] her not a mid and no Lord not a burger
[1:45:22] then shall the
[1:45:26] father and her
[1:45:33] mother take and bring forth the tokens
[1:45:35] of the down
[1:45:37] virginity unto the Elders of the city
[1:45:42] yeah and they point at it and for you
[1:45:45] older people you know what tokens of
[1:45:46] virginity is there was a cloth placed
[1:45:48] under the female on the night of her
[1:45:52] marriage and if the blood was there she
[1:45:54] was a virgin that's right if it wasn't
[1:45:56] there she was killed that's right that's
[1:45:58] right look what the daddy does and the
[1:46:01] D's father said saying to the elders I
[1:46:03] give my daughter under this man to wife
[1:46:05] he hated her lo Heath give occasion of
[1:46:08] speech against her he said all these
[1:46:09] things about her I found not my Virgin
[1:46:11] and my daughter a maiden and yet these
[1:46:13] are the
[1:46:14] tokens of my daughter's
[1:46:19] virginity what did he
[1:46:23] do and they shall spread the
[1:46:29] cloth for the Elders of the
[1:46:32] city and say
[1:46:35] look when I see the
[1:46:39] blood when I Glory see the
[1:46:43] blood when I see the blood I will pass I
[1:46:49] will pass eyes over you amen and they
[1:46:52] shall spread the cloth when he Reon got
[1:46:54] that
[1:46:55] book he opened it
[1:46:59] Glory he said
[1:47:02] silence I don't want to hear no more
[1:47:05] right I've
[1:47:07] proven that she's my wife that's right
[1:47:10] right she's not my bride anymore that's
[1:47:13] right right amen she's my wife and I've
[1:47:15] got the token yes of her virginity Glory
[1:47:20] thank you Lord thank you Jesus thank you
[1:47:24] and open the book
[1:47:27] amen that loose me and you right right
[1:47:30] what he looses from
[1:47:34] sin cuz the Elders of the city could
[1:47:36] make no more accusations after that
[1:47:39] cloth was spread
[1:47:40] out because
[1:47:43] there was the
[1:47:46] evidence going back to the first that's
[1:47:48] right there's the evidence MH that's why
[1:47:51] that's the most Sublime scripture in the
[1:47:54] Bible now let's go to the next one let's
[1:47:56] read now this is what
[1:47:58] happened what did we say it
[1:48:01] was strongs 975 a sheet on which
[1:48:05] something had been written
[1:48:09] right it wasn't it wasn't a word it was
[1:48:13] the
[1:48:15] blood the
[1:48:17] token of your Purity right
[1:48:21] God proved the evidence in Revelations 5
[1:48:23] he opened the book and he said shut up
[1:48:27] thank you Lord shut up silence in
[1:48:31] heaven she's
[1:48:34] worthy cuz she's my wife Glory she
[1:48:37] hasn't been running around with anybody
[1:48:39] else She's mine and she's my wife from
[1:48:42] now on she's not you can't even accuse
[1:48:45] her
[1:48:46] anymore cuz it's done here's the token
[1:48:50] to if that token was not put over the
[1:48:52] door which was what blood that's right
[1:48:56] then those people died right they come
[1:48:59] out of the land of
[1:49:01] Egypt like brother for always says the
[1:49:03] breach produced the
[1:49:08] bleach because when you look at red
[1:49:11] three red Glory right you get white
[1:49:15] yeah right sir red through red
[1:49:21] it's white you ever wonder why God put
[1:49:23] it in chapter 5 g r a c e
[1:49:29] righten there's the grace
[1:49:32] people he was worthy to take
[1:49:35] it and turn around and show it to the
[1:49:38] world right right which are your
[1:49:41] accusers he spread it out and reveal
[1:49:44] that we are his
[1:49:46] wife he and he then he opened our eyes
[1:49:49] to show it out of this book and we don't
[1:49:50] have to go get it from another book this
[1:49:52] is the book we get it from right here
[1:49:54] brother
[1:49:56] Brown what is that called the bleeding
[1:50:01] word right invisible Union we'll read it
[1:50:04] in just a
[1:50:06] second John shouted and I would have
[1:50:09] shouted if I had have been there amen if
[1:50:12] the one that took the book was worthy
[1:50:15] then the contents of the book was also
[1:50:18] Worthy righten all he was doing was in
[1:50:22] the acts of a play and he was showing
[1:50:25] what he was doing

[1:57:19] those Church ages came about and as God
[1:57:22] revealed himself more and more in that
[1:57:24] last Church age we had a prophet that
[1:57:27] could prove that the lamb was
[1:57:29] there what was he doing he was showing
[1:57:33] our name in the book
[1:57:36] glory and that it's not our
[1:57:39] righteousness our
[1:57:41] works is what he's done right Lord red
[1:57:44] through
[1:57:45] red blocks out my sin it doesn't block
[1:57:49] me out
[1:57:50] let's bow our heads dear heavenly father
[1:57:53] we pray Lord today that something's been
[1:57:56] said that maybe we can understand a
[1:57:58] little more about you that we can
[1:58:01] realize Lord that it's not our works or
[1:58:03] our Good Deeds or or anything we've done
[1:58:06] we just we're tired of the accuser of
[1:58:09] the Brethren we're tired of of someone
[1:58:11] accusing us of of things and and and not
[1:58:14] looking at the word father we need to
[1:58:16] look to you the author and finisher of
[1:58:18] our faith the one that the one that gave
[1:58:21] your life Lord and we know it now was
[1:58:24] the blood the blood's always been a
[1:58:27] token but it was a token in the Old
[1:58:29] Testament of a of a lamb that was a
[1:58:32] natural lamb that did not have a soul
[1:58:35] but father Behold the Lamb of God that
[1:58:38] takes away the sin of the world came on
[1:58:40] the earth John pointed and said there he
[1:58:43] is same thing The Same Spirit of Elijah
[1:58:48] in the end time and a little Prophet
[1:58:50] called William Brandon pointed and said
[1:58:52] Behold the Lamb of God it takes away the
[1:58:55] sin of the world and Lord he made you
[1:58:58] manifest and he made you known to the
[1:59:01] people and father I pray that our little
[1:59:04] ideas and our and our uh doctrines and
[1:59:07] and denominational thoughts and ideas

[1:59:35] never get her out of my mind Lord when
[1:59:38] you were on the cross the ssong says we
[1:59:41] were there on your mind because you were
[1:59:43] dying for a special group of people a
[1:59:46] people that would live in the worst time
[1:59:49] since the beginning of
[1:59:51] man but you promised us that you would
[1:59:54] take us through this and you promis us
[1:59:56] Lord that You' never leave us or never
[1:59:58] forsake us that where that we are that

[2:00:37] had the book there in the form that you
[2:00:39] were revealing yourself Through the Ages
[2:00:41] but Lord in the end time a prophet comes
[2:00:43] on the scene and says here stands a lamb
[2:00:46] with a book in his hand and there goes a

[2:00:51] accuser Lord when you get rid of our

[2:03:02] was a blood for me whose was
[2:03:17] itel
[2:03:19] when I
[2:03:21] was
[2:03:29] he I know it
[2:03:33] was I
[2:03:41] know one day when I was L he died upon a
[2:03:47] cross and I know it was the blood for
[2:03:53] me it was Emmanuel's
[2:03:57] blood
[2:04:05] uel's one day when I was lost he died
[2:04:11] upon the cross and I know it was BL
[2:04:17] for you know told Brother Bill last
[2:04:20] Sunday everybody enjoyed brother Bill
[2:04:22] being here last Sunday I'm sure I know I
[2:04:24] did and I told him I said you know
[2:04:26] that's the way it should be right I know
[2:04:28] the musicians need to come and play but
[2:04:31] all of our Focus we weren't standing we
[2:04:33] were sitting when that person walked up
[2:04:36] you knew there was a person standing
[2:04:38] there and needed prayer I immediately
[2:04:40] went to praying I didn't go to singing
[2:04:42] and that's okay I'm not I'm not saying
[2:04:44] we shouldn't do that but but everything
[2:04:46] was focused on a Prayer right yes and a
[2:04:49] thought and nobody was standing
[2:04:51] everybody was sit sitting down now
[2:04:53] brother R did the same thing he didn't
[2:04:54] have everybody stand during prayer lines
[2:04:56] everybody sit down the ones that needed
[2:04:57] prayer stood up they come forward what
[2:05:01] then we focused all of our prayer on
[2:05:03] that okay that's what I liked about that
[2:05:06] and it was just a silent it was brother
[2:05:07] Bill used to be he could run around this
[2:05:09] pull pit on the top back when he was
[2:05:11] younger and he'd probably try it now but
[2:05:14] he's he's he's settled down now to where
[2:05:16] he just says hey I'm not going to touch
[2:05:19] you we're just going to pray a lot of
[2:05:20] people don't like brother Bill but I
[2:05:21] like his stand for the word I like his
[2:05:23] stand for the way that he believes cuz
[2:05:25] it's in the word of God I know the word
[2:05:27] of God says lay hands on a sick but when
[2:05:29] are we going to say
[2:05:31] Mountain you don't have to go lay your
[2:05:33] hands on the mountain mountain be moved
[2:05:36] and don't doubt in your heart right I
[2:05:38] know it was the
[2:05:40] blood I know it
[2:05:47] the
[2:05:59] blood it
[2:06:02] was it
[2:06:05] wasel's it was Emmanuel's BL
[2:06:11] for one day when I was lost he di the
[2:06:17] cross it was the blood
[2:06:23] for sometimes when you get down and
[2:06:26] out if he
[2:06:28] has covered you with his
[2:06:31] blood just go read the
[2:06:34] Bible where it talks about the atonement
[2:06:37] the token the blood's been
[2:06:40] applied he shed his
[2:06:42] blood and you'll realize one thing that
[2:06:46] was worthy that man was Worthy amen and
[2:06:49] by the by him putting his red blood on
[2:06:53] your red
[2:06:54] sins red through red is
[2:06:57] white right red through red is always
[2:07:00] you going to get white so red blood
[2:07:03] through your red Sin
[2:07:05] Satan you can't accuse me no more that's
[2:07:08] right now see if you don't have a token
[2:07:10] of your virginity if you don't have
[2:07:13] something to show him if you ain't got
[2:07:15] the token you can't show it right right
[2:07:17] you got to have the token am I like
[2:07:20] brother dick I was thinking the other
[2:07:21] day when you talking about you know the
[2:07:23] brother was talking about yesterday
[2:07:24] about depart from me I never knew you
[2:07:27] see that's what we're talking about
[2:07:28] there was never a relationship there so
[2:07:30] what God's going to do he's going to
[2:07:31] open the
[2:07:33] book and he's not going to see any token
[2:07:37] of some
[2:07:38] person's giving their life their
[2:07:42] virginity to him and he's going to say
[2:07:43] depart from me you're not in the book
[2:07:47] right I never knew you
[2:07:49] because those in Genesis 126 and 27 he's
[2:07:51] had an intimate relationship with that
[2:07:54] is that is his wife that's right that is
[2:07:57] the wife of Jesus Christ that God
[2:08:00] preserved before the foundation of the
[2:08:02] world that's where our names were
[2:08:03] written before the foundation of the
[2:08:04] world and we cannot have him took out he
[2:08:07] can't blot his own self
[2:08:09] out that's right he can't he can't blot
[2:08:12] his own self out
[2:08:14] right and brother Brown said one time
[2:08:17] said I no more die God can die right you
[2:08:20] may take this thing and put it in a hole
[2:08:22] somewhere I'm not dead I'm alive that's
[2:08:25] right I've shown the token of my
[2:08:27] virginity and I you got to bring me up
[2:08:30] but somebody's going to stand there and
[2:08:31] say Satan I'm covered
[2:08:34] completely Mom and Daddy brought this
[2:08:36] thing here but you know what I've been
[2:08:39] chained I've been
