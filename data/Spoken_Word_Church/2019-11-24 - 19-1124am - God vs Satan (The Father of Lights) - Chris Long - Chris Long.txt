«  74       †          So, Life is only by the Word of God made manifest. Life comes only by the Word of God made manifest. As long as it is just in the Book, like this, it still can be questioned. But when it's made manifest, then you see the product of what It spoke of, being manifested, then that is Light on the--on the Word. See? That's what brings... The Word said so, and, then, when it comes to pass, that is Life in Light, Light bringing Life. Light brings Life.
75    Plant the wheat out here, it'll... and put it in the basement, cover it all over, and it'll--it'll never bring forth anything, because it can't. There's no light there. But as soon as light strikes it, then it'll bring forth life if it's a germitized seed.
That's the same thing it is in the Word. See, the Word is God, and when the Life strikes It, it brings It... Light strikes It, it brings the Word to life again. Every age has always been that. Oh, how we appreciate these great things, how that the Word being vindicated is the Light of the spoken Word. See?
God said, "Let there be light."

«  76       †          Now, what if He just said it and no light come? Then we don't know whether it's true or not. We don't know whether He is all right. We don't know whether He is God or not, because He just said, "Let there be," and there wasn't. See?
So then when God speaks and we see it is, then that's the Light that shines forth, the Truth of the Word. See? There is Light and Life.
77    All natural life comes by His spoken Word. And the sun is His spoken Word. He said He created a great light in the heavens, for the day, and a lesser light for the night. See? And all natural life has to come by God's spoken Word. A flower cannot grow without the light of God's spoken Word shine upon it, for the sun is, the s-u-n, is the spoken Word of God, when He said, "Let there be light." See? It's God's spoken life. And no matter...

open the eyes of my [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] same [Music] yes isn't that what we want god bless you this morning it's a real privilege to always be amongst God's children my brothers and sisters in the Lord I don't need to introduce myself to you y'all know me God bless you I'd like to get right into the message if I could you know I'm not known to be long-winded I know I say that but who knows what'll happen this morning I've been preaching on well I you know we use the word series I don't really know if that's the correct word or not because God's Word doesn't have any beginning it doesn't have an end so it's really not a series it's just a continuation and I've been preaching on the conflict between God and Satan at home and I just thought maybe cuz I feel like I'm at home I just kind of continue on I'll do a little background so that you get the gist of where I'm going and and if you take your Bibles while you're standing I want you to turn to the book of James if you would I do have my own glasses this morning so we're a good good shape James chapter one I'll just read verse 17 and when you have it say Amen of course I bring greetings from the the believers and in northern Arizona and my wife also she just couldn't travel with me this time but we'll be back in about five and a half weeks looking forward to it amen you love the Lord alright James 1:17 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning let's pray father we thank you for the reading of your word Lord we wear depending upon your father worried lying on you completely and totally this morning Lord for you to reveal yourself to us father and by that we are given to understand Lord that we will also come to a conclusion of who we are help us this morning lord I pray bless your children and their efforts father wherever and whomever they are for your honor and your glory and the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray and God's children said amen god bless you may be seated now of course I want to thank brother Samuel for having the confidence in me to let me come and minister to you even though he's not here really really deemed that a high honor so now you know I preached under inspiration so I'll just have to kind of feel in the direction I'm going to go this morning but this is this is part of like the greatest battle ever fought and and whether you know it or not or whether you like it or not we're in a fight this morning did you know that it's not all peaches and cream it's a battle it's a battle for the young and the old for the free in the bond for the male and the female it's a battle it's a battle for the believer the make believer in the unbeliever it's a battle we're in it this morning but in in in in God beginning to deal with me on this I thought to myself because of things that are going on around us and in our ranks and of course brothers and sisters you know that when we're preaching to to those of like faith you you you you understand that that the denomination is somewhere way out there on their own but the spirit that caused that denomination it's trying to work in this house this morning that's the conflict now now III I'll start it out like this so you can see where I'm going with this and I'm relaxed I'll take my time that I I the Lord was dealing with me on it and I and I looked at the title the conflict between God and Satan that brother branham priest and I said to myself III believe that I said but it doesn't it doesn't lord help me to understand it because I just I just can't see God as conflicted how can there be a conflict between God and Satan when God is supreme he's the king he's the creator he is everything that there is I mean we wait list let's listen say Smacks we know that Satan is not going to beat God at anything but Satan wants us to think that he's beating God at everything that's that's that's this that's this way of working but then God inspired brother Branham to preach on this and give this a title the conflict between God and say and I said lord help me and as I began to study and preach on it he began to open it up to me and so I'm going to use it like this I'm gonna say that the piano here is God it's not but I just and I'd ask a brother and two brothers to come up but and and any brother in here would like for me to put them over here and say you're the type of God this morning but then I've got to put another brother over here and say now you're the type of Satan this morning and it wouldn't go well nobody wants to be the bad guy so I'm gonna say the piano is the type of God and the keyboard here is the type of Satan you understand so I've got one over here and one over here okay now brother Branham in the message greatest battle ever fought tells us that of course Satan Lucifer chose his his his weapon and God chose his weapon God's weapon was the soul if you want to put it that way or or his his part alright and Satan chose the mind now they are very close together they are so close that it would deceive the very elect if possible and and and the devil knows that because he can read the Bible like you and me all right but we also know that because we also have contact with the Word of God so we realize brothers and sisters that the conflict between God and Satan it's not the way we think God and Satan are not fighting one another because God doesn't have to fight anybody but here's where the conflict is if that piano is God and that keyboard is Satan who's in between it it's a conflict between God and Satan I'm the conflict you're the conflict we are our own greatest enemy now for the sake of time I will give you Scripture and they can put it up on there you don't have to turn to it unless you want to but we realize that Ephesians six six tells us that this is not a fight against flesh and blood so you're not fighting each other Satan wants you to think you are Satan wants you to fight me he wants me to fight you he wants you to fight your neighbor he wants you to fight your your fellow brother or sister the next-of-kin the people you work with he especially would like you to fight with the people you're driving down the highway with somehow that just and it's getting worse it's not getting better but but brothers and sisters that believer begins to realize that they're not fighting against the person who just cut them off on the road once you begin to realize who your enemy really is let me take it like this now just prior to God visiting brother Branham to give him what he needed to preach on the seven seals God first gave him a dream and that was a dream that was a large man and a woman and the man had a three-cornered stick and he was beating on the woman this woman was in tight brother branham's mother and this man was in tight his father it wasn't his mother and father we know that but so then he was given to understand in this dream that this this woman was the church and this man was that Trinitarian denominational spirit that every time she she began to rise up and possibly begin to see the wrong of this Trinitarian spirit in this denominational work he beat her down he beat her into unconsciousness in that very same night that was that was by the way a dream but that very same night God won't brother ran him up early in the morning and began to deal with him on the seals and of course he saw the little birds and then he saw the doves and l.k that's just right at the end of 1962 but there's a key in here you see God gave brother Branham a test did you know that he warned him when he was on hurricane mountain up in the eighth Iran back mountains they said there's going to be a test for you now he didn't tell him what it was what it was he just said there's a trap set so we know that just a few days later he was in some meetings and there was a young couple in the front row towards the front row that were we would as we would say netting making out or whatever they were doing you know they were they were crawling on each other and kissing on each other and patting each other can you imagine can you imagine this morning here in this in this congregation if there was as two strangers came in and sat down in the front row and and started messing around I mean everybody would be appalled where's the Deacons they think they're doing in the house of God in the sanctuary of God oh this is this is what happened and I'm saying this because the conflict that you and I are in has everything to do with this we are not fighting against flesh and blood it wasn't that couple it was the devil who was anointing them you see it's all about the spirit world but we see oh I can't believe they're doing that huh but watched the test of the greatest battle ever fought God told brother Branham they're in your hands come on if they were in your hands if they were in my hands this morning just exactly what would we do get them people out of here you're condemned do you realize what you're doing in the house of God but no brother Branham proved that morning that he was victorious enough to begin to be used by God to receive the seven seals he said I forgive you they weren't just words this was the man coming to an understanding that while that couple was in his hands they could be totally separated from God or they could be given an opportunity now they probably never took the opportunity but that's not up to you and me it's something you and me to find ourselves so wrapped up in God that we could look with these eyes at a situation that is unbelievable practically and say I forgive you he won the battle he won the battle that's mourning and brothers and sisters you and I are in the same conflict today whether we realize it or not we're so I mean I I'm preaching to myself now so I don't don't don't get me wrong but we're so caught up and what we see and we are using that sight for judgment and we've got to stop doing that you see this is a conflict between God and Satan but we are the conflicted not God and Satan thinks he's going to be able to pull this off by the way did you realize that he knows he's the underdog but he believes in something so strongly because the Bible says the devil's belief and brother Branham said this about that scripture sometimes the devil's got more sense than the people that claim to believe God because they tremble the devil's believe and tremble now the problem with the devils that believe is what they believe and how they believe it now brothers and sisters is III and I thought like this as I began in this in this in this group of messages that God is dealing with me on that we're all in this fight together but there's something very unusual about this conflict that is unprecedented and the unprecedented part of this conflict is this is the only battle that I can find where the battleground decides who the victor is not the two contestants think about the parable of the sower Matthew 13 the seed was the Word of God the sower was the son of man but the ground the seed fell on was going to determine whether it brought forth after its kind you with me so the battleground that's me that's you is going to determine who's going to win you see God is already a winner Satan is a loser so you and I are essentially being used to choose the side we'll be on I'm choosing God's side I don't care what it cost me I don't care what people think of me I don't even care what I think of myself because I am my own greatest enemy all right so you got that amen now when I get to this afternoon's service I'll hit the hard point of this because there's there's a part to it that that will open up to us if we can if I can just get through this part so I wrote this down to help me with you because I I don't get to preach three times a week here which is fine I'm just saying at home you know you can just take it and stop and take it and stop and take it and stop so I wrote down this morning as I was meditating if we're going to be victorious then we need to know that we are on the winning side now we should be convinced that God's side is the victorious side then I wrote in parentheses but some aren't some aren't sure of that okay and I say it like that because we've got things going on in our in our in our not use it like this for the sake of you knowing and understanding where I'm coming from the message realm those people on this planet that believe God sent a profit and that profit was William Marion Branham and they could send and sometimes pretend to follow the message all right and that's kind of you know a conflict that's part of what Satan's using because the pretenders eventually come to a spot in their walk with God and in their following of the word through the Bible and the message that wait a minute this isn't working out for me I thought it was supposed to be completely changed and I'm still poor Minotaur or this isn't just working out the way these signs shall follow them that believe enough I don't have any outward signs that I am a believer of Oh Satan's got you right where he wants you he really does now we have to overcome that we have to fight that I have to fight it and you have to fight it remember it's not against your wife or your husband or your pastor or the church member it's not against flesh and blood it's against the Prince of the power of the air that's Ephesians 2:2 now listen real close he's just a prince now a prince somewhere along the way is in the lineage to inherit but if we would look at our modern-day saw we would look over into England where they still have a queen and they still have that royal line we find out that there's a Prince Andrew and a Prince Harry and a princess and a blah blah blah there's all kinds of princes but only one of those gentlemen truly fits the qualifications to inherit the throne even though there are others with the subtitle Prince my wife was telling me that somebody we know is is I don't know what the right word is but taking this King around the country introducing him to message churches this King is from some country in Africa I laughed not much of a king to let some peasant take him around and introduce him to the other believers I'm not looking for that kind of king praise the Lord for his earthly title but there's one king I'm interested in everybody else is a prince don't you find it interesting that the that the greatest warrior of all time Joshua was a general did you know that's what the Prophet called him a general possibly the greatest military mind that walked the earth outside of Christ of course because he's the one who said if you're gonna go to war don't you sit down and try to figure out if you can win it or not has anybody ever done that have you all ever sat down and figured out well I'm in a battle and mmm I wonder I wonder what it's going to take to win I've never done that when God called me and I gave my heart to him I knew I was on the winning side right then I didn't have to keep researching and try to figure out you know just actly how this is gonna work out I believe that because of God's election and if I would stay with it we would win but I find it interesting that Joshua in the heat of battle and a little respite in between battles comes across a man who looks like a man draws his sword and sets the Ru for us marty'll against I want you to notice the humility of God here's a general asking this man a question this man answers I am the captain of the host of the Lord did you notice the humility of God he didn't say I'm a five-star general he didn't say as a lieutenant colonel he didn't say I was an admiral he said I'm the captain of the host of the Lord Wow to me that's tremendous brothers and sisters because God brother branham tells us in one place that that was Jesus Christ in that form Wow you see our battle it's not who we think we are it's who we are now I entitled the message this morning Father of lights because I want to go into how we recognize the enemy and if we can recognize the enemy then we can certainly recognize our God is that right but I'm going to tell you our enemy is somebody that we should begin to understand or the Prophet would not have preached it to us because a lot of folks like us are going to find ourselves like the other folks that I've mentioned in our ranks that all of a sudden after 40 years and 40 by the way is an important number whether you know it or not it's a number of temptation you understand you it's it's it's like a number also of judgment and so forth people are beginning to look at the message that you and I and I and I say this that we believe I could say that that we say we believe but that we believe when they're going while I'm an eye I see a mistake here hmm oh that looks like another mistake oh my goodness there's three I wonder how many there are and you can start to look around through the messages that brother Branham preached then you can begin to find clerical errors and you know errors in our English language and he was a man he he would say one number seven hundred and instead of seven thousand you know there's all kinds of arguments and doctrines over that we're not fighting flesh and blood so one the world are we doing looking into what we consider not we but people consider to be the mistakes of a mortal man brothers and sisters I'll say this with all the confidence in the world the very day that God allowed me to hear the call he'd probably been calling me since I was born I didn't know that but just prior to my 22nd birthday I I said oh something's going on what is it I wasn't raised in a church was raised in the world out on the street come from a separated divorced family kind of wild wasn't looking for God but praise the Lord he was looking for me so thankful that he was looking for me he was looking for you and then when we when finally got to the place in our life inside of ourselves where we could stop for a minute but what's wrong with me that's God you don't read them you didn't realize but that was the call of God saying come home my child you can stop wasting your time and your life and your life's energy looking for me because I'm standing before you and I'm going to meet up with you now you can make this hard you can make this easy for the first 21 and a half years of my life I made it hard and the reason I say that and somebody say what wasn't wasn't my fault that I didn't know no I agree but it would be our fault if we rejected it when he made that call and I said Lord I understand that I'm a sinner I love the way brother Brandon portrays it he wanted to write him a note tack it on a tree that didn't work out finally got into the woodshed or their little garage he said there was a crashed Model A or Model T in there so I had to be a little kind of a garage shed and he said I just want you to know that I've come to the conclusion that that I'm a sinner I can see it I can see that I've been going down the wrong road all of my life and I just want you to talk to me he would say I just I just want to just want to just just want you to know that it was a conflict going huh but God wasn't conflicted God had all the angels of heaven right then doing this praise the Lord another one is answering the call right because all of the angels of heaven rejoice when one more comes in did you realize that you young folks or your middle-aged folks are you old folks that haven't given your heart completely to the Lord yet you want to see a festival you want to see a parade you want to see a party give your heart to the Lord you won't see it with these eyes because Satan is trying to get you to maneuver through your life with these eyes it's a conflict so let me finish this some aren't sure so let's take a look at our adversary do you know what the word adversary means did you know that the word Satan means adversary now remember in revelations chapter 12 we find out that this battle didn't begin down here this battle began it began in heaven right it was a spiritual battle in heaven before it ever dropped down to earth that's why it's still a spiritual battle but listen to the word Satan it means adversary it's taken from the root word adverse now I must say that again it's taken from the root word add verse and you shall not add to or take away from as a matter of fact did you guys know that in one fell swoop Satan using the serpent both added to and took away from the Word of God all at the same time how did he do it because he used the word not which is a negative that he added into God's Word so he both added and took away from at the same time that's why he's Satan because he had verse I just got this from the dictionary the Lord just opened this up to me a person who opposes or fights against another an opponent an enemy ad verse turned opposite to praise the Lord you know how God countered that God countered that with repent because what does it mean I'm going this way now God knows what he's doing you see we're on the winning side if we'll just follow the combat handbook all right can't fail can't fail adverse moving or working in an opposite or contrary direction so we need to take a look at our adversary we need to be able to discern who that is remember that there are two spirits that would be so close that it would to see the very elected if possible one of those spirits is correct and one of those spirits is the adversary but they are so close that they're very hard to distinguish one from the other can I ask you a question how far away is your spirit from your soul it's like me preaching on the on a series I'll just use the word anyway can't find a better one on the foolish and the wise Matthew 25 it says behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him can I ask you a question just how far are you willing to go go ye out to medium how far but when the revelation of Jesus Christ comes to us today we find out that he is here we don't even have to move to go out to meet him because the kingdom of God is within you you see that brothers and sisters you don't have to go anywhere if people are gonna go he's over here in the caves always in this city oh he's in this town always in this movement well praise the Lord he's omnipresent and he's in me he's in you we don't have to rush out and find him because he promised that he would be wherever we are in that day you shall know that I am in the father the father in me I in you and you in me we don't have to go anywhere except in our prayer closet he's right there still with me now remember brothers and sisters you forgive me for cutting us all up but this is a compilation of about 15 or 18 messages those two spirits will be so close that it would deceive the very elect if possible so brothers and sisters it's a spirit it's not flesh and but do you realize you may not realize this I'm gonna break it down into simplicity when you're driving down the highway now I realize I'm talking to a mixed audience not a mixed multitude and that did you realize that some of you caused road rage I know who you are you're the person in the left lane driving 65 when the speed limit is 75 and you refuse to yield has that ever happened to anybody in the room but what happens you know and a few kind names come out you know I become mesial idiot I mean we're not gonna cuss we know that I may but you just frustration just begins to well up yeah I'm saying this for a reason it's a spirit it's a spirit it's not the person driving slow in front of you oh then anoint it I want you to understand they're anointed for what to frustrate come on and I'm using that as a graphic example but that's in every facet you know come on at the grocery store who picks the right wine not me it's eeny meeny miny moe who cares which line you get in it's gonna go slow there's gonna be a sticker missing on there's no price on that there's no and that people are in the one next to you move over do the one next to you and that one starts going faster yours is like it's a spirit you don't realise that brothers and sisters but it's a spirit that's anointing the world okay you see that so then in order for us to be the the the person in the battle against that what do we realize patience what's the hurry okay if they want to plug up the fast lane look for your opportunity to go around him and that's what brother Branham said to do you know he said when you come up against somebody who disagrees with you and you know they're off the word you don't get in their face and start swinging Adam you say Father forgive them for they know not what they're doing and brother branham said you shake their hand passing by that's what you do on the highway you just move around them and then you know who's I'm a fool for Christ who's fly you know that you guys know that remember the two on the sidewalk and then the guy blocking the highway says I don't move for anybody and the man says well I do he just walks around him you know I don't he says I don't move for a fool like you you know you see we're in a battle and brothers and sisters we have the truth we have the endtime message but how are we using it are we using it as a weapon it is a sharp two-edged sword I'll agree with that but it's more like a scalpel it's more like a scalpel than it is some big instrument to bludgeon people with it cuts coming and going God's Word is so powerful that it can cut you as it's going in and heal you as it's coming out and guess what else it does it leaves no scar you see divine healing was a glimpse of that do you realize that we have to believe in divine healing and I remember saying something to somebody recently and they got me I said what we have to love them don't Wayne he looks at me he says haften well I mean I didn't mean it the way that I said it but the way that it came out was he said you mean we have to no no we just do we just do and that's what it's coming down to brothers and sisters we have the most powerful weapon on planet earth as a matter of fact here's how powerful the weapon is in the conflict between God and Satan page 8 down at the very bottom of paragraph 55 don't you think that God see what Satan would be what Satan would do he gave to his children and provided for them the best thing that could be provided for them to knowing what the enemy's attack would be God fortified his children see we take the war when the general goes out to meet another general in war and this general if he's a real true citizen of this nation that he represents and he surely would be to be a general first thing he studies the enemy's attacks that's what we're doing he knows what he's going to do how he's going to work because he kind of went over and spied out I know he's got it up there now good I'm gonna read the next paragraph for a reason we got spies everywhere you know there's American spies in England there's American spies in France and you wonder what's going on in our government today huh there's German spies here and there's no matter how friendly we are we still got spies and we're spying out some kind of a nuclear weapon then we find it take it back to the country then what it is they get ready when war does come they know how to attack their enemy we're in a war so we need to know how to attack our enemy it's not the kind of fight brothers and sisters that we view in our natural realm now we all know that Jesus when you can keep that up there brother when Jesus was tempted in the wilderness brother branham tells us and we see it in the Bible that he did not use one super natural weapon at his disposal that's so unlike you and I when we are looking for every supernatural weapon at our disposal to use God Almighty said but it's also written the best weapon we got but it's also written and it's not just the word in that form what it is is understanding how that word is placed if it's being properly used or misused because Satan quoted him the word forward here he never had an averse so it would didn't look like he was the enemy when they're adding the verse are taking away one you and I say wait a minute that's not what he said but when the enemy is taking the word and quoting it verbatim but taking it out of context misplacing it misconstruing it misusing it oh it gets a little tighter you really have to have a revelation in order to truly understand the use of the word not just the fact that it is at your disposal still with me all right he says paragraph 58 it looks like God knew this great warfare was coming on between right and wrong he knew what the enemy was going to do he knowed just exactly how to equip his people so if we notice the very first thing that God equipped his children was being infinite he knowed what it took to defeat Satan anytime I love this any place anywhere on any conditions I love that that right there tells us we're on the winning side now he wouldn't say listen now he wouldn't say I'll give them something here and then a few years later I'm a study out something better to give them and then after a few and brothers and sisters that's happening I contend that I know brothers who have been preaching this message for 40 or 50 years and they're beginning to think that it's time for us to go back to the Bible watch house doesn't that sound good brother Lewis it's time for us to go back to the Bible I contend brother when did you leave it I don't believe the message of the hour is separate from the Bible I don't believe that if you don't it's okay with me I love you anyway but I will shake your hand and pass you by because I'm not looking to go to the Moon or Mars or Venus I'm not looking for the sputnik to find the center did you realize brother branham told us that that's what Einstein was looking for through his mathematical equations that's what science is looking for sending out these trillion trillion trillion dollar satellites if I could just convince them brother Lewis that what they're looking for is the Welsh revival I'd like 10% of all their spending we'd all be on easy street they're spending trillions of dollars looking for God when God is in his people you see the conflict going on brothers and sisters science is trying to convince us that there's not a God when brother Branham said science only by their own actions eventually proves and we're not looking for proof are we I'm not I just believe it I mean I tell people this and it's not on me I just want you to know the way I think so that you'll understand when I'm preaching to you how I see things the same God that saved me the very same day told me this is my prophet I sent him to you take heed to what he is saying I'm not looking for the mistakes of William Mariam Branham because this message is really not about William Mariam Branham it's about Jesus Christ but God used William Marion random to bring that word I'm not looking for the humanity I got saved from that brother I'm looking for God and God is in his word yes brother Branham was a human being born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies full of trouble in shorter days and you might wonder why I'm saying this this morning I know you believe the way that I believe but the devil in the form of a spirit is going to try to anoint everybody in this room to get them to begin to doubt something somehow some way that's his job and if he can't get you to doubt the letter he'll get you to doubt the postman who brought it it is not the post forgive me brother Wade wherever you're on it is not the postman's fault that he's bringing you a return Reggie receipt letter that you've got a sign from the IRS it might not even be your fault but when you get it man I'm going down to the post office and I'm gonna knock them all out you know you and I don't have to worry about that right the postman do that too they each other they get so frustrated with the negativity that they're involved in so so so you see how the ministry is the ministry is just God's postman delivering a message from God of course we're filled with mistakes God knows that but you know what's really wonderful about the God we serve he don't care because he made a way for us mistake ridden children of his to be perfect in his sight and that's through the blood of Jesus Christ which it won't be long before they begin to remove that you don't realize that brothers is it's a spirit and it's not it's is like well if people say well it's not here brother it's everywhere it's it's not it's not subject to confinement you see God said I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh did me and Joel watch how close this is do you know that when Eve conceived and had cain she's the type of the church what does she say gotten a man now you and I have been informed through God's postman the prophet of God that because all life comes from God Eve said that by that revelation that she had but what was her revelation was it that she had gotten Cain the Lord or that all life comes from the Lord so she could make that statement who how close is that it's really tight and this is me now can I can I be me for a minute I want to give you an akan tension since I'm on the contending for the faith I truly believe that because Cain heard his mother his church say I've gotten a man from the Lord somewhere along the way Cain took that as a vindication want you to think about the way we are now come on we're all men and women and boys and girls from the Lord but what's the revelation of that statement you see what I'm saying and I truly believe now again this is me I want you to it's not a doctrine but I think the way I understand humanity that came began to feed off that and he thought he was righteous in killing Abel because he was a man yeah his mother told him that I got me I got a man and he he probably fought off of that and he said who in the world does this Abel think he is look at my sacrifice look at the beauty of it look at the effort I put in look at the toil look at this look at this as a matter of fact the Bible he's quoting the Bible now this is how sharp he is he says we're supposed to the earth is supposed to bring forth after its kind and we're supposed to tend to it I'm the gardener think about it and he brings flowers and fruit and just a lovely bouquet I imagine that altar was pretty awesome Monet couldn't do it you know what I mean and you know he got raw only because his sacrifice was not as accepted as Abel's you see the Bible tells us that Abel's sacrifice was more excellent oh that rubbed him you see the battle were in brothers and sisters we've got to stop looking with these eyes there is a different eye that God's asking us to use you see when you go to Genesis just leave that up on there brother but when you go to Genesis you find out that the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil was pleasant to the eyes is that right that's Scripture now I'll just be is vanilla as I know how to be but that's the reason why pornography is where it's at the Bible says it's pleasant to the eyes just can't take their eyes off of it I know there's children in here so I'll stop right there but the adults understand you love you I'll go a few more minutes yeah I got this afternoon so are you alright with that so let's go down paragraph 60 but God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon did you realize that you have an atomic weapon because he's the infinite God now seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle god equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition right kind of an attack right kind of everything that they had need of what would sweep them all the way from Eden to the rapture what was it the word the word that's what defeats Satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere any place now why do we want to substitute something else when we've already got the best thing there is the word but the next phase of this message is going to give you a little insight I'll use the word illumination or enlightenment - what the word really is we think it's these letters on these pages we think it's the printing in this book we think it's what we're looking at on the screen and there is a partial truth to that but what really is the word that's where this really gets Nifty all right first of all I'll take that this afternoon let me go here let me find my bits of notes that I have if you'll just bear with me I got him in here oh excuse me I'm getting a little bit more sophisticated brother Joseph Hey he he he text me last night said could you email me your your quotes and your scriptures and I said how in the world I did I text him back how in the world can I email you the thoughts that are in my mind we're getting there but I'm not there yet so I thought of some of the scriptures that I was going to use and I thought of some of the messages that I was going to quote out of and I gave him that much which is certainly not enough do you love the Lord I want you to listen now to what the Prophet is saying to us and to me this is God talking to us not William Branham is God no no now I tell you what brothers and sisters it's come down to this the very words that he spoke well what represent God and if a man is behind the pulpit and God is using him he's on the same that's why he said I'm the captain of the hosts of the Lord captain you mean you only made the rank of captain in the message there's a man who could turn on the light brother Branham says that's the same thing brother that'd be paragraph 75 probably in the middle of paragraph 75 that I gave you there's a man who could turn on the light I'll just start reading it that's the same thing it is in the word see the word is God but remember God's not a bunch of letters the word is God and when the life strikes it it brings it light strikes it it brings the word to life again every age has always been that oh how we appreciate these great things how that the word being vindicated is the light of the spoken word see God said let there be light is that right justice 1:3 now what if he just said it and no light come then we don't know whether it's true or not come on I'm reading the prophets word then we do know whether it's true or not so all of the things that are said in these publications that we believe are God's words let there be light we really don't know if this is the truth or not I'm just reading what the Prophet said now what if he just said let there be light and he said and there was no light come then we don't know whether it's true or not we don't know whether he is all right we don't know whether he is God or not because he just said let there be and there wasn't see now if you could put yourself in the mindset of how brother Branham is bringing this you could begin to understand what the word really is brother Branham says this and other messages it might be in here also God said let there be light and it could have been trillions trillions of years but you see God didn't stop and look over his shoulder every ten minutes and say I wonder if it's gonna happen no he said let there be light and he just kept moving forward because he knew the power of his spoken word was going to in its time produce light behind him that's why the messengers not here anymore because what he said was going to begin to produce if it was the Word of God a manifestation of itself that's why we that's why we love to read John 1:1 so much in that right in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now we might not know if it was so or not but the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and that Word made flesh was based on prophecies for instance like Isaiah now I probably have said this before here but I want to make an emphasis because the devil is fighting us and we don't even know it we think everything is just he's fighting us how well Isaiah said behold a virgin shall conceive can I ask everybody in here how long they think the generations after he said it began to drop off Isaiah said let her be liked oh right I mean behold the virgin shall conceive now there were no doubt because of the recognition of the definition of a prophet people following Isaiah well Isaiah as a man of God I'm telling you you should see what he did he said this and this happened he said this and this happened and he said this and this happened he laid hands on this person and they got well and and there's just cancer fell off and you know you course I'm in fast-forward and all these things happen behold a virgin shall conceive a man it's scientifically impossible but I believe it anyway okay but then the children and then the grand show the great grand now God don't have grandchildren but we do and then the great-grandchildren so one generation to June so how many people were left seven hundred and forty years later do you know that in between the prophecy of Isaiah and one young lady recognizing that it's still true people were dropping like flies think about what this is going on in our agency people are dropping out they're either saying brother branham's God he's not God he comes under the atonement he couldn't be that should settle it right there but there's thousands of things you can say he was a man God used brothers and sisters God is no respecter of persons God wants to use you and me just like he used the Prophet not in that position but in the way that he believed in the way that God's Word could manifest itself through your life even if it's this simple brother branham would mention who brother Branham I don't have a position in the church and and I'm really nobody and I don't have any said but you might produce a child who would produce a child who would be the next Billy Sunday see what I'm saying we wait so so we all have our place in our position we all have our portion in the economy of God but the devil is trying to convince us that were either worthless or were so much we ain't got no room for him I made people like that wonderful people awesome preachers then I think if they just left a little bit of room for Christ man that'd be they'd be incredible but they're so full of themselves there's just not enough room for Christ in there and if there is it's just the tiny little speck and they think like behold the man you've met him I mean I've come across him and then you got people go like brother Joel wobbles eyz hmm I don't know if I'll ever get it done I don't know I don't know if this is gonna work out for me no it's like that old cartoon guy it'll never work I remember the guy in the cartoons and I was like it'll never work he would say he had the wowsie wowsie was apparently but that's not what God wants he wants you and I to come to an understanding of why he did what he did and he did it to express himself through his attributes now can I ask you a personal question who are his attributes so I like that's right I like to say it like this so here's God before the foundation of the world in his own mind before there was a molecule and he's and he is expressing himself through his thoughts and he says I'm a healer I'm going to express that attribute and he asked Jobe where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy before the foundation of the world I'll tell you where he was that he was in the mind of God and this is brothers and sisters worried his attributes I want you to think about this whereas attributes so much so we're so in tune with God why because we came from God and we have gone back to God whether we realize that or not and in that expression of his word I am a savior I am a healer right nobody been sick nobody had been lost how did this all come about people think well God decided that he would make a list of names and put him on a book and then he'd begin the ball rolling so that he could express himself well there's some truth in that but let me tell you a little bit more about God let's get intimate with him in God where his attributes which are you and I so when that great God in his mind said I'm a healer but nobody's sick I can just see one of his attributes and the back part of his mind raise up their hand and go I'll go I'll go down I'll be sick don't not knowing what sickness is I'll go I'll be sick so you can express yourself I'll go I'll be lost but here's the beauty of it because we were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and we knew who he was we knew what we came from we know are we going it's not a problem yeah I don't mind being lost I don't mind being sick because I want him to express himself through his attribute but now we've turned a corner brothers and sisters and God's plan is coming to a close in that portion of it and now we're realizing that we were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and sickness is nothing except the expression of the attribute of healing you with me being lost no problem because we're found see being sick no problem because he provided a way for us to be healed and it's all through faith the most misunderstood action on planet Earth the definition of faith is so against the grain for you and me because the definition of faith is a belief in something for which there is no proof that's why I say prove God I don't have to I believed him I don't need to prove God I believe him must be a tough tablet you're still with me you know what I'm gonna close in five minutes I just love it I just love him let me finish reading that part if this thing turns back on oh it's still working now what if he just said no light verse paragraph 76 then we don't know whether it's true or not we don't know whether he's alright we don't know whether he's God or not because he just said let there be and there wasn't and then when God speaks and we see it then that's the right I want you to get this so when God speaks so then when God speaks and we see it is I want you to notice it doesn't just say we see it it says we see it is then that's the light that shines forth the truth I love this the truth is that what it says the truth of the word wait a minute I thought the word and the truth were one in the same this is the truth of the word you see this is the word but the manifestation of it is the truth of the word that's the reason why brother Branham could get up and challenge everybody I challenge you to find something that God said through me that missed it he did it on every single message practically for you and I it was like well he just keeps saying it over and over and over and over and over and over apparently that's the way God has to work with us human beings because even on the road to emmaus he had to be revisit what the scripture said he was but he started out with all fools and slow of heart see what I'm saying a blessing sisters we've come to a place in the plan of God where we should be surpassing that it's it's it's well beyond the countdown so when God speaks and we see it is then that's the light that shines forth the truth of the word see various light and life all natural life comes by a spoken word we know that son is his spoken word he said it created he said he created a great light in the heavens for the day and a lesser light for the night and all the natural life has come by God spoken word a flower can't grow without the light of God spoken word shine upon it for the Sun the SU n is the spoken word of God when he said let there be light see it's God spoken life and no matter how much people try to say this that or the other it still remains the same you have to have that son so life natural can only come by the spoken word of God and spiritual life here we are eternal life can only come by God's spoken word of life life was the Esso end this time in him as light and in him is no darkness he is God spoken light is that right God spoken word for in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Word was God and it's forever God and it takes the light of God to strike the word to make it live here is what he spoke brother Branham Pat's his Bible now let the light shine amen let the light shine and the light will bring every word to its right position in its season did you get that what season are we in brothers and sisters did you realize that Satan is so shrewd that he declared himself an angel of light the very word Lucifer means light bearer and in first John chapter 1 it says God is light whoo how we gonna know brother here's the light over here and here's a light over here well let me tell you how we know Satan will appear through natural light that you can see with this eye and God only appears when he wants to that's why he allowed his picture to be taken with the Prophet in Sam Houston Coliseum in 1950 now remember that picture brothers and sisters anybody who comes to me and says I see too many mistakes in the message and I I think we have to get back to the Bible huh like I said the first thing I ask is when did you leave the bottle if you've gotta go but you mean to tell me you've been preaching for 40 or 50 years and you've been off the Bible the whole time I don't buy it I'm not looking at that kind of light I'm looking for a super natural did you realize that if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that you have a supernatural light in a cavity in the middle of your heart muscle about the size of my dream everybody well head down to the hospital this afternoon would you and have them cut you open and look for it they won't find it they won't see it yet it's there of course if you have the Holy Ghost and that's what we're looking for I'm not looking for the Holy Ghost through the actions of Pentecost I'm looking for Pentecost actions through me and I'm talking 2,000 years ago I had a man recently tell me that old brother Branham didn't fulfill Malachi 4:5 you see he's like John the Baptist he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children but he hasn't turned the hearts of the children to the father's yet and I said beg your pardon he said you're gonna quote me one and I said no but I'm here to tell you that my heart's already been turned back to the original Pentecostal fathers it's too late you can't feed that to me and I know you represent the same thing please stand thank you for your time it pretty cut up but like a puzzle I can just flip over a few pieces and try to put them together for you there's a much bigger picture than this God's Word had no beginning and it'll have no end but what about the Bible brother it's only 2,000 years old oh I'm not talking about that word I'm talking about the Word made flesh and dwelt amongst us the action of God's Word that's what we're interested in brothers not just the education of God's Word let's pray father we realize Lord that it's not easy father to be able to for me at least father to be able to bring eternal thoughts down into a point in time Lord but father if we could just shed a little light father upon the words that you have spoken Lord so that we could see ourselves in the reflection Lord right now we're we're just seeing ourselves as a shadow of a shadow the prophet of God taught us as that shadow gets closer to the light we began to see the outline of its image we began to understand just kind of what object it is Lord but we're given to recognize father through the message of the hour that we're not just to stay a shadow but Lord were to become the light as you are the light because you're the father of lights Lord we believe that with all our hearts father we realize Lord that the Bible tells us that we become the light as we walk in it Lord I pray father that you'd bless your children and their efforts this morning father for for putting up with me Lord and and the broken words but we realize father that your body was broken for a reason Lord and we can just take one portion of it at a time when we serve the Lord's Supper father realizing that that kosher bread is not the literal body of Christ Lord then neither are these letters on these pages but there is a mystical body of Christ that's developing from them Lord and we realize it's the truth father give strength and encouragement to your children father as we move forward we'll be sure to give you the honor and the glory in the praise in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God's children said again hey man brother brother Terrence god bless you brother sing this song victory in Jesus page 22 I heard a no no story I will save
