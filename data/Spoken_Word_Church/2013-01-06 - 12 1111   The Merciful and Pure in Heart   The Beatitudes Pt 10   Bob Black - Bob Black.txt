TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right we're recording all right we're going to start a little early we we got to be out a little bit early today so got a long pre down I'm looking forward to it all right Matthew 5 Matthew 5 7 and 8 is where we're at blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God and we're kind of looking at both of these together and last time we looked at how in the um in the Old Testament time of the Passover Mercy was given to the pure in heart that wanted to see God and kind of talking about how Mercy can only be given by those who have been filled by the Holy Ghost it's kind of like a um I was reading some of the things that irenius talked about and he used this word vivify and vivify means to Quicken to give power and I got a quote we'll read when we get to what it means to see God about what irenia said about that but to vivify is kind of like what uh you can't um it's like if your if your car if your batteries run dead you got to find another car that has power in it to give power to your car right and uh that's kind of how Mercy is given if you don't have power within yourself to bring somebody to Christ then uh you can you could give food to the poor all day long you could uh do many different things do great works but uh real Mercy is bringing showing somebody how to escape the uh the wrath of God and bringing them to Salvation it it's it's uh one wonderful part of the work of of a Believer is to show show Mercy giving giving food to the poor and different things but if we don't uh if if they don't find Salvation then that's that's the key that's that's what Mercy that's the mercy that I'm talking about and blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God so let's kind of review and John 20 22- 23 Jesus said when he had said this and what what did he say when he when it says and we had said this he right the scripture right before that said uh as the father sent me so send I you and he breathe on them and sayth unto them receive you the Holy Ghost whosoever sin you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins ye retained they are retained that's that's the kind of Mercy that I'm talking about and you don't remit sins like the Catholic Church believes that you just uh randomly uh uh whoever they fits their political idea that whoever fits their mode of operation that agrees with what they agree but if you agree with the word then your sins can be forgiven and uh the way that sins were forgiven in the old in the in the New Testament when Peter came out on the day of Pentecost and said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you line up with the word your sins will be forgiven uh and you'll be made pure in heart and uh so Peter had the the keys to the remittance of sin and after P Peter handed them out on the day of Pentecost then now we we also have the keys right because we know how to enter in and how to how to how to show Mercy to one another whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retain if you show show mercy and has turned down then their their sins are retained God will not override free moral agency right and we were talking last time about uh the mercy seed and how uh in the Old Testament to to receive Mercy they always uh they brought their sacrifice into the um into the inner the inner court and uh always Desiring to come into the holy of holies which they couldn't do but now in in this day The Mercy Seat is in the heart of the believer and to receive Mercy you've got to hear it from somebody else who has their torch lit it's a Living Word uh and judgment always follows mercy and if you don't if you turn down judgment in in this uh you know the Catholics believe in purgatory but brother Rand said that this life here is Purgatory if you turn it down y if you turn it down here then you will be judged by last time we were talking about the Egyptian way believing that there was a your heart will be weighed against an ostrich feather which uh is really uh what a horrible place to be if you turn down the blood the atonement turn down the blood and you want to be judged by what you have done in this life that's exactly what if you go to the white Throne judgment how you'll be judged I saw the dead in Revelations 20 12 13 small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works that's about as much of that little picture I can fit on that screen um but that's what a horrible place to be according to their works and remember brother brand taught uh some works are greater than other works which is it's so paradoxical when when you come to be judged some men will say well look what I did I cast out Devils I did all of these things in your name and Jesus will say well well depart from me cuz I never knew you but then someone else will come and say I don't have anything to offer but they'll have just given one glass of water to a believer One just something simple because they did it to a Believer and just a little table quote I threw out there um somebody I I don't even remember where I got this from but they were traveling with brother Brandon when their car their car broke down and he uh the the this brother from the house came out to helped him fix the car and he went up to the uh to the house where the the man's wife was just to ask her for a cup of water so that she would get the same blessing that he did by help he helped them fix the the car so he wanted her to have that same promise that just giving a glass of water to someone that has that has their fire lit that's man a manifested Son of God would be saved at this day now it's uh such a horrible thing this this to be to to uh to give up the blood covering thisen listen to how horrible that brother brand talks about how horrible it would be need to stand at that white Throne judgment and um let start right here think of it only thing that'll back off God is blood and there's only one blood that he'll back from and that's his own son when he sees that that's his own son's blood he'll back back cuz that's the gift that is God has given to his son to redeem those who he fornew and it brings God back from his judgment but when that blood is removed and all that was forn has been called into the precious body his church has been made ready and taken up then God's Wrath is on the people now listen how horrible this oh brother don't never want to stand there let me stand before a machine gun let me be cut to Pieces let me be saw inch by inch let anything happen as the O oath of the knce of Columbus let them split open my belly and burn sulfur and everything else in me and my arms and legs cut off whatever it may be but never let me stand at that white Throne judgment before God oh let me take this little throne here before the seat of Christ and accept his blood nothing in my arms I bring Lord now that's the kind of Mercy I'm talking about Mercy to help others escape this and if you turn that down Mercy that comes out of someone who's got their fire lit and um that's what's waiting what a horrible place to be weighed by the ostrich feathers really what it amounts to so the pure in heart let's look what it means to be pure in heart because the pure in heart will see God take that bottom piece and push it towards your face that oh that one funny ear my ear my ear T to you first Peter chapter 1 22- 23 seeing ye have purified your soul and obeying the truth through the spirit and the unan love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently a pure heart remember pure means there's just that one thing you don't have any G or bitterness or anything mixed in being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever now that getting into pure and art the reason I read the scripture in the Old Testament about the Passover is because it ties it all together you got mercy and you got what they did was they got 11 out of their house 11 is impurity mixing mixing things in the definition of pure that uh according to strong concordance is clean pure purified by fire and in a medical sense clean um ethically free from corrupt desire from sin and guilt free from every admixture of what is false sincere genuine blameless innocent unstained with the guilt of anything without any extraneous and unnecessary elements wholesome and untainted by immorality perfectly in tune of unmixed origin or descent involving or containing nothing else but just what if it's pure gold is nothing but gold if it's pure diamond it's nothing but Diamond if it's pure word is nothing but word and adoption F said what makes them peculiar you are a holy nation what have you done entered out of that land you're over in another land how'd you get over there that's the promised land what kind of a promise it shall come to pass in the last days sayth God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh by one Spirit we are all baptized in this one promised land with the purity of heart no jealousy no emity nothing I don't care if a brother goes astray no matter what he does you'll go after after him what was the Holy Ghost given for if you're a citizen of the kingdom of God how does it make you act like God does in his kingdom now what does God do in his kingdom it's Holiness righteousness purity of thought purity of mind power and love going to the Lost Healing The Sick performing Miracles doing great things now I'm kind of uh my thought is kind of scattered around we're narrowing it down to purity of heart let's add to our in the stature of perfect man 1962 let's add to our faith these things then that we might come in the full stature of Christ being joined together with Godly love fear of God reverence in our heart to one another deep respect to one another brotherly and sisterly kindness never vulgarity nothing but just the purity of Holy Ghost living see live together be a Christian walk with faith let the virtue of God flow through you let the knowledge God what comes to right and wrong just pure living the 70th week of Daniel now here's where we're narrow it down to Pure in heart you notice uh there's not too much light someone was seen the drawing of it up there said shame on you brother Brandon this great day of Enlightenment a great day of Enlightenment where you can if you have any question you got go out on the internet and ask ask Google to find it for you you can ask anything but at the same time you got all of the message on the computer and you you can ask you find if you have any question uh you can go search it but um you know the devil's got his his copy uh we got we got all of all of this information but see what pure of heart is I said I'll imagine when it's sifted down that that doesn't even do it justice when you get the real pure in heart Born Again of the spirit remember this was the only church age that Christ was put out of his own church of all of them so few that really really want to know about God really want to find his ways and find uh and want to exclude all of the leav from their doctrinal ideas from their uh to to uh destroy their own reason and memory and things and the end time evangelism 1962 uh God's looking for character not membership character elaser when he went to get the Bride of Isaac he sweated it out until he found character remember Abra and put him responsible as God puts us responsible that's right we ministers hunt my bride God bless your heart I ain't looking for members I'm looking for the pure in heart see somebody that will believe the word and that um I think that that sums it up pretty much the pure in heart don't want to take any leav of the world they want to live pure Pure Clean lives because the pure and heart are interested in the UN adulterated word of God right that's what the pure and heart are interested in now you you come get come and get the Holy Ghost and then God continues to purify you through your walk with Christ um a lot you might might have heard Zach got his black belt yesterday and uh I was I of course I started typing a little bit about how the black Bell you know the black belt is kind of like getting the Holy Ghost cuz you uh you think the end goal is to get your black belt and then you're done so you spend uh your uh spend you know Zach's been working on his black belt for 3 years you think once you got once you got the Holy Ghost well that's all I need but the the Holy Ghost has put you right there at Faith and you still got a journey you got to continue to be purified and molded In His Image take all the living out and uh it's a continual process right on up the statue of a perfect man now First Corinthians chapter 5 kind of combines all a lot of the things that we've been talking about mourning uh Purity getting rid of the Leon in your life and so let's kind of read this 1 Corinthians 5 and we got about more minutes it is reported commonly commonly that there is for fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much name as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife and you know for in 1 Corinthians 5 the whole book of First Corinthians Paul is just nailing the First Corinthians and he's really he's telling them you're not mourning you're not doing what you're supposed to do then skip over to Second Corinthians and he tells them you you uh now you begun to Godly sorrow and he tells them how he's proud of them and uh they got rid of the 11av in their lives and and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from you for I verely as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though I were present concerning him that ha so done this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when you are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver such and one un Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus your glory is not good know ye not that a little leth a little leav leth the whole L going back to the the Passover mourning uh getting rid of all of the sin in their life purge out therefore the old Leen that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrifice for us therefore let us keep the feast because the Passover is not just an event that happens every month when you take communion or every uh once a year for the Jews but it's a life Sanctified in Christ a life a life live that's why you take communion because you have communion with God you take the bread because you have received his word and you take the wine because the stimulation of Revelation Reveals His word to you and quickens it so let's keep the feast not with old leav neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and that's what they did in second Corinthians and brother B talked about how this man and and in uh 2 Corinthians 7:12 he talked about how this man uh was restored and of course only a prophet could show us in how in second Corinthians he was restored to bring that out right um what is left Galatians 578 ye did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that cth you little Le leth the whole LP this is the definition of what leav is leav hinders you and it's a persuasion that doesn't come from him that calth you it's a little a little thing that has influence it turns a little thing that slowly begins to take over a little thing that seems like it's not uh not something big but slowly begins to grow and and influence and that over time if you don't check it a little leav leth the whole lump one remember in the beginning one word off is what caused all the problems we have that little 11 caused all of the sickness all of the Wars all the heartache that has ever occurred that's what 11 is Galatians 578 thank you and the pure in heart shall see God let's kind of look at this if you if you're pure in heart and desire to only see the UNL word of God then you'll see him and uh you know brother brand talked about that little that little child in his church that uh uh wanted to see God and went to the mama and the mama said uh uh you need to go talk to the pastor and the Pastor said well no man can see God and uh finally ended up talking to a deacon at brother Brandon's church and he said everywhere I look I see God so and that's what arenus said we'll get to that in a second uh but first let's look at this scripture the this is this is kind of a uh every scripture in the Bible is just worded so perfectly and you know a lot of translations will tra trans will will word the scripture a little differently but Matthew 62223 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thine eye not Thine Eyes thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness now your light the light of the body is the eye the light of the body is a window that illuminates you to be to your the members of your body to be able to walk to be able to communicate to be able to interact with your environment just like the light of your soul the the Eye of your soul illuminates your whole being to be able to uh to see God and if your your eye if your eye is uh the eye of your spiritual being is uh is not single you wanton the things of God but at the same time you're uh eyeing the things of the world um your whole body will be full of Darkness because you can't serve both man and God if therefore the light that is in the be Darkness how great is that Darkness right but the eye if the eye is pure without any living then you will see God right by Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord that's what we sing now arenus on and we'll finish on this quote irenius on seeing God this is kind of a long quote but he he just uh this is what he wrote about seeing God for as those who see the light are within the light and partake of his agancy even so those who see God are in God and receive of his splendor but his Splendor vivifies them remember that's that word that means Quicken gives them power his Splendor vivifies them those therefore who SE God do receive life and for this reason he although Beyond Comprehension and boundless and invisible rendered himself visible and comprehensive and within the capacity of those who believe that he might vivify those who receive and behold him through faith for as his greatness is past finding out so also his goodness is beyond expression by which having been seen he bestows life upon those who see him it is not possible to live apart from life and the means of life is found in fellowship with God but fellowship with God is to know know God and to enjoy his goodness men therefore shall see God that they may live being made Immortal by th sight and attaining even unto God which as I have already said was declared figuratively by the prophets that God should be seen by men who bear his spirit in them and do always wait patiently for his coming and next time we'll look at how we see God in his univers in his word and his people and in his son
