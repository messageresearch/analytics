[4:57] their service today as we try to
[4:59] Minister your words you come and speak
[5:01] to our hearts and minds in Jesus name
[5:04] we're going to Genesis 1 and 1 and then
[5:08] we'll go to chapter 3 in the beginning
[5:18] God created the heaven and the earth now
[5:22] we're just gonna start from there then
[5:24] we'll go over to verse or chapter 3 and
[5:29] we'll start we can start with verse 1
[5:33] and the serpent was more subtil and than
[5:36] any beast of the field which the Lord
[5:38] God had made and he said unto the woman
[5:42] yea hath God said you shall not eat of
[5:45] that ever ye shall not eat of every tree
[5:48] of the garden and woman saith unto the
[5:51] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[5:53] trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[5:56] the tree which is in the midst of the
[5:57] garden God has said it shall you shall
[6:02] not eat of it neither shall you touch it
[6:04] lest you die and the serpent said unto
[6:06] the woman ye shall not surely die for
[6:08] God doth know that in the day you eat
[6:11] thereof that your eyes shall be opened
[6:13] and ye shall be as God's knowing good
[6:16] and evil and the one the woman saw the
[6:19] tree was good for food and it was
[6:21] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[6:24] desired to be make one wise she took of
[6:26] the fruit thereof and did eat and gave
[6:28] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[6:32] the eyes of them both were opened and
[6:35] they knew that they were naked and they
[6:37] sewed fig leaves together now coming on
[6:40] down to the ninth and tenth verse made
[6:44] themselves aprons
[6:46] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[6:48] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[6:51] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[6:53] from the presence of the Lord God
[6:56] amongst the trees of the garden and the
[6:59] Lord God called unto Adam and said unto
[7:02] Him where art thou we'll just stop there
[7:05] because that gets our point of what
[7:07] we're going to do you may be seated the
[7:09] Lord that is blessing to the reading of
[7:11] the word now I've done this in a series
[7:17] and I'm trying we'll be doing it in a
[7:19] series I'm gonna just do a couple of
[7:21] messages but I've done this back years
[7:25] ago and trying to help to understand to
[7:28] me you know the name of God we said well
[7:34] what is the name of God well other than
[7:35] I know God it's God you know God is not
[7:39] a name it's a title to a night it's not
[7:45] a name in being the word g.od as we take
[7:48] it and run it through we say well let's
[7:50] know closely you can make a God out of
[7:53] anything all right
[7:55] you can make a god out of a piano or
[7:57] whatever you want to do ever different
[7:59] things and you it won't come out right
[8:02] but now if you'll take it correctly
[8:05] that's the marvelous point if you'll
[8:09] study the Bible from just a simple
[8:11] little illustration you know I believe
[8:15] it will help you to understand if you'll
[8:19] read the Bible and notice the what
[8:25] you're saying all right we read here in
[8:28] Genesis 1 and it says and God Zod all
[8:32] right that's in a what you call of if I
[8:36] get these wrong you put it in the right
[8:37] place and all but that's more of a
[8:39] lowercase form because even though the G
[8:43] is in okay but the EO and the D is in a
[8:47] smaller case so it's a lower case so
[8:51] even when you start off in Genesis you
[8:56] start off with the basis of having to
[8:59] depend upon
[9:02] the rest of the word to be able to come
[9:06] out to understand what's taking place
[9:08] because it's about 30 something times
[9:11] they're in Genesis 1 that it uses the
[9:14] word God all right and that word God now
[9:18] is the word Elohim ok
[9:23] which means self-existing okay alright
[9:28] so now that's what we're doing is trying
[9:31] to put it into a point to understand and
[9:33] to get it in the right order and then
[9:38] even the children should be able to
[9:40] understand you know the things of
[9:44] looking at the Bible because you know we
[9:47] talk about it we say well well God is
[9:49] not a name we'll see they're told and
[9:51] they'll say God the name of God or
[9:54] something like that but that you know to
[9:57] us we understand that that's meaning
[10:01] that that was the way they've done it
[10:04] when they wrote the Bible and they just
[10:08] wrote the word g.od all right
[10:11] whether you would have had that in a
[10:13] total upper case is we'd call it with
[10:16] the Geo and a big deal on the end of it
[10:19] or big letters or whatever you know it
[10:22] all will come out to the same meaning
[10:24] because the Jehovah the old is the Jesus
[10:27] of the new there's just one God all
[10:31] right now so then you start in your
[10:34] looking at it and you say well now what
[10:37] is the name of God you know
[10:41] alright so now children we say what God
[10:44] is not a name daddy's not a name
[10:48] father's not a name you know those are
[10:52] titles to a name alright so there in
[10:56] Genesis 1 you have it seemingly God help
[11:04] me with it cuz I'm trying to break it
[11:06] down instead of having a long series I
[11:08] remember this from years ago that I
[11:10] talked on this
[11:12] and I'm putting it in to a point that I
[11:14] hope you will understand and listen to
[11:17] my point now to your adults and
[11:19] understanding of what I'm saying where
[11:22] we ended in our message dealing with and
[11:26] they without us cannot be made perfect
[11:28] etc etc we wound up coming down to the
[11:32] Godhead as being not complete without
[11:36] you and me right you remember that's
[11:41] what the Prophet says that it's not
[11:42] complete without you and me the Guardian
[11:44] one because you're part of God all right
[11:47] so then when you come down to that basis
[11:50] it'll come to the point of understanding
[11:52] how beautiful it was back there and what
[11:55] happened in Genesis in God riding the
[11:59] word all right now and you put him in
[12:03] there and writing the word and he wrote
[12:06] all of the things but then it's so odd
[12:09] that once he spoke of the creation
[12:13] brought it out about the creation you
[12:15] know the Genesis and the account of all
[12:18] the things in and we pray well God
[12:21] created all things all right now so that
[12:26] word there is Elohim instead of using
[12:31] the word God so you can read it like
[12:33] this in the beginning
[12:35] without him Elohim was without him and
[12:38] Helen was L ahem going over to John one
[12:41] see and bringing it back to Genesis 1
[12:43] alright and thinking about the in clear
[12:48] up in a minute now what I'm trying to do
[12:50] all right but did you notice now we read
[12:53] in Genesis 3 you just got through with
[12:58] the creation of mankind everything and
[13:00] then you jump to Genesis 3 and look what
[13:05] it says look what happens in Genesis 3
[13:07] if they'll pull that one up
[13:09] we'll hit and pull up Genesis 3
[13:17] you'll notice it is it uses an
[13:20] outstanding thing to statement it talks
[13:23] about the serpent talks about the things
[13:25] and it says in the field that the Lord
[13:31] God had made all right now then it keeps
[13:39] continuing on talking it gets up to the
[13:42] back of the tree gets up to talking
[13:43] about serpent and all of the different
[13:45] things and it's using the Lord God and
[13:51] understanding and you've just you've
[13:53] moved two chapters in your Bible and now
[13:56] it's got Lord God you say well what does
[14:02] that mean to us alright
[14:04] see when they were translating the Bible
[14:10] Translators are supposed to translate by
[14:13] words I say supposed to because
[14:16] naturally some of their thoughts is
[14:18] going to enter but they're not supposed
[14:20] to be translating by revelation and when
[14:23] they was bringing down the Bible to us
[14:26] especially toward the English
[14:29] understanding you know and bringing it
[14:32] down to that then you see that something
[14:35] happened here and they use Lord God and
[14:40] it stays in that form throughout the
[14:46] whole Old Testament basis to use the
[14:50] word Lord God all right and see that
[14:54] means something has happened to the
[14:56] understanding of the person who was to
[14:59] put down what was going on and in
[15:03] Genesis 1 it can be easily understood
[15:06] that that's out of him that was the only
[15:12] way they could come up with anything
[15:14] because the L of him would have within
[15:17] it the all of the understanding about
[15:22] the name of God brother Branham says you
[15:27] can literally translate there in Genesis
[15:29] and say if I said
[15:31] the beginning Elohim created right
[15:34] because that's who is talking about but
[15:38] now tell him then still itself now is
[15:41] coming forth as a title because it's not
[15:46] a full meaning of a name it's more of a
[15:50] title to a name all right
[15:53] and see that's why it's changing from
[15:55] Genesis 1 and using it 30-something
[16:00] times and then you get to Genesis 2 it
[16:03] uses it and then you get to Genesis 3
[16:05] and then you got it from then on
[16:07] throughout the the Bible that it'll use
[16:09] and it'll say Lord God alright if you'll
[16:14] go back if you want to you can pick up
[16:15] from Scofield gives you a good
[16:18] understanding cause he's a theologian
[16:19] and read his point dire and brother
[16:22] Branham says let's see where's that
[16:25] you'll get number three though they will
[16:28] know that brother Branham was tied this
[16:29] together just bring in number three this
[16:33] is taken from be not afraid all right
[16:36] someone said to me not long ago said
[16:38] brother Branham you don't believe that
[16:39] that was actually God's standing guard
[16:42] aiding a cave I said I sure do Abraham
[16:45] called him
[16:46] hello him do you know Abraham called him
[16:54] el ahem anyone knows that that's capital
[17:02] lor demon Richard was talking about that
[17:04] yesterday that the jeffersonville didn't
[17:07] pick that up that should have been
[17:09] capital letters over there you know
[17:11] because brother Ron said
[17:12] capital L Ord all right that's all kinda
[17:15] but C translated into the Greek Elohim
[17:18] which means a self existing one
[17:21] all right now the word Lord comes from
[17:28] the word Jehovah okay so now you've got
[17:34] a beautiful situation to coming in to
[17:37] Genesis 2:3 going on that when it uses
[17:40] Lord God its jehovah l ahem
[17:45] alright now watch the point what is
[17:48] Jehovah the Elohim means self-existing
[17:51] etc all of the think all of the titles
[17:54] of tie together to ela him and come out
[17:57] to be the correct understanding of the
[17:59] name of God even when we get to the name
[18:01] Jesus okay all right
[18:04] because don't worry about it you can
[18:06] take the name Jesus and run it backwards
[18:08] and you can run it all the way and it'll
[18:10] come totally out into the Old Testament
[18:12] and come to the words your Joshua comes
[18:15] out to be the name of translating from
[18:18] there down to get to the Jesus okay now
[18:21] but listen one combat see now you've got
[18:24] Lord God your Elohim is fine because
[18:30] you've got that understanding okay and
[18:35] all the titles will be related to
[18:38] Jehovah I mean to Elohim and it comes
[18:42] from Jehovah now you know yourself
[18:43] there's seven compound names of Jehovah
[18:45] right Joe Vijaya Jehovah kiss can you do
[18:48] over sale on all of those comes from the
[18:52] name Jehovah alright now it's your over
[18:55] translated into English understanding is
[18:59] like a father with his family now that's
[19:05] what your your Jehovah stands for our
[19:08] hour comes to the point of understanding
[19:10] it's like a father with the family so
[19:15] he's Jehovah l of him he is the
[19:19] self-existing Almighty God that drew
[19:23] Lord Himself down toward the human race
[19:28] begin to the writing of the Bible and
[19:31] when it does immediately the
[19:34] understanding that is brought into that
[19:36] the writers pick that up and they say
[19:39] wait a minute this word God here is okay
[19:42] here but now we've got another word now
[19:46] I don't know what those words are cause
[19:48] I'm not a Greek you know I just have to
[19:50] stay with what we can do with the
[19:51] English language and that's bad enough
[19:53] all right what do you follow what I'm
[19:55] saying so you can say well
[19:58] al ahem we can use that as the word God
[20:01] so we can reference throughout the Bible
[20:04] and use Elohim God you can come over to
[20:10] Hebrews one God in sundry times and
[20:15] diverse miners spoke to the fathers
[20:16] known in the New Testament coming up
[20:19] still with the word God using it as
[20:21] Elohim the self existing one all right
[20:28] but remember what self existing means
[20:31] existing by yourself so had he stayed
[20:35] with Jehovah I mean excuse me and he
[20:38] stayed with just a word that they used
[20:41] to bring out Elohim see the you and I
[20:45] wouldn't have never come into being
[20:46] nothing would have come into being are
[20:49] you with me
[20:50] you see why that is if this takes months
[20:52] for me to try to break down a thought
[20:55] for you to see but we will try to do it
[20:58] real fast but you get to point out you
[21:01] see Elohim has all the relationship to
[21:06] everything that you want to talk about
[21:09] in front of Ron centers now then he
[21:11] brings it up a notch to Jehovah and he
[21:15] says Jehovah the old is jesus of the new
[21:20] alright now what is jehovah's are saying
[21:23] means a father with his family so now
[21:27] what have you got Jehovah Elohim which
[21:30] means the eternal God now exists with
[21:33] his creation and that's exactly what he
[21:36] done in Genesis 1 God Himself the great
[21:44] Elohim the self existing God lowered
[21:49] himself to start the writing of the
[21:53] Bible all right and it writes and he
[21:57] comes over and he covers all the whole
[21:59] creation okay then when you jump over to
[22:04] chapter 2 or 3 you start picking up
[22:07] another name in there and they said the
[22:09] writers had to give an understanding
[22:13] so they they brought it down to as I
[22:16] said jehovah l ahem alright now you can
[22:20] take it to Jehovah Jireh
[22:22] Jehovah tsking you you could take that
[22:24] word Jehovah and it'll run through the
[22:26] seven compound names of Jehovah and when
[22:29] you're coming through the Old Testament
[22:32] then you say well Jehovah is this not
[22:36] know Johor it's not a nine you say oh
[22:40] you're you're confusing us God's not a
[22:42] name then we get out of him that's not a
[22:45] name now we get Jehovah and that's not a
[22:49] name because there's one scriptures
[22:54] Isaiah again that's the forgotten brain
[22:58] but if you're talking to a Jehovah
[23:01] Witness and they tell you the name of
[23:02] Jehovah was Jehovah you know the name of
[23:05] God was Jehovah just tell them the Bible
[23:07] says by my name is your whole words I
[23:09] never know the scripture that's he said
[23:14] I say all things by my name Jehovah
[23:16] words I never known he was never known
[23:18] as Jehovah Joel was not the name of God
[23:21] Jehovah is a title to a name Elohim is a
[23:26] title to a name Yahweh get into all of
[23:29] those things that people pick up and
[23:33] bring forth and it has to that's
[23:36] meanings to it what the meaning is is
[23:39] you've got a little understanding here
[23:41] that defines this person that you're
[23:45] describing you're describing him as well
[23:48] ahem self-existing that's good but now
[23:54] you've got himself existing if it's self
[23:58] existing is correct that means nobody
[24:00] didn't exist with it right so now you
[24:04] got a problem you're all left by
[24:06] yourself all right so the old that you
[24:09] know they understanding from Genesis 1
[24:12] brings you to the understand that Elohim
[24:16] and who he is Genesis 2 3 then it starts
[24:21] over and what it does it brings out to
[24:24] understand
[24:25] Jehovah our Lord God all right now I
[24:34] want you to notice something so that
[24:35] you'll keep it so pull up number one
[24:37] brothers no I'm using us to those on the
[24:42] internet and everything
[24:43] I use a Scofield Bible mine is a 1909
[24:47] because I always have used the 19 not
[24:50] that's the earliest Scofield or any of
[24:53] them Scott you can't you can't go now
[24:55] and buy a 1611 Bible I don't know of
[24:58] anywhere you can order one from you
[24:59] can't order it I tried to order 1611
[25:02] from Scofield publishing part you know
[25:06] getting down to where they the publisher
[25:08] you can't do it all right but look in
[25:13] the beginning g.o.d now that has the
[25:24] meaning of self existing but it's still
[25:30] not his name alright god unveils further
[25:35] into starting in Genesis two and three
[25:39] and when he does he uses the word Lord
[25:43] God the translators knew something was
[25:49] being said this is a description see
[25:55] when you say God created the heavens and
[25:57] the earth
[25:57] alright whose God is it my P Anna no is
[26:04] it my car
[26:06] no it's self-existing that's as best as
[26:11] you can do that's the best meaning of a
[26:15] word can be broke outside of the name of
[26:19] Jesus because Jesus is his name right I
[26:23] don't get tired of that point then you
[26:25] just remember it we'll get back to it
[26:27] next week Jesus is his name who watches
[26:30] what's the name of God Jesus it's not
[26:34] Jehovah it's not out of him it's not all
[26:37] that all of those titles
[26:39] and references comes to the name of
[26:41] Jesus right because that's that's his
[26:47] nothing but look what it said these are
[26:49] the generations of the heavens of the
[26:50] earth when they were created when I he
[26:54] created you
[26:57] God created Genesis 1 Genesis 2 says the
[27:02] Lord God created are you listening see
[27:09] that means if something was interrelated
[27:13] here more than what was up here in
[27:15] Genesis 1 now you've got something to
[27:18] understand where and you come up with
[27:21] the word Jehovah now you've got your
[27:26] hova el ahem
[27:31] because remember Genesis 1 brings up the
[27:36] creation of man the creation of every
[27:39] time right come on
[27:43] the creation of everything is covered in
[27:45] Genesis 1 even to the creation of man
[27:48] even to his physical creation and his
[27:51] spiritual creation made in the image of
[27:53] Almighty God right that's in Genesis 1
[27:59] because that's the self existing because
[28:01] once he moved and they picked this word
[28:04] up and said well we've got to put this
[28:06] word Lord in here and when the
[28:08] translators looked at that they said
[28:10] we'll wait a minute
[28:13] we've got to get an understanding so
[28:16] they said now what can we do with Lord
[28:20] so they come up with the jehovah huh
[28:26] now you got your over el ahem which
[28:30] means you've got a father with his
[28:31] family there's families in Genesis 1
[28:35] come on we're supposed to be in the
[28:38] message enough to understand you've
[28:40] heard Wade preached for a whole lot of
[28:42] years I hope you understood that of
[28:45] Genesis 1:26 and 27 you know let us make
[28:48] man in our own image and let them have
[28:50] dominion etc etc
[28:52] see you're standing in Genesis 2 looking
[28:56] backward but you're picking up and when
[28:59] they brought it into that a word appears
[29:02] and I said I don't know how to express
[29:04] these things I just try to get you to
[29:07] look at something but see they wound up
[29:11] and they say okay now we've got it
[29:14] Elohim is not a name Jehovah means
[29:21] father with his family that's getting a
[29:24] whole lot closer to a name but y'all was
[29:28] not a name Jehovah is like Elohim it's
[29:33] the title to a name that's why you're
[29:36] Jehovah Witness say well we're Jehovah's
[29:38] Witnesses I told one of them one time I
[29:40] said I'm a greater to your over witness
[29:41] than you are he looked at me and he said
[29:44] you are I said yeah cuz I believe that
[29:46] you're over the old Jesus or the new and
[29:48] he one of them started to the car the
[29:53] other one wanted to talk and the one in
[29:55] the cars kept saying come on because he
[29:58] doesn't run into something that was
[29:59] crazy to him for somebody to Sejal over
[30:02] the old of Jesus of the new you know I
[30:05] guess he figured out mindful to get out
[30:07] of here but there's this simple point
[30:10] and what I want you to look at how can
[30:13] you how can you fathom I guess is the
[30:17] best word for how can you fathom the
[30:19] name of God how can you understand the
[30:21] name of God see you've got to come to
[30:29] that word they used and translated the
[30:33] word Jesus you've got to come to that to
[30:40] be able to have one true and living God
[30:43] now get what I'm saying did the prophets
[30:45] a Jew over the old is Jesus of the new
[30:49] he said it's the self same person
[30:51] he said there's not another person
[30:52] involved see so when ello when you take
[30:56] Elohim and put your over with it that's
[30:58] not another person that's what I'm
[31:02] getting you to see Elohim Genesis one
[31:04] created
[31:06] Genesis 2 says Lord God created 2 and 3
[31:13] both used Lord God and it uses about the
[31:15] creation so then you're looking at
[31:20] something that is understood by
[31:22] Revelation to see and we've got the
[31:26] Prophet to back up what we're talking
[31:28] about to understand and he says now that
[31:32] word out of him is capital L Ord ok g.od
[31:45] when it starts in Genesis is not used in
[31:49] a capital form
[31:51] now I've bummed this and hollered and we
[31:54] went to it life's not me and Richard did
[31:56] and we had it all going to weigh in
[31:58] known and then we lost our way and I
[32:00] didn't have my notes to go back to I got
[32:03] him but I could never find I couldn't
[32:05] find him but anyhow we went back to find
[32:08] out something that was a marvelous thing
[32:11] see when you use the g.od that's a
[32:16] lowercase but what if I can show you
[32:21] that the Bible uses g.od in total
[32:28] capital lot you're gonna have to agree
[32:33] there's just one true and living God you
[32:36] think this ain't into the Godhead do you
[32:38] want to talk well we're talking about
[32:39] the Godhead
[32:40] this is getting into the Godhead this is
[32:42] what I love this is what I love to talk
[32:44] about and show how he come down to worry
[32:48] where we are for us to understand you
[32:51] realize he had to do that he had to
[32:53] condescend the self existing one that
[32:59] existed before the world he condescends
[33:06] to be Jehovah Elohim a father with his
[33:13] family
[33:16] then you can wind up see that jesus'
[33:18] isn't angling to get let's see look at
[33:20] it look what they do in genesis tuna
[33:23] they know they still got this l of him
[33:27] the translators he knew they had their
[33:30] word god that was the word God from
[33:32] Genesis one so they know to keep that
[33:35] but they pick up Lord and that's lor D
[33:39] capital letter C because you're getting
[33:46] closer to the name I have to use it
[33:51] anyway cuz it's only in I know how no
[33:53] education see I'm sorry I'm ninth grade
[33:55] in them I can't help that but I'm just
[33:58] do the best I can to try to speak by
[34:00] revelation and I keep referencing back
[34:03] to what the Prophet said because that's
[34:05] where I got it from I didn't have enough
[34:07] sense to get the rest of neither did the
[34:09] scholars the scholars got enough now the
[34:11] scholars know you doubt him study
[34:13] Scofield he'll tell you a whole list of
[34:16] line about Yahweh and Anna Donna and a
[34:21] Donna and he's gotten many many many
[34:23] things he covers the seven compound
[34:26] names of Jehovah Scofield covers them if
[34:29] you want to study it from just looking
[34:30] at what he's saying but see you're
[34:34] trying to come down to an understanding
[34:38] okay
[34:39] so you've got Lord Capital Lord you
[34:52] pick it up and you keep that capital
[34:53] Lord I know how time to do it I got a
[34:55] lot of the notes linen but you pick that
[34:58] up and you keep that Lord God now I want
[35:02] to give you a key if you'll just take it
[35:04] and listen when God is speaking from
[35:11] heaven are you in the when God is
[35:18] speaking from heaven now if you don't
[35:21] believe me you go read your Bible go
[35:23] over there and read where God come down
[35:24] and talk to even to Cain where God come
[35:29] down and talk to Abel and God came down
[35:33] and talked to Abraham if you look at
[35:38] that word lor D you'll find it appearing
[35:42] in your Bible form all the way through
[35:45] as showing you God is speaking to
[35:50] mankind God is revealing himself maybe I
[35:55] better use the word like that instead of
[35:57] speaking to man so-called speaking is
[35:59] hard to understand but I'm just giving
[36:01] you that that even came in the bad
[36:04] situation it was he never came down he
[36:08] came down and still was signifying
[36:10] toward the Cain that Cain now listen
[36:14] this is gonna go and I'm just putting
[36:16] this in but you know yourself a lot of
[36:18] people in the message believe Cain
[36:20] couldn't be saved now I differ with that
[36:21] I differ with that because of all the
[36:25] whole Bible in the prophets message the
[36:29] Bible says he said to Cain he said if
[36:31] you would have done like your brother
[36:33] who was talking who was talking to Cain
[36:39] Almighty God Jehovah because at that
[36:43] time until Cain done what he done Cain
[36:46] was still a child of God right because
[36:52] we're all children of God
[36:54] don't try to get no serpent seed lines
[36:57] in these things with me that won't work
[36:59] we're all the children of God
[37:05] Cain was just as much a child of God as
[37:08] able as far as the physical human
[37:10] element the difference is when he showed
[37:15] his color and he went and killed his
[37:18] brother right but get what I'm talking
[37:22] about look at that word Lord and keep
[37:27] that as you study your Bible how many it
[37:30] remembers this how many remembers the
[37:32] first time you got you got into the name
[37:34] of Jesus you'll remember that when you
[37:36] started in the message you know how that
[37:38] you all you you knew that the name of
[37:41] Jesus and water baptism etc and every
[37:44] time you looked in the Bible in the
[37:45] determining they said something about
[37:47] tonight you remember that in every tire
[37:51] you turn it was something not to name I
[37:53] mean you'd be over here in Old Testament
[37:56] and they say something about the name
[37:58] you come over here to say something bout
[37:59] the name a way of illustrating is a
[38:03] crazy one but you go by you a purple
[38:08] Cadillac and you go driving down the
[38:15] road thinking I got the only one I got
[38:22] this some special I got the only purple
[38:25] Cadillac about that time meet me and God
[38:28] goes by and there goes another purple
[38:29] Cadillac right that's the way God he is
[38:33] he deals with all of us the same
[38:37] don't worry about whether your serpents
[38:40] eat or not
[38:40] I don't care if I could learn run my
[38:43] lineage totally back and put it straight
[38:45] there with the Beast I wouldn't have
[38:47] anything to do with it because my
[38:48] salvation is not based in that my
[38:50] salvation is based in the Lord Jesus
[38:52] Christ
[38:53] and what he'd done for me you understand
[38:58] what you see so you got Lord God Jehovah
[39:04] el ahem you've got the bouquet
[39:08] signifying who this is the person
[39:15] remember Lord God now what did we have
[39:18] Lord Capital lor did he
[39:21] slice it back well they'll make sure it
[39:23] stays in your memory now if you don't
[39:25] you lose it you say so you see one comma
[39:27] Lord God Joe Vella him of so case did he
[39:32] use in that lower case because he has a
[39:35] reason I'll get to that in a minute and
[39:39] Macias Lord God so it appears our
[39:42] throughout the Old Testament and Lord
[39:43] God David it speaks when it comes to him
[39:46] and the Psalms and everything it uses
[39:48] Lord God Jehovah Ella him but now let's
[39:56] throw a little key in a lot of people
[40:00] would call it a cogwheel but I call them
[40:01] a key go to Genesis go to number or
[40:09] excuse me
[40:09] go to number four number four now watch
[40:20] sometimes appear and remember when you
[40:25] come up to something and when they had
[40:27] to put a name or thought or whatever
[40:29] they had to have it related to the
[40:32] entire Bible so I look at not now excuse
[40:36] me we need to yeah that's okay we using
[40:39] him before yeah which jumps all the way
[40:43] over to Abraham and Ray broom and look
[40:47] what it says and Abram said Lord God he
[40:57] drops to a lower case but he raises to a
[41:01] higher case to signify that he knew what
[41:10] he was talking about he knew who he was
[41:13] talking to you remember in songs where
[41:17] it said the Lord said unto my lord look
[41:21] that up you'll find Lord in great big
[41:24] capital said unto my lord the lowercase
[41:28] you come to Abraham you come to
[41:31] understanding now this is just not a
[41:35] father with a family this is a
[41:39] revelation of Almighty God and it comes
[41:44] down to a capital letter all the way Joe
[41:51] and if you understand your whole were
[41:55] the oldest Jesus of the new you
[41:58] understand that then that's exactly what
[42:00] it's doing but look what it said the
[42:02] Lord Abram said Lord now Abram said that
[42:05] himself cuz he he was signifying
[42:07] something he knew who he was talking to
[42:17] right this is when he gets all nowhere
[42:21] you remember you were supposed to been
[42:22] in all of that with white understudy
[42:24] okay going down to go to verse 6 and
[42:35] we're save reading and he believed in
[42:38] the Lord
[42:40] now while ago he had lowered in a
[42:42] lowercase I'm screwed now you got it bad
[42:47] and he believed in the Lord and it came
[42:51] out he counted it unto him for
[42:52] righteousness and he said unto him well
[42:56] who's talking now
[42:59] and he said unto Him God speaking to
[43:03] Abraham look I am the lord that brought
[43:06] thee out of the earth child needs to
[43:08] give thee this land to inherit it and he
[43:12] said Lord God whereby shall I know that
[43:17] I shall inherit it did you notice
[43:20] something over here you had Lord God now
[43:31] you got Lord in front in the lower case
[43:36] but you get God in a higher case
[43:39] upper case whatever your English majors
[43:42] are you just put all of it in order and
[43:45] it'll get to point but you notice that
[43:51] they're in Genesis it can go backwards
[43:54] and forth okay go ahead - go ahead -
[44:07] number six boat number six which is
[44:14] taken from Genesis 28 20
[44:17] lower case is the God lower case of
[44:23] salvation unto God upper case the Lord
[44:30] belong the issues from death spell it
[44:35] the same way right in one sentence
[44:38] lowercase uppercase so now here's where
[44:43] we're gonna have to take and we'll try
[44:45] to do this real quick what you see when
[44:51] the key is one thing when you realize
[44:55] that Genesis 1 God had condescended to
[45:07] write the word God himself had
[45:15] condescended to write the word as long
[45:19] as you're dealing with God that away you
[45:22] can use that word God and this is fine
[45:26] you can put it in capital or you put it
[45:29] in lowercase because it means assign the
[45:33] self existing one is talking to you but
[45:38] it's like it is with Cain are with Abel
[45:40] or whatever it says the Lord
[45:47] they even speaking to K the Lord said to
[45:51] Cain he had not told him away he was
[45:56] still his child until sin entered the
[46:00] picture but when sin entered the
[46:02] pictures we came then he fell away from
[46:04] sonship right see as long as God is
[46:13] speaking to you and I he can speak
[46:17] through somebody a minister or to one
[46:22] another a sister to a sister a brother
[46:25] under the anyone whatever and you can
[46:28] talk about the Lord and God can use your
[46:31] voice to declare his understanding to
[46:39] Cathy from right right but you can also
[46:44] switch and go from right to Cathy see we
[46:49] want it that way so we want to man for
[46:50] no it's not necessary
[46:52] that's what I'm getting at because you
[46:57] get on over into their new house Sarah
[46:58] go through your Bible and read yeah you
[47:01] have say run you're how Hagar and C we
[47:04] throw Hagar out the door right we just
[47:07] say that that Hagar was a remember God
[47:14] provided her in that child water and put
[47:20] him right back into lineage and that
[47:23] lineage stayed there after then right
[47:26] back in with Sabra Hagar Ishmael Isaac
[47:31] playing together may be older than the
[47:34] other one get what I'm saying
[47:38] you said well I talked to the Lord this
[47:41] morning that's good what you see if
[47:48] Donny is my Lord see you go back to you
[47:51] go back you got to pick this up and get
[47:52] the point if you want it I got it at
[47:56] home I've got an original 1611 King
[48:00] James I mean
[48:01] 16:11 version King guy yeah it has all
[48:05] of the books in it that was rejected out
[48:08] of the book of macabees there's two
[48:10] books we've gotta know you've got to
[48:12] Eton's you've got different different
[48:16] things that was left out of the King
[48:17] James version of the Bible now remember
[48:20] the King James Version let's get a
[48:21] little sensible about it but you laugh
[48:23] at my carnality the King James Version
[48:27] is not American English it was King's
[48:33] English thousand dollars and dollars and
[48:38] Watts and all of the things and you
[48:40] can't even hardly read it I'll be glad
[48:42] to loan you mine you can sit down and
[48:44] read it it's in the Old English language
[48:47] it's not into American English that was
[48:52] translated later or put on over into
[48:57] what we call this common English that's
[49:03] why have you ever heard brother Ron say
[49:04] who was he talking about but he said the
[49:07] the man that what's-his-name the writer
[49:12] the one that he likes and he put out the
[49:14] Bible you know that man said the Bible
[49:19] was written in in Arabic allo Yiddish
[49:24] common ordinary people's understanding
[49:31] see if we'll take the Bible and think
[49:34] about it if you're listening the Bible
[49:37] is put into our language from the King
[49:40] James Version of the point of the Old
[49:43] English language that they used does
[49:49] that make sense or is that bumfuzzled
[49:51] you see we've got it where it was passed
[49:57] on down from the regular King's English
[50:01] you want to get in some Kings English go
[50:04] to Jamaica but they speak perfect King's
[50:07] English go to when it's it's in Brazil
[50:12] when they speak in English
[50:14] but especially in the Philippines get a
[50:17] lot of them they speak good keen English
[50:20] good language they don't used irons were
[50:23] over here and over the HAR and what you
[50:26] are you add you know let see we say well
[50:34] I've gotta talk to people they say I've
[50:36] got a 1611 King James Version short to
[50:44] me that's Schofield 1909 was the first
[50:56] one 1611 was your King James Version you
[51:02] had him up until I was allowed to get
[51:05] them and I lost one of them
[51:06] but world-- used to put out a King James
[51:09] Version which left out all of the Book
[51:12] of a khabees all of the thing mine's
[51:14] about this thick because it's got all
[51:17] those books in it that was left out of
[51:19] the Bible now you know how the King
[51:21] James Version came into being
[51:29] yeah I'm trying to show you this to get
[51:31] you to think about something the King
[51:35] James Version the is a translation of
[51:42] translations and many of you know that
[51:48] have you ever studied it they took 40
[51:52] something people King James did he took
[51:56] 40 some people and put him in groups in
[52:02] that group he would give him a scripture
[52:04] and they would take that scripture and
[52:07] when they came back to the core of the
[52:10] group all of those say sent out five
[52:13] groups you know each one of them had to
[52:16] compare exactly when they came back
[52:18] together or it was not put into King
[52:20] James Version King James Version is not
[52:25] a translation of
[52:27] yeah actually you don't like this one
[52:30] but that's our hi good news for modern
[52:32] man has a base core more real than King
[52:35] James because you know what to base core
[52:39] the good news were not a man or a
[52:40] literal translation you understand what
[52:48] I'm getting at see we think we know all
[52:50] about these things and then somebody
[52:51] comes along and said something about it
[52:53] well I don't know what in the world
[52:54] you're talking about well where have you
[52:57] been I knew that for her of the profit
[53:03] the King James Version was they took
[53:07] those manuscripts and and the things and
[53:10] some of the versions that they had and
[53:12] thought and they put him in there to him
[53:14] and gave them that and said come out of
[53:16] there with the right understanding and
[53:20] if you think that ain't a way of God
[53:22] leading so you got 10 different groups
[53:26] that know with our study in the same one
[53:27] scripture and here they come back and
[53:30] lay it down and all of is exactly the
[53:31] same maybe not wording literally the
[53:38] context that's what I love it I love the
[53:47] King James Version because of the fact
[53:49] that I know where it come from and how
[53:53] it got into our hands the work we can
[53:58] understand and he doesn't mean that
[54:00] you've got to go back and find this Lord
[54:02] and all of these things that's not to
[54:06] understand it the understanding is what
[54:09] is the Bible trying to bring I hope you
[54:16] get the point of what your prophet see
[54:18] it
[54:18] he said now hello him he said that's
[54:24] capital hello him
[54:30] CAPITAL LETTERS he said showing you that
[54:35] it's in emphasizing the point of what
[54:39] you're talking about that you can
[54:48] actually look at this if you look in our
[54:51] minute ago you've seen it you had God
[54:53] spelled in the same verse with a big G
[54:58] OD and a little G OD you see when I come
[55:06] out here and say the Lord spoke to me
[55:10] you know what I can be saying that I
[55:13] just read it okay or I can say the Lord
[55:22] just spoke to me holding up brother
[55:26] branham's these are not here but holding
[55:29] it up represent and I have one in here
[55:30] in one quote you understand what I'm
[55:34] getting at then you've got Elohim carry
[55:40] that all the way through carrot all the
[55:43] way through your understanding don't
[55:45] lose that because that's the self
[55:47] existing one when he came down and
[55:51] created a world he was still self
[55:55] existent
[55:56] when he created all of and I listened
[56:00] when he created all our Genesis one he
[56:04] was still out of him then all at once he
[56:07] creates something that was a part of
[56:11] himself he's no longer self existing
[56:15] that's what I love no longer does he
[56:21] exist alone he'll never exist alone
[56:24] again why because Jehovah the title that
[56:27] was brought out signifies that he
[56:29] becomes like a father with his family he
[56:33] brought man into being
[56:40] I brought man into existence and then
[56:46] you can use Lord God and they've got a
[56:51] lot of here to work
[56:52] they don't say Lord our God the Lord
[56:54] backwards and forth but if you just
[56:58] remember what he's talking about
[57:03] it doesn't say that God spoke to Cain it
[57:07] says the Lord spoke to Cain you say no
[57:13] it's signifying that God Himself spoke
[57:21] personally to came and offered him
[57:26] salvation but he turned it down he
[57:35] offered him everything that was offered
[57:36] to Abel and I don't think that because
[57:40] he was cerfancy what are you don't call
[57:47] me I had that years ago throws in my
[57:49] face don't call me sir plant seed big
[57:53] boy you know what big boy wasn't
[57:55] referring to him being fair proceeding
[57:57] is referring to me I was referring to
[58:00] myself because what are these old bodies
[58:05] that we live in it's surely not a seed
[58:08] of God I hope you got a little better
[58:11] sense than that I can quote brother on
[58:18] him see he said you're born between what
[58:23] Satan and Eve I don't care what you
[58:29] think about yourself
[58:30] like I've always said you know they say
[58:33] well my family came over on the
[58:35] Mayflower oh you know we're we're a
[58:39] royal seed we came to America so did a
[58:44] bunch of crews that were stow away in
[58:46] the bottom of the thing to escape the
[58:48] place over there and come over here
[58:53] but you see we think we we think we're
[58:55] something you understand what I'm
[58:58] talking about God had to come to earth
[59:00] he could come and create and bring all
[59:03] of that into existence but he had to
[59:05] come himself personal that's where your
[59:08] java's picked up
[59:09] he becomes personal on earth right there
[59:13] to bring his family into existence then
[59:18] you got the word Jehovah like a father
[59:22] with his family the test still not is 9
[59:28] they see ones that don't mean nothing to
[59:31] me call the big letters and look smaller
[59:32] this letter that letter I don't make no
[59:35] difference for me all right Oh get ready
[59:39] to quit how about going over to number
[59:45] seven and let's just read something cuz
[59:50] remember Jehovah's not a name Elohim is
[59:54] not a name Yahweh is not a name all of
[59:58] those great titles you hear the preacher
[1:00:00] is preaching about today Adana and in
[1:00:03] all the different they've got all kind
[1:00:05] of different things and every one of
[1:00:07] them is trying to do it with this look
[1:00:13] now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[1:00:16] this wise they didn't italicize that it
[1:00:21] didn't bold it right it didn't raise it
[1:00:27] up because it's telling you what
[1:00:30] happened yeah when is his mother Mary
[1:00:35] was espoused to Joseph before they came
[1:00:36] together she was found with child with
[1:00:38] all the goat okay
[1:00:39] and she shall bring forth a son okay
[1:00:44] over to 21 I shall call his name Jesus
[1:00:55] bold letters in other words get away
[1:01:02] from up here this record that mankind is
[1:01:04] making now we've got it straight Jesus
[1:01:08] was born from the Virgin Mary as
[1:01:14] Almighty God come on he'll bring forth a
[1:01:21] son and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[1:01:23] and he shall save his people from their
[1:01:26] sins and you her not till she had
[1:01:30] brought forth the firstborn son and he
[1:01:34] called his name Jesus bold letters drop
[1:01:42] down one verse when Jesus was born in
[1:01:46] Bethlehem you back to small letters he
[1:01:53] said what are you doing I'm trying to
[1:01:55] tell you the name of Jesus but let me
[1:01:57] tell it to you for brother Branham
[1:02:00] that's where it ought to all come from
[1:02:02] anyway right what did brother Branham
[1:02:05] say about the name of Jesus
[1:02:11] he said there's many Jesuses the next
[1:02:16] Jesus Jason in this name you Spanish to
[1:02:18] cut into Jesus y'all you got all kind of
[1:02:22] Jesus which there's only one Lord Jesus
[1:02:26] Christ there's only one name of God
[1:02:31] that's Jesus
[1:02:34] so they bold it and made it up to where
[1:02:37] it would appear
[1:02:38] check your Bible won't see if it doesn't
[1:02:42] yeah but then when they're just talking
[1:02:46] about him and who he is it's coming back
[1:02:48] but now he's 9 his name is Jesus you
[1:02:52] remember the story Mary was with child
[1:02:57] of the Holy Ghost Marie leaves and she
[1:03:05] goes to Elizabeth
[1:03:08] Lizabeth his pull back up in the country
[1:03:10] there because she's really embarrassed
[1:03:13] oh she's six months pregnant with a dead
[1:03:18] baby alright John had not moved six
[1:03:27] months John had not moved right but when
[1:03:36] they met Mary said Elizabeth I hear
[1:03:43] you're pregnant said yeah I'm pregnant
[1:03:45] but I'm kind of a little worried about
[1:03:47] it I'm just paraphrasing the scripture
[1:03:49] you read it I'm kind of worried because
[1:03:52] the baby hasn't moved
[1:03:55] I'm very sad well Elizabeth I'm pregnant
[1:04:01] too
[1:04:02] Oh Elizabeth says woman oh you and
[1:04:07] Joseph you've got married she says no I
[1:04:13] conceived a child of the Holy Ghost he
[1:04:21] said his name is Jesus he said as quick
[1:04:29] as that name was spoken by human lips
[1:04:32] now remember what said by human lips did
[1:04:39] John received the Holy Ghost in his
[1:04:42] mother's womb find me that in the Bible
[1:05:02] he said well put him in it she only were
[1:05:05] that mary goes up to Elizabeth the name
[1:05:11] of Jesus had done been pronounced washed
[1:05:17] but there's the key there the Prophet
[1:05:19] you what he's talking about when the
[1:05:23] angel appeared to Mary said call his
[1:05:24] name Jesus right do you need to add do
[1:05:29] we need to pull it up call his name
[1:05:32] Jesus John didn't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:05:36] at that because that was an angel Mary
[1:05:44] goes up and tells her salutation but she
[1:05:48] doesn't call the name of Jesus when she
[1:05:54] first starts her discussion with
[1:05:56] Elizabeth
[1:06:04] her discussion is what has happened to
[1:06:06] her and she has conceived a child learn
[1:06:16] your Bible they when Elizabeth when Mary
[1:06:24] spoke the name of Jesus was the first
[1:06:27] time a human being used that night the
[1:06:31] other time it was a angel sometimes
[1:06:37] angels were not children of God the when
[1:06:43] Mary said to Elizabeth but it's not even
[1:06:47] written that away this there is the
[1:06:52] salutation that when Mary says to
[1:06:55] Elizabeth angel met me and I've
[1:07:00] conceived of the Holy Ghost and said his
[1:07:04] name is Jesus
[1:07:05] find me that in the Bible that says his
[1:07:08] name is Jesus from Mary
[1:07:14] you see we're taking what a prophet says
[1:07:17] thank God he said the first time the
[1:07:23] human being spoken not the first time an
[1:07:25] angel means I help spoken the name Jesus
[1:07:28] had been used daily in all kind of
[1:07:30] things because it was Jesus was a common
[1:07:33] name but when Mary gave her salutation
[1:07:44] what was her salutation Elizabeth I'm
[1:07:48] pregnant too Elizabeth says you and
[1:07:52] Jones know me and Joseph ain't married
[1:07:56] I'm Harry he said listen
[1:08:04] that I met an angel and said I conceived
[1:08:10] of the Holy Ghost not an angel angel
[1:08:17] couldn't bring that seed to Mary he
[1:08:20] could bring that a letter form to rain
[1:08:22] but not to seed that the Holy Ghost is
[1:08:28] as quick as she said that John leap in
[1:08:34] the wound of Elizabeth and it says that
[1:08:40] Elizabeth was filled with the Holy go
[1:08:43] see we don't like that we want to make
[1:08:46] it John was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:08:48] that is good because that's what
[1:08:50] happened
[1:08:51] we remember Elizabeth how many we find
[1:08:53] life's not for and see when Simeon was
[1:08:56] speaking he was filled with the Holy
[1:08:57] Ghost you got about four times of
[1:09:00] different ones that was filled with the
[1:09:03] Holy Ghost this was a salutation what I
[1:09:12] conceived a child of the Holy Ghost to
[1:09:15] fulfill the scripture they shall call
[1:09:20] his name Emmanuel they didn't call him
[1:09:24] Emmanuel l-listen they did but he didn't
[1:09:27] is that sensible it was told in Isaiah
[1:09:33] to call him Emmanuel which is God with
[1:09:38] us James will refer into that but he
[1:09:44] says he'll call his name Jesus see Jesus
[1:09:49] is the only name God ever had Jesus is
[1:09:58] the only name God ever had show me
[1:10:00] another name all of them are titles
[1:10:05] Jehovah Jehovah Jireh Joe over tsking
[1:10:07] all of that
[1:10:08] Yahweh's all that you go through all of
[1:10:10] those great things that these people out
[1:10:12] here in the world will preach you on a
[1:10:13] lot not against that I'm just telling
[1:10:16] you that's what they do
[1:10:22] as the holy ghost come to you to tell
[1:10:27] you
[1:10:28] wise name is called Jesus come on the
[1:10:39] only name God ever had is Jesus you got
[1:10:42] no titles in life the titles are there
[1:10:45] cuz they're in reference is coming
[1:10:46] through but his name is Jesus
[1:10:49] his name is a fulfillment of ever
[1:10:52] prophecy ever thought ever saying ever
[1:10:56] Yahweh's ever Jehovah ever Elohim Zelo
[1:11:01] all of those things is fulfilled in the
[1:11:04] name of Jesus now see you're not even
[1:11:14] reading your Bible I come in my father's
[1:11:22] night well what was the father's name
[1:11:30] hold your hold well and now the title
[1:11:33] come on
[1:11:34] what was the name of the father Jesus
[1:11:40] those Jesus said I come into my father's
[1:11:42] night oh that just makes us Jesus only
[1:11:44] uh-huh no I'm talking about the Lord
[1:11:47] Jesus Christ there's just one there's
[1:11:52] just one Lord Jesus Christ that's why he
[1:11:58] said ask anything in my name
[1:12:06] because his name is Jesus I'm only
[1:12:11] giving you half the story the rest will
[1:12:13] be finished next Sunday Lord with it so
[1:12:17] just think about these things but think
[1:12:21] about it as you're reading your Bible
[1:12:23] listen listen to us say it he says the
[1:12:27] Lord spoke to came I used that because
[1:12:30] we don't want a reference with came but
[1:12:32] the Bible said it yeah what do you think
[1:12:37] the great eternal johor was
[1:12:39] self-existing elohim condescended to sit
[1:12:46] down and have a discussion with Cain and
[1:12:49] said you'd have been received had you
[1:12:52] done like your brother I'm quoting Bible
[1:13:01] he said well what was what was that name
[1:13:05] the Lord said unto my lord like I didn't
[1:13:11] finish I want to go so I'm glad to come
[1:13:12] back to that point okay
[1:13:13] in the Old English that's what you had
[1:13:16] you had a lord which is a guy over the
[1:13:18] properties that he's Lord you know I
[1:13:20] mean you could talk about your neighbor
[1:13:22] he says he says run Lord my lord how you
[1:13:25] been doing today because it had that
[1:13:30] reference as to what it was it was just
[1:13:33] but it referenced like a something with
[1:13:35] a family and he say the Lord said unto
[1:13:41] my lord let me tell you this the way
[1:13:45] okay maybe you'll even get mad enough to
[1:13:48] think about it to do something brother
[1:13:51] branham I'm asking you a question
[1:14:01] what is the new birth you remember that
[1:14:05] from Chrysler mr. of God reveal what is
[1:14:08] the new birth letter Brent him what is
[1:14:11] the new burrow is this the baptism of
[1:14:16] the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus
[1:14:17] Christ didn't reveal to you his name you
[1:14:22] see one listen Church I'm not throwing
[1:14:24] off on nothing doctor I'm just trying to
[1:14:28] tell you how that God has helped us
[1:14:29] would you go right over there and
[1:14:31] they'll tell you about the name of Jesus
[1:14:32] I've heard preachers preach about the
[1:14:35] name of Jesus and just bring tears to
[1:14:36] your eyes
[1:14:40] but did no one realised they know
[1:14:42] nothing about him he's my Savior
[1:14:49] he's my healer he's my Hall in the hall
[1:14:52] never a reference in the Bible
[1:14:55] he's referencing to Jesus Christ in my
[1:15:01] name it said you'll cast out Devils the
[1:15:05] Holy Ghost which will come in my name
[1:15:10] that's why brother Brent says water
[1:15:13] baptism is a very important thing he
[1:15:15] said because you do not have a promise
[1:15:18] of the Holy Ghost under Father Son and
[1:15:21] Holy Ghost baptism you need that you
[1:15:25] don't have a promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:27] you only have a promise of the Holy
[1:15:29] Ghost when you're baptized in the name
[1:15:30] of the Lord Jesus Christ I hope this
[1:15:40] little point this took me six months the
[1:15:42] last time don't I just leave it to you
[1:15:45] to think about
[1:15:52] yeah I can say to brother branham I can
[1:15:54] say Lord what did you mean when you said
[1:16:00] the baptism when the whole ago cuz I'm
[1:16:04] speaking to him as a senior point or
[1:16:09] movement or knowing I can get my answer
[1:16:13] we're gonna get into that word comes
[1:16:16] into a bold letter we're gonna get into
[1:16:22] something where a man stood before a
[1:16:24] burning bush and he said and you hear me
[1:16:30] say it over and over so when I get
[1:16:32] started you'll know it say it God said
[1:16:38] Moses go to Egypt he said I am NOT going
[1:16:45] I can't talk good I can't do nothing and
[1:16:52] he doesn't God says I'll take care of
[1:16:53] the hand Aaron of in your prophet you
[1:16:56] just be a god to them well okay but
[1:16:59] still or not what am I going to tell him
[1:17:01] tell him that God of Abraham Isaac and
[1:17:04] Jacob he said I know of God of Abraham
[1:17:06] Isaac and Jacob I know all about the
[1:17:08] historical gods and all I thought what's
[1:17:11] it what's your name about what name
[1:17:17] shall I tell Pharaoh did I do these
[1:17:21] things you remember what he said to him
[1:17:26] at the burning bush and check it out and
[1:17:29] see if it's bold letters you'll know
[1:17:30] we're gonna get to something just go
[1:17:37] there and check it out he said I am that
[1:17:43] I am
[1:17:51] not making it to fit now cold I don't
[1:17:54] like to change scriptures or me but a
[1:17:56] lot of people that sounds odd it comes
[1:17:59] out hard to me but when he went down to
[1:18:01] Pharaoh he said Pharaoh didn't let my
[1:18:05] people go
[1:18:07] he said who's gonna take him out of here
[1:18:09] he said I am do you know you can bring
[1:18:13] that up and show that God was there but
[1:18:16] I'd rather bring it this way Moses knew
[1:18:20] who he was at that time he understood
[1:18:24] who he was and by that time he knew if
[1:18:28] there's coming out of there he was gonna
[1:18:30] take him so he said I am I'm gonna take
[1:18:37] him out now you can take it and say both
[1:18:41] of them is right to say I am him
[1:18:43] referring to it's personal it's correct
[1:18:46] but to say I am him referring to the God
[1:18:49] that was leading him to bring him out
[1:18:51] it's the same thing I am that I am that
[1:19:02] one more word what was this Elohim
[1:19:05] self-existing when he appeared are to
[1:19:10] Moses he appeared to him as ever-present
[1:19:15] for eternity because that's what I am
[1:19:19] means those things are in the Bible for
[1:19:23] a purpose Church don't just play with
[1:19:25] your Bible and and say well I don't
[1:19:26] understand this or I read it and when
[1:19:29] you're reading it look at who's talking
[1:19:31] and what's talking and look at iron
[1:19:33] you'll see the Lord is speaking to
[1:19:35] people the Lord Himself he's talking to
[1:19:42] us he talked to us through the Prophet
[1:19:45] to bring us the message he can speak
[1:19:52] through mama and daddy to speak to you
[1:19:54] about the message just remember we're
[1:20:00] still just talking about Jesus

[1:20:16] out Jesus I'll be looking for a new name
[1:20:22] well while I'm waiting I can say what
[1:20:25] the Prophet said he said maybe it'll be
[1:20:28] made known when we get there I didn't
[1:20:30] say that he's the one who said it let's
