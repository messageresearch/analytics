[7:41] all safe amen
[7:42] so if you got your bibles we're going to
[7:44] be on eternal redemption
[7:46] part 11.
[7:50] go to hebrews 9 11 we'll read our
[7:53] scriptures
[7:54] run through these quotes pretty quick
[7:56] and i was gonna go
[7:58] we're getting into the sixth dimension
[8:00] but there's so much to that sixth
[8:01] dimension
[8:03] that uh there's one little place that we
[8:04] always forget but
[8:06] it's part of the plan of redemption and
[8:08] it's called paradise
[8:10] totally a part of redemption had to be
[8:12] put there and we're going to prove
[8:13] tonight and show
[8:14] why it had to be put there you couldn't
[8:16] just put the old testament saints into
[8:18] the sixth dimension
[8:20] because that's the born-again that's the
[8:22] genesis 1 26
[8:23] man after they pass away here and go
[8:26] into another dimens sixth dimension
[8:27] right
[8:28] that is just for them so there's got to
[8:30] be a place for these other ones and
[8:32] thank god there was a plan
[8:34] an eternal plan that included the ones
[8:37] in paradise
[8:38] that died under the blood of bulls and
[8:40] goats amen
[8:41] so we'll look at that tonight hebrews 9
[8:46] 11 so let's bow our heads and talk to
[8:49] the author one time
[8:50] the heavenly father thank you for the
[8:52] day and hour you
[8:53] give us to live in lord as we were
[8:56] thinking yesterday and just kind of
[8:58] reminiscing on all the people that we
[9:00] know and the people that we've all come
[9:01] in contact with that we know around the
[9:03] world
[9:04] that are truly friends of ours and
[9:07] brothers and sisters in christ that we
[9:08] would have never met if it hadn't been
[9:10] for this message
[9:11] and lord but you because of this eternal
[9:14] plan
[9:16] lord it's kind of like a family reunion
[9:18] get together
[9:19] we know that there's family out there we
[9:21] just haven't met him all yet
[9:23] and if we don't meet him on this side we
[9:24] know we're going to meet him on the
[9:25] other side
[9:26] so lord you've set this thing up where
[9:29] as brother adam was saying there that
[9:31] right after the resurrection that we'll
[9:33] be 30 40 days
[9:35] just looking around to see if this one
[9:36] made it and that one made it
[9:38] then we're going to turn our eyes and
[9:40] we're going to focus our
[9:42] face on you lord because we'll meet you
[9:44] in the air
[9:46] and ever never to be away from you again
[9:49] lord we thank you for that father we
[9:51] know that this
[9:52] time that we're living in we are
[9:54] separated from you by the
[9:55] these dimensions and by these bodies
[9:57] that we live in
[9:59] but lord we know in in spirit and our
[10:01] soul we commune with you lord
[10:03] as much as we let you come in with us
[10:05] father we pray that you'd commune with
[10:07] us tonight lord you do the speaking of
[10:09] the word to the people
[10:10] may they receive something from you
[10:12] bless all the ones that are sick
[10:14] the ones that are needy lord the sin
[10:15] sick all the ones on this
[10:18] list right down below my feet on the
[10:19] wall lord we look at it sometimes and
[10:22] lord we want them all to come in we
[10:24] don't want to lose one of them father
[10:25] because they're connected to some family
[10:27] member in this church
[10:28] father we pray that you just be with us
[10:30] now and take care of us in the
[10:31] furthermore this service
[10:33] keep us safe in jesus name amen
[10:36] hebrews 9 verse 11 but christ being come
[10:40] a high priest of good things to come by
[10:41] a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[10:44] not made with hands that is to say not
[10:46] of this building
[10:47] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[10:50] but by his own blood he entered once
[10:52] into the holy place
[10:53] having obtained eternal redemption for
[10:56] us
[10:56] you may be seated in the lord as
[10:58] blessing to the reading of the word
[11:00] but there had to be a part of redemption
[11:04] that had to be played by the old
[11:06] testament saints
[11:08] and there had to be a place for them to
[11:10] go there couldn't just be one where
[11:12] because they died under good faith and
[11:14] we'll read what the prophet says
[11:16] but let's continue through here and see
[11:19] just kind of go back and let's read this
[11:21] one from
[11:22] job 19 55 job being the oldest book in
[11:25] the bible
[11:26] let's read the red to save time
[11:28] redemption is one of the oldest things
[11:30] in the bible did you know redemption
[11:33] was even before the plan of redemption
[11:34] was laid out before the world
[11:37] was ever formed think of that look god
[11:39] foreseeing
[11:41] i keep looking at that word for seeing
[11:42] because that's foreknowledge
[11:44] by for knowledge this eternal plan you
[11:47] say well it had to have a beginning no
[11:49] it doesn't it's in the mind of god
[11:51] listen this plan of redemption was in
[11:53] the mind of god from
[11:54] you can't say when he started it always
[11:56] was because it can't change
[11:59] if it was the eternal thoughts of god
[12:01] now look there's eternal thoughts of god
[12:03] and there's thoughts of god
[12:07] and he's the only one who can keep them
[12:08] separated because me and you can
[12:10] remember everything we did back
[12:12] right bro donnie but now according to
[12:15] god
[12:15] he's put our sins in the sea of god
[12:17] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[12:18] again
[12:19] so some way he can wipe that out i don't
[12:22] know
[12:22] i can't say some way i know how he did
[12:24] it he's god
[12:26] and when he died at calvary we'll look
[12:28] at some some really wonderful quotes for
[12:30] brother um talks about what happened
[12:32] at calvary because that was where the
[12:35] mind of god was transferred to earth
[12:37] into a man named jesus and then jesus
[12:39] what did he do he did what god foresaw
[12:43] and his brother dale's been preaching
[12:44] this listen jesus had to come
[12:48] he didn't just say well now there'll be
[12:50] somebody
[12:52] may be born in bc4 that'll maybe
[12:56] he'll be the one i choose no that was
[12:58] god himself
[12:59] and being he wasn't he wasn't part of
[13:02] the plan he was the plan
[13:04] but he became and made himself part of
[13:07] the plan
[13:08] that would be like the guy that writes
[13:09] the play or writes the
[13:11] script for the movie and then he stars
[13:13] in the movie
[13:14] amen because god wrote the script saw it
[13:17] happen
[13:18] and played a big part in it because he
[13:21] had to die to fulfill
[13:23] god foreseeing and making a way of
[13:25] redemption before he even made the world
[13:28] that gave adam and eve a chance that
[13:31] gave
[13:31] even cain a chance to make it
[13:35] so that give everybody a chance to make
[13:38] it
[13:39] before he ever made the world for the
[13:41] bible plainly says that christ was
[13:42] predestinated
[13:44] for dane and was the lamb of god slain
[13:46] before the foundation of the world
[13:49] everybody understand that jesus it
[13:50] wasn't like jesus was
[13:52] he thought he might be god or he he just
[13:54] decided no
[13:55] see you and i are disconnected from that
[13:58] jesus came in human flesh
[14:00] predetermined that he was going to be
[14:02] here because he was a lamb that was
[14:03] slain before the foundation of the world
[14:06] it wasn't somebody that just come down
[14:08] here and received him like me and you
[14:10] we don't know who's saved and who's not
[14:12] saved or who's going to be saved and not
[14:13] saved
[14:14] but we know there had to be god almighty
[14:16] and human flesh according to the old
[14:18] testament
[14:19] which was several hundred scriptures
[14:20] telling us how he was going to get here
[14:22] and who he was and when he came
[14:24] according to that they hated him and
[14:26] killed him but that was part of the plan
[14:29] that was part of the plan for ordained
[14:33] and was the lamb of god there couldn't
[14:35] nobody else take the place we were
[14:36] talking about
[14:37] brother branham today at lunch we were
[14:40] talking about brother branham you know
[14:41] he
[14:42] he's the only one that could stand and
[14:45] preach some of the greatest sermons he
[14:46] ever preached knowing nobody in the
[14:48] whole congregation was ever
[14:49] understanding one thing he was saying
[14:52] all they wanted was to see the signs and
[14:54] wonders listen i was telling them today
[14:56] have you ever realized this brother ryan
[14:58] spent 40 something years brother luis
[15:00] tearing down the major doctrines of all
[15:02] the denominations of the world
[15:04] especially catholic how many of them
[15:07] dissolved
[15:09] and moved to the tabernacle zero
[15:13] zero now they was people come out of
[15:16] there
[15:17] people come out of those denominations
[15:19] but you would have thought if he tore
[15:21] that thing down and just tore the
[15:22] foundation apart
[15:24] of your denomination or your belief then
[15:27] you would go
[15:28] well we have no denomination let's close
[15:30] our headquarters and we're going to go
[15:31] with this guy
[15:32] no that's not what it but that wasn't
[15:33] part of the plan either
[15:35] because he said come out of her my
[15:37] people there had to be a her
[15:39] that even went all the way to the end
[15:42] time being the and the
[15:44] harlot daughters so see that was
[15:46] predetermined
[15:48] there had to be the they had to be
[15:49] the harlem daughters brother brown
[15:51] didn't come to dissolve that
[15:52] sure he come to destroy their doctrine
[15:54] but not one of them left
[15:56] its denominational whole they're still
[15:58] baptist still catholics and they're
[16:00] growing like crazy
[16:02] so who is it too it's to the select few
[16:06] mom raised their hand i'll raise my hand
[16:07] it was the to the select
[16:09] few even the people that were sitting
[16:12] there that
[16:12] time when the seals were were being
[16:14] preached by the rest is in the
[16:16] questions and answers on the seals and
[16:18] brother brown said it's not for you it's
[16:19] gone from you
[16:21] you're not even you're not even you're
[16:23] not even going to get it it's not even
[16:24] listen
[16:24] he said it's not even for you now that
[16:27] was 1963.
[16:30] you said well that was it it was done
[16:32] finished nobody's going to get it now no
[16:33] he said but no right around the coming
[16:35] of the lord
[16:36] these things will come together in other
[16:37] words and they'll be a
[16:39] a preacher unless titus 1 1 paul a
[16:41] servant of god an apostle of jesus
[16:43] christ according to the faith of god's
[16:45] elect
[16:45] and the acknowledging of the truth which
[16:47] is after godliness put this on 1.25 big
[16:49] boy
[16:50] in hope of eternal life which god that
[16:52] cannot lie promised before the world
[16:54] began but hath in due times manifested
[16:56] his word what
[16:58] through preaching the whole fivefold
[17:01] ministry not just one fold all five
[17:03] foals
[17:04] has to be given to perfect the saints
[17:07] unto me according
[17:08] which is committed unto me paul didn't
[17:10] have a problem i
[17:12] i'm you know i some people may thought
[17:15] brother trevor was a little bold
[17:16] somebody some people may think i am but
[17:18] you know what
[17:19] there's people that are chosen to take
[17:20] this thing and sweep it on to the coming
[17:22] of the lord i'm just dumb enough to
[17:24] believe that
[17:24] then i'm going to i'm going to connect
[17:25] myself to that
[17:27] and i'm going to give him what gift i
[17:29] have and let him use it for the glory of
[17:31] the lord
[17:32] amen and so you should be the same way
[17:35] we shouldn't be cocky or arrogant but we
[17:37] should be confident
[17:40] in that you're in the right message
[17:42] you're hearing the right word
[17:44] and you are born again and you are the
[17:46] bride of jesus christ now listen
[17:49] that takes everything else and puts it
[17:51] down low
[17:53] right but now if you build yourself up
[17:55] you got a problem
[17:57] see you build yourself up you got a
[17:59] problem but now who would
[18:00] look at paul though and paul said you're
[18:02] going to be judged by my gospel
[18:04] others would have thought paul was
[18:06] elevating because remember he even says
[18:07] i magnify my office right
[18:10] paul was a lo paul was a hook knows jew
[18:13] paul was jewish he had a little bit of
[18:14] maybe a little bit of quick temper but
[18:18] he was bringing a message
[18:19] that was going to solidify the early
[18:22] church that was going to take that early
[18:24] church and make it settle make it
[18:25] established
[18:26] go to ephesus and not worry about right
[18:28] here in ephesians 1 where we're talking
[18:30] about now let's go to there
[18:32] because this is to the ephesians he said
[18:34] look
[18:36] best blessed be the god and father of
[18:37] our lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[18:39] with all spiritual blessings
[18:41] according as he has chosen us in him
[18:43] before the foundation of the world
[18:45] that we should be holy and without blame
[18:47] now
[18:49] that's pretty tough to take but we're
[18:52] chosen in him
[18:54] if you're chosen in him then you take
[18:56] whatever he's got
[18:57] that's what i get right having
[19:00] predestinated us into the adoption of
[19:02] children
[19:02] we're all listen adoption is
[19:04] predestinated
[19:06] adoption is predetermined because we
[19:08] have to have
[19:09] adopted sons and daughters of god to get
[19:11] out of here they did not need adopted
[19:13] sons and daughters of god
[19:15] in luther's day in
[19:18] wesley's day in pentecost that was not
[19:20] required but in this age it's required
[19:23] to go up that statue of a perfect man to
[19:25] go to adoption
[19:27] to go to the fullness of christ because
[19:29] we're talking about doing something no
[19:31] one has ever done before
[19:32] and that's taking a body change by what
[19:35] we have
[19:36] inside of us now look
[19:40] martin luther had the same holy ghost
[19:43] you've got
[19:45] but it could only work by what word that
[19:47] he could see
[19:49] and that god allotted for that time you
[19:52] understand what i'm saying god allotted
[19:54] so much for each age i read that quote
[19:56] to you a long time ago
[19:57] brother brown said each age was allotted
[20:01] what according to revelations 1-3
[20:04] they were allotted ephesian church age
[20:07] and and like brother travis
[20:08] trevor said in the book each there was
[20:11] seven
[20:11] actual cities that were in asia minor
[20:15] call these different churches ephesus
[20:17] smyrna pergamos started sergeant and
[20:20] they fit the character
[20:21] of the people that was going to be in
[20:23] the age
[20:25] because look right here columba was from
[20:28] where
[20:29] he was from ireland he lived in ireland
[20:32] i don't even know that he left the whole
[20:34] of the island we don't know that
[20:35] but the thytara that thai tower city was
[20:39] over in asia minor
[20:41] but god took the characteristics of what
[20:43] that church what that
[20:45] city was matched it with by the prophet
[20:49] matched it with columbus character and
[20:51] the character of the people of that age
[20:54] because remember columbus died before
[20:57] his church age started
[20:59] so it had to be they couldn't press
[21:02] anyway
[21:06] their messenger died before the church
[21:08] age started so it had to be what
[21:10] yeah it had to be the preachers
[21:14] that took the message of columba and
[21:16] took it to the people
[21:18] amen i'm just
[21:22] as they say it might work there's a
[21:24] little girl worked there she said just
[21:25] saying
[21:26] you're just saying you know you look at
[21:28] it and you say well this church age
[21:30] messenger wasn't he meant his age
[21:31] but you know what though his preaching
[21:33] the character of his preaching though
[21:35] carried through that 1500 years columbus
[21:38] age was the largest age it was like
[21:39] almost
[21:40] it was a thousand years so those
[21:42] messengers had to carry through that
[21:44] those preachers
[21:46] behind pulpits and behind pulpit in that
[21:48] day meant you died if the romans came in
[21:51] the door
[21:52] but they preached it anyway and they got
[21:55] that
[21:56] to luther's age amen right
[22:00] so they persevered
[22:03] verse six to the praise of the glory of
[22:05] his grace we're in heaven
[22:06] made us what accepted in the beloved
[22:09] that's why i said before
[22:11] you and i cannot
[22:15] stand before judgment if we're chosen in
[22:17] christ
[22:19] we've already been judged when he went
[22:21] to calvary we've been we were judged
[22:24] all those that are in that sixth
[22:25] dimension they have been judged
[22:28] even those that were in paradise we'll
[22:31] read in just a minute
[22:32] i'll let brother brown explain to you
[22:33] let's let's look at verse 11.
[22:35] and him also we have obtained an
[22:36] inheritance being what predestinated
[22:39] there's that predestination now
[22:40] predestinate is right it's predetermined
[22:42] destiny
[22:43] but it's by what for knowledge according
[22:46] to the purpose of him who worketh all
[22:47] things after the council
[22:49] of his own will and we were talking
[22:52] about foreknowledge
[22:53] again just before i don't want to beat
[22:56] this to death but still
[22:57] we need to see this
[23:01] because if you just look at
[23:02] predetermined you can't read the message
[23:03] of the hour
[23:06] you can't and get it right because the
[23:09] way you look brother branham you look at
[23:10] one way he makes quotes it's like
[23:12] you could not go any other way you had
[23:15] you came here wheat
[23:16] you came here an eagle you came here
[23:19] well then i've got the quotes here was
[23:20] it no you came here a kookaburra
[23:22] so if you don't put them two together
[23:25] then you do have confusion
[23:28] i think about what trevor was saying the
[23:29] other day you know i don't blame some
[23:32] people for pla
[23:33] press and play they've heard so much
[23:35] junk out there of message preachers
[23:38] saying brother branham was wrong here or
[23:39] he did this or that over there
[23:42] they probably need to press play maybe
[23:44] to bring their self back
[23:45] but they will never get perfected by
[23:48] just pressing play because they can't go
[23:49] past the bible
[23:50] right the bible says for the perfecting
[23:52] of the saints he give a fivefold
[23:54] ministry
[23:55] and you know what
[23:59] you know there's no plan
[24:02] without you there's no predetermining
[24:06] without you
[24:07] there's no foreknowledge without you
[24:10] a plan is not a plan you you can you can
[24:12] draw up the best football plan in the
[24:14] world
[24:15] but you got to have 11 men on that and
[24:18] and guess what
[24:19] there's 11 other guys that have put
[24:21] their plan and they want to put it in
[24:22] force too
[24:24] right so that's the way it is with you
[24:25] and me
[24:27] we've got our plan satan's got his plan
[24:30] but we gonna win it may look bad every
[24:33] once in a while but we gonna win because
[24:35] this is the
[24:36] this is an eternal plan
[24:39] satan's plan may work for him and it is
[24:42] it's gonna take us
[24:43] it's gonna take the world into chaos
[24:46] amen
[24:47] that's what it's doing now but that plan
[24:50] has an end
[24:51] yes that plan comes to an end
[24:54] at the what white throne judgment and
[24:56] then the
[24:57] the burning in the in the fire that's
[25:00] where that ends
[25:00] and guess what we do we just go right
[25:02] into the future home and just keep right
[25:04] on going
[25:05] that eternal plan of redemption amen
[25:09] romans 8 verse 29 save time for whom he
[25:11] did for know he also did predestinate to
[25:13] what look
[25:14] you're not just predetermined you're
[25:16] predetermined to do something
[25:18] to be conformed to the image in other
[25:20] words to
[25:21] what's the image of god you say oh i
[25:23] said this is the image of god
[25:26] this forms every image that god ever has
[25:30] been ever will be in every
[25:32] every character every characteristic of
[25:34] god is right here
[25:37] now what'd the prophet do the prophet
[25:39] made sure
[25:40] the holy spirit through the prophet made
[25:42] sure that we saw the right
[25:44] picture because see the
[25:48] the denomination plan of redemption is
[25:50] different from ours
[25:53] you saw bro well why are we sitting here
[25:57] why aren't we saying blessed holy
[25:58] trinity and and baptize in the name of
[26:00] father son holy ghost and why aren't we
[26:02] believing in an eternal hell and why
[26:04] aren't we believing that we got to go
[26:06] through seven years of tribulation maybe
[26:08] three and a half
[26:09] here and three and a half over there but
[26:10] they still believe in a that you
[26:13] go through a tribulation period now
[26:15] that's their denominational idea
[26:17] we're different from that why because
[26:20] the prophet of god came
[26:22] and said this is it i was telling them
[26:23] before you know brother brown used many
[26:25] people
[26:26] uri smith clarence larkin all these
[26:28] different ones he even used scofield
[26:31] listen brother brother is not the one
[26:32] that came up with theophany
[26:35] scofield's got it right here before
[26:37] brother brown even was born almost
[26:42] brother brown read it though but you can
[26:44] read scofield
[26:45] and scofield somewhere in here in his
[26:47] footnotes he says see the trinity is
[26:49] laced all through the bible he was
[26:50] trinitarian he had that trinitarian idea
[26:53] but brother branham gleaned from this
[26:55] one gleaned from that one
[26:57] very well-read individual and he read
[27:00] all these but you know what he done he
[27:01] took it back to god he remember he took
[27:03] it back to the word
[27:06] and that's what you and i are supposed
[27:07] to do take it back to the word
[27:10] for whom he did for know he did
[27:11] predestinate what to be conformed
[27:15] to the image of his son that he might be
[27:17] the firstborn among
[27:18] many brethren watch moreover whom he did
[27:20] predestinate
[27:21] then he also called whom he called them
[27:24] he justified
[27:25] and whom he justified then he also
[27:29] glorified because you got to remember
[27:31] we're going to read here in a few
[27:32] minutes
[27:33] you and i go through justification
[27:35] sanctification of baptism the holy ghost
[27:36] to get the new birth
[27:38] the old testament saints were justified
[27:40] under
[27:42] the blood of bulls and goats but not
[27:44] saved not
[27:45] holy ghosts feel now they uh and i
[27:48] thought there might have been a pushback
[27:50] a couple of sundays ago when i was at
[27:52] brother richard heist and he don't mind
[27:53] me saying because we talked about
[27:54] afterward
[27:55] he said that was marvelous how you
[27:57] brought it out and i said well it's true
[27:59] john the baptist the bible says he got
[28:02] the holy ghost
[28:04] from his mother's womb
[28:07] but that whole that baptism of the holy
[28:09] ghost and your birth is different
[28:12] there is a difference in the baptism of
[28:14] the holy ghost because you can have the
[28:15] baptism of the holy ghost on your spirit
[28:17] every day of your life and die and go to
[28:19] hell but you can't have the new birth in
[28:22] your soul
[28:23] and die and go to hell so john was
[28:25] anointed by the holy ghost
[28:27] to do his job because i'm gonna prove
[28:29] right here
[28:31] he was in paradise
[28:35] i found that quote i've never seen it
[28:36] before brother brown said there was john
[28:40] in paradise with abraham isaac
[28:44] he was an old testament prophet
[28:47] they're bound right with that we know
[28:48] that but a lot of people didn't know
[28:50] that and sometimes
[28:51] people cross their eyes we've had many
[28:53] discussions
[28:54] donnie's had one with a brother a
[28:57] preacher in the message that said that
[28:59] oh no they got the new birth in the old
[29:00] testament just like we did
[29:03] i just walked away because there wasn't
[29:05] no needing me doing anything i was going
[29:06] to see what he'd do
[29:08] he lived through it maybe he didn't
[29:10] change the brother's mind
[29:12] but still you can't do that
[29:15] you can't have the savior
[29:19] or the the salvation of that kind of
[29:21] salvation before the savior
[29:23] because the bible says the death has to
[29:25] be a death of the testator
[29:27] to become a new testament the old
[29:29] testament was
[29:30] like the bosom of abraham it was the
[29:32] faith of abraham it was the faith of
[29:34] those ten commandments and all the laws
[29:36] and the prophets we'll read it in a
[29:37] second
[29:39] but see that's not what we're living
[29:40] under excuse me
[29:43] let's go to number three we'll skip
[29:45] through these if y'all don't mind
[29:46] brother bob's working back there he can
[29:47] get it
[29:48] how can i take a kuga bear and make a
[29:51] grain of wheat out of it it's impossible
[29:52] for me to do it
[29:54] the only way it can be is because inside
[29:55] that kookaburra has been transmitted
[29:57] from a cuckoo bird wheat
[29:58] a cuckoo bird to a germ called wheat
[30:00] life
[30:02] then you bury that cocker burn and
[30:03] produce a grain of wheat
[30:05] listen we buried a lot of fu birds
[30:07] around here
[30:10] but you'll never see that crocodile
[30:11] again
[30:13] because that transforming power of what
[30:14] was inside of them
[30:16] is in that sixth dimension well when
[30:17] that six dimension person comes back
[30:19] into this dimension
[30:20] because we're going to read here in a
[30:22] minute look excuse me when samuel
[30:24] died and went across excuse me whatever
[30:27] you want to call it we shouldn't eat
[30:28] that much
[30:29] across the curtain of time
[30:32] and he comes back he's samuel
[30:36] still with a robon and they recognize
[30:38] who he is
[30:40] he was in a dream condition just like
[30:42] brother brown said so he didn't change
[30:43] to a young man
[30:46] nope he did not because i'll prove to
[30:49] you in just a minute brother brown
[30:51] even when when jesus went to paradise
[30:53] there was
[30:54] there was um abraham and sarah but he
[30:57] says when they resurrected
[30:59] he said they were young see when they
[31:02] resurrected
[31:03] not while they were in paradise paradise
[31:05] is just a holding place and that's why
[31:07] and listen to me that's very important
[31:12] where would you have put those people
[31:15] that plan we know it's perfect but you
[31:17] keep looking at it and you go
[31:18] man he thought of everything
[31:22] they he thought of everything and it's
[31:24] perfect
[31:26] then you bury that cuckleberry to
[31:28] produce a grain of wheat
[31:30] because there has been a life of wheat
[31:31] put in that kookaburra
[31:34] and we know that because that's what
[31:36] what happened at the new birth
[31:38] then this new life has been fully
[31:39] developed out of the ground and raised
[31:41] up again
[31:41] when it comes back no more cockapoo but
[31:44] wait
[31:45] but while it's here on the earth kokober
[31:47] still sticky
[31:48] but it's got the nature on the inside of
[31:50] that wheat amen
[31:52] right and he talks about having a carnal
[31:56] nature so let's go let's
[31:57] jump on through here real quick we know
[32:00] what the first three dimensions were
[32:01] they were life
[32:02] light time and matter and we're all now
[32:04] caught in that dimension
[32:06] and listen even when jesus came into
[32:07] this dimension
[32:09] he was caught here
[32:12] there was no recording of him traveling
[32:14] through walls
[32:15] now there's a couple of times that he
[32:17] said that he disappeared in the crowd
[32:19] i believe he just changed their vision
[32:22] just like just like they did in the old
[32:23] testament remember here stands elisha
[32:25] here stands gaza elisha said there's
[32:28] more force than against us
[32:30] and he's just going one two one two
[32:33] one two ten thousand one two ten
[32:36] thousand
[32:37] what elisha say lord open his eyes now
[32:39] look those angels were already there
[32:42] they didn't develop they were already
[32:44] there because the prophet saw him
[32:46] he just said open my servant's eyes
[32:50] because remember what happened in that
[32:53] situation
[32:55] elisha went to the syrians and said
[32:58] who are you looking for they said we're
[33:00] looking for elijah he said
[33:02] come here i'll show you where he's at it
[33:03] was him god had changed their vision
[33:06] to where they didn't see who he was
[33:07] because remember when they get over
[33:09] right in the middle of the camp of the
[33:10] israelites what'd god do
[33:13] open their eyes they listen their eye
[33:15] wasn't shut
[33:16] they just couldn't see what was going on
[33:19] so i believe jesus just changed their
[33:21] changed their vision a little bit and he
[33:22] just walked right remember they won't
[33:23] throw him off a cliff and they were
[33:24] going to
[33:25] do all these things he just disappeared
[33:27] in the crowd
[33:30] if we're going to make it to a body
[33:31] change that may be what's going to
[33:32] happen to me in you
[33:34] amen that's the speaking condition
[33:36] that's the adoption that's to having
[33:38] supreme power in control not out of
[33:41] control
[33:43] amen then luke 16 is proved that
[33:46] abraham said son remember that thy
[33:50] lifetime you receive as good things like
[33:52] lazarus evil things you understand this
[33:53] is where
[33:55] lazarus is over here rich young rulers
[33:58] over here but they can't cross each
[33:59] other there is a boundary there
[34:01] even in the even in the paradise versus
[34:05] hell there's a gulf there that they
[34:08] couldn't cross back and forth to
[34:10] but the witch of endor could call samuel
[34:13] up and then
[34:14] he could look behind samuel and he said
[34:16] i see gods
[34:17] she said i see gods raising up out of
[34:20] the earth brother brown said she opened
[34:21] up that portal
[34:22] in those that dimension and she saw
[34:25] everything
[34:26] but you can't do that now he said you
[34:29] can't do that now because we'll read it
[34:30] in just a minute
[34:33] so that's luke 16. we know that you
[34:34] cannot pass from one dimension to the
[34:36] other we're stuck in this dimension
[34:37] until god takes us out of here
[34:39] amen until death takes us into another
[34:41] dimension or until we take a body change
[34:44] we are stuck here but you know what it's
[34:46] part of the plan
[34:48] because right here on this earth is
[34:50] where we're going to prove
[34:51] that there is a god we're going to prove
[34:54] there is a plan of redemption we're
[34:55] going to prove
[34:56] that a kuckleberg can be changed into a
[34:58] wheat we're going to prove that god
[35:01] as brother trevor was saying this is
[35:02] god's body
[35:05] there's no other body on the earth this
[35:08] is god's body
[35:12] he doesn't even step foot here until the
[35:15] millennium
[35:16] we go to meet him right
[35:19] because there'd be two bodies on the
[35:21] earth at the same time as we were
[35:22] talking about
[35:24] all right let's go to the next one john
[35:25] 12 28
[35:27] became a voice from heaven saying i both
[35:30] glorified it
[35:31] and glorified it again people therefore
[35:33] stood by and heard it and said it
[35:35] thundered
[35:36] others said an angel spake to me we were
[35:37] talking today about the
[35:39] the great opening of the seals and i
[35:40] believe that's what happened they just
[35:42] heard a voice
[35:43] not say listen not de-christianizing
[35:46] anyone that was setting during those
[35:48] seals or any time under brother brown's
[35:50] message you understand me
[35:51] they were in their time in their place
[35:56] born again
[36:00] amen but not being able to get the full
[36:04] revelation of the open book
[36:08] some of them probably still didn't you
[36:09] know after even brother brown left they
[36:11] never
[36:11] some called him a prophet some say well
[36:13] he's just a good preacher with a gift
[36:15] because you know what they turned around
[36:16] went right back into the denomination
[36:17] they were in when he died
[36:20] so what they didn't get a full
[36:21] revelation of what was going on so same
[36:24] thing i believe there where jesus is
[36:26] standing on the earth he's preached his
[36:27] sermon
[36:28] this is when he's getting ready to leave
[36:31] and god was talking to him god was
[36:32] talking to brother branham he
[36:34] many people heard the voice but they
[36:36] didn't get or heard the thunder but they
[36:37] didn't get the voice behind it
[36:39] because that part of the plan is and
[36:41] we're going to see here in a few minutes
[36:42] that when jesus cried with a loud voice
[36:47] it said it was finished amen
[36:51] all right now look that's the first
[36:52] three dimensions we talked about the
[36:54] sound barrier
[36:55] we know about that that when you break
[36:57] the sound barrier
[36:59] that it almost shakes the bolts think
[37:00] about me and you the same way
[37:03] but after that you know it gets a little
[37:04] better but after you break the sound
[37:07] barrier there's always a noise and
[37:08] there's always
[37:09] a cloud fourth dimension let's look at
[37:12] that
[37:13] science the tree of knowledge
[37:16] i'm going to try to get through this
[37:18] because i want to get to the other part
[37:20] pretty quick
[37:21] now we have contact through science to
[37:23] fourth dimension as it was
[37:24] because coming right through this
[37:25] building now comes pictures voice of
[37:27] radio
[37:28] pictures on television that our senses
[37:30] can't contact now you can't contact it
[37:32] but it can
[37:33] influence you remember we were talking
[37:36] the other day about the subliminal
[37:37] messages i
[37:38] you know they had to cut that out
[37:39] because they were doing that in movies
[37:42] they were flashing up coca-colas you
[37:44] know and popcorn and all that stuff and
[37:46] you're wondering why
[37:48] i just ate two cheeseburgers at
[37:49] mcdonald's why am i hungry
[37:51] and why am i thirsty well that's a blend
[37:54] why
[37:54] your subconscious was catching that
[37:57] because it was
[37:58] faster than your eye could contact
[38:03] remember your hands are even faster than
[38:04] your eyes
[38:06] a hand is quicker than the eye amen
[38:09] so now look we have contact through that
[38:13] but they have a tube or a crystal to
[38:15] pick up the ether waves
[38:17] then we're going to get to the question
[38:18] and answers on the seals you'll get to
[38:19] in just a little bit
[38:21] maybe on your trip back to to the
[38:25] the coast believers don't go to the
[38:28] beach
[38:28] believers go to the coast don't forget
[38:30] that
[38:34] there's no sense in our body can detect
[38:36] number six
[38:38] our television over the ether waves yet
[38:40] right through us
[38:41] us now is coming people's voices now i
[38:43] like what brother brown said
[38:45] because look that
[38:48] device doesn't create
[38:53] the image the image is there
[38:57] i've got to take this device to take
[38:59] your picture
[39:00] and send it somewhere else but you're
[39:03] who you are it's not that you
[39:05] now listen this end time
[39:08] photoshop and all those different things
[39:10] yeah they just about almost create you
[39:13] but back when brother brown was talking
[39:14] about it you couldn't do that you
[39:16] couldn't manipulate
[39:17] um pictures like that so what he was
[39:19] saying was it had to be something
[39:22] that's what i believe he's talking about
[39:24] questions and answers on the seals he
[39:25] said
[39:26] something's going on something he said
[39:28] the voice of god is in this building
[39:33] now the literal voice of god but who was
[39:35] picking it up
[39:37] he said it's gone from you let's read
[39:40] that let's go right down to number eight
[39:43] don't make yourself odd to be a
[39:44] christian because you see you take
[39:45] yourself away from god
[39:47] and you you you there's that you you you
[39:50] and you you you if you can understand it
[39:52] this is that third pull
[39:53] see you kind of stuttered on that we're
[39:55] talking about brother i'm stuttering
[39:57] seeing what god would have him to say
[39:59] you should have caught that the other
[40:00] day
[40:01] you remember there'll be no
[40:02] impersonation like there was of the
[40:04] other two
[40:05] see so that's as far as you you should
[40:08] know now just remember
[40:10] that you see now there's something
[40:11] taking place in this room now he's
[40:13] pretty specific
[40:15] he said there's something taking place
[40:16] in this room in other words that's the
[40:18] tabernacle while he's preaching there's
[40:20] something going on
[40:22] and that's pretty um you know
[40:26] they should have went man where is it
[40:28] what's going on
[40:30] but watch
[40:33] so that's as far as you should know now
[40:35] just remember
[40:36] that you see now there's something
[40:38] taking place in this room
[40:40] and there's something here
[40:44] there's there's actual in this room
[40:47] angels voice of god
[40:52] not just an angel's voice voice of god
[40:56] but how you you can't he's
[40:59] he's trying he he's trying he's trying
[41:02] not to tell them it ain't for them but
[41:04] he's going to anyway later on
[41:07] but watch what he's but look how do you
[41:09] you you can't uh
[41:11] now watch if you can't hear the natural
[41:13] voice without something to send it out
[41:17] how are you going to hear the spiritual
[41:19] voice exactly
[41:20] right now you might make believe that
[41:24] somebody is singing this certain song
[41:25] mate believe there's no make believing
[41:27] god
[41:30] you might may believe he's preaching on
[41:31] something besides what he's preaching on
[41:34] but now watch this that might not even
[41:38] be there see
[41:39] but when it actually strikes the crystal
[41:42] that it's supposed to strike
[41:46] that it's supposed to strike not any
[41:49] crystal
[41:50] not any crystal in the spectrum of all
[41:52] the different
[41:53] different waves and different things no
[41:54] there's one
[41:56] when it actually strikes the crystal
[41:58] that it's supposed to strike
[41:59] look then it gives a true interpretation
[42:04] and vindicates it by showing the picture
[42:08] vindicates it by showing the picture
[42:11] what is the picture
[42:15] this is the picture that wasn't the
[42:18] picture
[42:19] they weren't getting the seals you and i
[42:21] are getting the seal
[42:24] amen it vindicates it by showing
[42:28] the picture see what i mean now the
[42:30] spirit of god look watch this
[42:31] now the spirit of god when it speaks
[42:34] through the true word
[42:36] it vindicates itself to show itself that
[42:39] it's right you understand now
[42:41] he said all right which they probably
[42:43] didn't and look not belittling those
[42:45] people at all i'm just telling you
[42:47] they had a time and a place i want to
[42:50] ask you something though
[42:51] are you stuck back there no come on
[42:54] are you stuck back there under what god
[42:57] sent a prophet
[43:00] you got to ask yourself that question
[43:02] are you stuck back there with them going
[43:04] oh
[43:05] god set a prophet all we got to do is
[43:07] press play
[43:09] that's stuck in another time
[43:13] and it's not the right crystal
[43:17] this is the right crystal today you're
[43:19] hearing
[43:20] not just from me you're hearing by a
[43:22] five-fold ministry you're hearing the
[43:24] right crystal
[43:25] now do you have the right right crystal
[43:28] to take it
[43:29] right because you got to be cut the same
[43:33] as the one that's sending it
[43:36] or you can't pick it up
[43:40] so we got to be cut the same but thank
[43:44] god there is a fourth dimension
[43:46] it's a horrible time brother brown said
[43:48] you know even demons and
[43:49] and cancer and all that travels in the
[43:52] fourth dimension
[43:53] but so does god so does his angels
[43:56] they free travel through the fourth
[43:58] dimension it's just according to what
[43:59] you listen to
[44:04] and what you let go down to here from
[44:05] here to here all right now we talked
[44:08] about the fifth dimension
[44:11] which is hell
[44:14] all right everybody got that now the
[44:16] fifth dimension is where the sinner the
[44:18] unbeliever
[44:19] dies and goes to now look the fifth the
[44:21] fifth dimension is kind of well
[44:23] the horrible dimension now and when a
[44:26] christian dies he goes into the sixth
[44:28] dimension and god is in the seventh
[44:29] dimension we'll cover those a little bit
[44:31] later
[44:32] now then you see the christian when he
[44:34] dies he goes under the altar of god
[44:36] look right into the presence of god now
[44:38] look be careful with that
[44:40] because you don't go into the presence
[44:43] of the almighty
[44:44] person of god everybody understand that
[44:49] because remember when brother branham
[44:50] will read it next sunday when brother
[44:52] brown goes in the sixth dimension he
[44:53] said where's jesus he said i want to see
[44:54] him
[44:55] he said you can't see him now he's high
[44:57] or what he's in a faster dimension
[44:59] than even what brother brown had got
[45:01] himself into which was way faster than
[45:03] where his body was laying
[45:05] back down there about 20 feet below him
[45:10] now the fifth dimension now you see the
[45:12] christian when he dies he goes under the
[45:14] altar of god right into the
[45:15] see that is the presence of god we feel
[45:18] the presence of god here
[45:19] but that is the presence of god in that
[45:21] sixth dimension there's not
[45:23] good days and bad days
[45:26] there's not trouble in heartaches and
[45:28] trials one day and
[45:30] sunny day is the next no you've went
[45:32] into the presence of god
[45:34] as much as you're going to get until god
[45:36] himself comes
[45:41] but listen let's take it while we can
[45:44] take every bit of what we can because
[45:45] we're sitting in heavenly places in
[45:46] christ jesus the bible tells us
[45:49] all right now look to break it down when
[45:52] a man has a nightmare
[45:54] he's not altogether asleep neither is he
[45:55] awake something like some of y'all that
[45:58] are sitting here right now
[45:59] he's between sleeping awake
[46:03] and not you no you're good
[46:06] he ate he said he ate too much sweets he
[46:08] might take a nap so you all just be bear
[46:09] with him i told him if he did it quietly
[46:11] it wouldn't matter most y'all do the
[46:12] same thing
[46:13] and that's what makes him have a
[46:17] horrible shaking and screaming because
[46:18] he's not asleep
[46:20] and he's not awake to take that and to
[46:23] take that
[46:24] shows where a man goes when he dies
[46:26] unconverted
[46:27] he's lived his time out now listen right
[46:29] here
[46:30] you say well now all those old testament
[46:32] saints they weren't born again so they
[46:34] must have been
[46:35] no they're not there they're not in a
[46:37] horrible place they didn't
[46:39] they were not unconverted they were
[46:41] converted for their time
[46:44] they had faith for their time they
[46:46] believed in their prophets
[46:48] they believed listen i'll read this in
[46:50] just a minute i'm going to read all
[46:51] these quotes
[46:52] where brother brown talks about look
[46:54] when jesus we we
[46:56] dwell on when jesus went to hell and
[46:59] preached to the souls in prison
[47:01] that were that repent did not repent in
[47:04] the long suffering of the days
[47:05] of of noah right so that was before the
[47:08] flood
[47:08] all those people that were that that
[47:10] were unconverted
[47:12] he preached to them but now remember
[47:15] there was a converted group down there
[47:17] called paradise because he didn't stop
[47:20] and go from hell all the way back
[47:22] up and rows on in this dimension no he
[47:25] had to stop
[47:26] and pick up the ones that were converted
[47:28] so there was an unconverted bunch
[47:30] but remember the converted bunch
[47:34] had several that were before
[47:38] the flood because there was eight souls
[47:40] that were saved
[47:42] right i don't argue with the prophet
[47:46] i don't know about ham but you don't
[47:49] understand what i mean
[47:50] but i'll read it to you in just a minute
[47:53] you argue with that but you know what
[47:55] we're not to argue about things like
[47:56] that because that really has nothing to
[47:57] do with our salvation but it does show
[47:59] the plan of redemption
[48:00] and how it works down through the time
[48:02] all right is everybody okay with that
[48:04] so to break it down a man goes
[48:07] dies unconverted he's lived his time up
[48:10] he's dead on earth and he cannot go in
[48:12] the presence of god
[48:13] because he's not fit to go there without
[48:16] the blood
[48:17] now remember now you can put paradise in
[48:19] that group
[48:20] because brother brown is going to say
[48:22] they can't go in the presence of god
[48:24] because the blood of bulls and goats
[48:25] covers their sin they still took it with
[48:27] them
[48:29] until christ come and emptied paradise
[48:33] apparent to me paradise is wonderful
[48:36] because it was a group of people that
[48:37] never saw jesus never
[48:39] never saw jesus christ kind of like the
[48:41] fifth sealed jew
[48:44] didn't care about that i mean they
[48:46] didn't know i didn't say they don't care
[48:47] but but
[48:48] they least listen to their prophet and
[48:50] and they died
[48:51] realizing that something was coming
[48:54] right
[48:54] job said i know my redeemer liveth and
[48:57] six thousand or five thousand years
[48:58] later
[48:59] here he come but he before even that
[49:02] happened
[49:04] he was waiting isaiah
[49:08] ezekiel we'll read it in just a minute
[49:15] he cannot come back to earth he's caught
[49:19] because his time's finished here on
[49:20] earth and he's caught between he's in a
[49:23] nightmare now remember hell's not
[49:24] burning we already read that i think
[49:26] we'll read it here again
[49:29] he can't go in the presence of god to
[49:31] rest
[49:33] could you imagine dying all them years
[49:35] ago and you can't rest
[49:38] boy those in the sixth dimension we're
[49:39] just resting kind of like some of y'all
[49:41] now
[49:42] resting with your eyes closed but now
[49:45] them in the fifth dimension i promise
[49:46] you they're not sleeping
[49:50] they know they're in a wrong place
[49:54] and he's caught he cannot come back to
[49:56] earth because his time's finished
[49:58] and he's caught between he's in a
[49:59] nightmare see he can't go in the
[50:01] presence of god to rest
[50:03] he can't back come to earth because his
[50:05] time's up
[50:07] he's in a nightmare and there he stays
[50:10] until the day of judgment
[50:14] a horrible thing to be in see
[50:17] first peter 3 verse 18 says for christ
[50:19] also hath
[50:20] once suffered for sin the just for the
[50:23] unjust that he might bring us to god
[50:25] being put to death in the flesh but
[50:27] quickened by the spirit by which also he
[50:29] went and preached unto the spirits in
[50:31] prison
[50:32] which sometimes were disobedient who
[50:34] wants the long-suffering
[50:35] of god what's the long-suffering god 120
[50:38] years man preached
[50:39] one sermon not go up to that's your
[50:41] perfect man not wait on the seals
[50:44] it's gonna rain get ready to get in the
[50:46] ark
[50:47] it's gonna rain while the ark was
[50:51] preparing wearing few
[50:52] that is eight souls were saved by water
[50:56] look at number 10 souls are in prison
[50:57] now prophet god said now jesus
[50:59] after he'd finished his ministry
[51:02] watch this preach to those souls that
[51:04] were unsavable
[51:07] how did he know that for knowledge
[51:10] listen if he hadn't had foreign
[51:12] knowledge how big would that boat had to
[51:14] be
[51:16] that boat only held eight human beings
[51:20] and whatever two of each kind that was
[51:22] it
[51:23] ever how big it is
[51:26] if i was no i'd be going lord
[51:30] how can we get all these people
[51:33] because you know like brother brown said
[51:34] there were some that didn't believe none
[51:36] at all and there were some that kind of
[51:37] hung around the door
[51:40] i mean noah's got man you've got to get
[51:42] in this ark
[51:44] i don't know where we're going to put
[51:45] you but see god knew
[51:47] that at the very end as soon as he shut
[51:49] that door he knew there was nobody else
[51:52] same way with the gentile door once he
[51:54] shuts that door there'll be no other
[51:55] gentiles say
[51:56] but he knows who that is all right they
[51:58] were unsavable they could not
[52:00] ever be saved see there's the
[52:02] foreknowledge of god
[52:03] that if he'd give them all a million
[52:04] years put them past the flood down to
[52:06] this day
[52:07] they still would not repent they would
[52:08] deny what you're listening to right now
[52:11] they would deny jesus just like caiaphas
[52:13] did that same denial spirit didn't die
[52:17] on that side of the flood it came right
[52:19] on over here in ham and all the
[52:21] different ones and all the way down
[52:22] nimrod and all the different ones down
[52:23] that way
[52:27] because brother brown said people die
[52:29] spirits known
[52:33] that same spirit that persecuted jesus
[52:34] went over and persecuted the jews
[52:37] listen when mercy was given to them they
[52:40] spurned mercy now they're waiting for
[52:41] the judgment
[52:42] oh what a time that must have been oh i
[52:44] wish there was some way
[52:45] i could shake the world with that to let
[52:48] them see
[52:48] what the reality is souls in prison
[52:51] paragraph 108 let's go to
[52:53] number 11. but after the days of his
[52:55] preaching his ministry continued on
[52:58] because the last group he preached to
[52:59] was the souls that were in hell
[53:01] that could not be forgiven i have
[53:03] clearly read that from the bible from ii
[53:05] peter he went and preached to the souls
[53:06] that were in prison
[53:07] which is hell locked up until the day of
[53:09] judgment because you see the judgment
[53:11] isn't now and there's no burning hell
[53:14] now
[53:15] see that's another thing your
[53:16] denominationals think when once you're
[53:19] once you're dead
[53:19] and you go to hell you're burning no
[53:22] they don't know nothing about a fifth
[53:23] dimension or a sixth dimension or
[53:25] fourth dimension thank god it took a
[53:27] profit
[53:28] to go into every one of them basically
[53:33] to tell us what was going on because
[53:34] brother byron said i was in both places
[53:37] i remember at jcpenney's and that and
[53:40] when he was falling
[53:41] when he was a kid he was falling
[53:42] remember and he said god saved me
[53:45] because you see the judgment isn't now
[53:46] and there is no burning hell now
[53:48] somebody tell you the guy is in burning
[53:50] hell now that's wrong
[53:52] see a judge of this earth is just just
[53:54] enough
[53:55] to never condemn a man until he's
[53:57] brought to trial and god will never
[53:59] throw a man
[53:59] into the fiery furnace until first he is
[54:01] condemned by god's own laws
[54:04] he rejected mercy so you see he first
[54:07] has to have a trial and the trial is the
[54:09] great white throne judgment
[54:10] but now he's in a place called a prison
[54:13] house
[54:13] so he's locked in the fifth dimension
[54:15] can't get out of the fifth dimension
[54:17] all right so let's look at the sixth
[54:18] dimension real quick
[54:21] hope that wasn't too fast for you let's
[54:22] see if you put that on 1.25
[54:25] but i want to get to this right here
[54:26] because i was going to go jump into the
[54:28] sixth dimension but i thought no
[54:30] let's talk about paradise for a minute
[54:32] because it's very important
[54:34] because it helps to see the true
[54:37] doctrine
[54:38] that nobody in the old testament was
[54:39] saved as we are saved
[54:41] now they're justified under the blood of
[54:44] bulls and goats
[54:46] but they're not born again okay
[54:49] they're put in a place but watch this
[54:51] now the sixth dimension i'm going to
[54:53] talk
[54:53] just for a second now the sixth
[54:54] dimension is christ
[54:56] in christ the saints dead saints are
[54:59] look
[55:00] resting saints who is completely work
[55:02] finished on earth and has entered into
[55:04] rest with christ
[55:06] under the altar beautifully you could
[55:08] parallel parallel it like a wonderful
[55:10] dream
[55:11] that you didn't want to wake up from now
[55:13] that's a big
[55:14] contrast to the ones that want to wake
[55:16] up in the fifth dimension
[55:18] but look it ain't a dream
[55:21] that's kind of southern but this ain't a
[55:23] dream
[55:24] it's natural it's real
[55:27] but i'm just making a parable for you
[55:29] because the seventh dimension
[55:30] is god alone so now we're going to talk
[55:32] about paradise
[55:34] and let's go to luke 23 verse 42 because
[55:39] paradise was before the sixth dimension
[55:43] see there was not a six dimension saints
[55:45] dimension
[55:47] anywhere in the old testament
[55:50] okay because there was no new birth
[55:54] that eradicated their sins so they
[55:55] couldn't go in the presence of god
[55:57] these people in the sixth dimension they
[55:58] had their sins eradicated
[56:00] on earth by what accepting jesus christ
[56:03] jesus christ
[56:04] cleaned their soul out and made them a
[56:06] what a wheat
[56:08] and that wheat is what went into the
[56:10] sixth dimension the kuckleberg had to
[56:11] stay here
[56:12] because the cuckoo bear's not going yet
[56:15] right they got to come back and get the
[56:16] huckleberry but once they come into that
[56:18] body new body which is the body they
[56:20] live then
[56:22] it's made new all right everybody okay
[56:24] with that
[56:26] because remember there's no
[56:26] transmigration of souls you can't take
[56:28] this soul and put it over here
[56:29] no you're connected with when you're
[56:31] given a soul when you're born that's you
[56:34] that's right that carries you either to
[56:35] heaven or hell
[56:40] luke 23 verse 42 why in the world would
[56:44] jesus resurrect in the body he was
[56:46] beat up in nail scars if it didn't mean
[56:49] something
[56:50] he stayed and actually he stayed in the
[56:52] exact body he's in
[56:54] all right and he said unto jesus lord
[56:57] remember me
[56:58] when thou comest into thy kingdom now
[57:01] watch
[57:02] jesus had to correct him because
[57:03] remember the kingdom is the baptism of
[57:05] the holy ghost
[57:06] watch what jesus said though this is the
[57:08] thief on the cross right before he died
[57:10] i told him i said you know there's been
[57:11] a lot of people in paradise brother russ
[57:12] but now
[57:13] this guy this thief he wasn't in paradox
[57:16] but about a day and a half
[57:18] because he came up you know with him and
[57:20] went on into
[57:21] into glory now watch jesus said unto him
[57:23] verily i say unto thee today
[57:26] today because they died the same day
[57:29] today shalt thou be with me in paradise
[57:34] so there was paradise the bosom of
[57:36] abraham what we saw
[57:38] where lazarus was in that condition
[57:41] after he died because lazarus wasn't in
[57:43] the sixth dimension lazarus wasn't a
[57:44] born again believer
[57:45] maybe he was after jesus died but this
[57:47] lazarus we're talking about
[57:49] is old testament you got to remember
[57:51] listen even
[57:52] jesus died under the old testament
[57:56] but he said this is the new testament in
[57:58] my blood it had to be when he come out
[58:00] of the grave
[58:02] that was a new testament the testator
[58:05] had died
[58:06] the old testator had died and now a new
[58:09] testament
[58:12] the book of acts had to come into being
[58:17] and there stephen was the first martyr
[58:18] so he was the first one to step into
[58:20] that sixth dimension
[58:22] had it already prepared because you know
[58:24] what jesus said
[58:27] jesus said my kingdom's come
[58:32] my kingdom is what my kingdom is right
[58:34] here
[58:37] so what do you do when he come back on
[58:38] the day of pentecost he brought the
[58:40] kingdom back
[58:42] he brought the holy ghost back but it
[58:43] wasn't that the holy ghost could go and
[58:45] anoint somebody
[58:47] it could go into peter not anoint peter
[58:52] peter had a problem with a few things
[58:55] temper patience
[58:59] that's why i believe peter wrote ii
[59:02] peter
[59:03] about how to go up that statue of
[59:04] perfect man because peter had to get rid
[59:06] of every one of them
[59:08] peter was a prime example
[59:11] i i no lord i'll cut i'll i'll hack them
[59:15] into
[59:16] let them touch you one time jesus said
[59:19] before the croc
[59:23] rooster crows one
[59:26] three times you'll deny me you know why
[59:29] because peter didn't have the kingdom
[59:31] inside of him
[59:32] he was talking to the kingdom and the
[59:33] kingdom was saying look you got some
[59:35] work to do
[59:37] we got to work on you but you know what
[59:39] peter i prayed for you
[59:41] and i like what it said when he went to
[59:43] the tomb he said go get my disciples and
[59:46] peter
[59:47] because he knew peter was probably over
[59:49] there somewhere going man
[59:51] he told me i was going to deny him three
[59:53] times
[59:54] i wonder peter didn't go crazy but he
[59:57] didn't because he had a commission
[1:00:01] now let's look at number a
[1:00:07] this is demonology in 1953.
[1:00:10] now this witch of endor she called up
[1:00:11] the spirit of samuel
[1:00:13] and saul talked to samuel so there must
[1:00:15] be something
[1:00:17] that dimension was not exactly all the
[1:00:19] way set
[1:00:20] because she brought him up and she saw
[1:00:22] him and
[1:00:23] saul saw him and saul could talk to him
[1:00:25] kind of like
[1:00:26] lazarus than the rich young ruler they
[1:00:28] could talk to each other
[1:00:29] but they couldn't go and move from one
[1:00:31] place to the other everybody got that
[1:00:33] saying ma'am
[1:00:34] if you say a man a few times you won't
[1:00:35] go to sleep
[1:00:38] amen amen amen
[1:00:43] okay you might wonder how that could be
[1:00:46] done watch
[1:00:47] now we heard with our own ears a man
[1:00:49] stand up somewhere in
[1:00:50] up north and tell us that that's the
[1:00:52] reason brother adam can come back
[1:00:54] it's because of that right there did we
[1:00:56] not hear that
[1:00:58] those of you that went with us to that
[1:00:59] place up north
[1:01:01] heard it with our own ears the little
[1:01:04] guy was just a little arrogant
[1:01:06] dude he said see there
[1:01:10] samuel was brought back from another
[1:01:11] dimension
[1:01:13] of course they were trying to push their
[1:01:15] brother brown is going to come back
[1:01:18] that's under the blood of bulls and
[1:01:20] goats it can be done the prophet they
[1:01:22] say is going to come back we'll tell you
[1:01:23] in just a minute
[1:01:24] that it can't be done anymore because he
[1:01:27] said that's catholicism
[1:01:29] whoa that's communing with saints
[1:01:35] all right listen it cannot be done today
[1:01:38] no sir
[1:01:40] he just answered it now you might wonder
[1:01:43] how that could be done
[1:01:44] it cannot be done today no sir because
[1:01:46] the blood of bulls and goats was only
[1:01:48] a waiting for the time of what
[1:01:51] fulfillment
[1:01:52] when a man died in them days preachers
[1:01:55] back me up if you think is right
[1:01:58] when a man died he died under the
[1:01:59] atonement of an animal
[1:02:02] and his soul went into paradise and
[1:02:04] there he stayed until
[1:02:06] that to the to the day of redemption and
[1:02:09] his
[1:02:09] soul was in there so it wasn't just some
[1:02:13] spiritual
[1:02:14] thing it was his soul it was that person
[1:02:16] all right now look demonology number b
[1:02:19] now this brother i'll tell you something
[1:02:21] we need to be skinned down and rubbed a
[1:02:22] little bit
[1:02:23] to see where we're standing amen
[1:02:27] don't you think so make right right any
[1:02:30] person look if those saints now i'm not
[1:02:32] condemning catholic saints
[1:02:34] but look listen to this
[1:02:37] look the reason that the witch of endor
[1:02:41] could call the spirit of samuel
[1:02:43] because samuel couldn't go into the
[1:02:44] presence of god
[1:02:46] if they bring if they think can't bring
[1:02:47] william branham back into this dimension
[1:02:50] then our prophet never went in the
[1:02:52] presence of god
[1:02:55] that's what they're saying
[1:02:58] because samuel couldn't go into the
[1:03:00] presence of god and that little guy he
[1:03:02] just laid it out with a witchman door
[1:03:04] called samuel up
[1:03:06] everybody recognized him and he was the
[1:03:09] problem is samuel never got into this
[1:03:11] dimension
[1:03:14] right he was talking to saul saul was in
[1:03:17] this dimension the timeline matter the
[1:03:19] three
[1:03:20] dimensions but now he called she called
[1:03:22] him from another dimension
[1:03:24] watch now look i'm losing my voice
[1:03:28] i have to talk one talking 1.0
[1:03:33] i'm not condemning catholic saints but
[1:03:35] look the reason that
[1:03:37] the witch of endor could call the spirit
[1:03:38] of samuel because samuel couldn't go
[1:03:40] into the presence of god
[1:03:42] he was in paradise for the blood of
[1:03:44] bulls and goats would not take away
[1:03:46] sin now it didn't make them sinners
[1:03:49] but their sin was covered only covered
[1:03:53] it was still there but since jesus died
[1:03:57] he divorced sin and taken away sin
[1:04:00] and the believer now goes into the
[1:04:02] presence of god
[1:04:04] and he can't come back
[1:04:09] he can't come back jesus said in luke
[1:04:12] when he was talking about the rich man
[1:04:14] he can't return so if you're interceding
[1:04:18] with any kind of spirit of someone
[1:04:20] that's gone on
[1:04:22] outside of god christ the only mediator
[1:04:25] between god and man
[1:04:26] then you're in spiritualism called
[1:04:29] religion
[1:04:31] now where is spiritualism at so be
[1:04:34] careful what you say about the spirit of
[1:04:36] god
[1:04:37] communion with saints is spiritualism
[1:04:41] i'm not making that up i'm reading it
[1:04:43] right from the prophet of god
[1:04:46] now let's read this one right here
[1:04:47] demonology owensboro kentucky
[1:04:50] he preached demonology and yeah that's
[1:04:51] from your hometown
[1:04:55] demonology here he comes climbing up
[1:05:02] brother she's coming near daylight i can
[1:05:05] see the big morning star looking around
[1:05:06] the grave already
[1:05:08] amen he can tell a story make it so real
[1:05:11] it's coming on the third day hallelujah
[1:05:14] wait he's got somebody else over here in
[1:05:16] paradise
[1:05:17] so he don't forget nobody pass me not
[1:05:20] old gentle savior hear my humble cry
[1:05:23] over here in paradise lay some souls
[1:05:26] abraham isaac jacob sarah and those
[1:05:27] who've been faithful look
[1:05:29] believing the promise of the prophets
[1:05:33] and they're laying there waiting with
[1:05:34] only the blood of bulls and goats
[1:05:37] look a shadow or a type of his own blood
[1:05:41] i can see him go up to paradise brother
[1:05:43] i'm not
[1:05:44] knocked on the door so there must have
[1:05:47] been a
[1:05:48] a space there right
[1:05:52] rich young ruler can't get in
[1:05:57] lazarus can't get out but when jesus
[1:06:00] knocks on the door
[1:06:03] here's the reason they're there abraham
[1:06:05] the faith of abraham or the bosom of
[1:06:07] abraham is what they call it
[1:06:08] abraham to open the door who are you he
[1:06:11] said i am the seed of abraham i can hear
[1:06:12] daniel say what
[1:06:14] that's the stone i've seen hewed out of
[1:06:16] a mountain without hands now look
[1:06:17] they never saw jesus they saw him in
[1:06:19] simple form
[1:06:21] but every one of them in paradise
[1:06:25] abraham said sarah that's the man we fed
[1:06:27] the calf to
[1:06:30] melchizedek
[1:06:33] ezekiel said what i saw him coming with
[1:06:35] such speed
[1:06:36] to it looked like he was powerful with a
[1:06:38] dust under his feet what the wheel in
[1:06:40] the middle of the wheel
[1:06:42] i can hear one prophet say i wrestled
[1:06:44] with this man all night
[1:06:48] at the river before i crossed hallelujah
[1:06:51] now look
[1:06:54] john the different ones recognized him
[1:06:58] that's john the baptist because john the
[1:07:01] baptist was
[1:07:02] put in paradise when he died as great as
[1:07:05] john was because remember jesus said and
[1:07:07] i didn't bring that quote
[1:07:08] but you ought to know what jesus said he
[1:07:10] said the least in the kingdom
[1:07:14] was greater than john why because john
[1:07:17] didn't have the new birth
[1:07:19] right john had the baptism of the holy
[1:07:20] ghost an anointing
[1:07:22] but he's in this same place that all
[1:07:24] these other people are
[1:07:25] amen so that proves if you don't if you
[1:07:28] if you didn't believe it maybe you ought
[1:07:29] to believe it now
[1:07:31] that the people in the old testament did
[1:07:32] not have the new birth even john
[1:07:36] listen that sixth dimension is only four
[1:07:39] that genesis 1 26
[1:07:41] promised children of god that was before
[1:07:44] the foundation of the world
[1:07:45] god said i'm going to put a man right
[1:07:47] here in this place
[1:07:49] and i'm not going to move them they
[1:07:52] ain't going to want to come back here
[1:07:54] until the people that are here conquer
[1:07:58] death john the different ones
[1:08:02] recognized him all right look in 1964
[1:08:06] questions and answers number two know
[1:08:09] there's a time that the people didn't go
[1:08:11] into the presence of god
[1:08:13] when they died look they're justified
[1:08:15] they were justified
[1:08:18] they believed on not the lord jesus
[1:08:20] christ but who
[1:08:21] who was talking to them the lord jesus
[1:08:24] in jehovah or in whatever you want to
[1:08:26] call him the old testament jehovah god
[1:08:30] they were speaking of that jehovah god
[1:08:31] which dad jehovah god was jesus christ
[1:08:37] they went what
[1:08:38] look that was in the old testament
[1:08:42] they went into a place called paradise
[1:08:44] and there the souls of the just
[1:08:46] waited in paradise but paradise was a
[1:08:49] place where god kept the souls
[1:08:52] in like a dreamland
[1:08:56] not at rest i don't think not turn back
[1:08:59] to young man and woman
[1:09:01] because samuel wasn't
[1:09:04] moses and elijah they recognized them
[1:09:06] they must not have been turned back
[1:09:08] why jesus christ hadn't come to totally
[1:09:11] eradicate
[1:09:12] that sin until the
[1:09:16] look kept the souls in their dream land
[1:09:19] until the blood of jesus christ was shed
[1:09:21] for the blood of bulls and goats would
[1:09:23] not take away sin
[1:09:25] it only covered up sin but jesus's blood
[1:09:28] takes away sin
[1:09:30] you notice that when he died at calvary
[1:09:32] and on his return
[1:09:35] let me let me make sure i read this
[1:09:36] right
[1:09:39] excuse me
[1:09:43] what number of my own number
[1:09:46] i got them all c d number d right
[1:09:49] right there we go and you notice when he
[1:09:52] died at calvary on his return
[1:09:54] he brought out from the grave those dead
[1:09:56] saints that had died under the atonement
[1:09:58] of blood of bulls and goats and heifers
[1:09:59] and they entered into the city and
[1:10:01] appeared to many now we know that they
[1:10:03] came out of paradise
[1:10:04] paradise was emptied up let me read this
[1:10:06] one right here because this one
[1:10:08] is really neat number e
[1:10:12] let me tell you what happened this
[1:10:15] wasn't
[1:10:15] a quiet scene
[1:10:20] probably on easter morning that
[1:10:22] graveyard was as
[1:10:23] quiet as it could be wasn't nothing
[1:10:27] stirring at all
[1:10:30] but buddy in another dimension
[1:10:33] there was something going on watch this
[1:10:37] no wonder it brings emotions no wonder
[1:10:39] the human heart cannot contain it
[1:10:41] oh with our conquering faith we can
[1:10:43] stand yonder and say we're
[1:10:45] justified forever freely because he died
[1:10:49] and was buried and god raised him up
[1:10:50] again on easter morning
[1:10:52] then god showed that it was accepted all
[1:10:55] the things that he did
[1:10:58] everything freely paid you can go free
[1:11:00] now
[1:11:02] rising he justified freely forever
[1:11:05] all no one can never know can never
[1:11:08] think of that great day when he rose up
[1:11:11] and the angel saw it and the heavens of
[1:11:13] heavens the angels sang the praises of
[1:11:15] god and rejoiced
[1:11:16] while the old testament saints in
[1:11:19] paradise shouted hallelujah
[1:11:22] rising you justifying the heavens shook
[1:11:25] the earth shook paradise shook
[1:11:28] and i know hell shook
[1:11:32] because remember he went to hell first
[1:11:34] took the keys from the devil
[1:11:36] and his little his little angels looked
[1:11:38] around and said
[1:11:39] we got a leader that can't even get us
[1:11:41] in our house anymore
[1:11:44] amen because jesus took them all
[1:11:47] hell shook when that great voice come
[1:11:50] forth
[1:11:50] up from the grave he arose rising he
[1:11:53] justified freely forever
[1:11:56] oh my let's look at the future home
[1:12:01] death doesn't change you death only
[1:12:04] changes your dwelling place
[1:12:07] remember samuel when he was dead and
[1:12:10] been buried for two years
[1:12:12] he was in paradise and the witch of
[1:12:16] endor called him up
[1:12:17] and looked and saul recognized him
[1:12:22] it must have been somebody he knew two
[1:12:23] years ago not 40 or 50 or 80 years ago
[1:12:27] and the winston which vendor called him
[1:12:29] up and saw recognized him
[1:12:31] and she did too and fell upon her face
[1:12:35] he hadn't changed one bit he was still
[1:12:38] the same samuel after being dead two
[1:12:40] years he was still a prophet
[1:12:42] he said tomorrow you'll fall in battle
[1:12:44] your son with you and by this time
[1:12:46] tomorrow night you'll be with me
[1:12:49] and that's just what happened see
[1:12:52] and when moses returns back in elijah
[1:12:54] for revelations 11
[1:12:55] there'll still be prophets
[1:12:59] all right let's listen to this right
[1:13:00] here
[1:13:02] this is we'll stop right here now
[1:13:04] remember
[1:13:06] brother brown talks about the different
[1:13:07] raptures there's more than just one
[1:13:13] you got it there's more than just one
[1:13:16] there's about four
[1:13:19] one we're going to talk about one two is
[1:13:21] us
[1:13:22] three is 144 000 and four is the general
[1:13:24] resurrection
[1:13:25] right the old testament saints has gone
[1:13:27] into its presence
[1:13:29] paradise done away and the old testament
[1:13:32] saints ascended up at his loud voice
[1:13:34] when he screamed and gave up the ghost
[1:13:36] why
[1:13:36] the sacrifice the perpetuation of their
[1:13:39] sins that they had waited on
[1:13:41] believing that perfect lamb was coming
[1:13:44] see they believed their prophets
[1:13:47] just like we should believe our prophet
[1:13:52] not that he's coming back he's already
[1:13:54] brought it
[1:13:58] because why the sacrifice the
[1:14:00] perpetuation of their sins that they had
[1:14:02] waited on
[1:14:02] believing that perfect lamb was coming
[1:14:05] they had offered the sacrifice the lamb
[1:14:07] and when he died and yielded up the
[1:14:09] ghost
[1:14:09] he screamed with a loud voice and the
[1:14:11] old testament saints awoke
[1:14:13] look watch the shout
[1:14:16] and the voice because remember the
[1:14:17] second coming he comes
[1:14:19] shout voice trump
[1:14:22] shout voice and same thing that is
[1:14:26] coming
[1:14:26] yielded up the ghost and when he did the
[1:14:28] sacrifice was perfect
[1:14:30] paradise was emptied out of the old
[1:14:31] testament saints came to the earth again
[1:14:33] walked around on the earth and entered
[1:14:35] in with him at his
[1:14:37] rapture but now let's continue on same
[1:14:40] just keep going david said over there
[1:14:42] lift up your everlasting gates and be
[1:14:44] lifted up he let captive captive give
[1:14:47] gifts unto men the old testament saints
[1:14:49] went in with him
[1:14:50] they said who is this king of
[1:14:51] righteousness the lord of glory mighty
[1:14:54] and host mighty host here they come in
[1:14:56] marching
[1:14:58] now look watch what happens because i
[1:15:01] want we need to stop here and
[1:15:02] look at something jesus led captivity
[1:15:04] captain and here he comes with the old
[1:15:06] testament saints
[1:15:07] and went in the new gates up there
[1:15:11] and said lift up the everlasting gates
[1:15:12] be lifted up let the king glory come in
[1:15:15] the voice came from the inside who is
[1:15:16] the king of glory the lord mighty in
[1:15:18] battle
[1:15:18] the gates fall open now listen that has
[1:15:20] nothing to do with a future home
[1:15:25] because he's taken the old testament
[1:15:27] saints
[1:15:29] that has nothing to do with the future
[1:15:30] home what is the future home it's for
[1:15:32] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:15:35] bride and these people are not bride
[1:15:38] if you're not born again you're not
[1:15:39] bride john was not bride
[1:15:42] john the baptist sorry john the
[1:15:44] revelator was john the baptist was not
[1:15:47] anybody got that even abraham he's not
[1:15:49] considered bride right
[1:15:53] he has a part he has a place but he's
[1:15:54] not bride
[1:15:59] the lord mighty in battle so so look
[1:16:01] what are you saying brother way that's
[1:16:02] not the ho that's not the city john saw
[1:16:04] coming down in revelation 22.
[1:16:06] that must be another place that they're
[1:16:08] being held at
[1:16:11] but i believe they if paradise is
[1:16:13] emptied out then they did change back
[1:16:15] and they went somewhere
[1:16:17] and they're waiting on me and you
[1:16:20] according to hebrews 11 40.
[1:16:22] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:16:25] sure they're in a condition
[1:16:26] but they're not perfect how can you make
[1:16:29] somebody
[1:16:30] that died under the blood of bulls and
[1:16:32] goats that never knew jesus christ more
[1:16:34] perfect than me and you
[1:16:37] are before us can't happen
[1:16:42] not part of the plan right
[1:16:45] well i didn't get many amens on that not
[1:16:48] part of the plan
[1:16:49] you talked about yeah no they're not
[1:16:51] proud part of the bride plan
[1:16:54] they're part of the whole eternal plan
[1:16:56] of redemption they will be there
[1:16:58] but listen it's not recorded
[1:17:02] anywhere that they're going to be in the
[1:17:05] city with us
[1:17:12] you've got your 12 patriarchs you've got
[1:17:14] your 12 tribes of israel
[1:17:16] i mean you're 12 apostles and 12
[1:17:18] prophets
[1:17:21] but there's no recording that abraham's
[1:17:23] going to live in the city
[1:17:25] there's no recording that isaiah is
[1:17:26] going to live in the city because that
[1:17:28] city is
[1:17:29] only for the bride
[1:17:32] now they're part of the economy of god
[1:17:34] no more no less
[1:17:36] right but they're not going to live in
[1:17:38] that city because brother brown said
[1:17:39] only in that city
[1:17:41] that city is made what by the bride
[1:17:44] by her desire
[1:17:49] now i want god god's going to brag on us
[1:17:53] i'm not bragging on me i'm bragging on
[1:17:55] what god's already done
[1:17:57] right the lord mighty in battle the
[1:18:00] gates flew open
[1:18:02] and jesus a conqueror led captive
[1:18:03] captive then they had believed on him
[1:18:06] and the word had come to them
[1:18:08] there the old testament saints laying in
[1:18:10] their waiting
[1:18:11] he led captivity captive ascended on
[1:18:13] high took the old testament saints and
[1:18:15] went in
[1:18:16] there is one rapture already past
[1:18:19] that was a rapture of the old testament
[1:18:21] saints yes sir they are somewhere but
[1:18:23] they are not
[1:18:25] in the sixth dimension and they are not
[1:18:28] in a future home
[1:18:32] where are they i don't know i can't name
[1:18:35] a name of a place
[1:18:36] but i'll promise you they're not going
[1:18:38] to be perfected
[1:18:39] until me and you get perfected
[1:18:44] why part of the plan
[1:18:48] don't tell me listen there's a lot of
[1:18:51] things we did in our life
[1:18:54] but i've never had my best friend killed
[1:18:56] so i could take his wife
[1:19:00] i've never killed an egyptian i've never
[1:19:04] went into a
[1:19:05] and had children you see what i'm saying
[1:19:07] that's what the old testament was
[1:19:08] because that was types and shadows
[1:19:12] they had to do that to type all that the
[1:19:14] way down through here but when the blood
[1:19:16] of jesus christ takes away sin and takes
[1:19:17] it out of your life
[1:19:18] he doesn't just cover it he takes it
[1:19:21] away
[1:19:22] and when he takes it away you're not a
[1:19:24] murderer anymore
[1:19:26] you're not a thief anymore
[1:19:30] i'm sorry
[1:19:33] any of that yeah the future home is for
[1:19:37] the bride
[1:19:37] and the bride and jesus christ alone now
[1:19:40] the millennium is different
[1:19:44] that's why there's a difference in part
[1:19:46] of the millennium and in the future home
[1:19:48] now in the millennium they can be a lot
[1:19:50] of things we're there on a honeymoon
[1:19:53] there's a there's a fifth sealed jew
[1:19:55] there's 144 thousand
[1:19:59] don't know about the others you
[1:20:01] understand what i'm saying
[1:20:02] but that's not our home
[1:20:05] our home is coming in revelation 22
[1:20:08] after god destroys every bit of this
[1:20:10] and after god takes all those demons and
[1:20:13] destroys them in the lake of fire
[1:20:15] then we come back
[1:20:19] now watch what is the second
[1:20:23] resurrection
[1:20:26] what is the second resurrection
[1:20:29] it's a resurrection not of them that we
[1:20:32] just talked about
[1:20:33] musicians get ready to come not them
[1:20:36] right there
[1:20:37] they're in another compartment sure
[1:20:40] jesus eradicated their sin
[1:20:42] anything that was against them has been
[1:20:43] covered i'm not covered eradicated
[1:20:46] but they were not bribed because they
[1:20:47] did not receive the new birth while they
[1:20:50] were here on earth
[1:20:51] you and i as the bride of jesus christ
[1:20:54] we receive christ
[1:20:55] into our soul here on earth we have to
[1:20:58] pass away that's okay
[1:21:00] but there's somebody gonna come to a
[1:21:01] place the shout the voice and the
[1:21:03] trumpet just like it was in the old
[1:21:05] testament
[1:21:05] but what are we gonna do i wrote myself
[1:21:08] a little footnote
[1:21:11] what is the sixth dimension that we're
[1:21:12] gonna talk about
[1:21:15] it's the bride that's gone on
[1:21:20] right that is the second resurrection
[1:21:26] because the second resurrection is not
[1:21:28] the jews
[1:21:30] it's not the old testament saints the
[1:21:33] second resurrection
[1:21:34] is the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:21:39] and we which are alive so what is the
[1:21:42] second coming
[1:21:43] the live bride and the bride that's went
[1:21:46] on that's coming back into this
[1:21:48] dimension
[1:21:49] that is your second coming the only
[1:21:51] reason we're going to make it
[1:21:53] is because of three things
[1:21:56] the shout the voice and the trumpet of
[1:22:00] god
[1:22:00] amen that's all they bought listen
[1:22:04] they've had their time in that sixth
[1:22:05] dimension there's there's millions in
[1:22:08] that sixth dimension they've never heard
[1:22:09] of william branham
[1:22:12] millions probably out of 50 million
[1:22:16] 45 of them never heard of him
[1:22:20] but brother brown don't save your soul
[1:22:23] jesus christ
[1:22:24] the everybody knew who he was in that
[1:22:26] dimension
[1:22:27] amen because they accepted him in this
[1:22:29] dimension
[1:22:30] so they're waiting they heard their
[1:22:32] shout voicing trump
[1:22:33] but it was impartiality because they had
[1:22:36] to pass away and go over into this
[1:22:38] part because you know what look we'll
[1:22:39] read it next sunday
[1:22:41] paul has his shout he listen
[1:22:45] paul didn't paul didn't preach brother
[1:22:46] brown's message
[1:22:48] the fullness you understand what i mean
[1:22:50] irenaeus martin because brother brown
[1:22:52] gets into that
[1:22:53] sixth dimension and he looks and he says
[1:22:56] did paul make it
[1:22:59] well now you'd think if they were all in
[1:23:02] the sixth dimension together
[1:23:04] paul's people would come running up to
[1:23:05] brother branham and and irena's people
[1:23:08] would come
[1:23:09] but why did brother rum have to say did
[1:23:11] paul make it
[1:23:13] he didn't see him but what he said he
[1:23:16] said if paul made it
[1:23:18] i mean yeah paul made it now angel said
[1:23:20] yes and i think
[1:23:21] he said well i know i'll make it because
[1:23:23] i preach the same thing paul did
[1:23:24] and remember brother branham's group
[1:23:27] said
[1:23:27] we're resting on that
[1:23:31] they're resting on let me just put it
[1:23:34] this way
[1:23:35] let's stand musicians coming and i'm not
[1:23:38] making anything out of us but i'm
[1:23:39] telling you those who are alive and
[1:23:40] remain
[1:23:41] are special those that have went on have
[1:23:44] completed a journey
[1:23:46] they're done they're finished they don't
[1:23:47] need a seventh seal
[1:23:49] to change their body
[1:23:53] this is the listen the seals didn't open
[1:23:56] in the sixth dimension
[1:23:57] the seals didn't open in heaven the
[1:23:59] seals opened in the first three
[1:24:00] dimensions
[1:24:04] right here so this is where it's going
[1:24:06] to have to culminate
[1:24:07] it's not going to culminate there
[1:24:09] because they're saying we're they said
[1:24:11] we're resting on
[1:24:12] that right what is that
[1:24:16] we are that we're resting on brother
[1:24:19] brown what you said
[1:24:20] now you got to go back we'll read it
[1:24:22] sunday because brother brown wanted to
[1:24:24] stay
[1:24:25] he said no no they said they told him
[1:24:27] you gotta go back
[1:24:29] in other words you're not finished that
[1:24:30] was 1960. he hadn't even revealed the
[1:24:33] sales yet
[1:24:34] he hadn't got into the great mystery
[1:24:36] that he got into in 63 64 and 65.
[1:24:38] they said you got to go back amen your
[1:24:41] your race your race is not finished
[1:24:45] he said do i have to go back to that
[1:24:48] seeing his body laying there at 50
[1:24:49] something 50 years old i think or
[1:24:51] something like that
[1:24:54] angel said you know your work's not done
[1:24:55] yet right you got to go back
[1:24:59] now listen he came back and gave us a
[1:25:02] message
[1:25:03] that's going to get him out of there
[1:25:05] because now he is in there
[1:25:07] and his body's laying up there in
[1:25:08] jeffersonville that don't be little
[1:25:10] nothing
[1:25:12] nobody and those that have gone on but
[1:25:14] there is a group of people
[1:25:15] that will take the shout the voice and
[1:25:17] the trumpet and put them all three
[1:25:19] together
[1:25:19] because remember three is completion
[1:25:22] right
[1:25:25] three is perfection so three is perfect
[1:25:27] so the perfect in threes
[1:25:29] all right you and i have to take the
[1:25:31] shout the voice and the trumpet
[1:25:32] and we have to make it so real that they
[1:25:36] don't say just we're resting on that
[1:25:37] they're saying we're resting on us
[1:25:39] because the dead saints are dependent on
[1:25:41] me and you
[1:25:43] god in me and you to bring them back
[1:25:46] into this dimension but they'll never
[1:25:47] come back into this dimension brother us
[1:25:49] until death has been destroyed by
[1:25:51] somebody
[1:25:53] why would you come from a place of
[1:25:54] perfect peace back into they know what
[1:25:56] this is
[1:25:58] like brother brown said do i have to go
[1:26:00] back to that they say yep you do
[1:26:01] you got to go back we can't but you got
[1:26:04] to go back
[1:26:05] well now he's over there and he can't
[1:26:07] get back here without somebody's help
[1:26:13] his message in a group of people
[1:26:16] to shout the voice and trump of god not
[1:26:19] not to uh
[1:26:21] well never mind i'm gonna cover that
[1:26:24] he's done his work
[1:26:26] trevor read it this afternoon this
[1:26:28] weekend he said
[1:26:31] under her messenger she will be the
[1:26:34] final voice
[1:26:36] what the shout the trump is going to
[1:26:39] create a resurrection
[1:26:41] and that's what we're looking at we're
[1:26:43] looking at a resurrection message we
[1:26:45] just keep walking
[1:26:46] just keep walking because listen folks
[1:26:48] just as
[1:26:49] jesus came to shout voice
[1:26:53] trumpet to bring the old testament under
[1:26:56] his wing and he took them somewhere
[1:26:58] right now remember
[1:27:01] they weren't his body
[1:27:07] right think
[1:27:10] abraham isaac that's not his body
[1:27:14] but he took them somewhere though and
[1:27:17] dropped them off
[1:27:19] and he's waiting in the seventh
[1:27:20] dimension because he can't come back
[1:27:22] here anymore remember he came here one
[1:27:24] time
[1:27:25] with his body in him
[1:27:30] when he come back the second time or he
[1:27:32] coming back on the day of pentecost
[1:27:33] he sent the holy ghost to create his
[1:27:35] body
[1:27:38] amen to create his body therefore now he
[1:27:42] can't come back here
[1:27:44] his body's already here we become
[1:27:47] connected to him
[1:27:49] and we go what meet him in the air
[1:27:52] then we all come back in the millennium
[1:27:53] because see then we're his body
[1:27:56] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[1:27:59] that's what we got to look at
[1:28:01] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[1:28:03] let's sing a song god bless you
[1:28:06] paradise was a wonderful thing but when
[1:28:07] we get in that sixth dimension it's
[1:28:09] gonna be even better
[1:28:10] amen no breaking
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:21] gentile days numbered with horrors and
[1:28:25] cumbers
[1:28:26] eternity soon will unfold

[1:28:36] men's hearts are failing for fear
[1:28:40] one raptor's already finished filled
[1:28:42] with the spirit
[1:28:43] jesus has something to do with it
[1:28:47] this rapture coming up his body's gonna
[1:28:50] have something to do with it
[1:28:53] the fig tree is jerusalem
[1:28:56] see we're watching seeing what happened
[1:28:59] in the world seeing what happened in the
[1:29:00] jews

[1:29:02] but we need to know what's happening
[1:29:03] together she is calling
[1:29:06] man it's all right to watch that signal
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:17] i don't say forget about it but he just
[1:29:19] said watch him he didn't say go over
[1:29:20] there and get him
[1:29:21] involved in it he said watch israel
[1:29:24] watch russia look at all these names
[1:29:27] that the prophet brought in
[1:29:29] that we're watching now watching russia
[1:29:31] doing what they're doing
[1:29:32] watching rome we know it's going to all
[1:29:34] end up
[1:29:35] in catholicism we know that many are
[1:29:38] mistaken
[1:29:39] it's not a mystery how this is going to
[1:29:41] end up
[1:29:43] because it's going to end up with us
[1:29:44] that's being squeezed out the power
[1:29:47] that's shaking and christ going to the
[1:29:49] jews through two prophets

[1:32:21] more confidence
[1:32:23] than it did a month ago a week ago a
[1:32:26] year ago
[1:32:27] it should give us a daily confidence
[1:32:29] that we are walking in the truth
[1:32:31] that we are walking in the light of the
[1:32:33] word that we're walking
[1:32:34] as a scr as the song says where the

[1:33:11] jesus christ
[1:33:12] and that's the only way we can make it
