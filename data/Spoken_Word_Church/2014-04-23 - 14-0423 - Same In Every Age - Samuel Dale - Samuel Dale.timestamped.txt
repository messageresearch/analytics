[9:07] you in Jesus name
[9:09] amen
[9:11] and we're going to read from Hebrews 13
[9:13] you know everybody reads Hebrews 13 8.
[9:17] and uh you know talks about Jesus Christ
[9:21] the same yesterday today and forever
[9:23] and and I've heard that preached
[9:26] um before you have two by people that uh
[9:30] didn't even believe in one true and
[9:32] living God
[9:34] well you know how can he be Hebrews 13
[9:37] 8. same yesterday today and forever
[9:40] if you've got a trinities or thoughts in
[9:43] your mind that's you know how can you do
[9:45] it because it would he wouldn't be
[9:46] correct it wouldn't be but they missed
[9:49] the other parts of it let's go to verse
[9:51] 5.
[9:53] let your conversation which means your
[9:56] manner of life
[9:57] that doesn't mean you're just you're
[9:59] talking but remember you're talking in
[10:02] your manner of Life what you're living
[10:04] your conversation the way you live and
[10:07] your mannerism you know and you're doing
[10:10] all right let your conversation let your
[10:12] manner of Life your your talking your
[10:15] doings
[10:16] be without covetousness
[10:19] and be content with such things as you
[10:22] have
[10:24] for he has said I will never leave thee
[10:27] nor forsake thee so don't worry about
[10:29] the future don't worry about doing just
[10:31] live day by day and just let everything
[10:34] be right right verse 6 so that we may
[10:37] boldly say the Lord is my helper and I
[10:40] will not fear what men shall do unto me
[10:43] see then if if I distrust him and and
[10:46] don't worry about it that don't mean you
[10:48] don't save and put up for a rainy day
[10:50] you should but don't worry about those
[10:53] things see why because your Lord will be
[10:55] your your helper now look what it says
[10:58] remember them which have the rule over
[11:00] you that rule is not a rod of iron rule
[11:05] what is it
[11:07] he explains what it is
[11:10] remember them with how the rule over you
[11:13] who have spoken unto you the word of God
[11:16] see that's what rules over you is the
[11:18] word of God not man and Mankind and his
[11:23] doings it's the word of God so remember
[11:25] that remember his manner of conversation
[11:27] all right remember then which have the
[11:29] rule over you who have spoken unto you
[11:31] the word of God whose Faith father watch
[11:35] now considering the end of their
[11:37] conversation
[11:40] watch the end of what anybody's trying
[11:42] to bring
[11:44] now watch
[11:46] the end of his conversation is supposed
[11:48] to be what
[11:50] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[11:52] and forever
[11:53] but he that curieth about be not cared
[11:57] about with divers and strange doctrines
[12:00] where it is a good thing that the heart
[12:02] be established with Grace not with Meats
[12:05] which have not profited them that have
[12:08] been occupied their end you may be
[12:11] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[12:13] reading of the word
[12:15] as I said last Sunday
[12:19] you know we had a lot of company and a
[12:22] baby dedication and had a good time
[12:23] doing it
[12:25] Brother Anderson and them live through
[12:27] it and they made it and uh but we tried
[12:32] to make a
[12:33] just a message part to where it would
[12:36] relate to everybody and trying to preach
[12:38] about how did he says there in Malachi 3
[12:41] says I am the Lord and I changed not
[12:45] all right now
[12:47] if the Old Testament would end up as I
[12:50] was saying with Malachi being the last
[12:53] book of the Old Testament
[12:56] and he covers it I am the Lord and I
[12:59] change not
[13:01] right all right then when we get over it
[13:03] to say in last week we get over the Book
[13:05] of Revelations which ends the New
[13:06] Testament part
[13:08] and he talks about I am and all that who
[13:11] he is and and all of that
[13:14] then we read Hebrews 13 8 it says Jesus
[13:17] Christ
[13:18] the same yesterday today and forever
[13:22] now remember
[13:26] Jesus was not humanly speaking back in
[13:30] the Old Testament
[13:31] that's understandable
[13:33] all right but that's why Paul is using
[13:36] the word Jesus Christ
[13:38] was back there Christ was in all the
[13:41] scriptures all right and then Jesus
[13:44] being the the name of God so then you
[13:49] can put Jesus Christ and see he could
[13:51] say Jesus Christ is saying yesterday
[13:56] today
[13:58] and no matter how long it would continue
[14:00] in life forever that he's the same any
[14:04] change is not but do we believe that
[14:09] he realized that they took that as we'll
[14:11] get to it in a little bit and they took
[14:14] that scripture
[14:16] at nicaea
[14:20] and they you know
[14:22] brought it down to a trinitarian
[14:24] Doctrine
[14:27] a concept of three gods
[14:30] Our God in three persons Blessed Trinity
[14:33] and how could it be Hebrews 13 8.
[14:36] now if you've got three Gods you've got
[14:38] three persons you've got three persons
[14:40] you got three Gods what whatever you've
[14:41] got
[14:42] so think about it
[14:46] if he's the same yesterday today and
[14:48] forever
[14:50] all right how can you
[14:53] in any point or thought conceive any
[14:56] idea
[14:57] of him being God here
[15:02] but not the same here
[15:05] and not the same here
[15:07] you know yesterday today and forever
[15:11] all right and if he changes where could
[15:13] you depend on it
[15:15] who's going to tell us where the changes
[15:17] are well see that's what man's tried to
[15:19] do they've tried to say well God changed
[15:21] here and God changed her and we are the
[15:23] people that will let you know we're
[15:25] changed that well
[15:28] if he said that he doesn't change
[15:32] and we say he does change
[15:37] now who are we
[15:40] where has mankind got any right or
[15:43] thought to
[15:44] uh change any of the word of God
[15:49] well we got it we got more Revelation
[15:52] now more revelation of what
[15:55] like I told you that man that worked
[15:57] there that time that I was talking to
[15:59] him about water baptism in the name of
[16:00] the Lord Jesus Christ and he said yeah
[16:02] that's right they baptized that way back
[16:04] there
[16:06] I thought well I'm going to run into
[16:08] somebody at least maybe he knows a
[16:09] little bit about the truth I said in
[16:11] other words you believe they they
[16:12] baptized in Bible times in the name of
[16:14] the Lord Jesus Christ he said yeah I
[16:16] said well
[16:17] what about now he said oh he said he
[16:20] said we baptized father son Holy Ghost
[16:22] now because we got a better revelation
[16:26] and said they were trinitarians back
[16:28] there
[16:30] but said we understand now
[16:33] I thought I always understood the Jews
[16:36] to be one true and living God
[16:38] I didn't know that was dark but see
[16:40] that's what somebody had told the man
[16:44] right
[16:46] somebody had told him that and he quoted
[16:49] that
[16:50] some preacher had preached it we
[16:52] baptized father son Holy Ghost now
[16:54] because we've got a deeper Revelation a
[16:57] revelation of what
[16:59] how does a revelation change anything
[17:02] that's written in the word of God
[17:05] and then who do we go for to get that
[17:07] Revelation that was what I was trying to
[17:09] bring out Sunday
[17:11] but I want us to go in a in a thought in
[17:14] it this morning and maybe this afternoon
[17:17] to to think about it
[17:20] and to think about
[17:23] how this statement would be so
[17:25] outstanding
[17:27] as I said then we took verse 6 to talk
[17:30] about it that remember them which are
[17:33] the rule over you who have spoken unto
[17:36] you the word of God
[17:37] now it's only the word of God that has
[17:39] rule over you mankind can't rule
[17:41] see that's what we think well we think
[17:43] the pastor is this we think I'm actually
[17:45] the shepherd
[17:47] that's true but I'm actually a servant
[17:51] and I don't rule Over You by lordship
[17:56] with rule by honor and respect and all
[17:59] but any Pastor is supposed to rule by
[18:03] the word that they bring
[18:05] all right so you consider their
[18:08] conversation you consider it a
[18:09] revelation consider what they're saying
[18:12] and see if it fits in the word of God
[18:14] I heard this morning about a certain
[18:17] brother that and I thought well that's a
[18:18] good point a certain brother that we all
[18:21] would know of in the message that
[18:23] he went and told his church that he
[18:25] wanted to take a couple weeks vacation
[18:27] and he kind of got off on
[18:30] telling how bad brother Branham was and
[18:32] how wrong he was
[18:34] so the church just told him said well
[18:35] why don't you just take off and don't
[18:37] come back
[18:39] I thought
[18:40] hey
[18:42] maybe somebody is waking up you know
[18:46] that you know so you consider what a
[18:49] person is saying
[18:52] you consider what they're teaching you
[18:55] see that away then you can depend upon
[18:57] it and consider it to her that it
[19:00] doesn't change
[19:03] we're in the times I said last week
[19:04] we're in a time of changing everything's
[19:06] changing right and some is good
[19:09] all right but when you talk about the
[19:11] word of God and you talk about a change
[19:13] who tells you where the change is at
[19:17] who is the one that would have the
[19:19] thought of the change and when to change
[19:23] all right see then Here Comes Paul
[19:27] being the one that would be used to
[19:30] write the basics of the New Testament
[19:33] until it's even in the scholarly terms
[19:36] it's called the paulinian Bible because
[19:39] that basically Paul is the writer of the
[19:42] New Testament scriptures you know more
[19:44] than anyone else
[19:46] and in all of his writings but yet he
[19:49] was the one that said Jesus Christ the
[19:52] same yesterday today and forever
[19:54] all right see then we should look at
[19:57] that and consider that he was the one
[20:00] that would have so much Authority until
[20:04] there in
[20:06] Galatians I believe it's 1 8 where he
[20:08] said if anybody come and preach anything
[20:10] contrary to what he'd preached let them
[20:12] be accursed
[20:13] now we quote him as saying what we want
[20:17] him to say
[20:18] you know
[20:20] but do we quote him as the truth
[20:23] was talking to a
[20:26] or what he was or what he is
[20:28] just Barbara's husband one day there and
[20:31] and he uh
[20:33] say oh I believe the Bible
[20:36] that's what you do he said yeah yeah I
[20:39] believe the Bible
[20:40] I thought for a minute I said in other
[20:42] words you believe what you want to
[20:46] you don't believe it's authentic do you
[20:48] well I don't believe in all he is I said
[20:51] well in other words you believe it's
[20:52] part authentic
[20:54] and you're the one to tell me what the
[20:55] authentic party is
[20:57] you know
[20:58] he kind of laughed at me because we get
[21:00] along real good but
[21:03] my point was where does it change
[21:08] and if it does change
[21:11] who knows the change
[21:13] who is the one that does the right to to
[21:16] change it
[21:17] you know I've always had trouble with
[21:20] the evolution Theory
[21:23] of how that do you you you should start
[21:26] off from a pollywog to a frog well who
[21:29] started to pollywog but
[21:31] you know I still have trouble even if
[21:34] the story was right
[21:36] that if we evolve down and come down to
[21:39] a monkey I agree we act like them but we
[21:41] still haven't turned back towards them
[21:43] you know and uh but see we're changing
[21:47] but God can't change
[21:50] you mean a God that would create mankind
[21:53] a God that would would create the world
[21:56] that he would know ever Nat that would
[21:58] ever bat its eyes or or whatever it
[22:00] would do be an omniscient
[22:03] and he'd know before the world all the
[22:05] things and if he doesn't then he's not
[22:07] God
[22:09] and see you take that Trinity concept
[22:11] and he said well the father knows so
[22:13] much the son knows so much and and the
[22:16] Holy Ghost knows so much and see you get
[22:18] it all confused and and understanding
[22:21] but
[22:22] think about it
[22:24] if he's the same yesterday today and
[22:27] forever
[22:28] all you got to do is find what he said
[22:34] 50 years ago they'd pull your toenails
[22:36] out and bleed your unit of blood when
[22:39] you're sick
[22:40] you think the doctors would agree to
[22:41] that today now there were some things
[22:44] that that would work
[22:47] right
[22:49] I mean because your your body
[22:51] as the redoing of the blood would bring
[22:54] forth and this nurse is sitting here
[22:56] that would tell you that would work in
[22:58] some cases but you got a guy with
[23:00] pneumonia and he's running 102 or three
[23:03] temperature and he's dying and then
[23:05] you're going to bleed him
[23:06] but we wouldn't agree with that today
[23:10] right
[23:11] because that would be contrary the we
[23:15] would agree today that here's people
[23:16] that are down so low we need to give
[23:18] them some blood
[23:21] me
[23:23] but yet see God is not that away
[23:27] the god I talk about the God I believe
[23:29] in
[23:32] you can follow him all the way through
[23:33] the Bible
[23:34] all the way through Jesus Christ the
[23:37] flesh coming on down and all the way
[23:39] through the Holy Ghost in our time and
[23:41] believing the word
[23:43] see then you don't have to worry about
[23:44] it
[23:45] you can make it to be where you can
[23:47] really understand him
[23:49] and that's a marvelous thing
[23:53] because as I said now if he changes
[23:56] who's got the right to tell you where
[23:58] it's at and who are we going to depend
[24:00] on what are we going to do
[24:02] but see I'm going to stay with the word
[24:04] to realize he can't change
[24:06] then if he can't change then I better
[24:09] watch and not try to change any of it
[24:12] myself
[24:13] I better follow that idea all right but
[24:16] I want to get a point to you today
[24:19] of an unchanging God
[24:23] and get it to you in a way
[24:25] to worth it you would would help us to
[24:29] understand the day and the hour that
[24:31] we're living
[24:32] now for some 45 years I've been
[24:36] preaching
[24:37] and when I started out preaching the
[24:40] first sermon I preached 1969 was that
[24:44] the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the
[24:46] son of man
[24:49] on Earth reading it from the prophet
[24:52] bringing it from the message back there
[24:55] and showing that
[24:57] she would be the fullness of the godhead
[24:59] bodily that she would be the son of man
[25:04] but now we see everybody then say Oh no
[25:06] brother branham's the son of man no we
[25:08] don't agree with that brother random
[25:10] wasn't this other man the Lord Jesus
[25:12] Christ is the son of man
[25:14] but Iran was a prophet that God used
[25:16] which would be called a son of man
[25:19] see in the Old Testament it would say
[25:21] son of man prophesied
[25:23] and and God would speak through them
[25:26] you know and those prophets would say
[25:28] thus saith the Lord
[25:30] because it was God speaking through them
[25:32] to the people all right that's wonderful
[25:35] but it never made any of them almighty
[25:38] God
[25:39] none of those prophets would ever accept
[25:41] worship
[25:43] and even Jesus when he was on Earth at
[25:46] times they would try to worship Him and
[25:49] he'd accept it
[25:50] you watch the scripture read Matthew
[25:52] Mark Luke and John but then at other
[25:54] times when they would try to worship Him
[25:55] each time he said don't worship me
[25:58] because he could he knew what they were
[26:01] worshiping
[26:02] amen he knew they were worshiping the
[26:04] wrong thing
[26:06] even though they stood to say unless you
[26:08] believe that I am he you'll die in your
[26:11] sins
[26:13] but yet he wasn't putting himself
[26:16] he would say I and my father are one
[26:20] or he wasn't making himself greater in
[26:23] any form
[26:24] he was just trying to show who he was
[26:27] and what was going on
[26:29] but you think about it
[26:31] if he's the same yesterday today and
[26:34] forever
[26:36] then
[26:38] he would be the same in the law
[26:42] right
[26:44] the Old Testament
[26:46] he would be the same in flesh upon the
[26:48] Earth
[26:49] and being that he couldn't be something
[26:51] contrary to those Old Testament
[26:54] scriptures
[26:56] he said I come to do
[26:59] my father's will
[27:01] not his own
[27:03] all right
[27:04] see because that way he was not a
[27:07] taking any credit
[27:11] he said I do what the father shows me
[27:15] all right
[27:16] he said well that that means there's two
[27:18] of them well where's the other one out
[27:20] there if that's two of them
[27:24] so you take one scripture where he says
[27:26] unless you believe that I am he you'll
[27:27] die in your sins
[27:29] and then you say and Jesus said have I
[27:32] been so long with you Philip you didn't
[27:33] know me so if you've seen me you've seen
[27:35] the father
[27:36] all right but then just because he
[27:38] turned around and talk about a father
[27:40] who do you talk about
[27:43] who do you talk about
[27:47] I mean I'm sorry that's just the way I
[27:49] do things I'm just blunt playing I know
[27:52] but who do you pray to
[27:55] amen do you pray to the one inside of
[27:58] you
[28:01] or do you pray to the god of Heaven
[28:05] when it would have to be the same person
[28:09] but yeah we just don't turn around
[28:11] well I'm praying well I hadn't heard
[28:14] your words I'm talking to one inside of
[28:16] me
[28:18] yeah no
[28:20] see we recognize a father
[28:23] we recognize the Holy Spirit
[28:25] we recognize all of those the workings
[28:28] of the Lord because
[28:30] we have learned the truth of what it is
[28:32] God can change his form and appear in
[28:36] many different ways
[28:38] right but yet it's the same God
[28:43] all right
[28:44] see it was Christ back there
[28:47] that was the writing of the word
[28:50] all right
[28:52] come on it was Christ the writer one
[28:54] who's writing the word but yet as we
[28:56] were bringing out last week James says
[28:59] that Jesus Christ created all things
[29:04] no no no the father created well
[29:07] see where are you at in the word
[29:10] right you got somebody's concept
[29:13] instead of studying the Bible for
[29:15] yourself
[29:17] all right
[29:18] see then you don't believe in to be
[29:20] Hebrews 13 8.
[29:24] you believe in to be changing
[29:26] all right now come on down to where
[29:29] we're at
[29:31] we're not talking about organized
[29:33] religion that's out there
[29:35] we're talking about where Lula's at
[29:37] that all right
[29:39] I've tried for 45 years to preach
[29:43] one true and living God
[29:46] I tried to preach that used to sign
[29:48] yesterday today and forever
[29:50] and have held that thought all the way
[29:52] through
[29:54] no matter what all of these doctrines
[29:56] has come out
[29:59] well brother there you've always been
[30:00] right
[30:03] let's just put it plain
[30:06] who's been able to come tell me I was
[30:08] wrong
[30:10] you don't like that kind of talking do
[30:12] you
[30:13] but is it the truth
[30:17] I'm going to swallow your pride
[30:21] I don't have any
[30:22] because I give him the honor and glory
[30:24] for it all
[30:29] but after all of the doctrines and ideas
[30:31] of the message then they just don't come
[30:33] in here
[30:35] right
[30:37] why because they know we take a stand
[30:40] and like I said while ago praise God for
[30:42] that church if I get off of this message
[30:44] and start declaring how wrong the Bible
[30:47] is and how wrong this is and how wrong
[30:49] that you need to get rid of me
[30:52] right
[30:54] you need to get that out of there
[30:56] because there's got to be something
[30:57] wrong with it
[31:00] but when you can stand and say for 45
[31:02] years
[31:03] these doctrines has not been able to
[31:06] impregnate us to the point and I've
[31:08] studied them all
[31:10] because I'm concerned about it
[31:13] and if nothing else I've studied it
[31:15] where I could talk to you about it and
[31:16] tell you where it was wrong at
[31:18] right because that was my job
[31:20] if I'm to rule over you
[31:23] and it's by the word that I bring
[31:26] then
[31:27] I need to know
[31:30] right all right and I don't come up here
[31:32] and say so and so say unless I heard
[31:34] that
[31:36] I've been always been killed at point
[31:38] you know that I've heard the people
[31:40] myself or whatever
[31:42] but yet we don't want people we don't
[31:45] want a preacher who can stand and say
[31:48] for 45 years I preach the same thing
[31:52] we'd rather have somebody that's been in
[31:54] this Doctrine and in that Doctrine and
[31:56] gone into that Doctrine and followed
[31:58] after this and run after all the chimney
[32:01] tales of the message and
[32:03] been in all the dates and the times and
[32:05] the seasons and the predictions and
[32:09] we'd rather have somebody doing that
[32:13] now somebody that can say for 45 years
[32:18] I've preached one time
[32:20] you know what that is to try to get you
[32:24] and I to a place
[32:27] that they can be a change of these
[32:29] bodies
[32:33] now where is it going to come from
[32:36] well the bus is going to pull up one of
[32:37] these days we're going to crawl on get
[32:38] out of here
[32:41] well I hope the bus hurry UPS because if
[32:44] not we're going to be in the nursing
[32:45] home
[32:48] or in the funeral home
[32:51] yeah well
[32:54] would you see church people don't want
[32:56] somebody that can stand and say show me
[32:59] where I'm wrong
[33:03] or if you get that challenge out on the
[33:05] internet show me where I'm wrong
[33:08] well you don't listen no I ain't gonna
[33:10] listen to silly I ain't got time to
[33:11] listen to silly stuff
[33:15] but you come and show me where that I'm
[33:17] off the message
[33:20] but see we don't want that because
[33:22] that's sarcasm
[33:25] well
[33:27] you know
[33:28] I mean my wife you know would be really
[33:30] I don't think she would would beat me
[33:34] over the head with a frying pan but
[33:37] if I come in the kitchen and started
[33:39] telling her how to cook
[33:44] she would let me know real quick that
[33:46] she's been at it ever since she's 12
[33:48] years old
[33:50] because most of you know it
[33:52] 16 years old
[33:54] or about 15. she cooked me a meal
[33:58] invited me down and we were eating and I
[34:00] told her in front of her mother
[34:03] I said Miss cash you cook this supper
[34:05] because she can't cook it
[34:07] she said I'll let you know I didn't cook
[34:09] it
[34:11] well wouldn't it be something me coming
[34:12] there now what you need to do is you
[34:14] need to do this
[34:16] you need to do that you need to cook it
[34:18] this way how would you sisters like that
[34:24] right
[34:27] I mean you'd be tickled to death
[34:28] wouldn't you for your husband to come in
[34:30] and tell you
[34:32] no no no no no no no don't get off of it
[34:37] you'd say I've been at this all of my
[34:39] life
[34:40] and I've learned how to cook
[34:44] well
[34:45] I've been trying to preach one true and
[34:47] living God for 45 years and trying to
[34:49] get a church to realize who they are
[34:53] well there's anything wrong with me
[34:54] telling you that's what I've been
[34:58] huh
[34:59] any problems no
[35:01] but you see we don't get into the
[35:05] message
[35:06] and I told my wife I said and I know
[35:08] it'll take two services today at least
[35:10] or three or more on what I'm trying to
[35:12] get you to see but I want you to see one
[35:14] thing
[35:15] I've never de-christianized anybody
[35:20] I've never said anybody left the word
[35:22] when they left Lula
[35:26] you know
[35:28] because that's their business
[35:31] but I'm one that has never been one to
[35:34] try to run after people that has left
[35:38] because I didn't run after you to get
[35:40] you here
[35:44] right
[35:45] you came with your own accord
[35:49] well it's not my duty because somebody
[35:51] don't show up for a few services
[35:53] for me to go run them down
[35:55] to see what's wrong
[35:58] according to the Bible it says call for
[36:00] the elders if you're sick it didn't save
[36:03] the elders call you find out if you're
[36:04] sick I'm sorry I'm just not a pastor I
[36:08] guess
[36:10] he wants your lovey-dovey
[36:13] condo priest
[36:16] to call you and pet you
[36:19] well I'm sorry
[36:21] you know
[36:23] I'm just
[36:24] I'm not made that away
[36:27] I didn't get you in and I'm not going to
[36:29] beg you to come back
[36:33] but now if somebody leaves and they want
[36:35] to come and explain to me why they're
[36:37] leaving
[36:39] one brother that left you know back in
[36:41] quite a while ago he he told me he said
[36:43] I'll never do nothing to hinder in your
[36:45] church in any way
[36:47] do we go home in our life because he got
[36:49] home after a while you know what he said
[36:52] he said if anybody in Lulu wants to know
[36:54] why I left Lula let him call me and I'll
[36:57] tell them you know what one of these
[36:58] days I get them time I'm going to call
[36:59] him and ask him why he left
[37:03] you know go that's what he said
[37:07] he said if they want to know let them
[37:09] call me well I want to know
[37:13] because the day that I he left I said
[37:16] show me where I'm out the word
[37:20] well
[37:22] we'll go down to some quotes after a
[37:24] while or this afternoon you know that
[37:26] brother Brown said if your pastor is not
[37:28] preaching Hebrews 13 8
[37:30] the same
[37:32] he said get away from me
[37:38] well now how can I be setting dates one
[37:40] week I'm preaching false doctrine of
[37:42] next week and running all over the
[37:44] country and doing all kinds of things
[37:47] and then says Hebrews 13 8.
[37:51] but you see church we don't look at
[37:53] things in the correct order and I pray
[37:55] that God will give me the understanding
[37:57] to express to you what I've tried to do
[38:03] because I've never de-christianized
[38:05] anybody for not believing what I believe
[38:08] you know my favorite saying is I don't
[38:11] make my wife believe what I believe
[38:13] I don't try to do that I don't try to
[38:16] get my kids to believe what I believe I
[38:18] don't get the grandkids to believe what
[38:20] I believe the great grandkids
[38:22] they're going to have their own
[38:23] salvation
[38:25] I try to preach when I believe
[38:28] you know
[38:31] I try to do that
[38:33] and I'm glad to talk to them about why
[38:35] did I believe it you know but I'm not
[38:38] trying to convince nobody because I
[38:40] can't do it
[38:44] I can't make you see the truth
[38:49] God knocked Paul down on the road to
[38:52] Damascus
[38:54] right it wasn't Peter or some of them
[38:56] out there knocking him off the horse
[38:58] getting him to listen
[39:00] God knocked him down
[39:04] see we need a revelation more than
[39:06] anything right
[39:08] when Revelation has to come from God's
[39:10] word
[39:13] well like I said
[39:15] we've been teaching stature perfect man
[39:17] Brother Moore was teaching it there in
[39:19] 1972 into 71 coming up
[39:23] and I asked a simple question
[39:26] I said how do we get these virtues
[39:31] about 1980 the Lord revealed to me how
[39:33] these virtues would come into being it
[39:36] would be through the opening of the word
[39:41] only through the opening of the word
[39:44] can these things come into being
[39:46] right God is not going to just open up
[39:49] our heads sister Gail and just pour
[39:51] things in
[39:53] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[39:56] the word of God well then how can we
[39:59] hear without a preacher and how can he
[40:00] be preached unless what he'd be sinned
[40:06] well
[40:08] but you see I've tried to get you to
[40:10] understand and not de-christianize
[40:12] people because they don't believe what
[40:13] we believe
[40:15] you know why because one day you didn't
[40:16] believe what we believe
[40:18] you know what one day I didn't believe
[40:20] what we believe
[40:22] all right all right and we call it
[40:25] growth development brother Claude
[40:26] doesn't like progressive revelation
[40:28] because he said Progressive is not a
[40:31] good word finally the other day he'll
[40:33] hear that and he'll lie he admitted he
[40:35] said you got a right to say what you're
[40:36] saying about progressives the way you
[40:38] explain it you know because I believe
[40:43] that as little
[40:46] Sarah
[40:48] you know wouldn't it be something if the
[40:50] baby's born
[40:52] and then it is
[40:54] okay we got the baby put it in the
[40:56] bedroom
[40:57] we'll go back and see it in a couple of
[40:59] years from now
[41:02] you say that's silly
[41:04] is that the way we think in Christianity
[41:06] well you just get people saved
[41:08] well that's good that's wonderful
[41:11] but you know what you got to feed the
[41:13] baby you got to change his diaper you
[41:15] got to take it to the doctor you got to
[41:17] do all kind of things
[41:19] why cause you're raising the baby
[41:22] that's the way I look at Christianity
[41:27] I look at Christianity as a constant
[41:30] growth development
[41:35] because in the Old Testament when they
[41:38] had the man of falling
[41:40] which is an example of the word of God
[41:42] right
[41:43] when the Manna would fall
[41:45] they would try to hold some of that over
[41:47] till the next day
[41:49] and it was rotten on them
[41:51] they had to go out each day and gather
[41:54] that manna
[41:56] and fix it and eat it God is the type of
[41:58] the word of God
[42:00] that's why Jesus said I'm the bread that
[42:03] came down in the wilderness he wasn't no
[42:05] body back there
[42:07] it was the word that he was right all
[42:10] right see and that's why we burned the
[42:12] communion bread
[42:15] once it's dedicated and all we we burn
[42:17] it
[42:18] why because we're not trying to hold
[42:20] over
[42:22] all of those are examples and
[42:25] understanding
[42:28] but see I believe in in
[42:31] partial realization
[42:34] to perfect realization
[42:38] I believe that
[42:39] as a baby eats and grows
[42:42] you don't really don't think little
[42:43] Cyrus okay yesterday we was and we was
[42:47] drinking some
[42:49] um
[42:50] Jews that she'd give us and
[42:53] I looked over at Little Saver and I said
[42:55] boy would be good just in your old
[42:57] timers would understand but your new
[42:58] model stuff don't
[43:00] that you just say stick your finger in
[43:02] there and stick it in the baby's mouth
[43:03] oh that's unclean well you know we lived
[43:10] how many of you
[43:14] how many of you with your kids
[43:16] chewed their food for them a little bit
[43:19] before you gave it to him
[43:21] oh that's unsanitary we lived
[43:25] right
[43:28] you know
[43:30] but you see Church you don't give a
[43:33] stake we talk about that to a little
[43:35] baby
[43:36] you wait until it grows up when God does
[43:39] that in his word
[43:41] he doesn't expect us to know everything
[43:45] but he expects us after a while to begin
[43:47] to know a little bit
[43:48] I mean 45 years that we've been studying
[43:51] the word of God and some longer than
[43:53] that and especially internet people
[43:54] listening
[43:59] we ought to know a little bit about it
[44:02] you know
[44:04] see studying the Bible all of her life
[44:06] we ought to at least be coming somewhere
[44:08] do we get a a little concept of what
[44:10] it's talking about
[44:15] but you see church I've always tried to
[44:16] get you to see that there's people at
[44:19] different levels
[44:23] there's people at different levels in
[44:24] God everybody's not responsible
[44:27] everybody here today is not responsible
[44:29] for the same level of what we talk about
[44:33] you're responsible for your part
[44:36] and your part may be a greater level
[44:38] than mine
[44:40] I don't have no problem with that
[44:43] but you're responsible for your part
[44:46] I'm responsible for my part
[44:50] we're all responsible for growth
[44:52] development
[44:55] will growth development comes by eating
[44:58] right
[45:00] babies grow by eating
[45:04] all right
[45:06] and see in doing that we
[45:10] we don't consider things
[45:13] Peter said one day of Paul he said Paul
[45:16] says things hard to be understood
[45:20] and watch what he said he said in some
[45:23] wrestle you know in other words wrestle
[45:26] what he's what he's teaching to their
[45:29] own destruction he said
[45:32] why who's Paul think he is
[45:37] you may not got to listen to Paul
[45:42] well
[45:46] he said
[45:49] if you teach anything contrary to what
[45:51] I'm teaching he needs to let you be
[45:52] accursed
[45:53] now that was what he had to say about it
[45:56] well see we want Paul for what we won't
[45:58] hear
[46:00] right but we don't want the correction
[46:02] you know the Corinthians
[46:06] we don't want that we want the Bible for
[46:08] what we want
[46:12] as a beautiful picture
[46:17] oh yeah I believe that
[46:19] but now I don't believe what Paul's
[46:21] saying over here well now where does
[46:22] that right come from
[46:27] or do you understand what I'm getting at
[46:28] and then we'll get on to the point
[46:31] see because I believe that you
[46:35] you've got a lot of people in the world
[46:37] seven billion as they can record right
[46:39] now somewhere close to me even more
[46:43] you know out of that there's a lot of
[46:45] what we call Christian people
[46:49] and that's where people thinks that
[46:50] we're against
[46:51] the Baptist the Methodist the
[46:53] Presbyterian the Pentecostals the
[46:55] Catholics and the I'm not against
[46:57] anybody
[47:00] no
[47:04] well because they're people
[47:07] you know what
[47:09] you know whether we like it or not we
[47:11] all come off the same tree
[47:13] you know
[47:15] might be a lot of different branches but
[47:17] we're still off the same tree and no
[47:20] matter where black white yellow green
[47:21] brown or whatever it is
[47:24] we can all give each other a blood
[47:25] transfusion
[47:27] so we do have enough connections to be
[47:29] able to that I don't don't try to take
[47:32] blood from a dog
[47:34] it'll kill you
[47:36] you know because it's the wrong family
[47:38] all right
[47:40] see we can give each other blood
[47:41] transfusion
[47:44] because we're off of One Tree
[47:47] and see God then what I love about him
[47:52] when I was listening one day and I heard
[47:54] a prophet say because it always bothered
[47:56] me
[47:58] when I was back there in the Baptist I
[47:59] used to think about it we were
[48:01] missionary minded and to a degree and
[48:03] tried to help
[48:04] and uh
[48:06] you know I think about people in a
[48:08] foreign country or something that had
[48:10] never heard about Jesus Christ
[48:13] and I thought oh God what'll happen to
[48:15] that person
[48:18] well then one side would
[48:21] pull us up one preacher would be through
[48:23] and he said y'all are doing a good job
[48:25] giving you money and so y'all can't go
[48:29] so you know you're sending somebody else
[48:31] well that'd make you feel good you know
[48:35] then the other guy come in the next time
[48:37] and he'd say
[48:40] you need to be going
[48:43] you need to be a missionary
[48:45] you need to go and preach the gospel
[48:48] well that'd make you feel bad right
[48:51] you don't go with your human
[48:55] see both of them would be telling truth
[49:02] when I was listening one day and I heard
[49:03] the prophet he said
[49:06] that there'll be a heathen in the
[49:08] millennium
[49:12] and he said they'll be judged according
[49:14] to how they lived
[49:17] according to their own tribal laws and
[49:21] whatever the words you would use for
[49:23] that
[49:24] you know but their own tribal laws and
[49:27] things they'd be judged by
[49:30] he said here we are in America he said
[49:32] it'd be hard to go across the country in
[49:35] the choirs of America to find a half a
[49:38] dozen virgin women
[49:42] but he said you go to Africa the darkest
[49:44] of all continents where they don't even
[49:46] know right or left hand or don't even
[49:48] and don't even have clothes on there he
[49:50] said
[49:51] and they have to have a urgency test
[49:53] before they can marry
[49:58] and said if they don't pass the test
[50:01] they kill them
[50:02] he said what would happen in America
[50:06] he said there wouldn't be enough funeral
[50:08] homes
[50:09] to take care of all the dead
[50:14] but yet we call them heathen
[50:18] they don't know about Jesus
[50:21] they're heathen
[50:24] we yet they live a whole lot better life
[50:28] you say well it's only for fear
[50:31] okay praise the Lord
[50:33] you know I minded my mom one thing
[50:35] called I loved her but another thing I
[50:37] feared her
[50:40] amen
[50:42] I told you about it I told you about her
[50:45] whipping my brother with a metal ring
[50:47] off of a wooden barrel and ringing about
[50:49] that wide she stretch it out and with my
[50:51] brother when he was 18 years old
[50:54] because he said he's going to leave home
[50:56] she said go on
[50:58] but don't leave mats go in the house and
[51:01] sit down do you cool off then you can
[51:02] leave
[51:03] because you knew if he got in the house
[51:04] he wouldn't do it
[51:05] he said I'm leaving she just got that
[51:07] thing I can see her now stretched it out
[51:09] she wrapped him about twice of that
[51:11] thing
[51:11] he says if you'll leave me alone I'll go
[51:13] back in the house
[51:16] all right
[51:17] it might be fear of a tribe to keep it
[51:20] but it should be Christian fear
[51:23] right
[51:24] we're going to claim to be Christians
[51:26] there would be a Christian fear not
[51:28] afraid of being lost not afraid of a God
[51:31] that would would whip us or whatever
[51:34] don't teach your kids about a bad God
[51:38] come on be minor woman enough to give
[51:41] him a whooping
[51:42] oh but we can't do that now
[51:46] before I say we've fouled up
[51:50] you tell them kids about Jesus Christ
[51:53] but don't tell him he hates them
[51:57] don't even tell them God don't like for
[51:59] you to do that give him a weapon and
[52:02] tell them to stop it
[52:05] and I can't stand it you get in the
[52:08] store when there's a kid more they just
[52:09] fall on the floor start kicking and
[52:11] slobbering all over the place and crying
[52:17] I know what would have happened if I'd
[52:18] have done that
[52:20] and I know what happened when one of
[52:23] them done that
[52:26] I didn't have to whip them Nanny took
[52:29] care of him she believed in that if you
[52:32] you're going to spoil the child he's
[52:34] part of the rod
[52:37] but listen Church
[52:39] what am I talking about
[52:42] oh God
[52:43] that judges Everybody by their heart not
[52:46] by some
[52:48] Book of Rules even the Bible
[52:51] oh they're going to be judged by that
[52:52] Bible we're standing one day at my
[52:54] mother-in-law's house and a guy next
[52:56] door is cutting his grass on Sunday
[52:59] this lady standing there and said he's
[53:01] going to die and go to hell for that
[53:03] I thought man in the world how in the
[53:05] world could I ever talk to her about
[53:07] I mean God's gonna die and go to hell
[53:10] because he's cutting his grass on Sunday
[53:15] and we're going to get down in a little
[53:17] bit
[53:17] or maybe this afternoon
[53:19] we brought around talked about Eve
[53:23] and how that Eve's original sin was what
[53:28] oh now you can call it everything you
[53:29] want to but what was the original sin he
[53:32] said she didn't believe Hebrews 13 8.
[53:39] tonight wasn't written back dire
[53:42] God was back there
[53:45] and she didn't believe him to be the
[53:46] same to keep his words when he said the
[53:48] day you eat thereof that day you'll die
[53:51] she didn't believe it
[53:53] what is the biggest sin there is in the
[53:55] world that you could think of or to have
[53:57] you write it down on a piece of paper
[53:59] what is the biggest sin you could think
[54:01] of
[54:05] that guy up there that took a gun and
[54:07] killed how many kids was it in that
[54:09] school
[54:13] how many would write that down
[54:15] or Adolf Hitler that sent a world of war
[54:17] and millions was killed
[54:20] are here in the United States of a civil
[54:23] war that claimed more Americans than any
[54:25] War has ever done because of Americans
[54:27] on both sides
[54:29] blowing their legs off in their arms and
[54:31] their things
[54:32] and no medicine to do
[54:35] what would be your thought of the
[54:37] biggest sin could ever be
[54:41] a woman that would have bought a baby
[54:45] a person that would rob a bank or kill
[54:46] somebody
[54:51] we know all those things are bad
[54:54] that person they were talking about this
[54:56] morning to rape that 80 year old woman
[54:57] my Lord when there's so many women out
[55:00] there that's begging for a man
[55:06] what kind of what would be the greatest
[55:08] sin you could think of
[55:14] for Eve to disbelieve Hebrews 13 8.
[55:20] sin is unbelief
[55:23] drank and gambling smoking killing
[55:25] people blowing the world apart oh that's
[55:27] just attributes
[55:30] it's caused by the original sin
[55:39] when we get down to that then
[55:41] we always talk about what there is no
[55:43] little sin and it's no big sin right
[55:46] oh see any sin
[55:49] and I got just a little bit unbelief but
[55:50] these other people got plenty more well
[55:52] that makes you worse than they are
[55:55] because you know you only you got just a
[55:57] little bit
[55:58] you just trapped your own self see by
[56:00] saying I know I got a little bit of sin
[56:02] but these other people's got a whole lot
[56:03] more well you're not going to heaven
[56:05] whether or not or that
[56:07] man asked us the other day we were
[56:09] sitting up there eating with digging
[56:11] sister Gail and the guy came by and he
[56:12] said
[56:13] you know what are you going to
[56:15] how are you going to get to heaven
[56:17] brother dick thought he said how you
[56:19] gonna get to hell he said I said you got
[56:22] to be born again
[56:25] well I guess he'd never heard that
[56:26] because you know probably a Baptist I'm
[56:28] not saying nothing he would probably
[56:30] mean and saved that was his word you
[56:32] know
[56:33] be saved he probably never heard the
[56:35] word born again so remember it probably
[56:37] didn't think about
[56:39] enjoy just passed it kind of you know
[56:41] like
[56:43] I maybe don't understand what you're
[56:45] talking about
[56:46] wonderful guy
[56:50] nice guy
[56:52] right
[56:55] but you see I believe
[56:57] the only way to heaven is Jesus Christ
[57:01] you know what then that heathen
[57:04] that has never heard
[57:07] of Jesus Christ
[57:11] but yet bringing it down the way God
[57:14] looks at it
[57:15] that he gave him laws and rituals to
[57:19] follow
[57:21] and as he got that
[57:25] he will be judged by that
[57:28] so that is the word of God just as much
[57:31] as it is the King James version that we
[57:33] talk about of the Bible
[57:38] they won't be judged by whether Jesus
[57:40] Christ come into their life to save them
[57:43] but they'll be judged by their own
[57:45] actions and reactions
[57:48] what a wonderful God
[57:51] he doesn't demand
[57:59] all right but now when we move up into
[58:01] levels then demands come
[58:08] we preached it that and it's true that
[58:11] there is no thing about salvation is of
[58:13] the lord we believe that Jonah 2 and 9
[58:16] it's wonderful
[58:20] and if you can't do nothing to get saved
[58:22] amen we believe that
[58:24] it's the grace of Jesus Christ but once
[58:26] you get born again
[58:32] and you claim Jesus Christ is living in
[58:34] you thank you
[58:36] now you've got some conditions
[58:40] I don't believe in Salvation with a
[58:41] condition right
[58:43] and I don't believe if you're truly born
[58:46] again you can never be lost
[58:48] but that's not the Baptist concept
[58:52] the urge is once saved always saved
[58:55] let me be true if it's truly saved
[59:00] if you truly have the baptism of the
[59:02] Holy Ghost in your birth
[59:05] then you can't be lost
[59:07] right
[59:09] but it didn't don't put us just well I
[59:12] know that man I know I know he's been a
[59:14] bad guy all his life but he went to
[59:16] church when he was a kid
[59:18] see we want to put him in heaven because
[59:19] of some reason nobody's putting hell
[59:21] anymore have you heard a preacher lately
[59:23] get up and preach at that first land in
[59:25] front of them's gone to hell
[59:31] I always got some little reason
[59:34] well they painted the church
[59:36] they played the parking lot
[59:39] they gave two dollars an offering place
[59:42] oh that's well and good
[59:46] he said brother what are you talking
[59:47] about
[59:51] say I believe in a just honest true God
[59:56] that will judge everybody according to
[59:58] what you've heard
[1:00:02] that way he won't judge everybody
[1:00:06] that hasn't heard the truth
[1:00:09] by Earth Our Truth
[1:00:11] he'll judge him by what truth they have
[1:00:18] now we're not talking about being the
[1:00:20] bride of Christ because we've been
[1:00:21] through that we know the story when
[1:00:25] we're talking about a born-again
[1:00:27] Believer as being a person who has
[1:00:29] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:30] like they did on death Pentecost
[1:00:32] or
[1:00:34] we believe in that
[1:00:36] and we believe that is to be the bride
[1:00:37] of Christ
[1:00:39] but what about the foolish virgins and
[1:00:41] the different people who have never
[1:00:43] heard
[1:00:44] what are you going to do about the Old
[1:00:46] Testament people
[1:00:48] that never heard about Jesus Christ
[1:00:54] come on
[1:00:58] but they witnessed the Christ
[1:01:02] as the pillar of fire the one who led
[1:01:04] the children of Israel
[1:01:06] they witnessed Christ as he was there in
[1:01:08] doing all of those things and we'll be
[1:01:10] judged according to that
[1:01:16] so get what I'm saying where I can back
[1:01:18] up and do it I believe a born-again
[1:01:20] experience puts you a place to where
[1:01:22] you're in the body of Christ and that's
[1:01:24] what Jesus was talking about it's when
[1:01:25] he said unless you be born again
[1:01:27] you cannot see you cannot understand the
[1:01:30] kingdom
[1:01:31] speaking to the most religious person in
[1:01:34] the world Amen the most honorable
[1:01:36] respectable
[1:01:38] Nicodemus
[1:01:43] the teacher the Bible called him
[1:01:47] but yet he couldn't understand when
[1:01:48] Jesus would speak of the new birth
[1:01:52] he said well all he had to do was
[1:01:53] believe that's good old Baptist thoughts
[1:01:55] and all the Nicodemus had to do is
[1:01:57] believe
[1:01:58] what do you mean
[1:01:59] he put his life on the line for his job
[1:02:01] everything was on the line if they found
[1:02:04] him there he would have been high priest
[1:02:06] no longer everybody was right
[1:02:08] teacher
[1:02:11] he put everything on the line to get to
[1:02:13] talk to Jesus
[1:02:17] see we look at the world and we think
[1:02:19] about well what about it well I look at
[1:02:21] it too and I ask you what about the
[1:02:23] world
[1:02:24] what is all this world going to be
[1:02:25] judged by
[1:02:32] it's got to be judged by something
[1:02:33] called as a human being
[1:02:39] so then the judgment is going to be up
[1:02:41] on an individual basis
[1:02:46] that we be judged according to what
[1:02:48] we've heard and what we walk in
[1:02:55] he said well brother Dale what do you
[1:02:57] think I believe that you
[1:02:59] must be born again
[1:03:02] to do that you must be justified by
[1:03:05] Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:08] and asking him to forgive your sins
[1:03:11] and you know what when he does forgive
[1:03:13] you you'll never answer for them
[1:03:17] they're gone
[1:03:20] those won't meet your judgment you may
[1:03:22] for a lot more but that won't because
[1:03:24] that's gone because he's honest and are
[1:03:27] just God
[1:03:28] when you say father forgive me he says
[1:03:31] okay I forgive you
[1:03:36] I believe in sanctification
[1:03:40] which is a deeper work or talk which is
[1:03:43] really not a word because there's no
[1:03:44] work of the Salvation of God
[1:03:47] it's a deeper deeper different talk
[1:03:51] and that sanctification sets you aside
[1:03:54] cleanses you
[1:03:56] corrects your life in doing
[1:04:01] but I wish you would think about it a
[1:04:03] little
[1:04:07] here's one person sitting here
[1:04:09] he said well I don't do the things I
[1:04:11] used to do
[1:04:14] here's another person
[1:04:16] I don't do the things I used to do
[1:04:19] but I don't do what that person is doing
[1:04:26] now see you've become judge
[1:04:29] instead of listening to the heart of the
[1:04:31] individual
[1:04:39] trying to get down to simple
[1:04:41] terminologies for us to think about
[1:04:43] something and we're going to talk about
[1:04:45] Hebrews 13 8 we've got to be able to put
[1:04:47] him in the word
[1:04:49] right
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:54] you know there's people that have asked
[1:04:56] God to forgive them and he's forgive
[1:04:57] them sure
[1:05:00] you know there'll be people in heaven
[1:05:04] that are not as we call it born again
[1:05:06] here
[1:05:08] because you got your foolish virgins
[1:05:10] you've got all of your other groups
[1:05:12] now how are you going to get them there
[1:05:16] I like to see that well you just don't
[1:05:19] understand when they're good to the
[1:05:20] bride
[1:05:22] well praise the Lord but a lot of them
[1:05:23] didn't never know the bride
[1:05:27] laughs
[1:05:30] amen I'm trying to get you to see
[1:05:32] Hebrews 13 8 like you've never seen it
[1:05:34] before and then you'll see why for 45
[1:05:36] years
[1:05:39] and some of you have been here for
[1:05:42] 40.
[1:05:46] and you'll know
[1:05:48] and understand what I've been doing
[1:05:54] I've been trying my best to get you and
[1:05:56] I to a place to see Jesus Christ for our
[1:05:59] own selves yeah
[1:06:04] not to see him as a group collectively
[1:06:09] but to have our own personal experience
[1:06:17] then all together
[1:06:20] around the world
[1:06:23] the bride of Christ
[1:06:25] can be the fullness of the godhead
[1:06:27] bodily
[1:06:30] she can beat the son of man
[1:06:34] all together but not one person
[1:06:38] but a random couldn't be the fullness
[1:06:40] but a random couldn't be the sort of man
[1:06:42] brother random wooden almighty God
[1:06:45] come on we don't believe in the junk
[1:06:48] we believe the truth
[1:06:53] but think about it
[1:06:55] see we're constantly judging people by
[1:06:57] our own bushel of apples as we call it
[1:07:00] right
[1:07:01] that's a old saying amongst us Southern
[1:07:04] you know don't judge my bush on apples
[1:07:07] by your rotten apple
[1:07:09] now you know what happens to that you
[1:07:11] you take a bushel of apples the whole
[1:07:13] time someone's old enough to raise some
[1:07:15] potatoes and you you take potatoes and
[1:07:18] you put them up and and you you fix them
[1:07:20] and and they're wonderful to eat later
[1:07:23] but yet you put a rotten one in there
[1:07:25] and it not only rottens that rotten
[1:07:28] wrong out it rottens everything around
[1:07:29] it so that's what he's talking about an
[1:07:32] apple you know you put a barrel of Apple
[1:07:34] together you put one rotten apple in the
[1:07:36] middle of it it's going to run the whole
[1:07:37] barrel for long
[1:07:39] so don't judge
[1:07:43] right
[1:07:44] people by what you think
[1:07:48] let God be the judge
[1:07:52] in other words we bring to people will
[1:07:54] judge them right
[1:07:55] the life we live the mannerism as we
[1:07:58] read in Hebrews the way we live and I
[1:08:00] will judge the world
[1:08:02] you sisters wearing a dress out will
[1:08:04] judge the world why because the world
[1:08:06] out there don't believe in wiring them
[1:08:07] like that
[1:08:11] so they're going to have to change the
[1:08:12] sign down at
[1:08:13] the restroom yeah
[1:08:15] you know
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:20] you know we sent symbols up to the outer
[1:08:22] space back a long time ago
[1:08:25] in you know back then the women had
[1:08:28] dresses long hair and clothes on
[1:08:32] and the men had
[1:08:34] pants and shirts and things you know
[1:08:36] their hair cut off and we put them in
[1:08:38] these little cubicles and send them to
[1:08:40] outer space just in case there's
[1:08:41] somebody out there
[1:08:45] well what if it come down now
[1:08:50] what if those people come down well we
[1:08:53] sent them 40 years ago
[1:08:56] right come on you see what I'm talking
[1:08:58] about don't you you see how we're
[1:09:00] deteriorating and falling apart
[1:09:02] they were losing all femininity and
[1:09:05] masculinity
[1:09:07] until now you can't tell who's who
[1:09:12] but then you got the women walking
[1:09:13] around
[1:09:16] right
[1:09:18] come on
[1:09:22] why is it in your you're in the day now
[1:09:24] when all women wants to
[1:09:28] operation house would it be nice you
[1:09:31] know to make everything look bigger
[1:09:37] well I thought the man spoke out of the
[1:09:39] chest
[1:09:44] yeah you're Taylor go ahead
[1:09:46] at least your life later how do you
[1:09:48] remember it
[1:09:50] and make a good point
[1:09:52] but listen
[1:09:54] how is God going to judge seven billion
[1:09:56] people that are alive today
[1:09:59] and the comparison of how many trillions
[1:10:01] of trillions of trillions that have been
[1:10:03] in the world
[1:10:03] how's he going to judge him
[1:10:10] and how is he going to judge the
[1:10:11] trillions of them that was before Jesus
[1:10:14] Christ
[1:10:17] right
[1:10:19] see we've got the ideas
[1:10:21] and it is because Jesus Christ paid for
[1:10:24] the sins of those back there as well as
[1:10:26] over here that's why he held out his
[1:10:27] arms
[1:10:29] they were stretched out to where it
[1:10:30] would take the old and the new
[1:10:34] and he would stand between law and Grace
[1:10:40] yeah we just think about Grace
[1:10:43] a major statement there the other
[1:10:44] weekend here
[1:10:46] and a brother asked me later about it he
[1:10:48] said
[1:10:49] I explained it he said God I'm bad to
[1:10:51] just say things and thank you supposed
[1:10:53] to understand
[1:10:54] and I'm sorry I'm just getting old and
[1:10:56] that's but yet you ought to understand
[1:11:00] but listen
[1:11:04] is the world going to be judged by your
[1:11:06] ideas
[1:11:11] or is it going to be judged by the word
[1:11:13] of God
[1:11:15] so we find in the word of God that
[1:11:16] there's people going to be in heaven
[1:11:18] that are not as we say born again that
[1:11:21] are not in the times of Jesus Christ
[1:11:24] never heard the gospel
[1:11:27] right
[1:11:29] well I'm a firm believer brother Dale
[1:11:31] you got to be born again but I agree
[1:11:32] with you we need to be
[1:11:37] now we'd have to determine what you mean
[1:11:39] by burned again
[1:11:44] that's why people can't read brother
[1:11:46] Branham and follow him
[1:11:49] he said you say you accept Jesus Christ
[1:11:51] as your savior
[1:11:58] he said then you have eternal life
[1:12:08] they can't handle themselves
[1:12:11] or he could say like adoption I can
[1:12:14] prove that you're born again and then
[1:12:16] baptized into the body
[1:12:21] and I'll wrote around his message
[1:12:24] we'll get to that more this afternoon so
[1:12:25] we put a they put everybody gets in a
[1:12:28] category
[1:12:31] we look at them today as we see Baptists
[1:12:33] here at Methodist here at Presbyterian
[1:12:35] here Pentecost was here and you say why
[1:12:37] are you putting them out like that
[1:12:38] because each one of those groups believe
[1:12:41] you must belong to their group right
[1:12:43] now they don't make it that you've got
[1:12:45] to belong to us to be saved
[1:12:48] you know they're kind of getting away
[1:12:49] from that
[1:12:50] but back in my day if if you as a
[1:12:53] Baptist you you didn't go to a Methodist
[1:12:55] Church
[1:12:58] you know
[1:13:00] and I've tried to tell you about the
[1:13:02] Baptists if people don't believe it but
[1:13:03] you're going to try it
[1:13:07] no matter how many times you've been
[1:13:08] baptized father son Holy Ghost if you'll
[1:13:10] be baptized 40 times when you go to the
[1:13:12] Baptist Church you're going to get
[1:13:13] baptized one more time
[1:13:16] because they're not going to let you
[1:13:17] come in their Fellowship until you're
[1:13:19] baptized in their Fellowship
[1:13:23] you can go from a Baptist to a Methodist
[1:13:25] Church they don't require you to get be
[1:13:27] re-baptized
[1:13:29] but you go from any church to a Baptist
[1:13:32] you're going to be baptized again
[1:13:34] if you don't believe it go ask them
[1:13:40] let's see Church
[1:13:43] God has a way of getting a lot of people
[1:13:46] to heaven
[1:13:48] he's a wonderful God
[1:13:51] he's a loving God
[1:13:56] see hell was made for the devil and his
[1:13:58] angels wasn't made for people
[1:14:01] right
[1:14:03] we go to hell we go over the blood of
[1:14:05] Jesus Christ
[1:14:08] but can you understand and not look at
[1:14:11] everybody that tries to make everybody
[1:14:12] in your cubicle you're you're a little
[1:14:16] tall your idea your concept of something
[1:14:23] you know yourself people will tell you
[1:14:24] in a heartbeat most everybody especially
[1:14:26] young converts if you don't believe this
[1:14:28] message you're gonna die and go to hell
[1:14:35] well now I won't run around them for
[1:14:37] that
[1:14:39] and we talk about he was a prophet I
[1:14:40] want you to read where he says that
[1:14:47] you see church I'm trying to get you and
[1:14:49] I to see one thing
[1:14:50] break down off of our intellectual talks
[1:14:54] and Concepts and get down to true
[1:14:57] Christianity
[1:14:59] there's going to be people in heaven
[1:15:04] that never didn't even know about Jesus
[1:15:06] Christ
[1:15:08] and there's going to be maybe a lot of
[1:15:10] us in hell that's been our whole life
[1:15:12] serving what we thought was him
[1:15:20] but you know there won't be no Escape at
[1:15:22] that day there won't be no changing
[1:15:26] run around made an outstanding statement
[1:15:28] one day he said you can call him Jesus
[1:15:30] Jesus and worship the devil
[1:15:38] right
[1:15:44] what about it
[1:15:52] don't judge everybody I've never done it
[1:15:57] but yet for 45 years I've tried to
[1:15:59] progressively ever what you want to call
[1:16:01] that word
[1:16:03] growing in Grace and knowledge
[1:16:07] amen knowing that everything and I said
[1:16:09] well I preach everything to you I start
[1:16:11] off at a partial realization any
[1:16:13] doctrinal issue that I bring I start at
[1:16:16] the lowest I can bring it
[1:16:18] of a partial realization of that
[1:16:21] and going to the Heights and the greater
[1:16:23] depths of all things
[1:16:25] because I said how do we get these
[1:16:27] virtues
[1:16:28] well I just need them I got to have them
[1:16:30] so I got them
[1:16:32] Like Richard when he came down he said I
[1:16:34] never heard nobody say
[1:16:35] that they was required I said I didn't
[1:16:37] say that brother random did
[1:16:41] he said they're required
[1:16:46] but you see we want to base Christianity
[1:16:48] Upon Our Own concept
[1:16:53] instead of thinking about the rest of
[1:16:54] the world
[1:17:00] that's why you've never seen me
[1:17:02] ridiculed denominations do nothing
[1:17:05] one brother Brown said the problem was
[1:17:07] he said
[1:17:09] I'm not against the people he said I'm
[1:17:11] against the system
[1:17:15] right
[1:17:16] what is the system
[1:17:18] doctrines
[1:17:21] ideas of mankind as to some way to be
[1:17:24] saved
[1:17:27] well you don't want us to be good
[1:17:30] I think that's a moral obligation as a
[1:17:33] human being is to be good
[1:17:35] whether you're born again or whether
[1:17:37] you're a Hindu to who Do's or
[1:17:40] whatever you are
[1:17:42] if everybody in the world had a sensible
[1:17:45] partner listen to their inward being of
[1:17:47] a moral con you know moral part of them
[1:17:50] of their soul they wouldn't be so much
[1:17:52] killing around the world
[1:17:59] but see how much are we killing
[1:18:04] if you don't believe the way I believe
[1:18:05] you're out yeah
[1:18:07] well you know what if God
[1:18:09] now I make this statement I won't call
[1:18:12] the name because I've tried to get away
[1:18:13] from them because I've made some
[1:18:14] statements people told me they said I
[1:18:16] didn't say that
[1:18:17] so I'm going to try to get away from
[1:18:18] saying who said it but this brother one
[1:18:20] day said he was talking about him and
[1:18:22] said brother random said brother he said
[1:18:27] from word that person is down there to
[1:18:29] you something converted he said that
[1:18:32] person's low and you're higher
[1:18:35] what he said from where you are to where
[1:18:37] I am
[1:18:40] he said did a whole lot of higher depth
[1:18:43] what he said from where he is to where I
[1:18:45] am is a whole lot higher depth
[1:18:51] you see
[1:18:54] we think that Well everybody's got to
[1:18:56] believe this message go to heaven
[1:19:00] because that's what we've been taught
[1:19:02] you know they ever doctrines there is
[1:19:04] and been taught by some mankind
[1:19:06] or now woman kind because they got the
[1:19:08] women in the pulpits now
[1:19:12] but listen Church
[1:19:16] what does it mean
[1:19:19] how is everybody going to get to heaven
[1:19:20] what's what's going to heaven
[1:19:24] me and my wife and Joe and his wife and
[1:19:27] that's four no more
[1:19:32] is that right
[1:19:35] why have you got 969 different
[1:19:37] denominations
[1:19:39] right the Baptist wants everybody to be
[1:19:41] Baptist and that's just wants everybody
[1:19:43] to be mad the Presbyterian wants
[1:19:45] everybody to be president during the
[1:19:46] Catholic wants everybody to be Catholic
[1:19:47] right
[1:19:50] the brand of mine said we're among they
[1:19:52] want everybody to be brown much
[1:19:56] then you got this group that believes
[1:19:58] this Doctrine and this group believes
[1:20:00] that Doctrine and if you don't believe
[1:20:02] that Doctrine
[1:20:03] you're lost
[1:20:09] I told the brother when he's going to
[1:20:11] Jeffersonville one time years ago I said
[1:20:13] you're going to run into some fun you
[1:20:15] get up prayer
[1:20:17] he didn't know what I meant they got
[1:20:18] there
[1:20:21] he got out walked down through there and
[1:20:22] this person come on said
[1:20:25] no paraphrase it could have been a long
[1:20:27] time but said
[1:20:29] you believe right around was God
[1:20:33] first thing the person said
[1:20:36] I mean
[1:20:37] but you know what that man believed
[1:20:39] brother was God
[1:20:43] well he's going to die and go to hell
[1:20:44] believe in that
[1:20:48] what's the difference in that and your
[1:20:49] thoughts
[1:20:51] Two Souls Two Lords seven Thunder
[1:20:53] virtues proves et cetera et cetera et
[1:20:54] cetera
[1:20:56] come on let's get off of all that let's
[1:20:58] let's get down to Lula ochs
[1:21:00] okay you know Lula ice you know that's
[1:21:04] where we live
[1:21:05] you know a lot of people now introduce
[1:21:07] us as Lula ice because I've said that so
[1:21:10] much
[1:21:14] what do we think
[1:21:21] what is your idea of
[1:21:24] of a
[1:21:26] salvation
[1:21:28] what is your idea of an ending of all
[1:21:31] things what is your idea of what's going
[1:21:33] to cause a Rapture to come
[1:21:39] in Lula Georgia
[1:21:44] I've told you my idea
[1:21:47] I've told you what I believe
[1:21:51] we talk about a change of the body there
[1:21:54] is no change of the body outside the
[1:21:56] reveal word of God
[1:22:00] it's this message revealed to you and I
[1:22:05] that will walk off this Earth in that
[1:22:07] message
[1:22:12] but we're all going to be at the same
[1:22:14] level
[1:22:15] we're not responsible for the same level
[1:22:19] our education limits us to this to that
[1:22:22] the other education brother doesn't want
[1:22:24] to do with salvation come on
[1:22:29] it has something to do with your human
[1:22:31] abilities
[1:22:32] maybe to express what you believe or
[1:22:34] whatever but it still has that
[1:22:37] but are we all on the same level when
[1:22:39] the Bible said I'm God and I change not
[1:22:44] and he says Hebrews 13 8 said he's the
[1:22:46] same yesterday today and forever
[1:22:53] come on you Justin
[1:22:57] think about it
[1:23:02] what is your concept of Christianity or
[1:23:05] your thoughts
[1:23:06] and you'll see why that people don't
[1:23:08] want this message
[1:23:09] why because it's been made a book of
[1:23:11] rules
[1:23:16] it's been made of human cons cious of
[1:23:18] someone
[1:23:24] we first came in this message
[1:23:26] years ago it was all around Gainesville
[1:23:30] and I'm not throwing off on nobody
[1:23:32] because I don't told you where I stand
[1:23:36] but you could say brown them out and
[1:23:38] they'd say oh that's bunch of people
[1:23:39] looking around and come back the tent
[1:23:41] and go across country
[1:23:43] that was the concept that people had
[1:23:46] there was a concept of the world
[1:23:49] at least the Badness you said what about
[1:23:51] the right well they believe in going to
[1:23:52] heaven they believe you need to be born
[1:23:53] again
[1:23:54] but what is the Lula ice and what is the
[1:23:56] the people that believe
[1:24:00] well it's got to be this it's got to be
[1:24:01] that's got to be this got to be that
[1:24:04] what if God don't take it exactly the
[1:24:06] way we judge it
[1:24:13] you don't think I have a right to think
[1:24:15] I didn't say you didn't have a right to
[1:24:17] think
[1:24:20] I said we
[1:24:21] if we're going to think we're supposed
[1:24:23] to think
[1:24:24] of Hebrews 13 8.
[1:24:27] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:24:30] forever
[1:24:32] and to treat everybody that away
[1:24:35] and to look at everybody with that
[1:24:36] understanding
[1:24:41] but you know what most people do they
[1:24:42] look
[1:24:45] the witness in the Bible there
[1:24:47] when two of them was praying
[1:24:49] one on one side said Lord
[1:24:52] I thank you
[1:24:54] I fast and I pray and I do these things
[1:24:58] and said Lord I'm not like that fella
[1:25:01] over there on the other side of the
[1:25:03] praying
[1:25:04] I do this and I do that
[1:25:08] we know he's telling the truth he didn't
[1:25:10] do it
[1:25:11] right sure
[1:25:13] or he'd have been lying and he wouldn't
[1:25:14] lie before God so he was telling the
[1:25:16] truth he didn't do anything
[1:25:17] but on the other side was water man said
[1:25:19] Lord just forgive me
[1:25:25] now which one do we want to be
[1:25:30] he said well you sound like that you
[1:25:31] don't believe in being
[1:25:33] good I don't believe in being good I
[1:25:34] believe in being born again
[1:25:37] I believe in letting Jesus Christ come
[1:25:39] and live in our hearts and our soul and
[1:25:41] then that's the goodness of anything is
[1:25:43] Christ Living in US
[1:25:47] and then how much stronger do I believe
[1:25:49] that we must find the word of the hour
[1:25:52] that you and I are living and walk in
[1:25:54] that word
[1:25:56] because that's what I've been preaching
[1:25:57] 45 years what to try to get people to
[1:26:00] see we have to become
[1:26:03] the message
[1:26:06] living in you and I not just talk about
[1:26:09] it
[1:26:13] not as a book of rules or doing but a
[1:26:16] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:26:21] to see Christ Living in our hearts and
[1:26:22] lives
[1:26:29] but you see we've got our own concept
[1:26:31] like I tell you about the man up in
[1:26:32] Canada that time that God spoke to his
[1:26:36] heart when he's riding down the road and
[1:26:37] there's a prostitute walking down the
[1:26:38] street
[1:26:40] what would you do and how would you
[1:26:41] judge that
[1:26:42] he pulled over to the window rolled it
[1:26:44] down and said how much is the cost for
[1:26:47] your time
[1:26:50] she tells him the cost he gives her the
[1:26:52] money she gets in the car he said I
[1:26:54] don't want your body I want to talk to
[1:26:56] you about your soul
[1:26:57] God spoke to me to try to talk to you
