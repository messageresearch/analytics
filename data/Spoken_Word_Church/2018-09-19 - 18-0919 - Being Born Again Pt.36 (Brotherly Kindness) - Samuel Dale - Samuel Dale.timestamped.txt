[1:40] don't you
[1:41] good to see everybody the house the Lord
[1:43] if you'd like to following your
[1:45] scriptures turn what we've been reading
[1:46] in 1st Peter 1 and second Peter 1 is
[1:51] everyone for another remember all the
[1:54] announcements that's been made and the
[1:56] different things that we were praying
[1:57] for I prayed the Lord would lesson and
[1:59] guide each one and the healings and
[2:04] virtues cause he said he promised it
[2:06] said he sent his word and healed and
[2:07] delivered us from destruction so I
[2:10] believe that don't you and I look
[2:12] forward to all of the things that he
[2:15] does for us to show the manifestation of
[2:18] his love for each one of us and we would
[2:21] just thank the Lord amen hmm I know he's
[2:25] already sung it but today's Terrance's
[2:27] birthday so he's he's got to be you know
[2:31] somewhere in in age because that makes
[2:34] us older so we won't
[2:35] he's getting social closer to Social
[2:38] Security he's following Wade but they're
[2:41] they're getting on up there you know so
[2:43] when they get to be in Social Security
[2:45] will be in unsocial so that's somewhere
[2:51] close another way I got so remember that
[2:53] all right first Peter and then the
[2:55] second Peter Lord Jesus we thank you for
[2:58] this day and your grace on to us and we
[3:00] thank you for your loving understanding
[3:02] of us thank you for you Lord and we ask
[3:05] you now to just bless us and keep us in
[3:08] the Lord to show your love and
[3:09] understanding into our hearts and our
[3:11] lives and to come down and open our eyes
[3:14] to understanding of thy word that we may
[3:17] see you and father we ask you to just
[3:20] reach down and touch each one remember
[3:22] the sick among us and remember your
[3:24] promises so we thank you for all of
[3:26] these things we love you and we just
[3:28] cherish your presence with us keep us in
[3:31] Jesus name
[3:33] and we have a little announcement to
[3:36] make we did it looks like we're going to
[3:38] be able to pick up some property over
[3:41] here beside of us and we thank the Lord
[3:43] for that that they're there sitting up
[3:46] and getting everything where we can get
[3:48] a little more into our we've been
[3:50] allowed to use for parking but now we're
[3:52] going to be able to get the property and
[3:55] the way it looks it's not going to cost
[3:57] us any time so that would be great we'll
[4:00] have to divide it between the two
[4:02] churches but that's good we can take
[4:04] care of no problem so we we thank the
[4:06] Lord that he's done this with prayed and
[4:09] wanted these things for yours and he's
[4:12] making his way all right
[4:13] we thank you verse 22 seeing you have
[4:22] purified your souls and obeying the
[4:24] truth through the spirit unto unfeigned
[4:26] love of the Brethren see that you love
[4:28] one another with a pure heart fervently
[4:31] being born again not of corruptible seed
[4:34] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[4:36] which liveth and abideth for ever now
[4:41] how are you born you were born by the
[4:44] word what is the new birth it's the
[4:48] birth of the word that you have heard in
[4:52] that that has always been the new birth
[4:54] no matter what age or what it is it's
[4:57] the birth of the word so then we thank
[4:59] God for that ok now second Peter yes
[5:03] Simon Peter a servant and apostle of
[5:05] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[5:07] like precious faith with us through the
[5:11] righteousness of God and our Savior
[5:13] Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[5:15] multiplied unto you through the
[5:17] knowledge of God and though Jesus our
[5:19] Lord
[5:20] according at his divine power hath given
[5:22] unto us all things that pertain unto
[5:25] life and godliness through the knowledge
[5:27] of him that have called us now war to -
[5:31] glory to a glorified body - always Anglo
[5:34] in to his virtue - glory and virtue
[5:37] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[5:40] great and precious promises that by
[5:43] these you might be partakers of the
[5:44] divine nature
[5:46] escape the corruption that is in the
[5:48] world through lust and beside this
[5:50] giving all diligence add to your faith
[5:51] virtue to virtue knowledge to and to
[5:54] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[5:56] patience and to patience godliness and
[5:59] to godliness brotherly kindness and to
[6:02] brotherly kindness charity amen you
[6:06] might be seated the Lord Aires and his
[6:09] blessing to the reading of the word now
[6:12] what have we been doing for quite some
[6:16] time
[6:17] speaking on the stature of a perfect man
[6:20] that you see back here behind us and and
[6:22] all in trying to get us to a position to
[6:26] understand you know to walk in the light
[6:29] of his love all right now as I've said
[6:32] to you the day of Pentecost the
[6:35] disciples came forth after being tutored
[6:38] for the three and a half years of their
[6:40] time with the Lord Jesus and when the
[6:43] Holy Ghost fell it placed them
[6:45] positionally in the body of Christ
[6:49] giving them what we would be calling the
[6:52] faith of the fathers you know the
[6:54] revelation the the thing of the Father
[6:57] has given it unto us and Peter's see
[7:01] actually he he's over here as I was
[7:04] emphasizing the other day that you take
[7:07] acts 1 and 2 especially acts 2 you get
[7:11] in to Peter and his expressing of Jesus
[7:16] Christ coming up and what's happening
[7:18] and and the bringing forth you know
[7:20] other things and then the Holy Ghost
[7:23] falls on the 3,000 outside but I've
[7:26] tried to emphasize that point to you
[7:28] that 120 they were in the upper room and
[7:32] when God gave them the new birth the he
[7:36] gave it to them right here where it says
[7:39] holy spirit that's why people can't
[7:42] understand brother Branham they get him
[7:43] all confused and an understanding but
[7:47] then what happened
[7:49] was that the 3000 outside they could not
[7:54] be borned are they were born babies
[7:56] right here and had to grow
[7:58] so Peter names telling us and that's
[8:00] what Peter was doing Peter was
[8:03] expounding the Word of God to those
[8:07] people that were gathered outside and
[8:09] explaining about the Holy Ghost and this
[8:11] is that which was spoken of by the
[8:13] prophets and then things you know and as
[8:16] it come forth then they received the new
[8:19] birth with that new birth put them at
[8:22] faith or the new birth is booting you
[8:25] born babes desiring the sincere of milk
[8:27] of the word it didn't put him where the
[8:29] disciples were because it would put all
[8:32] that and and my point I've tried to I
[8:35] try to make illustrations or no one
[8:37] maybe I'll lose you in the illustrations
[8:38] but just like that God didn't use
[8:41] somebody even when the Holy Ghost fell
[8:44] he didn't use some of the others that
[8:47] were maybe capable he used Peter to
[8:50] explain about the baptism of the holy
[8:54] ghost that had happened you know when
[8:56] the Holy Ghost had fallen there and all
[8:58] in bringing through acts 1 and then he
[9:00] gets into and he explains of things
[9:02] because God doesn't use a novice to
[9:04] write the word he doesn't use a just a
[9:07] child a baby to write his word he uses
[9:10] someone that's seasoned in the gospel
[9:12] will see then Peter goes right on and he
[9:15] writes this message and he said I'm
[9:18] sending this to those that are of like
[9:20] precious faith those that had the new
[9:23] bird like him had eternal life in their
[9:26] soul by receiving Jesus Christ as their
[9:29] Savior and he said now I'm sending as to
[9:32] that group of people to where they can
[9:34] be able to come to where we are all
[9:37] right then he brings it forth and and
[9:40] shows them just add to your faith virtue
[9:42] to virtue knowledge knowledge temperance
[9:45] and patience and by bringing those
[9:47] things to bring the people to where they
[9:50] were all right that's why the Prophet
[9:53] then when he came he preached the
[9:56] message on the Statue of a perfect man
[9:59] explaining these things you know
[10:02] that you can't just say well well I'm
[10:07] born again I got everything no that
[10:11] won't work they ought to be sensible to
[10:13] know it won't work but yet being
[10:16] sensible enough then someone I have to
[10:18] tell you it's not enough you you've got
[10:20] to grow as a natural child you eat to
[10:25] grow all right
[10:26] so in the spiritual children you got to
[10:29] eat the Word of God study the Word of
[10:31] God you know pray and and see God and
[10:34] ask him to reveal these things to you
[10:37] instead of just saying oh I believe that
[10:39] let it be a part of you and if you have
[10:44] the new birth you will desire right
[10:49] isn't it what we read
[10:51] you'll desire said we'll desire the
[10:53] sincere milk of the word that we may
[10:55] grow thereby because he that would be
[10:58] part of your life why wouldn't you want
[11:00] to grow in Christ why would that not be
[11:03] your desire to want to know more about
[11:05] God well I know enough about what do you
[11:09] what do you mean you know enough about
[11:10] him you know you when we get out of here
[11:14] we won't even know enough about him
[11:15] because we'll be able to go down through
[11:17] the endless ages of time with receiving
[11:20] Christ's word alright but see that's
[11:23] what we've been trying to express to
[11:25] show why that people don't understand
[11:29] brother Browns message is because they
[11:32] try to take their understanding and by
[11:35] taking their understanding it will go in
[11:38] the wrong way even though they can bring
[11:40] the word to the letter you know but it
[11:44] still doesn't bring it in the right
[11:47] order and that's the one thing I've
[11:49] emphasized lately to you that we just
[11:53] read the statue of a perfect man with
[11:55] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[11:56] patience godless brother they come but
[11:59] what about each one of those things that
[12:02] we've studied we found out that we must
[12:06] depend and I've always believed this
[12:09] like I said God don't use a novice
[12:11] throughout his work so I've depended
[12:13] upon all of my life I hope you have
[12:16] to the fact that the Bible says that
[12:18] we're built on the foundation apostles
[12:19] prophets Jesus Christ being the chief
[12:21] Cornerstone you know and build on what
[12:23] those apostles tout of the Lord Jesus
[12:27] Christ because they had a personal
[12:29] experience and you and I must have that
[12:31] experience and and walk in those things
[12:34] and not be satisfied to just be well
[12:36] okay you know okay and then especially
[12:39] not get confused when we get into the
[12:43] Bible enough to try to study the statue
[12:46] of a perfect man we found some very
[12:48] interesting spots there that looks
[12:51] confusing but they're perfectly right if
[12:55] we wait upon the message of the hour all
[12:58] right now remember sister Shepherd I
[13:01] believe it was the dream that she had
[13:02] that the messenger was pouring the
[13:05] message into the church which was the
[13:07] water he was pouring into the pyramid
[13:09] top of it and it was washing out all of
[13:12] the trash and everything well see that's
[13:14] what the message is supposed to do it's
[13:16] supposed to wash out all of our clean
[13:19] out a lot of our trash and get us
[13:21] settled in the word all right and in
[13:24] doing it we found some very art to me
[13:26] it's been very interesting because I
[13:29] like to look at things as to what the
[13:33] Prophet says all right and then walk
[13:37] with what he's talking about
[13:39] and then I can study the scriptures and
[13:43] see what it's talking about
[13:45] and see that he's bringing us the Word
[13:48] of God all right but he's bringing it
[13:51] according to understanding for the time
[13:56] all right so then we we've taken each
[13:59] one of the virtues you know faith works
[14:02] or knowledge temperance patience it's
[14:03] not a virtue actually faith is a birth
[14:05] we've been over that enough but still we
[14:08] can just talk about virtues you know in
[14:09] time but it's actually faith is actually
[14:12] a birth all right but what about the
[14:15] examples now that has been given in what
[14:18] we've done let me run through them real
[14:20] quick and maybe it won't lose people
[14:23] from months of services that I've tried
[14:26] to bring let me just run through this I
[14:28] wrote it down exam
[14:29] of this this and just think about these
[14:32] things for a minute and consider it
[14:34] alright now we must understand the
[14:38] message by way of the Holy Spirit
[14:42] revealing what the messenger has brought
[14:45] to us right I mean the Bible didn't
[14:50] change I mean did you have certain Bible
[14:53] back to iron and then in doing so you
[14:56] say well y'all have a funny Bible well
[14:57] I've just plain-old Scofield I mean I
[15:01] have this one and everybody says they
[15:03] got a King James Schofield they don't
[15:05] they have a I have right off from the
[15:08] King James because you don't have King
[15:10] James versions anymore it's 1611 then
[15:14] you don't have those you can hardly even
[15:16] find them to order them all right but
[15:19] we've tried to take some of the words
[15:21] and be able to discover words because
[15:25] we're human beings we do things by words
[15:28] right we talk my words we're we're very
[15:32] funny though because you know we would
[15:36] say to people over you all in y'all and
[15:40] stuff like that and we were all messed
[15:43] up in our different language statements
[15:45] a lot of times but we at least can
[15:48] understand that's why I've always said
[15:50] that you go up north and you say I want
[15:53] some tomatoes and potatoes well we
[15:56] really say it matters and taters well
[15:59] they just live like everything that's it
[16:02] because they pronounced it to make toes
[16:05] and potatoes but you know what I've
[16:09] never failed yet to get what I ordered
[16:13] now they may be sniggering as they walk
[16:16] away how long but they always bring me
[16:18] what I'm asking because they understand
[16:21] when I say mater's and taters because if
[16:25] you're educated and got more knowledge
[16:27] than I've got you you ought to be able
[16:28] to understand what I say you know
[16:31] because that's just language but that's
[16:32] just illustrating but not totally the
[16:35] point I want you to see is because I
[16:38] believe the understanding of each one of
[16:41] the virtues in the actual points that's
[16:45] being brought is very very vital to
[16:49] understanding all right and see if we
[16:54] don't take what he says and lay it in
[16:56] order then we're going to get the wrong
[16:58] understanding of wordings what is
[17:03] Philadelphia named brotherly love
[17:10] would you mind looking behind me on the
[17:12] pyramid and finding brotherly love go
[17:20] brotherly love is a six church age on
[17:23] one shot of the frame that you're trying
[17:25] to brain but on the other it's the
[17:27] seventh church AIDS now which one's
[17:32] right both well how can both be right
[17:37] because it's what you're taking what you
[17:39] understand it all right see we talked
[17:43] about faith brother branham brings out
[17:46] in the stature of a perfect man that
[17:48] you're born again by faith faith in God
[17:51] and he said then what is a what is faith
[17:54] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[17:57] personally to you so it's not natural
[17:59] wording is it
[18:02] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[18:04] personal to you alright
[18:06] now quick run through what we get to
[18:07] night we went to virtue it's odd isn't
[18:10] it that brother branham will if you read
[18:12] brother branham and try to read the
[18:14] Bible without reading it with
[18:17] understanding you're confused because
[18:22] brother Branham says
[18:28] rather than the kindness vii church age
[18:32] takes the rapture and I remember this
[18:36] happened years ago so not doing off on
[18:39] the man but 1971 - brother mote was
[18:45] preaching on the statue of perfect man
[18:46] and a man came by here and he said Don
[18:49] what are you in prison he told him a
[18:50] little bit he so that sounds real good
[18:52] we said let me study it out little mote
[18:55] said well I preached about 65 sermons on
[18:57] if you're welcome to them you know to
[18:59] save you time studying out a lot of
[19:00] things if you want to take it just
[19:01] listen oh let me figure it out myself
[19:04] he said I'll come back and preach it
[19:06] well he came back in about three or four
[19:09] months and he preached the rapture was
[19:13] gonna take place in the sixth church age
[19:16] because he had a quote from brother
[19:19] Branham that the rapture comes into
[19:21] brotherly kindness I'm serious this
[19:28] happened this Minister preached that the
[19:30] rapture was gonna come in the sixth
[19:32] church age because of the understanding
[19:35] of the word brotherly kindness as to
[19:37] Philadelphia which means brotherly love
[19:42] well I it's a very much understanding to
[19:44] that no brother they'll I can't even
[19:46] understand what you're talking about
[19:47] that's crazy
[19:49] to be thinking like that well that's
[19:51] true but that's what people think we
[19:54] take our own idea and then we try to
[19:58] mold the message into our frame or our
[20:03] ideas or methods or points to try to
[20:07] make it what we want it to be
[20:11] No and so I told you what the Prophet
[20:13] said what do we find out about virtue
[20:20] virtue in the natural means to be a
[20:25] virgin the Prophet said now that's not
[20:28] applied in this age like this this we're
[20:31] like that it does virtue doesn't mean to
[20:34] just be a virgin so you could be a
[20:35] virgin be as mean as rattlesnake you
[20:38] know what I mean you could be a natural
[20:40] virgin and be a Bonnie and Clyde
[20:42] situation you know you could be a
[20:46] murderer or whatever he said it's not
[20:49] that see it's really a virtuous life
[20:53] lived by Jesus Christ not just a virgin
[20:58] point being a virgin is wonderful
[21:01] honorable you know all that but it's not
[21:03] what if talking about in the statue of a
[21:05] perfect man so you could be a natural
[21:07] virgin say well well I'm a virgin I bet
[21:09] I I've got that one that's it I got that
[21:11] virtue no the probably said that's not
[21:15] what it is well then we must take his
[21:18] understanding if that's not what it is
[21:22] right so we go from virtue we go into
[21:25] knowledge now we know knowledge is not
[21:30] natural terminology of the word
[21:33] knowledge this is Holy Ghost knowledge
[21:37] you can have one person standing there
[21:40] to be able to quote the entire Bible by
[21:43] memory and the other one maybe like me
[21:46] couldn't quote John 3:16 hardly from
[21:50] memory and I'm not joking I have trouble
[21:53] with scriptures that away because I
[21:56] don't depend on trying to memorize it
[21:58] I depend on trying to see what it's
[21:59] talking about we see this person's got
[22:03] it totally down he's got knowledge
[22:06] but what is it by his ownself
[22:10] interpretation we had knowledge that
[22:13] we've heard before we heard of this
[22:15] message right but we've Trinitarians
[22:17] Whitman who's baptizes and Father Son
[22:20] Holy Ghost come on till you get what I
[22:23] mean you say I've got knowledge I
[22:26] memorized the Bible that's not what
[22:28] knowledge is
[22:30] that's Holy Ghost knowledge that's
[22:32] knowledge to know what did we cover it
[22:35] the prophets say the knowledge to know
[22:37] that Matthew 28:19 does not contradict
[22:40] acts 2:38 see that's the kind of
[22:44] knowledge he was bringing holy ghost
[22:47] knowledge all right then we went from
[22:49] knowledge or nothing to to the next was
[22:52] temperance and he said now temperance
[22:54] here and this is not talking about not
[22:57] drinking alcohol we'll see that's our
[22:59] natural word of understanding it would
[23:03] relate to to not drink it out he said
[23:05] now that's not so he said in this case
[23:07] here it's done so all right in that case
[23:10] he's not talking about not drinking
[23:12] alcohol he's talking about your temper
[23:14] he's talking about your long tongue
[23:17] right did we read them did we go through
[23:20] the Prophet talking about those things
[23:21] how to control your tongue we'll see if
[23:25] we took the natural meaning of the words
[23:26] where would we be
[23:28] take the natural meanings of the word
[23:31] brother then I've got faith I believe in
[23:34] them and I live a good life you know
[23:37] I've always been a virgin and everything
[23:42] I was a little good and I got a good
[23:44] knowledge of the word and that you know
[23:48] and and I don't mind my temper I control
[23:51] my temper and everything well you could
[23:54] do every bit of that and still be lost
[23:56] is that what brother brother says
[23:58] blasphemous name statue a perfect man he
[24:00] said people have a portion of these
[24:02] virtues without even being born again
[24:07] you got good neighbors around you right
[24:11] somebody you can depend on you need help
[24:14] that come and help you they do anything
[24:15] in the world for you right but that
[24:17] don't make them a Christian right so you
[24:22] can't put them in heaven because of what
[24:24] you do or don't do all right
[24:26] but you understand what I'm getting at
[24:27] see I'm getting at the point that we
[24:31] must take what he says
[24:34] to be able to understand what the Bible
[24:37] is saying so that it wouldn't be
[24:44] temperance is not drinking alcohol that
[24:50] wouldn't be the definition all right it
[24:52] may not mean a thing in the world to you
[24:54] but it means everything to me to look at
[24:57] the Word of God like that did I see what
[24:59] he's saying I'm not looking at the words
[25:03] he says yet that's the only way we can
[25:08] hear come on
[25:09] but I'm really trying to get the point
[25:12] of what he's saying
[25:13] see most people are only listening to
[25:16] your wordings to be able to refute what
[25:18] you're saying so they're listening to
[25:20] what you say
[25:21] you said so-and-so but I didn't mean
[25:24] that
[25:24] well you said it I meant this and no
[25:31] meaning of like that you ever been that
[25:33] away
[25:33] I said no yeah I know I'm the only
[25:37] confused nut in the building that's all
[25:39] right
[25:39] I believe God loves the nut anyway you
[25:42] got a house nuts I hold a boat sometime
[25:44] all right I'll just go along with that
[25:46] all right because this is the way I've
[25:48] always been I try to look at what rudder
[25:50] on him is saying instead of the words
[25:54] he's saying now that does that sound
[25:58] confusing you know I go exactly about
[26:01] what he says well that's all right
[26:05] but sometimes you're gonna get massively
[26:07] confused what did he say
[26:10] Judas went hung his sail and you go do
[26:13] likewise now I just said two scriptures
[26:16] are you gonna do it no cause that ain't
[26:21] what the Scriptures talking about right
[26:25] see we're quoting the word let me use
[26:29] the word run around use one day we're
[26:31] coating the word really coating it
[26:35] instead of quoting it because we're
[26:37] coating it over to try to make it say
[26:39] what we want it to say right all right
[26:44] see then we got into patience and
[26:47] patience was what he said having
[26:50] patience even with God to wait on God
[26:54] and realizing God is working out things
[26:57] and all that one fits pretty good in all
[26:59] the natural and the spiritual is the
[27:02] word patience because it's just a
[27:03] natural word to be used of that form
[27:07] alright but then we got to godliness and
[27:12] brother Branham looked and he said five
[27:15] dictionaries trying to find a meaning
[27:17] for the word godliness well he probably
[27:20] looked at five of them that told the
[27:23] definition of godliness as to be in
[27:26] pious are being ever how you pronounce
[27:28] those big word godly or deities or
[27:32] whatever but that wasn't what he was
[27:35] looking for you remember that one what
[27:37] was he looking for he was looking for an
[27:41] understanding of godliness that was what
[27:44] he knew Peter was saying
[27:49] you know he was getting what Peter was
[27:51] saying not what the words they spelled
[27:54] on the page but getting the point
[27:57] remembered had to come from the Greeks
[28:00] and the things down to the English so
[28:03] you lose a lot of meaning on things you
[28:06] know and that's why people get confused
[28:08] on it but that West we were going
[28:12] through gardening as we talk about what
[28:14] it was to be like God then he turns
[28:19] around and hardly takes the scriptures
[28:22] and says now this is the way your godly
[28:25] he takes you the acts tasty - Matthew
[28:28] 28:19 to be therefore perfect
[28:32] right read for statue a perfect man come
[28:37] on we need and he goes immediately to
[28:39] Matthew 5:5 48b is therefore perfect
[28:42] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[28:44] what do you realize then if we have
[28:45] these virtues in us we're just as
[28:47] perfect as God is right let's see we
[28:53] looking at the meaning of the word
[28:55] godliness to just see some pious state
[28:58] or some great holiness or some something
[29:01] we could do
[29:03] none of these virtues has to do with
[29:05] what we can do remember I didn't speak
[29:08] on it that much but remember the peacock
[29:10] to have peacock feathers right not to
[29:16] have a buzzard putting peacock feathers
[29:18] in and saying I'm a peacock no don't
[29:22] worry about it just get born again
[29:24] that's what I've always tried to express
[29:26] to thee we went through the the message
[29:29] part because you remember me in the
[29:31] background of it as saying it
[29:33] I wondered how in the world could we get
[29:35] these virtues you know how could we get
[29:38] them when I knew there was demanded of
[29:40] us to have until one day God spoke to
[29:44] them and said by the opening of the word
[29:47] they will be brought to you well what is
[29:50] oh my what is my goal to open the word
[29:53] to speak by the open word to try to
[29:56] bring the things that God is prompt and
[29:57] where did we break 327 Church age book
[30:00] right this messenger Malachi 4 do 2001
[30:03] turn the hearts of fit children back to
[30:05] the faith of fathers and he said it
[30:07] would be they kneeled to via reveal the
[30:08] thunders which is revelation contained
[30:10] in the seven seals and said to me these
[30:12] divinely revealed mystery truths now I'm
[30:14] quoting over brighter that will
[30:16] literally turn us back with why would we
[30:19] not want to know all about the seals and
[30:21] the things of the message I thought we
[30:25] believed sister Shepherd the part of her
[30:28] dream that we'll get to in a minute that
[30:30] the that was water flowing down and
[30:33] coming in a natural looking but when the
[30:36] acid what about this he said that's
[30:38] that's that's not water he said that's
[30:41] the Holy Spirit he said the Holy Spirit
[30:44] is boiling out all of these things
[30:46] says you can't hold the Holy Spirit in
[30:48] anything said it won't stay in no
[30:50] organization it won't do this for that
[30:53] of the other right it won't won't be
[30:56] done you can't do that with the Holy
[30:57] Spirit
[30:58] but then what did this takes it was was
[31:01] running over boiling out the trash then
[31:03] what happened
[31:07] somebody took honey and poured it in
[31:12] well I believe that somebody was the
[31:14] church age messenger well you want to
[31:15] believe it enough I kind of believe
[31:17] that's the way it is but it doesn't say
[31:19] that way he just says that then the
[31:24] whole brotherly kind of the honey was
[31:26] poured in and said that represents
[31:29] brotherly kindness now that's going to
[31:32] be very valuable in a few minutes if we
[31:34] have time to get to it to understand
[31:36] something about the honey because honey
[31:40] is the most wonderful thing there is as
[31:43] far as natural purities and things and
[31:46] as far as all over the world it's the
[31:49] same you get no out no vitamins no
[31:54] things no trees no watermelons no this
[31:58] that all over the world's gonna be this
[32:00] I
[32:01] but honey all over the world is the same
[32:04] made the same comes out to same taste
[32:07] this night wonderful for the Prophet to
[32:12] use it isn't that okay why did he get it
[32:18] why does he the one that calls brotherly
[32:22] kindness to honey and he said it will
[32:25] hold but it don't look like it right but
[32:31] it will hope all right now you following
[32:34] me so then we went from we're up on
[32:38] brotherly kindness now all right now to
[32:43] look at brotherly kindness you can read
[32:44] the statue of a perfect man and and
[32:46] follow through out there what the
[32:48] Prophet is saying about it and how the
[32:49] what it is and what it represents and
[32:52] the things but I want you to think with
[32:55] me for a minute
[32:57] in the natural wording of the word
[33:01] Philadelphia
[33:03] it means brotherly love the city of
[33:07] brotherly love that's what it's called
[33:10] what now the Prophet then took it now
[33:16] listen he took it in the studying of the
[33:19] church ages and the laying in order of
[33:22] the ages and he takes Philadelphia as
[33:27] the sixth church age because that's what
[33:31] the scripture brings it you know were
[33:34] you coming through you know is you're
[33:35] you're coming forth now looking for what
[33:37] I'm talking about so you got Paul then
[33:40] you got Iranians Martin and then you got
[33:42] Philadelphia through Wesley
[33:45] and it's called brotherly kindness and
[33:48] that was called the brotherly kindness
[33:50] age the age of Wesley because of the
[33:54] missionary endeavors now I'm quoting
[33:56] brother Branham I got him laying here in
[33:58] front of all right
[33:59] that's the missionary endeavors called
[34:02] it to be then the age of brotherly
[34:04] kindness but one would Peter put his six
[34:12] thing is to be godliness and then he
[34:20] would bring his seven thing to be
[34:23] brotherly kindness
[34:29] anybody got the answer I'm not being
[34:33] sarcastic I'm being serious
[34:35] what is the answer why is it there like
[34:40] that
[34:42] I've tried to illustrate on all the
[34:44] others if you listened virtue doesn't
[34:50] mean a virgin life it had a deeper
[34:54] meaning than a virgin life you know just
[34:57] to be a virgin
[34:58] it had a deeper meaning because it went
[35:01] into the spiritual aspect of a virtuous
[35:04] life lived in Christ and to live that
[35:08] life so that others can see and receive
[35:11] strength you remember that from strength
[35:14] from us are you or whatever you know as
[35:17] you're living before them huh well see
[35:22] there's an i it would it not be no I
[35:24] thing to continue the same pattern yeah
[35:28] I just expressed it to our second ago
[35:31] enough to where did you come down to
[35:33] what do you get then you get to
[35:35] knowledge you get to temperance you get
[35:41] the patience then you get to godliness
[35:45] well I now to take the natural
[35:49] definitions of each of those words does
[35:52] not give you the spiritual revelation do
[35:55] you understand what I'm doing I mean you
[35:57] understand what I'm trying to do I'm
[36:00] trying to get you to use that thing
[36:01] called the brain right no I want the
[36:04] Holy Ghost you can't get it nowhere
[36:06] except through the brain I don't mean
[36:09] you don't receive I don't mean you see
[36:10] the whole ago I mean faith comes by
[36:12] hearing and hearing comes by hearing the
[36:17] word is got to come through the brain to
[36:20] get to the rest it can't be it's not
[36:22] quick until you out in your hand and
[36:24] then you eat it it's only quickened when
[36:28] it can come within you and be made alive
[36:32] within you will see the natural wordings
[36:34] in
[36:38] the natural wordings won't get it that
[36:43] to me now listen that's to me it's why
[36:46] the people don't understand well brother
[36:48] branham would preach the statue of
[36:50] perfectly and yet right in the midst of
[36:56] all of trying to express it to you
[36:57] remember the thoughts we brought out
[36:59] that Paul and Peter is preaching the
[37:02] same thing letter Brendan said they
[37:05] never met they did for just a little bit
[37:07] and then Paul and Peter separated you
[37:09] know and they come back years later Paul
[37:12] and Peter were preaching at same time
[37:15] well what was Paul preaching that was
[37:17] the statue of a perfect man or what was
[37:21] Peter preaching that was Paul's adoption
[37:24] you see they were expressing in
[37:26] different ways what God was trying to
[37:30] reveal Paul was telling about the
[37:33] adoption and using the natural form of
[37:36] it of adopting and then adopting your
[37:38] own children into the family etc until
[37:41] you come out with the nature of the
[37:43] Father and come to the point where you
[37:45] can be trusted all that speaking on
[37:48] adoption he was speaking on the statute
[37:49] of perfect man that's what Peter was
[37:52] saying Peter's told me add to your faith
[37:55] virtue knowledge templates places caught
[37:57] in brotherly kindness when got to it yet
[38:02] brother own calls it the true baptism of
[38:06] the Holy Spirit see people go haywire
[38:10] I've heard doctrines on it now come on
[38:13] not throwing off on nobody but I've
[38:16] heard dr. and say if you got the Holy
[38:17] Ghost you got turned up down upside down
[38:20] you know you're gonna have to go out to
[38:22] put that and turn it upside down and the
[38:26] statement I read to you the other week
[38:27] and preach to you we're right around the
[38:29] edge you come all this way to godliness
[38:31] and said you were coming up to patience
[38:33] since it you ain't got to hold a ghost
[38:36] yet well I've had people to throw that
[38:39] in my face
[38:41] brother Brennan said we got to Holy
[38:42] Ghost yet we know what I agree with him
[38:48] that most people don't have the Holy
[38:50] Spirit that's what's wrong if they had
[38:55] the Holy Spirit there wouldn't be so
[38:57] much confusion with its natural people
[39:00] with natural terminologies or words
[39:03] trying to understand a spiritual word to
[39:07] me the entire Bible is written that away
[39:11] like a told you Paul would say the God
[39:13] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ God
[39:16] and Father there's got to be two of them
[39:20] then we get all confused and it's
[39:26] thoughts like that with a simple
[39:29] illustration you just translate the word
[39:31] and to even and that's perfectly right
[39:35] in the scripture so it is God even
[39:38] father of our Lord Jesus Christ now
[39:41] you're not confused and just like
[39:45] brother branham will bring out he said
[39:46] to understand the Godhead to what I'm a
[39:48] father I'm a son I'm a human being I'm a
[39:54] General Motors employee or formerly
[39:56] pastor a church I got many many titles
[39:59] but I got one name I got one personality
[40:04] trying to be displayed right there's you
[40:09] understanding garbed in because that's
[40:11] what he does see to understand the
[40:15] Godhead is simple because the Bible said
[40:17] it that could be understood by the
[40:18] things that we see but I'm trying to get
[40:23] you to do I told you I said no we're
[40:24] gonna have problems when we get a little
[40:26] further along you remember a few weeks
[40:29] ago I said you think maybe this is
[40:32] confusing about virtue and virgin and
[40:34] that don't mean this way and and in
[40:37] temperance and things don't mean this it
[40:39] means this and I said we get a little
[40:41] farther we get on the brother
[40:42] countenance
[40:43] we're really gonna get confusing
[40:50] because you simply look at the pyramid
[40:53] behind you look at it it's totally off
[40:59] as far as natural concerns Philadelphia
[41:03] is supposed to be brother kindness if we
[41:07] take the natural words on here but if we
[41:11] take God's revealed word in Logan to us
[41:14] the sorts a beautiful picture of a
[41:18] marvelous thing that a prophet is the
[41:22] one who brings the message see no
[41:27] theologian can figure that out a
[41:29] theologian would want to say okay the
[41:31] best thing for us to do is we need to
[41:34] swap these two guys in in these two ages
[41:36] and kind of put them around in a
[41:38] different place and you know and give it
[41:40] a little understanding but now that
[41:42] wouldn't want Peter say it and that's
[41:46] why brother ran him to see like I said
[41:48] when he'd come
[41:49] he said you got all the way up here to
[41:50] to godliness
[41:52] the six-lane godliness and he said you
[41:56] ain't got the Holy Ghost yet people just
[41:59] go haywire well no we said watch the
[42:01] Prophet see it no you didn't now that's
[42:06] what's so hard to try to convince people
[42:07] to show them that they're standing there
[42:09] lying through their teeth to you the
[42:12] sound say it want the prophets it will
[42:14] not any 42nd
[42:17] because he said you had to hold a ghost
[42:20] when he was born again at the bottom of
[42:21] the pyramid
[42:22] the same Holy Ghost they come on the day
[42:25] of Pentecost
[42:32] but you see that's where people take
[42:34] their own ideas and they say you got to
[42:36] change this you got you you can't make
[42:37] this go to that no but what are you
[42:42] gonna do with it well I don't need to
[42:46] understand that you goofed by thinking
[42:53] that because you're saying that
[42:56] brotherly kindness is a six church age
[42:58] and the Prophet said this brotherly
[43:00] kindness was the age of the rapture and
[43:02] you're saying the rapture is gonna come
[43:04] into six church age and six church age
[43:06] Pais a long time ago right my right you
[43:14] don't have to agree with me I'm just
[43:16] asking them you explained it some other
[43:19] way it's got to be something the Bible
[43:23] and the the Prophet has got to be saying
[43:26] the same thing and they've got to be
[43:28] saying what Peter said you know in the
[43:32] correct order of the way Peter was
[43:34] saying it so Peter is the one that said
[43:37] add to your faith virtue knowledge
[43:39] temperance patient godliness brotherly
[43:42] kindness and then headstone which is
[43:47] Christ the only thing brought around him
[43:50] ever done he just took it from faith
[43:53] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[43:55] godliness brotherly kindness and he said
[43:57] true baptism with the holy God
[44:02] they were going to get to the statements
[44:04] they let on my - don't worry about it
[44:06] don't get confused we're brother Branham
[44:08] says is God coming down through Christ
[44:11] Holy Spirit God coming down through
[44:18] Christ Holy Spirit welding all of this
[44:21] together and that's it perfectly exactly
[44:26] right because you see that's where we
[44:31] need to understand instead of just
[44:34] taking something well I can understand
[44:36] brother so enjoy even yeah oh yeah
[44:42] and we knew you're 40 years old to hold
[44:46] your hand up just night with me can you
[44:50] say ABCs
[44:52] [Music]
[44:54] like anonym says about it you know
[44:56] people come in to scoop and they bring
[44:58] their little kid to the first grade or
[45:00] kindergarten you know well my little boy
[45:02] he knows is a B's rolling my visas
[45:04] abcdefgh I think and then the teacher
[45:08] says would you go over on the board and
[45:10] point out a
[45:14] No well you don't know what a B yes what
[45:20] to see you only done is memorized it
[45:24] that's what people's done with this
[45:26] message is memorized it and that's
[45:28] wonderful but I don't try to memorize it
[45:31] I don't try to read that to memorize er
[45:33] I'm not joking you for you to tell me to
[45:35] quote the Lord's Prayer I would miss it
[45:38] I guess
[45:41] because I've never tried to memorize
[45:44] God's Word
[45:47] I've tried to study it
[45:49] leave it lay and let him pick it up when
[45:53] he needs it and see that way then you
[46:00] just go down the road don't worry about
[46:02] it okay but you remember what I said
[46:08] Sunday I said well my party right or
[46:10] maybe it was life's nothing the
[46:12] wonderful greenie huh if there's
[46:15] anything I've ever enjoyed doing he's
[46:16] taking things that looks contrary one to
[46:19] the other one and let God show the truth
[46:22] about it it'll bring a great revelation
[46:24] to your heart and peace and joy within
[46:27] you to realize that God has spoken to
[46:32] you in all of the mass confusion that is
[46:37] around us in the message the mass
[46:39] confusion of mankind studying this Bible
[46:43] of the theologians the people that
[46:46] writers are doing the comparing the
[46:49] memories inside and how that they missed
[46:51] God with a little seventh grade
[46:57] education man walk out to her and God
[47:00] could speak to it you know he could tell
[47:04] you what Peter was talking about you
[47:06] know why am i right he had experienced
[47:12] it you can only tell what you've
[47:15] experienced
[47:17] [Music]
[47:20] what did the thing with a warming up
[47:23] unit the Statue of Liberty I've been by
[47:26] it and looked at it out the window of a
[47:28] bush but I so tired from riding twelve
[47:30] hours from Israel the light II didn't
[47:32] get the camera up to take a picture you
[47:35] know but you know there's been people
[47:37] been all up in that I said I've been out
[47:41] in the front of it but I never been up
[47:43] in it what are you saying I'm saying if
[47:47] we haven't experienced anything how can
[47:49] we explain it how can you explain
[47:54] something you've not experienced well
[47:57] this is what I thought see very
[47:58] important that's what he said this is
[48:00] what I find all right what are you
[48:04] winning now to think about it isn't it
[48:08] odd and I got these laying out here in
[48:12] front of them if you want it word that
[48:14] Philadelphia is the age of Brotherly are
[48:18] the the Philadelphia is the word used
[48:22] for the city of Philadelphia
[48:24] that means brotherly love not brotherly
[48:32] kindness and the Prophet says that this
[48:38] is the age of brotherly kindness
[48:43] well what age are we in are we in the
[48:48] 6-2 age of the seventh age
[48:57] you see what I'm talking about I'm
[48:59] trying to get you to look at something
[49:01] from a natural point of words and
[49:03] letters and things that to show you that
[49:06] words and letters will kill you Paul
[49:08] said the letter killeth with the spirit
[49:11] giveth life the revealed word brings
[49:14] life you know what I'm talking about you
[49:18] remember the day you saw water baptism
[49:20] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:23] it opened your eyes didn't it and it
[49:26] opened the Bible I remember when first
[49:28] seeing it called name you know when when
[49:30] somebody said to me who brought them all
[49:32] talking about the name or whatever I
[49:33] remember then everywhere I read in the
[49:35] Old Testament even every time I'd read
[49:37] scripture I'd run across the word name
[49:39] you know I said that's a great word name
[49:42] need to look it up one of these days and
[49:44] find out what all that means name
[49:46] because it just what you're about in you
[49:49] car go buy you a new car and you get you
[49:53] a a purple something Lamborghini or
[49:59] something some kind of fancy looking car
[50:02] you know and you get one of one certain
[50:04] color and nobody's got one like that
[50:08] right I've never seen this color before
[50:13] it is beautiful
[50:15] I'll go buy it because I'm only one's
[50:16] got it you get in the car and you drive
[50:18] about three blocks and you see two of
[50:19] them same color
[50:21] right that's the way we do spiritually
[50:27] we think just because things fits
[50:30] together for us that it's right I've
[50:34] took them old Ruby screws and my knife
[50:37] and cut that thing in two because I
[50:38] never could get them together you know
[50:41] taking a hand it over to one of the kids
[50:43] and they go your daddy
[50:45] same thing with a computer Richard come
[50:50] fix the computer is left out
[50:54] I'm just a little bit above Dagwood cuz
[50:58] he had that little buddy of his next
[50:59] door you know a little boy but them
[51:01] little boys they can figure that hang
[51:02] out but come on now listen to what I'm
[51:04] saying
[51:06] why would it be that brother branham
[51:11] wouldn't know and say it how many of
[51:14] them do you need of statements from
[51:17] brother branham where he talks about how
[51:20] that the Philadelphia Church age was the
[51:23] age of brotherly love
[51:28] now how many of them do you need there's
[51:31] one that's all for the Ephesian Church
[51:34] age - the church age is called the
[51:38] Philadelphia church age because he's
[51:40] referring to back to the - who it was
[51:43] about west linda.thank Philadelphia
[51:46] Church age likes it from 1750 to about
[51:49] 1906 this age due to the meaning of the
[51:54] name of the city has been called the age
[51:58] of brotherly love as Philadelphia means
[52:01] brother love of the Brethren and that's
[52:08] the Wesleyan six church age but why
[52:17] would it come up see then to come up
[52:19] into brotherly kindness to your virtues
[52:22] and things and how you come out to
[52:28] garden and this he said then to
[52:31] brotherly love
[52:32] brotherly brotherly kindness and then
[52:36] love
[52:38] on would he be making these things why
[52:42] would he go into the next on blaspheme
[52:43] his name and he talks about a brotherly
[52:46] kindness the age that we live in now
[52:50] okay which age do we live in which age
[52:57] are we living in here if we're in
[53:01] Philadelphia under the natural world
[53:03] we're still in the sixth church age but
[53:09] now here the Prophet says the seventh
[53:12] church age the age we're living in right
[53:15] now
[53:17] it's brotherly kindness is he so
[53:21] confused what about it he said no we
[53:28] live in the lady of sia huh
[53:31] now let's take that for a minute what
[53:34] does lady will see a man who knows
[53:36] people's rights is that the only
[53:40] definition in God
[53:45] subjects opens that the only definition
[53:47] you got since the named Lady of SIA
[53:55] means the people's rights our justice of
[54:00] the people
[54:06] the people's right lady of see you
[54:08] trying to get you to look at Lego see it
[54:10] for a second then we drop backwards okay
[54:13] go ahead number nine number eight
[54:14] brother they're pulling him 1:42 just
[54:18] one more one more time Lord it's exactly
[54:22] right what you said is exactly right and
[54:24] he come to me he was telling me the lady
[54:27] of sin means woman in Greek this is a
[54:35] woman's world it's a woman's church it's
[54:36] a woman's age there's a little more to
[54:40] it than just to be lady you'll see of
[54:42] being people's rights because we know
[54:48] that the woman's this in a lot of it
[54:50] right but you know also there is a group
[54:53] of people in the lady of seeing age that
[54:57] is a woman that is beautiful and perfect
[54:59] and described in the Word of God as to
[55:03] being in Revelations one Girt about the
[55:05] paps with a golden girdle talking about
[55:09] a bride
[55:13] he said we don't look at it on those
[55:15] foreigners do it lady your CEO means
[55:19] women woman this is a woman's world okay
[55:26] investments we find out now that we're
[55:29] becoming in our age and then you Bible
[55:33] teacher knows that the life stage of
[55:36] Pentecost is Lady of seal lady OC a
[55:41] means woman in the Greek the town like
[55:44] the woman takes over all right but he
[55:46] said anybody can see that that life
[55:48] stage is a Pentecostal age the
[55:52] Pentecostal age is the Lady of seeing
[55:54] age are you in the reading what he's
[55:56] saying okay we're gonna get back on the
[55:59] board in a second so hold on to it look
[56:02] at identifications the next one you talk
[56:05] about Pentecostals now because we're
[56:08] going over here to represent something
[56:11] Pentecost isn't it a strange thing that
[56:17] the Pentecostals listen is this modern
[56:22] age that the Bible predicts will be the
[56:27] lady of seeing so not that Pentecostal
[56:31] is not bride right come on
[56:34] are you following the point that is the
[56:37] Pentecostal age I'll tell my two bride
[56:41] come about the Pentecostal age is the
[56:45] lady of seeing age now we're gonna read
[56:48] in a minute that this age is the
[56:49] brotherly kindness age
[56:53] mmm well I don't understand what okay
[56:56] hold on
[56:59] the rapture number four number eleven
[57:03] Enoch was raptured 2/7 showing that it's
[57:06] the seventh church age that takes the
[57:09] rapture that's just in case somebody's
[57:11] out there wondering if brotherly love
[57:13] means six and we're going up in the
[57:16] rapture in a six church a just to give
[57:18] you that from brother Branham it's gonna
[57:19] be the seventh Church age we're living
[57:21] in the seventh church age we're not
[57:23] living in the sixth you'd be surprised
[57:25] how people are sealed from narrow-minded
[57:27] it's a that's church age it takes the
[57:30] rapture all right what is it what about
[57:35] it what about it well what are you
[57:40] trying to get at what are you trying to
[57:42] say I'm trying to say what the Prophet
[57:46] said when he told a sister's dream and
[57:50] he told it in blasphemous names and she
[57:54] dreamed and she wondered if she had she
[57:56] saw all this and saw the pouring of the
[57:58] water in and it boiling out and saw the
[58:00] man take the hunting pour it in and it
[58:02] holds and he gave her the interpretation
[58:06] she had to dream he preached the message
[58:09] a few months after her dream she comes
[58:12] back to him and tells him her comes to
[58:15] him and said you know I had that dream
[58:17] he goes back it was in that period of
[58:19] time she was shown the church the
[58:26] pyramid and she saw the water running
[58:29] down and she wondered if she had to hold
[58:31] a ghost or not
[58:33] you remember where we got started on
[58:35] this all right there how do you know you
[58:40] got the baptism when the holy God
[58:47] give me your evidence of the Holy Ghost
[58:51] I believe the message so does the devil
[58:58] I've shouted I've cried I've spoken in
[59:01] tongues I've done all these things I've
[59:02] seen visions I've seen angels I've seen
[59:04] all kinds of thing does that mean you're
[59:07] born again there's only one evidence of
[59:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's
[59:16] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[59:19] with the word right now looking at
[59:27] Philadelphia as been brotherly kindness
[59:32] and putting it down here and then
[59:35] remember we've got to bring brotherly
[59:36] kindness up to the seventh church age
[59:38] for this this age is doing in this the
[59:41] age of the brotherly kindness what's
[59:43] that it may get confusing in your mind
[59:46] so you may ask how to ask the Holy
[59:49] Spirit to keep it straight what you see
[59:55] this is the age the message was being
[59:59] poured into the church all right but the
[1:00:03] body itself in all together like it's
[1:00:09] not no words not that way but what man
[1:00:11] who was pouring the water the messenger
[1:00:14] to the church poured the message into
[1:00:17] the church but what was the water doing
[1:00:20] it was boiling out all of the trash and
[1:00:24] that's what the Holy Ghost does it balls
[1:00:28] it up like the Holy Ghost do we have the
[1:00:35] Holy Spirit the rent of the new birth
[1:00:41] I've asked you that over and over
[1:00:44] because it's the most serious matter you
[1:00:47] could ever think of in your life it's
[1:00:51] not what Trump's gonna do tomorrow it's
[1:00:55] not nothing like that ain't got nothing
[1:00:59] to do with it it's whether you're born
[1:01:01] again or not you say well what's brought
[1:01:06] being born again got to do with the with
[1:01:09] what you're telling my stature ferment
[1:01:10] thought if you're not born again what
[1:01:12] the prophets say he said you gotta have
[1:01:14] this this this this and he said you
[1:01:16] can't even start unto you how this which
[1:01:19] is the new birth you can't start the
[1:01:22] statue of perfect man without the new
[1:01:23] birth well do we have those virtues do
[1:01:28] we have the new birth
[1:01:31] do how the virtues I just spent my time
[1:01:34] trying to get away from the the point of
[1:01:37] it being so hard to understand what
[1:01:40] virtues mean virtues means a life of
[1:01:42] Christ
[1:01:46] it's his virtues it's not mine head to
[1:01:53] your faith it's given unto you you're
[1:01:55] born again he gives you the faith you
[1:01:58] are born again within his head whose
[1:02:01] virtue as God's virtue has to be added
[1:02:06] it's God's knowledge it has to be added
[1:02:08] he has to add these things to you and I
[1:02:12] and you remember what we brought out we
[1:02:17] brought out into prophets showed it
[1:02:18] statue a perfect man that a man with
[1:02:20] these virtues would be able to qualify
[1:02:22] for the rapture with what if we don't
[1:02:24] have them come on what if we don't have
[1:02:31] these virtues well brother there you
[1:02:35] mean we're lost no I didn't say is lost
[1:02:37] I didn't say you lost if you don't have
[1:02:43] a new birth you're lost that's sensible
[1:02:45] that's plain but the virtues is a growth
[1:02:49] development in the statute of a perfect
[1:02:50] man just like the growth development of
[1:02:52] a child growing up or a person growing
[1:02:54] up just like adoption and the child
[1:02:56] growing up to the to the father being
[1:02:59] able to trust them
[1:03:03] [Music]
[1:03:06] and then you say well we're brother Dale
[1:03:08] then what is it cause brother branham
[1:03:11] you know I read them enough to where you
[1:03:13] could see it
[1:03:14] I read enough to her that you can see
[1:03:15] that Philadelphia means brotherly
[1:03:17] kindness we get brotherly kindness is up
[1:03:21] above Philadelphia can you get that
[1:03:27] together what is your thought
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:37] see to the natural world Philadelphia
[1:03:41] literally means brotherly love
[1:03:47] [Music]
[1:03:51] but now listen to this statement
[1:03:58] [Music]
[1:04:00] what about brother branham talking of
[1:04:02] amazing kind of how that between the 6th
[1:04:05] and 7th church age there's an amazing
[1:04:08] thing you remember how he taught
[1:04:10] throughout the church ages and overlap
[1:04:12] from one to the other
[1:04:14] it always overlaps like a star step
[1:04:17] walking up it overlaps right each age
[1:04:20] overlaps each other you start off Paul
[1:04:21] as a foundation seeing you keep coming
[1:04:24] up not to the natural world of
[1:04:27] Philadelphia does mean and to the church
[1:04:31] age itself it was the age of brotherly
[1:04:35] kindness the six church age the six
[1:04:39] church age was the age of brotherly love
[1:04:41] missionary endeavor sand all over the
[1:04:43] world but then that was true and false
[1:04:46] fine brother Brennan said in the
[1:04:51] Philadelphia Church age page 298 he said
[1:04:58] really that lady Oh seal the life stage
[1:05:03] in many respects is simply carry on of
[1:05:07] the sixth age what about that see if you
[1:05:14] listen you'll see why it is to the world
[1:05:17] it's Philadelphia brotherly kindness
[1:05:19] that means six but to the bride
[1:05:22] it's brotherly kindness which means the
[1:05:26] honey
[1:05:27] that was poured in after the Holy Ghost
[1:05:31] boiled out all the tribes
[1:05:34] right go look but the life stage is in
[1:05:40] many respects simpler carry over on over
[1:05:43] six the seventh age a very short age
[1:05:45] gathers up into itself one quick work
[1:05:48] all the evil of every age and yet all
[1:05:51] the reality of Pentecost I'm just
[1:05:55] leaving it wrong say all of the world
[1:05:58] and the evilness but all of the reality
[1:06:01] of Pentecost how did you mean that
[1:06:06] once the Philadelphian age has about run
[1:06:10] it
[1:06:10] of course the lady of CNAs will quickly
[1:06:13] comes in brings both the tires and the
[1:06:17] wheat to the harvest so now there's no
[1:06:22] problem see to the bride in Wesley's age
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:32] they was in brotherly kindness you know
[1:06:37] because that was the time of the age I
[1:06:40] was doing for missionaries brotherly
[1:06:42] kindness shown to the world and gone you
[1:06:44] know but it just simply carries where I
[1:06:47] don't over into lady of SIA lady you'll
[1:06:52] see a doesn't become Philadelphia lady
[1:06:55] osya becomes the seventh Church age that
[1:07:00] the messenger can pour the honey into
[1:07:07] messenger pours remember the sisters
[1:07:09] dreamed up go back to blast name is
[1:07:11] names and read the water be important he
[1:07:16] said that was the messenger pouring the
[1:07:19] message this message has been boiling
[1:07:22] out that's why we're here
[1:07:24] fifty years after the going of the
[1:07:26] Prophet to try to give us time to get
[1:07:29] ready to understand the message I see
[1:07:36] then when it falls over into this age
[1:07:38] this is the age of brotherly kindness
[1:07:45] you know the definition brother Brennan
[1:07:47] gave he said you love your brothers and
[1:07:49] things but said you differ a little bit
[1:07:51] and said you part you pull apart in time
[1:07:53] he said but let something happen to that
[1:07:55] brother said you just said you hurt at
[1:07:58] your heart because there were your
[1:08:00] brother he's explaining explaining
[1:08:02] brotherly kindness to be greater than to
[1:08:06] just be a missionary even we're bringing
[1:08:10] it down to individuals and brotherly
[1:08:14] kindness the honey of brotherly kindness
[1:08:18] will hold all right now hold on for a
[1:08:25] second you can't draw it out on this
[1:08:28] drawing because it's not there but
[1:08:30] brother Branham says there's a little
[1:08:33] flange right here it made perfectly to
[1:08:37] fit I've drawed it many times and draw
[1:08:39] it to pyramid come down bring it across
[1:08:42] and make the part to where they'll fit
[1:08:43] together a little flange there's that
[1:08:49] true baptism of the Holy Spirit the
[1:08:56] honey
[1:08:56] that boils out all the trace gets pulled
[1:09:00] out by the Holy Ghost but the honey is
[1:09:02] this message quickened into our hearts
[1:09:06] and lives
[1:09:07] well there's honey in the rock my
[1:09:09] brother
[1:09:10] that's what we need we need the baptism
[1:09:13] of the Holy Ghost yes we get that at
[1:09:17] faith that is the new birth but we still
[1:09:23] got one little time to go where brother
[1:09:24] Brennan says that the headstone comes
[1:09:27] down and seals it all together we won't
[1:09:29] deal with that tonight we'll deal with
[1:09:32] that later but he says it's a statue of
[1:09:35] perfect land I've encouraged you to read
[1:09:37] that message over and over and over in
[1:09:40] brotherly kindness what would that be
[1:09:44] would it not be this message poured in
[1:09:47] to its total purity to not just boil out
[1:09:51] the trash
[1:09:55] now are you listening Little Rock box
[1:10:00] water poured in it it was running out
[1:10:03] going down the side of the pyramid and
[1:10:05] even brother Ron says blaspheme his name
[1:10:07] so he said God accepted her foundation
[1:10:10] because she was worried whether she had
[1:10:12] to hold his period or not and he showed
[1:10:14] her by the dream that she had the Holy
[1:10:16] Spirit II said God accepted her
[1:10:17] foundation what is her foundation faith
[1:10:21] is the foundation of the statue of a
[1:10:24] perfect man he showed her she was born
[1:10:26] again God accepted her faith the Holy
[1:10:32] Ghost poor come in with a messenger East
[1:10:34] messenger pouring in the message it
[1:10:38] would boil out to trash Paul's day
[1:10:41] Iranians Martin Columbo Luther Wesley
[1:10:44] Wright ball in the trash out but there
[1:10:49] was one messenger left that would be
[1:10:53] yourself that seventh one wouldn't be
[1:10:56] just porting the message in the ball out
[1:10:58] to trash
[1:11:01] he'd be pouring the love of God the
[1:11:05] honey the brotherly kindness is the
[1:11:11] honey that's what your prophet says it's
[1:11:18] the honey that's poured in that honey
[1:11:20] will hold you know what that honey does
[1:11:26] you get that Rock box it pours in it
[1:11:29] sets up tight well what happens when you
[1:11:31] pull the top down on it it's gonna
[1:11:35] squeeze out what it's not needed where's
[1:11:37] that going we'll get to it next we're
[1:11:40] not going it goes outside and it seals
[1:11:44] ever aged together the honey is what's
[1:11:50] doing the sealing the prophets message
[1:11:53] your sealing you in and sealing others
[1:11:56] out that's why it's brotherly condition
[1:12:02] ballin I mean Peter wouldn't wrong
[1:12:04] brother Brendan wouldn't wrong but Ren
[1:12:07] wouldn't wrong when he says brotherly
[1:12:09] kindness is the sixth church age
[1:12:12] Philadelphia then he turns and says
[1:12:14] brotherly kindness is the seventh church
[1:12:16] age
[1:12:21] he wasn't wrong he just carried over
[1:12:24] from the 6th over into the seventh just
[1:12:28] let that come down on the end sit on you
[1:12:30] squeezy with it then you got the thing
[1:12:33] but I run him said he said then there is
[1:12:36] the true baptism of the holy spirit
[1:12:39] that's a direct quote out of statute of
[1:12:41] perfectly true baptism what is a true
[1:12:44] baptism
[1:12:46] it doesn't mean salt like in comparison
[1:12:49] of true and false it's perfect
[1:12:52] realization what is the honey of this
[1:12:57] message two seals you in to the word
[1:13:00] that's been revealed to you
[1:13:03] the whole pyramid is sealed in by the
[1:13:05] honey as it goes down and sealed
[1:13:08] everything then it is God coming down
[1:13:12] through Christ Holy Spirit
[1:13:15] that's not trinitarianism that's exactly
[1:13:18] what has taken place
[1:13:25] the whole world is waiting on you and I
[1:13:28] adoption time when God can pour in and
[1:13:33] my quotient Road around him and God can
[1:13:35] pour in his fullness be there's a honey
[1:13:42] there that we need sure it's love for
[1:13:45] the Brethren it's love for one another
[1:13:48] it's brotherly kindness it's love but
[1:13:52] really it's this message going into the
[1:13:55] total maturity
[1:13:57] it's what sealing us we're sealed by the
[1:14:01] word that God has delivered this prophet
[1:14:04] brought the message
[1:14:07] listen I'm asking you listen to what
[1:14:11] weight is bringing on shut up man that
[1:14:16] was the first message I preached in 1969
[1:14:21] that the bride would be the son of man
[1:14:26] that's quoting brother Branham then as
[1:14:28] much as I could
[1:14:29] how much now listen to it well son of
[1:14:31] man son of man is resurrection I come on
[1:14:37] charge I don't mean this sarcastic we we
[1:14:40] Baptists studied about the son of man
[1:14:42] being the resurrection why because jesus
[1:14:46] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:14:52] so we didn't understand nothing of what
[1:14:55] we're talking about but we did at least
[1:14:57] we're able to read some of the word and
[1:14:59] believe it the son of man is the
[1:15:03] resurrection that's why brother Branham
[1:15:05] would stand there and he'd say bring me
[1:15:07] twenty four of your worst cases and I'll
[1:15:10] guarantee you healing for everyone who
[1:15:13] said that
[1:15:16] a man said it that was believing where
[1:15:19] he stood and that did not make him God
[1:15:23] but it made him the closest thing to God
[1:15:26] that there was I don't mind saying that
[1:15:29] just make sure you don't say that I said
[1:15:32] he was God because there's a lot of
[1:15:35] difference between the two he said you
[1:15:38] don't understand the Son of Man that's
[1:15:41] what I've always said it jerk
[1:15:43] the Apostle Paul never talked about the
[1:15:46] Son of Man
[1:15:49] none of those apostles preached anything
[1:15:52] about the Son of Man right no no come on
[1:15:56] give me scripts and talk about Matthew
[1:15:59] Mark Luke and John wrote I'm talking
[1:16:02] about the writers in the Bible show me
[1:16:03] where they said one word about son of
[1:16:05] man but what about a little old prophet
[1:16:08] walking out there about somewhere around
[1:16:09] I think the first time it's somewhere
[1:16:12] close to 50 or 51 it's not right in 47
[1:16:17] don't fight I believe it's about 50 or
[1:16:19] 51 but still think about a little old
[1:16:22] man walking out to our priests knowing
[1:16:23] son of pain what was brother branham's
[1:16:27] whole message based on something
[1:16:33] he understood now it's son of God mm-hmm
[1:16:38] so God makes way for son of man listen
[1:16:43] to what you're hearing but listen to it
[1:16:46] like I'm trying to tell you listen to
[1:16:48] try to understand what somebody's saying
[1:16:50] don't listen to the words they say that
[1:16:53] they say things and it comes out wrong
[1:16:59] you know you've been through that and
[1:17:01] listened and heard it do it what do they
[1:17:03] do
[1:17:04] radda radda Merced 700 Center 7,000 or
[1:17:07] 7,000 to the 700 they never heard
[1:17:10] another thing he said they were right
[1:17:15] they never heard what he said the rest
[1:17:18] of the message is only when this guy's
[1:17:21] confused
[1:17:22] it's supposed to be 700
[1:17:25] I straightened him out on there I'm
[1:17:28] gonna go see him when the service is
[1:17:30] over and boy he blowed the bubble didn't
[1:17:32] he
[1:17:32] cuz you got a little bit over he said
[1:17:34] 900 which is right I just said it wrong
[1:17:40] but that's what I'm trying to illustrate
[1:17:43] that's what we do with this message we
[1:17:46] try to find something to argue with the
[1:17:48] other person instead of trying to
[1:17:55] understand what the person is saying you
[1:17:59] listening to a preacher in the pulpit
[1:18:01] you're setting out here boy you missed
[1:18:03] Outland we missed an appointment we just
[1:18:05] missed the whole message Jordan estate
[1:18:06] oh now my ride he said well I straighten
[1:18:14] him I services over I'm gonna tell him
[1:18:16] where he missed all these things here
[1:18:18] ain't no preacher I don't know I'm sure
[1:18:21] I'm humble I was no preacher listen but
[1:18:24] the Lord showed me what he didn't show
[1:18:26] him boy you're real good
[1:18:31] you say you're silly I agree we but he
[1:18:35] gets the point across this message
[1:18:40] revealed is the honey that you and I
[1:18:43] need because it will bind us together
[1:18:47] and seal us into one another that we
[1:18:51] want to argue doctrinal points we'll
[1:18:53] talk about Jesus and what he means to
[1:18:56] each one of us instead of a doctrinal
[1:18:59] issue that goes from the pulpit to the
[1:19:05] janitor so we'll take it for that this
[1:19:11] message was not made to argue it was
[1:19:16] made to be lived instead of arguing with
[1:19:25] I've never tried to study the message of
[1:19:27] the Bible in any way - just to try to
[1:19:29] find something - contrary to somebody
[1:19:31] else but I have found out by reading it
[1:19:35] that there was a lot of things was
[1:19:38] contrary hadn't you but I didn't do it
[1:19:41] to try to find it what about the co
[1:19:47] musicians what about it why would the
[1:19:49] prophets a lady ousia is brotherly
[1:19:53] kindness but he needs to say
[1:19:56] Wesley's age of Philadelphia its brother
[1:19:59] in the kindness you know he's right both
[1:20:02] places because it's what he's explaining
[1:20:08] one of them is explaining the natural
[1:20:11] wording of Philadelphia just like one of
[1:20:13] them was explaining the natural wordings
[1:20:15] of virtue or knowledge or temperance or
[1:20:19] patience or whatever and he was
[1:20:21] explaining natural things but then you
[1:20:23] take the spiritual and then open up the
[1:20:26] word unto you I hope you'll think about
[1:20:30] what I'm saying and go home and just
[1:20:33] consider that messenger was pouring the
[1:20:36] message in to the church to boil out the
[1:20:40] trash when he got the trash boiled out
[1:20:45] he didn't leave it in tea he went and
[1:20:49] got a bucket of honey and he poured that
[1:20:53] in there and it sealed up all the cracks
[1:20:57] sealed up everything that was left and
[1:21:00] there was nothing left for just love
[1:21:01] itself because once it poured in there
[1:21:04] of that the head has something to sit on
[1:21:10] the head has a body to unite with we'll
[1:21:16] get to that next I hope you followed me
[1:21:18] and what I brought down to little random
[1:21:22] what do you mean the true baptism to
[1:21:27] bring all of these virtues he said into
[1:21:29] the individual he said will bring you to
[1:21:34] the true baptism of the Holy Spirit so
[1:21:38] what do we need we need faith virtue
[1:21:41] knowledge temperance patience darling
[1:21:43] simply we need these virtues and if it's
[1:21:48] necessary for us to have them why would
[1:21:51] we not be concerned with it and want
[1:21:54] them
[1:22:06] let's tan
[1:22:08] Oh 119 River let's just think on these
[1:22:14] things brotherly kindness she's looking
[1:22:25] at it show that ain't gonna hold that
[1:22:28] ain't go home you said it'll hold
[1:22:31] Oh
[1:22:33] that honey was holding on to that true
[1:22:38] baptism not just anointed ones anything
[1:22:43] like that you even consider that on true
[1:22:45] Baptists you're talking about some
[1:22:47] something happening of positions in
[1:22:50] Christ to where he can come down and
[1:22:53] unite with mankind you gotta have that
[1:22:58] Holy Spirit as representing brotherly
[1:23:01] kindness in this age to work the unite
[1:23:06] in this age go tonight we got to go to
[1:23:09] another age well what do you think we
[1:23:17] need we need to read pray and study we
[1:23:26] need to study and pray

[1:23:37] do my brother Dave I might get confused
[1:23:43] like I've always said honey don't worry
[1:23:45] about it if you're afraid you already
[1:23:48] confused
[1:23:54] I have to stand here ever Services put
[1:23:56] on the line what I believe and why I
[1:23:59] believe it right I tell you what I
[1:24:04] believe and why I believe it what would
[1:24:06] be your problem with telling them come
[1:24:08] and telling me this is what I believe
[1:24:10] and why I believe it
[1:24:17] look if anybody ever need
[1:24:26] little random said that brotherly
[1:24:28] kindness he says hard in other words
[1:24:30] like an individual can do things but he
[1:24:34] says hard to do in a group
[1:24:35] [Music]
[1:24:42] some of you leave out of here ever
[1:24:44] service go out and won't even shake
[1:24:46] hands with nobody

[1:25:14] time I went to a church one time and
[1:25:17] preached for a brother and he was very
[1:25:19] well known for leaving the pulpit and
[1:25:21] walking out the back door I've never
[1:25:23] seen nobody when I finished I walked
[1:25:27] down off the platform walked out to the
[1:25:29] front of the church and started shaking
[1:25:30] hands it took him about 30 minutes that
[1:25:34] he finally found me if I had 500 people
[1:25:40] I'd shake 500 hands because I want you
[1:25:47] to know this is one brother that loves
[1:25:50] you I'm no worthy of anything but
[1:25:56] there's one thing about it within my
[1:25:57] heart is a love for people that I've

[1:26:03] truth
