[6:06] at nine o'clock if you're going to ohio
[6:08] with us
[6:10] and
[6:10] pack
[6:11] lightly
[6:13] i know some of y'all don't know what
[6:14] that is but you could probably google it
[6:16] and it'll tell you what to do
[6:19] put stuff inside of stuff and i've
[6:20] stuffed so much stuff in my boots the
[6:22] other day until i had all the stuff i
[6:24] needed inside my boot almost
[6:26] so you can do it sisters i know you're
[6:28] shaking your head but you can do it
[6:31] all right so let's get to the word of
[6:33] god everybody happy
[6:35] amen let's go to part 42
[6:38] of who is this son of man we uh
[6:41] we've been looking at something i want
[6:42] to try to get to it and uh
[6:45] i want to uh
[6:47] thank god
[6:48] that he's give us
[6:50] all this brother bob
[6:53] brother luis
[6:54] brother aaron
[6:56] brother dale just laid an absolute
[6:58] foundation
[7:00] for us to be able to speak on and then
[7:02] we use like brother bob was using his
[7:04] quotes and if you'll notice a lot of
[7:05] times i'll use them i just don't say but
[7:07] it'll be from a previous sermon that
[7:09] brother dale preached so i don't mind
[7:11] using his quote
[7:13] don't mind one bit amen that's what our
[7:15] foundation is that's what we're built on
[7:17] sure we the prophet's message yeah
[7:20] we were built on the prophet's message
[7:22] but it took a five-fold ministry and
[7:23] that five-fold ministry has a voice
[7:26] that five-fold ministry has something to
[7:27] say it can't be different but if it's
[7:30] the same
[7:31] and it's breaking it down to the people
[7:33] then it's the same voice and it all came
[7:36] from god anyway it's not william brown's
[7:38] voice
[7:39] let me read you this quote real quick
[7:40] and i'll prove it to you brother brown
[7:41] said in the token 1963 says we're not to
[7:44] come together to talk about the message
[7:47] we are come together to get in the
[7:49] message
[7:51] and the message is christ
[7:53] he is the word that's right we're to get
[7:55] into it get beneath it yes sir that's
[7:58] what we're supposed to do
[7:59] he was not responsible for any person
[8:02] out from under the blood not one
[8:04] no matter who he was this is from the
[8:06] token message he was not responsible
[8:09] all had to take
[8:10] all had to take not only himself but his
[8:13] whole family he's talking about
[8:15] the night they were getting ready to
[8:16] leave the passover they're only safe
[8:18] when the token was displayed
[8:20] we cannot feel safe until this token is
[8:23] displayed that's right you must come
[8:25] under this token god's holy spirit and
[8:28] it displays to you jesus christ because
[8:30] it comes and lives in you
[8:33] so we're not here to what talk about the
[8:35] message
[8:38] we're here to get in the message and the
[8:40] message is what christ never saw a man
[8:43] that could brag
[8:44] on god so much but interlaced in there
[8:47] he's not ever bragging on himself but he
[8:50] tells you stories that's related to his
[8:52] life
[8:53] and he tells you those stories and
[8:55] you're and you never think that man's
[8:56] bragging
[8:58] i mean you hear people come and they
[8:59] talk about i i mean me i did this and i
[9:01] did that brother brown could say that
[9:04] but you would never you'd never realize
[9:06] that he was bragging on himself because
[9:07] he's always bragging on god
[9:09] and but you do have to have a vessel
[9:11] that it goes through so that's why we
[9:13] you know we brag on brother dale we brag
[9:14] all these other brothers like brother
[9:16] brown said said you're a liar if you
[9:17] don't want if you don't want somebody
[9:18] packing you on the back and say you did
[9:20] a good job and now what the prophet said
[9:22] he said i want somebody to tell me i've
[9:24] done a good job and i do want somebody
[9:26] to tell me if i did a bad job but just
[9:27] make it real low and you know over in
[9:29] the corner somewhere
[9:30] so anyway so let's bow our heads i know
[9:32] we got all new we all have needs this
[9:34] morning
[9:35] thank you for coming lord this place is
[9:37] full
[9:38] leave it good to see you back there
[9:41] let's pray
[9:42] dear god thank you for this day that you
[9:43] give us father we pray that you would
[9:45] sanctify us now for this journey
[9:47] give us this day our daily bread lord
[9:48] bless your people father
[9:50] you be the one that speaks as the
[9:51] prophet said there this is this is your
[9:53] message lord it's not william branham's
[9:56] message but it's your message and you
[9:57] have delivered it through william
[9:59] branham to give it to the bride to dress
[10:01] her with father and that's what we want
[10:03] to talk about a little bit today lord
[10:05] how about you
[10:07] and your bride
[10:08] father forgive us of our sins and bless
[10:10] this day be the ones that are sick
[10:11] brother danny and sister joyce they're
[10:13] on vacation taking some time off lord
[10:15] jesus be with that family that lost the
[10:17] two young kids up there in ohio
[10:19] and comfort you're the only one that can
[10:21] do that we can say we understand but we
[10:23] don't
[10:24] but lord we just give it to a big god
[10:26] that never makes a mistake
[10:29] never have you ever made a mistake lord
[10:31] and you never make one in even in the
[10:33] future
[10:34] father just give us lord strength
[10:37] to finish
[10:38] the race lord
[10:40] be with our pastor and bless him keep
[10:41] him strong
[10:43] bless us each one father and just give
[10:44] us today our daily bread in jesus name
[10:47] amen
[10:49] we got a big god
[10:52] i have a hard time being me but i sure
[10:54] don't want to be god
[10:56] amen
[10:57] and have to make the decisions he's
[10:58] already made
[10:59] but you know what his decisions are
[11:01] perfect
[11:02] and being that his decisions is perfect
[11:04] then he can come down inside of us
[11:07] and make us perfect amen but we're still
[11:09] human we have a human part that we can't
[11:11] sometimes we don't understand the things
[11:13] that went on why god would do stuff but
[11:15] why why do we question god because he's
[11:17] perfect
[11:18] so every move he makes is perfect
[11:21] he doesn't make a mistake he's not he
[11:23] don't have a oops moment we have oops
[11:24] moments all the time because we're human
[11:26] but he doesn't whatever he does is in
[11:27] order and he knows what's best for
[11:29] everybody so we just leave it in god's
[11:32] hands and just say lord
[11:33] whatever you have for them or whatever
[11:35] you had for them then lord
[11:37] we know where they're at amen
[11:40] who is this son of man part 42 john 1 1
[11:42] says in the beginning was the word word
[11:44] was with god in the word was god and the
[11:46] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[11:48] and we beheld his glory the glory of the
[11:50] only begotten of the father full of
[11:51] grace and truth you may be seated
[11:54] the lord has blessed him to the reading
[11:55] of the word
[11:57] now we were we've been on this
[11:59] predestinated to adoption for
[12:01] for now months but that's okay
[12:04] uh i hope we broke it down enough to
[12:06] where we can understand a little bit
[12:08] more of of our this is nothing it's just
[12:10] a plain it's your christian journey it's
[12:13] a journey that god's given us and and
[12:15] you know what these things are required
[12:17] it's a requirement that we come to
[12:19] church it's a requirement that we read
[12:20] your bible it's a requirement that we
[12:22] study but it's a requirement that a
[12:23] minister stands in the pulpit and tries
[12:25] to give it to you smooth off the rough
[12:28] edges get everything kind of in order in
[12:30] line and then let god speak to you
[12:33] because today i'm not speaking to you
[12:34] i'm just talking to you but god's going
[12:36] to speak to your heart something that
[12:38] you need
[12:40] and we've been looking we we we run up
[12:42] the pyramid and now we're going to we
[12:44] we're back down at the bottom because i
[12:46] wanted to make sure and we'll talk about
[12:48] today where that foundation faith is
[12:50] real big
[12:54] you believe in faith
[12:56] because the bible says without faith is
[12:58] impossible
[12:59] to please god impossible to please god
[13:03] thereby we believe that god wrote a
[13:05] bible right yeah okay
[13:07] all right so also we are talking about
[13:09] this adoption and it's not your birth
[13:11] now we've been back on the birth
[13:14] because that's your first stage that's
[13:15] getting you started that's getting your
[13:17] foundation that's getting everything
[13:18] laid exactly right and brother bob was
[13:21] talking about just a few minutes ago
[13:23] i mean
[13:25] if you don't do what the bible says
[13:26] that's iniquity
[13:28] plain and simple
[13:30] because what you're looking at the word
[13:31] of god and you're not doing what it says
[13:33] that's iniquity and we all have that
[13:36] part as brother dale says until we get
[13:37] to the body change we're going to have a
[13:39] little piece of that that mystery of
[13:41] iniquity is that person that we oh he's
[13:44] out there in the denomination no that
[13:46] mystery of iniquity sitting right here
[13:47] today
[13:49] and it's in me and you
[13:51] in our spirit realm and and motivating
[13:54] us even if we're born again is everybody
[13:56] with me
[13:57] all right so like brother bobby put on
[13:59] that you can be you can be baptized with
[14:01] the holy ghost feel good say them in the
[14:02] message you can come to church and you
[14:04] can read your bible and you can listen
[14:06] to the prophet's message but if you're
[14:07] not born again you're going to hell
[14:11] because you're going to fall under that
[14:12] iniquity where you have been taught
[14:14] maybe you haven't been taught now see if
[14:16] you haven't been taught that then god
[14:18] can't hold you responsible for it but
[14:20] you have been taught in this church that
[14:22] it takes three stages for a birth
[14:25] justification sanctification and the
[14:26] baptism of the holy ghost and over and
[14:28] over again we have told you that it's
[14:31] not that you can have all this and we
[14:34] read it many times before you can have a
[14:36] pentecostal joy
[14:38] but that's not all of it
[14:41] it gets pain now we do the same thing we
[14:43] get started in something and man we just
[14:45] like a house on a fire in a windy day
[14:47] and then all of a sudden a
[14:49] month later
[14:51] two months later
[14:53] life happens
[14:55] we make a we make a new year's
[14:57] resolution
[14:59] keep it about what maybe a month
[15:03] well that's humanity but it's not god
[15:05] god
[15:07] god makes a vow and it's his word
[15:10] and he doesn't ever break it and never
[15:12] will break it but what we've got to do
[15:14] is we've got to be sheep we've got to
[15:16] yield to that
[15:17] that's why i said before we you know
[15:19] we're looking at number 19 being
[15:21] baptized today but i want to ask you a
[15:23] question how many of those are going to
[15:25] continue on that's the decision you got
[15:27] to make
[15:29] if you continue on with god or if you
[15:31] let the cares of life
[15:33] or if you let this happen or that
[15:35] happened or this happened and then all
[15:37] of a sudden you disappear just like
[15:38] you've done before
[15:39] i hope that doesn't happen because you
[15:41] know what you're going to disappear one
[15:42] time and that mystery of iniquity is
[15:44] going to take over and you're going to
[15:45] stay out there and you're not going to
[15:46] be coming back in here
[15:47] everybody with me
[15:49] i'm just going to be playing today
[15:51] because this is the foundation if we
[15:52] don't get the foundation right you
[15:54] cannot build that house
[15:56] and god cannot work through your life
[15:58] unless you let him
[16:00] well i've done this
[16:06] being the message we don't have
[16:07] seniority in the message
[16:09] there's no seniority
[16:11] you've been a message two years and know
[16:14] as much as somebody knows in 50 years if
[16:16] you're sitting under the right teaching
[16:17] and if you yield yourself to the holy
[16:19] ghost
[16:20] amen
[16:21] because that's god
[16:23] that's god in the faith you have in that
[16:25] god god is ready to give it to us
[16:28] if we're ready to receive it
[16:30] all right so the first state let's look
[16:32] at the chart just for a minute we
[16:33] haven't pulled it up very very many
[16:35] times so remember now your adoption is
[16:37] not your birth so we pulled it apart and
[16:39] now we're at the birth part we're going
[16:41] to talk a little bit about a little more
[16:42] about that today but that's your chart
[16:44] that that is you
[16:46] that is your walk your christian in god
[16:50] that is what the
[16:52] the message of the hour to me has
[16:54] produced
[16:55] it's produced a new birth the correct
[16:58] way
[16:59] not under a false baptism not under a
[17:01] shaking a hand not under a write your
[17:04] name on a ledger somewhere and you've
[17:05] got an envelope sticking somewhere in a
[17:08] church
[17:09] but the new birth is as brother bob was
[17:11] talking about and we'll read in just a
[17:12] minute it's the birth of the word it's
[17:13] the birth of the word for your hour
[17:15] and that you will understand what's
[17:17] going on
[17:18] in the hour that you're living in all
[17:20] right i'm telling you if you are
[17:23] confused go back to the foundation
[17:27] well i can't understand what y'all are
[17:28] saying
[17:29] get born again
[17:31] obligated to do it he's obligated to
[17:34] tell you what we're saying
[17:36] he's not obligated to leave a child
[17:37] laying out somewhere in a desert and
[17:39] you'll say well there's the baby
[17:41] now he's obligated to nurture that baby
[17:44] if you'll let him
[17:46] so there's your there's your stature of
[17:49] a perfect man
[17:50] and we see that we've got a we've got to
[17:52] even go through these stages before we
[17:55] even get into
[17:57] this son of god revelation you see the
[17:59] bracket over there and what i mean by
[18:00] son of god revelation that's the new
[18:02] birth that's the new birth for your hour
[18:04] in your soul
[18:06] making you a son and daughter of god you
[18:08] are not a son and daughter of god until
[18:10] you're born again you are potentially a
[18:13] son and daughter of god but you are not
[18:15] a full-fledged son and daughter of god
[18:17] until you're born again read that right
[18:19] there because mans are led by the spirit
[18:21] of god they are the sons of god
[18:24] we'll talk about that in just a minute
[18:25] but then you come up a lot higher and
[18:26] then we're going to have to talk about
[18:29] the son of god through the seven church
[18:31] ages we'll get into that a little bit
[18:32] later on a couple of sermons from now
[18:34] but then you got these virtues that
[18:36] you've got they're required to work in
[18:39] your life they're not just laying there
[18:41] as good words
[18:42] and it's not a list because you know
[18:44] what that could be a new year's
[18:46] resolution
[18:49] if you make it that right
[18:51] but if you make it a life
[18:53] a life
[18:55] listen sometimes i wish to god
[18:57] me and dad's talked about this sometimes
[18:59] i wish i could walk into service
[19:01] 30 minutes after i was supposed to
[19:07] i'm looking at everybody
[19:11] if you got an office in this church you
[19:12] need to be 30 minutes before the service
[19:16] in your seat praying because people are
[19:18] looking at you
[19:19] if you don't have an office then guess
[19:21] what be like be like what i want to be i
[19:23] want to be little some little
[19:24] yeah be quiet yeah right me anyway i
[19:27] want to be some little wallflower that
[19:29] comes over here and sits down and just
[19:30] worships god and goes back home that
[19:32] would be really nice
[19:33] but i ain't built that way
[19:35] i ain't built for that
[19:37] and you shouldn't be built for that
[19:38] either especially those of you that have
[19:40] a
[19:41] have been elevated to a place that that
[19:44] people look up to you
[19:46] what would it be if brotherdale coming
[19:47] here 30 minutes after the service
[19:48] started
[19:50] he's here for where everybody is and
[19:52] he's 82 years old what's your problem
[19:56] well get quiet that's all right
[19:59] stay quiet if you want to but you know
[20:00] what that's iniquity you know to be here
[20:03] and you're not well i've got this when
[20:06] he read those quotes a few minutes ago
[20:07] did you see any list that exempted you
[20:10] [Music]
[20:12] from that iniquity
[20:14] there was no exemption bob did you leave
[20:16] that out
[20:18] no it just said if you know to do better
[20:20] and don't do it it's iniquity
[20:24] i'm telling you
[20:26] get in or get out
[20:32] but sometimes i do wish i could i could
[20:35] sit and and go fishing and go hunting
[20:37] and and never have to worry about
[20:39] getting a sermon and never have to worry
[20:40] about your spirituality and never have
[20:42] to worry about the building never have
[20:43] to worry about special meetings never
[20:45] have to worry about bringing preachers
[20:46] in
[20:49] and i still do
[20:52] four or five jobs anyway so but i'm
[20:54] built for it i can do it
[20:56] i don't mind
[20:57] but sometimes it'd be nice to take a a
[20:59] brain vacation
[21:01] some of y'all have already checked out
[21:05] but the revelation of the son of god is
[21:07] is what we're talking about the new
[21:08] birth
[21:10] justification sanctification baptism of
[21:12] the holy ghost was the same in every
[21:14] church age it was just there was a
[21:16] requirement for this age a requirement
[21:18] for this age and requirement for this
[21:19] age everybody with me
[21:21] all right
[21:22] then
[21:23] in the end time
[21:25] we see up there at the very top
[21:27] that was done away with the son of man
[21:29] was rejected
[21:31] back 2 000 years ago by the religious
[21:34] world
[21:35] crucified by the religious world and
[21:38] turned against by the religious world
[21:41] so brother ranum had to come
[21:44] to bring back the
[21:46] what the foundation
[21:48] but then teach us about the son of man
[21:50] god in human flesh
[21:52] that's what we'll talk about a little
[21:53] bit later but remember this god
[21:56] is not here at the moment
[21:58] physically in his form
[22:01] as he was 2 000 years ago he has left
[22:05] and came back to get into your flesh and
[22:08] to let your flesh do what the son of man
[22:11] did amen
[22:13] that's a requirement in this age
[22:15] luke 17 30.
[22:20] malcolm 4.
[22:21] you ever heard any of the inscriptions
[22:24] we got message believers here today
[22:25] don't we
[22:26] all right just want to make sure we
[22:27] didn't have a different crowd
[22:29] but the son of man revelation is
[22:31] different
[22:33] because it it contains a body change it
[22:35] contains knowing listen they didn't know
[22:38] so much about the mystery of iniquity
[22:39] during the church ages because they
[22:41] still
[22:42] by ignorance baptized in the name of
[22:44] father son holy ghost believed in a
[22:46] trinitarian doctrine believed in eternal
[22:48] hell believed all these things miracles
[22:50] were passed or gone and done away with
[22:54] that was what was eroded through the
[22:55] church ages even
[22:57] even
[22:58] the people that had the holy ghost
[23:02] everybody with me
[23:04] martin luther had the baptism of the
[23:05] holy ghost in his soul church age
[23:08] messenger that god used him
[23:11] to get the message to the people
[23:14] yet he was a trinitarian
[23:16] yet he baptized the name of father's
[23:17] only go holy ghost see he didn't get all
[23:19] the way out the prophet of god said in
[23:20] other words he didn't he got out of the
[23:22] catholic church but he didn't get all
[23:24] the catholic church out of him
[23:26] there was still some in there
[23:29] but now when the prophet of god comes he
[23:31] separates and it says look that's the
[23:34] mystery of iniquity
[23:35] that's knowing to do better that's why
[23:37] he would preach to those people he said
[23:39] you pentecostal women he said you get
[23:41] worse every year he was preaching the
[23:43] message of the hour he was preaching the
[23:46] bible
[23:48] and they were rejecting it
[23:54] but that's the son of man revelation so
[23:56] now
[23:57] that's why we've got all that but we
[23:58] want to change it back to number two and
[24:01] we want to go back down because i think
[24:03] we run away from there was a lot of
[24:05] questions that were asked
[24:07] because i jumped on up to the son of man
[24:08] and we should have stayed down here
[24:10] let's go to number two
[24:13] um
[24:14] brother anderson
[24:16] i want to thank brother anderson he has
[24:17] done a
[24:18] an outstanding job
[24:20] him and brother richard brother joe
[24:23] uh for bob the different ones
[24:26] we need to give them
[24:28] give them a big atta boy because uh
[24:31] that's a lot they do back there they
[24:32] don't listen to a lot of sermons i'm
[24:34] serious
[24:35] they have to either re-listen or or
[24:37] something because they're not they're
[24:39] back there working
[24:41] so what so you can sit here
[24:44] and listen
[24:45] and soak it in
[24:47] all right
[24:49] so here now we've come back to the
[24:51] bottom and that's what we're talking
[24:52] about right here for his men's are led
[24:53] by the spirit of god they are the sons
[24:55] of god now listen you're not a son of
[24:56] god and justification you're not a son
[24:58] of god of sanctification you are son of
[25:00] god at the baptism of the holy ghost
[25:02] that's when god takes the old nature out
[25:05] and puts the new nature in we've been
[25:07] talking about that for a few weeks
[25:10] for you ever not received the spirit of
[25:11] bondage again to fear but you have
[25:12] received the spirit of adoption now the
[25:14] spirit of adoption gets you started just
[25:16] like a baby
[25:18] and then you have to grow up to that
[25:20] other chart that we were at where you
[25:21] saw the full grown man
[25:23] inside that chart but that's what's
[25:25] required that we get to that in this
[25:27] church age
[25:28] wasn't required
[25:30] listen in the fourth church age if you
[25:32] just got to right there at the baptism
[25:34] of the holy ghost you didn't live very
[25:36] long
[25:38] 68 million got martyred just by saying
[25:41] that they're son and daughter of god
[25:45] but that was their age that was their
[25:47] box that was their spirit the anointing
[25:49] that they were under but you and i have
[25:51] to use thank god
[25:53] we use all seven anointings to get by
[25:56] pressures of this age everything that we
[25:58] got we used all seven
[26:02] church ages and their characteristics
[26:04] just to get through this time
[26:07] i mean folks listen it's a it's an
[26:09] honest fact
[26:11] that they're going to ask you we're
[26:13] going to be the most
[26:14] questioned people when we get to the
[26:16] other side
[26:20] how'd you make it
[26:22] we saw your age it was dark it was dark
[26:26] we couldn't see anything any hope any
[26:29] light
[26:30] there was nothing we could see we were
[26:32] just trying to fight through our age but
[26:34] man you've got not just a little devil
[26:37] you've got big devils
[26:39] 200 000 000 demons were released the
[26:41] prophet of god said the bible says on
[26:43] the bride
[26:45] well who's the bride us
[26:48] so you have to start at the bottom with
[26:50] faith but we're going to start with
[26:52] justification sanctification and then
[26:54] head to the baptism of holy ghost and i
[26:56] want to um
[26:57] to comment a little bit you know we talk
[26:59] about
[27:00] i'll talk about
[27:01] when i get finished in just a second we
[27:03] talk about a marriage
[27:05] and i was looking at yesterday
[27:08] you know we we said well a marriage
[27:10] when we marry jesus christ then we're
[27:12] born again well that's okay but let's
[27:14] back up just a little bit because you
[27:16] know what in that in that marriage
[27:19] journey
[27:21] lily zach
[27:23] in that marriage journey
[27:26] they're stages
[27:30] even though you jump up today and run to
[27:32] the just of the peace don't you even try
[27:33] it
[27:35] and get married there's a yeah
[27:38] that's right
[27:40] even though there's a journey to get
[27:41] there
[27:45] there's a
[27:46] journey and we'll talk about it in just
[27:48] a minute but let's get through this
[27:49] right here but we have received the
[27:51] spirit of adoption so who have you
[27:53] received we were talking about last
[27:54] sunday we'll look at in just a minute
[27:56] and sanctification you get a new spirit
[27:58] but you don't get the holy spirit
[28:00] you get a new spirit so that you can
[28:02] what contact god with and that you can
[28:04] live with yourself with
[28:06] now we're going to put that in the
[28:07] marriage valve so hang on just a second
[28:10] spirit itself bearing with hello
[28:11] somebody spirit itself bear witness with
[28:13] our spirit that we are the children of
[28:16] god
[28:19] children of god we all got to start as a
[28:21] baby
[28:22] look we saw most of you even even
[28:26] the twins were born in the church and i
[28:28] think zach wasn't but
[28:30] um esther was right
[28:32] that was here
[28:34] how old are you
[28:36] shut up
[28:40] but now he's not a baby now he's fixing
[28:42] to get married he's moved on he he's
[28:44] what he's come to a knowledge
[28:46] that he don't want to live his life by
[28:47] himself
[28:51] he's found a good woman a good lady good
[28:53] sister
[28:54] thank god
[28:56] amen
[28:59] but he started out as a baby
[29:01] we all started as babies and now we're
[29:03] grown up supposed to be grown up but if
[29:06] children than heirs because remember
[29:08] when you become a child of god even in
[29:10] the infant stage you're a son and
[29:13] daughter of god
[29:14] when this baby i'm going to talk about
[29:16] when this union comes of this marriage
[29:18] when a baby's born regardless if it
[29:21] lives two minutes it's still the son and
[29:25] daughter of who produced it
[29:29] amen
[29:30] everybody with me
[29:33] so that's what we're going to start with
[29:34] here in just a second if children then
[29:35] air so we're that child is an heir
[29:39] because he's part of the family so
[29:41] you're an heir right as you're as you're
[29:43] a child because i told you before in all
[29:45] of my journey and your journey too when
[29:47] we first come to the lord the lord was
[29:49] so gracious and just pouring out a
[29:51] blessing upon us he pour out a blessing
[29:53] you'd ask him something man you'd get it
[29:55] right there
[29:57] not now
[29:59] he asked for something now and he says
[30:01] wait a while
[30:03] i don't think you can handle it yet
[30:07] remember god's nose are the best yeses
[30:08] you'll ever get right because he knows
[30:11] you'll mess it up if he gives it to you
[30:13] so thank god i'm
[30:15] uh i know the bible tells us if if and
[30:17] then if we don't have troubles and
[30:18] trials we're bastard children so we're
[30:20] going to have troubles and trials even
[30:22] when god gives you something all right
[30:23] so let's look at justification but
[30:27] oh heirs and join us for christ if so be
[30:29] that we suffer with him that may be also
[30:30] be glorified so if you come to the
[30:31] baptism of the holy ghost and you get
[30:33] the new birth in your soul you are going
[30:35] to come to a glorified condition
[30:39] you may have to die and go by the grave
[30:42] or you may be standing as today we're
[30:44] standing alive and remain
[30:47] and we're going to be glorified on our
[30:50] two feet
[30:52] with not anything to do
[30:54] with death now see that's not
[30:57] here that's up there
[30:59] everybody with me that's why the
[31:00] headstone had to come
[31:02] it brought christ back to the earth to
[31:04] not just anoint your soul
[31:08] but anoint your spirit and your body
[31:10] all three
[31:11] and and we should want that
[31:15] when we get sick and tired of being sick
[31:17] and tired
[31:19] all right so justification let's go real
[31:21] quick romans 3 verse 24 is being
[31:23] justified freely by his grace through
[31:24] the redemption that is in christ jesus
[31:27] because remember
[31:29] we can't justify ourself
[31:31] has to be someone just
[31:34] to justify us
[31:36] we can't chop off our past life
[31:39] but god can chop off our past sins
[31:43] i mean chop it off in our brain now we
[31:45] don't go do that anymore or we didn't
[31:46] get justified
[31:48] when god has set forth to be who god has
[31:50] set forth to be a perpetuation what
[31:52] through faith
[31:54] in his blood to declare his
[31:56] righteousness for the remission of sins
[31:58] that are past not for future sins you
[32:00] can't get remission for sins you haven't
[32:02] done yet
[32:03] we're not catholics
[32:05] said before that's why the uh
[32:08] that's why the mob loved to be all were
[32:10] catholic
[32:11] they go in say 10 hail marys and say
[32:13] well i'm going to kill four people
[32:14] tomorrow night priest is going to say
[32:15] well okay here's some holy water go do
[32:17] what you need to do
[32:19] it was convenient for them
[32:21] that's not us though
[32:23] remission of sins that are passed and
[32:24] then what does he do he takes those sins
[32:26] of the past and he puts them in the sea
[32:28] of god's forgetfulness he doesn't
[32:30] remember any anymore because he has
[32:32] justified you
[32:34] all right
[32:35] he's justified you because you've come
[32:37] to a place that god i'm finished with my
[32:40] past life
[32:41] don't want to do this anymore don't want
[32:44] it to be a part of me anymore
[32:46] everybody with me
[32:48] sanctification matthew 12 43 says when
[32:51] the unclean spirit is going out of a man
[32:53] he walketh through dry places seek his
[32:55] rest and find is none now i want you to
[32:57] look at this just for one second just
[32:59] i'm gonna put a big like paul paul would
[33:01] make a point and then there's a
[33:03] parenthesis in the interpolates for
[33:04] about four four verses then he gets back
[33:07] on his subject so i'm going to
[33:08] interpolate for about five minutes here
[33:12] this is in your soul
[33:15] everybody with me
[33:16] under sanctification right there that is
[33:19] the unclean spirit going out of your
[33:20] soul
[33:24] but now when we get to the
[33:25] sanctification in the pyramid
[33:28] that's not in your soul that's those
[33:31] demons that are in your spirit realm
[33:34] because if you're born again he can't be
[33:36] in the inner man he has to start working
[33:39] on the next guy
[33:41] the spirit realm
[33:43] so everybody with me so remember that
[33:45] when we get to it there is a stage of
[33:48] this scripture scripture has compound
[33:50] meaning right
[33:51] so when an unclean spirit has gone out
[33:52] of a man he walketh through dry places
[33:54] secret rest find us none then he said i
[33:56] will return into my house from whence i
[33:58] came out and when he has come he finds
[33:59] it empty
[34:01] swept and garnished
[34:02] then go ahead and taketh himself seven
[34:04] other spirits more wicked than himself
[34:06] and then what is that that's what
[34:08] brother bible told me that's the
[34:09] iniquity part
[34:12] he comes back into your soul
[34:14] because you let him back in he comes
[34:17] back into your soul
[34:18] and then what the last state of that man
[34:21] is worse than the first because now he
[34:23] don't have but one he had one demon now
[34:24] he's got eight of them seven plus him
[34:27] that's inside your soul and making you
[34:29] just as happy and setting a message
[34:31] church and my hair is long my dress is
[34:33] long somebody all need to work on that
[34:36] and then
[34:38] i'm
[34:39] saved
[34:41] uh be careful
[34:43] it's when the word is quickened in your
[34:46] heart
[34:48] when the word of this hour is quickened
[34:51] in your heart and you don't deny it
[34:54] or walk away from it you can't walk away
[34:57] from this word of god and be born again
[35:00] call this word to word
[35:05] then go ahead and take it seven other
[35:06] spirits more wicked than they enter and
[35:08] what dwell there
[35:11] i don't want no demons to dwell in me
[35:15] spirit our soul
[35:17] amen
[35:18] but thank god though if we take this by
[35:20] stages in the new birth when we get to
[35:22] in just a second in the new birth that's
[35:25] what burns that old dynamic nature off
[35:27] of you doesn't kill your soul we don't
[35:30] believe in two souls
[35:31] we don't believe in having three or four
[35:33] you got one that god gave you when you
[35:35] were born
[35:36] and by the adamic nature by your by your
[35:39] carnal mind when you get 12 or 13 or 14
[35:42] years old the age of accountability
[35:44] satan starts working on that and he's
[35:47] got right here look what it says
[35:49] my house
[35:51] right here i will return into my house
[35:54] because you were born in sin you were
[35:55] born wrong
[35:57] if you're born wrong then guess what you
[35:59] got to get right somewhere
[36:02] if you want to get born again
[36:05] everybody with me
[36:07] the state of the person is what more
[36:08] worse than the first that's what brother
[36:10] the mystery of inequity iniquity brother
[36:12] brown said was a hideous sin not just
[36:14] saying a hideous sin because you're
[36:15] looking right at it you look right down
[36:17] at the bible and it tells you to be a
[36:19] church on sunday and wednesday read the
[36:20] bible it tells you not to do this not to
[36:22] do that
[36:25] i want y'all to listen something real
[36:26] quick i'm gonna make a
[36:28] make a point
[36:30] everybody loves grace
[36:32] hey man
[36:33] do you know what grace really is
[36:35] in simple layman terms
[36:39] there's a law of god
[36:41] that you got to go by
[36:43] everybody with me
[36:45] he has a law he has 10 commandments he's
[36:47] got the numbers deuteronomy even in
[36:49] matthew mark luke and john
[36:51] all right everybody wake up and listen
[36:52] for a minute matthew mark luke and john
[36:55] you've got all you've got all this
[36:59] do's and don'ts
[37:01] all right now
[37:03] you know how that works
[37:05] because remember god can't change his
[37:06] word
[37:08] he can't make exceptions
[37:11] unless he makes them
[37:13] everybody with me
[37:15] all right so we're going to go down here
[37:16] today and we're going to get on this
[37:17] road and we're going to go all the way
[37:19] down to that four-way stop
[37:21] right there in the middle of town we're
[37:22] familiar with it all of us pretty much
[37:25] now if there's a cop sitting there
[37:28] and we decide to roll through it
[37:32] you have come under the law
[37:35] and you're going to meet that law
[37:37] he's going to be in your window going
[37:42] i need to see your license and
[37:43] registration please
[37:45] right because you broke the law
[37:48] everybody with me on that
[37:49] you broke the law
[37:51] all right now what is grace
[37:53] now if if we have a parade
[37:57] or a an extra circumstance a a funeral
[38:02] everybody with me if that cop standing
[38:05] there at that four-way stop and he's
[38:07] doing this
[38:10] that stop sign goes out of existence
[38:14] because the man with the power of the
[38:16] law
[38:17] is saying you can come on by
[38:19] how many times you've been at a traffic
[38:20] light and you've stopped to the traffic
[38:21] light
[38:22] and you know better than to go into that
[38:24] traffic light because number one you're
[38:25] gonna get hit probably and number two a
[38:27] cop or something or now they just take
[38:29] your picture and send you a bill
[38:32] oh how do you all know that
[38:35] so anyway um confession time good for
[38:37] the soul
[38:39] but there's your stop sign and you're
[38:40] stan you're at the stop sign and listen
[38:42] it turns green you get ready to go but
[38:44] there's a cop standing there because
[38:45] there's a funeral procession going
[38:47] through
[38:48] or there's a parade going through now
[38:50] you have full right
[38:52] by that law
[38:54] to go
[38:55] but somebody is stopping you with an
[38:58] extra special circumstance
[39:02] but now remember though
[39:04] you know what greasy grace is
[39:07] greasy gracious said well shoot if i if
[39:09] i could go under it one time i'd just go
[39:12] under it again
[39:13] no that's greasy grave
[39:15] because when you when that circumstance
[39:17] leaves you guys still stop at the stop
[39:20] sign same way up here then i'm going to
[39:22] take it down but that's what god done
[39:24] god stood and he intermediated he he
[39:27] stood for you and said i know you got
[39:30] into trouble come on somebody i know you
[39:32] got into trouble i didn't let you but i
[39:35] didn't make you but i knew you would
[39:37] and i made a law that made sure you
[39:40] didn't go through that stop sign every
[39:42] time
[39:44] but the circumstances changed the guy
[39:47] that wrote the law is standing at the
[39:50] intersection he's going i know you
[39:52] didn't mean to do that come on through
[39:56] oh that's great
[39:58] to me that's the greatest that's a just
[40:00] a lamest term example of grace
[40:04] but listen remember like i said before
[40:06] don't go down here and go through it
[40:07] again
[40:08] when there's not a circumstance
[40:11] that the person that wrote the law
[40:13] standing there
[40:14] that's greasy grace greasy grace is well
[40:16] i got by with the first time i'll get by
[40:18] with again
[40:19] now you know what god's always had
[40:20] cameras up
[40:25] every move you make
[40:27] you think man's got cameras
[40:30] god's been on wi-fi for
[40:32] millions of years
[40:33] he hasn't needed a he hasn't needed a
[40:36] string or or a plug-in or anything he
[40:39] doesn't need any of that
[40:40] he's the master of the internet
[40:44] google ain't got nothing on my god
[40:46] amen
[40:48] because you know what he told us i'm
[40:49] gonna read you the scripture in a little
[40:50] while if i get to it that he said if he
[40:52] when he gave you the holy ghost he'd
[40:53] bring things you'll remember
[40:56] what do we do if we don't get our
[40:57] remembers we go
[40:59] google
[41:01] oh okay
[41:02] but not with god
[41:05] but listen second timothy nevertheless
[41:06] the foundation of god standeth sure
[41:09] having this seal
[41:11] the lord knoweth them that are his
[41:14] and let everyone that nameth the name of
[41:16] christ depart from iniquity you didn't
[41:18] read that one this morning bob you
[41:20] missed one
[41:21] but in a great house
[41:23] he's only got 30 minutes guys okay but
[41:26] in a great house there are not only
[41:27] vessels of gold and silver but wood and
[41:29] earth
[41:30] we talked about the potters last time to
[41:34] honor some to dishonor if a man
[41:35] therefore purge himself from these he
[41:37] shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified
[41:40] this is somebody that's got getting the
[41:42] iniquity out
[41:43] this is the person that's saying i don't
[41:45] want to live that life anymore i don't
[41:47] want to do what i used to do anymore i
[41:50] want god to take over in my life and him
[41:53] be the first one i ask not everybody
[41:56] else
[41:57] sanctified in meat for the what for the
[42:00] master's use remember sanctification is
[42:03] clean and set aside for service not put
[42:06] in service yet because god's not going
[42:08] to use you until he's got you all
[42:09] cleaned up and got his spirit inside of
[42:11] you
[42:12] because that's the control factor
[42:14] sanctify the meat from the masters used
[42:16] and what prepared
[42:18] unto every
[42:20] good work
[42:22] we were reading i just
[42:24] everybody knows jesus this carrot was
[42:26] justified by faith he was even
[42:27] sanctified
[42:30] so there's judah says carrot
[42:32] preaching the gospel
[42:34] casting out devils
[42:36] healing the sick
[42:40] his soul was black as such
[42:44] and you know what he done he made a
[42:45] decision to turn against the lord and he
[42:47] couldn't go back
[42:48] his iniquity carried him to a tree
[42:51] and he hung himself
[42:53] all right sanctification he gave you a
[42:55] new spirit now that spirit isn't god's
[42:57] spirit that's your spirit
[42:59] god gives you a new spirit then he says
[43:00] i'll put my spirit in you
[43:03] but the thing god has to do is give you
[43:05] a new spirit make your nature a little
[43:07] more gentle and settle down
[43:09] or he couldn't even live with you so he
[43:10] has to get you fixed up first
[43:13] before he can come in i'll give you a
[43:15] new spirit then you take him anyway
[43:16] anywhere you go all kinds of places
[43:20] he's got to get you fixed up so you can
[43:22] entertain him right
[43:24] today we're entertaining god
[43:27] everybody all right with that
[43:29] amen
[43:31] you come to get something from god yes
[43:32] we came to get something from god
[43:36] how do we entertain god we worship
[43:38] him he's our author he's our creator
[43:41] he's one he gives us everything he gives
[43:43] us the breath that we're breathing right
[43:44] now whether we deserve it or not
[43:47] because the whole world's doing that
[43:48] right now
[43:49] they're breathing under god's
[43:52] privilege of being a human being so
[43:55] that's when you're on the first one your
[43:57] first altar but when you hide away
[43:59] get his spirit
[44:01] then the holy spirit none other than god
[44:03] himself comes and dwells in you and then
[44:06] there's something about you the neighbor
[44:08] loves you the people likes you now let's
[44:10] get to the baptism of holy ghost is what
[44:11] we were talking about
[44:13] last week we'll talk a little bit more
[44:16] but i want you to realize
[44:19] it's not just a baptism of the holy
[44:20] ghost it's the new birth
[44:23] because remember there is kind of a
[44:24] little difference to that
[44:26] because you can have the baptism of the
[44:27] holy ghost every day on your on your
[44:29] spirit and die and go to hell that's you
[44:31] just saw the quote
[44:33] but you can't have the new birth in your
[44:36] soul because see you
[44:38] new birth doesn't
[44:40] listen to me real
[44:41] just listen the new birth doesn't affect
[44:43] your body
[44:45] the new birth doesn't affect your spirit
[44:48] sure it does when you get inside but
[44:50] listen if you don't get a new birth
[44:53] no you're still looking at the first one
[44:56] but god made what he made
[44:58] grace
[44:59] to give you a new birth in your soul
[45:02] where it matters
[45:04] that's where it matters that it's down
[45:05] in the inside the inside
[45:07] he can't give you a new birth on your
[45:09] spirit realm he's got to give you a new
[45:11] birth in your soul because what comes
[45:14] forth listen we'll talk about just a
[45:16] second you can have a child and and god
[45:19] forbid
[45:20] if no spirit goes into it that's not a
[45:22] human being
[45:24] sorry the prophet of god tells us it's
[45:27] wiggling muscles just like an animal
[45:29] until god puts a soul inside that being
[45:33] then he becomes a person
[45:35] everybody with me
[45:37] so you can't then be born again in your
[45:39] spirit
[45:40] you've got to be born again in your soul
[45:43] and only god can do that see you have
[45:46] purified your souls and what how can you
[45:48] purify your soul
[45:54] in obeying the truth
[45:56] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[45:58] of the brethren see that you love one
[45:59] another with a pure heart
[46:01] fervently
[46:03] being born again not of corruptible seed
[46:05] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[46:08] which liveth and by this forever
[46:11] for all fleshes is grass and all glory
[46:12] man's a flower of grass the grass
[46:14] withered the flower therefore falleth
[46:16] away but the word of god
[46:18] the word of the lord didn't do it
[46:19] forever this is the word which the
[46:21] gospel which i preach
[46:23] unto you now let's look at marriage just
[46:24] for a minute is everybody okay just kind
[46:26] of coast for a second here all right
[46:32] now take all away all the being married
[46:34] to christ and be in the bride and let's
[46:35] just let's just break it down
[46:38] when you come to justified condition
[46:40] what does that do
[46:42] think with me a minute justification
[46:44] chops off your past sins chops off your
[46:47] past life
[46:48] everybody with me all right i'm gonna
[46:50] slow down just a second all right
[46:52] now
[46:54] in justification what are you doing
[46:56] you're getting your chat ch your sins
[46:57] chopped off what are you doing when you
[46:59] say
[47:00] will you marry me
[47:02] that's what you did right
[47:04] and since y'all fixing to get married
[47:05] i'm thinking y'all for example because
[47:07] everybody all we've been married all 40
[47:08] 50 80 years and y'all fixin to jump into
[47:11] this thing called marriage is that okay
[47:14] you're not gonna paint on me are you
[47:15] okay i know lily's not i know but zach
[47:18] might
[47:20] but you might have vowed to each other
[47:22] right now what did you vow
[47:25] you vowed to get rid of your past life
[47:29] you vowed to get rid of those old
[47:31] boyfriends no more old boyfriends
[47:32] anymore not going back to those places i
[47:34] used to go
[47:37] everybody with me
[47:39] you vowed a vow
[47:41] to god
[47:43] that you're not going to do what you
[47:45] used to do and now god is so gracious he
[47:48] can wipe that away now me and you've got
[47:50] to deal with it sorry we're humans we're
[47:53] in our brain or in other words we can't
[47:55] chop off and say i never did that you
[47:58] can't do that in your natural flesh
[48:00] only in your soul can god wipe that away
[48:03] everybody with me
[48:04] so in your marriage you make a vow and
[48:07] when i come to justification i vow to
[48:09] god look god i'm going to come to church
[48:11] i'm going to get myself around somebody
[48:16] of light precious faith i'm not going to
[48:18] go back to that place i used to be
[48:21] so when you vow a vow when june and i
[48:23] made a vow i didn't go keep running
[48:25] around all over the place hello somebody
[48:28] i vowed myself to her
[48:31] and god vows itself to you in
[48:34] justification
[48:37] he says if you'll continue if you'll not
[48:39] break your vow i'll not break mine
[48:42] because i promise you i'm not going to
[48:44] break mine you might break yours but i'm
[48:45] not going to break mine
[48:47] that's why justification unclean spirit
[48:48] goes out but you still have that same
[48:50] desire
[48:52] oh
[48:52] [Music]
[48:54] it's hard to change in 15 minutes
[48:58] especially when you got that old i want
[49:00] to go out i want to be with my friends
[49:02] that's why marriages don't last
[49:05] now they do more in the message but they
[49:07] don't last because you don't sit there
[49:08] and talk about it
[49:10] enough
[49:11] to get to know each other
[49:13] so when did i get to learn to know god
[49:16] not at the baptism of the holy ghost
[49:19] no why wait that long
[49:21] get to know each other now y'all
[49:23] spending more time together than you
[49:24] used to right
[49:26] i mean talking and oh i love you
[49:31] right
[49:32] it's a love affair listen even in
[49:33] justification it's a love of love affair
[49:35] between you and god
[49:36] because those who he's justified he's
[49:38] already glorified god knows whether
[49:39] you're going to continue on or not you
[49:41] don't but if you'll stay in that same
[49:44] channel stay in that furrow stay in that
[49:47] road
[49:48] even with god god i want you to marry me
[49:50] so bad he'll say well stop going to the
[49:53] bar
[49:54] stop going to those friends
[49:57] stop watching that on tv stop reading
[49:59] that book
[50:04] because they're getting ready
[50:06] to be joined
[50:08] and you're joining two people
[50:10] actually you're joining two families
[50:13] family of god
[50:14] and family on earth
[50:17] everybody with me we're talking in
[50:18] layers here i want you to look at your
[50:19] natural marriage
[50:21] so in justification then
[50:23] all your past is gone now what's
[50:26] sanctification in your marriage you're
[50:27] not married yet
[50:29] but as you get closer to that day
[50:31] that you're going to get married what do
[50:33] you do
[50:35] i just read it to you the unclean spirit
[50:37] goes out but now i'm not talking about
[50:38] that as far as natural but you do talk
[50:41] to each other
[50:43] you converse
[50:45] i want to confess
[50:47] that i've got this problem
[50:48] i want to confess and i want to get this
[50:50] what this demon out
[50:53] i was just reading in there where
[50:54] brother brown was talking about if a
[50:55] woman vows a vow it doesn't tell her
[50:56] husband everything or he don't tell her
[50:57] everything then the vows the vows been
[51:00] what
[51:01] don't wait with
[51:02] it's a false vow
[51:04] a lot of people have made a false vow to
[51:06] god and they don't even get born again
[51:09] they don't even come into the covenant
[51:11] of marriage
[51:13] because listen why
[51:16] one more time
[51:18] all y'all know what i said about marion
[51:23] you don't marry
[51:25] for love
[51:27] at first
[51:29] because you don't know that pray i don't
[51:30] care if you've been dating for two years
[51:33] hey some things i found out about june
[51:35] after we've been dating for a year and a
[51:36] half
[51:38] something good
[51:40] some bad
[51:41] same way with me
[51:44] the same way with all of us
[51:47] yeah brother john durant's going she's
[51:50] making sure alicia doesn't see it
[51:55] but no listen what is the main problem
[51:58] with marriage you're not open enough
[52:01] you're just not open commitment what's
[52:02] the first thing i do when i get mad i
[52:05] shut up
[52:06] y'all don't believe that
[52:08] she's there she but see we're intimate
[52:10] we know each other
[52:12] right
[52:13] i just be quiet
[52:15] and she does too until until she like a
[52:17] pressure cooker
[52:22] but that's getting to know your spouse
[52:24] that's getting to know god in your walk
[52:27] justification chop off it i'm not doing
[52:29] that no more honey it's just you
[52:32] you and you and nobody else
[52:36] you're sweating
[52:39] you're it you and nobody else
[52:42] isn't that right what do you do though
[52:44] when you get when you come into a
[52:45] justified condition you get what you get
[52:47] mule blinders on you don't go looking at
[52:50] all this other stuff you've got only one
[52:52] thing on your mind
[52:54] my darling that i'm fixing to intimately
[52:56] know
[52:58] i want to intimately know
[53:03] and you start off your marriage
[53:04] with a little bit of lust
[53:07] sorry that's the way it is
[53:09] because true love is knowing all knowing
[53:11] everything
[53:12] and true love is what a development and
[53:14] i'm talking about i'm talking about
[53:15] feeling love but listen i got below the
[53:17] same way on our side
[53:18] what i was thinking about on our side we
[53:20] just don't jump up and get the new birth
[53:22] and everything's here i just told you
[53:23] you were a child
[53:25] you're a baby
[53:26] you don't understand everything but if
[53:28] there's no surprises listen god's not
[53:31] going to give you any surprises you
[53:33] might give him some but it ain't going
[53:35] to surprise him either because he knows
[53:36] it too
[53:40] that's why he'll only give you the new
[53:41] birth if he knows you're going to take
[53:42] it and use it and can go with it
[53:47] but being married sometimes
[53:50] we don't talk
[53:52] before the marriage
[53:54] find out all the little intricacies and
[53:56] all the this and that and the other
[53:57] because you're going to find out a lot
[53:58] i'm telling you when you get married
[54:00] it's like
[54:00] like the guy said one time you know the
[54:02] mother-in-law looks at the sun and says
[54:04] he says i i can't stand her no more i'm
[54:06] gonna get a divorce she said
[54:07] she said son she's just a nice girl
[54:10] she's really pretty she's a nice girl he
[54:11] said mama you don't have to live with
[54:13] her
[54:17] right
[54:17] because there's certain things you find
[54:19] out after you get married
[54:22] am i making any headway here so
[54:25] justification is chopping off your past
[54:27] sins it's chopping off everything and
[54:29] focusing on god
[54:31] because in sanctification what do you
[54:32] get you get a new spirit
[54:35] it's called your wife
[54:39] everybody with me
[54:41] it's called your wife because that's
[54:43] another person sitting there
[54:46] didn't i just read the whole brother
[54:48] brown said to entertain him
[54:50] you get a new spirit to entertain him
[54:53] the spou him the the bridegroom
[54:57] he's now got a bride to deal with
[55:00] and i don't mean it that way
[55:05] he's got a bride to deal with though and
[55:08] then what happens you start cutting off
[55:10] all the
[55:11] unclean spirits
[55:14] goes out
[55:15] start chopping it away
[55:17] you know for how long you've been dating
[55:19] a year and a half
[55:22] 11 months okay
[55:24] but when you first met each other what
[55:25] was it hey how are you doing fine i'm
[55:27] i'm you didn't know a thing about each
[55:29] other right
[55:30] see the only good thing about this
[55:31] relationship with god is he knows
[55:33] everything from the get-go
[55:36] but you got to confess it on this end
[55:39] or you're
[55:40] in iniquity
[55:42] so if you get all of it out all the
[55:44] unclean spirit goes out of a man
[55:49] don't let him back in
[55:52] because you're fixing to fill yourself
[55:54] with your spouse
[55:57] and i'm required to take care of her now
[56:01] i wasn't required to take care of her
[56:02] before
[56:03] i'm required to take care of her you're
[56:05] required to take care of your wife
[56:12] i promise you one thing i still believe
[56:14] the bible when it says how you treat
[56:16] your wife is how god's going to treat
[56:18] you i would not be
[56:20] in your shoes
[56:24] maybe that's the cause we got the
[56:25] problems that we got now
[56:28] am i good
[56:31] so in sanctification here we are we're
[56:33] we're not at the altar yet
[56:35] because remember what is the new birth
[56:37] the new birth is a coming together and a
[56:40] production
[56:41] of something
[56:43] everybody with me
[56:45] it's a union that's going to produce
[56:48] something
[56:51] it's going to produce children
[56:54] how did you get here
[56:57] a union between your mama and your daddy
[57:00] how did you get here spiritually a union
[57:03] between your mama which is the word and
[57:05] your daddy which is in heaven coming
[57:07] through that man right there
[57:09] brought a lot of y'all burst a lot of
[57:11] y'all into the body of christ from that
[57:13] man right there
[57:15] spiritual multiplication because of what
[57:18] a marriage
[57:19] but before you're married man you've got
[57:21] all these things that you
[57:24] am i right
[57:25] you worry about stuff that you didn't
[57:27] have to worry about
[57:28] same way when you come to sanctification
[57:31] when you're not even born again you're
[57:33] still getting to know god
[57:35] ain't that why i said it he'll give you
[57:36] a new spirit
[57:38] so that you can what welcome god and be
[57:40] able to live with yourself
[57:42] because you got another life coming in
[57:45] you got something coming in and god
[57:47] knows what he's doing but you don't
[57:50] thank god we got a husband that knows
[57:51] what he's doing we're floundering around
[57:53] down here still after 43 years jim
[57:56] shakes your head sometimes
[57:58] well once in a while once in the morning
[58:00] while in the afternoon
[58:02] it may
[58:04] but you know what we've done though
[58:06] we've accepted the challenge
[58:09] you two have accepted a challenge
[58:12] god accepts the challenge he wants a
[58:14] bride
[58:16] he wants somebody he can birth others
[58:18] from
[58:20] that's why it gives you the new birth
[58:21] that's why i read the scripture where it
[58:22] says you cannot know
[58:24] about what i'm talking about without
[58:26] jesus christ being in your soul without
[58:28] an intimate relationship with god you
[58:30] cannot understand because look i'm
[58:33] talking to these two they're getting
[58:34] ready to get married me and you know
[58:35] exactly what's going on bob and martin
[58:37] know exactly what's going on but
[58:38] michael's going what
[58:42] what
[58:44] what what y'all talking about because
[58:45] he's not married yet yet
[58:48] right
[58:50] because he he doesn't know what we're
[58:52] talking about
[58:53] just like you don't know what i'm
[58:54] talking about if you're not born again
[58:59] right
[59:00] because michael's sitting there going
[59:02] what do you mean i gotta
[59:04] i gotta understand that
[59:06] yeah you do
[59:08] and then you gotta keep her till you die
[59:18] the vow does stay till death do his part
[59:22] and that doesn't mean if you kill him
[59:24] that makes you a murderer
[59:26] and you don't go to heaven either
[59:28] so just be careful
[59:30] but everybody understand what i'm saying
[59:32] you you think about your courtship and
[59:33] you think about your courtship with then
[59:34] then if you're not born again go through
[59:37] that courtship that you were that you
[59:38] went through everybody has except for
[59:40] the ones that haven't got married yet
[59:41] everybody's went to a courtship thomas
[59:43] is going i still won't play basketball
[59:47] you know michael's not born again i mean
[59:49] it's okay
[59:51] right right you're born again you still
[59:53] want to play basketball but you got
[59:54] another life involved you got to ask
[59:57] your wife if you can go play basketball
[1:00:01] i used to go hunting all the time till i
[1:00:03] got married and i had to ask my wife who
[1:00:05] i could go well i kind of told her i'm
[1:00:07] sorry
[1:00:09] i know it's all good
[1:00:11] yeah i know i'm still i'm gonna get
[1:00:13] right you have nothing else to throw at
[1:00:15] me either so i'm gonna stand over here
[1:00:16] can't throw it away you thought we were
[1:00:17] talking to these girls
[1:00:19] but we understand each other but now
[1:00:21] listen
[1:00:22] once you get married
[1:00:25] there's two people coming together
[1:00:27] and you become intimate
[1:00:30] and everybody understands what i'm
[1:00:31] saying
[1:00:32] so i said
[1:00:33] try to preserve your body the best you
[1:00:35] can
[1:00:36] try to do the best you can
[1:00:38] because that would be so
[1:00:43] same way with you and god
[1:00:46] be a virgin
[1:00:48] be a virgin when you marry god
[1:00:50] not having all that filth that you got
[1:00:52] to
[1:00:53] ask forgiveness all the time because you
[1:00:55] know what even when you get mad you're
[1:00:57] gonna have to ask forgiveness again
[1:00:59] and again and again and again one more
[1:01:02] time again and again
[1:01:04] so you asking forgiveness is not over
[1:01:06] with
[1:01:08] but marriage is beautiful
[1:01:11] so when we come to the baptism of the
[1:01:12] holy ghost it's beautiful
[1:01:15] listen it revolutionized my life it
[1:01:17] doesn't matter if there was another
[1:01:19] spirit came in me
[1:01:21] because see it's not that new spirit
[1:01:23] it's the holy spirit
[1:01:24] so now he and i can be intimate because
[1:01:26] i'm his bride
[1:01:28] we can be intimate with god he'll let us
[1:01:30] in places that we never were you know
[1:01:32] you're not going to get in sister lena
[1:01:34] you're not going to get into a place and
[1:01:36] you say i'm married but you're not
[1:01:38] you got to prove that you're married
[1:01:41] wedding band of grace
[1:01:43] you got to prove you can get into a
[1:01:44] certain place listen
[1:01:46] let me just be honest i'm going to try
[1:01:48] to make this
[1:01:50] vanilla
[1:01:53] when i get married got married to june
[1:01:55] there wasn't another person in the room
[1:01:57] you understand what i'm saying
[1:01:59] everybody got me
[1:02:00] you didn't bri i didn't bring a visitor
[1:02:04] that's our problem
[1:02:05] we don't want to let go of the past we
[1:02:07] bring the visitors and we want god to be
[1:02:09] intimate with us and we still all got
[1:02:11] this and that and the other to deal with
[1:02:13] at sanctification
[1:02:16] everybody with me are you listening to
[1:02:17] what i'm saying am i making sense i just
[1:02:19] thought about this this morning i
[1:02:20] thought man it's just just like a
[1:02:22] marriage
[1:02:24] because now we look christ in the bride
[1:02:26] and all that's fine that's okay but you
[1:02:28] gotta get over here and get born again
[1:02:29] first
[1:02:32] you gotta be born again
[1:02:36] not a corruptible seed
[1:02:38] but of incorruptible seed
[1:02:40] but you really don't know about a
[1:02:41] marriage if you've never been married
[1:02:42] before
[1:02:43] but we got a heavenly father we've got a
[1:02:46] bridegroom
[1:02:47] that knows all about it
[1:02:49] and he knows whether you're going to
[1:02:50] stay the course
[1:02:52] but you know what it's sanctification
[1:02:54] even if he don't know if he knows you're
[1:02:55] not going to stay the course he'll let
[1:02:56] you continue on through sanctification
[1:03:01] but if you don't get it filled guess
[1:03:03] what's going to happen another husband's
[1:03:05] going to come back
[1:03:08] if you don't get sealed in
[1:03:13] sister regina's welcome to my home
[1:03:14] anytime she wants to
[1:03:16] well
[1:03:17] not exactly
[1:03:19] well now i say that you know why because
[1:03:20] she's not my wife but i can't say that
[1:03:22] to june
[1:03:24] it is her house
[1:03:26] right
[1:03:27] and lord please don't let regina and
[1:03:28] sister uh trudy get in your house trudy
[1:03:31] collins
[1:03:33] they'll make your power bill go up 100 a
[1:03:35] month
[1:03:38] come home one time thought my house was
[1:03:39] on fire and it was regina and i know
[1:03:41] they might have been scared of the dark
[1:03:42] but
[1:03:45] i could hear the meter spinning when i
[1:03:47] got out of the car
[1:03:49] i said turn these lights off you know
[1:03:51] what regina said i told her
[1:03:54] hitting at the devil and i told her
[1:03:58] isn't that what you said
[1:03:59] judy was like
[1:04:02] told me you know and here they go you
[1:04:04] know some demons arguing with each other
[1:04:05] you know what i mean them demons arguing
[1:04:07] with each other same way with us
[1:04:09] you bring something to light you bring
[1:04:12] something to light in your life and then
[1:04:14] demons go to fighting
[1:04:16] you know what just back off and let them
[1:04:17] fight
[1:04:18] let your husband take care of him
[1:04:20] because when my when the husband of that
[1:04:21] house walks in the door what'd i do i
[1:04:23] said y'all paying a power bill this
[1:04:24] month cut them lights off
[1:04:27] right
[1:04:28] good man of the house
[1:04:30] but remember
[1:04:32] if they would have done it in their
[1:04:33] house
[1:04:34] i couldn't have said anything
[1:04:36] because it's not my house
[1:04:38] that's why this vessel needs to be god's
[1:04:41] and when it's god's
[1:04:43] we reverence that house
[1:04:45] that's why we do the things of god
[1:04:47] that's why we don't cut our hair that's
[1:04:49] why we don't
[1:04:50] do the things we used to do it's not
[1:04:52] because it's written in the bible yes
[1:04:54] it's written in the bible
[1:04:56] but it's something we do out of love
[1:04:59] it's something we do out of love you
[1:05:01] don't know you never know a love for a
[1:05:02] woman unless you're married to one
[1:05:04] oh i've got this girlfriend well be
[1:05:06] careful
[1:05:08] unless you're intimately married
[1:05:10] and spend time
[1:05:12] you don't know that person
[1:05:15] y'all know what i'm talking about
[1:05:19] but once you come together and and and
[1:05:21] you work on this it's kind of like
[1:05:22] shonda pierce said the other day you
[1:05:24] know the the girl that's a comedian
[1:05:26] christian comedian she said you know she
[1:05:27] said when you first get married your
[1:05:29] husband's laying there and he goes
[1:05:31] she said that's kind of cute but 30
[1:05:33] years later
[1:05:34] get out of here get away from me
[1:05:38] what things change
[1:05:42] lily
[1:05:43] you got that to look forward to
[1:05:50] but now listen
[1:05:51] so the qualities
[1:05:54] i wrote myself a note the quirks the
[1:05:56] likes and the dislikes that's the
[1:05:58] unclean spirit in your relationship with
[1:05:59] your spouse all that's got to be pushed
[1:06:01] out because you know what it's two of
[1:06:03] you now it's not just me and it's my no
[1:06:07] two of you working together everybody
[1:06:08] with me on that all right same way with
[1:06:11] god we know who the husband is but
[1:06:12] listen we're a bride
[1:06:14] we've got to get ourself ready as the
[1:06:16] bible tells us amen we got to get
[1:06:19] ourself ready
[1:06:21] the five wise virgins were dressed and
[1:06:23] ready to go
[1:06:25] five foolish were two but the five wives
[1:06:27] had the holy ghost and they were getting
[1:06:29] ready to be intimate with their
[1:06:31] bridegroom
[1:06:34] the other five didn't know anything
[1:06:35] about that because
[1:06:37] they weren't ready
[1:06:40] to get intimate
[1:06:41] they thought they were close enough they
[1:06:43] went ahead and put all their garments on
[1:06:44] they already put there they had lamps
[1:06:46] too
[1:06:49] they just didn't have any oil
[1:06:51] they didn't go to the right place to get
[1:06:53] it
[1:06:55] but now listen just for a second then
[1:06:57] we'll close i'll pick the rest this up
[1:06:58] this afternoon this will be 42a and this
[1:07:01] afternoon will be 42b because i'm only
[1:07:02] down three quotes
[1:07:06] because look let me read this right here
[1:07:07] and then i'll make comment and then
[1:07:08] we'll close
[1:07:09] then in dispensation the fullness of
[1:07:11] times he might gather together and won
[1:07:12] all things in christ i'm not finished
[1:07:14] with the marriage yet hang on
[1:07:15] because there's got to be a consummation
[1:07:17] and at that consummation there's got to
[1:07:19] be a union and then there's got to be
[1:07:21] something that produces
[1:07:22] out of that
[1:07:24] one thing in christ both which are in
[1:07:25] heaven which on earth even in him and
[1:07:27] also we have obtained an inheritance
[1:07:29] being predestinated according to the
[1:07:30] purpose of him what our bridegroom who
[1:07:32] worketh all things after the council of
[1:07:34] his own will
[1:07:35] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:07:36] glory first trusted in christ and whom
[1:07:39] he also trusted after
[1:07:42] after you got married
[1:07:45] hello somebody
[1:07:48] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:07:50] also after that you believed you were
[1:07:52] sealed with that holy spirit of promise
[1:07:54] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:07:56] listen when you get married when when
[1:07:58] brother zach and sister lily gets
[1:08:00] married that's the earnest of their life
[1:08:03] it's a down payment they put a down
[1:08:04] payment that they're going to live
[1:08:05] together
[1:08:07] and then if there's going to be a a
[1:08:09] union then
[1:08:11] you can produce
[1:08:13] a child from that
[1:08:14] everybody with me on that
[1:08:16] i said you can i'm not
[1:08:18] i don't like this
[1:08:20] get married and get pregnant all at one
[1:08:21] time i just it just it just messes your
[1:08:23] life up a little bit so anyway god it's
[1:08:26] god's providence then that's okay
[1:08:28] you know like i said i'm not i'm not i'm
[1:08:30] i have a hard time being me i don't want
[1:08:32] to be god
[1:08:33] okay
[1:08:34] i have a hard time being me so i i'm not
[1:08:36] going to do that
[1:08:38] and stepping away but just be wise
[1:08:40] you know what
[1:08:42] talk about it
[1:08:44] talk about it
[1:08:47] okay
[1:08:50] not on the first date
[1:08:54] how many kids you want to have we all
[1:08:56] even had coffee yet
[1:09:00] watching all y'all watching you watching
[1:09:06] we're getting a life lesson but i told
[1:09:07] you
[1:09:08] a long time ago if you can't see your
[1:09:10] walk of god with god in your daily in
[1:09:13] your life from your baby all the way to
[1:09:15] now then you're meant you've missed it
[1:09:18] how simple is that if you've come from
[1:09:20] your baby drinking milk eating meat
[1:09:22] going through life
[1:09:25] you know like this
[1:09:27] of course mendel about 40. they're like
[1:09:30] but and but what but then you what then
[1:09:32] you turn your focus
[1:09:35] on one thing
[1:09:38] not all them old boyfriends and
[1:09:39] girlfriends not all them old places you
[1:09:40] went to
[1:09:41] there's somebody caught your attention
[1:09:44] oh he's a nice looking guy
[1:09:47] his word is true
[1:09:51] he's eternal
[1:09:54] he's beautiful
[1:09:56] he's the rose of sharon the lily is a
[1:09:58] valley
[1:09:59] he's a bright morning star
[1:10:01] he's good when i'm bad
[1:10:05] he's good when i'm bad
[1:10:09] he provides
[1:10:10] my needs
[1:10:13] i want to focus myself on that person
[1:10:16] because the world folks they see the
[1:10:18] husband
[1:10:20] of the world
[1:10:22] and they focus in their life on him
[1:10:24] debauchery lying stealing cheating
[1:10:27] whoring what name it
[1:10:30] right
[1:10:31] but something has turned me to see my
[1:10:33] lover
[1:10:34] to see the one i want to fall in love
[1:10:37] with because i got to get to know him
[1:10:38] first amen
[1:10:40] same way with all of us we got to know
[1:10:42] our spouse first before we fell in love
[1:10:44] with him i'm telling you i'm sorry
[1:10:45] that's exactly what happened
[1:10:50] same way with this right here that
[1:10:52] statue of perfect man is nothing more
[1:10:53] than your married life once you get
[1:10:55] married at the bottom that's your
[1:10:57] married life going through all the way
[1:10:59] to the headstone
[1:11:03] that all right
[1:11:05] even if we don't get the rest of this
[1:11:06] finish it's 11 52. but listen let's look
[1:11:09] at this though there's a union
[1:11:12] i wrote myself a note a union
[1:11:14] cleaned and set aside for service
[1:11:15] because you know what not playing with
[1:11:17] the world no more
[1:11:18] right
[1:11:20] you you focus like i said you focused on
[1:11:22] one person
[1:11:25] zach
[1:11:28] you're going to turn and look at her
[1:11:30] on the day you get married
[1:11:33] now i've never been to a wedding where
[1:11:35] they face away from each other
[1:11:37] right
[1:11:38] i've never been to one where they look
[1:11:40] at each other and go
[1:11:44] i don't know about that
[1:11:45] no you're going down the aisle going oh
[1:11:48] yeah
[1:11:49] finally
[1:11:52] all right he's the one
[1:11:56] i hope we did that
[1:11:59] i know some may have made it halfway
[1:12:01] down the altar and turn around
[1:12:03] but um usually when they get right up
[1:12:05] here they're standing in front of each
[1:12:08] other
[1:12:10] i couldn't tell you they said there was
[1:12:12] 200 and some people at my wedding back
[1:12:14] in 1978 and then blah blah blah i don't
[1:12:16] even remember who was in it
[1:12:19] i just remember that when they opened
[1:12:21] that door back there there come my bride
[1:12:25] and i want to be real honest with you i
[1:12:26] had a girlfriend sitting in the in the
[1:12:28] sanctuary
[1:12:31] jim knows that i mean
[1:12:33] but i wouldn't did i couldn't even
[1:12:35] remember their name
[1:12:38] i knew who she was though because she
[1:12:40] was fixing to come right here
[1:12:43] and we were getting ready to form a
[1:12:45] union
[1:12:46] we had cleaned ourselves up she had got
[1:12:48] herself ready
[1:12:51] but did they look at me when i came out
[1:12:53] with a preacher but charlie woodby was
[1:12:55] the preacher
[1:12:56] dad was my best man
[1:12:58] we all come out and
[1:13:00] there's not even any music
[1:13:02] jeffrey
[1:13:03] remember we came out yeah they didn't
[1:13:06] care about us
[1:13:07] they didn't care if we had anything on i
[1:13:08] told him i said look all these people
[1:13:10] are naked don't worry about it
[1:13:14] well he was about to fall i was holding
[1:13:15] him he was going like this
[1:13:18] i hope we all get drunk like that
[1:13:20] when we when we meet our spouse
[1:13:22] the holy ghost
[1:13:24] you can't stand up that's what makes
[1:13:26] when you get to the union when you get
[1:13:27] the holy ghost it'll make you wobble
[1:13:29] it made them wobble on the day of
[1:13:31] pentecost didn't it thought they was
[1:13:32] drunk
[1:13:33] but i told jeffrey i said don't worry
[1:13:35] son i said just pretend all these people
[1:13:37] are naked and you'll be fine
[1:13:38] well they happened to leave the
[1:13:39] microphone on while i said that so
[1:13:41] everybody in that methodist church heard
[1:13:43] it
[1:13:44] so anyway
[1:13:47] but they really i mean we come walking
[1:13:48] out and you know the people are kind of
[1:13:50] just sitting there they're going
[1:13:51] [Applause]
[1:13:54] but boy went out boom boom boom boom
[1:13:57] boom boom boom when that door open what
[1:13:59] happened
[1:14:02] is that not the song no
[1:14:05] i always thought it was dum dum dum dum
[1:14:07] dum dum dum anyway
[1:14:09] but what happened huh oh yeah exactly
[1:14:12] that's what i mean
[1:14:14] but when they started playing the
[1:14:16] wedding march what happened everybody
[1:14:18] gets up
[1:14:20] and they turn that way
[1:14:22] right
[1:14:23] because it was the bride's day
[1:14:26] the bride the groom they didn't care
[1:14:28] nothing about him
[1:14:30] they just knew that bride it was her day
[1:14:33] and there was going to be a union
[1:14:36] afterwards
[1:14:37] and that union sometimes
[1:14:40] produces a child so now let's go to the
[1:14:43] new birth
[1:14:44] everybody with me
[1:14:47] because when when a man and a wife gets
[1:14:49] together and
[1:14:50] they participate have a baby are they
[1:14:52] getting ready to have a baby and she
[1:14:54] says i'm pregnant
[1:14:56] what do you do
[1:14:59] you're expecting
[1:15:01] right
[1:15:02] you used to we couldn't even stay
[1:15:04] pregnant
[1:15:06] no you just said oh she's expecting
[1:15:08] expecting what
[1:15:11] but that's what it is you respect yeah
[1:15:14] in the family way
[1:15:15] you're expecting something to happen
[1:15:17] you're expecting that baby to come out
[1:15:20] you're expecting a birth
[1:15:23] when you get in that union with god
[1:15:24] you're expecting a birth
[1:15:27] you're expecting a new birth that you've
[1:15:29] never experienced before
[1:15:36] but remember
[1:15:39] the life doesn't go in that baby till
[1:15:40] it's born
[1:15:45] that's why
[1:15:46] we're children of god
[1:15:48] when we're born again
[1:15:51] sure we're potential in justification
[1:15:52] and sanctification but we can fall off
[1:15:54] we can turn around and run away we can
[1:15:56] we can end this wedding we can say i
[1:15:57] don't love you anymore there's something
[1:15:58] happen there's something going on
[1:16:00] because remember that's sora the seed
