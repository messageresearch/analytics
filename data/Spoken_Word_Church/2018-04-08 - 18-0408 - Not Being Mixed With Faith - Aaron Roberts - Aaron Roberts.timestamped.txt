[0:00] [Applause]
[0:04] always one more comes in god bless you
[0:08] this morning they said we'll look in
[0:12] Hebrews chapter forward
[0:19] I wanna thank everybody for prayers
[0:26] feeling better
[0:30] don't look however LF you learned the
[0:33] oldest thing in the belt I went to a
[0:35] fight and the hockey game broke out I
[0:41] thought it was basketball turning to
[0:43] football and I realized I was
[0:45] ill-prepared for that I tried not to
[1:04] leave an hour playing basketball and I
[1:07] tried to fall on top everyone jumping
[1:10] over him and my upper body was how fast
[1:13] my feet I couldn't keep my balance I'm
[1:15] calling sir said I should just fell only
[1:19] by he's younger he'd recover quicker we
[1:32] just thank the Lord for His healing
[1:33] power all the prayers still got a little
[1:37] bit but every day I go to work kind of
[1:41] work the soreness out everything getting
[1:44] better anyway Hebrews chapter 4 and
[1:48] verse 1 says let us therefore fear lest
[1:51] a promise being left us of entering into
[1:55] his rest any of you should should seem
[1:58] to come short of it for unto us was the
[2:01] gospel preached as well as unto them but
[2:04] the word preached did not profit them
[2:06] not being mixed with faith in them that
[2:08] heard it language have believed to enter
[2:13] arrest as he said as I have sworn my
[2:15] wrath if they shall enter in my wrath
[2:18] into my wrists
[2:19] although the works were finished from
[2:21] the foundation of the world for he spake
[2:24] in a certain place on the seventh day on
[2:27] this wise and God did rest the seventh
[2:30] day from all his works and in this place
[2:36] again if they shall enter into my rest
[2:40] sing therefore it remaineth that some
[2:44] must enter therein and they to whom it
[2:47] was first preached entered not in
[2:50] because of unbelief
[2:51] again he limited a certain day saying in
[2:55] David today after so long a time
[2:59] as it is said today if they will if you
[3:03] will hear his voice harden not your
[3:05] hearts for if Jesus had given them rest
[3:08] then would he not afterward have spoken
[3:11] of another day there remaineth therefore
[3:14] they rest to the people of God for he
[3:17] meant is entered into his rest he also
[3:20] has ceased from his own works as God did
[3:24] from his let us labor therefore to enter
[3:29] into that rest lest any man fall after
[3:32] the same example of unbelief for the
[3:35] word of God is quick and powerful and
[3:37] sharper than any two-edged sword
[3:38] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[3:41] soul and spirit and of the joints and
[3:44] marrow and is a discerner of the
[3:47] thoughts and intents of the heart
[3:50] so just we'll take a little quote from
[3:55] verse 2 but this whole whole section of
[4:01] scripture here hmm it's very good but I
[4:06] had written some things down and I've
[4:10] been looking at some things and I
[4:11] thought brother weeks Dunham I want I
[4:13] called him and told him I I know he
[4:15] doesn't wonderful
[4:16] and that was that was probably the more
[4:19] the best that I've ever heard him
[4:22] minister
[4:24] that's almost very time for you and well
[4:27] over some of the things that I have
[4:28] looked at and I had had little thought
[4:33] in my mind and one of the one of the
[4:38] things that come to me well brother
[4:41] Lewis was preaching was you know brother
[4:47] brems said she can't ever help anybody
[4:48] unless you have a burden for and you
[4:52] know you have to have a burden and you
[4:56] know I guess brother Lewis spent a lot
[4:58] of time talking about the young people
[4:59] talk about young people and one of the
[5:02] things that come to me because I was
[5:07] speaking to a young man who spent some
[5:09] time back but the the reason I want to
[5:15] talk about this this morning was I was
[5:19] speaking to a young man and you know
[5:23] this young man that had walked in in the
[5:29] light that he saw he said it was in the
[5:33] message so don't get that wrong but you
[5:36] know he went to the altar you know it
[5:40] gave his heart to God and you know
[5:44] you've been baptized but you know he'd
[5:46] never come to a place where he was at
[5:48] rest
[5:48] and the one thing that when we were
[5:52] talking was he told makes it he said I
[5:55] he said I could never take communion
[6:00] and because one of the things is because
[6:03] of the ministry and this is another
[6:07] thing that I'm gonna I'm gonna talk
[6:10] about this morning I'm so but you know
[6:12] he had been under such because of the
[6:14] preaching of the gospel and you know you
[6:17] have to have a balance in things because
[6:20] you know they have been preached so much
[6:23] that they've been under such
[6:24] condemnation that he said I'd never take
[6:26] communion because he said I'm not going
[6:29] to eat and drink damnation to myself can
[6:33] I talk my said well if you if you look
[6:34] at it that way
[6:35] I said none of us are perfect none of us
[6:38] are ever going to reach that place I
[6:40] said but it takes the grace of God but
[6:43] see that's the thing
[6:44] if weak as run they'll been preaching
[6:47] about you know the new birth brings a
[6:52] rest and you know we have to come to
[6:56] that place and you know that's what I
[7:00] talked about there was a in the
[7:01] scripture he lays out place there's a
[7:03] place of rest to come to that you can
[7:06] rest in that because you have to have
[7:08] that type post fit down you have to come
[7:12] to a place where you drive a stake down
[7:13] and said I know that I know that I know
[7:16] because it ain't never we're never gonna
[7:18] be perfect in this life you know I mean
[7:21] if we're looking for sinless perfection
[7:23] it will come you know because we're all
[7:26] we're always gonna have to fight this
[7:28] flesh but I thought you know brother
[7:31] Brown tells the story and there's many
[7:36] places but you know he pickups about the
[7:38] story about the mule the old brokedown
[7:41] wheel and it was you know he was born
[7:46] but he had a birthright and you know he
[7:49] said it didn't matter how the broke down
[7:51] the meal was or what condition the mule
[7:53] was in sitting on a lamb and said the
[7:58] priests never looked at the meal to look
[8:00] at his faults and failures but he looked
[8:03] at the that lamb the priests had to look
[8:07] at the lamb the lamb had to be part
[8:09] the Bible said the lamb and to be
[8:10] without blemish and I said if we look at
[8:13] ourselves we're always going to find
[8:15] fault the devil's always going to happen
[8:17] that's all the devil what you look at is
[8:20] look at you but I said if we come to a
[8:23] place that you have to come to a place
[8:25] and if we if we spend all our time and
[8:28] that's what I was trying to share with
[8:29] this young man you know if we can spend
[8:33] all our time looking at our faults and
[8:36] figures and what we can get in a get in
[8:38] a rut and you know the devil can beat on
[8:41] us and we'd never get anywhere but you
[8:44] know thing is this it's not how many
[8:46] times you fall down it's how we came to
[8:48] get up but you know the same word that
[8:53] brings condemnation also brings because
[8:55] the you know he talks about living in in
[8:58] condemnation but you know one of the
[9:03] things that I thought myself well the
[9:04] Bible says in Romans 8 it says there is
[9:07] therefore now no condemnation to them
[9:12] that are in Christ Jesus I said you know
[9:16] there is a condemnation and if we don't
[9:18] live right and inward and if we don't
[9:20] commit ourselves to God then yes there
[9:24] is condemnation and if we eat and drink
[9:26] unworthily at the lord's table then yes
[9:30] we can drink them nation to ourselves
[9:32] but the scripture tells us the scripture
[9:36] gives us the antidote he says but if
[9:38] we're judged of the Lord then we're
[9:40] chasing double as if we examine
[9:42] ourselves see that we don't go
[9:45] unworthily brother Bentham said in the
[9:47] message deserting the body of the Lord
[9:50] he said he makes us worthy we'll never
[9:53] be worthy if it wasn't for him he makes
[9:55] us worthy to do that and you know you
[10:00] know we see so many young people and you
[10:03] know you know that they're in this and
[10:08] this battle you know right
[10:11] sometimes we forget I've got one that's
[10:15] getting ready turn 13 this year but you
[10:21] know you you know it it becomes a battle
[10:26] and sometimes you know we forget what it
[10:29] was like to be teenagers because I see
[10:32] and you know it's a little different for
[10:35] boys and a little bit different you know
[10:37] for girls you know Sarah asked me
[10:40] sometimes she's but she's like she asked
[10:43] me about Lima because you know she
[10:45] didn't her little I mean her brothers
[10:47] are a lot older so she didn't grow up
[10:49] with teenage boys and I see Levi the
[10:52] things he does and the way he acts was
[10:56] like that was me that's me as I you know
[11:03] why don't you know whether you like it
[11:04] or not they're your children and they do
[11:07] the same things that you do whether you
[11:09] like it or not you know we try to stop
[11:13] them from and guess what it's just
[11:14] nature
[11:15] it comes out yes but you know he acts
[11:18] certain legs and does certain things and
[11:20] he's mom shakes or shakes their hand and
[11:22] he tries to figure out gr13 a Kansan
[11:25] that's way they let's talk about you
[11:30] earlier done a good job
[11:37] both sigh sidebar on this you know
[11:43] George Washington crossed a certain
[11:45] River
[11:49] he said Potomac Wednesday night it was
[11:52] actually the Delaware I talked about the
[11:56] weeks on the phone when I said I say
[11:59] don't know if you ever heard the story
[12:00] about the news editor man called and
[12:02] told about all the mistakes that was
[12:03] found in the newspaper the editor was
[12:06] unfazed then he called he said well you
[12:08] know what we try to fix something in our
[12:10] paper on everybody that's what we like
[12:12] to do so we're the land of Jing Fung has
[12:14] haven't found something in the paper
[12:16] that you enjoyed was finding the falls
[12:20] you know we always you know we always
[12:23] say things got a messed up on but if
[12:29] you're in the in the scripture you know
[12:33] it says that there was a promise left to
[12:37] us here brother Brent insists you know
[12:39] it's not that there wasn't a promise
[12:41] left us he said there was a promise left
[12:43] us he said but the next thing he said
[12:46] don't come short of it that was a
[12:48] promise promised to us in the work that
[12:51] we come to this rest you know it's not
[12:54] just not just the that's not just coming
[12:57] to rest but you know every divine
[12:59] promise of God in the scripture it's
[13:02] before us and we can come short of any
[13:06] of those you know he said the right
[13:09] mental attitude to any divine promise of
[13:12] God will bring it to pass the other
[13:14] thing is us we have to look at it the
[13:16] way that God looks at it because you
[13:21] know all through that all through the
[13:24] scripture you know when he's speaking
[13:28] speaking of the children of Israel and
[13:31] all the things that the children's well
[13:32] done you know God kept dealing with he
[13:37] kept pointing them out and telling them
[13:39] it's time to go it's time to go listen
[13:43] let's move on
[13:45] and you know they they didn't believe
[13:53] you know they've been when God told
[13:56] Abraham you know your your descendants
[14:00] your offspring them sojourn in a strange
[14:04] land and they'll be in bondage but you
[14:08] said I will bring an uncle come bring a
[14:10] deliverer and bring him out and you know
[14:15] they went down in there and they had got
[14:17] into that mindset of being in bondage
[14:20] for so long that you know that was their
[14:22] problem brother I said you know they
[14:23] couldn't get that mindset they were in
[14:26] bondage what was ever brought out
[14:27] they're still in bondage and didn't
[14:30] realize they were still in bondage and
[14:32] when he when he problem I'll chill
[14:34] brother I'm sitting was grace you know
[14:37] grace provided him a prophet and you
[14:42] know he said grace was what provided
[14:44] water from a rock and then that rock
[14:49] followed them all the way through the
[14:51] pillar of fire the cloud Monday you know
[14:56] the quail the man on all the different
[14:58] things that they've received and they
[15:02] couldn't see that the grace of God was
[15:04] following of all the mistakes they made
[15:08] of all the disbelieve all the murmurings
[15:10] all the complaining you know what God
[15:12] kept telling come on I've got a place
[15:14] for you here they here they were when
[15:18] even even when they were there and all
[15:20] of the things that they had to go
[15:22] through even even when you know when
[15:25] they all the murmurings and complainings
[15:27] and the fiery serpents come on and kill
[15:30] them and you know the brazen serpent God
[15:33] told told Moses to raise up the brazen
[15:35] serpent you know and said if they look
[15:37] on and believe they'd be healed of all
[15:39] the things they saw God do and even when
[15:43] they got to the promised land and they
[15:46] were ready to go in they sent the spies
[15:49] in to bring back the evidence
[15:53] and you know all the things God how many
[15:56] times could God prove to them it was
[16:00] continuous he was proven exactly what he
[16:03] said it this he never broke his covenant
[16:06] with them they broke their covenant with
[16:08] him and you know every single time he
[16:12] would go back and he would prove to them
[16:14] that he was true that he wanted to bless
[16:16] them and he everything that he had
[16:18] promised them was exactly that way and
[16:20] when the women despised when he came
[16:23] back they had the same report that God
[16:27] had told and said it's exactly the way
[16:28] God told us it's exactly the same way
[16:31] and now we can go in but you know they
[16:35] were the ones that said they they never
[16:37] said that the Giants in the land look at
[16:40] us as grasshoppers the scripture says we
[16:45] are to them as grasshoppers that was
[16:48] their mindset their thought was that
[16:50] they were thinking they saw themselves
[16:52] has some all that silly it's
[16:55] insignificant that they could believe
[16:58] that God would take them to that place
[17:01] but you know Joshua and Caleb Thompson
[17:03] were more the night but they did not go
[17:08] in they could not believe and you know
[17:14] the scripture says that there he said
[17:22] in numbers because that and your
[17:26] children that you said would be a pray
[17:31] that they would be preyed upon they
[17:33] would be the ones destroyed he said
[17:35] they'll be the ones that going him but
[17:38] he said your carcasses will rot in the
[17:40] wilderness he'd spent all that time
[17:44] trying to prove to him that he was real
[17:46] that that exactly what he was trying to
[17:49] give was right and you know the there's
[17:54] a song that I don't know if you greater
[17:58] vision sings I'm with y'all but with all
[18:00] these many miracles I don't know if
[18:03] y'all know that song
[18:04] you know they talks about all the things
[18:07] that God done you know God tries to
[18:09] prove it and you know and when we think
[18:12] sometimes in our mind the you know God's
[18:14] not going to do this what God's done it
[18:16] before sometimes we act like God can't
[18:20] heal but we struggle with our healing
[18:23] sometimes because it's worse than before
[18:26] or it's long but you know if God's done
[18:29] it before if he's healed us once know
[18:32] what stopping us from being healed again
[18:36] it's the same thing that we had to be
[18:39] healed one time competing the same faith
[18:40] yes and if and if if we have a need we
[18:46] struggle with things in our life
[18:47] sometimes when we wonder why we can't
[18:49] overcome well you know what we've
[18:50] overcome things before it's been the
[18:53] grace of God this led us this far that
[18:55] we overcome with things that we struggle
[18:57] with and then we find other things in we
[18:59] and we have unbelief yeah we struggle
[19:03] with these things what but he's the one
[19:04] that's proof to us that he's faithful
[19:06] and true and just to us up to this point
[19:08] yeah but see we think well we don't know
[19:13] what's gonna happen in the future we
[19:16] don't know what's gonna take place but
[19:17] you know what the same one he knows the
[19:19] end from the beginning the same one that
[19:22] led you this far will lead you all the
[19:26] way if he started a good work in you now
[19:30] then he'll finish the
[19:31] that work he'll continue to do it
[19:34] because you know that you know growing
[19:39] up you know growing up as a child you I
[19:43] never went you know with my dad yo I
[19:48] never had to doubt my dad's work I never
[19:52] I never doubted it because you know if
[19:56] my dad ever promised me anything he done
[19:59] this dead-level best to do it now
[20:03] humanly we're not able to do everything
[20:05] but you know what at least my dad tried
[20:09] because you know I always always tell
[20:11] everybody you know if my dad ever said
[20:14] he was gonna get a hold of us if he's
[20:17] gonna do something I can't I can't ever
[20:20] remember a time in my life when he said
[20:23] we've had it that he didn't give it my
[20:28] dad did my dad just didn't make out of
[20:30] words if my dad said he was gonna knock
[20:34] us in the middle of next week he done
[20:36] his dead-level best to do that yeah but
[20:40] you know that but you know that's the
[20:42] way God is God don't make out of words
[20:46] he said his word wouldn't return to Him
[20:48] void it's not going to return back but
[20:53] it'll go out and it'll do exactly what
[20:55] it set out to accomplish but the thing
[20:58] is is it's human I have other ones that
[21:01] have to believe that we have to be the
[21:04] ones to accept the word because here in
[21:08] the scripture it talks about the gospel
[21:11] was preached the good news was preached
[21:12] to those all through the scripture we
[21:15] find that the good news was preached to
[21:16] the people and the children of Israel
[21:19] they heard the good news
[21:20] all all through the scripture they heard
[21:23] the prophets came and preached the word
[21:26] tool but he said they did not receive
[21:29] they did not believe because it was not
[21:31] mixed with faith and that's that's the
[21:36] thing
[21:37] brethren said in the message community
[21:40] he said it takes the body and the blood
[21:44] which was the spirit the word he said
[21:47] mix with faith brings eternal life say
[21:51] if you don't take it with faith it
[21:54] doesn't matter he said it doesn't matter
[21:56] how much the spirit is here how much the
[21:57] word is preached how much you hear he
[21:59] said if you don't take it by faith it
[22:01] doesn't do you any good and you know
[22:05] that's what I was I was trying to share
[22:07] with this young man you know it takes
[22:09] faith we have we all had to take it by
[22:13] faith everything we've ever received
[22:15] from God has come by faith you know the
[22:21] thing is is we we look at our we look at
[22:24] our faults and our failures but you know
[22:26] we have to we have to put that in to see
[22:28] if forgetfulness to you know because if
[22:32] we if we go before God and we and we ask
[22:35] for forgiveness
[22:36] you know our past is put under the blood
[22:38] then you know what God doesn't see that
[22:40] anymore
[22:41] God doesn't remember that anymore and
[22:44] you know we can meet we can stand before
[22:46] it because brother s it he sees us
[22:49] through the wood if he sees us through
[22:50] the blood then later is perfect as we
[22:53] can be that's the reason why it says
[22:57] that we should come boldly before the
[22:59] throne of grace so you know being a
[23:03] father I got two boys you know we're all
[23:09] a lot of us are parents in here I guess
[23:12] everyone is but you know the thing is is
[23:15] you know when you have kids you don't
[23:17] look at what you know will give and I
[23:19] understand you got to correct them you
[23:20] got to make them but see the thing is is
[23:22] it's the love that you have for you know
[23:26] you don't withhold a good thing from
[23:30] Jesus said you know if your son asks the
[23:33] stone you know for bread what you giving
[23:36] my stone
[23:37] they said if one asked for a fish would
[23:39] you give him a certain thing and he said
[23:43] no and he said well how much more he
[23:46] said that you being evil asked the
[23:49] Heavenly Father will he not you in one
[23:52] place he said he'd give you the Holy
[23:53] Ghost when he not give you these things
[23:56] if you believe so we've put all these
[24:01] things behind us but see it's what the
[24:03] devil brings up and what we all love the
[24:05] devil to put before us that he holds us
[24:09] back but we can step into something and
[24:15] receive from God you know there's
[24:20] there's many people that are hindered by
[24:22] many things they they're hindered by
[24:23] their by their past and you know they'll
[24:27] devil out the devil to hinder them in
[24:29] many different ways
[24:30] right and you see these people one of
[24:35] the things I want to talk about you know
[24:38] there was a I was reading on Facebook
[24:40] you know you find anything you all know
[24:43] on Facebook and you know some people
[24:47] ought to not just the best thing to do
[24:50] is like they don't put nothing on their
[24:51] offensive pictures on their once in a
[24:52] while but you have some people put a lot
[24:54] of thoughts on there oh this is not too
[24:58] bad but you know what was the old saying
[25:01] it's better to be thought of food open
[25:03] your mouth and remove all down
[25:07] but you know some people write you know
[25:10] and it's in it say it and you know not
[25:13] not being disparaging anybody or
[25:16] whatever but you know people get on
[25:18] there and it's so amazing that the
[25:20] scripture perfectly lays out a fivefold
[25:25] ministry there's a there's a you know
[25:28] and and that's the what God was gonna
[25:31] use to speak to man he's always used
[25:35] that from the beginning he's always used
[25:37] man the scripture says that he was the
[25:39] foolishness of preaching he would use
[25:43] this and you know people are so against
[25:45] the fivefold ministry and this man he
[25:49] just he would just he just said some
[25:53] just some really bad things about the
[25:55] about the faithful ministry it was like
[25:57] listen where they were--they you know
[26:00] even if you take what brother Brennan
[26:02] said brother Brennan was wasn't still
[26:04] preaching the gospel even if you're just
[26:07] going to sit and listen to tapes you
[26:08] still had to listen to a man and ceiling
[26:13] is it's the same Holy Ghost that spoke
[26:16] through brother Branham that rode in the
[26:18] scripture that that would be a prophet
[26:20] in our day that would come and speak and
[26:23] you and speak the word it still is
[26:25] simple same Holy Ghost it's still the
[26:27] same mind of God that spoke then if
[26:31] that's true then guess what there's a
[26:33] fivefold ministry made up of apostles
[26:36] prophets evangelists teachers and
[26:38] pastors and you know what they still
[26:40] have the same mind of God and they still
[26:43] are under the same Holy Ghost anointing
[26:45] to speak the mind of God
[26:48] now there might be scarecrows out there
[26:51] but you know the thing is is one of the
[26:54] one of the blessings that we have by
[26:56] receiving the new birth is the power and
[26:59] the spirit of discernment see that's one
[27:05] thing brother Brent said you know you
[27:06] need to find your past
[27:08] and get behind me because he's ordained
[27:10] of God to lead you through but he said
[27:14] if your pastor doesn't preach the word
[27:16] if he gets off if he if he's contrary to
[27:20] the scripture he said you are obligated
[27:22] to leave me and find somebody else now
[27:28] that's the scripture whether we like it
[27:30] or not
[27:31] then you know God didn't God put that in
[27:34] the Bible but you came to find any place
[27:36] where I ever took it out so there is a
[27:41] there is a ministry and you know you
[27:45] know the thing is is I can truck but if
[27:47] by showing that I can trust God because
[27:49] I can trust his vessels the the ministry
[27:53] the instrumentality that he uses but see
[27:59] the thing is it takes the same spirit
[28:02] that we now have to be have the same
[28:07] spirit but if but if we don't get in and
[28:12] I'm sorry people can talk about you know
[28:14] and enough they don't I don't want to
[28:19] say anything but listen it takes the
[28:21] same Holy Ghost yeah and you know enemy
[28:25] maybe maybe I'm wrong enough I'm sorry
[28:28] baby
[28:29] I have a hard time with somebody talking
[28:31] about you know having the Holy Ghost and
[28:34] then denying the word how I mean how
[28:40] does that work I mean I have our time
[28:45] with that if you can't accept the if you
[28:47] can't accept what the scripture says
[28:48] then how then how does the word deny the
[28:50] word and you know what it just breaks my
[28:55] heart really I mean it just you know it
[28:57] just something just rises up inside of
[29:00] me up but you know it's so hard to say
[29:04] these people do this and it's just you
[29:06] know and it's it's not that you get
[29:07] angry at people you can't get angry at
[29:10] people you know there's there's some
[29:14] people that you know
[29:16] you know you know sometimes you think
[29:18] well I just get a hold of news but you
[29:23] know that they know one thing you'll
[29:25] find out is you know if you get a hold
[29:27] you could you could meet somebody all
[29:29] day long and the only thing you get is
[29:31] tired you're not going to change them
[29:37] but see the thing is is you know I think
[29:39] I'm thankful that I have a past and I
[29:42] thought my god I have the passenger that
[29:44] I do but you know people people are well
[29:48] you know they want to shun all that and
[29:50] then all of the other ones that I
[29:52] thought was interesting was this man he
[29:56] listened he was he's like what do they
[29:58] have the powerful ministry have to quote
[30:00] brother branham all the time that quote
[30:03] brother branham all the time and I was
[30:08] like well what we didn't think I told my
[30:12] said hey yeah if the thought come to my
[30:14] mind you know what we ought to do is
[30:16] then if we want to get really talented
[30:18] and we don't only use the brother
[30:19] drowned in the the message will quote
[30:21] brother drowned hey let's not quote the
[30:23] Bible either
[30:23] we're just preach and then we're not
[30:25] doing nothing we could have real skill
[30:26] then yeah and this is like that only
[30:30] makes sense it's like do people actually
[30:35] listen you know do they actually read
[30:36] what they're putting up you know really
[30:38] worth or talking about so how is it that
[30:40] we're not if you know well I guess Paul
[30:44] should've done well hey good how was the
[30:48] one that was talking about took the Old
[30:51] Testament was preaching out the Old
[30:53] Testament showed what the types and
[30:54] everything I mean there's so many in the
[31:00] Old Testament that Brad Brown said that
[31:02] the Prophet said came they took they
[31:04] took what was said prior to them and
[31:06] they they were looking back to those
[31:09] prophets Daniel was there and he said
[31:12] you know I understood by books he was
[31:16] looking back to what was already written
[31:19] all the ones that were looking back
[31:21] brother Branham
[31:24] you know one of the things that lots of
[31:26] times you'll find brother Brennan and I
[31:28] think is interesting that in certain
[31:32] messages you'll notice that brother
[31:34] Brown goes back to the old testament you
[31:37] know Paul when he preached Paul took the
[31:39] Old Testament and brought it into the
[31:41] New Testament but lots of times you'll
[31:44] see brother Brown he'll go back to the
[31:46] Old Testament and then he'll bring it
[31:47] right into the New Testament show you
[31:49] exactly the way Paul was bringing things
[31:51] and then you'll bring it into our day
[31:53] bringing tying it all together but you
[31:57] know some people say well you know they
[32:00] don't want they don't want to quote
[32:01] brother Randall that's like well what do
[32:04] we poke you know what we use it I mean
[32:06] it's not the preaching is not just to
[32:08] get up and just quote brother Randall
[32:11] more read brother Branham you know but
[32:15] you know that's the basis for what we
[32:18] believed we're not if we're not gonna
[32:23] use the Bible if we're not going to use
[32:24] the message of what are we gonna use
[32:26] we're just gonna use our own minds well
[32:28] we oh well we all have our own Mazda all
[32:31] have our own opinions some place that
[32:33] you're going to have a top post to put
[32:35] down and then show what you believe and
[32:37] actually from where you believe in start
[32:39] front but you know we all have to have
[32:43] that place that we come to we all have
[32:50] to have a at our post you come to a
[32:53] replacement
[33:05] yeah
[33:10] for me
[33:11] that you know leave the scripture we
[33:15] find coming coming to that rest and your
[33:23] brother Brown was speaking this is from
[33:24] the the queen of the south and brother
[33:28] Browns speaking of gentleman you know he
[33:35] was talking about Jonah being in a bad
[33:37] ship in bed he said he was in critical
[33:39] shape they said there's nobody here in
[33:42] this tabernacle that bad off tonight he
[33:46] was in the belly of the whale and he
[33:49] said if you look this way it was Wells
[33:51] belly everywhere he looked it was well
[33:53] the belly he said they are lying
[33:55] Vanity's he said once more while I look
[33:58] to your holy temple he said for he know
[34:03] that when Solomon dedicated the temple
[34:05] when he prayed he said lord if thought
[34:12] people would be in trouble anywhere and
[34:14] look toward this holy temple and pray
[34:16] then you hear from heaven and he
[34:18] believed the prayer of Solomon when he
[34:20] answered so God made that sick fish turn
[34:23] right around and taking Jonah to the
[34:25] landing now if Jonah under those
[34:28] circumstances could look to a temple
[34:30] that was built by a man Solomon that
[34:32] later Baxley the earthly temple and a
[34:36] prayer of an ordinary man and God could
[34:37] do a miracle like that for him how much
[34:40] more can he do for you and I when we
[34:41] refuse to look at our condition and once
[34:44] more while I look to the Holy Temple
[34:46] where Jesus sits at the right hand of
[34:48] the Majesty on high making intercession
[34:50] upon our confession amen how can we look
[34:54] at a symptom I look at Jesus not what
[34:57] this looks like but what that said look
[35:00] at Calvary look what a price was paid
[35:02] for person comes in I'm too low down
[35:05] brother Brent Oh God never saved me
[35:08] don't look how bad you are look how good
[35:11] he is don't ever look at yourself look
[35:13] at him he said the priest never did see
[35:16] the one that the sacrifice was made for
[35:22] you know and of all the things you know
[35:30] that earthly tabernacle that Solomon
[35:34] built you know they could turn toward
[35:37] that but you how much more perfect
[35:39] distant temple the sacrifice that was
[35:43] made for us
[35:44] how much perfect how perfect it is you
[35:48] know that we can turn to it and not look
[35:51] at our symptoms but we can look at look
[35:54] to him and receive what we have neato
[35:57] because he's there to receive you know
[36:00] for us what we have need of but the
[36:09] thing is is do we allow him to have
[36:15] access brother Ellis was speaking here
[36:20] he was speaking of the lamb and the dove
[36:23] he said you know the dove wants to come
[36:28] and the dove is to be the one that leads
[36:33] he said but if you try to go your own
[36:35] way if you try to do your own thing he
[36:37] said the double departs but he said the
[36:40] dope comes and stays if you allow him to
[36:43] leave if you don't try to go your own
[36:46] way if you allow him to do the leading
[36:50] then he can lead you and guide you where
[36:53] you need to be were you ought to be and
[36:58] so he's there and we will allow him to
[37:02] do what he wants to do for us if we get
[37:05] out of if we get out of the way you know
[37:08] it's you know we hear a lot of ministers
[37:10] and even even I've said it you you know
[37:13] there's a gift in your life but the gift
[37:15] is to get out of the way and let God
[37:19] speak well you know that's also the same
[37:22] way in receiving it's us to get out of
[37:25] the way so God can speak to us
[37:29] you know rather endless was coconut in
[37:32] the message door and doors and door to
[37:37] the heart you know he talks about
[37:40] inviting somebody you know if you'd open
[37:43] the door to invite somebody in your
[37:45] brother man
[37:46] refers to and they says you know if you
[37:49] invited me into your house you know they
[37:52] said you know I don't kick my shoes off
[37:54] I'm getting the refrigerator get me
[37:56] something to eat you know have a seat
[38:00] drink drink a soft drink or whatever you
[38:03] don't they make myself at home and you
[38:07] know and just and just have freedom well
[38:12] you know what the Holy Spirit can't do
[38:14] anything if we don't allow him that free
[38:19] you know you know brother Graham said
[38:21] you know how many people would be
[38:22] welcome to your house if you know you
[38:24] just tell you come in the house but
[38:26] stand right next to you guys stay right
[38:27] here by the front door
[38:28] don't go move from this bump right here
[38:32] you know that's ridiculous you know if
[38:34] you had somebody come in they just stood
[38:35] right beside your front door they never
[38:37] went anywhere else they just stood right
[38:38] there and you know they start moving
[38:41] around stay right there
[38:45] but if we allow if we don't allow the
[38:48] Holy Spirit to freedom to move and do
[38:51] what needs to be done and sometimes
[38:54] sometimes you know maybe maybe sometimes
[38:58] in our lives we don't realize that we
[39:00] have things up that's in our lives
[39:03] that become a problem here sometimes it
[39:11] takes
[39:12] as well always with bigger weights
[39:16] they're not about praying you know we
[39:20] want to do the talking when we when we
[39:23] pray but prater having a prayer life is
[39:27] really having communion it's you know
[39:33] you know it's not having a time where
[39:37] you have somebody do all the talkin you
[39:40] know and there's people and I'm like I
[39:46] might get in trouble for saying this but
[39:50] my mom wouldn't want I'll talk about my
[39:52] mom she's really good about asking a
[39:55] question but you don't get in time to
[39:58] answer the question because you asked
[39:59] the question and she'll keep on talking
[40:01] and then shall I ask you the question
[40:02] again well if you ever give somebody the
[40:07] chance to answer
[40:07] it's kind of hard to hear didn't you
[40:10] like flat you know she asks the question
[40:12] again it's like well if you don't pause
[40:14] it's kind of hard for me to get in there
[40:16] dancing the question if sometimes you
[40:20] know when we talk to God you know make
[40:22] it trouble for that because that's all
[40:23] take them that's all right I've been in
[40:25] trouble before but you know if we don't
[40:28] we won't talk to God but if we don't
[40:32] pause to let God talk to us that how do
[40:35] we know what God's trying to say that is
[40:39] you know it's kind of funny means
[40:41] they're not we were I had to work late
[40:43] study how we do making Turks well we
[40:46] were at the house and we were watching
[40:47] the service and there were things that
[40:50] brother beau Lewis was saying and it was
[40:53] so funny because we were pointing at
[40:54] each other me and Sarah the boys brought
[40:56] us in their home near say certain things
[40:58] who lives life
[41:02] but you know sometimes when we hear
[41:05] those things it's not that's pointing
[41:07] the fingers over butts that's free
[41:08] Hebrew no space for us because you know
[41:13] that's God speaking to us are we do we
[41:18] allow him that time you know sometimes I
[41:21] always was saying you know wait there's
[41:23] some you know for a lot of people get
[41:24] all this you know the song was written
[41:27] sweet hour of prayer is like well maybe
[41:29] if we add up all the time in the week we
[41:31] might be preached an hour you know they
[41:36] might take ten weeks I don't know but
[41:38] you know if we don't if we won't speak
[41:40] to God that it takes communion not just
[41:44] praying because lots of times people
[41:46] think praying is just we're speaking to
[41:48] God well then you know the problem is
[41:51] you got to wait for a response right you
[41:53] go wait for him to talk back to you
[41:55] give me time sometimes it's it's best to
[41:58] just go and just sit there and not say
[42:02] things or fake things but just you know
[42:08] ask though or what what is it that he
[42:10] wants us to say you know sometimes I'll
[42:14] make a meal and I brother Brazil says
[42:16] you know sometimes when God waits you
[42:18] ever know or not he wants to talk to you
[42:21] sometimes in the middle of night when I
[42:23] wake up you know sometimes that's what I
[42:27] do I sit there lord do you wake me up
[42:29] because you won't talk to me and I
[42:32] sitting there
[42:35] and you know I've I've had there's been
[42:38] times when I've been there and you just
[42:44] I'm just laying in bed awake as I'll
[42:47] order you you want to speak to me and
[42:50] you know there's been times when people
[42:53] have come on my mind to pray floor
[42:56] and I start praying for and then some in
[43:01] time in the in the future you know
[43:04] within a week or whatever sometimes you
[43:07] hear about that person and they have a
[43:10] need and then you know you realize that
[43:14] God was speaking to you because you were
[43:17] to pray for that person because they
[43:19] have a need here sometimes I go you know
[43:23] sometimes we fail to realize it and I've
[43:26] had the opportunity I go through things
[43:29] I'm all option you know
[43:31] you get down you get beat up you're
[43:34] getting despondent whatever and you know
[43:38] the thought that's coming to my mind you
[43:39] people are praying for me
[43:41] [Music]
[43:44] and you know that it's like you know
[43:46] what I've got people interceding for me
[43:48] you know even sometimes you feel like
[43:50] you can't MC for yourself but you know
[43:52] there's people out there to pray for you
[43:54] that love you and you know they it's
[43:56] really good I think God well somebody
[43:59] sends you a text message or whatever
[44:02] unless you know how I've been thinking
[44:04] about you and praying for you hope
[44:07] everything's going good or when you're
[44:08] sick and they find out that you're sick
[44:10] or whatever people call and let you know
[44:13] that they're praying for you sometimes
[44:18] you know we don't realize how blessed we
[44:20] are right we miss out because we're now
[44:24] available to block us and hindrance but
[44:28] you know we're overcomers god bless you
[44:32] this one
[44:35] [Music]
[44:41] well this sums 37 verse 1 says frettin
[44:45] up thyself because of evildoers neither
[44:48] be thou envious against the workers of
[44:50] iniquity for they shall soon be cut down
[44:52] like the grass and wither as the green
[44:54] artery
[44:55] trust in the Lord and do good so shalt
[44:57] thou dwell in the land then verily thou
[44:59] shalt be fed delight thyself also in the
