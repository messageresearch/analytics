[15:07] already prayed for these but remember
[15:09] brother dick sister Gail uh being away
[15:12] and being on the boats and things you
[15:14] know and all and just the Lord would
[15:16] take care of them all right Hebrews 13
[15:18] 8.
[15:20] Lord Jesus we thank you
[15:24] For Your Love Your Grace your guidance
[15:27] your understanding
[15:29] thank you for you
[15:31] the Lord we love you we just ask you now
[15:33] to come tonight and speak to our hearts
[15:36] that we may receive Lord from you what
[15:38] we have need of
[15:40] be with the different ones Lord that are
[15:42] not here
[15:43] and things remember their sicknesses and
[15:45] things among us you said you sent your
[15:47] word and healed us and delivered us from
[15:49] destruction so we believe you and we
[15:51] thank you just have your way and let
[15:53] your loving grace be with each one of us
[15:55] in Jesus name amen
[15:59] Hebrews 13 8 then we've got
[16:02] another one but we'll just quote it
[16:05] but remember
[16:08] we're speaking on positive attitude amen
[16:13] all right
[16:14] O positive no negative
[16:17] now that's what we're going to talk
[16:18] about tonight
[16:20] all right remember then which how the
[16:22] rule over you who has spoken unto you
[16:24] the word of God whose Faith follower
[16:27] considering the end of their
[16:28] conversation now watch in a minute when
[16:30] we read the quote where the Prophet said
[16:31] if you're going to the church that don't
[16:33] believe Hebrews 13 they get away from it
[16:35] no that's his word so then that's that's
[16:38] the point said consider the end of their
[16:40] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[16:43] yesterday today and forever and you may
[16:46] be seated the Lord had his Blessing to
[16:48] the reading of the word but remember in
[16:50] and I know we won't get there tonight
[16:52] but remember in Malachi 3
[16:56] 6 he says for I am God
[16:59] and I change not
[17:01] all right
[17:02] I really enjoyed that song is there
[17:04] anything
[17:05] that would be too hard for God to do
[17:08] nope
[17:09] you know why because I've already done
[17:11] it
[17:13] right I mean come on Amen you're already
[17:17] done it's not he's going to do it
[17:21] it's already done all right then that
[17:23] settles the whole situation
[17:25] now but I've been thinking on this
[17:28] scripture for quite a while
[17:30] in the series parts that have been about
[17:33] the positive attitude and remember our
[17:36] statements that we make with that one
[17:38] each service
[17:40] that anyone in the Bible
[17:43] that ever amounted to anything
[17:45] was someone with a positive attitude
[17:49] all right not only did they have the
[17:51] positive attitude about or you know or
[17:54] natural parts or something they had the
[17:56] positive attitude about uh God's word
[17:59] and God spoke to them
[18:02] and that made it positive all right now
[18:06] see then that that should be the point
[18:08] if we believe God has spoken unto us
[18:12] then right you know
[18:15] right what would be the problem like I
[18:17] was saying there the other day see David
[18:19] had no trouble with Goliath
[18:21] and he was ready to take on his brothers
[18:23] or the whole Army if it's necessary
[18:26] because he believed he was already
[18:28] anointed to be king
[18:30] well you know what it didn't matter what
[18:31] they'd done to him he was going to come
[18:33] to be king if he believed the prophet
[18:36] had anointed him for that all right so
[18:39] we've had a lot that we talked about
[18:41] Sunday there on the
[18:43] point of
[18:46] the promises that God had made
[18:49] unto us
[18:51] right you know the promises well now if
[18:54] he's made a promise
[18:56] is he going to fail to keep it
[18:58] I don't know where Richard's at maybe
[19:01] he's back there doing something with him
[19:03] but we need at least a little hour this
[19:05] is the hard time of the year to try to
[19:07] you know there he is looking all over
[19:09] the place trying to find him but we need
[19:11] him and please somebody still
[19:16] somebody still is playing with the air
[19:18] conditioner system now you may think
[19:20] it's smart and nice and happy and doing
[19:22] yours but the whole the system ran all
[19:25] last week
[19:27] all right so you want to put in about 20
[19:30] bucks in the offering plate because
[19:32] that's what it done it ran all week long
[19:35] on what it was doing but see you know
[19:39] don't don't do that that's uh I know you
[19:42] think it's smart and you know and you're
[19:44] trying to be cool but go tell the ones
[19:47] that knows how to run it to be cooler or
[19:51] do something but anyhow all right
[19:54] but see the entire Bible to me
[19:58] is the promises of God that he has given
[20:02] and written down for the his bride now
[20:07] others are included and others get
[20:10] benefits
[20:11] Etc but he is the main thing is he's
[20:15] talking about and wrote the letter to
[20:17] his bride all right so all of the
[20:19] promises belong to her and he said all
[20:22] of his promises were what
[20:25] II Corinthians 1 20 they're yea and amen
[20:30] all right so then we should not have to
[20:33] worry about anything in it
[20:36] just think about it he's already done it
[20:39] it's already finished
[20:42] you know and we were talking up at the
[20:45] funeral home there when brother Mike had
[20:47] passed away and we were they were
[20:49] talking about
[20:50] and I thought about what brother Branham
[20:52] said
[20:53] he said if ever a doctor maybe you
[20:55] didn't say ever doctor maybe say 200
[20:57] doctors or whatever he said we're
[20:59] standing with you
[21:00] and you're in the greatest Hospital of
[21:02] everything so it's your time to go
[21:04] you're going
[21:06] he said but if ever devil in hell is
[21:08] standing there with you and it ain't
[21:10] your time to go you ain't going
[21:12] so that's where we ought to realize
[21:13] who's in command you know of the whole
[21:16] situation and not worry about it then
[21:18] but now I want us to approach this
[21:22] and now the next message will pick up to
[21:25] relate to this
[21:27] of God not changing
[21:29] but what I want us to think about
[21:31] tonight is a finished product
[21:37] and that way we won't have to worry
[21:39] about whether it's there is you know
[21:42] whether we're talking about do it it's
[21:44] already finished all right
[21:46] now then there is no were in the Bible
[21:52] that there's any or what we would call
[21:55] negativism
[21:57] now there's a lot of things about what
[21:59] people and what they do in their
[22:01] situations yes
[22:03] but I'm talking about what God says has
[22:06] he ever failed to keep his promises
[22:09] has he ever failed to keep his word
[22:12] no
[22:13] no it don't make no difference see but
[22:16] yet we
[22:17] we look at it and I'll get to a quote in
[22:20] a minute what he's saying about it we
[22:22] look at it as
[22:23] you know
[22:26] believing it
[22:29] now do you realize that if you asked
[22:33] oh
[22:34] I wouldn't put a number on it probably
[22:36] 90 or better of
[22:38] the religious world today
[22:41] if they believed
[22:43] that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday
[22:45] today and forever
[22:48] they would say yes
[22:52] now
[22:55] but yet
[22:59] look at the way the world and the world
[23:01] system goes
[23:04] does it produce that
[23:06] as we'll read about brother random we've
[23:08] read this one over and over but
[23:10] to keep it before you that that's where
[23:12] Eve failed
[23:14] well now what did he fail on
[23:19] she believed in God
[23:21] I spread around them right
[23:22] she didn't doubt God
[23:25] she doubted his word
[23:29] all right now see then that away
[23:33] the religious World believes in God
[23:37] talks about God
[23:39] you want to go over here to this church
[23:41] and ask them do they believe in God you
[23:43] want to go anywhere in the world to a
[23:46] religious Christian so-called system to
[23:49] whatever it would be Catholics or
[23:51] whatever
[23:53] and they would you know you could say Do
[23:55] you believe Hebrews 13 8.
[23:58] and they'd say yes because it's in the
[24:02] word of God
[24:04] but has that ever been revealed to you
[24:11] sir I believe dires were the connecting
[24:14] link to all of things that will go out
[24:17] into what we talk about the uh
[24:19] resurrection that we've been talking
[24:21] about the change of the body and then
[24:24] the then the going home you know the
[24:26] Rapture to be caught away
[24:27] I believe it all hinges on the bases of
[24:30] Hebrews 13 8.
[24:33] all right
[24:34] but it hinges on that in the point of
[24:38] what God is saying
[24:42] not what we say
[24:45] we can call it all day brother around
[24:46] said you can say Jesus Jesus
[24:49] and be worshiping the devil
[24:51] now that's hard isn't it because you
[24:53] don't know what he is
[24:55] you don't know how to worship Him
[24:57] all right now
[24:59] then think about it
[25:04] we should always speak positive
[25:09] not negative
[25:11] according to the word of God
[25:14] now I want you to listen tonight
[25:17] I want you to listen and pray about what
[25:20] I'm trying to say
[25:24] do you know that when you say as we were
[25:27] bringing out Sunday a little bit about
[25:28] it you know and you say to people now
[25:30] let's check the Hebrews 13 8 and see if
[25:32] it works this way
[25:35] you say uh by Stripes I'm Healed
[25:42] well
[25:44] I now I just can't say that
[25:47] cause I'm still sick
[25:52] well now you are God one just lied
[25:55] and I'm pretty sure you know who I'm
[25:57] talking about
[25:58] all right
[26:00] well see you say but I've got to tell
[26:03] the truth
[26:05] you know that probably about 98 of the
[26:07] people in prison are been you know
[26:12] executed and things
[26:14] was there because of the truth
[26:17] right
[26:21] but now
[26:22] that truth may be a perverted truth
[26:31] the wording that we use that we call it
[26:35] truth
[26:38] if that's not according to what God says
[26:44] now let's put it this way you can say I
[26:46] told the truth about a car wreck that I
[26:48] saw
[26:51] you know I saw it
[26:54] right now what you're telling is right
[26:58] but you're not telling all of the
[27:00] circumstances that it involved you know
[27:04] with that wreck that you saw
[27:07] what
[27:09] so you say I'm telling the truth well it
[27:11] might not all be exactly the truth
[27:15] well I what do you mean I saw the car
[27:17] run into the other car if it didn't see
[27:19] you turn on say well I saw the car I saw
[27:23] this car number one run into car number
[27:25] two
[27:26] see then you're going to automatically
[27:27] say that the problem is car number one
[27:33] it might not be car number two might
[27:35] have pulled out in front of car number
[27:36] one
[27:40] do you understand
[27:43] you see how simple it is we can say the
[27:45] truth
[27:48] but yet it not be exactly right
[27:52] all right what about the way God says it
[27:56] you know that God says we're perfect and
[27:58] he's talking about born-again Christians
[28:00] right we're not talking about all the
[28:01] other junk right
[28:04] he says we're perfect
[28:07] well I guess you could say that
[28:10] now that's not all truth that you're
[28:12] doing right
[28:15] right you're lying
[28:18] but that's so close to the truth
[28:22] right
[28:23] but you're lying
[28:26] one because the Bible says that you're
[28:28] healed
[28:34] I thought we were supposed to say what
[28:35] the word said
[28:38] whether I understand it or not
[28:40] even whether I believe it or not
[28:43] you know
[28:46] let me at least say what it says
[28:51] all right
[28:52] because you see there's no negative in
[28:54] God
[28:59] see we may be saying something you know
[29:01] we used to believe in a Trinity right
[29:06] and you know that we'd argue with you
[29:08] all day long with scriptures
[29:10] that there was three gods
[29:13] well you know we had part truth right
[29:17] because the scripture you're reading is
[29:19] right
[29:22] but your self-interpretation upon that
[29:26] made it a lie
[29:29] never came from Heaven the prophet said
[29:31] it came out of the pits of hell
[29:33] right all right
[29:36] but yet we believe it
[29:39] I'll die for what I believe
[29:42] well
[29:43] is it true
[29:50] see to say I hope
[29:54] is a good way of doing things
[29:57] I hope
[30:01] now that hope can be a very positive
[30:03] point
[30:06] but if it's not all positive
[30:10] then what is it
[30:13] there's no such thing as 98 positive
[30:18] right right
[30:20] he says 98 pounds that's pretty good
[30:22] point
[30:23] no there's no such thing as 98 positive
[30:27] because you've already admitted this two
[30:29] percent negative
[30:31] all right
[30:32] so now you've made the whole 100 percent
[30:35] negative
[30:39] right oh you might turn on you may have
[30:42] cooked up a light you may do things and
[30:44] wire up and it'll turn on
[30:50] but you may not be getting the right
[30:52] amount of current
[30:57] will you say I've got the light on
[31:02] which you might not have the full
[31:03] current that you need
[31:07] you know that in electricity they'll
[31:09] argue with you that you can take a
[31:12] hundred well a 300 foot extension cord
[31:15] and put light bulbs on it and if there's
[31:18] just as much power on the end of that
[31:20] 300 foot as there is where it starts
[31:25] right
[31:27] is that the theory of electricity Aaron
[31:30] he'll tell you there's just as much
[31:32] power or whatever you want to call it
[31:34] you know
[31:35] at the end of that as there is where you
[31:38] start but I I want you to do me a little
[31:41] just tie a light blue about every 10
[31:43] feet
[31:45] and then turn it on
[31:49] if it's true there's just as much there
[31:51] as he is here that light out dire should
[31:52] be as bright as this light but it won't
[31:55] work
[31:58] is dimmer dimmer dimmer dimmer dimmer
[32:00] dimmer
[32:01] okay
[32:03] oh we're telling the truth
[32:06] a meter May read
[32:09] but it doesn't make no difference
[32:12] now I'm trying to make a point about
[32:14] truth
[32:18] see we say I hope
[32:21] God doesn't say I hope
[32:26] show me in the Bible where God ever said
[32:28] I hope
[32:30] that's what terminology or word of a
[32:32] human language
[32:34] that has no Heavenly atmosphere to it
[32:38] God never says I hope
[32:41] he said I am
[32:46] right
[32:47] he said I am he doesn't say I hope
[32:51] all right
[32:57] you say I believe
[33:06] would you know to God he doesn't believe
[33:07] now come on I know the quote so don't
[33:09] run me with me I know God believes his
[33:12] own words so don't go with it all right
[33:16] because you're going to go negative and
[33:18] you're in trouble all right so go ahead
[33:21] but get what I'm talking about
[33:24] God doesn't say I believe
[33:30] he says what is written truth it that
[33:34] that's finished
[33:35] all right
[33:36] he said it's already to him it's alive
[33:44] it's real to him
[33:46] there's no negative to God
[33:50] well now I'm brought it down got to be
[33:52] something well I know we go ahead and do
[33:54] all your philosophy
[33:56] that's what's the problem if you've got
[33:58] a negativism Hebrews 13 8 is not correct
[34:06] but you got to have a negative no no no
[34:08] no no no forget it there's no such thing
[34:10] as negative and positive in God it's all
[34:13] positive
[34:15] we are the negative if there's anything
[34:17] to it
[34:22] he never says I hope so maybe I will or
[34:25] I might do it
[34:29] he said it's already finished
[34:36] God in his ways then
[34:39] I'm trying to get a point late in your
[34:41] mind
[34:46] if Hebrews 13 8 is correct
[34:52] then he's the same yesterday today and
[34:55] forever
[34:58] then if he says I'm God
[35:00] and I changed not
[35:04] well he was a trinity and we changed it
[35:07] we it was one and we changed it to a
[35:09] tree yeah we did he didn't change the no
[35:11] Trinity
[35:16] are you listening
[35:20] how much negativism do we have that we
[35:23] really don't even know we have
[35:32] come on I'm asking each one of us a
[35:34] serious question
[35:35] how much negativism do we have when we
[35:38] really don't even know we have it
[35:40] and that's what frustrates people
[35:43] is when you expose their negativism
[35:52] and see when you do then they get all
[35:54] upset with you about it
[35:57] but there's nothing in God in no way
[35:59] that has any negative Point whatever
[36:07] he couldn't say he's yea and amen
[36:09] he said yay nay yay nay yay
[36:13] huh
[36:15] but when he said it's yea and amen
[36:19] that means it's positive
[36:21] now before you go too far and miss me in
[36:24] the message I want to make a little
[36:26] point
[36:28] you and I are very negative
[36:33] all right
[36:34] we live in a negative world
[36:39] no no brother that we live in no
[36:42] we live in a negative world
[36:48] it took them
[36:50] thousands of years to split the atom
[36:55] no
[36:57] but you know God split it way back
[36:59] before then
[37:02] and
[37:04] right
[37:06] but now I'm trying to get you to
[37:09] think
[37:15] yes what brother Dale I'm I'm positive
[37:19] you ever heard that saying you know are
[37:20] you positive I'm positive I think
[37:27] if there's any doubt
[37:29] you're not positive
[37:32] now positive and negative goes together
[37:34] to make a lot of things that's agreeable
[37:37] but remember
[37:39] positive and negative don't make
[37:41] negative
[37:45] the only thing you're dealing with
[37:46] positive and negative is a grounding
[37:49] effect
[37:51] to make it work
[37:53] into capacity you desire for it to work
[37:56] like a light bulb
[37:59] you can put 5 000 Watts on one of those
[38:02] light bulbs it won't do a thing won't
[38:05] blow it
[38:06] it won't mess it up
[38:09] now I know somewhere you might go to a
[38:11] burning point okay but
[38:17] but you put a ground on there and you'll
[38:18] find out in a hurry
[38:22] right
[38:24] I mean you're going to find out in a
[38:25] hurry you hook up a 220 and put a 110
[38:28] light bulb on it
[38:32] all right you just connect up one of
[38:35] those
[38:37] 220.
[38:38] and leave the negative off and it won't
[38:41] worry about it anything it'll just sit
[38:43] there
[38:44] but you touch that ground it's going to
[38:46] blow that light bulb in a hurry and see
[38:48] that's what happens to our Revelation
[38:49] that we think we have
[38:53] we thought we had an understanding of
[38:57] God
[38:58] until this Prophet came to bring us the
[39:01] message
[39:04] we thought we had enough knowledge of a
[39:06] lot of things until the prophet came
[39:08] along
[39:10] and showed us the truth
[39:13] right
[39:14] now
[39:18] think about
[39:19] no negativism
[39:25] and look at a God that's fully positive
[39:31] well then we know where the problem is
[39:33] at
[39:35] it's in US
[39:37] all right
[39:38] may I illustrate it as the prophet said
[39:40] he said now God doesn't change and he
[39:43] sit down to the church age he said he's
[39:44] the same
[39:46] but he said now I I didn't say that man
[39:49] didn't change
[39:50] and he said I didn't say that the church
[39:53] didn't change
[39:54] he said I'm saying that God didn't
[39:56] change
[39:58] all right
[39:59] when I ordered all of this Doctrine come
[40:01] from
[40:05] come from a lot of problems
[40:07] but now
[40:11] whatever he was
[40:15] he still is
[40:20] and whatever he is is what he'll always
[40:23] be
[40:26] right that's Hebrews 13 8. amen
[40:30] right
[40:32] now there's the positive about God's
[40:34] word
[40:38] that it doesn't matter what man believes
[40:40] or what's going on God is always
[40:43] positive
[40:45] and always right
[40:49] but yet it
[40:51] shouldn't
[40:56] are you listening
[40:58] it takes a revelation for you and I to
[41:01] have any form of being positive right
[41:05] the only part I have about this message
[41:07] is what God's revealed to me same for
[41:09] you
[41:11] I've always tell you I wish I had in my
[41:13] heart revealed what's in my head running
[41:15] around
[41:19] so quote
[41:23] will kill you
[41:27] scriptures will kill you
[41:30] I saw a sign the other day on the church
[41:32] and it said
[41:40] you and I are
[41:43] yeah let me just say it
[41:46] you and I
[41:48] in our ways of being and doing
[41:53] are the most
[41:55] positive negative
[41:59] things it's ever been
[42:01] now that may not come out good to your
[42:04] thinking but what I'm saying is
[42:08] there was a time when we were positive
[42:12] about things
[42:15] right
[42:16] we believed in a trinity we believed in
[42:18] an eternal hell we believed in all these
[42:21] things
[42:23] and one day the truth straightened us
[42:24] out
[42:29] see now think about this as I read see
[42:32] he said a teacher
[42:34] doesn't quote
[42:39] that's more on it but that was what
[42:41] struck my eye
[42:43] a teacher don't quote
[42:47] it down you're always quoting and we
[42:50] call you a teacher well then you you
[42:52] know
[42:53] you're not listening to what I'm saying
[42:57] if all I can do is
[43:04] could you get it together
[43:08] you remember the man telling brother
[43:10] random said
[43:11] if it was a good Baptist you know it
[43:13] says when we get it all down to where we
[43:16] know whatever word means in the Greeks
[43:18] and the thing he said until then we
[43:20] can't believe it he said they would
[43:22] arguing it
[43:24] the time of the Lord Jesus about it
[43:28] see
[43:32] you say well what we need to do is get
[43:34] all the quotes and I remember years ago
[43:36] a brother made a statement
[43:40] he said what we need to do he said we
[43:42] need to and they just developing the
[43:44] computer
[43:45] hadn't got into the uh
[43:47] bringing it into the message that much
[43:49] but they were talking about it and he
[43:52] said what we need to do
[43:54] said we need to just take all the quotes
[43:56] put them in the computer and let the
[43:58] computer shoot out the answer and that's
[44:00] what we believe
[44:06] oh
[44:08] that uh
[44:13] what would you do when we get over the
[44:15] minute when brother Brown talks about
[44:17] the Corporal body
[44:19] and
[44:21] and then when he gets through talking
[44:23] about a Corporal body
[44:25] let's see what else is he called it
[44:27] he calls it a cardinal body
[44:34] he calls it a cardinal body I looked
[44:36] that up and tried to find out what
[44:38] Cardinal meant from the bird on down to
[44:40] see if it had any relationship that
[44:42] maybe he would have putting something
[44:45] there for us to think about and I
[44:46] couldn't find a thing maybe you can but
[44:49] my point is to put this message in a
[44:52] computer and bring it out would just
[44:54] bring out
[44:55] word for word
[44:58] in a lineup and if that worked perfectly
[45:01] without any of the quotes brother
[45:04] Branham says in the wording that he says
[45:06] and the things that he speaks sometimes
[45:09] even if you got all that right you know
[45:10] what you'd have
[45:12] a good book right
[45:17] right
[45:19] you have a good book
[45:23] but if God could reveal it to you
[45:29] look what you'd have then
[45:32] well I'll just keep what I've got all
[45:35] right
[45:37] because what he's revealed to me I that
[45:40] I can stand on
[45:41] amen and I don't worry about it
[45:44] you know if you're getting the point
[45:46] what I'm saying is revelation is
[45:48] positive
[45:50] Revelation is not negative
[45:52] all right you can say Well it goes from
[45:54] negative to positive well that's okay
[45:58] but remember
[46:01] if you use that wrong you've got a
[46:04] problem
[46:06] right
[46:08] if you say and I know brother random use
[46:10] that negative deposit here I know yeah
[46:15] but you can't go from negative to
[46:17] positive
[46:23] come on you're all sitting there looking
[46:24] at me now I'm wondering
[46:26] how can you go from negative to positive
[46:28] come on we got electricians back here
[46:31] we've got God works out you know
[46:34] thing would have got on him
[46:36] clickers and stuff yeah
[46:38] brother Daniel
[46:40] which you can't go see we know and we
[46:43] say we go from negative to positive and
[46:45] that's all right but there's no way to
[46:47] go from negative to positive
[46:53] how can you do that
[46:57] so the prophet says it's from partial
[47:01] realization
[47:03] to perfect realization
[47:05] okay now we got something
[47:09] so what if you shot that into a computer
[47:11] to try to get an answer
[47:14] but do you realize the very positive the
[47:17] very
[47:19] negative part
[47:21] you start with do you want to use that
[47:22] word
[47:24] the partial realization that you would
[47:26] receive
[47:28] you realize that's positive
[47:35] I don't understand that because you're
[47:37] blowing my brain
[47:39] well uh
[47:41] you need to get your syringe kind of
[47:43] push a little in there you know
[47:46] spiritually speaking is what I mean
[47:49] because there's no way
[47:52] from a negative to a positive they
[47:55] argued that years ago I said well what
[47:57] are you arguing about right around them
[47:59] and simply saying partial realization to
[48:02] perfect realization
[48:04] right he's using partial realization as
[48:07] negative
[48:09] but he's not saying that it's negative
[48:16] anything God reveals to you is positive
[48:22] don't care how small it is
[48:26] that's why you shouldn't honor and be
[48:28] happy and rejoice
[48:30] when the god of Glory would drop down
[48:33] into a human being and reveal to that
[48:37] human being something about himself
[48:42] that ought to make us positive
[48:47] could you see you can't have him the
[48:49] same yesterday today and forever if you
[48:51] start trying to deal with negative and
[48:52] positive sometimes
[48:57] but even remember this
[49:01] God never changed
[49:06] he never became a trinity because we
[49:09] believed he was a trinity
[49:14] and the best we could try to explain
[49:15] that you know
[49:17] never made him any of that form
[49:21] whatsoever that we had in our mind
[49:25] now watch it I know ain't getting there
[49:26] this evening but that's all right
[49:29] watch it when the brother Brown says
[49:33] that he's the same here as he was tired
[49:40] all right that's the problem that I've
[49:42] had with the people of the message
[49:46] my problem has been one thing I've tried
[49:48] to be positive
[49:54] and people saying but we don't have
[49:56] nothing
[49:59] if you had what you think of God then
[50:01] this would happen and that would happen
[50:03] well come on let's talk about it
[50:06] sister freda's come walking up Sunday
[50:08] and said brother Dale while you're
[50:10] preaching my pain went away
[50:16] well that's what it's supposed to be
[50:18] right he sent his word and healed him
[50:23] but you see we say but but I don't see
[50:26] no I don't see no Silver and Gold Have I
[50:29] None but rise up and walk
[50:38] but you realize if he does anything
[50:42] he's the Healer
[50:45] and if he does never heal anybody up
[50:47] he's still the Healer
[50:50] if he never saves nobody he's still the
[50:52] savior
[50:54] you know what I mean from now on or do
[50:55] anything
[50:57] but you see that's what I've tried to
[50:59] get people to talk about and I know it's
[51:01] been a discussion among many that we
[51:04] just don't see the signs and wonders we
[51:06] used to see
[51:12] I differed with that then and I differ
[51:14] with it now
[51:16] because I've always tried to explain to
[51:19] you one thing that all other signs and
[51:22] wonders would never be in Lula Georgia
[51:25] they were around the world
[51:28] in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[51:32] but put it all together and what have
[51:35] you got
[51:37] Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today
[51:39] and forever
[51:46] you remember this one we won't get to it
[51:48] tonight but remember this one well now
[51:50] in a way
[51:51] brother Branham says no
[51:56] right he's either the same or he's not
[51:59] the same
[52:03] but yet we think so
[52:06] see we think we're so smart in the point
[52:09] of
[52:10] being able to say
[52:13] well I just don't see things like
[52:15] you know
[52:17] we don't see like the ministry of
[52:18] brother Branham no not one person you
[52:21] never see that wrong person I've been
[52:24] that way ever since I've been in this
[52:25] message there is no such thing as one
[52:27] man having a Ministry like that
[52:30] it was Dire
[52:32] there was one man back there in the
[52:34] Bible which was the Lord Jesus Christ he
[52:36] had that Ministry
[52:38] and there's never been a man down
[52:41] through time that had that like he did
[52:44] right yet you had great men like Paul
[52:46] you had great men like
[52:48] you know Martin you know
[52:50] miracle in every meeting they had
[52:55] but yet in the last days when brother
[52:57] Branham come on the Earth he said here
[52:59] it is again he said God doing more in
[53:03] one service
[53:05] than he's done in the whole book of Acts
[53:10] you see that's where we get that big
[53:12] idea
[53:13] and I've been
[53:15] playing but yet explained to you
[53:19] you take the book of Acts I wish
[53:21] somebody would do it one day and sit
[53:23] down and go chapter one chapter two
[53:24] chapter and write down the Miracles and
[53:27] write down how long it was between here
[53:29] and here because you're somewhere into
[53:31] 30 years
[53:33] in the book of Acts
[53:40] 20 if you want to be technical using
[53:42] Brother random as a 53 to go with a
[53:45] Soviet house somewhere around 20 years
[53:48] or better
[53:51] see the reason I do that is I don't want
[53:53] those smart attic minds are doing
[53:55] but you know they're not doing no good
[53:57] with what I'm talking about
[53:59] I just try my best to dig you out of the
[54:02] holes that you're falling yourself into
[54:06] you sit there in the negativism and
[54:08] think about well there's nothing going
[54:09] on unless it happened to me
[54:13] now you let it happen you you're gonna
[54:15] get up and croak
[54:19] when I'm going to croak when it's
[54:20] happening to anybody
[54:25] why because it's Hebrews 13 8.
[54:30] all right
[54:34] the original translation says
[54:38] it's an emphatic dog lot
[54:41] Jesus anointed
[54:43] yesterday
[54:45] and today dividing with two words
[54:50] the same and for
[54:54] this ages
[54:55] the ages
[54:59] don't know how far it goes doesn't
[55:01] matter
[55:02] at first come it doesn't matter
[55:04] he's the same
[55:07] right that's the original translation
[55:11] all right you could go and do a lot of
[55:13] the different ones and they've got some
[55:14] marvelous ones if you'd like to take my
[55:16] book one of these days and look them up
[55:18] but think about it
[55:21] listen to what he says we'll get a few
[55:23] of these
[55:25] look at number one on our notes which
[55:27] I've read this over and over and over
[55:32] this is proving his word
[55:35] we got Josiah in
[55:38] in Zach back there running and I told
[55:40] him I said
[55:41] scan the audience
[55:43] as we go along
[55:48] oh them frowny old faces is on that
[55:50] computer
[55:58] I don't like that Lord I put my face on
[56:00] there why are you a crook
[56:04] you don't want your identification
[56:05] somewhere
[56:09] look what he says
[56:11] if you belong this is from the message
[56:13] proving his word 64 8 16.
[56:16] and reason I say that we had a meeting
[56:18] we would hear one time you remember that
[56:19] happened a little Ray tell you the man's
[56:21] name I won't get into none of that we
[56:22] had a man come here Among Us
[56:25] in a fellowship meeting was having
[56:27] come find out he was the Feller that
[56:29] would help in that guy down here trying
[56:31] to push his wife out to her pushing a
[56:33] woman out of an airplane down in the
[56:35] okra for gnocchi swamps and they
[56:37] couldn't get her to fall out and they
[56:38] come back and landed to try to get her
[56:40] greased up a little more
[56:42] and they caught them
[56:45] he said right here he used to go to
[56:48] brother Ray's house you know a lot of
[56:50] people
[56:52] so he might be some people might not
[56:53] want their face okay
[56:58] he says if you belong to a church
[57:01] that don't believe that he's the same
[57:03] yesterday today and forever the same in
[57:08] every way get away from it
[57:13] get away from it
[57:18] now let me put this part in where you'll
[57:21] think about it that's why I read verse
[57:22] 7. because in verse 7 it says consider
[57:26] the end of their conversation
[57:31] right
[57:33] is that verse seven we only read verse
[57:35] eight pull it back up brother Joe
[57:37] you want to pull up Hebrews 13 8.
[57:41] and just look at it
[57:43] remember then which have the rule over
[57:45] you who's that talking about
[57:47] preachers
[57:49] right
[57:51] Elders deacons people
[57:55] Sunday school teachers
[57:57] all kind
[58:00] remember them which either rule over you
[58:02] who has spoken unto you the word of God
[58:04] whose Faith father
[58:08] considering the end of their
[58:09] conversation
[58:13] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[58:14] and forever
[58:17] all right
[58:19] if somebody's not speaking according to
[58:21] Hebrews 13 8 we're supposed to get away
[58:23] from it
[58:30] look at the next one we'll get a few
[58:32] things and then
[58:34] we'll see what we're doing look at the
[58:36] God of this evil age
[58:38] this is the one we use a lot of times
[58:39] About Eve
[58:41] we find now this evil age is to prove to
[58:44] Satan
[58:48] and you and I
[58:50] are going to prove to Satan
[58:56] now who do you think keeps us talk about
[58:57] we're reading it all for the thing I
[59:00] want to believe I'm one of them don't
[59:02] you
[59:07] know we find this evil age is to prove
[59:09] to Satan
[59:11] she's not like Eve
[59:14] that she's not that type of a woman oh
[59:16] man that's just oh that's rather
[59:17] adulteration and all other things you
[59:19] know and that was just he was just all
[59:21] kind of adulterous and
[59:26] you know amazing thing to me in the
[59:28] Bible there were the brother random was
[59:30] speaking about that
[59:31] it wasn't Mary Magdalene that they cast
[59:34] those seven demons out
[59:37] and you know I had my idea and I bet you
[59:39] did too
[59:42] you had your idea about them demons
[59:44] didn't you
[59:46] lust
[59:48] desire
[59:50] fleshly things
[59:57] I'll be glad to show you where the
[59:59] Prophet said
[1:00:00] that that wasn't what it was
[1:00:03] it was Pride boast
[1:00:07] you know
[1:00:08] I'm something
[1:00:10] you mean but I thought that was a a lust
[1:00:14] demon
[1:00:16] the lust Demon's probably better off
[1:00:24] look
[1:00:26] she's not like Eve
[1:00:30] that type of a woman
[1:00:32] and she'll be Tried by his word
[1:00:35] I love that
[1:00:37] God give me a word whether I understand
[1:00:39] it or what let me have it
[1:00:41] I used to go to Jeffersonville years ago
[1:00:43] and I've always been a shyster about the
[1:00:45] words you know that we'd go to
[1:00:47] Jeffersonville we'd go up there that was
[1:00:49] in the 68 right in there and they'd
[1:00:52] print 500 books and they'd beat 2 000
[1:00:55] people there
[1:00:56] stand in line I stood in line for three
[1:00:59] hours
[1:01:00] to get into listen to a tape
[1:01:05] get over that cut page two
[1:01:09] uh
[1:01:11] but you know what
[1:01:13] when they come to give those books out
[1:01:17] they'd be coming from the front to the
[1:01:19] back
[1:01:20] they bring boxes and the ones that are
[1:01:22] there you remember it they bring boxes
[1:01:25] and they'd set them down and they take
[1:01:27] them out and they pass them down the
[1:01:28] aisles
[1:01:30] but we'd probably be sitting in the very
[1:01:32] back because of hard to get a seat
[1:01:35] I would just go down through there like
[1:01:37] I was looking for a seat
[1:01:41] and they'd pick up a handful of books
[1:01:43] and I'd say thank you brother like I was
[1:01:46] going to help him
[1:01:47] I was on the back row
[1:01:51] we always got the books
[1:01:54] we never went to Jeffersonville that we
[1:01:56] didn't get the book of the what they
[1:01:57] were playing
[1:01:59] I made sure
[1:02:00] that's why I love that word
[1:02:02] well look what he says about her
[1:02:05] Adam's bride believed every bit of the
[1:02:08] word
[1:02:09] all but confused on one promise
[1:02:12] now remember she never doubted God
[1:02:15] she never doubted there was a god
[1:02:19] right
[1:02:21] come on
[1:02:24] all but confused on one promise that
[1:02:27] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:02:28] forever
[1:02:30] see but failed on one promise
[1:02:32] under the temptation of the enemy face
[1:02:35] to face
[1:02:36] and now the people that's called by his
[1:02:38] name of course is his bride she used to
[1:02:41] come into contact Again by the same
[1:02:43] thing
[1:02:45] face to face with Satan
[1:02:47] face to face with him
[1:02:52] not by just denominational truth or
[1:02:54] something whatever word
[1:02:56] we're going to face every word
[1:03:00] every word
[1:03:02] that proceedeth out of his mouth
[1:03:07] brother Joe go over to number seven and
[1:03:09] we'll try to get this and back up and
[1:03:11] talk a little bit
[1:03:15] well he's getting there I'll give you
[1:03:16] the background of the story
[1:03:20] he's talking about
[1:03:22] our fine denominations such as
[1:03:24] Presbyterian Methodist Baptist
[1:03:27] Church of God Pentecostals whatever
[1:03:29] Nazarene Pilgrim holist I'd say to them
[1:03:32] hello
[1:03:35] I'd say to them
[1:03:37] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:03:40] forever
[1:03:41] sure
[1:03:46] you remember where I started a while ago
[1:03:48] you could ask anybody
[1:03:50] did they believe Jesus Christ the same
[1:03:52] yesterday sure
[1:03:56] sure
[1:03:59] well
[1:04:01] is he the same in every way
[1:04:04] except his Corporal body
[1:04:07] and brother Branham say what
[1:04:11] then they would answer
[1:04:13] well there'd be a question she would
[1:04:15] start to a point if you understand what
[1:04:17] he's doing then you'd say well he's he's
[1:04:19] everything except a Corporal body
[1:04:22] and you say to the people this message
[1:04:24] right now that here he's here the same
[1:04:26] except his Corporal body
[1:04:30] well I don't see no signs and wonders
[1:04:36] you don't even have that in the Baptist
[1:04:37] method it's they're right over right now
[1:04:39] screaming about signs and wonders
[1:04:43] come on
[1:04:45] well there'd be a question
[1:04:48] they would say yes of course
[1:04:55] but if Christ is the same
[1:04:57] he's got to be manifesting himself just
[1:05:00] like he did
[1:05:02] for he said the works that I do shall
[1:05:05] you also
[1:05:06] More Than This shall you do where I go
[1:05:09] to the father
[1:05:11] a little while in the world will see me
[1:05:13] no more
[1:05:15] now what's he saying
[1:05:20] could it be that Eve in the garden
[1:05:23] just misbelieved one word
[1:05:26] is that the way it is
[1:05:29] still not you remember no
[1:05:33] and she believed everything
[1:05:35] she was a good preacher
[1:05:37] she was a good church member she was
[1:05:40] really a great person
[1:05:45] remember this unbelief came into being
[1:05:48] before the actual literal act where the
[1:05:51] Beast took place so now we're dealing
[1:05:53] with it prior to the Natural act so get
[1:05:56] the natural act out of your mind the
[1:05:59] real serpent seed is Satan's lie
[1:06:03] that's the seat of the serpent he says
[1:06:05] lie he doesn't have a natural seed
[1:06:11] right
[1:06:13] but you go to the people of the
[1:06:15] religious world and you ask them is he
[1:06:18] Hebrews 13 8.
[1:06:21] yes
[1:06:24] well do you believe that he heals today
[1:06:27] like he did
[1:06:31] no
[1:06:33] no I will tell you this much now
[1:06:37] I believe he can
[1:06:41] right
[1:06:42] now I believe he can
[1:06:48] but he just don't do it
[1:06:54] now what kind of a lie is that
[1:06:57] I consider that to be the greatest one
[1:07:00] ever told
[1:07:05] but he don't do today like he used to
[1:07:09] why don't you say as far as I'm
[1:07:11] concerned
[1:07:13] you might have a hope if you do that
[1:07:15] but if you determine it on the basis of
[1:07:17] your own rotten bushel of apples
[1:07:21] you might get in trouble
[1:07:26] you see at least we should say he's the
[1:07:30] same
[1:07:32] at least we could now should never say
[1:07:34] in a way
[1:07:38] that's on down in here right
[1:07:43] we should say he's the same we are the
[1:07:46] ones that's causing the problems
[1:07:48] now we got it in order but to say God
[1:07:51] don't do like he used to do you are a
[1:07:54] liar
[1:07:56] and the truth is not in you
[1:08:02] more words did I hit
[1:08:09] words today
[1:08:15] I preached a little series here one time
[1:08:17] in the seals
[1:08:18] message you never told nobody what I was
[1:08:20] doing
[1:08:23] through the seals I preached
[1:08:27] and I said Lord
[1:08:30] I'm not going to talk about healings or
[1:08:32] anything
[1:08:33] I'm on deliberately stay away from it I
[1:08:36] didn't mean I wouldn't pray for nobody I
[1:08:37] you know we had prior we had done
[1:08:40] but I ain't gonna tell nobody what I'm
[1:08:41] doing
[1:08:43] when it was all finished I said now I
[1:08:45] want to ask you a question
[1:08:49] how many here has been healed during
[1:08:53] this series which is
[1:08:56] I don't know 60 70 messages I don't know
[1:08:59] exactly brother gearing tell you sister
[1:09:03] Louise is going to say I tell you
[1:09:10] but you know what there was a lot of
[1:09:12] hands went up
[1:09:15] it had been healed delivered
[1:09:20] but you see church that's where our
[1:09:23] problem is at
[1:09:29] do we think about manifested Sons and
[1:09:31] Daughters well in order to be to speak
[1:09:32] that word just speak that word I told
[1:09:34] them when I first heard that I said
[1:09:36] you've got to get it for you can speak
[1:09:38] it and what I meant by that was it had
[1:09:40] to be revealed to you
[1:09:46] not you speak it
[1:09:48] right you remember Sunday when I stand
[1:09:50] with the prophet that said the other day
[1:09:51] on that tape where he said it's not what
[1:09:53] you say
[1:09:54] he said it's not the words you say
[1:09:58] he says it's what's in your heart your
[1:10:00] thinking about the revelation
[1:10:09] it's your faith
[1:10:11] that God looks at not your beautiful
[1:10:14] words
[1:10:17] be like that man was in a Baptist Church
[1:10:19] that time got up there more he they had
[1:10:21] him to pray he prayed the most beautiful
[1:10:23] prayer you've ever heard in your life
[1:10:25] and this other man told me later he said
[1:10:29] I looked over there and said that Feller
[1:10:31] was reading it
[1:10:33] got a good life
[1:10:36] said he was reading it well that's all
[1:10:39] right he wanted to write it down and
[1:10:40] read it
[1:10:42] but listen Church
[1:10:45] how easy it is it
[1:10:49] to fall in the category where Eve failed
[1:10:55] have you ever put your plate except no
[1:10:57] no I'm not like that first type of woman
[1:11:00] she wasn't that type of woman to start
[1:11:01] with either
[1:11:06] I'm talking about back before the
[1:11:09] literal things begin to happen is where
[1:11:11] her spiritual condition was beginning to
[1:11:14] mess up and she doubted God to keep his
[1:11:16] word
[1:11:18] I would say well in a way
[1:11:21] you could have said to Eve do you
[1:11:22] believe Hebrews 13 8 of course we know
[1:11:24] it wasn't written back there all right
[1:11:28] but if you'd ask her do you believe God
[1:11:31] never changes she just said you're right
[1:11:36] so it wasn't God it changed it was easy
[1:11:38] to change
[1:11:39] you know what she changed the word
[1:11:42] what has mankind done down through time
[1:11:45] changed the word
[1:11:48] right
[1:11:50] to their own ideas and Concepts
[1:11:56] I remember when the two Soul Doctrine
[1:11:58] got started
[1:11:59] I think they're in the 60s and 70s
[1:12:02] and people would be talking they'd say
[1:12:04] I've been waiting on this I know
[1:12:06] something was coming I've been awaiting
[1:12:08] on this I believe just all it alone
[1:12:14] okay
[1:12:19] but what is he talking about this people
[1:12:22] that he would say Do you believe
[1:12:26] that he's the same
[1:12:29] and wrote around and said but if Christ
[1:12:32] is the same
[1:12:33] he's got to be manifesting himself just
[1:12:36] like he did
[1:12:37] for he said the works I do you shall
[1:12:42] works I do shall you also More Than This
[1:12:46] shall you do for I go to the father
[1:12:53] but you see
[1:12:57] I wish you would run in and I'll try to
[1:12:59] cover this and I won't have to back up
[1:13:01] because I got a few more minutes
[1:13:03] brother Branham said he's here the same
[1:13:05] except a Corporal body
[1:13:14] now I wish you'd run that into your
[1:13:16] computer I believe it's 148 times now
[1:13:20] some of those are not related I run a
[1:13:22] lot of them but some of them are not
[1:13:23] related to say Corporal he just said
[1:13:25] we're here in a Corporal body you know
[1:13:27] but I'd say 80 percent of them at least
[1:13:31] 60 percent of them are talking about
[1:13:33] that Jesus
[1:13:35] is the same here today
[1:13:39] except
[1:13:40] for a Corporal body
[1:13:44] in other words what's he saying the only
[1:13:46] difference
[1:13:47] between back there
[1:13:50] when he walked ashore to Galilee and
[1:13:52] today
[1:13:54] is the Corporal body
[1:13:57] and you know what he says we are that
[1:14:00] body
[1:14:06] if he came here now in a Corporal body
[1:14:08] he would mess up every scripture in the
[1:14:10] Bible
[1:14:11] because we're supposed to meet him in
[1:14:12] the air then it's supposed to be you
[1:14:15] know
[1:14:16] at that situation then we'll meet a
[1:14:18] Corporal body
[1:14:20] huh
[1:14:23] you see church that's where we get
[1:14:25] everything all the way and we don't
[1:14:27] think about what he's saying he's the
[1:14:29] same in every way
[1:14:33] except a Corporal body
[1:14:39] but do we believe that
[1:14:43] he said one day like this he said no one
[1:14:46] needs say I wish I was back there
[1:14:51] you remember that one
[1:14:54] he said because he's the same yesterday
[1:14:56] today and forever
[1:15:00] but we tell you I wish I'd back there
[1:15:02] when the Lord Jesus was here
[1:15:05] let me quote brother random I'd rather
[1:15:07] be here right right
[1:15:09] is that he said
[1:15:11] he had a choice of times he said he's
[1:15:13] going to be here
[1:15:15] would that be nice to have been back
[1:15:16] tire with Peter and Paul and those
[1:15:19] Apostles wouldn't it
[1:15:24] to a lot of us there's a few of you that
[1:15:26] are still on or on that part because you
[1:15:29] were there when the prophet
[1:15:30] came and was doing you might have been
[1:15:32] young kids like Joyce and in Charlotte
[1:15:36] and
[1:15:37] Brother Gary back there
[1:15:39] if I miss anybody else I didn't mean to
[1:15:41] but some you know that was Dire
[1:15:45] that was that's an honor a great
[1:15:48] cherished possession
[1:15:51] I'm proud to go around people and they
[1:15:53] say have you got any people in your
[1:15:56] church
[1:15:57] that was in them
[1:15:59] prophets Ministry you know
[1:16:02] I said when I started there
[1:16:04] in July the 4th 1971 when brother
[1:16:06] Moulton I started the church together
[1:16:09] I said the biggest portion of people in
[1:16:11] that building was people that said under
[1:16:13] bread around this ministry and seen the
[1:16:15] dead Rays the sick healed there's
[1:16:18] Tootsie in in Frida
[1:16:22] they was there
[1:16:26] dear and brother Reynolds Ministry
[1:16:32] but you see I'd rather be here
[1:16:36] it would have been nice to have been
[1:16:37] back there with brother Branham to
[1:16:39] went hunting and fishing with him
[1:16:40] because that would have been a wonderful
[1:16:41] time
[1:16:43] but I'd rather be here
[1:16:47] even though I know as we read that this
[1:16:49] bride is going to be tested
[1:16:52] by every word
[1:16:54] Satan's gonna pour everything he's got
[1:16:57] against this little bride
[1:17:01] try to make her doubt and if he can make
[1:17:04] us doubt he's got us
[1:17:09] but at least we should say
[1:17:12] I might not be able is this a quote
[1:17:15] I might not be able to produce
[1:17:17] everything is that the way brother run
[1:17:19] said it he said but don't let me stand
[1:17:22] in the way if somebody can
[1:17:25] that's his quote
[1:17:31] you see I believe he's the same
[1:17:34] I can't take anything negative
[1:17:38] yeah but we just don't see it
[1:17:43] nobody's tying you to this building to
[1:17:46] make you come to this church
[1:17:50] I don't mean that in disrespect or
[1:17:52] nothing I just lean into the truth
[1:17:56] ain't nobody gonna say you're off the
[1:17:57] word to leave
[1:18:00] but there's one thing about it if you
[1:18:02] find more in what's here please let us
[1:18:04] know
[1:18:07] because I might like to try to follow
[1:18:08] around with you
[1:18:13] because I'm interested in one thing
[1:18:17] I've always been to that one part
[1:18:20] you know yourself that I've never been
[1:18:22] negative on anything like that I've
[1:18:24] always been very positive in the worst
[1:18:26] Downs that I've ever been
[1:18:32] I've never been negative about God's
[1:18:34] word
[1:18:38] God is the same
[1:18:41] I might not be able to bring him on the
[1:18:43] scene but you know what
[1:18:45] there's somebody around the world
[1:18:48] have you ever noticed brother Branham we
[1:18:51] want to quote one-sided a lot of time
[1:18:52] you ever noticed that he speaks about
[1:18:55] Billy Graham and going overseas and
[1:18:57] being challenged you know
[1:18:59] and naturally he's first is speaking of
[1:19:01] himself because he said he should have
[1:19:03] called to America
[1:19:07] but he said somebody
[1:19:10] look that up and see if he don't say
[1:19:12] somebody not just him
[1:19:17] somebody
[1:19:19] could have come to the aid
[1:19:25] what are we going to do Church
[1:19:30] when everything is gone out from under
[1:19:32] us and there's no
[1:19:34] no doings on anything oh you're a
[1:19:37] Doomsday
[1:19:40] go right ahead
[1:19:45] don't worry about it
[1:19:48] I used to have enough food in my house
[1:19:49] to feed this church for almost a year
[1:19:53] he got to getting rotten and we had to
[1:19:54] get rid of a lot of it set up a good old
[1:19:56] Pig and hate him
[1:20:00] it's true
[1:20:04] I still say you ought to have a little
[1:20:06] food now
[1:20:07] I still say you ought to have a little
[1:20:09] dire because you know you can't depend
[1:20:10] on the grocery store
[1:20:12] I mean one rush to the grocery store and
[1:20:14] that's ended it'd be good if you sit
[1:20:16] back a couple of cans of pinto beans
[1:20:18] over in the corner of the cabinet
[1:20:20] at least you'd have something to eat
[1:20:25] I don't look for doomsday because I know
[1:20:28] that whatever takes place if he's the
[1:20:31] same
[1:20:31] now here's where we're going to end it
[1:20:33] before you think about it or not
[1:20:35] down in that Dark Ages
[1:20:39] when those people were dying being fed
[1:20:41] to lines being killed and slaughtered
[1:20:44] and
[1:20:46] 68 million of their own records
[1:20:52] read Fox's book of martyr sometime
[1:20:55] but you know what
[1:20:58] sure look gloomy in that day didn't it
[1:21:05] it looked like the man said what said
[1:21:08] how could God set up in heaven and fold
[1:21:10] his arms and allow his church to do that
[1:21:16] he said the man just don't know the word
[1:21:19] do you realize that when they were
[1:21:22] killing all of those Christians
[1:21:24] he was Hebrews 13 8.
[1:21:30] we just don't look at it right
[1:21:38] Peter come along
[1:21:41] and he said I'm not worthy to be hung
[1:21:43] like my master he said turn me upside
[1:21:46] down
[1:21:50] right
[1:21:52] that just turned me upside down
[1:21:58] but yet
[1:21:59] the man had opened the doors lost his
[1:22:02] life
[1:22:03] but you know what Hebrews 13 8 was there
[1:22:07] to take him off the cross
[1:22:12] right
[1:22:15] even a thief hanging on a tree beside of
[1:22:18] our master
[1:22:19] they said Lord remember me
[1:22:23] Hebrews 13 8 was there
[1:22:28] see we look at it like as long as he
[1:22:30] comes on the scene and doing what we ask
[1:22:32] oh yes he's Hebrews 13 8.
[1:22:36] but around him says a no from God is a
[1:22:39] better than all of our yeses
[1:22:41] something to that degree
[1:22:45] what about it
[1:22:52] but yet we think well
[1:22:54] nothing's going on
[1:23:00] the greatest thing
[1:23:02] that has ever been in the world
[1:23:05] is now taking place
[1:23:10] for you and I to be Tried by the word
[1:23:14] is the greatest opportunity
[1:23:17] we could ever have
[1:23:22] may cause some of our Lives what do we
[1:23:24] word
[1:23:25] who's concerned
[1:23:29] right
[1:23:32] Hebrews 13 8. in the worst case you
[1:23:36] could think of
[1:23:40] of any Christian
[1:23:42] or any happening
[1:23:45] and yet he's the same yesterday today
[1:23:47] and forever
[1:23:50] that church had to die and go into the
[1:23:52] ground somebody here has talked like
[1:23:53] that and wonder
[1:23:54] what about the nuts that church had to
[1:23:56] die and go into the ground
[1:23:59] unless the corner of wheat died to
[1:24:00] divide alone that early church had to
[1:24:03] die and go on the ground for you and I
[1:24:04] to be here
[1:24:07] coming back to the original grain
[1:24:11] of the son of man in Bride form
[1:24:15] the greatest day
[1:24:17] could ever be
[1:24:24] Hebrews 13 9.
[1:24:30] Hebrews 13 8 let me pick a couple we'll
[1:24:33] quit
[1:24:40] on the message proof of his resurrection
[1:24:42] he said he's the same in every way that
[1:24:46] he was then
[1:24:50] that he was then
[1:24:52] so if he's ever been he always is
[1:24:56] go ahead
[1:24:58] what did he say
[1:25:00] think on these things
[1:25:03] as well the last couple of quotes or
[1:25:05] three
[1:25:10] he's got to be the same in every way
[1:25:12] except a cardinal body
[1:25:17] you know then he says
[1:25:22] except a car he said
[1:25:24] a Corporal body
[1:25:26] you know and then we go around well look
[1:25:28] at the mistakes you man
[1:25:30] he's ever in every way he was then he's
[1:25:33] still the same
[1:25:37] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:39] forever sirs we would see Jesus
[1:25:42] e22
[1:25:45] if he's raised from the dead the
[1:25:47] infallible Christ then he's just the
[1:25:50] same today that he was he what he ever
[1:25:54] was are the scriptures
[1:25:58] found wrong
[1:26:03] what about it
[1:26:04] you say that he's the same in a certain
[1:26:07] way
[1:26:09] that's still the same message first we
[1:26:11] would see Jesus
[1:26:13] no he's the same the scripture says he's
[1:26:17] the same that was is today and will be
[1:26:21] forever
[1:26:22] same in power same in sign same in
[1:26:25] wonders same in Attitude
[1:26:30] he's got to be the same in every way
[1:26:33] that he was then
[1:26:36] so has he got to be now
[1:26:42] run in this
[1:26:44] Hebrews 13 8 and be ready to
[1:26:50] listen to this one
[1:26:51] Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever
[1:26:54] 1958 223.
[1:26:57] if it's the same Jesus yesterday today
[1:27:01] and forever
[1:27:03] the same same in power
[1:27:06] same in manifestations
[1:27:09] the same in every way he was then
[1:27:13] he is now are the scriptures wrong
[1:27:21] he is now are the scriptures wrong
[1:27:29] just simply doubted
[1:27:32] God
[1:27:34] and the reason she doubted it come on
[1:27:37] you know how I've always preached about
[1:27:38] Eve
[1:27:40] what I believe happened
[1:27:42] she knew about the promise of God that
[1:27:45] was to be brought forth
[1:27:47] I believe it I believe she knew about it
[1:27:53] but Adam just wouldn't tell her nothing
[1:27:56] because I guess in a way Adam didn't
[1:27:57] know nothing
[1:28:00] she was trying to get the promise of God
[1:28:04] to be made manifest
[1:28:07] Satan told her said
[1:28:09] they're withholding that from you
[1:28:13] they're keeping it from you what you
[1:28:14] really would brought you far
[1:28:18] and she said okay I'll just try to get
[1:28:20] underway with what I need to do
[1:28:23] he said well this year is it you see we
[1:28:25] think it was the sex act
[1:28:29] that's all we think about serpent seed
[1:28:31] is a sex act
[1:28:37] the seed of the serpent is no sex
[1:28:41] the seat of the serpent was his life
[1:28:45] that he put into her mind if she doubted
[1:28:47] God's word that he would kill her
[1:28:50] and look even after he didn't kill her
[1:28:54] she went away life and and saying Adam I
[1:28:57] told you we wouldn't die
[1:28:59] and it took three or four hundred years
[1:29:02] but she died
[1:29:09] see Satan's lies that light he's telling
[1:29:11] you and I that's why I wrote around said
[1:29:13] that should be translated instead of Eli
[1:29:15] he said the LIE the same light old Eve
[1:29:20] now let me get it in the right way to
[1:29:22] understand
[1:29:24] he didn't tell her there was a trinity
[1:29:31] right
[1:29:33] he didn't tell her hell was eternal
[1:29:44] he told her
[1:29:45] 99.99 truth
[1:29:53] missing it on Hebrews 13 8.
[1:29:56] I'm honest I don't know how you think a
[1:29:59] lot of people don't like me to make my
[1:30:01] own statements but I don't worry about
[1:30:03] it I make them cut I believe it I could
[1:30:05] think of a lot of other scriptures he
[1:30:07] could have used at that point
[1:30:10] to have emphasized what she done
[1:30:14] can't you
[1:30:19] but he said Hebrews 13 8.
[1:30:26] so when he twisted Hebrews 13 8
[1:30:30] he had everybody
[1:30:32] that would ever come into the world
[1:30:34] outside of the Lord Jesus Christ because
[1:30:37] you know why because he was Hebrews 13.
[1:30:41] when the bride becomes the fullness or
[1:30:43] the godhead bodily
[1:30:45] the prophet told us how that would
[1:30:46] happen no leaven among you brings that
[1:30:49] which no leaven means sin all gone
[1:30:53] unbelief all gone Doubt's all gone
[1:30:58] somebody's going to stand and face Satan
[1:31:04] and say
[1:31:06] sorry oh boy
[1:31:08] you missed it
[1:31:12] but who's going to do it
[1:31:15] come on musicians
[1:31:19] Hebrews 13 8.
[1:31:21] it's just so small of a thing
[1:31:24] that we could think of
[1:31:29] would be the greatest of all things
[1:31:33] but I hope you caught what I was saying
[1:31:37] verse 7 is one that we never read we
[1:31:39] don't want to read verse 7.
[1:31:41] where it says to consider the end of
[1:31:43] their conversation
[1:31:45] and if somebody don't speak to you
[1:31:47] according to Hebrews 13 8 that he's the
[1:31:50] same and then somebody come on well we
[1:31:52] just don't seem healing today say you're
[1:31:55] not
[1:31:55] you're not with Hebrews 13 8 it's going
[1:31:58] to move on
[1:32:05] at least you're to be man and woman
[1:32:07] enough to say as far as I'm concerned
[1:32:14] he never should say this is the way it
[1:32:17] is
[1:32:19] we don't see nothing going on open your
[1:32:22] eyes
[1:32:24] we've seen the dead Rays we've seen the
[1:32:26] sick healed we've seen rain come we've
[1:32:29] seen Rain Go we've seen a lot of things
[1:32:32] take place in this little old building
[1:32:35] since July the 4th 1971.
[1:32:39] a lot of healings and a lot of things
[1:32:42] has taken place
[1:32:44] but a lot of word that's been preached
[1:32:49] that to me proves Hebrews 13 8. more
[1:32:53] than the signs and the Wonders
[1:32:55] it's whether or not the word is preached
[1:32:59] amen let's stand
[1:33:01] 40 47 in the red book
[1:33:05] anybody have a need to order it over
[1:33:09] I
[1:33:10] am weak but Thou Art strong
[1:33:19] Jesus keep me from our own
[1:33:34] as I walked
[1:33:38] in the name of Jesus Christ we send
[1:33:41] these prayer Clause but we believe that
[1:33:43] you're the same yesterday today and that
[1:33:46] whatever we have need of it'll be worked
[1:33:48] out for your honor and Glory
[1:33:50] and we thank you for it We Praise Your
[1:33:53] Great Name In Jesus amen

[1:34:28] all is well because we love you we
[1:34:32] believe him we thank you we believe
[1:34:35] truly that the heart Hebrews 13 8 and if
[1:34:38] you'd be standing here with me you would
[1:34:41] say the same thing
[1:34:42] by your stripes our brother's healed in
[1:34:47] Jesus name
[1:34:51] he said if God was standing here in this
[1:34:58] said he couldn't heal you
[1:35:06] Jesus
[1:35:09] who talks about another job and things
[1:35:12] well let's believe it'll always
[1:35:20] it all would be well we love you in
[1:35:23] Jesus name
[1:35:25] anybody else just believe it
[1:35:29] down
[1:35:31] waiting in my feeble life is all
[1:35:56] right Lord you heard the testimony you
[1:36:00] worked out even the man's jobs and
[1:36:02] worked and the things to make it all
[1:36:03] well because
[1:36:06] he believed you amen and he thanks you
[1:36:09] father who testifies and believes it in
[1:36:13] Jesus name amen
[1:36:24] today
[1:36:26] walking close to thee
[1:36:31] let it be
[1:36:35] in the name of Jesus Christ we were a
[1:36:37] little sacrifice let everything be all
[1:36:40] right because we believe
[1:36:46] just think about it
[1:36:57] the same
[1:37:09] clear Lord remember me
[1:37:14] it's all right
[1:37:32] anybody else would just have a knee
[1:37:36] you just think about it
[1:37:39] whatever he done he'll do let it be
[1:37:43] whatever he was he still is
[1:37:49] it's us that's given the problem
[1:37:53] you ever heard the prophet say this he
[1:37:55] said he just wants one person
[1:37:58] to believe him he said he don't need a
[1:38:01] whole bunch he said just one person to
[1:38:05] believe him
[1:38:08] that's something isn't it
[1:38:11] well now in a way I believe him see that
[1:38:13] won't work
[1:38:15] I hope that won't work
[1:38:22] I heard him talking there one day and it
[1:38:24] really struck me
[1:38:25] he said you know how this visions and
[1:38:29] this thing that works he said
[1:38:32] it's all a revelation
[1:38:35] I thought
[1:38:37] well you know that's right
[1:38:39] God would just reveal to him what was
[1:38:42] wrong with the person
[1:38:44] and tell them their name and all the
[1:38:46] doings and it would be just as real
[1:38:49] there is the Lord telling them that was
[1:38:51] just one God
[1:38:57] never seek God for a revelation
[1:39:02] you ever pray for a revelation
[1:39:07] thank God
[1:39:09] father we thank you for your love and
[1:39:10] your grace unto us tonight Lord we just
[1:39:13] ask you to help us we tried our best to
[1:39:16] express
[1:39:18] what we believe about you because we
[1:39:20] we've always believed that you are real
[1:39:23] and that you want to manifest yourself
[1:39:25] with your people
[1:39:26] and we've never doubted the end of
[1:39:28] little things that would take place that
[1:39:30] we would give honor and glory for those
[1:39:32] small things because they're just as
[1:39:34] great as the larger things
[1:39:36] because there's no negative in you lord
[1:39:39] it's all positive everything is right
[1:39:42] and for you to just touch me with a
[1:39:44] toothache take it away
[1:39:48] that's just as real as it would be to
[1:39:50] raise the dead because it took the same
[1:39:53] God to do it and we just ask your lord
[1:39:57] to help us
[1:39:58] to not forget
[1:40:02] to thank you for everything
[1:40:05] we love you in Jesus name
[1:40:07] excuse me we got one more
[1:40:11] Standing on the Promises of Christ
[1:40:22] the highest I will shout and sing father
[1:40:26] in Jesus name

[1:40:41] over whatever it is in Jesus name
[1:40:45] stand ing
[1:40:54] Standing on the Promises I cannot fail
[1:40:59] when the island storms are down and fear
[1:41:03] a Sail by Living Word of God I shall
[1:41:08] Prevail I'm standing on my promises of
[1:41:13] God
[1:41:16] standing standing
[1:41:20] Standing on the Promises of God my
[1:41:24] savior

[1:41:30] I'm Standing on the Promises of God
[1:41:37] Standing on the Promises I now can see
[1:41:41] perfect present cleansing in the blood
[1:41:45] for me
