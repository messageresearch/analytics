I want to understand you I don't want to just see you I want to understand you because I can see you as a person but I want to understand who you are I want to understand who this man is and we're talking about this man in Christ Jesus there's been a lot of people seen him with their natural lives and didn't believe him but those that understood him knows that understood him they actually saw him Gloria and the way he was supposed to be seen so good to be in the house of the Lord and each and every one of you uh happy to be alive amen amen just be breathing in this day and age works that's right so it is good to be in the house of the Lord it's good to be uh Good to Be Alive good to be in this end time this day and age that uh we need to get some more prayer claws we gotta get some more prayer cloths up here we need some we'll get some but it's good to be with each and every one of you if you got your Bibles let's go ahead and turn the Revelations chapter six and uh kind of continue a thought that we're doing in Sunday school class on the first seal in the Book of Revelations and try to maybe take it at a little different angle than maybe you've heard it before so we'll we'll see because remember when God starts he does something the same way all the time but when Satan starts brother Brown said he changes his tactics but if you can't get you one way he'll try to go around and get you another way but God is one way he doesn't change he doesn't go oops I made a mistake but Satan does Satan tries to get at you from several different ways so I know all of us we already raised our hand but if you got a request on your heart just lift your hand up to the Lord and say Lord I I need something from you tonight let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we pray tonight Lord that you would just touch us be with each one Lord in presence that you would just touch each one in the building finally we all defied the law of gravity by raising our hand Lord and you know the desires of our heart I pray that you'd come Among Us in a special way Lord not to be someone just to sit on the Queue but Lord be an active participant you take over lord not just not just speak the words but Lord actually take the words and make them alive take the words and Quicken them to our heart the Lord that we can take it brother but I don't see we could take that sword and put it right to the heart of the enemy Lord we pray now father that you would just bless the ones that are not here Lord touch them be with them heal them forgive them of their sins Lord the ones that are sending sick and back sled Lord we pray that you will just bring them into the foal fighter this is the late hour that we should not be playing Lord we should be Lord as as we put our heads and our hearts and our feet and our hands to the grinding stone and press toward the mark of the High Calling father we pray that you had just touched the missionaries and we were the bride around the world all the ones that are fighting this fight of Faith Lord the ones that are that Lord that are sick that's called in Lord and around the country father we pray that you just heal each one be with us Lord forgive us of our sins truly Lord we have many but you said you would forgive everyone Lord if we would ask we ask you tonight Lord that you clean our hearts clean our mind clean our ears and take the eyes out of the Holy Spirit and clean our eyes Lord so that we truly can see or understand what you're doing in this end time father just bless us and be with us take care of us in Jesus amen you got your Bibles that turned to Revelations chapter six and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him Behold a white horse and he had settled him at a bowl and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer all right now while you're standing let's turn to Revelations one just flip back over there because I believe in the end time we can look back into the ages and watch what Jesus says to John because remember what is John John is a type of the Bride right right all right because in verse 9 he says I John I'm also your brother now look down verse 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seeest write in the book and send it into the seven Church ages and we know which ones they are let's go over to verse 19 he tells John to write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter verse 17. fear not John I am the first and the last all right you may be seated in the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word if you don't mind flipping back to Revelation 6 that we were starting in the study in the Bible study of course it takes a little bit of time and it's kind of like being a pastor downstairs you can take one Sunday and then another Sunday and another Sunday and another Sunday and you really don't have to to push yourself like we're gonna have to push ourselves tonight I can uh you know relate brother Jim Pinkston you know taking 20 services and put it in one well that's what we're going to try to do we're going to take about four or five of these and put them together and that should be about two and a half hours but I told Brother boy just he said how much time do you need I said just get up and start singing Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord and we'll get started but we have to have the worship service to get us all in mind we know that we have to have it it's not a it's not a option it's a have to we have to have the the service the preliminary service to get our minds clear if not um it'd be a fight in both of our directions mine and yours but remember John types the bride and John was looking here in Revelations 1 and Jesus was telling him said I am the first and I am the last so whatever Jesus was at first Jesus was going to be at the last all right exactly so now and keeping your mind we're not going to try to change anything but listen we know as we've been taught in this church that the seal one seal just one can tie the entire Bible together man right one seal you say well how can I do that well let's see if we can help you understand one of them anyway all right because excuse me in Revelation 6 we start and we see symbols when we see a uh something uh one of the four beasts saying come and see right now we know what beach that was that was a lion man all right now it's kind of strange that when John looked in Revelation 5 he looked for a lamb and he saw a line right so this line just stepped right over and starts opening the seals that's somebody that's already conquered that lion is is the one that done all the that that was there that that just took over brother round said he was bold right even in the first three ages we see that that God took that first three ages and put that lion l-i-o-n not lying lying spirit in those people and they had the pure word of God and they acted on what the word said right all right so guess what if he was Alpha and Omega guess what same thing's got to happen to you and I right man all right now let's understand one thing for sure let's don't do away with all the other seals but you can take this one seal here and take it all the way to the because when this man gets on this horse the prophet said he rides on it rides right into eternity all he done was got off of one horse and changed got on another horse but that white horse just kept riding on exactly because in the fourth seal you're gonna see what is pale it's white red black right right all mixed together so there's white in that pail amen hey man is that okay there's wild in that pail that's what makes that pale right it's white red and black everybody understand so far say amen amen all right so there's one we don't do away with that white horse oh it goes off to sit out of the scene but brother Ryan says underneath right he says inside all that that thing's still working so keep that in your head because remember this is John on the Isle of Palace in 1896 but actually in 80 33 we see this Antichrist Spirit begin to work in the people just as soon as the Holy Ghost fell and made those people on the day of Pentecost a white righteous Church hey man Satan brought his white righteous Church in all right so now let's turn over to Acts 20. to get the character and then we're gonna then we're gonna work our way back because even in Acts 20 Paul is speaking in 80 60. so from 80 33 the Holy Ghost fell then now you've got ad60 you have got this going on watch what he says verse 27. for I have not shown to declare to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost have made you overseers now he didn't say me he said youth right all right made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he had purchased with his own blood amen for I know this that after-minded parting shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the Flop now Paul didn't stop there he said Grievous rules will enter in right in other words right into your congregation but Paul didn't stop there right Paul gets just a little bit personal and says also of your own ourselves shall men arise right out of your own congregation he's bringing it home so you can say oh it's easy to say well we see all this this church coming in and this Catholic church and them trying to think no Paul said that's going to happen but he says also of your own selves exactly shall men arise speak in perverse things to draw away disciples after them right all right so we know that it's not out there it's in here right right all right and actually it's working in people right even brother Branham said then Katie and Katie's Barney we're going to read it in a minute Israel in case born in 1956. he said it was a problem was immense multitude right right that was the problem with the mixed multitude but we get in just a minute let's go to first John 2. get some of these scriptures here but remember Paul didn't know what to name this right but now watch a man that had already went to Patmos and come back here's John the Revelator and the Little John 120 it says in first John 2 18. little children it is the last time right and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come even now are they many antichrists right plural whereby we know that is the last time they went out from us but they but they were not of us or if they had been of us they wouldn't have no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not us all right now go to second John and what did what did he call it he called it Antichrist amen because he had confronted this thing on the Alabama second John 7 I'm sorry second John verse salmon there's only one chapter in the second John second John 7th verse through the tenth for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist right Antichrist look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we will receive a full reward we don't have to read that all right there but we see we see that there's something set here and we see that God is working on his end and Satan is working on his end all right now let's go back to the Book of Revelations to chapter six and I know you've already went through these symbols but guess what we're going to go through them again because we're going to set something here and see what God has forced but give me just a second I want to look at something and then we want to go back through I wanted to read something I think I skipped it that's okay I'm trying to go too fast I guess okay that's all right now go back to Revelation six now we see in Revelation 6 back to the symbol so we're gonna go looking into the symbols and remember one thing power was given to whoever this right guy was this fella power was given to this person he didn't have any power amen so the power was given to him all right and I want you to keep one word in the back of your mind choice choice c-h-o-i-c-e choice that means you're a free moral agent you can make a choice that's right all right okay that's why we're going to see that that and we're just sitting in the back and I kind of didn't know uh brother Dale some of them may know how you started thinking you start at the first sometimes and then you get the ending of it and you don't have nothing in the middle right you know how you're going to start you know how you want to end but Lord has to fill it up so he just did here because I can see now where this first seal started back before time even began see it started way back when Satan made choice right all right but now let's go back and see so that just kind of give you a little something to get bored in between you know what we're heading to all right but back to the symbols the white horse I saw him Behold a white horse now who is talking one of the four beasts which is the lion the lion says come and see all right in other words he's saying enter into this vision and I strongly Behold a white horse now what does that represent a white horse represents a white pure righteous church or a power a horse is a power right that's why they call it horsepower right okay so it's a power and he that sat on him had a boat all right now this bowl we understand did not have any arrows so you can just kind of make a little Mark there Bluff right all right so we understand that but I'm trying to I'm going to make something a little bit later because I want to see I wanted to show and that's what we're going to get to in a Sunday school class that even this first seal we see it produce itself in the end time right we said all that open well the real opening is not going to happen till we get out of here the real man of sin but that Revelations chapter 6 verse 1 starts with the first seal and brother Brown typed him with the first three ages all right so there's your Alpha then you got Omega which is us so you got to bring it where it'll go here and go here I know for a fact that the four seal types the seventh Church age I know that for a fact but I thought we're supposed to be caught out of the ages right bride wasn't in an age exactly all right so we can we cannot parallel this but we can compare right because you know one seal is not the first church age the second Seal's not the second church right all right the first deal and for those of you that that have not been here for a while the first deal you it encompasses the first three ages you listen to brother Brown what you want about the fifth seal he'll go back and start telling you where all these things are you got the first one then you got the the fourth Church age which is your plant Morris then your red horse remember that was the Dark Ages when all the killings were happening then you got the fifth and sixth Church age which was the lion the ox the man which was Lutheran Wesley which was dark which was death which was you know it was something that that uh you had the black you think well boy the the the middle age there when they killed all the Christians would have been that no this one's even worse right because they started making denominations exactly and dying right the fourth age was physically dying right that red was physically it was um blood right but in that fifth and sixth Church age you see that this Rider had come on and made and called himself death now because what happened they started taking denominational ideas and brother Brown said they died by the billion spiritually which is worse than what happened in the fourth age and in the last age which is the eagle age which is your seventh Church age so maybe that kind of gives you a little little uh part of what we're doing but what a bow and a crown was given right so in other words he didn't have one huh if I give brother Donnie my knife he didn't have it previously but now I give it to him right all right so I give it to him you gave it to me to start with so I'm just giving it back to him I want him back after service now what he's got something to work with right before he didn't so now he's so now you got the white righteous church that starts out in the first church age you've got a man sitting on a horse with a bow a symbol of power I said a symbol of power it's not power but a symbol of power now we don't go hunting with just a bowl we have Arrows with it right and I know you know brother Gary's not here tonight but uh he always makes mention that that this man sitting on here has a bow and we give him all the arrows to shoot at us which is exactly the truth because he has no power but Power was given read all those seals I I have circled each one down here in chapter six power was given to this person to do something right he didn't have the power to start with right that's why we're going to parallel you say well well where did all this start it started before the time began we just said but now there's something else that this person does he says a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering right which was right then right and two conquer right later on so he didn't stop in that first church age conquering he conquered the people in the church age and he continued Conquering the people right all right to come conquering and to conquer in other words he furthered his Doctrine he went on Through the Ages on that same White Horse right all right now all right so the word conquering means to overcome look how shrewd Satan is because see you can take all these symbols yeah and you see that we are a white righteous church we are the Bride of Jesus Christ is white righteous church amen they're the real white righteous Church all right but we're given a sword which is the word of God and we're given Crown but it's a crown of of eternal life right and we do go forth conquering that's my brother around this was so close that that Prophet preached in 1957 he preached the mighty conqueror and he read Revelation 6 verse 1 and 2. all right as being the holy ghost riding out right conquering and con to conquer the people not knowing that underneath there Satan was working his little deal all right but see when you get to the true opening of the seal when you open a seal that means that when you open a seal in a truck when we have a uh a truck come in we have to make sure that seal is the is correct on the bill of lading and if it's the correct seal which has a number on it then we break it and guess what happens we see what's inside all right so when that seal breaks you can see what's inside all right so that's what was happening is when when this these sealed were being opened brother Brandon God allowed him to open that seal and look inside and see what man had not looked on remember he he told us the vision of the pyramid right when he whipped that top off what did he do he said I saw words that man had never seen before in other words they were there the whole time but man had never seen it right but when he whipped that top off he was able to see that all right so Satan has been working since the beginning of time amen and and God's been working since the beginning of time but we get the real part and he has the perverty part right all right so now remember this power was given all right the word conquering means to overcome or to subdue listen to this think of what happened in those first few ages because remember the third age ended at 606. it's kind of strange and ended it and I said yeah the third age ended at 606 when when I see it that last Nicene Council come into being that's when the last age stopped and we know there's an overlap there but if you look in your church age book I looked it up and that's when it ended but listen to this opposition or resistance of the will what is a whale yeah choice right opposition or resistance of the will by moral Force it's better to serve God they said oh yeah he's trying to kiss that cross Bears serve God better to kill him than to let them die you know Infidel that's what the Catholic Church said listen to this overcome by argument what they do it and I said they argue brother Brown said they should have never went to not seeing and argued right right all right persuasion overcome by argument persuasion or other influences all right now remember to me that all sums up into a choice there was a choice being made right or wrong but the choice looked right oh yeah the choice looked right sure to the ones that chose this white righteous church with a pope and give him a crown and give him power and all the things like that they thought they'd made the right choice so now this is kind of where I kind of got bogged down a little bit but uh instead of sitting back there studying a little bit ago and the Lord just brought it back to my memory that this seal began in heaven it began in heaven it didn't begin down here in in 1896 it didn't begin in 80 33. he began in heaven before the foundation of the world right right because you had a white angel Satan's not red with all right we had the uh horns and a tail and he doesn't wear a red jumpsuit this guy is a white righteous Angel right that can imitate anything God has except one thing Satan cannot duplicate himself or create right all right he only perverts so keep that in your mind because this we're bringing it right down all right but this seal began in heaven and this seal I believe this seal ties in the entire Bible together because it it shows the choice of man because the the denominations didn't cease they're going to go all the way through to the white Throne judgment that denominational idea not a Methodist Baptist Pentecostal prison I'm talking about denominational ideas because you don't understand one thing I'm not putting those in there Methodist I'm just saying denominational idea it's going to go right into the lights on judgment because what it's going to do is is the foolish version anyone's giving eternal life are going to be called in that group right all right so now this one seal pies the entire Bible together what happened when God brought a white righteous Adam and Eve to the Garden of Eden Satan comes right now oh yeah and what does he do he conquered Eve right right by bluffing her into believing he had the right idea sure because remember a bow with no arrows Satan has no power unless you give it to him amen now he bluffed her into believing he so bluffed her into believing that this Beast was going to produce what God yeah wanted her to produce oh yeah I'm talking about a natural Beast standing right here in the Garden of Eden because remember it starts with a beast in the garden and it ends with a beast in the end time right all right Satan Superman well the only part with this man is is this this Beast here didn't have this Beast didn't have a soul right all right this speaks over here is going to have us all right all right see how he's progressed but should I stay back into the end of the first seal though but he conquered Eve by bluffing her into believing that he could reproduce himself oh yeah thinking she's reproducing God but she's reproducing Satan right Satan had no power he had a bowl right he had a beast but he had no seeds right Satan had no literal seed it's not Satan seed it's the serpent seed that did the act the actual C you understand what I'm saying amen yeah so he perverted what God had shown to be true with all the animals Satan just perverted what he had right there's that first seal that white righteous man standing in that garden with the true white righteous church that first church age wasn't fault Paul Peter James John uh all the ones in the old in the New Testament in the book of Acts that was a white righteous church that was God's church that was the church he wanted right he wanted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden Pure white people sure now I'm not meaning why and why I'm talking about white isn't pure right all right pure people but Satan comes in and he starts bluffing Eve oh yeah you'll not surely die surely die you're not say Satan is a smart guy but now watch as it comes down a little bit further so he comes in as as a pure White He's Just Gonna Save the whole world he's going to talk even to doing this thing that's so hideous but he's believing it all right we know what happened I mean she had a relation with a part animal yeah all right think about that right but then what was Satan's crowning moment when that Beast did what he did it produced a child but that Crown Satan that put him down on the Earth where he could do something he got into Cain and he started working he got it see how that seal it doesn't matter better you can run this thing all the way through look at nimrod Nimrod was a Big King he was a hunter sure he got him a bow and some arrows yeah he started preaching that we're gonna make our way to Heaven by building the building yeah right you see how Satan is we're gonna go right back up to heaven he got cast out so he's wanting to go back pretty good cast out he got cast out down here and then all that ends up into a pope in the end time same seal same devil same white righteous church right all right then what was Judas Judas didn't was not in the pub he was in church white righteous Church the only church there was Judas was a part of it right Keith it was going to church Jesus walked in the Church of the day and said hypocrite yeah child of the devil he was Torn to Pieces so he was the only original Church there was and here's the 12 following it and there was Satan's standing right there in that white righteous Church right but Judas fit the match perfectly he blessed them people into believing that he was a part of that white racist Church so there's the same characteristics right he was a bluff brother then he bluffed it all 11 during the time of the of the Lord's Supper is it me is it me is it me is it me brother Brown said they thought Judas was just going to go out and pay the bill pay the grocery bill he had blessed them so much Satan was so close to that white righteous Church even in that day of the man himself Jesus standing there he had got himself so close and the Bible said Daddy read it this uh Sunday Satan entered in to the heart of Judas yeah and he went and done what he done that was Satan's crowning moment all right so now we're gonna go back and look and I want you to see now that we have the pattern we have a white righteous Church true and false all right Satan's trying to Bluff us we have the sword the word of God but he has a bowl with no arrows right he's blessing he's been a bluff the whole time amen if we understand that we'll understand how to get out of here right all right but when I get into that now and then also there was a crown given a crown means Authority and we always think of a crown and I thought about this and I looked it up and it's true we think of a crown as some big golden extravagant crown you know what a crown really is a crown could be just a wreath placed over your head that's a crown so it doesn't have to be something that's extravagant because you and I are going to be crowned and I looked it up in a strong concordance and when you and I are crowned Kings and Priests that's what it is it's not an extra extrapolate that clown it's a wreath and what does a reef represent peace peace that's what you and I are going to be crowning we're going to be crowned with peace and joy and all those things of God not crowned like this Satan is going to be crowned his Superman is going to be crowned in this end time and he's going to exalt himself exactly he's going to exalt himself above God he said all right so let's go to Second Thessalonians because that's where this man can be described enough that we can at least get a glimpse of what we're dealing with right and I believe you know the Bible the Bible proves it true second Thessalonians 2. that you and I are not going to be exempt from Satan's bluffing or whatever you want to call it but we'll know how to overcome it right amen because you know what even going out conquer and conquering gunkering you and I that's why brother Brandon could preach the mighty conqueror and he could weave that thing right in there where you and I come in and God conquers our our fears and he conquers our our you know like brother Jim paint someone's talking about fear you know that's something we need to conquer and human beings can't conquer fear right it's just imbred in us that we fear all right so who has to do it God has to break that fear God God said I'm not giving you the spirit of fear understand mine remember like like brother Jim was preaching but in second Thessalonians 2 verse one now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him remember we sing that song we're gathering together into him that you be not soon shaken in mind now what's Paul doing Paul is telling the people hang on a medicine to shake you because he says that ye be not soon shaken in mine not in body but in mine that you be not shaken or be troubled or can I say fear neither my spirit right nor by word nor by letter exactly as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let an old man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come what the day of Christ the day of Christ shall not come that's the day that's the only day you and I need to worry about anyway right for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin m-a-n not Spirit man right be revealed are made known the son of perdition oh yeah now there's only one time that this is going to happen in its fullness that's today this is the day of Christ the day of Christ has been since the day of Pentecost right in 1833 but this is the day that in Matthew 24 and about uh up there in the first part of it about four or five Matthew 24 5 he says beware of false Christ right beware they're coming beware if somebody tells you say look beware there's a curvy Road what's she he's telling you it's there right all right so now let's read the rest of this who opposed it and exalt this himself above all that is called God you know I was thinking the other day there's a scripture and that's what I was looking for there's a scripture in here somewhere we may get to it in just a minute we may not I may not be able to find it in my ignorance I probably didn't even write it down but remember the Bible talks about the Holy One of Israel yeah it doesn't say the holy tube Israel the Holy three of the Israel or the holy third person of Israel it says the Holy One right so there's only one guy the Holy One of Israel right so there's only one God but there's somebody that's real close this man right here who opposes an exaltive right himself above above all that's called God right now let's just for an example brother Alice God's right here he wants to be above God you and I want to be God made manifest we don't want to be above God right you see where he wants to be right above all that is called God or that is worshiped right he had to have that in there because he's the worship angel all right so that he has done it in the temple of God there's only one Temple that God ever cared about and that's your heart that's right that's right right not a Stone Temple he told them remember Brenda Claus was preaching they brought him up to this great big Temple and they said oh my oh you're gonna walk in this Temple and you're going to anoint it like it days of Solomon and we're just going to have a big time and he'll turn around and look and he said they want one stone be left on another guy in other words this thing's going to be obliterated and they built it and built the walls and tore them down built the wall that's not even what he's talking about right well Tim God don't want to be in your house physical he wants to be in your house spiritually wants to be in your heart okay so when he says he wants to be in the temple of God that's where he wanted to be with Adam and Eve he wanted to get inside them but he couldn't do it but he got the outside he made it fall he made the outside person fall okay the fall of Man was not in the soul of man Adam and Eve Soul didn't fall but the ability for them to be God on on the face of this Earth was done away with amen or hidden until this end time all right now but now remember it wasn't done away with I'm sorry it was hidden but you can't do away with anything that God says because you and I are going to inherit this Earth in flesh eternally all right so you can't stop that that's going to happen who opposes himself and steps in both anything that's called God or that is worship so that he asked God sits in the temple of God and he doesn't just sit there he's showing himself amen right in other words Brother Anderson he's active he's showing himself foreign not like him he is God in other words he's saying I'm the one you need to worship right Now isn't that what he told Eve if you can't produce this that your God is telling you I'm going to show you how to produce this over here that I'll be the one that tells you remember he's exalting himself above everything exactly all right think about this this is right here people I'm gonna read something Israel Katie's Barnett it's gonna probably shake his shoes off so you might as well go ahead and take him off now remember you're not pause it and now you know right what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time because that falling away is not going to be and let me let me be real plain I know this goes out on the internet but Jesus said fear not little flock right message churches are getting so full they're having to build these great big buildings right that's the falling away that Paul is telling the people to watch out for didn't he tell the women in the scripture that if they commit adultery that they are dead while they are living setting in a message Pew believing the message but have no clue about Christ right no clue about what's going on and not just a message of the hour you know let's think about this this morning tried to say it the right way Christianity actually what I was doing I was reading this book and brother Branham I think it may be either Israel or Cadence Barney or another one I was reading but this morning I was sitting at work and reading about the shunamite woman and then brother Bradham said remember the old black the black girl black lady now brother Brown said she knew God she was a Christian woman and she was just connected to God brother Brown just talked about her and talked about remember the black woman that met him said God where's my Elijah you gave me a child now he's dying to work my Lodge remember God grounded that airplane here's what struck me in this is this is so simple brother Brown said lady have you ever heard of me I'm Reverend William Branham she said no Parson I ain't never heard anything right yeah she was a Christian yeah and she's never heard of brother Brown I think what we've done is we put the message in Christianity they figure in the message you're a Christian I think we need to become a Christian first and then getting a message the problem is we've become message Believers and it's covered all this other stuff right because brother Brown said the problem and this first seal the problem is that mystery of iniquity we're going to read it in just a minute all that underlying sin and brother round just like brother Dale said last Sunday that underlying sin is not I hope we're away from smoking and drinking and cussing and running around if you're still doing that you're lost let me just look at you and tell you if you keep doing that you're lost right right you smoke you drink you curse you run around you do the things that you used to do you're lost right right you don't come to church like you should you're lost right anybody understand that amen you're lost you just lost I wish somebody could say you know told me one day said look you're lost but I came in my time I should have come right that's why that uh I know sometimes mom gets on to me for not being a little hard trying to get my kids but you know what it didn't help me a bit either mom she talked to me about the Lord you know all the time and Dad just sat there you know and he's shaking his head knowing that I was coming but you know still you had to have that little motivator in there you know and and I just kind of I can't save them I can't save my kid you can't save your kids but you can pray for him all right you can do like rather brand upstairs if you enter in he said that's high that people get healed I enter into what they're he said they're humans remember he told about talked about the man that that said I'm gonna kill you remember the big guy that's going to kill him in Oregon big tall guy he said he could do it he said but I love that man so much he said God that man's got a family that man's got children and if he wasn't possessed he would be fine and when that love projected Grace took over and that man fell in his feet so maybe what we need to do is is when all of our family is all riled up just do the same thing say God if it wasn't the only difference in you in the center is is you got God in your life right that's the only difference right that's what I'm saying about this right here the only difference between God and the devil is that God can get in your soul and change you and Satan perverts you he can't make your soul God makes your soul but Satan perverts your soul right it lays right in there so close but the choice is yours to get that thing off of you or leave it on you right throughout the day of judgment God's going to say I created you perfect I created you perfectly man exactly Judas I created you perfect Adolf Hitler right but you let Satan pervert right what I gave you kind of simple to me right getting off the subject a little bit second Thessalonians let's get back remember you now that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what would hold it what is it what's withholding right it's got to be a fallen away first not falling away of people leaving the church and that's going to happen when that mixed multitude went to Cadence barnia many of the separation dogs that separate yourselves right you all gonna go through the Wilderness you all gonna die but Joshua and Caleb were still in that group right and those young boys and all girls that were born during that time were still in that group right and God said you're going to make it but you're not right it was a dividing time brother Graham said they made their choice that Katie's burned in all right same way with you and I the dog's gonna let us go on and on and on and on and on they sin ten times we send probably 10 000 but one day he's going to say all right that's enough you even make the choice today right are you your plate will be sealed all right listen and now you know what withhold is that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity does already work only he who now let us will let until he be taken out of the way now to save time I don't want to be too long tonight we're going to if you'll go to page 116 of the seal book I told him down to Sunday school class I said only a prophet right could interpret that scripture right there amen that had to be God interpreting that scripture let's read it let's read it like a that's really not me and you would read it yeah but the mystery of iniquity is always already worked only he who this man of sin we'll let it now let it will land until he be taken out of the way he he who do you want to dismantle sin he's probably talking about he's talking about this man I'm saying amen but a prophet comes along and gives us the mystery the mystery is that only he God this is your Prophet we must believe what he said amen because that he is not capital his head right it's even hidden remember what you preached about the he the the capitals and all God even hid that from the scholars right so that it can be revealed in the end time by a little Prophet do only he god brother Brown said who now let it will let in other words God is going to let this thing why didn't God just when when Satan did what he did before the before he even creating anything why didn't God just say Satan don't do away with it destroy him he spoke him into his Essence he surely can speak him out right but I told the Sunday school class you ever thought about this God there's a gentleman oh yeah brother Brown said the Holy Ghost was a timid person right and you go back to the law of God and the law of God is in a mouth of two or three Witnesses let everything he didn't say he didn't make stipulation he said let everything be established in the mouth of two or three Witnesses isn't that correct right that's what the Bible says God allowed this to happen to prove to Satan that he could do what he said he was going to do between me and you that ought to make us so humble right glorious so because here you've got the two most powerful people in the world that's ever been God and the devil and to God's look and God's looking at Satan and going to see them you did what you were going to do you perverted what I built but look at them in the mouth of two or three Witnesses God and us that's two are going to witness against that one man Satan that he can do what he said he was going to do because it said right there it said he who let it will let until he brother Brown said he he said Christ the bride amen be taken out of the way now we're always taught that the Bride is a sheep but then we had a little Prophet putting quotes together here we have a little Prophet that says now she is him how God put that mystery right there that one script that ought to make us just blow Fusion for the mystery of iniquity does already work Paul said this is what's going to happen what's this only he who now let us will let God is letting this thing run out for us until you and I be taken out of the way all right and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth who are we we're the final voice to the final age he's going to do it through you and I this is how he's going to do it exactly this is how he's going to do it he's laying the whole plan right here and he's telling us how to do it right and then shall that Wicked be revealed now if somebody asked a question downstairs why is that Wicked capital on that one well that's not a mystery anymore we know who that one is all right it's the wicked one all right that's how God writes his word we just have to go by it Glory we could be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming amen now if you'll go over to about Isaiah 30 we know that in the end time that the light of the Moon the light of the Sun is going to be seven times brighter in the end time and the moon's going to be the same light as the sun remember when the scripture we're about where the towers fall but in the end time let's read it I know somebody look at me like I'm crazy but let's read it let's just settle it Isaiah 30. I believe it is yes Isaiah 30 right and 25. listen to this and there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every High Hill rivers and streams of water and the day of the great Slaughter when the towers fall right 9 11. all right moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the Sun and the light of the sun shall be Sevenfold amen as the light of seven days in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach where we've been hearing about a breach I've been away since five he's going to bind up the breach of his people and heal the stroke of their wound that only one wound people and that's death you say oh cancer no what does it take you to if it continues in its track it takes you to death there's only one thing to be destroyed and that's death not cancer not stroke not heart attacks is on one thing to be destroyed that's death amen all right healed and a stroke of their womb so you see now that the light of the moon now the Moon is a type of who the bride right the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the Sun is going to be seven times brighter amen so we're going to destroy him with seven times the brightness of his coming because who is his coming you and I are is coming all right the coming of the Lord is right here there's not a physical coming of the Lord to you and me physical body man standing here he's going to be inside of you and me right yeah and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan and that s is capital two there with all power and signs away wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not now listen I'm reading this to the people downstairs and some of them some of them caught this right because they didn't let me read it like this let's just bring it up today because they received the message but not the love of the message the Bible says because they receive not he didn't say they didn't receive the truth read it look down and win your own eyes and look at it they didn't receive it says because they received not the love of the truth right he didn't say they didn't receive the truth they got the truth but they didn't receive the love of the truth that they might be saved because if you receive the love of the truth you will be saved right that is the love of God and for this cause God shall send them the church strong delusion that they should believe a lie now you know the prophet said that should be the light right the one he told Eve now he'll go right back to the Garden that they all might be down who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness now look we won't read the sailboat just for time will kind of wind us down this is I'm going to bring it all together now second Thessalonians Paul is prophesying he sees the starting of this in his age right because what this is was is that day of Christ when he starts talking about the day of Christ I can see Paul just preaching about the day of crisis at hand because that's what he says in verse two as that the day of Christ is at hand and everybody like brothers did everybody thought well the Lord's coming in Paul's age but Paul said no let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come until there be a falling away first in other words it's not going to happen in my age exactly there's going to be a great Falling Away not not the fourth age when they got killed that's not a falling away the great falling away is when you're setting a message to you and dry up and blow away all right that man of sin be revealed a son of perdition and I wrote in my Bible the only way you can be revealed is by the message of the hour right that's the only way he'll be revealed by the message of the hour all right because now look now we're going to finish up them the same way that we began because the way we began was what white a bluff White Horse white righteous Church a bluff meant a bowl with no error and a crown was given all right so now that was what started it and what's going to end up we know it's a Pale Horse but like I said before inside that Pale Horse it's still that white guy in that white horse and why horses riding all right brother Ramsey he said he just gets off that horse and gets on another horse but the horse just keeps going what there's the power and that power got in the people and the power got into people they didn't get out of them it stayed in them right all right unless they did what confess their sin right and become filled with the Holy Ghost right that's the only way that you drive that white that white horse away from me it's like what brother Brown you know like like he would say here stands a lamb well brothers and sisters the lamb is the Holy Ghost remember he said the lamb Christ and the Holy Ghost is a self-saint person so there stood the lamb Christ the Holy Ghost there was no way for that white righteous looking horse to ride into that profit it had to right away from me all right now you say oh that's good for a prophet what about me and you what about me and you people because the seals are for Redemption of the body right we've got to see that that man of sin doesn't have his greasy fingers on it right that's right okay because as long as he lets you yeah I think lydie's got a whole guess where it starts right here all right look Satan changes from white to Red to Black to pale but God never changes he started as a white church he's going to end as a white church he started on a wild horse he's going to end in on a lot more he's gonna have his subjects with him but God never changes he's going to have a church but tonight guess what's happening tonight two hundred thousand thousand demons are riding on those horses exactly right through this building tonight right right through this building sure because they're not out there riding they're not out there in Buicks and Cadillacs they're in they're right where the bride is riding right along beside of them right right here with us all right I'll read you something in just a minute but remember this mystery of iniquity is not remember iniquity is a hideous sin but it's not what you think it is it's not being a pervert or something like that that's not a hideous sin to God I want to read to you in Israel that Katie sparnia on page 11 paragraph 54. do you see it what am I trying to get it that get at is get at is this the greatest sin I find in the church today is unbelief right that's the only sin there is there's no other sin but unbelief he said how much of that is not out there how much is dark you couldn't say this much is dark right from my hands it's all dark now there's only one way to designate and determine sin it isn't whether you drink or whether you smoke or gamble it's it's designated this way because you're an unbeliever is because you do that all right listen now this is your profit page 13 paragraph 64. now I want you to know that when the phenomenon was done Miracles were before signing wonders and when they went out it's multitude one out a mixed group of people play a horse next Pale Horse is a mixed group okay and some white some red some black they make a pale some of them Believers some pretending to believe the great Miracles had been done people went out and they thought about israelit case fournette people went out as professed Believers and they were not Believers and that's where a great bunch of our trouble lays today we could put our finger on it is men and women who come into church and prevent profess to be Believers and they're not Believers I found it in the pulpit so we're not exempt I found it in the prayer line I found it everywhere where men come in and women and say I am a believer and profess to be a believer oh yeah and they're not right amen paragraph 70. you who profess Christianity you who live in your churches you have no memory we have no members here you just come here you belong to all different churches are you people who profess to be Christians and then live something else like that you're not you're a detriment to the Society of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you who profess profess to be Christians and are ashamed to take him at his word or testify to his power and Glory many times you're a detriment to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's true that's right stand to the word sink her down stand on his word right he was actually preaching this in Jeffersonville he wasn't preaching this somewhere else he was preaching to his own people all right one more I think nope and that one's it no I got one more Negative they begin to murmur and complain and finally they brought to kadish and when they come to cadish this judgment seat now all the whole thing was gathered together and some glorious day and I believe that day is at hand right now when there will be a separation between the right and Rome amen what's going to happen is you got that white righteous church still riding white pure righteous right all right then you've got the true there always is the truth okay right okay and then they copy after them all right well watch it started with the white righteous church it's going to end with a real righteous Church don't be don't be fooled by this this you say well this seal is is telling us who's the Antichrist is no I believe it's telling us who we are glory and it's showing us that the opposition is exposing who he is it's telling us hey I've got problems in my life I'm not living the way I ought to live because that white righteous church is not out there it's right here it's close it's not out there and when you hear a false Doctrine what does that do right that bless you Satan is bluffing you into believing that that has power in it look at all these people going around the country preaching these false doctrines look at the power behind them people just Revel in it they just love the inmates it just be uh I mean my Lord somebody come out and preach that that polygamy was the seventh seal and and all these things that they're preaching I promise you one thing they're blessing something somebody's following it they're bluffing some sister at them because I'm just contending with one and that's about it one wife I mean not two or three that'd have to be a real Revelation yeah but I needed two or three no but you see that you see now how Satan know it's come right into the church and just Twisted just a little bit of it and put the put that thought and bluffing them people into believing that that he said believe a lie and be down by it you remember what we just read believe alike that's where that man of sin is setting people he's not setting in a denominational church right he's sitting in the church right here our church this church this building this temple of God right he's so close he said it would even try to deceive the very elect it would be so close right all right but we're starting here and we watch this Pope come over here and become incarnate Satan right after we become incarnate God right because Satan that's that see let me tell you something let me just give you a little something to go on this afternoon this evening Satan is watching me and you oh yeah right he knows for a fact that he can't get into God's mind but he didn't get into yours you can't get into that Mind Of God he cannot do that it's good to be born again he can understand all the mystery but he's watching and remember he's copying behind everything that that have that God does he's copying right behind it and he's watching me and you he does not know how to Incarnate human flesh yet but when God comes down and incarnates me and you and we take a body change and get out of here and say brother Brown said we go up Satan comes down right why does he come down because he can't stand being up there anymore he's going to come down here because he's working right in here on us right now but when we take a body change don't you think when we take a body chain we're gonna have a problem with this guy because this is going to be Pauline said let us have a mind of Christ now what about having a mind of Christ when we take a body chain because we'll have a body like into his glorious body it's not going to be that I'm gonna have a brain that thinks bad thoughts no we're going to be incarnate God right Satan's going to come down and be incarnate Satan showing himself that he is gone having signs and wonders just think about what's going to happen when that Pope is just totally incarnate when you get a man look what he does to a man now that he just anoints yeah look what he does to people that he just anoints the Hideous things that they do think about what he's going to do when he has complete control man right over a human man that thinks that he's still religious Apex and he's going to just rule the whole world yeah but you know what that baby form of that man is working on me and you right now right that baby form he always starts as a baby and he's working on us telling us things telling us all these things that we should do and shouldn't do all right so now in the end the only way that man of sin is to be revealed brother Mark is for him to be out there right just like we said right here he's showing himself to be asked God sitting in a temple of God showing himself sitting in the temple of God but brother Lord when that when that when that man of sin goes out he can be revealed or shown oh yeah and then we can understand and that's what's happening now with the message I believe now we're understanding more not more of of the devil but once we know more of God right it exposes the vice versa of what of what the devil is it because I know one thing's for sure if the Bible tells us that we need to be in church every service when the door is open and I do the vice versa you know what I'm listening to and more so the Bible says you need to be here that's what they approaches okay same way with the word of God should we be doing this over here if it's contrary to what the word says you want to know one thing's for sure that's that's why that that I don't believe in sinless Perfection but I believe one thing's for sure if you sin you know it real quick right that's right amen and you you ask forgiveness but see when you were a sinner what did you do you just sinned you just did it wow because it was a part of the nature that you had there was no yeah sure you had a convention but you just kind of passed it off but now if your sin is a Christian you want to get that thing out quick amen well you want that thing to ride away from you why because something's been made known to you this word of God has made something known to you clicking something in your heart every Sunday we sit here listen we ought to know that something's quicker than something man boiling up inside of our heart and not sat there and say well I've heard that 25 times it should not be that way people right right so the Alpha and Omega that first seal we know it shows one trillion Living God we know that man we're going to try to just stay on this one the the mystery of iniquity the mystery that man of sin knowing that he's going to do this he's going to start right here and he's going to end right here right but God started right here with the church on the day of Pentecost and he's going to end right here with the church just like the one on the death Pentecost but this church right here let me just be honest this church right here didn't have that mystery of iniquity right and be able to name that man out of the word of God like you are glory in time that's right everybody understand that's the difference that's why they didn't take a body change right call that land of sin was not revealed to them right he was still working in what in these people Paul Lord he comes up to a church and and the church has got a a man living with his mother-in-law and and in the book of Corinthians and they all messed up what Satan got in there and just started weaving his web right right in amongst the Christian people right okay the Christian people this book is written to Christian people man right all right this book this book is written to Christian people they're not written to unbelievers it's written to True Believer and the things they didn't hear you sometimes you scratch your head and wonder how it happened but that's what the grace of God takes over but that's where that God knew that this out bride the only problem they had was is they fell away from their first love remember that's what he says in the scripture these fell away from their first love if you and I fall away from this love on this side there's no other age there's nothing else to pick you up people right there was an age over here that started in Paul Grievous wolves came in then ireneas came in and picked that word up and challenged the people to believe again what something picked back up right that's the way it happened remember in the church ages they come when brother Brown said when when the age would start going toward the end they start falling down God had raised up a quarter a man to stand in between and say hey you've Fallen away from your first love get back in line right there's no other age there's no other time this is the day of Christ people it says here the day of Christ is at hand we're not changing this scripture but I'm telling you the day of Christ is here amen during this time of Paul's time yes it's absolutely was at hand it was coming right right Paul was prophesying of a day coming that you and I would be sitting here it's like I said musicians come so like I said when we were reading a little bit through the seal book brother Branham gets over to the um questions and answers and he tells him he said this is all gone from you I was hoping you'd catch something all during the week right he said this is all gone from you he said in other words he said well he did say it in his words he said it's going from you and there's no way for you to get it right now I told him in the same school class I said God was speaking through brother Branham telling those people what did he tell him he didn't say hey you're all lost you're going to hell no he said live a good simple Christian Life he said go on as you you know in other words he was telling him about like he did marriage and divorce go on as you are live a good simple Christian Life God's Made A Way well the way for those people was a grave because they didn't catch what was going on brother Brown said I wished you were those hope someone would raise up and say I see what was going on but nobody did right so he said hey in other words he said this is for another group of people right and then he went into the talking about radio and in the old cars now they have transitioned I mean they have the motherboards and computers and all that back when brother Brandon was alive in the 60s the old radio dials there was actually a diamond crystal inside that radio and when that signal would come in it had to be cut a certain way it was a little tiny but there was that's why you had megahertz and things like that that radio wave would come into that radio and when you turn that down what you were doing you were turning the dial the transistor you were turning the dial I wish Aaron well here he could tell you what was going but you turn that dial over to this diamond and that's where you picked up 55.5 which is a station here in town then you'd roll that down a little bit further well there was another Crystal over here on this side that was cut a little different way and you can pick up am 600 or 650 or 660 or 1200. never understand that's how the old radio used to be right now you got all these you know that wouldn't be a type but brother Brown was saying look he said there's radio waves going through this room right yeah and he said if you have the right receptor in other words if you can get it to the right Channel am 55 will drop right down on that radio and start playing the music or if you turned it out a little bit further to 660 that's a sports channel now you get Sports everybody understand what I'm saying brother Brown was telling those people he said the right Diamond's not here yet yeah in other words the right station God's got you dialed in you're a Christian you're born again you're going to make it to Heaven Brother Gary everything's all right he said but what I'm preaching to you is not on your radio dial it's not on your frequency but there's got to be a but for him to be able to speak it God said I'll throw it out there and it will not return void God just went right on in about 40 something years later he just turned it down and he found the right diamond right me and you last night amen yeah get Matthew the radio away wave getting it it's going from you there's no way in the world Bible in front of my head I know what it is it's been told you before right so just don't try to put any interpretation but just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour we're living in a Time now you just be real humble be a Christian and try to try to find you then he goes on and he explains I'm not ready why would you explain to my radio yeah why don't you explain about things going through right going through the Tabernacle what was going through the Tabernacle the word of God was going into Tabernacle he just wasn't falling on them yet amen but it did return void it accomplished one day a group of people right stay standing here in in this church in this time and this day of the Lord now it's gonna flip over one day and you're gonna catch right you're apart because we're all diamonds right but we're all cut just a little bit different way but when that radio wave comes down you know what you're going to say one day I see it amen nobody in that church could stand up and say I see it right man hey you and I can stand up and say I see it amen I see the end of all things exactly because the seventh seal that's what it is and that's what takes that first seal and shows the first seal that first seal you just like I said you can take that first seal and none of the other ones and prove that God is going to do what he said he's going to do amen because if that man of sin is revealed that means he has gone away from you and you can take a body change Glory that's why that Seal's important people that first seal is important we're going to spend a lot of time downstairs we haven't got into all that we need to get into we didn't tonight I just want you to to kind of understand that that let's just don't say well here's seal number one and throw it way over here now let's go to seal number two now seal number one I believe I thought God was eternal right I thought what God Said was eternal I thought the word of God was eternal right so that seal didn't stop over here it wasn't just for the first three ages well Mark that seal when it opened if that white horse rode out into eternity guess what's going right out of the end of Eternity the word of God is what we went riding out into eternity all right let's sing one more song foreign foreign years ago in Louisiana brother Danny stayman was preaching and there were 600 kids sitting in the in the auditorium brother Danny's good you know with the kids he was talking about how that Satan wouldn't come and you know talk to him and how nobody was immune and it made a great example and it stuck with a lot of the kids even to this day he said preachers he said stand up all the preachers in the building stood up myself and several others today it was probably about 25 others scattered out in the congregation another Danny said all right I want you to sit down I want you to sit down if you've never had a bad thought he said I want you to sit down if you've never if you if you've been praying for somebody to receive the holy ghost or to receive their healing and had a dirty thought I want you to sit down if you've never had that I want you to sit down all 20 still stood at that time all the kids are going like this and the disbelief in their in their eyes that we were not immune yeah to the devil he said all right he said I want you to all he said I want all you preachers to sit down that's never had a bad thought run through your mind while you were preaching the pure word of God yeah all 20 States standing up the kids are really getting excited now he said see there he said even the ones that you thought never had any problems I have a problem and don't think that you're alone brother random how do I keep these bad thoughts from going through my head he said you can't right he said but he made the example he said you can't hurt you can't help the birds flying over your head but you can help that they don't make a mess in it in other words that they don't stay there long enough to make something to motivate you people Satan is going if he can destroy us he's got he has destroyed God if he's destroyed us he's destroyed God because if he can get us he can still keep bluffing right and still keep blessing and still keep blessing so it's do you think you got you don't have any problems up here and he's already got you right right you're his child and I'm gonna tell you something you ought to be praying for somebody and the violent thought in your mind that come right through your head while you're praying for somebody while you're preaching the gospel right a thought that never would have come from way pints left they only come from way over you know in another Auditorium somewhere right out of the clear blue here it comes right what do you do you say Lord forgive me right and just keep right on going that's what you and I have to do we're not immune I didn't tell you we were immune from this man of sin but we can be immune from the effects he has on us by taking the word of God I told Brother Tyler take the word of God Amen don't worry about what Satan is telling you right if you don't get nothing from tonight remember one thing if the devil talks to you he's lying right he may even tell you the truth but he's lying you won't surely die God won't kill you you're all right yeah just go to church whenever you want to just do whatever you want to do it come on people we're not immune to his the Bible says to his devices but we can understand what his device is right that's what these seals are doing people that seal is revealing to me and you that that man of sin is not here anymore right that man of sin Glory he may want to just he may pound you to death but he can't get his fingers in The Bride right he's he's he's just he's trying his best yeah he can't get a hold right right that's what we got to say though death destroy this body in my flesh right I don't see God Amen and then if you look down to Sunday school class now there's a group of people that needs that's just like Joe but this is the way they say it in my flesh I shall see God without death right somebody's going to stand on this Earth amen and say in my flesh right and this flesh right here I shall see God Amen without death job didn't have that Revelation but you and I have that Revelation right and the problem is we don't believe it because we're still getting older we have problems we have headaches and heartaches and trouble people if Abraham would have looked at every one of his circumstances he would have never ever had that child right he would have never had it but like I've always there's the end result we know God's going to have a bride we saw in Revelations 1 God had a bride Revelations 1 there was a man standing in the golden candlesticks in dressed as a bride we're standing here this is just a journey in between well Danny we gotta look at that prize Paul's didn't say he's sitting Paul did not say I've run well but I've had problems and no he said I've run this race right and I've read it well man and there's a prize there's a Crown of Glory waiting on me on the other side right doesn't matter what it goes through here coach Satan is out to get us right that's true but if you stand behind this word of God he can't have you amen God promised he'd have a people right you're part of the promise it didn't say promise Richard Marlow but if Richard Marlow accepted then that's his promise right exactly a pardon is not a problem a pardon unless it's received by that person right God pardon everybody at Calvary every person that's right he could call every person all the billions of people that ever lived and they were pardoned but once you reach and get it it becomes yours amen some are not ever going to do that okay so we're never going to reach and get that part and the national name of the book 95 Bush one day reaching got that pardon and said hey I accept what that man wrote down about me right yeah I Abraham Lincoln pardon you Our God pardon you know what think about this let's take a little bit higher then we'll go home we're not just pardoned people that walk off these Earth and the body change right will believe that they never were put into prison exactly because the physical story was the man was put into prison for killing somebody you know you and I put Jesus Christ on Calvary right you and I killed the god killed the god of human flesh you and I did that but they somebody gonna stand on this Earth through the reveal word and they're going to say I never was in that prison right but now you're gonna have to have the goods to back it up right right God if not it's like that brother is talking about you know he was rebuking the the beef and he's going to speak it out of existence and stung him in the nose well he put it in the wrong place it whacked him right there in the nose why it wasn't revealed to him he was just saying what somebody else said he was just saying what the prophet said right come on people right these are quotes these quotes will kill you right man but when this quote disappears into a body of Flesh I don't know what to do with it then right oh he's going to destroy these books he's going to be glad to burn that when it's burned up brother Richard all this right here is going to burn up with it and Satan's gonna say I got him no it's just going to be all hidden right right here amen because you couldn't ever find remember he said if thou be the Son of God right cast these bread make these do this do this if thou be if thou be one day he's gonna he's gonna have to tell he's gonna have to stand on this Earth and he's going to know that a group of people he can't get into it right that doesn't mean we're not gonna have problems come on now we're going to have problems sure all these young people I've prayed for the young people pray for them hard right damn what me and you come through at school ain't nothing compared to what they're going through now nothing nothing I mean you know brother dick then when they had school and they was writing on chalkboard and stuff you know I mean if a girl wore a dress it was above her knee she was a flirt and a losing now they can't get
