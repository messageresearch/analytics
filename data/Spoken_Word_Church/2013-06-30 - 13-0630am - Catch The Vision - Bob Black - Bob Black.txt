Saturday fellowship meeting at brother Tom Kain so we get those out of the way all right we do that but we appreciate brother Bob appreciate his staying so let's just sing Open the Eyes of my heart because that's what we want right as our brother comes to speak as I always say to you I believe the way for me to hear from God is by the one that he sends to speak speak now I want to hear it myself you get a lot of voices yourself and you can get a lot of ideas and claim God told you but if it lines up with the word fine if it don't so what is it as he speaks to us let's thank God for hearing the word right Open the Eyes of My Heart in the eyes of my heart I want to see you amen I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart B Mom and Daddy don't have to listen only on table they can see I

holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see amen I want to see him too we have a lot of scripture reading this morning to do I have a few uh different places I'm going to read from let's turn first to Revelations chapter 3 now yesterday I got to share what I'm about to share with you with the chickens while I was cleaning their cute but it didn't do them any good but this morning I want to share it with some Eagles Revelation chapter 3 vers 15 and 16 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth and I got I I was meditating on what causes people to be indifferent and with all the things that God has done for us in this day why are people indifferent with all the things that we have seen let's turn over to habac chapter 2 now habac up was an interesting Prophet maybe the only Prophet that I know of that in his first chapter he inquired of God why he wasn't punishing Israel and he was he was so zealous for God that he wanted to know why God was it seemed to him like God was being overly lenient with the people so in habac 2 verse 1 and 4 he said I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it and you know this is often quoted that that he may that that he that readeth may run but it's the that he may run that readeth you read first and then it's Quicken to you then you understand for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not AR behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith amen and then I wanted to go the last scripture to read before you can be seated is Proverbs chapter 29 and that is 29 Verse 18 where it says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he and you know what I did I forgot to pray before I read the scripture so let's pray now Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace to us Lord to come before you and be able to read your word Lord and Lord you've given us the ability to with our eyes to read your word Lord but it won't do us any good if you don't come and Quicken it to us and cause us to give us to give us the understanding of what we're reading Lord if we don't understand Lord then maybe we'll grow slothful and and indifferent towards the things that you've done Lord Jesus but help us Lord that you'll open our eyes to see the things that you've done in this day see the things that you're doing right now Lord not far off but the things that are being made manifest right in our lives in our midst Lord Jesus and I pray oh God Lord my words will fall to the ground Lord but you said that your words would never never pass away that they would accomplish the purpose that they were set forth to do Lord I pray God that you Lord quick my mouth Lord Quicken My Heart Lord to say your words and Quicken these people's ears and their hearts Lord to receive it Lord Jesus as you would give it out Lord and I pray God that you'll bless the service Lord I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated I I I'm I'm a little oldfashioned I I I still believe there's three things you need to bring with you you need to bring to church with you and you know the first thing that we often forget to bring is our s and and and uh the the next thing we should bring is our sword you know I know we have all the the modern Technologies and things but you know it's still important to be able to just take that old rusty Bible and and uh you know a lot of the things I I'll talk about are maybe you've heard before and that's one of the the mockeries that a Christian Bears today is you reading the same old Bible you're listening to the same old tapes the same things that you you're reading the same things that have been said over and over but the question I want to ask is these same things that you've heard over and over have they been quickened to you and that that's what causes you to not be indifferent and the third thing that you bring I I believe that you must bring with you bring yourself and your sword and the third thing is that you bring your little portion of the pillar of fire you might say this morning I don't have that portion of the pillar of Fire well there is a fountain that's flowing from from Calvary that where you can come freely and receive it it's a free gift to everyone I think that's brother brandom talked about how that's one of the hardest things to get across to people is that God the everpresent God is here that to get people to realize that he is here and that he is with the people bless sir that the price has been paid if there's anything in the word that can make you realize that you are saved by his grace and not something that you have done then that I believe that will Quicken something in us and cause us to run the race more diligently it's not something that you've done it's not something that you have to feel but it's something that he already did he already paid the price and habach was talking about running he was talking about running right if you can if the vision has been written so that you can read it and you read it and catch the vision and then go forth then you can run you know Paul talked about in many places about how how we should run a race and just to paraphrase how Paul put it he said we should run like we're the only one running because there's only when when you run a natural race there's only one person that's going to win that race that's how we should run that race and I this race when you run a race a race has rules you got to stay on the track you got to stay between the lines or however the race is organized you can't just start the race and then cut across to the field and and and uh straight to the finish line but you've got to you've got to run according to the rules and the race of God has rules to it you've got to run according to his rules or you will be disqualified and the rules don't say that you've got to be extra special good to be saved that you got to and I think maybe sometimes when we look at this I know th works that thou art neither cold nor hot and I'll get into the you know what brother Brandon said in a second but we think oh if I've got to be really really good to be saved or if you're really really bad that's how you're lost now I remember when 911 happened in the uh the World Trade Towers were destroyed uh everybody at work was talking about how there were so many people in heaven that day why because that they gave their life in 9/11 I'm sure that there were many good people that day there were many people that live their lives those those people that that were in the cockpit that the Arabs from overseas thought that they were doing a service to God they thought that they were living right that many people that with a conviction in their in their life to to go do good deeds but it's not by our own righteousness that we're saved it's by his righteousness and that I I think that should make us one of the happiest people we should be so happy to know that it's not based upon something that I do that if I slip up and maybe you know I think sometimes we think that if somebody gets a little temper tantrum at us you know maybe we disqualify them and put them out of the race if somebody uh looks at us the wrong way or doesn't shake our hand when we're coming in the door that we put them out and disqualify them but that's not the qualification it's not what you have done it's what God has done and so the race has rules oh yeah in 1 Corinthians 9:24 Paul said know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth a prize so run that ye may obtain run that you may obtain we'll talk a little bit later about what it looks like when you're running and I think uh it looks maybe a little bit different than what you would think we look at some examples in scripture and this whole race the race of God is governed by a principle of love you know what draws me down the race what pulls me is God's love for me amen and what propels me is my love for God it's love that runs the race and and my my wife is Romanian and U there's a Romanian legend about this fell it's actually not a legend it's a true story about this fell named Vlad shees and Vlad shees ruled Romania his por he had a little portion of Romania he ruled it with an Iron Fist and he was legendary for taking anyone that disagreed with him and putting them on a stake and he would take whole armies that disagreed with him that came to fight if he won the battle he would take the entire Army and cover hillsides with people put on Stakes all around and the Germans the German name for him was dracul and that's where the modern-day Dracula came from this was a real fell and he had such a a blood lust it was written about him that if any evil that vladish hated evil so much that if any evil was done in the land no matter how small or how great how uh whether it was to Vlad ches personally or just to some peasant on the street that Vlad chish would deal with an Iron Fist and he would kill that person and maybe put them up as an example on a steak so that everyone could see and and and he ran so he ran his whole country in fear everyone was afraid to move certainly nobody nobody theft was very low and everybody was was Marching In you know just perfect Accord with you know but they were living in fear and you know that's not the way that God runs his kingdom that's not the way I want to run my house I want my children to come to God because they see my love for them and God's love for them not because that somebody tells them if you don't read your Bible you're going to hell or because they lay down an iron fist but this race has got to be run by love and you know love bears with one another I I think I I was thinking my wife and I joke about how when we first came to this church I don't know if many of you remember but we were so backwards that the first time we came to this church that was a little uh that was back when the bathroom was were right here and we we got here and we heard singing from inside but we couldn't tell where the front door was and we were so backwards that we didn't come in we thought well we come we'll come back later and get here extra early so we'll find out and you know just through the great through the life of a Christian many Christians are at different stages and we bear with one another we're not uh we don't expect uh just a new Christian to have the same uh to be at the same stage as as a Christian further along and we bear with one another because we love one another you know the if you look at the Ten Commandments that's why Jesus said the first commandment is to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all th soul and the second command commandment after that is to love the children of God I'm paraphrasing because if you take the the the Ten Commandments and divide them up into groups of five the first five are about loving God and the last five are about loving his children how can can you love the children of how can you love God if God's attributes are manifested in his children and you don't love his children how can you love God if you don't love his children so we love one another that proves that we love God and uh you know we're we're keeping some little goats for some people these two these two little goats and they've been bottle fed and they uh to be honest they're a little bit aggravating because they follow you around everywhere because they've been loved on so much and how I I believe that's what if you show One Another Love then it just causes us to cleave together and you can just like that story of brother brand telling the story of the bears looking the honey off one another that they just you just want to get around one another and lick that honey off you know brother BR talked about how when when back in the old days when they would have to leave church and they just couldn't hardly get away from each other and I I I feel like that sometimes on Wednesday night when we get around and and after church usually lately I'm always the last to leave because I I don't know if you feel the same way about me but I love you and I I hope that you cons that bless so you're not hot you're not saved because of how scriptural you are or how much you know about God's Bible you're not lost because you got a little temper you got mad at somebody somebody didn't Shake Your Hands you got your feelings hurt because you have an account on Facebook or you did something that somebody uh uh just gets a little hurt feelings at but you're saved because Romans 8:33 Paul said who shall lay anything to the charge of God's it's Christ that justifi it's God that justifi and you know this whole thing now look at this what this Proclamation this prophecy that John saw that he was looking down Through the Ages maybe think about how John must have felt when he looked and saw the state he maybe he would he would think that as the word progressed and grew and grew and the Original Seed began to be bear fruit and come forth in the latter days and this day that surely the people would be so excited so just prayer for all the time in church all the time ready to come around God's word all the time just anxious to hear what God has to say and maybe imagine his surprise to see this prophesy prophecy about leosa that in this day that there would even be a problem about being hot or cold or lukewarm and you know really the problem isn't cold the problem isn't with the cold because God you think God doesn't love Sinners but God Specializes in Sinners there's a he loves Sinners those are the ones that he can deal with think about the woman at the wh and Rahab and and the woman that washed his feet and just all these people that the world had disqualified they had put them out of the race and maybe many of us here today the world had disqualified and put us out of the race but God Specializes in Saving the Lost saving the one that's the one of the qualities of a sheep is when a sheep is lost it has no idea what to do but God Specializes in leading little lost sheep back to him amen and uh so I I think about you know how John must have fa and maybe he didn't get the full import of what this was but Thou Art neither cold nor hot right so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew out of my mouth you know the first lukewarm Christian yes thank you brother the first lukewarm Christian was was Cain back in the Garden of Eden and remember how they both they both came to offer their sacrifices I feel like a Thirsty Camel they both came to offer their sacrifices and give to God their praise and offer to him sacrifice out of what they felt was right right and Cain came with a sacrifice from his own hands that he had worked out from his own hands chilling the ground something that he felt like that he had to do but Abel looked toward that the the mercy seed and and thought there's what can I do there's nothing that I can do I believe Abel had a greater Revelation than just what Adam and Eve did but he had a revelation that there is nothing in myself worthy of Salvation there's nothing in myself worthy what if I what if Abel just as a justen to as example what if from the day he was born to the day he had that Revelation lived just a perfect clean life never looked after women never uh drank wine never did anything but still he was born the wrong way he come into the world wrong he came into the world speaking lies right and he had uh he had to be born again even though back then he couldn't be because the Holy Ghost had not come Jesus said the sacrifice has not come yet but so Abel came with a sacrifice and Cain came with the works of his own hands and you can trace that all the way down through scripture the ungodly and the hot the hot and the lukewarm right and then you know when Jesus when Jesus Jesus came to the Earth and came in a way that they didn't expect him to come and the Jews the ones that the holiest people should have accepted him and should have seen who he was but they failed to recognize the revealed word made known in their midst walking among them and even though he said I didn't do this in a secret in a secret way I didn't do this in secret but I made it was a public show I healed everyone right in your synagogues I I uh taught right in in front of you but they turned it down because they didn't recognize what was being presented to them and they looked more toward their own works and you know brother Brandon in one place he says that he spewed them out but but you before God spews you out you must spew him out first you got to Pew put him out first he never puts anyone out before per first they put him out of their denominational system out of their put him out of out of their own ideas and that's exactly what's happening again in this last day as he turned from the Jew the Jews to the Gentiles now he's about to turn back from the Gentiles to the Jews because he sees they're not able the Gentiles won't accept it and are not able to make his word become manifest so uh you know I the world wants you to think there's two extremes here hot and cold and the world wants you to think that there's that the world is not in black and white but the way God looks at things it is black and white you're either saved or you're lost you're either drunk or you're sober and he even said there's only two factions in Hebrews chapter 7 uh paragraph 3:18 there's only two factions that is a Believer or an unbeliever that's a Justified person or a sinner that's all if you're an believer you're a sinner no matter how good you are how much you go to church or even if you're a preacher you're still an unbeliever and it's not it's not that um the world the the CH this this Christian race that we're running is not Shades of Gray where you can dabble in the things of the world and then come back and Dabble in the things of God a little bit remember Lot's wife is the parable that she look back at what the at the things that she came out of that come out of the denominational system the the ideas of man and come out and then go desire to go back into your own man-made ideas and things and so I wanted to talk a little bit about what causes us to to be on fire for God and before I get into that I want to read a little a little testimony that I found uh I was reading the the voice of God website they had a a little um the people send in different testimonies and and this fed fit in real well with with uh the topic and he was telling about when he was a little boy how he met brother brandham and what brother brandham told him he said um brother Brandon prayed for me on June 26 19 1963 in the park in Hot Springs Arkansas I was 8 years old at the time but I remember every detail like it was yesterday I was suffering with swelling and pain in my jaw not knowing what was causing it I was sitting on a picnic bench on a picnic table at the campground where the meetings were going to take place when brother brandom and brother Billy Paul drove up they came over pretty close to where I was and were talking to some brothers the trash men walked up to get the trash and started talking to brother Brenham about the meeting he stood there and explained to them about the Holy Ghost and about the godhead and invited them to the meeting brother brandom uh it says in quotes brother Ram mentions this on the tape about the trash man he stopped talking to them and Whirled around and looked at me he said excuse me uh Brethren I want you to notice the whole time I have been talking this boy has sat here and has not took his eyes off me he said I have a boy your age he would not have sat here this long if he was here he would have every tree climbed and every Rock turned over but you have sit here and not taken your eyes off me he said you know in this life we have two sets of teeth you have your baby teeth they will rot and go away then you have your permanent teeth they will rot and go away then he placed his finger on my chest and pointed up and said but when you get over there you will have a set that never grow old he said Do you believe if I pray for you the Lord will heal you I said yes sir he placed his hands around my hands and said a little prayer when he was done he took two of his fingers and placed them on my cheek and said when you get back home have your mother and father take you to the dentist and have those two uppers removed the Lord healed me instantly the pain and swelling was gone after the meetings were over and we got back home mother asked Dad should we take him to the dentist dad said yes sir that's what brother brandom said do my parents didn't say anything to the dentist about what happened at the meeting I climbed up in the chair for my exam the dentist looked at my teeth and said looks like like those two uppers need to come out so I will never forget the day I met the prophet of God I thank God for the prophet he sent to the bride of Christ his spirit is still among us today now that's a little testimony about a little boy that met brother Branham and brother brandham gave him a vision of where he was going one day and that's uh that's what caught my attention one day I was going in the wrong direction and you maybe you heard of my testimony I kind of gave a little a while back in one of the first Sunday school lessons that one day I took a walk with my dad and he began to talk about the future home and I caught the vision and it struck something in me I didn't receive the Holy Ghost then but it caught something in me that caused me to have just a fire in my life to read and study and and ever since then the fire is not quenched uh brother Joe or Brother Anderson if you pull up the definition of lukewarm is lukewarm in the Greek Lexicon the definition of lukewarm is comes from the Greek clearos which uh is a metaphor for the condition of the Soul wretchedly fluctuating between a torpor and a fervor of love in other words an airplane Christian one minute you're really on fire for God and the next you're just uh it's just hard to hardly get you out of bed to to say but you know when Abel offered his sacrifice and the fire of God came down and accepted it uh that's what really lights things up and was when God lights you up with the fire of God with a holy fire on the inside and now I want to talk about another little boy that uh caught the vision let me take a drink of water here that's one little boy that caught the vision and there was another little boy in the Old Testament and his he was the grandson of Aaron now Aaron we know Aaron had he had four sons and the first two sons Aaron was the high priest and the first two sons naboth and Abu uh I'm I think that's the first one I can't really read my handwriting na neud or and Abu anyway he had two sons that uh they instead of remember in the Old Testament when the first time Moses brought a sacrifice to the Lord and He instead of lighting the fire with a fire that he struck himself the fire of God came down and consumed the sacrifice and ever since that day they kept the fire from The Altar and and kept it sacred so that that original fire never went out but it would continuously be used to as to receive the sacrifice and these two oldest sons of el Aaron they brought a a fire that they got from somewhere else that they tried to manufacture their own self just like Cain tried to manufacture something and they brought it and because they brought uh This Strange Fire they were consumed instead of their sacrifice and so now the ones that should have been the high priest are out of the picture and the Eleazar becomes the high priest now we know Eleazar when they came to cadesh Bara Eleazar must have been very young because Eleazar put uh Joshua in he he was with Moses when Joshua was established and when they came into the promised land he helped Joshua put everyone into the place where they should be so he came came into the promised land so he must have been the cut off was 20 years of age and older so he must have been under 20 years of age so elasia we know was a pretty young man and I can I can identify with him you know having to get up before the people and you know make a sacrifice and do all the duties of the high priest and everything and uh I'm sure it must have been very scary that first time to to get up and and and speak before the people oh yeah and uh so AER had a little son and his name was Phineas and Phineas was raised up in the message he was raised up around the the prophet and around the he was put into this environment where his whole life was raised up and told these stories I'm sure his mother told him all these stories about you know we we listen to the prophet's life story well Moses had a life story too and I'm sure that eleazer Eleazar was a God-fearing man and I'm sure that Eleazar and his wife set their children down and told them about the stories of Moses and one story I think they might have told was how Moses when he was when he was a little fellow he he his mama set him on her knee you know cuz his his his real mother was the the wet nurse for Moses and so she told him who he was and told him about how when she pulled him when when when she laid him in that little basket of the bull rushes that she saw something special in him and she saw she believed that one day he was going to be the deliverer and that surely God was with him that caused him to be moved right into the pharaoh's house and be brought up in Pharaoh's house and you know I believe that Moses believed that but he tried to do like Cain and tried to bring it to pass with his own by his own power and one day he saw an Egyptian fighting with an Israelite and he waited till everybody was gone and he looked to the left the Bible says he looked to the left and he looked to the right and he made made sure that everybody was gone and then he killed the Egyptian and buried him into the Sands we try to bury our own sins our own pasts but that won't work does it that doesn't work so found he he thought that he wouldn't be found out but the next day he saw two Israelites fighting and he said to the one that was smiting the other he said why are you smiting your Israel your your brother you're supposed to love one another and he said are you going to who made you a ruler and a judge over us are you going to kill me the way you killed that Egyptian and so he ran into the Wilderness and when he got to the Wilderness his that Vision that his mama gave him that his parents had told him about who he was began to diem and began to die off maybe your vision today is getting a little bit dim the vision of who you are and what you've been raised for what you're doing here today and uh brother brand tells a story about how that he got so comfortable in life he got his house paid off just telling a story like that he got so comfortable and situated but one day he saw a pillar of fire burning in a bush and he met the same fire that consumed Abel's sacrifice and from that day on there was a fire kindled in him because he saw he found out that God was real that he wasn't just a bunch of Creeds and dogmas that God was alive and his heart was became on just as on fire as that fire that was in that bush that's what causes us to be on fire for God the fire of God in us and uh so we we know the story of how we went down into Egypt and they came out and they came to Kadesh Baria and uh that's where the the cut off was they began to uh God said not a one of you will cross over the to the River Jordan over death and unless you're under the age of 20 right and so I I believe that phish's parents told him these little stories they told him about the prophet they told him about how they were delivered how they came over the Red Sea they told him about how that the token had been applied to their door they had to apply the token that it was their door the L of their doorpost was covered by the shed blood and they told him all these things and so he caught the vision of where he was headed he caught the true interpretation of let my people go and I believe a lot of them around around him believe that let my people go was the end of the story that they would just come out and they would circle around the Wilderness for a while and they would be tended I believe that's why when they got to cadesh Bara they didn't go over because they didn't catch the vision of what their purpose was of who they were and what God wanted to do with their life and they failed to realize their purpose in life but Phineas caught the full vision that it wasn't just to come out but they were to go in to go on to to take a a body change let me say it like that he he caught the vision of what the real Ten Commandments were all about and he didn't believe that he was born to just be part of an organization Lord and so just as they got now think about John looking down through time and seeing just as we're about the bride of Christ is just about to cross the threshold over into Glory just just as we're about to cross over then Satan comes and throws his last trick as what brother brandom said and they were just at the borderline they were camped on the other side of Jericho they were inside of Jericho and Jericho was just on the other side of the river Jordan and they had to cross over death and just as they were situated around then baac sees a Revival coming through the land he sees a people that were led by the spirit of God by the pillar of fire that they had an altar they had a a a lamb that was slain in their midst they had the sacrifice and they had signs and wonders following them and he said I'm not going to let that come into my territory and so what was interesting is that baac joined together with the midianites yeah and we know where Midian comes from it's it's real interesting because Moses was married to the daughter of the priest of Midian right the head man and so the midianites had been around the message they had heard about it even though maybe they wouldn't admit to listening to the tapes before they said their things on the radio they had been around they were well acquaint acquainted with the things of the message with the things of God but they were maybe jealous of what was going on and you know they even had a righteous lineage cuz they descended right back to Abraham not a Abraham they descended all the way back to Abraham and his second wife after Sarah died he married Cura and so they were children of Abraham too but they didn't they failed to believe the the signs and the Wonders and the manifested word that was revealed that was displayed right there in front of them and so baac and the moabites and the midianites joined together and they said let's go find the head man and we can get him to throw to to to curse these people and we know the story about how they they uh balum tried and tried because he was so eager to get paid he tried and tried to curse Israel but God uh every time he tried he he blessed he blessed Israel until finally he he convinced balam he said I'll tell you what if we can get their eye off the promise if we can get them off of what they're supposed to be doing even though they are right in sight of the promised land Jericho is just across the river the Rapture is just at hand if we can get their eye off the promise and their off the word the revealed word for their day and look instead of looking at the word look at their own man's own ideas things that man comes up with if we can get them to look at that then then we've got them and remember how the same thing happened in the Garden of Eden how Satan came down and he said I can't get into Adam so I have to get him to come out to me and he spoke to Eve he went to the to the weak spot and he spoke to Eve and they he CED them to come out to him and that's exactly what happened here they had the Mana they had the revealed word they had they were eat feasting on Christ that came down from heaven the revealed word for the hour but instead of that they got turned to eating what was offered to dead Idols sacrifices and so Satan's last trick was played and uh and then is when Phineas rose up now The Story Goes it's written in the Bible that Moses told the men of Israel to destroy all of the midianites go go find all the men that had joined yourself to this false Doctrine and killed them and all the men of Israel fell down and and prayed and and worshiped before God and and and were repenting and they were all falling down before the altar but only one stood up only one of them was uh let me back up and tell this story so uh z uh one of the Israelites Zim took one of the midianites into his tent and uh Phineas looked up and saw that and he was the only one they they were all they were all holy and Pious and repenting and bowing before the altar of the Lord and Moses and Aaron and everyone was standing there and you know Phineas didn't say he didn't consult with Moses about what he should do brother Moses do I really have the Holy Ghost do I really have an experience before I go and meet this challenge can you validate my personal experience but and experience is a personal relationship you have with God and you know Phineas neither did he he he didn't challenge Moses and he didn't say you know brother Moses if you had if we had had more Youth Services if we had done more things for people if we had had maybe if we had uh better coffee down in the lobby or or different things maybe more people would come and he didn't you know through the whole journey of the Israelites the Israelites had constantly criticized Moses that even though he was Vindicated over and over again as God's man God's man bringing the message for his day and they constantly ridiculed him but Phineas didn't do any of those things and and neither did he stay over long in prayer but he rose up to do the will of the Lord and you know that's what real love is we think love is drawing any all the the just whatever pollution and stuff to our bosom but love is obeying the will of God and Phineas rose up in obedience to the will of God he didn't have to consult and ask he knew on because he had heard he had read the message he had the table what was written on the tables of stone had become plain to him and he knew what he was raised up for he knew that they needed to go over into the promised land and he caught the vision and so he rose up and he went into the tent he went into the tent and slew her slew omry through the belly and omry I I found it was interesting what the name of omry the medanite girl was omry means my lie so Zim had taken a lie into his tent and so Phineas stood up and he he stood up to do the will of God and he saw this false Doctrine he saw the same thing that Abel saw that someone was confessing that they were a True Believer that they were claiming his name but they were not living the life that they were living the a life based on some other doctrine that they were living a life not based on the revelation of his word but based on something that uh Den a denominational idea and so he rose up and put plunged his dagger through her belly so that that seed would not come to would would not mature and produce it's written of Phineus in Psalm 10628 through 32 they joined themselves also into B peor and ate the sacrifices of the Dead thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the plague break in upon them then stood up Phineas and executed judgment and so the plague was stayed right and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations forever more and so God gave Phineas the promise that forever more until until the priesthood finished at at Christ that Phineas and his lineage after him would always be priest before him and I I I'm thinking about how you know many of us have been raised up in the message the same way that Phineas was and the word has been around us we've been around these things all of our life but have we caught the vision have we caught what the prophet is saying and how do we catch what how can we catch what the prophet says unless a prophet would bring it and you know in Matthew 10:41 it's written he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and we were talking in Sunday school last Sunday about the bearing forth fruits you know think about how a righteous man if you ever sat under someone that uh just set under the leaves the coolness and feel the virtue coming forth from them and as they tell you their Revelation what they understand God to be to them and it just causes you to catch something that makes you want to grow closer closer to God and and the same thing you know brother brandom said that Abraham knew what God's nature was because he was a friend with God and brother brandom explained this if you have if if you are somebody said what um what does it mean to to receive a a prophet in the name of a prophet what does all that mean and he he said if if they want to know what a prophet's reward is is to be a friend to the prophet now I I'd never even met brother brand how can I be his friend that's right because I've never walked with him but I know that he was a friend with God and he walked with God and he knew what God was all about when I listened to the tapes because he knew what God was about I knew what God was about and I can catch what he's bringing I can catch you know everything that everything that uh that brother brandham saw and God it was communicated down so that we could catch it and believe it and receive it so we can catch the vision Glory who is this 1959 brother brandham said he know talking about Abraham he he know the nature of God because he was a friend of God he know how to take him because he know that his promises no matter how foolish they looked or how simple they looked or how unreasonable they looked they were true because God said so and that settled it forever now what is a vision now we know brother brandham saw a vision he saw Visions right before and Bam described it very well he said my eyes are open and I see a picture right in front of me but now this Vision has to be communicated down and you know even when brother Brandon was seeing visions you know he said maybe one time he would see a strong arm and he would say you're name is Mrs Stout and so there was a there's a vision that's written on tables there there it's two-part there's a vision but there's also another part that it has to be interpreted it has to be made known and uh you know when he would in the prayer line he would reach out to people and he would let them see the bumps on his hands and he he could show them the bumps as in the discernment line but the person looking at the bumps had no idea what those bumps represented and how how would anyone have any idea what a series of bumps bumping up on his hand would would represent but because God was in the man and the spirit of discernment was in him he interpreted what the dots were and that's how a vision is you can the vision can be written on tables written in your Bible but it's also got to be interpreted and the only one that can interpret it is God in you amen glory so a vision is spiritual sight a Vision brother R said a vision is just repeating what he showed what he showed him and I can't just repeat it I've got to catch the vision it's got to be quickening me and uh so a vision is two parts the public and the revealed you know maybe think about how as you walk down the street you are a public Vision but unless it's interpreted no one will realize that you're the walking manifestation of God's word God's word made flesh but if you catch it now think about this brother brand talking about what what prayer how prayer is when you align your vision of what God wants you to do and wants you to be and and think about Joshua looking across Jericho and Phineas looking across toward the promised land that God wants you to grow up the stature of a perfect man that he wants these virtues to be born in you see he wants you to be to to grow in Grace and knowledge and if you can align the vision that God has for you in your life align it with your motives and objectives then how can it fail if you have the right motives and objectives right and uh you know when you come before God In Prayer what prayer really is is letting your eyes the things that you see in this life letting your eyes grow dim and the things of this this Earth just fall away and your eyesight switches from the things of the world to the things above and you begin to see things different you began to maybe that person that talked bad to you last week or the the other day when you get in prayer and get get under the fountain then that doesn't seem to matter so much because now you see things different don't forsake the family prayer and when you pray repeat back to God the vision that gave to you I love when I get in prayer I love to tell him what I believe I love to tell him that I love to tell him who I believe that he has made me by his grace he took uh somebody that wasn't even worthy and he made me worthy and I like to tell him that and thank him and tell him where I believe that I'm going and what I'm here on Earth to do and what my purpose in life is and then when you do that and meld your vision with your motive the right motive and objective then everything just comes perfectly in line and how can it fail how can you fail if you have need of healing and your motive and objective is right you say I God I want to be healed because not just to go out and sin and go out to the clubs and things but I want to be healed so that I can praise you more so that I can testify so that I can live a life worthy of the Gospel so I can give glory to your name and you know that that is the vision you know there's not one time in scripture where anyone ever came to Christ and said we will you heal me that he ever turned them away and if you can catch the vision and align it with your motives and objectives then he will bring it to pass watch him watch him do it every time now in uh 1952 thou knowest all things now see what prayer does paragraph e 17 prayer is not exactly bringing God down to man it's bringing man up to God see as you pray you lose you lose sight of these Earthly things you sway out into somewhere else Way Beyond and on and on and on till you become into his presence and then a faith that you have laid it out before God said now here here it is and I want to get well for this cause or I want you to do this for me for this cause I want you to heal me from this cancer or this TB or this anemia condition or whatever it is I will walk before you I will do everything I can I will give this testimony everywhere I go I will be happy to do that Lord and I will use my life not for myself I will use it for your glory to help others to see you and the message influence 1963 he said so if you'll set your mind and ey and motives and objectives in life on the right thing you've got to come out on the right thing you can't fail think how powerful that is you can't fail that's the only way no matter no matter how much you're tempted to do the other side turn your head from it and do what's right and you know you're right you feel better and you are better and that's just all there is to it you got you're going to come out right you start going with you're not you're not going to be going north you're going to be going west and that's the same way it is and right and wrong let's read another one I have heard but now I see 1965 and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of God see if you want to be well what do you want to be well for see if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get heal see there's got to be you've got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of God and then when the faith is revealed to you and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over see now see now I want to tell you a little story about how one time my motives and objectives were aligned right with the vision excuse me now you've heard the story told about how brother random talked about how that he if you have faith enough that he can put your pocket knife in your pocket he can move it where you need it to be now not as a magic trick not as a show but if you need it and one morning I was going I was leaving the house for work and I couldn't it was just pouring down rain and I have I have probably a 10-minute walk from the subway station to work and before I had walked that many times before where I would uh one time I walked at in the security guards were laughing at me because I was so drenched I was just completely soaked and I and so that morning you know I believe that God Specializes in Saving the Lost whether it's your family or or myself or anyone L you know God saved me he can save you and uh and the think whenever we have something missing in our family we always gather around and just say a little prayer because God will find it I don't know where it is but he does because he knows all things so that morning I just prayed God I need the rain was coming down I said I need my umbrella and I don't want to walk through that I had a definite motive and objective and I believed that God would bring it to pass but I was walking out I I searched throughout the whole house I searched everywhere and I couldn't find it and I was going to be late for work so I walked out of the house and the only umbrella I could find was my wife's pink umbrella so that is the umbrella that I grabbed and I I I walked with that pink umbrella into work and I was sitting there at work and I had I had taken my laptop out of the little bag and I put it in my docking station and got everything set up and it that that particular morning morning I had got to work real early way before everyone else and I was there all alone by myself and I was just thinking about the things of God and all of a sudden just something spoke to me not a all a voice but from within my heart and it said what about that umbrella cuz I had asked God to find my umbrella not my wife's and here I was at work I wasn't at home and I knew that I didn't have the umbrella was not at work and I said I don't know where it is but I know that you are more than able to find it because I believe your word and I don't remember exactly what I said but I I made a little confession of faith and that same voice that spoke to me and said where is your umbrella said look in your bag I had just taken my laptop out of the bag I had just looked in there and it was there was nothing in there and I looked in the bag and my umbrella was in the bag it had not been in there before I don't know where it came from or how it I do know where it came from it came from the god of Glory that moved it there based on my faith because I had caught the vision and I had a motive and objective you know I I took that umbrella out of the bag and I I was so I could not believe what had happened and so I took I took about 10 pictures with my little camera and if anybody doubts me I took a picture where I tried to put my laptop and the umbrella in the case at the same time and they will not fit I can I can bring you those pictures if you want to find it Hallelujah but M your motives and objectives with your motives with the vision and God will bring it to pass every time you can rest your faith on it because he promised it you can rest your faith on Mark 16 that if you lay hands on the sick they will recover you can rest your faith on on that little promise that where the twos and the threes are GA together in my name they that I will be in their midst you can rest your faith on those promises so uh just a little bit of time we got left I want to maybe take a look at what does zeal look like what does real Zeal for God look like and maybe a lot of times we think that zeal looks like hurrying to and fro until we're falling asleep at stop lies just going backwards and forth running to and fro doing good works until we just about fall apart and I I I know that that living for Christ is living for others and that's not what I'm getting at I'm not opposed to that at all but maybe what real Zeal is is maybe not what we think a lot of times let's look at First Kings chap chap 17 well I'll just I'll just tell you this story for memory we don't need to read First Kings chapter 17 is where Elijah comes on the scene out of nowhere comes on the scene and he says he makes this declaration to Ahab now Ahab Israel had married to Jezebel the world system denomination just like the midianites and the moabites merged with the Israelites of that day came together and Elijah came on the scene out of nowhere Elijah was from Gilead and he made this Proclamation that he said doe no due or rain will fall on the earth until I call for for it and you know a few chapters over he said the the still Small Voice came to Elijah and said what are you doing asking him asked him what are you doing what what what is your purpose and and he said uh and I'm paraphrasing he says and Elijah answered he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of Israel I have been very jealous now I wonder how many of us can say the same thing and what jealous he look like to Elijah right after he made that declaration he went and did exactly the opposite of what you might think he would do he went up into the mountain and sat down by a river chith and he just sat and he just waited and think about how Jesus when when they came when he was he was on a journey and they came with word that Lazarus was sick and he just continued on his way just continued doing exactly the opposite of what everyone expected he would do everyone expected he should run and and and quickly turn and my friend and you he was much loved by Jesus but he just continued on his way and you know brother brandham talked about the same thing he said everyone would come to him and say how can you leave leave your family your little children and go overseas how can you leave them but he was doing it in obedience to the will of God that's what real Zeal is doing doing living your life in obedience to the will of God what does God wants you to do and Elijah just sat there and uh and waited for God to bring his word to pass and God brought bought him food from the Ravens and fed him there and and just Elijah just rested knowing that God had everything in control and then as as the the brook chith died down it dwindled away slowly and slowly he did another thing that would seem very odd to many people he went right down to Jezebel's Homeland zidon right down in into the midst of why are you going to to where Jezebel's from R in amongst all the Gentiles and he found the little widow woman and we know that story but did exactly the opposite of what everyone was expected because he was following God he had forsaken everything he was doing what God wanted him to do and I think about what look at all these examples that have been set for us a great cloud of witness of Phineas rising up an example of what a real man is and Elijah an example of what a real man is and a real man and looking at prayer you know brother brandom said a real man doesn't have broad shoulders a real man doesn't a real man what is real Zeal a real man might be just carrying his little lunchbox to work one day but and and praying all night you know for his family I think that's what an example of what a real man is where his wife knows that he cares about the family when you come home from work and and and just the toils of Life take their toll does your family know that you care enough to get down on your knees and shake the walls praying for them praying for their salvation praying so loud not Lou get don't get me wrong but praying in such a way that your kids know that you have touched God that you have a relationship with God teach them by example right that's how I was taught BL what a what a real man he is and you can the world will maybe many times Overlook god making his word manifest in people by just the Simplicity of how he does it just a little housewife doing exactly what she's supposed to do caring for her family and maybe like brother Brand's wife praying over every little garment that came across her iron board that's doing exactly what God wants her to do do so you don't have to run to and fro to be pleasing to God but just men carry a little lunchbox to work and be an example and sisters be an example to your family example of what a real mother and a real wife should be a real man a real sister and daughter of God that's what I'm talking about real Zeal for the Lord real Zeal comes when you catch the vision glory and and I'll just finish with this about how there was another man in the Bible that lost his vision and that was Samson and God gave his parents a vision that this man will begin to drive out the Philistines and he had a vision of what he was supposed to do and what he was raised up for and he lived that Vision out until one day a little woman named ailah took away his vision called and cut his hair he you know he lost that Vision before she cut his hair away but um because he lost the sight of what he was really raised up for but one day he maybe maybe if you think that you're forsaken that God has forsaken you like maybe Samson thought that God had forgotten about you but Samson caught sight when when they when they it's very striking to me that when they punched his eyes out is the very time in his life when he really began to catch the vision to catch the vision that it might be possible to return back to God to return back into fellowship with him that that power that he had felt before might return back to him but the thing about Samson is to get back into a relationship with God he was going to have to lose it all he was going to have to give up everything right he was going to have to give his life up and that's how we are to come for that power of God to fall upon you you've got to give up everything you've got to die and so Samson was willing to die to get the power of God back in his life he was willing to die to get that Zeal back let me just read a few quotes as the musicians come forward a few quotes that just once more Lord 1963 December the first brother brandham said and Samson was blind but here is what Samson recognized that the church has never come to yet he knew there was a possibility of coming back again if the church could only know that a possibility but the people of today don't seem to catch the vision yet they don't seem to catch it that there is a possibility it doesn't come through you can shout a little more patch your hands a little more or dance a little more that isn't it no it's back to the word there is a possibility of coming back and getting the word on the inside again you bypassed it there notice they sit tight but you see that's all sales without any anchor there's a possibility to get Zeal glory and I believe that to to get Zeal back in your life you've got to give it all thank you I'll turn it over to brother Dale I believe we're in the end time where it can be let's Stand Together really enjoyed the message make sure you tell our brother we appreciate it amen I believe it I believe in setting a a goal in your life and try to achieve to it that's right ain't trying to set something by a book of rules or whatever but there's a possibility in this day that this bride of Jesus Christ will walk off the earth amen Amen in a change he won't have to die that's promised in God's word so then I believe that promise I want to hold on to that and no matter what let me keep that right what do we got brother number 77 in power 77 in power anybody have a need the alar is open you have a need we've heard a great message now seeing that there is an opportunity we can be what God wants us to be and each one of those that he spoke of took it in their heart said that's it Jesus wonderful Will in the light of his glory PR turn your eyes all you got to do is just believe step out on what you believe and just say thank you Lord and see where it works or not expect a miracle why not we serve a miracle working God yeah but it's just not my case well what case could be too hard for God his and the in the life of his glory and see I don't believe God died when the prophet passed off the scene I believe the same God that walks the shores of Galilee is right here today to give you what you desire but you got to believe it but it's not far you if you don't believe it then what is it do we need do we need a new birth promised in his word do we need healing promised in his word we need peace in our soul he promised in his word but we got to step out on it and Ain something that we just lay back and have hazardously receive we got to believe it in the anybody else who want to come your and the will in the of his glory and grace turn your you have a need come come let's see it won't be important you look at it now around the world how everything's falling apart where once you had a goal and a strive to build and have nice homes and make money and things what is it now what is it now one day is all it takes one moment and all can be changed but you know what we serve an eternal God that made a lot of promises when the enemy comes in he said he'd raise up a standard so when you look around you see everything falling apart that's the time to realize God is here he's here to take over and going to take his little bride through so it's not a horrible time wonderful time the anybody else who just have a name turn your eyes anybody else in his all this world Str the glor amen and amen just make sure you tell brother Bob how much we appreciate you coming in for speaking for us because we believe it amen I believe that umbrella come back as well as I believe anything else I see a lot of people's never experienced some things and that's why it's hard for them to believe but once you experience it then you'll see it you'll see well hey that's it I believe it you know because it's com real right amen father we thank you for the day we thank you for the word that we've heard and Lord we ask you now to just go with us as we dismiss for a few minutes and go eat a natural meal and things Lord and come back together this afternoon and we pray that you'd bless our brother he's laid his heart out unto us this morning and we believe it we ask you now to just come and manifest yourself as to these that were pray for and all Lord we believe that they have what they ask for because why not why can't we
