[0:00] the first thing you look around a dad
[0:01] isn't there no more that's exactly right
[0:05] it's coming and we don't know what time
[0:06] but the thing it is when it's over then
[0:08] it's over and there's nothing else you
[0:11] can do about it amen you say I've heard
[0:13] that a long time but you're going to
[0:14] your your last time amen that's right
[0:16] it's going to happen because it's the
[0:18] word of the Lord and remember has it
[0:21] failed any time through these eight
[0:23] nights that I've been preaching but what
[0:25] what Jesus said here has come to pass
[0:27] and done every Church age Justice
[0:30] exactly and we see this church age right
[0:32] into it and at the very hour even this
[0:35] morning and typ in the virgins the very
[0:38] time that the sleeping virgin now
[0:41] remember the Bible said that the
[0:42] sleeping virgin when the crow went out
[0:45] behold the bridegroom coming the coming
[0:47] of the Lord the preaching of the word
[0:49] and then what happened the time is at
[0:51] hand atomic bombs and everything ready
[0:53] the preachers run into the streets and
[0:54] begin to scream the message and it seems
[0:56] to do the big church s the sleeping
[0:59] virgins said
[1:00] oh well we've been presbyter a long time
[1:04] maybe we would study and find out yes
[1:06] you know I believe we do need the Holy
[1:08] Ghost and they're writing pamphlets and
[1:09] everything about it now starting out and
[1:12] they said uh uh would you give us some
[1:14] of it and they said no we just got
[1:17] enough for ourselves so when they went
[1:19] to get the Holy Ghost went to pray up
[1:20] like the churches the big fine churches
[1:22] are doing today the organizations when
[1:25] they went to get the
[1:27] orl the bridegroom
[1:30] amen amen so they're trying to get it
[1:33] right
[1:35] now great churches
[1:38] organizations great International
[1:40] meetings about it in the in the
[1:42] organized churches saying we got to get
[1:43] back to the Pentecostal blessing we got
[1:45] to have Divine healers in the church we
[1:47] got to have speakers with tongues we got
[1:49] to have interpreters of tongues we got
[1:51] to have all these spiritual gifts in our
[1:53] church and we're just going to have
[1:55] start meetings and start doing it
[1:56] they're getting counsil started to do it
[1:58] while they're gone to do that it's at
[2:00] that very time yes that the bridegroom
[2:03] come and got those who had the arm their
[2:05] lamps and went away then they come and
[2:07] what happened they were cast into outer
[2:09] Darkness the Great Tribulation period
[2:12] where there will be weeping and wailing
[2:14] and nashing of teeth amen while the
[2:16] bride is in heaven oh my then at the end
[2:20] of that three and a half years he will
[2:21] come like Joseph did and make hisself
[2:23] knowing to his Brethren it'll cause a
[2:25] weeping all over and they'll say they'll
[2:27] separate their families and weep and and
[2:29] say where'd you get them scars and and
[2:32] Pierce the ones that pierced him she'll
[2:33] see him and you'll make your known to
[2:35] his brother now he's trying to make
[2:37] himself known to his church and they
[2:39] pushed him outside and he's still
[2:40] standing knocking said is there one more
[2:42] in there one that would open let me come
[2:44] in and talk with
[2:46] you I'm glad so thankful that about many
[2:51] years ago around 28 years ago I felt
[2:54] that knock on my heart amen and I he
[2:58] come in I've been uping with him and he
[3:00] with me ever since and I receive the
[3:03] Pentecostal blessing receive the Holy

[3:09] Christ for the remission of sins the
[3:10] only time I ever was baptized in my life

[43:42] service Jesus name we pray amen Hebrews
[43:47] 11 vers1 says now Faith is the substance
[43:49] of things hoped for the evidence of
[43:51] Things Not Seen for by the elders
[43:53] obtained a good report through faith we
[43:56] understand now look through faith
[43:58] through
[43:59] faith we understand that the worlds were
[44:02] framed by the word of God so that things
[44:04] which are seen were not made of things
[44:06] which do appear you may be seeing the
[44:08] Lord at his Blessing if you'll remember
[44:10] several years ago brother Joe Green was
[44:11] preaching here and he preached a sermons
[44:13] called now
[44:14] faith we need a now faith we need a
[44:17] faith for the time right they had a
[44:20] faith
[44:21] before they had a faith
[44:23] before now there's a faith for this time
[44:25] we have to have rapturing faith no one
[44:28] else has had to have rapturing faith but
[44:30] the end time bright all right and if we
[44:32] say some things that are strange just
[44:34] bear with us we believe God sent a
[44:36] prophet according to Malachi 4 and we're
[44:38] we're going to quote him and we believe
[44:39] him and and we build all of our um Faith
[44:43] Around Jesus Christ but we did need a
[44:45] prophet because we had so many
[44:47] differences and and you know
[44:48] denominations and and a lot of things of
[44:51] this baptism and that over there and
[44:53] this over here but everything was
[44:54] brought together I Believe by seventh
[44:57] angel messenger all right so we we
[44:59] appreciate U we appreciate God sending
[45:01] us one he s to me behold I sent you
[45:05] Elijah the prophet he sent him to me
[45:07] right I don't know about you you got to
[45:08] believe that he sent him got was sent to
[45:10] you too right so let's look at this word
[45:13] faith faith means Fidelity faithfulness
[45:15] now look the character of one who can be
[45:17] relied on when you say even in your
[45:20] public life and your private life you
[45:22] you put Faith in things now I know
[45:25] sometimes our faith gets torn down
[45:26] because we do put our faith in stuff and
[45:29] and it falls apart or we put Faith in a
[45:30] person and that person falls apart all
[45:33] right but you better put your faith in
[45:34] Jesus Christ cuz he never has fell apart
[45:37] never will fall apart come on somebody
[45:39] we're going to preach tonight we're not
[45:40] going to teach a little bit you're going
[45:41] to to say Amen somebody got have to say
[45:43] it I'll say it myself so the character
[45:46] of one who can be relied on so we come
[45:48] tonight relying on that Jesus Christ
[45:50] will be here to tell us something all
[45:53] right through a five-fold Ministry all
[45:55] right so the word substance means that's
[45:58] which which actually
[46:02] exist that exists that's tangible that
[46:05] is a substance so faith is the substance
[46:08] or the evidence right here a real being
[46:12] a substantial sustain substantial
[46:16] quality nature of a person or thing look
[46:19] watch this the steadfast fastness of
[46:21] what mind firmness courage that's what
[46:25] we're going to talk about a little bit
[46:26] about a battle in just a few minutes the
[46:28] steadfastness of Mind firmness courage
[46:31] resolution confidence firm trust and
[46:34] Assurance that's faith is all these
[46:37] things but now you got to Center your
[46:39] faith in something am all right like I
[46:43] said before you put in
[46:47] politics put it in government I work for
[46:49] the government I work for the post
[46:51] office please don't put your faith in
[46:53] you get in your mail on time praise the
[46:55] Lord Lord
[46:56] anyhow but anyway but anyway um we need
[47:01] to put our trust and faith in Jesus
[47:04] Christ and that God did send us a
[47:06] prophet he did send us an end time
[47:08] message that we Believers and that's why
[47:10] we call Believers because we believe it
[47:12] all right now just for a minute I want
[47:14] to talk to you a second when we get into
[47:16] this but let's talk a minute about the U
[47:18] um social media and family just for a
[47:21] minute um I know most of you know that
[47:25] we were on WhatsApp last night and this
[47:27] morning and just to make
[47:31] everything to be covered
[47:34] over as a
[47:36] church we need to make sure we have all
[47:41] of our fact straight number one and then
[47:44] make sure that uh cuz we know all most
[47:47] of us all knew know what happened that
[47:50] that that a sister found out that her
[47:52] sister had died through social media
[47:54] that's not good listen even the even the
[47:56] even the siners out there in NBC CBS and
[48:00] ABC they won't release a name until what
[48:04] the next of Ken has been told right the
[48:07] government will say all right we had so
[48:09] many deaths and they'll come to your
[48:10] door if you're in the army or navy or
[48:13] Marine they'll come to your door right
[48:14] brother John brother John was in the
[48:15] military they'll come to your door and
[48:17] they will not let it be known anywh
[48:19] other way you're not going to get a
[48:21] letter you're going to get a person
[48:23] that's going to tell you so and so of
[48:26] your family or what more passed away all
[48:28] right is everybody with me so let's just
[48:30] be sensitive to that all right and make
[48:33] sure that all the family knows before we
[48:36] start posting things all right uh I
[48:39] would suggest that maybe if you wanted
[48:42] to I know I got a private WhatsApp or an
[48:45] email from um sorry text message from
[48:48] someone and that's the way probably it
[48:50] should be if you want to text maybe
[48:52] maybe me and and and then let me
[48:56] say okay we can present this uh I mean
[49:00] you can have a family member tell you
[49:01] yeah but
[49:03] remember church family is church family
[49:06] I know we're tighter than most families
[49:07] are all right I understand that but
[49:10] remember when it comes down to Brass tax
[49:12] when it comes down to the rubber meets
[49:14] the road we don't make the decisions for
[49:16] the family as far as burial as far as
[49:17] singing songs as far as who's going to
[49:19] do the funeral right we don't do that
[49:21] because that's family blood relative
[49:24] family all right so let's let the blood
[49:27] relative know and make sure they know
[49:29] first how would you like to find out
[49:31] wake up at 6:00 this morning and look on
[49:34] the news and found out your wife got
[49:35] killed in the car W last
[49:37] night see and listen nothing was done I
[49:41] talk to a lot of people so not what is
[49:43] nothing's done maliciously nothing was
[49:45] done to harm anybody but let's just stop
[49:49] just for a second and ask them one
[49:52] question has all the
[49:53] family blood family
[49:56] been told it's all you got to do or you
[50:00] can just if you find out about it send
[50:02] me a text all right we're all on text
[50:04] we're all on WhatsApp I have and you we
[50:05] can do a private WhatsApp but just bring
[50:08] it to one person that way that the
[50:11] sister won't find out that the sister
[50:13] passed away by social media that just
[50:16] it's just not good okay she was very
[50:18] highly upset this morning when I talk to
[50:19] her so um just keep that in mind um we
[50:23] want listen this is Information Age I
[50:25] social media is just here to stay we
[50:28] just got it even in Idaho there's social
[50:30] media may not be as much but there
[50:32] social media all over the place so just
[50:36] I know we got a church
[50:38] family I know it but we got natural
[50:40] blood family and we have to respect the
[50:43] blood family first
[50:45] right the mama the daddy the brothers
[50:47] the sisters we have to respect that and
[50:50] and and you have to respect that and you
[50:52] may sit in your mind and go why in the
[50:54] world did they do but that's not not
[50:55] your
[50:56] business okay it's not your business
[50:59] it's not it's the family all right so
[51:01] just leave it at that be careful with
[51:04] social media be careful when it comes to
[51:07] a tragedy now for prayer or for a baby
[51:09] being born or something like that yeah
[51:11] that's not going to harm anybody but a
[51:14] tragedy or something like that let's
[51:16] please just kind of either like funnel
[51:18] it through me like I said or or or or
[51:21] make sure the questions asked does all
[51:24] the family know yet
[51:26] okay so because look one more thing I
[51:29] was thinking about this morning um the
[51:31] process of grief everybody Grieves
[51:36] different some cry some are totally
[51:40] silent some get real you know they get
[51:43] over in a corner and and and then then
[51:46] they have their big cry or are some
[51:49] don't cry at
[51:51] all so grief is processed in a different
[51:54] way as a Christian we shouldn't grieve
[51:57] as much come on that's right the Bible
[52:00] tells us I read it it brother how's
[52:03] funeral the Bible tells us to Rejoice at
[52:06] the death of a saint we got it backwards
[52:10] we rejoice when the kids born and cry
[52:12] when somebody passes it's supposed to be
[52:14] totally opposite now I'm telling you
[52:17] that's the Bible that's not good news
[52:18] for Modern Men that's the scripture
[52:20] tells us to Rejoice I Rejoice this
[52:23] morning you know why because I said hey
[52:25] I I know that Freda I've known her since
[52:29] she was my first girlfriend I know most
[52:31] y'all know that but she was we were 14
[52:33] 13 14 years old so we've known each
[52:34] other all our life pretty much but she's
[52:36] had a hard life but she's she's faithful
[52:39] at church she's faithful to her F real
[52:41] really faithful to her family but I
[52:43] thought
[52:44] Lord he's one thing for sure you know
[52:48] the Bible tells us and brother Brown
[52:50] tells us that Christians don't die ain't
[52:53] that right come on Christians don't
[52:55] don't
[52:56] die you already died if you're born
[52:59] again tonight you're already dead you
[53:01] died in Christ if you're already dead
[53:04] brother John you can't die
[53:08] again so sister Freda didn't die she
[53:11] just got out of that she just got out of
[53:13] that shell she was in that was full of
[53:16] cancer and hurting and pain and Agony
[53:20] and when she stepped over into that
[53:21] other dimension I'm sure they brother
[53:23] Brown told us he said I'm just going to
[53:25] preach for a minute get off my notes for
[53:27] a second but but brother R said that
[53:29] that God would send somebody down to the
[53:31] river that you
[53:33] know praise God cuz you know what you've
[53:37] never done this before you never died
[53:39] this like this before you never passed
[53:41] from this life into the next life all
[53:43] right right so it's going to make it a
[53:45] lot softer if through that fog her
[53:48] sister Becky died many many years ago
[53:50] long Jo how long Lord I many 40 years
[53:52] ago 30 years ago brother Brown said he
[53:56] saying somebody down there that you
[53:58] know so you've got everybody that was in
[54:00] her life all the way but Becky was her
[54:03] blood sister and she died of cancer
[54:05] years and years ago so there she was
[54:08] standing at the river she said come on
[54:10] say this is what you have been waiting
[54:13] on this right here is what you've been
[54:15] waiting on you're not going back you're
[54:18] going to stay right here for a little
[54:19] while then we all going to go back when
[54:22] we all get out of the way we're going to
[54:24] go back they're going to go back come
[54:26] back
[54:28] here and I tell you one thing for sure
[54:30] and I love
[54:33] this now the Bible talks about are the
[54:37] death angel we s we talk about the death
[54:39] you know death knocking at the door and
[54:40] you talk about death angel well now if a
[54:42] Christian can't die who who comes and
[54:44] gets
[54:46] you when you pass from this life into
[54:48] the next life who comes against you the
[54:50] death angel I don't think so cuz he goes
[54:52] against dead people right
[54:55] so I'm sure the death angel though like
[54:57] well I I got to go down to the hospital
[54:59] there and pick this lady up all of a
[55:02] sudden a man steps into the
[55:05] picture glowing white
[55:08] beautiful he said hey I'll take care of
[55:12] this one amen this one's
[55:16] mine this one's mine I'm Michael I own
[55:19] this place this one's mine Death Angel
[55:21] you just make you just go go get some of
[55:23] them other people this one's mine she
[55:25] accepted me years ago so we're I'm going
[55:27] to help her across I just the way I just
[55:30] that's the way I see it listen remember
[55:32] there's more going on in the other
[55:33] dimension than they are here amen like
[55:36] right now fighting and everything
[55:37] they're going on right now in your mind
[55:40] in
[55:41] mind but the process of grief should be
[55:44] softer as a Christian we should sure
[55:46] we're going to miss her sure we're going
[55:47] to miss all of our loved ones but
[55:49] remember we still got to
[55:51] fight if you're in a battle we're in a
[55:53] battle and I'll read it later on we're
[55:55] in a battle the battle that we're in
[55:57] brother John you were in the war you you
[55:59] don't just stop because one person dies
[56:02] right you got to move on you got to
[56:05] press Paul said press toward the mark of
[56:07] the high calling I got a goal to meet I
[56:09] got some where I got to
[56:12] go if you don't know Jesus Christ
[56:14] tonight that death angel will come and
[56:16] get you and I'll promise you he will not
[56:18] be nice he'll take you in another place
[56:21] just as sure as I'm standing here but if
[56:24] you got to baptis of the Holy Ghost
[56:25] Michael I believe Michael come get you
[56:28] cuz you're part of Michael anyway he's
[56:29] going to say Hey you my family I'm
[56:31] taking you right on in all right don't
[56:32] worry about this oh there's a sting but
[56:36] Paul said death where's your sting grave
[56:39] where's your
[56:41] Victory so let's look just a second
[56:44] before we get started and I know
[56:46] somebody's had uh some people have had
[56:48] questions concerning faith and and and
[56:51] let's just talk his family tonight I
[56:54] guess
[56:56] but we think that well why are all these
[56:59] things happening do we not have faith
[57:02] why are these things happening to us why
[57:04] are the why is this happening why is
[57:06] that happening well let's look at the
[57:08] life of a prophet now we know William
[57:09] Brandon was a prophet he was a holy
[57:11] ghost filled believer a preacher and had
[57:13] a message for the end time for me and
[57:17] you all right everybody with me all
[57:18] right so you would think in our human
[57:21] mind that God would you know he just
[57:22] like step in a room and all the stuff
[57:24] just
[57:25] like I said before you know when you get
[57:28] born again you still get
[57:30] bills yeah still got to make payments
[57:33] groceries still cost a lot more now than
[57:36] they
[57:37] did okay but your battle is not that
[57:40] your battle is what here it's not flesh
[57:42] and blood it's here it's inside right so
[57:45] brother Brandon was a prophet now here's
[57:46] a prophet coming down and he disobeys
[57:50] what God
[57:53] Said right
[57:56] hoping Sharon Rose paid the
[57:58] price come
[58:00] on and every prayer you talk about a man
[58:03] that would stand there and pray for
[58:05] people every night and see them get
[58:07] healed also the stomach issues that he
[58:09] had and I'll read it here just real
[58:10] quick for years he had that stomach
[58:12] issue he'd pray for the sick he'd see
[58:15] cancers fall off people he'd see blind
[58:18] eyes open he'd see deaf ears I'm talking
[58:21] about miracles I'm not talking about
[58:22] just maybe miracles after miracle and
[58:25] he'd go home and be throwing up he
[58:27] couldn't even eat that's a paradox that
[58:30] would be that would drive me
[58:35] crazy but did the death of his wife and
[58:38] child stop him one
[58:42] second
[58:45] no he said the lord
[58:48] giveth the lord taketh
[58:50] away blessed be the name of the Lord and
[58:53] he walked out and he preached until 1965
[58:57] when the Lord took him
[58:59] home and he never
[59:03] stopped some of us would stop roll over
[59:06] play dead
[59:08] whatever also having the stomach issue I
[59:10] read this right here I found this in
[59:12] 1950 brother R said sometimes when I go
[59:14] up in the mountains I have a picture of
[59:15] the audience I set it down maybe by the
[59:17] side of a tree and just kneel and pray
[59:19] and pray and pray God will heal them and
[59:21] it's to my interest my I like to see
[59:23] people get well no one can enjoy
[59:25] appreciate good health any more than I
[59:27] do when I've spent much time been very
[59:29] very sickly in my young days one
[59:32] infirmity especially bothered me was was
[59:34] stomach trouble for years I've drank
[59:37] barley water and eat crackers and maybe
[59:38] start walking and start spitting it
[59:40] right up in other words sometimes I went
[59:42] to all kind of doctors and
[59:47] Clinics just nothing can be done I'm
[59:50] sure he prayed
[59:52] Lord you know Paul did the same thing
[59:54] Paul said Lord Lord can you just take
[59:55] this away from me I got something that
[59:58] buffers buffets me all the time what
[1:00:01] what the Lord say well now Paul this is
[1:00:03] not this is a picnic now we've turned it
[1:00:05] into a picnic not a battle so I'm going
[1:00:07] to take that away from you he you know
[1:00:08] what he tell Paul my grace is sufficient
[1:00:12] for
[1:00:12] you didn't take it away from
[1:00:16] him nothing can help you they give me
[1:00:18] medicine and everything just couldn't
[1:00:20] stop it and I went on just the same
[1:00:22] about seven or eight years constantly
[1:00:24] and I would just eat I would try not to
[1:00:26] look at the table and see people eat and
[1:00:28] sit down I would try to drink my barley
[1:00:30] water you know and maybe a little prune
[1:00:31] juice for breakfast barley water for
[1:00:33] dinner and need a few crackers soda
[1:00:35] crackers with barley water maybe a gram
[1:00:37] cracker occasionally when I see people I
[1:00:39] go to work picking shovel work hard all
[1:00:41] day let's continue on through he weighed
[1:00:43] 118 lbs 20 lb I think that now all these
[1:00:47] years after suffering through that my
[1:00:48] eyes are 2020 he actually almost went
[1:00:50] blind because he lost um nutrients when
[1:00:54] he throw that up he lost nutrients and
[1:00:55] he almost went blind so this is a
[1:00:57] prophet that prayed for people that saw
[1:00:59] miraculous I mean hundreds of thousands
[1:01:01] of Miracles now he said his eyes are
[1:01:03] 2020 in other words God healed him all
[1:01:05] right now he weighed 153 PBS and he very
[1:01:08] thankful
[1:01:10] so that's what a prophet went through so
[1:01:13] let's not
[1:01:14] question our faith because I'm going to
[1:01:17] read you something here in a few minutes
[1:01:18] where the prophet of God tells us that
[1:01:20] your faith is what works the gift right
[1:01:24] amen your faith is what works the gift
[1:01:27] now he had a gift of Divine Healing and
[1:01:29] there were times like like Sunday we saw
[1:01:31] where Sister Mary was having a seizure
[1:01:33] there in the seat and and then we prayed
[1:01:35] the prayer of faith over and now she's
[1:01:37] home and well and they can't find
[1:01:39] nothing wrong with her all right so
[1:01:40] praise God for that we we don't
[1:01:43] sometimes we look at the bad ones and
[1:01:44] don't look at the good ones that was a
[1:01:47] victory brother George preached his
[1:01:49] heart out Sunday and there at the devil
[1:01:51] came in the house and tried to disturb
[1:01:53] us he he had to leave we and then you
[1:01:56] know what the doctors testified that
[1:02:00] everything's okay all right so see we
[1:02:02] got to look at the victories too as long
[1:02:05] as as also looking at
[1:02:07] the so-called amen temporary defeat
[1:02:12] remember Christians never defeated all
[1:02:14] right but we have to go through life and
[1:02:16] we see death and we see life and we see
[1:02:17] all these things and we process grief
[1:02:20] here what brother R says don't judge a
[1:02:22] man because he can pray a prayer of
[1:02:23] faith for the sick and they get
[1:02:26] well don't judge a man because he might
[1:02:28] do some Supernatural Miracle as being a
[1:02:30] sainted
[1:02:32] person but the only way that you can
[1:02:35] judge is by the love that they have for
[1:02:37] Christ and for each
[1:02:41] other what brother B say he said Give Me
[1:02:44] Love take all the gifts away from me
[1:02:47] give me love right because love conquers
[1:02:50] everything all
[1:02:53] right
[1:02:55] listen to
[1:03:00] this he said let's bow heades for a
[1:03:02] moment talking about fight with what we
[1:03:06] have watch what brother Brown says I
[1:03:08] want you to think of this over you say
[1:03:10] brother R I could never preach the
[1:03:12] gospel maybe you're not supposed
[1:03:14] to I I could never have faith for the
[1:03:17] sick maybe you're not supposed
[1:03:19] to I could never sing like them singers
[1:03:22] from Sweden and around I could never do
[1:03:24] that
[1:03:25] maybe you're not supposed to but what
[1:03:27] you have won't you rise today and go
[1:03:32] towards the darkest spot and fight as
[1:03:36] only you can fight amen as only you can
[1:03:42] fight well if I had don't get in
[1:03:44] somebody else's corn field don't get in
[1:03:47] somebody else's place stay in yours you
[1:03:50] shall have never done nothing brother
[1:03:52] Ram said sit in a Pew pay your hi and
[1:03:54] pray for
[1:03:56] everybody what did he say was the
[1:03:58] success of his meetings the other one
[1:03:59] time two ladies got in a closet and was
[1:04:02] praying he said that was the success of
[1:04:04] my
[1:04:04] meetings not that he was a prophet not
[1:04:07] that anything he said those two women
[1:04:09] were the success of my meeting brother R
[1:04:11] 1951 says see I'm trying to say that
[1:04:13] it's not for me your faith is what
[1:04:16] operates that without faith there's
[1:04:18] nothing you can't receive anything the
[1:04:21] people who beat him on the head with a
[1:04:23] stick said prophesy there was no virtue
[1:04:25] at all for them it's those who
[1:04:29] believe 1958 Jesus Christ the same
[1:04:32] yesterday brother R said look now
[1:04:35] friends I don't know what more he could
[1:04:36] do I don't know one thing more he could
[1:04:38] do he's proved to you that he's not dead
[1:04:40] He's Alive and in
[1:04:42] here now what good would me do standing
[1:04:46] here anointed if you were out there and
[1:04:49] wouldn't
[1:04:51] believe it takes your faith your faith
[1:04:55] is what touches him and does these
[1:04:57] things it isn't
[1:04:59] me I don't operate that you operate it
[1:05:03] with your own faith is what does it see
[1:05:05] it's you not me you all
[1:05:09] right this man was given a gift of
[1:05:11] Divine Healing but he stands up and says
[1:05:14] you operate
[1:05:15] it what the what the angel said if you
[1:05:17] can get the people to believe you in
[1:05:20] other words believe you can pray believe
[1:05:22] that you can contact God but you still
[1:05:24] can't go up there halfhazard with a
[1:05:26] sucker in your mouth and chewing chewing
[1:05:28] G and popping bubbles right you got to
[1:05:31] go up there with faith and reverence
[1:05:34] listen to
[1:05:36] this it isn't necessary to come up here
[1:05:38] and kneel down and pray through until
[1:05:40] you're saved you're saved already but
[1:05:42] you have to accept it your praying
[1:05:44] doesn't do it your faith is what you're
[1:05:47] saved by not by prayer wow but by faith
[1:05:52] are you saved same thing by healing I'm
[1:05:54] sure we all understand that 1956 what
[1:05:57] Visions are't up here in Old Spindale
[1:06:00] North Carolina where brother Joe Green
[1:06:02] living up there close see your faith is
[1:06:05] not what you feel your faith is what you
[1:06:07] believe remember faith is a substance
[1:06:09] faith is Fai listen I was talking to
[1:06:11] somebody
[1:06:12] today we hope is
[1:06:16] good it's good to start out with hope
[1:06:18] but if I just hope I got to church
[1:06:21] tonight no I had faith I was going to
[1:06:23] get here
[1:06:25] and guess what when I arrive I don't
[1:06:26] have to have faith to get here anymore
[1:06:27] brother I'm already
[1:06:29] here so believe in what you're in get in
[1:06:32] what you're in have faith for the
[1:06:34] journey but right here is where it's all
[1:06:36] over
[1:06:38] with hundreds of people look that's what
[1:06:41] happened here at the platform when I
[1:06:43] would when I have healing Services
[1:06:44] hundreds of people that way they come to
[1:06:46] the platform oh brother random I got all
[1:06:48] Faith what now this is the prophet if it
[1:06:51] was ink it wouldn't da an eye
[1:06:56] right I'm just telling you what he's
[1:06:58] saying see you got hope instead of faith
[1:07:02] faith is positive right there's no
[1:07:05] nothing can move it it's positive no
[1:07:07] matter how sick you got how everything
[1:07:10] went nothing now if you're trying to
[1:07:11] Bluff it it won't take bluffing the
[1:07:14] Devil he's a bluff himself and he knows
[1:07:17] how to run a bluff but when you got the
[1:07:19] goods it don't take loud
[1:07:22] hollering right M don't take stomping
[1:07:25] and screaming we see a lot of that
[1:07:27] that's truly unnecessary it takes
[1:07:31] Faith he will recognize it don't worry
[1:07:35] just say the word
[1:07:37] am one quote watch this brother R 1951
[1:07:40] talking about the angel of Lord he's
[1:07:41] explaining the gift he said your faith
[1:07:43] is what operates the Divine
[1:07:46] gift your

[1:09:11] Tabernacle and somebody did her funeral
[1:09:13] when brother R got back you're going to
[1:09:14] see here in a minute Prophet makes a
[1:09:18] mistake no
[1:09:22] tomatoes he'll tell you he did he said
[1:09:25] God you owe me an understanding in other
[1:09:27] words you owe me an explanation of why
[1:09:29] that woman died and you pronounced her
[1:09:31] healed so let's read
[1:09:33] it one day I come home about four years
[1:09:35] ago or five something like that and this
[1:09:37] young girl which was about 8 years old
[1:09:39] when she was on the Cradle roll she had
[1:09:41] been married and had two children she
[1:09:43] was lying in the hospital out there at
[1:09:44] the point of death she was about 4
[1:09:47] months old five with a baby and the baby
[1:09:50] had died and they couldn't operate cuz
[1:09:51] she had ureic Google that I didn't and
[1:09:55] they couldn't operate so had to let the
[1:09:57] mother die too can't operate see the
[1:10:00] baby would kill her like that so they
[1:10:02] she was just dying that's all wasn't no
[1:10:04] chance for her I went out to see her she
[1:10:07] had sent for me went to the hospital she
[1:10:10] was under the oxygen tin I raised up the
[1:10:12] little flap talked to her a little bit
[1:10:13] and I said you remember me she said sure
[1:10:16] brother Bill I remember you how is the
[1:10:18] do you understand how sick you are yes I
[1:10:20] do said that's why I sent for you I said
[1:10:23] well how is it with you and the Lord she
[1:10:26] said brother Bill I I I'm not ready to
[1:10:29] go well there we got down and prayed and
[1:10:32] her mother and her husband many of them
[1:10:33] in the room and her mother and husband
[1:10:34] started crying and then I asked her and
[1:10:37] she got right with God paid her vows
[1:10:40] come back and made God the promise and
[1:10:42] if she'd be forgiven how she'd love him
[1:10:43] and sorry for her sins the way she'd
[1:10:45] live now this is working out to be a
[1:10:48] miracle
[1:10:49] story so
[1:10:52] far and when went on with her repentance
[1:10:54] and crying and after a while I got up
[1:10:56] and went out of the building and the
[1:10:58] next morning they called me up to come
[1:11:01] back down there and come to find out
[1:11:02] they come in that morning for a test to
[1:11:04] see how the ureic condition had Advanced
[1:11:06] and found out she didn't have a speck of
[1:11:08] it it was all gone every bit of it Ure
[1:11:12] ureic poison had left her the doctors
[1:11:14] were so excited till they said my why it
[1:11:17] something very
[1:11:18] strange we'll get her ready and if it's
[1:11:21] still that way by the morning said we'll
[1:11:22] keep giving her pen sing and whatever
[1:11:24] there was giving her keeping the
[1:11:25] infection down will'll operate take the
[1:11:28] dead baby before it sets some in
[1:11:29] something else said if she's all right
[1:11:31] then all right well two or three times
[1:11:33] that day they tested her again and that
[1:11:35] night late they tested her and nothing
[1:11:36] was wrong perfectly all right prepped
[1:11:39] her took her out from under the oxygen
[1:11:40] tin everything was fine they was going
[1:11:41] to operate on her the next morning take
[1:11:43] the baby well I went out there because
[1:11:45] that was a that this was done now I

[1:13:09] The Journey she had so much confidence
[1:13:11] in brother R praying for and everything
[1:13:13] was all right and done she was just not
[1:13:15] going to you know she was not going to
[1:13:16] allow that thought to come in her mind
[1:13:18] she said this is the end of the this is
[1:13:19] the end of the journey oh she said now
[1:13:22] what's the matter said the end of the
[1:13:23] journey said yes Mother within a few
[1:13:25] minutes I'll be gone well she thought
[1:13:28] she just got nervous and Delirious she
[1:13:30] called the nurse nurse took her
[1:13:31] respiratory respiration everything was
[1:13:33] normal and within five minutes she was
[1:13:35] gone she was
[1:13:37] dead then when I came back home in a
[1:13:40] week or two he'd been gone I think
[1:13:41] brother Graham preached the girl's
[1:13:42] funeral when I come back home and M told
[1:13:44] me that girl died that night my couldn't
[1:13:46] I went to see the mother yeah and I I
[1:13:48] don't know what caused me to do it now
[1:13:50] watch it's a prophet but I said Lord God
[1:13:52] you owe me an
[1:13:55] understanding see after me going out
[1:13:57] there and telling that husband and him
[1:13:59] coming to the Lord after you've done
[1:14:00] these things for him and all like that
[1:14:03] and then take that girl's life I said
[1:14:04] you owe me an understanding let me stop
[1:14:07] there real quick don't ever tell God
[1:14:12] that I don't care if you're a prophet
[1:14:14] priest or a king don't ever tell God
[1:14:15] that cuz watch what happens when you
[1:14:18] tell God something like that he'll leave
[1:14:20] you sitting
[1:14:22] alone he don't owe me nothing I'm in
[1:14:26] debt to him well he just let me pout it
[1:14:28] out for a few days now watch few days
[1:14:30] now look then he said and after three or
[1:14:32] four
[1:14:34] months one day I was out in the creek
[1:14:36] Bank the Lord spoke to me in the vision
[1:14:37] and said now go to her mother and say
[1:14:39] this to her mother did not her time come
[1:14:42] the year before when she was drowning in
[1:14:44] a creek on a picnic she should have went
[1:14:46] at that time now look at the Providence
[1:14:49] and sovereignty of God she should have
[1:14:52] died right then but by forn knowledge he
[1:14:54] knew if he'd give her a little more time
[1:14:56] she'd make it right thank God thank God
[1:14:59] he did that for all of us right amen yes
[1:15:02] sir she should have went at that time
[1:15:04] but I had to take her when she was ready
[1:15:06] to go she wasn't ready then and that's
[1:15:10] why all this happened and why you went
[1:15:12] out there then I got down and cried I
[1:15:14] said Lord Jesus forgive me you're poor
[1:15:16] stupid servant I should have never said
[1:15:18] that Lord and I went back down to the
[1:15:20] lady and she lived over on Market Street
[1:15:22] went over to her and I said I going to
[1:15:23] ask you a question sure brother Bill is
[1:15:25] it true that this girl almost drowned
[1:15:27] she said that's right brother bradam
[1:15:28] said her husband they had to get her out
[1:15:30] of the creek they had to use artificial
[1:15:32] respiration to pump pressure they had to
[1:15:33] get a machine pump the water out of her
[1:15:35] had her skirt on she was having a picnic
[1:15:37] she was out there stepped on some sand
[1:15:39] slipped off over her head and strangled
[1:15:42] in the water they didn't notice her and
[1:15:43] directly they seen her coming up and
[1:15:44] going down anyway she almost
[1:15:47] died I said that was her time to go cuz
[1:15:51] that's what God Said see God knows what
[1:15:54] he's
[1:15:55] doing I'm telling you tonight whatever
[1:15:57] we have a question and I know we do in
[1:15:59] our mind we question uh you know Sister
[1:16:02] Freda and we question brother Hal we
[1:16:04] question all the different ones and we
[1:16:06] question God that's okay you better
[1:16:08] question him inside your heart
[1:16:10] though and do it real
[1:16:13] gingerly cuz he don't ow you an
[1:16:15] explanation he don't ow us no an
[1:16:18] explanation see God knows what he's
[1:16:20] doing now the Lord probably would have
[1:16:21] told look now the the Lord probably
[1:16:23] would have told me that if I hadn't
[1:16:25] taken the attitude that I
[1:16:29] did when I said Lord you owe me to tell
[1:16:32] me about that he don't owe you
[1:16:37] nothing isaah 648 said but now oh Lord
[1:16:41] Thou Art Our Father we are the clay Thou
[1:16:44] Art the Potter and we are all are the
[1:16:48] work of thy hand Romans 9:20 says NE but
[1:16:52] old man who are thou that repliest to
[1:16:54] God shall the thing formed say to him
[1:16:57] that formed it why hast Thou made me
[1:16:58] thus hath not the Potter power over the
[1:17:02] clay praise God of the same lump to make
[1:17:05] one vessel unto honor and one unto
[1:17:07] dishonor what if God willing to show his
[1:17:10] wrath and make his power known endure
[1:17:12] endured with which longsuffering the
[1:17:15] vessels of Wrath fitted to
[1:17:19] destruction there's a group over here
[1:17:21] and there's a group over here God made
[1:17:23] them
[1:17:25] both God made them both it's their
[1:17:28] choice their faith or non-faith this
[1:17:31] what makes the
[1:17:33] difference
[1:17:34] right so yeah we question why God take
[1:17:37] we question there was there's several
[1:17:38] people in this building that that their
[1:17:40] their husbands have passed away at
[1:17:42] a at a very young
[1:17:45] age and we we wonder and but but let's
[1:17:49] not number one don't fault yourself
[1:17:52] don't fault God for one don't fault
[1:17:54] yourself there's a Providence of God let
[1:17:57] me read this right here real
[1:17:58] quick God is Sovereign now that mean
[1:18:01] when you say sovereignty that means he
[1:18:04] has complete control there's nobody he
[1:18:06] has to have counsel with now the Bible
[1:18:08] tells us that but he has sovereignty
[1:18:11] means if we're a sovereign country that
[1:18:13] means no other country can tell us what
[1:18:15] to do we have a sovereign Church no one
[1:18:16] can come in here and tell us what to do
[1:18:18] cuz we're Sovereign we are our own so
[1:18:21] God is his own he is sovereign we need
[1:18:23] to put it in his hands that he knows the
[1:18:26] end from the beginning not us God is
[1:18:29] Sovereign this is a 1964 Harvest Time
[1:18:32] brother R say when he who could tell God
[1:18:35] how to make things in the beginning when
[1:18:37] there was just him by
[1:18:39] himself see if we have eternal life
[1:18:41] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:18:43] and that's God so if we have eternal
[1:18:45] life if you haven't now we were with God
[1:18:48] right then a part of God we were his
[1:18:51] attribute we were we are now his
[1:18:53] attribute because in the beginning was a
[1:18:55] word where was a thought expressed so we
[1:18:57] were his thought then we were expressed
[1:18:59] down
[1:19:00] here so we were his thoughts then
[1:19:03] expressed in the word it became what we
[1:19:04] are in other words we became into human
[1:19:06] form to prove
[1:19:09] God God's going to prove to the world
[1:19:12] through us through the bride who he
[1:19:14] really is cu they're not going to see
[1:19:16] him again they going to see you all
[1:19:18] right and if it wasn't there then never
[1:19:21] will be in other words remember I said
[1:19:22] before God doesn't change his
[1:19:24] mind if he loved you before the
[1:19:26] foundation of the world praise God he
[1:19:28] loves you today he never didn't love you
[1:19:31] he can't not love you if he loved you
[1:19:32] one time thank God for the sovereignty
[1:19:35] of the Lord that we can put our assurity
[1:19:37] on that one person that he can do that
[1:19:40] we can't we're shifted as sand is we
[1:19:43] have our ups and we have our downs we
[1:19:44] have our good days and bad days have
[1:19:46] people taken out of our life we have
[1:19:47] people put into our life just to
[1:19:49] persecute
[1:19:51] you true true the Potter as Roman well
[1:19:57] it's for your benefit if you're a child
[1:19:58] of God it's for your
[1:20:01] benefit the Potter as Roman 8 tells us
[1:20:03] who can tell the Potter can the clay say
[1:20:05] make me thus thus see no God has to
[1:20:08] display all of his attributes and
[1:20:10] tonight you and I are part of the
[1:20:11] attribute of god sister Freda was an
[1:20:14] attribute of God in his choosing and
[1:20:16] sovereignty to take her out of her pain
[1:20:18] and her despair he took her home right
[1:20:21] no question
[1:20:24] see no God has to display all of his
[1:20:26] attributes so he has to make one vessel
[1:20:28] Of Dishonor the other one to honor to
[1:20:30] show that one show that one up of course
[1:20:35] now but he is Sovereign you see nobody
[1:20:37] can tell him what to do and he makes us
[1:20:40] different even we're told in the Bible
[1:20:43] that the star is different one from
[1:20:45] another one star different from another
[1:20:47] you know there is a difference in heaven
[1:20:49] in angels Angelic beings there's Angels
[1:20:52] cheram s
[1:20:53] and they're different they we're all
[1:20:55] different and God has big mountains
[1:20:56] Plains prairies grass Desert Water he's
[1:20:59] different he's a god of variety but he's
[1:21:03] still Sovereign you can't take away from
[1:21:06] that listen to
[1:21:08] this and we wonder we and we do Wonder
[1:21:11] we wonder why some get he now brother
[1:21:12] Brown tells us that a prostitute could
[1:21:14] come by and get healed and a real saint
[1:21:16] of God loser healing all
[1:21:19] right 1965 not not pro his word I cannot
[1:21:23] you say what about me I could not tell
[1:21:26] you it's Sovereign all the works of God
[1:21:28] is
[1:21:29] Sovereign there will be many people
[1:21:31] healed Crossing this platform tonight
[1:21:34] everybody with me stay with me just for
[1:21:36] a minute it's only
[1:21:38] 8:00 that's late for old people but like
[1:21:42] me but I'm
[1:21:44] awake there will be many people healed
[1:21:47] Crossing this platform tonight there
[1:21:49] will probably be many not
[1:21:56] it's all in the Sovereign of
[1:22:00] God who can tell him what to do no one
[1:22:03] he works according to his own will his
[1:22:06] own plan Philippians 3:13 Brethren I
[1:22:09] count it not myself to have apprehended
[1:22:11] but there's one thing forgetting those
[1:22:13] things which are
[1:22:15] behind and reaching forth into those
[1:22:17] things which are before let's read it
[1:22:19] right here Paul says I press toward the
[1:22:22] Mark of the prize of the High Calling of
[1:22:24] God in Christ Jesus we's stop here just
[1:22:28] for a minute talk about being in a
[1:22:30] battle and not a picnic when you are in
[1:22:33] a battle and brother George bless his
[1:22:35] heart he's from Ireland but he know
[1:22:36] knows more about the Civil War and every
[1:22:38] battle that was ever fought in a Civil
[1:22:40] War and what should have happened if
[1:22:41] this one moved this way and what would
[1:22:42] have happened if Le would have went that
[1:22:44] way and what would have happened if this
[1:22:45] one would have moved he's got a
[1:22:46] chessboard and he just plays like this
[1:22:47] with battles I don't even know who
[1:22:50] fought any War except Lee and Grant
[1:22:53] that's only two and Long Street cuz he
[1:22:54] lived
[1:22:55] here that's all I know but he knows them
[1:22:58] all brother John and he's like well see
[1:23:00] that's a battle you have a battle plan
[1:23:03] but remember when you
[1:23:06] charge you made a
[1:23:09] commitment you made a commitment when
[1:23:11] you say I can charge and I can take this
[1:23:13] hill you have made a commitment and when
[1:23:15] you head out of those woods every gun of
[1:23:17] the devil is going to be on top of
[1:23:20] you the only way for you to survive is
[1:23:23] the sovereignty of God live knowing
[1:23:25] you'll make
[1:23:27] it knowing you'll make it but you got to
[1:23:31] go through the battle to know whether
[1:23:34] you can make it or
[1:23:35] not we were talking and it it just hit
[1:23:38] me I was preaching for brother Ron
[1:23:40] Spencer several years ago in Virginia
[1:23:43] and of course you know a lot of the
[1:23:44] they're they're from Virginia and most
[1:23:47] of the Confederate battles were fought
[1:23:49] in Virginia Pittsburgh you know
[1:23:51] Gettysburg right in that Virginia
[1:23:53] shannona Valley Place there was 600,000
[1:23:57] men killed in those in the war the four
[1:23:59] years of war 600,000 men so if they had
[1:24:03] not had children course most of them
[1:24:05] were young kids like 17 16 they lied
[1:24:07] about their age some were 14 15 if they
[1:24:10] died brother John brother
[1:24:12] John then then their progeny or their
[1:24:16] generation was cut off they they if they
[1:24:17] didn't have children surely being dead
[1:24:20] they couldn't have anymore right
[1:24:23] but how'd you get here that's why I
[1:24:25] asked them up there you know 200 people
[1:24:26] in brother ry's congregation I said
[1:24:28] how'd you get
[1:24:29] here you had somebody that fought in a
[1:24:31] civil war in your family if you live
[1:24:33] here long enough amen I said there was
[1:24:37] an
[1:24:39] angel that was an angel that watched
[1:24:41] over whoever that was in those
[1:24:44] battles and moved your head over one way
[1:24:47] or move that bullet over you think I'm
[1:24:48] crazy no I ain't
[1:24:50] crazy it's a sovereignty of God to get
[1:24:53] you here didn't brother R say he bred
[1:24:54] this one to this one this one to this
[1:24:55] one this one this to get you here right
[1:24:58] right so you're
[1:25:00] here
[1:25:02] fight fight to win though don't fight
[1:25:05] just to
[1:25:06] play Paul said I press or push toward
[1:25:09] the mark of the prize of the High
[1:25:10] Calling of God in Christ Jesus 1
[1:25:12] Corinthians 9:12 I therefore so run not
[1:25:16] as uncertainly now watch so fight I not
[1:25:19] as one that now what kind of fight is
[1:25:24] that you Bea in the
[1:25:28] air no what do he saying I have a
[1:25:31] purpose for every punch that I amen put
[1:25:35] out am I have a
[1:25:37] purpose remember Muhammad Ali you know
[1:25:40] brother um J for he love Muhammad Ali
[1:25:43] love boxing but love Muhammad Ali he
[1:25:45] said know Muhammad Ali be boxing and
[1:25:46] said you'd think you'd hit him three or
[1:25:48] four times and you know they do that
[1:25:49] thing where they grab you to try to get
[1:25:50] their breath back you know he said he'd
[1:25:53] whisper in the ear of that opponent he
[1:25:54] said I'm going to knock you out in a few
[1:25:56] minutes then get back he I'm going to
[1:25:59] knock you out in a few minutes and he
[1:26:01] probably most of the time did but that
[1:26:03] was a confidence that he had but he
[1:26:05] wasn't beating the air so God's not
[1:26:07] beating the air any move that we make
[1:26:10] should be a move that God has sh saw
[1:26:12] that we make good or bad in different I
[1:26:14] mean we we make mistakes but Paul says
[1:26:17] I'm going to run not
[1:26:20] uncertainly that's like it Gettysburg
[1:26:22] you know at Gettysburg it was a great
[1:26:24] battle you know uh the South got whipped
[1:26:26] pretty bad but there was a time in a
[1:26:29] time in there that they could have won
[1:26:31] the war they could have won that battle
[1:26:33] not the war but the battle if they had
[1:26:36] made a certain
[1:26:37] move they were
[1:26:39] uncertain about a certain area and they
[1:26:41] didn't go to it well the union got it
[1:26:43] and it was high ground and they got
[1:26:45] whipped you and I as Christians we
[1:26:49] shouldn't be uncertain about what God's
[1:26:51] done for us and what he's going to do
[1:26:53] for us and it doesn't M listen they're
[1:26:57] going to fall in
[1:26:59] battle I may fall you may fall but
[1:27:02] somebody is going to make
[1:27:04] it somebody is going to stand one day
[1:27:08] and say death you've lost the great
[1:27:15] battle 1 Timothy 6:12 said fight the
[1:27:18] what good fight oh W you well
[1:27:22] you oh is me no come on that's right
[1:27:28] bring it
[1:27:30] on you say you're crazy no I want this
[1:27:33] thing to get going I want it to be over
[1:27:35] with I want somebody to stand on their
[1:27:37] own two feet and do as a prophet said
[1:27:40] when death comes up your arm you just
[1:27:42] go wipe it right off right fight the
[1:27:47] good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal
[1:27:51] life where where unto thou are also
[1:27:53] called and has professed a good
[1:27:55] profession now listen I was talking to
[1:27:58] somebody
[1:27:59] today
[1:28:01] um sister Freda her profession was
[1:28:05] perfect you you never knew she was
[1:28:09] sick but the Lord by Providence and by
[1:28:12] sovereignty took her home last night but
[1:28:15] you never really knew because Jun and I
[1:28:17] talked to her two weeks ago two
[1:28:18] Wednesdays ago we were going home and
[1:28:20] she wanted to talk about
[1:28:23] the
[1:28:24] end and she's like I'm good I feel okay
[1:28:27] so they're going to do this certain
[1:28:29] thing and this certain thing and a
[1:28:30] certain thing and Janet said she talked
[1:28:32] to her a couple days ago so her
[1:28:35] profession was and how many of you know
[1:28:37] my dad most of you know my dad grew up
[1:28:39] with him how many times have you ever
[1:28:40] seen him profess he was
[1:28:44] sick how you feel doc I feel great
[1:28:47] watch's that lump on your head I'm
[1:28:50] fine but it's a profession you got to
[1:28:52] profess it to possess it right and has
[1:28:56] professed a good profession before many
[1:29:00] witnesses so you can't just go to one
[1:29:01] person brother yours you got to go to
[1:29:03] the world everywhere you go you got to
[1:29:05] profess that you're a Christian doesn't
[1:29:07] matter if you lay on your deathbed God
[1:29:10] Stills A Healer now brother R tells us
[1:29:12] that he said brother R said I couldn't
[1:29:13] find it because I couldn't word it right
[1:29:15] brother R said if God never decides to
[1:29:18] not heal another person he said I'll
[1:29:19] still preach Divine Healing now how in
[1:29:21] the World cuz he's looking at something
[1:29:24] different besides all the circumstances
[1:29:26] he's looking at a prize you and I should
[1:29:28] be looking at a prize we know and we we
[1:29:31] we know as human beings there's gaps
[1:29:33] left in our life but God will fill them
[1:29:36] up he said he would he said he never put
[1:29:39] more on you than you can stand but you
[1:29:41] just don't really know how much you can
[1:29:42] stand until he puts it on you that's
[1:29:45] right that's what sister um nma Jeff
[1:29:50] remember junior he passed away he was
[1:29:52] but what 50 maybe at the most have brain
[1:29:54] cancer and passed away and she said wait
[1:29:58] why why would God take him of course you
[1:30:00] can say that that's okay to question
[1:30:02] like that why would God take him I said
[1:30:04] well I said the only thing I can tell
[1:30:05] you is nma is God knows you could take
[1:30:09] it cuz I'd go back crazy if that woman
[1:30:11] over there
[1:30:12] died put me in
[1:30:16] Asylum don't you
[1:30:19] die thank you yes ma'am
[1:30:23] but I said God knew you could handle it
[1:30:28] or he wouldn't put it on you cuz he said
[1:30:29] he not put more on you than you can take
[1:30:31] can we not start listening to what God's
[1:30:33] already said about us come on and hang
[1:30:37] on to that that's right we know it's
[1:30:39] going to be a battle but listen those
[1:30:41] battles at Gettysburg and Sharpsburg and
[1:30:43] all those different places they were
[1:30:45] battles that that were many questions
[1:30:46] and many mistakes and you who knew was
[1:30:49] going to win that battle we we know who
[1:30:52] wins this
[1:30:53] battle we know we win this battle and
[1:30:56] sister Freda won her
[1:31:00] battle and all the different ones has
[1:31:02] passed on we got a whole we've been here
[1:31:05] 52 years brother and we've got a lot of
[1:31:07] people that's passed on but we've got a
[1:31:09] thing downstairs it's our little Hall of
[1:31:12] of U people returning from at eight we
[1:31:15] took a picture of at 18 or 20 years old
[1:31:16] like brother R said and they're on a
[1:31:18] wall downstairs that's what they'll look
[1:31:19] like we not see Freda see I know her cuz
[1:31:22] I knew her when we were 13 14 years old
[1:31:24] pretty pretty blonde
[1:31:26] girl I have to say and that's what
[1:31:29] she'll be she'll be 18 years old she
[1:31:32] won't be the freedom with no hair
[1:31:34] wrinkles whatever was there was gray no
[1:31:38] never see that again brother Tatum for
[1:31:40] y'all that knew him you know he had so
[1:31:41] much arthritis his hands were were like
[1:31:44] this never will we see that again never
[1:31:48] will we see brother Al struggling for
[1:31:51] breath or our our brother Gary uh
[1:31:53] struggling for breath Brother Gary
[1:31:56] Atkins we'll never see that
[1:31:59] again listen we'll never even hear a
[1:32:02] cough out of
[1:32:04] them praise
[1:32:06] God what a mighty God we serve that has
[1:32:09] preserved us told us what we're going to
[1:32:12] be that's right that's why the prophet
[1:32:15] of God could stand there and
[1:32:17] say I'm scared of
[1:32:19] this he was standing in the sixth
[1:32:21] Dimension he said if I got to go back
[1:32:23] and get in that they said yeah your
[1:32:25] time's not done yet you got to go back
[1:32:26] down there and get in that body he said
[1:32:29] why I think I'll just stay here fight
[1:32:32] the good fight of Faith lay hold on
[1:32:33] eternal life where thou are called all
[1:32:35] right you're we're called for this and
[1:32:37] has professed a good profession before
[1:32:39] many witnesses second Timothy 4:7 we'll
[1:32:43] finish right
[1:32:44] here I have fought a good
[1:32:47] fight I have finished my
[1:32:50] course I have kept the
[1:32:54] faith continue with a crown of life has
[1:32:57] been laid up for
[1:32:59] me like brother George was talking and
[1:33:02] I've always said you can't hurt a
[1:33:06] theophany you can't hurt a
[1:33:09] theophany when Paul put his head on that
[1:33:11] chopping block whatever Mom and Daddy
[1:33:14] brought was laying on that shopping
[1:33:16] block right he was a human he was a
[1:33:18] mortal but inside that man was a
[1:33:20] theophany
[1:33:22] and when they chopped his head off
[1:33:23] brother he didn't have to pick his head
[1:33:25] up in another
[1:33:26] dimension there's not a Gun there's not
[1:33:29] a knife there's not a nuclear bomb
[1:33:31] nothing can harm your soul if you're
[1:33:33] born
[1:33:34] again listen freda's sickness wasn't in
[1:33:36] her soul it was in her body all right
[1:33:40] her soul was redeemed Eternal and
[1:33:42] because you know why that's what she
[1:33:43] that's what pulled her into that other
[1:33:46] dimension it matched what was here and
[1:33:48] here and it come together if it wasn't
[1:33:52] then she went somewhere else but it
[1:33:56] matched and they just said come on come
[1:33:59] in wait for a little while Fred's
[1:34:04] like I looked at my hand and my hands
[1:34:09] were new I looked at my
[1:34:13] feet well jul says feets I looked at my
[1:34:17] feet and my feet were two I looked all
[1:34:21] All Around All Around Me Shine won't it

[1:34:30] going to talk to people people that went
[1:34:33] on before and said hey don't
[1:34:35] worry just sit right here for a little
[1:34:37] while and I like what brother George
[1:34:39] told his wife see there's another one
[1:34:41] brother George Quinn he lost his wife in
[1:34:43] March of this year a man of Faith a man
[1:34:47] of absolute Faith he watched his wife
[1:34:50] for two years
[1:34:52] with dementia go down down down and pass
[1:34:55] he said he was sitting there looking at
[1:34:57] her and he said all of a sudden he said
[1:34:59] I'm praise God a milky white substance
[1:35:03] came up out of her
[1:35:05] body and then
[1:35:08] disappeared you don't have to open the
[1:35:10] door to get your soul
[1:35:12] out yeah there ain't nothing formed of
[1:35:14] man down here if you died at Fort Knox
[1:35:17] in the middle of the in the middle of of
[1:35:21] the uh wherever they put the money well
[1:35:23] it ain't there no more cuz we ain't got
[1:35:24] nothing but but your soul wouldn't have
[1:35:27] to wait till somebody dialed the right
[1:35:29] number to get you out of that box and
[1:35:31] they listen they ain't going to have to
[1:35:33] pull your body out of a grave either
[1:35:35] when you come back into
[1:35:39] Resurrection I have fought a good fight
[1:35:42] I finished my court I have
[1:35:45] kept the
[1:35:47] faith and he was heading toward his
[1:35:49] death he knew knew but Paul knew he had
[1:35:54] persecuted the Christians for years and
[1:35:56] years and years and that was always in
[1:35:58] his mind that's why that's why he told
[1:36:01] us though forgetting those things which
[1:36:05] pass
[1:36:07] amen let's go to the High
[1:36:11] Calling of God in
[1:36:15] Christ if we go by the
[1:36:18] grave so what
[1:36:21] God chooses to leave us here for the
[1:36:23] change of the body that would be
[1:36:27] beautiful but I'll promise you one

[1:36:55] musicians come on as human beings we all
[1:36:57] have
[1:36:58] questions it's okay to question but
[1:37:00] what's what happened to brother Brandon

[1:37:04] God you owe me an explanation in other
[1:37:06] words an understanding and God's
[1:37:12] like no I don't and I'm going to let you
[1:37:14] cry about it for a few months before I

[1:45:06] the North had the most people the L the
[1:45:08] the North had the most
[1:45:10] guns but the South had a
[1:45:14] resolve they didn't want them people in
[1:45:16] their territory well you can call it
[1:45:18] right or wrong if you want to that's
[1:45:20] okay but take the analogy of this okay
[1:45:23] they didn't want them people on their
[1:45:25] territory cuz they were Southerners and
[1:45:27] they were proud of being Southerners
[1:45:28] well why can't be proud of being a

[1:45:34] somebody comes on your territory that's
[1:45:37] right they get out of here amen you have
[1:45:40] the authority in the name of Jesus
[1:45:42] Christ to do those things your children
