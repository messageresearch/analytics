[0:00] BL you Saints it's good to be in the
[0:01] house of the Lord this morning and we're
[0:03] certainly glad to be here with Brother
[0:06] David and come expecting y'all pull on
[0:09] the word this morning like you want
[0:14] it and this morning we've been studying
[0:16] on Hebrews chapter 13 um the last
[0:20] chapter in the book of Hebrews and just
[0:23] reading
[0:25] um uh studying out uh let Brotherly Love
[0:28] continue
[0:31] um I've got this picture of Paul what he
[0:34] might have looked like may maybe who
[0:37] knows let's go to the Lord in prayer
[0:40] Lord God we're so grateful to be able to
[0:41] gather around your word and to be able
[0:43] to look into these things Lord and we
[0:44] just ask Lord that you'll help our
[0:46] understanding this morning Lord and be
[0:49] with us this morning Lord Jesus be with
[0:50] Brother David as he's preparing Lord
[0:52] Jesus to labor for us this morning and I
[0:54] pray God that you'll set the right
[0:56] atmosphere in our hearts and in this
[0:57] building this morning Lord Jesus for us
[0:59] to receive
[1:00] and Grant it now in your name
[1:03] amen now the first three uh script uh
[1:08] verses in Hebrews chapter 13 are kind of
[1:10] dealing with our relationship to one
[1:12] another as he says in verse one let
[1:15] Brotherly Love continue and as we were
[1:18] studying out the last time we spoke on
[1:20] this it's it's very strange that the
[1:22] only one in the New Testament to use
[1:23] this phrase Brotherly Love is Paul that
[1:26] Paul would would uh tack these two words
[1:28] together of course a lot of other Peter
[1:31] and many others spoke of of of of the
[1:34] concept of um you know Peter talked
[1:36] about brotherly kindness and how we need
[1:39] to love one another but Paul is the only
[1:41] one to put these two words together like
[1:43] this and he said let Brotherly Love
[1:46] continue and be not forgetful to
[1:48] entertain strangers for thereby some
[1:50] have entertained angels unawares in
[1:52] other words we we need to treat even the
[1:53] ones that we don't know very well
[1:55] somebody might show up your your door
[1:56] want some food or a beggar on the street
[1:59] treat everybody treat everybody with
[2:01] this brotherly love because you never
[2:03] know when you might be entertaining an
[2:05] angel and just don't realize it remember
[2:08] them that are in bonds is bound with
[2:10] them so we got to have empathy for one
[2:12] another if somebody's going through
[2:14] something to enter in with them uh
[2:16] that's what you know when somebody comes
[2:18] up for prayer if you can really enter in
[2:19] with them then you'll see something
[2:21] accomplished if you can enter in with
[2:22] love and and enter into the predicament
[2:25] that they're in remember them that are
[2:27] in bonds as bound with them and them
[2:30] which suffer adversity as being
[2:32] yourselves also in the body to be able
[2:35] to identify yourself with their
[2:36] predicament you know sometimes it helps
[2:38] to to remember the things that we have
[2:40] gone through when you see somebody else
[2:41] suffering um like all the examples that
[2:44] have been used in the past somebody
[2:45] going through kidney stones and if
[2:47] you've gone through kidney stones
[2:48] yourself or back trouble and you gone
[2:49] through back trouble yourself you can
[2:51] enter in with that person and identify
[2:53] and really enter in with with prayer for
[2:55] that person or just any any kind of
[2:58] predicament now now you think about what
[3:00] brotherly love is and we'll get into you
[3:03] know when love is expressed love is
[3:05] expressed it becomes kindness and that's
[3:07] what kindness is kindness is Love In
[3:09] Action so we got to when you when you
[3:13] some that that love that you hold in
[3:14] your heart when you begins to express to
[3:16] somebody else there you've got brotherly
[3:18] kindness so Paul is saying let Brotherly
[3:20] Love continue and you think about what
[3:22] Brotherly Love is is really um you know
[3:25] all through your Christian Journey
[3:26] you're expressing love to have it to
[3:28] mature to a place where it's constant
[3:31] and consistent and no matter what the
[3:33] devil can throw at you it's it's it's
[3:36] constant to think about that concept
[3:38] now at the top of this pyramid we've got
[3:41] love but when you're born again in your
[3:44] soul you've got love but what what's
[3:47] happening is it mature it's got to
[3:49] mature and mature and mature until it
[3:51] comes like a bright shining Sun that
[3:53] somebody can uh throw something at slap
[3:55] you on the face or whatever but love
[3:57] answers back and all these things when
[4:00] like it's like a little baby when a
[4:02] little baby's born it's got all the you
[4:04] know the attributes and things that it's
[4:06] going to have when it matures but it's
[4:08] got to it's got to grow and grow and
[4:10] mature a little babies come comes forth
[4:12] and it's you know crying for its mom for
[4:15] milk and but you know how's it going to
[4:17] have knowledge you think well well the
[4:19] baby's got know the baby the baby might
[4:21] mature just just enough to to um say
[4:23] well I I like applesauce and that's
[4:26] maybe all the all the knowledge it has
[4:28] but to have knowledge knowledge where
[4:30] you can look at the stars and recognize
[4:32] that there's stars and look at the Earth
[4:33] and recognize that there's you're
[4:34] standing on a planet and recognize your
[4:36] purpose and that you got a purpose to
[4:38] work and you're going to have a a mate
[4:40] and all those knowledge you can't have
[4:42] that kind of knowledge when you're just
[4:43] a little baby so you grow into it and
[4:46] you can't have knowledge until you got
[4:48] virtue how's a little baby going to be
[4:50] able to open up the Bible and read if it
[4:52] can't stand up on its own two feet you
[4:54] got to have some strength you got to be
[4:56] able to have some strength stand up on
[4:57] your own two feet so you can't have that
[4:59] kind of knowledge until you got virtue
[5:01] you got to have virtue strength first
[5:04] and then you got to have so you got to
[5:05] have you add all these things one to
[5:07] another like Peter said first add to
[5:10] your faith virtue and now once you've
[5:12] really got it sealed in once it's sealed
[5:15] in and constant then then you can add to
[5:19] your virtue the next and add the next
[5:22] and add to the next so you can't have
[5:25] brotherly how are you going to have
[5:26] brotherly love if you don't have
[5:28] knowledge knowledge like when somebody
[5:30] says something mean to you you can
[5:32] recognize that that person is still a
[5:35] Christian because you have knowledge of
[5:36] the difference between Soul spirit and
[5:38] body that the devil might be working in
[5:41] their Spirit to make them make them
[5:42] jealous or make them upset make them
[5:44] have a bad day or something but that
[5:46] doesn't mean they're not a Christian so
[5:49] that's where you can really because you
[5:50] got knowledge that you begin to
[5:52] understand things so now and you've got
[5:55] patience you got to have patience to
[5:57] have brotherly kindness how are you
[5:59] going to be able to deal with somebody
[6:01] and and look at look at the sit see
[6:03] patience we come you might be you might
[6:05] have patience in your natural birth but
[6:08] patience this kind of patience is Godly
[6:11] patience you know I I maybe I'll use my
[6:14] example and I'm saying I'm using myself
[6:16] an example to say I cannot boast of this
[6:18] when I was when I was a young child I I
[6:20] had well you say natural patience I was
[6:23] my mom one time she went to a job
[6:25] interview and she set me over in the
[6:27] corner and I was a little kid and I I
[6:29] was just you know I was that kind of kid
[6:31] I could just sit there and listen and
[6:33] and my mom was in a job interview and I
[6:36] was a kid over in the corner letting her
[6:37] do her job interview and just sitting
[6:39] there and listening now that's natural
[6:41] patience I was I just I was born with
[6:43] just a little good little kid but that
[6:45] ain't got nothing to do with Godly
[6:47] patience Godly patience comes by the new
[6:50] birth you must be born again to have
[6:53] this kind of patience now you might be a
[6:56] kind of a good little kid but that don't
[6:58] mean that you've got this kind of
[7:00] patience this kind of patience means
[7:03] you're standing at the platform and
[7:05] you're saying well I got I got a need
[7:07] God's got to come on the scene he's got
[7:09] 60 seconds left or disaster is going to
[7:11] strike but you well he's going to show
[7:14] up I I know he's going to show up
[7:16] because he promised and yet you don't
[7:18] let it get all out of cater because you
[7:20] know that he promised like the bride
[7:23] that brother Brown talked about waiting
[7:25] for the the the groom to show up she's
[7:27] waiting for the stage coach will she we
[7:29] waiting for Christ to come he promised
[7:31] we know he promised and patience is
[7:33] waiting on him to come now see that's
[7:36] different that's different that kind of
[7:37] Godly patience to wait on God to come
[7:40] and answer his promises different from
[7:42] that natural patience that you might be
[7:44] born with that you're just you're just a
[7:46] good little kid you're you're just you
[7:48] you know and and knowledge where
[7:50] somebody you might have natural
[7:51] knowledge what like some of these
[7:53] lawyers that I work with that they got
[7:55] they got uh two or three degrees and
[7:57] then the law degree on top of that and
[7:59] they they got a degree in chemical
[8:00] engineering and they know how everything
[8:02] works and how everything fits together
[8:03] and how your body works and they they
[8:05] know enough to to talk to somebody that
[8:07] has a chemical engineering degree and
[8:09] then on top of that they got a law
[8:10] degree and that's knowledge but that
[8:12] won't do you any good that won't do you
[8:15] any good in this Christian Journey you
[8:17] got to have Godly knowledge so see where
[8:20] how Paul is saying let Brotherly Love
[8:22] continue you'll have you might you'll
[8:24] have some brotherly love when you're
[8:26] born again you'll have some some love to
[8:28] be able to dis love and you want to love
[8:31] but to have it really mature and
[8:33] manifest so it's so when somebody says
[8:36] something against you that you don't R
[8:38] back ever that it's constant and
[8:41] consistent you cannot have that until
[8:44] those other things are also in you
[8:47] that's why we're adding one to the other
[8:49] I I think one of the most Sublime things
[8:51] that brother R said is say it like I say
[8:54] it just say it like I say it if you say
[8:57] it like brother brandham said it and we
[8:59] preach it like brother brandom said it
[9:01] and we use the pattern that he said
[9:03] everything will come out
[9:05] right add add to our faith virtue add
[9:09] just keep adding these things and when
[9:11] you see these things mature in you and
[9:12] keep building up one after the other
[9:15] that's why it's so important to have the
[9:18] right understanding what you believe
[9:21] matters because these things build one
[9:23] on top of the other one on top of the
[9:25] other until if you've got if you got
[9:28] your foundation wrong
[9:29] if you've got your foundation wrong you
[9:31] will not be able to come to the K
[9:33] headstone if you got something off
[9:35] kilter and the you end up at the end the
[9:39] building looks I'm way off my notes I'm
[9:41] I'm
[9:42] just if you got something off kilter you
[9:46] will not it will the the it's like
[9:48] building a wall and if you don't have
[9:49] the foundation straight you you'll lay
[9:52] one block on to top of the other and the
[9:54] wall will start leaning over and then
[9:56] you then you got a how you going to add
[9:58] that top block on
[9:59] if the walls all off kilter but each of
[10:02] these thing each of these precepts are
[10:04] like little stones that you're adding
[10:06] into your life and you can't you can't
[10:08] add that headstone until you've got the
[10:10] other things all lined up and all built
[10:12] up right so say it like brother randam
[10:15] said it you first you got to have faith
[10:17] you got to have God's faith you got to
[10:20] have his he the Holy Ghost in you and
[10:22] then you add to that now once you once
[10:24] you're born again then you can add then
[10:27] now that you got that strength
[10:29] the holy ghost manifesting in your life
[10:31] now you can add that add to that
[10:34] knowledge and you keep adding adding
[10:36] adding until it's manifesting concrete
[10:39] something that's consistent somebody
[10:41] that you can look at your own self and
[10:42] see that it's there others can look at
[10:44] you and see that it's there and it's
[10:46] manifest that it's on display constant
[10:48] where your where your children can look
[10:50] at you and say he don't R back he's he's
[10:53] patient he's he's not screaming at his
[10:55] wife all the side he's patient and
[10:57] temperate temperate that he's in control
[10:59] control he's in control of his spirit
[11:01] and what's happening as as the word is
[11:04] is built up within you it's casting out
[11:07] the devil that's the second seal he's
[11:09] casting out the devil is being cast out
[11:12] of your spirit so that so that your
[11:14] spirit is is God is in control of your
[11:18] spirit and now see God is is building us
[11:21] up by the word precept upon precept line
[11:24] upon line here a little there a little
[11:26] until you come to the place where
[11:28] brother L love is not just some some
[11:31] little some little maybe something that
[11:32] happens every once in a while but it's
[11:34] something that's constant and
[11:37] consistent now we go back to to the to
[11:41] the dream that sister Shepherd had that
[11:42] brother Bown talked about in Blasphemous
[11:44] names and and we're talking about listen
[11:46] listen as as we study this thing this
[11:48] this this dream out that you think that
[11:51] your rock confession will fall apart but
[11:55] there's got to be something to contain
[11:58] and what that thing is that makes it
[12:00] sticky to hold everything together is
[12:02] the honey of Brotherly Love brotherly
[12:05] kindness that makes everything hold
[12:07] together that make that keeps things
[12:09] from running out now listen to way
[12:11] brother R explain I know this is a
[12:13] little bit small so just listen to this
[12:15] and I know uh I used artificial
[12:18] intelligence to get this um to draw this
[12:20] picture and it's not you know I I I
[12:22] played around with this for a couple
[12:23] hours and I you I couldn't get it quite
[12:26] right but it's pretty close it's pretty
[12:28] close to kind of give was an idea you
[12:30] think about this picture that brother
[12:32] man painted for us as he saw the dream
[12:34] that sister Shepherd had sister Shepherd
[12:36] there at the mount on the top of the
[12:38] mountain a man was standing there
[12:40] pouring water into a rock box and her
[12:43] husband was over there to the side now
[12:45] that was Sister Shepherd put our put
[12:46] ourselves in that place the bride of
[12:48] Christ watching as the messenger of the
[12:50] day pours the water the message into
[12:52] that rock box of our confession and our
[12:55] husband is standing over to the side
[12:57] watching our husband husband and and the
[13:00] water it is it well let's listen he said
[13:03] she dreamed she was up on a mountain she
[13:06] dreamed that she saw a rock box like a
[13:08] framework sitting right in top of this
[13:09] mountain and her husband was just behind
[13:12] her and she saw a large man standing
[13:14] there with work clothes on with sleeves
[13:16] rolled up bailing the most pure water
[13:18] that she ever seen and pouring into this
[13:20] box this Rock Box sitting in top of the
[13:23] mountain and The Rock Box would not hold
[13:27] the water not the rock box is your
[13:29] confession it wouldn't hold something
[13:33] think about this now somebody rubs you
[13:35] the wrong way some and you start I'm not
[13:37] going to hang around them nor I don't I
[13:39] you know you but something's got to hold
[13:42] something's got to hold where even if
[13:43] somebody treats you wrong even if
[13:45] somebody don't you but brotherly
[13:47] kindness just holds everything together
[13:49] the honey of Brotherly kindness no
[13:51] matter what people say to you how people
[13:53] how people treat you something's holding
[13:55] it all together The Rock Box would not
[13:58] hold the water and it rolled right out
[13:59] of there and just bowled up all the
[14:02] trash and sticks and everything in there
[14:05] and bowled it out and rolled down the
[14:06] mountain and it rolled over her feet and
[14:09] she was standing right in that stuff
[14:11] only it didn't stick to her and then she
[14:15] asked why the Box didn't hold it and the
[14:17] man said that is not water that's the
[14:19] Holy Ghost and said nothing will hold it
[14:21] and said then he went back see he said
[14:24] that nothing will hold it but then he
[14:27] went back and got another bucket that
[14:30] that that might be a good sermon to
[14:31] preach God's got another
[14:34] bucket then he went back and got another
[14:36] big bucket and this bucket was full of
[14:40] honey and he poured the honey in there
[14:44] so he's pouring water buckets of water
[14:48] and then he goes and gets a bucket of
[14:49] honey and he poured the honey in there
[14:53] and he said now it will hold now it will
[14:57] hold this
[14:59] and she thought she thought that the box
[15:02] was a rock box was going to burst out
[15:07] and spill the honey now see those those
[15:10] are the situations in life where it
[15:12] looks like it ain't going to hold but it
[15:15] held when the honey was in there but she
[15:18] said she thought that the box was a rock
[15:20] box was going to burst out and spill the
[15:22] honey but it didn't it finally stuck
[15:25] together and held it she turned and went
[15:29] down the mountain going down the
[15:31] mountain she stopped at the bottom of
[15:33] the mountain and looked back she saw
[15:34] five streams of this pure Crystal Water
[15:37] not contaminated by the things that it
[15:39] had went through still pure and clear
[15:41] coming swiftly and brother R talks about
[15:43] how that's Grace going down five streams
[15:46] of Grace then it slowed up then almost
[15:48] fading out and she was wondering would
[15:50] it ever reached the bottom of the
[15:52] mountain five strings and she woke up
[15:56] now I just pulled out some highlights of
[15:58] this this so that we can meditate on the
[16:00] things that brother manam said as he
[16:02] explained this dream The Rock Box would
[16:05] not hold the water the man said that is
[16:08] not water that's the Holy Ghost and said
[16:11] nothing will hold it and Rockbox is Rock
[16:16] confession now like Jesus said in the
[16:19] scripture he said Peter said who Jesus
[16:21] said who does men say I the son of man
[16:23] am that's your
[16:25] confession and each Church age has had
[16:28] that rock confession on up to this rock
[16:30] confession of the Le oosa in this church
[16:33] age the message is being poured into the
[16:36] church yes so that water being poured
[16:38] into that rock box of your confession is
[16:41] the message what was the water doing it
[16:44] was boiling out all the trash that was
[16:47] in it that's what the Holy Ghost Holy
[16:49] Spirit does boils it up now now the
[16:52] honey represented brotherly kindness
[16:54] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and
[16:56] remember kindness is the expr expression
[16:58] of love when love is in action that's
[17:01] kindness so you got love it's got to be
[17:03] on display you got to share it which is
[17:06] this age I just got through telling see
[17:07] of Brotherly kindness the age that we
[17:09] live in now brother Brown said as he
[17:12] went on to explain this he said I'm an
[17:13] old man I see I've got honey being
[17:15] poured in water I'm an old man I was
[17:18] once young and now I'm old I've seen it
[17:20] down through the age do that hear people
[17:22] say I just won't have no more to do with
[17:25] it now see that's our reaction sometimes
[17:28] when people people treat us wrong or
[17:29] they say something that that's what I'm
[17:31] talking about you got to have knowledge
[17:32] before you can have brotherly love to
[17:34] recognize sometimes maybe you're
[17:37] somebody in your family maybe somebody
[17:38] in the church maybe the devil can
[17:41] interact with them in their spirit and
[17:42] make them have a spirit of jealousy make
[17:44] them make just having a bad day stuff of
[17:47] Life somebody will say something to you
[17:49] and it might not that person might not
[17:50] even know what what they're doing what
[17:52] they're saying and you hear somebody say
[17:54] you and treat something do something
[17:56] wrong to you and you say man I I don't
[17:57] want nothing more to do with them and
[17:59] you'll think that that Rockbox
[18:01] confession ain't going to hold oh but
[18:03] with honey in it it's going to hold
[18:05] honey Brotherly Love is going to hold
[18:09] right
[18:11] and something happened to that man so
[18:15] let something happen to that man though
[18:18] and it'll still hold it nearly cures you
[18:21] something on the inside it's that love
[18:23] reaching out that that you still love
[18:25] that brother even though they might have
[18:27] treated you wrong though might they
[18:28] might have done something wrong or said
[18:30] something hurtful to you he thinks oh
[18:32] God I let my precious brother
[18:34] go without making friends with him you
[18:38] see see see it's brotherly love it looks
[18:43] like it won't stick but it does stick
[18:47] the honey it
[18:50] sticks and blasphemous names he said now
[18:53] I should saying this a few days ago
[18:54] thinking that the church will be
[18:55] spiritual enough to catch it and maybe
[18:58] better turn this tape off right now
[19:00] because I don't want to get it out
[19:01] amongst Brethren but you could speak
[19:02] with tongues you could shout you could
[19:04] dance you could cast out Devils do
[19:05] anything you want to and still not have
[19:07] the Holy Ghost didn't them disciples
[19:09] come back rejoicing and shouting because
[19:11] the Devils was subject to them right
[19:13] among them was Judas did not Jesus say
[19:15] in that day when he come that many will
[19:16] come to me and say Lord have not I cast
[19:19] out devils and in your name done Mighty
[19:21] works and I'll say depart from me you
[19:22] workers of iniquity I didn't know you
[19:24] those things are not indication of the
[19:26] Holy Spirit by their fruit you shall
[19:28] know them now what's he talking about
[19:31] you're born again but you want to see it
[19:34] on display yes and that's what the
[19:36] fruits are is the stature of a perfect
[19:38] man that as you grow then you're putting
[19:41] on display that kindness patience
[19:45] Temperance knowledge all those things
[19:47] now it's on display now there's like we
[19:50] brother Wade was talking about in Bible
[19:52] Study last night there's the experience
[19:55] of being born again where you're not
[19:57] looking at like a sensation that
[19:59] happened on a particular day but you're
[20:01] looking at what God has done the
[20:03] experience in your life that now you can
[20:05] see the faith that you believe now is on
[20:08] display and you look back and you've got
[20:10] a journey where you you see that God has
[20:13] brought you somewhere and even though
[20:14] you may not feel it right now you may
[20:16] not feel something but yet God has
[20:19] changed your life to be in Oneness with
[20:22] him and now you believe like he did and
[20:24] you walk like he did and you're acting
[20:26] just like he did that's that's the
[20:29] evidence of the new birth it's not just
[20:32] maybe something that just happened on
[20:33] one particular day but an experience
[20:35] that you have walk through and live
[20:37] through and seeing God take you from
[20:39] point A to point B byy their fruit you
[20:42] shall know them buy their fruit and
[20:44] you'll know them because their Doctrine
[20:46] is on display the word that you have
[20:48] heard is visible and on display where
[20:51] somebody can look at your life and see
[20:53] what you have believed on display
[20:55] because you react differently and you
[20:57] talk differently and the love of God is
[20:59] on display visibly in your life and you
[21:02] say now you say brother Brown do we
[21:03] should we speak with tongues absolutely
[21:06] that's gifts of God but those gifts of
[21:08] God without these virtues in them makes
[21:10] a stumbling block to the unbeliever it's
[21:13] not accepted by God it's a stumbling
[21:16] block why is it a stumbling block it's a
[21:18] stumbling block when somebody says I'm a
[21:20] Christian but yet they they haven't they
[21:23] don't have they're not displaying it yet
[21:26] somebody somebody Strikes Back you and
[21:28] is mean when maybe you have a Bible
[21:30] question and somebody's somebody's mean
[21:32] to you and you wonder you know why are
[21:34] they not patient with me why why why
[21:37] this why that and it'll stumble you and
[21:39] trip you over that's why it's so
[21:41] important for us to seek God and labor
[21:44] and and and and and strive to see these
[21:47] virtues in them because I don't want to
[21:50] be a stumbling block to nobody and we'll
[21:51] see as we study these things out how
[21:53] Paul talks about real kindness as being
[21:56] concerned about how you're presenting
[21:58] the gospel to other people being
[22:00] concerned about where somebody's at he
[22:03] would say well you know somebody some a
[22:05] young Christian might or a young
[22:07] believer might might not want to eat in
[22:09] his day eat something that was offered
[22:10] to Idols because they would think well I
[22:12] don't want to enter into idolatry so
[22:14] he's he's saying well let's be careful
[22:16] when we're presenting somebody to
[22:17] something to some young believer that
[22:20] might be offended in the way that you're
[22:21] presenting it think about those things
[22:23] because ask kindness kindness to think
[22:25] about somebody that maybe they're
[22:27] they're not as mature as you think you
[22:30] are kindness and the sture of a perfect
[22:33] man he said then sixth let's add the
[22:35] Bible said here adding Brotherly Love
[22:38] brotherly kindness now that's a good see
[22:40] how he equated brotherly love with
[22:42] brotherly kindness because kindness is
[22:44] Love In Action so it's the same thing
[22:47] with kindness is on display now that's a
[22:50] good one right here the 67th all right
[22:52] adding brotherly kindness all right when
[22:54] we get to that brotherly kindness put
[22:55] yourself in his place on on the matter
[22:58] now see there's why you can't have
[23:00] brotherly kindness until you have
[23:01] knowledge patience and Temperance cuz
[23:03] you got to have those things to be able
[23:04] to put yourself in his place and put
[23:06] yourself in his shoes and look through
[23:07] his eyes and think about the way that
[23:10] his
[23:10] experiences my brother sinned against me
[23:13] said Peter shall I forgive him he said
[23:14] seven times a day 70 * 7 brotherly
[23:19] kindness now you see if a brother is All
[23:22] Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him
[23:24] see you got to have patience before you
[23:26] have brotherly kindness
[23:28] patience is working out through all
[23:30] those things until it's com coming out
[23:32] in brotherly kindness you got to have
[23:34] patience first be kind to him and
[23:37] kindness is love and action in 1
[23:41] Corinthians 13 He Paul said charity
[23:43] suffer long and is
[23:46] kind in Ephesians 4:32 be you kind one
[23:50] another tender-hearted forgiving one
[23:52] another even as God for Christ's sake
[23:54] hath forgiven you and Colossians 3:12
[23:57] put on there is the elect of God holy
[23:59] and beloved bowels of mercies kindness
[24:02] humbleness of Mind meekness
[24:05] longsuffering now we we'll end on this
[24:07] in just a few moments but let's really
[24:09] dive into what kindness is because if
[24:11] you got to have brotherly kindness you
[24:13] got to know what kindness is and
[24:16] kindness is is Is Love on display it's
[24:18] it's that love that you got now it's in
[24:20] action and you're displaying it but
[24:23] what's so difficult to articulate about
[24:25] kindness is that there's two sides of
[24:27] kindness
[24:28] that's why it's it's and you'll see when
[24:31] I explain this you you take a beggar on
[24:33] the street and you say I want to be kind
[24:35] to this person there's two sides of
[24:38] kindness on the one hand kindness is an
[24:40] attribute of Mercy you don't want to you
[24:42] don't want to Heap heat more coals on
[24:45] his head and tell him look at this
[24:47] situation you're worthless you're just a
[24:50] you're just a pile of trash you're
[24:53] nothing nobody cares about you nobody
[24:56] this and that see this is what sometimes
[24:58] I I'm saying this for a reason sometimes
[25:00] we'll think we we'll lean so much to
[25:03] kindness is a desire for honesty and
[25:05] truth that we're a little bit too harsh
[25:07] with our truthfulness but kind you got
[25:10] to mix those two things together
[25:12] kindness is an attribute of Mercy
[25:15] sometimes sometimes kindness we we need
[25:17] to be patient and wait and let's not
[25:19] let's not be so quick
[25:21] to to tear somebody up because we we
[25:25] kindness is going to be merciful but
[25:27] kindness also is a desire for honesty
[25:31] and truth if you're not truthful with
[25:33] this beggar and tell him look you're in
[25:35] this situation because you got a problem
[25:36] with alcohol or drugs and I I I listen
[25:40] if you'll listen to me I I've got a
[25:42] remedy for your for your fix and I can
[25:44] help you out of your maybe you know you
[25:47] see some of these people on YouTube that
[25:48] make their videos of being kind and
[25:50] they'll go out and they they'll put a
[25:51] beggar and and uh take him to a hotel
[25:54] and put them up and those kind of things
[25:55] and and you know that's you see you got
[25:58] to have a mix of of mercy and a desire
[26:03] for honesty and truth and that's why
[26:06] it's so difficult to really articulate
[26:09] what love is and what kindness is
[26:13] because there's got to be a balance a
[26:15] balance between those two sides of the
[26:18] coin to be merciful you know
[26:22] um well let's just keep reading John
[26:26] Chapter 13 and we'll we'll stop on this
[26:28] Paul said or or John said or Jesus said
[26:31] who who is this talking Jesus a new
[26:33] commandment I give unto you that you
[26:35] love one another as I have loved you
[26:38] that you also love one another by this
[26:40] shall all men know that you are my
[26:42] disciples amen if ye have love one to
[26:45] another and love on display we'll stop
[26:49] right there is when somebody treats you
[26:51] wrong you can Rec return it return evil
[26:55] with good give good back to evil and
[26:59] we're as we study these things out we're
[27:01] talking about oh the the point I'm going
[27:03] to get to always speak something
[27:05] positive always be positive because the
[27:08] right response respon the right display
[27:12] of love and kindness is what's what's
[27:15] going to get that beggar out of his
[27:17] situation is is not telling him how
[27:19] worthly worthless he is or telling him
[27:22] how nobody cares but telling him
[27:24] something that'll get him out of his fix
[27:27] and that's
[27:28] that's the essence of love and
[27:30] kindness we'll stop right there God
[27:32] bless
[27:34] you
[27:36] [Applause]
[27:40] amen
