[8:26] 1 1 through3
[8:32] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[8:34] gave unto him show unto his servants
[8:36] things which must shortly come to pass
[8:39] and he said and signified it by his
[8:40] Angel unto his servant John who bear
[8:43] record of the word of God and of the
[8:45] testimony of Jesus Christ of all things
[8:47] that he saw blessed is he that readeth
[8:50] and they that hear the words of this
[8:52] prophecy and keep those things which are
[8:55] written therein for the time is at
[9:00] hand all right now 1 Peter
[9:03] 1 beginning with verse 9 receiving the
[9:06] end of your faith even the salvation of
[9:09] your souls of which salvation the
[9:11] prophets have inquired and searched
[9:14] diligently who prophesied of the grace
[9:16] that should come unto you now what about
[9:18] all of those Old Testament prophets they
[9:21] were not speaking of themselves and
[9:22] things they were speaking about us and
[9:25] what would come to pass see verse 11
[9:27] search searching water what manner of
[9:30] time the spirit of Christ which was in
[9:32] them did signify when it testified
[9:35] beforehand the sufferings of Christ see
[9:37] it was speaking of all the things and
[9:39] the glory that should follow unto whom
[9:42] it was revealed it was made known to
[9:44] them that it wasn't for them but unto
[9:47] whom it was revealed that not unto
[9:50] themselves but unto us they did Minister
[9:52] the things which are now reported among
[9:55] you by them that have preached the holy
[9:58] the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost
[10:01] sent down from heaven which things the
[10:03] Angels desire to look into so what are
[10:07] we to do now wherefore G up the loins of
[10:09] your mind be sober and hope to the end
[10:12] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[10:14] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[10:18] you may be seated the Lord at his
[10:21] Blessing to the reading of the
[10:24] word now
[10:26] we're in the Book of Revelations trying
[10:29] to uh do a study on these things and
[10:32] we're coming up in and just now
[10:34] beginning to uh get to the point that we
[10:37] started on uh back about 2 months ago as
[10:41] to trying to speak about and getting
[10:44] into the revelations chap 5 and the
[10:48] things that was there in the Bible and I
[10:51] hope it's been helpful to you to
[10:54] studying these things and to see what
[10:56] all of these symbols mean because thank
[10:59] God for the sending of the Prophet to
[11:02] where that we could understand the
[11:03] symbol see we questioned this we
[11:05] questioned that but then when God sent
[11:07] us a prophet and told us what these
[11:09] things mean this and then it was so
[11:11] simple until we were stumbling over it
[11:15] looking for some kind of a monster you
[11:18] know or something to come stumbling
[11:19] around and doing all over the Earth and
[11:22] and all I that I never didn't understand
[11:24] how that was going to deceive anybody I
[11:26] could understand how it could step on
[11:27] somebody but not deceive you you know
[11:29] cuz it's not it wouldn't that wouldn't
[11:31] be a religious matter it it needs to be
[11:34] something closer at hand but now what
[11:37] we've been trying to talk about is we're
[11:39] we're actually studying on the
[11:42] revelation of Jesus Christ that's why
[11:44] we've read this in Revelations 1 forever
[11:47] service so far because the entire Bible
[11:51] as we were talking about uh this past
[11:54] Sunday especially the afternoon service
[11:58] trying to get to to a point to see but
[12:00] the entire Bible is the revelation of
[12:02] Jesus Christ because it was to real
[12:06] reveal God made manifest on Earth living
[12:11] with you and I and that would fulfill
[12:14] then Emmanuel that the scripture said
[12:17] you know which means god with us so
[12:20] while he was here on Earth almighty God
[12:22] came down to pay the price now I want
[12:26] you to watch tonight and I'm going to
[12:29] say it and then if I have time I'll get
[12:31] back to it but don't I pick it up
[12:34] Sunday but if you'll
[12:37] notice the the
[12:40] uh in when we're reading in a
[12:43] minute that it's talks of you know um a
[12:49] man to be worthy to take the
[12:51] book well then we know that it said you
[12:54] know we not John because the line of the
[12:57] tribe of Judah we know all about where
[12:59] Jesus came from and we'll get to that in
[13:01] a minute but notice it was calling for a
[13:06] man to come forth and and John
[13:09] saw well you know the Elder was talking
[13:12] about a line well then once that symbol
[13:15] is broken then you can understand that
[13:17] it was the line of the tribe of Judah
[13:19] and that's where the lineage Earthly
[13:21] speaking of where that would come down
[13:23] to Jesus you know and and doing that but
[13:28] what I want you to think about
[13:30] is
[13:34] is what form are you dealing with on
[13:38] Redemption
[13:40] U
[13:42] because we know that 2,000 years
[13:46] ago on earth a man died for our
[13:50] sins and we know he was the kinsman
[13:52] redeemer etc etc you know he paid the
[13:56] price and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:58] kep came on the the the day of Pentecost
[14:02] there all right the new birth into the
[14:04] hearts of the
[14:05] Saints but had you never thought about
[14:08] that why would then would you have to
[14:10] have it written out like you do to come
[14:14] to the Book of Revelations and speaking
[14:17] of that no one was worthy to take the
[14:21] book and to loose the seals
[14:25] thereof well it sounds like that you
[14:29] know if you just read that without
[14:31] comprehension of the end time and the
[14:34] way we understand then you know maybe
[14:37] your mind I know it doesn't work like
[14:39] mine I'm glad it don't but still that's
[14:41] just the way I think but uh because it'd
[14:45] be Mass confusion if we all thought
[14:47] alike especially like me but the point
[14:51] I'm trying to get is that why would you
[14:54] have the Book of Revelations talking
[14:55] about needing a
[14:57] Kinsman
[15:02] I'm letting that Coast a little
[15:05] bit what is the purpose what is the
[15:09] concept or thought or idea of coming
[15:12] over into the Book of Revelations in 2
[15:14] years after almost the uh birth of the
[15:19] church uh the coming of the day of
[15:21] Pentecost of the new birth Into the
[15:23] Heart of
[15:25] mankind and then John is weak
[15:30] Because unless a lamb can come forth and
[15:33] take the
[15:35] book All Is Lost
[15:41] right I pause I want you to think about
[15:44] that I like to get you to think I I like
[15:46] to get people to think I like you think
[15:48] about what I'm saying you know think or
[15:49] think every how you use them words I'm
[15:51] just I don't have the education to keep
[15:53] up with you do that
[15:55] part
[15:57] but what why would you have to have a
[16:02] redeemer what is the purpose or the idea
[16:05] or the thought maybe there's more into
[16:07] this than we're trying to
[16:12] comprehend because we know for sure
[16:15] Jesus Christ
[16:19] died the writer said he
[16:22] died you know those personal Witnesses
[16:26] said he died they said he rose they said
[16:29] he came back they said he was our
[16:31] kinsman redeemer they said he was our
[16:34] our Advocate our high
[16:38] priest you know I'm quoting the
[16:40] scriptures of Paul and Peter and them
[16:43] you
[16:43] know but why would you need a Kinsman to
[16:46] come forth in the Book of
[16:53] Revelations I won't try to attempt to
[16:55] express any thought on that other than
[16:57] just that thought
[16:59] I leave that with you to think about a
[17:01] while because it may be very interesting
[17:04] when we get on down a little further all
[17:06] right but
[17:09] now we've been studying about the as we
[17:13] read there in
[17:15] Revelations uh 51 you know about
[17:19] the the one sitting on the
[17:22] throne and we know that that's a
[17:24] fulfillment of the fourth chapter
[17:27] because John was taken up to and saw the
[17:29] throne and one sitting on the throne 24
[17:31] Elders the the different things and then
[17:34] we came over into the fifth chapter and
[17:37] we say that it's a scene it's not a
[17:39] verse by verse more it's a scene it's
[17:42] opening you're beginning to see a
[17:43] picture if you understand um you know
[17:48] God help me to break it
[17:50] down that see chapter 4 is a verse by
[17:54] verse
[17:56] expression of this this this is this but
[17:59] when you come to the fifth
[18:01] chapter it is more or less opening up a
[18:05] scene you're beginning to see in in in
[18:10] Your Vision or
[18:12] thoughts the things that the fourth
[18:15] chapter was speaking of and that's what
[18:17] I've been trying to get you to to line
[18:19] up with maybe I could find words tonight
[18:21] to express those thoughts that you know
[18:25] one is a verse by
[18:26] verse the like I told told you even
[18:29] Paul's writings Peter's writings uh they
[18:32] were writing off something or writing
[18:34] off someone which was the Lord Jesus
[18:37] Christ and then they would speak about
[18:40] him being in US Christ in you to hope of
[18:42] glory but when you coming to the
[18:44] emphasis of the Book of Revelations
[18:46] you're dealing with more dealing into
[18:50] seeing the bride of
[18:51] Christ all right now read chapter 5 with
[18:54] that in mind to where that you can see
[18:57] yourself sitting there and you'll see
[19:00] it's more of a scene then because it uh
[19:03] in other words the the writing of the
[19:07] book is like you would take what you
[19:10] call it script is that the word they use
[19:12] for at script where they they a guy
[19:15] writes a a story you know all right then
[19:17] they make it into a movie and they they
[19:20] bring that down and they give you all of
[19:21] the scripts and the things you know well
[19:24] that's the things you're to read and to
[19:26] see and that's what John was trying to
[19:28] to get us to see through chapter 4 but
[19:30] now in chapter 5 it's entering a scene
[19:35] of
[19:36] reality something is actually taking
[19:39] place in reality all right and it's
[19:42] taking place right here because we're
[19:45] not up there and that's what I was
[19:47] trying to do there Sunday uh wait he and
[19:50] I were talking last night he said Daddy
[19:52] I think you better have questions and
[19:53] answers I said well we we'll have it
[19:57] quick as we can you know and just to see
[19:59] what's on your mind to let's find out
[20:02] what you're thinking I'm doing the best
[20:04] I can to try to bring it down to to the
[20:07] point of revealing you know I can't
[20:10] reveal it because it takes God to do it
[20:13] but we went through the things and we're
[20:15] having to take a verse by verse but what
[20:17] we're doing now is not taking the verse
[20:19] by verse to describe Jesus Christ as
[20:22] much as we're taking a scene of where
[20:26] he's at and what he's doing right and
[20:29] see now we see him more coming related
[20:31] toward the
[20:33] church because you've got the one
[20:36] sitting on the throne same as chapter 4
[20:39] amen all right but now see in chapter 4
[20:44] you didn't see necessarily unless you
[20:47] talk about us being the throne and and
[20:49] the things like that which I tried to
[20:51] emphasize but now you see that our
[20:54] Sunday we picked it up that he there was
[20:56] a book in his right hand
[20:59] all right now we know right hand means
[21:00] power and authority it's not somebody
[21:02] sitting over here on the right hand you
[21:04] know cuz that wouldn't even be sensible
[21:08] but it means right hand and Authority
[21:10] because the Bible says we're saved by
[21:12] his right hand you know by his power his
[21:15] authority all right now then we covered
[21:18] how that that Authority is transmitted
[21:20] into you and I cuz he gave the disciples
[21:24] while he was here in Mark 6 verse 7 he
[21:27] gave them power over unclean spirits
[21:30] right and things like that well then we
[21:33] read we didn't have time to express it
[21:35] but we read then or talked on in
[21:39] Revelations 2 and verse 26 to the
[21:43] Overcomer that he have power over all
[21:45] the nations well see that's a promise to
[21:49] the church ages that was a promise to
[21:51] them he gave them
[21:54] power right he gave them power over
[21:57] unclean spirit they could go out cast
[21:58] out Devils heal the sick all kind of
[22:01] things
[22:02] right all right but then when it comes
[22:05] to the church ages see he comes back and
[22:07] restates
[22:09] it to the
[22:11] Overcomer and remember every Overcomer
[22:14] received all of the everything of all of
[22:16] the Overcomers all and he States it
[22:19] there that he would give power over the
[22:21] Nations even you know not only just
[22:25] unclean spirits and things but see
[22:27] knowing that it would have to have the
[22:29] end time would be a whole lot worse than
[22:33] uh natural
[22:34] sicknesses we would come down here in
[22:36] the end time until you would be you
[22:38] would be your spiritual condition
[22:40] feeling with your mind mind of what
[22:42] you're doing
[22:44] all but then to see
[22:49] it we're looking at a
[22:52] scene so we've spent quite a while
[22:55] talking about the right hand you know
[22:57] the the the power and
[23:00] authority and uh we talked about the
[23:03] book that was in the hand of the one
[23:05] sitting on the Drone and tried to show
[23:08] that that was not a book like this
[23:10] because back when that was written in 8
[23:13] 9596 they didn't have books like this
[23:16] they had
[23:17] Scrolls all right we went through the
[23:19] unrolling of the scroll and and the
[23:21] seeing and how you could do that with
[23:23] the you know and have a tab sticking out
[23:25] and that tab would be sticking out and
[23:27] it would say Luke or Matthew or Mark or
[23:30] Isaiah or whatever and then they could
[23:32] just reach and get those Scrolls and
[23:34] they could read it all right but then we
[23:37] tried to make it then bringing it from
[23:40] uh because if you were listening and
[23:42] that's what I'm trying to
[23:43] describe you see those were the scripts
[23:46] those were the writers of the
[23:51] play you know a man writes a
[23:53] book all right and then they put it into
[23:56] a movie
[23:58] all right and a lot of times it's a a
[24:00] book about your your natural you know
[24:02] people's lives you know I mean they put
[24:05] the whole life story into a book form
[24:08] all right but see if you're really doing
[24:11] it I wouldn't want nobody else playing
[24:14] me in a movie right cuz it wouldn't be
[24:17] me right right if it's ever a movie made
[24:22] that I'm in I want to be I want to be
[24:24] the guy in the movie you know why
[24:27] because I I know about myself right cuz
[24:30] you know how they do they they take
[24:32] those things and beef them up and try to
[24:34] make them a whole lot more uh
[24:36] illustrious or what you call it to the
[24:38] eye and the Temptations to hold you and
[24:41] stuff like
[24:43] that all right but the writing of the
[24:46] book I told you then and we covered how
[24:50] that there were only names written in
[24:53] the
[24:54] book that it's speaking of in
[24:56] Revelations
[24:58] only names written in that
[25:01] book because those were the names of the
[25:05] people of
[25:06] God
[25:09] all but then we come to the
[25:13] Earth and we see while these names are
[25:16] being here looking down at Peter
[25:19] see now it writes a story on Earth about
[25:23] what's taking place while Peter is on
[25:25] Earth or Paul or Moses or Jeremiah
[25:29] Ezekiel or whatever and then it was
[25:31] brought down to what we call the
[25:33] Bible see then the Bible is the not only
[25:37] the loue Book of
[25:39] Life bringing the names into being the
[25:43] Bible is also the book of life right
[25:46] which means it covers life right it
[25:49] covers what happened in the days of
[25:51] Moses while Moses was here now had it
[25:55] not been a time of a fall
[25:59] you remember if we get time we'll go
[26:01] back and read these a minute I gave them
[26:03] to
[26:04] you you know back in the time of the of
[26:07] the fall of mankind you know if there
[26:10] hadn't been a
[26:12] fall there wouldn't have been anybody
[26:14] here but the names of those that were
[26:15] the people of God they were written in
[26:18] the in the Lamb's Book of Life before
[26:20] the foundation of the world all
[26:23] right but because of the fall of
[26:26] mankind
[26:28] see then other people came into being
[26:31] upon the Earth to make out the story and
[26:34] to make it right and see when when Adam
[26:38] fell then brother R said the book went
[26:42] back to the one uh you know the original
[26:48] owner all right now the book not the
[26:51] Bible section of the entire Bible
[26:53] because had even been written
[26:55] right but the book of names went back
[26:59] that's right to the hand of the original
[27:02] owner and he said and then we see him
[27:04] now here sitting on the
[27:08] throne with that book in his hand well
[27:11] then it's not just Bible up there you
[27:13] know King James version Thompson chains
[27:15] scoffield wh whatever you want to put
[27:17] them out in thousands of different Bible
[27:20] things and and all like that but it's a
[27:24] book of
[27:26] names you got that was all that' be
[27:28] needed God doesn't need to write down
[27:30] all of our doings he said he put our
[27:32] sins into see of his
[27:34] forgetfulness well I'm glad of
[27:37] that amen but he made a record right the
[27:42] record is this Bible this Bible that
[27:44] we've been through it in the church a
[27:46] series especially where the Prophet
[27:48] covers the and and in The Invisible
[27:50] Union where he covers the uh one book
[27:53] with two sections which is The Book of
[27:56] Life
[27:58] and and Judas had his name written in
[28:00] the book of life right mhm CU his name
[28:03] was in this Bible right but his name was
[28:06] not written in the lamb book of life
[28:09] section cuz that's eternal life and see
[28:12] he rejected eternal life
[28:15] yes but a record was made of him to
[28:19] where when it comes to a time of
[28:22] judgment the book can be pulled but who
[28:26] is going to be the book
[28:29] you know that the ones that that was
[28:31] around Judas at the times will be the
[28:33] ones that will stand forth and condem
[28:35] him they won't have to take the Bible
[28:37] and say well okay we got to read over
[28:39] here in Matthew let's see you're found
[28:41] in you know no it's people that's
[28:47] right the book of life eternal section
[28:51] is a book of
[28:54] names that should have come forth that
[28:57] there in Genesis
[28:59] 1 you
[29:04] know where said let us make man in our
[29:06] image and our
[29:08] likeness right he should have come forth
[29:10] there amen but it wasn't able to come
[29:13] forth because of the fall of
[29:16] mankind all right but when the fall came
[29:20] did that stop the book from coming no it
[29:22] put the book back into the hand of the
[29:24] original where it was in other words he
[29:26] had brought it down
[29:27] to were that Adam and Eve was holding
[29:32] within themselves the ability to bring
[29:36] forth the correct understanding and the
[29:38] correct L lineage of people you agree
[29:40] with
[29:42] that they had within them some of you
[29:45] didn't that's all
[29:46] right they had within them Adam and Eve
[29:49] had within them the ability to bring
[29:51] forth right said even Isaiah them should
[29:55] have come through the wound of Eve
[29:56] that's right
[29:57] see now you can't figure that out cuz
[29:59] ain't no need trying to figure it out
[30:02] well how could this have been and how
[30:03] could that have been just just forget it
[30:06] it didn't happen that
[30:07] way we
[30:09] fa because God know we were going to
[30:13] fall but then he started writing a book
[30:15] about us oh yeah and we call it the
[30:18] Bible Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers
[30:23] Deuteronomy but you know those were
[30:26] people
[30:30] right and the natural life written
[30:32] behind him you know that in the book of
[30:34] what is it Esther um that even the word
[30:38] God's not even in the Book of Esther
[30:39] that's right that's right because Esther
[30:42] is a basically a
[30:45] genealogy of records of the children of
[30:48] Israel and what happened in a time there
[30:51] that they put it in as a record in
[30:53] record point it's not even the word God
[30:55] is not even used there because it's not
[30:58] dealing with that point it's keeping
[31:00] records a lot of this Bible is
[31:03] records right to so we got so and so and
[31:06] so and we got so and so and so and so we
[31:08] got so and so and you can run their
[31:09] lineages all the way back by following
[31:13] what's written in this
[31:14] book and to see who we came
[31:18] from you go back and study in Matthew uh
[31:23] Matthew 1 it gives the lineage coming
[31:27] down through to David and and Judah and
[31:30] on down and comes down to to where that
[31:33] Christ can come into
[31:35] being because it's a
[31:38] record of life oh yeah all right but see
[31:42] within that also is
[31:44] names cuz that's all that's in the book
[31:47] of the Lamb's Book of
[31:49] Life you know the Eternal section is the
[31:53] book of
[31:54] names but see then you'd write Genesis 1
[31:57] all right Genesis 1 everything was
[32:01] fine it was only dealing with that one
[32:04] seed
[32:05] singular right but Genesis
[32:09] 2 man was put in
[32:11] flesh right
[32:13] right all right then by putting us in
[32:16] flesh God knew we'd fall you say well I
[32:19] can't help it they done it well if you
[32:21] and I had been back there we'd have done
[32:23] worse and that's no problems no talking
[32:26] no no arguing over a point if you'd have
[32:29] been back there if I'd have been back
[32:31] there we would have done worse probably
[32:33] than what Adam and Eve
[32:35] done that's just plain
[32:37] language but listen then once it was put
[32:41] in Genesis 2 the natural man the flesh
[32:44] man the capability of falling
[32:47] came and man fell and God started
[32:51] riding a
[32:54] record but you know what he was bringing
[32:56] forth fourth that Genesis 1:26 and 27
[33:02] man it's called in Galatians 3:16 and
[33:06] unto thy seed
[33:07] singular which is Christ
[33:11] amen that's why the the prophet would
[33:13] say if you read the Bible and don't see
[33:16] Christ in every verse he didn't say
[33:20] Jesus because that deals with the human
[33:22] flesh right if you don't see Christ in
[33:26] every verse he said read it again cuz
[33:28] you missed it right see then the entire
[33:31] Bible is the writing about Mankind upon
[33:34] the
[33:37] Earth but the names of those that are
[33:40] the children of
[33:41] God see that was the book in the hand of
[33:44] the one sitting on the
[33:50] throne see then we see him over
[33:52] Revelation 5 with the
[33:55] book all right
[33:57] now he not only just has a book in his
[34:00] hand is what I was trying to get across
[34:02] Sunday
[34:05] see that book that you see we're going
[34:08] to get on over into the chapter a little
[34:10] further to where that were preach in
[34:14] Kings there in chapter
[34:16] 5 but we'll have to deal with some
[34:19] things about why did the book have to be
[34:24] sealed all right looking at it to see
[34:27] what was going on to where that we can
[34:31] understand see then we conclude that it
[34:33] was a book of
[34:35] names all
[34:37] right go ahead and pull up Number
[34:40] Two Brother
[34:44] Anderson I like to give these because a
[34:46] lot of times you think it's my wording
[34:49] and and if my word's right then ain't
[34:51] worried about it anyway you know because
[34:53] it I'd like to hear somebody else's
[34:56] definition of what what happened in the
[34:58] in the beginning and what happened and
[35:00] how the book came about and and how that
[35:02] you can tie it together to see the Book
[35:03] of
[35:04] Revelation and
[35:06] understand because I'm interested in
[35:09] that because that's my name see so what
[35:11] what your Prophet had to say and really
[35:14] it's called The Church age book The
[35:15] sardian Church
[35:17] age page
[35:19] 267 to begin with there is no basis for
[35:22] the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life
[35:25] is not the same as the Book of Life
[35:27] just two sections one book book of life
[35:31] L Book of
[35:33] Life all right
[35:36] now not the same as the Book of Life The
[35:38] Book of Life might be called the Lamb's
[35:40] Book of Life or Christ Book of Life or
[35:46] even thy book and book of the living see
[35:50] that's what the the Bible can be called
[35:52] the loung Book of Life Look only names
[35:54] are written in it
[35:57] and then he gives you the scripture
[35:58] Revelation
[36:02] 138 did everybody that doesn't have
[36:06] their names written in the Lamb's Book
[36:07] of Life Will Worship the Beast or go
[36:10] after the system of organized religion
[36:12] and be parts of that but the true bride
[36:15] will be searching for what she's trying
[36:17] to do see and trying to see if she can
[36:21] find
[36:23] herself see there's only names written
[36:26] then in that Book of Life of the one
[36:28] sitting on the
[36:31] throne but that's you and I that's our
[36:34] names right and our names being there
[36:36] puts us there as well as we're here and
[36:41] you know all right and see it was
[36:44] written before the foundation of the
[36:45] world according to Ephesians
[36:49] 1:4 It Was
[36:51] Written what the lounge Book of Life the
[36:54] eternal life section was written before
[36:56] before the foundation of the world all
[36:59] right then the prophet of God said it
[37:01] was all planned
[37:05] out it was all planned out you see the
[37:09] book actually was planned and written
[37:10] before the foundation of the world this
[37:13] book The Bible was really written pull
[37:15] that one up because lot of times you
[37:17] think that I'm saying book and Bible and
[37:18] things let's just let him say it first
[37:21] SE 1963 318 paragraph 33 33 you see the
[37:26] book Act was planted and written before
[37:27] the foundation of the world this book
[37:29] The Bible was really written before the
[37:31] foundation of the world and Christ being
[37:33] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[37:35] of the world and the members of his
[37:37] bride their names were put in the Lamb's
[37:38] Book of Life before the foundation of
[37:40] the world but it's been sealed
[37:43] up now we got to get to something on
[37:45] that all right and now it's being
[37:48] revealed whose names were in there all
[37:51] about it
[37:52] amen I don't mind go ahead and telling
[37:55] you
[37:57] so I write this
[37:59] down your name is sealed in the book
[38:03] that's right we'll quote in just a
[38:05] minute the next one the book is sealed
[38:07] and you're sealed with the
[38:10] book so it's revealing your name you're
[38:13] trying to reveal the Antichrist
[38:15] everybody is about to break into the
[38:22] seals now that goes all the way back
[38:24] 1982 and 83 right brother Gary
[38:28] that I wouldn't trying back then to
[38:29] reveal the
[38:33] Antichrist it was reveal Jesus Christ
[38:36] amen the literal seal itself the man of
[38:39] sin sitting in the temple of God showing
[38:40] himself to be as God will be naturally
[38:42] to
[38:44] Israel the fourth seal is the Armageddon
[38:47] that's in Israel fifth seal is fifth
[38:49] seal Jew six seals tribulation
[38:54] period the literal happening under the
[38:56] sealed
[38:57] is to
[39:01] Israel but see we're sealed in the book
[39:03] is sealed why is it
[39:06] sealed now look what he's calling
[39:12] it it's been sealed and now it's been
[39:15] now it's being revealed whose names were
[39:18] in there all about it what a great thing
[39:21] and John when he saw it he said
[39:23] everything in heaven everything under
[39:24] the Earth everything heard him saying
[39:26] amen and blessings and honor he just
[39:28] really was having a great time for the
[39:31] lamb was
[39:33] worthy now think about
[39:40] it the book's been sealed
[39:45] up drop over to number five
[39:50] brother I get them going back there and
[39:52] I give them numbers to follow by so they
[39:54] can they can uh lower it down just a
[40:01] high
[40:03] paragraph no that's not it paragraph
[40:06] 75 number
[40:08] five run it up to that one you're still
[40:11] on four there you
[40:13] go this is after this is the message the
[40:15] prophet called the breach you know look
[40:18] now notice now this book is
[40:20] sealed and you are sealed with the
[40:25] book what greater thoughts could be
[40:27] brought than
[40:30] that that the book is sealed and we're
[40:33] sealed with the
[40:35] book until the day of
[40:38] redemption that's why I ask you a simple
[40:41] question Sunday
[40:45] afternoon morning one of the two there
[40:48] do you believe redemption's
[40:51] over cu the lamb can't leave the mercy
[40:54] seat right until Redemption is
[41:00] over but the prophet in he's preaching
[41:03] in 63 and that's why everybody thought
[41:04] it it sound just like the lamb left to
[41:06] Mercy Seat in
[41:08] 63 well if it did they been nobody saved
[41:11] since
[41:13] then it's like I said Sunday that lead
[41:15] biggest portion of us out wouldn't
[41:19] it but you see the lamb can't leave The
[41:22] Mercy
[41:24] Seat I don't care how many quotes you
[41:28] got of the Lamb leaving The Mercy Seat
[41:30] be careful the way you're using them
[41:32] because you got to remember the lamb
[41:34] can't leave The Mercy Seat until
[41:35] redemption's over that's
[41:39] right that's why he stays there as a
[41:42] lamb not a
[41:48] lion the lamb is the only one that can
[41:50] take the book The Lion can't take the
[41:52] book right right the lamb is the only
[41:56] one that can take the
[41:58] book because the Redemption is not over
[42:01] until the lamb takes the book and pulls
[42:04] the seal off of
[42:06] it it can't be done see so the book is
[42:10] sealed and you're sealed with the book
[42:12] all right it was actually planned and
[42:14] written before the foundation of the
[42:15] world only names written in the book but
[42:19] it's been sealed
[42:22] up it's been sealed up until the end
[42:24] time what
[42:28] about our names being there you said
[42:31] well they preached about this preached
[42:33] about that yes they have but that's you
[42:35] know you've heard everything in the
[42:36] world on predestination and for
[42:39] knowledges and all like that but see in
[42:43] the end
[42:45] time the book is to be
[42:48] revealed right and you know what most
[42:50] people wants to find
[42:52] is they like to read theirself in here
[42:57] and they like to read it like a love
[42:59] story novel or
[43:01] something because it's not spicy enough
[43:05] to just read their
[43:07] name so they want to read it and spice
[43:09] it up to make it a
[43:13] story why are we always trying to find
[43:16] out what God's got against us instead of
[43:20] trying to find out how much God thinks
[43:22] of
[43:25] us am I right yes we rethinking about
[43:30] what we've done
[43:35] wrong isn't that most of our point we we
[43:38] read about what we've done wrong well I
[43:39] was reading there the other day and I
[43:41] seen how wrong I
[43:42] was that's good that's all right that
[43:45] needs to be done that's
[43:47] wonderful but how about reading
[43:49] sometimes to find out what God thinks
[43:50] about you that's right amen that's
[43:55] it
[43:58] well don't you think we ought to repent
[43:59] of for
[44:00] sins
[44:02] yeah but we don't we not his children
[44:05] that's
[44:07] right you're standing in a day and a
[44:10] time now when the children are proven
[44:12] that they don't believe their mother and
[44:13] daddy is their mother and Daddy because
[44:16] they're willing to face them slap them
[44:17] knock them down kill them
[44:22] mhm they don't want them to rule over
[44:24] them right we was raised up in a time
[44:27] when we honored our fathers and our
[44:30] mothers we cherished them for bringing
[44:33] us into the world now the children you
[44:35] brought me into the world you got to
[44:36] take care of
[44:39] me right I mean am I going
[44:44] wrong
[44:46] no but it shows that we're not in
[44:48] wanting to find out who we
[44:51] are we're only wanting to find out if
[44:53] the Bible tells we've done this we done
[44:56] done that we done this we got rid of
[44:57] this we got this you know like I told
[44:58] you the man said said I read them seals
[45:01] I found myself as that white horse rider
[45:03] he said then I become the red horse
[45:05] rider then I become the black horse
[45:06] rider then I become the Pale Horse I
[45:09] said yep youve lost the whole time
[45:10] because every bit of that Theon Beast no
[45:13] redeemable there you can't redeem them
[45:16] beasts like that the
[45:18] Theon that's
[45:20] right is only the zoom Beast can be
[45:24] redeemed would be your for combat Beast
[45:26] that we speak of and we went to Ezekiel
[45:28] and things with it but are you
[45:31] listening see then there's only names in
[45:34] the
[45:36] book and that was the book that went
[45:40] back your record is not been made of
[45:42] your
[45:43] life the record of the children of
[45:45] Israel the record of the sin of
[45:48] mankind and all of that was not made
[45:51] until after the fall that's
[45:54] right
[45:56] then God started keeping the
[45:59] record writing down about what we
[46:03] done and if you'll notice see Moses is
[46:06] Welling over but he's the one that
[46:08] writes
[46:09] Genesis but TimeWise he's over quite a
[46:13] while in the
[46:14] Bible before I didn't look it up to
[46:17] actually tell you but he's on over a
[46:18] pretty good piece in the Bible before he
[46:20] even writes what God said about what had
[46:23] happened in Genesis right right mhm you
[46:26] you understand what I mean by that the
[46:29] fall had come man had come down and
[46:31] great things had happen floods had
[46:33] happen all kind of things that taken
[46:34] place and then Moses appears on the
[46:37] scene then he writes what went on back
[46:39] there cuz that's what took him God took
[46:41] him up on the mountain and showed
[46:43] him how to write this
[46:47] book how to bring down a record and how
[46:50] to do the
[46:51] things that's why your Prophet was so
[46:53] wonderful when I seen what he was saying
[46:55] we read read The Ten Commandments and it
[46:56] said Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not
[46:58] steal Thou shalt not commit adultery and
[47:00] we think that's a book of
[47:06] rules but if you'll think of it in a
[47:08] different
[47:10] way Brother Gary was talking about it
[47:12] years ago you know the few times he did
[47:15] try to preach quit he at least had
[47:17] enough sense to
[47:19] quit but if you read it different see
[47:23] instead of Thou shalt not kill if you
[47:25] read it Thou shalt not
[47:27] kill Thou shalt not
[47:29] steal if you're truth honest in heart
[47:32] you won't steal you won't
[47:34] kill then brother random comes
[47:37] along and he said they didn't get what
[47:40] they thought they got when they got the
[47:43] Ten Commandments that's right they
[47:45] wanted to book of rules to tell them how
[47:47] good they were and what to
[47:49] do they got a revelation of Jesus
[47:53] Christ written in the seals
[47:57] The Ten
[47:58] Commandments Prophet we call the Ten
[48:00] Commandments to see if would have any
[48:02] trouble with it why because it's the
[48:03] entire Bible what is sealed up what has
[48:07] been sealed
[48:09] up now listen to what I'm talking about
[48:12] you get it what Moses
[48:16] done was written in this book
[48:19] right now was that sealed
[48:23] up no it's written right
[48:28] you see if
[48:29] Abraham
[48:32] lied all kind of things about it gave
[48:36] his wife away two times right
[48:46] right that's not
[48:50] sealed anybody with
[48:53] a third grade education or what
[48:56] whatever can read the
[48:59] Bible the words off the page true
[49:04] right so what is
[49:06] sealed you remember we read through
[49:08] Jeremiah that when they were going into
[49:12] bondage when they were to go down into
[49:14] bondage see then they would take and
[49:17] they would take all of those records of
[49:19] who own what
[49:20] property you know this property belongs
[49:22] to this to where they would know when
[49:24] they got back to get everything
[49:27] straight and they would take that and
[49:29] they would bury them in Earthly vessels
[49:32] underground to preserve them right and
[49:35] see then when they came back they could
[49:37] say well you own this and you own this
[49:40] and you own this well because they had
[49:42] the Deeds that would be what you call an
[49:44] abstract title
[49:47] deed and in doing that there was a
[49:49] record
[49:50] made about those things sealed up in an
[49:53] Earthly vessel right
[49:57] see Jesus Christ was that Earthly vessel
[49:59] that God was sealed up in that's right
[50:03] amen you remember that
[50:08] Sunday he didn't think about it
[50:14] church we can read what Moses
[50:18] done we can read what Ezekiel done
[50:21] Jeremiah
[50:23] done but there was a
[50:26] mystery that was sealed
[50:29] up all of that
[50:33] time and not even to be made known even
[50:35] to the disciples in its
[50:40] fullness but to be made known in the end
[50:47] time see if you took out all of the
[50:50] things that's written about what we've
[50:52] done and
[50:54] do you wouldn't have but just a book of
[51:01] names and that would be the children of
[51:07] God but you see it has to write that
[51:09] what happened to us like Paul would say
[51:12] you know he would talk about the the
[51:14] world and the things and he would say
[51:16] and such were some of you
[51:19] right think that's the record kept in
[51:21] the book but said now you're clean right
[51:27] why because then we can see Jesus Christ
[51:29] came on the
[51:32] scene and took away our sins
[51:37] amen and then he would be the
[51:39] Fulfillment
[51:41] of of the Book of Ruth read it sometime
[51:44] we get a
[51:47] chance of Naomi and Ruth and and
[51:52] all Naomi was a Jew and she went down
[51:56] she left the land and went away trying
[51:58] to make a living her husband died her
[52:00] sons died and you
[52:03] know they start back home and Ruth goes
[52:06] with
[52:09] her well when it got back to there the
[52:11] kinsman redeemer had a right to
[52:16] redeem right read the book of Ruth
[52:18] sometimes and just think about
[52:20] it in right to the kinsman redeemer had
[52:23] to be somebody kin folk and the also had
[52:25] to be
[52:30] capable there were certain things went
[52:32] with it it wouldn't just a fact you can
[52:33] say well let old sorry SLO no you had to
[52:36] be capable of being able to to be your
[52:41] Kinsman if you remember the story to
[52:44] show you how we were lost and in the
[52:45] world of sin you remember the story in
[52:47] the Book of
[52:49] Ruth that
[52:51] Naomi you know Boaz wouldn't wouldn't
[52:54] too interesting get Naomi right she was
[52:57] an old woman and done P his childbearing
[53:01] so he wasn't going to have to do no work
[53:03] of brothers or whatever it would be and
[53:05] he didn't have to be concerned with none
[53:07] of those things to carry on a
[53:12] lineage he wanted
[53:16] Ruth and Ruth was a
[53:20] gentile but there that stuned you he
[53:22] wanted to he wanted that beautiful Ruth
[53:26] for his
[53:29] wife but remember Boaz told
[53:34] Naomi
[53:35] Ruth there's one closer to
[53:38] Ken we've got to give him the first
[53:42] opportunity and if he buys Naomi Ruth
[53:45] goes with
[53:50] it so Boaz had to do the Kinsman work he
[53:53] had to wait on the man you had to give
[53:55] him an
[53:58] opportunity he told him he said redeem
[54:01] your
[54:02] right of Naomi and her
[54:06] inheritance the man says read the book
[54:08] of there he said I will
[54:12] redeem Bo said but there's one thing
[54:14] that you got to
[54:18] do if you take Naomi and her property
[54:21] you got to take
[54:24] Ruth
[54:27] and bear up
[54:30] children
[54:31] right
[54:34] right so the man was a good sta Jew in
[54:36] the
[54:37] natural so he didn't want to infiltrate
[54:40] his lineage with a
[54:42] gentile so he told Boaz he said I refuse
[54:46] the right to redeem the homie you do it
[54:50] that's right he boy has knew what he's
[54:52] doing and the only way he could get him
[54:54] to ever turn that down because he done
[54:56] said I'll take
[54:59] it that's right now you know what that
[55:02] is we come here K folks to the devil
[55:06] that's right whether you like it or
[55:09] not the devil is the one we came kin
[55:12] folks to because of the
[55:16] fall but see he couldn't redeem
[55:19] us cuz he was the
[55:22] devil but Jesus Christ came to pay the
[55:24] price that's
[55:26] right and he became our kinsman redeemer
[55:29] by becoming human flesh God himself had
[55:32] to come down not send a son we don't
[55:34] believe in trinitarian doctrines tonight
[55:36] we believe in one true and living Goden
[55:39] see would you send one of your children
[55:40] to die or would you go yourself right
[55:44] other words somebody said we're going to
[55:45] kill somebody you said well okay son I'm
[55:47] sorry you got to go you no no if we're
[55:50] any father at all we go oursel right
[55:52] that's right and see God didn't send
[55:55] send a son down that's what we think
[55:56] about in the trinitarian God sent his
[55:58] son we don't believe in that we don't
[55:59] believe in Eternal
[56:00] sunship right we believe in Eternal God
[56:03] Amen so God came himself down in human
[56:06] flesh yes sir in other words he took
[56:08] human
[56:09] flesh that soul and that Spirit within
[56:12] that body was almighty God but that body
[56:15] was a human element that Hebrews uh 10:5
[56:18] says a body thou H has prepared for
[56:23] me he made a human body and came to
[56:26] Earth and when then that would be would
[56:29] be the kinsman
[56:31] redeemer cuz that would be the only way
[56:33] the price could be
[56:36] paid would be that kinsman redeemer come
[56:38] and stand in our place
[56:42] righten and he paid the
[56:46] price then when he paid the price he
[56:48] raised from the
[56:50] dead sent back on the day of Pentecost
[56:53] to baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Amen
[56:55] to give us an abstract time of
[56:57] deed other words gave us eternal life
[57:00] right in our soul body and spirit we're
[57:03] still human Mortals but the soul of
[57:05] mankind is where the new birth
[57:08] starts he gave us that Abstract title
[57:10] deed but we didn't know how to call it
[57:16] that see we didn't know to call it
[57:18] abstract and things those are words of
[57:20] this day right
[57:22] huh but you see he paid price that's
[57:27] right right amen he redeemed
[57:32] us you believe it amen
[57:36] amen now go back and ask that question
[57:39] again then if he redeemed us why are we
[57:41] in the Book of Revelation trying to find
[57:43] a
[57:52] redeemer are you thinking or you
[57:59] sleep why we got why have we got to come
[58:02] back in this end time to think about a
[58:06] kinsman
[58:09] redeemer when we know who paid the
[58:12] price we know who become kin folks to
[58:23] us
[58:25] now we're looking for a Kinsman to come
[58:27] and take the
[58:29] book because in the book is the whole
[58:31] Plan of
[58:33] Redemption the names all of the names
[58:36] all of the
[58:38] doing listen folks surely don't get in
[58:41] your mind they're out there somewhere
[58:42] listening that I'm talking about some
[58:45] kind of a something that didn't that
[58:46] wasn't worthy enough back
[58:49] there that the price wasn't paid back
[58:52] there it was that's right Jesus Christ
[58:55] paid the
[58:57] price he became our Kinsman we become
[59:00] join ours as I trying to bring out suay
[59:02] the Bible says amen join ours with
[59:08] Christ that's why he said all power in
[59:11] Heaven and Earth is given unto me then
[59:14] he turn around and gives that power to
[59:15] the church that's
[59:19] right in my name you'll cast out
[59:22] Devils you gave the power to the church
[59:27] chur he paid the
[59:29] price he was the
[59:35] Kinsman
[59:39] right but see where the problem was is
[59:42] what I tried to preach to you back about
[59:44] two months
[59:47] ago when a prophet preached a message
[59:49] one day saying raising Jesus from
[59:53] history
[59:55] you know if we're sitting here tonight
[59:56] with a historical God sure he paid the
[1:00:01] price but how do we know he's our
[1:00:08] Kinsman how do we know the price has
[1:00:10] been
[1:00:11] paid well I feel it in my heart we
[1:00:13] listening last night where brother Bram
[1:00:16] was talking about the Muhammad and the
[1:00:18] man talking to the Muhammad and you know
[1:00:20] and saying well uh your Muhammad
[1:00:22] religion is no good why don't you accept
[1:00:24] Jesus Christ and the Muhammad and said
[1:00:26] show me one thing that your Jesus Christ
[1:00:29] can do any more than Muhammad can do for
[1:00:36] me he said Mohammad said said Jesus
[1:00:40] promised us life after death he said
[1:00:42] Muhammad did
[1:00:45] too you remember the story
[1:00:50] right but even the Mohamad turned around
[1:00:53] and said m mammad didn't tell us that
[1:00:55] we' do the things that he done but said
[1:00:59] your god did said now let's see him done
[1:01:01] and I'll accept
[1:01:08] it
[1:01:10] right so do we know about what it is a
[1:01:15] Redemption what would be the problem
[1:01:17] would we look would we be looking for
[1:01:19] another Redeemer to come no that's
[1:01:23] stupidity
[1:01:28] but I asked you a simple question at the
[1:01:30] end of the message Sunday afternoon I
[1:01:32] said will your faith produce a lamb for
[1:01:40] you will your faith produce a lamb for
[1:01:43] you well God's already produced it amen
[1:01:47] but can we depend upon what he's done
[1:01:50] well sure we can we believe in
[1:01:52] him well why don't we live like that's
[1:01:56] right
[1:01:58] right that's
[1:02:05] right but after 2,000
[1:02:11] years John is
[1:02:15] weeping for the Kinsmen to
[1:02:22] come and John was there when the Kinsman
[1:02:25] was here the first
[1:02:28] time right right
[1:02:32] M he ate with him slept with him saw him
[1:02:35] die saw him raised experienced a new
[1:02:38] birth on the day of
[1:02:40] Pentecost to prove that he was that
[1:02:43] God to prove he was the
[1:02:49] Kinsman but then why are you looking for
[1:02:51] a
[1:02:53] kman
[1:02:57] but now we know they
[1:03:02] were we know All Is Lost Without that
[1:03:05] Kinsman coming
[1:03:11] right see then if we can't see the
[1:03:14] Throne of Revelation 4 and the one
[1:03:16] sitting on the throne and see what that
[1:03:19] means see that it means in your heart in
[1:03:22] your life is God sitting on the Throne
[1:03:24] of your life that's right ruing land in
[1:03:27] your heart that's right
[1:03:31] amen if we can't see
[1:03:33] that we're crying for a
[1:03:42] redeemer why after all that the prophet
[1:03:45] has
[1:03:47] said all that we spent of the 40
[1:03:49] something years of studying the
[1:03:53] message
[1:03:55] why is it that most people still looking
[1:03:56] for a
[1:04:00] redeemer looking for somebody that can
[1:04:03] come
[1:04:06] and take us out of
[1:04:09] here then they got all kind of doctrines
[1:04:12] that run out from that right trying to
[1:04:14] find a
[1:04:18] Kinsman you got the people believing in
[1:04:20] certain people being
[1:04:22] God because they believ they were the
[1:04:25] ones to come and take over after the
[1:04:27] prophet
[1:04:30] left why is the people of this message
[1:04:33] still looking for a
[1:04:39] redeemer well brother de what are you
[1:04:40] looking
[1:04:42] for I'm looking for that one to be able
[1:04:44] to fulfill Revelations 4 and climb up on
[1:04:48] the throne in my heart and sat down
[1:04:51] that's right on this Earthly Throne that
[1:04:53] he had has here upon Earth which is a
[1:04:56] very poor
[1:05:00] excuse and only then can I realize a
[1:05:03] scene can open in heaven that I can see
[1:05:06] a
[1:05:09] book and find out that that book has got
[1:05:11] my name in
[1:05:13] it and I preached to you there at Sunday
[1:05:15] it's not Samuel Dale it's not that
[1:05:17] that's not your name in the book right
[1:05:20] that's your Earthly name that Mom and
[1:05:21] Daddy gave you MH see
[1:05:24] that's why Paul had to his name was Saul
[1:05:27] and his name when he got converted had
[1:05:28] to be changed and made him to
[1:05:31] Paul Peter was fine means
[1:05:35] cus but it had to be changed to
[1:05:40] Peter Jacob's name had to be changed to
[1:05:43] Israel you remember that in the
[1:05:45] Bible
[1:05:51] right are you listening
[1:05:56] are we still looking for a Kinsman to
[1:05:58] come or do we know where the Kinsman
[1:06:08] is see if you can see that Kinsman on
[1:06:11] the throne in your heart then you can
[1:06:14] realize Brother Gary that we are that
[1:06:16] book
[1:06:20] right we're not looking for a Kinsman to
[1:06:23] come and take the the book as to pay the
[1:06:27] price now maybe you'll catch on and see
[1:06:31] the Kinsman I'm talking about the end
[1:06:33] time is not the one to pay the
[1:06:37] price Jesus Christ paid the price right
[1:06:44] right he was our Kinsman that paid the
[1:06:46] price
[1:06:50] MH Boaz could pay the price and redeem
[1:06:58] Naomi but that wasn't all the
[1:07:02] story cu the rest of the story was him
[1:07:05] to receive Ruth as a wife and by
[1:07:09] children
[1:07:11] amen and that first child that went back
[1:07:13] to Naomi
[1:07:16] remember to carry her leading of her
[1:07:18] family
[1:07:20] on read the book of
[1:07:22] Ruth
[1:07:25] see Jesus Christ paid the price 2,000
[1:07:27] years
[1:07:29] ago our Kinsman paid the
[1:07:32] price that's right but he hasn't taken
[1:07:36] possession
[1:07:45] yet the price is paid church right
[1:07:52] mhm but can we accept it that's
[1:07:57] right oh yeah we believe he can save us
[1:08:00] you know he he can save us and he can do
[1:08:06] this but do we put it all in him and say
[1:08:09] the price had already
[1:08:11] paid John wouldn't looking for a Kinsman
[1:08:14] like that
[1:08:17] way he was looking for a Kinsman that
[1:08:20] could take the
[1:08:21] book and loose the seal
[1:08:26] not to be able to pay the price of
[1:08:31] Redemption come
[1:08:33] on try that down and think on it a
[1:08:38] little John knew Jesus Christ paid the
[1:08:41] price he' experienced it in his own
[1:08:44] heart man that's
[1:08:50] right he was looking for a lamb or a
[1:08:53] line looking for a man is what his where
[1:08:56] starts out in Revelations 5 we'll get to
[1:08:58] it
[1:08:59] Sunday he was looking for a man to come
[1:09:01] and take the book he knew an animal
[1:09:04] couldn't do it it was no form of talking
[1:09:06] about animal but when the elders said
[1:09:08] the lon of the tribe of
[1:09:11] Judah has
[1:09:17] prevailed he could take the book and
[1:09:19] loose the
[1:09:22] seals
[1:09:24] come on loosen the seals is to take the
[1:09:26] seal off the book it's not the writing
[1:09:28] of the
[1:09:30] book the book is written you and I are
[1:09:33] the right the words that are in the
[1:09:38] book you can read it to be personal just
[1:09:41] like going back there to where it says
[1:09:43] that when the in the end time say when
[1:09:46] the towers
[1:09:47] fall
[1:09:52] right see we seen them fall two our
[1:09:55] Flames took them down didn't
[1:10:02] it they found a scroll in the Bible one
[1:10:06] time and they stood before the water
[1:10:11] gate and read the
[1:10:15] scroll this prophet's message was
[1:10:17] beginning to be preached when you had a
[1:10:20] water
[1:10:22] gate and our day that's right and you
[1:10:25] lost a president on account of
[1:10:31] it see the Bible it tells you right
[1:10:33] where you're
[1:10:37] at because it's a secret mystery within
[1:10:40] the book that we're trying to find not a
[1:10:42] not of what how we're guilty of this
[1:10:44] we're guilty of that we know we're all
[1:10:48] guilty John I don't believe was trying
[1:10:51] to find somebody to pay the price
[1:10:55] he knew the price had been paid amen but
[1:10:59] he needed a revelation to where that
[1:11:01] that something about this book in the
[1:11:03] hand of the one sitting on the throne he
[1:11:05] knew who that was right but he couldn't
[1:11:08] comprehend that
[1:11:14] book he knew that that one on the throne
[1:11:16] was Jesus Christ that's right you
[1:11:19] remember he heard his voice in chapter 4
[1:11:22] it was the same voice that he heard
[1:11:24] while he was on Earth walking with
[1:11:26] him that voice called him
[1:11:29] up chapter
[1:11:33] 4 he knew that throne and the symbols
[1:11:36] and the
[1:11:38] things but he couldn't understand that
[1:11:40] book in the hand of the one sitting on
[1:11:42] the
[1:11:46] throne and why a proclamation would go
[1:11:49] out through heaven for somebody some man
[1:11:52] to be able to come and take the
[1:11:54] book no man was
[1:11:58] worthy brother R said there was no way
[1:12:00] he said Moses was there look at that
[1:12:03] that Elijah was standing there Moses was
[1:12:06] there listen how straight he makes it
[1:12:08] all the apostles were standing there of
[1:12:12] all of the ones that had died look how
[1:12:15] personally he straight how he keeps
[1:12:19] it all the holy men job the sages
[1:12:23] everyone was standing there but nobody
[1:12:24] was worthy even to look at the book let
[1:12:27] alone to take it and break the
[1:12:32] seals see the Plan of Redemption was
[1:12:35] sealed up in Jesus Christ if we don't
[1:12:37] see him
[1:12:41] correctly we may go by the grave yes
[1:12:43] that's
[1:12:44] fine CU that's what mankind is done down
[1:12:47] through
[1:12:50] time because they found no way
[1:12:55] for anybody to be able to take the book
[1:12:57] and loose the
[1:13:05] seals we're not dealing with the paying
[1:13:08] the
[1:13:09] price the price was paid in Jesus Christ
[1:13:13] he is our Kinsman
[1:13:17] amen but to see how that Kinsman can
[1:13:19] come and take you and
[1:13:22] me
[1:13:25] take these old Mortal bodies that we're
[1:13:26] living in and change them
[1:13:30] right make us into like his own glorious
[1:13:41] body salvation as far as the
[1:13:44] understanding of the soul and the new
[1:13:45] birth was made known to the
[1:13:47] disciples written in the writings of
[1:13:50] Christ in you the hope of
[1:13:52] glory
[1:13:56] but they can only prophesy of a future
[1:13:58] event Paul could only say one day you be
[1:14:00] Chang on the twinkle of an eye this
[1:14:03] Mortal put on immortality
[1:14:06] Etc but see they couldn't cover that
[1:14:09] part because it was
[1:14:15] sealed you see what I'm driving
[1:14:21] there the k man Redeemer that you and I
[1:14:25] need in the end time is the one that can
[1:14:27] take the book and loose the sealed off
[1:14:29] and show the Redemption of these bodies
[1:14:31] and souls I mean body and spirit of
[1:14:34] mankind
[1:14:38] amen we know who paid the
[1:14:41] price right we know it was in Jesus
[1:14:44] Christ we preached
[1:14:50] that but we need to see us taken off
[1:14:52] ourselves that's right mhm yes
[1:14:56] sir we read what the prophet said he
[1:14:58] said the book is sealed and you're
[1:14:59] sealed with the
[1:15:02] book you know that we are the Believers
[1:15:05] in the
[1:15:07] book that's what we are is what you say
[1:15:10] well I I can't find myself to read
[1:15:13] Revelations come on how many times have
[1:15:15] I've been over that you can't find
[1:15:18] yourself in the reading of the book
[1:15:19] anywhere just turn over to chapter one
[1:15:21] of the book of of Revelation and start
[1:15:24] reading and you'll never find Jesus
[1:15:26] there by
[1:15:28] himself he's revealing himself to his
[1:15:31] bride or in his
[1:15:33] bride the book of
[1:15:35] redemption has been
[1:15:41] opened see it was planned and written in
[1:15:43] all of the things
[1:15:47] but what about
[1:15:52] it
[1:15:54] as I said about Ruth and Boaz then Boaz
[1:15:57] was a type of Christ he paid the
[1:16:03] price but then he got Ruth paying the
[1:16:07] price Jesus Christ paid our priz 2,000
[1:16:10] years ago I'm not talking about getting
[1:16:12] somebody to climb up on a cross and
[1:16:14] dying
[1:16:16] again I'm pointing back to what happened
[1:16:20] there but yet when he left that part
[1:16:22] there there was something sealed
[1:16:26] up it was sealed up until mankind didn't
[1:16:29] understand
[1:16:30] it here in the end time that's coming
[1:16:34] forth that we can
[1:16:36] see that we're the
[1:16:41] book we're the book in the hand of the
[1:16:43] one sitting on the
[1:16:46] throne now he can
[1:16:48] reveal you and I Christ The Mystery of
[1:16:51] God revealed I thank his PA
[1:16:53] 74 said the bride is part of the
[1:17:00] mystery you know what she's got to be
[1:17:02] revealed amen that's
[1:17:06] right be careful now brother D you make
[1:17:09] too much out of yourself I'm not trying
[1:17:11] to make my too much out of myself I'm
[1:17:13] trying to make something out of
[1:17:14] you I'm not concerned about my end of
[1:17:17] the
[1:17:18] deal I'm concerned with trying to get
[1:17:20] you to see who you areen
[1:17:26] and see that you are The Offspring of
[1:17:32] God and he's taking the the seals off of
[1:17:39] you
[1:17:42] right think on these things come on
[1:17:47] Brothers
[1:17:50] understand kinsman redeemer what are you
[1:17:52] looking for
[1:17:55] I hope you understood my whole point
[1:17:56] I'll say it one more
[1:17:58] time the kinsman redeemer I'm talking
[1:18:01] about is Jesus Christ and he came and
[1:18:03] paid the price 2,000 years ago right but
[1:18:07] he didn't claim the property of all of
[1:18:10] us at that time he didn't claim the
[1:18:13] body he claimed only the soul in
[1:18:16] possession because that's where he went
[1:18:18] on the day of Pentecost was right down
[1:18:20] into the soul of mankind
[1:18:23] now he's here to pay the
[1:18:27] price and the paying of the price is not
[1:18:30] of trying to find another
[1:18:32] Kinsman but to see what he
[1:18:37] done he walked into
[1:18:40] immortality to where no man has
[1:18:42] approached
[1:18:44] unto that's what your Bible says that
[1:18:47] Jesus Christ went to word no man no no
[1:18:49] wonder no no wonder was it when the
[1:18:52] prophet went beyond the curtain of time
[1:18:54] he said I want to see Jesus he said he's
[1:18:56] in a higher Dimension you can't go there
[1:18:59] right he went as far as he could go but
[1:19:02] he couldn't go to the seventh
[1:19:07] Dimension why because the Bible it said
[1:19:09] no man has approached to immortality
[1:19:11] with Jesus Christ immortality is mortal
[1:19:15] flesh made
[1:19:16] Eternal the and when you say Mortal is
[1:19:19] this then when you say immortality it
[1:19:21] means this is made
[1:19:24] Eternal see then that's what we're not
[1:19:26] looking for a new body looking for this
[1:19:28] body to be
[1:19:30] redeemed Jesus Christ stood there after
[1:19:32] his resurrection in the Eternal
[1:19:34] condition and said fill my hands that's
[1:19:36] right
[1:19:38] right you see we've been taught all of
[1:19:40] our life we're going to get a new body
[1:19:42] why is it that we don't believe God can
[1:19:45] redeem this
[1:19:48] one do we think this one is too
[1:19:51] bad
[1:19:55] Resurrection is not replacement I Dro
[1:19:58] this Bible and pick up a book that's not
[1:19:59] it I got to pick the same thing back up
[1:20:02] same thing that went down came up it
[1:20:04] proved it Jesus
[1:20:08] did see then why are we worried about
[1:20:10] anything let's get into the book of
[1:20:13] redemption to see
[1:20:17] ourselves in that book what we got 97 in
[1:20:22] the uh
[1:20:28] R the world will
[1:20:32] try any might have
[1:20:39] a you may Ser the
[1:20:45] world

[1:21:03] on Jesus let believe when they going to
[1:21:05] operate
[1:21:07] operate let just believe that all is

[1:21:17] lord have a little one touch our heart
[1:21:21] just reach down baby let let the doctors
[1:21:24] perform their
[1:21:26] operation we know you can do it without
[1:21:28] even being if you choose that
[1:21:32] way all things
[1:21:35] well believe
[1:21:41] you anybody
[1:21:48] else not looking for another Jesus to
[1:21:51] come
[1:21:53] not looking for another
[1:21:55] Redeemer but to see what he's
[1:21:58] done and see what he's still
[1:22:01] doing all the
[1:22:07] world

[1:22:50] breus you believe
[1:22:56] see the price is
[1:23:00] paid but you ain't claimed it
[1:23:05] yet this is in the end time of where he
[1:23:08] claiming The
[1:23:12] Possession when he gave you that baptism
[1:23:14] of the Holy Ghost he L claim on
[1:23:20] that oh one day this body then is going
[1:23:23] to have to be
