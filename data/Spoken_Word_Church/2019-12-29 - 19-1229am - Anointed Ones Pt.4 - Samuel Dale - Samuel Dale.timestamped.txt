[19:01] destruction so we depend upon that have
[19:03] your way now as we read your word and
[19:05] talk about you we ask you to come on the
[19:07] scene and direct us in Jesus name Amen
[19:11] okay Matthew 24 begin reading at verse
[19:16] 15 we therefore shall see the
[19:22] abomination of desolation spoken of by
[19:25] Daniel the prophet stand in the Holy
[19:27] Place whoso reads let him understand now
[19:30] we're using this to show you what this
[19:33] is this is and then where we're at right
[19:37] so this is the mosque of Omar that was
[19:40] put into the place there of the temple
[19:42] you know alright and when you see that
[19:44] remember and let them understand okay we
[19:49] have to have that then that them which
[19:51] be in Judaea flee into the
[19:54] this is what Jesus told the disciples or
[19:57] the followers to get out because Titus
[20:00] was coming in to destroy Jerusalem and
[20:03] not a true Christian arenium was caught
[20:05] left in the city you know when Titus
[20:08] came in in AD 70 because they all took
[20:11] his word to him which is on the housetop
[20:15] not come down to take anything out of
[20:18] this house neither let him which is in
[20:21] the field return back to take his
[20:24] clothes and woe unto them that are with
[20:27] child and to them that give suck in
[20:30] those days either one have to flee into
[20:32] the Judean Hills which would have been
[20:34] snow by on during that period of time
[20:36] but pray that your flight be not in the
[20:39] winter nor neither on the Sabbath day
[20:41] because he'd be hard to travel it was
[20:43] hard for you to get up and down but then
[20:46] shall be Great Tribulation such as was
[20:48] not since the beginning of the world on
[20:51] to this time no not ever
[20:54] nor ever shall be except those days
[20:57] should be shortened there should no
[20:59] flesh be saved but for the elects sake
[21:02] those days shall be shortened
[21:04] remember how we explained that we'll get
[21:05] back to it in a minute now that God's
[21:07] gonna was going to let it run out but
[21:10] now he decided he'd take off a few days
[21:12] and do it no that's that's not the
[21:15] situation that we're getting to all
[21:17] right then if any man shall say unto you
[21:20] lo here is Christ or dire believe it not
[21:25] for the earth shall arise false Christ's
[21:28] and false prophets now you know how you
[21:31] can translate the word and into the word
[21:33] even so then read it this away brother
[21:37] shall arise false Christ's even false
[21:39] prophets see so you're putting it to
[21:42] where you can give it a little better
[21:43] understanding and she'll show shake
[21:46] great signs and wonders in so much that
[21:49] if it were possible they shall deceive
[21:51] the very elect now we've got to quote in
[21:55] here in a minute where the Prophet said
[21:56] frankly I'd get them tied up they had to
[21:58] cut it short
[21:59] alright behold I have told you before
[22:04] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[22:06] behold he is in
[22:08] the desert now we're coming down to look
[22:10] where we're at go not forth behold he is
[22:13] in the secret chambers believe it not
[22:16] for as the Lightning cometh out of the
[22:19] east and China's even into the west so
[22:23] shall also the coming of the Son of Man
[22:26] be for were so ever the carcass is dar
[22:29] will the eagle's be gathered together
[22:32] amen
[22:33] you may be seated to the Lord at his
[22:35] blessing to the word evening of the word
[22:37] now coming down and bringing it like I
[22:40] said reading the Bible to see the day
[22:43] that we're living and so playing that we
[22:46] can see right dar that Jesus was
[22:47] bringing it all the way down and telling
[22:51] them to get out of Jerusalem because
[22:55] Titus was coming when he told him about
[22:59] the mosque of Omar that that would be
[23:01] put in the place of the temple all right
[23:03] coming on down and then brought it down
[23:05] to our day to work who were that they
[23:07] would be false Christ and he didn't say
[23:11] Christ singular he uses Christ singular
[23:15] in the for one verse in the next is
[23:17] Christ which is plural Christ means The
[23:21] Anointed One right all right see then
[23:26] the Anointed One the that anointing on
[23:30] the people on the profits on their
[23:33] teachings on their doings would be the
[23:37] thing to word that when we're in the end
[23:39] time look at where it's at what's taking
[23:41] place all right bring it right on down
[23:44] to were that we are today of how the
[23:49] so-called believers of the message have
[23:52] done everything they can do to try to
[23:54] destroy the message in its effect in
[23:57] things by bringing forth and proclaiming
[24:00] they have the revelation the why would
[24:05] you move out and do it equate things
[24:06] that people are doing if you ain't gonna
[24:08] claim you got the revelation or what's
[24:10] going home I mean right I mean you have
[24:14] no reason to move if you don't think you
[24:17] got something to move with I don't think
[24:20] you do you're in charge
[24:22] so look at the hour that we're living is
[24:24] right down to the lice to that point of
[24:27] the Christ or false Christ now listen
[24:33] the anointing is Christ there is only
[24:37] one Christ
[24:39] now get this before we move into any
[24:42] part to think about it there's not
[24:44] there's just one Holy Ghost there's one
[24:48] Christ but he can anoint many and they
[24:54] become Christ's anointed ones all right
[24:57] that Christ then doesn't mean that
[25:02] you're right
[25:05] because you can be anointed every day
[25:08] your life as we read the prophets said
[25:10] on your spirit and still be lost all
[25:15] right now that's what we want to go back
[25:17] and pick up some things in a minute and
[25:21] try to bring it out and especially to
[25:23] the ones that haven't heard the services
[25:26] we don't want to leave you behind
[25:28] we've been talking about how that they
[25:31] would be in the last days false Christ's
[25:34] now the Christ is not false if it is
[25:38] Christ there's not a false anointed one
[25:42] you know what I mean there's a people
[25:44] that are false themselves that are
[25:46] anointed all right now Balaam Balaam was
[25:52] anointed baylin's prophesies is in the
[25:56] Bible all right they put it in there
[26:00] okay all right and that's he is the
[26:05] anointing in other words the same Holy
[26:06] Spirit that was on Moses or Elijah or
[26:09] any of the prophets that same Holy
[26:12] Spirit was on Balaam not no different
[26:18] Christ now forget that in your mind now
[26:20] and don't think there's a Christ for
[26:22] this group of people and a Christ for
[26:24] this group of people there's only one
[26:26] Christ only one anointed one that is
[26:31] anointed of God you say well these
[26:33] others are anointed of the devil well
[26:35] you believe what you want to about it
[26:37] but he ain't got too much to anoint with
[26:38] he can do a lot of trouble but I'd
[26:42] rather stay with the truth of following
[26:44] it the way it is that we're in the day
[26:48] when there's many many different ones
[26:51] coming forth in the land to describe and
[26:55] and say that they are the Christ they
[26:59] used to be a group down in Florida
[27:00] they're back a few years ago that that
[27:02] they went for about six months in a row
[27:04] constant revival and they were Baptist
[27:09] constants six months revival you know
[27:13] who they thought they were the spirit of
[27:15] Elijah
[27:16] you remember that that's been about 14
[27:20] years ago something like that it's been
[27:24] what back a good bit they thought they
[27:26] were the spirit of Elijah well see they
[27:29] found somebody found out in the word
[27:31] read it and they got into it and claim
[27:33] it through their own all right but see
[27:35] false Christ the Christ is not false All
[27:41] Right see what Balaam done now remember
[27:45] the way that we've tried to bring it out
[27:47] Balaam Balak tried to get Balaam to
[27:51] curse Israel right all right
[27:54] Balaam said I will go with you but I'll
[28:01] only say what God tells me why because
[28:05] that prophet he was a prophet in Israel
[28:08] counted with the prophets he prophesied
[28:11] like I said it's written in the Bible
[28:13] what he had to say
[28:14] all right then that anointing that his
[28:19] on him there's no difference in that
[28:21] anointing than what was on Moses old
[28:24] Moses was the Christ and who's he over
[28:27] or he's Antichrist well Moses spoke and
[28:32] it was putting the Bible right
[28:35] Balaam spoke is put in the Bible and as
[28:39] far as what they were doing what they
[28:41] were saying was in the Word of God
[28:43] Balaam was speaking it would put into
[28:45] the Bible and just like brother Brown
[28:47] said about koffice the
[28:48] prease remember cough was prophesied it
[28:51] was necessary that one died for the sins
[28:53] of the people see him being High Priest
[28:57] the anointing came on him and he
[29:02] prophesied that and it was a fulfillment
[29:05] of the scriptures but yet he was false
[29:10] yet he turned around and and had Jesus
[29:13] crucified but the anointing that was on
[29:16] him was genuine so don't get confused
[29:19] about that and say well I don't
[29:21] understand this and on this get simply
[29:24] what's taking place there's only one
[29:28] true anointing one Christ all right now
[29:34] then in that there's one Holy Ghost one
[29:39] Spirit of God that can come and dwell on
[29:43] people and anoint them all right see
[29:48] then we get to that and we we consider
[29:51] the hour and the day that we're living
[29:52] to see where we're at
[29:55] about these and like I said you see many
[29:58] now going across the claiming to be The
[30:01] Anointed One oh I've got the message I'm
[30:04] so it shows this brother Branham was
[30:05] wrong here we've got this we've got that
[30:07] we've got he was over here I don't care
[30:09] what yourself I've told you that over no
[30:12] I may be dumb and stupid as can be I
[30:14] don't argue with you about that but this
[30:18] message has brought me to Jesus Christ
[30:22] so then I know the message is not wrong
[30:24] now the messenger the messenger had
[30:29] mistakes he made mistakes he said things
[30:32] that were wrong he taught things that
[30:34] were wrong right but that don't make the
[30:39] message wrong well if he's wrong here
[30:45] he's wrong and I'll that's where people
[30:46] do it a brother that came by here one
[30:48] time a young man starting in the
[30:50] ministry and he came and I let him come
[30:52] and preach forests and and boy he was
[30:55] really on fire for the word you knowing
[30:57] everything but then he read one day
[30:59] brother Ron said if you catch me wrong
[31:00] on one thing said I'm wrong on every
[31:05] well now ain't a man in this world can
[31:07] say that with a sensible answer the Lord
[31:13] Jesus Christ is the only one that would
[31:15] be to the basis that he would never say
[31:17] anything that was wrong the Prophet
[31:21] wasn't saying that he was not wrong in
[31:25] sections as that he was saying the
[31:27] message was right take the message he
[31:33] said see because that's what it's
[31:35] supposed to be all right see then that's
[31:37] what we're supposed to be in this hour -
[31:40] just to see what's taking place in the
[31:44] day that we're living all right now what
[31:49] about it's just genuine now let's get
[31:51] just let's read a few things and you
[31:53] know you say well I don't like to hear
[31:55] the Prophet read well then let's get up
[31:56] and go home okay turn it off that's no
[32:02] problem I'm me yeah but you see I was
[32:07] doing this way back and all these
[32:10] doctrines I've tried to get people to
[32:12] see that and they don't do it these
[32:14] doctrines that are floating around now
[32:15] saying brother Brennan was wrong we were
[32:17] facing this back in 1970 we had
[32:20] ministers meetings over these things in
[32:22] nineteen and seventy and I told them
[32:26] then just what I'm telling you I don't
[32:28] care what you say about brother Branham
[32:30] that's between you and God
[32:33] you better remember one time if he was a
[32:37] prophet that's their choice not me now
[32:40] if he was a prophet
[32:42] remember if you kill a man's influence
[32:48] you killed the man yeah but we're not
[32:51] against brother Branham we're gonna
[32:52] we're gonna keep brother Branham around
[32:54] and quote if you say one thing that he's
[32:59] wrong home you better be willing to put
[33:02] it in the word and see because if not
[33:05] you're gonna face God that's simple as I
[33:07] couldn't think where were you at that's
[33:09] where I stood for 40 50 years now and I
[33:12] don't have to change it because see I
[33:14] haven't found anything that was wrong
[33:18] they had done in church age book years
[33:21] ago remember they had 17 things that was
[33:23] wrong I put it out here put it on the
[33:25] Internet put it online oh they sent out
[33:27] these letters ago I said send it to me
[33:29] come to me and let's talk about it
[33:32] that's not challenge you on that basis
[33:35] the church age book is right you come
[33:38] and show me where it's wrong
[33:40] don't come was I'm a little silly
[33:42] something like we were talking about it
[33:44] life's not how are you gonna do if
[33:46] you're in the word and you say well well
[33:48] we're in the word with you've got four
[33:50] Gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John Waite
[33:55] was talking like this like not Luke and
[34:00] who is it mark they were not original
[34:07] right John and Matthew was original now
[34:11] if I got them right didn't make sure if
[34:13] you don't put the name in the right
[34:14] place oh don't be stupid about it all
[34:17] right see two of those were not even
[34:21] original disciples they never walked
[34:23] with the Lord Jesus but yet Luke says I
[34:27] love him for that he says read it right
[34:31] in the beginning in Luke he said having
[34:34] perfect understanding huh
[34:42] well yet like wait were saying see Luke
[34:44] said one blind man and Jonathan said to
[34:47] well what is that I mean you're gonna
[34:52] declare that that's the Bible that's
[34:54] wrong I'm gonna declare the Word of God
[34:59] written by mankind that one saw two men
[35:02] and wrote of it and one this wrote of
[35:03] one man that simple
[35:05] I tell you that nothing the Baptist
[35:07] Church we didn't have no arguments over
[35:10] that yeah
[35:14] what's that's what I'm getting at see we
[35:17] want to make it because somebody comes
[35:19] along and especially had some kind of a
[35:21] little following and have some kind of
[35:25] anointing you know going and boy that is
[35:28] flock to it
[35:29] this run I threw it they run a while
[35:33] then that floats off and then they come
[35:35] back and then they wait a while they
[35:36] take off like for something else well we
[35:42] don't do that here we try to do one
[35:44] thing just keep on staying with the word
[35:45] I found out it works yeah I found out it
[35:49] works it's just and and it puts you
[35:52] toward that brother all thinking
[35:54] remember he said the other day that men
[35:55] Wade was just kind of little arrogant
[35:57] there what that were do you agree with
[36:01] I'm arrogant I'm proud I'm proud of the
[36:06] Word of God I'm proud of what God has
[36:08] revealed to me aren't you what are you
[36:13] arrogant no I'm not err I got well
[36:16] what's the difference in Harrogate and
[36:17] being stupid there's very little
[36:19] difference in the word all right
[36:21] see but I when I say things like that
[36:23] people don't like me but that's this way
[36:26] I've always been
[36:27] I've always believed if there is a God
[36:32] if he if he can't keep his words
[36:35] straight then he's not God and God said
[36:41] he sent us a prophet you can't go in
[36:45] there and try to define this and define
[36:47] that you leave it alone and wait on God
[36:50] to make it revealed or benefit don't
[36:52] worry about it we'll be a long coat
[36:55] advised in its time okay now get on to
[36:59] that point
[36:59] think about it so what we've been
[37:01] talking about now the anointing there's
[37:05] just one Christ
[37:08] now the devil was anointed he was the
[37:12] anointed cherub but remember he was the
[37:14] anointed cherub so somebody else had to
[37:16] anoint him oh that's sensible if he was
[37:22] anointed Europe he wouldn't God all
[37:25] right see then he got his anointing from
[37:28] God Satan had his permission or have his
[37:31] permission to use certain things against
[37:34] you and I the God allows to take place
[37:37] and what I love is that where we come
[37:39] back in Deuteronomy where he said you
[37:41] know
[37:43] I sent this among you to try you so if a
[37:46] prophet comes and gives you a sign but
[37:49] sister evil to go for after another God
[37:51] or another doctrine or another idea
[37:54] you're not to do that you just stay with
[37:57] the word and let that word be fully made
[38:01] manifest but see one genuine Christ not
[38:08] many know there's many Christ in the
[38:10] basis that are many are anointed but
[38:14] there's only one Christ one faith one
[38:18] Lord one baptism right
[38:22] there's not many gods but if you're
[38:24] gonna have many Christ you gotta have
[38:25] many gods but if you have one Christ
[38:28] even have one God but he can anoint
[38:31] everybody in the world that's no problem
[38:34] because see where that are going didn't
[38:37] go that's what we want to deal with
[38:38] today where that anointing goes and what
[38:43] it does all right now it's a very
[38:48] valuable point than we will recover as
[38:50] we go down that in the Old Testament
[38:57] before Calvary all right you had many
[39:03] that were anointed but there's not one
[39:07] born-again believer in the Old Testament
[39:11] now you show me where it's at I know I
[39:16] know where's now they're saying that
[39:17] that the Twelve Apostles
[39:19] well they've really got that in them
[39:20] from the Church of Christ and because
[39:22] the church Christ says only twelve had
[39:24] it now they're saying the twelve the
[39:26] Twelve Apostles said they had the
[39:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost before Jesus
[39:31] Christ died now tell me how tell me how
[39:42] according to Hebrews now I got these LAN
[39:45] here if you want them according to
[39:46] Hebrews they can't have the testator the
[39:50] Testament without the death of the
[39:52] testator all right see so there was no
[39:57] way if you could be born again before
[40:00] Calvary why did Jesus Christ died he
[40:05] died in vain I knew that in the Baptist
[40:12] Church come on where we act oh you don't
[40:16] like those things yeah you were smart
[40:17] aleck there was one thing about it I
[40:19] never consider myself to be smart but I
[40:21] guess I'll take the point of being an
[40:23] etic I need never fear doubt what that
[40:25] is yet somebody tell me what an elegy is
[40:27] now probably say ask me all right cuz
[40:31] you see I believed it back then we tall
[40:33] things we taught the scriptures I'll get
[40:37] to in a few minutes where that Jesus the
[40:41] Holy Ghost had not been given because
[40:42] Jesus had not been crucified or
[40:44] glorified that was the Bible we read
[40:48] that in the Baptist Church and believes
[40:51] you couldn't be born again until the day
[40:56] of Pentecost why would Jesus Christ have
[40:59] to come you making him die in vain if he
[41:05] could give eternal life
[41:07] yeah but they had eternal of it they
[41:10] were potentially potentially potentially
[41:17] because it had to go through processes
[41:20] to come on down all right so now think
[41:24] about it let's think about that Old
[41:27] Testament person let's think about how
[41:30] that he was in his situation that
[41:33] existed in and then you'll see that it's
[41:36] easy to understand all right we believe
[41:40] Moses right we believe brother Branham
[41:43] said Moses telling God a better way of
[41:45] doing something that was the Christ that
[41:48] was in Moses amen
[41:51] but who was invited when Balaam told
[41:57] Bailey
[41:57] I cannot say nothing that God don't tell
[42:03] me to say it and he didn't what he wound
[42:07] up doing was getting Israeli people over
[42:10] there with him more about women he got
[42:12] it all messed up then he got God to
[42:15] curse Israel cause he couldn't do it
[42:17] himself
[42:18] but when he found out he seen it from
[42:21] the scene wonder he knew that all they
[42:25] had to do was just get them people in
[42:27] the wrong place and God would come on
[42:28] the scene
[42:31] cuz he couldn't do it what about a false
[42:35] prophet standing there now
[42:36] and said I can't do it but you know what
[42:39] he wasn't a false prophet until he come
[42:41] in the face of the prophet he was a
[42:46] prophet of God with his bot with his
[42:48] spirit whatever numbers what did I give
[42:50] you numbers 14 or 24 whatever if I gave
[42:54] it the other day where he has prophecies
[42:56] in the Word of God
[42:57] all right see when we want to look at
[43:01] him as lost and gone in forever when God
[43:04] looked down they wouldn't but one thing
[43:06] to separate Moses and Balaam it was not
[43:14] the anointing they both had it what
[43:21] wasn't it separated the word Moses had
[43:29] the word Balaam had part of it right
[43:35] because his parties in the word but he
[43:40] couldn't stand before that one that was
[43:43] the real word right come on even Janice
[43:51] and jamberries could throw their snakes
[43:52] down and they would turn I'm into sticks
[43:54] down and they turn into snakes like I
[43:59] said I want to go Caiaphas the high
[44:01] priests because of being there
[44:04] that anointing of that high priest would
[44:07] come on him and he would prophesy the
[44:12] Yeti turned around had Jesus killed but
[44:18] the anointing was right there was
[44:23] nothing wrong with the anointing that
[44:24] was on Balaam
[44:25] it was his teaching come on you're
[44:29] supposed to read it you know the
[44:30] anointed ones in time you're supposed to
[44:32] read there I've got plenty of that layin
[44:35] here but you're supposed to read it
[44:38] you're supposed to know these things if
[44:40] you'll read it you'll hear the Prophet
[44:41] saying well why don't you do that and
[44:43] then you don't have to argue what I
[44:44] don't know we're brothers nails right or
[44:45] not we'll read the book right read the
[44:51] book then come and tell me I'm wrong but
[44:55] remember bring the book right make sure
[45:01] you bring the book so we're gonna talk
[45:04] about opinions you know we're gonna talk
[45:08] about the word all right now they said
[45:12] to brother Branham a genuine one Christ
[45:15] go to number three we'll pick this up
[45:17] what were they Christ sees are isds
[45:21] anointed christ and false prophets
[45:24] anointed ones but false prophets and
[45:28] listen to it
[45:30] jesus said that the rain falls on the
[45:33] just and the unjust so now that right
[45:36] there is enough to decide that the same
[45:39] Holy Ghost that was on Balaam was the
[45:41] same Holy Ghost that was on Moses
[45:43] because the rain falls on the just and
[45:46] the unjust do you understand that so
[45:50] that solves any problem you know well I
[45:51] don't know where Moses got Moses got
[45:54] this but Balaam got that come on get off
[45:56] of it you're trying to make up some kind
[45:59] of a story take the Word of God and see
[46:02] what it says now someone might say to me
[46:06] do you believe that that anointing on
[46:08] those people means that it's the
[46:11] anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir
[46:18] the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon a
[46:20] person and yet they are false it solves
[46:27] a problem now come we're gonna read them
[46:28] down here and he said that's done saith
[46:30] the Lord
[46:30] of course now here we are let's be good
[46:33] of course if you don't believe brother
[46:34] branham in the prophet and the message
[46:36] and all I got then him send us that the
[46:38] Lord don't mean a thing right but it
[46:45] does to me because to see I happened to
[46:48] read and I remember reading one day that
[46:53] brother Branham was talking about Balaam
[46:54] and he said to be a prophet in Israel
[46:56] meant a lot Balaam was honored as a
[47:01] prophet and he never turned false until
[47:06] he faced the word he still had the
[47:10] anointing he could still bring flies
[47:13] fleas and frogs if he needed to right
[47:18] because he was anointed right he could
[47:22] call she bears down like Elijah did
[47:25] brother around said that was not the
[47:27] Holy Ghost but he said it was the nature
[47:29] of the Prophet but it worked
[47:36] they told brother branham's to tell us
[47:38] where that all wells at and said we'll
[47:40] put it all into work of the Lord he said
[47:42] I knew they wouldn't do it he said I
[47:45] wouldn't tell him he said somebody else
[47:47] come along and sucked down hit a gusher
[47:50] the thing about it was he just knew but
[47:56] here's my point okay like something like
[47:59] that if brother Branham could tell you
[48:06] we're all well was he at least had some
[48:08] contacted I don't have what about you
[48:12] may I say it back and look at you he had
[48:15] some contact you don't have does that
[48:19] offend you
[48:20] okay no problem forget it but is it true
[48:28] beylin could stand and do those times
[48:30] Janice and Jam breeze done everything
[48:34] Moses don't accept one thing the one
[48:37] thing that was worth holding and it goes
[48:38] to the word what was the one thing
[48:40] holding from with Jennison Jam breeze
[48:42] you'll see it tide of the word they
[48:45] couldn't take back what they brought go
[48:50] read your Bible Genesis and jammers
[48:52] couldn't take back what they brought but
[48:54] they could bring it
[48:56] you saw either cheap magician you do it
[49:00] you got the platform I ain't gonna call
[49:04] snakes come on but I ain't stupid either
[49:10] I know you ain't go do it so I got to
[49:14] worry about come on if we get up into
[49:20] the realm of the supernatural
[49:21] why don't we thank supernatural you mean
[49:27] to tell me that there's a god that can
[49:29] no ever fly ever NAT every time it
[49:33] passes hi everything that it does before
[49:36] the world ever begun and we
[49:39] peanut-brained bunch of idiots say well
[49:43] God was wrong died her cuz that's what
[49:45] you're saying when you say the Prophet
[49:47] what's wrong come on that's what you're
[49:52] saying if you send the prophets from
[49:53] because the brother branham said a
[49:55] prophet stands before no one he goes
[49:59] directly to God he has no limitations of
[50:04] human elements that's why Balaam could
[50:08] not say anything that God didn't tell
[50:11] him even Balaam if we don't think like
[50:17] that come on listen close now see what
[50:19] it is and they show show signs and
[50:21] wonders and so much that it would
[50:22] deceive the very elect if it were
[50:23] possible and they are anointed with the
[50:26] a genuine holy spirit I know this sounds
[50:29] very foolish but you're going to take
[50:31] but we're going to take time and explain
[50:35] it by the word that that's absolutely
[50:37] thus saith the Lord
[50:40] yeah you're not dealing with something
[50:43] that it's just somebody's idea or
[50:45] thought you're dealing with us saith the
[50:48] Lord
[50:49] now this is what I like cuz I've tried
[50:51] to get this point across and I'll keep
[50:53] bringing it up I probably bring it up
[50:54] again okay go ahead to number see number
[50:57] four excuse me still only noted ones the
[51:02] teachings of Balaam not two prophecies
[51:04] available that was all right that was
[51:07] God oh I mean he believes that and he
[51:15] believes that was God don't raise your
[51:18] hand
[51:23] congregation says Amen prophecy of
[51:26] Balaam was exactly right because he
[51:28] couldn't speak nothing else the
[51:31] anointing of God wouldn't speak nothing
[51:33] else and God vindicated it by proving it
[51:36] by the truth proving it was the truth
[51:39] but it was the teachings of Balaam and
[51:42] compare that with Matthew 24:24 anointed
[51:47] ones but their teaching is false the
[51:50] Trinity's and all these things like that
[51:52] wrong Antichrist now I like this one I
[51:56] hope you don't your feelings don't get
[51:58] hurt and don't turn that them phones off
[52:01] in other words I do with you we don't
[52:04] hit the button in the earthís I got two
[52:07] hearing aids and all like I do what's
[52:08] going into this cut the whole thing off
[52:11] don't do do that I hope your feelings
[52:14] don't get hurt and don't turn that them
[52:16] phones off and don't get up and go out
[52:18] just sit still and listen if the Holy
[52:20] Spirit won't reveal it to us and prove
[52:22] it to us you say but that just whatever
[52:25] you believe in other words you're saying
[52:26] it's just whatever just sit still and
[52:29] listen ask God to open your heart
[52:39] that's God open your heart then you'll
[52:43] find out whether you're a Brower
[52:46] you know sticky briar every how you
[52:49] pronounce that I'll get my words I'm
[52:51] southern
[52:51] all right thistle or wherever you're
[52:56] standing now think about it ask God to
[53:02] open your heart so that you can find out
[53:05] whether you're born again or not I know
[53:14] anointed ones yeah but I believe I love
[53:16] the work come on it's in the anointed
[53:18] ones I've got it in here if I don't read
[53:20] it you go ahead and read it when you get
[53:21] on brother branham's said you say does
[53:24] them anointed ones believe in the
[53:27] baptism when the Holy Ghost he said yes
[53:29] sir
[53:29] they believe in signs and wonders they
[53:31] believe in all kind of things okay so
[53:38] you know we might find out whether we're
[53:40] born-again or not by considering what
[53:44] the prophet has taught us about anointed
[53:46] ones now when did he teach anointed ones
[53:49] I know there's little lay ins back
[53:51] through the message I've read it all not
[53:54] everything but I've studied it pretty
[53:56] well but when did the message come out
[53:59] unwanted ones after the opening of the
[54:02] seals okay let's see if that's right go
[54:09] ahead to number five
[54:14] still from a noted ones seeing all this
[54:17] accumulation of evidence that the hour
[54:20] that we now live in I think it's a good
[54:23] thing to rehearse these things and draw
[54:27] them out since the seals has been opened
[54:32] and find out the truth of these things
[54:36] as God has been so loyal to us with His
[54:40] grace to show us these things what is it
[54:45] after the opening of the seals he said
[54:50] well he knew about this he knew it
[54:51] that's what I said there's a little
[54:53] things put in there come on we're not
[54:55] arguing we're talking about truth after
[54:59] the opening of the seals these things
[55:03] came forth but Ron said marriage and
[55:07] divorce was revealing a seagull right he
[55:10] said the rapture was revealing two seals
[55:12] he said predestination was reading the
[55:14] illness it he said everything was
[55:15] revealed two seals right so then what
[55:20] did we have need of not to bring us the
[55:23] message of anointed but to bring us the
[55:28] message of the opening of the world that
[55:31] we would find out where we are
[55:37] well you offend me because you're you're
[55:40] saying I'm not born again ain't never
[55:43] told nobody that they wasn't born again
[55:50] I'll say this and be honest with it I
[55:53] won't call his name but there was a
[55:54] brother went to church here years ago
[55:56] and he left here and he went somewhere
[56:00] else and he said the reason he left was
[56:02] because brother Dale said he didn't have
[56:04] the new birth now he lied I didn't say
[56:10] that so I went straight to his face and
[56:13] told him I said you know what I say I
[56:16] said you don't act like you're acting
[56:19] with the new birth I didn't say he
[56:23] wasn't born again I put it plain
[56:25] language you don't act like you're
[56:28] acting and say you have the new birth
[56:31] right tell me the whole truth look in
[56:38] the last days there she'll write false
[56:40] anointed ones now that seems almost
[56:43] impossible they the terms of anointed
[56:46] but notice the very words anointed huh
[56:50] after the opening of the seals we didn't
[56:55] have understanding back before them but
[57:00] now we have the understanding from the
[57:02] opening of the seals but if the seal
[57:04] that broke to you and that's what people
[57:06] who say the seals that broke to me
[57:07] well okay then to seal that broke to you
[57:08] you can't understand an order one you
[57:11] don't understand marriage and divorce
[57:12] you don't understand predestination you
[57:15] don't understand any of those things if
[57:16] the seals are not broke to you because
[57:20] the Prophet brought us to see that was
[57:21] what his message was to do was to bring
[57:24] the end to our plan of redemption called
[57:25] seven seals now listen I want to get
[57:33] this point in come on see then in the
[57:40] Old Testament of course I know people
[57:44] say that's what I said it's already out
[57:45] in the message now that they're saying
[57:47] that what or one man done uncalled his
[57:50] entire view only two but if it's all
[57:52] right
[57:52] he said them Twelve Apostles had the
[57:57] Holy Ghost before Jesus was crucified
[58:01] now challenge that on the basis of God's
[58:03] Word let alone what the prophet has said
[58:05] and we'll just take the Bible we won't
[58:09] even study won't even say what the
[58:10] prophet had to say though we know what
[58:11] he said if he taught one Christ you know
[58:16] what he said all right so now listen to
[58:20] what he says what if say it that same
[58:25] anointing okay alright now let's get
[58:33] something to put in here or we'll just
[58:35] have a little bit we'll jump about a
[58:37] little bit now they have these
[58:39] okay brothers if you can bring up 7b its
[58:43] what shall I do with Jesus called Christ
[58:45] says but in Matthew the twenty-fourth
[58:48] chapter beginning with the 21st to the
[58:51] 26th verse he predicted that the spirit
[58:54] in this system would be so much like the
[58:57] real thing it would deceive the very
[58:59] elect
[58:59] if it was possible the elected whose
[59:02] names are put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[59:04] before the foundation of the world and
[59:08] frankly it got them so tied up until he
[59:15] said if he didn't cut the work short for
[59:18] their sake there would be no flesh saved
[59:20] upon the earth now I didn't say that the
[59:33] Prophet is one it said it he said I
[59:37] can't be deceived I Malak I agree with
[59:40] you I agree with no problem the elect
[59:45] candidates a factory with you 1,000% but
[59:50] you can be so caught up with the devil
[59:52] in his doings until you were just
[59:55] listening before we came in today of the
[59:58] Prophet and he was explaining that the
[1:00:00] wife of Adam went into sin then he
[1:00:08] explained the wife of Jehovah went into
[1:00:13] sin then he explained the wife at Nicaea
[1:00:20] went into sin oh I've seen preachers
[1:00:24] jump up and down the screaming halt and
[1:00:26] try to run on everything in the world
[1:00:27] but it's still done it brother run said
[1:00:29] that bride never went down there than
[1:00:30] hacia oh it wasn't the real bride that
[1:00:33] brother Branham said the real bride all
[1:00:37] right if you argue with him I ain't
[1:00:38] arguing with you I'm stating what he
[1:00:40] said what did it need to argue about the
[1:00:42] other side the true bride went to Nicaea
[1:00:47] to try to convert them and come back
[1:00:49] with ideas that took 300 years the
[1:00:52] devout
[1:00:55] because there was some guy was down
[1:00:57] there you know the thing and they had
[1:00:59] Jesus as a demon God
[1:01:02] that's a Nazi in Council 325 AD but
[1:01:09] listen jerks I'm trying to get you to
[1:01:12] think sensibly are you born again or not
[1:01:17] well I've done this I've done that the
[1:01:20] Old Testament science let's just stand
[1:01:22] the Old Testament look at the things in
[1:01:25] the Old Testament three Hebrew children
[1:01:28] throwed the fiery furnace Daniel told
[1:01:32] the lines then David killin fire line
[1:01:38] John you gotta admit they were anointed
[1:01:43] right but yet they were not born again
[1:01:53] well I think they would well all right
[1:01:55] tell me where you get yourself from cuz
[1:02:01] it was a statement I asked you a minute
[1:02:02] ago it solves the whole problem without
[1:02:05] saying anything yeah if you were born
[1:02:07] again before Calvary then Jesus Christ
[1:02:09] in out to die that's why people don't
[1:02:15] understand the new birth then they get
[1:02:18] all upset when you start talking to them
[1:02:20] about it because they think is you're
[1:02:21] trying to destroy their new birth come
[1:02:25] on
[1:02:28] can we read I gave them this they might
[1:02:32] not be able to pull it up modern events
[1:02:35] made clear by prophecy brothers a couple
[1:02:36] of late on the desk I want to go I'm
[1:02:39] gonna give you one that'll choke you the
[1:02:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean
[1:02:44] you're going in not at all
[1:02:47] not on that don't have anything to do
[1:02:50] with your soul that's the baptism see
[1:02:56] here's the inside soul and here that has
[1:03:00] to come from God remember in that spirit
[1:03:05] you can be baptized
[1:03:06] the genuine spirit of God and still be
[1:03:09] lost
[1:03:17] have I become your enemy because I found
[1:03:20] the truth and read it to you to try to
[1:03:22] save your soul but you've got all your
[1:03:26] dependence upon something you've done or
[1:03:28] didn't do or this is that good instead
[1:03:30] of the one thing you can put it on they
[1:03:32] have a one thing you can put your new
[1:03:34] birth on that's whether or not that word
[1:03:36] has been revealed to you anything else
[1:03:39] that devil can copycat every one of them
[1:03:42] I believe the word so far I don't know
[1:03:47] okay let's go another funny leadership
[1:03:50] come on remember in that spirit you'll
[1:03:54] be by leadership see many of you think I
[1:03:58] got the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm
[1:04:01] going to heaven that don't mean one
[1:04:04] thing that you're going to heaven can I
[1:04:12] be just straight honest forgive me Lord
[1:04:18] for using words that are wrong these
[1:04:21] stupid idiots that claim brother Branham
[1:04:24] was wrong here in wrong gar why don't
[1:04:26] they go in something like that and talk
[1:04:28] about it then go go in there cuz they
[1:04:33] don't know what he's saying
[1:04:36] they've blinded out to what he's saying
[1:04:39] if I was gonna prove retros wrong I'd
[1:04:42] take him right there but I got that
[1:04:45] sense of no he wasn't wrong doesn't know
[1:04:53] he wasn't wrong when he said you can be
[1:04:55] born again and then be baptized into the
[1:04:57] body hey man just get it in the right
[1:05:04] place come on what do you say you say I
[1:05:08] got the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm
[1:05:10] going to heaven that don't mean one
[1:05:11] thing that you're going to heaven no sir
[1:05:14] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:16] Ghost ever hour in your life and still
[1:05:19] be lost
[1:05:20] and go to hell the Bible says so that's
[1:05:23] exactly right
[1:05:24] now do you believe that do you believe
[1:05:30] it after he said it well I felt ready to
[1:05:34] know see if you're doubting it can you
[1:05:39] put your whole life on that statement
[1:05:42] wait a minute brother Dale cause he
[1:05:43] asked me put my whole life on it because
[1:05:45] I put my whole life back that one time
[1:05:47] that brother Branham was my horse rider
[1:05:50] he talked why horse rider for 20 30
[1:05:53] years wrong a man he did and clerk
[1:05:57] Larkin even taught it before brother
[1:05:58] Branham come along at the white horse
[1:06:00] rider was the antique rock but that
[1:06:01] didn't make no change in the corners
[1:06:03] Larkin wouldn't profit he's my lucky
[1:06:07] guess
[1:06:08] he had two choices we took one another
[1:06:12] come on what are you saying brother Dale
[1:06:17] I'm saying one time do we believe the
[1:06:22] Bible and do we believe it's right and
[1:06:32] there's not to be questioned yeah what'd
[1:06:40] you say but he did and we all agree been
[1:06:42] around him for what 30 40 years I know
[1:06:44] up to the church age book coat it up
[1:06:46] into there when he gets into the one of
[1:06:49] the life's names coming on though we'll
[1:06:51] get to some other things in a minute why
[1:06:54] don't people get into that to show
[1:06:55] brother Branham was wrong ain't got
[1:06:57] enough sense
[1:06:58] pardon my playing Georgia language
[1:07:01] that's exactly what I mean and what I
[1:07:04] say because it's very simple you
[1:07:12] remember the dream about the pyramid
[1:07:17] Mountain right you remember the bar that
[1:07:23] was whipped to top off and looked down
[1:07:26] in there and saw things and brother
[1:07:28] branham what did he say he said light
[1:07:30] had never shined on this
[1:07:35] lot had never shined on the white horse
[1:07:38] rider as being the Antichrist so it
[1:07:45] could be your guess or thoughts until it
[1:07:48] was brought out but once it was brought
[1:07:50] out in the sealed that he ended it
[1:07:52] forever
[1:07:59] is this very simple him well I don't
[1:08:04] agree well come on you explain that you
[1:08:08] explain how that brother branham could
[1:08:09] be the Prophet and I want you to explain
[1:08:11] this before you get up here so you'll
[1:08:12] know better to get up here so you start
[1:08:16] this away to say what you're gonna say
[1:08:17] just remember one time I'll show you
[1:08:21] were in the same message that brother
[1:08:23] Branham said the white horse rider was
[1:08:25] the Holy Ghost he will say if I am right
[1:08:30] let God come on the scene and vindicate
[1:08:34] and he came on the scene and vindicated
[1:08:37] it now did God vindicate life no lot had
[1:08:41] never shined there was no responsibility
[1:08:46] that white horse rider was a sealed
[1:08:48] saint there was no no way anybody could
[1:08:52] bring that out until the seals broke
[1:08:54] through the Prophet
[1:08:55] oh you think about that first day when
[1:08:59] he seen that he said I was fixing to
[1:09:04] preach on the things that I had preached
[1:09:07] before and he said I would have been
[1:09:09] wrong he said in the Holy Spirit coming
[1:09:12] straighten me out
[1:09:21] what about it you see we follow a
[1:09:25] message that the message is infallible
[1:09:27] the person wasn't infallible he was a
[1:09:30] human element right with the message we
[1:09:36] follow but it had to be put into a place
[1:09:40] to be infallible I like the way brother
[1:09:42] all tick was bringing out sometimes you
[1:09:43] remember if until you're responsible to
[1:09:48] put in my words okay until that will
[1:09:51] come forth and those seals opened up
[1:09:53] nobody was responsible brother Brennan
[1:09:55] said you say what I say because I am
[1:10:00] responsible right now what did why did
[1:10:03] he say that I mean was we going to
[1:10:08] deliver to go out and lie about
[1:10:09] something or preach something wrong or
[1:10:11] do something no he just knew some things
[1:10:15] was not exactly settled because he knew
[1:10:24] Malachi four had not come because
[1:10:26] remember spoken word original seed 1962
[1:10:30] which was prior to this opening of the
[1:10:32] seals
[1:10:33] he said Malachi 4 is not fulfilled yet
[1:10:37] that's on spoken words original seed the
[1:10:43] until the prophet brought lightly I
[1:10:45] stayed another one he's deep joking I
[1:10:47] was listening to tape one day and I
[1:10:48] thought oh honey back and listen but I
[1:10:50] run said the Baptist just to become a
[1:10:52] denomination that's long in about 60 I
[1:10:56] felt oh god what's wrong here the
[1:10:59] Baptist was a denomination of 200 years
[1:11:01] for the inn or something they had never
[1:11:07] rejected his message when they rejected
[1:11:12] his message they become a denomination
[1:11:14] every one of them denominations stood
[1:11:17] before that prophet I don't care what
[1:11:18] their dates was they stood before him
[1:11:21] because when he brought that word pure
[1:11:24] and unadulterated that's what he said he
[1:11:26] said we've done this and they've done
[1:11:27] that he said it's been brought peering
[1:11:29] under adultery he brought it right
[1:11:32] this message is 1000% correct
[1:11:36] show me one flaw in it other than some
[1:11:39] mistake you make her adulterer or
[1:11:42] something you say just missing a while I
[1:11:48] got it in here to brain I won't get to
[1:11:50] it today
[1:11:51] I'll get it's evening brother branham
[1:11:53] from the time he started up until 16
[1:11:56] almost opening of the seals
[1:11:58] he told body so spirit named him gave
[1:12:09] there what happened after the opening of
[1:12:14] the seals he's talked body spirit and
[1:12:17] soul you say but he never correct that
[1:12:23] he didn't have to because he was right
[1:12:27] he said happy to be right over here
[1:12:29] right over that that's what I older
[1:12:31] let's leave it with you in order to go
[1:12:32] home and say forget it you're so smart
[1:12:36] about it now tell me what you see he
[1:12:43] never changed the census of any of those
[1:12:47] three places in his early ministry he
[1:12:50] always gave you body five senses always
[1:12:55] gave the second room no matter what he
[1:12:57] called it five senses memory reason
[1:12:59] conservation he always gave the sinner
[1:13:00] realm one sense either faith or doubt
[1:13:03] that's that identically what he'd done
[1:13:06] after the opening of the seals they
[1:13:07] didn't matter he just changed the
[1:13:09] wording caused our Hebrews 4:12 and he
[1:13:14] knows what he bruised 4:12 says that the
[1:13:17] word is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:13:20] intents of the heart the dividing
[1:13:22] between the soul and the spirit and
[1:13:25] joining tomorrow the church that's where
[1:13:32] we've we've waited for it wait why the
[1:13:36] message has been brought to us why can't
[1:13:42] we just hold on long without to get it
[1:13:44] like I was saying a minute ago
[1:13:46] to the point to where it would be a
[1:13:50] short word these original translation
[1:13:54] when it comes to math you go ahead and
[1:13:57] number or 7b okay we don't got that
[1:14:02] Franklin over 7c where he will finish
[1:14:08] the work and cut it short in
[1:14:11] righteousness because a short work will
[1:14:14] the Lord make upon the earth a short
[1:14:20] work that means he was intending I mean
[1:14:23] human thinking he wasn't intending to
[1:14:25] let it go out of another thousand years
[1:14:27] but he decided to cut it off is that
[1:14:29] what it's saying that's that's the point
[1:14:34] that he he was going out but he decided
[1:14:36] enough that's not the scripture is the
[1:14:42] scripture because of short work with the
[1:14:45] Lord make upon the earth go to the next
[1:14:48] one seven be the definition of the word
[1:14:52] work he shall do a short word look at it
[1:14:58] word say in account speech a word
[1:15:02] uttered by living embodiment of
[1:15:04] conception that things that long if you
[1:15:06] want to keep reading it just check it
[1:15:07] out it doesn't mean a short work like he
[1:15:11] was gonna let it run out so long but he
[1:15:13] cuts it short an infinite God knows
[1:15:16] every second and everything what's going
[1:15:18] to take place in right to the T but it's
[1:15:21] a short word word he's going to pour the
[1:15:25] word in fiest in the life days I've said
[1:15:29] that since I come in the message I could
[1:15:31] see it on that because that was the
[1:15:33] meaning it's the opening of the word cuz
[1:15:42] the words the only way you'll know right
[1:15:43] around him I got him in here how you
[1:15:45] gonna know whether you're whether these
[1:15:47] are known in wonder whether you know he
[1:15:49] said it's only by the word of the day of
[1:15:51] the hour could you tell me anything that
[1:15:58] you say you know you're safe
[1:16:00] of showings oh I see how did I cry -
[1:16:04] smoking - everything Satan could
[1:16:06] impersonate it takes one thing you can't
[1:16:10] do can be so close but listen you can't
[1:16:14] be the Holy Ghost they can't do that and
[1:16:19] he can't bring it word by word so you
[1:16:22] see what they're doing in the last days
[1:16:24] they're picking apart the message and
[1:16:26] the little things of what the Prophet is
[1:16:29] saying trying to tear apart and get you
[1:16:34] to wear that you don't have confidence
[1:16:36] in the message now don't tell me I'm too
[1:16:40] old sorry
[1:16:42] don't tell me it don't bother you what
[1:16:45] is being done in this life days if it
[1:16:49] don't bother you you need the baptism of
[1:16:52] the Holy Ghost may I quote the Bible and
[1:16:55] the Prophet sighing and crying for the
[1:16:58] abominations done in the city is that
[1:17:01] the evidence of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:17:03] what your prophet said you mean it
[1:17:08] doesn't bother you things that are
[1:17:14] taking place they don't bother you we
[1:17:20] were up to get way to tell you we were
[1:17:22] up to Dylan though I've Hunton supposed
[1:17:24] to hunt another day we found out about
[1:17:29] the what happened with the brother and

[1:20:07] message in you do you understand he's
[1:20:16] gonna do a short word he's gonna pour
[1:20:21] the word into the life stage and you
[1:20:23] look at it that's what's taking place
[1:20:25] but what did all this others doing okay
[1:20:30] just forgive me you say you said a
[1:20:37] moment ago let's just take the Bible all
[1:20:40] right in the Old Testament they could
[1:20:41] not have the new birth so let's read the
[1:20:44] Bible if they can pull these up go ahead
[1:20:50] and start and get hitting number eight
[1:20:54] Matthew 18:3 and said firstly I say unto
[1:20:58] you except you be converted and become
[1:21:01] as little children you shall not enter
[1:21:03] into the kingdom of heaven now we're
[1:21:06] there converted come on Luke 22 32 what
[1:21:14] I have prayed for thee who is this Peter
[1:21:16] that I faith fail not and when thou art
[1:21:20] converted strengthen thy brethren what
[1:21:25] does converting mean they were not
[1:21:30] converted back there Nicodemus it comes
[1:21:33] to him and says you must be born again
[1:21:36] if he had to be born again there was
[1:21:38] something wrong with the way he's born
[1:21:39] to start with right and he couldn't have
[1:21:43] eternal life Nicodemus was the greatest
[1:21:46] teacher of all Israel jesus said in John
[1:21:50] 14:26 but the comforter which is the
[1:21:53] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[1:21:54] my name he shall teach you all things
[1:21:56] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:21:58] whatsoever I have said unto you the
[1:22:00] comforter what is the concert sir oh
[1:22:02] okay John 15:26 but when the comforter
[1:22:05] is come whom I will send on
[1:22:10] who you from the father even the Spirit
[1:22:14] of Truth which proceedeth from the
[1:22:15] father and he shall testify of me the
[1:22:20] comforter who's the comforter but when
[1:22:23] the comforter John 15:26 well when the
[1:22:25] comforter is come whom I will send unto
[1:22:28] you from the father even the Spirit of
[1:22:30] Truth okay there's got to read Anila
[1:22:31] John 16:7 it is expedient for you that I
[1:22:36] go away for if I go not away the
[1:22:39] comforter will not come unto you but if
[1:22:41] I depart I was in him unto you what do
[1:22:47] you say it Jesus Christ had to come and
[1:22:50] be crucified and on the cross and go
[1:22:53] away before the Holy Ghost could come
[1:22:55] that's plain since come on
[1:22:58] I know you don't like it we taught this
[1:23:00] in a Baptist Church my Bible didn't
[1:23:03] change like most of people's did it was
[1:23:06] the same Bible I read John 16 and 7
[1:23:12] number one we've done guy
[1:23:13] it's me view that I go no fun go not
[1:23:15] away the comforter won't come John 16:13
[1:23:18] howbeit when he the spirit of truth is
[1:23:20] come he will guide you into all things
[1:23:23] you speak Hebrews 9 16 for there where a
[1:23:27] testament is there must also necessity
[1:23:30] be the death of the testator where a
[1:23:33] testament is of force after men are dead
[1:23:36] otherwise it is of no strength at all
[1:23:39] while the testator liveth is that plain
[1:23:44] of that oh but they want to get onto
[1:23:48] something like this then said Jesus unto
[1:23:51] them peace be unto you as my father sent
[1:23:53] me so send I you
[1:23:54] and when he had said this he breathed on
[1:23:58] them and saith unto them receive ye the
[1:24:01] Holy Ghost
[1:24:04] well they say well brother Dale right
[1:24:06] the ire says it he breathed on them and
[1:24:08] and they reach now I didn't say they
[1:24:10] received come on
[1:24:18] whoever sins you remit they were emitted
[1:24:21] when he breathed on them and said to
[1:24:23] them receive you the whole to go brother
[1:24:24] branham what does that mean
[1:24:26] of course if he's not a prophet we don't
[1:24:29] need it sister of Tutsi versus sister
[1:24:32] Tutsi get up and tell us what this means
[1:24:34] she ain't gonna get up and say it cuz
[1:24:36] she ain't no woman preacher right she
[1:24:40] got no sense not to be one you
[1:24:42] understand what I'm getting at I'm
[1:24:45] trying to get her truth to where we can
[1:24:46] look at it brother branham okay 1964
[1:24:50] were questions and answers dear brother
[1:24:52] branham what is the difference when
[1:24:53] Jesus breathed on the disciples and said
[1:24:55] receive you the Holy Ghost and when they
[1:24:58] when they had to go to the upper room to
[1:25:00] tarry it was a promise he gave them
[1:25:05] breathed upon them his promise said
[1:25:09] receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a
[1:25:11] promise they went to the upper room to
[1:25:14] wait for the promise to be fulfilled the
[1:25:16] same thing is when we lay hands upon you
[1:25:18] and you be healed then you go about your
[1:25:21] business waiting for the promise to be
[1:25:23] fulfilled see we've got the answer to
[1:25:27] people that come up with it and say well
[1:25:30] it says right here that he breathed on
[1:25:33] them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:25:39] now what are you going to say okay go
[1:25:47] ahead John 7:37 in the last days that
[1:25:50] great day of the feast Jesus stood and
[1:25:52] saying if any man thirst let him come
[1:25:53] unto me and drink he that believeth on
[1:25:56] me as the scripture has said out of his
[1:25:58] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[1:26:00] but this spake he of the Spirit which
[1:26:03] they that believe on him should receive
[1:26:06] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[1:26:09] because that Jesus was not yet glorified
[1:26:15] give you a Bible answer then now
[1:26:19] somebody comes along said this just
[1:26:20] pulling out and get to him in the Bible
[1:26:24] the Bible plainly tells you what it's
[1:26:26] saying
[1:26:28] right they could not get the Holy Ghost
[1:26:31] until Jesus Christ was crucified but yet
[1:26:39] we're so we're in the message we believe
[1:26:42] read a random talk this and so we're
[1:26:44] saying that they you know you get born
[1:26:46] again before
[1:26:48] well you just swap places with the
[1:26:50] Church of Christ because the Church of
[1:26:51] Christ said 12 couldn't get to Holy
[1:26:53] Ghost now you're saying they could so
[1:26:56] you just swap doctrines right you don't
[1:27:01] want me to say who that's wrong now look
[1:27:12] anointed ones anointed ones those Old
[1:27:21] Testament people could be anointed but
[1:27:24] they could only be anointed on their
[1:27:26] spirit because their soul was blackish
[1:27:28] sucked now you tell me how I could be
[1:27:33] made any other way their soul was black
[1:27:41] his suit they don't matter how good they
[1:27:43] was who they were born in what family or
[1:27:45] what this water that was don't have
[1:27:47] nothing to do with it their soul was
[1:27:52] black his such brother branham said
[1:27:55] David all he needed said he had the word
[1:27:58] you remember he said it I believe was
[1:27:59] David the songs would not word have I
[1:28:02] hid in my heart that I might not sin
[1:28:03] against thee he said all he needed was
[1:28:04] the baptism with Holy Ghost then I've
[1:28:07] always said this away you just think
[1:28:09] about David kill a bear a giant a line
[1:28:12] in a giant without the Holy Ghost what
[1:28:15] would happen had he got it he just put
[1:28:20] them all together since bring your
[1:28:21] brothers right cause you claimed he had
[1:28:26] about four or five more brothers you
[1:28:27] know come on you understand he may I
[1:28:33] quote some things David would not have
[1:28:36] committed adultery had he had the new
[1:28:37] birth in her soul
[1:28:44] a lot of things can be said but I hope
[1:28:47] you get it those people in the Old
[1:28:52] Testament did not have no new birth they
[1:28:53] did not have eternal life but yet look
[1:28:57] at all the things that took place in
[1:29:00] their lives
[1:29:01] one man jumped down into a pit one day
[1:29:04] just killed the line just yes there's no
[1:29:09] problem to why because they knew they
[1:29:14] were anointed you remember my story
[1:29:16] about it David D David killed a lion in
[1:29:21] the bar huh but yet he winds up and he
[1:29:28] gets anointed Oh Samuel like I said he
[1:29:33] just said put them all together cause
[1:29:37] David knew you don't think about the
[1:29:40] anointing like this this is what I
[1:29:41] thought anointing I'll get to it one of
[1:29:43] these days of preaching anointing is not
[1:29:45] this better you know there's not sound
[1:29:47] and Wonder anointing is supreme power in
[1:29:49] control that's what your profit
[1:29:50] statement and there David was and all
[1:29:54] these things and David doing all the
[1:29:57] things he was doing but yet he had that
[1:29:59] anointing David knew samuel was a
[1:30:03] prophet there's how much he trusted do
[1:30:06] you trust this prophet as being the
[1:30:08] prophet of melech I for Luke 17 30
[1:30:11] revelations himself do you put your
[1:30:13] whole life on it the David walked out
[1:30:16] there and faced everything that was in
[1:30:18] his way on one thing Samuel anointed me
[1:30:22] to be king of Israel he knew he could
[1:30:26] not die be killed run over done whatever
[1:30:29] until he said on that throne now I think
[1:30:32] David was smart after he climbs up and
[1:30:35] sits down on the throne he said oh Lord
[1:30:37] I don't well Noah knowing he write I'm
[1:30:43] serious I think when he got to facing it
[1:30:46] he said I don't know how they're
[1:30:48] learning now god I couldn't be killed
[1:30:50] until this took place now
[1:30:52] I can be killed cold I don't have any
[1:30:54] word for it Sam y'all were are you had
[1:30:58] tell me the future and he come back and
[1:31:02] Toby see do we put our confidence in
[1:31:05] brother branham being the Prophet we put
[1:31:12] our confidence in the basis of the
[1:31:14] prophet of this day told us these things
[1:31:18] the I don't understand everything he
[1:31:21] said I ain't never claimed to but I've
[1:31:24] always said this you give God time he'll
[1:31:27] give you the answer hours worth of
[1:31:29] troubles that we try to figure it out
[1:31:31] when I preach Daniel 70 weeks 1974 you
[1:31:35] ought to see my book my book I had a
[1:31:39] question mark everything brought around
[1:31:41] and said I didn't know what he said that
[1:31:43] had a question mark question mark
[1:31:45] question mark question mark question
[1:31:47] mark I'd read the book I could put it up
[1:31:51] because hey you remember what the
[1:31:54] Prophet said Daniel Sedin doing if you
[1:31:56] don't understand Daniel 7 weeks you
[1:31:57] don't understand the seals the files the
[1:31:59] plagues Allah now I didn't say that he's
[1:32:00] when it said it you see I put that book
[1:32:05] up then I come back and I read it again
[1:32:08] mmm take off about half that question
[1:32:12] you know cause something is coming
[1:32:14] through something filtering through and
[1:32:18] then that a while I just race that
[1:32:19] question huh I would not preach Daniel
[1:32:22] 70 weeks with one question mark marking
[1:32:25] down my book and look at it with one
[1:32:27] question marking that book I wouldn't
[1:32:31] preach it got on your wooden right but
[1:32:35] now I stand on that and have for 40
[1:32:37] years coming let's see the Prophet told
[1:32:42] it and we believe it go right back where
[1:32:45] we started
[1:32:45] how are we gonna know whether we're born
[1:32:48] again or not you can't do it by his done
[1:32:51] yet what I'm saying right you can't
[1:32:54] understand the early ministry of the of
[1:32:58] the Prophet and the later ministry has
[1:33:01] been the same ministry and come out
[1:33:04] together with the right answer
[1:33:05] got to have them you know maybe I said
[1:33:08] that wrong you've got to have the early
[1:33:09] ministry in the later ministry you know
[1:33:11] what I'm saying you know what they're
[1:33:13] teaching into message
[1:33:14] you can't touch brother Brown him back
[1:33:15] in the old days but after the seals
[1:33:17] broke we'll take what he said well boy
[1:33:19] you in bad shape
[1:33:21] but I will tell you that there's a truth
[1:33:24] to it they wouldn't read of random talk
[1:33:26] body soul spirit it set the stage where
[1:33:30] you to sold people could quote brother
[1:33:34] around him and they said this away the
[1:33:39] soul is just the nature of the spirit
[1:33:40] they messed up there's not a quote where
[1:33:45] he said that yeah bring me one where he
[1:33:49] says then it's just the nature of the
[1:33:52] Holy Spirit no he always said it was the
[1:33:56] nature you say what's that carnal that's
[1:33:58] the stupidity death no it's not too
[1:34:00] stupid to mean it means one time if you
[1:34:04] say it's just the baptism it can be
[1:34:06] anything if you say it is the baptism
[1:34:09] now you got the Bible let me stay with
[1:34:13] this word come on musician let me get
[1:34:16] planted into this word you say well
[1:34:21] you're not a you're not afraid to
[1:34:23] produce what you believe no way I'm glad
[1:34:25] to produce what I believe to preach what
[1:34:28] I believe to declare what I believe
[1:34:30] because what I stood on has made the
[1:34:33] point that worth it a lot of these
[1:34:34] questions and answers if you're wait on
[1:34:36] God God will give you the answer but if
[1:34:42] you try to figure it out yourself
[1:34:44] he don't have to give us no answer leave
[1:34:49] it alone
[1:34:50] I've never tried to make nobody believe
[1:34:52] what I believe my family my wife my kids
[1:34:55] grandkids or anybody I don't try to make
[1:34:58] nobody believe what I believe I try to
[1:35:00] preach what I believe but I challenge
[1:35:05] you to bring one time and show me where
[1:35:07] I've missed the prophets message oh
[1:35:09] you're getting exalted now what is that
[1:35:12] word brother though they were saying
[1:35:13] little arc that little little little
[1:35:15] arrogant okay little little Erica put a
[1:35:18] little stupidity on top of it
[1:35:19] you coming down for the will where I'm
[1:35:20] at okay I'm just that honest to say one
[1:35:25] thing I don't care what they say about
[1:35:27] the Prophet because I'd like to see him
[1:35:34] come and stand before somebody that was
[1:35:37] genuine and them say the Prophet was
[1:35:40] wrong and you say okay you produce it
[1:35:46] you produce it because if he's wrong
[1:35:50] you're greater than he is if you can
[1:35:54] straighten out God we need to follow you
[1:35:56] that's where people are not getting this
[1:35:58] spirit in the last day the Antichrist
[1:36:01] spirit that's not getting it
[1:36:03] come on give me a second they're not
[1:36:05] getting it why because God has sent this
[1:36:08] among us to try us to see if we'll stay
[1:36:11] with the word or not he's left it to us
[1:36:19] he said one day he said God wants to
[1:36:23] prove that this bride is not to fall
[1:36:24] like a fail this for some little
[1:36:28] something oh you want some questions
[1:36:33] coming let's talk about questions don't
[1:36:37] play with your little bitty ideas get in
[1:36:40] the truth Who am I find out we're just
[1:36:47] anointed one okay we're gonna get to
[1:36:53] that you seen it so I'm gonna go ahead
[1:36:54] and say it this way
[1:36:56] what there's no difference in the
[1:36:58] anointing that was on Moses then there
[1:37:02] was the anointing that was on Balaam I
[1:37:04] don't know where do you agree with that
[1:37:06] that's your business if you agree then
[1:37:08] you set yourself up on a stage because
[1:37:11] here comes the next one where does the
[1:37:13] anointing fall okay we got the Prophet
[1:37:19] they fall down your spirit okay we'll
[1:37:22] get to that just even if falls on your
[1:37:23] spirit okay
[1:37:24] amen they falls on your spirit then we
[1:37:28] got that settled okay
[1:37:31] what about true born-again believer
[1:37:33] where does it do I've preached it and
[1:37:39] continued it ever since I started in
[1:37:41] this message a born-again believer is
[1:37:49] anointed in his spirit a false prophet
[1:37:55] is anointed in his spirit it's the same
[1:37:59] thing there's only one difference the
[1:38:05] true genuine according to the Bible when
[1:38:08] there's Jesus sowed the seed the Bible
[1:38:11] said they took the word and hailed it
[1:38:15] when the Holy Ghost fell all it had to
[1:38:19] come down was on your spirit and
[1:38:24] annoyance the word that's in your soul
[1:38:25] and makes your soul alive there's you
[1:38:28] new birth there's you anointed ones and
[1:38:32] there's your new birth is that soul in
[1:38:35] you does it agree with the word Mustang
