[37:54] with me and being turned I saw seven
[37:56] golden Candlestick in the midst of the
[37:59] seven golden seven candlesticks one like
[38:01] unto the son of man clothed with a
[38:03] garment down to the foot and gird about
[38:05] the pouch with the golden girdle his
[38:07] head and his hairs were quite like wool
[38:10] as wide as snow and his eyes were as a
[38:14] flame of fire and his feet like
[38:16] undefined Bryce if they burned in a
[38:18] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[38:21] many Waters all right let's go over to
[38:24] John now and pick up our thought for
[38:27] today
[38:29] we'll go to John 20 and 19.
[38:35] in the same day at evening being the
[38:37] first day of the week now this remember
[38:38] this is after the resurrection
[38:40] this is coming through and he's already
[38:43] you know seeing a sin you know to Mary I
[38:46] go to my God and your God you know my
[38:48] father and your father and all the Nash
[38:50] coming to the resurrection part
[38:53] then the same day at evening being the
[38:55] first day of the week when the doors
[38:57] were shut where the disciples were
[38:59] assembled for fear the Jews came Jesus
[39:01] and stood in the midst and saith unto
[39:02] them peace be unto you and when he had
[39:05] so said he showed unto them his hands
[39:09] and his side then were the disciples
[39:12] glad when they saw the Lord then said
[39:15] Jesus to them again peace be unto you as
[39:19] my father has sent me even so send I you
[39:23] and when he had said this he breathed on
[39:26] them and saith unto them receive ye the
[39:30] Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they
[39:32] are remitted unto them and whosoever
[39:34] sins you retain they are retained you
[39:38] may be seated the Lord that is blessing
[39:40] to the reading of the word

[40:40] you know but you know just do that and
[40:42] and watch your steps and things but you
[40:46] know you find all you can and that's the
[40:48] best you can do you can't do it this is
[40:51] the time of the year of kind of animals
[40:53] moving around
[40:55] now
[40:57] we have been speaking about the new
[40:59] birth
[41:01] and talking about and found out what it
[41:04] is the new birth
[41:05] it's the birth of the word
[41:08] it's a birth of the word that you have
[41:11] heard
[41:13] and you take that word as the disciples
[41:16] did
[41:17] and you wait and they did finally say
[41:20] that it was come to an understanding
[41:23] and and then it says they would keep the
[41:26] word it would be opened unto them you
[41:30] know and it was and I want you to watch
[41:33] something very closely today as we try
[41:37] to talk about these things but remember
[41:40] now no matter how much words you hear
[41:45] that that word has still got to be
[41:48] quickened
[41:49] or made alive
[41:51] and you can say well I came with this
[41:54] seed in me all right now
[41:56] where's it at and what happened
[41:59] and if you come that way with eternal
[42:02] life what do you need Jesus Christ
[42:04] that's what a lot of people think you
[42:05] know they got quotes and all but
[42:07] remember quotes will kill you because we
[42:10] used to quote Matthew 28 19 right
[42:13] and we used to baptize father son the
[42:15] Holy Ghost right used to believe hell
[42:18] was eternal he used to have a whole lot
[42:19] of thoughts you know but they wouldn't
[42:21] line up with a word all right yet we had
[42:24] quotes for the point
[42:26] but just remember that that as I asked
[42:30] the question there the other day did is
[42:32] the New Birth the birth of the seed that
[42:34] we come we're here with or does it come
[42:36] like the Bible said that Faith cometh by
[42:39] hearing and hearing by the word all
[42:41] right and the brother random remember
[42:43] said the seed was put in you before the
[42:45] foundation of the world so what were you
[42:48] before the foundation world he said only
[42:50] in the mind of God
[42:55] so now in the mind of God evidently he
[42:57] did he knew everybody would ever be
[42:59] saved and everybody'd ever be lost for
[43:02] the foundation of the world
[43:03] all right we'll go along with what the
[43:05] prophet says but when people try to
[43:08] interpret that thought see they bring it
[43:10] to I have this and I don't need anything
[43:13] else because if you do if you came in
[43:16] the world with eternal life you don't
[43:18] need no salvation
[43:20] now that I mean you just don't need it
[43:22] there's no need even talking about it
[43:24] but yet still we we want to do that you
[43:27] know what's so odd is the preachers
[43:29] don't realize I don't mean this
[43:31] comically but it's true and the
[43:33] preachers who preach all these doctrines
[43:34] about these seeds and things don't
[43:36] realize they do it away with their job
[43:40] foreign
[43:42] was
[43:44] eternal you don't need nobody to help
[43:45] you you don't need no preacher you don't
[43:48] even know God you don't need no savior
[43:50] you don't need nothing like that you
[43:52] just you know you just come to
[43:53] acknowledge of it
[43:55] and uh you know I I kind of comical to
[43:58] me that's all right
[44:00] but listen
[44:03] see then we look at the birth of the
[44:06] word
[44:08] and knowing that all natural births
[44:13] come the same way
[44:15] and all spiritual births come the same
[44:18] way
[44:19] and I know that's a little different
[44:21] call than what maybe you had considered
[44:24] but I would desire that you express it
[44:27] to me and explain it because I believe
[44:30] ever baby is born the same way and I
[44:34] believe ever born again Christian is
[44:36] Born the same way well see you're
[44:39] automatically got in there but actually
[44:40] I did I cried I done this and the other
[44:42] person done this you're talking about
[44:44] manifestations you're not talking about
[44:47] the birth
[44:49] wait till we get to it maybe this
[44:51] afternoon
[44:52] I doubt maybe this afternoon
[44:55] but let me just say this point to you
[44:58] have you ever thought about
[45:03] that
[45:04] you know a dog when it's mourned we know
[45:06] it doesn't have a soul but it has a
[45:08] spirit
[45:09] and you know that dog comes into the
[45:11] world
[45:13] barking or whatever you want to call it
[45:15] whining crying whatever you want to call
[45:17] it
[45:19] you ever notice a baby comes into the
[45:21] world
[45:23] and it can cry
[45:26] it can make sounds
[45:28] but you know
[45:30] it can't talk
[45:34] now what's wrong is God every product
[45:39] right
[45:41] but it can't talk
[45:43] it must learn to talk
[45:47] you can you don't consider that
[45:51] you wouldn't consider that in relation
[45:53] to the new birth
[46:01] maybe we need to think things over
[46:04] and consider
[46:07] and as I've said over and over to you I
[46:10] would to God that I could preach
[46:12] that every one of us in this building
[46:13] would find out we were lost
[46:16] that would be my goal
[46:19] then we could do something about it
[46:21] but I realize most people are never
[46:23] going to admit they're lost
[46:25] so if you don't admit your loss you
[46:27] can't be saved
[46:30] that's that's just truth right so if I
[46:33] were you and me and all of us I'd
[46:35] consider a lot of things
[46:37] and listen
[46:39] to the word of God
[46:40] so if the new birth is a birth of the
[46:42] word
[46:43] it's the word Made Alive In You by the
[46:48] holy spirit that comes down and
[46:51] irrigates or strikes or anoints whatever
[46:54] the wordings you want to use that word
[46:57] that you have held
[46:59] and it comes alive there was the
[47:02] disciples as we'll read in a minute even
[47:04] after their understanding was opened
[47:07] to Jesus and the things
[47:09] they were not born again
[47:14] well see then you say well I've got a
[47:16] knowledge well let's say knowledge is
[47:18] wonderful
[47:19] but what have we been emphasizing lately
[47:22] that the prophet emphasized what you can
[47:24] only be saved by revelation
[47:27] has God revealed himself to you
[47:31] personally to you
[47:33] or you're still just thinking I cried I
[47:35] spoke in tongues I done this that or the
[47:37] other
[47:40] you see we need to wake up to that point
[47:42] and think about it
[47:44] he said oh brother Dale what did he
[47:45] reveal to you he began to open this
[47:47] message to me
[47:49] once I received that new birth it began
[47:51] to just unfold into a greater manner or
[47:55] thoughts and it's not stopped
[48:00] now if it stops somewhere along the way
[48:03] it's good sensible knowledge to know you
[48:07] didn't have it it was ever been had
[48:09] knowledge
[48:10] all right do you see the people of the
[48:12] message now that's running writing left
[48:14] is falling out and leaving
[48:16] after 40 Years of preaching it
[48:20] well
[48:21] you know
[48:25] that's between them and God
[48:28] this is between me and you and God
[48:31] what we do here all right
[48:34] but now think about it
[48:37] the birth of the word
[48:41] and then as we covered you know and we
[48:43] covered the last message how that we get
[48:46] the new birth here at Faith that's the
[48:48] birth of the word that's Faith
[48:49] revelation
[48:50] then each one of these is being born
[48:52] again
[48:55] a birth means a coming forth into like a
[48:57] baby comes forth into the world it's a
[48:59] birth and and see you come forth into
[49:01] virtue into knowledge into Tempest
[49:03] patience godliness Etc all right then
[49:06] it'll come forth Into The Headstone
[49:07] which is love and when that is then the
[49:11] individual is then as a prophet would
[49:13] call it statue of a perfect man sealed
[49:16] in
[49:16] not meaning that you're not sealed in
[49:18] you're sealed in by the new birth
[49:21] that faith
[49:22] because that is the holy spirit but it's
[49:24] the holy spirit all the way up to
[49:25] pyramid
[49:27] to bring us out to a birth of the
[49:29] message of the hour
[49:35] from According to as a prophet would
[49:37] call it Malachi 4.
[49:40] a new birth
[49:42] well you think we need a new birth
[49:44] we need a new birth every day
[49:48] every day they received a refilling in
[49:52] the book of Acts right
[49:54] there's one birth but they received a
[49:56] filling when they would meet they would
[49:58] receive a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[50:01] that didn't mean they didn't have
[50:02] anything it meant they did have
[50:03] something if you get a refilling because
[50:06] if you don't have it you can't go to
[50:08] refilling
[50:10] right because that simply means to be
[50:13] filled first and then refilling means to
[50:15] refill
[50:16] but if you you don't have anything it's
[50:19] not a refilling
[50:20] all right it's trying to make points to
[50:23] us to think about ourselves
[50:27] and consider where we're at see all
[50:31] right now
[50:33] if you watch what we're approaching
[50:35] today you will see more and more as we
[50:39] keep speaking about the birth of the
[50:41] word and you'll see why the new birth is
[50:45] that birth of the word
[50:48] all right
[50:49] but then it doesn't stop see it keeps
[50:52] climbing all the way up until we leave
[50:53] out of here all right Being Born Again
[50:56] by The Incorruptible word of God
[51:00] all right now let's take the thought
[51:04] from where we've read here in the
[51:06] scripture
[51:08] and we read here in John that
[51:11] after the resurrection
[51:14] so Judas wouldn't president you can't
[51:16] put him into this
[51:18] after the resurrection
[51:21] after the assembling you know the part
[51:23] of of Mary and them and the going and
[51:26] you know and the doings and the
[51:28] Gathering dinner disciples not in the
[51:30] upper room now this is just a gathering
[51:33] time that they had that they were
[51:35] gathered there because they were all
[51:37] worried and wondering what was going on
[51:39] and they kind of was together and
[51:42] and
[51:43] and when he did Jesus just appeared
[51:45] among them
[51:48] all right and as he did
[51:52] he done something marvelous
[51:56] he said when he had said this he
[51:58] breathed on them
[52:01] after he had said even as a father that
[52:04] sent me
[52:05] you know I send you
[52:08] all right now we know the story of that
[52:10] how was it the father sent the son
[52:14] not a second person somebody sent like
[52:17] we want the word sent who was it God
[52:20] himself came down and went
[52:22] all right
[52:24] so how did he send him God came down and
[52:26] went in him
[52:28] all right how does he send you and I he
[52:31] comes down and goes in US
[52:33] all right now but he said and breathed
[52:37] on him and said receive ye the Holy
[52:38] Ghost
[52:41] now
[52:42] did they get it right there
[52:48] right
[52:50] now over in uh where is it
[52:54] um
[52:56] John 7
[53:00] it talks about when he would sit out of
[53:02] your belly shall rule liver rivers of
[53:04] Living Water
[53:06] did this fake he of the Holy Ghost that
[53:09] had not been given because Jesus had not
[53:12] been glorified
[53:14] all right now here he's glorified right
[53:20] all right he's went through his
[53:22] glorification
[53:24] and he speaks to him
[53:29] did they receive it right there
[53:35] all right now we know the message you
[53:36] know that's not true he didn't receive
[53:38] it to her because that's what the
[53:39] prophet said about it right so let's
[53:41] make sure that there are other internet
[53:42] people can do it and we can read it
[53:44] again here go ahead with number one
[53:46] Brothers on on questions and answers
[53:49] preached
[53:50] in uh 64 I guess it is
[53:54] or 60. go ahead with number one
[53:59] 1964. paragraph 60 and they asked him
[54:02] the question brother Branham what is the
[54:04] difference between what is the
[54:06] difference when Jesus breathed on a
[54:07] disciple and said receive ye the Holy
[54:09] Ghost and when they had to go to the
[54:12] upper room deterior what's the
[54:13] difference he said all right it was a
[54:16] promise he gave them breathed upon them
[54:19] his promise said receive ye the Holy
[54:22] Ghost it was a promise they went to the
[54:25] upper room to wait for the promise to be
[54:28] fulfilled all right
[54:30] so even after his resurrection and even
[54:33] after his glorification and even after
[54:37] his appearing
[54:40] he breathed on them
[54:43] and said receive you the Holy Ghost
[54:47] but it did not come at that time
[54:50] because it was a promise
[54:53] all right aren't we glad we got a
[54:55] prophet to be able to read
[54:57] and that way well I think it means this
[54:59] well Fooly were your thoughts and mine
[55:02] too
[55:04] I think it's time to get away from our
[55:07] thoughts
[55:09] to get down to the message but watch it
[55:11] very carefully now and look at number
[55:13] two now which is taken from the message
[55:15] it becometh us to fulfill all
[55:18] righteousness and look what the prophet
[55:21] has to say about this
[55:23] speaking of this same thing they know
[55:26] that his word that was that he was to
[55:29] send back the Holy Ghost they knowed
[55:31] that was a promise
[55:34] they know that they had to wait up there
[55:37] for it now we're going to read the
[55:38] scriptures to where you're related
[55:40] together they had seen him they knowed
[55:43] he was dead they note he was risen they
[55:46] had seen him therefore they knowed what
[55:48] they were talking about
[55:51] what that they must go and wait
[55:56] right
[55:57] all right
[55:59] so now when it says in John then that
[56:02] when he said he said this he breathed on
[56:04] them
[56:06] and said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[56:09] all right they didn't receive it right
[56:11] then they had to go to the upper room
[56:13] right
[56:15] now let's get this on another
[56:18] time the Lord is explaining it so go
[56:21] ahead with number four bypass 3 because
[56:24] we've read that go to number four Luke
[56:27] 24. and 45.
[56:31] and I want you to think about something
[56:33] this is the same event
[56:37] you know not the same placing Maybe
[56:43] but look at this event as the same thing
[56:46] you would look at the other to where
[56:48] that it was a promise of the Holy Ghost
[56:51] to come now here's where he's giving
[56:53] that promise
[56:55] in his message as he's coming forth you
[56:58] know bringing the message then watch
[57:00] what it said now
[57:02] then open he their understanding
[57:07] no
[57:09] you remember the two disciples on the
[57:11] road to Emmaus he opened their
[57:12] understanding of the word
[57:15] well when he comes back with the
[57:17] disciples he opens their understanding
[57:19] of the word
[57:22] brother Dale always
[57:24] understanding was was a revelation
[57:29] you're running close to a point but
[57:31] you're not close enough
[57:34] it can be your head knowledge that is
[57:36] opened
[57:37] remember the the the little woman there
[57:40] that touched His Garment brother Brown
[57:42] and said she had faith
[57:45] far the time
[57:48] which means she didn't have Holy Ghost
[57:51] Field Born Again experience of faith
[57:55] she had it for that time there
[57:59] amen and if you annihilate this
[58:01] scriptures look where the trouble you're
[58:03] going to because you'll have all of it
[58:05] you know that Moses did not have the
[58:07] baptism with the Holy Ghost right but
[58:09] yet his understanding was opened unto
[58:12] him until he wrote the first five books
[58:15] of the Bible even what happened in
[58:17] Genesis and all of the things he wrote
[58:20] them from the opening of his
[58:22] understanding or what God revealed to
[58:25] him
[58:26] you can get a revelation without the
[58:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[58:30] but it'll be a revelation it will not
[58:33] bring you a new birth just because you
[58:35] do it it didn't bring Moses a new birth
[58:37] about what was dark
[58:39] right
[58:41] now come on think about what we're
[58:43] saying I try to lay it out that way
[58:45] where that it ties together all the
[58:47] scriptures to where you won't just think
[58:49] in some idea so look then open either
[58:52] understanding
[58:56] what
[58:59] that they might understand the
[59:01] scriptures after three and a half years
[59:04] he finally opens her understanding after
[59:07] the resurrection
[59:08] does that give them the new birth
[59:11] no because it tells you down here in a
[59:14] minute right
[59:15] and said unto them thus it is written
[59:18] and thus it behoove Christ to suffer and
[59:20] to rise from the dead the third day
[59:22] remember they didn't know that
[59:25] even after all the years of hearing the
[59:27] Lord Jesus talk about it
[59:30] right
[59:31] they still didn't know it so we opened
[59:34] their understanding of what he had said
[59:36] to them and said in other words it's not
[59:39] written here it is that but if he opened
[59:42] her understanding he said look I've
[59:44] tried for three and a half years to
[59:45] explain what I come into the world for
[59:48] I've come into the world to die I had to
[59:51] do it this way it had to be done this
[59:53] way you didn't understand it you still
[59:56] don't understand it the way you need to
[59:58] understand
[59:59] because come on over in the book of Acts
[1:00:02] after even his Ascension they were still
[1:00:05] talking about
[1:00:08] are you going to restore the Kingdom of
[1:00:09] Israel at this time they still had their
[1:00:12] mind on something Earthly all right now
[1:00:14] there's no hopes
[1:00:16] in Earthly things
[1:00:19] so he had to open their understanding
[1:00:23] of what he had taught to them he didn't
[1:00:25] say reveal it like totally but he opened
[1:00:28] it that he was the one they were
[1:00:30] speaking of when he went down in his
[1:00:33] descending to the spirits in prison he
[1:00:37] opened their understanding that he was
[1:00:40] the woman said that had come and was
[1:00:43] crucified he done it twice there don't
[1:00:45] just tie it to one he went to the people
[1:00:47] that could not be saved open their
[1:00:50] understanding as a witness against them
[1:00:52] right to show who he was he also came by
[1:00:56] and picked up the Old Testament Saints
[1:00:58] and opened their understanding
[1:01:01] of who he was
[1:01:03] one because they didn't know he went
[1:01:05] away all right watch
[1:01:08] and that repentance and remission of sin
[1:01:10] should be preached in his name among all
[1:01:12] nations beginning at Jerusalem and
[1:01:15] you're Witnesses of these things
[1:01:17] and behold I send the promise of my
[1:01:20] father
[1:01:21] what upon you
[1:01:25] know same thing as he done in John when
[1:01:27] he breathed on him and said receive ye
[1:01:29] the Holy Ghost
[1:01:30] but what she stipulates but tarry in the
[1:01:33] city of Jerusalem until you be endured
[1:01:36] with power from online
[1:01:39] now this is all right I'm opening your
[1:01:41] understanding I'm showing you who I am
[1:01:42] I'm letting you know things that the
[1:01:45] world knows nothing about
[1:01:48] but go to the upper room
[1:01:51] all right so when brother Brown said it
[1:01:53] was a promise
[1:01:55] he was exactly scriptural
[1:01:59] because it was a promise that what
[1:02:01] when the Holy Ghost comes he'll open
[1:02:04] could you go over into John Diaries and
[1:02:07] then John where he talks about to
[1:02:08] comforter become and what it would do
[1:02:10] and brain to you remembers whatsoever I
[1:02:13] said
[1:02:14] and even teach you things to come
[1:02:17] are we still in the scripture all right
[1:02:19] but you see then it's a promise
[1:02:23] it's a promise
[1:02:27] that
[1:02:28] they would receive the Holy Ghost
[1:02:32] but then he stipulated
[1:02:34] he didn't say go down in Jericho go out
[1:02:37] on the River Jordan go down there and
[1:02:38] walk around where you've been
[1:02:40] where'd he say
[1:02:44] tear you in the city of Jerusalem
[1:02:51] a place for pirate
[1:02:54] all right
[1:02:56] now you know what they were doing then
[1:02:58] they kind of was in the upper room
[1:03:01] we think about it as being some kind of
[1:03:03] doing but really it's the best thing to
[1:03:04] think of it's my way of thinking about
[1:03:06] it to make it fit all of it they were up
[1:03:08] in an attic probably as far as they
[1:03:09] could go
[1:03:14] because they were told to go wait
[1:03:17] and we'll get to that in a minute where
[1:03:20] yeah
[1:03:21] let's go ahead
[1:03:24] let's go ahead with number
[1:03:25] six I passed five because that's where
[1:03:29] he says for them in the
[1:03:31] in the book of Acts one in six
[1:03:35] but we want to go here and look what the
[1:03:37] prophet says now come down you know this
[1:03:39] took place this is presuming
[1:03:42] he told us to wait up here until we had
[1:03:44] received the promise of the father
[1:03:47] and we was going to receive the Holy
[1:03:49] Ghost
[1:03:50] you remember he raised his hands upon us
[1:03:52] and breathed upon us and said receive ye
[1:03:55] the Holy Ghost yeah
[1:03:58] well I'll tell you brethren
[1:04:00] I believe we got her
[1:04:04] I presume we've got it
[1:04:09] right
[1:04:11] oh you miserable hypocrite
[1:04:14] yeah
[1:04:17] like pretty hard
[1:04:20] see I believe we got it
[1:04:22] I think word accepted by faith
[1:04:25] you know all of these and the stories
[1:04:27] behind all of them did he used in this
[1:04:29] illustration a lot of time and they'll
[1:04:31] say we we've got it let's go out by
[1:04:33] faith we've seen the dead raised we've
[1:04:35] seen this hill we've seen all of this
[1:04:37] let's just take it by faith
[1:04:41] that's a good way of talking because it
[1:04:43] sounds like a lot of us right yeah
[1:04:46] but watch
[1:04:48] I presume we got it I think we ought to
[1:04:50] be to accept it you Baptists
[1:04:54] we're accepted by faith
[1:04:56] by faith nothing
[1:04:59] it's an experience
[1:05:06] well they were in the upper room they
[1:05:07] were all gathered they were all doing
[1:05:09] they were doing exactly what Jesus said
[1:05:10] they were tiring
[1:05:16] well why didn't it well let's just take
[1:05:17] it by faith let's just right now just
[1:05:19] take it
[1:05:22] are you listening or are you texting
[1:05:27] I tell you brethren
[1:05:30] I believe we got it
[1:05:33] we got it
[1:05:36] well brother Dale I believe it by faith
[1:05:40] I believe got the Holy Ghost
[1:05:42] what's the difference back dire and now
[1:05:46] what's the difference
[1:05:49] what's the difference in the people that
[1:05:50] were back there and the people today
[1:05:57] by faith
[1:06:00] you know you got to do that that's good
[1:06:04] you know they were in the upper room
[1:06:05] they were doing good
[1:06:08] they with our things was happening
[1:06:12] you know the prophet said there's no
[1:06:14] Firestone eight days or something you
[1:06:16] know he said one of them said well I
[1:06:17] believe we got it let's go
[1:06:20] but one of them had enough knowledge to
[1:06:22] say
[1:06:28] we evidently don't have what he had
[1:06:34] now you know why
[1:06:36] because he wouldn't have been in the
[1:06:37] upper room hiding
[1:06:40] right
[1:06:41] they were scared to death sitting in the
[1:06:43] upper room hiding
[1:06:45] right
[1:06:47] the big one it jumped up and said I
[1:06:50] believe we got her if I'd have been
[1:06:52] there I said going out the door
[1:06:54] let's see what happens to you yeah
[1:06:57] because I don't believe I got it
[1:07:01] I won't wait here
[1:07:03] but you go on out we'll view through the
[1:07:05] door and see what happens to you because
[1:07:07] you know about that time they were
[1:07:08] hunting for him trying to find them and
[1:07:10] everything else
[1:07:14] but you see we can oh but we got it by
[1:07:17] faith we just take it by faith
[1:07:23] which is it's by faith
[1:07:26] faith is revelation ain't it brother
[1:07:28] Dale yeah but what is that revelation
[1:07:32] now you tell me
[1:07:35] now we're going to make an illustration
[1:07:36] out of this
[1:07:38] after coming into the message and unbean
[1:07:40] it might have been a time that God went
[1:07:41] to the ignorance back behind
[1:07:43] but uh
[1:07:45] it's time to repent
[1:07:47] you mean after you come in the message
[1:07:48] you've been in the message a while and
[1:07:50] then you're just going to tell me you're
[1:07:51] going to take it by faith
[1:07:53] when as much as you've heard of the
[1:07:55] Prophet say and as much as I've tried to
[1:07:57] preach about it it's got to be an
[1:07:59] experience
[1:08:00] it's got to be a revelation
[1:08:03] well now what's God revealed to you
[1:08:09] see that's why folks I'd rather have my
[1:08:11] experience than anybody's experience in
[1:08:13] the world
[1:08:16] now you don't like that that's all right
[1:08:19] you know why because I live through mine
[1:08:21] because that's what an experience means
[1:08:23] something you live through
[1:08:26] I know the quotes where the Prophet said
[1:08:28] to receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost
[1:08:30] without a sensation I know that quote
[1:08:33] I think it's uh Blasphemous names or
[1:08:36] statue of perfect man
[1:08:38] I'm sorry
[1:08:41] there's a lot of difference in
[1:08:42] experience and sensation
[1:08:50] well I I've never got a revelation
[1:08:52] brother that well then you're not born
[1:08:53] again
[1:08:55] yeah but I believe everything the Bible
[1:08:56] said I believe everything the prophet
[1:08:58] said great it's all laying down waiting
[1:09:02] on the Holy Ghost to make it alive
[1:09:04] I read six books listened to two tapes
[1:09:09] I could do that in a day because I had a
[1:09:11] wonderful job
[1:09:13] I've done that for two years
[1:09:16] before I received the baptism of the
[1:09:18] Holy Ghost
[1:09:28] remember the disciples had pretty good
[1:09:30] faith
[1:09:33] they were with him after his
[1:09:34] resurrection
[1:09:37] but remember also that Faith didn't hold
[1:09:40] too good because they wasn't coming out
[1:09:42] of that Upper Room
[1:09:44] but when the Holy Ghost came
[1:09:46] out to win
[1:09:48] right
[1:09:49] they had when the Holy Ghost came what
[1:09:52] he had
[1:09:54] before then they had a mental conception
[1:09:57] of the word call it faith if you like it
[1:10:00] had been open to them who Jesus Christ
[1:10:02] was
[1:10:04] hey come on you remember over to Apollos
[1:10:08] you remember
[1:10:09] over in the book of Acts Paul gets over
[1:10:12] and said have you received the Holy
[1:10:13] Ghost since you believe you remember
[1:10:14] that you remember what they were they
[1:10:18] were Believers in Jesus Christ read the
[1:10:22] book of Acts
[1:10:24] read your Prophet those that Apollos was
[1:10:27] talking to were Believers in Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ
[1:10:33] they were teaching by the scriptures
[1:10:37] that he was the Christ read the book of
[1:10:39] Acts
[1:10:42] but see they didn't know he'd even died
[1:10:46] they didn't know he had died and
[1:10:47] Resurrected
[1:10:48] read your Bible so Paul explains to him
[1:10:54] and when he does
[1:10:56] then the Holy Ghost falls on him
[1:10:59] then they had an experience
[1:11:01] or a revelation now what I mean by
[1:11:04] Revelation I don't mean that you've got
[1:11:07] to say well I just got this great
[1:11:08] Revelation I believe I got to New Birth
[1:11:10] well remember it might be that or it
[1:11:12] might be your understanding open
[1:11:18] which one is it
[1:11:20] if it's Revelation you're willing to
[1:11:24] stand before the world and Proclaim your
[1:11:27] Revelation put it on internet and
[1:11:29] announce to the world show me something
[1:11:32] contrary than what I've taught for 50
[1:11:35] years almost of the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:38] Ghost in what the New Birth really is
[1:11:40] the birth of the word
[1:11:43] and as the prophet said a revelation
[1:11:46] of Jesus Christ personally to you watch
[1:11:49] him now but yeah but how do you get
[1:11:51] these big Revelations
[1:11:53] would you explain to me in the Christ of
[1:11:56] mystery where he's just explained what
[1:11:57] the new birth is it's a revelation
[1:11:59] personally to you about Jesus Christ and
[1:12:02] he said the most illiterate person
[1:12:05] that's right
[1:12:08] could be born again
[1:12:13] now get it out of your mind then all
[1:12:16] about this or brother you're talking
[1:12:17] about so many great Revelation you have
[1:12:19] to have this Revelation and that
[1:12:20] revelation God have this revelation God
[1:12:24] the most illiterate person
[1:12:29] now come on
[1:12:34] if it's the most illiterate person it's
[1:12:36] not no great big thing right
[1:12:38] but remember the other day what little
[1:12:40] bit God reveals you is a great big thing
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:44] if it's one word it's a great thing
[1:12:48] the most illiterate person could receive
[1:12:50] that Jesus Christ died for their sins
[1:12:53] that's Bible open to that person and
[1:12:57] they can be born again by that
[1:12:59] what's the matter with us
[1:13:02] I try to bring something out to you and
[1:13:04] all it runs into is something you think
[1:13:05] we've got to have this great intellect
[1:13:07] we've got to have then
[1:13:09] well come on we've been around you long
[1:13:11] enough why don't we want to intellect
[1:13:16] right
[1:13:17] why do you not want to know about God
[1:13:19] even it's just intellectual
[1:13:24] I thought we were bro here to as
[1:13:26] children of God to study about God I
[1:13:28] didn't know it was to study about the
[1:13:29] world and the Affairs and the things
[1:13:34] I thought it was to study God's word
[1:13:43] listen
[1:13:48] have you received
[1:13:50] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:53] since you believed
[1:13:56] after coming in this message and
[1:13:58] believing it he received the Holy Ghost
[1:14:00] called Remember
[1:14:04] of what I taught
[1:14:07] you're born again at Faith I don't care
[1:14:10] who you are Prophet priest king brother
[1:14:13] Brown was born again at Faith
[1:14:15] all right
[1:14:17] just because he was a prophet didn't put
[1:14:18] him up here
[1:14:20] he had to grow in Grace and knowledge
[1:14:22] even the Lord Jesus groaned in Grace and
[1:14:24] knowledge
[1:14:25] all right
[1:14:27] so if you're born again at Faith
[1:14:28] wonderful
[1:14:29] but then we got to grow upward
[1:14:33] in him
[1:14:34] I'll listen the other day to my own
[1:14:36] message thinking about thinking where
[1:14:38] brother Brown said Paul stayed with his
[1:14:40] convert and I thought Lord that's a good
[1:14:42] point I'm glad I made it
[1:14:44] you remember the other day
[1:14:46] Paul if he got his convert born again he
[1:14:50] stayed with him and taught him the
[1:14:51] virtues
[1:14:53] if he didn't get borned again when he
[1:14:55] first started he stayed with him until
[1:14:56] he got born again then he could teach
[1:14:58] him the virtues
[1:15:00] I thought Lord thank you for that
[1:15:04] but listen
[1:15:07] can you see
[1:15:10] that when he breathed on them
[1:15:15] that
[1:15:17] it was not the new birth
[1:15:22] but yet putting to others with Luke it
[1:15:25] would be an opening of the scriptures
[1:15:31] of their understanding
[1:15:34] of who he was and what he done and what
[1:15:36] had happened
[1:15:39] but then he would still tell them you
[1:15:41] got to go to the upper room
[1:15:46] and wait
[1:15:52] what do you think about that
[1:15:56] brother Dale I've never heard nothing
[1:15:58] the way you talk you talk about the New
[1:16:01] Birth is a revelation will you tell me
[1:16:03] what it is
[1:16:06] that's what your Prophet said now you
[1:16:08] tell me what it is of some other way
[1:16:15] whenever one of us is different I don't
[1:16:18] have nothing to do with it every one of
[1:16:19] us was born somewhere
[1:16:21] might have been at home might have been
[1:16:23] a hospital might have been a pig pen
[1:16:24] might have been anything but a birth is
[1:16:26] a mess
[1:16:27] and every one of us come what water
[1:16:30] blood and life and even if you want to
[1:16:34] go with the cesareans you're still going
[1:16:37] to get water and blood and life
[1:16:43] so then all new births
[1:16:47] no matter what age you're in did I give
[1:16:49] it to you where the Prophet said the
[1:16:51] Holy Ghost was in every age
[1:16:55] did I give it to him where he said
[1:16:56] everybody had the same experience
[1:17:02] what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:04] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[1:17:05] with the word right
[1:17:09] that was so mistought until he had it as
[1:17:13] love and thanks and he said the Holy
[1:17:16] Spirit straightened him out in a vision
[1:17:18] see it had to do with receiving the word
[1:17:22] do you see what's wrong with the people
[1:17:23] of the message today why they're just
[1:17:25] falling away churches people preachers
[1:17:28] the worst of all it's just falling away
[1:17:37] what's the matter
[1:17:40] because they can't stay in the word
[1:17:46] you mean to tell me that the Holy Ghost
[1:17:48] is
[1:17:49] will differ with the word
[1:17:52] that's right
[1:17:55] you see why I'm not afraid to tell the
[1:17:57] internet world what I believe
[1:17:59] because I got scripture
[1:18:03] I've got the quotes of the Prophet I've
[1:18:06] got 40 Years of preaching it
[1:18:09] you think I'm afraid for somebody to
[1:18:11] some
[1:18:12] ignorant ignoramus come along to try to
[1:18:15] convince me that the new birth is
[1:18:17] something different
[1:18:21] you say well you shouldn't talk that
[1:18:22] away will I try not to be too nasty I
[1:18:25] could say it a whole lot worse I tried
[1:18:28] to get away from that dumb and stupid
[1:18:29] stuff you know that Josiah got on to me
[1:18:31] about years ago let me saying I've tried
[1:18:38] but I still remember what brother Brown
[1:18:40] said
[1:18:41] he said if you make it easy they'll
[1:18:43] think you try and pull something over on
[1:18:45] them
[1:18:46] who said if you make it hard that at
[1:18:49] least don't think you're trying to pull
[1:18:49] something over on them at least you know
[1:18:51] where I stand but you know where I stood
[1:18:54] for 40 something years behind this
[1:18:57] Pulpit declaring the new birth
[1:19:00] and still today declaring and that birth
[1:19:03] is unfolding today more than it ever has
[1:19:05] in my life
[1:19:09] because it's tying together with all of
[1:19:12] the scriptures and the things that the
[1:19:14] prophet has taught and I don't have to
[1:19:16] deny anything he says
[1:19:19] but still get back to my point now
[1:19:21] because I want you
[1:19:24] he breathed upon him and said receive ye
[1:19:26] the Holy Ghost
[1:19:28] now that's a promise right
[1:19:30] all right now you would you like to hear
[1:19:32] that promise again in the Bible
[1:19:35] to another group of people
[1:19:38] the same promise
[1:19:42] that you're going to have to wait you're
[1:19:43] going to have to do this you're going to
[1:19:45] have to do that it's going to this is
[1:19:47] going to happen the understanding is
[1:19:48] going to be open and then the Holy Ghost
[1:19:51] is going to come
[1:19:54] how about it
[1:19:56] go ahead brother with Ezekiel I was
[1:19:59] going to read this scripture and start
[1:20:01] with and we still may use it this
[1:20:02] evening but I'd like for you to think
[1:20:05] about these things
[1:20:08] and that first of all I would like for
[1:20:10] you to listen to uh restoration of the
[1:20:13] Bride tree
[1:20:15] because in that restoration of the Bride
[1:20:17] tree brother random covers
[1:20:19] four messengers of death
[1:20:22] to destroy the tree and four messengers
[1:20:25] of life
[1:20:27] now you've got to be real careful
[1:20:30] because remember life comes in the third
[1:20:32] stage and that's what we're getting to
[1:20:35] what we're talking about but in that in
[1:20:37] restoration life comes in the fourth
[1:20:39] stage
[1:20:44] so let's get what is going on and read
[1:20:46] it
[1:20:48] so Ezekiel 37 he said again he said unto
[1:20:51] me prophesy upon these bones
[1:20:55] and say unto them oh you dry bones hear
[1:20:58] the word of the Lord now who is this
[1:20:59] this is Ezekiel to Israel right
[1:21:03] Ezekiel to Israel
[1:21:05] right
[1:21:07] now what do we get to that in a minute
[1:21:08] for this evening one of the two
[1:21:12] thus saith the Lord this is what he's to
[1:21:15] say
[1:21:18] he said unto me prophesy
[1:21:20] all right thus saith the Lord
[1:21:24] unto these bones
[1:21:26] behold I will cause breath
[1:21:29] to enter into you
[1:21:32] and you shall live
[1:21:36] now remember this is God telling him
[1:21:38] what to do down here he'll tell how it
[1:21:40] happened okay
[1:21:42] follow it
[1:21:44] watch and I should call breaths
[1:21:48] cause breath to enter into you and you
[1:21:50] shall live
[1:21:51] and I'll lay seniors upon you and will
[1:21:54] bring up flesh upon you and cover you
[1:21:57] with skin and put breath in you and you
[1:21:59] shall live and you shall know that I am
[1:22:02] the Lord
[1:22:06] the same four stages that goes with the
[1:22:09] restoration of the Bride tree
[1:22:11] four bugs eat it down four brings it
[1:22:14] back justification sanctification the
[1:22:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:19] and then the word
[1:22:22] right
[1:22:24] so read restoration the bride tree and
[1:22:25] listen to what I'm talking about so
[1:22:27] that's what he said now cause breath to
[1:22:29] enter into you and you shall live now
[1:22:30] watch him
[1:22:31] I lay sin you number one
[1:22:36] upon you
[1:22:38] and bring flesh upon you
[1:22:40] number two
[1:22:43] and cover your skin number three
[1:22:46] but deflection is getting on
[1:22:49] if you don't believe that bring up here
[1:22:51] I'll whack it and you can look inside
[1:22:52] and you'll find a some skin some flesh
[1:22:55] inside and some skin outside
[1:22:58] right
[1:23:01] oh well it's all just can
[1:23:04] but look that still don't do it it says
[1:23:07] and put breath in you and you shall live
[1:23:10] and you shall know that I am the Lord
[1:23:13] that's the promise to Israel of
[1:23:16] restoration
[1:23:18] after we leave out of here right
[1:23:22] They will receive this message not from
[1:23:25] Brother Branham and not from the bride
[1:23:27] as people want to make it they'll
[1:23:29] receive it from the two prophets which
[1:23:31] are Jews according to the prophet
[1:23:33] because they won't hear nobody else but
[1:23:34] Jews so don't get no Gentiles involved
[1:23:38] this is going to Israel
[1:23:41] even I got a little sense Elijah was a
[1:23:44] gentile but when this Prophet comes in
[1:23:46] the end time he ain't gonna be no
[1:23:47] Gentile
[1:23:49] this Prophet to you and I as a gentile
[1:23:51] but to profit to them is going to be a
[1:23:53] Jew brother Brown said two Jews I had
[1:23:57] that out a long time ago with the people
[1:23:58] I think we're going to stay why are we
[1:24:00] not going to stay what brother Brown
[1:24:01] said
[1:24:02] well I think maybe you don't think
[1:24:04] brother that's what a man told me
[1:24:05] sitting across the table up at blew more
[1:24:07] of what it was in Gainesville
[1:24:09] oh eating place he said you don't think
[1:24:12] that could be a gentile prophet and a
[1:24:14] gentile bride I knew immediately that
[1:24:17] who he was talking about you know who
[1:24:19] he's talking about wouldn't brother
[1:24:21] Brandon he was talking about himself and
[1:24:24] a gentile bride
[1:24:26] I looked across the table I said quote
[1:24:29] page number of the seal book brother
[1:24:30] Brown said it would be two Jews
[1:24:34] well he didn't talk to me no more
[1:24:36] because I was an illiterate I was a you
[1:24:38] know an underdog that had no Revelation
[1:24:40] well I still stay with the prophet you
[1:24:43] know okay
[1:24:45] but now look
[1:24:49] I'll they send you upon you
[1:24:53] I'll bring up flesh upon you cover your
[1:24:55] skin and then I'll breathe in you
[1:24:58] the four stages
[1:25:02] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:25:05] of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:08] and then the word
[1:25:09] same thing all right watch roll it up
[1:25:12] just a little bit now remember this is
[1:25:14] what God told him to do okay
[1:25:17] and told him what would happen now watch
[1:25:19] it so I prophesied as I was commanded
[1:25:24] and as I prophesied there was a noise
[1:25:26] and behold the shaken
[1:25:28] and the bones came together
[1:25:30] bone to his bone
[1:25:33] you remember that song Dem Bones Them
[1:25:35] Bones them dry bones
[1:25:39] and when I be held low the sinews and
[1:25:43] the flesh Came Upon them
[1:25:44] and the skin covered them above
[1:25:48] then word over it top fixing it
[1:25:51] but there was no breath in them
[1:25:59] that's what your Bible says
[1:26:02] then said he unto me
[1:26:11] prophesying
[1:26:13] how does the breath come
[1:26:16] on I want to say a little bit on backup
[1:26:17] I ain't gonna say a whole lot now this
[1:26:19] is a seed
[1:26:21] when Jesus breathed on them and I know
[1:26:24] the message I've looked up a lot of
[1:26:26] things so don't worry about it
[1:26:28] you just listen
[1:26:30] did Jesus go
[1:26:35] receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:26:43] or did he say
[1:26:46] receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:26:52] you remember I said something the other
[1:26:54] day and I told you to go home and try it
[1:26:55] how many went home and tried it
[1:26:57] I've told you I wasn't going to do it
[1:26:59] here if we're going to be going to be
[1:27:00] embarrassing and so maybe we wouldn't
[1:27:01] want to do it
[1:27:04] but you remember what I told you the
[1:27:05] other day I said turn around take a
[1:27:07] possession back part of your hand cut a
[1:27:08] filter and and just talk to the back
[1:27:11] part of your hand
[1:27:14] and you feel
[1:27:15] are coming out
[1:27:19] right
[1:27:21] amen
[1:27:25] the same hours coming out
[1:27:27] as it would if you went
[1:27:38] which one took place back there and
[1:27:40] which one's going to take place to
[1:27:41] Israel
[1:27:44] sure he breathed
[1:27:46] but his breath was the word of God
[1:27:51] amen think on that a little bit
[1:27:54] don't blow it off it's some thing
[1:27:57] something brother Dale thought of
[1:27:58] because I woke up in the middle of the
[1:28:01] night breathing on the back of my hand
[1:28:03] and I started weeping
[1:28:11] I was just breathing
[1:28:15] but the back of my hand was feeling it
[1:28:19] I ask you the question while ago when we
[1:28:21] started
[1:28:23] the puppy dog can whine when it's born
[1:28:28] and it never learns to talk
[1:28:32] yet they can train them in time so they
[1:28:34] said something to that
[1:28:36] they even say words right
[1:28:40] but the baby comes into the world crying
[1:28:42] it's the same way the dog was whining
[1:28:45] but then the baby learn us to talk
[1:28:51] right
[1:28:55] what makes it words that I'm saying
[1:29:03] automatically I must breathe
[1:29:07] right
[1:29:09] and I'm breathing out not breathing in
[1:29:11] now I can breathe in and out while I'm
[1:29:12] talking so that's not no worry all right
[1:29:18] but when you're speaking air is going
[1:29:21] across your vocal cords
[1:29:23] now you explain to me how that works
[1:29:27] why did this not make a sound when I go
[1:29:32] the air is going across the same vocal
[1:29:34] cords
[1:29:45] but yet I turn around and I don't have
[1:29:47] to go
[1:29:48] let me build it up hey folks
[1:29:55] I just start saying words
[1:29:59] but you know I'm saying words the dog
[1:30:01] can't say
[1:30:03] oh yeah they can train them come on
[1:30:05] we'll get off of it too you know they
[1:30:07] don't have a soul and they're not
[1:30:09] dealing with that
[1:30:11] who's speaking when it comes out as
[1:30:14] words
[1:30:22] remember as it is the fact that you
[1:30:25] don't see with your eyes
[1:30:29] right
[1:30:32] come on
[1:30:33] you don't see with your eyes right
[1:30:37] come on medically speaking you don't see
[1:30:39] it with your eyes
[1:30:41] you see from that inner being that you
[1:30:44] are
[1:30:48] see that inner being that you are is
[1:30:51] what speaks words
[1:30:58] all right
[1:31:00] they may not mean a thing to you
[1:31:06] but we'll get a little more maybe it
[1:31:08] might turn around and do something
[1:31:14] I think this Israel they'll be standing
[1:31:16] one day they'll they're in their lands
[1:31:18] now and they'll begin to hear the
[1:31:20] message and they'll begin to see that
[1:31:22] Jesus Christ 144 000 not all of them and
[1:31:25] they'll begin to see that Jesus Christ
[1:31:27] is almighty God
[1:31:30] but they still need one more thing
[1:31:37] their eyes can be
[1:31:40] old he did to the disciples
[1:31:43] but they're still needed the baptism of
[1:31:46] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:51] Watch what it says then he said unto me
[1:31:54] prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of
[1:31:58] man
[1:31:59] and say to the wind
[1:32:03] thus saith the Lord God
[1:32:05] come from the Four Winds o breath
[1:32:09] and breathe upon the slain
[1:32:12] that they may live
[1:32:17] well tell the wind to come blowing
[1:32:19] you're coming here's a wind blow to cry
[1:32:25] are you listening
[1:32:32] when he done what he was told to do life
[1:32:35] comes into Israel watch him
[1:32:39] so I prophesied he commanded me and the
[1:32:43] breath came into them and they lived and
[1:32:46] stood upon their feet and exceeding
[1:32:49] great Army
[1:32:52] same identical thing that was existing
[1:32:55] with the disciples when the Lord Jesus
[1:32:57] met him
[1:33:00] or had them there and said
[1:33:02] receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:33:06] as I said was it necessarily him blowing
[1:33:11] or was it what he said
[1:33:15] because either way the Irish coming out
[1:33:20] either way it's
[1:33:22] her
[1:33:25] he had to speak our being in the
[1:33:29] presence
[1:33:34] I thought we believed in spiritual
[1:33:36] multiplication
[1:33:39] I thought we believed it was necessary
[1:33:41] for a preacher to preach
[1:33:47] whether you like the object that's
[1:33:48] speaking to you or whether you care or
[1:33:51] that's between you and God
[1:33:54] listen to the dumb donkey
[1:33:57] he'll help you
[1:34:02] what I am is between me and God
[1:34:05] not you and God
[1:34:09] you just listen to the words
[1:34:12] if I die and go to hell that don't mean
[1:34:14] you've got to follow me
[1:34:17] that means you listen to what say it
[1:34:20] because I'm going to say it whether you
[1:34:23] like it or not because you're not going
[1:34:24] to get it without somebody speaking it
[1:34:27] to you
[1:34:28] go do what you want to
[1:34:30] I'll read myself go ahead women I've
[1:34:32] been through this I've been it with
[1:34:34] sisters and things that said we don't
[1:34:36] need a preacher
[1:34:39] but anytime they had a baby to be
[1:34:41] dedicated they wanted to call me and
[1:34:44] when they had somebody was sick they
[1:34:46] wanted to call me
[1:34:50] and they wanted weddings done they
[1:34:51] wanted to call me
[1:34:53] but they didn't need no preacher
[1:34:57] and I was nice and I went and done what
[1:34:59] they asked
[1:35:04] but you see it don't make me nothing
[1:35:11] we're back up doing this this evening a
[1:35:13] little bit to get it
[1:35:15] but now remember who was doing the
[1:35:18] talking
[1:35:19] said Son of Man
[1:35:22] prophesy
[1:35:27] you see folks this message came in the
[1:35:29] end time from a man's lips
[1:35:31] the word of almighty God
[1:35:39] came from a man's lips
[1:35:42] the Lord Jesus had to say what he said
[1:35:45] or they would have never been a New
[1:35:46] Birth come into being
[1:35:50] he preached to him for three and a half
[1:35:52] years
[1:35:53] breathing on them
[1:35:57] speaking his words coming from his vocal
[1:36:00] cords coming from that inside man that's
[1:36:02] inside of him that we call a soul
[1:36:07] who's speaking today
[1:36:09] a soul
[1:36:19] what you see
[1:36:22] Jesus had to speak them into existence
[1:36:31] he had to speak their birth into a place
[1:36:35] that they could receive it
[1:36:41] it received that new birth
[1:36:44] and it was what the birth of the word
[1:36:49] did he have to
[1:36:51] well that ain't working
[1:36:58] I'm not arguing with you if you want to
[1:37:00] say he did that ain't got nothing to do
[1:37:02] with it
[1:37:04] now you ain't even listening you're just
[1:37:06] arguing whether he did do that I got
[1:37:08] word of prophet said he breathed on
[1:37:10] well Glory Hallelujah
[1:37:13] so have I
[1:37:17] would have also got the entire Bible to
[1:37:19] back up what took place and we'll take
[1:37:21] place to Israel that the Lord Jesus
[1:37:24] stood there after all the opening of
[1:37:26] their understanding after all the things
[1:37:28] he had done after his resurrection
[1:37:34] and he breathed on them disciples and
[1:37:36] said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:37:38] but he was telling them the same thing
[1:37:40] Luke said he was telling him all right
[1:37:42] you got it you open the word it's here
[1:37:44] now go to the upper room and wait
[1:37:47] until the Holy Ghost comes
[1:37:50] Israel is in their Homeland
[1:37:53] it's a mighty nation
[1:37:58] all we got to do is get out of here as a
[1:38:00] gentile bride and God goes to Israel
[1:38:05] and you know what they go through the
[1:38:07] same experience you and I have
[1:38:12] the only difference is they'll never be
[1:38:15] bride
[1:38:17] they just come up as servants
[1:38:19] even though they go through
[1:38:21] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:38:24] of the Holy Ghost and the opening of the
[1:38:26] word
[1:38:29] do you see why it takes a prophet
[1:38:33] you see why Prophet had to come
[1:38:35] because who was going to speak to this
[1:38:37] Gentile dispensation
[1:38:42] the Lord Jesus spoke back there which
[1:38:44] was basically to the Jews right
[1:38:48] now about the opening of the door of the
[1:38:49] Gentiles to Peter that still didn't
[1:38:51] bring it all in did it
[1:38:53] because remember your Shadrach Meshach
[1:38:56] and Abednego to make it tonight you
[1:38:59] worry about putting the names our
[1:39:01] but he appeared to Israel he appeared to
[1:39:05] the Samaritans
[1:39:08] which was Hive to you in high Gentile
[1:39:10] but he never appeared to the Gentiles as
[1:39:13] in his life
[1:39:15] to do they came in to where he was at
[1:39:18] yeah and they touched His Garment and
[1:39:20] they heard the word but yet he told them
[1:39:22] he said this is not for you
[1:39:27] he had to wait until the Peter opened
[1:39:29] the door to the Gentiles
[1:39:31] and then when the door was opened to the
[1:39:33] Gentiles
[1:39:35] you know
[1:39:36] we were able to come in
[1:39:39] didn't it become a gentile dispensation
[1:39:43] but in that Gentile dispensation there
[1:39:45] was never a manifestation of God to the
[1:39:48] Gentiles other than opening the door the
[1:39:52] Messiah never came he came to the Jews
[1:39:54] came to his own his own received and not
[1:39:56] as many as receiving gave you power to
[1:39:57] become the sons of God is that Bible
[1:39:59] that he went to the Samaritans which was
[1:40:01] the woman at the well
[1:40:03] yep
[1:40:06] but he never went to the Gentiles in an
[1:40:09] Earthly Ministry so he had to come in
[1:40:11] the end time through a prophet
[1:40:13] what do you think I'm talking about
[1:40:15] Ezekiel is the one that spoke life into
[1:40:19] Israel
[1:40:24] when he speaks to Israel in the end
[1:40:26] times it'll be the word of God and it'll
[1:40:28] bring life to them
[1:40:32] well you thanks had been taking place
[1:40:34] all of these 40-something years that
[1:40:36] we've heard the message of the hour
[1:40:39] you don't listen to those tapes as being
[1:40:41] the voice of God
[1:40:44] well I'm listening see what is right or
[1:40:46] wrong I caught him that caught him wrong
[1:40:47] he he said something other day is wrong
[1:40:50] Glory Hallelujah for your little Petey
[1:40:53] Patty
[1:40:59] but you see why Church
[1:41:01] sometimes you walk alone
[1:41:07] with what you believe
[1:41:15] but don't you see what this Prophet has
[1:41:17] done we'll pick it up this evening
[1:41:20] look what he done look what he's still
[1:41:21] doing
[1:41:23] people are still receiving this message
[1:41:24] right
[1:41:25] why would it be called in the days of
[1:41:28] the what
[1:41:30] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:41:39] I thought we believe that the new birth
[1:41:42] came through the body
[1:41:47] right
[1:41:49] I thought somebody had to plant a seed
[1:41:52] for the new birth to be able to take
[1:41:53] place
[1:41:54] that's what I thought
[1:42:00] you see what a preacher is supposed to
[1:42:01] be doing then
[1:42:04] but oh I can just see people
[1:42:07] if you stand up there and you talk and
[1:42:09] you preach and you pour out your heart
[1:42:14] and you talk about born by the Breath of
[1:42:16] God as we'll get to more this evening
[1:42:18] and you talk about brother Branham and I
[1:42:20] think
[1:42:21] and then one day it'll quick unto you
[1:42:24] maybe when you're there
[1:42:27] listening and you'll say
[1:42:29] you know that's what God's been doing
[1:42:32] he's been breathing on us
[1:42:35] his word
[1:42:39] well how can we hear without a preacher
[1:42:41] now can he preach unless he be sent
[1:42:44] that's all right go ahead get it on your
[1:42:46] own do on your own
[1:42:58] if the prophet had not come
[1:43:00] they would not have been a gentile bride
[1:43:03] in the last days
[1:43:05] because he had to speak her into
[1:43:06] existence right
[1:43:08] the Lord Jesus literally spoke us into
[1:43:11] existence
[1:43:13] when he breathed and said receive ye the
[1:43:15] Holy Ghost he literally spoke the entire
[1:43:17] bride into existence
[1:43:24] right
[1:43:28] right but the thing of it was it had to
[1:43:29] come to a gentile prophet in the last
[1:43:31] days because you would have to have your
[1:43:35] Valley of the dry bones to be
[1:43:37] topping the bride of Christ
[1:43:41] and they had seen you
[1:43:43] that skin a flesh and that skin
[1:43:47] and in the head life
[1:43:51] the four stages of the bug that ate us
[1:43:53] down canker worm Palm worm Locus and
[1:43:55] caterpillar
[1:43:58] by the Breath of God in his word he has
[1:44:02] promised us that will be restored
[1:44:07] and he's already come through
[1:44:09] justification
[1:44:11] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:44:13] Holy Ghost
[1:44:15] and then the word is here spoken by the
[1:44:18] end time prophet
[1:44:21] actually that way
[1:44:23] I put all my confidence in whether or
[1:44:25] not he was the right man
[1:44:28] because if he wasn't the right man we
[1:44:30] better find somebody that's got a
[1:44:32] message
[1:44:33] we ain't got long
[1:44:36] we better be hunting a message well I'm
[1:44:39] going out here I'm going to try they'll
[1:44:41] told me to I'm gonna go see who's got
[1:44:42] shines and wonders I didn't say that
[1:44:45] that's anointing
[1:44:48] find out who's got the message
[1:44:53] thank you
[1:44:55] you see that's why I've never been one
[1:44:57] to try to make people or try to convince
[1:44:59] them to come to this church
[1:45:02] and I never tried to run nobody off
[1:45:06] I've always left it up to every
[1:45:08] individual to make up your own mind
[1:45:15] and to decide whether or not it's word
[1:45:21] yeah but brother Dale I just feel so
[1:45:22] much better when other preaching
[1:45:26] I do too
