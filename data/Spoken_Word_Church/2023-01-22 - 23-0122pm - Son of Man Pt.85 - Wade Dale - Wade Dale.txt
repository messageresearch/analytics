shut and when it's shut there's nothing else anybody can do father will be in the ark and you'll take us home Lord just forgive us of our sins and our thoughts that are contrary to you in Jesus name we pray amen Son of Man part something we'll just say 86 at the moment when you get up into those big numbers it's okay it just helps people track what sermon that you're on so that's okay I think brother Donnie is only like 254 or so so so 85 oh okay so in the beginning was the word worms with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth he maybe said you know there's nobody can say that but us do you think for one moment that that day beheld his glory as he was here on the face of the Earth he was a human being he was he that he was a common man a lot of people didn't even know who he was uh the twelve that was with him still had questions in their mind so we beheld his glory we actually are the only people on the face of the Earth that know his full Glory we're the only ones that know his full potential we're the only ones that know his character to the degree of having that headstone come back into this church into the people and give us rapturing Faith that's what we're heading to we're heading to Rapture in faith all right so as we're heading to Rapture and Faith then we got to get up there somewhere we got to get there somewhere somehow somewhere we ought to get there and we're now looking at the word acknowledge we see that knowledge is a two this is two uh sides of the story you got a tree of life and you got the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil we talked about this morning where is the Tree of Life the tree of life is inside your soul if you're born again today you have the tree of life and you're feeding from that brother Brown said we're feeding down the body word of the son of man which why that was word made flesh he told him to eat my flesh and drink my blood that's exactly what we're doing but we know what we're doing we know we're not eating the physical body and we're not eating drinking the physical flesh as a representation next Sunday we'll be taking communion and um that's what we'll be doing but we'll know in our mind why we're doing it we're taking the wine and we're taking the bread as a symbol and he said do this until I come back amen so we know one thing's for sure we're going to keep doing it till he gets back all right we're going to do what the word says we're going to do what it tells us to do in our communion all right and in Isaiah 53 says by his knowledge so we're not looking at our knowledge as we were talking about this morning our knowledge is over here our knowledge is like way over here and his knowledge is like way over there because he said go aways are not my ways your thoughts are not my thoughts he didn't say you might have one two or three little bit ones he said no my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways so we need to wait keep our ways or take his that's what I thought we're going to take his way now look in John 8 verse 31 Jesus said look he said those that believed on him if you continue in my word and that's what we're doing now we're continuing in the word of God it should be a continuous as we were talking about this morning a continuous revelation of the word of God if you continue my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth now that word no comes from the word knowledge knowledge is to know all right and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now that was a group of people though that was in the Bible that Jesus said Jesus said ah they'll come to me in that day and say have I not cast out Devils have I not done these Mighty works and we've done it in your name and he said depart from me I never knew you now that word no and new is used in the Jewish language is intimate relationship or where Adam knew Eve in other words making love all right that's what Jesus is telling me he said look you might have known who I was intellectually but you never had an experience with me to become my bride you never were my bride you you I give you a chance to be and you did these Mighty works but you didn't go on down into that throne room and let me in you were just anointed by a spirit let's please let's don't be anointed by that kind of a spirit amen let us continue on and as brother Dale's always said we need to every day say Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost give me the Holy Ghost if I don't have the Holy Ghost please give me the Holy Ghost I want the Holy Ghost Lord you I want him he's not going to get tired of that you know what he's tired of he's tired of the people says well I got it but I ain't got to do everything you say Lord I'll just do us every once in a while I'll get some of this out of uh you know I'll pull the book out every once in a while and I'll listen to tape every once in a while that's not what he wants he wants us to be what's be children be sons of daughters of God start that way start as a child but I speak as a child Paul said but now what I put away those childish things um it'd be kind of it'd be kind of awful for us to go to your house and go to Donny's house and and look in the floor and there's there's Jonas be going but Donnie what are you playing with Legos for bro daddy why you got hot wheel cars out on the ain't nothing wrong with Hot Wheel cars but that but I used to do that but that's been put away that's those childish things to be put away I want those hot wheel cars to be real big cars and I won't have that 57 Chevrolet in that all those different things you know that we get now as you get older guess what same way in God we do start by playing you don't know what you're doing we start by playing don't I don't have an idea what's going on but as we get older and get older and get older guess what we start figuring life out just a little bit that's the same way with God if you'll just stay here stay under the fountain listen to the word of God listen to the preachers listen to your elders and listen to brother Bynum on his tape then guess what something good is going to happen it's when we quit doing those things it's when we quit and stop and leave church and nobody don't love me no more nobody don't care about me and and you know brother Danny didn't shake my hand didn't even look at me today sorry it's all right with him he knows all right with him but that's the way we get we get all these feelings involved amen that's why Satan went after Eve and not Adam was the man Adam had the not more intelligence than a woman okay okay sisters y'all should have said amen and clap but it wasn't that he was she was you know less dumb no she had emotion and feelings and Satan knew that he could feel that and he knew that if I can just get to her and get to her emotion I'll turn her away now don't you think he's slick he's slick now doing the same identical thing if I can just get the get get the emotional part to override everything else then I got him that's what he did with the church that's what he did in Isaiah he took them they went to nicia and took a false Doctrine the bride brother rammsted went to nicaea and tried their best to turn the people back but it didn't happen it wasn't time it was time for this Joel 2 25 for the tree to be eaten down the bride tree was eaten down almost to a stump but listen I will restore and that's God not the man I will restore to you the years the Locust eat caterpillar canker worm Pummel were in my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God you know today it's The Darkest Day Darkest Hour that ever been but you know we can eat better than anybody ever that's naturally and spiritually we got restaurants everywhere one more time everywhere amen and we can eat and plenty but so do we have the word of God in our access we got it in our hand we got it in our watch now we got it in our car we've got it everywhere we need it we've got access to the word of God and what are we doing about it we shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed Isaiah 28 says Whom Shall he teach knowledge me that's a question Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine who's he talking to he's talking to me he might be talking to you but he's talking to me then that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast in other words we come to it a stage of where we come into adoption when we come to fullness will we come to where we eat meat instead of eating the carrying of the world and the junk that this world feeds us everybody with me amen you can amen anytime you want to really ain't gonna bother me a bit I want to read something that I got that I had on this one that I had didn't read this morning talking about revelation and I want to read this right here real quick I didn't get to it right here we were talking about Revelation and brother Brown talks about needing Revelation more than anything else in the world watch him continuation in Revelation and Jesus Christ the program said no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted listen to this now he's not finished we have accepted the Bible we know it's true we have accepted the great truths of it absolutely but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there I don't want us to be intellectual Giants I want us to be revelated Giants because listen you can quote all you want to but when it's deep down inside and it comes from God Satan has to back up and you know what remember I wrote read your quote several weeks ago Satan is the biggest bluffer there is so if you start blessing him he knows when you're blessing so he just goes but when he knows you're not bluffing when he met Jesus Christ the three times after the Wilderness Journey when after Jesus was in the wilderness in those three times he tempted him he knew he was not talking to a normal person all right why he said it is and all he said was it is written he didn't jump up down and shout and preached a 25 or 30 minute sermon he said it's written that you shall not tempt the Lord thy God but look it's still not real to most people because we're not there the second Corinthians 5 21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our Union with Jesus Christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of God himself that's what I want us to get to know this year please you are the righteousness of God through Jesus Christ by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but became sin for us that our Union with him we might become the righteousness of God if we accept the fact look and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we are by our Union with him have become the very righteousness of God I want you to read this with me read it with me to reject one is to reject the other to accept the one is to accept the other all right that's your choice today now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing wow that's a prophet back in 1961 but the revelation of it is missing it is not real to the majority of God's children he didn't say God's mature children he didn't say God's adults he said God's children it is just a good verse in the Bible but we need to have it made alive to us that will take a revelation to make it alive to us for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age even those look who by reason of use the Bible says to what exercise your faith even those who by reason of use have their senses senses memories and conscious effects and Imagination remember there's only two there's only one or the other in your souls that's Faith or doubt right who have reasons by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil you saw that was for a prophet no it's for you it was a gift given to an age that he could discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart bring you up in front of a group of people and discern it and be 100 true now that can still happen but not in the magnitude that it happened back then because that was one gift to one generation everybody with me but now I believe that since we have the word of God because brother Brown you watch him and I want to see these people that that want to do away with brother Ratterman think he was wrong I mean he stood there and he said if God be God if I've told you the truth tonight let him come on the scene and vindicate it and he did it every time God didn't have to he'd have to vindicate non-word he didn't have to vindicate somebody that was false but he stood before hundreds of thousands of people and he said tonight if I've told you the truth he said let God come on this platform and you'll see the glory of God and God was there every single time he never had a sermon please bring me one if he says now I've been waiting on him for about five minutes we're gonna wait a few more minutes and see if he comes now I know that there's times that he did wait on God because God's Sovereign he can come whenever he wants to listen we can't override the sovereignty of God whatever what that was something had to get out of the way for him to come but he wasn't because brother Brown was preaching fault Doctrine but he didn't wait 30 minutes and then 30 minutes later he's like well he's not he's not coming tonight he must be somewhere else he's probably over there Oral Roberts or somewhere he's not coming tonight he never said that God has to honor his word take him at his word start speaking to yourself speak to your children speak to your wife everything you need speak to yourself for the new birth who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil Jonas yesterday Ewan um Thomas where did y'all go went to Perry George why so he can shoot archery first time you've ever picked up a bow right really oh you practiced oh man how many times you practice yeah I know if it was Guns going off we'd done arrested you you go over to this house it looks like Custer's Last Stand but it's usually in the bullseye same way with with Thomas they shot well why have they practiced well I don't know one thing there was not one person down there your dad said there's about 800 people down there shooting archery not one of them walked up and said I ain't never done this before hand me a bow I wouldn't be in the same room with them because you know what they'd be doing why they were unskillful in what they were sent to do you and I cannot be unskillful in what God sent us to do but we got to practice and practice and practice practice what Jonas form practice your form every time your muscles have to be toned to do that job because it's a stick in the string and it's hard to shoot them things I promise you'd done it before but when you get everything down right and you lock that baby in you locked in back muscles and you don't do this your training will put that Arrow right where it's at same thing with me and you our problem is is we're unskillful I'm me okay I'm sorry I'm gonna preach to me today I'm unskillful because there's things that I want done in my life and things that I won't done not me personally but I want God to do in my life that's not happening yet why I haven't practiced enough to discern both good and evil the word discern means to separate make a distinction discriminate to prefer and remember we're in this age of of discrimination and all this stuff brother Brown told us that God was he did discriminate he said these are my kids these are not he was a segregationist he separated why he discerned brother Brown's discernment was to what it was to separate the good from the bad the false from the true remember there was people that came up in his early Ministry and gave him those cards and it was wrong and they were trying to do that to trick him well what brother rhyme tell him he said look there's nothing wrong with you this is not but now since you've done this to the Holy Ghost now you have those things that are on that card you don't play with God no he don't play with that gift either so to discern it so that discernment is for me and you both it's to separate make a distinction we got to know what's right and what's wrong we got to know whether we listen to false Doctrine or we listen to True Doctrine and to do what to take that and use it in our archery tournament or you use it in our track of life or the things that we do and that we do for God and and like brother Bob and brother Louise brother Bob has never been over to another country before I don't know if you've ever been out two or three states before every time you see the pictures of him he's like his white eye like a deer in a headline he's having the time but he's saying things he probably has never seen before amen but now Luis he's been there he's been there two or three times he's you're part of the culture you know and he's he's like just as comfortable he can be and Bob's like why he doesn't have discernment because he doesn't know what he's looking at yet that's not to say anything against Bob it's just his first time but when he goes back again he's going to be more calm you know I've been to Jamaica 11 times and it doesn't bother me one bit to go get on a plane go to Jamaican I could probably Drive I'd have to remember to drive on the other side of the road but I went wasn't bother me because I pretty much know the place why I've been there so I can separate the good from the bad I can go to the right places well that's the way God is with the word he tells you what to do and we're supposed to do that we're not supposed to well you know let's just live close enough to the world where they can't tell the difference no you need to live so far away from the world so they definitely can tell the difference amen so that's discernment and what is their discernment oh y'all just get beat down you just have to do this I am so sorry and I'm going to tell you something to be really honest sisters with long hair like that like Jim's got God bless you God bless you because I'm telling you if fires is wrong we gonna get it cut yeah I mean if we got two or three you know every time June's got them Flyers you know got them to stick out way out like this and you can't ever get back to the back right but see we don't have to do that we just go in there and go man that's been there a while you know start cutting it off but your sisters don't do that to fill the glory of the Lord not because it makes you look good battery indifferent you do it for the glory of the Lord right but it is a sacrifice God bless you for that I appreciate you washing your hair you have to have to wash all that all that hair bless your heart I sent her up the Genies up to our girl at the at the beauty shop and she washed her hair for her because I don't know if I could do that or not that's just a lot to have to wash that's a lot of hair but you know what that's your example that's your example to the world you can't preach come on but you can show the world that it can be done what the Bible says and you know what it not be done begrudgingly but be doing it for the glory of God and doing it because you you don't feel you have to everybody thinks you know what well y'all are so depressed and so suppressed and all that we're the most free people on the face of the Earth we do it because we want to not because we have to mine and I pray to you that your love may abound yet more and more in what knowledge and in all judgment we have been given this knowledge right down here at the bottom of the pyramid to judge because I'll promise you when you get Temperance and patience you're gonna have to know what you're doing somebody say Amen because that's going to be the rough one for all of us but now there's a group that has a form of godliness I'll get back to my other sermon in a minute I didn't finish this this morning some have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof he said from such turn away in other words go in another Direction for this sort of they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly churches women are churches in the Bible Laden with sins LED away with many lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth God don't ever let me get in that place don't ever let me get into that spot Hebrews 10 verse 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith look without wavering so why if the storms of life hit you right between the eyes if you're a child of God it's got to be for your help God's not going to put something on you that you can't handle you just don't know whether you can handle yet or not and let us consider one another to provoke under love and good words not forsaking the assembling of ourselves who put that in there thank you not forsake you the Assembly of ourselves together as a manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as we see the day approaching for if we sin willfully look at that scripture right after that if we sin willfully after that we've received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for that sin and I'm not going to read you the rest of it because it's pretty horrible so let's get out of that one let's go up here to get back on my sermon here everybody all right say Amen so here we go I love that little thing that says welcome back knowledge second Peter 1 verse 5 beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue into virtue knowledge knowledge is no cease which is science science is good if it's right listen God's the greatest scientist there ever was the greatest he's the most perfect scientist he can answer every question there's not a uh when you say that Aaron when you can't come to it's like you can't have a whole number it's like 0.3333 and it continues isn't there a there's a there's a there's a theory or some kind of a something that I can't remember been a long time ago but it never comes to a straight number it just keeps going like threes and twos and ones and you can't ever get the exact definite number well in God that'll happen wait yes thank you and it just keeps going on and on and on and on why there's no end to it we haven't figured it out yet God doesn't do that God's yeses are yes and there's no's or no knowledge signifies in general intelligence understanding the general knowledge of Christian religion the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion that's what I want I want God to make us deeper in the word of God because you know why it make your life a whole lot better it may mind in your life a whole lot better if we dig deeper and get the knowledge of God not the knowledge of the world such as belongs to the more advanced especially of things lawful and unlawful for Christians see that's coming from this is coming from from the um from the Greek now why does the denominations not see that why does the people that are tricked into believing these doctrines that are not true because look it says especially if those things lawful and unlawful for a Christian it's unlawful for you to cut your hair sisters it's not just a uh well maybe no it's in the Bible such as belongs to the more advanced especially if things lawful and unlawful Christian moral wisdom such as in seeing and right as seen in right living now see we shouldn't have to teach that we shouldn't have to teach right living but we do for the babies you have to remind the baby a hundred times you ought not have to remind an adult a hundred times everybody with me so make sure you sign up that sheet down there before Wednesday make my mama mad Genesis 2 verse 9. listen we're all the same old same I'm the same way amen my wife's in that's all right out of the ground made the Lord to grow every tree and what are we feeding off let's get back on our subject the Tree of Life in the midst of your garden is what we're eating off of and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is that next realm of memory region conscious affection that we were looking at this morning because look see you can have a knowledge of Good and Evil listen to me you can have a knowledge of Good and Evil in your spirit you can't your soul it's either good or evil but you can have a knowledge of Good and Evil in your memory reason conscious affection imagination because Satan plays in that realm and God is in that realm everybody with me on that the knowledge of Good and Evil you wrote in on that today you wrote in on the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil today because some people literally wrote in and their horse on their horse several hundred years ago you know I hadn't been long it had been about a hundred and something years since the motor was created and then it was just a little bit it will get you 20 miles an hour maybe something like that but look at it now we've come to where uh we got well airplanes run six seven hundred miles an hour we broke sound barrier and just keep on going 1500 miles an hour two thousand well guess what that's the way it should be in the word of God then remember he sent us out sent him out of the garden listen we went out without him and Eve we stay in the garden we went out with Adam and Eve because we can't get back in the garden yet we're getting we're heading back to the Garden but we came out with Adam and Eve brother Brown said that was our that was our father mother we were born between Satan and Eve well you can get quiet on me it's okay I know it's afternoon I know we ate something and it's a little bit sweaty but I'm going to anyway doesn't matter if you sit there and look at stare at me like I'm crazy I know I'm crazy so don't stare at me like that you're wasting your time and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden they may you may freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat for in the day you eat that tree you're going to surely die and Eve did and then Adam did and then we died and that part we're still eating off of to this day but you know what's going to happen when we talk about you go to the invisible Union brother Brown says the second Eve talking about what then you take Christ to mystery God revealed that that threefold purpose of Christ the mystery what all things in Christ all things in the church take us back to the Garden of Eden but we got to have all things in Christ and then hurt us first before he takes us back to the Garden of Eden he is going to take us back to the Garden of Eden whether we want whether the world says not ain't never going to be Eden yes there will be in Eden yes there'll be a time even in a millennium there's going to be a time that me and you're not going to have to worry about a car worry about a credit card worry about a bill somebody's saying man good grief I don't want to make you happy travel like I thought eat what we want to not we have to what we have to well maybe you'll get a revelation one of these things but remember the church left their first love that's why that's why we're having to start down here again because we left our first look they had these virtues but Joe they had them working in the first church second Church in a little bit in the Third Church what eat it down man's ideas eat that thing down to hair again that's why he had to restore our restore saith the Lord because look first three Church ages brother rap said they had the pure word of God no denominations sure the ideas were coming in because he said he said there's nicolaitanism it's coming in right now but it was in the baby form baby form remember from where you've fallen and we did we we had a prophet to tell us where we left where the church got off and where to come back to we know that now the Baptists don't know that they think they're still on the right track methodists were on the right track someone might be on their right track but I tell you before like I said again there's Brides brides churches Brides but there's going to come one there's one church one bride that's going to be without spot or wrinkle and we're going to take a body change I just contend it's us remember where you fall repent do the first words or else I'll come and take your Candlestick out of its place no I'm going to take your fire out because you're not using it I'm gonna take your light out because you're not using it except I'll reprint but this thou has that thou hatest of these are the Nicolaitans which also hate watches nicolaitanism what Conquering the laity if Satan can get you guys either have to near let him hear what the spirit says to the church and him and overcometh well I give to either the tree of life now we're back eating a tree of life if you're born again today you are eating off the tree of life all right which is in the midst of the paradise of God and right here is the paradise of God does not mind He knows where the new city is going to be he knows what it's going to look like he knows how square miles he didn't he had brother Branham got that by Revelation but God didn't get it by Revelation he knew it was going to be 1500 Miles Square and only the bride was going to live there but we didn't know that they know World nobody out there in the world knows that we're going to live in a 1500 square mile city just to bride just a bride and 144 000. but we do know that we know God's given us a place but you know what the paradise of God's inside of you by the new birth you have a peace and a part of that City inside you today and that's that desire you're going to see it come down out of Heaven you did when you got born again but remember we're going to go over in another dimension God's going to destroy this thing and he's going to bring that city that was built by your desire all right what does knowledge mean the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity I got it right gain through experience or Association acquainted acquaintance with our understanding of a science art or a technique the fact of condition of being aware of something listen we can't go through this world and not be aware if you've come under this message of the hour you ought to know that and be aware that you are special people that you are the chosen some choose to be the chosen Frozen but that's okay one day God's going to put a fire under you and you'll find out there's nothing in this world that you need besides God circumstance or condition of apprehending Truth what do you do what does apprehend mean when somebody steals something or you you chasing some robbers what do you do when you you catch them you apprehend them you go catch them and you bring them back and that's what we're doing with these these look folks this has all been lost the virtues have been lost down Through the Ages they've just been scattered everywhere thank God it took a master builder it took the rubble it was removable to bring it back put it back together build it back up do a little prophet of Malachi 4. he even told him how to draw this drawing nobody ever put the pyramid with the with the Statue of perfect man right is that one and that's good enough for me because you know what it fits it fits if you continue my words then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now listen we can't know the truth and it behind us you can't it's not the right truth if you got something that's binding you it's not the truth because the truth is going to set you free that Jubilee year when they got to that place and they realized it was the 50th year and they realized I don't care how much debt I incurred I don't care how much I I my house needs this and the gutters and shutters and all that stuff I'm going free God give me a place over there not here come on people God give us a place over there not here we know it's going to be here but we got to go over here and let him clean this off then we're going to come back man that word know is to perceive understand get a knowledge of perceive or feel understand perceive have a knowledge of to understand look it's a Jewish idiom for sexual intercourse between a man and a woman Adam knew his wife Eve all right look at this to become with acquainted with to know to the Greeks it's meant to know facts but these facts May or not affect one's conduct to the Jews true knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct you know what that is it always manifests itself in one's conduct if you got a problem with your temper I'll promise you God is going to make sure you know whether you got left left you or not I used to say no that's the devil now that's good if you're a child of God it's God guiding this because what brother Brown Say he said he turned the devil loose on you if you consider my servant job job was a wonderful guy he was just having a party he was great devil didn't even notice him lord said if you consider this guy right here we've been Satan me walking up down the Earth in other words there was millions of people on the Earth and he just he just tormenting every one of them and here's job over here somewhere in the corner and nobody's bothered him nobody's seen him he's got all the cattle he can he can feed and he's got all the kids and he's got houses and he's got property and he's got everything and he said hey devil if you have you checked this guy out yet God did that you know why because he knew what job would do job didn't know what job would do you got new and knows what you'll do but you don't know and see to me that's a revelation because it'll it'll help me understand where I'm at our trials our test is like I said it's for a testimony but these facts are may may or may not affect one's conduct to the Jews true knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct one did not know something until that fact had a particular outworking in his life well that just sounds exactly what these virtues are is an outworking in your life and sometimes you don't know you got it until you go to a test and then you figure out yes I do or no I don't all right Proverbs 3 verse 13 says happy as a man that findeth wisdom and the man that giveth understanding for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and gold she see it all that all turns into a she now she is more precious than rubies and all the things that can't desire are not to be compared unto her Length of days is in her right hand and then her left hand riches an honor her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is everyone that retaineth her you know what people ought to be happy to be around you that's right people ought to be happy to be around you sit there and think about that for about 10 seconds and figure out if that's what's happening in your life or people can't stand to be around you want to do and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment you say judgment yes that knowledge right there watch this first Corinthians dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints dare any of you Paul said Paul's in corinths all right we got all these Corinthians that are babies and they're some of them are still out of worship person some of them still partying some of them still drink at the Lord's table and some of them are just newborn babes and Paul's gotta treat them like babies he said why y'all take each other to court to go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters no ye not that we shall judge angels world now angels they were created before you got here we're still going to judge them no you're not that we shall judge Angels how much more things that pertain to this life if then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church you know what Paul's saying he said don't take him to the smart guy take him to the ones who leads to steam because if he's got the Holy Ghost he does have some discernment now the problem is and and I want to explain something real quick because um don't let people run over you in life this is talking about a brother me and Donnie taking each other to court you should not do that number one you save a lot on all your Thief yeah say Amen again yeah but we should be able to bring it here and judge it right here now not judge among everybody there's some private things but get the Saints to get the the elders together and the pastor and the sister pastor and the deacons and elders and we're going to sit down and talk this thing out but now if Donnie was in in business with an unbeliever you can't do nothing about the unbeliever you be the Christian but he's unjust you see where it says right here right here there you interview having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints and others why are you taking it to somebody that's unjust not a Christian and why are you letting them jump make you make your judgment No it should be done here that would be a brother and a brother together if you have a problem it needs to be handled here now if it's out in the world you can't do what they they don't even think like we do amen they don't we've handled them before they want to take you to court for everything we should be able to judge it right here well get quiet if you want to it's okay thirdly add knowledge knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to God but knowledge to judge just what right from wrong how do you judge it then if you've got Christian knowledge with your virtue and Faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong and if you can lay us out all your Creeds and all your unbelief everything you claim you have done then you have knowledge to believe that God cannot lie let every man's word be alive but mine be true now you're getting knowledge that Supreme knowledge you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that to have it because all these virtues are given to you by God to place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of God yes sir but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and can see that by the revelation of God the whole word word is wrote in Mysteries somebody asked the other day we were talking about something why didn't Moses he wrote Genesis he actually saw what happened between Adam and Eve and he wrote fruit trees and fruit to hide it to hide it from us to make it a mystery to the unlearned remember God wants to tell us his Secrets not the world because if they become like us in becoming the family of God they'll understand it just like we do anybody with me why did Moses do that Moses saw what happened he called it fruit don't eat of that either this they did this they did that he watched the whole thing he didn't just write it down by you know God just wrote letters up in the sky now I believe he saw I believe he saw the whole soon as a creation and he just started writing what the creation was looking like through a television that's just the way I see it but folks man didn't see it that way they think Eve ate an apple that caused all these problems that we have but it was hidden but you can take then you take the whole Bible the Bible talks about being the fruit of your mother's womb and about being the fruit of your mother and about being this and being a fruit and being being all this and eating of this and eating of that if you put all that together you know exactly what happened in the garden then when you get and say punctuate every word of God with an amen then add that to your faith then the statue of perfect man I read you this morning the prayer was Build Me Up Lord into this let Christ be my head that works through me on my Foundation my faith is in him that virtue and all this temporations godliness brotherly kindness working Me O Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die I think or drown domination no denominations friend or no friend can we say that can we say that word working me whether I don't care who the world's gonna call us crazy anyway because we don't even think the way they think let that work in me let Christ's virtue his knowledge flow out that not be able to teach those let's continue on the 70 weeks so Daniel Brothers talks about a spirit coming in the church there's a spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day we're living in just the same as Gabriel come to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secret things do you understand now oh that's too deep for me you haven't studied enough you haven't listened to enough tapes you haven't read enough books you haven't listened to enough sermons because somewhere in that if you're a child of God he's obligated to put that there in front of you for you to make a choice with he's obligated he asked he wants to not want to as the Bible says you you your son starts crying for bread and he's hungry and he can't eat you give him a rock all right he's hungry and you give him a scorpion that's not our God he gives us the best we got the best preachers the best deacons the best everything we got is the best there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse who's you talking about Jesus Christ and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of what counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord every bit of that is in Jesus Christ now everybody that's been transferred into me and you every bit of that Ephesians 1 17 says that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints Hebrews 5 13 we read a few minutes ago we'll read it again everyone that uses milk is unskillful now it doesn't say if you use milk you were wrong and that you denied the word no it just says you were unskillful in handling the word of God for he is a babe but strong me belonged to them that are a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and even we read what discern means to separate make a distinction discriminate to prefer so I said about brother Brown I'm standing there night after night he's sitting there and so vivid he'd tell you a house number he'd tell you they got bushes in front of your house he said your your house number's on your door now why did he just say your house numbers 214. he said it's on your door and your door is green and you live on so-and-so Street and you had you saw a doctor yesterday and he owned a blue coat why'd he say that he wanted to make sure God wanted to make sure that we knew that that man was not a hoax that he was literally seeing what was going on and listen if you see what's going on you're an eyewitness Timothy says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this sort of lay which creep into houses Elite captive silly women or silly churches Laden with sins LED away with many of us ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth they're learning over here but they never come to the knowledge of the truth you know why because most don't want the truth the truth hurts the truth's hard to handle if it was really easy thereby would live this Bible and it wouldn't have no problems at all every person would live this right here and it'd be no problem at all it ain't easy it's hard you know why it's hard because you fight you you don't fight me you don't fight Donnie you fight you Hebrews 10 verse 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith look without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good words not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together who put that in there again as a matter of some but exhorting one another look exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching for if we sin willfully if we do this we do this willfully now folks there's no sacrifice for that there's the words that we're going to stop we'll stop right here musicians come on the word knowledge the word wisdom Spirit of wisdom and to discern all that isn't what we just spoke about now we're going to talk about Wednesday night we're going to talk about the wise and the unwise virgin and we'll talk about being known and a little bit more about judging but those are the things those are the words that go with that knowledge we must have Holy Ghost knowledge to go to temperance to go to patients to go to not godliness but the spirit of wisdom I pray that this year the spirit of wisdom will come into this church more and more wisdom to discern wisdom to do the right thing wisdom for all of us to do the right thing wisdom for us to get in our position know what we're supposed to do and do it all right and not be tossed about with every wind of Doctrine we we shouldn't that that should be one of those things that we move over to the side we don't have false Doctrine here I don't believe I don't believe I'm telling you I don't believe you might believe it but I don't believe we have false Doctrine okay if we don't have false Doctrine then take that and put it over to the side put that over to the side we've we've we've won that war right we won that battle in other words not war we won that battle that battle is what let's work on something else let's start sharpening let's stand to our feet let's start sharpening our short and whatever the devil's got for us this year hack him what brother Ernie say hack him smack him cut him if he knocks her teeth out we gum him to death that's right what else what else does he say I I miss brother Ernie I miss him a lot I was looking online last night they have that memorial service for him and I thought man he's just gone he's gone but you know what he went when God knew he was going to go that's right he meant when God was finished with that man he was done with him because I believe that man was a man of God I believe he led many people to the Lord I Believe by his testimony he led a lot of listen to me he led a lot of intellectual people that maybe we couldn't have got to him doing those seminars for the you know the other for people you know like in sales and all that he was able to touch their heart where we wouldn't be able to touch it I believe every Ministry has a has a part to play that nobody else can play that part you've got a part that you can deal with this certain thing and then the other minister comes in he deals with this certain thing May preach the same sermon it's just a little way that you bring it it goes over into this angle so it'll help you and it goes over this angle so it can help the other person because God's obligated to what his word he's not obligated to me and you he's obligated to his word his word will set you free this world will bind you this world will smack you and hack you if you'll let it but I don't want to be The Hunted let's go hunting we don't have to hunt the truth truth's here we hunt souls and we hunt a better way to live a better way to act a better way to show people around you God that's my prayer for this year help me Lord like I said before I know New Year's resolution we're going to get New Year's revelation I just read you brother Brian said there's no prevailing power what is prevailing that means it goes over every other power there's no prevailing power except for Revelation then you need to pray for Revelation the prophet said above anything pray for revelation God I need a revelation because you know you can put things that you can say God all right I know what the godhead is now I don't have to have that preach to me every service okay really come on we got to move we gotta move on some do need that but some don't I know water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't have to have that preach to me every sermon but some does but let's move on a little bit higher let's go a little bit further let's have a knowledge of the truth not a knowledge of the world out there let's have a knowledge of the truth let's sing a song [Music] um [Music] Lord plant my feet on higher ground oh Lord Lift Me Up hey let me stand by faith on him it's a higher place my heart has no desire to stay and fears is made though some may dwell where they listen down to Fair somebody's gonna be there no my prayer get

rid of all that stuff Hey sister Shepard you know she was wondering if she had the Holy Ghost well you know what she didn't not only get the prophet to tell her she had the Holy Ghost he told her

Grace and knowledge you're getting rid of the sticks amen can we not do that you say well my stick's not very big well it can turn into a log and you know what if you get several thousand sticks in a hole guess what it's going to do he's going to clog it up had one on my route the other day that it wasn't very many but buddy that that hole was about that big around and when we all let rain it just

word of God into me and you is that your desire that's my desire please we're not going to leave anybody behind we're going to go as fast as we can go as hard as we can go if you have trials and tribulations that's all right we're right there with you just staying with you we're not going to get rid of you I I don't want to throw anybody out I'd rather pull them in the boat hunting you I'll

natural husband and wife but we love you all man I tell you um this past week's been a struggle but uh we're gonna and it's a better struggle because I've had to take care of June I know what y'all were thinking are y'all thinking that I discerned that because the women are rolling their eyes you know no it's not because of her no but but we did say you know the by we we talk about our bowels some of you that forgot your vows that says better or worse sickness and in health richer or poor right that's what you said and you promised before God to do with your spouse rich or poor sickness and health till death do us part wow a lot of people break that vow you know there's a lot of people standing to pulpit and they'll say that and it won't be long before they break those loud you know what that vow brother Brown what did he say he said he said the man he said no your vow is what marries you to that woman your vow to say I'll take you it's going to be really good in about 18 to 20 years old not a problem but when you get 65 and 70. it's going to test that vow that you made several years ago but you know what it's no better thing than that right there other than the Salvation is to have a wonderful wife and a wonderful husband and we appreciate that [Applause] was God Did It folks I promise you that yeah it wasn't me wasn't my it wasn't my good sense to do that don't you smile you know you need to get a little bit taller if you're going to be the same as your brother back there you're going to wear you some like well they don't make 12 inch shoes I don't think because you need to be up here and talking instead of being done here like this we can get you that little booster so you can stand over there but why did they both wear blue shirts too anyway he just didn't wear a tie hmm oh oh okay blame my wife [Laughter] [Applause] but again just remember brother Ryan and uh sister Gabby's taking over for for Anna's class and and we've uh we got Ryan up here doing opening the service and we sure appreciate each one of you that does everything you do for us we appreciate it and if we don't tell you now remind us we'll tell you because we do without this without all y'all this place doesn't run people like like you said in the media room back there man they are they're going all the time all right just to get this word out all over the world um there's no telling how many countries how many people we affect but you know what God's Gonna God's gonna let us know I believe brother Joe I believe he'll set us down and he'll say you helped that one if you hadn't been for you because what did they tell brother Brown when he went across the curtain time he said they said if you had not come if you had not come we wouldn't be here boy wow same way here somebody will say hey how many times we've seen people said we got saved or or we you know had a Doctrine um figured out and everything by listening to your ministry uh thank God that you know there was one time that brother Dale didn't even want to um I was thinking about this yesterday we're talking about Ryan that was one time daddy said nope we ain't having no drums you remember that nope they have no drone nope nope can we have nope Ryan can we get Ryan to play just for the Bongos just play the bongo drum okay all right you opened that door for us and we appreciate that you play for the glory of the Lord you don't play with your you know you don't flip your you know do like a rock you know a rock band or something I don't know how that works y'all just wanted to tell me how that works but how you flip those things you know and play you do good for the glory of the Lord and it's not over and we have Brother Gary Atkins here he did the same thing they played just so wonderful and we appreciate that we appreciate you appreciate the stand you know keeping your household and uh with four girls just saying anyway but we love you man we appreciate you you've uh you've been you've been one of the most faithful people in this church and we appreciate that [Applause] when you get to Holy Ghost that's what happens to you if you want to know what happens you get the Holy Ghost look at that man right there and his wife and the family you know what he done I'm just going to say it he started right if you start wrong it's hard to make it back up hard to make it back up but when you start right you pray God give me you've heard their testimony God give me a good Spirit-filled lady give me a good spirit filled a wife and then they converse with each other and they love each other and they they talk about the Lord together and they sit down and have Bible study and all these different things I I'm ashamed I don't do all that means you don't do that that much but thank you for being an example even to the younger ones and and hey I rebuked us older ones hello somebody but yeah we appreciate that and we thank you very much wonderful choice we appreciate all of you all the ministers and everybody else so all mine's clear let's buy our heads Lord thank you for the day you've given us we appreciate truly holy ghost-filled people to surround us as you said there would be a pillar of Fire well where is that pillar fire sometimes we want to see that Pillar of Fire on a wall or or on a ceiling or floating through the room father I pray that we see the pillar of fire in each one of us I pray that we show that Pillar of Fire to the world and that they know we're different and Satan you know one thing's for sure you can't have our soul if we're born again you can't even touch it it's a 10 million vote that you can might try to touch but you'll never ever put the fire of God out never will Satan defeat us even though we may go down with this body in a grave our soul will be preserved in that sixth Dimension waiting for a time for us to come to the resurrection pick that same body up look at the Devil and say Boo you may have destroyed it but you're not going to ever destroy it again you may have tormented us but you'll never torment us again you may give us sickness but you'll never give us sickness again never for an eternity Lord we
