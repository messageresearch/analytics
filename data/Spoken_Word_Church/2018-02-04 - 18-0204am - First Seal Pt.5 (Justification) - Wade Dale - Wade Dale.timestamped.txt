[15:40] iniquity because it really showed showed
[15:43] a lot of things that that time we'll get
[15:45] into it in a minute we'll recount but I
[15:47] hope you saw one thing's for sure that

[15:50] brother Branham said the mystery is now
[15:52] have become history that mystery of
[15:54] iniquity has been open it back in the
[15:57] first part of the church ages it was hid
[16:01] now it's fully open fully revealed we
[16:05] know just like what we know where we
[16:07] come from what we're doing here where
[16:08] we're going we know now where the man of
[16:11] sin come from what he's doing right now
[16:12] and where he's going to end up some to
[16:15] me that's what the seals are tells us
[16:17] where we come from what we're doing here
[16:19] where we're going that's the simplest
[16:20] way to show the plan of redemption where
[16:24] we came from
[16:25] where we're going I mean what we're
[16:26] doing here where we're going so I just
[16:29] keep selling you prayers

[17:30] gonna be rainy it's all gonna be
[17:33] wonderful because they can't they they
[17:34] overcame I love the many times you said
[17:38] in your Bible about he that overcometh
[17:39] so we all got to overcome something Lord
[17:43] I prayed that now we'll overcome the
[17:45] things of the world just for a little
[17:46] while as we sit down and hear from you
[17:48] Lord you do the speaking you'd be the
[17:50] one that does the manifestation the

[18:26] care of us now to further them in the
[18:27] service in Jesus name we pray amen
[18:29] our revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when
[18:33] the lamb opened one of the seals and I
[18:34] heard as it were the noise of thunder
[18:35] one of the four beasts saying come and
[18:38] see man I got some new contacts and I
[18:40] can see better now and this is good and
[18:41] I saw and behold a white horse and he
[18:43] that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[18:45] was given unto him and he went forth
[18:47] conquering and to conquer you may be
[18:49] seated in the Lord has blessed
[18:51] wasn't gonna use a chart today but I
[18:52] think we'll that's all I got
[18:54] I appreciate brother Danny always won't
[19:01] try to help but sometimes get into all
[19:03] this narrow stuff one person is about
[19:05] enough time we just run all over each
[19:08] other so I tell you to turn around shake
[19:12] somebody's hand Bettina not enough of
[19:13] you here to do that soon but that's
[19:17] alright
[19:19] Lord brother Guardian and and that's
[19:25] gonna say sister Guardi brother guardian
[19:28] and his sister made in here is this John
[19:30] you made it here and that's good always
[19:32] like to see their smile of faith you're
[19:37] talking about been here for a while now
[19:38] brother Daugherty Holly's not here I'd
[19:40] give him a rose but brother dart he's
[19:42] been here since I was just a child and
[19:44] I'm 58 years old so that tells you how
[19:46] old he is but it also gives him
[19:50] accolades that he's been here for a long
[19:52] time and he don't look my age either and
[19:56] younger sometimes you hate people with
[20:00] godly jealousy you know y'all excuse me
[20:05] I have an old beekeeper that's on the
[20:07] YouTube and he's from Mississippi and he
[20:10] was getting from the camera he said
[20:11] excuse my backside so excuse my backside
[20:15] alright so now the way we started Bob
[20:19] was if from what you had is this fresh
[20:22] this is not what you know ken but if
[20:25] you'll notice Bob brought his own his
[20:27] own brand up here the other day so so I
[20:30] wasn't afraid to drink it I just want to
[20:33] make sure it wasn't real warm so as we
[20:37] get started now let's pull up the next
[20:39] one and show we've got to keep saying
[20:41] this this scratching or anything that's
[20:43] okay a little bit sometimes I like these
[20:48] sweaters now I think they look good but
[20:50] it keeps your thumb and pull the coat
[20:52] off but sometimes it gets caught so now
[20:54] remember we still got to remember
[20:56] Redemption now let's get started by wait
[20:57] now
[20:58] okay yo show the slipper you don't you
[21:01] to slip another hour or two something
[21:04] maybe three but the breaking of the
[21:06] seals is not necessarily hey I like
[21:09] those a little thing for their soul
[21:11] because the soul is redeemed by the new
[21:12] birth all right because we're going to
[21:14] talk today about justification which is
[21:18] number one it's a work of the holy ghost
[21:21] right all right the bowel right say man
[21:23] cuz I'm gonna take my time today we
[21:25] don't have nothing else to do I'm gonna
[21:26] take my time alright if you're hungry
[21:29] eat it home to Bible fast but it will
[21:31] we're gonna eat right here
[21:33] I'm gonna have you in the front row but
[21:34] it will bring full fellowship into
[21:37] manifestation
[21:37] now what we're talking about is there
[21:40] was a time when when Adam and guard
[21:43] fellowship together right no problem he
[21:46] could walk up the guard guard to walk up
[21:48] to him and in the cool of the day and
[21:49] they could just converse talk about
[21:51] whatever but there was a time when that
[21:54] thing separated I ma'am
[21:57] so now what is that was the fall so now
[22:00] what we got to do is is get back into
[22:01] full fellowship what we got to get out
[22:04] of our mind is though I think about this
[22:06] other day what we got to get out of our
[22:08] mind is is that in the Millennium this
[22:10] is going to happen in the future home
[22:13] this is gonna happen no no no Adams full
[22:16] fellowship with God was we're in heaven
[22:21] right here on earth walking on the Saint
[22:26] listen this is the same earth that Adam
[22:28] walked on before the fall and then and
[22:32] what fell was Adam fell and then it took
[22:35] this ball we call earth with it alright
[22:38] so the full fellowship listen God can't
[22:42] even fully fellowship with the earth
[22:44] like he gives to a man same way with
[22:47] that with you and I he can't fellowship
[22:49] with us like he really wants to like I
[22:51] said many times before he's waited so
[22:54] patient for this bride to come into
[22:57] maturity enough to where he can come
[22:59] back into fellowship man it's like it's
[23:02] like you know Jim gonna be gone for six
[23:04] months or something and and then here I
[23:06] come back or here she comes back man I'd
[23:09] you know I'd go crazy before that time
[23:12] gods waited thousands of years for you
[23:13] and I to come to a place that he can
[23:16] talk to us and I was reading and I may
[23:18] have brought it but may not that we're
[23:20] brother Branham was talking about that
[23:23] you and I are the justification of God I
[23:28] did bring it I do I just came to my
[23:31] memory I did bring you and I are the
[23:34] justification of God because the Bible
[23:36] said that he raised for our
[23:39] justification and then and then in turn
[23:43] the reason he raised is that you and I
[23:46] can come into the same place that he was
[23:48] standing on the earth in a glorified
[23:50] body talking to people eating fellowship
[23:54] and for 30 to 40 days and then he
[23:57] disappeared into another dimension all
[24:00] right so that's what's gonna happen to
[24:01] you and I is there any different no he
[24:05] just did it first so that you and I can
[24:08] follow behind a man he did all this
[24:11] first he's always like I said he's the
[24:13] originator Satan is not the originator
[24:15] of anything because what's going to
[24:17] happen when we leave here what's going
[24:20] to happen Satan's going to come and
[24:21] incarnate a man just like God incarnate
[24:24] as bride go that man the Pope whatever
[24:28] you want to call it is going to be in
[24:30] full control of Satan he is going to be
[24:32] Satan standing on the earth and then now
[24:36] Satan was standing in the earth and a
[24:37] beast back in the garden he's gonna be
[24:40] standing on the Beast a man when we
[24:44] leave this place
[24:45] all right that all right but see thank
[24:51] God we're not gonna be here to see it
[24:53] because he could almost deceive the very
[24:55] elect in the position he's in right now
[24:58] much less he's going to deceive Bobby's
[25:01] going to see the whole world the whole
[25:04] world is gonna fall at his feet Muslim
[25:09] Islam Christian Catholics Jews they're
[25:15] all going to fall for this one man amen
[25:20] but now we know who he is we know his
[25:23] tribal from you talked about the trail
[25:25] of the serpent well my brother but I
[25:27] didn't have to preach it he preached it
[25:28] the whole time he he he told us the
[25:30] whole trail he gave it to us all the way
[25:33] to his destruction in coming to the
[25:37] future home amen
[25:38] because remember he's going to the lake
[25:40] of fire before even why throne judgment
[25:42] he a man the false prophet right what
[25:48] the Bible says that's what we got to get
[25:49] back to and see that I want you to sense
[25:51] why we've stayed in the Bible last
[25:52] Sunday and I think we'll stay in the
[25:54] Bible something that's done you because
[25:56] out of the Bible comes everything we
[25:58] need the love letter that we have we
[26:00] need to start reading it a little bit
[26:02] more intimate not so much as more not so
[26:10] much as moral we need to read the Bible
[26:12] more but I'd sit there and read the
[26:13] Bible twenty-five times and not get
[26:15] anything but to read a scripture and
[26:18] then see that it connects with what
[26:20] we're talking about and to see that it
[26:22] connects on there was one here that you
[26:25] know and I only just plant this little
[26:27] seed remember brother Branham told us
[26:29] about just justification the first form
[26:31] of justification chopped off your past
[26:33] sin you can't find that in a dictionary
[26:36] it's not in the dictionary you can't
[26:40] find it anywhere
[26:41] but in the Bible and it's so clear you
[26:46] read it you go man where'd that come
[26:50] from you want talking about when when
[26:54] the word opens up it's been there all
[26:56] along it's been there and since since
[26:58] the 1500s when they put everything
[27:00] together but man has read it and read it
[27:02] with all different kind of glasses but
[27:04] now you and I we are going to see as we
[27:08] were talking about going up the statue a
[27:10] perfect man to be more it's just it's
[27:13] more it's adding to add to your faith
[27:17] virtue knowledge never add to your faith
[27:21] remember faiths not an add face
[27:22] something you get it the new birth all
[27:25] right so we'll get into that in just a
[27:26] second because we're gonna have to go
[27:27] through the three types of justification
[27:30] is that that's all right just to kind of
[27:33] get everything set
[27:34] the way it's supposed to be but let's
[27:36] read first and let's get this mystery of
[27:38] iniquity just as a background of what we
[27:41] had last Sunday it's gonna be some of
[27:42] the same quotes and some of the same
[27:44] scriptures but I think we need to read
[27:45] it to recap just a little bit because
[27:48] look the mystery of iniquity is done
[27:51] it's not a mystery to us anymore
[27:53] amen all right so look number one
[27:56] brother Brown talks about Revelation
[27:58] chapter 5 I want to keep this I want you
[27:59] to keep in your mind he is preaching
[28:02] Redemption where do you look at the
[28:04] white horse riders or you look at the
[28:05] bows in the air no arrows and that is
[28:08] all showing us something about the plan
[28:12] of redemption
[28:13] he said hold that word Redemption the
[28:16] prophets in Revelation chapter 5 see
[28:19] what it's doing it's the seals opening
[28:22] up just begin to reveal the plan of
[28:25] redemption alright how he did it it's
[28:29] all over now just about just about
[28:31] finishing up now
[28:32] he said that in 1961 we're 50 years plus
[28:38] past that amen it's not three minutes to
[28:42] midnight anymore like Bob said or
[28:44] whoever it was couple Sundays ago it's
[28:46] two minutes to midnight they put the
[28:47] clock to two minutes to midnight now all
[28:50] right because the nuclear you know
[28:51] what's going on in North Korean
[28:53] something so we're now two minutes to
[28:55] midnight we're at the end time so that's
[28:57] why the things are being revealed
[28:59] because he told us it would be revealed
[29:00] when in the evening time all right this
[29:03] is it so you can we're an evening time
[29:06] but don't you file any time it talks
[29:08] about the evening sacrifice for the
[29:10] evening happening or what happens in the
[29:12] evening it's talking directly to me and
[29:14] you got all rights amen
[29:17] all right so now let's go and read the
[29:18] mystery of iniquity but let's read what
[29:21] we read last Sunday and test solonius
[29:24] for the mystery of iniquity that's
[29:25] already works he nights already working
[29:28] Paul said grievious wolves have come
[29:30] among you amen and has already started
[29:33] what taking the word apart two thousand
[29:36] years ago during Paul's time all right
[29:40] which this was written when what's
[29:43] daesil onehans it would be close to
[29:44] about eighty fifty so somewhere in
[29:47] so you see that it's already begun the
[29:49] day of Pentecost is 80 30 20 years later
[29:52] they've already started but if submit
[29:54] and it's becoming you know why it was a
[29:55] mystery because that people accepted it
[29:58] we got to cover that people accepted it
[30:01] now when you come to the first three
[30:03] ages they didn't accept it they fought
[30:06] against it
[30:06] all right because they had the pure word
[30:10] to work with all right but then you come
[30:13] any other Church ages and they start
[30:14] accepting that there's your mystery that
[30:17] the whole time God never put in a father
[30:21] son Holy Ghost baptism so that had to be
[30:24] that mystery man God accepted it though
[30:28] he winked at he said hey you know
[30:30] there's coming a time today there's
[30:32] coming a time but I'll accept that the
[30:35] way it is now you gonna have to ask God
[30:37] why he accepted it I just believe that
[30:39] he did because he he he put them people
[30:42] in Calamba Luther with the Trinitarian
[30:46] Wesley with the Trinitarian so God
[30:49] accepted that sealed him away but like
[30:51] brother Dale said that was what
[30:54] potentially potentially now not but they
[30:58] didn't have the Holy Ghost but he wasn't
[30:59] the fullness it wasn't the it wasn't the
[31:02] apex of what God wanted but he was what
[31:05] he was pleased to dwell during that time
[31:08] so what happened that mystery of
[31:11] iniquity he just hid itself right in the
[31:13] church not in the world he hid it in the
[31:19] church Satan I'm saying Satan Satan hid
[31:22] it in the church Constantine look at
[31:27] that the history's totally false totally
[31:33] false brother branham come and said he
[31:35] wasn't no Christian he wasn't a
[31:38] Christian I was the devil
[31:40] working through Constantine to put
[31:42] church and state together and decide
[31:45] that they're gonna start putting G take
[31:49] Jupiter down and put Paul or whoever it
[31:52] was Peter now to me that's deception -
[31:55] it's high school
[31:56] almost now now is that time but that you
[31:59] see how it's grown it grew up and grew
[32:02] up and grew up down through the church
[32:03] ages to a time to where it was just
[32:07] accepted practice right so when it comes
[32:10] to we're taught it's accepted practice
[32:12] what then everybody just says well
[32:14] that's just the way it is
[32:16] God said Father Son Holy Ghost God
[32:19] talked about a Trinity that's what was
[32:21] that's what he said right
[32:22] well the god of the evil a the evil ages
[32:24] the one that told him that God never
[32:26] told them that but they accepted it as
[32:29] doctrine and God just let it go on right
[32:33] because you know what they believed on
[32:36] the Lord Jesus Christ and they were safe
[32:40] whether that must have won they believed
[32:42] he was a second or third person of a
[32:44] Trinity God winked at that ignorance but
[32:47] now see you and I can't try that because
[32:49] that mystery of iniquity has now been
[32:51] open that's why in 63 brother Brown said
[32:55] I wondered why was all that he preached
[32:57] why I'm against organized religion in
[33:00] 1959 but in 63 he said now I know why I
[33:06] hated that thing
[33:08] why because that was where the the
[33:10] mystery man was act he was in those
[33:13] denominations working hey he comes to
[33:21] church then people that bring those
[33:23] doctrines they work to get them doctors
[33:25] here amen
[33:27] so let's read here for the mystery of
[33:30] iniquity doth already work only he who
[33:34] now letteth will let my brother Graham
[33:35] said that he was God who now letteth
[33:38] will let till he who the bride you and I
[33:41] be taken out of the way so in other
[33:43] words what Paul said this thing's gonna
[33:45] work the mystery of iniquity has already
[33:48] worked only he who now letteth will let
[33:50] until he be taken away and then shall
[33:54] that wicked be revealed what he'll be
[33:56] revealed to the world when you and I are
[33:58] gone you and I are the very reason that
[34:03] Satan can incarnated
[34:04] whoever you want to say you know you say
[34:07] Pope yeah it's a person
[34:10] all right so he can't incarnate that
[34:12] person because we're in the way all
[34:17] right that's what we want to do we want
[34:19] to get out of the way let this world do
[34:23] what they want to do because look it's
[34:24] promised to happen
[34:26] the seals reveal that that wild horse
[34:29] rider is the Antichrist the opening of
[34:32] the seal and he rides all the way
[34:33] through but now underneath that there's
[34:36] got to be something for you and I not
[34:39] just sure we know where he's at he's
[34:41] exposed he's been exposed that's why
[34:44] Satan hates it he hates this message in
[34:46] its purity I don't say the message he
[34:48] hates his message in its purity coming
[34:51] into what a revelation that no one else
[34:54] has had before amen
[34:57] then shall that wicked be revealed whom
[34:59] the Lord shall consume with the spirit
[35:01] of his mouth and shall destroy with the
[35:03] brightness of his coming even him whose
[35:06] coming is after the working of Satan
[35:08] with all power and signs and lying
[35:10] wonders remember he's going to have
[35:11] power when we leave they're gonna think
[35:13] he's God it's going to be them into
[35:17] profits and they're gonna be there you
[35:18] talking about a battle there's gonna be
[35:21] a battle and with all deceivableness of
[35:24] unrighteousness in them that perish
[35:26] because they received not the love of
[35:29] the truth not just a truth the love of
[35:31] the truth that they might be saved so
[35:34] God will save them feel what love the
[35:36] truth and for this cause God shall send
[35:39] them strong delusion that they should
[35:41] believe a lie now that's what God sent
[35:44] them in that church eight four churches
[35:46] he sent him a strong delusion and they
[35:48] believed it they believed the Father Son
[35:50] Holy Ghost baptism they believed in the
[35:52] Trinitarian doctrine they believed there
[35:54] was a eternal hell and God let him
[35:56] believe it that's what the Bible says
[35:59] all right all right let's go to Isaiah
[36:04] 53 now we know that if we ever talk
[36:09] about Redemption you've got to add Jesus
[36:13] Christ he's the only one who can redeem
[36:16] he's the only one who can justify you
[36:18] he's the only one that can sanctify you
[36:20] William Branham can't the blood of Jesus
[36:24] I've had to sanctify him justify him but
[36:28] he did come to a place where God could
[36:30] use him as a conduit to get it to me and
[36:32] you a man so he got it to us to open it
[36:35] to us not hide the secret to open the
[36:38] secret ma'am
[36:41] thank God brother Brown couldn't keep a
[36:43] secret he said one time he said I can't
[36:45] keep secrets and I said thank God he
[36:46] can't keep a secret
[36:47] hey man my brother Claude said one time
[36:50] I really liked that he said you know
[36:51] what I think God brother Brown can't
[36:52] keep a secret what he took his grave was
[36:56] for him but what we needed he told us
[36:58] that's it he told us and we got it it's
[37:01] here and what we gotta do now is just
[37:03] put it in what in action isaiah 53:4
[37:07] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[37:09] carried our sorrows yet he did esteem
[37:11] him stricken smitten of God and
[37:13] afflicted who told my not Jesus Christ
[37:14] but he was wounded for our
[37:16] transgressions he was bruised for our
[37:18] iniquity remember we were born in sin
[37:20] shapen in iniquity chastisement of our
[37:22] peace was upon him and with His stripes
[37:23] we are healed all we like sheep have
[37:27] gone astray we have turned every one to
[37:29] his own way that's where it is that's
[37:30] what it was and the LORD hath laid on
[37:33] him the iniquity of us all that all
[37:36] rights amen Titus 2:14 who gave himself
[37:41] for us that he might redeem us and they
[37:43] looked at word redeem us from all
[37:46] iniquity
[37:47] now remember like last Sunday here's our
[37:49] out here's our whap the mystery of
[37:52] iniquity has locked people in for
[37:54] centuries but now that that thing's been
[37:57] made known we can come out from that
[37:59] remember the wild horse rider rides away
[38:02] that man is on that horse rides away
[38:04] there's a separation god is absolutely
[38:07] as segregation as he is a separatist
[38:12] shun the appearance of evil separate
[38:15] yourself and he says in the Bible I have
[38:18] separated you I have made you a peculiar
[38:21] people who gave himself for us that he
[38:24] might redeem us from all iniquity not
[38:27] just a little bit and purify unto
[38:29] himself a peculiar people zealous of
[38:32] good words that's you and I Michael 7:18
[38:35] who is a God
[38:37] like them to leave that pardon if
[38:38] iniquity and passes by the transgression
[38:41] of the remnant of his heritage he
[38:45] retained if not his anger forever
[38:47] because he delighteth in mercy he will
[38:51] turn again he will have compassion upon
[38:53] us now this is Micah talking about
[38:55] Israel
[38:56] but you and I spiritual Israel he's
[38:59] talking to you and me he retained it not
[39:04] Xavier forever because he delighteth in
[39:06] mercy he will turn again he will have
[39:09] compassion upon us that's why it said a
[39:11] prophet a man he had compassion on us go
[39:15] this is the worst day it wasn't it was a
[39:18] deceiving time in Paul's time but now
[39:20] it's more closed than it was then and
[39:24] then he will turn again he went
[39:27] compassion upon us he will subdue our
[39:28] iniquities and thou will cast all their
[39:31] sins into the depths of the sea and then
[39:35] Psalm 32:1 a psalm of David blessed of
[39:38] the hues transgression is forgiven whose
[39:39] sin is covered
[39:40] blessed is the man to whom the lord
[39:42] imputeth not iniquity in other words
[39:45] counteth not iniquity and in whose
[39:48] spirit there is no God
[39:50] proverbs 16:6 this is how you take care
[39:53] of the whole problem by mercy and truth
[39:57] iniquity is purged you don't have to
[39:59] read anymore
[40:00] and by the fear of the Lord men depart
[40:04] from evil Jeremiah 33 7 and I will cause
[40:08] the captivity of Judah and the captivity
[40:10] of Israel to return and will build them
[40:11] as it was the first and I will cleanse
[40:14] them from all their iniquity whereby
[40:16] they have sinned against me and I will
[40:18] pardon all their iniquities whereby they
[40:22] have sinned and whereby they have
[40:23] transgressed against me Jeremiah 50 20
[40:27] in those days and then that time said
[40:29] the Lord the iniquity of Israel shall be
[40:31] sought for and there shall be none in
[40:35] the sins of Judah and they shall not be
[40:38] found for I will pardon them who I
[40:41] reserved now look that's done away with
[40:45] that the Bible tells us
[40:48] that it's done away with we just got to
[40:50] be able to take these things and apply
[40:52] to ourselves
[40:53] amen not apply to Israel hallelujah is
[40:56] was gonna be renamed
[40:57] how long Israel's iniquities gonna be
[40:59] purged but what am i - all they've got
[41:02] to be purged first before they get there
[41:05] hey man sir you and I are standing in
[41:07] the way we are we're standing in the way
[41:10] of Israel all right so now the mystery
[41:13] of iniquity is now become history we
[41:16] know where it's at we know where it come
[41:19] from where it's what is doing here and
[41:21] where it's going
[41:22] we should start to know now where we
[41:24] come from what we're doing here and
[41:26] where we're going it's always in those
[41:28] threes all right so now let's look again
[41:31] at the first seal symbols because we're
[41:35] gonna have to open this up a little bit
[41:36] more now remember don't see if I do this
[41:46] good cuz I think Bob asked a question
[41:50] about this and I'm gonna try to clarify
[41:53] it a little bit now this is the church
[41:55] ages right everybody got that this is
[41:57] one two three four five six seven
[42:00] all right now
[42:13] all right the wild horse rider started
[42:15] in the first Street Church ages riding
[42:19] now right okay this is in now this is
[42:23] tight because you got to pull it back to
[42:24] me and you we got to see this just like
[42:27] we did the onion peel because remember
[42:30] and I think I preached it a long time
[42:32] ago about the the three stages of of
[42:36] grace before you get to the pyramid and
[42:39] then whoops sorry and then three stages
[42:42] here and then three stages here just
[42:46] like now we're gonna read a quote we
[42:47] listen if you listen to the tape why are
[42:49] my people some tossed about this
[42:51] justification this justification and
[42:53] this justification are the same but
[42:55] different
[42:59] that's stages all right this one right
[43:03] here doesn't get you redeemed can you
[43:06] see that the bottom one the one before
[43:08] you get up to faith it doesn't redeem
[43:11] you if I got that saying man if you
[43:14] don't say Oh me okay but that's what
[43:18] we're going to talk about because look
[43:20] we got it we got to type this whole
[43:22] thing out now watch I'm over here all
[43:26] right look we got church age one two
[43:29] three four five six seven all right we
[43:32] got seal number one two three four five
[43:35] six seven
[43:36] all right now you because that's this is
[43:38] where you got it's really confusing but
[43:40] if you'll listen it should bring some
[43:43] clarity to what we're talking about
[43:44] because this one tops the first church
[43:46] this first three ages top to first seal
[43:49] all right this would be the second seal
[43:56] all right
[43:58] this would be the third and this would
[44:03] be the the fourth in talking because
[44:08] look on the fourth seal we take a
[44:11] rapture
[44:13] we take a rapture here we don't take it
[44:16] in the 4th church age but now but now
[44:18] wait a minute
[44:19] back up here to the Latin again because
[44:28] the rapture takes place around here on
[44:30] the fourth seal anybody got that
[44:34] everybody if you say ma'am a man
[44:37] okay but do you understand that really
[44:41] we topped the four that we talked to
[44:44] seals and I said that wrong but you have
[44:46] to take it right first seal first you
[44:50] come back the first horse rider
[44:51] one two three four because remember five
[44:53] six and seven is totally to Israel but
[44:58] we get the spiritual application one
[45:00] through four one two three four the
[45:05] rapture takes place on the fourth on the
[45:06] fourth seal but we're in the seven
[45:09] churches that's where people get
[45:12] confused no don't be confused just
[45:15] follow just for a minute because look we
[45:17] got to look at justification
[45:20] sanctification now not in the church age
[45:23] here we got it look no wait
[45:25] holy ghost and the word now this is to
[45:29] me and you not the Church ages
[45:31] me and you remember four deaf messengers
[45:34] eat it down for life messengers have to
[45:36] bring it back which is justification
[45:39] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[45:41] and the word okay there by God then say
[45:46] Amen that's why the rapture brother Bram
[45:48] to the rapture to the plates on the
[45:49] fourth silk up there's no more combat
[45:50] beef come and see come and see come and
[45:54] see come and see I looked right come and
[45:58] see come and see come and see anything
[45:59] John said I looked and saw a group I'm
[46:03] paraphrasing but we'll get into it I saw
[46:04] a group but if the rapture takes place
[46:09] obviously it's going to take place out
[46:12] of the seven churches not in the fourth
[46:15] fourth Church ages over but the four
[46:19] seals when the rapture takes place so I
[46:22] explained this downstairs so you just
[46:24] kind of have to listen for a minute
[46:25] because then we'll start in the
[46:27] we're gonna take the three stages cuz
[46:28] you got you got justification safety
[46:31] cage Baptist hold off in the word then
[46:32] we come right back out to the court and
[46:34] do the same thing justification
[46:37] sanctification and the Holy Ghost and
[46:39] then we go up in a rapture that okay I
[46:46] know some of you looking across ah but
[46:48] that's okay we'll explain now I'm trying
[46:49] to I'm getting ahead but I want to show
[46:51] you them when we talk about
[46:52] justification today we're going to be
[46:55] talking about three different types done
[46:59] all right three different types of
[47:00] justification y'all have heard this
[47:03] since 1982 so don't be surprised okay if
[47:08] you're surprised you didn't listen then
[47:10] sorry I mean they'll preach this
[47:12] 30-something years ago all right so look
[47:17] now let's go back to where we started
[47:27] because look when brother Brown is on
[47:29] why my people so talked about he takes
[47:31] him into the inner court now we're gonna
[47:33] read it I saw something yesterday
[47:35] reading he took him into the Holy of
[47:37] Holies brought him back out now brother
[47:39] Del's already said that I want you to
[47:41] watch where brother Brown said yes they
[47:43] already have eternal life puts them
[47:46] right back in the out of court okay
[47:49] that's what we're gonna talk about here
[47:53] it's the three stages you got
[47:55] justification I don't know what spell it
[47:58] then you got justification number two
[48:01] number one and number three done all
[48:07] right and I'm going to read it to you in
[48:11] another couple hours in the invisible
[48:16] Union rather Bram covers the whole thing
[48:18] covers every bit of indivisible Union
[48:20] brings it all out because see this
[48:21] justification puts you what it Trump's
[48:25] off your past sin right does nothing for
[48:28] your nature
[48:30] now you can't apply that to this one
[48:33] because your nature's already been
[48:35] changed
[48:36] your old man's already dead
[48:39] you're going through a justified
[48:41] condition that's taken in this outside
[48:43] man the the spiritual party of the
[48:47] memories and conscience section
[48:48] imagination remember there's only faith
[48:51] in doubt in the soul faithful that you
[48:54] either born-again E or not there's no
[48:56] heading toward something unless you're
[48:59] truly justified tell this to work of the
[49:01] Holy Ghost is like we were talking about
[49:03] last night listen if you're justified it
[49:06] had to be God do it you can't justify
[49:11] yourself he had to be the one that
[49:14] justified you but now remember if you
[49:16] continue on in that condition that same
[49:19] root of evil is still there and you're
[49:21] just as black as everything brother
[49:24] Graham says sure if you die you'll go to
[49:26] heaven he'd say his bride and he didn't
[49:30] say five years later you still drinking
[49:32] smoking gambling and running around
[49:32] women either you lost something
[49:35] somewhere but God was just that's why
[49:39] it's called justification God is just to
[49:41] chop off this blackness back that way
[49:44] never to remember that no more makes a
[49:47] lot of people walking around in a
[49:49] justified condition that God has truly
[49:53] forgive them of their past forgive them
[49:57] of their past it's done guys not gonna
[50:00] ever bring that back up but now the next
[50:02] day you start he's going to bring that
[50:05] back up because that's going to be a
[50:06] recorder I didn't see that till I was
[50:09] reading because remember God gives us a
[50:12] schoolmaster to bring us to Christ but
[50:17] after that school masters finished we'll
[50:20] read it they'll be ok with that
[50:25] so this justification will not get you
[50:28] in the body it chops off your past sins
[50:32] if you die hey listen glod himself
[50:36] hanging on the cross he had to instantly
[50:39] forgive a thief a liar he could have
[50:41] been a murderer forgive him of every bit
[50:44] of his past there was no way he's gonna
[50:46] come off the cross and do anything else
[50:47] but he said you'll be with me in
[50:50] paradise now only God can do that
[50:53] because he walked her white we're
[50:55] talking about white we're trying to get
[50:57] to white righteous because for them to
[51:00] have a white horse in that first church
[51:03] age of the first seal was a white horse
[51:05] and an imposter there had to be a mirror
[51:09] image of a white righteous church on
[51:11] earth because Satan cannot originate he
[51:15] has to impersonate alright so there had
[51:18] to be a white righteous church in those
[51:22] first three Church ages that's why I
[51:32] like what brother Dale said the other
[51:34] day and I never even thought about it
[51:36] Adam didn't have to go through just okay
[51:38] thanks again he had nothing in this
[51:45] package to him part of the Holy Ghost to
[51:50] it but after that iniquity came on the
[51:54] scene a record keeper started the law
[51:58] recorded everything they did he said all
[52:01] the Lord it know the law happened when
[52:03] God said you need to make a sacrifice
[52:04] and Adam I believe Adam instituted all
[52:08] that he got it from God I believe God
[52:10] quit talking to Adam after he'd after
[52:12] the fall do you do you I don't know I
[52:14] don't think God quit talking to Adam he
[52:17] just couldn't talk to him face to face
[52:19] and then got it so gone so out of my
[52:25] losses guardship of the earth but he
[52:28] didn't lose his guard ship and then the
[52:32] Bible still tells you in the Book of
[52:33] Luke that Adam was the Sun God you can't
[52:36] deny that
[52:38] he was a son of God but he lost his
[52:41] inheritance of bringing me and you here
[52:44] with no sin he lost the spoken word he
[52:47] couldn't speak to the tree and it move
[52:50] he couldn't speak to this but when the
[52:53] second Adam come I gotta quit okay go
[52:57] preach about this alright but when it's
[53:00] not gonna have him come what do you do
[53:01] he brought him biking and now in the end
[53:03] of time he's bringing it all
[53:05] where you and I are now born by the
[53:09] spoken word of God
[53:14] so the first justification in this time
[53:20] today do you understand me because
[53:22] remember that first form of
[53:23] justification the Bible says the just
[53:25] shall live by faith Martin Luther took
[53:26] that brother Brown said he preached it
[53:29] but remember when he went off the scene
[53:31] the Lutheran's took it and went into a
[53:34] denomination with it Luther never did
[53:38] you got that but that put him in the
[53:43] body but remember that was all we had to
[53:46] work with the just shall live by faith
[53:50] because we won't cover something in a
[53:52] little while
[53:53] where Paul it looks like Paul stands up
[53:56] and says one thing and James stands up
[53:58] about justification and then James comes
[54:01] up and he says something looks like
[54:02] totally opposite now you can't put both
[54:04] of them and the eternal Word of God and
[54:06] be different that's one of them where
[54:11] you have to go
[54:12] that can't happen in you move it out of
[54:13] the way and you got to get a revelation
[54:14] of what's going on because Paul said
[54:17] Abraham was justified by faith James
[54:20] says you're justified by your works it's
[54:24] very simple Paul's talking about being
[54:29] justified by faith James is talking
[54:33] about being justified by your work he
[54:36] was preaching on the statue of a perfect
[54:37] man he just didn't know how to name it
[54:39] that a man took it that way then you put
[54:43] it right then this justification is
[54:45] right but not today this justification
[54:51] is what here we'll talk about that and
[54:56] then there's a justification up here
[54:59] where you have to know that the real you
[55:02] didn't do it you have to know that and
[55:05] that you didn't come from Charles and
[55:08] Ella Brandenburg Samuel Peggy Dale and
[55:12] then so there's your three stages of
[55:14] justification the real you need it
[55:17] you know you did you were there
[55:21] you get condensed ill-gotten condemned
[55:23] listen and then when you bring it to God
[55:25] don't ever bring a pie sin to God if
[55:27] you've already been asked forgiveness
[55:28] lung why cuz he's gonna go he's gonna go
[55:32] I always says that she's got white slate
[55:36] right there what sins are you talking
[55:39] about
[55:40] now listen if you're truly justified and
[55:43] went on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:47] now that's what I'm talking about now
[55:48] alright cuz that's this justification
[55:50] you're already being in the inner court
[55:53] I mean you've already been in the Holy
[55:55] of Holies
[55:56] but God brings you right back out to the
[55:59] outer court because remember in type
[56:05] when you go into the Holy of Holies
[56:08] remember the the thing drops down and
[56:11] it's the light of God you're in the
[56:12] Shekinah glory there's no daylight
[56:14] there's no dark there's no gloom you eat
[56:17] the manna and it stays in there stays
[56:20] fresh
[56:21] remember there's manna outside but they
[56:23] had to swap it every day I read it
[56:26] brother bran was talking about the other
[56:27] day
[56:27] I believe was in travail where he said
[56:31] yeah you can eat that bread on the
[56:32] outside same shoe brand a man eats on
[56:36] the inside but if you let this stay if
[56:40] we get wiggle tails got you a perfect
[56:45] man but you go into the Holy of Holies
[56:48] everything drops but now remember did
[56:54] all your problems go away come on people
[56:58] let's be honest today in the mid all
[57:01] your problems go away when you got the
[57:02] new birth no cuz you know why God picked
[57:05] you up and put you right back out in the
[57:07] outer Court and you gonna have sunny
[57:09] days you're gonna have rainy days you're
[57:10] gonna have gloomy days but he's gonna
[57:13] show you how to handle it that's the
[57:15] whole thing until I told you my love day
[57:18] I said coming to church will not prevent
[57:20] your problems but it will teach you how
[57:22] to solve
[57:24] and how to handle them we must have each
[57:30] other to get my hey man but he brings
[57:35] you back out and yeah look that's what
[57:37] things are for hey look at that
[57:39] that's after you're born again you need
[57:43] temperance for what that day when
[57:47] somebody thought you're towing you don't
[57:49] move it real quick right alright so
[57:58] that's what we're going to talk about
[57:59] today we're not going to talk about baby
[58:01] for me justification because see if
[58:03] you're if we're get into the revealing
[58:05] of the sales brother L told you the
[58:06] other day we get into the revealing of
[58:07] the seals you if you're not born again
[58:10] you you you're not you're you're not
[58:12] even in the ballgame okay
[58:18] you're just an observer you're just an
[58:21] observer you're just observing that's
[58:22] what the problem out of people out there
[58:24] just observers well that looks good
[58:27] what I said about in some of the other
[58:29] day we were talking about it look he
[58:31] that overcometh you those things in our
[58:33] life that we don't we wonder what in the
[58:35] world is here for it's for you to
[58:37] overcome coming to churches and
[58:42] overcoming victory it is actually three
[58:50] times a week
[58:51] amen so baby form justification chopped
[58:56] off your past sin now when we read these
[58:59] scriptures I want you to think about
[59:00] these three stages now this
[59:01] justification will talk about way later
[59:03] on because remember when you come over
[59:05] to the fifth seal God justified a group
[59:08] of people that never even knew he
[59:09] existed never knew he existed a fifth
[59:15] seal Jew that denied him actually never
[59:19] live the life for him but he justified
[59:23] them because they held one testimony go
[59:29] over and asking you today who are you
[59:31] I'm a Jew I'm God's people God said this
[59:34] about me now they're Old Testament
[59:36] they've already messed know
[59:37] they've already missed the justifier
[59:39] when he was on earth and coming back in
[59:42] their soul but he still said I'll never
[59:45] forget Israel a fifth sealed you that
[59:49] cared nothing about it this it gives
[59:52] nothing about God this is contrary in
[59:58] every way to the way you should have
[1:00:01] come
[1:00:02] totally country this is not it but he's
[1:00:06] going to use this to bring it right back
[1:00:11] through flesh we fell through flesh
[1:00:14] we're gonna come back
[1:00:16] our problem is wish all this old pest
[1:00:19] house and I know that's true
[1:00:21] I've got quotes but something's got to
[1:00:24] keep this inside man together and you
[1:00:26] know what something's got to justify God
[1:00:29] raising from the dead in a body that was
[1:00:32] going to corrupt that all right so he
[1:00:39] was raised for our justification those
[1:00:42] who he has justified he is already
[1:00:45] glorified that's number three those who
[1:00:51] he is justified he's already going bud
[1:00:54] here is your glorified condition right
[1:00:57] here he's going to change something that
[1:01:00] should have never come here to start
[1:01:01] with amen
[1:01:04] he's going to give the eternal life in
[1:01:06] the fifth seal for a group that he
[1:01:08] should never care one thing about
[1:01:10] because they cared nothing for him
[1:01:12] right a fifth seal Jew it's not safe Jew
[1:01:15] I want y'all that we're going to get to
[1:01:17] that but a fifth sealed you it's not a
[1:01:18] saved person right the field you is not
[1:01:22] a saved person denied Jesus Christ
[1:01:26] you'd think now look don't buy the
[1:01:29] justification you think the Bible says
[1:01:32] you turned me down I'm gonna turn you
[1:01:34] turn me down you deny me on this earth
[1:01:37] I'll deny you in heaven you think man
[1:01:40] they're judged but the righteous judge
[1:01:45] blinding the eyes
[1:01:48] so that you and I could come in he's the
[1:01:51] only one that can do that and he don't
[1:01:56] have to look in a rulebook
[1:01:57] he made the rule but it is in continuity
[1:02:02] with the way is that all rights a man
[1:02:05] all right to feel any charge the garden
[1:02:11] elect is he who what justify we're gonna
[1:02:15] read that so let's read something about
[1:02:16] justification is that Alright so the
[1:02:19] first seal let's go back we're still in
[1:02:21] the first seal so we got a blind horse
[1:02:23] rider
[1:02:25] we got a bow
[1:02:31] so remember look all he done when he
[1:02:34] went to Nicaea is he took that pretense
[1:02:38] of religion to those people at Nicaea
[1:02:42] and he said isn't this pretty
[1:02:45] I got the prettiest bow and man I
[1:02:48] believe it's accurate but they didn't
[1:02:52] check to see what power he had behind it
[1:02:55] because he had no power behind it
[1:02:58] what'd he do he got in this in the
[1:03:00] saying we were talking like last Sunday
[1:03:01] it was a saying one out
[1:03:02] it started to say anything good to you
[1:03:08] well yeah sound good to me never didn't
[1:03:10] have nothing go on right that sounds
[1:03:15] good to me let you know if Jesus was
[1:03:18] talking to the Father they must have
[1:03:19] been at least two then he said he was
[1:03:22] gonna sin he said he was gonna send a
[1:03:24] comforter he's gonna send a hog well
[1:03:26] there's three amen I mean that's how I
[1:03:33] got started
[1:03:34] cuz you sit in it for years those of you
[1:03:38] that were in denominations you sat in it
[1:03:40] for years you accepted it as absolute
[1:03:43] gospel come from heaven truth right you
[1:03:49] didn't think you're getting for the
[1:03:50] devil did you you know go the Baptist
[1:03:52] Church and say well I think that's
[1:03:54] coming from the devil they'll throw you
[1:03:56] out
[1:04:00] but it did God never brought these
[1:04:06] doctrines that our fault god can't bring
[1:04:08] a false doctrine so it had to be that
[1:04:11] writer with a bow and power was given
[1:04:13] why through the people to start eating
[1:04:18] the word down none all right let's read
[1:04:22] this now
[1:04:23] the first time the word just is ever
[1:04:25] used in the Bible it talks about Noah
[1:04:29] watch these are the generations of Noah
[1:04:32] Noah was a just man
[1:04:34] and perfect in his generation now look
[1:04:37] he wouldn't be perfect in this
[1:04:38] generation he died a drunk but he was a
[1:04:45] just man in his generation see how God
[1:04:48] placed it got place that he was just in
[1:04:49] his generation
[1:04:50] all right and Noah walked with God now
[1:04:55] look let's look at the Hebrew lexicon
[1:04:59] and just read some of these but look
[1:05:01] what pops up most of the time I look at
[1:05:04] the words it pops up over and over again
[1:05:06] righteous righteous righteous righteous
[1:05:10] right correct lawful as justified and
[1:05:15] vindicated by God now see you can't
[1:05:18] justify yourself but God can justify you
[1:05:22] and it's the finished work because it
[1:05:24] was a finished work to Martin Luther in
[1:05:25] his time because look we can read go
[1:05:29] back to them to the scripture before
[1:05:32] these are the generations of Martin
[1:05:34] Luther Martin Luther was a just man and
[1:05:36] perfect in his generation right yeah
[1:05:42] Wesley you put anybody in there okay so
[1:05:46] that's why I was thinking the other day
[1:05:47] who was it said Oh Bob said Wednesday
[1:05:50] night I go back to that quote where
[1:05:51] brother Raymond anybody ever shot a
[1:05:53] roman candle so this is the way God
[1:05:55] works
[1:05:56] he tells brother branham he says tell
[1:05:58] the people that are revelations like a
[1:06:00] roman candle but you got to remember a
[1:06:02] roman candle has eight balls when one
[1:06:06] goes out it goes off and gives off eight
[1:06:08] more well those eight give off eight
[1:06:11] more
[1:06:12] well those eight give off eight more and
[1:06:14] if you were mathematician you'd be up
[1:06:15] into the millions before you knew it or
[1:06:17] the way one pops and blows up and now
[1:06:19] remember it only it only explodes what
[1:06:24] powers behind it but when you got the
[1:06:28] eternal Word of God that's why it's
[1:06:29] eternal when you see this and you go
[1:06:31] well that was just no one know you put
[1:06:33] it put put Martin Luther because he was
[1:06:36] just imperfect in his generation but
[1:06:38] he's not perfect in this generation
[1:06:41] right all right so now let's go to the
[1:06:44] let's go to the lexicon again this is
[1:06:48] the next one to be just to be righteous
[1:06:50] to have a just cause to be in the right
[1:06:53] to be justified to be just of God to be
[1:06:56] right just a righteous and conduct
[1:06:58] curtain to look that's why brother
[1:07:01] Branham said he said in the statue of a
[1:07:07] perfect man that some people have these
[1:07:10] qualities and they're not born again
[1:07:12] well you can you can be a there's a lot
[1:07:15] of people that are adjustment just that
[1:07:17] are just people good people righteous
[1:07:20] take somebody that goes into a monastery
[1:07:23] he's never let simply this way he's
[1:07:26] never had carnality in his mind of a
[1:07:29] woman or of any understand he's just
[1:07:32] pure as he can be he's just but he's
[1:07:36] only just in his own eyes he's just in
[1:07:40] what there's one here somewhere where it
[1:07:42] says in the law it may been bite before
[1:07:44] but that's fine you can be just in the
[1:07:46] law you can never get a speeding ticket
[1:07:51] never get a you know other words never
[1:07:53] been in a courtroom and you gonna die
[1:07:59] and go to hell if you don't know Jesus
[1:08:00] Christ as your Savior right but you're a
[1:08:02] just man in your ways or in the law of
[1:08:06] the land but in the law of God that
[1:08:09] brings in more cuz you got to accept him
[1:08:12] as your Savior you got to accept what he
[1:08:14] done all right now right there it is in
[1:08:17] a minute to do to bring justice in
[1:08:18] administering law to declare righteous
[1:08:21] and you keep going through that so
[1:08:22] everybody should know that justification
[1:08:24] means
[1:08:25] that it's ripeness okay right this being
[1:08:30] right it's at least you're going in the
[1:08:32] right direction okay because remember
[1:08:35] those who is justified is already
[1:08:37] glorified because baby form
[1:08:38] justification are number one
[1:08:39] justification you can't rule it out it's
[1:08:42] a work of God if not then it is done by
[1:08:45] man and you have no justification except
[1:08:49] for what the law said because remember
[1:08:51] keep this point in mind when you go to
[1:08:54] revelations whenever it is 20 when
[1:08:56] everybody when the books are open and
[1:08:58] what are they done they are what they
[1:09:01] are judged by their works please don't
[1:09:06] ever let me be judged by my work I stand
[1:09:11] just in him and I'm gonna let him
[1:09:15] declare my justification then all right
[1:09:19] see where these things you can take one
[1:09:21] single just tie the Bible together and
[1:09:23] you can talk about anything in the world
[1:09:26] the listener you turn the Word of God
[1:09:28] all right keep going to 666 for the next
[1:09:35] one look around here this is what I want
[1:09:37] you to see it's actually one of God's
[1:09:41] after being right see that it's actually
[1:09:46] one of God's after being right it's to
[1:09:49] justify if he if he raised with no
[1:09:53] justification that was his attribute he
[1:09:56] came to justify you
[1:09:59] so it was an attribute of God the saving
[1:10:03] attribute of God and I like this one
[1:10:06] deliverance of God as a covenant-keeping
[1:10:10] in Redemption of people enjoying
[1:10:15] salvation hey man you heard that word
[1:10:18] salvation somebody been preaching on it
[1:10:20] a little bit yeah potentially but of
[1:10:26] people enjoying salvation I like that
[1:10:30] when I was there v 45 21
[1:10:35] tell you and bring them there yeah yay
[1:10:37] let them take counsel together who have
[1:10:40] declared this from ancient time who have
[1:10:43] told it from that time have not I the
[1:10:46] Lord and there is no God else beside me
[1:10:49] now look we're gonna layer this again
[1:10:51] and we're gonna see how that first seal
[1:10:53] shows one true and living God but we're
[1:10:56] not gonna get that to today we're gonna
[1:10:57] stay on justification but look there's
[1:10:59] no God else beside me ain't just God and
[1:11:03] the savior there is none beside me
[1:11:07] because remember that's one thing that
[1:11:10] Israel you won't ever take Israel it's a
[1:11:13] Trinity the children of Israel the good
[1:11:18] Orthodox Jew you can't cut him up
[1:11:20] brother man I'm told he met that he met
[1:11:23] that Rebbe on that robot says you can't
[1:11:25] go God up into three pieces and give it
[1:11:27] to a Jew at least they have that part
[1:11:29] correct
[1:11:31] maybe that's what God's gonna justify do
[1:11:34] they believe in one God well we all the
[1:11:36] whole world believes in the Trinity
[1:11:42] there's none besides me look unto me and
[1:11:45] be saved all the ends of the earth where
[1:11:46] I am God and there is none else all
[1:11:50] right I was at 53 11 he shall see the
[1:11:53] travail of his soul and shall be
[1:11:55] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[1:11:57] righteous servant justify many for he
[1:12:02] shall bear their iniquity so I brother
[1:12:05] Brent said don't ever forget Calvary
[1:12:06] don't ever forget Calvary Calvary is
[1:12:09] where all this was done because who is
[1:12:11] that he that he's gone in human flesh
[1:12:14] Jesus Christ he what he sees the travail
[1:12:17] the soul and shall be satisfied in other
[1:12:19] words what he done to be to pass justice
[1:12:22] means to satisfy listen live to pass
[1:12:26] justice means to satisfy the law he's
[1:12:31] all word under the law come on people we
[1:12:35] read the book okay it's a love letter to
[1:12:39] us right but it's a law it's written but
[1:12:43] it's what does you do when a when a
[1:12:45] judge says
[1:12:47] case closed what that do that satisfies
[1:12:50] right that satisfies the law it's you
[1:12:54] and you know what even in an even in the
[1:12:56] laws of this land you can't bring that
[1:12:59] back up again so it's put in the cell
[1:13:02] forgetfulness never be remembered or
[1:13:05] brought up again listen God will never
[1:13:08] bring your sins by good
[1:13:10] if anybody brings your sins by compass
[1:13:13] the devil because he seems to not have
[1:13:16] amnesia like that but that's his job you
[1:13:19] know why cause he was there helping you
[1:13:21] do it but by his knowledge shall my
[1:13:25] righteous servant justify many for he
[1:13:28] shall bear their iniquity in the look
[1:13:30] that man bore the iniquity of us all
[1:13:32] right we just got accepted right acts 13
[1:13:38] let's get into the book of Acts and then
[1:13:40] we're gonna get into Romans and land
[1:13:42] Romans is where Paul nails it acts 13
[1:13:46] being on to you therefore many brothers
[1:13:48] that through this man is preached unto
[1:13:50] you the forgiveness of sins and by him
[1:13:53] all that believe are justified from all
[1:13:57] things from which you could not be
[1:14:01] justified by the law of Moses because
[1:14:05] the law of Moses like brother Dale said
[1:14:07] the law of Moses you you gonna commit a
[1:14:09] sin right are you and have taken lamb
[1:14:14] left there you didn't just look
[1:14:15] offensive well here's a lamb I ain't
[1:14:17] done anything this year no when you went
[1:14:20] up and put that lamb up a you you said
[1:14:22] free stuff you know I had a brother uh
[1:14:25] I stole if this I committed adultery I
[1:14:28] did this I did this so what that covered
[1:14:30] it it didn't do away with it it covered
[1:14:32] it so that wasn't justified because they
[1:14:36] did it and there was a record of him
[1:14:39] doing it so you couldn't be justified by
[1:14:43] the law of Moses but by him all that
[1:14:47] believer justified from all things when
[1:14:52] he died at Calvary it was all done there
[1:14:57] we know that right
[1:14:59] Romans 1 verse 16 where I'm not ashamed
[1:15:02] of the gospel of Christ where this is
[1:15:04] the power of God 1 unto salvation to
[1:15:07] everyone that believeth so remember this
[1:15:09] even this whole series we're gonna do
[1:15:12] you're gonna have to have faith in what
[1:15:14] God's already said amen you gotta have
[1:15:21] faith you gotta believe that it's for
[1:15:23] you oh that was for the Prophet they
[1:15:27] might have been some things for him but
[1:15:29] that Bible wasn't written just for him
[1:15:30] it become a brand-new book to us when it
[1:15:33] opened amen
[1:15:35] didn't it not did it not how many times
[1:15:39] he be like I said how many times you
[1:15:40] read in the book or you've written are
[1:15:41] you listened to tape so you've written
[1:15:42] even read the Bible and said well I just
[1:15:45] read that last week it wasn't in their
[1:15:47] lifetime well I'm gonna read you this in
[1:15:50] Romans 3:19 and this is exactly where
[1:15:53] brother Branham gets that justification
[1:15:55] chops off you'll pay saying cuz you
[1:15:57] didn't see it on any of that I showed
[1:15:59] you the whole definition because just
[1:16:01] means to be right is that word about
[1:16:05] chopping off your pace in but the
[1:16:07] Prophet told us that's what that form of
[1:16:09] justification was right Romans 1 verse
[1:16:12] 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel
[1:16:14] for the power of God unto salvation to
[1:16:16] everyone that believeth to the Jew first
[1:16:18] and then also to the Greek for therein
[1:16:20] is the righteousness of God what
[1:16:22] revealed from faith to faith and is
[1:16:25] written the just shall live by faith
[1:16:30] listen that's why the first stage of
[1:16:35] justification
[1:16:36] you've got to solely believe that God
[1:16:40] cut your sins off because you won't
[1:16:44] the next day you're going to remember
[1:16:46] the same thing you did three days ago
[1:16:49] but he's just to forgive your past sin
[1:16:55] you got to believe it and then go on coz
[1:16:59] think some people won't believe it in
[1:17:01] what they just fall right back out right
[1:17:03] ball right back out of the court don't
[1:17:05] even go into next ones brother grandma I
[1:17:07] think I got in here we said man are
[1:17:08] going they're out of court and he just
[1:17:10] won't go any further
[1:17:12] that's what people are same way when you
[1:17:15] get into the second stage of
[1:17:16] justification go as far as you want tune
[1:17:20] in stop you will listen to this one
[1:17:26] brother Brian said justification chopped
[1:17:29] off your past sin right now that's a
[1:17:32] quote several quotes man 25 quotes or 30
[1:17:35] or morally said that verbatim
[1:17:37] justification chops off your past sin
[1:17:40] but the root of evil are the one that
[1:17:42] made you do it is still there all right
[1:17:44] so let's read here romans 3:19 now we
[1:17:49] know that what thing soever the law
[1:17:52] saith now you're gonna have to fall upon
[1:17:54] it says to them who are under the law
[1:17:57] that every mouth may be stopped and all
[1:18:00] the world may become guilty before God
[1:18:02] what does the law do makes you guilty a
[1:18:04] man you being born in sin shaping in
[1:18:07] iniquity is passing about your bored
[1:18:09] guilty I was guilty with nothing but I'm
[1:18:14] used to saying it something with nothing
[1:18:16] to say I was guilty I don't want to get
[1:18:19] this to where I was born with us always
[1:18:21] eternal thing I've born dead that's why
[1:18:27] they call it a new birth guilty now look
[1:18:36] justify justification or just our our a
[1:18:40] justifier has to look to a law to a
[1:18:44] degree you understand he's got to look
[1:18:46] to something to judge you by so we're
[1:18:49] all judged guilty before God and what's
[1:18:53] Paul but now what I love Paul because
[1:18:55] he'll put you in Hell nin and take you
[1:18:57] back out
[1:18:57] I mean he'll plea up say look we're
[1:19:00] guilty we're done for but listen
[1:19:02] therefore by the deeds of the law there
[1:19:05] shall no flesh be justified any sight
[1:19:07] now he's absolutely correct for by the
[1:19:11] law is the knowledge of sin but now the
[1:19:15] righteousness of God without the law now
[1:19:18] look look that word up without I didn't
[1:19:22] think I was gonna take you know I
[1:19:24] thought I had second service and I don't
[1:19:25] take about a nine
[1:19:25] but now I got a couple hours so we're
[1:19:27] gonna explain this look up that word
[1:19:29] without that doesn't mean going away
[1:19:32] with without that means outside of
[1:19:37] because look but the righteousness of
[1:19:39] God outside the law is manifested being
[1:19:43] witnessed by the law and the prophets so
[1:19:46] it's not saying without the law don't
[1:19:48] you know do away with without know
[1:19:49] that's being without on the outside
[1:19:52] right cuz I looked it up I just didn't
[1:19:55] bring it even the righteousness of God
[1:19:58] which is by faith no here we go by faith
[1:20:00] of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all
[1:20:04] them that believe for there's no
[1:20:06] difference for we have all sinned and
[1:20:09] have there seen in us and we're all
[1:20:11] eternal my new contacts are much better
[1:20:19] than that we're all have sinned and come
[1:20:21] short of the glory of God Paul you push
[1:20:24] back in jail being justified freely by
[1:20:29] His grace through the redemption that is
[1:20:33] in Christ Jesus he's bringing it right
[1:20:35] back
[1:20:35] whom God has set forth to be a
[1:20:38] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[1:20:41] look to declare his righteousness for
[1:20:44] the remission of sins that are past
[1:20:48] there's your answer
[1:20:50] that's where brother brown pulls it out
[1:20:52] from I guarantee he read that scripture
[1:20:54] right there
[1:20:55] he didn't read it in the book you don't
[1:20:57] ever hear him read this scripture but
[1:20:59] like brother Dale said he's quote
[1:21:00] scripture 90% of what he's talking about
[1:21:02] the scripture and the enhancement of
[1:21:05] that but look to declare his
[1:21:07] righteousness for the remission of sins
[1:21:09] their past God chopped off your what
[1:21:13] past sin pretty simple I don't think
[1:21:18] they had that in there I think that just
[1:21:19] came I sent another Bible I got any vial
[1:21:22] I got any Bible say I'm just kidding it
[1:21:24] was always there through the forbearance
[1:21:29] of God to declare I say you know watch
[1:21:32] this he's not finished yet therefore I
[1:21:34] say at this time his righteousness
[1:21:38] that he might be just and the justifier
[1:21:41] of him that believeth in Jesus that's
[1:21:45] you justifier of him us which believeth
[1:21:54] in Jesus where is boasting then it is
[1:21:58] excluded what I did this I'm just in my
[1:22:05] own eyes by what law of works
[1:22:12] nay but by the law of faith and there is
[1:22:17] a law of faith if you believe this it'll
[1:22:19] happen therefore we conclude that here's
[1:22:22] here's Paul summation I conclude we
[1:22:24] conclude that a man is justified by
[1:22:27] faith without the deeds of the law
[1:22:31] alright cuz remember we're gonna read it
[1:22:35] in a minute where Paul tells us the laws
[1:22:37] of schoolmaster to bring us to Christ
[1:22:38] but what is he the god of the Jews only
[1:22:41] is he not also of the Gentiles yes of
[1:22:46] the Gentiles also seeing it is one God
[1:22:49] he got to get to one God in there seeing
[1:22:52] is one God we shall justify the
[1:22:55] circumcision by faith that's the
[1:22:59] circumcision that's the Jew and us
[1:23:03] through faith because we didn't believe
[1:23:06] we were not believers we weren't born
[1:23:09] believers I don't believe you going to
[1:23:13] believer but through faith the
[1:23:20] uncircumcision through faith we're all
[1:23:24] going to see the same thing seeing these
[1:23:26] one God we shall justify the
[1:23:29] circumcision by faith and the
[1:23:30] uncircumcision through faith do we then
[1:23:34] make void the law through faith God
[1:23:36] forbid he's not nothing you know he's
[1:23:37] not doing that the clicking
[1:23:49] let's do that
[1:23:51] well buy that that better give me a
[1:23:55] phone sorry
[1:23:56] god forbid yeah we established the law
[1:24:00] so we can't get away from the law
[1:24:04] there's a law everywhere you go man we
[1:24:09] were born under the law jesus christ is
[1:24:11] born under the law but when we receive
[1:24:13] him we remembered Christ didn't come do
[1:24:16] away with the law he come to give us
[1:24:18] what he was the lawgiver he gave us a
[1:24:21] law of life to live by not a law of do's
[1:24:26] and don'ts I think Paul said of carnal
[1:24:29] comparisons and all these things I'm
[1:24:31] quoting scripture but right there the
[1:24:33] sins that are past I love that that's
[1:24:35] where I believe brother Branham got that
[1:24:37] so remember let's go to Romans 8:29
[1:24:40] remember justice was served at Calvary
[1:24:46] the just died for the unjust which made
[1:24:50] all of us just that exception not the
[1:24:54] whole world so we're going to read it
[1:24:57] right here not the whole world Paul
[1:24:59] continues when Romans 8:29 for whom he
[1:25:02] did foreknow he also did predestinate to
[1:25:04] be conformed to the image of his son
[1:25:06] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:25:07] many brethren moreover whom he did
[1:25:10] predestinate them he also caught he got
[1:25:13] called first and whom he called them you
[1:25:16] justified that's not what he says them
[1:25:19] he justified and whom he justified them
[1:25:25] he also glorified what shall we say then
[1:25:29] to these things if God be for us who can
[1:25:31] be against us he that spared not his own
[1:25:35] son but delivered him up for us all how
[1:25:38] shall he not with him also freely give
[1:25:41] us all things who shall lay anything to
[1:25:46] the charge of God's elect it is God that
[1:25:51] justified
[1:25:53] amen it is God that justified let's read
[1:26:00] first Corinthians 6 verse 9 hey all
[1:26:03] right
[1:26:04] hey man we doing all right no you're not
[1:26:07] that they're unrighteous shall not
[1:26:09] inherit the kingdom of God be not
[1:26:12] deceived now watch this I love this
[1:26:14] scripture be not deceived because
[1:26:18] somewhere in here we're all in this
[1:26:19] everybody sitting in this building be
[1:26:23] not deceived neither fornicators nor
[1:26:25] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate
[1:26:28] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[1:26:30] nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards
[1:26:33] nor revilers nor extortioners
[1:26:35] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[1:26:37] of God we're gone we're done we're
[1:26:38] finished right we're done I didn't put
[1:26:44] myself in one of them and you put
[1:26:45] yourself in one of them and we just
[1:26:47] might as well close the doors and go the
[1:26:49] house and such were some of you but ye
[1:26:57] are washed but ye are sanctified but ye
[1:27:02] are justified in the name of the Lord
[1:27:05] Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[1:27:07] there's your out give us a way out get
[1:27:12] us out of here Galatians 333 3:23 but
[1:27:18] before faith came we were kept under the
[1:27:20] law shut up unto the faith which should
[1:27:24] be after which should afterwards be
[1:27:25] revealed so remember look faith is a new
[1:27:29] birth but after faith has come we still
[1:27:32] got a revelation that's got to unfold
[1:27:38] wherefore the law was our schoolmaster
[1:27:41] to bring us to Christ that we might be
[1:27:47] justified by faith all right right here
[1:27:52] new birth justified by faith but now
[1:27:57] it's Paul stop no he says but after that
[1:28:02] faith is come
[1:28:04] we are no longer under a schoolmaster
[1:28:06] now that doesn't mean it's done away
[1:28:09] with it but we're not under that first
[1:28:12] part of being justified we're going on
[1:28:16] to perfection but after that faith has
[1:28:19] come we are no longer under school
[1:28:21] master for we're all the children of God
[1:28:22] by faith in Christ Jesus
[1:28:24] now that's right here we become children
[1:28:26] sons and daughters of God at faith at
[1:28:28] the bottom of the pyramid needs a new
[1:28:30] birth then we're going to read some
[1:28:34] quotes in a minute just what I said
[1:28:35] brother Brown it then says well now God
[1:28:37] just takes you out and puts you back out
[1:28:40] here and you start again because like I
[1:28:44] said before don't kid me don't kid you
[1:28:46] and please don't kid God my problems
[1:28:49] really began when I got born again the
[1:28:53] Waring Paul had a Waring and his members
[1:28:55] you and I have a Waring sure listen and
[1:28:59] brother branham I didn't bring him but
[1:29:01] that was three or four quotes for
[1:29:02] brother and says what are we worried
[1:29:04] about we're at rest your soul is at rest
[1:29:07] with God and it is but you know what we
[1:29:10] got to get to believe is that contrary
[1:29:13] part of us that part that wasn't so it's
[1:29:18] now attached to the one it is so that
[1:29:22] all right because remember we'll read it
[1:29:24] in a minute where brother mom explains
[1:29:26] it your old husband's dead he's dead he
[1:29:28] dies he leaves now not nothing not in
[1:29:33] baby form justification now not in this
[1:29:35] justification here he doesn't leave the
[1:29:38] old route of evil or the road root of
[1:29:40] bitterness the older damning nature
[1:29:42] still there right but now he's not when
[1:29:46] you go here cuz you're already you're
[1:29:48] dead the old man is dead but to be
[1:29:53] justified it's not in God that you did
[1:30:01] it and now you didn't cuz if you ever
[1:30:07] cease you're seeing one you're a goner
[1:30:09] right let me just put it in straight
[1:30:11] language you're a goner if you ever sees
[1:30:13] one saying you're nothing
[1:30:14] right that's why that those who he has
[1:30:19] justified lorry
[1:30:21] he's already glorified amen but now if
[1:30:25] you try to justify yourself and come to
[1:30:26] church and be a good person listen Judas
[1:30:28] was sanctified well we don't have time
[1:30:31] to cover that Judas was sanctified he
[1:30:33] lived in a justified and sanctified
[1:30:35] condition until you know what got
[1:30:37] chopped his past sins off but watch what
[1:30:41] he done he'd done the ultimate sin by
[1:30:43] not going on into the Holy of Holies our
[1:30:45] Pentecost not all right but after faith
[1:30:49] has come we're no longer on this coming
[1:30:51] you don't do away with him know that
[1:30:52] when you get into twelfth grade you
[1:30:54] don't do away with that my second grade
[1:30:56] teacher miss and I just remember because
[1:30:58] she helped me a lot but you know what I
[1:31:00] didn't drag her to the third grade I
[1:31:04] didn't say come on Miss and I need you
[1:31:06] in high school I need you in college
[1:31:08] miss ain't no you build on what she gave
[1:31:11] me so you build on what gave you that
[1:31:15] schoolmaster to bring you to Christ it's
[1:31:18] not that you do away with it you build
[1:31:21] on top of it that's why that foundation
[1:31:24] whines so so big of a foundation and
[1:31:27] then it gets more narrow more narrow
[1:31:28] more narrow all right well yeah we'll
[1:31:35] have to quit wearing these things I
[1:31:36] think right now okay okay now look
[1:31:53] remember the scripture we read and we'll
[1:31:56] look again let's not go back to them
[1:31:58] we'll just let's just leave read this
[1:31:59] enough quote number here because watch
[1:32:01] brother Brown Satan at my word 1953 now
[1:32:05] see now Paul was justifying Abraham by
[1:32:09] faith all right James justified him by
[1:32:13] works
[1:32:14] Paul said Abraham was justified Romans
[1:32:17] four by faith so James comes over and
[1:32:20] says that he was justified by work now
[1:32:23] both of them one confirmed the other
[1:32:27] now Paul was speaking what God saw comes
[1:32:33] remember those who is already just he's
[1:32:34] justified he's already only God can know
[1:32:38] whether you're gonna stop or not
[1:32:40] look he's not gonna glorify somebody he
[1:32:42] can't glorify you if you don't go all
[1:32:44] the way okay
[1:32:46] he can't he can't he he's just you know
[1:32:49] what he's just to do that but remember
[1:32:52] he's gonna pass justice at the white
[1:32:56] throne right he's gonna pass justice he
[1:33:00] is a just God
[1:33:01] hey man but if you get rid of it here
[1:33:05] man know what now Paul was speaking what
[1:33:09] God saw it's fake
[1:33:11] hail Abraham's faith James is speaking
[1:33:14] what man saw now watch man gonna see man
[1:33:18] is gonna see every one of these right
[1:33:23] that there is a work that was done but
[1:33:26] man is never going to see your baby form
[1:33:28] justification
[1:33:31] next up gone if you guys pass this
[1:33:33] chopped off yet he's still smoking
[1:33:35] drinking cussing doing right he's not
[1:33:37] showing an outward work but he's
[1:33:41] believing on - Abraham was believing on
[1:33:43] - but James is what man saw he's going
[1:33:48] right up the statue of a perfect man in
[1:33:50] 1955 go James is speaking what man saw
[1:33:56] what the outward appearance right I got
[1:34:00] faith in God and afraid to put your
[1:34:01] faith to work yeah then it won't do no
[1:34:05] good
[1:34:05] you got a launch out all right now let's
[1:34:10] go to number two now watch here's where
[1:34:13] one of my people so talks about 1956 now
[1:34:19] I think brother Dale read this but we're
[1:34:20] gonna read again we put in the context
[1:34:21] cuz remember the first seal the first
[1:34:24] thing we must see that we're justifying
[1:34:27] we're completely sinless in front of God
[1:34:32] if you're truly just about this form of
[1:34:37] justification how the first form you not
[1:34:39] even you know you're not your own
[1:34:40] you just barely in the building right
[1:34:42] right you barely in the building but now
[1:34:46] this watch here watch I want you to
[1:34:49] notice another thing about this the
[1:34:50] peculiar of the light the believer walks
[1:34:53] in when he's in Christ now watch when
[1:34:55] he's in Christ now the three courts the
[1:34:58] justified man out here he walks by
[1:35:01] daylight some day he has gloomy days you
[1:35:04] get it oh I hope you see this god bless
[1:35:06] you
[1:35:07] some days are gloomy some days you don't
[1:35:09] know whether it's really worthwhile to
[1:35:11] serve God or not now most of you have
[1:35:13] thought that even after your morning
[1:35:14] here most of you thought that this
[1:35:17] morning when you got up so we haven't
[1:35:20] got that part done away with yet hello
[1:35:25] someday I hope you see this god bless
[1:35:28] you some days are gloomy some days you
[1:35:30] don't know whether you're is really
[1:35:31] worth trying to serve God or not you're
[1:35:33] walking in the outer Court now watch
[1:35:35] sure you're eating manna sure you are a
[1:35:38] believer sure you have eternal life sure
[1:35:43] if you die you go to heaven truly but
[1:35:46] what kind of a life are you living it's
[1:35:54] pretty simple what kind of life are you
[1:35:57] living now who are you living that you
[1:35:59] live in that life so others can see look
[1:36:05] when you go back in that holy of holies
[1:36:06] that's you and God so you you've got to
[1:36:11] come back out it's only I guess the
[1:36:15] deductive reasoning it would be great to
[1:36:18] stay in that holy of holies the whole
[1:36:19] time but remember the priest one in
[1:36:22] there one time of year with the blood
[1:36:26] and then he had to go right back out hey
[1:36:29] man so if we stay in that holy of holies
[1:36:31] then you know what we won't be able to
[1:36:34] show the world nothing right come on
[1:36:36] people we won't be able to show the
[1:36:37] world nothing because remember the world
[1:36:40] couldn't see it before Jesus Christ
[1:36:43] but when Jesus came he was the holy of
[1:36:47] holies walking in from Sun screen
[1:36:50] walking in front of people right they
[1:36:52] knew he had brought down
[1:36:53] holy of holies right out I was walking
[1:36:55] yes that all right say man so that's
[1:36:59] what it is what kind of life are you
[1:37:01] living every day you get out of here
[1:37:03] now watch this oh I got my dandruff up
[1:37:07] today I told him about it I cussed him
[1:37:12] out I couldn't help it God forgive me
[1:37:16] sure he will certainly he will your
[1:37:19] child but what kind of life are you
[1:37:22] living now that temperance is in in the
[1:37:26] second form of justification that
[1:37:29] temperance is what you got to know the
[1:37:31] tech temperance is done away with look
[1:37:34] here's the key you're not justified in
[1:37:38] doing this wait a minute come on down
[1:37:41] this one um where I can point to that
[1:37:45] nope there you go you're not justified
[1:37:48] in doing that now you're justified under
[1:37:52] the Christian part you are you just
[1:37:54] fought under God but not can you fellow
[1:37:56] man remember brother Brown said you
[1:37:59] sinned against your wife he said you got
[1:38:00] to go to your wife God didn't do that
[1:38:02] you did it you gotta go to your wife or
[1:38:04] whoever it is God forgive me for for
[1:38:07] saying something bad about mark that's
[1:38:09] okay but I gotta go to mark and say
[1:38:11] brother mark
[1:38:12] see that ties that justified state where
[1:38:15] you know what cuz when he forgives me he
[1:38:18] can't ever bring it up again amen
[1:38:21] and if he's a true Christian he'll never
[1:38:23] let it bothering I'm telling you he'll
[1:38:25] never let it bothering now Satan may
[1:38:28] bother him with it but he won't bother
[1:38:30] him him I'm telling him that all right
[1:38:35] you guys I can see that okay I don't
[1:38:40] mind
[1:38:41] don't you hate to live that kind of life
[1:38:43] no one be up and down the trouble in
[1:38:47] that pool day and night back slid back
[1:38:49] the church back slid back the church
[1:38:50] this back apologize into this over here
[1:38:54] this other fellas just blooming right
[1:38:57] along nothing see what kind of light
[1:39:00] he's walking in according to the weather
[1:39:03] he's got him right back out cuz remember
[1:39:05] if you open if you
[1:39:06] remember the courts everybody knows what
[1:39:09] the court you saw it outside if you look
[1:39:11] outside you got your court you got you
[1:39:13] out of court there's no covering you got
[1:39:15] your inner court here and the Holy of
[1:39:16] Holies is totally sealed off no light at
[1:39:20] all except the Shekinah glory of God
[1:39:21] then you got your candlesticks here
[1:39:23] which brother bottom even says all can
[1:39:25] go out in those candlesticks he can get
[1:39:28] dim even in that we're not him in that
[1:39:29] court but we're out here where if it's
[1:39:31] raining you're wet if it's hot I mean
[1:39:34] for sunshine in your heart if it's
[1:39:37] snowing you get snowed on you understand
[1:39:38] what I'm saying so that's what he's
[1:39:39] talking about but if you stayed here
[1:39:41] like I said before you stay right here
[1:39:44] the whole time
[1:39:46] how can you let your light shine you got
[1:39:49] to bring that kind of the rent with
[1:39:51] you but when you bring it out you're out
[1:39:55] here you're out there with the heathen
[1:39:58] because that's what not to heat them but
[1:40:00] you're out there with the onion generate
[1:40:01] regenerated you they can't go back into
[1:40:03] the holy moley
[1:40:04] okay thereby okay with that so that's
[1:40:08] why brother Darrell brought that and and
[1:40:10] that I decided to incorporate it because
[1:40:13] it should be fresh on your mind if you
[1:40:15] stay in the Holy of Holies sure that's
[1:40:17] what we have we have to believe I
[1:40:18] believe this is our soul is sealed total
[1:40:24] white if you're born again you are
[1:40:27] nothing but the light of God and you're
[1:40:29] sorry but you've come back out to let
[1:40:32] that light shine but to do that you got
[1:40:36] to get back out here in this court you
[1:40:38] got to get back in this Court
[1:40:41] amen because we're heading toward up
[1:40:43] here where's the perfection of God
[1:40:50] because it was that you say oh I can't
[1:40:53] get to that Romans 8 says we're heirs
[1:40:59] and join heir right with who Jesus
[1:41:03] Christ and this man right here Jesus
[1:41:05] Christ walked on this earth the
[1:41:08] headstone in a body that was not eternal
[1:41:14] he didn't become the headstone when he
[1:41:17] come out of the grave
[1:41:18] come on but he was the fullness of the
[1:41:21] Godhead bodily
[1:41:22] he was the headstone the head of the
[1:41:25] church he just proved it when he came
[1:41:29] out of the grave right may have a
[1:41:31] brother and said there's no proof if he
[1:41:33] didn't never come out
[1:41:34] the proof was he come and said Here I am
[1:41:37] and they were doing that coming out of
[1:41:42] the grave he did what he justified he
[1:41:45] would have the Bible says he raised for
[1:41:51] our justification right you can't
[1:41:54] justify God and stay in this that's why
[1:41:56] and God forgive me if I if I hurt
[1:42:00] somebody's feeling but you know you see
[1:42:03] people that you know they carry the
[1:42:04] Bible this way and they're mink and
[1:42:07] humble and that's okay what are you
[1:42:11] putting on are you putting on you think
[1:42:15] you started like this holier-than-thou
[1:42:17] person that did know we live a lot Jesus
[1:42:21] lived a life he was God Almighty in
[1:42:24] human flesh and most people didn't know
[1:42:25] who he was now he didn't that wrong no
[1:42:30] no he didn't that wrong he distinct act
[1:42:33] according to the world thought he ought
[1:42:35] to work well that's what's gonna get me
[1:42:39] in you in trouble cuz their Christian
[1:42:44] Christian but they do the things of the
[1:42:48] world yeah
[1:42:49] you understand what I'm saying but when
[1:42:51] they come to us and they say well what's
[1:42:53] the difference enough me and you yeah so
[1:42:57] they'll kill you over Trinitarian
[1:42:58] doctrine I call because that is the
[1:43:01] absolute foundation of all of
[1:43:04] denominational faith in the print and
[1:43:05] dr. right every one of them
[1:43:10] and you go against that then they say
[1:43:12] you are what you are anti-crime they
[1:43:15] told Jesus they call him an antichrist
[1:43:17] you are of your father the devil he told
[1:43:20] them but they said work you're above the
[1:43:22] bug Wow
[1:43:26] are they gonna say the same thing you
[1:43:28] now let's go to number three
[1:43:31] hey alright look I look in this
[1:43:36] justification you've got to have a white
[1:43:38] righteous person gotta have that not in
[1:43:43] yourself but by going to Fleck statue of
[1:43:46] a perfect man hey man that's what
[1:43:50] brother Ram said I'm just reading what
[1:43:52] he said now number three this is another
[1:43:56] good one you need to close it kind of
[1:43:57] goes right in with the interval and one
[1:44:00] of my people so cost about yeah it
[1:44:03] actually was preached a month after the
[1:44:05] other one and he's still you'll watch
[1:44:07] brother branham if you'll watch his
[1:44:09] sermon he'll carry on about three or
[1:44:11] four weeks he'll carry the same thought
[1:44:14] he may turn it just a little bit he may
[1:44:16] call it a little bit something different
[1:44:17] but he carries the same file front for a
[1:44:20] couple weeks
[1:44:22] remember a watch remember many people
[1:44:26] today claiming the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:28] Spirit which they do have you see that
[1:44:33] which they do have but it's your
[1:44:36] position where you're keeping up
[1:44:41] yourself hmm
[1:44:44] it's what's causing your meal cramps
[1:44:47] that you're getting if you don't eat
[1:44:49] breakfast you're probably getting them
[1:44:50] about right now is one o'clock that's
[1:44:53] the natural but what about the spiritual
[1:44:56] you're a natural human being that makes
[1:44:58] you hungry when you don't eat right
[1:45:00] being a Christian you should be hungry
[1:45:02] if you don't eat you should be hungry
[1:45:04] all right all right but look it's your
[1:45:07] position where you're keeping yourself
[1:45:09] now what is your position here's our
[1:45:11] position if you're born again your
[1:45:16] position is you're born again you have
[1:45:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Soul
[1:45:20] yours eternal like I said this
[1:45:22] kind of glory that light that tube of
[1:45:24] light is right inside of you and then
[1:45:30] it's what's causing your meal cramps
[1:45:33] that you're getting I believe that's
[1:45:35] what's wrong with a lot of people in the
[1:45:36] message they're not getting enough food
[1:45:39] listen they're born again they're born
[1:45:43] again they just not get enough food cuz
[1:45:48] you gotta feed the baby what's the baby
[1:45:50] gets here you gotta beat it many people
[1:45:55] you find them a man that's out here
[1:45:58] now what's he's caught out here
[1:46:00] justified come in and believe on the
[1:46:04] Lord sure only the Holy Spirit alone can
[1:46:09] bring conviction any man justification
[1:46:13] is a work of the Holy Spirit not wait a
[1:46:16] minute but roll it up so they can see it
[1:46:19] in the back but it depends on where
[1:46:22] you're eating where you're getting your
[1:46:25] supply from people today even regenerate
[1:46:30] it people even regenerated people in
[1:46:37] other words they've been redeemed they
[1:46:39] got the new birth many times go to God
[1:46:42] and they love God and they praise God
[1:46:45] and they do to the service and they
[1:46:47] enjoy the service and when they leave
[1:46:49] the service the next morning they're
[1:46:50] just as lean as they was when they went
[1:46:52] out that night hmm now that can happen
[1:46:59] here here here a the three forms of
[1:47:04] justification that can happen under Amen
[1:47:12] number four
[1:47:15] putting on the whole armor of God and
[1:47:19] now when all that he anointed prophets
[1:47:23] sexual born men but it wouldn't work
[1:47:27] now they will profits now brother
[1:47:30] branham was a sexual born man every we
[1:47:32] all are they ain't a wine it what
[1:47:33] they're for Jesus Christ now one now one
[1:47:38] time then God became man and Jesus was
[1:47:42] that man and he was the expressed image
[1:47:44] of the Father see in other words all
[1:47:47] this great purity of love great purity
[1:47:49] of power all this great thing was
[1:47:51] manifested in him now therefore he went
[1:47:54] down to the grave and died for us for
[1:47:57] our sanctification and justification and
[1:48:00] then brings back the Holy Spirit see for
[1:48:03] us this is one I caught that isn't I've
[1:48:05] never seen this before but watch what he
[1:48:06] says now therefore we are the justified
[1:48:11] Christ was the sanctification of God we
[1:48:16] are the justification read that again we
[1:48:21] are the justification Christ the
[1:48:24] sanctification and the father the head
[1:48:28] that's a good one I like that quote and
[1:48:31] we stand justified in Christ before him
[1:48:35] because he can't pass judgment listen if
[1:48:39] we are the justified if we are the
[1:48:42] justification we haven't just been
[1:48:44] justified come home people we haven't
[1:48:51] just been justified
[1:48:52] we are the justification that's why you
[1:48:58] and I would judge angels and the earth
[1:49:02] right because we're just God made us
[1:49:07] just hey if he's a righteous judge and
[1:49:12] we have him inside of okay because watch
[1:49:15] that's what he said we are the
[1:49:16] justification Christ the sanctification
[1:49:19] and the father the head I love that
[1:49:22] might push it all right together now see
[1:49:26] that's not baby form justification but
[1:49:28] you got to go through that to get to
[1:49:30] that hey man you can't skip a step and
[1:49:35] we stand justified in Christ before him
[1:49:40] he cannot pass judgment he's already
[1:49:43] judged that body you and I are the body
[1:49:46] in which I am a part of what how am i
[1:49:51] part of here it is it's in me right if
[1:49:55] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:49:57] you then what you say ask the Father
[1:50:00] anything in my name it'll be done
[1:50:01] because it's there
[1:50:03] justified glory to God amen
[1:50:07] we are the justification of God cuz you
[1:50:11] know what he could destroy this whole
[1:50:13] world but he can't do it with you in it
[1:50:16] right he can't do it with you in it
[1:50:21] he'd have to wipe you off too and he
[1:50:24] can't go past you right now love that
[1:50:30] that's a wonderful quote number five
[1:50:32] crosses the mystery Garberville we'll be
[1:50:34] done here in just a few minutes there by
[1:50:36] all right nobody sleepy today much those
[1:50:39] of you there sleep this is round two all
[1:50:41] right
[1:50:42] Christ is the mystery of God revealed oh
[1:50:45] if you can get the world to see that why
[1:50:48] there you are
[1:50:50] there is the body of Christ living
[1:50:52] standing redeemed redeemed now what we
[1:50:57] talked about was how about Redemption
[1:50:58] but we got to start with this first seal
[1:51:01] that first seals got to open to show a
[1:51:03] white righteous church on the earth
[1:51:08] justified in his side why are you
[1:51:11] justified this goes right back to the
[1:51:14] same quote we're the justification
[1:51:16] because we're his victory if he raised
[1:51:19] for our justification whose victory was
[1:51:22] it sure he had victory but who did he
[1:51:25] give it to he giving to us and and that
[1:51:32] includes the body change if he would
[1:51:36] have come out of the grave see he could
[1:51:38] have come out like Lazarus hello he
[1:51:41] could have come out like Lazarus would
[1:51:43] still having a corrupt body don't
[1:51:45] Lazarus not again this man is alive
[1:51:50] forevermore
[1:51:52] so he raised like no one else had raised
[1:51:55] before but that wasn't his total victory
[1:52:00] because if he didn't give it to somebody
[1:52:02] we are his victory the church is his
[1:52:07] victory we come forth in this last days
[1:52:11] with this glorious gospel showing his
[1:52:14] victory he died for that purpose and we
[1:52:17] are proof of his victory when we see him
[1:52:21] coming down and living him on the church
[1:52:23] that's his victory now he comes down and
[1:52:26] gets them on the church what has he made
[1:52:27] us not just a while he's made us that
[1:52:29] white righteous person what sins you
[1:52:34] talking about right oh well yeah I said
[1:52:38] yesterday you asked forgiveness no
[1:52:41] forgiveness no forgiveness go watch
[1:52:47] shows that he couldn't keep him in the
[1:52:49] grave neither can they keep he broke
[1:52:57] that seal when he broke that seal he was
[1:53:01] a white righteous man he was not a
[1:53:03] righteous man he would be righteous man
[1:53:05] but he brought all of us with him
[1:53:08] neither can they keep us that's right
[1:53:11] we're already there's that word
[1:53:14] potentially we had to use that word in a
[1:53:15] long time potentially arise because
[1:53:19] we've raised from dead unbelief in his
[1:53:22] word now that's that guy inside got to
[1:53:28] an eternal word of the eternal God which
[1:53:31] is him himself working through us
[1:53:33] manifesting himself that he is the same
[1:53:36] yesterday today and forever all right
[1:53:39] let's get to this last of invisible
[1:53:41] union we're gonna have a few quotes
[1:53:42] there we should be fine now watch this
[1:53:47] now I wanna I'm gonna bring this in and
[1:53:50] explain this because it had been
[1:53:51] explained in a while brother they'll
[1:53:53] explain T years ago when you preach on
[1:53:56] marriage and divorce and things like
[1:53:58] that you have to bring this in so you
[1:53:59] get the natural aspect to get the
[1:54:01] spiritual aspect okay
[1:54:02] that all right okay same ad
[1:54:05] where am I there we go hallelujah thank
[1:54:08] you brother dirty boy he don't ever
[1:54:10] sleep he's probably close to oldest one
[1:54:11] of them room right now and he you know
[1:54:13] whatever go sleep maybe because she was
[1:54:19] cast over in that side now what is he's
[1:54:21] talking about marriage in divorce he's
[1:54:22] talk about a woman
[1:54:23] now watch she also has also been given a
[1:54:27] sacred charge from God for redemption
[1:54:31] now think about the bride you and I the
[1:54:34] redemption of God is through the bride
[1:54:36] God doesn't need redemption he never
[1:54:39] failed you and I need redeeming right
[1:54:42] okay for redemption she's now she you
[1:54:45] talk about the church the bride she now
[1:54:48] he's done by the natural woman but
[1:54:49] watching how it ties in and I thought
[1:54:51] this was really good to bring in at this
[1:54:53] time because you got to remember well
[1:54:55] listen she's got characters that she
[1:54:57] must not define if she would Mar them
[1:55:00] she is defiled for a lifetime
[1:55:01] no matter how much she is forgiven she
[1:55:05] can't be justified now hold on a minute
[1:55:07] he said all women that defile their body
[1:55:09] they never be justified that's not what
[1:55:12] he's saying justified as Christian
[1:55:13] justification all right then I got that
[1:55:16] all right but if a woman goes out and
[1:55:19] loses her virginity or gives herself to
[1:55:21] a man and it be out of wedlock she can't
[1:55:24] ever go back in and say well I want to
[1:55:26] marry so-and-so and I'm a virgin she can
[1:55:31] be forgiven of that but she can't be
[1:55:33] justified in telling that man she's a
[1:55:35] virgin amen
[1:55:37] but now that's what Israel went whoring
[1:55:42] against God she was defiled he divorced
[1:55:49] her right to marry me and you but now
[1:55:53] remember me and you listen me and you
[1:56:00] had a husband
[1:56:06] hey man now let's let the probably
[1:56:10] explain she can be forgiven for her
[1:56:13] defilement but she cannot be justified
[1:56:16] in this life right okay so listen don't
[1:56:20] think you can listen to any of your
[1:56:21] sisters even your brother we tell my
[1:56:23] sisters all the time being defiled man
[1:56:24] do the same thing man has the virginity
[1:56:27] also you know that doesn't mean you're
[1:56:29] lost and going on the way to hell no
[1:56:31] that don't mean that that means you can
[1:56:33] never go back because you know what he's
[1:56:35] dealing with he's dealing with Catholics
[1:56:37] that are sitting in his congregation
[1:56:39] saying that they can change the
[1:56:41] virginity back in the woman so she can
[1:56:43] marry no well that's what the Roman
[1:56:47] Catholic Church says they can do restore
[1:56:48] virginity he and that's what he's
[1:56:50] dealing with me is also telling us that
[1:56:53] we can't be justified in this life in
[1:56:56] this life this life it's always with her
[1:57:04] because remember sisters brothers you
[1:57:06] were there when it happened now are we
[1:57:07] not going back to what worked on my
[1:57:08] justification baby for him justification
[1:57:11] you got you chopped sins chopped off but
[1:57:13] she didn't forget it notice now she's
[1:57:17] been given this she may be forgiven but
[1:57:20] not justified right all right now that's
[1:57:23] not the justification we're talking
[1:57:24] about in the in this nobody got that she
[1:57:28] can't be justified in saying she's a
[1:57:30] virgin ever again okay that's in this
[1:57:33] life but remember this life is got to be
[1:57:36] changed and man this is where now now
[1:57:40] now let's get into something now let's
[1:57:43] go to quote number seven which is the
[1:57:45] invisible union that was paragraph 78 he
[1:57:48] continues preaching the sermon but now
[1:57:49] what is he doing he's bringing it out of
[1:57:53] the natural and putting it right into
[1:57:54] the spiritual all right everybody got
[1:57:57] that same am so now this is spiritual
[1:57:59] now your whole book is gone with your
[1:58:01] old union now you're naming your old and
[1:58:05] your has been transferred now say do you
[1:58:09] mean to tell me that my old book God put
[1:58:11] it in the sea of his forgetfulness you
[1:58:14] stay
[1:58:15] and perfectly before God now your name
[1:58:19] is now in the new book not the book of
[1:58:22] life but the Lamb's Book of Life what
[1:58:25] the lamb redeemed their revelations 5
[1:58:30] we're still in the we're still in the
[1:58:31] seals revelations 5 was the opening of
[1:58:33] the seals when the what the lamb took
[1:58:35] the he didn't just take the book of life
[1:58:38] that wasn't the book of life only the
[1:58:41] redeemed part hey man because there's a
[1:58:45] book of life that everybody's in ok
[1:58:47] not the old book of your natural union
[1:58:52] cuz look in it in it some actuality you
[1:58:58] can never get away from that you were
[1:59:01] born from your mom and daddy you you
[1:59:03] you're not gonna ever get away from that
[1:59:05] in this form until we go on up a little
[1:59:07] higher okay because what your carnal
[1:59:10] minds know I'm gonna let you that's why
[1:59:11] you have a carnal mind your mind tells
[1:59:13] you you were born in sin shaping the
[1:59:15] Knik which bathroom mother's womb coming
[1:59:17] forth the liar you understand one's name
[1:59:19] know what the mind of Christ didn't tell
[1:59:21] you that the mind of Christ never told
[1:59:24] you that the mind of Christ told you
[1:59:27] never done it we just gotta what believe
[1:59:33] is that how it is yeah not the old book
[1:59:38] of your natural union but your new right
[1:59:41] hallelujah
[1:59:42] your new life is in the Lamb's Book of
[1:59:46] Life your marriage certificate
[1:59:48] hallelujah where your true eternal germ
[1:59:51] what are you talking about not one time
[1:59:52] for mom and daddy you're what you're
[1:59:55] looking at now that germ comes from mama
[1:59:57] Nettie
[1:59:57] but that eternal germ from the beginning
[2:00:00] takes hold now you're not only forgiven
[2:00:04] but you're justified glory justified
[2:00:08] Romans 5:1 said yeah Romans 5:1 says
[2:00:10] therefore being justified by what faith
[2:00:12] right now look up the word the word
[2:00:16] don't mean forgiven it means righteous
[2:00:20] all the things that we read down through
[2:00:22] there the word means the word don't mean
[2:00:26] forgiven the word means justified
[2:00:28] it don't mean you're forgiven now we got
[2:00:32] to step up a little higher because
[2:00:34] remember the baby form justification is
[2:00:37] you getting forgiven number one
[2:00:41] justification you've got to know that
[2:00:43] God forgave you your sins because you
[2:00:47] did them there was a record of you doing
[2:00:50] them right
[2:00:51] but in that Lamb's Book of Life folks
[2:00:53] there's not a list of things you've done
[2:00:54] right hello there's not a list of
[2:00:59] anything you've done look up the word
[2:01:03] the word don't mean forgiven word means
[2:01:04] justified it don't mean you're forgiven
[2:01:06] for instance you heard I got drunk and
[2:01:08] done some evil things and everything
[2:01:09] then you come around say to me you found
[2:01:11] out I didn't do them then you come
[2:01:14] around and say brother branham I forgive
[2:01:15] you forgive me I didn't do it right at
[2:01:19] the first place see now if I did do it
[2:01:23] I'm guilty but you could forgive me and
[2:01:28] I wouldn't be guilty right that's your
[2:01:30] first step you got it that's number one
[2:01:33] I wrote that that's number one if you
[2:01:36] did do it you're guilty but you could
[2:01:39] forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty but
[2:01:42] yet I'm not justified because I actually
[2:01:46] done it
[2:01:48] so remember baby for them justification
[2:01:51] doesn't give you a new birth right he
[2:01:53] just walks off your past sins then what
[2:01:55] you got continued on is your problem
[2:01:58] because I actually done it but the word
[2:02:02] justified is though you never done it
[2:02:08] number two got it number two up that
[2:02:14] statue of a perfect man what's it doing
[2:02:16] it's getting rid of that old nature oh
[2:02:17] no my nature not yeah I know you nature
[2:02:20] died in your soul but you still got the
[2:02:22] old nature use born with please sorry
[2:02:26] yours born the five senses memories and
[2:02:28] conservation imagination that's a
[2:02:32] problem right but you got to even see in
[2:02:36] that condition that when virtue comes
[2:02:39] knowledge comes temperance comes it
[2:02:42] overcomes all that he that overcometh
[2:02:46] it's a fight like brother Dale said the
[2:02:48] other night it's a fight when they got
[2:02:49] in the promised land with just about
[2:02:51] isn't the Holy Ghost sure they came into
[2:02:54] a rest because that was their land but
[2:02:56] they found every right in the world keep
[2:02:59] them off the land and still couldn't get
[2:03:00] them all dead I just kept coming in but
[2:03:04] in god that can't happen once you kill
[2:03:08] it it's dead we'll watch this
[2:03:09] it's not even regarded at all how is it
[2:03:13] done in God's book of the sea of
[2:03:15] forgetfulness your old book and married
[2:03:18] is divorced and dead you don't just
[2:03:21] divorced and dead it's not even in the
[2:03:24] memories of God you are justified
[2:03:28] therefore being justified it was accused
[2:03:32] you was accused you never done in the
[2:03:36] first place the old union is in the sea
[2:03:40] of god's forgetfulness you wasn't
[2:03:42] married to it to begin with now oh-ho
[2:03:45] brother branham wait a minute we were
[2:03:48] married to the devil and always don't
[2:03:53] man exactly because look you wasn't
[2:03:58] married to it to get he the bridegroom
[2:04:00] boy your shame now when you make him
[2:04:01] your bridegroom that's what takes all
[2:04:05] their way he took your place for you
[2:04:10] were predestinated for him to be his
[2:04:13] bride before the foundation of the world
[2:04:15] the Bible said so you are the
[2:04:17] predestinated seed now let's continue
[2:04:19] reading all right let's go to the next
[2:04:23] one all right now look this is 262
[2:04:29] though it's 228 I've cut a little bit of
[2:04:31] it out to get a point he the bridegroom
[2:04:35] took away your shame and put it in the
[2:04:38] sea of forgetfulness by what by the
[2:04:39] washing of the water of the word and the
[2:04:42] blood of life that's what the Bible said
[2:04:45] your first husband that you imagine hey
[2:04:47] just a look look it looks contrary but
[2:04:50] it's not your first husband that you
[2:04:53] were married to
[2:04:55] the world the world the anointed
[2:04:59] bridegroom which for Danes you has
[2:05:02] washed you by the washing of the word by
[2:05:04] the church congregation says no I didn't
[2:05:06] sound right does it you might find that
[2:05:08] in an almanac but not in God's Bible by
[2:05:11] the washing of the water by the word in
[2:05:12] the word you are standing completely
[2:05:15] justified as though you never did it at
[2:05:18] the beginning this is my message to the
[2:05:22] church now thanks for talking to me in
[2:05:25] you this is my message it says though
[2:05:30] you never did it at the beginning as you
[2:05:32] start shedding that stuff off remember
[2:05:35] the water remember the dream sister
[2:05:36] Sheppard's dream the water was going in
[2:05:39] and what what was coming out not pure

[2:05:54] realm as we go off the air just in a
[2:05:58] minute now watch he's gonna he's gonna
[2:06:00] jump it up a little bit in just a few
[2:06:02] minutes watch this you are standing as
[2:06:04] you're standing if you're standing on
[2:06:07] God's Word and with God's Word every a
[2:06:09] man every jot every tittle where you
[2:06:11] standing right I'm trying to tell you
[2:06:13] pull away from them shucks get out there
[2:06:15] in the week where you can get right
[2:06:16] before the Sun I hear the coming of the
[2:06:18] combine you're standing complete
[2:06:20] justified like you never did it in the
[2:06:22] first place he said that two or three
[2:06:24] times talk a lot of Thanksgiving I feel
[2:06:28] real good I'm more thankful for that
[2:06:29] than anything I know of you are the pure
[2:06:32] virtuous endless bride of the Son of the
[2:06:34] Living God every man and woman that's
[2:06:36] born of the Spirit of God and washed in
[2:06:37] the blood of Jesus Christ and believes
[2:06:39] every word of God stands as though you
[2:06:41] never sinned at the first place
[2:06:43] you are perfect when we gonna start
[2:06:46] believing that now listen to the last
[2:06:49] one he goes on down to the next about
[2:06:52] paragraph 268 now watch him you're
[2:06:57] standing complete now he's never said
[2:07:01] this right here before he said as if you
[2:07:04] never did it as if you never did it as
[2:07:06] if you never did
[2:07:10] you never sinned in the first place
[2:07:13] that's way up there folks that's way up
[2:07:17] there
[2:07:17] that's way that's that's up there in
[2:07:20] that capstone of love comes remember
[2:07:23] there's only one man that ever walked on
[2:07:25] this earth that was sinless
[2:07:26] right the headstone Christ Himself was
[2:07:31] totally sinless and that's what's he
[2:07:34] saying right here you never sinned at
[2:07:36] the first place God don't even know it's
[2:07:40] in the sea of forgetfulness you never
[2:07:42] did it you were accused of it by the
[2:07:46] accuser but really from the beginning
[2:07:48] you were predestinated by to be a son
[2:07:52] and daughter of God
[2:07:53] you're standing there washing your whole
[2:07:55] book of divorcement is put away and it's
[2:07:56] dead absolutely out of the existence
[2:07:59] even in the mind of God so why do we
[2:08:05] struggle down here when it filters
[2:08:09] through into God's mind and he owns it
[2:08:11] and we didn't do it because remember one
[2:08:14] marker sinned against us and we don't we
[2:08:16] don't go anywhere we stop amen you are
[2:08:20] the virtuous Bride of Christ washed in
[2:08:22] the blood of Christ
[2:08:23] precious virtuous sinless son of God
[2:08:26] standing with a pure unadulterated bride
[2:08:29] word that he washed by the water of his
[2:08:31] own blood that became flesh and
[2:08:33] manifested that he might take you which
[2:08:36] were predestinated into the bosom of the
[2:08:39] Father before the beginning the same as
[2:08:42] he was he was that great attribute of
[2:08:46] God called love so if his attribute is
[2:08:51] love then our attribute is love
[2:08:55] and it's not just filial love that's the
[2:08:58] agape love of God that's the love of God
[2:09:00] that's going to take us out of here
[2:09:02] that's gonna change our body that's
[2:09:04] gonna make all things right and listen
[2:09:07] it's already made things right those who
[2:09:12] he has justified he is all ready
[2:09:14] glorified
[2:09:18] our problem is our carnal mind is
[2:09:21] keeping us from believing that because
[2:09:25] we're back out here in the outer court
[2:09:28] and let's be honest with ourselves
[2:09:30] sometimes we go God where are you I'm
[2:09:33] getting dumped on out here right man
[2:09:37] well it just happens amazing no I get
[2:09:41] soaked right he said okay he said look
[2:09:45] you gotta keep walking I'm gonna take
[2:09:48] you right back in there again hey man
[2:09:52] I'm gonna take you back in there again
[2:09:55] then I'm gonna take you back in there
[2:09:57] again he loved Lord so then the first
[2:10:05] sale when it opens it gives you it shows
[2:10:07] you a justification that's just if you
[2:10:09] never did it because you're not white
[2:10:11] righteous if you did it right right
[2:10:14] you're not if you did it you're not
[2:10:16] righteous but now you know you did it in
[2:10:18] that first form when you were crying out
[2:10:20] to God saying God forgive me of all that
[2:10:22] junk I did he's a little cow forgive you
[2:10:25] but you're gonna keep walking because we
[2:10:29] got to go to the next one cuz
[2:10:31] justification that there's the white
[2:10:33] white Rochester you got to start walking
[2:10:36] in right anybody else won't say it again
[2:10:41] you got to start right why then right
[2:10:44] and then cuz you can't start you said oh
[2:10:47] no yeah you were black you were black
[2:10:50] you were smutty you were you were as
[2:10:52] black as this but not in here you were
[2:10:57] black but he want that black out right
[2:11:00] he says come on let's start and let's
[2:11:05] start a journey because the next thing
[2:11:07] I'm gonna do I'm gonna send the next
[2:11:10] horse out and that horse is gonna be red
[2:11:13] and red always means sanctification
[2:11:17] always read through red is white hey man
[2:11:23] you know I didn't notice that too we
[2:11:25] play the game one time and it was a red
[2:11:28] sheet of paper
[2:11:30] all messed up and you couldn't see
[2:11:31] nothing hardly under it and then there
[2:11:33] was a red sheet on the outside of when
[2:11:35] you slid that card to it the word popped
[2:11:37] out because it was in white red through
[2:11:39] red password that's what it was
[2:11:42] thank you I was trying to think of it
[2:11:43] just at Rudy's plate she's played
[2:11:45] password before but if you push you down
[2:11:47] through there you don't see a word at
[2:11:49] all you push it read through read that
[2:11:53] white word comes out that's what God
[2:11:55] done he put that in the sea of God's
[2:11:57] forgetfulness you and I gotta realize
[2:11:59] that cuz he's going to work on a
[2:12:01] sanctified person that's not just
[2:12:04] cleaned and set aside for service you're
[2:12:06] already in service when he puts you in
[2:12:09] service that's faith you don't lose all
[2:12:13] that and start again
[2:12:14] no you build higher you get to start
[2:12:18] believing that you didn't do this it's
[2:12:22] not your fault
[2:12:24] it was your fault to begin with but it's
[2:12:29] not your fault now and then we're gonna
[2:12:31] realize one day now what did Jesus say
[2:12:34] he said who can convince me of sin
[2:12:39] convinced me now you may say I'm a
[2:12:42] sinner but can you convict me for being
[2:12:44] one that's the problem I said many times
[2:12:47] like brother Dale said can can we go can
[2:12:50] we go into our workplace or can we go to
[2:12:52] our friends and the friends can can can
[2:12:54] they give us enough evidence to convict
[2:12:58] us to still be a center or to be a
[2:13:00] Christian right that's the outside God's
[2:13:06] brought you back out here where you got
[2:13:08] to live with them again and you got a
[2:13:10] shine that's your kind of glory out but
[2:13:11] you know what that's hid your hidden
[2:13:13] Christ but being hidden Christ doesn't
[2:13:17] mean he's gonna put you in a monastery
[2:13:18] somewhere and close the door
[2:13:21] no no his victory is is walking in
[2:13:26] Satan's eating a glorified group of
[2:13:30] people left stand our feet see that's
[2:13:33] what the first seal the first seal has
[2:13:35] to show everything right because we're
[2:13:39] heading on a journey here we're heading
[2:13:40] we're heading toward something we're
[2:13:42] right we're
[2:13:43] and just as much as he's riding amen we
[2:13:47] come back riding on wild horses
[2:13:49] how do you think we got him if he's got
[2:13:55] one I got one
[2:13:57] hey man he's got a wild horse I got a
[2:14:00] wild horse
[2:14:01] I don't I don't wanna be riding on a
[2:14:04] black winner of or a pale one deal
[2:14:09] I want to ride why one cuz my my
[2:14:13] husband's gonna be on the white line and
[2:14:18] we don't want any thing to hinder us
[2:14:23] that's our problem
[2:14:24] but like brother Brahim said you follow
[2:14:27] what God said you follow the word
[2:14:30] washing of the water by the word not
[2:14:32] walking through the water by whatever
[2:14:34] Washington the water bout but now don't
[2:14:36] go so crazy like brother Brown said
[2:14:38] don't wind yourself away don't try to
[2:14:41] say like brother Dale said like last
[2:14:43] night you know you got to get in front
[2:14:44] of picture and you know see that's
[2:14:45] Catholicism when they start doing that
[2:14:48] and they start burning candles and and
[2:14:50] you know you you watch them you see them
[2:14:52] and they're standing there and they're
[2:14:54] counting their beads and their problem
[2:14:55] you don't have to do that pray without
[2:14:59] ceasing means all day all day right and
[2:15:03] yet oh I got to keep my mind on God well
[2:15:05] no you got to be a human - all right
[2:15:09] there's a lot of times I don't know
[2:15:10] about you but there's a lot of times God
[2:15:11] revealed things demand it look like it I
[2:15:13] shouldn't be in a position that he did
[2:15:15] why because but you've made yourself
[2:15:17] available right you've made yourself
[2:15:20] available somebody wants to talk to you
[2:15:22] they can come and talk to you about
[2:15:24] something but I have many times you know
[2:15:25] you you sometimes you would think that
[2:15:27] God would really come down in and you
[2:15:30] know just to anoint you and give you 50
[2:15:32] revelations and and while you're you
[2:15:35] know quiet and you know got a tape
[2:15:37] playing but sometimes this when you're
[2:15:39] driving a lawnmower run where I'm
[2:15:41] driving a lawn mower sometimes you know
[2:15:43] it's all that loud noise and I've got
[2:15:45] headphones on and I've got the Christian
[2:15:48] station on playing music God's still
[2:15:51] talking right hey that don't bother him
[2:15:54] he can still talk to you because
[2:15:56] was he talking to he's not talking to
[2:15:57] these ears up here he's talking to the
[2:15:59] ears right here let's bow our head the
[2:16:02] only father thank you for today Lord we
[2:16:04] appreciate the time we have to come and
[2:16:06] worship you know Lord we pray that you
[2:16:09] just touch us heal the sick you said you
[2:16:11] sent your word and healed us Lord by the
[2:16:13] washing of the water of the word were
[2:16:15] not just being healed of our everyday
[2:16:17] sicknesses but we're being healed of
[2:16:19] that sin that was in our life and and
[2:16:22] you forgive us totally justified us or
[2:16:27] we stand complete in you now you said
[2:16:30] that's what you say it as Abraham just
[2:16:33] stood one day and said somebody may have
[2:16:34] said Abraham how you gonna have the baby
[2:16:36] I don't know God said I was gonna have
[2:16:37] it so we got to just believe what you've
[2:16:39] already said it's not some extra book or
[2:16:42] tape or extra 25th chapter of
[2:16:45] revelations we're looking for no it's
[2:16:47] still written around here in the word
[2:16:49] that we've got to see it then we'll see
[2:16:52] it we believe it and then it becomes
[2:16:54] part of us Lord just be with us take
[2:16:57] care of us and the further man the
[2:16:58] service from Jesus name we pray amen
[2:17:00] amen you want to sing anybody need a
[2:17:03] want prayer it's 1:30 we can we can pray
[2:17:08] for the sick or we can just pray right
[2:17:10] here right where you stand it but thank
[2:17:13] you for thank you for coming on a day
[2:17:14] like this not so bad it's about 85
[2:17:17] degrees up here so this won't be too bad
[2:17:20] outside but the Lord bless you can go
[2:17:22] with you take care of you hopefully shed
[2:17:23] something that'll that'll help you in
[2:17:25] and just remember one thing just
[2:17:29] remember one thing as we go through this
[2:17:31] it's all about Redemption it's all about
[2:17:34] bringing us back to where we had there
[2:17:38] not been a fall back to we were still
[2:17:41] going to walk in flesh I believe we were
[2:17:45] still gonna have five senses in our
[2:17:47] spirit we obviously going to have five
[2:17:51] senses in our body because he walked
[2:17:53] over my brother Brandon went across the
[2:17:55] curtain of time they talked to him told
[2:17:57] him what he did they had memory but the
[2:18:00] problem was they didn't have all the
[2:18:02] memory they had wiped out the part that
[2:18:04] God he forgot that he can't bring it
[2:18:07] back up Lord that's why brother Graham
[2:18:08] said why would I want to leave this
[2:18:10] place
[2:18:11] he was sitting in a place of perfect
[2:18:13] love you know that is the Shekinah glory
[2:18:15] he was he was in that Shekinah glory he
[2:18:17] said I gotta go back down there and then
[2:18:20] you know what the angel said said yeah
[2:18:22] you got to go back down there in other
[2:18:23] words you got to go witness some more
[2:18:25] you got to get you got some more people
[2:18:27] that needs to be in this dimension and
[2:18:29] you're preaching the message prophet
[2:18:31] william branham that's gonna change some
[2:18:33] people it's going to get us out of this
[2:18:35] sixth dimension hey man I don't know
[2:18:38] where they told him at or not but you
[2:18:39] know what that's exactly what it is
[2:18:41] his message they said no you got to go
[2:18:43] back in other words he wasn't finished
[2:18:45] right
[2:18:46] that was only one 1960 I think when he
[2:18:48] went across the curtain of time yet any
[2:18:50] breach the seals yet hadn't even started
[2:18:51] his message yet and they knew that that
[2:18:54] you know you gotta go back me go back
[2:18:57] yeah you gotta go back and preach in
[2:18:59] other words you got to preach a group of
[2:19:00] people in such a condition to where they
[2:19:03] can bring us out of here because we with
[2:19:06] sin can't bring them without sin there's
[2:19:10] a key hey man you love the Lord let's
[2:19:13] bow our heads just for another minute
[2:19:14] Lord just be with the people on the way
[2:19:16] home touch them be with the wheels of
[2:19:19] the car or keep all the all the rough
[2:19:23] away from us Lord I know you you've
[2:19:25] already lifted all the ice lorry on
[2:19:28] actually protect this on the on the wet
[2:19:30] roads going home Lord maybe we
[2:19:33] fellowship around you as the wheels turn
[2:19:35] Lord maybe we'll talk about you Lord the
[2:19:38] things that you've done in our life that
[2:19:39] totally a miracle because you're a
[2:19:42] miracle working God but now let us
[2:19:45] testify Lord to the world that we are
[2:19:48] justified
[2:19:49] we are your victory but we only have
[2:19:54] victory through you and through your
[2:19:55] word Lord let us hear more from you let
[2:19:58] us have more revelation just be with us
[2:20:00] Lord take care of us in our journey in
