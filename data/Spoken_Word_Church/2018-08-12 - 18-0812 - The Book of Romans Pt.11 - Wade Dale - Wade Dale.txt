TRANSCRIPT
========================================
going back running stitch for just few minutes just to kind of go back through but we went through it before because remember this is the baptismal scripture that we use but we need to get this part to show that verse 7 is the continuation so watch what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein I want to scroll over thinking no you're not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into this death death burial resurrection therefore when we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life now that doesn't mean could we read the first part of this scripture e it looks like he says were baptized into his death as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father you think he was fixing to say that we'll be resurrected like him no even so we should walk in newness of life till he's done by us being dead but being walking through life being a dead person that's what we are we're dead to sin we should be dead to all the other things of the world for if we have been planted together in the likeness of a dead then you and I have not been planted okay that's what we do the funeral we plant when we plant them we put them in the ground I know but now Christians all we're doing is we're just putting the shell that's think about this yesterday working week we put them in the ground but that's just a shell that person is not even nail it forces nowhere even close you know we say whatever you want to yeah he's close or she's close but she's in another dimension but they have departed from this dimension yes and there's they had to leave the body here because remember their body was created in this to me not in that dimension now the body they went to is created in that dimension because we were formed in the image the image come here when we're born again in the soul the new man new mr. black that new man is what goes across the curtain of time not the body the body came from mom and daddy it was a natural act to get us here as human beings to let us express ourselves so whatever that expression is when you leave here you can't take the body with you because it's not as solid it's in the first three dimensions you know this part right here is in this dimension he can't go into another dimension but now that if we be planted together in the likeness of his death we shall we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection so what likeness are we him in the resurrection he went to another dimension he left his body here he couldn't take his body crossed another dimension because why it was formed in this dimension Jesus's body was formed in this dimension his human body so he can take it with it the contrary he can't he's gotta come like us just like us he can't take that flesh body in another dimension until the resurrection resurrection he stepped out of that dimension in by into this dimension connected back up to the body and it became glorified it became eternal my brother man said he inherited eternal life ends by we had to come back here to get the whole thing we have to look at though is as ice thinking the other day we've got to go up one nice because that's easy to do because if you die you go over another dimension your soul stays there until whenever but we which are alive and remain is gonna do something that no one else has ever done on the face of the earth even Jesus he just went born in sin we were going to seeing Shaitan iniquity of bound to hell he wasn't he came into this dimension he's turned a man we did contrary to any belief you want to believe it just take to me it just so simple to leave the thing the way it is as I tell them you this morning thereby ultimately how much come here was something inside of it was a seizure or whatever if you come here any different than Judas Iscariot Judas on the day of judgment can stand up and say God I didn't have the chance though speaking because you brought me some way special I mean you brought them some way special and you didn't let me do it so everybody then Paul concludes here a little bit later they were all the morning scene right we're all understanding I just like it that way that way then Judas can't stand up and say well no way now you put that little eternal something whatever it is inside of him it just made him eternal and that's just the way it's gonna be God and I had no choice no God's gonna walk up one day are you gonna walk up the garden one day and he may try to say that the cards gonna say I give you the same choice I gave him so then then God's not a respecter of persons I don't know why people can't see that but they take notes and quotes or kill you if you can't put it together in front therefore we are buried why don't we have to do all this if we got this eternal journal or she'd already innocence why don't we have to don't do any of that right that's my question why do we have to go through this one why does the Bible even read that's right why was the Bible II during the Bible's read and watch the book of Redemption sometimes all so I got a hangnail on what quit them therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death now there's nothing physically right that's not physical death that like as Christ was raised up a good postman always brings bring the clothes yuri-chan open six hundred play yesterday open nine hundred boxes and I get hangnail I can't stick my thumb in the mouth and cry about it that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we should walk in newness of life for if we there's that we I'm still working on a sermon on week so that we I heard he got on the other day on the radio that was really neat he said he said when you go to the graveyard he said you look at the beginning of somebody's life you know birth date then you see their ending of life he said I'm not concerned with those two he said I want to know what happened in that little space that they got that little lying drum think of that not because the birth date is okay it got you there the death date we know where you go you're departed what happens in between that will he says I don't eat sometimes they're not gonna buy the next law they said where there's a lifetime he said I don't know what that - means the - is forever things that creep that's that sermon it's just notice it's - - for if we have been planning together the life as soon as death which means now okay we shall also be in the lack of sermons resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him then when you crucify somebody want you killing that's why that to me it's just so simple that you came here with a nature that was black and it was attached to your soul the person you are that was attacked that's why the soul is the nature of the Spirit you were born with the nature and if you let that nature cultivate at 12 years old whenever the age of accountability is you starts dragging you down it's like a sucker it just keeps sucking on your soul and then it just makes you black then one day what happens remember there's no gonna be a laundry list of wine you walk up to the white throne judgement somebody says well God said now you come here the doctor you smoked you drank you did this know one thing did you believe me or did you not believe me I finally asked her brother Brown I said no he said gonna pray tell she said whoa whoa brother Ram what he said unbeliev so what's up guys I'm not going to take very long because you just walk up and say or you believe we're in unbelievers you know you didn't believe me so this is what you did this is the attribute of you not believe but if we be planted together in the likeness of his depth which also be in the likeness of his resurrection and what was his resurrection he came from another dimension come into this dimension took the body up changed the body by what was inside of me and still walked on the earth 30 to 40 days and glorified body same live with us knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead it's freed from sin remember we're going to the next situation here which is he talks a little bit about marriage and divorce which just they taught you your spiritual life table now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we should also live with him I like what what brother Ron Spencer said Thursday 9:00 he said he was listening to brother Dan Daisley one the last sermon he preached to his church he walks up read the scripture takes his tags and says I believe my wife's having an affair yeah they did this same thing he said the whole church was just silent looking at you know brother damn and then he started reading the scripture about how that we we're supposed to be dead our old guys was supposed to be dead he stole my cab ride he's gone my cab rider fooling around with other denominations are fooling around with her own idea or fooling around with doctrine my wife's having an affair that was his congregation he was talking yes he was talking brother on conversation I believe my little fairy friend that he died he died on the sim once I'm sorry knowing that Christ being raised from the dead died in the morning all right dad has no more dominion over him but now what he gets we get for him that he died he died understand once but then he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon he also yourself Dan indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord in other words allows through God unto God through our Redeemer Lord Jesus Christ is our Redeemer he's I read em he's our Redemption holder he's the bull has he done the right of her name he's the only good right let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof I neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness understand but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God and know what he's done is he's come out into that middle man you don't send yourself if you're born again you can't see we're not talking about standing in yourself right you don't see in yourself if you're born again if you're not you just are seen but if you stand in your soul then there's just there's there's sin in there and it needs to die though husband still alive yes but when the old husband's dead what he's talking about look yield yourselves unto God what we're done if you're born again where's God you know that's our problem it's what it's telling burly's people last week our problem is we don't yield to that thing that we say that we have that's the most powerful thing in the world it's the whole ego the burner of your soul the one they put God inside of you the Creator we don't yield that we yield what does American concentration make me thank you do I live about what's in there your life shows whether it's a marathon yes yes because you remember this whole name this whole world is dead people walking you sure they're alive but and see there you go - and I was thinking about this also you there's a balance because we are special we are chosen we are eternal people walking in flesh bodies and the whole world's not but if we think that were greater because of that I doubt that that's in there because remember Jesus was God Almighty in human flesh and he Lord they thought he was so they don't even so fooled the devil because he hung around with sinners and wine bitters and and prosecutes and hey remember they walk up in this is what's your master you think you think this guy have said he in other words one of religious people say you know fella simple does yeah he fell shifted them centers when him you know who least hanging around out there see that's why they called a pellicle but why they didn't have anything inside of them no representation to say hey that could be the Messiah but that was already written so they already made their choice by for knowledge for knowledge God knew all this okay for knowledge you can understand everything would you take predestination down the line and it is Judas he didn't choose us he did and that ain't the way things that's not the way it is for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid no you know that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness is asking the question but God be thanked that we are the servant that we were the servants of sin that's my question how can we have some spot of eternal life in our soul and be a sinner you came you can't have bitter watering and sweet watering the same well I just think we were lost yeah we were lost we were we were doomed and we were black in our soul our soul was so negative to God and then all of a sudden the fires out comes kills the old man the unclean spirit goes out of a man walks and dry places the Bible tells you all these things but it's just hard for people to sing because of white because of quotes staying about this morning about Daniel 70 weeks ago because of quotes because of quotes there's so much the division about Daniel 70 weeks until they you know people will one preacher said that's a sham kickin doctrine don't think it starts getting up to our antenna well why is it a sham kicking doctrine is the Bible tells us that there's one week left after the rapture so I don't really I'm gonna make it strong I don't care what brother Ram said yes ma'am I know if he said it contrary to the Bible he's wrong anyone he was the Prophet he knew how to put it together and he knew that they would know you that we have contained they have contingent over that one that one doctrine but the Bible says there's one week left so I'm gonna stay with that and then I can make everything fit well brother I'm saying I can make it fit we've done it before and all the things that we did with the Jewish calendars and all that stuff we may fit we didn't make it fit God's got somebody on there that can make it fit right and then but God be thanked to you you were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart now where's the heart of hearts to solve this man that form of doctrine which was delivered you Paul delivered them a sin killing doctrine you were once servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness all right I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness into iniquity into unto iniquity even so now you yield your members servants of righteousness unto holiness for when we were the servants of sin you were free from righteousness we did want any but we were servants of sin really I mean what fruit PEGI then and those things where Annie are now ashamed for the end of those things is death all that other stuff we used today but now being made free from sin and become service to God you have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord now remember this is not chapter 7 this is a continuation of the letter that Paul wrote to the Romans we put that number 7 there and and it would say you know pause take a break he's fixing to change is 70 no he's not he's speaking to the same people as he was right here he says know ye not brethren for us be for them that know oh how that the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman was how the husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law and her husband okay naturally thanks beautiful right so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress natural and spiritual that's what Dan basically was trying to get plenty coffee his wife was committing what adultery all right she was going after another man of course there's only one Satan and God only two forces we need to deal with so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man now look that husband's gotta be dead now in the natural I heard him preach dick well my wife's dead because she's nothing to me no he's your life sucking air or your husband suck in there he still lies same way with God yes say it still sucking air in your soul you're dead ok you can't man him I am but if he be dead can I say it that way he be dead if you husband be dad are you I'd be dead you can marry again and though she will not have been adulteress though she be married to another man cuz we were married to say yes we didn't get a divorce right the old husband had died and once that all husband died you freed American actor and spiritually I wear for my brother you also are become dead to the wall by the body of Christ now watch here that law of what killed you put you in jail that was your old husband it's right but I didn't do away with the law I stink another nation I was preaching somewhere maybe in here was talking about this new preacher some was talking about the it says being come dead to the law now that doesn't mean you take the lawn throw it away we all still live under law sorry but the law is in the liberty of Jesus Christ Paul's won't tell us that later on we have Liberty under that law but you don't do away with the law he just said up in do we do it alone God for me you can't do away with the law we're actually the only people that can live the law where the all the people that can understand the law because remember Jesus was the law giver the Bible said Judah he comes from Judah the law giver all right but it wasn't a law like written down at the 10 well like somebody said till the day they're now 10 suggestions there are 10 commandments so you know they're just 10 suggestions they watered it down so much you know God says you can't commit adultery said you can't kill to steal not this thing so anyway but if we become dead to the law by the body of Christ that he should be married to another even to him the race of the Dead would come up Jews crime that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh nopal are we not on flex now yes we're still in the flash name okay we still got flash we still got flash but watch the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death alright cuz remember anybody that is not born again you're under the law because like I said it's not gonna be a law where you woke up in they go well now you smoke you drank you stole something you did no you just didn't believe why I say it that's all I gotta say you just didn't believe what is that and then eternal welcome but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held this is a S&OP see really where we are now we used to be dead dead people now we're dead live people I mean really we are just as their dead people walking out there we're dead now because we got to be dead to Christ right all right to walk in newness of life watch where we are now delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held we were day that's greater than dead then now we're live dead that we should serve in newness of spirit and non of the illness of the letter why shall we say then is the law of sin god forbid the law is not sin nay I had not known sin but by the law same way with us cut it with a condemn ur my brother L says it was a record keeper it kept everything you did you didn't do that she didn't do that you didn't right for I had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet all right but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me and all mayor of come dispenses that means a longing a desire a lust desire craving longing desire what for sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of come compte penances one without the law San was dead in other words there was nothing to condemn you know right and you have to be careful with this because I believe that that's where a lot of the denominations and even brother Dale brings it out that many people say there was no Santa County to people until the law came into effect comes remember ever having live under the law mm-hmm Enoch Noah all those people up until Moses coming to Mount Sinai they didn't have a long history but they live by the law their own self their self choice because Adam had the element you gotta make a sacrifice you got to do this you got to do that you can't do this you can't do that that was to me that was Adam that was Adam bringing into law that they lived them because you really didn't have Ten Commandments until Moses 101 outside yeah hey bruh ham I think Jacob Joseph all those people never lived under a law written down thou shalt not thou shalt not that same time so a lot of people tainted to them but no you gotta have even before Adam there was a law because God said you do this this will happen you do this this will happen that's a law the law said if you don't go over 670 miles an hour you won't get caught the law said if you went seventy so one out I'm doing when I was 17 my little mouth put it in terms like that he broke the law he broke God's law first time Fran I was alive without the law once it was a living person but when the commandment came sin revived and I got it and look in the commandment which was ordained to life I found to be unto death that's what condemned or brought Israel the Ten Commandments that's what Israel lived and died under because he found it to be death once he comes up to his time he looks back at the law and he's like man I what'd he do why did he do under the law he killed Christian he killed Christian he'd have a New Testament didn't have nothing new he took that Old Testament and killed them very Christians that were supposed to be you know supposed to be and they were ordained alive they were a Christian they were born again people and he was prosecuting or persecuting them and prosecute because he founded them to be death once he got him looking at him looking on the road to man to Damascus he saw he said Lord so he knew that he was talking to Jogja right here comes all the law I bet you when Paul was laying on the ground he was like I didn't commit adultery I didn't commit this I didn't do this I didn't do that I didn't do it come here was why he was a Jew he was old he was a law he was under the law so I mean yeah and his brain is like I didn't do this I than that but Jesus said he's the Lord who out there he said I am Jesus who you are persecuting and buddy you're talking about a roman camera went off and Paul whoa because what he was gonna do he I think just for me Paul was going water who worked out he was gonna say well I'm Jehovah the old a knight thou shalt got this and thou shalt not too happy when he said thou are persecuting me who them Christians Paul got a whole new revelation of what he was doing cuz he was killing them under the law and he was dying under the law because well because what he was went to Nord Angela I found him to be unto death for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by its looming wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good there's nothing wrong with the law gun rody was then that which is good made death unto me God permitted but sin that it might appear sin worketh death in me by that which is good just what I explained we thought he was doing the right thing he could read it in the scripture he could read it in the Old Testament he knew what it was where it was coming from but yet his revelation persecuted the Christian yes they might appear but send that amount of pierced him worketh death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful the exceeding sinful part is is what he would from he was persecuting Christians didn't even know well they're not they're not you know they're not Sabbatarians and they're not you know they're not worshiping Jehovah and they're doing this and they're doing that it was a long pause pause zealous of the law but he found out the law was what was killing him then threw him killing the Christian saints but Pearson working death in me by back which is good that's the law it's good yeah but it was working death in him because what we just what we were just talking about that stand by the Commandant might become exceeding sinful see while they aren't doing this so we're going to persecute them anywhere there there there he called them centers yeah he called them centers because of the law he called them sinners yes but he found out he was one for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold understand what the lost spiritual but his carnal interpretation of that law it's what made it but I am carnal sold under sin what he knew that in his mind his carnal mind was what was killing him right for that which I do not allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that it now at this time Paul's born again so he what he's doing though he Rimmer he's writing a letter to the Romans telling them his experience that's what defends the whole thing's been his experience under his experience under the law being dead coming out of the law being alive in Christ but being dead in Christ right but now for that one that which I did I allowed on now what's he talking about he's moved out into the next man into that middle man so she can't stand in your soul be born again God can't sin so you can't go back into that for that which I do I allow not for what I would they do I not but what I hate that I do yes then I knew that which I would not in other words you find do the things I shouldn't I can sent unto the wall then he's good cuz the law says you can't come in adultery don't don't touch a girl he knows the law of him magnify Jesus that I say into um them if you look along to the left after you come into don't you whether now look it is the no.of now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me oh my goodness Paul ain't coming myself any no my soul leave so much that spear round man can't be talking about the soul sand can't dwell in your soul if you're born again but send dwells in your memories and conscience faces imagination before I know that inmate that is in my flesh not my flash but in my flesh like I said before forget this thing this thing only does what that ends I got tell it to do all right for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing Paul you just told us back up here one scripture before that we're dead in Christ and alive and I mean we're dead to sin we're alive in Christ and everything's good and happy and wonderful in the soul that's the truth but Paul is telling us do other than no good thing for to will is present with me the soul wants to the soul no the soul wants to do this always want to do good fortune will is present with me what - will - will did everything everything I do is perfect and spiritual and according to God but how to perform that which is good I find not any veteran because he leaned to his memory lane this conscious in Linda say listen this guy couldn't forget what he did to those Christian that's right and now haunted him all of his life what he did because you know what the sins I made haunts me it doesn't all die that's right it haunts me but when we realized though that we've moved from that for the good that I would I do not souls always did if you mourning and your soul is always good your soul never does anything wrong yes man but when it comes out through that filter you got another man coming in from this way or another spirit coming in from this way that's the same way with him for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I knew Paul now watch it now if I knew that I would not and there's no more I'd to do it but sin that dwelleth in me followed up Paul knows all right he's not talking that it's all but in his spirit around with Santa per day that's what he's thinking but remember and here's another paradox we've got to take what Paul said and change that middle name he can't change that middle name at one time it wasn't the place he wasn't in the Eagle Age he didn't have the word even though he wrote the word he didn't have the word to take that middle and and do away with sin so that's what you and I did take a lot of change that middle man's who we got to work on it's all about already change fleshes just here to hold everything together except mental got where the Bible is look because I find that along then what I would do good evil is present with me all right same way with all those if you can't relate to live then you're either not born again or you just digna even that's not bad if you stay England you it becomes the other word evil this practice of the same way with all of us Friday light in the law of God after the inward man that polities watch he's taking this thing and he's bringing it right over and tonight in my soul I delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law not in the flash not a soul but I see another law in my members warrior guests along my mind where do you lose your memory from you mind because remember this is the paradox in your soul that person of your soul you don't remember sin it can't if it's Almighty God he can't sin didn't singers and can't ever seen is that alright so when you think of thought this contrary to God he didn't tell me as oh I promise you frogs a lot of the Gulf law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity you said there long enough and in your memory the things you've done it will captivate you and you'll think you're the worst centered ever lived and you were and you are just go ahead and minute you were but that this man that's in the soul he's going once and you don't man I mean read me all that stuff that we did sure we remember it sure we did it in our flashes right but if you're born again this soul person never did it phase one speck of sin in that soul you're not born again that's right eternal as God is pure as God is and perfect so it can't be eternal without being perfect all right so you come from there's that I'll tell you same thing right Friday light is the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind what yes you can know you can know you can't yes you can and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members Paul I don't you the born-again Christian I am I just have a problem in that middle round okay Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from the body of this death he's asking the question I save God through Jesus Christ our Lord that's all he can do I'll end up do Jesus Christ our Lord knowing that's his Redeemer so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law sin because remember you don't need your soul I'll bring it out there some won't bring that but another goes remember with my mind I myself serve the law of God that way something I don't know watching in my mind but look he's got another law warring against along my mind ok because remember God takes the heart saved chose the money right this is what's got to start being purified this is all ready for your fight at this morning in done alright yeah let me read now the dialog just for a few minutes and let's see what it says here all right are you a nut brethren for I am speaking to those who are acquainted with the law that the law controls a man for as long a time as he lives hence the married woman is bound by law to the living husband see that's pretty clearly not God but if the husband died she is released from the law of the husband so then while the husband is living she will be declared an adulteress if she belonged to another man but if the husband died she is free from the law so if she is not an adulteress though she belongs to another man wherefore wherefore therefore my brethren ye also were put to death by the law through the body of the Anointed One in order that you may belong to another to him who was raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit to God verse 5 for when we were in the flesh those sinful passions which were 3 the law worked in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now for 6 having died we are released from the law by which we were held so that we may serve in newness of spirit and not an illness of letter that what then shall we say is the law sin by no means indeed verse 10 says verse 7 indeed I did not know sin except to the law very clearly for even for even strong desire I have not known yet the law had not said that stop not cut it her faith but stand having taken opportunity through the commandment worked in me an all strong desire apart from the law however sin is dead verse 9 and I was formerly living apart from the law but the commandment having come sin lived again and I died verse 10 will stop within that commandment intended for life the same was found by me for death I mean [Music]
