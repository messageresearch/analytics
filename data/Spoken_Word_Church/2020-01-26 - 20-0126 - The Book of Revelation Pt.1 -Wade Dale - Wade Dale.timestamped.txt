[0:00] Hart doesn't have you with us hope you
[0:04] have a blessed time here and I know
[0:07] we're rough we're gonna have a blessed
[0:10] time because we opened the Word of God
[0:12] so let's get started in Revelation
[0:15] chapter 1 I told you to read Melanson
[0:18] chapter 1 what we're gonna do is is
[0:21] we're gonna go through and read the
[0:24] whole first chapter and then come back
[0:27] in and then comment back through that
[0:31] okay
[0:32] that way we'll read it and get the gist
[0:34] of all of it and we'll have some week
[0:37] everybody gonna as people come in you're
[0:39] gonna have to suck it up buttercup let
[0:44] people sit beside this because I wasn't
[0:47] your size not here these making in Libya
[0:50] c-level team today but just in case
[0:52] anybody else comes in revelations
[0:54] chapter 1 now we're going to study but
[0:57] there it would be good for you to read
[0:59] the church age book but like I said
[1:01] before try to read the individual sermon
[1:05] alright because the individual sermons
[1:08] will help you as we go through each
[1:12] verse excuse me verse by verse reason
[1:17] being the church age book if you didn't
[1:18] know this the church age book is a
[1:20] compilation or a compiling of all those
[1:23] sermons and then they took off the tape
[1:26] brotherly veil and composed it how many
[1:31] people don't like the church thinking
[1:32] book cause I think Lee veil had
[1:33] something to do with it what he did but
[1:37] he put it together and listen brother
[1:41] Branham read it before he passed away
[1:43] looking after the seal for open he read
[1:45] the book and released it so that was in
[1:48] 1960 in the latter part of 63 64 he
[1:52] released it and approved it so as far as
[1:54] I'm concerned it's the word guy
[1:57] it's what the prophets said and many
[2:01] people say it's leave out the book many
[2:02] people say it's a woman's book cousin
[2:04] woman topped it anyway
[2:07] I say
[2:07] yeah well they say they say that she was
[2:10] confident she manipulated it but no if
[2:14] we believe brother Brown would be a
[2:16] prophet of word prophet and that word
[2:18] prophet read that book if the Holy Ghost
[2:21] didn't interpret it that's correct then
[2:25] he would have changed it would have been
[2:27] changed right
[2:28] I saw notes one time with brother
[2:30] Branham actually it was brother rounds
[2:32] handwriting and he would write like
[2:34] during the writing of it that's right
[2:36] like letters to female right well what
[2:39] he done was he ranted and I'm sure he
[2:43] made additions and corrections and then
[2:48] they printed the book but he read the
[2:51] book as it was printed so I believe it's
[2:54] I believe it's something that's on it to
[2:56] me it's got all the major doctrines in
[2:58] it he's got all the things in it friend
[3:00] you convert I would not let him you
[3:02] convert have a seal book right until
[3:07] about 10 years after they I think become
[3:10] well not now because the time we're
[3:12] living in the 11th hour worker may get a
[3:14] little more but but the church age book
[3:16] is more stage right with the with the
[3:19] doctrines of the of the Bible but those
[3:23] individual sermons he preached each
[3:25] individual sermon out of the Bible
[3:29] right so that's why I told you to read
[3:32] the individual books if you want to if
[3:35] not we're gonna read it and we read here
[3:37] so the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[3:40] God gave it to him now watch excuse me
[3:43] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[3:44] gave unto him this is not three people
[3:46] here two people right to show unto his
[3:49] servants things which must shortly come
[3:51] to pass
[3:52] I'm telling you what I'm gonna do and
[3:54] I'll tell you here before when I get
[3:56] finished with revival I'm kind of
[4:00] thinking on a sermon called a transfer
[4:02] of power okay a transfer of power so
[4:06] just keep that kind of right around in
[4:08] your head so that's what I've been
[4:09] thinking about because there is a
[4:10] transfer of power alright because look
[4:13] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[4:14] gave them him so God gave something the
[4:18] Jesus Christ the position
[4:19] an extra person but a position that God
[4:24] with what condescending to Jesus Christ
[4:26] and then Jesus Christ Christ
[4:28] condescending to a messenger and let me
[4:31] give you a little bit background about
[4:33] this John
[4:34] it's called the Revelator because he
[4:36] wrote the book of Revelation and he also
[4:37] wrote first thing third giant and he
[4:41] also wrote the book of done all right so
[4:44] John was a really young guy he was the
[4:46] only apostle to die of natural causes he
[4:49] was like 90 something years old when he
[4:51] died he actually passed her some of the
[4:54] churches that Paul had set up even after
[4:56] Paul had had passed off ghosts Paul
[4:59] passed off in like 1866 and I think this
[5:02] was in 96 or something that John went to
[5:05] the Isle of Patmos but John was
[5:07] commissioned and we'll read it here now
[5:10] to write the things he saw not to
[5:12] interpret but the rites of things he saw
[5:16] and send it to the churches so John was
[5:18] the young boy that was under under Jesus
[5:22] Jesus goes off the same Paul goes off
[5:25] the same and John is commissioned there
[5:28] actually John was trying to put some of
[5:31] the Gospels together and the Romans or
[5:35] whoever it was the hierarchy didn't want
[5:37] him to do it so they hold him in oil for
[5:39] a long period of time he just took a
[5:42] good bath and made his skin feel good
[5:44] but it was boiling oil and God preserved
[5:47] him changed him to preserve him to bring
[5:50] us to a place to where he was going to
[5:51] write this because remember what Jesus
[5:53] said back when they were doing the load
[5:56] doing the fishes on the side of the bank
[5:58] after the resurrection jesus said what
[6:00] is it today if somebody sees the kingdom
[6:03] coming
[6:04] well then remember the Bible says people
[6:07] say anyone out that who he was talking
[6:10] to John that somebody was going to live
[6:12] until Christ came back well that's not
[6:14] morning what John and revelation saw
[6:17] becoming apart
[6:19] he saw the hold it to me this rebel Book
[6:21] of Revelations is the whole kingdom
[6:23] Jew Gentile foolish virgin Antichrist
[6:29] everything is in this that's my brother
[6:31] always calls if the bride's book because
[6:34] it is it's for the ride to the bride and
[6:36] written by the bride John was part of
[6:42] the bride of that age John was a part of
[6:45] the bride for the first verse age down
[6:47] here there back out there so John was
[6:49] commissioned so they couldn't kill him
[6:53] by balling him so they said well we just
[6:55] gonna put you in the worst place in the
[6:57] world we're gonna put you on the island
[6:58] of Patmos where there's nothing but
[7:01] rocks and scorpions and snakes and they
[7:03] just figured if we leave John let him
[7:05] roam around a little bit out there the
[7:07] snake almighty Mara scorpion bite him
[7:09] and kill him and just get rid of him
[7:10] he'll just die but he didn't he came
[7:13] back because what did God tell him to
[7:16] take these things and bring it back to
[7:19] the churches I want you to get something
[7:22] there God predestinated somebody to do
[7:29] this join took a hold of the revelation
[7:33] that he wasn't gonna die
[7:37] until he saw all that stay plays man and
[7:42] he's in the middle of Patmos he's in a
[7:44] horrible place and then when God tell
[7:46] him says look take these back to the
[7:48] church so he knows he's gonna get off
[7:50] the island what am I saying you look at
[7:53] the promises in the Bible about you
[7:56] you can't die unless these promises are
[7:58] fulfilled
[7:59] amen so yeah that's when we got a look
[8:01] at is then John literally Tom the whole
[8:05] bride our whole journey from from
[8:08] predestination to body change listen
[8:11] some have changed his body while he was
[8:12] in that oil his skin would have fell off
[8:16] his body so he took a body change while
[8:19] he was in the oil God give him a pat I
[8:21] mean a temporary body change why because
[8:25] he told him while he was here
[8:26] somebody's gonna live to write and see
[8:29] the kingdom yeah of course I believe
[8:30] Jesus knew it was John but he didn't he
[8:32] didn't just physically say that it was
[8:34] but I like what John writes in in in the
[8:37] book of John the one that's closest to
[8:40] Jesus one that laid on his breast the
[8:42] young one that did
[8:43] you thought myself he just didn't want
[8:45] to say Jesus loved me more than the rest
[8:49] of me just didn't want to say that he it
[8:51] was real real humble but look what John
[8:54] did though John spent his whole entire
[8:55] life all the other 11 apostles died and
[8:59] martyrdom a lot of them didn't make it
[9:02] past four or five years after Jesus
[9:04] before me I mean Jesus left this thing
[9:06] yeah
[9:06] : were dispersed James was killed by
[9:08] Emperor additional Windom Indian got
[9:10] killed and this man all got him except
[9:12] for remember Peter was crucified upside
[9:14] down
[9:15] but John was commissioned to see the
[9:18] coming aboard
[9:19] no not to see the physical coming but he
[9:22] did see in physical horn good what let's
[9:27] read this revelation of Jesus Christ
[9:29] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[9:33] servants things which must shortly come
[9:35] to pass
[9:36] zeikos when John writes this they're
[9:38] already in the first church age you get
[9:41] some history behind it they're already
[9:43] in the first church age goes first
[9:45] Church ages 1853 to 170 and this is
[9:47] about 90 something if you got a Scofield
[9:49] Bible weekend it'll tell you and you can
[9:51] copy the page what year that that was
[9:54] written but they've got one Oh John you
[9:56] got it
[9:56] anybody got Scofield Bible what is
[9:58] anything 90 see yes okay so see we're
[10:02] right in the middle of this church age
[10:04] already when he gets this to send to the
[10:07] churches and he sent and signified it by
[10:13] his angel unto his servant John now I'm
[10:17] gonna debunk a myth right now that was
[10:20] not brother Branham brother round did
[10:22] not appear to nobody in the whole book
[10:25] of Revelation he was spoken of as being
[10:31] the last he's the last star he's one of
[10:33] these seven stars okay no doubt but he's
[10:39] not the person William Branham because
[10:41] that would mean pre-existence or so that
[10:43] means it brother brown would have to be
[10:46] full grown be up the apogee somewhere no
[10:49] that's not right now people teach it in
[10:52] the message I want to quote from that I
[10:54] don't
[10:55] wanted night I've got everything that
[10:57] brother Brown says about soul what were
[10:59] you before you were born he said nothing
[11:02] right now in the mind of God
[11:04] absolutely but you were nothing before
[11:07] you were born
[11:08] you were in the mind of God and you
[11:10] develop down here on the earth
[11:11] so a brother round goes to John he goes
[11:14] back 2,000 years before he was born and
[11:18] appears to John I got a problem with
[11:22] that number two problem I have with it
[11:23] is if brother Branham was one who told
[11:25] John all this my brother drowned the man
[11:27] have to get the sales angel by and all
[11:33] the other sermons from the angel that
[11:36] met brother Branham okay so let's get it
[11:40] straight this was prophesied this was an
[11:44] angel that came to John to give him the
[11:50] message now remember to that revelation
[11:53] of Jesus Christ God gave to Jesus and
[11:56] Jesus gave it to John so there's no
[11:58] in-between there it was Christ talking
[12:02] and appearing to John because it's the
[12:04] first thing that happens right here John
[12:07] hears voice turns around and says here's
[12:09] the trumpet turns around he sees the man
[12:12] then he won't live for three and a half
[12:14] years okay so he knows that that guy he
[12:18] actually heard the voice in knew the
[12:19] voice but hearing a trumpet he turns and
[12:22] sees no but now watch who he sees he
[12:25] sees Christ and bride form for watch all
[12:29] right let's go through and read and he
[12:32] sent signified it by his angel to his
[12:34] servant John I just want you to get that
[12:35] out of your mind
[12:36] there's no William Brown there's no
[12:37] better see I make him a respecter Park
[12:39] daughter respecter of person that would
[12:41] make him to wear run around was born
[12:42] perfect he was born the angel romance
[12:47] when he was born States and he had
[12:50] children by sex I'm just gonna be plain
[12:52] so he wasn't not okay
[12:56] there's no way he can be gone then just
[12:59] make a quick comment on the shirts
[13:00] Peugeot hitting's if if if John types
[13:03] the bride and I'm and we are the Bride
[13:06] of Christ and if you see yourself in the
[13:09] word the way you should the revelation
[13:11] of Jesus Christ which God gave unto you
[13:14] that's right that's right see so word
[13:17] like brotherly sinner where the bride
[13:18] today we're reading about what God told
[13:21] us that's true
[13:22] okay through a prophet but he told it to
[13:26] us the correct form because see there's
[13:29] a lot of people preaching this today in
[13:31] the Book of Revelations number one -
[13:33] can't understand what's going on hold
[13:35] the symbols we had to have a prophet and
[13:37] I'm gonna read it this afternoon we had
[13:40] to have a prophet come so we can even
[13:42] have a revival because it was so
[13:43] scattered God cannot quick and word
[13:47] that's not seed work it's not real work
[13:50] because who quickens non seed not Christ
[13:54] came quick and dicey so that's what he's
[13:56] saying the jerkbait book and it's very
[13:59] common to know that in non seat there's
[14:01] nothing to quicken so whatever seed now
[14:03] it's Satan does so safe remember he was
[14:05] people do this but it's what tires and
[14:11] it's going to come up got to live them
[14:13] let them alone let them grow up and
[14:16] that's what's happening now they were
[14:18] touring you see the week doing their job
[14:20] when you see the tears doing their job
[14:22] so this is God talking to us but it had
[14:26] that when he he had to bring a conduit
[14:29] called William Brown a conduit to
[14:32] straighten out all the white he said
[14:34] loose ends and the Book of Revelations
[14:37] is the worst misunderstood book all the
[14:43] samples and everything man's got all
[14:44] these different things but he took a
[14:46] prophet to come and lay him right down
[14:47] and say hey this is it who bare record
[14:53] of the word of God and of the testimony
[14:54] of Jesus Christ and of all things that
[14:57] he saw so now what John gonna do John's
[15:01] gonna set and he's going to see a vision
[15:04] okay he's gonna see a vision of what's
[15:06] going on blessed is he that readeth
[15:09] we're blessed today because we're
[15:12] reading it blessing us either read us
[15:15] and that means read this not read one
[15:17] time and they that hear the words of
[15:21] this prophecy because a lot of this
[15:24] remember is going to be prophecy because
[15:27] it's in the future that's why the Book
[15:30] of Revelations is called the apocalypse
[15:32] which is the end all right in the end
[15:35] time
[15:35] blessed is he that readeth they to hear
[15:37] the words of this prophecy and keep
[15:39] those things which are written therein
[15:41] how blessed can we be for the time of
[15:43] the hand now look the time of the time
[15:46] was a hand in what for the revelation
[15:48] but now's the time for us to make that
[15:50] revelation real make it known I join to
[15:56] the seven churches which are in Asia and
[15:59] see there's nobody and that's what gets
[16:01] me is is Paul didn't walk through life
[16:04] going on the first terrific messenger
[16:07] know what reveal today was a probably
[16:10] sure it didn't thing I rainiest Martin
[16:12] Columbo Luke Wesley didn't come up
[16:14] saying when I'm the snake sturgeons
[16:16] messenger no he had a message but it
[16:19] took this man to take all this and put
[16:23] it together to where all the ages came
[16:26] right and all the messengers came right
[16:29] that's okay
[16:30] so it took they did take William Brown
[16:32] to do it but it was the Holy Ghost Ed
[16:34] had always a new seed when the Holy
[16:35] Ghost wrote that they knew the first he
[16:37] knew the first church a few just Paul
[16:39] the second was Irena
[16:40] he's everybody didn't call their name it
[16:42] was a mystery this whole book of
[16:44] revelations of the mystery but now it's
[16:47] revealed in the end time who these
[16:48] people he's talking to because the seven
[16:51] churches now are right here they've been
[16:54] told been revealed grace beyond you a
[16:58] piece from him which ends which was and
[17:00] which is to come from the seven spirits
[17:02] which are before the throne seven
[17:05] messengers are here revelation
[17:07] so there were seven spirits which are
[17:10] before his strong and through Jesus
[17:13] Christ who is the faithful witness and
[17:15] the first begotten of the Dead in other
[17:17] words he was the one first one to
[17:19] resurrect to eternal life and from Jesus
[17:26] Christ the faithful witness and the
[17:28] first begotten of the Dead and the
[17:29] Prince of the kings of the earth and to
[17:32] him that loved us and washed us from our
[17:34] sins in his own blood John knew he
[17:37] needed a saviour washed us from our own
[17:41] sins in his own blood and have made us
[17:43] know what is the transfer of power and
[17:45] has made us and from Jesus Christ who is
[17:49] the faithful and true witness first
[17:50] because of the dead Prince of the kings
[17:52] of the earth period unto him that loved
[17:54] us and washed us from our sins in his
[17:56] own blood ,
[17:57] and have made us kings and priests unto
[18:00] God and his father to him be glory and
[18:03] Dominion for ever and ever amen behold
[18:06] he cometh with clouds and every eye
[18:08] shall steam and they also which pierced
[18:10] him there's the Jews and all Kindred's
[18:13] of the earth shall wail because of him
[18:15] now that covers everybody he cometh in
[18:19] the cloud every eye shall see him now
[18:21] remember we seem the way the Bible
[18:24] presents him everybody else is gonna see
[18:26] him in different ways
[18:27] because remember he's not to the mossad
[18:30] to the Jews yet to them he is the
[18:33] Messiah but inside they not accepted him
[18:35] yet
[18:36] the foolish version will have to accept
[18:38] the eternal life at the white throne
[18:41] judgment and the foolish virgin and cup
[18:44] of water my name all that's gonna be but
[18:46] that's everybody I am Alpha and Omega
[18:50] the beginning and the ending saith the
[18:53] LORD which is which was and which is to
[18:56] come the Almighty you know I'll bring
[19:01] you a little key here in just a minute
[19:02] because he says I'm Alpha and Omega now
[19:05] alpha is what alpha is the first letter
[19:08] of the Greek alphabet right
[19:10] and Omega is the last like our Z hey you
[19:15] busy right from a disease so he's from
[19:18] alpha to Omega so what he's saying is is
[19:20] this not enough to discluded any of this
[19:22] but he had to start somewhere
[19:24] yes and he's gonna have to end somewhere
[19:27] and it's gonna be the same person yeah I
[19:31] am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[19:34] ending said the Lord which is which was
[19:36] and which is to come the Almighty

[21:09] it writing a book and sending to the
[21:10] seven churches which are in Asia unto
[21:12] Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis
[21:16] Philadelphia and Laodicea all right so
[21:20] there's your seven
[21:21] but the prophet of God he had the bottle
[21:23] hem in line but they didn't have the
[21:25] date so the property God put some dates
[21:28] in there but remember each church ain't
[21:31] slaps over each other so there's not a
[21:34] definite cutoff point and a definite
[21:37] starting point this was just when they
[21:39] started accepting the message of that
[21:42] hour never I got that because you got to
[21:45] remember in Columbus time I think it was
[21:47] Colombo they died before his church they
[21:50] even started and that flipped people out
[21:54] but it shouldn't it's the message it's
[21:56] the people that catches the messengers
[21:58] message that's the importance if not
[22:01] it's just Paul preached to itself and he
[22:03] dies there is no Ephesus church right no
[22:08] Columbo brought his message and he
[22:11] passed on but people took same them
[22:14] brother around some message is nothing
[22:17] without the people here most powerful
[22:21] message since the message of Jesus
[22:22] Christ but it has to come to people not
[22:25] to take the point exclusively all right
[22:31] so now Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum stock
[22:33] tower Sardis Philadelphia lab see if
[22:35] this is God telling John that
[22:39] something's gonna I'm gonna send these
[22:42] messages to the church right and I
[22:45] turned to see the voice that spake with
[22:47] me and being turned
[22:50] now look watch me Russ right here within
[22:53] the spirit Lord's Day and heard behind
[22:54] me a great voice as of a trumpet and the
[22:58] trumpet said so remember trumpets or not
[23:00] notes on a scale a trumpet in the Bible
[23:06] is a voice the shout divorce to Trump he
[23:10] showed us him from heaven with what no
[23:12] see you even in the you read
[23:15] commentaries of people and you read the
[23:17] comment and it's not laughable but it's
[23:19] all they know that this great horns
[23:23] gonna sound like a like a tornado alarm
[23:29] you know yo you seen the tornado drill
[23:32] you've heard me
[23:32] alarm you know they think that's what's
[23:34] gonna happen like dad and his brother
[23:36] long you know the brother walked off the
[23:38] tables gonna be this beast come walk up
[23:40] out of the you know come walking up out
[23:42] of them right out of the water and go
[23:45] two horns and seven eyes on these horn
[23:48] and that's going to be a mystery but
[23:53] we'll get into that that's why God sent
[23:54] probably that we can be so sure of what
[23:57] God said in this Bible and I turned to
[24:01] see the voice that spake with me now
[24:02] John literally was going to turn around
[24:04] and say hey Jesus how you doing
[24:06] that's singing them few years for maybe
[24:10] thirty to ninety six I've grown old and
[24:13] you're not but what did he say
[24:16] when he turned he saw seven golden
[24:18] candlesticks which represents what our
[24:23] lamp stands now you can go all the way
[24:24] back in the Old Testament with that
[24:27] seven golden candlesticks then brother
[24:29] Brown describe that as look one bulb
[24:32] they didn't fill each individual one of
[24:34] these up they filled them all up and
[24:38] there were wigs and as they filled it up
[24:41] the oil would come up out of one bow oh
[24:44] there's only one Holy Ghost that's right
[24:46] it was the Holy Ghost in every church
[24:48] aids not going foreign here and here and
[24:50] here no important in one bowl on the day
[24:52] of Pentecost reported in 120 volts
[24:55] then the 120 bowls poured into 3,000
[24:58] bowls in the three thousand three
[25:00] million in here we are today cause boil
[25:03] is a type of the Holy Ghost okay so you
[25:08] have that oil and that's what happened
[25:11] in the Old Testaments thinking today
[25:12] third thing yesterday here's Moses and
[25:15] here's Aaron standing getting ready to
[25:17] go into the Holy of Holies and Moses has
[25:20] got to literally cover that man's whole
[25:23] body Bible says from the top of his head
[25:27] to the sole of his feet had to be oil
[25:31] see that's the top the Holy Ghost we see
[25:33] the Holy Ghost is to fill you not
[25:38] partially fill you
[25:40] but Phil you from him to toe now that's
[25:42] Dec to me that to me that types the body
[25:46] change because when Aaron went back into
[25:48] the Holy of Holies he was standing in
[25:52] front of God there was no intercessor
[25:53] there was no Jesus Christ it easy there
[25:57] was no human body intercessor called
[25:59] Jesus
[26:00] it was Jehovah which was Jesus Christ we
[26:03] know that but anyway when Aaron walked
[26:05] in there he could have face-to-face to
[26:07] the cloud or pillar fire whatever was
[26:11] and then here he was and he had no like
[26:13] me and you the Bible tells us now we
[26:15] could go where to go boldly before the
[26:17] throne of grace when we pull back the
[26:19] curtains already being pulled back on
[26:20] the holy of holies you now are all you
[26:23] now are all the holy of holies yeah
[26:25] everybody okay y'all okay back there
[26:27] okay okay all right I don't I don't want
[26:30] to get too elaborate let's just kind of
[26:34] stay with with this here but the semi
[26:36] gold kinda stays downstairs go to
[26:37] account stage there was a person
[26:39] standing in the midst of the seven
[26:42] candlesticks alright now there's a
[26:46] picture I think upstairs but he's strong
[26:49] right here for those beautiful see this
[26:55] is the church ages signified by them by
[27:00] the lamp stand or candlestick
[27:14] [Music]
[27:22] I said I'm throwing it out
[27:30] no laughing from the older people but
[27:36] now there's your oil going up through
[27:39] each taking out all the church age you
[27:41] got these little things of it'll lift
[27:43] and then what do you have you got a man
[27:47] cuz he heard a voice the voice was a
[27:51] man's voice right cuz there's no female
[27:54] voice our voice is his voice we are the
[27:58] female part of Christ but we don't have
[28:01] our own voice in that now that's what
[28:04] gets us in trouble
[28:04] that's what got the church agents in
[28:06] trouble they started letting a woman not
[28:07] a woman physical but a woman Church take
[28:10] over but you got a man standing here
[28:12] forgive me Lord I'm sorry but here's his
[28:15] arm this way here's his arm this way
[28:17] he's standing in the mix he's got his
[28:20] arms stretched out alpha only them he's
[28:24] everything every bit of part of him is
[28:26] here here here here here here and here
[28:31] it's all Jesus class in Bride form
[28:37] transfer of power Jesus goes back to the
[28:41] Father to stand on the right hand of
[28:43] power but then he transfers that power
[28:48] because what's this being turned I saw
[28:52] seven going ten stick in the midst of
[28:54] the seven candlesticks are lamps in one
[28:57] lock at the son of man who is the son of
[28:59] man Jesus Christ is deep son man if I
[29:02] got that all right that should be
[29:04] ingrained in our brain the son of man is
[29:09] God in human flesh the son of God is God
[29:14] entering into human flesh if I got that
[29:17] yeah okay that's why you call this the
[29:19] song god dispensation because it was God
[29:21] in man yes but the son of man is God
[29:26] Himself can't a human flesh okay
[29:29] everybody got that but let's see what
[29:31] for meat ain't what
[29:36] one like unto the Son of Man because
[29:40] John sees him standing here and remember
[29:44] John's right here in time wise time wise
[29:49] John's in the first church angels he
[29:51] don't know anything about all these
[29:52] others know yet because Jesus has got to
[29:56] identify who he is and where he is who
[30:01] is and where he is before he can begin
[30:04] to church ages because John then says
[30:07] hey it's Christ in this age Christ in
[30:09] this age and this state this state this
[30:11] age and they say no I just in the first
[30:13] page in the last day
[30:14] alpha know meet up all in between all
[30:18] right right there was just more seed
[30:21] this was this was the what the
[30:25] foundation church and this is going to
[30:28] be the headstone or the ending Church
[30:30] cornerstone hence dumb because remember
[30:33] the cornerstone came that's going didn't
[30:34] comment on the first Earth Day okay
[30:37] the headstone came here who D son of man
[30:39] right look let's hold it down but he was
[30:43] clothed with the garment down to his
[30:45] feet and gird about the paths now we're
[30:49] all adults here so we know what that is
[30:51] breast okay Pat's its breast so why was
[30:57] he or chest you can say but Pat's means
[31:01] breath anywhere in a Bible you say why
[31:06] in the world that kind of looks weird
[31:07] that's the form he's in he's in a woman
[31:11] form now called his bride yes right Amen
[31:16] now watch what he says locked into man
[31:18] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[31:20] and dirt dirt our God a piece of cloth
[31:26] about the paps with a golden girdle
[31:31] signifying that he's going to be in a
[31:34] feminist form called the bride now Jesus
[31:37] is not a female but when John looks at
[31:41] and you look at this whole thing this is
[31:43] the church ages yet Church has always
[31:45] been what female we've been the FEMA
[31:48] part of Jesus Christ just like go back
[31:52] and listen to what brother Aaron he did
[31:53] aruba job well now I've had to have a
[31:57] female bride to reproduce yourself he
[32:00] cannot reproduce with what he had he had
[32:03] to have a bride Christ had to have a
[32:07] bride to reproduce yourself called on
[32:11] the day of Pentecost he came back to the
[32:13] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:14] birthed them into the body and they
[32:17] became the church are the bride of Jesus
[32:20] Christ he didn't have a bride when he's
[32:22] on earth did not did have a one now one
[32:28] person was born again bride even John
[32:31] the Baptist that the Bible said was full
[32:34] of the Holy Ghost maybe one minutes all
[32:37] right that's right it wasn't in his soul
[32:40] or he'd been a born-again believer but
[32:43] the Bible says what though Jesus says
[32:46] huh you think John so great John Baptist
[32:48] now not John the Revelator done badness
[32:50] you think John the Baptist was so great
[32:52] the least one of that 120 in the upper
[32:55] room is greater than John the mammoth
[32:58] because why John the Baptist what in the
[33:00] kingdom he was there to introduce from
[33:03] the Old Testament to the New Testament
[33:05] he introduced Christ and then Christ did
[33:07] the work could dumb one off the same
[33:10] same way in the end time I'm just gonna
[33:13] be playing that's my brother ends not
[33:15] with us that's why God took him off the
[33:16] same because you're not going to share
[33:18] the glory with nobody I mean he's gonna
[33:20] have a mini member bride just like he
[33:22] did it he just types in every way all
[33:25] the way down and it's real consistent
[33:27] how that God is God to him you say God's
[33:31] got to yeah he he said he did he's gotta
[33:34] have her bride to reproduce yourself he
[33:36] said that cuz remember the light like
[33:39] real and go back to Genesis everything
[33:41] started in Genesis had to have a
[33:44] male/female relationship even with the
[33:47] animals to reproduce so you gotta have
[33:49] on they own you die off amen
[33:50] that's right that's just the way God
[33:53] said it so that's just the way he
[33:54] started it and you know what that's what
[33:55] he's gonna end it
[33:56] even with a bride but she's not gonna be
[33:59] a baby bride she's gonna be able at or
[34:01] full-grown bride that's it all right but
[34:03] she's got a golden girl so she's got the
[34:06] pouch he's had in his hair were white
[34:09] like wool let me ask you a question now
[34:12] there's going to be this this scenario
[34:14] is going to be all the way over in
[34:17] Revelations 21 oh my goodness is 10 20
[34:19] come on we got to go stop no
[34:22] we'll take this stuff
