[3:22] proverbs 18:10 says the name of the Lord
[3:28] is a strong tower the righteous run into
[3:33] it in our sight
[3:33] what about a haven a place and all that
[3:36] Satan can get to right you can't do
[3:40] nothing about it okay let's go to Exodus
[3:45] 3 you immediately know that this is
[3:48] Moses at the burning bush but I want to
[3:52] try back with out a little bit and try
[3:53] to move on with titles to his name and
[3:56] and speak a little bit about it sure it
[3:59] says annan Moses said unto God behold
[4:02] when I come unto the children of Israel
[4:04] and shall say unto them the god of your
[4:07] father's has sent me unto you and they
[4:11] shall say to me what is his name what
[4:15] shall I say unto them and God said unto
[4:20] Moses I am that I am and he said thus
[4:25] shalt thou say unto the children of
[4:27] Israel I am hath sent me unto you and
[4:33] God said moreover to Moses I shot this
[4:36] shalt thou say unto the children of
[4:38] Israel the Lord God of your father's the
[4:41] God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God
[4:43] of Jacob has sent me unto you this is my
[4:47] name forever and this is my memorial
[4:50] unto all generations you may be seated
[4:53] the Lord that is blessing to the reading
[4:56] of the word now we tried Sunday bringing
[5:01] out and speaking and we've been talking
[5:06] about the name of God the season we were
[5:10] well familiar so we don't have to spend
[5:13] all of the time explaining well God's
[5:15] not a
[5:16] you know and it's an object of worship
[5:18] but we do that just for others to try to
[5:21] help but I want to try if we can to not
[5:25] to bring this thought and idea and bring
[5:28] it up to Christ and his birth and then
[5:32] maybe we will continue a little more on
[5:33] that Sunday but now remember what we
[5:38] went through they asked brother Branham
[5:42] in questions and answers it has the name
[5:45] of God changed in the different
[5:47] dispensation and he says yes that it has
[5:52] changed
[5:53] he said because now let's just read that
[5:56] mikoshi
[5:56] you know to make sure we follow it they
[6:00] can go ahead and put it up on the screen
[6:01] says has the name of the Lord changed in
[6:04] the different dispensation yes yes it
[6:08] was once called he was called the I am
[6:11] no us he didn't say name is that he was
[6:13] called the I am he's called Jehovah he's
[6:17] changed many times the last time it was
[6:19] changed was when he when God became
[6:22] flesh and took a human name see Jehovah
[6:26] I am all of those are titles to a name
[6:30] alright he says his human name is the
[6:33] Lord Jesus Christ right now trying to
[6:37] make the point to back up just a little
[6:39] bit to where we can follow the thought
[6:42] that trying to find a name of God then
[6:49] we say well that's Jesus alright we know
[6:52] that but is that by revelation or is it
[6:59] just a name or a thought you know well
[7:04] we know it's not well then the Bible
[7:06] says ask anything in my name it will be
[7:09] given unto you why is it that sometimes
[7:12] you ask and get and sometimes you asking
[7:16] don't get is that right why don't you
[7:21] say well the Lord is just trying to
[7:23] introduce that you can pop up you know
[7:25] prop up any point
[7:27] but I don't think that's the thing that
[7:29] we need to be concerned with trying to
[7:31] prop up something we need to be serious
[7:33] minded and think about things all right
[7:36] and see then I'll get to it more Sunday
[7:41] but see we talked about that the name of
[7:43] Jesus was lost in the ages well what did
[7:47] they call him did they call him Joe Jim
[7:52] Charlie what did they call him he said
[7:56] when that's done brother Dale they
[7:58] called him Jesus well how could the name
[8:00] be lost and the Prophet said the name
[8:05] was lost in the ages right so then what
[8:11] was he called what does it mean to lose
[8:15] a name to our human thinking it means
[8:21] that they couldn't pronounce you know
[8:23] just stating that for a fact
[8:25] it would mean they couldn't pronounce
[8:27] his name down through that but that's
[8:31] not what it is cuz they called him Jesus
[8:34] it doesn't matter today all the way
[8:37] around the world they're calling him
[8:38] Jesus right see then what is it
[8:45] or why is it so hard for us to think
[8:49] about the name of God and what it is
[8:56] well see then we thought well what do
[8:58] you mean you know cuz that's when people
[9:00] say it all right now I'm giving this as
[9:02] an illustration see people will say what
[9:04] do you mean his name is God you know
[9:08] that's his name well that's not his name
[9:14] God means object of worship that's a
[9:17] title to a night all right we see we
[9:21] come over on the other side of it now
[9:23] and we say but but we know now what his
[9:27] name is what do you mean you know now
[9:28] what his name is
[9:29] I called him Jesus in the Baptist Church
[9:35] what you call him or you come from
[9:42] are you listening but you say well what
[9:49] do you mean his name is Jesus brother
[9:51] Dale we know that's true but we know the
[10:00] whole world causing Jesus is there a
[10:05] different way that we pronounce the word
[10:07] Jesus than others pronouncing it you
[10:09] know it's a different way of us spelling
[10:13] it maybe or a thought you know what is
[10:16] it that was what I was trying to get at
[10:21] Sunday though to where we could pick up
[10:23] something and think about it that word
[10:28] God in Genesis 1 32 33 times I it uses
[10:35] the word God and that is translated from
[10:38] the word Elohim because that was the
[10:45] best I could do with it okay
[10:48] now may I ask you to think a little bit
[10:53] if they could derive in Genesis to call
[11:00] him Elohim what was the problem
[11:06] over at the burning bush that they could
[11:10] not pronounce his name
[11:20] I mean if that could derive you
[11:22] understand that could derive and come up
[11:24] without him and say that Elohim means
[11:28] and I gave them to you if you want them
[11:30] it right here in front of me where he's
[11:32] a self existing one the mighty God
[11:34] unveil all right it means self existing
[11:39] yeah now they could bring that up and
[11:47] they could maybe in some other words use
[11:51] it and bring it up but why was it that
[11:56] when it comes to the name of God in
[11:58] other references that they couldn't
[12:00] pronounce it sure okay we understand
[12:06] there was a different way of spelling so
[12:12] when the scholars begin to write from
[12:15] Genesis one they could conclude all of
[12:19] them to doing and dealing with Elohim
[12:22] the self existing one because that would
[12:25] be the first title that you could
[12:28] conceive of Almighty God one who exists
[12:32] alone right but how come they couldn't
[12:36] do it when it comes to jvh you
[12:49] ciello him meaning the self-existing one
[12:53] the one who exists alone then when he
[13:01] comes up to Genesis 2 we see that it
[13:04] says God in Genesis then they'll come
[13:07] out in Genesis 2 and it'll say Lord God
[13:11] missing your Bible and they derived out
[13:17] of that the best understanding they can
[13:19] do as to say that it's Jehovah Elohim
[13:23] Elohim being self-existing Jehovah
[13:35] deriving from the words or thoughts that
[13:38] it would come up that he was like a
[13:39] father with his family so then we see
[13:47] that putting the two together he's the
[13:51] self existing God that now exists with
[13:57] his family
[14:00] because just drive to Java
[14:09] he's in throughout the Old Testament
[14:12] they use the form of Jehovah remember I
[14:23] gave them to you Sunday is it means what
[14:30] see when he came down to make an amateur
[14:33] God out of mankind and come to dwell
[14:38] with God in Genesis 2 I'm looking at the
[14:41] message called adoption so he isn't self
[14:44] existing anymore he exists with his
[14:54] family he's not self existing anymore
[15:00] see he'll never go back to being the
[15:03] self existing one but the self existing
[15:08] one will always be here
[15:19] because I can listen to your message
[15:21] like I said Brett erratum sitting and
[15:23] learning in John 1:1 where it says in
[15:28] the beginning was the word word with God
[15:30] he said we can say that in the beginning
[15:32] with Elohim Elohim was without him and
[15:34] elle' him without him and Elohim
[15:36] wouldn't make flesh and dwelt among us
[15:39] the self existing God could come down to
[15:43] dwell with mankind he doesn't use the
[15:48] title self existing anymore
[15:50] because he's not self existing he's
[15:53] existing with his creation and remember
[15:56] Sunday I brought out the animals and all
[15:58] like that that's not a part of it but
[16:00] when he created man he was no longer
[16:04] self existing he was Jehovah then from
[16:09] what they brought out he was Jehovah
[16:16] throughout the Old Testament we used
[16:19] Psalms 83 and 18 a little bit weird so
[16:23] much you're hopefully himself talking
[16:25] about but then we used Exodus 6 and 3
[16:30] but by my name Jehovah was I not known
[16:35] to them if that's what they call me why
[16:45] would he say that they call me Jehovah
[16:51] I said I'm not known unto them its
[16:56] Jehovah but they derived a part of
[17:03] Jehovah to where it would come out to be
[17:09] like a father with his family are you
[17:17] listening
[17:19] he said what are you trying to get to
[17:23] I'm trying to get to one thing they
[17:29] called him Jehovah and that was the best
[17:35] I could do he honored those children of
[17:41] Israel and was their God but he said by
[17:48] my name Jehovah I was never known to
[17:54] know is that Bible well I mean if it's
[17:59] Bible saying that one scriptures say
[18:03] they called me is your whole world I'm
[18:05] Jehovah to them and then he turned
[18:07] around and says but I was never known
[18:11] well he must have been something about
[18:14] the name Jehovah that they couldn't
[18:16] figure out so you know what that is
[18:18] it was Jay vhu and there was no way to
[18:21] pronounce it there was no way to be able
[18:31] to interpret what was being said you
[18:37] remember we gave them from the Prophet
[18:39] last week did we call it Jehovah but it
[18:45] isn't
[18:45] no one can interpret it why it's the
[18:50] eternal one it's the eternal one even
[19:02] the Hebrew scholars could never
[19:04] pronounce it that burning bush listen is
[19:10] Jehovah many points throughout the
[19:12] scripture then he's relating it to the
[19:15] burning bush and even the Hebrew
[19:17] scholars could never pronounce it that
[19:19] burning bush there that day when he met
[19:21] Moses and he said to Moses he said by
[19:29] what name
[19:31] you read up and down in your there were
[19:34] Moses and no he told him he was Almighty
[19:36] God and you'll find him saying I'm the
[19:39] God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he said
[19:43] but I'm not going until you tell me your
[19:46] name when he didn't say okay my name is
[19:53] I am that I am nobody say he said
[19:59] something the day interpreted down to
[20:04] mankind in the language what that was
[20:08] are you following me
[20:19] to remember one thing gonna be real slow
[20:23] I want you to think remember one thing
[20:30] that you can still today call him
[20:34] Jehovah but write them dear
[20:42] you can call him el ahem but random did
[20:47] you can call him I am right about him
[20:50] did but what's his name why was it they
[21:02] could never pronounce that name and to
[21:08] show you it's the same person he spoke
[21:12] to Moses is that I am that I am and when
[21:16] Jesus come forth later on in John he
[21:20] said before Abraham was I am the Prophet
[21:25] said it's the same God the Bible says in
[21:30] Acts I got it over here in a little bit
[21:33] talking about Jesus Christ the Angel of
[21:36] the covenant that he was the one that
[21:37] spoke to Moses from the burning bush or
[21:40] in other words in the wilderness at
[21:42] Mount Sania
[21:47] but you see we say we know what the name
[21:50] is but why
[22:01] what was our problem now I want you to
[22:07] think seriously we talk about attributes
[22:14] of God right we talked about in the
[22:16] beginning the God dwelt alone the self
[22:20] existing one etc the Prophet explaining
[22:22] it right he said he had attributes in
[22:25] him we know that he didn't gain no
[22:27] attributes as he came down he had all
[22:29] the attributes in him before the world
[22:31] ever begun he just displayed his
[22:33] attributes right but now here's a
[22:39] thought I want you to write down and
[22:41] take home with you no one coddle you
[22:49] know what I mean title I'm talking about
[22:53] Elohim Jehovah I am father son Holy
[22:57] Ghost Lily LaValley right Morningstar
[22:59] alpha the bigger you understand me no
[23:04] one title can contain the attributes of
[23:10] God or Michael manifest remember let's
[23:16] put it that way no one title can't do it
[23:26] it takes all of the titles coming
[23:29] together that's what I was trying to
[23:33] illustrate Sunday it took four thousand
[23:38] years all the profits all the preaching
[23:41] and all of the things before the name
[23:44] Jesus would come forward now hope you
[23:51] was listening remember brother Alan said
[23:56] they was plenty of Jesus's in the name
[23:58] of Jesus see we think that that was the
[24:01] only time that's how carnal our thoughts
[24:04] are that the name j esus was never said
[24:09] until it was said over here in John or
[24:13] Matthew or whatever what about today
[24:30] a lot of people are called Jesus right
[24:35] what does that make them Jesus that's
[24:38] their knife but now think on this dog
[24:43] what I was aiming to Sunday is too far
[24:46] into it not to back up the title of
[24:51] Elohim is self-existing right that
[24:57] doesn't contain all the attributes of
[24:58] God or maybe display em or whatever you
[25:01] want to go into it you know of saying it
[25:04] maybe my language or English the sense
[25:07] is not too good and I agree zart but
[25:10] just get the point
[25:12] jehovah that would mean like a father
[25:16] with his family all the attributes of
[25:21] God is not contained in Java or made
[25:26] manifest in Java and C they used Yehovah
[25:32] but then when it comes to the burning
[25:34] bush is really the account that you
[25:39] label it to work then Moses wanted to
[25:43] know his name now if they'd have been
[25:47] calling him Jehovah before then what was
[25:49] the matter with Moses why didn't he say
[25:55] Jehovah
[26:01] because he knew there was something else
[26:03] different run around and said it I
[26:07] didn't I quoted it to you a minute ago
[26:09] he said Moses couldn't even interpret it
[26:15] Moses couldn't tell you what that name
[26:18] was it's what he said about what name I
[26:26] know it I require for you to think and I
[26:30] wished it to heaven we could do that you
[26:33] understand what I'm getting at there was
[26:37] some word written some something written
[26:43] out that the scholars developed the
[26:47] point of Elohim and called himself
[26:52] existing that's a good thought but it's
[26:56] good place to start right then they
[27:01] called him Lord God Jehovah in Genesis
[27:05] because when he created man he was Java
[27:12] like a father with his family we come to
[27:19] Moses in Exodus and he says what's your
[27:25] name
[27:32] why didn't mother say a burning bush
[27:36] great experience something supernatural
[27:38] it's got to be we know it's something of
[27:40] God what didn't he say now Jehovah love
[27:46] him I want to talk to you
[27:54] he could have said that because that's
[27:58] who was talking to him right
[28:01] that was your hotel ahem
[28:04] because remember table one God but I got
[28:10] a scripture get down the life if I make
[28:11] it don't rain out Sunday you remember
[28:14] the scripture said even now but one
[28:17] night what are you following my salt now
[28:27] no one coddle so I am that I am is the
[28:34] closest to it because Elohim would be
[28:41] the self existing the self existing
[28:45] would create and he would display his
[28:49] attributes of create or he would be
[28:53] called and I returned in God you know
[28:59] angels retired they could worship Him
[29:02] what that with what he wanted but see
[29:08] you got to combine Jehovah and they love
[29:10] him to come out to the hav aah I think
[29:16] you'd wish for that but he simply means
[29:19] a father with his family so that's what
[29:24] your whole was developed
[29:26] put your over and I love him together
[29:28] and read your Bible that's all I've
[29:31] asked you you don't have to know all
[29:33] about all this stuff and I've had people
[29:35] tell me to brother Dale my Bible don't
[29:38] italicize them letters like yours what
[29:41] are you reading well if it don't
[29:43] italicize it was it safe
[29:49] in my Bible in Genesis 2 it says capital
[29:55] L o our D God what is your site no
[30:05] matter where it's capital or not are you
[30:08] with me it'll make no difference where
[30:10] it's capital or not that's just a point
[30:13] I try to illustrate it still said in
[30:16] Genesis 2 Lord God going through your
[30:23] Bible and read it and watch that follow
[30:25] that pattern all the way to Moses but it
[30:28] don't stop with Moses he keeps on
[30:30] passing 9 only use the italicize are at
[30:39] what you call it on the letter to
[30:41] emphasize because if you read it and
[30:45] think the Bible said the Lord said unto
[30:48] my lord check that one of them's a
[30:52] capital L and the other one's a
[30:54] lowercase they knew it meant something
[30:59] but if it don't capitalize it come on
[31:03] kids read it it still says Lord God
[31:12] Jehovah ever him the self-existing one
[31:18] has now created something to exist with
[31:21] him like him which was man then when he
[31:30] comes to Moses at the burning bush what
[31:34] did Moses call him Lord God
[31:43] you'd already told him I am to Almighty
[31:45] God he said I am that I am so there's no
[31:54] way then that could be pronounced or
[31:56] understood because that would were you
[31:58] would derive it back to the jv8 you let
[32:04] a random user j v HP one time and said
[32:07] sorry in other words he involved is j vh
[32:10] you now listen think on this a minute
[32:22] you follow my point for using elohim you
[32:27] cannot cover all the attributes thereby
[32:30] with meal now you know you understand
[32:32] what i'm saying you can't cover all the
[32:35] attributes put it up to jehovah you
[32:39] can't cover all the attributes because
[32:48] it's not a name it's a title to a name
[32:55] are you willing but then you see why
[33:01] when we ended up sunday we ended up
[33:07] sunday making a statement by putting all
[33:12] the attributes together all the titles
[33:14] together you come up with a name Jesus
[33:18] Jesus can display all the attributes oh
[33:25] you didn't know what's going on away
[33:27] dizzy Jesus can display all the
[33:31] attributes the name Jesus has within
[33:37] itself all of those attributes
[33:45] he's your whole genre Jehovah ref eyes
[33:47] you over kissing you he's the morning
[33:49] star to rotten he's they all and all
[33:51] he's the Alpha and Omega he's everything
[33:54] in that one night because Jesus is not a
[33:58] title and like I've always said to you
[34:08] when it says over an Isaiah that you'll
[34:10] have a son as you call his name Emmanuel
[34:16] what didn't they call him Emmanuel when
[34:19] he came let me say what your prophet
[34:28] said they called him Emmanuel you'll
[34:34] read out
[34:34] that's what Jesus name is Emmanuel they
[34:42] called him God are you with one name can
[34:54] contain ever attribute but one attribute
[34:57] cannot contain ever attribute so you had
[35:04] to keep coming down Elohim self existed
[35:09] Jehovah father with his family I am that
[35:14] I am which means ever-present for
[35:16] eternity and Jesus saying let me restate
[35:23] that Scripture and I hope you don't call
[35:26] me a scripture changer but when I say
[35:30] before Moses was I am couldn't he say
[35:33] the same time couldn't he say before
[35:37] Abraham was I am
[35:38] couldn't he say before Moses was I am
[35:40] couldn't he say before Joseph was I am
[35:42] couldn't he say before Elohim what I am
[35:46] because the I am brings it to present
[35:49] tense
[35:59] yeah so we ended it up by saying jvh you
[36:07] could never be pronounced because it had
[36:13] no vowels or what it is in the English
[36:15] part to be able to pronounce it so they
[36:20] added things to it and they come up with
[36:22] you over the best they could do because
[36:24] you hold them in exactly what he had
[36:26] done
[36:26] the self-existing one that they derived
[36:30] Ella him from as meaning self-existing
[36:34] that's what the name means self-existing
[36:36] and they took that and then when they
[36:38] said okay he ignorant he does not now
[36:41] exist anymore alone he's got his family
[36:45] he's created man he's no longer self
[36:49] existing and never will he ever be
[36:51] except existing again but now he's like
[36:57] a manor or a man with his family this is
[37:02] well that's the best closest we can get
[37:04] to it so we'll call him Jehovah but what
[37:14] about it why didn't they call him
[37:18] Jehovah why did the angel of the Lord
[37:21] not say to Mary Matthew 1:21 I guess it
[37:27] it she shall call this she shall bring
[37:31] forth the sons I shall call his name
[37:32] Jesus
[37:34] I didn't just stop there are you winning
[37:43] pull that one up brothers were three
[37:45] thirteen hey I guess it is or thirteen
[37:51] it didn't stop calling him Jesus look
[37:56] what it says she shall bring forth a son
[38:00] now you know what it is Isaiah said
[38:03] you'll call his name Emmanuel
[38:08] but when Gabriel spoke to Mary he didn't
[38:11] call it Emmanuel he called him Jesus why
[38:15] why didn't he say manua Emmanuel means
[38:20] God with us which that's the point it
[38:22] means God with us come on are you
[38:29] listening it means God with us that's
[38:33] exactly what it means that's what it is
[38:34] is God with us throughout Jesus God with
[38:37] us but what's his name
[38:40] Oh his name's Jesus okay look I shall
[38:50] call his name Jesus and what you ever
[38:53] title fall with that name come on
[38:59] laid it down to now ever title falls to
[39:03] the name of Jesus Jesus can fulfill ever
[39:05] title the title came fulfill the name
[39:09] God His only depart for the time he was
[39:14] ever him for that time he was your home
[39:16] for that time he was I have for that
[39:19] time little I shall call his name Jesus
[39:28] for he shall save his people from their
[39:33] sins now he's the savior and this was
[39:42] done and once not to just name in Jesus
[39:48] come on art read your Bible sometime and
[39:51] look at the words you know they don't
[39:54] change because I read them you know what
[39:58] I mean you're supposed to read like me I
[40:00] mean we were taught in school 1 1 2 2
[40:04] we've taught we spoke to know all about
[40:06] them things a is a and B is being and I
[40:13] went to banks County so I guess it kicks
[40:15] off a lot of it I made it two weeks in
[40:18] high school
[40:20] Kassie I quit that worked for a few
[40:23] years done away with all the recesses
[40:25] and went and finished my high school
[40:27] education in two days you see kids you
[40:31] got all them recesses where the problems
[40:33] that okay take that where you'll forget
[40:38] it now are you back with me come on now
[40:41] she's he'll bring forth the Sun that's
[40:45] how called his name Jesus for he shall
[40:51] save his people from their sins
[40:54] machi now this was done to call him
[40:58] Jesus was done that it might be
[41:00] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[41:03] by the Prophet said behold a virgin
[41:04] shall be with child and she'll bring
[41:07] forth a son as I shall call his name
[41:09] Emmanuel which is being interpreted on
[41:13] it God with us but a random I got it in
[41:18] here if you want said when they called
[41:19] him Emmanuel I called him Jesus Jesus
[41:26] was before the flesh come into being as
[41:32] a baby are you following me
[41:37] Jesus was what Gabriel said to Mary but
[41:43] that's what he said
[41:44] to fulfil the scriptures that said call
[41:48] him Emmanuel but that only means God
[41:54] with us
[41:57] that ain't all is it because his name
[42:03] Emmanuel would be no more than Elohim or
[42:06] self-existing he said but his name is
[42:10] Jesus you know what the Prophet is said
[42:13] about it so you read it you don't read
[42:15] it then heaven help you you know what he
[42:17] said the first time the name Jesus was
[42:21] ever spoke with by an angel now are you
[42:25] with me or what I said while ago come on
[42:29] you at least didn't get up run out when
[42:31] I said that the name of Jesus was used
[42:34] prophet said there was many Jesuses in
[42:36] the days of Jesus without the first time
[42:42] the 9 j esus
[42:44] was said when the Gabriel said it Oh
[42:48] but is the only one that could save us
[42:51] from our sins there was nobody else
[42:54] there salvation and none of the name in
[42:58] the name of Jesus Christ not Jesus the
[43:01] flesh and you know they the carpenter
[43:04] the Jesus the bricklayer and Jesus -
[43:07] whatever Jesus the Christ
[43:18] the first time the name Jesus then will
[43:20] say we spoke was by an angel told Mary
[43:27] you know the story right Mary leaves
[43:31] called her cousin Elizabeth had
[43:35] conceived about six months before then
[43:38] and I'm quoting off of brother Branham
[43:41] if it runs three or four you do what you
[43:42] want to I just read what he said okay
[43:45] it's in about six months you know what
[43:50] happened
[43:52] John's daddy wouldn't call his name
[43:56] couldn't get it straight he called him
[43:57] John he said okay if you can't believe
[43:59] this and you can't get it straight of
[44:01] what I'm telling you he said you're just
[44:03] gonna be dumb until he comes why did you
[44:09] do that with him because he wouldn't get
[44:15] him the truth he wouldn't believe in it
[44:17] the way it's supposed to be believed so
[44:19] he said you listened to show you you're
[44:21] going to be dumb you know you can't
[44:23] speak until the baby is born when the
[44:28] baby was born they brought her trying to
[44:29] bring writing what he did currents all
[44:31] over his name's John took a supernatural
[44:36] thing to release a man's lives where he
[44:38] could call him John how much more
[44:40] supernatural to call Jesus Jesus may I
[44:45] quote brother Branham now quote the
[44:48] Bible when Mary goes to Elizabeth and it
[44:54] says she makes her salutation you know
[44:58] what it's saying now come on turn in
[45:01] your Bible right there if you want to -
[45:03] and I'll show you what I'm talking about
[45:04] it doesn't use the name Jesus somebody
[45:12] gets your scripture ready
[45:17] there's no record written down that Mary
[45:21] went and come in and said his name is
[45:25] Jesus no she made a salutation my point
[45:34] is we safe it ain't in the letter I
[45:37] don't believe it it ain't in the letters
[45:39] are of it the name Jesus was Pope but we
[45:42] know it was because we not a prophet
[45:45] that said it was so the Prophet said her
[45:48] salutation in other words Mary's
[45:50] announcement was Elizabeth I'm pregnant
[45:54] oh you oh you and Joseph no not Joseph
[46:03] what do you mean Mary who's the daddy
[46:08] her salutation says the Holy Spirit
[46:11] overshadowed me and Gabriel told me to
[46:16] call him Jesus right it's just not
[46:21] written out there in plain language all
[46:25] right it's as quick as that name Jesus
[46:31] was pronounced a baby that had moved
[46:33] come to life run I don't try to be mean
[46:42] and arrogant I just try to bring things
[46:43] out as her truth and let you look at it
[46:47] we talked about John receiving the Holy
[46:50] Ghost before he left his mother's womb
[46:52] why don't you read that scripture right
[46:54] there somebody read it and you'll see
[46:56] that when Elizabeth heard that she was
[46:59] filled with a holy God we don't talk
[47:02] about her
[47:03] Luke 141 she was filled with the Holy
[47:07] Ghost
[47:09] what are you doing brother branham
[47:11] you're emphasizing this man got it
[47:14] different from Mary Mary I mean
[47:17] Elizabeth Elizabeth got an anointing to
[47:20] come over her this man got life in the
[47:22] womb come on study the message it's a
[47:26] beautiful wonderful picture
[47:28] but it has a lot of loopholes in it if
[47:31] you don't how the holy ghost to fill it
[47:33] up with sorry for using that kind of
[47:37] language but it's all I got got what you
[47:45] see the next time his name is mentioned
[47:50] as being said was over with I believe
[47:53] with Simeon and coming forward and when
[47:58] it comes forward and he tells what he
[48:00] does and you know what they don't in
[48:01] those Bible times they didn't name the
[48:03] baby until his eighth day go am i right
[48:08] they circumcised on the eighth day gave
[48:11] it a night so they gave it to named
[48:14] Jesus on the eighth day for human
[48:17] records with mankind I'll quote these
[48:24] we'll get back to him later your prophet
[48:27] said look at our he said little Jehovah
[48:33] well he didn't say now little Jesus
[48:36] laying in the cradle
[48:37] what did he say come on Radim acid
[48:39] listen to the message he said Lord y'all
[48:41] were crying in a cradle he said little
[48:43] Jehovah playing as a boy he said Little
[48:46] Joe home and you got to put two together
[48:48] to get this but he said little little
[48:50] Jehovah with no teeth they don't run the
[48:52] computer try to find no teeth in Jesus
[48:54] you've got to get two or three times
[48:56] together I got it you are short three he
[48:58] said with a little Jehovah or no key
[49:00] then why did he say little Jesus with no
[49:02] teeth okay well Jehovah
[49:05] I got another message by - down the road
[49:10] come on whatever others say I hate to
[49:13] say this at the time cuz it opened up a
[49:14] lot what this ain't you hold the old
[49:16] Jesus within you or else we don't know
[49:20] how the Godhead correct so you better
[49:22] understand the name of Jesus they named
[49:27] him Jesus because it meant ever title
[49:32] that could ever be broke throughout the
[49:36] whole Old Testament so with John Reggio
[49:40] at this canoed all of those
[49:42] Lily the valley the Rose of Sharon
[49:44] rotten Morningstar the Alpha to me all
[49:46] the titles coming in to Father Son and
[49:49] Holy Ghost coming into all names his
[49:54] name is Jesus name is Jesus they didn't
[50:04] get this one so I'll go ahead and read
[50:05] it you don't have to hunt for it
[50:08] Dolf of a message called God's chosen
[50:10] place of worship I kept throwing this
[50:13] one back throwing this and back and kept
[50:15] falling up throwing it back okay I'll
[50:17] read it I done read it but I meant to
[50:23] you listen what he said on God's
[50:25] children place of worship 1965 and then
[50:28] we find that Jesus said also I came in
[50:32] my father's name and you received me not
[50:35] then the name of the father must be
[50:37] Jesus that's right the name of the
[50:44] Father is Jesus because Jesus said so
[50:47] I'm reading over here be glad to get
[50:50] this for you if you want it I carry my
[50:53] father's 19 I come in my father's name
[50:56] and you receive me not then his name was
[50:59] Jesus and Gabriel called him Jesus when
[51:03] they got the AirCam they beat me to it
[51:04] and Gabriel called him Jesus look the
[51:08] prophets called him Jesus come on where
[51:16] the prophets ever say Jesus come on
[51:24] Ritchie prophets message by revelation
[51:26] sometimes every time one of them prophet
[51:33] said Jehovah they was calling Jesus
[51:35] every time they called him any name you
[51:38] want to put dar Jehovah Jireh Arella him
[51:40] or whatever all them prophets was
[51:43] calling him Jesus and when they called
[51:46] him Emmanuel Isaiah it was calling in
[51:49] Jesus read it
[51:54] and Gabriel called him Jesus the
[51:57] prophets called him Jesus
[51:59] it was absolutely Jesus before his birth
[52:02] even the holy prophet called his name
[52:05] Emmanuel which is God with us then God
[52:10] was manifested in the flesh in order to
[52:14] take away the sin of the world and doing
[52:16] so he was given the name of Jesus so
[52:21] Jesus is the knight and the name was
[52:26] placed in a man not a church not a
[52:28] denomination I decreed but a man he
[52:31] chose to place his name in Jesus Christ
[52:33] and we find out dire then that then he
[52:37] becomes excuted to place it he becomes
[52:41] to the place of God's worship where you
[52:43] can worship Him
[52:44] even before he was ever born his name
[52:48] was called Jesus do you see that I mean
[52:56] does everybody understand that statement
[52:57] he's making that when they called him
[53:00] Joe whole way they would call him Jesus
[53:02] because that was his name Joe was not a
[53:05] knight when they call him Jehovah Jireh
[53:08] Jehovah this kid
[53:09] there's Rose of Sharon Lily invited any
[53:12] titles anything in the Old Testament
[53:14] when those prophets called his name
[53:16] that's called him Jesus we wrote down
[53:21] their usual carnal code it doesn't say
[53:24] let's not I said Sunday I said that's
[53:26] where God hides it and simplicity
[53:27] what offender said what have you picked
[53:30] up your Bible what if you didn't know
[53:32] anything and you went you picked up a
[53:33] Bible but yet you'd heard stories about
[53:36] Jesus and you read in Genesis 1 and it
[53:39] said in the beginning Jesus created
[53:42] heaven in there
[53:44] Genesis 2 Jesus created these three
[53:47] adidas create they've been a mystery
[53:52] there'd be no mystery
[53:57] if I was in profits back there every
[53:59] time they started to say his name and
[54:03] they said Jesus it'd be no mystery
[54:08] the name was so honored and revered they
[54:11] say the story was that Lazarus was
[54:17] ascribed writing that and every time
[54:20] they would come to that name of God they
[54:24] would stop and lay their pin down and go
[54:27] take a full bath and come back they so
[54:31] reverence that night they said the
[54:34] reason that he died he died probably a
[54:37] pneumonia can take it too many bites
[54:39] right in the scroll it's not a plaything
[54:43] to them were you following me his name
[54:51] was called Jesus it was so important it
[54:58] was give to the mother by the angel
[55:01] Gabriel that his name would be called
[55:04] Jesus son of God but he was but when
[55:11] they called him Emmanuel they called him
[55:13] Jesus it just couldn't be pronounced why
[55:18] because it would been j vh v bi j vh you
[55:21] speak and they couldn't pronounce it the
[55:28] angel gabriel you think he goofed up you
[55:31] mean he brought god's name from glory
[55:35] right was he to deliver the message am i
[55:41] right was Gabriel to deliver the message
[55:44] from glory he brought the name of who
[55:55] he brought the name of the Father that's
[56:02] why Jesus said I come in my father's
[56:03] nothing
[56:04] he brought to the name of the Father he
[56:07] brought the name of Almighty God
[56:08] he brought the name of Jehovah he
[56:10] brought all of those titles and forms
[56:12] and he brought it down to a name Jesus
[56:20] David aren't you afraid you'll go into a
[56:23] oneness with it not afraid because it I
[56:25] just covered stuff that the one this
[56:27] won't cover when this won't cover that
[56:30] he had many many attributes that he had
[56:33] many manifestations they say the night
[56:35] that Jesus is the only form of God and I
[56:39] differ with them 100% cause the bride of
[56:42] Jesus Christ is the life form of God to
[56:45] the Gentile dispensation then he goes to
[56:47] Israel and in a more fee then they
[56:51] become what he's brought that ain't one
[56:56] this I wish you would
[57:02] sitting here today running it and
[57:04] looking I wish you would go back and
[57:09] read the church age book and to read
[57:15] each age and the message to each age now
[57:19] sign your topic go reading sure change
[57:24] and see how it'll come up and it'll say

[57:45] don't know how far I'm going but I'm
[57:48] going to stay with what I can you're
[57:50] talking about a new name of Jesus you
[57:53] better go find out the first time I
[57:55] spoke up is in the 68 and but around and
[57:58] says that is the message to that age
[58:03] there is no new name of Jesus spoken of
[58:06] in the seventh church age
[58:09] you don't believe in a new name of Jesus
[58:11] I might believe it a whole lot more than
[58:19] you think
[58:24] cuz remember that name in Chuck in Rev
[58:28] let the six Church age
[58:30] he's also related to your night and run

[58:35] you now you just done away with my
[58:39] thoughts of the new name brother do you
[58:41] know I have it let me change the time I
[58:44] just like to read both sides of the
[58:46] story where you can decide yourself this
[58:51] ain't new in 40 some years I've been
[58:53] teasing is this way so it's not a new
[58:55] thing to come up with some kind of show
[58:57] and you surely know for certain I ain't
[58:59] never come out here and start to try to
[59:00] tell you somebody something about a new
[59:02] night because according to my Bible if

[59:29] about it let's going over hurry up all
[59:31] right get over to 15 just start reading
[59:35] some off the message adoption priest in
[59:39] 1960 look what brother Branham says and
[59:43] Father Son the Holy Ghost is not no name
[59:45] of God God has one name and his name is
[59:50] Jesus the Bible says the family in
[59:58] heaven his name Jesus so he came from a
[1:00:00] birth the family and earth is named
[1:00:02] Jesus it was brought down here though
[1:00:08] God had one name human night and he was
[1:00:13] had a name called Jehovah Jireh
[1:00:15] chauvelin that was a title to his deity
[1:00:18] but he had one name Jesus
[1:00:21] one night this is all I've ever said
[1:00:26] about the new name of Jesus the new name
[1:00:29] you're looking for until we exalt I'm in
[1:00:34] exhaust the name of Jesus
[1:00:37] don't worry about a new night until
[1:00:40] we're finished with what is here don't
[1:00:42] worry about a new night and my Bible
[1:00:44] says that Jesus will be called by the
[1:00:47] Jews after we get out of here
[1:00:49] Jesus but this don't think you could get
[1:00:55] it all figured out because you're
[1:01:01] thinking I'm just trying to make
[1:01:02] something I'm trying to state what a
[1:01:04] prophet had to say until the name of
[1:01:11] Jesus is fully understood I'll make it
[1:01:16] this way until you can understand that
[1:01:19] all the attributes of Jehovah God are in
[1:01:24] Jesus Christ then you can start talking
[1:01:30] about a new night I know what he said is
[1:01:35] he'll go first field talking about his
[1:01:39] night cut is one of them instead to be
[1:01:42] made known in the thunders know that I
[1:01:47] can quote you all the things about it
[1:01:49] I've had them written down for 40 years
[1:01:50] but I've never come up with something
[1:01:53] trying to tell you some kind of a new
[1:01:54] night because see Jesus has not done
[1:01:59] away with commit yet until we come to
[1:02:03] the places you can leave what you want
[1:02:05] to until we come to the basis that we
[1:02:07] can ask in Jesus name and see it done
[1:02:11] don't worry about a new night
[1:02:21] that's not a lot of ever talk look what
[1:02:24] he says go ahead
[1:02:25] the Philadelphian Church age number 16
[1:02:28] what's the name of God Jesus they are in
[1:02:33] a pillar in the devil my god and I'll
[1:02:35] write upon him the name of my god you
[1:02:37] know the name of the city of my god and
[1:02:39] I and then that finishes up by saying
[1:02:41] than not my new name and what is he
[1:02:43] turning to say and what's the name with
[1:02:44] God Jesus you want to jot it down we've
[1:02:47] got a little late here Jesus
[1:02:50] viens said in heaven and earth all his
[1:02:53] name Jesus now anybody I already don't
[1:02:59] have a Bible don't want to look at it
[1:03:00] the whole hell it doesn't say in the
[1:03:02] name of Jesus and Ephesians it just
[1:03:05] tells you to all in heaven and earth is
[1:03:07] named that night I try to cut off the
[1:03:11] smart alecks before they get too smart
[1:03:14] okay because it says actually what it's
[1:03:18] there for
[1:03:18] it's called by my knee under the father
[1:03:20] of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the
[1:03:24] whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:03:26] named from the Lord Jesus Christ going
[1:03:30] to the next one Philadelphia Church age

[1:03:37] god and the name of the city of my god
[1:03:39] and what is the name of God well he was
[1:03:43] God with us Emmanuel but that was not
[1:03:46] his given 9dr call his name jesus jesus
[1:03:49] said I came to my father's name and you
[1:03:51] received me not therefore the name of
[1:03:53] God is Jesus for that is the name he
[1:03:56] came in he is Lord Jesus Christ that's
[1:04:01] the name he came in okay keep going with
[1:04:08] 18
[1:04:13] I just provided place of worship 65
[1:04:19] his name was God and God has many titles
[1:04:22] God is a toggle itself we call Jehovah
[1:04:26] Jireh Jehovah Jehovah Kanishka new man
[1:04:29] instance and he was called the Rose of
[1:04:31] Sharon lily of the valley bright morning
[1:04:32] star Alpha Omega beginning in and Father
[1:04:35] Son and Holy Ghost and all these but his
[1:04:37] name God's name is Jesus Christ The
[1:04:41] Anointed One Jesus The Anointed One that
[1:04:46] is his name he had many titles for one
[1:04:48] name the only not another name under
[1:04:51] heaven given whereby among men whereby
[1:04:54] you must be saved
[1:04:56] so if God's name is not Jesus where's
[1:05:03] your salvation go into the next what's
[1:05:06] this one taken from the adoption in 1960
[1:05:11] the whole family is named Jesus the
[1:05:15] whole church is named to you everything
[1:05:17] is named Jesus for it's the only name
[1:05:20] that God ever had
[1:05:26] that's plain enough he's called you hold
[1:05:29] a job I do it Lord provided he's called
[1:05:31] many a thing but he had one name go
[1:05:37] ahead to the next one
[1:05:39] God you're only provided place of
[1:05:41] worship 1965 the place where I chose to
[1:05:45] choose to put my name now there's not
[1:05:48] another place in the Bible given where
[1:05:51] that God ever put his name only in Jesus
[1:05:55] Christ for he is the son of God taking
[1:06:00] the name of God and God's human name
[1:06:04] there's not another name given under
[1:06:07] heaven whereby me must be safe it was a
[1:06:10] next one
[1:06:15] well excuse me 24:21 okay yeah okay God
[1:06:26] told Moses he said now I'm going to send
[1:06:28] my angel before you to keep you into
[1:06:30] play anyone knows that the angel was
[1:06:33] Jesus Christ but around says and
[1:06:39] watching
[1:06:40] if you can't see Christ in ever verse or
[1:06:43] the Bible go back and read it again now
[1:06:46] he never said if you can't see Jesus go
[1:06:48] see that brings it over to a fleshly
[1:06:51] pond but he said if you can't see cry
[1:06:53] who was the one that told Moses a better
[1:06:55] way of doing that but around said I was
[1:06:57] confused on that until he showed me it
[1:06:59] was Christ the very angel of the
[1:07:03] Covenant that was in the burning bush
[1:07:05] Christ that led the children of Israel
[1:07:09] the same Java Christ which was the
[1:07:12] pillar of fire
[1:07:12] it was Christ his name wasn't Jesus yet
[1:07:15] on him until he was manifested in flesh
[1:07:19] but the whole thing I want to now stop
[1:07:27] the reason they didn't say in the
[1:07:30] beginning Jesus created the world in the
[1:07:34] beginning was the incident beginning
[1:07:35] with that you remember it would give
[1:07:38] away the secret and remember watch him
[1:07:42] anyone knows that the angel was Jesus
[1:07:45] Christ which was the pillar of fire
[1:07:48] pillar of fire and watch him it wasn't
[1:07:52] Christ his name wasn't Jesus yet why
[1:07:56] because all the attributes had not been
[1:07:58] fulfilled he could be a lot of things
[1:08:04] but he was never a savior back her he
[1:08:09] could be the angel that led the children
[1:08:10] it was really good ball rolling son but
[1:08:12] he wouldn't a savior but God come on now
[1:08:16] there was salvation back tyre don't
[1:08:17] misunderstand he wouldn't die as a
[1:08:23] savior and if he wouldn't there as a
[1:08:24] savior and we just read closer you'll
[1:08:26] save his people from their sins his name
[1:08:28] Jesus
[1:08:30] his name wasn't Jesus that time why he
[1:08:36] was the one that was in the wilderness
[1:08:37] let me give you this last one Zachariah
[1:08:40] 14 and 9 and the Lord shall be a king
[1:08:43] over all there in that day shall there
[1:08:46] be one Lord and his name one what about
[1:08:54] it
[1:08:56] what do you think about the name of God
[1:08:58] was a brother I just don't understand
[1:09:00] because the name of God is God what is
[1:09:03] all the things about it is God that's
[1:09:05] what it is well maybe that's the reason
[1:09:15] we don't get what we're asking for
[1:09:18] because maybe we're still trying to
[1:09:20] approach him as God instead of
[1:09:24] approaching him from his name because
[1:09:26] remember he kept telling us to ask
[1:09:29] anything white and he said ask the
[1:09:34] father anything and why Jesus emphasized
[1:09:40] a lot in the Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:09:41] I come in my father's name the only name
[1:09:49] that God ever had is Jesus
[1:09:57] but it took four thousand years to get a
[1:09:59] revelation to people nothing they could
[1:10:01] understand you right it could be called
[1:10:06] Jesus if you could pronounce his name
[1:10:08] and remember it what no scholar that
[1:10:12] pronounce his name it was the angel of
[1:10:14] the Lord
[1:10:16] you remember Gabriel you remember the
[1:10:19] seller that brought the first coming in
[1:10:21] that way and you know that Gabriel is to
[1:10:24] announce the second coming okay
[1:10:27] I go way back a couple of messages but
[1:10:30] it's alright and go back to Zerubbabel
[1:10:33] and find out who he was and we might
[1:10:35] find out what happened in this day as
[1:10:42] you see we didn't know that name
[1:10:45] brother Branham said the name of Jesus
[1:10:48] was lost in the ages as I said well ago
[1:10:50] what did he call him what was lost of
[1:10:55] him
[1:10:56] I got it Sunday to come through the
[1:10:58] revelation of who he is not was our will
[1:11:05] be with who he is and it says in the
[1:11:14] field church age it you got a name that
[1:11:16] you're living with you're dead but
[1:11:17] around said day lost his name six church
[1:11:20] age and comes back and talk to about his
[1:11:23] name the Prophet said between the 6th
[1:11:27] and 7th church age the name of Jesus
[1:11:29] began to be restored that's where you
[1:11:32] wound up with your oneness people and
[1:11:38] Jesus only people because life was
[1:11:45] coming forth
[1:11:47] here come the Prophet he said now Jesus
[1:11:52] he said there's many Jesuses but once he
[1:11:55] but he said there's only one Lord Jesus
[1:11:58] Christ there's only one man in the world
[1:12:08] that was named Jesus that's crazy cause
[1:12:15] you just got to explain it if they would
[1:12:17] lot of people like our College Jesus
[1:12:18] that's what I'm just saying but it don't
[1:12:20] refer to none of them maths at this way
[1:12:26] but a run said your name may work out to
[1:12:28] be 666 remember that one when he said
[1:12:32] you're not setting on seven hills so
[1:12:34] don't worry about right you can call him
[1:12:39] Jesus Jesus and be worshipping the devil
[1:12:46] yeah but God knows who I'm talking about
[1:12:48] that's what you you just you tear me up
[1:12:51] cuz you just make it so hard to lock in
[1:12:54] something guts no it's got to be
[1:12:55] revealed
[1:13:00] come on another scripture how would this
[1:13:03] man healed of this important disease we
[1:13:09] don't know a few weeks ago said it was
[1:13:12] the name now that in all the scripture
[1:13:15] what to say that it was in the name and
[1:13:20] faith in the name is what makes this man
[1:13:24] stand before you hold this day
[1:13:27] revelation of the name
[1:13:30] we lost the revelation of the name in
[1:13:33] the Dark Ages and come out calling him
[1:13:37] the second person of the Trinity in that
[1:13:42] name is 9
[1:13:48] to get it is nothing is Jesus that's too
[1:13:56] simple and you just moved us up from
[1:14:01] calling in God so for now we'll call him
[1:14:03] Jesus the Bible don't have no trouble
[1:14:07] calling God the Bible don't have any
[1:14:10] trouble calling you Jehovah the Bible
[1:14:12] don't have any trouble calling me mellow
[1:14:13] humor you know over the nine
[1:14:14] photographer instead of him but rattled
[1:14:17] it out on no problem of calling him
[1:14:21] Jehovah little Jehovah crying in the
[1:14:23] cradle
[1:14:23] Little Joe hopeless working in the
[1:14:27] carpenter shop there's your hovel laying
[1:14:31] in the manger he had no trouble to them
[1:14:35] see or not it don't in it don't
[1:14:39] influence me for you to use words that
[1:14:43] you think are so smart in other words
[1:14:46] you say well now we know instead of
[1:14:48] we're calling him God
[1:14:50] we'll call him Jesus he is my god he is
[1:14:57] my father he is my Savior he is my all
[1:15:01] and all in Jesus is his name but has it
[1:15:07] clip I mean by revelation that Jesus is
[1:15:14] the only name of God I'm just Adonis's
[1:15:25] anxiety
[1:15:28] if that was made known right here
[1:15:30] tonight you couldn't hold this building
[1:15:34] together with people hollering and
[1:15:36] screaming I'm talking about myself what
[1:15:42] do you mean we know I came in Jesus but
[1:15:45] do we know that is my father
[1:15:46] that is my Savior that is my all and all
[1:15:49] that is everything and his name is Jesus
[1:15:52] you want to write him a letter
[1:15:54] don't ride it Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:15:57] and sign it right you don't want to
[1:16:02] check written out that way do you
[1:16:08] he's doing this Jesus you know what I
[1:16:13] like about him Gordon the Chrysler
[1:16:16] mister God revealed the bride is part of
[1:16:21] the mystery must be revealed
[1:16:22] Oh God was reporting Christ cited right
[1:16:28] in here but not that quote but another
[1:16:30] all the God was reporting Christ all
[1:16:32] Christ a church he's part of the mystery
[1:16:37] but who wants to know anything about the
[1:16:39] bride the end Ruthie he's part of the
[1:16:46] mystery and got to be revealed
[1:16:53] you can't be revealed as a second person
[1:16:58] you can't be revealed as some of the
[1:17:00] thoughts or ideas the Bride of Christ is
[1:17:04] not another person it is God made
[1:17:11] manifest in another form called a bride
[1:17:21] sons and daughters of God have the name
[1:17:24] of God what is your name miss Jesus
[1:17:38] mm oh God is a strong tower the
[1:17:42] righteous run intuitive they're safe
[1:17:46] one more time to say it
[1:17:48] no one title attribute thought can
[1:17:53] display all of God but the name of Jesus
[1:18:01] has within it everything that God would
[1:18:04] ever be and will ever be
[1:18:08] and he's ever-present for eternity his
[1:18:14] name is Jesus the bride part of the
[1:18:19] mystery
[1:18:19] I wouldn't when it said it Reverend said
[1:18:24] the bride would be the fullness of the
[1:18:25] Godhead bodily
[1:18:26] I talked that 1959 so you can argue oh
[1:18:29] you won't do that you see how long I've
[1:18:31] been talking about when I said the bride
[1:18:36] would be the son of man the Word made
[1:18:40] flesh again alert before che change
[1:18:43] comes that was 1969 what do you think
[1:18:52] I'm thinking now I'm just trying to get
[1:18:57] somebody to believe it you remember what
[1:19:01] I ended up saying I made a report this
[1:19:04] is my report I made the statement the
[1:19:09] way I'm in it I said these brothers that
[1:19:11] administered the last four messages
[1:19:13] Wade Bob Louise and Aaron have moved
[1:19:18] into a thought now if they'll just keep
[1:19:20] on falling what
[1:19:26] that he's real and his name is Jesus
[1:19:36] not any other night but brother Dale let
[1:19:41] me understand what you're saying do you
[1:19:43] mean to tell me that before the world
[1:19:44] ever existed his name was Jesus but I
[1:19:51] told you slice Sunday I told you that
[1:19:56] what you're doing when I say Jesus your
[1:19:58] mind goes to a human flesh right when
[1:20:05] you say Jesus your mind goes to a human
[1:20:08] flesh but remember my Bible said woman
[1:20:16] sir the Godhead bodily dwelt in this man
[1:20:21] do we understand the birth of that baby
[1:20:24] that baby was Almighty God in human
[1:20:32] flesh mold I just don't understand who
[1:20:36] run the world while he was a baby laying
[1:20:37] in the cradle
[1:20:39] wonderful all he had to do speak it for
[1:20:43] the world ever begun and it's gonna keep
[1:20:44] running well with his name before he
[1:20:48] come into the world Jesus
[1:20:58] all right
[1:21:00] along musician
[1:21:08] but do we really see it or don't we just
[1:21:10] still like I said when you say Jesus are
[1:21:13] you looking at a flesh that's all you
[1:21:18] can see
[1:21:22] remember your prophet that Jesus was the
[1:21:27] only name God ever had
[1:21:33] don't you think you just seen all them
[1:21:35] theologians sit around listening to him
[1:21:37] make it in simplicity well I said
[1:21:41] something today and I want to make this
[1:21:43] statement she said something today and I
[1:21:45] don't remember I can't get it back
[1:21:47] exactly but you know we talked about
[1:21:49] keep confusing people by you know
[1:21:52] brother Dale you just confuse people
[1:21:56] make it simple you know that's the point
[1:22:03] but they'll make it simple there's a lot
[1:22:06] of difference between simple and a small
[1:22:11] amount of something not having very much
[1:22:13] how would you say that a lot of
[1:22:15] difference between simple and something
[1:22:19] that's don't amount to much you remember
[1:22:23] the wording I can't get it but we sure
[1:22:27] could but I'll try my best to express it
[1:22:30] these simple means something that has
[1:22:34] been explained right education is
[1:22:41] something that can never be explained
[1:22:45] people are this makes you say I don't
[1:22:47] learn Oh them things I want to stay self
[1:22:50] full praise God simple means it's been
[1:22:55] revealed may I say it like this a
[1:23:05] prophet ain't going
[1:23:10] that had the channels to go all the way
[1:23:12] to God and come back and bring to us a
[1:23:17] simple gospel and he said I'm a father
[1:23:28] I'm a son I'm here with me and he just
[1:23:37] explained the Godhead that mankind could
[1:23:41] never explain
[1:23:44] he made it simple
[1:23:50] the seals he made it simple you
[1:23:58] explained the white horse rider the red
[1:24:02] horse rider the black the pale he made
[1:24:06] it simple not small so everybody wants
[1:24:12] you to keep what they want to use
[1:24:14] another word Durst is not simple but it
[1:24:16] would mean you know don't don't get too
[1:24:18] deep with anything you're making it too
[1:24:20] deep Shilo thank you who got that one
[1:24:24] Aaron he must have been listening to me
[1:24:26] and nany talking today because that was
[1:24:28] word I was listening for shallow make it
[1:24:31] shallow brother Dale shallow means you
[1:24:34] don't have nothing right shallow means
[1:24:40] you went down as far as you can go
[1:24:43] simple means something that can be
[1:24:46] understood one true and living God
[1:24:54] brought to mankind so simple my prophet
[1:25:00] now started to him they're the most
[1:25:04] illiterate person and get born again
[1:25:10] that's not shallow that just went over
[1:25:15] the heads of most everybody on that
[1:25:18] internet system out there looking
[1:25:20] listening with coach they say brother
[1:25:22] Dale just too deep I can't understand
[1:25:24] you know what that means that means you
[1:25:28] ain't listening to the simplicity you
[1:25:31] won't live to be shallow man came into
[1:25:40] pulpit one day and having helped me I'm
[1:25:42] not against the others he said I want to
[1:25:44] tell you something he said I've got a
[1:25:46] great revelation here about God and he
[1:25:49] said you know who he is he's God that's
[1:25:53] really years he's caught then Ellis quit
[1:25:58] called we've we've got the message he's
[1:26:00] gone
[1:26:05] was he shallow who was he simple which
[1:26:09] one was we can't understand these deep
[1:26:13] things will ones your prophet preach it
[1:26:24] the most simple language that any human
[1:26:28] being could ever use in a theologian
[1:26:33] sitting there looking at him and if he's
[1:26:35] got any spiritual sense he says Lord let
[1:26:41] me have that for where I can explain
[1:26:45] what you showed me man one time told me
[1:26:52] he said brother Dale he said you got
[1:26:55] what I went to school to try to learn I
[1:27:01] said but you're not living it that way
[1:27:03] he was looking and they know who I'm
