TRANSCRIPT
========================================
shining in the light of your glory pour out your power holy holy ho I am the shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen good be in the house of the Lord this even amen y'all just pray for me tonight it's one thing to get something from the lord it's something else to deliver it so y'all just pray for me this evening I'm also going to do something I've never done before I'm going to use that board yeah so y'all in for a treat tonight so well if if if I can just deliver the way it came to me that Brother D asked me Sunday night and I woke up Monday morning about 4:30 and I was there from 4:30 to 7: just the Lord showing me something and amen now if I just if I just give it to you L he gave it to me so y'all just pray for me we're going to look in the scripture we're going to look into Hebrews chapter one read very familiar scripture and he's been enjoying what brother D's been preaching on this going to be kind of in the in the same in the same area same line and uh just thank the Lord for what he's been able to give to us as Brother D said it is the to understand that's right I'm so glad that we have ears to hear amen before we read the scripture let's just all bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for this time to be in your house Lord Jesus realizing that we're So Unworthy to Stand Here Lord but it it takes you to to come and Speak Lord Jesus we just pray that you'll come tonight Lord give us the words to to speak also give us the ears to hear that we may receive from you Lord from each one that's here in the needs that are represented father we just pray that you come and minister to each one ones that are not here for whatever reason we just pray that you just touch them in a special way and father we just pray that you just lead us and guide us in all things lord it's such a late hour Lord but we're so thankful that that we have a place to go to am when when times are hard and we don't seem like we know which way to go but we know there's one that's guiding us that's leading us glory Lord if we can just yield ourselves the Holy Spirit can come and lead us and guide us into all truth that's what we pray for tonight bless each one but we just look unto you we give you thanks for all things we know it all comes from you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Hebrews 1 verse1 says God who at sunred times and in diverse manner spank in times past un the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much more better than the angels as he ha by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they For unto which of the Angels said he at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of God worship Him and of the angels He saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but unto the son he saith thy Throne oh God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou Hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows and thou Lord in the beginning H has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thy hands they Shall Perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shall thou fold them up and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same and thy years shall not fail but to them to but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thine enemies thy foot stol are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who are who shall be Heirs of Salvation amen may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word and uh can somebody get me some water I a tell you right now I'm going to need some but uh been enjoying what Brother D has been speaking on that's right because you know we understand the the whole the whole Bible the whole uh Capstone Revelation right is one God right and you know brother bam said you know we you know if we see who he is we see we are see ourselves amen because you know that's who we that's who we are we are we are a part of him and we can see we see who he is and we see who we are right because if you can't see yourself in the scripture you have to see him and you have to see when he reveals himself and he's revealing because he's going to reveal you because you're going to make him known he's going to make you known that's right but you're going to have because he's going to make you see who you are but you're going to see who he is right and so even and the even as brother R talked about understanding that when he when he started you know he said all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was was he poured into the church and so we can see we have to see who we are but we see we see him amen and so looking here in the in the scripture okay I try not try not to bump into it or kick it or anything yeah for the video okay say I'm well that' be better cuz I'm right-handed so so I have to get on that side but uh any anyway the thought that I have tonight that that I want to speak on is I want to speak on the the essence of God and uh you know we we know that brother vom said that God didn't change in his essence or his or his behavior right ex and so that scripture here when I was when I was because that was that was the word that came to me was Essence yeah and what does Essence mean well and so if we um hold on let me see here it is yall just have to pray for now I've got everything jumbled up this you know cuz I've I've went over this thing about fearful four times so I'm I'm going to have to look at try to figure out where things are at cuz they're not in the same order as they were before but Essence the definition of essence is the attribute or set of attributes that make an object or substance what it fundamentally is and which it has by necessity and without it it loses its identity Essence is contrasted with accident and so it says a property which the the uh the the property that the object or substance has contingently without which the substance can still retain its identity right exactly so we want to look at the what what Essence is and know a lot of people think of essence as alcohol or they think of it as the perfume or something like that because they think of that that is or they think it it's just the fundamental part of of uh of something right but actually when you look at it in U in a in a philosophical way in a scientific way when you deal with the essence of something you're actually looking at all of the attributes that make up the object or the substance whatever it is and so that's how it's defined as the whole and it says it has to have this by necessity right because if it doesn't have one of these uh characteristics or properties then it's not what it is right and it also says without it it loses its identity so um one of the examples that it that it gives when I was looking this up was it talks about like a chair now we you know we we have a chair and we all know have an idea what a chair is a chair has a seat it has legs and it has a back to it now we all you know in the South M you know we always say have a seat we don't say have a chair right right I have a bench but it all but a chair has those has those characteristics now when we speak of chair you know a chair can be made out of plastic a chair can be made out of wood but when you but when you define that chair as one as a as a certain characteristic when as and and just going back to what Brother D always talk about he said when you start in Genesis with a white dog you have to end with a white dog in Revel when you end you have the same when you what it is in the beginning has to the same all the way through so if you decide if you define the chair as being wood then it doesn't matter if it's made of plastic or anything else if it's not wood right or if it's a polymer y a press board material that has that's well sure it's got wood in but it's got a lot of glue in it but it's not but if you have a just a wood chair and you define it as wood good if it has a padded seat then it's not the chair right because it because it has changed in its in its uh attributes it's changing the characteristics of what identifies it as that chair right so when you take the when you have a one chair and you have that and then when you take away the back of it it still has legs and it still has a seat but you no longer have a chair you still have a place to sit but you got a stool right right that's right you don't have a chair good good and then if you have if you leave the back but you take the leg away the legs then you don't have a chair you have a seat yeah right because you know that's what they because you don't have a you don't take a bleacher chair to the bleachers it's a bleacher seat right because what is it it's a padded it's a padded bottom and a back to right and so it it's identified by its characteristics so if it loses a characteristic then it loses its identity right so when you when you think about what the essence of it is it's not just the not always it's is it considered it's fun just the fundamental part of it because if you because you sometimes people think it was just the one characteristic but it's also it's the whole characteristic because every part of it makes it what it is right right and so we take we look at the essence of an object or of a person and and we look here and the the reason I chose this scripture was because in the in the looking through looking through the scripture to understand what what the essence of of something was when when you're reading the Scripture it brings you to Hebrews 1:3 because when it talks about and this is the definition I found when it when it talks about and the express image of his person when you look that up one of the translations is the very expression of the essence of God right the very expression of the essence of God so when he was speaking of the son y so when the sun came into existence the sun was the very expression amen exactly because even in Colossians 1 when he talks about he be he was the visible right of the invisible God why because he was invisible to us but that didn't mean that he didn't exist right right because I hope I hope because there's a few things I want to talk about tonight the reason I want to use this forward and I hope when I get into this because there's a few things I want I want to show you some of them are scientific some of them are mathematical and don't don't everybody just don't go lose lose me just cuz I say that but if you can understand and I hope I can express it Bless but if you can see who he is that's it right when he where he started amen when he start when he started as Elohim and if he if he's not if he doesn't change he has the same Essence then who is here today right and and we we see who we are but we can see who he is right and you know brother R in the in the pergam church age he also he said you know he says that Jesus was the express image of God the scripture tells us that he was the express image he was the essence of God exactly and so we understand what was what was the essence that came out in the beginning because I I want to show you something and this I don't know how long this is going to take me so y'all just pray for me but uh I got I got two or three drawings on and we won't get to them all at once but y'all just pray for me but uh I hope y'all can see this this going everybody see that everybody know what this ISS the number line everybody use that in school remember that you got one and you add two to it two three so you okay everybody understand that good okay now when we speak of when we speak of the assets of God and he come in Jesus was the essence of God beginning he was the self-existing he was Elohim so we know they started out he was Elohim and so then he said what came forth from him was the sun amen right amen the sun came forth right exactly now brother brandham said in several places he said all that God was he poured into Christ right that's right all that Christ was he poured into the church amen now Jehovah Gyra number one 1964 brother Brenham said everything everything that was in God God poured into Christ right right and then he said everything that was in Christ he poured into the believer right amen so everything and everybody you know brother always says all means all all that God was he poured in Christ all okay how there's there's M multitude of quotes that we can look at but take my word for it cuz you can find it CU Brother D gave it to you before right God is infinite exactly right God is infinite got it amen and that's what I want to show you I want to show you I want to explain something about to about Infinity to you does anybody understand what Infinity is mathematical concept scientific concept of unlimitless right exactly okay the simplest form we deal with is a number line and we know that we go to Infinity on the number line go as far as you want to right you can go Millions trions quintillion on that's as far as I go past trions I don't know any the rest of them but there's a bunch of them you can look them up and then we know there's a negative in Infinity over here as far as you go that way you go that way right you go as far as you go in the future you go in the back amen and so we know that as far as you go here you go here it's in it's infinite there's there's not there's so when we deal with we talk about God being Limitless being infinite when we reach here we talk about infinite infinity and so we see there's numbers you can't count right what happens if you divide infinity and half Infinity amen if you divide Infinity by Infinity what do you have Infinity you can't you can't because you can't limit what it is so when you when you say that something that has reached infinity or you know that has Infinity then no matter what you do to it it's infin it's infinite right in science they'll tell you that you know we have two objects that have that have magnetism we see we see that in in space two objects pulling against each other because they're attracted to each other right right now I just this something brother talked about when he talked about magnetism here's a magnet and you know it has all the little the field all around it where's the strongest point and where's the weakest point I should say where's the weakest Point where's the weakest point at in a in a magnet it's in the middle there's that's that's the weakest point now when we talk about in Infinity just to give you a couple of ideas about things and Concepts when you when you look at the these two planets see science can tell us that we can look and see because we use it all the time when we send up a satellite we use the gravitational pull of planets right as a swingshot y right because as they come around the around the planet the the field actually causes them as they come into that orbit it speeds them up when they go past it and it's a slingshot it sends them out faster and so uh when when you're looking at this Force when you're looking at this field this magnetism see we see this and and I just want you to see this as an analogy here we see this in the heavens we see we see the the planets having pull on each other all the things that happen in the heavens are based on the gravitational pull right right and see we don't see that and in our human element here yeah because we're living in the negative right exactly see if we understand and if we and this is like extremely large and if this is extremely small let's let's go down and you look at a atom and I'm not going to draw but you know we have a nucleus and we have everybody remembers that from science yeah yeah protons neutrons and you got an electron see we understand that and you know Neil boore had the had the basic concept now they have it it's so hard to understand with all the orbitals and everything that they have figured out that uh electrons move in a in an atom that it's just you know it's more than most people's mind can handle but when you when you look at that electron is moving around that atom right you know there was a man from NASA said one time as a a scientist from NASA and and just to give you just to give you the understanding of the size of this when I was in school they told us that if you could Elevate the nucleus of an atom to the size of a speck of dust the electron that's floating off of that thing in the veent Shell which is the most outer ring that thing would be miles and miles and miles away from the nucleus so you can imagine and those things I mean it's I me it's minuscule the size of that that's right but that electron is being controlled by that right oh yeah that far away yep and we see and they they told us the N the scientists told us because if you look at the distance here that that has an effect on the mass and I hope I hope y'all understand what I'm talking about the mass the the stuff that makes up something right you know it's just like you know the the question is you know what weighs more a pound of feathers or a pound of bricks you know they weigh the same because because the pounds are the same the question is is what's the mass of them if you to put a pound of bricks in a in a in a place of a pound of feathers you know you'd have a lot more feathers so it take up more space because there's more mass in the bricks because it's the way it's constructed it's made tighter together so that's the reason that uh when when we look at the distance here from the N from this nucleus to the electron when you look at the size of that the NASA scientist said if we could take the distance here and we could compact all of this into that area where it would be sitting compacted together this right here he said we could take all of the mass of the known universe the one what man knows the mass of the whole known universe he said you could pack it all into the size of a golf ball so you can understand how the distance is if we can understand how minute things are than you and that was spoken and put in place by the word of God right amen and it is controlled by the word of God and so all of that is being moved right right right and so we can see how Minal that is yet that is as as I believe brother man told us we'd be changing our atoms right absolutely amen and so there there's where it's going to be and see how my n that is but see we are living in the negative right that's right because we don't see that we don't see that pull while we living in a negative but we can see it on a on a very small scale if we look at it very minute things we can see an amazing thing taking place if we go into the heavens we can see amazing things take place but we don't see them where we're at because we're not looking right right come on because you know brother Brown I have that quote in here where brother Brown talks about another as time evangelism brother talks about you can't exhaust God that's right amen and he also says you know he talks about the little fish he said uh about swimming in the ocean he said you know I must drink sparing it might go dry sometime yeah or he's talking about the uh mouse eating in the in the uh garders of Egypt having to eat sparingly because we might not make it to the next Harvest yeah and you know he was talking about you know that's the way people look at it and he said Oh my he said that's trying to exhaust God's goodness and mercy to his people he wants to bless you he's ready he's pressing could you imagine taking all the waters in the Earth the Seas and everything and piling it into one 4ft pipe and putting it up there the pressure would be on the bottom of it trying to find a little crevice to leak its way through that's like the pressure of the Holy Ghost trying to come down on every life but he says but they won't do it they love crazing things better than they love God right mhm and so we can understand see we we we see that we're missing but he's moving right right exactly and we see now to give you so that gives you an I hope that gives you an idea of what what we're talking about when we talk about something being infinite yeah because even even this that that's not that's not infinite right that's right the mass the of that adom has a limit the distance of that thing has a limit so we can talk about these things being seeing how small they are and God controls that but he's he's greater than that righten that that is that is just a minute and we can see the things in the heavens and right you know we understand even when Einstein you brother Brown said that if we could you know if Einstein had the spiritual with the natural he could have really told us so because really understood those things and to understand that when Einstein was looking at when he was speaking on the theory of relativity and everything when you go back and study the things that he was talking about you know he was even talking about that we we think of I got I got to share this with you brother Brenham said the quote that brother Dale gave us uh watch off service he said can't you see God is covers all space fills all time and runs into eternity he said God cover when God who covers all space and all eternity now when when Einstein was looking you know he was he was realizing that light doesn't travel in a straight line right yeah he said because he could figure that one out but when he was looking at the when he was looking at this the objects the planets he could see the light was bending but even when he calculated he said it couldn't not be that the light was just being pulled by that gravitational pull of the of the planet right he actually discovered that space space itself had a force and that was what was causing because it was also pushing now listen this the fourth space was pushing on the light to bend the light around the around the planet and Not only was the force of this but there was something else there that was bending the light yeah amen and we think that space we look in space and we think it's nothing we think it's a vast emptiness a vast void and that's where God is because he said he took all of space so if he's there then see he was even controlling that right sureen see even even in the even in the scientific realm Einstein could prove that was something else because what else was there right right they stood there and said there's nothing there it's empty but that's where he was at yeah because he's there when when you don't think he's there that's where he's there amen that's where you find him amen yes sir see I didn't know y was going to get a science classad I got a couple other things I want to share with you when you speak on on on things being infinite going back to the number line here we know we've got infinite this way and we've got Infinity this way yeah but what we don't realize that's Infinity also absolutely yeah amen yes sir see when you when you look at this number line see we're always taught that this is a finite set we think it's one two but how many how many numbers fall between one and two one and a half one and a quarter you can divide that into thousands millions trillions klions as many as you divide in there you can still have more you can continue divide that and still have more right amen so when we look at God being infinite we say God God's infinite and see when you and when when I see we talking about infinite I also see Eternal right I can see that because brother Brandon said that all that God was he poured into Christ and he poured that into the believer right now and he said he said but he gave us a measure that's right exactly we were given a measure right just like he talking about the Spoonful of the ocean he said it was a same elements the same characteristics in that ocean spoonful of the ocean was also in the ocean and he said it wasn't he said it was not in quality it was because it's not in quantity it was in quality because you have the same thing and see you have a measure sure of eternal life right you have because see we think and and see if we understand that if we understand that because we look at um understand the vastness of it but if we can understand that's whatw dwells in us then when you see what dwells in you then you can understand why brother brandham said that we could we're creators amen exactly he said you had the you had the ability to speak a world and go live on right and if that because see it was a part right amen and see another thing is when you come down here and you see this this is where you're at in the negative right yeah and see as brother Donny was asking on W when he was doing the the questions see when you when you talk about negative -3 is is more positive than -4 right yeah because you're moving in a positive direction right right and so yeah so when you go forward yeah it's negative but it's positive because you receed the positive but it's still negative because as soon as you reach here then guess what youve got to go on so this right here is is the negative of the positive and so you move on from here and you keep moving so it doesn't matter how far you go even you know because when you reach four then the next number is five because we got to keep continuing on this is the negative of five and then there's a negative of that and a negative of that because see you continue on so there is no limit to God but see there is a portion that that's going to be made known here y right exactly but but there is a a message of cheer down through the endless ages so there is an because you know if you reach a place where God you run out of God if you run out of the unfolding of God then he's not infinite exactly Glory that's right yep that's right then that that he that he's not God am exactly and and the other thing when you when you look at an object one one object and the and the and the other object they the force that they that's pulling against these two is based on their Mass right the mass of one is is directly the pull that it has is directly proportional to the mass that it has yeah yeah so that's the reason that when they go around black holes and stuff they talk about the mass is because the mass is shrunk down right and so it's become compacted so there's a larger Mass there and that mass has a pull but when you see when when when science when they look at this because there's no way to to measure this they just you know because there's no working model of an Infinity but something that has infinite mass or Infinite Energy the pull that it has on another object you know what you end up with infinity anything that has infinite Mass Infinite Energy the pull on that is infinite yeah right there is there's no there's no end to the pull it pulls it right in there's no way to overcome that so whatever whatever you start with that's infinite it doesn't matter what you do to it whatever it has the characteristics that it has whatever it does it's all infinite because there's no way to there's no other way for it to overcome anything so when you when you see that you understand if you understand that concept of of seeing that something that's Eternal that's right he said no man can come to me unless my father draws him that's right he said he said the very head of the hairs of your head are all numbered right he said I he said you're written in the palms of my hands he said he said I wouldn't lose a one of them that's right if you and so what what is that that's that is because it's an eternal pull right and so the Eternal pool that started here can you can't overcome that amen thank you Lord there's no way to overcome that exactly so he can't lose you right amen so I hope you I hope you like that that's what the Lord showed me so we can we can see who we are exactly and so when we come to this so I'm bad at this but but what he said he was self-existing he dealt along with his attributes Elohim self-existing when he when he was existing he said back before the Eternal right so when you come to that when you come to this and you you know God has to speak to you the way he can speak to you amen and you know I mean maybe maybe God maybe I'm the only one that God can use you know that he can speak through things that I understand right because I've been there and I've done it so to me I can when when I I can see things that are scien I can understand that I can understand things that are mathematical right and so you know I can see where he said he said in the beginning before the Eternal right oh my the self-existing one exactly he said he he said he dwelt along with his attributes there he was the essence of God that's what he started with here back before the Eternal back back when there was nothing when he was by itself because Eternal speaks of something that came in a in a progression right because that's what came when when he started to condescend he said in the condescending he said the Son of God came into view right Christ amen he said he said that's what came out of you and so if you see that what came out of Elohim was the Christ exactly this that's what came here was was the son of God that's what came into being right and so when when you see and people say all that God was he poured into Christ and then they try to do away with God yeah they try to do away with this part and see if you can understand that what what was here Y is infinite is eternal exactly what is here all that God was here he poured into Christ the only thing that he could pour into Christ was the essence of God but he could not pour away because he's infinite so if he was infinite then how can you divide you can't divide infinite because you'd still have infinite and infinite exactly so you can you can't you can't do away with God so when it what came into the bride what came into the bride he said the bride was the fullness of the godhe had bottle if this is what he was right was the fullness then that's what we are we are the fullness then that's what then that's what we see what took place here with what took place here yes sir so I can understand when he said everything that God was he poured into Christ everything that Christ was he poured into the believer because that because we have we are the very essence of God right exactly y because see that's why that's why we have a hard time wrapping our mind around Who We Are Who that we can see see when we see all God was he poured into him right and you can't exhaust him right exactly righten so if we can't exhaust see you can't exhaust this then what came into here that's what came here right the unchangeable god that's what that is who we are we have become the unchangeable god right if we see that that's what you know lots of times we don't see that right brother amen and so bless you y'all pray for me see some sometimes when you preach you you look at things I've had things in and well I'll be done in 30 minutes takes me an hour and a half yeah I've had things make look like it take you forever next say you know I'll be done in 45 minutes oh and so you never know how things are going to go but uh all right you know I just I just know I'm going to come up here I'm going to say what I got to say and I'm I'm right am cuz if I if I just say what I got to say then I won't get any trouble and I was going I was going to say this this afternoon when I started that if I mess up on anything if I say anything wrong we got two up here got two Fine Brothers in the front they take care of it and they can straighten me out and they can answer all your questions I just come in to say it and if it's wrong they fix it no but I mean if you don't but I mean if you don't understand if we can help you I mean sure we we would like to be able to express it in a in a way that maybe the Lord can help because right because you know and you know there's many different quotes that you you look at and uh even when when you speak of the essence of God just just give you a few quotes uh in the patmas vision the church age book I think that's page 50 brother brand said the outpouring the original outpouring of Pentecost which outpouring came directly from Jesus on the mercy suit is in doing his church through all the Seven Ages showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today yesterday and today and forever the neighbor changing God in his Essence and his ways so we understand and even brother talked about the woman at the well the elame woman when he came he said she met the very essence of eternal life right and even the uh in the Smur Church age he said uh speaking of uh let's see even in the Ephesian Church age he said uh Behold Him who is even now walking in the midst of the churches through all ages Behold Him who is the same yesterday and today and forever and who never changes in either in his essence or his ways he said the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you can see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior right so that's just a few quotes that I had that that we understand God and the essence understanding the attributes yeah the the be the the attributes of God how they don't change right and how they were just carried over and so the other thing that the other thing that struck me when you're speaking of the attributes when you're thinking when you're talk about the essence of God where he what he in the beginning Elohim the self-existing one when he came into Christ see they say was Jesus a different identity well let me let me ask you this this this is this is a def this is definitions of of identity the state or fact of remaining the same one or ones as under varying aspects or conditions the state of having unique identifying characteristics held by no other person or thing exact likeness in nature or qualities the condition of being one self or itself and not another the distinct personality of an individual regarded as a persisting entity individual it so that's all that's definitions of an identity well we know the son of the Son of God came out in the beginning amen and he said that he said he doesn't change in his Essence exactly or his ways or his behavior right and he said this was a part of God that came out not like an arm or a leg but he said it was the but a part of God came out right and he said it was the Sun so we understand that was the essence of God exactly so the essence of God came out and so we understand if we if we understand that and we understand that the exact it's exact likeness in nature qualities the same act the state or act of remaining the same one or ones remaining the same one as under varing aspects or conditions right brother Brandon preached the message the unchangeable god acting in an unexpected way right so he was because he was unchangeable God but he came into a different form right and so the form but that didn't change who he was right so how can so if this is what and then he said he became the fullness of the godhead bodily y right yep in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh right if he became flesh then how can you have a different identity right come on that's right because if he started with those things he doesn't change then how can then how can you have him as a different identity right see you you've already made him because you know it's like it's like comparing apples and oranges to fruit right yeah because you start with you start with a division that you can't ever overcome right it doesn't matter how much you preach one God if you start with that division exactly you'll never you never overcome that you always you always have that division right am and so he was not he was not a different identity he changed he just as brother told us he said he just changed his mask he came in he came into another form but that didn't change who he was because Christ Christ was revealed all the way down through the Angels because we saw we saw that all the way through all the in the prophet because brother speaking up the prophets building the body right if the if the prophets built the body on what they done because we understand and I got got a couple other things I I want to share with you can we turn to Romans chapter 16 Romans 1625 I don't know I like I like this script it says now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith to God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ forever amen I tell you what the Apostle Paul can say a lot in a few words because you know here he is he's speaking he's speaking of a he said the revelation of the mystery right that was Kept Secret you know brother Ram there's two scriptures there's two scriptures that come to mind when I when I when I first read this the first one the first one is Amos 3:7 he said he said he would he would do nothing he said he would reveal his secret right to the prophets he didn't say that he would re rece reveal the mystery he said he would rece the M the secret unto the prophets and so that was what he said the mystery was Kept Secret yeah right and so see without unless you see something or something takes place you do not know there's a mystery exactly see that's just like the the first time the uh the Indians and think it was in Mexico or somewhere down that way uh some of the U um explorers were coming through and the Indians had never seen a black men and there was one in the in the group that was exploring and you know they were so amazed at that that they walked up to him and they tried to rub the black off of him and they were examining him because he was so amazed they never seen that before yeah but see that was a secret to them they never knew that right and so until they saw that then it became a mystery to them yeah because they were and so see God had to come down and he was revealing himself that was the secret people didn't understand that's right and so it became it was unfolding glory and so people didn't understand the prophets they didn't understand they didn't understand why Moses done the things he done why Jeremiah done the things he done Ezekiel why were they why they done the things that they done was because they were making him known and so as the scripture tells us see the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began see it was a secret y but see they didn't know what was going on but God kept trying to unveil himself even even in all of the things said through the Old Testament through the building of the Tabernacle and all of The Commandments and everything he was revealing himself right amen see as you know brother said he said they took it as a book of rules and regulations and missed him yeah yep amen and you know in Jeremiah there when he speaking of it he said they they've HED out sists broken sists he said they missed me the Fountain of Living Water Glory that's right he said theyve missed me and he said he said but they have broken sistems that hold no water right that's right and so we see see but in the end time what Revelation 10 tell us the mystery right would be made known brother said that all the Loose Ends would be tied up Sir see the mystery had to be made known see that's what came in the because see it was a secret but the secret was being unfolded yeah because brother brother said the mystery was kept secret Y and so it came as he was unfolding then there became a mystery because when he when when he walked in flesh he said you know because he said look back at what was written he said see if I don't do what what was said of me right amen right he said if if I'm not the one that that they spoke of Y he said search the scriptures and say and say if that's not who who I am I am what thought what was spoke of me right and that's what he done he come to fulfill right you know as brother said he walked in he walked in a a realm of perfect Faith yeah why did he walk in a realm of perfect Faith because he knew what he was supposed to do right sure he had to grow in Grace and knowledge sure sure when when he came into into into the flesh sure he was bound by that flesh see because brother BR said God is infinite but we're finite he came into a finite being right see he was he was limited by what he right and as as Brother D was talking about see you understand when he said God is so great he can forget yeah thank you right exactly he he's so big that he can that he can limit himself Y and not change why because that's an attribute right exactly see we can't we can't do that we can forgive but we can't always forget right right amen and the problem that we have is when we try to remember we forget right right exactly see there things there's things that I had to write notes on this afternoon because I thought well I'll remember that I don't remember I had to write if I didn't put notes down I would have forgot right because and you know I'm thinking I I kept going over this and things in my mind like well I should remember that well I don't right cuz sometimes you know I don't know if y'all know this or not if you ever been up in front of a group sometimes you forget things so people look at you and then yeah you know I'm glad thank you for all the ones that are smiling yeah um but you know we see Elohim coming into flesh and when he came into flesh see all that was spoken of him that's what he done right and he walked in the realm of perfect Faith because he said I I do nothing except for what my father showeth me right he said the son can do nothing of himself what except what he see the father do right he said that doth the son likewise right right you know that that that all that struck me the first time I really saw that to understand that you know he could walk out there and and he just walked and come and come to a place that he could have confidence with with God yeah because he came in he came into that place that he could walk and that's the reason when he came to the pool of bethesa you know he couldn't do anything but there was one that he could come to that's right and he could come to all the different ones that's right and there he was and all the people that were sick in his own country he said is not without honor except in his own country right see he he knew where he was at but you know he could he couldn't do anything but to the ones that he could when Lazarus was Lazarus was sick he knew what was going to take place so he didn't have to worry about it right he didn't worry he just went on about his business because until the time came that he could come to Lazarus then then he knew what he was going to do right Y and yet here here he was in flesh and yet the yet the yet the flesh that he dwelt in he could be sick he could hurt he could be lonely y exactly as the scripture says you know he was our high priest that it could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities that he understood those things that that that even even he didn't want to die but he gave but he yielded himself under under the wheel of the father not my will but thine be done so he had to even come to that place that he had to work through all those things and yet he he come through that right amen that's it and see we see that what took place here was you know what what took place here what we saw was God in flesh right come on now and so we see that what came out it was God condescending the whole time exactly and here he come all the way down that's right that's right that's right and we understand the spirit left him yeah in the garden but that didn't change who he was no right that's right because he had to be anointed to to the ministry right right see that that didn't change him from here to here even when he died that's right the life that left him that's right when the spirit left him the Holy Spirit left him amen because it had to be the that the only thing it could be right that's right brother so the life that went out from him because he said the life that came out of him came out of Jesus on the cross he said that same life came back onto the bride that's right Glory so we we received see so we received the life of Elohim we've received Eternal amen we've received we've received a portion of that infinite but that infinite is still infinite amen hallelujah and see we can understand see no matter how how vast God is we understand one thing brother Ram said see if I can find it then I'm going I don't see here it is and lean not to your own understanding brother R says so you see if you were in the forn knowledge of God right then you are becoming a part of God exactly and the only way you can be a son or a son of God or a daughter of God is you had to be a part of God glory and God isn't complete without you GL exactly because see God said he was brother said that God came to display all his attributes right is that right all the attributes of God came because The Plan of Redemption came the the plan that came into existence was to display all those attributes right right now God is infinite but I want you to see one thing the part of God that you received is just like this part right here yeah right you can go this way as far as you want to you can go that way as far as you want to but just to give you an illustration this is only there's only one one and a half in the whole number line right this right here Che that's infinite that's an infinite set of numbers that way that's an infinite set of numbers that way you can have but but if that part of God is not made manifest God's not complete amen that's right amen he can be infinite but there's a part of God that you and I Glory are to manifest right brother Bram said the ministry of Jesus Christ right was not complete he said he left something for the bride to do manifest Jesus Christ that's who we are right there we have come from the mind of God right the very essence of God that's it is now in flesh am hallelujah amen that's right and we' we've had somebody coming in the last days and it's not just brother brandom coming because Brother D was talking about that angel that came and spoke to John he said he he didn't he didn't trust it to nobody no angel no man nobody right it come he came himself right y that's what he came and revealed that made that manifest what came in what came in our day exactly amen see we we've had we've had the voice of God glory we've heard the voice of God exactly amen and so that's what's speaking to us it's not the it's not the voice of William Brown right but it's the voice that speaks through the man Glory that spoke through the man as he said you know he said he said you know he said I am a son of man revealing the son of man right that's right so he was there and there was a part you know he just came to be the mouthpiece to speak to speak the word to you and I that we become this that we become who he is exactly we are we are because then then you understand what a manifested son is right so one that one that's come because if you see he didn't lose any of his attributes he didn't he didn't lose anything he didn't change the essence of God did not change here to here what changes when it comes to here see it's the same one that comes here right so it's not as brother Dell told us it's not the father going off the scene it's the father coming on the scene why because it's the father being made manifest amen because it's the essence of God being made known right because see that's the reason that brother Bram said when the bride says I and my father are one he said then watch the shut away see that's the because when you see who you are you can see see people have missed that they're missing that they're missing the part of seeing who they are right that's right because you can see we we are we are him amen he said the same word that speaks of the Bride also speaks of the groom the same that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride Glory mhmh because he said that he became us he became sin who knew no sin that we might become the very righteousness of God so if we have become see then it's God made manifest again in flesh amen see when when you see who you are he said then the Rapture will take place well you've got to see who you are you've got to see that you are living breathing instrumentalities of Jesus Christ you got to see that you are the fullness that's right because he said what he pour into what what from God was poured into Christ was poured into the believer people we get in our mind we're talking about the bride but you know we we're going to become the fullness right right exactly because that's what's taking place right right right that's what that is what's happening but negative to positive right you continue on exactly it's being poured in being molded and made into the image of Jesus Christ right that's it amen right amen God bless you i' it bless I hope you enjoyed that amen amen amen we'll all stand the musicians will come I glory amen amen we believe in miracles amen amen hallelujah

so we go this evening anybody have any anything to say any all mind Hearts clear before we go let's give her brother I sharing with a guy about the infinity one time up on a travel cage painy he said Infinity had a beginning and end like that you know let me tell you something about Infinity that really impressed me it used to be a TV show a long time ago um Ben Casey was the name of it and when man come out there he drew a picture of a circle and cross under it said this is a man or woman I don't know which one it was then he draw a thing you know and he said then this one's a man like that you know and then he went up there and he draw that like that you know and he said that's Infinity it didn't make any difference you know it didn't make nothing to me at that time what maybe when I come to understand the message of the hour and where you're coming to and you can take that infinity and stand it up this way and becomes an eight when they used to when they first started printing because the printing presses back then right when when liance and all of them that started developing calculus and Newton and all of them when print and presses didn't have Infinity so that's what they done they turned the eight sideways in the print press that's that's the infinity symbol but see that thing if you if you make it r like the design they had for it not just two little circles like this and you look at it it's a circle mhm laying on its side instead of a straight line if you look at it it's a circle mm amen mean something to me I appreciate that I believe you preach not what I believe the only thing I got to do the only thing I have to do is Manifest that's right what's on one side is on the other and I can't I I don't believe that you can come to the place you talking about tonight with a trinitarian doctr because you got something that you didn't begin with that's right that's right hallelujah thank you Jesus when you see that you can see where brother R said I always was eternal right exactly I always was eternal but right I was on my way to hell right and because when it when it comes down I mean when God shows it to you people people think it's so hard but it's it's so simple God God has revealed Simplicity right that's right exactly exactly right and when you when you see when you're looking at the infinity symbol you know it's all what what one part of it is the mirror of the other you're see you're seeing you're seeing what's on one side is on the other just like you talked about the Old Testament and the New Testament they match up perfect what speaks of the Bride speaks of the groom they match perfectly right amen I tell you something's bothering me y'all pray for me I don't want to get to where I won't share with people because I know that there's people that ain't going receive it anyhow that's right but don't never get let me get to the point but but make me understand that everybody is not going to receive it right you know it's you know I I've shared with people for years and years and years and years and they just I'm Christian people so so to speak mhm and it BS me you know right then I remember when he shared one guy with me right start with i something for the truth on water baptism and I knew what he said with what I was looking for took me a while to come to it CU I had see M right but you know there's people that'll never see there's a man there's a man that's a homeless man he said cancer and he's had bunch of stuff going on and uh he's decided he wants to get in church and what have like that this is the what's going around people are telling it around right right now and he he told me when I shared with him one time he said I a see where I need to be Reb baptized but see I can't drag him down there right he's got to want to go what like that I pray God that it's truth in his life that he not just trying to find right another handout some y'all pray for me I need y we all need that right we ought to be looking and seeking and sharing y and I'm a poor example of it yes so I know where you're at yes anybody else before we go we just want to remember the ministers meeting in the Bible study and sister Susan and the family and also to think of people like brother Tom and and brother Dawn and the different ones are not able to be here with us right I'll just continue to
