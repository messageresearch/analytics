then we'll be having a good time to eat together and fellowship one with the other amen so we'll keep these announcements in mind Revelation 20 Daniel 7. Heavenly Father we thank you we love you and we thank you for all things and we ask you to just bless each and every one of us with your presence most of all Lord open our understanding because that's what we've seen we ask you to Open the Eyes of our understanding Lord that we may see you and father we need you so much so just come on and sing now in this day in the time because we know and realize that this is the ending of all things and that's come upon us but yet we are people that are to be prepared against the day and we understand and we thank you have your way now forgive us and guide us keep us in your love in Jesus name amen Revelations 20. now I spoke a little bit on this about you know a couple of weeks ago about the uh the writing of the Bible that I didn't get through with it so I wanted to come back and maybe pick it up on I'm doing again but just we'll try anyway to go forth verse 20 Revelations chapter 20 verse 11. and it's all about Chrome a great white throne and him that set on it from whom face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them all the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works now I just want to read Daniel because it's the same thing but you know just to tie it together Daniel 7 verse 9 and 10. I'll be held till the Thrones were cast down and the ancient days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his strong was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fire extreme issued and came forth before him thousands thousand thousand thousands ministered unto him and Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were opened you may be seated Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said I spoke about this on the message a few weeks ago there on the writing of the Bible and what we're doing is I want to do this message especially maybe one more uh on kind of taking what we were talking about as to happening throughout the messages there that we were preaching on what was taking place in heaven and you know we saw a good many things took place there so we want to uh you know get into that and and uh kind of try to cover some of it but what I want to do now is to bring that down to earth because we can talk about what would happen in heaven and and that's fine and that can be revealed to us but in reality you know we as human peoples uh like you know we're looking where we are and things like that we wasn't back dire but we have come down here to live out our journey all right and in doing that then um you know it's actually seeing we're actually seeing what took place that's what I want you to see is is what was shown in heaven as to would take place now where that was that was you know the the writing of the book uh like we'll get to in a minute about you know the the doings and the things and the morning Stars sang together the sons of God shouted for Joy the the different things that took place see if that doesn't take place here then how do we know whether or not there is a real reality of what took place in heaven now that that's that's my point if you don't get nothing else out of the message for the next couple of messages anyway is to get this point you and I are living in a Time when the the end of all things has come now and in doing that then we are the finality or the finishing up of all things okay all right and if if we can see the day that we're living and what's actually taking place it's fine to talk about what took place here what you know about Abraham and his journey and all but you know he wasn't there right that's right but we're here all right well now I'd rather be here than back dark I mean it's been wonderful to to experience those things of life and all that would have been great but still I'd rather be here because see all of that points to here right right and see then that that's my whole point I want us to see the reality and get as I was saying this morning that that do we have a negative confession or do we have a positive attitude right yeah all right I hope you followed that part of the message that I was trying to say that that anything below the fact of being very positive would have to be negative no matter how much it would be they would we were back there and we believed in God and we followed after God we we serve God we we went to church and and we've done all kind of things and that was wonderful I mean great you know enjoyed being there but now it's the most enjoyable of all because you realize that we're just maybe one heartbeat away from a Rapture you know what changed the moment twinkle of an eye now we know people say we've been in the Rapture all the way down well that's fine that's all right but there has to be come to a place and we're here to that we're just seconds away from the most glorious thing that has ever happened our excuse me that ever will happen upon the Earth it would be you and I walk off of this Earth in a redeemed body amen all right see then we should be more in you know more happier or enjoyable now than we was 30 years ago yes amen then we watched 10 years ago then we watch when we're the Badness and the methodists and all like that coming down we should be a whole lot happier because we're in the end time I mean we're just maybe seconds away from seeing our Lord and savior right right why wouldn't we want to be happy the one who died for us paid the price all this it's just and every second we go is one more second closure amen see we we come down through time evening you know you're like kids you know uh they they get up you know after they come up a little bit in life and and you can can ask them how old they are well I'm 12 and a half bro well you ask them you know when they're about eight or ten or something what how ten but see there's an urgency gets within the bot I mean the the child to where that is actually wanting to be older than what it is because they'll say well I I'm 13 and I 13 four months and three days to be exact you know something like that because it puts an urgency you know you want to get rich 16. right where you can drive a car right oh man something like that you know or or grow up you know well I I I don't understand why the urgency of the end time of the message or the hour there is an urgency within my heart in life now to to draw closer to realize reality of a of a change of things that are taking place I'm more happy today about the message than I've ever been and I've always been happy about it that's why I said this morning and I mean it I wish nobody would come and show me where I've always had a positive attitude about this message I've always been up to the bases that I wanted to know and see but I want to know and see what's going on right you know I love to read about what's going on now what went on in history is fine that's fine but I'm I'm living right here right right and I want to see that see and that's the point that we could talk about heaven and oh we we was there and we've done this well we wasn't there as reality of people we realized that right sure that was in the mind of God and that's greater than any thoughts we could ever think of our own being natural I used to be in but still we're here right where it's going to be finished at this is not going to be finished in heaven right right Heaven's coming here amen so this is the reality of getting here in the end time and and that's what I want your mind to be thinking about see that we're looking at what is now taking place you can look back and see what took place you look forward to hoping what will take place but what about what what's taking place right now right right this is the most important day that you've ever lived right man is this day before we can see things all right now as I said when we were preaching on it that when we were talking about being in heaven for about seven or eight messages and things that one day we would come to Earth and and that we would make a journey but the journey on Earth would have to exactly match me that was that we could see in heaven right all right now it didn't show us in heaven in partial realization are you listening yes I want the plot I want this thought in mind when we talked about being in heaven all of those services none of that was in partial realization God didn't write now to listen to the point now don't misunderstand me God didn't write about in the book about the the things of life you only see the Lamb's Book of Life the book of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world to be exactly what we're reading see it doesn't show life on Earth it shows a finished Complete product positive already done morning stars sing together sons of God shouting for joy about the Plan of Redemption not that would take place on Earth but that was a reality of real right but now is I tried to preach back a few years ago on a message called matching pieces and if you want to go back into computer you can run across it and pull up the older services and get it and my point then was the same as it is now when a Time Came Upon the Earth that a man was needed Martin Luther came on the Earth right right man I wouldn't have Hazard time or doings and as it did then he began to preach to serve God it's like John Wesley he believed Luther's message and he came to America to convert the Indians missionary enough but when he got over here he ran into the moravians or how you pronounced that word and he uh he ran into those people and you know they taught him the way of sanctification right but you know their message of sanctification never turned the world upside down all right because God was waiting on Martin was waiting on John Wesley just as he's waiting on Martin Luther right right A lot of people protested the Catholic Church before Martin Luther ever did but yet they was not the man of God to fit the Bible that said would take place right all right see then here comes the man with the message inheritance starts rejoicing but see it wasn't necessarily written even of Martin Luther John Wesley Pentecost Etc it was showing the end of all things and that was the point I was trying to get you to see in in the messages back there about what I'm talking about matching pieces years ago and also where I just got through preaching about uh the things taking place in heaven all of that is a positive complete finished product right but see we're down here on Earth now because it was a time that had to come to Earth and then we have to live here what was that right you see God was waiting as I said on a man named Martin Luther to come up to a place and preached and done all kind of things but then all at once he struck the just shall live by faith well that was the positive of Luther's message right right and that was what God was waiting on Amen was that man to step out there he had been spoken in the Bible about a lot of you were coming in time all right right you see that couldn't take place it could do in in Elijah and Elisha and John the Baptist but it couldn't be the Elijah of Malachi 4. but see one day that scripture became a reality on Earth amen right when that positive came to Earth and struck in a man's heart then he could start the message right right you know and Proclaim this end time message all right so then God was waiting he's been waiting on a bride to come in the end time to be able to take that message and no matter what goes on out there or anywhere and she just keeps going right on down the road right man why because she's predestinated this is your day and you're our church when are we going to believe it that way right and when are we going to get out of our negativisms of oh well you know look out there and see this and do that no when we're going to get down to reality of what the Bible says right of Who We Are it's fine to talk about brother Adam was a prophet that's wonderful and there's people still accepting that you know you know coming into the Nations you believe in it that's fine but what about those who have been in the message a long time are we still just running around and around Mount Horeb of God sent a prophet God sent a prophet or is it time to go into the promised land right right see which way is it all right now see matching pieces in other words to look at something dire and see it here now not just to see it in partial realization that's get my point now there has to be an end time people there was a time that uh that you mentioned that we believe right around was a prophet but it's time to get into what the prophet had to say and it's about crucifying men that's right I mean you know they're just about ready to Stone you because you was out of the message the message was God said the prophet when I believe that and I believe it's unfolding I like Christ The Mystery of God revealed would run around and said that how the mystery had unfolded itself down to the present hour he said that we're living right was it the message is unfolded now it's down to the bride amen amen and the bride realizing who she is all right that's what's matching up in heaven because it didn't say in heaven when the messenger of Malachi 4 begins to shout you know the morning starts singing together he's part of it because he part of the body of Christ amen would you get my point yes yes it doesn't even say in the Bible that the prophet of God is for the perfecting of the Saints right that's right right it says the fivefold ministry is now without the message to be brought what would we have to bring that's right right so everybody's in the right place right Glory Hallelujah get ready against the day but now trying to see our part of the journey that could bring us not to a partial realization but to bring us to a positive attitude right bringing it down to a perfect realization that we can see the day that we're living Prophet preached that message from what recognizing your day in his message as I said this morning now the Bible says to believe in your heart invest with your mouth right right you believe in the heart don't say it with a mouth no good right right that's right say it with a mouth don't really believe in the heart no good all right when I show isn't in here that we get down to see recognizing your day amen and it's message and we know the message right God has sent us the message by the prophet right but do you recognize today that we're living come on well things are just getting so bad what do you think it's supposed to be I mean you expected to get better um I remember years ago here in the prophet make a statement and it was outstanding to me because he said you put a George Washington Abraham Lincoln in every office in this country that's right and can't pull it out right amen now they run a long time with George Washington the Abraham Lincoln and them keeping it fairly straight right but he said you put one in every office in other words you realize that every office you'd go to to pay you taxes to to do you this to go to that the judges and the Supreme Court and everybody in the Congress and the Senate and every one of them George Washington and Abraham Lincoln you said you can't believe he saw that it was gone and then you couldn't do it you said yeah but we just had two or three of them what good would it do you know would it be nice to be able to to the next election for governor we said we're going to let George Washington for Governor State of Georgia well what good would that do you wouldn't change nothing but you see Church we're in the time when it's becoming to the position listen this is my whole point of the evening we're coming to the place I believe that we're matching what was in heaven written about us amen now if not when we're going to come to it that's right 40 more years most of us ain't gonna be here that's right right language some of us might be here but we're going to have to be rolled in by wheelchair all right well when are we going to start saying what it is right it doesn't matter to me who's president of the United States I don't vote for nothing why could've found out about the last time I tried to vote I voted Catholic in office no 1964 somewhere about there when we voted Kennedy again I ain't voted Simpson on the presidential election I'm telling you not to I'm just telling you where I stand right right well what good is it amen what good is it what does it do well I tried well amen you ain't go to no good don't worry about it go on vote do what you want to but just to remember one thing the Bible says I put in Kings and I take out peace now if you can't see that little statement in John F Kennedy now I'm not against anyone I'm not against anyone but when the machines put him in office right if you can't see that God done that crook but he just allowed them to do it right because he wanted the man in there right we got the man in there we're supposed to have and we go for the next election without a woman supposed time that's right you say praise God remember who he is he's going to do what he's supposed to do that's right amen you're putting Putin back and what's his name back in over in Russia and he's very happy you know he's very tough well to what brother Ron said we got a bomb like what coming from there but see church I'm just trying to talk to you about this look at life and we can see I remember way back when running around him was I was reading one day and we was talking about it that he said watch when Russia come down after that oil well they're over after you when you see Jerusalem compassion I don't ever sound we're over there just goes everybody else we over fight for oil like everybody else finds role so what does it matter it's not that it's whether or not we're prepared for a Rapture that's it amen you know it's our matching pieces it's not the government who's doing what it's whether or not we can match the word of God right when I'm getting paid the other day where he said that this bride will prove to Satan that she won't fall like Eve well you know what somebody ain't gonna prove it to him why not we contend we're part of it amen and start saying it all right and we talked about in the message when we were talking of the writing of the Bible that uh what was taking place on Earth is written actually in the Bible right right now being written in the Bible it has a lot of things the Bible is a wonderful book and it's taught man how to put shifts into space because they told him where the day missing was that they found out it was by their own doings is the answer to all things it tells you how to do everything right written in the Bible because it's a wonderful book right then when we get to this place of looking at it that that you know Daniel says books Revelation says books all right this Bible has got many things in it it's many books because it's a book of life of mankind upon the Earth it gives you as a selfie then it gives you so much so you can get a record of you know and come all the way down through Who belongs to who when it's a record book it tells you about where you are where you came from born in sin Shepherd and iniquity spouse your mother's womb alive tells you all about life in one book but the reason it's called books is because it's just one book but it's got many sections of that book right that deals with the natural life and then it tells you about how to become into other parts of life and then it tells you about the Lamb's Book of Life all in one book it's a record it won't have to be books piled up and quiet throne it won't even really be a King James version now if you think it is that's not exactly what he's talking about you are the book you're the one that will be sitting on the throne with him and sitting there you'll be the book you won't have to turn into pages and find somebody's name you'll be the book ER written officials remember how he was trying to bring it out but in that I kind of just left a little bit that I I want you to think about let's just read a little bit what wrote around had to say now remember what I'm talking about is one book with many sections of it and it's called The Book of Life all right it's natural life Now Catch the middle it is a it will show a an area in between then it will show spiritual life all in the same Bible you don't have to be books laying out to be read from so listen to what you probably had to say on the invisible Union of the bride of Christ number one see then he's coming down talking about the bride and she's part of the you know part of the bridegroom and always but here's what he said here it brings into view the two books because this invisible Union was preached after the church age book was putting out now he put a put out uh so you'll read it in here the two boats is going to be mysterious when you read the book of The Seven Church ages the two books book of life said said one says you can put your name on it you never you never comes off other one says you take his name out of The Book of Life this brings it perfectly in Beauty right here I'm going to stop a few minutes and get this and and we'll catch up it's one two books there's going to be mysterious now yet it's not two books we'll read that on down here in just a minute it's one book right but with many sections of the same book to be able to come forward all right now when we get to the end because that's the point we want to do go ahead to the next one that was paragraph 205 we're going to 206. life is a sacred thing to God and it's recorded in the book not at the author of Life do you believe that congregation division our natural out here we have is just a perversion it really should be the right life to begin with but it's perverted by the natural word the first life or your first Union you were joined in Birth by Nature a natural act a human being associated man and woman together Associated together in sex so far which brought your first life and that's associated with sin and death and he said I don't see how you could miss seeing it but look what he said life is sacred God keeps a record right you've heard the prophet say that when you come up in an age and got to the age of accountability that God put a record on he said not much is written in your first part of your life but since then things begin to be recorded all right if we don't repent we're gonna have to face that but if we repent as Christians and get our slate cleaned as we'll cover in a little while all right but then as Christians it don't give us a right and just go out and do like we want to there's still records man that we've got to repent but if we don't he said well what do you mean you tell them how clean by the blood then you're telling me I'm not clean you're not cleaning to do anything you want to all right man my heaven what would that be all right so what's what he says now once you can get to the book now so go ahead with number two because all of that was number one this is from works is Faith expressed just like last night sneaking when you get the book you're going to see maybe a little confusion that I don't want to say it the two books of life it's the same book but one of them is your natural birth the other one is your spiritual book one leads out through the other one Now record that in your mind one of them is your natural birth it's in the Bible all right the other one is your spiritual birth now you remember let me say this word to clear up that part you remember brother Branham said arm and Neville's not written in the book but said what happened when Arman Neville was here is written in the book he said thereby that puts arm and Neville in the book now do you need that quote the Army Neville is not written in the Bible all right all right then what is it it's the writing in the Bible now that's both two good things one of them is the natural things that would tell us a day and the hour that Arma Neville would be living which would be of the world and the events of the world and what would be taking place but the other one is talking about him in a spiritual extent right I'm coming into the message I or believing the prophet walking there in all right so then it's right don't hold that point now just just keep on what we're going now and look at the next one if you're reading that way then we'll do it this is invisible Union paragraph 308 there is your name on The Book of Life The Book of Life is a word of God no the word is God and God is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible became on Word and if you're here to do that won't it vindicate that word your name was written in the Bible it's not written in there Richard Addison Samuel Gale Armand Neville is written in the Bible what will take place and the hour that we're living we're living where that the Bible said when the towers fall that's right right see that couldn't be written before that could be speaking of no other age but this age they had the Richard Nixon and the things you know and the Watergate when you go back in the Bible and find the word Watergate and you'll find that they found some scriptures and things that they hadn't read and they stood before the Watergate that was no accident that's the day we're living right right amen if we could find it and really know what it is we'd know exactly the day and the hour but God's withholds those things from us but look at the things of what it's showing me two books he says right when the church age book came out we're going to read that in a minute I gave you the pages to read and ask you to read them on that it's about 262 to 280 in the church age book with the Bible is the book that you're talking about as I said then the Bible is living people so it won't have to be books but see what I want the title or what you're talking about the books we read in Revelation and we're written Daniel 2. the books were opened right and in Revelation you'll find that if your name was not written in the lounge Book of Life you got a problem you see it's written in the natural writing of the book I mean see then what is it with the next one on communion communion 1965 1212 paragraph 44. live in the book here in the spot there we was talking about the the two books being one The Book of Life the First Book of Life coming up was when you were born that was your natural birth but then one time way back down in there there was a little grain of wheat grain of life as I was explaining to some of the young sisters this afternoon then he goes into explaining what the book Lamb's Book of Life it's not on downstairs they're saying that's what he's explaining he's explaining two books but it's not two books all right nobody understands not two books it's one book but it's two sections or many sections of one book but they're open now there was years and that's when I held off from saying back there and I just speak you know I just had enough time to cover that service about the writing of the Bible but now in this day we're not interested in the writing of the Bible didn't quite like that means you're asleep are you thinking just getting chicken house when there's real sick you know you can always tell you just go whistle just a little all the chicken and get real quiet get that stick in here so you knew the chickens were sick so if I hear you snow or no no you're not I'm not listening all right what are you thinking we're not in the days of the writing we're in the days of the open book amen our part has been written that's right right it's been written about us yes you read East Church age right right and you write that there's good things and there's bad things right the lady will see you you're right it's good then you write a lot of bad you know it's written all right it's there about us but we're not in the days of the writing of the Bible right now here's brother Brown let's put him in there he said they could write another book of Acts behind this group of people right he said that this won't be nobody there to read it no come on do we're not in the days of the writing of the book amen now if you understand that I'll repeat it again so if anybody will tell you don't understand my language in ways it tells in the Bible or the beginning and the end of mankind so it's written in there but I'm not concerned about what the world is of today that's what you hear preachers they preach about all of these things Illuminati's I mean it was called Illuminati was super rich now it's all of these other things and you hear sermons after sermons about the these things what good is that going to do is that going to put us in the rapture now I want to hear about Jesus Christ well what do you mean when I preach Jesus you better back up because you just exposed yourself to think that you preached Jesus you think you've exalted the revelation of Jesus that's where you get enough trouble with it but listen we're in a day of the open book because that's also written in the Bible we're not going to the white Throne now we're going to sit with him on the throne as my red Daniel because it said be thousands of thousands sitting on the throne you know and then there'll be a thousand times thousand there what it was would be standing before it's told about where we're going to be we're going to sit on the throne with him judging others so don't this get even tied up in your mind of what I'm saying get what I'm trying to say you you always I used to when I was in school I I love to read but I didn't have enough time because we had everything else to do you know we was working we were flat on you and I wasn't seven years old from sun up to sundown so we didn't have time to let school to do a lot of work so what I would do is I'd just take the little introduction in the inside and I turn over to the back to make sure and I got all the names running correctly or something and you know and I just write my own story and I guess the school teacher knew that and she said well he's using his brain more than he would if he'd read the book you know because see I wasn't interested in what was in between I was interested in the last page well you know what I love about the Bible is the last page we're in a time of the opening of that book that has been written so we come to find out it's not a book it's not something like this it's people it's right right even though it may be a Judas a pharaoh or a Hitler or a Mussolini or whatever you know this is just a Earthly record that's right I'm not talking about opening this book at the white throne the judge out of it I'm talking about the ones that sitting on the throne right would it be something to where that you could you could kind of argue you know about get you a good lawyer in your defense but then you found you guilty of killing somebody well then you go up there and you start to start saying something you look up and dirty things and not much argument going to be at the white Throne judgment that's right because you're going to see those you sinned against well because they're the book that I'm talking about they are the book you know you following me they're in the book but it doesn't give me eternal life just causing sound even Jesus said to Judas during Luke said go Rejoice at the demons and things like that it's something to you he said Rejoice that your name is written in heaven and Judas was there we get time we'll get back to that in a minute judas's name was written there but I want to get this point to you we're in the days of the open book right see everybody coming along you know and they're being a message about three months and they read about they read a little bit in the seal book and you know and this that and the other and they say boy sets them seals broke the Bible become a brand new book man he read the silver all the way through and yet they know all about a brand new book right we used to be in a certain Church brother Thomas can probably remember who it was but you've been in the message a little while like me and he'd hurt a few tapes and he heard brother random say I take every spirit in here under my control my brother get up to church you don't need to see I take every spirit in here under my control and I thought landlord around was standing in place when he said today it wasn't just words out of his mouth he had control of what was in the building you know he had that part all right but now listen we're in the days of the open book I thought we believed that this end time message was the revelation of Jesus Christ is that not true amen this message is the revelation of Jesus Christ well we're not in the days with the writing of the book we're the days of the open book and by being an open book now listen I hope you follow me Martin Luther could read this book and have a great understanding you preach a lot of things but do you think that Martin Luther understood that he was the very messenger the Bible spoken of do you think he turned the world upside down by preaching it but what if a man could have realized he was the one that was spoken of in the field Church age come on you following me see it was never until now that we could talk about an open book it's never until the end time you could talk about a book being opened when that Prophet preached those seals now listen what I'm saying he said the book became a brand new book you know that he never preached anything after then that he didn't relate back to the seals he said marriage and divorce was revealed to see them he said serpent city was revealed and see that's 58 when he preached it see nothing wasn't added it has to come a time to you and I that you can't anything else be added because the book now is open I swear that I don't have anything to hide I want to live an open book I want you to speak me and be open before you well because we're in the time of the open book because it's what it said in Daniel's in Revelations he said and the books were opened see the only way you can find your name written in the last book of life is for that book to be open to where you can read it God knows I'm just trying to make illustrations right all right do you think they understood about their names being written in the Lamb's Book of Life you think they understood about an eternal section of the book you think anybody down through time really understood those things until the prophet came see now it's an open book when the seals open to me they're in 1979 they began to open it run on into room it took on into 1981 and 82. then was when the Bible become a brand new book to me it didn't become a new book you didn't hear me say s it's a new book in 68 69 70. no just when God broke the seals to me I began to see then the Bible become a brand new book you know what it became an open book an open book remember I said John saw his name now what did they say John did he see even his life upon Earth remember in the lounge Book of Life we covered it back there that it's not Samuel Dale that's written in the Lamb's Book of Life you know the Eternal section remember it's my real name before I got here I can find Samuel in the Bible but that don't make me there but when I see through an open book and I find the day that I'm living and I see the hour that we're living right my name in the book the set of an arm and Neville what's going on in his day naturally we see all around the world we see what's going on right we can study about The Towers falling and we can say look at the Irish run in there but how much more do you hear about what happened read that word says about the time we're falling he said in that day the light off the sun would be seven times brighter and said the light of the Moon would be as the light of the Sun now that's talking about the bride of Christ in Jesus Christ Living in her right you don't hear that talked about you hear it talked about Powers falling or something well we're here look what the prophet said they Commander all over here look at all around the world let's take a play boy here no is the book open to you is this Bible become an open book yeah brother Reid when he saw what I had in mind he wanted my book because anywhere the prophet explains something and I can find I write it in there right at that scripture and then you questioned me about something I can just say look they all used to like about it because I gave my old Bible to Josh and uh we get Bible studying and they just asked a question about something and and they'd say well Josh you can't read it because you've got the cheater book he had the book that had the answers written on the side of the page we don't want to believe this message I'd like to know what runaround said about the scriptures right all right you shall ain't writing in my Bible it's too holy well that's all right it's your Bible so you do what you won't do this is mine all right all right see if I want to know something about something I just turned in there and see but you don't run around and explain that page 243 to see a book he talked about David dancing before the Lord you know I like that because the book's open to me you know I can't read them until I open the pages if this message has not opened the Bible where are we going that's right who are we going to follow what is the to follow all right this message has given us the answer to all things all right this message is the open book amen it explains everything see then what are we doing natural life is written in the book spiritual life is written in the book now how many will you agree on this statement we had to realize we're Sinners for it could be saved you agree amen right now what brought our attention that we were sinners come on is it not that we either read in the book you know the Bible or somebody preached it to him right right most of the time it's because somebody preached it to us right it's very rare that we read in the book ourselves now that we're a sinner we found out by somebody preached it we found out by somebody that was actually part of the book right but you see the Books open now that was what I was going to preach this morning and Lord James at about eight o'clock this morning give me what I brought so I hope you believe it was him but you know but we're in the days of the open book that's right anything you need to know that brought around and said is in the message or else we don't need to know it is that wrong enough what we don't what we need to know brother random told us what we don't need to know that's right he said these things in her eyes I wonder about will it be children born in the millennium but what about it is the book open to you now here's what most people do with opening a book okay I hope you got this on the video this is what most people do with the opening of the book out goes the book right now they got their own ideas they're writing the book now that's not according to the book right right anything we bring better be coming out of here right if it's not coming out of here how do you know whether it's right or not right who are you following me yeah amen the books were opened we now can go to the Bible and find our natural lives and find their history find the days we're living we can find The Towers falling we can find the things that are taking place we can find all the things the Bible spoke of that's right but can we find ourselves see that was the writing of the Bible and I didn't get to this now open the book is opened waiting on somebody to find her name in it come on and find the truth of it all right see let's go on a little bit you know in the Bible we like to read we talk about David given the bear a lion and a giant we enjoy that don't but how about it when it says that he took Bathsheba from Uriah we don't want to talk about that but you know that's in the book what about Abraham and believe in God we love to talk about that in this journey but what about giving his wife a welcome you know a couple of times we don't want to talk about that you know that the Bible also says about David and all of his doing that he was the outcome of God's eye right and David even himself said blessed is the man and God will not repute sin there must have been more to it than just writing of letters on the page you remember when we were looking at it while ago I won't ask him to pull it back up because I told you to remind me write it in right around said one of them leads out to the other you remember that statement yes two books a book no only one book with two sections one leads out to the other one in other words one shows your natural Journey as it starts and it leads all the way unto the finish of the spiritual journey right right all right now if that be true then one part of the book will lead out to the other part of the book and in one part of the book we see what we do huh the other part of the book we see that our old record is destroyed both in the same book yeah but you see now listen to what I'm talking about you can open the pages and read about our lives and what we're you know the doings but if that book is not open you can't see your old life is destroyed come on you see what I'm talking about an open book yes we say what somebody else says we say the prophet said our old record is gone right right that's wonderful if it's true that's right and it is for somebody right but what about me and you right if the book's not open you can't see it's your records destroyed you're just saying what somebody else saying somebody I've seen it see somebody says your record's destroyed and you're just saying what they say no man can call Jesus the Christ come on he accepted me by the Holy Ghost the prophet said you can stop for drunk going down the street and he'll say Jesus is a Christ he said that don't mean he knows what he's talking about the book is open you know that Jesus is the Christ amen are you listening when the book is opened you realize there is just one true and living God when the book is open you realize all the great things that are revealed are in you see yourself when the book opens it's when you see yourself that's true now let me quote again what wrote around he said John must have seen his name written now listen see if it's not close to the same paragraph he said when the seal broke to him yes when the seal broke to John he saw his name written you wouldn't rotten John out there you don't see that's right he's always said when the seals break to you you see who you are and I said break not to read it not to quote what somebody else says right I read from and you know what I've done and I've told you about it reading six books a day and two tapes one to work one back and read all of that at home all day at work but you know in 1979 I couldn't understand how that profit what it would be and I could tell you almost all that he said in the seal book because I've read it so many times I was working a job that it took two people to run the day I was out it was so fast and the Lord spoke to me it always been concerned how did that Prophet know that that white horse rider was the Holy Ghost when he taught all of his life up until the time that it was the I mean it was the Antichrist that what how he was the answer when he taught all the way up to his life that it was the Holy Ghost what happened to the man what happened to brother Brown well they ain't gonna stole him glad you said that brother Randall said the angel tell him something he said he spent the rest of the day checking it out in the Bible go read the rest of the message did he take what the angel said he wrote down he went home and studied it in the Bible I always wondered you know how in the world was it just the words of an Angel run around and tell me that it was just a words of an angel that you're taking we're built on the work of an Angel what if that angel was the deceiving angel no no brother damn you brother well let's go on forget it Duo none went too far you see I questioned well how did that Prophet know and there while I was running that job just like that said the way he knew was because there's just one God right he said here stands one with a lamb with a book in his hand and dark goals the white horse rider he said thereby that's got to be the Antichrist even though he had taught it as being Jesus Christ he's seen it couldn't be why because you got two people in the Bible one of them's got to be the devil there's no such thing as two people in God right that's why I fight all these two Lords and River Jordans and all those doctrines you try to take it out of your mind in some way because the two people in the Bible one of them's the devil because God can't be two people right he's just one well now that's just the way you sit man ain't where I see it it's what the Bible says amen all right man so I said okay I wrote it down on a sheet of paper the old manifest things that we used to follow I wrote down here stand to the Lamb with a book in his name there goes a white horse rider so thereby's got to be the Antichrist I came home and I got my Superbook and I turned where that page was of course I could quote it in memory then because that's what I was standing there doing the rest of the day I said Lord thank you I know what it is because in the rest of the day them Wheels was turning I could quote 10 pages I could talk to you and in my mind it was saying look at that other fella going out look at that other guy go read you see a book now in firstly about 1 58. in read a while we'll see it around it says that other fella riding all that other guy there's two guys one of them's the devil we'll see then I Knew by revelation how that first seal was broke because that's what broke it to me was a revelation then the Bible became a brand new book you've run around come along and he make a statement he said one seal will tie the entire Bible together God showed me that you can take one seal and tie the Bible together from Genesis to Revelation if it don't you Prophet was wrong see it become an open book has it become an open book to you or is that just a quote from Brother Dale come on I got enough sense to realize that right A lot of people say look look at that there's a white horse rider and there goes the other guy that could be a quote from Brother Dale come on just exactly like no man can call Jesus of Christ accepted me by the Holy Ghost you're saying what somebody else says has it been revealed to you about one God what do you think I preached so much about one God you take right around this message and it's magic confusing until the Holy Spirit reveals but once it's revealed it could be say no said no other way than the way he said it that's right come on let's get down to one more than you said I love this one I'm about to touch that part of it get over to number seven brother which is paragraph 223 invisible Union 65 11 25. should be number seven let me double check at the back here on my notes go find it to me now your old book is gone with your old union now your name and your old in your has been deal that's why I want to transfer you know you've been transferred now what does the word transferred mean or transfer to go from one place to another take this book and transfer it the Bible to from this corner to that corner I just transferred it right now what is brother I'm talking about I can take that right there and prove that he's false prophet and I'm standing here and say he knows exactly what he's talking about he wouldn't fall he said well how can you talked about it being fought if it's transferred how many times did your Prophet say they got a song now that says a new name was written in heaven and it's mine he said pretty good words but said bad revelation he said cause there ain't no such thing as a name being written in the Lamb's Book of Life now all right he said it was written before the world right or it was never written right amen now if transferred means it was taken from one and put in another did you add a name was it right a blank space over here and a name over here and you took it put it in that blank space did you take it from The Book of Life and put it in the Lamb's Book of Life come on then it wasn't there to start with that's right you see that's why I love to preach we didn't meet one time and I asked a question this man got it behind me because nobody couldn't answer the question I'm honest it happened nothing's exalting me I just asked a question they didn't know the answer now I got it behind me he said I hate it when a man asked a question he's the only one in the building got to answer it I said I wouldn't ask a question if I hadn't had the answer I wasn't making sarcastic and I'm not making sarcastic now I'm just telling it like it is I like to preach when you can put it up on the board in front of people say your Prophet said your name was transferred now what does he mean because according to our terminologies it means taking it from one place and putting it in another one right right which means it's in this place but not in this place oh my right come on am I right see I believe you're prophet he knows exactly what he's talking about that's right amen and what else could he say to hide it from the wise and prove it amen he said Your name's been transferred yeah you know that hit it from the theologians from everybody except those who God reveals it to him so you see it it's not transferring like because your name is here and you move it over here that's not what it is it's when the book opens now we're getting they want to go when the book opens you can know then that your old book is gone it is in the sea of his forgetfulness so then transferred is not taking it out of the old book and rewriting it in the new that's not what he's talking about study the message he's talking about the Plan of Redemption so what is it then it's the Revelation amen that your name is no longer in the old book and it has been cleaned and gone with your old Union and now you see it in the lounge book life right not transferred like our word transferred not to take it out put it over here but when we find out mine open books that's it that our old life is gone that's right then we can look over into the book of life and see there it is it was written there before the foundation of the world you wouldn't transferred over there God revised rely on a prophet to say it where it would hide it right go study the message he's talking about doing away with your own life your whole Union you were married to Adam right no Union and then you found out where your name was really at right when the seal broke John saw his name nurse when the Bible becomes a new book when the seals break off of it not when you read to see a book right I'm trying to tell you that I tried to illustrate it I probably read that seal book between the time of 66 that I heard of the message and began to read until 79 I I don't tell him how many times I had read that chill book but then one day the prophet opened it you say the prophet his words did right right because it cannot be said any other way his words opened it his words opened the invisible Union of the bride of Christ that I could see my name written in the lounge book of life eternal section and I knew then it had to be somewhere brought to that place now let's take one second when I came to Earth I was dealing in the old book would you right all right the books would you know that brother Randall say that your name even goes on the book as a Believer it's sanctification you need those quotes he said well wait a minute he said judas's name was written in heaven if you read that church age book of where I gave it to you you'll hear all of this then what happened is there a blank space on the Lamb's Book of Life and then your name was written there no it's rotten apart to run around the set of a religious order do I say he said Judas was a part of it he said all the foolish virgins and things were the part of a religious order and he said your name goes on the book as a Believer under the religious order he's not talking about the lamb Book of Life he's either put on there before the foundational world I never will be put down right he's talking about a religious order of a book right your name goes on at sanctification yes oh that's what happened to Judas he said oh no I don't know what's your Prophet to you you see it was always on the lounge Book of Life but what you got to do to clean up all the old record before you can realize and the book's kind of open that's right the book's got to open to you to realize your life is gone and once it opens and you can see that old self is gone that's right now you will never come until you're changed to see all gone away from you so don't even record that in your brain I'm not talking about we're going to become goody goodies no we're going to be batty Baddies the prophet said you'd be a sticker until the change came that's right that's right because I'm not talking to something I'm talking about a revelation that's where people go out and they try to show people of the world and the first thing they want to show them is marriage and divorce to try to win them into this message and that's something you can't do that put them on one God put him in the church let them start reading on one God didn't begin to realize yes but stand together think about it 561 Redbook 961 of the red book 61 61 in the red book think on these things have you seen that your name is not in the old records you're born again the soul of that individual is not on any record is pure it's become an open book the revelation of this message has brought us to the place of an open book but if we're still living like the devil under the old nature blaming our name we are deceived right now we're human I just got to say that we're human we're subject to human times we're subject to life and Humanity but I mean yielding ourselves to those things and become a garbage can then the book's not open an open book to where I can read it I don't have to listen to what somebody else says about it I can read from Sam does that do away with teachers in the body and all that puts them in the right place because thank God for the thoughtful and Ministry to bring us the word let's say this is dare not trust the sweetest friend how we feel on Earth the record when we see our old life destroying new eyes is she exactly what happened what's not your name not Samuel Dale he said it's the name gonna say my name is transferred I look I look again it is there on the left that's our lives under Samuel Dale is gone that's what Britain is this alone age he's Young alone sing again I'm a new creation father might be a whole lot of company about a lord have to bring this out Matthew didn't know until I got to kill you already every interview
