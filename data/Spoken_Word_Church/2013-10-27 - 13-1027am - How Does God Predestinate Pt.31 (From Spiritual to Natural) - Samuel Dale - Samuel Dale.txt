coming saturday come and be with us we have a good time fellowshipping together and just sitting around but make sure you bring your coat and hat because it'll be cold probably a lot of activities for the kids we've got a lot of activities for the kids as a matter of fact we're going to have a shootout for the kids we're going to have a pink bb gun for the girls to use you know now and we're going to have a black and i guess or something for the boys to use now it's not shooting at each other okay don't get that idea we we will have some little target practice and see who can shoot the best and all like that and have a good time doing it we always have a i can't walk yeah we're going to have a cakewalk but now you to participate in it this is not one of them where you make money out of it and everything but call we don't do nothing like that but you know make a cake and we'll have a cake walk and give away the cakes and all but to do you got to you know you got to make it it's we don't we don't care much about store store-bought stuff you know that's the last resort yeah and they make some good ones out there but you know we want the sisters to make them and then everybody can eat

love you and we ask you to just have your way with each one of us and father come and be with us this morning in the opening of thy word because that's what we desire more than anything we ask you to just have your way and let your light shine to each one and lord forgive us of our sins cleanse us lord from all unrighteousness take away the thoughts of our mind the meditations that are contrary to you and lord cleanse our eyes and our seeing our being and all that we are to be what you want us to be we love you and we thank you as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts we committed to you now in jesus name amen romans 8 we've been reading that because we're still talking about how does god predestinate and we're getting now down to life on earth right right okay some of you that are away this coming saturday uh we invite you to come and you know sign up and you can spend the night with somebody saturday night you don't have to drive back home okay but go downstairs and just ride on the sheets you know there need a place to stay and whatever put it on the side where the writing is not there and if you need a place to stay and to some that wants to say we'll take care of somebody write that down and that way we can you know you won't have to drive back home is the point for you know being late getting through all right romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified what them he also glorified so when god it's all over with we're not over with you right but what do we say to that what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us it's not over with but we sure don't have to worry about it you know everything's right on time okay we'll go to genesis 4 and we'll read about the first 10 verses because this is where our thought will be taken from and adam you eve his wife and she conceived and barking and said i have gotten a man from the lord and see again by his brother abel and abel was a keeper of the sheep became was a tiller of the ground in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the lord and abe lost abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but in the cane and to his offering he had not respect mccain was very wroth and his countenance failed the lord said unto cain why aren't thy wrath and why is thy countenance fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin light at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thy shall rule over him and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to ice when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not i know not am i my brother's keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood cried out unto me from the ground amen you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word amen now i said we're speaking on predestination or how does god predestinate and we know that he predestinates by foreknowledge all right now foreknowledge is what the ability for god to look down through and see what would happen on earth and then he would predestinate or set the destiny for what would be so we spent quite a time back up in the eternities and we've come down now to get to the earthly situation and we're looking in the garden and seeing what happened and that was why i wanted wade to take this past wednesday because uh you know i wanted to try to get it today where everybody would be here more to understand and especially the newer ones to that we would try today uh this morning this afternoon we're going to be basically dealing with a lot of the scriptures and talking about the things to to try to get a better understanding of the uh you know the situation you say well we understand what happened well that's that's all right uh but we we need a revelation that's what we need more than anything and uh you know in getting everything set in order to where we can understand now but we've we've seen that the fall of man that eve first fell for satan's lie in her second realm of reasoning imaginations etc and it perverted her senses her reasonings and things you know and all got involved and no matter what you call it this is to the people on the internet where they get all jumbled up about the the uh before and after of brother branham and the way he's talking of the like in the early ministry he would say body soul spirit and then in life standing up he would say body spirit and soul but he never changed the essence of what he was talking about so he didn't have to correct it because he always gave the first rim of man which is see tastes filled and smelling here he always gave that as the outside man the second realm of man is memory reason conscience affections etc and he always called that the second rim no matter whether he would call it soul or spirit but he'd always would call the center part the center of man you know would be the part where that you know it it has only one sense it's either faith or doubt so then that way it doesn't matter what is called a wording is you get the point of what's being said because i've told you you go through it and check it out take your concordance and run the word spirit or run the word soul and and you can't run the scriptures to find out a lot of what that's talking about because it'll interrelate the same word backwards and forth you know all right and as it does see the the only way you can tell what is being talked about is get the text is in get what it's doing and then you can understand what's being said because it'll describe it especially when you remember if it's something about see taste fill smell in here you don't want to put that in the soul do you no that's not there that's this outside part of us then if it's memory reason conscience affections we don't put that as the center controlling factor of all of us we put that as the second realm of mankind all right then the center realm of mankind is either faith or doubt we're either born again or we're not born again that's right see the new birth is not in your body the new birth is not in your spirit you know it's in that inner part of you that we call the soul all right and the bible doesn't say that the spirit that sinners shall die says the soul that sinneth that's right the soul is the center part of us the part that makes us operate and makes us different than an animal remember what we've been going through the animals don't have a soul right but yet they have a uh sea taste field smelling here part of them they have a certain amount which is controlled of memory reason conscious affections etc they have those things in the animal realm all right but they don't have that soul part or center part to be able to change and be different and all they just keep building their nests the same way you know they keep doing the same things that they were doing four thousand six thousand years ago you know because it shows the soul of man is what god is dealing with all right the center part if you want to call it spirit in early ministry fine that's all right just get your senses lined up get the center part of you as to be either faith or doubt all right now we got it lined up there's no problem with with comprehending of what's being done because eve begin to reason all right as the devil began to talk to eve using the beast all right he began to talk to eve now we read during the bible where it says about the third chapter that the uh serpent was the most subtle of all beasts well there's a difference in a beast in a serpent a serpent is like a snake but a beast is an upright creature all right so you're reading your bible sensibly to understand what made him a snake was it not the curse that was put on and set upon thy belly shall thou go and thus shall be thou well evidently must have been some other form all right even scofield in his footnotes has references to this you know of a great man like that to have a comprehension of you know seeing that there was a difference all right now in doing that then we look at it as seeing what would happen in the garden all right we all agree to one thing or should be you know basically religious realms would agree to one point i'm talking about the basics of all christianity would be that it was unbelief in the garden unbelief because there's no sin but unbelief he that sinneth not see he that believeth not is condemned already if you don't believe you're just an unbeliever right now that has to be categorized or placed in an order to think about it because you know here we are today as human beings that we do sin but what is the sin that we sin is it drinking gambling smoking running around with women adultery etc no christians don't do that that's right amen all right does that solve the problem but what do we do we do as mankind you know we we doubt god's word and that is to what that is the point that that the serpent which would be representative of the devil what he's referred to all the way through the bible is the serpent over in revelation he talks about the devil the serpent and all et cetera because he's referred to as the serpent that's why it's called the seed of the serpent it's not called the seed of the beast it's called seed of the serpent why because the serpent even though he used the beast we'll get back to it a little bit but he had no seed of his own the serpent had no seed whatsoever the devil doesn't have a seed to plant he's not a human being he's not in that form a realm but he has an ability to pervert all right that's right so then as he perverts he starts in our thinking all right all sin starts from thinking all right we start thinking about something we start reasoning about it you say but i'm not an unbeliever brother dale i'm not talking about drinking gambling smoking because that's not sin he said what is the minute it's not no that's unbelief if you're a believer you don't do that right but yet we're all human beings and can be tempted in every way and we have to be careful with that because we can be no matter whether you're 90 or 16 you you got problems you're human beings living in a world really i say 90. you still think you might have alzheimer's but still thinking and most of the time you're thinking about the wrong thing you agree because that's the devil's inroad we have tried to cover what has taken had taken place there in the garden see satan goes through this mind we talk about brain he goes through and he contacts us to our memory reason conscious affection all right he said well you mean the doubt well now let me put it on the other side you know that god has to use those same senses to speak to you so you know you back well i'm not boy he don't get my you're already he's already got you he even talked to jesus right he tried to tempt him with everything right and if he tried to tempt him with it he wouldn't have come to him and told him to turn these stones into bread if jesus just got to eating about 40 days of good fat meals when he waits 40 days until he gets hungry so he can contact him all right now then think about it satan uses those senses through your mind hearing faith comes by hearing hearing by the word all right but satan uses the same senses that god uses to contact us and i wish that that i could say that all of my senses are really controlled by god i wish i could say that but i'd be the biggest liar in the building right and then i'd tell you you're the biggest liar in the building all right i'd be like jack cole was when that lady told him said brother cole said i i just can't help but talk that i can't help it said i carry tails and do things and said i want to just lay my tongue on the altar he said ma'am that this alder is only 14 foot long so there's not enough room for your tongue right now he was pretty blunt it was back in the in the pentecostal movement jack cole you know but that's true i wish that i could say that god talks to me more than the devil talks to me now he probably tries to but the devil beats him there i wake up in the middle of the night and i try to get up and pray but you know what the old devil's always there he's always there because remember he's using the same avenue the only difference in a sinner and a christian is the center part of that christian is born again then you birth you know it's in the soul at the center part of us all right and in doing that then god is on the inside and satan is trying to attack from the outside but as i said and i keep repeating because i want you to see it just because god is living in our soul he's not a secret telephone hookup that goes up into heaven you know no he's sitting in there waiting the holy ghost on you and i to bring him the word then he can send it right back out into the individual that can come out then so we got an inside teacher which is a wonderful situation but everything comes through your brain you're sitting there right now because the brain has to work somebody in a coma you might could say that they can hear and things like that but you know you know yourself they can't communicate but think about it satan's way into the human race then that he wanted to do in the garden was not the ability he didn't have the ability to create god could create to mankind satan couldn't create that was the thing that was withholding from him that's what made him upset but when he seen the human race he followed the animal line coming down the prophet said one day like this said satan has a principle a knowledge of the principles of life in other words meaning what life is about and et cetera doing and he could watch that line come down told you we believe in evolution creative evolution not we evolved from a monkey no we believe in creative evolution because he created the animals one higher than the other but then there's where they mess up by darwin see he couldn't cross from the monkey to the man because he couldn't find that missing link well lord if he read the bible he'd found it through the beast and realize the beast was an upright creature he could talk he did and communicated with eve you know but the devil come in him and used him all right i like to put these little things in because to me it's what goes with me and my nature in my way if it was eating apples see we'll get to it in a minute why did god curse the woman in childbearing that's right all right and why would it be then that if it's apples and things why would it be why didn't the apple go on the altar that cain was trying to offer you know the fruit right he did do that we're reading a little bit he offered fruit but it didn't work did it now why was it and why this is the little point i like to put in why was the animal used to make the atonement right amen right that's right damn it right the animal didn't have anything to do with it as far as we know of it you know right he had to do with it in the serpent used him to speak but because of that animal then the animal wound up being the atonement in the old testament right right it's an animal sacrifice that's what i like to put in something where you can go home and think about it later and say well you know oh yeah we believe this but but the animal was used and then we'll get down to it a little bit further in the message why did jesus have to be born of a woman he spoke a body into existence one day come down and talk to abraham was known as melchizedek why didn't he just speak another body and step right down see that's when all them pharisees and all them guys had it figured out the way it's supposed to come but he came by the wound why because the wound was a part of the curse right right what was cursed to childbearing all right you don't go out and get bit by snake and get you a wasp and stick the the stinger into you and it takes care of the no you get the antidote from the snake right to take for that because it won't work any other way all right just think about it see satan doesn't have the devil he does not have any form of a physical seed okay but he has a lie that he told eve right what was that lie and i'll tell you he started off with her now we're we're trying to get in the bible we read during jen but he started off and he said you know he didn't run up to eve and try to do something wrong or whatever he he said uh can you eat of all the trees you can eat of all these trees out you're in the garden can't you she come out to be a pretty good preacher she says no we can eat of all the trees except the tree that's in the midst of the garden see she was preaching to him he couldn't contact her no other way right you don't a friend of mine started studying a doctrine he used to work dart durable he was very highly educated back to as a matter of fact he was a bacteriologist creator of the bacteria stuff had his own used to have his own labs etc etc and very educated and she started talking to him about the bible first thing you know they were living together i tried to talk to him but there wasn't anything you could do well because she already had him suckered in because it's going to church right it's hard tell church people that they're wrong what do you mean i go to church every service i'm there i do this i pray i fast and then you say you're wrong what about the lord jesus telling those pharisees that they lived all of their life was religion the pharisees sadducees and he said you're of your father the devil you're illegitimate born wasn't that what they said to him now if it wasn't something happened in the garden it had to do with with sexology why would they say to jesus that you're illegitimate that's right you see there's a lot of little catches that just go along and then you build it up and you when you do you get a good understanding of what's going on but just remember now this that when we talk about the seed of the serpent just remember the seed of the serpent is unbelief amen then when he uses the beast to whatever you want to call it you gotta admit he talked through it you to admit he got eve to do something wrong right right to cause to fall all right you got to admit that that's that's not even sensible because you you read your own bible but remember it was unbelief all right but unbelief has a display right right drinking gambling smoking run around women etc is not sin but what is it it's an attribute of an unbelief if you're a believer you don't do that right that's what brother dale i just can't help it we'll get bored again you know like i told you the other day i read years ago about a girl she go to go to a strip tea she'd do a strip these acts when she got two she'd i don't know where she put on clothes i didn't read that part but she'd go down and talk to the people in the audience about the lord to try to get them saved from what that's right like brother gary said years ago they had it down there on 10th street when they had all that hippie movement love they want everybody to be in the love movement you get born again you don't have to worry about it but if that was what the problem was and we need to go down to 10th street and get in the live movement but no no no we got to get born again that's the difference right because what can take away unbelief all right what can take away unbelief see because that's the only thing that's where you start from but remember unbelief always has a display right right now are you listening with me unbelief always has a display you don't understand unbelievable i don't believe you go out and you display something an attribute comes from that that is displayed all right so you don't understand it i'm an unbeliever but it's not nothing bothering me i'm just an unbeliever now you're a liar too i don't mind saying it that way because it's true all right but unbelief always has a display if it was just unbelief is all that took place in the garden now come on if it was only unbelief nothing else happened then why did jesus christ have to die he could have dealt with the unbelief to nicodemus he could have said nicodemus all you got to do is just believe it believe in me he said i'm believing in you pretty good because i'm putting my life on the line my job and everything i'm down here trying to find out something right cause you got something different he said yeah you must be born again amen see if it was just totally unbelievable there's always an attribute of unbelief why do people leave churches i don't believe what you preach but you know yourself what always happens they get up and walk out right or either sit here and be worse right right so that's up that's that's i'm just trying to get a point across see eve never stopped believing in god right right she didn't stop believing in god she talked to him every day god come down in the cool of the evening they're in the garden they're still worth saying things you know come down and fellowship with adam and eve all right wife it had just been unbelief god could have sat down and reasoned with adam and eve amen right but that wasn't all of the things that satan wanted to do because satan because he couldn't create he couldn't get what he wanted he got one third of the angels to follow his doctrine in heaven right and when he came to earth he wanted to enter mankind and he knew he couldn't do that by creation because he couldn't create so what was the attribute then that went with the unbelief well he was they would eat an apple as i said eve didn't stop believing in god she just didn't believe what he said satan said you shall not die because god knows when you partake of this tree and remember it was tree of what now what we were on the other day tree of knowledge of good and evil funny funny-looking tree i ain't never found an apple tree yet that i could learn anything from that's right have you well it ought to be sensible that's not a tree so then she just doubted what god said because look at what satan told her we've been through that in the scripture you'll be as gods knowing good and evil everybody wants to have something over the other person right the ego remember a few weeks ago our ego is we want to be smarter you get in a group there's always one or two that's running their mouth right they're going to get their point across one way or the other now i'm going to say this but i'm not going to be sarcastic about it i was bringing out a scripture just the other week here and i'm just going to say what i think i don't think the man had ever thought about that scripture at all but he walked into my office and he said you know that scripture i think you remember what i said if you can't show me don't tell me i think don't say i don't agree with you if you don't agree with me tell me where you don't agree because if not that's a bunch of baloney because you don't know you're just trying to exert your little authority i don't agree with you well show me where i'm wrong well i don't know where you're wrong but i don't agree with you now that that's that's pisces stupidity josiah's big enough now to understand the words now i can use the word stupid josiah because i used to i'd use it and he'd say that word ain't good we need a little fella but you understand what i mean see i'm just trying to put in a few things and think about the scriptures just think about what they mean see you and i we don't disbelieve in god but yet the prophet says we sin he said i sin daily now what's he talking about he ain't talking about adultery and this and that any other right and neither is paul when he gets over in the scriptures talking about those times christians don't go out and do those things just admit it if we do them we're not christians no but we want to hide and we ain't hid but listen if christian sins then what's our sins if you sin from the soul you're lost i don't mind saying it that way because it can't be but just one or the other if you sin from the center realm it's got to be faith or doubt so it's going to be the devil or god one right there ain't no gray areas it's one or the other all right so then a christian cannot sin from the soul the inner being the center but we still have the body and the spirit to deal with we're with satan dealing with evac in her reasoning memory consciousness where does he deal with you and i right where does he deal with us at through our memory reason conscious affection because the body's not worth nothing anyway it's without the spirit it's dead it's what the bible says it doesn't work if we don't have the memory reason conscious all right but what was always amazing to me was go ahead and pull up number one brother which is the paragraph 37 of the god of this evil age where brother random would make this statement about eve in the garden you know what he would say he said this is the evil age to prove to satan she's not like eve that she's not that type of woman he's going to deport the bride she'll be tried by his word i wish i could say about an hour right there on tried by his word but brother dale we're christians we shouldn't be tried the bible says if you come to god you must be chastened tried yes but you i don't like the way you preach will come and show me where it's wrong you see that's the way for god to deal with you and i to see whether we're really real or not and you know he's not trying to get himself to find out whether we're real or not he's trying to get it to fight let us find out whether we're real or not right because he knows but look and she'll be tried by his word the bride is adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever that's hebrews 13 8. well what do you mean brother death hebrews 13 8 wasn't he written back there it's the word of god right see eve doubted god would keep his word he told them that they'd die and like i told you the other day then that's where their deceiving part comes into mankind because he said today you eat thereof so the next day eve says adam i told you we wouldn't die right i told you we wouldn't die we didn't live 24 hours that day is a thousand years a thousand euros is a day is that the bible so even adam never lived a thousand years methuselah was 969 years old nobody's ever lived a thousand years but yet evc was deceived she thought she was right she still thinks he's right right so there she is and what happens she's confused on whether or not god will keep his word because if he is hebrews 13 8 you believe that jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever amen all right if that's true then god can't change his word right see whatever he says he's got to keep it all right so she was confused on that part of whether or not god would keep his word simple way of expressing what she was doing so she went after satan's lie and believed him still believes him right see then eve would begin to reason or disbelieve god's word and that would bring everything upon us either believeth not is condemned already we have to admit that whatever took place in the garden it brought death right upon mankind we have to go with that i mean anybody went out in high senses but agree to that point that it would bring death all right now so let's just get over to genesis 3 and let's just read a little bit and i want to get in the script we've been through these so don't worry about it we go to them again and and some of the things that i'm going to be bringing out today you'll find out wade brought him out wednesday and like he said we didn't talk about what was doing but uh we'll use a few of those phrases and things statements he made wednesday to connect together but look what happened in the garden now and the serpent was more subtle than he beast any beast of the field more deceiving right remember now the serpent was not a crawling snake right right because the scripture had already said the serpent was the most subtle of all beasts he was standing upright eve didn't talk to a snake even if he passed out apples i've never seen a snake with a hand yet he said was just silly that's what i'm talking about to show how silly we are right all right a serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field it's not talking about the physical beast to being more subtle he's talking about satan in the beast right amen okay and he said unto the woman yea hath god say it look at him you shall not eat of every tree of the garden he knew how to get to her she straightened him out she showed him how much her knowledge was right like i said the brother said i don't think that scripture means that i said well show me what it means well i just don't think it meant what you said it's hard to get rid of them oh egos ain't it you know what you can do the attack key goes right you get on brother chris there and talk about i don't even know his last name so don't even talk to me about trying to figure it out i'm sorry i just my memory is no good but say his family come over on the mayflower right come on how did he go in there my family came over the mayflower i told you mine was probably stowaways you know even though the name dale does come from titanic which is english and coming down but i don't have to do with it i told you that time that they was going to run the line to see if there was any of us you know that maybe had a tail you know looked like monkeys and got back so far and they found a bunch of his horse thief so they just found out they better quit egos will kill you right how do you feel when somebody walks up to you and says i'm like old brother tom farbush i used to get to tickle him i tell don't do that don't don't do it he walked up to god and he said my name's tom fox bush how you doing how was you baptized if you would baptize father son and holy ghost you're gonna die and go to hell because ain't nobody baptized in the bible like that ain't even got the guy's name yet that was tom okay we all loved tom you know that was his ways all right but see that little part of us called ego we want to be above other people we want to let everybody know what we believe i said tom don't talk to him about water baptism just talk a little bit here a little bit there brother dick's sitting there he knows i talked with him day in and day out for about a month never mentioned water baptism i talked to him about one god a few things you know and he said i see that one god it's not three you know god in three parts it's three manifestations of the same god i see you really believe that brother dick he said yeah i said what about this water baptism over here three or four weeks later see because that ego in that person my point is tom goes back to the church he was in talks to the pastor explains the scripture now you know tom if he explained to scripture he went from genesis to revelation to that guy about the water baptism he turned around the man he says what are you going to do about that right man said i'm going to take church tradition that's what he said now that's what tom said to mandolin said i'm going to take church tradition in other words it don't matter what all you said about the scriptures i'm going to stay with what i believe church tradition because he knew you'd get thrown out of the church the ego that's my point the eve had an ego satan you know how to touch it you can't eat of every one of them trees let me straighten you out on that and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden you're wrong we needed the trees but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die she explained it to him right that was her ego and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die didn't change a whole lot did it didn't lambaster about her belief he just eased around just a little bit and then he produced his thought for god doth know i'm telling you i got a knowledge about what god knows god knows that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be his gods knowing good and evil she didn't know about good and evil she didn't know about being a god you know that adam was god of the earth am i right he named the animals he'd done everything he must have been something but he wasn't the god of heaven but he was the son of god the bible calls him down right now watch the woman comes back and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food remember it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise listen she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also one to her husband with her and he did eat now whatever you think about happened in the garden eating apples eating pomegranates peaches plums or whatever we've done established that the first thing is unbelief right so when eve disbelieved god that he would kill her the moment she took of it she convinced adam right you know what he he ate also she got him the reason that he'd never done before he said well wait a minute brother dale now let's straighten it let's try let's get you straightened out brother today cause adam was not deceived i'll agree with you that's what made him in bad shape had he been deceived he would have been in the same shape as eve and the atonement could have been made and stopped the whole thing just if it was purely unbelief in the mind god could have sat down and reasoned with them adam knew exactly what he was doing he knew that when he went with eve he was selling the human race he knew what it was taking place that's why the bible says in adam all die that was the worst unbelief that could ever be put in there that was what i talked about while ago you said brother dale i don't have no unbelief now can i quote brother branham without you getting upset with me he said that's why we're sick that's what he said now you need to quote he said that's why we're sick he said because of her unbelief with this but all you want to that's the billy goats you see we don't disbelieve god in the basis of who he is and what he is and we don't say because we quote by stripes i'm healed i'm saying we say by stripes i'm healed but then the devil comes in and what does he say well that's not meant for you that's for everybody else but that's not your case or you remember what you've done this week where you've done this wrong you've done this wrong you've done this wrong the devil says you're not worthy of him healing you right now just that one don't never come up if it don't it sure will now because the devil knows how to use that and he'll be talking to you the next thing he'll do is say you ain't worthy well none of us is worthy the only thing we're worthy of is hell even though we don't believe it's burning but it ought to be but listen church i know some of the young ones coming in i hit a little something and make you think a little bit and you know you say you don't believe in eternal hell i mean yeah and he said don't believe in a burning hell but death and hell remembers casting the lake of fire that's when it's burning it's going to be burnt up just remember those things but look and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they had had the bellyache you take two little kids maybe this is something in the families you got a little boy and a girl maybe a little boy two years old i'm basically three and four years old little girl too you can put them in a bathtub together they're not too bad right but don't be stupid and put them in there when they're 10 years old now they're going to start looking at each other and they know they're different have some common sense oh my kids don't do that you blind stupid idiot can i make it any stronger you is that a way why can't you remember where you come from right don't put them kids out there in them situations you're creating something little kids thinks it's not too bad your mom and dad don't think too bad well they're not playing doctor you might or to go see what parts they're examining right just remember how your brain worked it might help now what happened as quick as the lord shows up or even before he shows up they will say we're naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons now like brother ernieville nueva says good point he said if they ate apples why didn't you make little bitty mittens why didn't god make little mittens and put it on their hand because they had to pick the apple up and look a little mitten and put it across your face you know and say that's what we've done no i don't think they put fig leaves over their heads could tell you a story about that where my mom and him wound up making some underclothes for the little girls that used to live next to us that didn't wear any and they thought well i'll straighten it all out they'll make a bunch of clothes you know under panties you know for the little girls little girls was from five to 18. they all took a bath out in the front yard in a tin tub and we was picking cotton right next to them that's why i said don't be dumb but they went down by there the next morning it's kind of funny but it'll shake that dryness off of you went down by the next morning and this lady she was kind of a little bit uh you don't like to use the word mentally slow slow because all of us is mentally was just a little slow you know what she was out hanging out clothes on the wash line you know where she had them panties at on her head for a head net he didn't get the point across the kids were still running around without any panties on come on you know what i'm not a i'm not an intelligent person and i'm definitely not a good speaker but i've read a lot about speakers and you know what gets her attention a little comical point that holds on so you'll remember that the rest of your days you'll remember that brother dale was telling about how that they changed that and when you do you remember what we were talking about they found out they were naked now when they made the fig leaves did they put the fig leaves on their head no i don't think so now do you i kind of think they covered up their private parts don't you i mean don't you think sensibly now why would if there wasn't something wrong there if it's unbelievable why didn't they cover their head because the unbelief's up here in the head but you see that's where people say why you preachers y'all just believe some silly stuff like that what took place we don't know it may have been a pomegranate well give me the scripture why did jesus have to be born from a woman why didn't he fall off the apple tree it's silly no it ain't silly it's a word of god they made themselves aprons you want brother branham's quote now for that he said they went back in the bushes with their fig leaf coverings and they were having church now you need that quote what was it having church about you you have church to try to learn truth don't you right you go to church try to learn the truth right i hope it's not show off your clothes because i'm in bad shape i come up here one day and i had on a black shoe and a brown one i walked around here all day long finally looked down myself and that's boy y'all pay attention what i dress you know one of you said i got a brown shoe and a black one on listen church you go to church to learn about god eve had adam back there trying to convince him that she was right right come on the prophet said they were back there having church now if you think that even adam wasn't a little bit spiritual don't forget i ask you a simple question another little point to put in just a thought why did they make them out of fig leaves now they certainly wouldn't have made it with a north american fig any of you ever had anything to do with fig leaves and they're rough as a cob now we saw a tree over there in israel and it didn't look like they were that but why did it say fig leaves why not peaches plums or apples or whatever why fig leaves why didn't somebody come up with the idea that what happened in the garden they ate figs because they could connect together at least but now let me show you something what is israel amen is not israel referred to as a fig tree that's right in the bible see you've had a greater revelation you think she had just remember folks these two people that were sitting in their little church back in the bushes had eternal life in their souls and it was talking about god it's all i did come along to israel wind up being a fig tree maybe they know a little bit more than we think they said well no we know it's trees it's trees it's trees and he said adam you realize one of these days they're gonna call israel a fig tree you say oh they didn't know that back there uh just remember the devil has the knowledge of all things and he could be in the church with him you think he wasn't on the front row okay now look at it and they heard the voice of god the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called on adam and said unto him where aren't thou now you think he didn't know where they were at do you understand he knew where i wore this at right but he what are you doing over there you know what are you doing you see what's being said is this what are you doing he knew right where they was at he wasn't saying where art doubt no i can't find you i don't see you where you at no he was simply saying why are you over there with those fig leaves on okay watch what he said and i heard that voice in the garden and was afraid and he went afraid the day before why was it afraid because i was naked now they've been naked all their life right but when something happened they put on fake leaves and said was naked and i hid myself now if you'll notice you'll go back and read three i'm going to just take verse by verse if it takes us two or three weeks after this one night it's okay with me and the lord called unto eve uh read no adam and he adam right said i heard that voice in the garden and was afraid because i was naked and hid myself was adam doing the talking right and he said who told thee that i was naked you never had no problem before have you but once you wind up the naked you've got fig leaves wrapped around you and he said hast thou eaten of the tree where have i commanded thee that i should have knight and the man said the woman whom thou gave us me you see why it's so hard to preach to people and just keep it going because you see now adam is preaching to god who does he credit with getting the woman right he didn't say you know you know i found an apple tree out here and i jerked off a couple of apples and found a woman read your bible sometime for yourself say that read it real slow and think about what's being said amen the woman who gave who thou gave us to be with me about three or four verses back up above there it called her his wife now he's saying god you gave me this woman she gave me of the tree and i did eat and the lord god said unto the woman what is this the taoist done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat said he beguiled me now he'd eat all right let's just get a little bit we'll quit and take it up this evening that word beguiled if you'll notice she didn't say the beast she said the serpent i want you to notice that keep in mind exactly what i'm saying now and don't self-interpret and run ahead of me because you're going to miss something and you're going to be as blind as a dog in the old blind dog in the meat house as to what brother branham actually said but yet you're going to be so spiritual until you ain't going to listen remember the tree of knowledge of good and evil is still there and the free moral agency is allowing each one of us sitting here to have our own thoughts okay she said the serpent beguiled me now the serpent beguiled her begilder what does begotten mean now notice i said she didn't say this the beast beguiled me the word begowed there is taken from the hebrew lexicon 53 77 it means to beguile it means to deceive it means to be beguiled to beguile or deceive all right now as white said the other day it's not showed up on here because they take it off doing it but in your looking in your strongest concordance it'll say right through here it'll say to see where this word is used in other places in the bible i said click on this all right if you go click on that now i'm going to tell you some of you looking it up the word beguiled is only used four times i think in the old testament one time in the new all right but 12 times in the old testament alone the word beguiled is translated deceived click on that little space up there and it'll bring you right down it means deceived okay beguile deceived to be because of you all right okay they got it up here okay click here in all verses you use this hebrew word just click on that sometime and see you'll find out that that word deceived is translated beguiled roll it on up i mean just because it's translated uh okay you'll have to take this off to get back down because you're pulling up the rest of it look what it says the word deceived the word beguiled is taken not as usual one from over die one and three the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee in the pride of thine heart hath beguiled thee all right click on those things sometimes and you really get a lot of references and a lot of things to enjoy because it's used 12 times in the old testament translated deceived instead of begiled right all right it's only used five times four in the old testament and one in the new all right the one in the new is what coming up to the next we know it very familiar second corinthians 11 3 but i fear that lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtility that's what paul's saying right so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ okay here's the definition of that word beguiled from the new testament form is 18 18. all right it means to deceive beguile to deceive all right now so using our form of what we're talking about the word beguiled is only used in the new testament one time but it's used four times translated as deceived you know taken from romans 18 and 16 and 8 for they that are served not their lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and for our speeches deceive the hearts of the simple beguiled the hearts of the simple so he said the serpent beguiled me all right so what happens the word beguiled defiled let me lay it aside right there and just say this i'll come back to this this afternoon and pick it up and we'll come right to this point only got 12 minutes eve the serpent beguiled her he deceived her it means to intelligently convince somebody you know but i'll cover this this afternoon and somebody on the internet don't know when some of you that won't be here this evening just remember the prophet of god said the word beguiled is defiled now how did he come up with that when i just showed you can show you and will this evening that the word beguile means to deceive the word deceive means to be beguiled but your prophet comes up and he says beguile means to defile right and we'll give the definition this afternoon of defiled you know what that means ceremonially religiously sexually so the prophet's right because means to foul here's a little point to put in for you to think of the serpent beguiled eve through her reasonings etc the beast defiled eve's body so the prophet's exactly right and what he's saying the beast never beguiled eve that's right the serpent the goddess through her reasoning and memories etc working on that end of because the title of the message is from spiritual to natural we'll have to take it up and keep continuing this evening brother so from spiritual to natural eve accepted satan's lie and that beguiled her she was deceived she thought she was right then the beast came into being and if you can't see that it was sex in the garden now i'll just go ahead because i don't mind saying it to people because they want something to run with so go ahead run with this one it is no problem with religious society to talk about adam and eve in the garden having sex you say well i never heard nothing about it i went there and asked a few questions because you know what they believed just what wade was quoting wednesday just like what i was quoting right around brown said the woman is the tree he said the man is the tree but remember there's not a quote that adam is the tree of life it's always referring to jesus christ not a quote so go run all you want to find out but the religious world even believes that adam and eve had intercourse in the garden that they weren't supposed to had then they had it and here come the twins go on the internet and run that and see if you're going to find some churches teaching that and brother biscuit in them and i'm quoting him now according brother ernie it was quoting him maybe he even said it in his message but when rabbi richmond and him was talking to brother biskell and they were explaining to him what happened he said it is no problem about intercourse in the garden because that's what man wants eve is the tree of life i mean the tree of death man is a tree of life they put them together in the garden and have sex they bring stuff that's religious they teach that that man says it's no problem thinking of adam and eve in the garden he said but the problem is thinking about even the beast so that gives us something to think about you see because if you don't believe and don't know what happened in the garden now i know i'm blunt sorry but go buy you a playboy magazine oh i ain't reading no stupid i ain't telling you to go out and do it i'm telling you what'll happen you go read a playboy magazine and they'll tell you in a hurry what happened in the garden but the preachers are so super religious and so oh that's that's all i wouldn't oh i wouldn't do that they used to laugh at me at work i worked with this black guy that right beside his name was bec fine friend of mine you know what he had on one end we had a little table about this little stool about this bit on one end of his stool he had playboy magazines on the other end of the stool i had the bible and around his books and they'd come by just dying to life and said we ain't never seen nothing like it i said well you don't see me going i'm human so i've done a series on the pyramids one day luther said i got a book i'd like for you to read on the pyramids i said bring it to me he did you know what it was playboy magazine they were explaining about the pyramids in egypt i'm sitting in the office of the boss reading a play more magazine some guys came down through there and looked over the little cubicle office and oh we caught the preacher we got the preacher he's in here with the playboy magazine that black guy he grabbed that boy that said that and i mean forcefully grabbed him and just picked him up slammed him against that wall he said he's studying something to preach i give him the magazine and you leave him alone and you know that was never mentioned by nobody about the playboy magazine i brought it here because they had a lot of truth that's what i say if you want to know what happened in the garden go get your playboy magazine now i'm going to say it you'll find one where a snake is crawling over a woman you think people of the world don't know what happened in the garden but the preachers are super rich super religious we don't think dirty thoughts well what happened in the garden oh it was unbelief yeah well what was the display come on musician what was the display what happened something took place i didn't know children got here about eating apples i'm just as honest but plain and blunt i'm sorry i told a lady that in jamaica one day and she sat there and died laughing at me i said ma'am may something wrong with you physically thinking if you don't know what happened do you see what i'm talking about but we're so religious until we want to don't want to think about these things why did it make you mad cause i told you don't put your kids together when they're little they're pretty good size i'll raise my kids the way i want to put them in there but remember you're the devil that's leading them in the wrong way don't be deceived if they ate apples why did they have all the fig leaves in all of the things well why is it so important for us to know this why do you need to be born again if it was only unbelief why couldn't it be dealt with with nebuchadnezzar or you know jesus talking to nicodemus and saying nicodemus all you got to do believe you're saved because that's in the message now right oh we come in the world with eternal life we don't need to be saved one brother used to say hogwarts and that's pretty good but i never seen a hogwarts except when it was dead and the only time we ever washed a hog i think it's about time we need to die and get born again my brother i ain't never heard nobody so i'm on the internet boy they're good and good somebody click on hear us talking like that will you tell me what happened in the garden and i'll ask you why all this sin out here and the perversion that's going on and why is everything in this world i said everything and didn't back up from the wording why is everything connected to sexology now you mean that our kids in school they're taught that we're come from a monkey right and they're taught sex education if you raise them kids right they know all about what took place and they know what's wrong you say but i don't want to talk to my kids somebody'll talk to them and they're going to tell them the wrong thing it's beautiful being husband and wife and raising a family but it's beautiful about being born again teach your children right let's stand 5 39 just a little verse anybody have a need 5 39. i just all figured out i read what your philosopher said about did you read the bible oh come to me in the name of jesus christ anybody else before we go if you don't believe in the serpent's seat what happens why is it that jesus never married of course what is a religious world saying today is any man no couldn't do it he was satisfied to pay the price for me and you dismissed the right one father just bless everybody going home oh god within me is within me
