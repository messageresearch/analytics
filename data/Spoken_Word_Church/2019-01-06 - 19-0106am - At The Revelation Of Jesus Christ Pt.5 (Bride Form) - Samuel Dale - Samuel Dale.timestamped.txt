[13:42] just commit it all to you have your way
[13:44] now as we read your word you come and
[13:47] speak to our hearts in Jesus name Amen
[13:51] the first Peter 1 verse 7 that's a trial
[14:00] of your faith being much more precious
[14:02] than of gold at purchase though it be
[14:05] tried with fire might be found unto
[14:07] praise and honor and glory at the
[14:09] appearing of Jesus Christ now there's a
[14:12] difference in appearing in the coming
[14:14] right that I've always stayed it kind of
[14:17] made a point where you can see he can
[14:19] appear in any church around the world he
[14:23] can appear there and be there as to the
[14:26] form of appearing but now his coming is
[14:30] going to be in this day not what we look
[14:34] at is we we think about a physical
[14:36] coming it's the coming of the Bride of
[14:40] Christ him coming forth in the end time
[14:42] in the Bride of Christ so then there's a
[14:45] vast difference in the appearing in the
[14:47] coming I say he can be out there
[14:49] appearing but nitin he's coming he's not
[14:52] coming to them
[14:53] he's coming to the bride okay all right
[14:56] our end the bride would be better way of
[14:59] saying it okay
[15:00] whom having not seen you love in whom
[15:03] though now you see him not yet believing
[15:07] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[15:10] full of glory
[15:11] receiving the end of your faith even the
[15:13] salvation of your souls
[15:15] of which salvation the prophets have
[15:18] inquired and sir
[15:19] diligently who prophesied of the grace
[15:22] that should come unto you see all that
[15:25] Old Testament was speaking of the coming
[15:27] forth of the New Testament all right
[15:29] searching what or what manner of time
[15:32] the Spirit of Christ which was in them
[15:36] did signify when it testified beforehand
[15:39] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[15:41] that should follow unto whom it was
[15:44] revealed that not unto themselves
[15:47] see they seen something was going on but
[15:50] they knew that they was not making it
[15:53] manifest in fullness went unto us they
[15:56] did minister the things which are now
[15:58] reported unto you by them that have
[16:01] preached the gospel unto you with the
[16:04] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[16:06] things the angels desire to look into
[16:09] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[16:12] be sober and hope to the end for the
[16:17] grace that is to be brought unto you at
[16:20] the revelation of Jesus Christ all right
[16:24] so now we know the Bible is a complete
[16:26] revelation of Jesus Christ in it would
[16:29] wind up in the Book of Revelations so we
[16:32] go to the Book of Revelations and pick
[16:35] up the thought on it all right
[16:36] revelations 1 and 1 says the revelation
[16:39] of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him
[16:43] to show unto his servants things which
[16:47] must shortly come to pass and he sent
[16:50] and signified it by his angel unto his
[16:52] servant John the by record of the word
[16:55] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[16:57] Christ and of all things that he saw
[17:00] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[17:03] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[17:07] those things which are written therein
[17:09] for the time is at hand
[17:12] you may be seated the Lord at his
[17:14] blessing to the reading of the word we
[17:17] had a good time last night in the the
[17:21] Bible study if you want to get the tape
[17:24] and you know listen we were covering a
[17:27] lot of things and a lot of over view
[17:30] a lot of different points you know in
[17:34] that I enjoy the Bible study I enjoy
[17:37] questions and answers because that makes
[17:41] the Prophet said makes a strong Church
[17:43] all right now what are we doing now as
[17:47] we're trying to talk on these things and
[17:51] talking about the end time and knowing
[17:54] that you know as we read from Peter that
[18:00] there's a great understanding to be made
[18:03] manifest through the bride of Jesus
[18:06] Christ at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[18:10] at the finality the finishing up the you
[18:14] know the making known and bringing forth
[18:18] in a revelation to you and I all right
[18:21] what have we been covering now we've
[18:25] been covering that you know the Prophet
[18:28] said it's just a way that he's he says
[18:31] now before I tell you anything
[18:36] you know of what's gonna take place in
[18:38] the church ages the main point was what
[18:41] he said I want you to know who I am all
[18:45] right so he reveals himself as the the
[18:49] beginning and the ending the Alpha and
[18:51] Omega all of the things he was which he
[18:54] is and shall come reveals himself as
[18:57] Hebrews 13:8 the Word of God to be made
[19:02] manifest and I asked the question last
[19:05] night at the end and I said I'll ask
[19:07] this and I won't say no more but you
[19:11] know we talk about the the Bible and
[19:14] talk about how that the book is sealed
[19:16] last a simple question join to the
[19:23] people on tape or anything they don't
[19:24] see it I'm holding the Bible okay now is
[19:30] this whole book sealed or is it only the
[19:34] Book of Revelations is sealed is the
[19:41] whole book sealed or is it just the Book
[19:42] of Revelations they're sealed I see then
[19:48] that away we can look at something and
[19:50] be able to comprehend truly what I've
[19:55] been driving for three or four services
[19:58] five now about the writing of the Bible
[20:05] right the writing of the Bible is what
[20:09] I've been discussing are trying to bring
[20:11] our thoughts and relationship to that to
[20:14] see you know what we're looking at all
[20:18] right now we know and we went through it
[20:20] trying to bring the point that see the
[20:29] Bible is it tells the past it tells the
[20:33] present and it tells the future all
[20:37] right all within the same book
[20:40] telling those things okay and I tried to
[20:44] illustrate it with like Moses as he
[20:47] wrote the first five books of the Bible
[20:49] and as his riding was back there see he
[20:53] was riding some little over two thousand
[20:56] years or more over after time had
[21:01] started you know but he wrote about what
[21:05] took place back there all right then
[21:10] he was covering things that was taking
[21:13] place right then then he was writing
[21:16] about those things and then he wrote
[21:18] about the future to come like my brother
[21:21] used to say how could Moses write of his
[21:23] own death you know because he does or
[21:26] you know you give him the first five
[21:28] books I said if you'll explain to me how
[21:31] that he knew what happened in Genesis
[21:33] you know in the creation of the world I
[21:37] said we won't have no trouble we're
[21:40] trying to understand about you know how
[21:42] he could write of his own death that
[21:44] there wouldn't be no problem because we
[21:46] could you could easily write now you can
[21:48] say I tell you what now brothers and
[21:50] sisters if time passes 50 more years I'm
[21:53] gonna die you know what I wrote the
[21:56] future right because if I don't I'm 78
[22:00] years old I don't think I lived to be no
[22:02] 125 or 30 years old
[22:04] alright but the point I'm trying to get
[22:07] you to see is a is a point now and it
[22:10] may take the rest of this message to get
[22:12] it to what I want to drive hard into for
[22:16] you to see the day and the hour that you
[22:20] are living all right now that's the main
[22:24] thing we're trying to do talk about the
[22:26] writing of the Bible and see how that
[22:29] any writer in there any of the prophets
[22:33] could stand and speak of the something
[22:37] way before them they could speak of
[22:40] things that was happening right the in
[22:42] present and they could speak of the
[22:44] future because that that point would
[22:47] hold Hebrews 13:8 the same yesterday
[22:50] today and forever to bring it all the
[22:52] way through
[22:53] all right see then we look at it and you
[22:56] could say to most people you know they'd
[22:59] say well we have the Bible well that's
[23:02] true but you know there's a lot of
[23:04] things in this Bible that has not come
[23:08] to pass
[23:09] right all right so you've got a great
[23:14] things to come you got a millennium
[23:16] you've got a future home you've got all
[23:17] kinds of things spoke of in the Bible
[23:19] just to getting to that point you know
[23:21] to see that you you can see there's a
[23:24] lot of things still to transpire all
[23:27] right see then is it the Bible because
[23:30] it is written down that was the last
[23:32] points we were trying to bring because
[23:35] Paul said to the letter killeth he said
[23:38] but the Spirit give us life now can we
[23:42] say it's the Bible just cause we've got
[23:44] this you know because we have a book we
[23:49] have it written well we've got this it
[23:52] tells the vice-president if you're a man
[23:54] we do but yet there's a lot of things in
[23:56] there that's still not fulfilled well
[23:59] right now here's the quote now from the
[24:01] Prophet what does he say he said as long
[24:03] as it lays in the pages of this book it
[24:07] can be questioned right that's what's
[24:12] wrong with mankind to date especially
[24:14] the people of the message they're
[24:15] questioning what they've got but he said
[24:19] once it's made alive are revealed he
[24:23] that really didn't even say manifest
[24:25] he's talking about when it's revealed
[24:29] all right see because he's gonna have to
[24:32] reveal it before he could make it
[24:34] manifest right no see then he'll reveal
[24:38] that then he'll bring it into reality
[24:40] but I'm trying to get you to look at the
[24:42] writing of the Bible that there's still
[24:46] things left that's not finished
[24:50] there's things left that the Bible says
[24:53] will come all right and it will will
[24:56] transpire all right these are names you
[25:00] know we get in there and we could study
[25:02] it and go through the changed in a
[25:03] moment in a twinkling of an eye you know
[25:05] until I've struck the truck
[25:07] and we could look at that and see that
[25:08] those riders back there of the Old
[25:11] Testament especially as we read in Peter
[25:14] that they knew something was trying
[25:17] taking place
[25:18] you know like brother Branham says about
[25:21] when Isaiah said you know a virgin shall
[25:23] conceive he said my lord he probably
[25:25] went home thought what in the world did
[25:27] I say you know I mean that's totally
[25:31] crazy to mankind you know and everything
[25:35] for that to be able to take place but he
[25:38] said it did take place see now then in
[25:42] the writing of it see we think just
[25:46] because that we have it pinned you know
[25:51] pen down that we have the Bible well all
[25:56] right now is it that's the last question
[25:58] that I asked was this is it the Bible
[26:01] because it's pinned you know written
[26:03] down or is it really which is the most
[26:08] valuable to talk to you of writing
[26:13] something a letter somebody's right a
[26:16] nut or hand it to you you know and then
[26:19] say you this is a will and etc you know
[26:22] and you'd read it and you'd say oh I
[26:25] just inherited a million dollars well
[26:31] now which one's the most valuable I mean
[26:35] the paper says you're gonna get it right
[26:37] okay now we're still in the word don't
[26:39] get me out of there leave me in the word
[26:41] to worms just get my point but which did
[26:45] you draw the house you say well I've got
[26:49] the paper and it's fish writers right
[26:51] okay but that that could be questions
[26:55] because it's written on page but the day
[26:59] they handed me the check
[27:01] all right now I know that I got
[27:04] something real I can start planning on
[27:07] spending because if not I don't have it
[27:10] to spend alright so which is the most
[27:13] valuable
[27:16] fact of somebody giving you a paper or
[27:18] somebody giving you what that paper was
[27:20] talking about now that's the point I'm
[27:22] driving hard for us to see the value of
[27:27] the Word of God we know it's the Word of
[27:28] God we know it will come to pass we have
[27:32] no questions about it this being the
[27:35] Word of God you know all right and to
[27:39] see then by it being the Word of God it
[27:42] will be fulfilled and that's why I love
[27:46] and and you know there's plenty of other
[27:48] translations and things but I like the
[27:51] King James translation all right you
[27:55] know the reason I like it like we've
[27:57] talked about last night about the
[27:59] prophets and the Word of God coming to
[28:01] thee this prophet he didn't do away with
[28:05] all those translations he verified it
[28:09] even like Lanza's translation etc was
[28:12] perfect in text and everything and I'm
[28:15] on it sometimes I can't read it exactly
[28:17] I have it but yet I believe it because
[28:20] he said it all right
[28:22] now see then this this book this Bible
[28:27] that we have has been vindicated right
[28:31] so that's what we're standing on now
[28:34] we're standing on we have the
[28:35] vindication of the Bible being true but
[28:39] there's a lot still it has not
[28:41] transpired all right and see actually we
[28:46] are here now in reality if you'll think
[28:51] of this point we are in the writing of
[28:55] the book God is still writing we all
[29:03] know it ended back there when this right
[29:05] No
[29:08] yeah it's not fully made alive yet until
[29:12] it's made alive then you can say you're
[29:14] in the finishing up of all time maybe an
[29:16] odd point of trying to get you to see
[29:18] but I want you to see the Word of God
[29:21] and how it's written all right now in
[29:25] doing that then we went through the
[29:27] Bible through in the different times you
[29:29] know of the points but we've come now as
[29:33] kind of standing before the Book of
[29:35] Revelations
[29:35] and looking at that and coming up into
[29:39] that point that we can see that you know
[29:44] there's actually things in those Church
[29:47] ages we're in the seventh church age
[29:50] right okay you say oh no we're not age
[29:56] where we are if you don't think so look
[29:59] in the mirror as you go out you'll find
[30:01] out you're in the age but now we're got
[30:03] to be birthed out of the age into the
[30:05] revealed Word of God okay so now that's
[30:08] that's the truth of it but see now I'm
[30:11] wanting to approach it to the point to
[30:15] where to get you to read the Book of
[30:21] Revelations and get and look at that and
[30:26] see that that's unfolding all right it's
[30:32] unfolding right now there's things in
[30:36] there that are if we could read it in
[30:38] the correct order we would be like
[30:40] reading the newspaper we ought to be
[30:42] able to anyway the way things are
[30:45] happening now huh
[30:46] we don't even read a new that need a
[30:47] newspaper we we can look out and see
[30:50] what's taking place and know that it is
[30:53] the finishing up of all times
[30:55] all right and see there's things then in
[30:59] the Book of Revelations especially them
[31:01] I'm driving that point to get you to
[31:04] look at it that in the seventh search
[31:06] age there's things that that age
[31:09] proclaims there's not finished
[31:14] no no so you're in still in the writing
[31:17] of the word because we're in the reality
[31:21] of the lie the living word and see by
[31:28] having a prophet to bring us the word
[31:31] then we can read the word now and
[31:34] realize that things like I said that
[31:36] there are things that have not
[31:38] transpired yet all right
[31:42] there's things and and we're still in
[31:44] that which was which is and which is to
[31:50] come because that was the point that
[31:53] we've drove that where the Prophet said
[31:55] you know from the Patmos vision he said
[31:58] I want you to know who I am before I
[32:04] start telling you about these things all
[32:08] right now here is our thought now to
[32:11] pick up from here and go in a service or
[32:14] two on it okay to know who he is
[32:21] we know he's the one God the Scriptures
[32:24] are right we know all of those things
[32:26] all right but if you stopped there you
[32:33] would not be bringing forth the complete
[32:35] Bible okay now it's gonna swallow a
[32:40] little bit because you're gonna have to
[32:41] listen okay now if we are part of the
[32:48] word and why would we not want to
[32:54] believe that we're part of I mean
[32:56] anything it's like why wouldn't we want
[32:59] to believe that we're part of it
[33:01] all right see then if we're part of the
[33:05] word
[33:06] then the part we are to fulfill in our
[33:09] day it's not finished
[33:12] why because we're still here it's gonna
[33:15] finish when we walk out of here then
[33:20] then we can say that in a reality we've
[33:23] reached the position that we need to
[33:25] think about we say then the Bible is now
[33:28] alive because remember our whole point
[33:32] letters on the page question but the
[33:37] alive word in your heart cannot be
[33:40] questioned as I was saying I win and
[33:44] there Wednesday the then if somebody
[33:48] could take some newfound revelations you
[33:54] know things and days and times they
[33:57] could find those things would it take
[34:01] away from what you believe are add to it
[34:11] Kota fits the truth it could be a dude
[34:14] all right now there's many new things
[34:18] that are coming out now I just saw a
[34:22] documentary there the other day
[34:24] happen to just click on it and see
[34:25] something and I like documentaries but
[34:29] that documentary was was going pretty
[34:33] good and you know they now can prove
[34:40] that in the Dead Sea Scrolls that they
[34:47] found outstanding things and are still
[34:49] finding things from those Scrolls that
[34:54] could relate to the day in the time and
[34:57] says things were back there you know
[35:01] things were happening that we say oh no
[35:05] see because if any of you has run across
[35:07] that you know what I'm talking about
[35:09] that they say in the Dead Sea Scrolls
[35:11] that even some of the Scrolls spoke of
[35:13] extraterrestrial beings coming to Earth
[35:16] and if the Jews we're trying their best
[35:20] to stop them from releasing any
[35:22] information this is 1994-5
[35:26] trying to stop them from the inner
[35:28] releasing any information from those
[35:31] scrolls you say well but brother Dale we
[35:37] don't we don't believe in that right we
[35:39] don't I don't believe in
[35:40] extraterrestrial beings like I said the
[35:43] truth can set you free definitely I mean
[35:49] I'm positive in my thoughts and
[35:50] statements I don't care what you come up
[35:53] and write all these books about and all
[35:54] of the places they get proved to find
[35:56] things it looks like this it looks like
[35:58] that I don't believe in extraterrestrial
[36:02] beings you know somebody in outer space
[36:04] or men on the other planets or etc no
[36:08] because my Bible says that Eve is the
[36:12] mother of all living
[36:13] so if there's anything out there she's a
[36:14] mother of it okay solve the problem but
[36:19] see the point that I'm getting at is to
[36:22] show you that if we take
[36:25] they said and not take it in such of a
[36:28] negative form we can take the profits
[36:32] message and they'd learn do a lot of
[36:36] fine I've told you over and over brother
[36:43] branham said they're in the fifties that
[36:47] Russia had said our plunge well we knew
[36:53] that had that's pretty well I you know
[36:55] they had to jet our plane to Germany to
[36:57] get at the end of the war you know World
[36:59] War two but he said Russia had jet our
[37:03] planes and flying saucers ran a new
[37:08] computer brother branham did you believe
[37:12] in flying saucers you believe in
[37:14] extraterrestrial beings from somewhere
[37:16] that flying around no I believe in them
[37:20] flying around from here if Russia had
[37:23] them don't you think we hadn't if Russia
[37:26] had you know spaceships to fly about and
[37:30] to do things don't you think we had him
[37:36] and the man made a comment that was in
[37:39] the time he said if this truth comes out
[37:41] said it'll destroy religion see because
[37:45] man religion would say oh no we don't
[37:48] believe in something from outer space
[37:49] and I don't either
[37:55] yet look we're at they look at the
[38:01] scientific age we're living in he said
[38:07] well what are you what are you saying
[38:08] I'm saying this if we take the message
[38:11] and listen to the message it will
[38:14] straighten out the thoughts that we
[38:17] could that no one could bring you know
[38:19] and there's no way to bring anything to
[38:21] contradict that because if we did have
[38:24] flying saucers
[38:26] in the 50s what have we got now and like
[38:33] I always try to emphasize that to the
[38:35] point because I like to read and look at
[38:37] things and when they was to go to Kuwait
[38:39] back there during that little conflict
[38:42] war thing you call it and I will
[38:46] remember about two months before that it
[38:49] was in the newspaper that we had was
[38:52] coming up with a stealth bomber and that
[38:56] we were to you know to bring that into
[38:59] being but we only had photo tops and had
[39:02] two of them you know two of the photo
[39:04] tops billions of dollars to cost to
[39:06] build him that was going to be
[39:08] supersonic great things well I remember
[39:12] you know I just keep that in mind well
[39:15] about two months later when they went
[39:17] into Kuwait they were 15 of them went in
[39:19] at one time well they sure got in a
[39:22] hurry and build them didn't it you
[39:24] understand what I'm getting at then we
[39:27] get to we get to news way late of what's
[39:30] taking place and see those those stealth
[39:33] bombers were great but yet see then my
[39:35] memory runs on back the 62 when Francis
[39:38] Powers was shot down by the Russians in
[39:41] that u2 pilot that it was more
[39:44] sophisticated faster than what even they
[39:49] revealed about these stealth bombers
[39:51] that was to come on now he said what are
[39:54] you talking about I'm talking about a
[39:56] reality that they can't take away from
[39:58] me they can't take away from me and come
[40:04] up and say well look at the extra astral
[40:05] being don't you believe in that they got
[40:07] history they got that yeah let him walk
[40:09] out and he'll speak English or Russian
[40:10] one of the two you know and then all of
[40:15] these sightings they have where they've
[40:18] been picked up and put over in a
[40:20] spaceship and carried off and brought
[40:22] around it's kind of funny they could all
[40:24] communicate
[40:25] you don't think nothing they could all
[40:29] communicate with each other what are you
[40:33] saying we're living in a sophisticated
[40:35] society that has brought forth of many
[40:38] of the things
[40:40] that mankind says doesn't exist but they
[40:42] do exist so what would you do brother
[40:45] Dale if they set down a spaceship out
[40:48] here in the back of the church what
[40:50] would you do I'd go out there and say hi
[40:51] guys glad to see you you know which one
[40:55] are you you for us are you for the
[40:58] Russians or everything else
[40:59] it wasn't drop it wasn't not my thoughts
[41:03] of Christianity my whole point is what
[41:07] can they take away from you the facts of
[41:11] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:13] Christ if they can take that away from
[41:23] it's not revealed see because when it's
[41:26] revealed in gonna take it away there's
[41:28] no way to take it away there's no way to
[41:30] take away the revealed word so then
[41:34] that's why to me the revealed word is
[41:36] greater than letters on the page hey
[41:39] come on we've got our understanding from
[41:42] letters on the page right but then the
[41:46] revelation has to come from Almighty God
[41:48] all right so then what did brother
[41:53] Branham say about the Book of
[41:55] Revelations we'll get this little point
[41:59] he's talking about those people you know
[42:03] the understanding the coming forth as I
[42:06] said he said I want you to know who I am
[42:08] before we go any further all right we
[42:12] study the one true and living God we get
[42:14] that laid in order everything's correct
[42:16] we know that there's just one God we
[42:18] don't have no problems with ideas or
[42:21] concepts of mankind to try to take that
[42:23] away from us
[42:24] because it's been revealed all right but
[42:28] has the rest of it been revealed
[42:32] they said I want you to know who I am
[42:35] all right now what's the next stage I
[42:40] want you to know where I'm at
[42:46] Stage one I want you to know who I am
[42:49] stage two I want you to know where I'm
[42:52] at
[42:57] where's he at
[43:02] he's supposed to be in menu right I mean
[43:07] it's supposed to be the new birth inside
[43:09] of us Christ in you the hope of glory
[43:12] we'll see then that way we can go in to
[43:15] the Book of Revelations and just keep
[43:18] moving as it unfolds
[43:22] you know unto us and bringing us to a
[43:25] point all right now the first point is
[43:28] what see who he is so then what's the
[43:33] next stage is to see where he's at he
[43:40] didn't stop revealing himself all he
[43:47] done was changed to form that he was
[43:49] using all right
[43:53] the revelation that God gave to Jesus to
[43:56] give to John now that all that's
[43:58] trinitarianism cuz we got to God give
[44:00] this that's gonna know we'll get to it
[44:04] we've got it written down in here the
[44:06] scripture says you know they asked Jesus
[44:08] when he was coming he said I don't know
[44:12] he said only the Father Knows right they
[44:18] said I don't know he said well he was
[44:20] the father yeah let's see we've got the
[44:24] scriptures from the Prophet and the
[44:26] thoughts from the Prophet to make it or
[44:28] it'll stay in the correct line cause you
[44:30] see Jesus said I do nothing until my
[44:34] father shows reverence that he didn't do
[44:38] nothing seen a vision so then we look at
[44:43] the human side and we think well I just
[44:45] don't understand that well it's easy to
[44:47] understand if we'll just keep following
[44:49] the story what's the next stage first
[44:53] stage one find out who he is he's the
[44:57] Alpha and Omega the beginning the end
[44:59] though he was gonna come and often hey
[45:01] he's all of it
[45:06] but see he didn't stop he just started
[45:12] the story to were that we could follow
[45:15] the the writing of the Bible on through
[45:22] whatever but but brother Dale John wrote
[45:26] these back tire if your did
[45:29] but remember Moses wrote back there
[45:33] remember the other prophets wrote of
[45:35] back tire iron but then there had to be
[45:37] a time that back tire had to become a
[45:39] reality and this is what brother Ron
[45:45] said he said that Jesus didn't know when
[45:48] he was coming he said that was
[45:49] withholding he said but now at this time
[45:52] for the present tense of him coming to
[45:54] John on Patmos he said now he knows all
[45:58] right why because the Bible is still
[46:01] being written the Word of God is still
[46:07] unfolding to you and I all right now if
[46:13] that be true then see if we see who he
[46:17] was and then we see where he reveals
[46:23] where he's going I don't like the word
[46:26] going to go somewhere something because
[46:28] it gives you the wrong idea he's going
[46:32] to show you stage two of the story stage
[46:36] one was to show who he was
[46:39] now he's gonna show where he's at all
[46:44] right where's he at
[46:47] who is this great one he's the Lord
[46:50] Jesus Christ he's the one who was he's
[46:55] the one who he is and the one to come
[46:58] he's Hebrews 13:8 alright now then what
[47:05] happens
[47:07] what is the next step where does he go
[47:10] where what does he do he reveals himself
[47:15] about one true nine or right - there is
[47:19] the revealing of one true and living God
[47:22] in Revelations you know all right now
[47:24] let's go to the first nine and if they
[47:26] will pull it up baby number two on you
[47:28] on your notes let's get to that
[47:32] revelation is one nine and just read it
[47:37] and then we'll approach to approach all
[47:40] right so either number two okay
[47:48] go to 17 drop back to verse 9 well I got
[47:53] it I got it there but I'd be okay just
[47:55] leave it I'll be fine and when I saw him
[47:57] I fell at his feet as dead now John's
[48:01] falling before this is the Lord Jesus
[48:05] Christ this is not brother branham
[48:07] coming to John because it's the Lord
[48:11] Jesus Christ that John is falling before
[48:14] and then when you get on over into of
[48:16] chapter 18 in chapter 19 or 21 then
[48:21] you'll pick up the other parts that your
[48:25] mind is trying to run to to say but
[48:28] that's it no no cuz look when I saw him
[48:31] I fell at his feet is digging any lady's
[48:33] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[48:35] not I am the first and the life now
[48:40] that's not a prophet that's Almighty God
[48:43] okay I am he that liveth and was dead
[48:46] and behold I am Alive for evermore and
[48:49] how the keys of hell and of death
[48:52] write the things now watching what does
[48:55] the Bible reveal what has been what is
[48:59] and what is to come that's the fool
[49:03] that's the intent of the Bible from
[49:05] Genesis to Revelation no matter who the
[49:07] authors are the router the prophets in
[49:11] the time that's what he's received so
[49:13] look what he said write the things which
[49:16] thou have seen
[49:18] and the things which are and the things
[49:24] which shall be Hereafter
[49:27] so now he's telling him to write what he
[49:31] sees write what you see you have already
[49:38] now put in writing I've given it unto
[49:41] you to let you know who I am now John
[49:46] you write what you see and what did John
[49:52] see okay so now then what it would go
[49:57] we're going over so alright we pick it
[50:02] up and what does it come up to drop to
[50:05] verse 12 it's reading I put these in and
[50:09] then put in it but come back to verse 12
[50:12] of Revelations 1 let's see what John saw
[50:18] John write this and send it to the
[50:21] church write what you see now he didn't
[50:29] see he saw chapter 1 verse 1 through 9
[50:35] he saw who Jesus Christ was Almighty God
[50:42] now where does he go from dark what's
[50:46] the next stage you got it okay and I
[50:51] turned to see the voice that spake with
[50:54] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[50:56] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[51:01] seven candlesticks one like unto the Son
[51:04] of Man clothed with the garment down to
[51:07] the foot and Girt about the paps with a
[51:10] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[51:14] were white like wool as white as snow
[51:17] his eyes were as a flame of fire
[51:19] Daniel covers him the same as the Son of
[51:23] Man okay
[51:25] and he had his right hand seven voices
[51:32] of many waters okay and he had in his
[51:36] right hand
[51:37] verse sixteen come on up beat like on
[51:41] the front advice okay we get it and he
[51:43] had in his right hand seven stars and
[51:46] out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[51:49] sword and what did it wound up doing and
[51:52] his calendars lock him to the sunshine
[51:55] of his full strength and when I saw him
[51:57] I fell at his feet
[51:58] it's dead he laid now there's where we
[52:01] get into that this one that John sees is
[52:05] the Lord Jesus Christ right but what
[52:12] form did he see what form did he see
[52:20] back up first twelve row back what form
[52:26] did he see we understand who this is but
[52:30] what form was it and I turned to see the
[52:34] voice that spake with me and being
[52:36] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[52:38] in the midst of the seven candlesticks
[52:41] one like unto the Son of Man clothed
[52:44] with a garment down to the foot and Girt
[52:46] about the paps with a golden girdle okay
[52:49] now brothers y'all would you pull up the
[52:51] the little thing that we made while ago
[52:55] let's look at the seven golden
[52:57] candlesticks
[53:04] okay
[53:07] that's what John saw seven golden
[53:12] candlesticks one in the midst of the
[53:14] candlestick like unto the Son of Man it
[53:19] doesn't save thee son of man because
[53:22] that's not the person of the son of man
[53:23] he's moved into another form he's moved
[53:27] from what he was telling John write what
[53:31] you know about me seal it up brainer in
[53:34] here but said now I want you to go
[53:37] another step and said going one more
[53:41] step I want you to see one in the midst
[53:45] of the seven golden candlesticks like
[53:47] unto the Son of man who is the son of
[53:51] man according to the profit on this
[53:56] arrives in the son he said who is the
[53:57] son of man he said in the beginning was
[53:59] the word the Word was with God the Word
[54:01] was God you need that one it'll be on in
[54:04] a few minutes the son of man why would
[54:10] it show the son of man why would he be
[54:18] dealing with son of man instead of
[54:21] dealing with son of God
[54:28] come on
[54:33] there's got to be something happen
[54:35] further than son of God now listen John
[54:42] before you say anything else I want you
[54:47] to know who I am
[54:50] who was he he was the son of the Living
[54:54] God he was Almighty God he was the son
[55:05] of the Living God that's why Peter when
[55:08] he said that Jesus immediately said upon
[55:11] this rock I'll build my church not on
[55:14] the revelation of Son of Man because
[55:17] that was a step that Jesus asked him who
[55:20] to man say I the Son of man I am
[55:23] but Peter immediately says thou art the
[55:26] Christ the Son of the Living God
[55:29] you are Almighty God in human flesh what
[55:34] else could he have stated because he
[55:37] didn't understand the Son of Man and
[55:42] Jesus immediately spoke back and said he
[55:45] said listen you got part of what I said
[55:48] I asked you who I am
[55:49] you said it right I am the son of God
[55:52] I'm Almighty God I'm showing you that
[55:56] but
[55:58] you didn't answer what I asked about the
[56:01] sort of man none of the writers wrote of
[56:05] the son of man now I'm not going through
[56:08] Matthew Mark Luke and John will you to
[56:10] say well they said that Matthew Mark
[56:12] Luke yeah they said it Matthew Mark Luke
[56:14] and John a son of man but then it none
[56:18] of their writings take John's writings
[56:20] after the book of John was written take
[56:25] which one was an original Luke and which
[56:30] were the other one of the two was Luke
[56:31] and Mark were not even original
[56:33] disciples but Peter and John never wrote
[56:40] anything else about the Son of Man there
[56:44] was at least two of them in one art now
[56:47] I've asked you this question over and
[56:48] over and the greatest of all was the
[56:52] old-timey none of those people back
[56:54] there was the Apostle Paul and he said
[56:58] not one word about the son of me
[57:07] but immediately a prophet comes on the
[57:11] scene in the 40s and he immediately
[57:16] starts speaking of son of man
[57:26] because he knew that son of God
[57:30] you've got the seven churches the Spirit
[57:33] of God dwelling in the seven churches
[57:36] but remember the point we're trying to
[57:38] get out one in the midst of the seven
[57:40] golden candlesticks like unto the Son of
[57:42] Man well there's no way to bring and put
[57:46] a physical man there because of the way
[57:50] the scriptures are written you've got to
[57:56] put the feminist Park all right so let's
[57:59] go ahead and read the scripture what was
[58:01] it can you pull up back up facing the
[58:06] brothers first way off rolled it back up
[58:10] and I turned to see the voice that
[58:12] spiked with me and being turned I saw
[58:14] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[58:16] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[58:20] unto the Son of Man
[58:22] what clothed with a garment down to the
[58:26] foot okay and Girt about the paps with a
[58:31] golden girdle we're gonna read what the
[58:35] prophet said that's a feminist all right
[58:38] and then he describes his hair and the
[58:41] whiteness and and then the Thetis Bryce
[58:43] and then he comes down and he falls down
[58:44] to worshiping that one that was dire
[58:49] that was shown was one lock under the
[58:54] son of mine okay he said well what okay
[58:59] alright let's just read it go ahead
[59:00] number three in other words right to
[59:04] things now John getting the point while
[59:07] they're coming up with that I want you
[59:09] to know who I am
[59:11] if you got that right I'm the Christ the
[59:14] Son of the Living God
[59:15] I'm the Almighty I'm the god of I'm the
[59:19] beginning the ending I'm that which was
[59:22] which is and shall come I'm all of it
[59:26] and I am the son of God but then he
[59:34] turns here and he says uh-huh one like
[59:40] unto the Son of man now Jesus on earth
[59:48] answered their question I don't know
[59:51] when I'm coming I don't understand that
[59:58] it's withholding from me to be able to
[1:00:01] express its withholding it's not given
[1:00:08] to me to understand but then when he
[1:00:14] comes to Patmos look at the first thing
[1:00:16] John sees are you listening let's get
[1:00:23] the point looks a lot across his mind is
[1:00:25] he human thinking jesus said I am the
[1:00:30] son of God you got that right John or
[1:00:39] Peter excuse me Peter you got it right
[1:00:43] that I'm the Christ the Son of the
[1:00:45] Living God you got it right that I'm one
[1:00:48] true and living God made manifest and
[1:00:50] there is no more you've got that right
[1:00:53] but I didn't ask you that question I
[1:00:59] asked you who is the son of man I said I
[1:01:05] know you can't understand it cause it's
[1:01:08] the time he asked him he didn't have the
[1:01:09] new birth right and he had the new birth
[1:01:13] he could have comprehended more at the
[1:01:15] time Jesus was asking these things there
[1:01:17] was no new birth involved
[1:01:23] but he said now I'm going to have to go
[1:01:26] away and said I'll come back to you run
[1:01:32] around city not only show them things
[1:01:34] you know that he had spoken unto them
[1:01:37] but said he also showed them the future
[1:01:39] and things you know more into their
[1:01:43] understanding but none of them know this
[1:01:46] mystery is what's quiet about sort of
[1:01:48] man but I ask you to do it that's what
[1:01:55] gets me people want to make this that or
[1:01:57] the other out of something would not put
[1:01:59] it like it is then your profit
[1:02:06] immediately see there forty seven is the
[1:02:10] start and I it's forty nine I believe
[1:02:14] now if I'm wrong this it's within the
[1:02:16] first two years and then he starts
[1:02:18] talking about son of man what's the
[1:02:27] first thing John does on patently I mean
[1:02:30] the Lord to John don't you know who I am
[1:02:34] I'm the Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:02:38] I'm Almighty God he said now we're gonna
[1:02:43] show you another step because listen
[1:02:45] because he said when I was with you on
[1:02:48] earth you couldn't understand it says
[1:02:54] now we're going to talk about one like
[1:02:56] unto the Son of Man
[1:03:02] now we're going to get the answer to the
[1:03:04] question that asked who the man say i
[1:03:07] the son of man am and now we're going to
[1:03:14] get it out of the Book of Revelations so
[1:03:20] I hope you see that he's still writing
[1:03:23] it over you say well there is it right
[1:03:28] now on all the Kate you came out of word
[1:03:29] so don't get all involved in that the
[1:03:32] brother Dale's talking about an
[1:03:33] additions or anything I'm not talking
[1:03:35] about I'm trying to show you that in the
[1:03:40] writing is right there in the word
[1:03:43] you're listening now go back through it
[1:03:46] listen Jesus said whoever man say I the
[1:03:50] Son of Man a.m.
[1:03:53] Peter said die the Christ the Son of the
[1:03:56] Living God recognizing him to be the
[1:04:00] very creator the word in brother Adam
[1:04:03] emphasizes it back to her
[1:04:05] the word was what created all things in
[1:04:07] Genesis so there was the Christ the Son
[1:04:10] of the Living God Almighty God in human
[1:04:13] flesh standing on earth he said now
[1:04:20] that's enough for me to hold you to
[1:04:22] build my church we said I'll return one
[1:04:25] day and said when I return I'm going to
[1:04:32] tell you the rest of the story I'm gonna
[1:04:35] get into the son of man
[1:04:36] so isn't it odd the first thing that
[1:04:38] happens in New Genesis I mean it happens
[1:04:40] in Revelation reminding him of who it is
[1:04:45] John I want you to know who I am I'm the
[1:04:49] Christ the Son of the Living God I'm the
[1:04:52] very creator I'm the the very beginning
[1:04:56] I am all because I'm God what sitting
[1:05:02] there there's more to be said
[1:05:05] because I mentioned it to you when I was
[1:05:08] with you and said you didn't understand
[1:05:10] and he lifts him and he said and really
[1:05:13] I didn't understand you now come on
[1:05:17] Jesus didn't know when he was coming he
[1:05:23] didn't know anything about the future of
[1:05:24] his in the church we got the quotes and
[1:05:27] the prophets will read it when we get to
[1:05:29] it won't get it today but that's all
[1:05:30] right but then immediately it turns from
[1:05:39] son of God
[1:05:41] chapter 1 verse 1 through 9 12 and going
[1:05:45] on through up to 30 up to 12 and then
[1:05:48] when it strikes into 12 it goes to one
[1:05:54] lock under the son of man Girt about the
[1:05:57] paps with a golden girdle now come on
[1:06:04] I'll get back to this but just to lay
[1:06:06] the point in that's coming judge because
[1:06:12] he moves the garment well I just don't
[1:06:17] jump over to the bat first let's get
[1:06:20] where we're going because you got to get
[1:06:23] to paps and get what that is and
[1:06:24] understand what's taking place all right
[1:06:26] now let's read what your prophet had to
[1:06:28] say they've already got it up this would
[1:06:30] be a great message for you to digest
[1:06:33] over and over in the word listen to a
[1:06:37] read okay seven church ages is 1954 now
[1:06:44] that's the Bible that's what the Spirit
[1:06:47] said the candlesticks are and the midst
[1:06:49] of the seven golden candlesticks one
[1:06:51] like unto the Son of man what one like
[1:06:56] him
[1:07:00] it's not him physically he's not
[1:07:04] standing there physically he's there and
[1:07:10] while in his bride watch one light him
[1:07:13] who was this his bride so who's seen in
[1:07:17] revelations 1 verse 12 or 13 right in
[1:07:21] there when it starts coming who has seen
[1:07:23] dire one like unto the Son of man
[1:07:28] thinking that right where Jesus left off
[1:07:34] now we're gonna learn a little bit about
[1:07:36] son of man who is this sort of man in
[1:07:41] the beginning was the word it's the
[1:07:45] rising her son so listen one lock under
[1:07:49] the son of man one like him who was this
[1:07:53] his bride what that was clothed with a
[1:07:57] garment down to the foot the holiness of
[1:07:59] Jesus Christ covering her has washed her
[1:08:04] from our sins with his own blood all
[1:08:06] right
[1:08:07] gird about the pouch not a man a woman
[1:08:13] with a golden girdle what is that the
[1:08:18] gospel that held the power and glory of
[1:08:23] God over the body of Christ
[1:08:26] a thumb-up bride form right so who is
[1:08:34] this John sees when he says one like
[1:08:37] unto the Son of Man Girt about the paps
[1:08:38] and gold and they're gonna he sees Jesus
[1:08:43] in another form right and it's a bride
[1:08:49] form okay let's go a little boy
[1:08:56] why are we not a denomination number
[1:08:58] four now if you notice so he goes
[1:09:04] through the candlesticks and the
[1:09:05] tabernacle and all of the things
[1:09:07] explaining and comes down seven Church
[1:09:10] ages a night now if you notice in
[1:09:12] Revelations one we find that Jesus
[1:09:14] standing in the seven church ages the
[1:09:17] seven golden candlesticks when he turned
[1:09:21] and saw one lakh unto the Son of man
[1:09:24] standing clothed with how was it it was
[1:09:30] a bride standing in two candlesticks
[1:09:33] drawed out now pull that back with a the
[1:09:37] bride and pull it back with it with the
[1:09:41] church ages across and there you go you
[1:09:46] know what this story about this picture
[1:09:48] that that is the Word of God
[1:09:51] in Bride form right the Prophet brought
[1:09:57] that out explained who that was he said
[1:10:00] look how they pressed down to no ink and
[1:10:01] made it darker he said there she stands
[1:10:03] where she's standing she's standing in
[1:10:07] the midst of the seven golden
[1:10:08] candlesticks
[1:10:11] but it's not portraying her as the Son
[1:10:18] of Man but portraying her as who he's
[1:10:24] manifesting himself through that's the
[1:10:27] point
[1:10:28] who's he manifested itself through today
[1:10:31] he's not you're in physical form so he's
[1:10:34] still rotting you realize every time a
[1:10:38] person is born into the kingdom of God
[1:10:39] God is still riding
[1:10:43] now come on home all right what's the
[1:10:46] next one go ahead a number five
[1:10:57] asking them to flop backwards and
[1:10:59] forward today all right this is taken
[1:11:01] from in his presence from Jeffersonville
[1:11:02] 1962 what about the great spirit a great
[1:11:07] Saint John of Revelation 1:7 when he was
[1:11:10] show division and looked and heard a
[1:11:13] voice speaking to him and he turned to
[1:11:16] see the voice and he saw seven golden
[1:11:19] candlesticks and one stood in the midst
[1:11:22] of the seven candlesticks with higher
[1:11:23] light wool eyes like flame of fire feet
[1:11:27] like fine rice
[1:11:28] he was girded with a girdle golden
[1:11:32] girdle around the paps and he was called
[1:11:36] the Word of God that's who he is and
[1:11:41] when he's seen him standing there listen
[1:11:43] this is what I like you realize that
[1:11:47] when he saw the bride do you believe
[1:11:54] that that is the bride when in the midst
[1:11:57] of seven golden candlesticks like unto
[1:11:58] the Son of man when your prophet said it
[1:12:00] was the bride we gave you two quotes it
[1:12:02] was the bride now to do but do you
[1:12:03] really believe what that is when he's
[1:12:05] seen him standing there that glorified
[1:12:08] state where is he glorified his bride
[1:12:16] he's glorified in his bride okay now
[1:12:21] listen in that glorified state go ahead
[1:12:24] to number 6 let's read these and then
[1:12:26] we'll quit from Patmos vision paragraph
[1:12:29] or page 49 I turned to see the voice
[1:12:33] that spake with me and being turned I
[1:12:35] saw seven golden candlesticks
[1:12:36] John does not say that he turned to see
[1:12:39] the one whose voice he heard would he
[1:12:44] turn to see the voice you remember me
[1:12:45] asking him Wednesday about it see John
[1:12:48] knew his voice
[1:12:50] John had lived with him for three and a
[1:12:53] half years he knew the voice he knew his
[1:12:57] looking away and he heard the voice
[1:13:00] huh see my voice is hard to kind of
[1:13:04] cover 99% of you can catch the first
[1:13:08] thing quick that I call on the phone
[1:13:09] you'll say brother Dale even brother
[1:13:12] John I called him the other day asking
[1:13:13] how they would do it and he yeah and he
[1:13:17] said hey brother Dale I mean all I'd
[1:13:21] said it hello now I know he could look
[1:13:24] at his phone and get the number off of
[1:13:25] it but I don't think he's doing it see
[1:13:27] it's hard to hide a voice all right and
[1:13:31] see John had lived with this man walk
[1:13:34] with him ate with him I'm quoting
[1:13:35] brother Branham I don't think he's in
[1:13:37] this quote but he was there with him day
[1:13:39] in and day out and when he heard this
[1:13:43] voice like a trumpet sounding he knew
[1:13:46] who that was the surprise was when he
[1:13:49] turned to see the voice you know in
[1:13:53] other words he knew that he was going to
[1:13:55] see him and when he turned to see him he
[1:13:58] didn't see Jesus standing there he saw
[1:14:06] him in seven golden candlesticks John's
[1:14:08] a prophet so we don't have to worry
[1:14:10] about it he knows he's gonna get to
[1:14:11] Revelation all right and when he does
[1:14:14] see and he turned to see the voice the
[1:14:17] voice and the person are one and the
[1:14:19] same Jesus is the word who is it John
[1:14:25] turns to see his voice that was what I
[1:14:27] was telling you I said cried listening
[1:14:30] to the old self
[1:14:31] cause I've never seen it you know in
[1:14:35] Nevada it was open oh well I was it Paul
[1:14:43] saw a pillar fire and he called it Lord
[1:14:49] brother Brent said he wouldn't have
[1:14:51] called that Lord had he not known that
[1:14:53] was who it was did you over the old but
[1:14:57] was you listening to what I'm trying to
[1:14:59] bring out
[1:15:01] Paul was
[1:15:09] blinded and knocked down
[1:15:13] why couldn't Satan impersonate a pillar
[1:15:16] of fire he can do it anytime
[1:15:21] what made Paul say who art thou he Son
[1:15:32] Jesus whom that person see the voice
[1:15:36] explained who that was standing there
[1:15:38] more than the man standing looking at a
[1:15:40] pillar of fire if he was listening in
[1:15:41] Wednesday night when he saw that pillar
[1:15:45] of fire what made him know that that was
[1:15:49] Jehovah the oh Jesus of the news he said
[1:15:53] o or soul my persecutors not me telling
[1:16:04] you exactly who he is persecuted he knew
[1:16:07] he wouldn't persecuting the Romans or
[1:16:09] anything I had he knew who he was
[1:16:11] killing and doing it and he said I'm
[1:16:15] Jesus that was the surprise to to Paul
[1:16:20] because that way
[1:16:22] he knew very little about Jesus right
[1:16:25] he'd never heard him priest he never
[1:16:27] been around him at much but he was
[1:16:29] killing the Christians that were serving
[1:16:33] Jesus he was holding the man's coat that
[1:16:38] was stone him Steven and Steven looks up
[1:16:41] and sees Jesus standing it to Ryan this
[1:16:47] you say but what I've had to be
[1:16:50] distraught pillar fire if that pillar
[1:16:53] fire - never spoke
[1:16:59] come on hurt when that pillar fire begin
[1:17:02] to speak back you better remember one
[1:17:05] day at one time for sure the Bible says
[1:17:10] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:17:16] angel right it's a voice how you gonna
[1:17:24] tell the voice turn on the tape they
[1:17:28] come on folks out in the old days and
[1:17:30] when they had to sell me it's real
[1:17:31] I could splice the tape and make him say
[1:17:33] anything I want him to say I could do
[1:17:35] that when I first started in this
[1:17:36] message I could splice those tapes and
[1:17:39] cut it out and make it and just put it
[1:17:42] go we had a lot of broke we had to put
[1:17:45] them back together what are you talking
[1:17:50] about John hears a voice he knows who
[1:17:54] that is
[1:17:55] he doesn't have to turn to see who it is
[1:17:59] he knows who it is and when he turns he
[1:18:04] sees seven golden candlesticks and
[1:18:08] wanting to miss like unto the Son of Man
[1:18:10] now he knows things is opening up right
[1:18:14] he knows who he's talking to you
[1:18:17] understand what I'm saying Paul just saw
[1:18:20] a pillar of fire and fell down and
[1:18:21] started work that's what we think about
[1:18:23] it that could be impersonated but when
[1:18:31] you put the pillar of fire and your
[1:18:33] understanding with it and then the force
[1:18:35] verifies it goes come on when John heard
[1:18:40] the voice he knew who it was and then
[1:18:42] when he turned he saw where the next
[1:18:46] stage of Christianity was at going it
[1:18:50] was going to the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:53] and short how she was going to be
[1:18:55] involved and it's showing the son of man
[1:18:57] to be revealed who is this son of man in
[1:19:02] the beginning was the word word with God
[1:19:04] the Word was God
[1:19:09] come on what if you heard his voice
[1:19:19] I always like one point the Bible says
[1:19:23] don't put anything on the mouth of one
[1:19:24] witness you remember that what is it two
[1:19:30] or three witnesses right I like it to
[1:19:35] her that I've got something to anchor it
[1:19:37] down with Paul how did you know who that
[1:19:45] was because he told me that I was
[1:19:48] persecuting me cuz he told me I was
[1:19:51] doing and I know who I'm persecuting
[1:19:53] right and he winds up and says well
[1:19:58] that's gotta be Almighty God
[1:20:04] he said I'm Jesus the one you're
[1:20:09] persecuting that solved it it didn't
[1:20:15] matter how many impersonations could
[1:20:17] come it didn't matter how much satan
[1:20:19] could do when you put that voice with
[1:20:22] the word you never heard his voice
[1:20:33] oh no we don't hear his voice of profit
[1:20:35] someone here the divorce well I I differ
[1:20:38] with you because he was one said it we
[1:20:40] do but that's alright I know problems
[1:20:42] I'm gonna argue with you about it but
[1:20:49] the thing about it is there's the catch
[1:20:52] to the whole thing will end on this
[1:20:53] point
[1:20:56] be careful the voice you hear
[1:21:03] be careful of the voice you hear not the
[1:21:07] sound of the voice or who it sounds like
[1:21:12] right but what does that voice say it's
[1:21:20] based on what it said more than anything
[1:21:22] else that's what John dirt when he saw
[1:21:25] that he wrote down what he saw when in
[1:21:28] the midst of seven golden kind of thick
[1:21:30] like under the son of man and he
[1:21:32] probably put a period on the end of it
[1:21:33] and said I don't know who that is
[1:21:36] because now we know where he made his
[1:21:39] second step John was saying simply we
[1:21:44] didn't understand him when he was on
[1:21:45] earth he said evidently he didn't either
[1:21:48] cuz he couldn't explain it to us which
[1:21:50] said now here when we've come to Patmos
[1:21:53] he said we're here for the Word of God
[1:21:55] called out of the first thing told to
[1:21:57] John he was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:21:59] Day and he said I'm here come on
[1:22:00] musician he said I'm here to bring forth
[1:22:05] the things that have been kept away from
[1:22:09] man but do you know his voice brother
[1:22:15] Brandon's voice on the tape can be
[1:22:16] impersonated letters off of a page can
[1:22:21] be written to say the Prophet said so
[1:22:23] and so see that's what's the danger
[1:22:27] point you know what I'm gonna say your
[1:22:32] honor especially when you're listening
[1:22:36] see what the voice tears
[1:22:40] if he take you to another God what are
[1:22:43] you supposed to do be careful of the
[1:22:48] voice you hear John hears that voice one
[1:22:53] more time John Peter knew heard the
[1:22:59] voice of the Lord Jesus Peter declares a
[1:23:03] dart to Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:23:05] you're the very creator you're the very
[1:23:07] word misspell he says that's alright
[1:23:12] what said that ain't the full story
[1:23:14] because there's more to happen he said I
[1:23:17] don't understand it myself because I
[1:23:21] don't know when I'm coming
[1:23:22] the father hadn't made that known we get
[1:23:28] all involved in that instead of trying
[1:23:29] to understand anything well the father
[1:23:31] and the son is one how come he was the
[1:23:33] father why didn't he know all things do
[1:23:35] you have the baptism when I go do you
[1:23:39] know everything ok that stops that yeah
[1:23:44] but ain't God no he trying to be trying
[1:23:47] to be straight with the word in the
[1:23:50] right place and so our didn't it that
[1:23:57] John immediately after the description
[1:24:01] if you followed me listen I want you to
[1:24:05] know who I am
[1:24:06] alright I am the Christ the Son of the
[1:24:09] Living God he named off who was he isn't
[1:24:13] said okay I got that I said now let's go
[1:24:19] to the next stage John hears a voice
[1:24:22] turns to see the voice and when he turns
[1:24:24] to see it he was expecting to see the
[1:24:26] Lord Jesus standing there and that's who
[1:24:28] he saw but he saw him in broad form now
[1:24:35] it's being described what Peter didn't
[1:24:39] get who demesne the other son of man you
[1:24:44] say those things are accidental and why
[1:24:48] did your prophet you
[1:24:49] answer me that go to your riders go to
[1:24:52] your scriptures going read none of your
[1:24:56] writers wrote of the Son of Man oh yeah
[1:25:00] now they could write what Peter said we
[1:25:02] Baptists come on first
[1:25:04] don't go hog wire with me and then I
[1:25:07] won't with you you know that we Baptist
[1:25:09] knew the Son of Man was the sign of the
[1:25:11] resurrection I knew that in a bad desert
[1:25:17] that the Son of Man was the resurrection
[1:25:19] sign why code he said I am the
[1:25:21] resurrection who raised lazarus but we
[1:25:29] didn't know what it was about
[1:25:31] well here comes a little old prophet he
[1:25:35] preaches for a while because he started
[1:25:37] in his 30s you know in the 30s preaching
[1:25:39] they recorded it started in 47 I think
[1:25:42] it's 49 and he starts talking about the
[1:25:47] Son of Man and tell me bring me one tape
[1:25:52] that he didn't talk about the son of man
[1:25:55] in it right you know what I mean he was
[1:25:59] trying to get us to see who that was
[1:26:01] until it was so misunderstood till they
[1:26:04] made him the son of man they made him
[1:26:10] the son of man he said I am NOT the son
[1:26:13] of man he said I'm a son of man he said
[1:26:18] D son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:22] but yet people won't listen to that they
[1:26:27] still think that brother branham was
