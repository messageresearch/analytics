[23:48] we appreciate you come
[23:50] on thank you
[23:56] bless God bless you all of it BR bless
[23:59] you well I
[24:03] think every time we have the opportunity
[24:05] and this time is a great opportunity to
[24:08] be on
[24:09] here uh brother Joe Salas
[24:14] is very good friend and he can back to
[24:17] the our
[24:18] church and he says you got to be in
[24:22] those meetings all the time we have you
[24:25] know
[24:28] we would like to be here all the time
[24:31] but sometimes we have a schedule for go
[24:35] to somewhere else and go around and and
[24:38] sometimes it's not a possible but this
[24:40] time we say well we got to do something
[24:42] we got to be there and uh when brother
[24:46] Sal told to the that the whole CH you
[24:49] know I'm I'm kind of well because every
[24:52] time when we make announcement you know
[24:54] all that CH want to come so and I don't
[24:57] want to
[24:59] bring everybody because just only the
[25:02] family we are probably 30 people just
[25:04] only the
[25:07] family but uh I think it's a great time
[25:10] you know uh we enjoy all the time and we
[25:13] would like to wor worship with with with
[25:16] you and here and it's a great
[25:20] opportunity many many
[25:23] years when the Lord called us we've been
[25:26] in a Pentecostal
[25:29] church and uh I
[25:32] remember a brother came by to the church
[25:35] and start uh talking to my oldest
[25:38] brother stand up my oldest brother his
[25:41] name is
[25:42] Martino so he received the MCH for the
[25:45] first
[25:46] time he was the first
[25:48] one so he carry all the tapes on on
[25:53] himself you know and hey you want to
[25:54] hear a tape and you know like that
[25:58] and uh
[26:01] eventually we get all the family and we
[26:04] believe the the
[26:06] message so one time um the the pastor in
[26:11] the church started notice something
[26:12] wrong you know something strange with us
[26:15] and and say you know something is happen
[26:17] with this
[26:18] family
[26:21] so they call us um my brother they they
[26:24] they call my brother to the office and
[26:27] other brother and later they come to our
[26:29] houses you know to to see what what's
[26:32] happening and finally we have to declare
[26:35] then we believe a message you know and
[26:37] tell them then we don't get out from
[26:41] your system or the system because you
[26:43] make you you do something for us or
[26:47] because you do something wrong for us no
[26:48] nothing like like that just because we
[26:51] believe something greater than that so
[26:54] when when we when
[26:57] we went to the a meeting in Atlanta for
[27:00] the first very time and we came back
[27:03] home and and and we decided to do
[27:05] something and we say well what we have
[27:07] to
[27:08] do and say well we have to take a
[27:10] decision now because they know then we
[27:12] are attending to another church we
[27:14] believe this message and we got to take
[27:16] a decision right now and we remember
[27:20] then we took our hands everybody you
[27:22] know all the whole family and we started
[27:24] praying and when we prayed that that
[27:27] that the Holy Spirit follow off and and
[27:29] in the house and from that moment
[27:31] brother we start serving God through
[27:34] this
[27:35] message so every time it's a a great
[27:38] privilege when when we come together
[27:41] because we believe that we are serving
[27:44] uh uh a living God we we we believe that
[27:48] we serve in
[27:50] um uh in in a spirit and Truth amen and
[27:54] the denomination we maybe we we can
[27:56] scream and cry and and but it's only
[28:00] emotion you know it's just an Spirit but
[28:02] nothing in true but now we believe this
[28:05] message and thank the Lord
[28:07] because we are here with uh a new new
[28:10] faces each time you know and
[28:14] uh last week brother Wayne passed to my
[28:18] house and I didn't know that he do the

[45:08] out I said well it's kind of weird they
[45:10] just kind of pushed us out when they
[45:12] found out we believe that God had sent a
[45:14] prophet that that didn't sound good and
[45:17] we believe in the serpent seed and hey
[45:19] brother that didn't really sound good to
[45:21] them so but you know was eil food dust
[45:24] brother Homer I mean it was reality amen
[45:27] and the Rapture body change and all of
[45:29] those things that uh to the church world
[45:32] it was kind of like it way off out under
[45:34] and they got God way off out I said you
[45:36] know God's here with us right now right
[45:39] Amen to God you want God in your heart
[45:42] open it up and let the word come in amen

[47:27] world he chose
[47:29] me and I am just so blessed I am so
[47:32] thankful that he he overlooked a lot of
[47:35] people and come to me I didn't go
[47:38] through lots of things that lots of
[47:39] people go through I didn't have to go
[47:40] through Pentecost I didn't have to go
[47:42] through this and I didn't have to go
[47:43] through that I was grew up in a Baptist
[47:45] church and then started going to brother
[47:48] JT's Church took me a long time to
[47:51] realize this was the truth there's
[47:54] nothing else outside of this message

[53:07] amen and this thing is always in my
[53:10] heart every time I get a chance to stand
[53:13] before God's people the opportunity just

[53:41] a very good uh friend of mine and he
[53:44] said if I ask
[53:47] you to describe
[53:51] God using one
[53:53] word can you do it yes
[53:57] so that was a big question that's right
[53:59] how can you describe this almighty God
[54:01] with just one word that's right so I
[54:04] didn't see anything I just thought for a
[54:05] minute I said
[54:08] wow so all of a sudden something dropped
[54:10] in my
[54:11] heart and I told him words can describe
[54:17] God cuz he's unlimited yeah but there's
[54:20] this word that I know and I know that I
[54:24] know God is faithful
[54:27] amen and ever since it gets stuck with
[54:29] me and all the time I
[54:33] know this
[54:35] word can describe God right if you have
[54:39] walked with God for a while you really
[54:42] understand exactly what I'm saying our

[55:32] up the phone and we were talking
[55:33] together and said hey you have to do it

[55:58] he can do it
[56:00] again this happened way back and I know
[56:03] God is going to do it again so I wasn't
[56:06] afraid
[56:07] and I take it easy I prayed I prayed I
[56:10] prayed and after a while she called
[56:14] again and said okay go to uh go back and
[56:17] take another one you know MRI and all
[56:20] that and so she went back cuz I
[56:24] delayed she went back she took it and
[56:27] they send a report and she called me
[56:30] back on the same number and they said I
[56:32] can't understand it just amazing we
[56:35] don't see nothing on the
[56:38] report we don't see nothing on the
[56:40] report
[56:41] nothing
[56:43] so my God is
[56:46] faithful
[56:48] amen my God is faithful amen we are
[56:51] serving a living God glory and I tell my
[56:56] myself anytime I got a chance
[56:59] here and anywhere I get opportunity even
[57:03] one minute I'll say something to
[57:05] encourage somebody yes sir and if you
[57:08] don't believe in
[57:10] Jesus and maybe you don't believe in
[57:12] this and after service you can see me
[57:15] yeah and um I might testify a lot of
[57:19] things that will help you this brother
[57:21] here brother ban he was with us before
[57:24] he moved to Maryland
[57:27] so many things happened to
[57:29] him and the worst thing was uh
[57:33] prostrate so it was really serious
[57:36] and uh he called me he was
[57:40] crying and uh but the Lord has then show
[57:44] me and I've called him and I told
[57:48] him so at that
[57:51] instant I told him butaka before you
[57:55] left you were very
[57:58] healthy and um I know you don't have a
[58:01] lot of service you know where you
[58:03] living the Lord want you to come back
[58:07] and I knew exactly what I was telling
[58:09] the
[58:10] brother so the brother you know he
[58:14] came and
[58:16] uh according to his testimony he said
[58:19] the week because he delayed another 5
[58:22] month but he said within that time God
[58:24] started doing things for him when he
[58:26] agreed to come
[58:28] back so
[58:31] um I took him to say doctor and they
[58:35] print the report and you know the report
[58:38] trace a lot of stuff in his body and I
[58:42] told him keep
[58:44] believing keep
[58:46] believing so about another year or maybe
[58:51] 8 months or
[58:52] nine he went back to take another test
[58:56] the brother is standing before us today
[58:59] brother you can stand up he is cancer
[59:02] free
[59:04] there not a choice not a
[59:11] bit and in our little Fellowship in
[59:14] Hostel God has healed a lot of at least
[59:18] I can
[59:19] count about five people that God has
[59:23] literally taken cancer out of their body
[59:26] so uh I don't have time I just have one
[59:30] song I said I have to sing it for the
[59:32] glory of God uh I can thank God enough
[59:35] when the musician will come sister Joe
[59:37] will also sing a song I see a lot of old
[59:40] friends
[59:41] and
[59:43] um brother Braham said this in the
[59:46] message the way to
[59:48] have a
[59:50] fellowship was
[59:53] 1955 and there was something about
[59:55] Fellowship sh we were listening to the
[59:57] type there and uh the prophet
[1:00:02] said love produces
[1:00:05] fellowship and that really done a lot
[1:00:07] for me amen so Fellowship is a product
[1:00:12] of
[1:00:13] love and if we keep fellowshipping
[1:00:16] because it's love and love is God so God
[1:00:19] produces fellowship and so we are very
[1:00:22] grateful and thankful to come together
[1:00:24] like this as the Samy said how good and
[1:00:27] how pleasant it is for Brethren to do it
[1:00:30] together amen um
[1:00:33] the daddy okay I want us to sing this
[1:00:37] song it it used to be in my language
[1:00:40] every time I want to worship
[1:00:43] God this song used to come so I felt
[1:00:46] that it's a beautiful song and I I put
[1:00:50] it in English so it's very simple few
[1:00:53] words so you can probably uh uh learn
[1:00:56] how to sing
[1:01:07] [Music]

[1:05:49] her Satan did not
[1:05:51] win that's right he didn't win amen
[1:05:55] that's right he thought he he thought
[1:05:58] just because she had that that that was
[1:06:02] going to be the end of it but she he
[1:06:05] didn't realize hallu that he just
[1:06:07] brought her into his
[1:06:10] presence amen and so so God's still good
[1:06:14] to us amen like I said we don't charge
[1:06:18] God foolish we thank God for his grace
[1:06:21] and his Mercy amen no uh how that God

[1:07:14] always got to be the escapegoat somebody
[1:07:16] takes it out on somebody
[1:07:19] else and I thought you know isn't it sad
[1:07:22] that brother R said it Go totally insane

[1:39:04] Isaac shall thy seed be called that is
[1:39:08] they who are the children of the flesh
[1:39:11] these are not the children of God but

[1:39:35] Isaac for the children being not yet
[1:39:37] born neither having done any good or
[1:39:39] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:39:42] to election might stand not of works but
[1:39:45] of him that calleth it was said unto her
[1:39:49] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it

[1:40:54] also that that he's faithful man our God
[1:40:57] is faithful because when it come to
[1:40:59] faithfulness there's no one can do it
[1:41:01] like my God my savior Jesus Christ you
[1:41:04] know and even the scripture tell us you
[1:41:06] know when we believe not you know when I
[1:41:08] get out of the way and things are not
[1:41:10] going like it should yet he remain
[1:41:13] faithful because he cannot deny himself
[1:41:16] amen and you know and that let I'm so
[1:41:18] thankful cuz that brings me to know that

[1:41:27] amen you know God is so good but but I
[1:41:30] believe that this God that we serve you
[1:41:32] know the great Creator the The Shepherd
[1:41:34] of our soul of the of the Sheepfold amen
[1:41:37] he his his his own existence is for his
[1:41:40] very own amen the the reason for his
[1:41:44] existence uh is for his very own you
[1:41:46] know I begin to think about you know
[1:41:48] that God was not satisfied with the
[1:41:51] sheriffin he was not satisfied with the
[1:41:54] turbin was not satisfied with the angels
[1:41:58] all of the creation he had done in
[1:42:00] animal life the you know the plant life
[1:42:02] all of that he was not satisfied but
[1:42:05] when he made man Oh my he got somebody
[1:42:09] in His image uh and then God rested amen
[1:42:12] I said oh my God don't let me fail you
[1:42:15] uh amen because I know what your
[1:42:17] existence about is for me amen now I
[1:42:20] can't speak for everybody but I know
[1:42:22] amen what he mean to me tonight am you
[1:42:24] know and I believe that he loves me and
[1:42:26] he cares for me you know that's that's
[1:42:28] my God Amen and when the word say that
[1:42:31] your lives are hidden with God Amen
[1:42:34] hidden amen that's exactly what it means
[1:42:37] amen so oh devil you better watch out
[1:42:39] amen hallelujah amen I'm thankful am man
[1:42:42] God is true to his word amen he true to
[1:42:45] himself he cannot lie amen and he always
[1:42:48] amen will do what he said in his word
[1:42:50] and I'm glad that I'm resting in that
[1:42:52] faithfulness
[1:42:53] amen that's God I like what Paul even
[1:42:55] saiden in Philippians 1:6 he say being
[1:42:59] confident of this very thing that who he
[1:43:03] who has begun a good work in you will
[1:43:06] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[1:43:09] amen now that's faithfulness amen
[1:43:11] because you know I you know I get beside
[1:43:13] myself sometimes I I don't do what I
[1:43:16] ought to do all the time up but yet God
[1:43:18] is still working it out amen God is
[1:43:21] still working out see you know we read a
[1:43:23] little bit about Abraham we're going to
[1:43:24] get into a little bit but you know God
[1:43:26] was still faithful in Abraham's life
[1:43:29] even that Abraham got down left left the
[1:43:32] the Homeland and got down in Egypt amen
[1:43:36] you know and he told a
[1:43:38] lie God's Prophet amen but you know what
[1:43:42] God was still faithful oh my God was
[1:43:45] still faithful amen when the Old King
[1:43:47] was going to take Sarah you know and
[1:43:49] Grandma you know she looked pretty good
[1:43:51] back then amen there she was getting on
[1:43:54] up in Agia and this King want to take
[1:43:56] her and make a part of his her and and
[1:43:58] and God say if you touch her you're dead
[1:44:00] man he better and not only this now here
[1:44:03] come Abraham out of position you know
[1:44:05] but yet God said now go down there and
[1:44:07] tell my Prophet to pray for you oh my I
[1:44:10] say God I know you're faithful Lord
[1:44:14] because there are times when I'm even so
[1:44:16] ashamed of my own self but yet God is
[1:44:18] still faithful because he cannot deny
[1:44:21] himself amen I'm than for that tonight
[1:44:24] amen what a wonderful savior we have now
[1:44:26] if you for just for a little while and
[1:44:28] we want to get into just a little
[1:44:30] thought now we won't have time to Amen
[1:44:32] to bring it in because we want to talk
[1:44:34] about whose seed you are now we won't be
[1:44:36] able to bring it all the way in about
[1:44:38] like you know the beginning of the seed
[1:44:41] man the destination of it and you know
[1:44:42] the trail but just a little
[1:44:44] encouragement about you being the Seed
[1:44:46] of Abraham and what that means in our
[1:44:48] life amen at this time amen so I want to
[1:44:51] read our scripture again to set our text
[1:44:53] amen and notice now so Paul begin to
[1:44:55] tell us in Romans 9 he said not as
[1:44:57] though the word of God has taken no
[1:45:00] effect but they are not all Israel who
[1:45:04] are of Israel right you can I drop
[1:45:07] something in here they are not all bride
[1:45:09] who say they are bride oh my I believe
[1:45:13] the testing time is coming uh we'll know
[1:45:16] who bride and who's not brigh amen I
[1:45:18] believe right now we going to see that
[1:45:20] there is a time we can call countdown
[1:45:23] amen amen we're going to see The
[1:45:25] Showdown just about in a few amen but
[1:45:27] notice now then he said now neither
[1:45:29] because they are the Seed of Abraham are
[1:45:32] they all children but in Isaac shall thy
[1:45:35] seed be called that is they who are the
[1:45:39] children of the flesh they are not the
[1:45:42] children of God but the children of the
[1:45:45] promise are counted as the seed for This
[1:45:48] Is The Word of Promise as is at this
[1:45:51] time will I come and Savor shall have a
[1:45:54] son amen I'm thankful to know that we
[1:45:57] can look back now begin to see some
[1:45:59] things that you know because when I
[1:46:00] thought about myself uh you know we
[1:46:02] didn't have no amen rights Amen to the
[1:46:06] to to God's promise amen you know as
[1:46:09] concerning the flesh we had no rights to
[1:46:12] it amen uh we were alienated from the
[1:46:14] Commonwealth of Israel had no God on our
[1:46:16] side uh but I'm so thankful that in due
[1:46:19] time the god that's rich in Mercy amen
[1:46:22] he made away from me now that was
[1:46:24] according to the flesh I couldn't see no
[1:46:26] way in but according to God's word amen
[1:46:30] and the Mystery of a predestination and
[1:46:33] election I was always there amen
[1:46:36] remember now you cannot be there here if
[1:46:39] you were not already there amen uh so I
[1:46:41] say thank God Amen I I couldn't see it
[1:46:44] amen I couldn't understand it but I was
[1:46:46] always there amen and God made a way to
[1:46:49] make me realize what promises and part
[1:46:53] of the Covenant is mind amen so notice
[1:46:55] now so we want to look at this quickly
[1:46:57] amen I'm not you know outward may look
[1:46:59] like a Hebrew or Jew amen but inward
[1:47:02] amen by God's word of circumcision amen
[1:47:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he bought
[1:47:07] me right on in amen so no now so want to
[1:47:09] look at this so we are thankful now for
[1:47:11] the sovereignty of God there's no one
[1:47:15] you know there's no one here who is here
[1:47:17] by chance no that's God doesn't work
[1:47:20] that way man now I may run my business
[1:47:22] that way but God doesn't work that way
[1:47:24] uh amen God knew before the foundation
[1:47:27] of the world before anything a n
[1:47:30] molecule anything uh he already had me
[1:47:32] on his mind I was already part of the
[1:47:35] economy of God already part of that
[1:47:37] Dominion of God Amen and all I when I
[1:47:41] and I didn't know it but I I dwell in
[1:47:42] eternity one time uh oh my mind can't
[1:47:45] even can't even comprehend that uh but I
[1:47:47] dwelt in eternity one time and all of a
[1:47:50] sudden God let us drop down on that
[1:47:52] little space called eternity into this
[1:47:55] place called time to be tested and tried
[1:47:58] amen but I've always were with God and
[1:48:00] I'm looking that day to be back with him
[1:48:02] amen But Here We Stand now so we are all
[1:48:05] elected called and predestinated by
[1:48:08] God's grace amen you know and I want to
[1:48:10] read the scripture amen so Paul can uhen
[1:48:12] tell us about that look in Romans uh
[1:48:14] amen 8 amen just flip back Romans
[1:48:16] 8:28 he say and we know that all things
[1:48:21] work together for good amen now I didn't
[1:48:23] say everything will be good but
[1:48:25] everything going to work together for
[1:48:27] the good amen amen and I'm so thankful
[1:48:29] that he's working on my behalf amen but
[1:48:32] all things work together for good for
[1:48:36] for to them that love God how many l God
[1:48:39] tonight amen amen uh to them who are the
[1:48:43] call according to his purpose amen oh my
[1:48:47] now I'm trying to hold me pieace but no
[1:48:49] now for whom he did for no yeah you know
[1:48:53] I like that amen we can acknowledge amen
[1:48:56] the forn knowledge of God Amen and for
[1:48:59] them that he forew amen he what God what
[1:49:02] he what he called amen for them he for
[1:49:04] knew now notice not for he he also
[1:49:07] predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:49:10] image of his son that he might be the
[1:49:13] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[1:49:16] whom he did predestinated them he also
[1:49:19] called amen you know that's the part
[1:49:21] where I come in also amen cuz see God
[1:49:24] already forew me in his mind amen and
[1:49:27] had predestination already worked out
[1:49:30] and then all a sudden he called me amen
[1:49:33] you know down in this late hour called L
[1:49:35] SE God called me amen and I'm so
[1:49:38] thankful that there was something that
[1:49:40] could resonate back to God to answer
[1:49:42] that call amen and God brought us in
[1:49:44] amen so notice now so we find out so he
[1:49:46] called us amen or predestinate us and he
[1:49:49] said now moreover whom he did
[1:49:50] predestinate whom he all them he also
[1:49:53] called and them he called he them he
[1:49:56] also Justified and whom he justified
[1:49:59] them he also glorified it's a done deal
[1:50:02] it's a done deal amen uh devil you've
[1:50:04] already lost the case amen amen
[1:50:07] everything that you tried to do uh it's
[1:50:09] in vain amen because when God open my
[1:50:11] eyes to who seed I am amen why it's a
[1:50:14] done deal amen amen I already know that
[1:50:17] I come from God and I go back to God
[1:50:20] that's why Jesus could tell them amen
[1:50:22] the this body but in 3 days I raise up
[1:50:25] again he knew who he was amen he knew
[1:50:28] where it came from amen he look I'm say
[1:50:31] why would it be to you if I go back to
[1:50:33] where I come from I come from God and I
[1:50:35] go to God and I said God what what
[1:50:38] tremendous amen uh amen know that we are
[1:50:41] the Seed of Abraham amen but no not
[1:50:44] which is Christ is that Royal seed and
[1:50:46] if we are dead in Christ then we take on
[1:50:48] Abraham's seed so those n so Paul also
[1:50:50] says in galatian if you want read this
[1:50:53] quickly I want to get a few scriptures
[1:50:54] in and a few things the prophet said and
[1:50:55] I'll let you go amen if we can but no
[1:50:58] not uh I think we got what two or three
[1:51:00] hours but a day okay amen God is so good
[1:51:04] amen Galatians 3 Galatians 3 and we want
[1:51:07] to pick this up here at the 13th verse
[1:51:10] Galatians 3 and
[1:51:13] 13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse
[1:51:17] of the law exactly being made a curse
[1:51:20] for us amen for it is written curse if
[1:51:23] everyone that hangeth on a tree thank
[1:51:25] God for calary that day of calary change
[1:51:28] it all for me notice now that the that
[1:51:32] the blessing of
[1:51:34] Abraham might come to the Gentiles amen
[1:51:37] now remember now we didn't we won't we
[1:51:40] we were not able to be obliged to that
[1:51:43] but that the blessings of Abraham might
[1:51:45] come to the Gentiles notice now amen uh
[1:51:48] amen might come to the Gentiles amen
[1:51:50] through Jesus Christ uh that we might
[1:51:53] receive the promise of the spirit
[1:51:56] through faith amen and what a mighty God
[1:51:58] we serve because remember I believe Mali
[1:52:01] 4 has restored the faith amen just like
[1:52:04] it was back there with Abraham back
[1:52:06] there with the patriarch has restored
[1:52:08] that Faith back to us today amen so
[1:52:10] notice now amen through the through
[1:52:12] faith be Brethren I speak after the
[1:52:16] manner of man though it be not a man's
[1:52:19] Covenant yet if it be confirmed no man
[1:52:22] dis all of or n of it or added to it now
[1:52:26] to Abraham and and and his seed were the
[1:52:30] promises made amen oh my now to Abraham
[1:52:34] and the see where the promises made uh
[1:52:36] now I I got this lat on but I want to
[1:52:38] drop it in right now you know when
[1:52:40] Abraham had Isaac and we know that's the
[1:52:42] lineage should come but we know the real
[1:52:44] Royal seed is Christ amen but we find
[1:52:47] that the Bible tell us in Genesis 25 I
[1:52:49] believe that Abraham gave all that he
[1:52:52] had to Isaac amen now he gave gifts to
[1:52:55] the other ones but all he had he gave to
[1:52:57] Isaac amen and I begin to think about
[1:53:00] now this is Brother Jean 101 amen you
[1:53:02] know that's why the Bible says uh gifts
[1:53:04] and callings are without repentance amen
[1:53:07] so they can have all the gifts they want
[1:53:09] amen but that don't mean they're the
[1:53:10] Seed of Abraham now I like the gifts
[1:53:13] also but I want the giver amen you get
[1:53:15] the giver and everything will be all
[1:53:17] right uh so he gave all that he had to
[1:53:20] ABRA to Isaac amen and I begin to think
[1:53:23] about that I said that's just like God
[1:53:25] Amen God he kyos amen or emptied himself
[1:53:29] gave all he had to Christ amen oh my
[1:53:33] then Christ amen kyos or EMP himself
[1:53:36] into the church the believer amen so
[1:53:38] what does that make to tonight amen it
[1:53:40] makes you no short of having the same
[1:53:43] life as God has amen you cannot die no
[1:53:46] more than God can die when they sing
[1:53:49] that song Amen I cannot die amen the
[1:53:52] world may not understand it but you know
[1:53:54] what because you are the Seed of Abraham
[1:53:57] amen you got the promise of eternal life
[1:53:59] amen so we find so he begin to tell us
[1:54:02] this amen Brethren he said I speak after
[1:54:05] the man of men that it be but it be a
[1:54:08] man's Covenant yet if it be a confirmed
[1:54:11] no man disol or or voided or anoth it or
[1:54:15] added to it now to Abraham and his seed
[1:54:19] was the promis he made he said not as to
[1:54:23] seeds as of many but of one and we know
[1:54:26] that's Christ and to thy seed which is
[1:54:29] Christ 17th verse and this I say that
[1:54:33] the Covenant that was confirmed before
[1:54:36] by God in Christ the law which was 430
[1:54:40] years amen cannot disan or disallowed or
[1:54:44] avoid or an know that it should make the
[1:54:47] promise of no effect for if the
[1:54:50] inheritance be of the law it is no more
[1:54:52] promise but God gave it to Abraham by
[1:54:55] promise amen and if I'm a Seed of
[1:54:58] Abraham then I got all of those promis
[1:55:00] amen and we find out so there's
[1:55:02] something uh amen so so tremendous about
[1:55:05] being amen the Seed of Abraham amen you
[1:55:07] know and I begin to think about that if
[1:55:09] we want to put in the terms of trying to
[1:55:11] you know get to the place uh know one
[1:55:13] time I had gotten a ticket and I you
[1:55:15] know didn't know all what was what was
[1:55:18] you know it comprises of uh you know and
[1:55:20] but then I begin to read it uh I began
[1:55:22] to see everything uh that was included
[1:55:25] in there and I said oh my goodness uh I
[1:55:27] didn't know I had all of that because I
[1:55:28] didn't read it amen I had it the whole
[1:55:31] time but I didn't read what I had amen
[1:55:33] and I say God thank you for letting us
[1:55:36] look into the promise amen that I know
[1:55:38] what I got amen so when the Devil comes
[1:55:41] in uh and try to steal my joy my victory
[1:55:44] everything uh I know what I got amen
[1:55:46] amen because I'm a Seed of Abraham amen
[1:55:48] but now we want to look at this now cuz
[1:55:50] not everyone who confess or profess to
[1:55:52] be a Seed of Abraham not not the seed
[1:55:55] amen cuz Jesus had to have a
[1:55:57] conversation one day with those who
[1:55:59] thought they were the Seed of Abraham he
[1:56:02] had to have a conversation with him amen
[1:56:04] and tonight you know I said God you know
[1:56:07] we want to speak to every heart amen
[1:56:09] because if I'm not where I need to be
[1:56:11] have a conversation with me Lord amen so
[1:56:13] Noti it's not right quick now in St John
[1:56:15] Amen in St John the the eth verse our
[1:56:18] eighth chapter and let's pick it up at
[1:56:20] the 33rd verse St John 8 and3 3 St John
[1:56:24] 8:33 do we love the Lord seed amen whose
[1:56:27] seed are you because you are the Seed of
[1:56:29] Abraham there are blessings amen and
[1:56:32] remember this Covenant is not you know
[1:56:35] what you will do but what God has
[1:56:36] already done the unconditional Covenant
[1:56:39] so notice now St John 8 and33 he says
[1:56:43] and we're picking up the conversation
[1:56:44] that Jesus began to have with man these
[1:56:46] Pharisees and so he said now they answer
[1:56:49] him we are a Abraham's
[1:56:53] seed and were never in bondage to any
[1:56:57] man how it says you ye shall be made we
[1:57:01] shall be made free Jesus answered verily
[1:57:04] verily I say unto you whosoever
[1:57:06] committed sin is is the servant of sin
[1:57:10] and the servant abideth not in the house
[1:57:12] forever but the son abideth ever if you
[1:57:16] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:57:19] you shall be free indeed I know it's not
[1:57:22] I know that ye are Abraham's seed oh my
[1:57:27] oh my now look at him now he's
[1:57:28] acknowledging something here now I know
[1:57:31] that you are Abraham's seed amen now
[1:57:33] that was according to the flesh that was
[1:57:36] according to the flesh amen now he
[1:57:38] begins to break it down later on and let
[1:57:40] them know who they really are amen
[1:57:42] because I say God when it comes to time
[1:57:45] really holding to this word we'll show
[1:57:47] who's bride and who's not bride amen so
[1:57:49] he said now so Jesus at that time having
[1:57:51] this conversation
[1:57:52] amen he acknowledge according to the
[1:57:54] flesh now remember they that are of the
[1:57:56] flesh are not the Seed of Abraham so
[1:57:59] here come him begin to clear it up for
[1:58:00] them he said now I know that ye are
[1:58:03] Abraham's seed but ye seek to kill me
[1:58:06] you know people still seek to kill the
[1:58:07] word
[1:58:08] today still keep to seek to take the F
[1:58:11] from the word today amen because my my
[1:58:14] word has no no place in you I speak that
[1:58:18] which I have seen with my father and ye
[1:58:21] do that which you have seen with your
[1:58:23] father oh my now wait a minute now wait
[1:58:25] a minute now you just just said that I
[1:58:28] know that Abraham is your father but now
[1:58:32] he begin to show him that there of
[1:58:34] another father and the only reason is
[1:58:37] because it has something to do with the
[1:58:39] word amen it has something to do with
[1:58:41] the word amen and I said God will know
[1:58:44] before this thing is over amen Who
[1:58:46] belongs in this word or not amen it it
[1:58:49] bothers my mind and baffled my mind that
[1:58:52] somebody can walk for 20 30 10 15 years
[1:58:56] in this message and all the sudden turn
[1:58:58] back amen amen that bothers my mind amen
[1:59:01] cuz I believe when this get a hold of
[1:59:02] you amen it won't Turn You Loose amen
[1:59:05] it's not you turning loose it won't Turn
[1:59:07] You Loose amen the only thing I can say
[1:59:10] is oh my I don't want to get in trouble
[1:59:14] amen I'm not even my own pull
[1:59:16] pit but God is so good don't you love
[1:59:19] him amen so we find out so here he begin
[1:59:21] to let him know who they are amen so he
[1:59:23] said I I I speak that which I have seen
[1:59:26] with my father and you you do that which
[1:59:29] you have seen with your father they H
[1:59:32] said it to him because they not begin to
[1:59:34] catch on Abraham is our father amen
[1:59:37] Jesus said unto them if ye were
[1:59:40] Abraham's children uh ye would do the
[1:59:43] works of Abraham oh my amen you will do
[1:59:46] the works of Abraham have the faith of
[1:59:49] Abraham the endurance of Abraham and
[1:59:51] love the word amen but we finally begin
[1:59:53] to expose them amen and I believe that
[1:59:57] why many will be exposed before this
[1:59:59] thing is over amen but I thank God who
[2:00:01] seed are you amen we are the Seed of
[2:00:03] Abraham but notice now he's now he said
[2:00:05] but now ye seek to kill me a man that
[2:00:08] has told you the truth which I have
[2:00:11] heard of God this did not Abraham oh my
[2:00:15] Abraham did I'm going to read something
[2:00:17] in just a moment while the prophet said
[2:00:19] that when we are Abraham's seed we don't
[2:00:21] dispute the word we don't dispute with
[2:00:23] God Amen there's something in US amen

[2:00:48] and because I'm your seed amen why you

[2:14:17] God Amen Abraham's seed will stand
[2:14:21] Abraham had an endurance about him that
[2:14:24] no one can can compare amen amen against
[2:14:28] all ours he stood amen and I like he man
[2:14:32] when things seem like it won't working
[2:14:34] he still stood on the word of God
[2:14:37] Abraham say Sarah you feel any better
[2:14:41] any different no bless God we going to
[2:14:43] have it anyhow why was he standing like
[2:14:46] that because God said so amen and there
[2:14:48] she was you know approaching
[2:14:52] 90 something years old and he
[2:14:53] approaching 100 amen oh my still say God
[2:14:57] says so I the prophet God said can you
[2:15:00] see him going down to the doctor and say
[2:15:02] now doctor we want to make preparation
[2:15:05] we going to have a baby that's right now
[2:15:07] today they would have took him right
[2:15:09] from there put that little white coat on
[2:15:12] him that put his hands that he can't use
[2:15:15] him and they L him down to one of them
[2:15:17] little homes and they'll watch him
[2:15:18] around the clock cuz they say wrong with
[2:15:21] him amen but he knew what was going on
[2:15:24] amen he knew that God said so and no
[2:15:27] matter what any doctor said he knew God
[2:15:29] say so amen and that's why I say God let
[2:15:32] me have that same Faith amen let that
[2:15:35] same line dwell in me tonight that we
[2:15:38] can take on Amen the every promise that
[2:15:40] God gave to Abraham so I said there we
[2:15:42] are man seeing these things happen me

[2:16:26] come back to this land amen you know and
[2:16:29] and but it looked like it was it was it
[2:16:31] was it was DM for a in a dismal hour

[2:27:59] beginning that we contended for and he
[2:28:01] said you build on that amen oh my let me
[2:28:03] hurry hey that's another message but no
[2:28:05] it's not he say and the life of a man
[2:28:07] that's dead be projected in you you will
[2:28:10] live the same life he live if the blood
[2:28:14] of a man was in a was a certain type and
[2:28:17] you took the blood from one man and
[2:28:19] changed the blood
[2:28:21] and change the blood of the one man into
[2:28:23] to another he would absolutely be that
[2:28:26] type blood oh my who was that uh said
[2:28:30] that I thing was brother hom mosquito B
[2:28:33] you he got say there's power in the
[2:28:35] blood now there ain't no power in my
[2:28:37] blood but there's power in the blood of
[2:28:39] Jesus Christ amen and that's why he was
[2:28:41] saying man you got that blood in you
[2:28:43] amen that Royal Blood of Jesus CH oh my
[2:28:46] oh oh my time he's so wonderful
[2:28:50] I tell you you you know used to be when
[2:28:52] I was growing up I had a speech
[2:28:55] impediment and I found out later on that
[2:28:58] really there was nothing wrong with me
[2:29:00] it was just that my brain was working
[2:29:02] faster than my
[2:29:04] mouth I just couldn't get it out because
[2:29:07] my my brain was and I couldn't get it
[2:29:08] out you know couldn't get it out you
[2:29:10] know so when I learned to slow it
[2:29:14] down then I could speak those words cuz
[2:29:17] I used to say a word and and it just
[2:29:19] fell apart prob say huh what you say cuz
[2:29:22] it just fell apart you know cuz my brain
[2:29:24] was working so fast my mouth couldn't
[2:29:25] get it out but now I can see you
[2:29:28] probably didn't know I had one cuz I
[2:29:30] learned to slow it down and then I can
[2:29:34] let let it work and
[2:29:36] sink see God has a way of doing
[2:29:39] things that I don't get ahead of
[2:29:43] him he has a way of do that don't I
[2:29:45] don't get ahead of him that when I speak
