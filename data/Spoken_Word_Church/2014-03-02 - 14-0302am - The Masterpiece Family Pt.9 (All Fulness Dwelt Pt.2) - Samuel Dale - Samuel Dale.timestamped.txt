[15:20] uh those things she was telling some
[15:21] things that caused you to have them with
[15:23] this that or the other I thought I said
[15:25] I always thought DOL Stone was because
[15:27] you eat rocks and dirt
[15:29] you know I thought that was because
[15:31] that's what we done you know but as kids
[15:35] but so just remember her she'll be
[15:38] knowing Monday what she's going to have
[15:40] the operation or not okay
[15:44] Colossians one we'll start with verse 15
[15:49] you know the story behind it 13 we're in
[15:51] the Kingdom of his dear son uh
[15:54] Redemption through his
[15:55] blood even the Forgiveness of sins and
[15:58] he says who is the image of the
[15:59] invisible God the first born of ever
[16:03] creature now watch what my point watch
[16:06] we start with learning about him and
[16:09] then learning about you know the sons in
[16:12] the kingdom and then now we're going to
[16:14] him and now watch it in whom is the
[16:16] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[16:18] of ever creature where by him were all
[16:21] things created that are in heaven that
[16:23] are in Earth visible and invisible
[16:25] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[16:27] principalities or Powers all things were
[16:30] created by Him and for
[16:32] him and he is before all things and by
[16:35] him all things consist he is the head of
[16:38] the body of the church which is the
[16:39] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[16:41] that he that in all things he might have
[16:44] the preeminence amen for it pleased the
[16:47] father that in him should all fullness
[16:50] dwell all right amen now in him now then
[16:55] verse go over to verse eight as we're
[16:57] doing he's not got it dark but beware
[16:59] lest any man spoil you through
[17:01] philosophy and vain deceit in other
[17:03] words after the tradition of men and
[17:05] after the rudiments of the world and not
[17:07] after Christ somebody deceive You by not
[17:09] believing the word says for in him
[17:12] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[17:15] bodily all right and ye are complete in
[17:19] him amen which is the head of all
[17:22] principalities you may be seated the
[17:24] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[17:27] the word and to give these out brother
[17:31] Wen uh I wanted you to have the copies
[17:34] of these uh
[17:37] quotes
[17:39] because hey I know I had my coat clean
[17:42] cuz the tag still
[17:46] there yeah I better check
[17:50] then but now we've been talking on some
[17:54] things and trying to get a a point to
[17:56] you about
[17:59] uh God in his ways and we believe that
[18:02] in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[18:04] bodily because we believe in one true
[18:06] and living God we do not believe in the
[18:08] trinitarian concept of three literal
[18:11] Gods neither do we believe in the god in
[18:15] three persons Blessed Trinity because uh
[18:18] a person is a personality personality is
[18:20] an individual individual is a person so
[18:22] then you're going right back to your old
[18:24] concept of trinitarianism we believe in
[18:27] one true Living God and Jesus was that
[18:31] God made manifest in flesh according to
[18:34] John 1 you know and and going into in
[18:38] the beginning was the word word was with
[18:39] God the Word was God then verse 14 says
[18:42] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[18:44] among us so we believe in one true and
[18:47] living God Amen all right now but we've
[18:50] been looking at it in the form of trying
[18:53] to uh comprehend the scriptures and the
[18:57] things and looking at at our day and and
[18:59] seeing it and knowing that there's a
[19:02] compound meaning to scriptures and
[19:05] compound Revelation uh he says out of
[19:08] Egypt he brought his son well all right
[19:10] that was Jacob coming out of Egypt you
[19:13] know the children of Israel all right
[19:15] then uh it would be Jesus Christ because
[19:19] when he was born you remember he they
[19:21] took him down to Egypt because they were
[19:22] trying to kill all of the the
[19:24] children all right and see then it has a
[19:27] compound meaning and a compound
[19:29] Revelation to it so what speaks of the
[19:33] bridegroom you know God himself will be
[19:37] speaking of you and I too which are the
[19:40] bride amen all right so then read the
[19:42] Bible that
[19:44] way read it as a thought relating to you
[19:49] right not just reading about somebody
[19:53] else you must read it that way you must
[19:55] study it we were comparing it last night
[19:58] like like Hosea sure Hosea was a time
[20:01] element speaking about Israel right all
[20:04] right and then you can take that after
[20:07] you get that time element thing out of
[20:09] the way you can move on to see uh the
[20:12] things that maybe related to you and I
[20:14] are related to Israel in the natural you
[20:17] know in our day because you you you
[20:20] don't want to just look at the Bible as
[20:22] just being a historical book it is it's
[20:25] the history of things you know all right
[20:28] but it's not a it's not just a book of
[20:31] History it's a book of Prophecy it's a
[20:34] book of Revelation it's a book of of the
[20:37] word being revealed and you and I are
[20:39] being revealed yes see because that's
[20:42] the point that I'm trying to get us to
[20:44] see amen is looking at
[20:47] ourselves read the Bible for yourself it
[20:50] changes things drastically when you
[20:53] begin to read yourself there like it
[20:56] says by his stripes we we are healed
[20:59] well I say by his stripes I am healed
[21:05] all right now see then that way it will
[21:08] be more meaning to you and that's the
[21:10] way God wants it to you and I he wants
[21:13] us to see ourselves uh every age or
[21:16] every group of people that's ever
[21:18] amounted to anything in God has always
[21:21] been people that saw themselves amen you
[21:25] know I mean Moses his mom had told him
[21:27] he the deliver he was raised up thinking
[21:30] about being the deliverer waiting hoping
[21:32] maybe a day would come that he could do
[21:34] something you know because he believed
[21:37] it but yet in all of that it didn't do
[21:41] him any good because he failed all right
[21:45] but five minutes in front of the burning
[21:48] bush when God spoke to him then here he
[21:51] goes towards Egypt first he's running
[21:54] out when he could have met an
[21:56] Insurrection and and took over the
[21:59] government by uh because he was in the
[22:01] head of the armies and things you know
[22:04] but he couldn't do that because it
[22:06] wouldn't to out and be right but when he
[22:08] was in front of the burning bush all
[22:10] right then there he met God he went back
[22:13] with a stick amen right and took over a
[22:17] whole nation and just ravaged the nation
[22:21] destroyed it just because of his contact
[22:24] with god well I if you and I haven't had
[22:27] a personal contact with god
[22:30] oh you know then you're talking about
[22:33] what God has said about somebody
[22:36] else you can't read the Bible as being
[22:39] personal to you unless you've had a
[22:41] personal experience of the new birth
[22:44] with the god of that word and then when
[22:47] you do you'll see that he's speaking see
[22:49] this Bible is a book of
[22:51] names Peter James John Etc but it tells
[22:55] what goes on during their period of time
[22:57] they were here and it tells what they
[22:59] were speaking of we've read here today
[23:01] of Paul in
[23:03] Colossians he was speaking of Jesus
[23:06] Christ right fullness of the godhead yes
[23:10] but then he says comes over you know and
[23:12] ye are complete in him right all right
[23:16] he's bringing it down to you and I right
[23:19] because we can read that if not why not
[23:21] just throw the Bible away and say well
[23:24] we don't have anything now this Bible
[23:26] then is speaking to you and I
[23:29] amen that's right when you read it read
[23:31] it that way amen that it's not only
[23:35] speaking to you and I it's speaking
[23:37] about you and I and that's the point of
[23:39] the Book of Revelations everybody's
[23:41] always said stay out of it you know well
[23:44] why it's the book that speaks of where
[23:47] we're at amen right it's the thing that
[23:49] tells what's going on out here in the
[23:51] day in the time that we're living you
[23:54] know and then you can see the the things
[23:56] that are that are going on
[23:58] I was asked to come in about the uh
[24:02] things that's going on now where that
[24:05] this certain and I won't call the names
[24:06] but this certain person you know got a
[24:09] big video from the pope of Rome to
[24:12] declare that he wanted to be brothers
[24:14] with all of the Protestants you know
[24:17] well you've seen it and viewed it well
[24:20] you know I mean I'm
[24:23] thrilled you know why I'm
[24:26] thrill all right now back about 5050
[24:30] years ago maybe a little longer during
[24:33] the time the prophet was on the earth as
[24:35] to bring in the end time message that we
[24:37] believe you know
[24:38] amen it started in an age of people and
[24:44] Eagles right and you going down the road
[24:47] and need nobody no matter where they
[24:48] even Christian or whatever it is
[24:50] everybody boy the the industry went
[24:52] haywire making Eagles to sell everybody
[24:56] they put them on their barns they put
[24:57] them in the the houses they put them
[24:58] everywhere over the churches they don't
[25:00] even know any relationship maybe as to
[25:05] what you're talking about you know why
[25:07] cuz it was the age and time of the eagle
[25:10] to be here all right well see now
[25:13] they're beginning to pick up on the
[25:15] basis if you listen to the man he said
[25:17] he come in the spirit of
[25:19] Elijah well I don't think he was meaning
[25:21] that he was
[25:22] Elijah cuz he goes on to explain it the
[25:26] church is believing you know 8 10 years
[25:28] ago down in Florida there was or
[25:30] somewhere down that way there was a
[25:32] church that started out believing that
[25:33] the people was
[25:35] Elijah and started a six-month
[25:38] Revival well then you know people are
[25:42] beginning to talk about it if you
[25:43] understand what I mean they're begin to
[25:45] talk about the unity they're beginning
[25:47] to talk about the the uh point that that
[25:50] you know Elijah is to
[25:53] come and but then they want to make it a
[25:55] whole group of people well you know what
[25:57] I I believe that that's exactly what I'm
[26:00] trying to
[26:02] preach I'm trying to preach about you
[26:04] and I becoming one with God
[26:08] Amen and being the end time
[26:13] people right that are to manifest God in
[26:15] the end time am the prophet brought his
[26:18] message somebody's got to make that
[26:19] alive Martin
[26:21] Luther the Catholic Church wasn't afraid
[26:23] of Martin Luther when he walked out
[26:26] himself I mean he just another Coupe
[26:29] excommunicate him you
[26:31] know they wasn't concerned with it
[26:33] didn't even raise an eyebrow when he
[26:35] nailed that thesis up but when the
[26:38] people begin to rebel and say Luther
[26:43] taught
[26:44] this then the Catholic Church got
[26:47] concerned because they were losing a lot
[26:49] of their converts to protestantism if
[26:52] you heard that man there he said now the
[26:54] protesting is
[26:56] over
[26:59] he said you're no longer protesting
[27:01] because that ended you know well it may
[27:05] have ended for a lot of people like that
[27:07] but it hasn't ended for the end time
[27:09] bride that's
[27:10] right I'm still protesting but not
[27:13] necessarily just a Catholic
[27:16] church right I'm protesting all
[27:19] religions whether you want to call them
[27:21] branhamites or Lula ites or whatever you
[27:23] want to call them I'm against all
[27:26] religious things that against the word
[27:28] of God sir all right see then you say
[27:32] well what are you trying to create a
[27:33] Revival I wish I could I surely been
[27:37] trying for almost 50 years now because
[27:40] this is what I've been
[27:42] preaching the bride becoming one with
[27:45] God the first message that I preached in
[27:49] 1969 was what the Bride of Jesus
[27:52] Christ is to be the son of man amen
[27:59] well you know I believed it then right
[28:03] you know what I firmly believe it now
[28:05] you know what the world's testifying of
[28:07] it
[28:10] now if you understand what I mean
[28:12] they're beginning to say the spirit of
[28:14] Elijah right why because it's among the
[28:18] people
[28:22] amen and see it's getting very deceiving
[28:25] yes sir
[28:29] right right to show you how I was
[28:31] illustrating to some of them my wife and
[28:33] them yesterday about
[28:35] it see you come up and you say well
[28:37] there's only one mediator between God
[28:39] and man the man Christ Jesus well that's
[28:42] scripture
[28:43] right well you know what a mediator is
[28:45] an
[28:47] intercessor well you know what if you
[28:49] quoted that to me and he said I don't
[28:50] believe in this about you know this that
[28:52] and the other you know what I I give you
[28:54] a page number out of marriage and
[28:55] divorce where you're prophet ET said a
[28:58] pastor was an
[29:02] intercessor so I'd say don't you believe
[29:05] that your pastor is an intercessor
[29:10] right they believe their Pastor their
[29:13] Pope is an intercessor amen how close is
[29:16] it to the
[29:17] truth come on
[29:21] Church see you say well we don't believe
[29:24] it like they believe it what's the
[29:26] difference
[29:27] right an intercessor is an
[29:34] intercessor but the thing of it is see
[29:36] they believe their intercessor is
[29:42] infallible right right but we don't
[29:46] believe that our intercessors of people
[29:48] is
[29:49] infallible
[29:51] amen we don't even believe that brother
[29:53] brandham was
[29:55] infallible we believe that message he
[29:57] brought is
[30:01] infallible right amen and see that way
[30:04] then I mean they can throw it right back
[30:06] in your face and use the quotes against
[30:12] you but which one is
[30:16] it see is brother random my
[30:21] intercessor they say the pope was their
[30:26] intercessor
[30:28] you see we can't just argue thoughts
[30:30] anymore or little Concepts well I don't
[30:33] believe it like you believe it as what I
[30:35] asked my sister one day when she was
[30:36] talking about the Catholic church I said
[30:38] would you mind explaining to me the
[30:39] difference in the Catholic and the
[30:42] Protestant well she stumbled and
[30:44] stumbled a little bit matter why she
[30:45] said they worship Mary and we worship
[30:47] God or Jesus I said that's not true they
[30:51] don't worship
[30:55] Mary they ually as an intercessor
[30:59] true they're not worshiping her they're
[31:02] using her as an
[31:04] intercessor
[31:08] well are you listening to the
[31:12] ministry that's an intercessor for you
[31:15] you see how easy it is to be caught into
[31:18] Catholicism but yet we're so no we don't
[31:20] believe in
[31:22] that don't believe in
[31:26] what
[31:27] it's just you know forgive me for that
[31:29] if you want my opinion on something ask
[31:31] me I'll tell you but I'm tickled to
[31:34] death that there beginning people are
[31:35] beginning to talk
[31:38] about that those people are the spirit
[31:40] of Elijah you know why because there a
[31:42] spirit released amen for the real bride
[31:45] to begin to believe who she
[31:48] is and what she's here
[31:51] for and I'm glad of
[31:55] that all right but think about it
[31:59] now we've been doing something for quite
[32:02] a while to try to encourage your
[32:04] thoughts and we ask you to read or hear
[32:06] the message Masterpiece and see not
[32:09] there with the Shook and the things you
[32:12] know but I've been trying to take things
[32:15] and come through them to bring it up to
[32:17] show you that it starts you know
[32:20] understanding and it goes up to a uh
[32:22] height of understanding all right and we
[32:26] talked about the grain of wheat that the
[32:28] Lord Jesus spoke of he said unless a
[32:30] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[32:32] die it abides alone all right well we
[32:35] know that he did die and went into the
[32:37] ground or else he would have B he only
[32:39] been him all right but then a church
[32:41] come out from that from that one grain
[32:44] of
[32:45] wheat that went into the ground which
[32:47] was the Lord Jesus Christ out of there
[32:49] came the bride on the day of Pentecost
[32:52] amen you know in in in the book of Acts
[32:55] all right but we know that that was a
[32:57] compound meaning because it spoke as
[32:59] Jesus was saying you know that it was
[33:01] speaking of that the bride would go into
[33:03] the
[33:05] ground all right that's your compound
[33:08] meaning or compound Revelation your
[33:09] thoughts are looking at it see Jesus was
[33:11] not only speaking I've got to die and go
[33:13] in the ground but he said I'm going to
[33:14] come back into church I'm going to start
[33:16] the church it's going to do great for a
[33:19] while but said then it's going to go
[33:21] into the ground cuz if not you and I
[33:23] wouldn't be
[33:25] here
[33:28] because if they went on back there in
[33:30] the book of Acts right on the end of the
[33:31] word they had the great Apostle
[33:35] Paul if they' have went on with the word
[33:38] God would have just finished it up and
[33:39] you and I wouldn't be here but that corn
[33:42] of weed had to die and go into the
[33:44] ground so the bride had to come down in
[33:47] the Dark Ages and the thing and go into
[33:49] the ground and Sprout back out in the
[33:51] days of Martin Luther right of the
[33:54] Lutheran church and we believe what he
[33:57] taught that the just shall live by faith
[33:59] all right now if you've read any of the
[34:02] things about it which you ought have
[34:03] noted a long time ago I know in in 199
[34:06] something that that the Lutheran signed
[34:08] that because they were trying to agree
[34:10] over the communion that was the basic
[34:12] split the church and I remember that
[34:15] from way back there all right but see it
[34:18] did start a
[34:20] Reformation right a reform he wanted to
[34:24] reform the Church not destroy the church
[34:27] the people went out and took what he
[34:28] taught and went out and started burning
[34:30] the
[34:31] buildings he wasn't against the
[34:33] buildings and the people what's a matter
[34:35] with the building right you going to
[34:37] burn anybody burn the person in it you
[34:40] know come on the building don't have
[34:43] anything to do with it it can't talk
[34:46] right but the
[34:48] people so it took it wrong and Luther
[34:50] said well that's not what I was trying
[34:52] to show you he wanted to
[34:55] reform Wesley wanted to
[34:59] reform all right coming down to
[35:01] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian P then
[35:04] into the
[35:05] Pentecostal to come back to be the
[35:07] carrier of the
[35:10] grain all right the same grain that went
[35:13] into the ground's got to come back in
[35:14] the end time you believe that all right
[35:16] who's going to make it
[35:21] manifest there's got to be a bride in
[35:23] the end time to believe that that's the
[35:25] point I've been trying to make so keep
[35:27] your mind in the thought of what I'm
[35:29] saying about
[35:31] it we see people will say you know and I
[35:34] wrote this down where i' remember people
[35:35] would say I don't see nothing going
[35:39] on well why don't you open your
[35:47] eyes John the Baptist the one that it
[35:51] speaks of as being the greatest of the
[35:54] prophets never done one miracle
[35:58] but there was nothing going
[36:00] on he was introducing the
[36:05] Messiah right
[36:07] amen but you see what we want to do is
[36:09] we want to
[36:11] see to
[36:13] believe if I can see it I believe
[36:15] it brother random says 12 times seeing
[36:19] is not believing I mean that's just that
[36:21] quote
[36:22] alone seeing is not
[36:25] believing if you can see something
[36:27] there's no need to believe that's right
[36:30] I I've got on a shirt they can see it on
[36:32] the internet I got on a shirt I don't
[36:35] have to believe for a shirt I've got it
[36:38] on that's a scientific
[36:40] fact that once you can see something
[36:43] with a natural eye that's there in
[36:45] reality there's no longer believing it
[36:48] that's scientific the Bible doesn't say
[36:51] I see to believe the Bible said have you
[36:54] uh David said in the Psalms 2713 I had
[36:58] find it unless I had believed to see y
[37:03] the goodness of
[37:05] God but we say well if I could see
[37:08] something going on I believe there
[37:09] something going
[37:11] on that's the
[37:13] blindest stupidest statement that
[37:16] anybody could ever
[37:19] make because you're showing how dumb you
[37:21] are the fact that you're breathing
[37:25] a
[37:27] is a
[37:28] miracle right especially in this
[37:33] day right right but you see that's the
[37:36] point we want to try to make well
[37:39] brother so and so said he didn't believe
[37:41] nothing going
[37:42] on well forget
[37:44] it is brother so and so
[37:47] God no well then if he ain't God I ain't
[37:51] going to worry about
[37:52] it then I know God's not going to say
[37:54] there ain't nothing going on right amen
[37:58] right but see that's where we think we
[38:00] make it look beautiful for ourselves but
[38:03] not knowing how stupid we show ourselves
[38:04] to
[38:07] be the very fact that there is a bride
[38:09] of Christ who above all the
[38:12] denominationalism and above all of the
[38:14] denominationalism that's in the message
[38:16] and that for somebody to just simply
[38:18] believe is a master Miracle that's
[38:24] right but see then I don't have to worry
[38:26] about it because I can stand and talk
[38:28] about how I've seen the sick
[38:31] healed the dead raised people the storm
[38:34] spoke out of
[38:36] existence three people as Brother Gary
[38:38] wants to talk about back
[38:42] there you see then I don't have to brag
[38:46] I just tell what took
[38:48] place right but then you got somebody
[38:51] like I was telling them last night the
[38:54] nothing's going on was nothing going on
[38:57] you know the dead rais sick healed all
[38:58] kind of things but nothing's going on
[39:00] but you let one little thing happen you
[39:03] let them get a toothache and it go
[39:06] away you let them just yaking about it
[39:09] you know get a toothache and it go away
[39:11] it's in the Anderson Independent or
[39:13] Atlanta Journal they so and so had a
[39:15] toothache and it went
[39:17] away see because they wanted they want
[39:20] to talk about the things to
[39:23] them well God don't talk about them he
[39:26] talks about a
[39:27] church a bride that can
[39:31] believe and if we can believe it we'll
[39:33] see
[39:34] it but we'll never
[39:36] see you know first and then try to
[39:39] believe it you don't need to believe it
[39:41] if you can see
[39:42] it that's right I've seen God do I'm not
[39:45] I'm not questioning whether or not he
[39:47] exist right right amen but see that's
[39:50] our point because we look at something
[39:52] then this something like this comes up
[39:53] on the Internet systems or comes up on
[39:55] this that or the other and they just go
[39:58] Haywire you let this guy die and a pope
[40:01] come out of the United States blood said
[40:03] Pope out of the United
[40:05] States oh my Lord this man's got the
[40:08] most western ideas you've ever seen in
[40:10] your life and the one before had Western
[40:15] ideas you don't have to come out of the
[40:17] United States
[40:20] right as a matter of fact it could be
[40:22] the people in the United States that are
[40:23] more popish called brandom I Lula IES
[40:29] Huda IES or whatever you want to
[40:32] be it's just time to get down Church to
[40:35] believing what the prophet has said
[40:37] that's right amen right and you know
[40:40] what we don't have to make that manifest
[40:42] that's right God has never asked anybody
[40:45] to make
[40:47] manifest he's asked us to believe it
[40:49] where he can make it manifest
[40:51] right if we believe it he can make it
[40:54] manifest amen
[40:57] what if brother R would have stood back
[40:58] lord now when you get through doing it
[40:59] I'll believe
[41:02] it no he confessed it do no matter what
[41:06] yes and he confessed God as a Healer he
[41:09] confessed the third pull and his wife
[41:11] was so sick with a growth on her side
[41:14] until it was
[41:16] pitiful well I believe for everybody but
[41:19] my
[41:20] wife I must have a little unbelief there
[41:23] somewhere
[41:25] no he knew what was going on that's
[41:28] right you know what one day God spoke to
[41:31] him
[41:32] why because he didn't have to see to
[41:36] believe he believed to
[41:38] see can we do
[41:41] that can we believe what the prophet of
[41:43] God has taught us if not then why do we
[41:46] confess the message of the hour that's
[41:49] right I mean get out of it go something
[41:51] back to something else and shout and
[41:53] have a glory good
[41:55] time
[41:59] but you see Church he's waiting on
[42:01] somebody to believe it
[42:05] right you know the whole world was
[42:07] waiting on Martin Luther to believe that
[42:08] just shall live by
[42:10] faith come
[42:14] on and you know he taught it you know
[42:17] the world begin to believe it
[42:19] right and you know what I still believe
[42:21] it don't
[42:23] you but you show how you seeing in that
[42:25] how dece in it is that they broke down
[42:29] to join together and says we believe now
[42:32] that the just lives by faith alone well
[42:37] you know it's not in the
[42:38] Bible it's not in the Bible that the
[42:40] just shall live by faith alone that was
[42:43] Martin Luther who added that thought to
[42:46] that but it come from the thought that
[42:48] that's what the Bible was saying right
[42:50] amen that the just shall live by faith
[42:55] alone and see they were even quoting
[42:57] Luther when they could say the word
[42:59] alone's not in the
[43:03] translation but then they went on to say
[43:06] and it was
[43:08] true they went on to say the man did it
[43:11] in other words faith without
[43:14] works he didn't use those exact terms
[43:17] but it's close faith without works is
[43:20] dead we believe in that amen right I
[43:23] believe that you shall live by faith
[43:25] don't you amen alone but I believe Works
[43:28] must follow that Faith or else I don't
[43:31] have the
[43:34] faith
[43:37] right how deceiving can it
[43:42] be where are we at but think about
[43:46] it now we spoke this past
[43:50] Sunday trying to uh you know and that's
[43:54] the reason I've kind of moved over
[43:56] letting these brothers preach uh you
[43:58] know the Wednesdays the word that I'm
[44:01] more here over the the weekend and some
[44:04] of you can't come on Wednesday so I
[44:05] honor that and try to get you to a point
[44:08] that you know to where you can we'll try
[44:11] to deal with the Sundays and um it also
[44:14] lessens my voice a little bit and you
[44:17] know I am getting a little older I call
[44:19] Brother Richard Wilson today and the
[44:21] first thing I said to him I said how
[44:23] does it feel to be an old man
[44:27] cuz he's
[44:28] 75 you know and I said how's it feel I
[44:32] said I'm not an old man how does it feel
[44:34] to be
[44:36] 75 you know cuz I'm just 73 and be 74 in
[44:41] another month well I don't know what it
[44:43] is to be 75 brother dick but you
[44:49] do see you're an old
[44:52] man I'm a young man trying to catch up
[44:55] with you
[44:56] okay but now
[44:59] listen I hope you follow the thought yes
[45:02] that we're trying to bring yes and we
[45:05] ended up last Sunday with an an
[45:07] outstanding statement that I want to
[45:09] pick back up and we'll go on with it and
[45:12] then I know we won't get through this so
[45:14] keep these notes till this afternoon the
[45:17] Lord willing we'll try to get through
[45:18] this today of the point I want on this
[45:21] message but you remember what we ended
[45:23] up talking about a very odd way
[45:26] brother brandham saying something that
[45:28] was taken from Christ the Myster of God
[45:30] reveal so go ahead and pull up number
[45:31] one uh I don't know who's back there
[45:34] who's who's running the show now is it
[45:38] automatic
[45:40] okay but listen to what brother Brown
[45:42] says on paragraph 143 Christ is the
[45:45] mystery of God
[45:47] revealed but what he wanted to do he
[45:49] loved fatherhood or he was a father and
[45:52] the only way he could express it was to
[45:55] be become a son of
[45:58] man now listen that's the reason Jesus
[46:02] kept saying the son of man see they
[46:04] didn't know what he was talking about
[46:06] many of them but now you get
[46:08] it what he was a father when he created
[46:13] Adam and
[46:16] Eve right he was God when he created the
[46:19] angels and they worshiped him but that
[46:22] father of creating Adam and Eve was not
[46:25] the father he wanted to
[46:28] be it was not the full
[46:30] expression so when he stood on Earth as
[46:33] son of
[46:36] man the word made flesh he never
[46:39] declared himself to be the Son of God
[46:41] that's right he always spoke of son of
[46:43] man well they couldn't understand it and
[46:45] like I told you even Paul never wrote of
[46:47] it in his
[46:48] writings you know I mean the Matthew
[46:51] Mark Luke and John talks about son of
[46:53] man but that was what Jesus was saying
[46:55] none of the writers spoke of Paul Peter
[46:58] and John and them didn't speak of son of
[47:00] man why because that was not for that
[47:03] day we'll get to it later when we talk
[47:05] about a dispensation of this and that
[47:07] and the
[47:09] other and but think about it see the
[47:13] only way he could
[47:15] express a
[47:19] father the way he wanted it
[47:23] done was to become a son of man
[47:28] see then can't you see that as he spoke
[47:30] the word he was literally the parables
[47:33] in the things was literally
[47:36] speaking his seed
[47:40] word into being right that's
[47:44] right he literally
[47:47] created did by his own words that's
[47:52] right the bride amen that would come
[47:55] forth on the day of
[47:58] Pentecost that way he could be the
[48:01] father he wanted to be right not it's
[48:05] just like a father to be a Creator I
[48:07] mean come on you just have kids and then
[48:09] you throw them away you know well you're
[48:12] not a
[48:14] father you're a father when you got to
[48:16] put up with all their problems and
[48:18] troubles you you got to do
[48:22] as you know Terrence did yesterday being
[48:25] Grandpa he he's done it before but he
[48:28] learned how to change
[48:31] diaper well that was a different part of
[48:33] life that he'd never experienced
[48:35] probably cuz I doubt he ever changed one
[48:36] of the boys yeah I mean I don't know I'm
[48:39] just saying that you Lisa say no so you
[48:43] know
[48:45] and I can't you know I'm I know I'm mean
[48:48] and arrogant but I try to get you to
[48:50] life a little bit oh brother
[48:52] Joe
[48:54] Canada he used to haul his kids cuz they
[48:59] live not too far he would haul his kids
[49:02] when something happened that Rachel had
[49:04] to be gone and Joe had the kids and one
[49:07] of them you know he could get that uh TT
[49:11] diaper you know but when it come to the
[49:13] other one he put the kid in the car and
[49:16] drive it a mile up on the hill to his
[49:19] sister to get her to change the baby I
[49:23] didn't know that was what was going on
[49:25] they were house one time and we were
[49:27] keeping josi you know me and him and
[49:31] Richard well Richard didn't know that
[49:33] much that it was that big of a problem
[49:36] and Joe was trying to change the diaper
[49:39] oh my Lord I'd have been glad to one in
[49:40] there and changed it and I didn't know
[49:43] it but they were in there and Jo
[49:46] and got these things all over his head
[49:51] he's trying his best
[49:52] to what are you getting at brother Dale
[49:55] I'm not trying to be funny I'm just
[49:56] telling it like it is see brother Joe
[49:58] experienced the part of being a father
[50:00] that's
[50:01] right I mean he'd experienced a part of
[50:04] being a father by fathering the
[50:07] child but he'd never
[50:10] experienced what was going to take place
[50:14] next well is that right
[50:18] that's so God he could be father by
[50:23] creating and by creating ad and Eve and
[50:27] no matter what went wrong you still
[50:29] would have the part of him could show
[50:32] himself as being father right through
[50:35] the Old
[50:36] Testament you
[50:38] know but yet that was not what he
[50:43] wanted and then we see then that the
[50:46] bride then as we said a moment ago was
[50:50] to be what she was to be him made
[50:53] manifest and if he was the corn of wheat
[50:56] that went into the ground or would abide
[50:58] alone then the bride would have to go
[51:01] into the ground which would be that same
[51:03] one seed it's not seeds of many as
[51:06] Galatians 3:16
[51:08] say see he's not a seed and we're seeds
[51:10] of many we him made manifest that's
[51:14] right all right see then he wanted a
[51:17] bride right amen why because it was part
[51:20] of him
[51:21] right so he begin to speak the bride
[51:25] into existence am and they begin to talk
[51:28] about her as having to go into the
[51:29] ground
[51:30] also right he began to speak of his
[51:33] bride and his The Parables read The
[51:35] Parables over and over the kingdom of
[51:37] God is liken them brother Bob done a
[51:38] good job the other day this past
[51:41] Wednesday speaking of that one about the
[51:43] the uh three measures of meal see that
[51:46] that's even argued that he probably
[51:47] might not even know that's been argued
[51:49] in the message people that that ain't
[51:52] right you
[51:54] know well see you talk about leav yeah
[51:58] well no you can't have no word
[52:01] leav well that Parable says the kingdom
[52:04] of God is lik UN to
[52:08] leaven well that was organized religion
[52:10] put
[52:14] in maybe he didn't even know that that
[52:16] was really what that was he was right on
[52:18] the line I thoroughly enjoyed his
[52:20] message you know I I think it was the
[52:22] best he done that was just my way of
[52:25] saying it that's best he's preach
[52:28] but think about
[52:32] it when he was on Earth that son of man
[52:36] had a whole lot more meaning than just
[52:38] God in human flesh right amen
[52:41] true he didn't have a natural seed that
[52:44] he
[52:45] sowed he had the word right that he
[52:49] sowed all right and then that word could
[52:52] come alive in the people and the people
[52:54] on the de Pentecost was his children his
[52:57] offspring as he wanted it to be that's
[53:01] why in the Old Testament you don't have
[53:02] sons and daughters of God because the
[53:05] Holy Ghost had not been given the
[53:07] ability to be that had not done and he
[53:08] had not spoke them into existence right
[53:11] that was what I was trying to get out
[53:12] Sunday he had not spoken into
[53:17] existence he had to come and speak it
[53:20] right before it could be made a
[53:23] reality all right but see then this
[53:26] whole seven Church ages is the reality
[53:28] of God's
[53:32] family and to return back to the
[53:34] original grain again in the end time
[53:39] right and to be God made manifest and
[53:43] like I kept trying to tell you when I'm
[53:44] talking about God made manifest today in
[53:46] his fullness in his bride I'm not
[53:49] meaning just this end time group of
[53:52] people that's come out of Lady o sea
[53:55] that would only be part of God I'm
[53:57] talking about the whole bride of
[54:01] Christ all those Church ages the book of
[54:04] Acts and all the bride of
[54:07] Christ can be the fullness of the
[54:09] godhead bodily cuz remember you and I as
[54:12] individuals cannot be the
[54:14] fullness but as a group right come
[54:19] on this is just the dispensation or the
[54:23] time I I wish you'd do me a favor until
[54:26] I get back and preach on it I wish you'd
[54:28] look up dispensation brother ry's
[54:30] message and I'd like to hear your
[54:32] explanation of why that he emphatically
[54:34] states in the scripture does a
[54:36] dispensation of the Gentiles you know
[54:38] the word dispensation is not used there
[54:40] in the Gentiles it used a
[54:42] time but why would he turn around and
[54:44] say I'm I'm a dispensationalist and if
[54:47] you don't believe in dispensations what
[54:49] do you going to do with the scripture
[54:50] then he turns around and said I'm not
[54:51] much on being I'm not much of a
[54:54] dispensationalist
[54:56] three times he says
[55:00] it what does he mean right that's
[55:03] exactly
[55:05] right first off I'll tell you the word
[55:08] dispensationalist is not even in the
[55:11] dictionary you know not the old Websters
[55:13] it may be in the modern day forms you
[55:17] know but it's dispensation is there
[55:20] dispensational but not
[55:23] dispensationalist he had his own word
[55:25] but he had a meaning for that he had a
[55:27] reason for saying it but why would a
[55:29] prophet say he was a dispensation then
[55:31] he says he wasn't a
[55:35] dispensation you might have find out
[55:37] what a dispensation is
[55:41] right see that's why I try to keep
[55:43] something dangling you know remember the
[55:44] old story I don't mean you're dumb in
[55:46] the MU but you know the old story of the
[55:47] donkey and you know and the guy trying
[55:49] to get it to go and and he's sitting
[55:51] back on the wagon and Donkey won't go
[55:53] and he just sticks a carrot out in front
[55:55] front of
[55:57] it that old donkey goes after that
[56:00] carrot you know what he does he pulls
[56:01] the
[56:03] wagon I try to keep something ahead of
[56:06] you for you to think right and study it
[56:10] I love for you to
[56:13] study you I love to have questions and
[56:17] answers and listen to people talk about
[56:21] their
[56:23] God I definitely love to talk about mine
[56:27] but now
[56:30] watch he wanted to
[56:34] express himself as the father that he
[56:37] wanted to
[56:38] be that the Old Testament never
[56:46] achieved all right then the prophet gets
[56:48] down to the end of that he says that it
[56:51] was one of the three-fold purposes was
[56:53] to express him himself identify himself
[56:58] with human
[56:59] beings he said well he did that in the
[57:01] Old Testament H to reveal himself in
[57:09] Christ he never revealed himself back
[57:11] there to those
[57:12] people he did the best he could amen and
[57:16] they done the best they could
[57:17] understanding that's right but they
[57:18] didn't have the new birth what do you
[57:20] following me then
[57:22] yes his very purpose is to uh I'm trying
[57:28] to make this to you that are here to
[57:30] understand it to make it for everybody
[57:32] to understand the then when Jesus Christ
[57:36] came upon the Earth he came for a
[57:39] purpose of dying
[57:41] right to pay the price for our sins all
[57:44] right now in doing that then he was not
[57:48] only paying the price for our sins he
[57:51] was achieving what he wanted to do
[57:56] that's right that's why he kept saying
[57:58] son of man
[58:02] right now you don't pull quotes on me
[58:05] cuz I I I love them but you know where
[58:08] brother rown says and he'll say it he
[58:09] said now he never called himself Son of
[58:12] God well I can give you a quote where
[58:14] brother R said he did call himself Son
[58:16] of God so don't get all tied up and
[58:19] Tangled with
[58:21] quotes get what he's talking about it
[58:24] was never a dispensation of the Son of
[58:27] God while he was here it was the
[58:29] dispensation of son of
[58:31] man all right right see then because he
[58:34] was wanting to be a father that could
[58:37] bring into being his
[58:40] family remember we were in
[58:45] him remember he came here with us in him
[58:50] we didn't come here as everybody's
[58:52] trying to teach it today all these Seed
[58:54] doctrine that we come here with a God in
[58:58] us you getting the wrong
[59:01] way but he came here with us in him Eve
[59:06] wasn't in Adam I mean Adam wasn't in Eve
[59:09] Eve was in Adam a little bit different
[59:11] sir that's right all right see and
[59:14] understanding it then trying to look at
[59:16] it and see that God's purpose has always
[59:19] have been to reveal himself that's right
[59:22] but you know what he's always used
[59:23] mankind to reveal
[59:26] himself whereas once he was in one man
[59:29] to stand up on
[59:30] Earth and that's why he said the works
[59:33] that I do the thing I he said you'll do
[59:36] greater right well there's no way of
[59:39] doing greater than what he done go we
[59:41] can't die for the people's sins right
[59:45] but it means more
[59:47] amen why because now he's in a many
[59:50] membered body around the
[59:53] world not just in a bunch of Lites
[59:56] that's right that's why you become an
[59:59] i is when you think you're the only
[1:00:03] I you're the only one that's got it no
[1:00:06] I've never taught nothing like that in
[1:00:07] all the 50 years I've been preaching
[1:00:09] this message
[1:00:11] almost cuz I started out believing that
[1:00:13] God would be in his church in the end
[1:00:15] time and manifest himself that way and I
[1:00:18] still believe that and I won't be
[1:00:20] satisfied until I see it and when if I
[1:00:23] don't make it you have to go put me in
[1:00:25] that grave and you sprinkle a little
[1:00:27] dirt over me and just say he still
[1:00:31] believed it and right on my Tombstone
[1:00:34] I'm looking forward to you getting me
[1:00:36] out of
[1:00:38] here right why because I believe in a
[1:00:41] god living in the
[1:00:43] people a God in heaven is not worth
[1:00:46] nothing that's no more than a totem
[1:00:51] pole right God in the original in the
[1:00:54] beginning when man sinned he didn't go
[1:00:57] back up into heaven and stay
[1:01:00] there he came down in the garden and
[1:01:03] actually made the first murder he killed
[1:01:05] the first animal himself to make an
[1:01:08] atonement with the Skins to put on Adam
[1:01:11] and Eve right well I guess you think
[1:01:14] that he what he done he just created he
[1:01:16] he spoke skins into
[1:01:20] existence it's all right you believe
[1:01:22] what you want to
[1:01:23] believe cuz I've got a problem when I'm
[1:01:25] reading the prophet then when he said
[1:01:27] those bloody skins was flapping on the
[1:01:31] legs of Adam and Eve as they were
[1:01:33] walking out of the
[1:01:37] garden how do you think you'd
[1:01:39] feel you know you don't have no clothes
[1:01:42] you need something I go down there and I
[1:01:43] just grab this cow or something
[1:01:45] especially for me to have to have one
[1:01:46] big enough and you know and then this
[1:01:49] while it's still bloody just wrap that
[1:01:51] around you boy I made you some
[1:01:53] clothes man a stinking
[1:01:56] mess how long you think it's going to
[1:01:58] take that thing to dry and even when it
[1:02:00] dries it still
[1:02:03] stinks
[1:02:10] right it's lot different than what we
[1:02:12] think it is
[1:02:14] amen but you see church God wants to
[1:02:17] live in his
[1:02:19] church as we say he took our place why
[1:02:23] right so that we could take his
[1:02:26] place but we're not Catholic see the
[1:02:29] Catholic believe the pope is instead of
[1:02:33] God no that's
[1:02:35] incorrect if he said he was in God's
[1:02:37] stead I don't have no problem going
[1:02:39] along with him
[1:02:41] right right any Minister as I said a
[1:02:44] while ago as an
[1:02:46] intercessor right he is the one trying
[1:02:49] to lead you to God but he's not the one
[1:02:51] to be worshiped come on Amen
[1:02:56] right all right see then looking at it
[1:02:59] to find try to find ourselves in the
[1:03:01] word right and to see in the word what
[1:03:05] God says we are right
[1:03:07] right all
[1:03:12] right I love that scripture where he
[1:03:14] says I in
[1:03:17] you and you and
[1:03:21] me now you can understand I in you right
[1:03:26] because he come down come in you but how
[1:03:29] about you in me right amen that changes
[1:03:32] things a little bit around don't it
[1:03:34] right see God is trying his best to get
[1:03:36] you and I to see who we
[1:03:40] are and to believe who we are amen come
[1:03:44] understand about Martin Luther what good
[1:03:46] would it been for him to protest
[1:03:47] everything and every week he's out there
[1:03:49] this it that's it nobody didn't believe
[1:03:52] it well he could have preached the rest
[1:03:54] of his life away and the pope would have
[1:03:56] just laughed at it that's right but when
[1:03:58] the people begin to
[1:04:02] believe what Luther said and stop going
[1:04:05] to their
[1:04:08] Penance right right then they begin to
[1:04:12] lose the money and they got
[1:04:15] concerned
[1:04:17] y you want to know what's going to cause
[1:04:19] the devil to come after you and I we've
[1:04:22] been in this for 40 something years
[1:04:23] talking about the devil coming after the
[1:04:25] bride right you know what's going to do
[1:04:27] that is the same thing he said that I
[1:04:30] gave you the other day when the people
[1:04:32] begin to say I and my father are one and
[1:04:34] these other things right the devil's
[1:04:38] going to get mad at you well I I heard
[1:04:40] brother so and preach a sermon 40 years
[1:04:42] ago I my father's one yeah he went off
[1:04:44] in
[1:04:49] polygamy now he wouldn't saying that by
[1:04:53] revelation
[1:04:55] right he was saying by hi knowledge it's
[1:04:58] not when you and I quote anything by hi
[1:05:00] knowledge right it's when it's first
[1:05:04] revealed and you can see that what does
[1:05:07] God do first he makes it manifest right
[1:05:10] then he reveals that he's manifest then
[1:05:13] he'll make it a manifestation to
[1:05:17] others when are we going to believe who
[1:05:19] we
[1:05:20] are and what we're doing
[1:05:23] here well we're just here to go to
[1:05:25] church and be good people we're just
[1:05:27] waiting on the bus to pull up you know
[1:05:29] then this thing's going to be over with
[1:05:30] well like I told you if it don't pull up
[1:05:32] pretty quick I'll see you at the nursing
[1:05:36] home CU for you hear me preach you're
[1:05:38] going to have to be
[1:05:40] there you know what cuz that's where I'm
[1:05:43] going to
[1:05:43] be Terence them done got it all picked
[1:05:46] out oh Lord which
[1:05:49] one
[1:05:51] huh what you see Church
[1:05:55] Why not start talking about who we
[1:06:02] are but
[1:06:04] yet right get off of it get on your
[1:06:07] message listen if I can read from the
[1:06:14] prophet and the prophet will say that
[1:06:17] the bride will be the fullness of the
[1:06:19] godhead
[1:06:23] bodily but see we want to believe that
[1:06:26] brother brandham was the
[1:06:28] fullness now that will never
[1:06:33] work John on patmas only represented the
[1:06:36] bride he was not the whole bride he was
[1:06:39] only in representation that's
[1:06:42] right you see we've had the day of the
[1:06:45] Prophet we've had the Eagles on
[1:06:47] everybody's building as I say while to
[1:06:49] go but when is it going to come to the
[1:06:50] time when somebody start
[1:06:52] saying I I am the message you remember
[1:06:57] the Welch Revival and the guy standing
[1:06:58] there you know and the fell went up to
[1:07:00] him and said where's the Revival he said
[1:07:02] I'm the Revival well you know he meant
[1:07:05] it that's
[1:07:07] right that's right that's where the
[1:07:09] Revival was at well I've been having a
[1:07:11] Revival ever since I've been in this
[1:07:13] message I don't have to be pumped up
[1:07:15] every
[1:07:17] day you know boy I love to hear over
[1:07:19] brother on he just pumped me up I don't
[1:07:21] have to be pumped up
[1:07:25] I stay pumped
[1:07:28] up because I believe the reality of
[1:07:31] God's word am and then it's being made
[1:07:34] manifest yes that's right but when are
[1:07:37] we going to believe it all right but if
[1:07:41] I can read to you what he says about it
[1:07:43] then at least you can see that's why
[1:07:44] people won't come and argue with me
[1:07:46] about things because they know that I
[1:07:48] prove
[1:07:50] it well there's no need of coming cuz
[1:07:52] like I said don't come and tell well
[1:07:54] brother Dale I don't believe that the
[1:07:56] bride will be the fullness of the
[1:07:57] godhead bodily oh my well who are
[1:08:03] you are we basing it all on you no no no
[1:08:07] brother so and so said it oh well if
[1:08:10] brother so and so is contrary to brother
[1:08:12] random then brother so and so is wrong I
[1:08:13] don't care who he is you me who he is
[1:08:16] he's
[1:08:19] wrong that's the stand I take and I've
[1:08:22] always took it Hallelujah so I don't
[1:08:24] have to py patter
[1:08:27] around I'm straight plain and
[1:08:30] blunt but I want you to show me where
[1:08:33] I'm off the
[1:08:35] word cuz if you don't then you go run
[1:08:37] your mouth about me then you talk to
[1:08:42] God you got to settle that with him cuz
[1:08:44] you ain't settle it with me cuz I ain't
[1:08:46] nothing
[1:08:47] anyway it's just what I believe cuz this
[1:08:50] is not something
[1:08:52] new no
[1:08:56] 70s we were talking about it brother Mo
[1:08:58] preaching statue of perfect man in
[1:09:05] 1971 1969 I was saying the Bride of
[1:09:09] Jesus Christ is the son of man
[1:09:15] than so it's not something new to talk
[1:09:20] about because I believe it's old as the
[1:09:23] Bible is
[1:09:24] yes you know right yes cuz I I believe
[1:09:28] that's where I got it from was from the
[1:09:29] prophet of God bringing us the Bible
[1:09:31] right to speak to us about it all right
[1:09:34] so let's start reading a few then we'll
[1:09:36] you
[1:09:37] know maybe I didn't lose too much but
[1:09:40] doing but sometimes you have to go your
[1:09:43] way go ahead with number one a and let's
[1:09:46] pick up these things and move on some of
[1:09:48] these quotes some of them you had from
[1:09:50] last week but then I just kind of pulled
[1:09:53] over a little a little bit retitled them
[1:09:55] re Reed them and brought them for today
[1:09:59] cuz I wish you'd keep these that's the
[1:10:00] purpose I made them for
[1:10:02] you the purpose I made them for you to
[1:10:05] take that home with you now if you don't
[1:10:08] believe me my my little curing case is
[1:10:12] in the office you know what I do when I
[1:10:14] believe something I got a lot of them in
[1:10:17] there and I just take that and I fold
[1:10:18] that up and I stick it in my Bible
[1:10:22] case yes
[1:10:24] you
[1:10:26] know and then when somebody says
[1:10:28] something I say well read
[1:10:31] it
[1:10:33] you this is what I believe read
[1:10:36] it then I don't have to have the
[1:10:38] computer don't you're
[1:10:41] wonderful but I have what the man has
[1:10:43] said You know
[1:10:46] here and if I can say he said it then I
[1:10:49] keep that with me I honor these things
[1:10:52] and know I will when we get on to the
[1:10:53] son of man a little further on in I I
[1:10:55] want you to do the same again take them
[1:10:57] fold them up put them in your Bible keep
[1:10:59] them with
[1:11:01] you and somebody comes along they say I
[1:11:03] heard your pastor preaching about son of
[1:11:05] man where do you ever get anything like
[1:11:09] that he got it from the prophet read
[1:11:13] it that way you ain't got to argue with
[1:11:15] nobody that's true that's right you can
[1:11:19] just show him what the prophet
[1:11:21] said right now we believe that the Bible
[1:11:24] said in him dwelt the fullness of the
[1:11:26] godhead bodily right
[1:11:31] right we believe that same God dwells in
[1:11:34] a many membered body as we read that
[1:11:37] he's the head of the body
[1:11:41] amen then in doing that why can't we
[1:11:46] believe that we are his
[1:11:48] offspring as Paul said over in the book
[1:11:51] of
[1:11:52] Acts what why can't we believe that
[1:11:54] we're the children of God well now in a
[1:11:57] way I guess you can
[1:12:00] say come on that ain't even good Baptist
[1:12:04] had more knowledge of that in the
[1:12:05] Baptist Church in that way I at least
[1:12:08] tried to believe
[1:12:13] it so let's just read a few look what he
[1:12:16] says
[1:12:17] here on the message sir as we would see
[1:12:21] Jesus 1957 8 before the evening service
[1:12:24] paragraph or E
[1:12:27] three there's many different gifts that
[1:12:30] God has to his
[1:12:31] church but they're all for the
[1:12:34] perfecting of this church to
[1:12:37] bring together in unity the great body
[1:12:40] of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:42] Christ the powers that was in Christ has
[1:12:47] been given to his church correct
[1:12:52] amen does that need
[1:12:57] interpreting you know do we need a a
[1:13:00] discourse to explain
[1:13:04] that he said it I believe it that's
[1:13:07] right all
[1:13:09] right well in a way well I want you to
[1:13:13] give me the quote where he says in a
[1:13:17] way cuz I'll give you the quot where he
[1:13:19] says when you say it's in a way that he
[1:13:21] says that can't be that's right because
[1:13:23] that's a direct quote when he says you
[1:13:25] say it's in a way he says it's not in a
[1:13:28] way it's either right or wrong
[1:13:32] right all
[1:13:33] right all the powers that was in Christ
[1:13:36] has been given to his
[1:13:38] church all that God was he poured into
[1:13:42] Christ and Christ was God manifest on
[1:13:44] Earth and all that Christ was he poured
[1:13:47] into his church and all the powers that
[1:13:51] God had rest in Christ and the fullness
[1:13:55] of Christ rest in his
[1:14:00] church so what a
[1:14:02] people this should
[1:14:05] be what a people you and I should be if
[1:14:08] that was the only statement we
[1:14:13] had what a group of people you and I
[1:14:16] should be that's right
[1:14:21] amen how many times did Brother br make
[1:14:23] that statement all God was he poured in
[1:14:25] Christ all Christ poured into the church
[1:14:27] take it back to the Garden of Eden run
[1:14:29] it into your computer and just tell me
[1:14:30] how many times he said that
[1:14:36] hundreds but do we believe that
[1:14:39] yes well brother so and so said he
[1:14:42] didn't know because you
[1:14:45] know brother so and so must be your
[1:14:52] God
[1:14:54] right well you shouldn't be that
[1:14:57] arrogant why
[1:15:01] not this is life or death to me that's
[1:15:06] right what is it to you that's
[1:15:10] right this a good thing to be around a
[1:15:13] group of
[1:15:14] people my Lord you have better
[1:15:16] Fellowship over in the Baptist
[1:15:19] church and they listen to you more right
[1:15:25] wouldn't look like a SED bunch of
[1:15:28] prunes I amen what I believe when you
[1:15:31] don't amen you don't believe it cut done
[1:15:37] settled
[1:15:39] okay I don't back
[1:15:43] off number two look what he says from
[1:15:45] Christ's mystery God
[1:15:48] reveal preach in 63 728 paragraph
[1:15:52] 372 where once partly Moses had him okay
[1:15:58] partly David had him oh my but here he
[1:16:02] is manifested in the fullness come on
[1:16:05] now deity himself standing on earth now
[1:16:09] that's talking about Jesus Christ right
[1:16:11] God in his fullness to die for the sin
[1:16:14] of the people that he might bring to
[1:16:17] that he might bring to his church a
[1:16:19] Sanctified life that he might have the
[1:16:22] preeminence in fullness in his church y
[1:16:26] to manifest every promise in these last
[1:16:28] days that he promised for the last days
[1:16:31] well what listen now are you just pinch
[1:16:34] yourself a little bit now what does he
[1:16:37] mean pinch yourself
[1:16:39] just in other words not necessarily
[1:16:42] cause you sound asleep and
[1:16:45] snoring pinch yourself can you
[1:16:49] believe I can believe it when I see it
[1:16:53] you're out of the scripture
[1:16:56] right I believe to
[1:16:59] see right the goodness of God
[1:17:04] Amen you read all in between roll it on
[1:17:06] up where we can see the rest of it
[1:17:09] paragraph
[1:17:10] 375 and through that purpose he achieved
[1:17:13] a
[1:17:14] church that he the fullness of God might
[1:17:17] bring to pass ever promised word of God
[1:17:20] in these last days when he gets to
[1:17:22] preach
[1:17:23] I agree with that right I wrote it on
[1:17:25] mine you know pinch yourself
[1:17:28] why can we let this word go through US
[1:17:32] yes and him be the preeminent well I
[1:17:34] just don't see him in
[1:17:37] preeminence that's problem
[1:17:40] Oh what is your concept concept of
[1:17:47] preeminence well when I see a people
[1:17:49] that somebody get the word every move
[1:17:51] they might God told me to do it God told
[1:17:52] me to do it God told me to do it God
[1:17:54] told me to do it now you show me brother
[1:17:55] brandham that's right I'll argue with
[1:17:59] you I'll argue with him with you about
[1:18:01] where that he was told to go a certain
[1:18:03] way in Africa
[1:18:06] right God told him to go that's right
[1:18:09] but because the people were backing him
[1:18:13] he told Billy Paul we've got to go with
[1:18:19] them
[1:18:21] oh
[1:18:23] but you see we want to get everything to
[1:18:26] what we think
[1:18:30] preeminence I believe he had preeminence
[1:18:32] in Martin
[1:18:35] Luther while he was sitting in the pub
[1:18:37] drinking beer that's right nargan
[1:18:39] Doctrine that's
[1:18:42] right don't you think God was pleased to
[1:18:44] dwell in Martin
[1:18:46] Luther come on that's right the Bible
[1:18:50] says he's pleased to dwell right but you
[1:18:52] see we've got our own mind our concept
[1:18:55] of a
[1:18:57] preeminence as to be some great
[1:19:01] height and our height is so high until
[1:19:03] no one will ever be able to reach
[1:19:08] it it's always a little out of our
[1:19:13] reach
[1:19:17] right but that's our concept of
[1:19:19] preeminence that's right but see when I
[1:19:23] start talking like that then you think I
[1:19:24] don't believe in living the right life
[1:19:26] I've done told you before I don't
[1:19:27] believe in living the right
[1:19:29] life I don't believe in living
[1:19:32] good you said brother Dale you mean you
[1:19:35] go I didn't say that I said I didn't
[1:19:37] believe in living good I believe in
[1:19:38] being born again and let God live
[1:19:43] right cuz the best I can do is no
[1:19:47] good there filthy rags in his
[1:19:50] sight that's right but you see that's
[1:19:53] where people just take little statement
[1:19:55] like that put that on the internet now
[1:19:58] cut it he said he didn't believe in
[1:19:59] living good well I guess he believes in
[1:20:02] it's going out living like the
[1:20:04] devil no if you live like the devil
[1:20:06] that's who you are
[1:20:08] right
[1:20:11] right come
[1:20:14] on see I do
[1:20:19] believe that we to be striving for a
[1:20:22] closer walk with God every day and that
[1:20:25] the opening of his word order to create
[1:20:27] a hunger in our
[1:20:29] hearts of striving to try to walk in his
[1:20:33] word until
[1:20:37] he you know what gets
[1:20:40] me 99% of you are sitting there and
[1:20:42] looking at me staring and you think this
[1:20:45] sister don't understand what I'm talking
[1:20:46] about she shaking her
[1:20:49] head that's what makes me sick
[1:20:53] I don't care where it's my family or who
[1:20:54] it
[1:20:55] is I speak it like it
[1:20:58] is well they they don't understand they
[1:21:01] might understand more than you
[1:21:05] do
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:10] sorry not sorry for what I say sorry I
[1:21:13] had to say it preeminence I believe in a
[1:21:17] place coming I believe God got a
[1:21:19] preeminence in brother
[1:21:21] brandom yes
[1:21:23] right that he was just walking as
[1:21:24] straight as he could go but yet he had
[1:21:27] problems and human thought because he
[1:21:28] was a human
[1:21:30] being I believe he had pre prence in
[1:21:33] Jesus Christ don't you and he said I do
[1:21:35] nothing until my father shows me that's
[1:21:37] it that's right around said he didn't do
[1:21:40] nothing until he seen a vision come
[1:21:46] on okay right brother D get back on your
[1:21:50] message when he gets a preeminence I
[1:21:53] believe this is the only age that he
[1:21:55] could achieve a preeminence that he
[1:21:57] wants I do believe that because it's the
[1:22:01] only age that's got the
[1:22:04] word all right look pre in the church
[1:22:08] the position his place in the
[1:22:11] church Jesus said he that believeth on
[1:22:14] me the works that I do shall he also
[1:22:18] even more than this shall he do I
[1:22:21] explained that that's not different
[1:22:22] that's just more because there's more of
[1:22:24] us all right before I go to my father
[1:22:27] see that was his purpose there was the
[1:22:31] manifestation and now today he wants to
[1:22:33] get a get somebody that can see it that
[1:22:36] they can let the
[1:22:41] word they can let the word go through
[1:22:43] them
[1:22:44] right okay and what is he call
[1:22:47] them don't forget what we're talking
[1:22:51] about that he
[1:22:54] said in the quote above what all the
[1:22:58] powers that God has rest in his church
[1:23:01] that's
[1:23:07] right
[1:23:11] right come
[1:23:13] on look at number
[1:23:15] three we would see Jesus
[1:23:21] 62712 e
[1:23:23] 53 same thing tonight now he's talking
[1:23:26] about fullness of the godhead bodily was
[1:23:28] in Christ and see other people had it by
[1:23:31] measure we believe that we believe none
[1:23:33] of us has the fullness of the godhead
[1:23:35] bod I don't believe brother randam had
[1:23:37] the fullness of the godhead
[1:23:39] Bly all now I'm going to make a
[1:23:41] statement that's going to really strong
[1:23:43] hit you cuz you better realize and
[1:23:44] follow the message right when Jesus was
[1:23:47] a baby he was almighty God but the
[1:23:52] fullness was not made manifest he could
[1:23:54] not die for our sins right as a
[1:23:59] baby he could argue with the priest when
[1:24:01] he was 11 12 years old or something but
[1:24:04] that was total not total preeminence was
[1:24:07] it where does brother brandham bring the
[1:24:09] fullness of the godhead bodily into
[1:24:12] being on the River
[1:24:16] Jordan
[1:24:18] right see because then he was capable of
[1:24:21] doing all that God was required of on
[1:24:23] earth dying for the people and the times
[1:24:27] so you see what I'm talking about
[1:24:30] yes the same thing tonight by the holy
[1:24:33] ghost that would be enough right there
[1:24:35] without even a quote of what says God on
[1:24:37] the day of Pentecost that Pillar of Fire
[1:24:39] broke into many tongues of fire fork
[1:24:43] Fork tongues and said God was separating
[1:24:46] himself among the
[1:24:48] people that day God was in one person
[1:24:52] Christ
[1:24:53] now he's in the entire church
[1:24:57] Universal and he says
[1:24:59] amen and he's not just in
[1:25:02] Lula he's
[1:25:06] Universal Lula by itself not the full
[1:25:09] well what God's done he just put all his
[1:25:11] godhead into Lula because he brought
[1:25:12] everybody here they're here from Africa
[1:25:14] they're here from Zimbabwe they're here
[1:25:16] from Guyana they're from
[1:25:19] all no I've never taught you that and
[1:25:23] you know it I've always taught that
[1:25:24] around the world the Bride of Jesus
[1:25:28] Christ will
[1:25:30] be God made
[1:25:34] manifest and you know what without them
[1:25:37] you and I are not
[1:25:40] perfect the bride around the world right
[1:25:46] Universal we just have a little part
[1:25:50] right even if we have the part
[1:25:54] right come
[1:25:56] on but look what he
[1:26:00] says that day God was in one person
[1:26:02] Christ now he's in the entire church
[1:26:07] Universal all right look at the next
[1:26:09] one choice the
[1:26:12] father
[1:26:14] 1954 81 E34 I believe the baptism of the
[1:26:19] Holy Ghost and all the fullness of God
[1:26:22] is raining down on the church
[1:26:28] today see this is going to make
[1:26:32] people
[1:26:34] unbelievers and I realize when I'm
[1:26:36] preaching this message today and making
[1:26:38] it as strong as I am it's going to make
[1:26:40] people hear unbelievers cuz you're not
[1:26:42] going to believe what he says you're
[1:26:45] going to believe what somebody told you
[1:26:47] or some concept that you've
[1:26:51] got so it's going to make unbelievers
[1:26:54] okay so look I believe the baptism of
[1:26:57] the Holy Ghost and all the fullness of
[1:26:59] God is raining down on the church today
[1:27:01] it's far whosoever
[1:27:03] will no we PR predestinated y okay God
[1:27:10] promised it in his word that's right
[1:27:12] what did he promise in his word that his
[1:27:15] fullness Would Rain Down
[1:27:17] amen he promised it that's right it's
[1:27:21] our
[1:27:22] let's take it look let's go over and
[1:27:25] possess the
[1:27:26] ground now they God didn't go over there
[1:27:29] and kill all the Philistines and the
[1:27:31] amorites and so forth and swipe it and
[1:27:33] say now come on in folks that ain't
[1:27:36] God's way of doing it he gives you the
[1:27:39] promise and says go get her I love that
[1:27:43] that's right Divine healings yours
[1:27:46] tonight go get it God promised you could
[1:27:50] walk and you could walk and you could
[1:27:52] walk and you could walk and you can see
[1:27:56] that's right and whatever is God
[1:27:58] promised it to you let's go get it God
[1:28:02] said so he's as if he ain't as good as
[1:28:07] his
[1:28:09] word then he's not
[1:28:12] God there you go let's go possess it
[1:28:15] ourselves God is in his word do you
[1:28:19] believe
[1:28:20] it God is waiting on somebody to just
[1:28:22] step out and believe what he
[1:28:26] says that's right he'll make it manifest
[1:28:30] you don't have to we're not trying to
[1:28:32] pop up things and make this out we're
[1:28:33] just trying to believe what he
[1:28:37] says whatever God promised why can't we
[1:28:39] believe it but of course we can take
[1:28:42] healing and we can take
[1:28:44] salvation right well I just don't
[1:28:48] believe nobody I don't believe the bride
[1:28:50] will ever be the fullness of godhead
[1:28:51] body brother so and so said
[1:28:54] that and I can call the name that said
[1:28:56] that they said he didn't believe in
[1:29:00] it but what does it
[1:29:04] matter I don't believe it I don't
[1:29:06] believe what the man
[1:29:09] said so I believe what the prophet
[1:29:15] said amen but I believe one
[1:29:19] thing if we don't go get it
[1:29:22] it's not for
[1:29:25] us
[1:29:27] right if we don't go get it it's not for
[1:29:32] us all right so let's go get it now
[1:29:36] we're not the
[1:29:39] uh prophets you know that was
[1:29:42] facing and it had already been
[1:29:45] said that they were going to be down

[1:30:05] dumb this man says we be down our 70 and
[1:30:08] this guy don't say we ain't going why
[1:30:10] didn't that man get up there and say
[1:30:11] thus sayith the Lord we ain't going
[1:30:12] that's right
[1:30:14] right he knew he had to hold it so he
[1:30:18] held it we'd be done it two years right
[1:30:22] I said two years he said 70 let's see
[1:30:24] which one's
[1:30:26] right let's go get
[1:30:30] it if he ain't as good as his
[1:30:33] word then he's not God that's right but
[1:30:37] when are we going to believe it amen
[1:30:40] let's go possess it it's ours that's
[1:30:42] right okay look at the next
[1:30:45] one we'll get this in real quick I don't
[1:30:48] want to get this one because of the
[1:30:49] wording is all right look what he says
[1:30:51] in the the India trip trip report India
[1:30:55] trip report in 1957 126b the e70 he's
[1:31:01] bringing it down the economy of God the
[1:31:02] ministry is the
[1:31:04] chemical can use those chemicals the way
[1:31:07] he wants
[1:31:07] to it's just not as much of it he's
[1:31:11] talking about you and I
[1:31:14] right I I'm not all of God you're not
[1:31:16] all of God brother random wasn't all of
[1:31:20] God right right
[1:31:23] now think of it but all
[1:31:28] together I didn't make that statement
[1:31:30] because remember your Prophet explained
[1:31:34] why it says
[1:31:35] more he said because it's in a greater
[1:31:38] group I didn't make this
[1:31:40] statement but all together it's more of
[1:31:44] it than was in the one
[1:31:48] amen right amen now you see why he said
[1:31:51] it cuz cuz he's got a many member body
[1:31:53] around the world yes right yes see the
[1:31:56] fullness of God is in his church
[1:32:03] yes but we have the spirit with measure
[1:32:07] or by measure that's scripture that's
[1:32:10] exactly right that's why I believe he
[1:32:12] gave you the quote world of ghost
[1:32:13] Universal come on musicians let
[1:32:17] one but the Bride of Jesus
[1:32:20] Christ is God made
[1:32:23] manifest in another
[1:32:25] form called a bride the same
[1:32:30] God well I just don't believe that we
[1:32:33] can ever be well all
[1:32:40] right why can't we believe it
[1:32:43] though well if I could see it I believe
[1:32:48] it Psalms
[1:32:50] 27:13 I had fainted unless I had
[1:32:54] believed to see the goodness of
[1:32:59] God seeing's not
[1:33:02] believing you can see it you don't have
[1:33:04] to believe it it's a scientific
[1:33:07] fact right see then what do we
[1:33:12] believe we believe God's word or we
[1:33:14] going to believe our own
[1:33:16] ideas our own concept our own
[1:33:19] thoughts well I got it right
[1:33:24] yeah you have to believe what you want
[1:33:29] to but why don't you let the world know
[1:33:32] what you
[1:33:40] believe I guarantee
[1:33:42] you you
[1:33:45] ministers you go out there and tell them
[1:33:47] like it is who you really believe the
[1:33:50] Bride of Jesus Christ is is and you're
[1:33:53] going to lose a lot of
[1:33:58] invitations but if you sof so it you
[1:34:00] know round about a way you get to go
[1:34:04] yeah but just tell them like it
[1:34:09] is of what you
[1:34:12] believe and you see how long you going
[1:34:14] to
[1:34:20] stay CU when you begin to say I and my
[1:34:23] father are
[1:34:24] one the Shuck's going to pull away let's
[1:34:27] stand together go ahead 650 650 in this
[1:34:31] power
[1:34:33] book all
[1:34:37] is is it keep these quotes and
[1:34:43] read put them in your records and keep
[1:34:48] them I spend great time
[1:34:53] but try to accumulate these to where you
[1:34:55] can read
[1:35:01] them believe what he
[1:35:05] said we believe
[1:35:07] the prophet's
[1:35:09] message as I said I believe the message
[1:35:12] is
[1:35:13] infallible but the man was not
[1:35:16] infallible he made mistakes he made
[1:35:19] speech errors he made
[1:35:25] things with the message he
[1:35:30] brought
[1:35:33] Moses the message Moses brought was
[1:35:36] right
[1:35:39] right and when he smoked a
[1:35:43] rock that was the word of God and out
[1:35:47] came
[1:35:49] water but when he SM it the second time
[1:35:52] in Anger said must we F fet you rebels
[1:35:56] water from the Rock brother around said
[1:35:58] he set up a
[1:36:00] denomination see he broke every top in
[1:36:02] the
[1:36:04] Bible so
[1:36:06] Moses wasn't
[1:36:11] infallible the real message he brought
[1:36:15] was Luther had problems
[1:36:20] trinitarianism message he
[1:36:23] brought the
[1:36:25] truth is
[1:36:32] infallible
