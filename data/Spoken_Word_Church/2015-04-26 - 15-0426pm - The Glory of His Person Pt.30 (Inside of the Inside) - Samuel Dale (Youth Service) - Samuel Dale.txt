Revelation 1 Ezekiel 36. now remember brother Louise will be preaching this coming Wednesday the Lord willing then the Bible study will be this coming Saturday six o'clock then brother prakash will be with us on Wednesday the 6th of May and then remember the Father's Day fishing trip the times are together and the Fourth of July and the meetings coming up so remember all of these I mean and just pray at the Lord would be with each one amen let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you that we love you we desire one thing from you and that is to be able to understand what you're trying to say unto us and it was brought unto us by way of the Prophet messenger so we don't have to worry about it whose word it is we know whose it is it's your word and we pray that you would just bless us and give us understanding ears to hear Lord and you do as we were singing that you would Open the Eyes of our heart that Lord we may see you forgive our sins lead us by thine understanding and just direct us in your loving grace in Jesus name amen so we'll go to Revelations 1 . now turn to see the voice that Spate with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool that's white as snow in his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined Bryce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters all right now we should be catching on to that's part of what we're covering now because we've come through the bringing up to the the New Testament form and then talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's what these things are talking about the description of him during that time now let's go to Ezekiel 36 and we'll read we'll go to verse 26. a new heart also would I give you in a new spirit when I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and give you an heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I've got a couple announcements to make a couple of little things to say before we get into the message so you know bear with me a moment and think about it now we've observed sometimes the kids outside and kids were very proud of you and we know your kids and we know you act like kids and we're not condemning you for acting like kids but we are a church and we have to handle things to make sure you know that we can be safe and everything going right so now kids I know you play sometimes pretty rough I've even gotten on to you a few times myself about running around with sticks and that are sharpened off and pointing at each other you know the boys now the girls don't do that too much but boys they you know they get into a lot of things but be careful because you can get hurt you could hurt somebody and it wouldn't be no good of saying well it wasn't my fault that won't put an eye back in a socket it won't cause something to heal up that's hurting and damaged for life so what you're playing and and your doings and uh you know uh stay basically on our playground don't be going over on the other part even it's a good parking lot over there but don't be going over there because the one main thing is if you go over there we can't say nothing if they come over here and that's why I instruct you not to play basketball at a certain time when we meet here and you've kind of got away from that but like on Wednesdays and things don't play ball and on Sunday mornings and things don't play ball out there because it invites other kids to come and want to play and and I'll rock that and we don't care about doing but we don't want nobody to have problems and things uh the playground is is dire for you to use but use it rightfully into doing so don't don't go over there and play in the hers and don't go up in front of the building up in over here I've seen a lot of you do do it you have been known to get up on the air conditioner machines out there and been standing out there on things and you know just kind of cool it down just a little bit on the basis of not being too doing and now mama and daddy I've always told you you know if somebody comes and tells you that your kids are doing things uh don't you get upset with them because they're told of me to do it especially so I instruct the deacons to kind of mull around a little bit in between in different parts of the service and for them to correct the children and have them to do things correctly you know and play correctly and and not be into the dangers of anything because we don't want somebody to get hurt we try our best to have you the playgrounds to where you can do we've got three sections of playgrounds and uh you know slides and different things so try to do it according to um the right order and when you're out there you know the little bitty ones are over here playing down on their bottom part of it over there and and of the playground and you know don't be running backwards and forth by them and all and running and doing because you're going to hurt somebody and you know you don't uh Mama didn't want you hurt when you was little but now mommies and daddies remember that okay remember you didn't want your kid hurt you know well they're they're you know they're only like grown some of them grown up now but still that doesn't uh make things in the right order for you to do so just kind of you know control yourselves and not being too rough and playing with the kids and we haven't got a set order that these have got to play here and these have got to play here and that one there we do have a set order of of little ones about them in the next group is the older ones in the bigger kids needs to stay up on this top end up here and you have your own things and doings and you know and let some of the kids play and throughout our you know take care of each other don't be uh harmful to each other oh you say well that they're they're not up here where we're they're not here where we're we are well then go get somebody and let them direct them out of the way and make sure everything's all right keep it going in a safe and insane matter you know to where you can can do and uh you know have everything indecently in order now uh we uh we have a little problem with one thing that we need to cover that um sometimes kids are kids but they are a little bit on the wrong side about being kids and uh sometimes they kind of uh make light of each other or whatever and uh you know don't do that kids uh don't think because you're our One race that you can make fun of another race brother Dale will get upset with you in a hurry when you start trying to do those things because that's not correct everybody is the same here it's not you know that we have a the answer we have of that or we have a Dale Clan and nobody else is not allowed the reason the Dale Clan's in charge of a lot of things is because they will do their jobs offices and things and you know a lot of you wouldn't take the job so somebody's got to do it so it's not that but don't be making light of nobody because just remember you might lie to somebody somebody gonna lie to you and you know it's not fun it's not doing it's not uh nice to to do anything contrary to one to the other of the kids all of your kids are the same and kids are good they can get over it and all like that but it still hurts feelings for the kids sometimes to you know maybe pull a little back pull a little back and play themselves and don't let the others everybody play together we try to make a playground where you can play together and have a good time and all like that but just let it be that you'll do it in order and not making no uh points of separating in sides you know to pull away or to do anything and uh you know you'd say well uh they don't want to play with me well then next day you won't want to play with them so that's that's kids but that shouldn't be we're trying to be Christians you know children we're trying to be Christians and you get somebody come in and they see you doing little things and that doesn't work too good especially when you're kind of I could Yaki over and pull this pie outside and get your little groups and parties and things you shouldn't do that as a matter of fact I have tried to contact the person and even I did this morning we had one sister that is not coming to the church now and one of the reasons she's not coming is because her granddaughter was offended by some things somebody here said to her some of the girls and boys or somebody said something to the girl and made her upset and she doesn't want to come to this church well now you you that done that or whatever you done you need to straighten things up because that's your responsibility you know you're responsible for that person you saw that it's they just well that's right well what would it be if it was your child what would you do if it was your child see it changes if we switch it around on the other side defense you know makes things a little bit different if we swap it over you know uh in doing but you know I'm trying to contact the person because we knew they had stopped but not no reason but you know and I've always been if you leave here don't expect me to call you you know because I'm not going to beg you to come back and I wouldn't try to beg anyone to do that but I just felt obligated to if something was said by somebody here an action or reaction that would be anything derogatory to the right order it needs to be dealt with here so you know if you uh you just don't never just remember tomorrow is your day you know that's the best way to say it tomorrow is your day that somebody will be you'll have problems well then you're going to say well you know I didn't do well you know just try to be in the right order and get everything into the point to where that everybody can do because we're trying to win people to the Lord and you can't win people to the Lord if you're making lie to them or are offending them you know or saying things it shouldn't be said uh you know those things they're not winning people you're not trying to be a Christian and and the Lord will deal with you in those orders because if you're doing it deliberately then he will uh work upon you because that's his way of doing it all right so don't do that don't be uh pulling apart don't be doing it don't make lie to nobody you know because you make lie to somebody just remember tomorrow somebody might lie to you it may take a while before somebody does it but then you'll feel bad and you'll realize so just don't do it to nobody else why can't you just love each other have a good time for the kids to be playing together and oh you got your buddies you got your partners and plans you know and doings all like that and let me say it to do it I see a lot of you adults it's even worse than the kids too because some of you adults won't even speak to each other hardly some of you probably haven't shook hands with each other in six months when we're all supposed to be in the body of Christ if you notice I don't stop with one person you know what it is most pastors or preachers go out and get a little group you know I'll go around and Shake Hands whenever one of you if I don't shake your hand on Sunday it's not my fault it's yours because you you didn't hang around long enough for me to do that because I want to be friends to everybody because that way I want everybody to be friends to me whether it be little kids big kids or or whatever it be that it did it be that way all right so just make everything and get all of your playing together in the right and and Don't Leave Nobody out and you know of your playings and your doings have a good time together and fellowship together and make it to be that way now I'm going to go ahead and mention this part too because it's been mentioned to me about the youth camps all right I've had bad taste about youth camps that I don't like and for some reasons you know things but the church will pay for your children the child's registration fee for them to go to Youth Camp but it won't pay for no adults to go to carry them because that would be derogatory to some of the others that can't go that would like to go and to do so we just don't do it but I said now if you you take your child to you camp it's your responsibility to get them there back home into doings it's not our responsibility we take no responsibility whatsoever for your child if you don't want them to go to the youth camps that's fine if you want them to go I'll say it again and keep saying it we will pay the tuition fee or what it costs you know the child to go and do we'll pay that but we won't pay for somebody else to take them because if we pay for somebody to take them we're responsible the church van is set up to where there's only certain ones in the church can drive it and the reason is because of the insurance if you would be willing to go and do something you might get on the insurance but you know what you got to go you got to go to two days of a driver's education you got to have two days of it before you can qualify or either linked and they do the insurance kind of allows the CDL license they allow that part because that's the doings but adults see it's it's just not a it's not a whole bunch can drive the van so we can't say well we're going to send a van to Youth Camp because that way we're going to be taking your responsibility you take your kids do what you want to take them to you count do the things we'll pay for the tuition but not your not your expenses for Mom and Daddy to go or anybody else to go we'll pay just for the kids tuition and then that way if they go you come to us we'll give you the money for paying for that but we will not pay for anybody to go and you know drop off your kids and go somewhere and visit with somebody else because that doesn't that are lazy I swear I'm against some of the youth camps now if I ever did run you if I ever have anything to do with youth counts which we did all right we had adults that were supposed to go along and sometimes they didn't do it and they got put off of it from me as to not do it anymore because they didn't go and do the order the way I said it I said go there be a director be a youth counselor be in with our children and make sure they behave themselves and and do a woman with the girls band with the boys all right you know like that so we we tried to do those things but to just solve the problem of any situations if you want to take your kids to Youth Camp you feel free to do that's up to you but we won't pay for nothing other than the child itself that's the registration will fee all right then that way whatever you do if you're taking them there and dropping them off that's your responsibility I would be very careful about the youth camps you know and all like that because they can be problems happen and you can't correct it like I was talking about a while ago you run around here with a stick or you get out here kids a lot of times we'll be down adults will be under the outside thing and the kids some of you older boys and girls come running through well don't do that you can hurt somebody you can knock down one of these little bitty kids and you knock somebody down well it wasn't my fault it is if you're running out there when you're not and you could knock somebody lose an eyelid and make a arm broken you could and it'll never be repaired so just don't do it don't come down you know we used to we had the little kids they would ride their little wheel I made a Mark and I said don't bring that little stroller really you're riding in no further than right here because adults was out there walking around you know you try to be safe it's a whole lot better to be safe than it is sorry a couple of Fellers here one time throwed some rocks and then up a car and you know what they paid for the car to be fixed so if I was your mom's and dads and I told you not to do it you know I said don't do them things now brother Dale's instructed if I was your daddy and and you went out there and throw the rock or throw the ball and you know accidents can happen but if you do the wrong uh you'd pay for it your allowance would be taken care of to make you pay for heart you know because you're told not to do it try to be nice try to be Christians about everything have a good time hey we don't go off you know brother Dale don't holler and scream about all these things like these other churches do hey come on folks you're older ones I don't like what the kids are doing today you had your ducktail haircuts and bell bottom pants right you had your day and the things that was done in your day would you and my day was just like the things that kids are doing now you know I have more trouble out of adults than I do kids because kids generally understand me all right but okay try to keep that right or that you're not playing rough you respect each other on the playgrounds and things and you you kind of stay to where you're supposed to be the bigger kids for the bigger kids you know and the little ones were the little ones and the the doings and and not be throwing off on things and don't be throwing off on somebody else please don't that's not that's not even good scent let alone Christianity Christianity doesn't make light of anybody you know I went to school one of you kids had never been there my brother when he was in school they knew every day when he was walking down the hall because they took my daddy's shoes and cut the toes off and left him and I've got the old wood or the old metal thing that you laid the shoe on you know to beat it down I've got that of my daddy's and you know and they could hear him coming down the hall because he didn't have nothing but a big old heel and a little short thing on the front but we was poor you know sometimes people can't afford fancy clothes like others don't make fun of nobody because they can't you know no no don't do that don't make lie to nobody about anything respect everybody is a person I've always been able when I worked at General Motors I worked with a lot of people that that was the first years that we had the mixed races into the black people coming in working it at General Motors you know and all I never had no trouble with any of them because I believe everybody's a human being right they don't matter about the color of your skin you can't help but color your skin you can't help it be another way but you can hit what you do you can help about all the other things you know trying to be bigger than or better than somebody else just be yourself all right and let it be nice and kind okay a lot of things I guess we should cover but just remember what we've said you know let it be a Christian attitude not making fun of somebody else because the minute you make fun of somebody else the devil is going to have somebody make fun of you and you're going to find it out and but it'll be too late it's the best thing to do is just don't do it start with don't be in any way adults children or whatever don't make fun of nobody because of their raisins and their doings and their clothes and their things just don't do it if not a good Christian attitude we'll just have a good time okay all right take that as from Brother Dale and just remember that we're trying to be a group of Christians living for Christ and trying to win people instead of running them off and that way then you can do it all right now we left off this morning so we'll try to pick up part of the morning's message and continue on into what we're talking about but what was the point we were talking about this morning that I kept emphasizing and I want to keep on emphasizing that point to you that the new birth the prophet said you need the new birth more than anything in the world all right because you don't have the new birth you're not born again if you don't have the new birth you're not going to be in heaven as the bride of Christ you're not going to be in those things you're going to be left out because you won't do it all right in that new birth as we will cover review a little bit we saw that it does not take place in the body it does not take place in the spirit so that would do away with all of your things that you would try to depend upon as to call it your salvation and you know that I'm right that you you ask most people uh are you born again and they'll they'll tell you know like and then we kind of Life at the the one where brother random said you know they said well something about are you a Christian said I'll have you know I burn a can to live or not we'll see with life and say well what has that got to do with it but you know what somebody else is looking down on down the road to you to look at it and you say well you know are you a Christian I speak in tongues right well somebody's looking down at that and saying that ain't right because you can do that every day your life will still be lost well I believe the message now there is a certain point there that is true if you really believed there wouldn't be any problem we'll have to cover that that Lord believe is about that long because it starts from just a knowledge and goes all the way to or even who job would say I know he didn't say I think or hope so I know My Redeemer liveth all right but see that new birth takes place in the soul not in the body in the spirit what you do outwardly of anything you can call it speaking in tongues shouting crying you know and brother Brown said the living we read this morning people living even a Christian Life he said you know living good doing good loving the Lord because he don't love the Lord with your body all right you love the Lord with your spirit because your soul is either one of the two it would be love or it would be hate because it has to be one of the two it's either God or the devil right so really the love that we're interested in and the thoughts is dealing with the realm that we call the spirit realm of mankind the second realm of mankind which is memory reason conscience affections things all right and you can do every bit of that go to church all of your life see we didn't know that years ago did we we never heard that taught in an organizational religion we could hear certain things but not like that the it's not that form because when the prophet came I'll read I think it was in this morning or I'll read it this evening he said and you say you believe me as a prophet in other words he said why don't you listen to what I'm saying right if you say you believe in the prophet listen to what he says uh because that's the only way that we can can handle it all right you see you could be anointed on your spirit with the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit now I may hit it this afternoon but I would advise you to listen for a few services this is not just a six and seven message of you must be born again I warn you this message has cost me a lot in sleep and everything else because there's a lot of things that I know I'm responsible for explaining right because somewhere it's got to be explained for us to understand it I just believe it what do you believe you know what do you believe you know we really didn't know what we believed until the prophet came right we thought we believe a lot of things you know but it's kind of like brother Adam said he said I used to think that Jesus loved me and God hated me now he was honest enough to say it but he said I found out it was self-sane person you know all right but see the new birth cannot take place in your body because the body without the spirit is dead and if New Birth took place there then it wouldn't matter about the spirit of whatever if it took place in the body all right then it cannot take place in the spirit Realm because then Satan can be there all right now remember he is in the soul of us as the nature away you know until we're born again but then when we're born again he's not there anymore because he can't do it and God won't dwell in an unclean vessel so don't think that is that it's God and the devil in there together now when brother Branham explained it he didn't put it that way he said in me now is too dog white dog black dog all right that don't mean the devil is in your soul that's one thing I've taught from the beginning with you that the devil can't be in your soul at the same time God's there that won't work all right because that would that would mess up the entire Bible all right now I say this because somebody on the tape could click on we are using the points of what the prophet is going to be saying in the opening of the word in the bases that he would talk about body spirit and soul when is his early Ministry he would interrelate that sometimes and make it bring it that way but the basics he would bring it as body Soul and Spirit all right but he didn't have to correct it because he wasn't wrong in the senses of that he always gave the bodies he takes feel smell in your he always gave the second Rim whether he called it Soul or Spirit or being or what it was always memory reason conscience and affection all right and he always gave the center him one cents either Faith or doubt either God or the devil you know he always kept it lined up so he didn't have to be come back well I don't know where he corrected that at going over after the opening of the seals and just read and you'll find out and then in no way am I saying was he wrong back there that's what I'm saying maybe it was left to Blind a lot of people because a lot of your doctrines are based upon the early Ministry and not understanding the getting together to me I believe he was a prophet in the old you know the early Ministry needs a prophet in the later Ministry but I believe the word opened to the prophet I believe as he progressed the word open into it that would be Hebrews 4 12. see and that would be I believe that's right where it says it it it brings it to the point of dividing Soul and Spirit joint and Mara all right the scripture then would be correct because in no way you could you say the spirit that sinneth it shall die the Bible don't say that the Bible says the soul that Sinners shall die all right we need to deal a lot about this Spirit Realm to think about it as to be in the bases that were Satan has his greatest uh hand into or dwells the most and don't ever think as the prophet said that any way that we are any of us a match for the devil just just get that plane yeah there's no way for us to be the match for the devil now the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a match for the devil but you've got to admit a lot of times we don't yield to that if you don't you're going to find it out you know eventually but see we say God tells us this and God tells us that right right and see then that way we base everything upon something that we believe as to be what God does well what if that's not true you know what if it's the devil it was telling us that and what even as it we were covering there in one service what even if it if it'll come among you to try you to see whether or not you will stay with the truth right see then you got to go back to the word you can't go nowhere else will have been around to that right because you know what I believe what is the new birth brother Dale it's the word revealed to you personally right because it can't be anything else it can't be shouting speaking in tongues crime all them things is good but the new birth takes place in the soul of man and then outwardly the spirit displaced what's in the soul and the the body displays what the spirit is doing all right but the main thing is that inside of the inside now that's what we're going to be talking about a little bit when we get down to it in a minute but I want you to to just think about it and we're going to drop back to the morning message pick up number seven brothers which will be coming from the future home all right and I want us to read this because to me it's a wonderful expression of Truth and to me it takes out a lot of of ideas and things that people has had you know they're saying now and the people of the message are saying well uh the new birth now just the baptism well you can have that on your spirit and die and go to hell now all you got oh but you don't understand what we're talking about baptism I agree with you I don't understand what you're talking about on baptism I mean I agree with you no problem because to me baptism is baptism one of these days I'm going to show you or to preach to you what I believe the new birth is I haven't preached it in 40 something years there's been a secret was left there that I couldn't explain and there's still a lot of things I can't explain but I wait on him all right go look what he says he said first time Christ ever dealt with me coming down such a boy I've always taught those three stages of Grace absolutely now why is it now that they're saying that he taught different stages different things it means they don't they're not saying he's the prophet see he's always taught three processes this is 19 and 64. I mean to you that believe you'd believe after the seals but not before but just remember that point and look what he says now and I love this because to me it explains my Christian Journey it explains my new birth and what took place to me so if nothing else buy with me reading what took place to me I mean you may have got this boy you just jumped right up just promote got everything I'm not saying you didn't but I am saying one time if you have the new birth you had to come through three stages to get it now he's going to explain those three stages justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said well brother Dale you've always told us that when you came into the message that you had been a Baptist a deacon and all kind of things and teachers of all but said you found out you weren't born again well you know what this is the way I found it out I found it out by reading a man talking about an experience and just remember brother random says one of the Mysteries is to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without a sensation but he never said to have a new birth or anything without an experience an experience is something you live through a sensation is a stimulation upon your flesh out through from your spirit Realm right so then listen and see if this what happened to you and maybe you'd say well I don't remember that happening to me well maybe you you need to follow the channel and let that happen right right I mentioned one time not too long ago and I got one person to agree that what if I come out here one day and said I think that everybody in here order to get baptized again I said 90 98 of the people that say I was baptized rights start with and I don't need to get baptized again but what is it is it if you do I've baptized a lot of people that was baptized correctly because they come and said I didn't understand I didn't know I didn't follow that okay you see you blessed God I've been baptized correctly now why are you getting upset right I ain't why are you getting all boiled over about something well you decide to get us to do something again I've been baptized three times one time in a river right down here well I would have got to the new bridge it kills for father son the Holy Ghost good old Baptist went back and heard of this message and we were planning to go over there and they used to have a lot of baptisms at that Creek because the day we were planning to go back the best I remember there were two Church groups standing in line waiting to baptize at that River that's the best I can remember it now and remote said well what we're going to do I said I I don't have to be baptized in the same water called don't mind no dear but I said I do want to know where that same water runs good and deep until we drove back up a quarter of a mile turn and went down in the woods went to the same Creek I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we went to Israel and out of 26 I believe it was 24 probably Believers of the message my wife and I and Brother Dean and sister Peggy Gibby we were the only four that got baptized in the River Jordan got a lot of them said I've been baptized correctly I don't what are y'all getting baptized again for I said if I come back again I'll do it again don't bother me I ain't denying nothing I love it I'm kind of like old brother Willie Ross and I heard him telling and most of you remember him but he said he went up to Jeff the first time and I believe it was brother Solomon was with him and they had said something about getting baptized and they had been baptized correctly he said oh he said no Willie Willie said now now Solomon you just keep your mouth shut we're going to get some more of this because they wanted to be baptized again all right but you see but get back to the story he said he'd always talked three stages of Grace well now anything you read anywhere if that statement is correct then line it up to that statement and then now he's going to explain this three stages that way you'll keep it correct now watch it starts then he says now the first step is repentance towards God then followers after that is water baptism water baptism repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism followers showing that repentance was genuine well when I found out I was baptized wrong I didn't have any trouble saying I want to make it right right because I wanted it to be and then I found out the name and all the things but watch what he says showing that the repentance was genuine now you can talk people into a lot of things and I believe that's what happens to a lot of people and it's not a genuine repentance now because see we could spend days on this teaching see you don't want a genuine repentance is the Bible says the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance right the Bible says no one can come to the father but by me is that what Jesus said if I misphrase just to hire you put it right in order but it's pretty close to the scripture see nobody can come unless they're called but then we've got another scripture that many are called and what few are chosen now we're still in the Bible all right she's showing that you're genuine in other words genuine repentance it means you realize that you were wrong and you're sorry for that right now words are cheap until you go to a lawyer it's going to cost too far out of you but words are cheap I'm sorry well now we keep going back and doing things over and over again I'm saying I'm sorry it don't work too good right okay showing that repentance was genuine are to remit our past sins that has nothing to do with the future now we know for a certainty that water baptism does not remit so he's not explaining of a remittance of sin right here is where it's remitted it's remitted at genuine repentance we'll get to that if we get to Ezekiel if we don't we'll have it later where it talks about a new heart I'll take away your Stony heart well we didn't get no heart transplant right right all right you see art to remember our past in other words it showed our past are gone not the baptism the repentance shows are doing but the remittance and following the baptism shows that my remittance my sincerity of being genuine that's what's remitting my sins all right see there's nothing to do with your future sins so justification chops off your pie sins has nothing to do with your future you're still just as lost as can be other than your repentance and your believing you might qualify for a foolish virgin that's between God and you but that's it don't have nothing to do see it only remits repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what for remission now there's another word remission because showing that it's written what taking away the past sin has nothing to do with the future just your sins have been chopped off what you did you can't repent for what Adam done you never done it Adam did you just get forgiveness for what you've done the old nature is still there all right now you can argue the point of back in Luther's day and how that much they got it but around and said Luther got the new birth I just found that one the other day I'd always known it where he said the new birth of Wesley under sanctification but he got Luther got the new birth but there wasn't as much required then as you are now but I believe Luther was required to repent and get things straight all right now watch what he says then he goes up and he makes a board and he illustrates on the Blackboard and here is a human heart and here is a human heart now I'm as honest as I can be this is what I believe that's not two hearts that's the same heart but it's showing the stages of the heart you don't make it two people that's fine I could one person over here got this one person got this what if you're gonna make it down to one person bring it down to think about what happens and you'll see a beautiful picture all right now this one over here has a snake in it that sin so he drawed it out in a little line draw and in the snake you know here he has his life that's the center part all right this one over here has a dove in it which is the Holy Spirit here he has a life well this one here ain't going back he has malice hatred Envy that's what's causing it is this fella here something inside of theirs causing him inside of that drawing he made of a heart is causing these things to have hatred in and out this one over here has love and joy and long suffering that's what does it down here and when you are asked are you are forgiven of your sins you only done this taken that away so you can take if you drawed it out with a snake and you draw the little squiggly lines to represent sin and then you drawed the inside core of the person now he says what you've done is you risk release them since see when you repent of your sins that's your past you can't repent of your future you have to wait until that comes we're not Catholicism in trying to be penance no you can't get forgiven of something you ain't done yet right well you do it that's forgiveness For Heaven's Sake don't try to be on what they're saying Lord help me I'm going to go do it no that won't work and watch you only done only done this taking that away but the thing that made you do it is still there okay that's the old root of evil it's still there notice now brother Jesus said the unclean Spirit goeth out of the man he's talking about the root of evil and brother Brown says that the unclean Spirit goes out at sanctification so that's solving the problem noticed in your repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that he forgave you of your sins notice then secretly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right now remember this morning we were explaining the jar in the yard you pick it up you got a reason for doing it you don't go put every stuff in it you take it in the house and you wash it real good then you go put something in it justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost all right secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for wholeness to think right take away sanctification is a compound word now don't confuse this mind with the mind of Christ and don't worry about making the mind too much in relation because your memory reason conscious and affection does work through your mind right all right sanctification is a compound Greek word which means cleanse and set aside for service the next comes the baptism of fire and I love that I love it greatly because when we get around to some of the other things a prophets this Prophet has said that is going to become a very valuable scripture because the Bible says the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire so he brought around and says baptism of fire and Holy Ghost the Bible says baptism beholders and Fire it's going to be needful when we get up there talking about it so I would hold on to that see that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's in us now watch what he's saying throw it back down pull it pull it back down just a little bit all right cleansed our heart from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth the same life that this did all right that Holy Ghost is the life of God coming into you now ask you a question how can God be in you you must consider this valuable to think about how can God get into you into your soul leave the point with you the way on down the road maybe next weekend if we get there but watch roll it up we keep on reading a little bit because he goes through the spirit and the the woman gives a birth into natural birth type of the spiritual birth the baby is born into the kingdom of God he comes the same way water blood spirit now notice sanctification the third stage now watch him second stage of it cleanses the Mind sets the heart the mind of the heart in order of Holiness mind of the heart brain dumping gizzard oh no no not exactly because that ain't the things he's working on a man can repent of sins and still thinking remember repentance does nothing to your future just the past well he's an immoral Manner and more looking every more looking immoral looking woman he finds is still dark maybe he's a drunkard every time he smells the drink it's still thirsty but when but then when he gets Sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him it takes a one of it away watch he can still be tempted but it takes a one of it away still he's not right yet then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire cleanse burnout cleaned up and then put it into the service of God sanctification only sets them aside for service now I'll go ahead and drop a key when it says Holy Ghost and Fire that's not incorrect the way it's placed but you your mind tries to translate that is working and it looks like the Holy Ghost and the fire coming but just remember even though the unclean Spirit has gone out you're still not right yet and we will quote the Prophet this away there's telltale signs of Satan still left even though you've been sanctified amen because what do you got you can't go no further than the work that's been done who are you if the unclean Spirit has gone out you're a clean vessel but to make sure that's right the prophet says you do change it to hold it to Fire and Holy Ghost for your understanding that the fire cleanses everything that's left that's why there's not a lot of new births the in Samuel Dale it was supposed to take out all of those wrong things the fire is to burn it out now you see why that when I heard the truth I remember when I repented don't you I remember the things that we all talk about that a great load of sin went off of your shoulders and you become a different person but you know that and we'll quote brother random somewhere in a few minutes he said you see him turn around in a month from now and be gone well because there's nothing that holds you know I remember when the things of Life begin to come to a stage in me back in the Baptist that I wanted to get rid of those things but I had no one I could talk to about it because they they didn't understand my wordings and I don't understand that I tried to explain it to a lot of people that hey there's just still things wrong and I'd like to know why all right I'd like to know how come things were still working don't you right I like answers to questions and my question has been to you as the church is what if you are truly a born-again Christian sealed by the Holy Spirit truly have it now can you do something wrong who's doing the wrong you can't be the soul because it's eternal but it's got to be your spirit Realm you remember that we've been through this a long time talking about this sanctification it's the most dangerous stage that there is because that anointing can come up on you and you will think you're Christians you will go out and preach the gospel you'll go out and see the sick heel the dead raise the things Judas had part of the ministry of Jesus Christ see it's very easy then to let those things get in your way I told a man one time talking to him I said your problem is you've got a gift and I know his gift work I don't have to explain nothing I just tell you all right I know his gift worked and works but I said that's your problem Brothers here can tell you about a certain brother that we all know not all of us but some of us know he can pray for the sick and they're healed and he's still smoking his pot and probably drinking everything or whatever it is and his problem is that you know what that he's looking at people who claim to be Christians that can't do what he's doing and he says God must love me more than he does you now you're going to argue with him hey he's got too many things stacked on his side you'd argue the point with him because he can pray for the sick and they're healed brother mode I remember that years ago I never will forget it that he was talking about this Russian monk that this guy was a head thing in Russia and every time that the man's boy had some kind of disease some of you that knowed brother mode a long time heard that story I'm sure and every time that baby would get violently sick with that he would call this guy up and the guy could be on a dance floor drunk as a coot stop get down and pray and God heal the child I believe it because that's gifts and callings without repentance you don't repent to get a gift you're either born with one or you don't get one you don't train for a gift you don't exercise something to make it a gift you either got one or don't got it not good English but it's the best way of saying it all right but what are you going to say to a person that they say but I've prayed for 10 12 15 people and they were healed how many of you ever prayed for and seen get healed they got you over a barrel if you don't know the truth because they're telling you a truth me well I just don't believe that happened I'm not going to argue that point that's what I told the brother I said your gift is your problem because you see things and maybe I don't see things like that well it can be a hindrance to you because you think you're greater into that point that's gifts that's what I was talking about this morning you can be Anointed with a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost signs and wonders take place and inside you're still lost that you tell me that's easy understood I'm going to tell you I don't believe so but when brother random began to explain those things I knew I didn't have what he's talking about my repentance was genuine I believe that my sanctification I didn't know to call it that or whatever it was back then but I you know get toward it I didn't care for those things and was trying to live a Christian Life to be honest and sincere you know and to do one illustration and it'll solve a lot of problems I sold a house one time and I made an agreement hand shook with my nephew and she Paige told me getting paid me or nothing just shook my hand and he said I said I'll take so many thousand dollars for the house they're in Guilds well he shook my hand I said it's yours a couple of days later my brother came to me and said I'll give you five thousand dollars profit that's a lot of money back in because that would have been 1971. to a lot of money still a lot of money to me might not be to you but it's still a lot to me he said uh I'll give you five thousand dollars profit I said no you don't understand it's done sold he said well what does that got to do with it you ain't signed no papers I said look my word is my bond it is sold you know what he even done he went and talked to my brother about it and brother's brother and he come back or told me later he said they said you're a dummy go ahead and do it and they'll divide it that's the one who sold it to go ahead and sell it to it and mean you at 225 2 500 a piece I said no your the house is yours that was the way I lived and have tried to live because I believe that away Richard was talking about a while ago going in the store and he could have walked away with about 150 worth of stuff and nobody could have done anything but he went back in and paid the people are you trying to live that honest and sincere had a lot to do with it all right but you see I believe my sanctification was good back there because you know what it brought me to this message my study and letting the word cleanse me and set me aside brought me to this message but then when the prophet began to talk about that baptism of the Holy Ghost not as a when he'd say it's not shouting it's not crying it's not doing it's none of these things he said it's the person of Jesus Christ coming living in you I got to admit there's something wrong you know when I began to seek God and for two years I sought him before I come to an experience that was satisfactory to me you know no I I can tell you great things happen in my experience but none of them do I count a new birth we'll get to them but look what he's saying first is repentance toward God followed into baptism do what it says sanctification sanctification cleansing you and set in your side the unclean Spirit going out that devil going out of that heart that I said is drawn for one with the devil in it and the other one with a dove in it just put them together and put the dove over in another you know I'm not her doctoral issue of a point trying to make a point see sanctification is to cleanse that desire out of you it takes the one of it away you can still be tempted but takes to one of it away you're still not right yet we'll try to drop over and pick up the evening message now okay you see questions and answers on the field 1963 paragraph 52. you see each one of those ages only taking a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the Holy Spirit amen that's why you can be justified and Sanctified and still be lost because the baptism is the Holy Spirit that comes into you and where does it work at it works in your soul you're not justified Sanctified and baptized with the Holy Ghost on your body or spirit I hope this has been enough for that to have gotten away from your thinking but to think about that the new birth is the birth of the Soul then the justifications and the thing work back out of that soul in through the body through the spirit and other people can see that you can deceive people right but you can't deceive God because it'll come to the right place and the one thing it'll come to you'll find this out eventually it'll come down to a basis one day that you're going to be dealing with what the word says then you'll make up your mind whether you're right or not you will decide then whether you're right or not but what is it the new birth is in the soul and being that new birth in that soul it's dealing not with just justification and sanctification that's part of it must be there just as it is the baby must start the process of rejection or ejecting from the body and the water breaks and then the blood and then the baby all right the babies of mine dying the other things are not as important but yet that second I hope you'll think about sanctification is the stage in your life if you want to go to church that you'll want to do what's right and that you'll think about well you know I haven't felt God's presence lately and the prophet said sometimes it was because the Holy Spirit had to go out on a limb and get away from you that don't mean you lost but what if it is that you're just Justified and sanctified so you've got to make your choice as your answer and your answer will determine your destination let's just read a few quotes all right let's start off number one on the evening message and watch what the prophet says on the power of transformation 1965 1031 paragraph 311. that little inside of the inside that's where you start which is your soul then come from that your spirit then you become a living being now the living being has since five senses to contact the second has five senses that's the outside body see text field smelling here the inside body has love conscience and so forth five senses but inside of the inside the control tower it's either God or Satan yeah and you can mimic any of these things you can contact and I sound like you know what do you mean you can't say what he meant but I can say one thing for sure he said you can mimic anything that you get around and learn of anything you contact you can mimic it right brother Gary was here he can talk like everybody in this building because he he mimic it so you men make anything that you're around is that sensible what he's to say all right like like a Christian or you could cast out devils like a Christian but the inside control tower the beginning the origin isn't of God it'll never return to God do you understand did not Jesus did not Judas cast out Devils did not confused the one who condemned him and put him to death even prophesy but he couldn't stay with the word he couldn't do that but he had everything else look what he says on this inside of the inside works his faith expressed paragraph 207 and notice it's got to be five f e i t h outside Spirit Jesus on the inside y o u now that's how standing here looking at you now watch him he's explaining his gift but look what he says that's how standing here looking at you he had the new birth right you know come on you agree you had a new birth right amen but watching that's how standing here looking at you I don't know a one of you well he just didn't know oh okay the spirit can anoint me still I don't know none of you but when the inside of the inside breaks in that's God I'm going to give you a quote that astounded me when I first remember it he said you know this discernment that I have you remember what it called it he said it's a revelation he said just discernment I have you want to quote I think that's fine I wouldn't be making if I didn't know he said it's a revelation well how are you going fool with a revelation you see why he's so certain about that gift that he had and what he was doing he didn't fool with it he didn't make it work it worked him right that's where the outside can reason you take a man say well you know I know if I'm I'm not supposed to commit adultery but you know then the spirit tells me I shouldn't commit adultery but you see way down in there is still that thing in there see it'll kind of govern around and better watch it but when it's directed from the inside it throws all the rest of it together that's the god post that's the control tower the inside of the inside the soul controls the spirit the spirit controls the body show an outside White Horse don't make any difference them religious people back there that Paul called Whited walls and so forth they were outward just every way the a Believer and they had prophecies among them and everything else but the inside of the inside the soul that disbelieved it that's the reason I say people can jump up and down and speak in tongues people can shout their hands on the sick and heal the sick and so forth by faith gifts right by faith all these great things by the spirit still be lost anointed ones all right are you following me look at the next one we'll get a couple of these and then I'll drop off and make the next message out of these look what he says on leadership now look I'm a Pentecostal you say I'm this or whatever you are I profess to dance in the spirit but brother Branham I thought as long as we had that we had it you have it is that the way he's saying see the man said I thought as long as we had that we had it he said you don't you haven't if you believe me to be God's Prophet you listen to my words see that's a deception in this day didn't the Bible say it'd be so close it would deceive the very elect if possible the elected down to the soul yeah but if you dice in the spirit still with the things of the world there's something wrong if you speak with tongues Paul said I can speak with tongues of men and angels and still not even be saved both kinds see I can do all the emotions I can have faith I can preach the gospel I can give all my goods to feed the poor I can carry the word in the mission Fields acrossed and still I'm wrong see and it's see it's that inside of the inside brother your spirit breaking up when you die it takes its flight but your soul lives what about it inside of the inside all right drop back on this Wednesday but I want to get one little point then we'll draw I'm not Wednesday next Sunday you said brother Dale do you believe that of truly born again Christian can do wrong do things wrong certainly do you're not supposed to go out and keep doing it all the time all right we can go over that but you tell me you don't never have a wrong thought right you tell me you never have a wrong call whatsoever I just beat you to the point and I'll call you a liar because if that's what I said that's what I'd be you're louder see Jesus had wrong thoughts do you agree did not The Devil tempt him in all forms turn us into bread do this that do that and the other and brother Robin said he even tempted a women now that's his statement trying to make Jesus in the wrong person but to show him how human that he was now remember his body was created a virgin birth his Spirit was the spirit and Sunder times in diverse manner so then the devil could still tempt him in his Spirit Realm that's why in his Spirit realm dropping back to the word that was within him he turns and he says get behind me he never denied none of his talks and ideas just get behind me don't ever think you'll get to the places you cannot be tempted because you would be wrong but a true Christian where do you do wrong man your body would display what the unbelief or thoughts or you know mad or words you would say or something would come through your body through the vocal cords but that Spirit within you can cause you to do those things and you still even be a truly born-again Christian now I'm as honest as can be I said it to start with I have wrong thoughts well you know if I didn't believe it that way I would be the most horrible person in this building and I would sit down right now and never preach again if I can't leave it to the basis that I do have a sensible answer that within my soul God cannot as John said is seed remaineth in him and the seed cannot sin he didn't say the person the seed came you ever get to the bases that you say I don't do anything wrong just remember the devil's already got you right in the middle of his traps right where he wants you why do we need an advocate if we don't do wrong come on foe Prophet do you sin he said every day see that's why we got to have the advocate after you're born again when you get the advocate you don't get the advocate before you're born again the Holy Ghost is the average I can't even pronounce the word advocate huh that Holy Ghost inside of you he's the one that takes care of all the things you see one of these days maybe it'll Dawn on us a lot of the things is really Bible where it says the spirit maketh intercession with Words that cannot be spoken was he making intercession for if I ain't doing wrong come on well brother Dale it sounded like you mean you just go out and live like the devil I try not to I try to fight him a little I've always tried my best to tell you and when you get to be 75 years old you'll find it out when I retired from General Motors I said I'm not going to sit down because if I go home and sit down my arthritis and all them boogers that I've got all these years they're going to take me and I ain't gonna be able to move so I'm going to fight him if he gets this body he's got a struggle if you don't do that you're giving in to it that's why to me I don't have no problem go to the doctor he said how you doing I said I'm doing wonderful I finally got convinced I got to tell him they were doctor reading them up here I got a bad cold or my legs are hurting help me get rid of this but I'm simply saying by Stripes I'm Healed verse all of these years I stood with that to work the hurting but I still say I'm Healed you keep confessing your healing you know what something you just might one of these days get a good Revelation and it worked you know what but if you don't confess it how can it work s i is that not what it is with salvation that you must confess that you're saved before you can be saved you must confess that you're healed before you can be healed you know somebody one of these days gonna say I'm already changed you know what God's going to make that manifest and just take somebody into the change but you know what we sit around well we're all in bad trip you're in bad shape I'm bad shape it's all in bad shape poor little petty thing really curious daddy said man walks into my office I'm paraphrasing he said I want him to have a positive attitude you can deal with somebody's got a positive attitude right right but if you've got a total negative attitude how can anybody help you you never heard this statement they're dying because they've give up you never heard that because they give up now you know what to call it hospice because hospice comes in then what do they do they can give you away under more pain medicine than a regular doctor they give you all kind of drugs that a regular doctor can't give you why because you already give up his life didn't want to go about it but Aaron was telling about somebody been 18 months on hospice now have you ever heard of that they'll figure out a while that old Feller ain't give up or whatever it is get out of here you ain't give up yet then give out one thing but giving up is a lot of difference what do you think about the new birth I hope these things have been come on brothers been some instructive talks to where we can understand how is it the person of Jesus Christ can come in you and live in you see your mind automatically goes to an anointing it's just a spirit it's just a baptism and a spirit oh we want to put it all in there but you know there's a lot of quotes around talks about you know how the baptism of the spirit and still not be right he said because that's only power and placing you in the body you see we've got a long ways to go I just hope there's enough time well you shouldn't make them statements for one of these days I got to see we think we get it all figured out somebody comes along that knows a little bit about what they're talking about and it's Mass confusion well you know what I know a little bit about electricity I've wired that panel I've done it I can wear a whole house I can do all about it but I sure ain't going to talk to Einstein you know what I ain't gonna talk to Aaron about it either when he can send them the numbers that have no numbers that are numbers fidgetive numbers or whatever you call them imaginary numbers I ain't going to talk to him but I will talk to you about what I do you know what I know the first time I went to Jamaica my wife told him said well honey as much as you know about all of those things that you can help them do a lot of things I got over there and I walked back and I looked at their wiring you know I looked at the panel and I said ain't gonna touch it because they'll start off dealing with 220. they do and they say if we get our all of ours on the 220 because I half your bill because it cost you that much to down it to 110.
