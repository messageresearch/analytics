master of the wind oh it's good to know that it's good to know him [Music] you know a lot of people in your life but if you know the master of the wind you don't need to know anybody else oh he's the master of the Wind you know you can you can um you can know a lot of people you can say I know this and boy people love the name drop I know this one I know that one I'm kin to this one I'm kin to that one well hello somebody so anyway uh to know the master of the wind to know the one that created this whole thing we know him and we just don't know him we know him intimately hey man we know where to find him we're not looking for him we know where to find him this world's looking for peace we have the Principe this world's looking for um a stability oh my goodness they ain't gonna find it here but if they'll find it as as I was telling brother Bob um that was that today in Bible study in Sunday school class was a masterpiece that is how you teach Sunday school class amen and the subject he taught that was wonderful because the kids weren't up here praise the Lord anyhow y'all have to explain that not me but it's the truth anyhow I mean listen if you think fruit is what got us in the shape we're in you are totally deceived by the Devil Himself amen amen amen and it's hard to talk about some of the things that we do talk about but it only makes sense I was talking to a a person up in Ohio last weekend and uh he's just like uh he's like you know it's like he's got that deer in the headlights look and I said look let me let me ask you something I said what gives you more problems than anything bottom line what gives you the most problem it's either a man or a woman oh y'all don't have that problem well I do and Jim's at home she's not at home she's over her daddy so I can say this she's 200 miles away my greatest problem is me though but what is the greatest problem that we have to face is the lust of the flesh doesn't matter if you can put a white you know A to Z on it the lust of the flesh is what the problem is that's why it started in the Garden of Eden not less than after Apples because I ate one last night and I still got my problems it's on my Weight Watchers program so I can eat all the apples I want and it has not turned me into a better person it may make me skinnier brother George Well skinny ain't in my vocabulary but uh it may make me feel good but I promise you what happened in the garden ain't gonna happen again to a bride of Jesus Christ and actually I got that quote here that brother Bob's gonna have to quit preaching my sermons I'm gonna shut him down now that was truly a masterpiece today that was absolutely the truth and um like I said I was talking to that brother in Ohio he's not he's a brother but he's not a he's not a uh a Believer he uh he we were talking about genealogies and and all that and and I'm like dude they the Bible talks about genealogies right I mean they're so and so but guys so and so and so find me Cain and the lineage of anybody in the Bible not there because he was not of Adam he was of the Beast and then you go over there in the book of Jude it says it says Enoch being the seventh from Adam well if you go from Enoch and you start backing up seven generations if you put Cain in there the Bible's wrong all right so Cain was of that Wicked one he was serpent seed or the seed of the Beast and then he what he went off and went from the presence of God and that's what started the ball rolling all right so um let me make a few announcements uh brother Louise you'll be preaching Wednesday uh remember brother Joe and uh sister Rachel I'll be coming back from uh from Kentucky and I appreciate they they did something for us while they were up there June's always wanted to go visit her stepmom's grave which is in um Rochester Kentucky and they uh the archery shoot was in Owensboro which is just a few miles above it so they stopped by and and facetimed the gravesite for Jim so she could see it so I appreciate that saved me a trip down the club but just remember them they're on their way back um I think Sophia won third place this is a national tournament Sophia Sophia

people's feelings or hurting people feelings listen we are going to make it but we're going to make it by the skin of our teeth we know that but I had rather you come crawling through there and I see your hand marks and your feet marks coming through that door right there and say I made it I made it to church God's going to honor that more than you're sitting on your area in this home saying I got a sniffle right well that's the way I'm going to say it anyway because that's what it is you get lazy then you come in here and you got your pajamas on and you got your drink beside of you and you see where we've come to is that what this is that what this message all about do we have to beg people to come to church I'm going to read us we're going to read here we're going to talk a little bit about the Deep College of the deep because there's got to be a deep there's got to be a deep to respond if you got it deep if you got a deep we got a deep right here then there's a deep to respond it's already there for you so God bless you love you with the love of the Lord I really do I want everybody to make it I pray every day I want everybody to make it in this in this whole place brother time changes next Sunday let's see what does that mean some of y'all are really late it'll be really early or you'll think or you'll think the Raptors done took place so um praise the Lord anyhow it's happened before clock he hadn't changed his clock and brother Luke Daniel said well we want to welcome the late brother smarts with us to me so but you know what with smartphones that shouldn't happen hello somebody Electronics technology it all changes all these are electronic I mean what atomic clocks they all change for us so there's no excuse so at two o'clock in the morning you don't have to get up and change it it just goes click and you're one hour different one way or the other spring forward all right we'll get some more daylight so let's read the the Bible I got you standing so you won't sleep but we're going to continue on the son of man part 92 but we're going to do like we did wins tonight we're going to deviate off just a little bit because I saw something the other day that we really talk about the deep colors of the deep that we need to look at so let's bow our heads remember all these that are not here I know they all want to be here sister Johnny wants to be here and all the different ones they want to be here so bad and we want to pray that the Lord will grant their desire and Grant their wish dear Lord thank you for this day that you give us we appreciate Lord the people Lord the congregation the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord that comes today Lord and has made an effort to get up and put the good clothes on and eat them a meal and drive to Church Father we pray now that you would do one thing not let it return a void not let it be just a place to sit and make up time and and waste time Lord this is you this is eternal this is salvation this is redemption this is all the things that the Bible's told us about we've come down now to the end time and father let us as they say in the world ratchet our game up just a little bit Lord let us sharpen our pencil as that Capstone gets closer and closer it gets more narrower and more narrow Lord I pray that you just bless each one that's sick the ones that are not with us Lord just bless the ones that are in a foreign field Lord doing their work father we pray that you would be the ones Lord that are they're having service I know brother um are down in Beaufort and he's having a service brother Jason Watkins brother Donnie's down there preaching I pray they should bless them Father just take care of us and lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit today Lord you come and speak to the people father and move me out of the way in Jesus name we pray amen Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was there was a transition change the word was the theophany god that was the Creator God that was the logos and that logos then became flesh because as logos he couldn't die for us as Jehovah he couldn't die for us but as Jesus Christ that took on human form he died for us though he can be our Kinfolk he can be our Kinsmen Redeemer and then what happens now he has transferred that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory to glory the only begotten the father full of grace and truth now that word is being made flesh where in you and me and you Jesus is not hearing flesh but he has commissioned us to take on him in human flesh you may be seeing the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word let's read second Peter and for the ones that have been here we've been talking on the Statue of a perfect man according to II Peter 1 verse 5 it says and besides this in other words besides your new birth giving all diligence or fervor or or or you know you look at these people online and you watch them uh watch a football game and they you know it's two degrees outside and they got no shirt on and they got their favorite team's name on their shirt on their chest that's fervor that's somebody that don't I'm not going to say it yeah I am he's not late for the first quarter right and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtually virtual knowledge and all its Temperance Temperance patience and the patience godliness and we'll get to that in just a little bit because be patient with me and your patience possess ye your souls in patience possess you your soul all right let's look at the chart just for a second now this chart is a chart that that the prophet of God told us that this is how the human being now there is no way that we could take brother Michael today and sew him in half it would be ugly and messy and but we could turn him out like that and let you look and they would be Rings like a like a tree there's not that way but but the only way we can show it that we can understand it as a as a whole is to understand it is that that's the way we look it's all it's also intertwined that you can't that you don't have the round circles inside your body like I said before you can't you can't yourself open and see a body no you see the body all right the spirit is talking to you today but the soul down on the inside that's the real you that's the one that's going to do the listening and I hope do the preaching of the word of God today all right and there's only two there's only Faith or doubt there's not the devil and God inside your soul fighting it out back and forth no one has one one has one over the other all right one has w-o-n over the other because you yield to which one you either yield to doubt the reason you yield to doubt is because you don't believe that's really simple but there's either Faith or doubt and that's the holy of holies that's where either God resides or the devil resides and if you're born of natural lendings like brother Bob was talking about natural land that's why I said serpent seed in the garden my Heavens that tells you right now that you're born and sin Bible said born in sin Shepherd iniquity spousal members mother's womb kids are liars sorry kids they all go frowning when you say that you're denying it now we all listen how many times how many times your kids lied to you yeah oh don't even talk about it so anyway so did that come from God does lying come from God no lying comes from the Devil and then all them other things do too but if you get born again in your soul that's the faith of God has come into you give you a birth not a birth like brother the Bible's talking about that's why that birth is our problem Jesus looked at Nicodemus and said you must be born again and Nicodemus goes to the Natural he said do I need to go get back in my mother's womb and be reborn and Jesus said no you got to be born from what above the womb of your mind is now what God's working with everybody with me then the spirit Realm is Imagination conscious memory reason and or reasoning and affection because remember that's what you've got to contact the spirit realm of you today you are listening today you are listening you are conscious that you're sitting in church most of you until a few minutes from now and then your memory you're thinking well that's what brother Brown said that's not what he said that by the Bible said this your your memory is going one way or the other are either remembering that you left your dinner at home and you're gonna have to go back and get it your reasoning your reasoning to the word of God today your reasoning whether I'm telling you the truth or not and then your affection is filial love not agape love because filial love is conditional sorry it is agape love is non-conditional God loved us and he knew what we were going to do and he still loved us and I'll tell you one more thing remember I said before if God ever loved you one time he can't unlove you that ought to make you happy that ought to make you know that you're sealed in if he loved you and he saw that you'd love him back he never unloved you that's right the problem is is we have filial love that looks back and says oh I did this or God must not love me you can't ever say God must not love me you're lying see there you are you never can say God must not love me anymore he can't change his mind you change your mind but those five senses are the spirit realm but they have to be manifested by what this guy the seeing the smelling the hearing the tasting and the feeling and all those see tastes feel smell in here there to contact the world but you can be deceived by all that right you can be deceived by all that um I tell you before you know you June makes a scented soap and you know you can close your oh eyes and smell this bar of soap and you you would you would your senses is telling you that you're smelling a clot of dirt because I'm a deer hunter so she buys this little bottle of stuff it's not much more bigger than that and it says dirt it's liquid but it smells like dirt you close your eyes and smell of it you'd swear somebody had a clot of dirt in their hand but you open your eyes and there's a bar of soap so you can be you in your seat taste still smelling here you can be deceived all right they're by with me in your memory reasons the conscious facts imagination you can be deceived but I promise you one thing if you've got faith inside your soul that part of you cannot be deceived that part of you will tell you I'll crawl to church that part will tell you I'll get here and I'll pray and I'll I'll do the things I'm supposed to do willingly not because I have to I don't I have never since I got born again come to church because I have to and I've been saved now 20 something years never have I done that I gotta go no I gotta go ah gotta go hey man the Deep draws me to that right right my deed didn't draw me to that before he drew me away because there is a deep down inside of you before you get born again and it's that doubt well that's no religion thing I don't know about that well your doubter you're not a Believer you become an unbeliever so let's quit for being unbelievers but now remember excuse me the way we see it the way the Bible teaches us that the soul that sinneth it shall die the soul right the soul the real you that inner person if it sins it dies if it accepts God and God puts itself in there burns the whole part of you out seals you in by the Holy Ghost it cannot fail it cannot get lost it cannot get unloved because it is love everybody with me so there's what we're looking at now when we come to the stature of a perfect man though this guy right here if he's born again he has that is the very soul of God that's the Genesis 1 26 man that God is imparted and he's the only one who can do it he has took a piece of that eternal life and put it in you his brother around said we read the quote not too long ago a little button a little white button God puts a little thing inside of you then what does it do it has to grow amen and we'll talk about in just a minute because remember justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then there's one more part there's a living part there's a word that God has to put inside of you and if it's the word of God it's a Living Word of God I wish somebody get happy my goodness y'all sit there look like this right here all you want to but I'm telling you they something but you know why it's something down inside of you that ain't got nothing and that's Southern language but I don't care cause I promise you you will have a desire for something you'll desire something I don't care what it is you're going to desire something inside your heart because you are a human being and you're built that way man you're three more agencies gonna put you in hell or put you in heaven one of the two absolutely if you go to hell you gotta walk over me you got to walk over the Bible you got to walk over Jesus Christ because he's standing to do one thing for you and I saved your soul not just clean you up and make me a good person and and no no he puts a new person inside there if he puts a new person inside there that desire has got to be of God it can't be of the world anymore now the spirit realm there's our issue it can still be of the world ly influences are they're bombarding us as we speak because those those inlets are not covered but bye Peter telling us how to get them covered by not just the new birth but add to your new birth that's what II Peter's telling us back to your new birth what get that Spirit realm to do what to yield to that one's inside of you because like I said before what I tell you it's First of the Year let it out you're going to one way or the other you're going to prove who you are and the further we get or the closer we get to God you're going to prove who you are you can't help it the Bible tells us that even brother Brown says the Bible tells us that a sinner can't set in the congregation of the righteous there's going to come to time folks when it's death to walk through them doors right there and a nice sense of fire ananias walked in he said I'll give everything Peter said you lied see you didn't lie to me you lied to the Holy Ghost and his wife comes in because she's a co-conspirator she knew what was going on too and God didn't spare her just because she's a woman either they took them both out everybody with me I don't know where that came from but I ain't charging you for that either so let's look here pull it back up everybody understand like I said you can't catch that up you're a unit if you pull the soul out you're dead if you just pull up if you pull the spirit out you're not a human being if you take the flesh off you definitely are in a mess okay because this is what's holding everything together all right so that's what we're looking at today we're working on that Spirit realm can't do anything about your body listen we can paint it prep it take the wrinkles out watch out you don't have any well darling you ain't got a wrinkle nowhere goodness gracious Godly jealousy my brother Godly jealous but you but you I don't care you're still dying we're all dying I remember brother calling he's walking we used to go down General Motors and they had like open house and we go walk brother colleague remember when you know the wheel you did the the tire yeah he'd take a tire you know how much a tire weighs he basically stick his fingers in the in the hole of the tire and take two of them and slap them try it today I'll pay somebody else to do it but that's what that's what when I that we have to be sick nesses of the devil not of God everybody with me so now look we're going to add to your new birth or add to what we're looking here we're adding to that soul of God you're adding not him he is already he's complete but we're human we were born under that as Bob was talking about we're born under the under the uh uh let me just say under the sex Covenant where we should have been born under the spiritual spiritual multiplication over here where it says Genesis 1 says let us make man in our own image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and foul the air and let them multiply and replenish the Earth they weren't even they weren't human bodies so now though God has took this that Satan did and that Eve did and she fell by that and the whole human race went downhill Adam was the one that sold us out folks not Eve Adam's the one that said I'll accept what she done but you know what Christ stood one day I said I'll accept what they did amen Adam you can't do anything about it but I can because I'm God and I'm going to stand in the gap for him and that Eve's not going to fall like that Eve did oh praise the Lord we're going to get into that in just a minute let's go to the look over here so add to your new birth so now I'm born again boy I just you know um you take somebody you know and you you have a child and and sister Pam I tell the people babies they're beautiful they they come to the Earth you know they but now I'm gonna take that baby and I'm gonna go put it in that office shut the door three months later I'm gonna come back and he'll be ah it'll be dead why because you didn't feed it you didn't nourish it God wants children that he can feed he don't mind feeding you but he don't want you to keep drinking milk all the time he wants you to eat meat every once in a while eat some vegetables every once while then what's gonna happen I remember when Michael first started they started coming to church here he was well you could about get him right here I can't get one part of his arm right here now he's six what three close to four what happened his mama fed him well guess what I want my daddy to feed me I want my heavenly father to feed me I haven't walked this 22 years and just still be a baby you shouldn't either if you still have to be told to do stuff you're a baby [Music] ain't that what a kid is a kid has to be told what to do I believe it will brother Louise I'm talking about but now remember everything's all well this message that we're living is is beautiful right but remember we still according to the prophet we got out of Step remember he had a vision he had the church come up first or the Bride come up first she was in preview and now she's listen she's she's safe away in another dimension all right uh we don't believe it's there in heaven you know it's just old Mama wives tale that says I'm you know I'm going to walk streets to go with Jesus no not yet because John saw the city coming down in Revelations 22. it's not over there yet in another dimension because remember where's it coming it's coming here but we know that by what there's a message of the hour that God sent us a prophet and that Prophet cleared the way for us to not understand the prophet more to understand Jesus Christ more to understand this Bible better than anywhere I was thinking in there just before I came out I said man what Bob spoke on today that 30 minutes 90 of the people no 99 of the people in this world do not believe that well that makes Bob wrong then he just he just he's just wronged by the majority no God's one right he made the world he's going to destroy it and he's still going to be one yes so I you know what I put my I put mine on him I'll put my uh all my all my uh whatever it is everything I want to talk about and see is what he's told us in the Bible but I want to see it in Clarity I don't want to see it foggy I don't want to see it where I gotta well how did that happen well I know how that happened so you see how privileged people we are to have Revelation and we'll get to that in just a second we might not get to the to the virtue but we got to cover some things right here but she'll get out of stuff I said another there was a matriarch and the um or a patriarch in the community died and then we had a matriarch a couple days ago she passed away she taught me in Sunday School in the Baptist Church and she was just a as far as a nominal Christians Fannie was wonderful 94 years old Lord let her live a good long life but she passed away and I was sitting there talking to uh one of the I don't know if anyone Baptist or not but it's okay I asked I asked Ray I said y'all Baptist and you got methodists why don't you go to Methodist Church because remember I asked that young boy that several years ago uh Chris Porter I said he said well we don't believe what they believe oh okay so you don't go to the Methodist Church you're Baptist so you go you don't go to Massachusetts because you don't believe what they said actually you're gonna go Catholic no I ain't going to Catholic Church that's the that's you know that's Marco base and so how we all get into heaven they're gonna be like a street down this way for the Pentecostals and a street down there is for the Methodist come on somebody Street down here for the Baptist and the street of course if you're a Baptist your Street's wider and then one for the message no that city is Four Square that City listen I see he's got a wall around it to do what keep the people out why you got walls in your house keep people from seeing what's going on but in that City we're gonna have transparent walk transparent walk because we're not gonna have anything that we need to keep Secret but God still did build a wall what does the wall do it separates amen you all know we all need to be there we all gonna be one there I promise you you don't have no Baptist badge or Pentecostal badge you won't even have a message badge I'll just be happy to get there it doesn't matter what kind of bag y'all wear amen foreign but we're getting out of we were getting out of Step according to this dream and this vision brother Brown saw the bride and then he saw the church in other words that was that was messed up in all these doctrines of water baptism and different things and and trinitarian doctrines that there's no such thing in the Bible and then you got these other things water baptism named father son Holy Ghost you that's exactly what Jesus said but that ain't what he said hey man he said name he didn't say names he said name father's not her name Sons not her name Holy Ghost is not a name right so what is the name the Lord Jesus Christ according to what Peter said if not Peter and Jesus was was one of them was wrong and that you need to carry one of them out of the Bible because they're both in there all right so we come through all that that's why God had to send us a prophet what bring us the entire word of God he took the Loose Ends and put them back together where it happened in a man in the nominational world in in Rome and in all these other places then he sent a Lutheran to Wesley we'll read in just a second but he said the bride comes back because she's Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor listen it's all God if it was up to man we'd just be totally we'd be pitiful but God's got his hand on this thing he knows what he's doing he knows what you'll do with it that's why he give it to you listen he's not going to give you the Holy Ghost to lose you that's right remember he's not a loser Satan's a loser right I hope well he did hear it he's sitting here right now already so but it's a masterpiece God's Building and he's got a plan and a purpose as we said before last Wednesday night a plan is a method of achieving an end so he is going to have a plan to achieve an end a detailed formulation of a program of action you see it right here this is the plan of God this is the will of God this is the only way God will work is by the Bible verse 1100 sermons to make it clear what God was telling us because why did Jesus Jesus stand up and tell him who the story was tell them what this was the Bible said he spoke everything in Parables well I died when Moses was writing the Hey listen Moses wrote what happened in the garden right Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible Moses was old but he wasn't that old but he was sitting there writing and he saw what went on God said hey hide that right hide that from the wise Improvement and we're going to reveal it to babes such as we'll listen and learn what's going on thank God he speaks to us in a mystery that it has to be a revelation for us to see what's going on then as we were talking about this the first church was the first church had these virtues working the middle churches did not even with uh Luther and Wesley they were still caught up in denominationalism but four death Messengers eat it which you're talking about there in the restoration of the bright tree and we see that that happened in Joel Joel promised he said I will restore what these four bugs eat down the caterpillar Palmer worm canker worm and all those different bugs they eat it there what they eat the word down they didn't eat the word they eat the effects of the word down God can't listen God has what a gracious God he does work if you got a little bit of false Doctrine because that's Grace but there's come a time when he said this is it I'm going to send you a prophet in the end time according to Malachi 4. he's going to turn our heart yes Saul back to those Pentecostal fathers and then what are we going to do we're going to take it on to the rapture man if you don't believe this is the end time you're in bad shape you've been deceived never seen such a Sodom commit condition my heavens good Lord we got people running the country telling us what our health is is a transvestite that current administration's filth every one of them's filth but for you to purposely put somebody in there to Health and Human Services and he was a she and she was a he that's what's making our policies now folks listen she was an ugly man she's a real ugly woman now I'm just going to make black black white white I'm telling you but that's who got put into position to tell you what to do with your children and your eats and you're this and that you'd be a Democrat all you want to I don't care but if you can if you can deal with abortion then God forgive you I don't want I'm not I'm not doing no I'm gone I'm done from that what was the third was Pentecost the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost came in 1906 but still they were trinitarians still they had ideas that was contrary to God but God brought back number four which is the word of God and what has life the word of God has life for messengers of righteousness are going to restore listen we are the recipients of that Pentecost is not to recipient of that shock God enjoyed it when he had it but he moved on he moved don't say get back in line I'm telling you today we got to get back in line before we get out of here prophesy son of man that's exactly what happened you heard the son of man Ministry when Bob stood right here and said good morning people you heard the ministry of the son of man praise the Lord valley of dry bones everything got together but one thing happened there was no breath there was no life breathe whole Breath of God breathe what the Breath of God is life what the fourth was the word itself I just read you in the beginning was the what word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh so the fourth was the word Jesus Christ was the Living Word standing in two feet in a human body that gave his life for me and you so that he could walk into feet in a human body in a bride but he took the word coming back in power the word itself is here today not just an idea what my priest today is not an idea it's the whole Bible come on the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally looked Christ has finally in other words he's finally got somebody he could work through 100 percent work through sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and Christ has again centered himself like that cap of the pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism the Holocaust then the coming of the cap who was he he was the Chief Cornerstone but he was the headstone they couldn't take him as The Headstone so they killed him but he said I'm coming back as the Chief Cornerstone I'm going to start this thing with a bride and a foundation on the day of Pentecost 2000 years ago and I'm going to build my church the way I want it built he couldn't build his church in the Old Testament he couldn't build his church in Bob Garden of Eden he got cut off yeah and in the Old Testament the blood of bulls and ghosts could only cover amen remember what I said to you the other day think about it he's a high priest of what he didn't say he's a high priest of your faith y'all I gotta have faith he's the high priest of your confession if you confess negative he has to stand before the father and do this think about that he can only take a positive confession to God so who stopped us take your finger don't point it at me take your finger and go Sarah don't point at your mama we're our biggest enemy we know that you know somebody don't have to tell you that we're our worst enemy but if we will what yield ourselves to God do the vice versa brother Brian said boy that's a complete revelation if you stand you give money away what is it that Holy Ghost bunch that Holy Ghost Bunch y'all y'all are now a bunch that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had oh we gave priests like Jesus we are preaching like Jesus Ministry that's what he said he said and Ephesians he sent Apostles prophets past what to teach what Jesus said be happy it's to us sorry about getting excited but I just something stirring look because the hunter what the chairs your car the airplane the drums yeah they'll catch you the whole thing in the Rapture where the Justified Sanctified baptism the whole ghost that pyramid will stand again I declare to you today he's standing here today oh I believe that bro I believe that the house of God will live again it's going to live in a group of people I promise you that the tree of life is growing again we're at this Wednesday night I want to read it one more time Ezekiel 47 3 if you'll pay attention you can take that off if you want to um when a man that had the line in his hand went forth Eastward he measured a thousand cubits and this is Ezekiel and there's a man helping him in this Vision everybody with me on this all right so he brought him up to the waters now he didn't just say now don't step in there he took him to the ankles that's not so bad you can kick water around we ankles all you want to you stay out of church all you want to wouldn't get around the ankles again he measured and brought me through the water what he brought through what up to the knees in other words he's stepping out further yes he's stepping out further God's leading him up to the knees or a little harder to walk that way but all my luck he kept going another thousand and got to the loins where is the loins Bob was talking about today life that's where life comes from what justification ankles sanctification knees harder to walk yeah by the Holy Ghost life in the loins but that's not all he didn't turn him around then to send him back Ezekiel says look in this Vision he says afterwards he measured another thousand and it was a river that I couldn't pass over but the waters was just swimming today we're swimming in the Holy Ghost we're swimming in the word of God you can be dead if you want to God's moving on folks I'm telling you we took a whole year was going through all this we've been going through a lot of things all those have been sitting different ones but I'm telling you folks every year that gets closer to the coming of the lord we should want more not less that's right a water that could not be passed over a water listen you can't swim and I ain't gonna need water try it remember brother Brown he's showing his daddy how he could in that he's showing his daddy how he could swim and he jumped in a mud hole yeah his daddy's laughing names and he ain't swimming son but we're in water now that we can swim in but now watch what happened God didn't stop right there son of man hast thou seen this then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost the word of God and then you come right back again and you take a higher form of justification higher form of sanctification higher form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost higher form of the word of God listen God I this is his plan I'm just telling you what his plan is today all right if you have a problem with his plan go talk to him but I'll tell you if you hear somebody say well I don't know why God wrote it that way I do because it's the only way he saw he can't change his mind we're looking at we change our mind so I don't think I'll write it that way but God's not that he wrote it the way he wanted he wanted it we're supposed to live it the way he wrote it then he brought me and caused me to return back to the Brinks of the river now when I returned behold the bank of the river there's very many trees wash trees life on one side and the other and he said unto me these Waters issue out toward the East Country go down into the desert go down to the sea in other words you're gonna have good days and bad days you're gonna have a lot of water one day you can have a lot of desert one day which being brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healed and it shall come to pass that everything that liveth which moveth some of y'all ought to try them moveth whether so ever the river shall come shall what live it's life listen you think oh my life is so good in one one act could change what is it I know Sister Ruth being a nurse and Sister Sarah they've seen life-changing things happen just like that you have an issue and something going on or you'd be working outside and run a saw across all your fingers and cut every one of them off that's a life-changing experience just in a Split Second today you're in a life-changing experience whether you like it or not you're either going to leave here worse are you going to leave here better that's what the prophet said see we we really we hone in just like we we like to we like our pet quotes that brother Dale said because you know what it matches what we want but you got to take all of it we got our little quotes that brother Brown said we got a little quotes that this one said but can we take all of it because the Bible tells us we're going to have good days and bad days the prophet of God said we're gonna have good days you know why because he had them oh he was a prophet he lived yeah he lived just like me and you right he just lived a little closer to God but folks let me tell you something as I said Wednesday night the sin that we're dealing with the heartaches we're dealing with the trials we're dealing with the sickness we're dealing with all sin has an expiration date praise God man that ought to make you shout it has [Applause] this worldly knowledge this Cosmos all this stuff that we're putting all our faith in oh come on people good grief you better put your faith in the word of God that you'll be able to stand one day and say God I need for my family to eat God I need gas in my tank God I need my children saved The Living Word comes into us and it does the same effect on Earth what tells us the thoughts and intents of the heart they call Jesus belzebub they called him a devil he was God and it wasn't the world it was a religious people they called him a devil Living Word comes into us and it does the same effect on us see same because it's the same word it's the same thing among us he he's bringing Among Us and that's the way and sometimes those who are not in that bracket speak with tongues and another one interprets what is it the word made flesh again among us let's continue on just for a minute Prophet God said we're made partakers of his Holiness we Holiness we In His Image we are living images of a living God I got one amen out of this whole building people that are alive usually speak if you did you don't we're living images of a living God dead to self raised with him listen I'm going to say this well I get in trouble I don't care I am really if I'm if I understand in this Pulpit you can't tell me what to say either God tells me or I'm in my own self and God's going to correct me all right nobody else will that's wrong but I'm telling you something if we don't get off of our can and start living this word of God and I mean start worshiping I mean start reading have to lift it get away from the world get away there is building there's enough knowledge in the word of God in this building to make the Rapture take place but what are we doing about it amen more is given more is required we've had the word of God preached for 50 years here we have never had to correct error in this church coming from Brother Dale never right if he had something he corrected himself but we had a prophetic gift we still do you can listen but what have we done with it can't get to church can't get Church on time can't live the word of God can't read her Bible can't do this can't do that I can't do this I can't do that I can't do this I can't do that where we come from we're still babies brother Dale preached us meet for years and we're still going I'm talking about me and everybody there's enough word in here for us to have power against the devil power against sickness power against all kinds of principalities and powers and now what we're fighting we're not fighting individual people we were talking about something the other day you know the people that come and go look at brother George they don't care he's on the front row praise God he was gone disappeared God's still working God's still working and he told me the other day just several a couple weeks ago he stepped out and he said I think I kind of know what's going on now so here he is in church serving God some of the other ones have drifted out we're praying for him to come back in but now some of y'all are sitting here and you're drifting out you ain't coming back this is not for everybody folks but you know what until I draw my last breath I won't believe you are brother Dale never discluded one person he preaching his pulpit and he's like brother Branham he you never knew who he liked and who well that was the devil is who he don't like okay we understood that he didn't like the devil hey man I don't like him there I don't want him to be my best friend I'll get to something in just a second if you'll bear with me the word in you making itself real real glory to God I know you think I'm a Holy Roller I don't care triumph over every denomination Triumph overall paganism a living God made manifest in the living Temple and the word of God which is God is made flesh in you amen why you're seated in Heavenly places yes when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now matter of fact what manifest God not manifest the devil a time to deliver all nature what nature you worried about mine are yours yours this is correcting our false nature yes if you like yourself today pray for me I don't like me I don't like myself but we're getting there nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of manifestation who who's he waiting on who'd you waiting on me and you it's not waiting on for the clouds to come or the earthquakes to happen no that's all happening because we're sitting on our can not doing anything spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close to Christ they'll join him and his church together him and his bride yes now we read The Sixth Seal that's what we listen we got to have a six seal sanctification here before they can have one in the Earth and before the two prophets can come we've got to have all that we've got to have a total Destruction of nature it's the power of God to interrupt nature he's doing it right now I'm not worried about out there yet the sixth Hill is completely an interruption of nature your nature he said there's your seal the prophet's on the other side of the Rapture but we got to have it on this side we gotta have it on this side we got to see that the Seal's open the seal is open to me and you so that we can live this thing see what the seal is as those two prophets so if we're going to get anything from God it's got to come from a prophet a mouthpiece of God in other words somebody that don't have their own ideas they only move theirself out of the way and God uses you know many times brother Brown said I don't know what I just said now a lot of us do that because we're old man included what'd I just say but he was so moved out he so give himself to God so he just moved out of the way and God spoke everything needed to be spoke 100 truth every time not one time was it wrong and I'm not talking about you know what we could have really if he was just a flash in a pan and you know just a couple of years you know he had a couple prayer lines and and he and he and he guessed and got it right no he had 30 years 30 years of standing there and said if God be God let him come on the scene right now and that thousands of people were healed thousands of people give testimony not just a few here and there thousands of people he affected this whole world seven times he went around the world so let's read psalms 42 7. we'll get to this right here and we'll quit deep calleth into the deep that's a noise of what thy water spout not mine he is all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me Prophet God said now look when the Deep calls to the Deep this is actually comes from the video that we have of him in Washington DC preaching the decal to deep this is in it right here 1954. when the Deep calls to the Deep before there can be a deep call before God wrote the Bible he knew what we would need and put it there yes he just took man to write it and then God put it together for us and then man got it all scrupled up then it took a prophet to come in the end time to bring all those loose ends together and for us to get in line and start walking again like the bride did in the first churches laughs before I can beat called has to be a deed to respond people a few years ago it probably was Sinners maybe you were in some formal church that did not believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit but you heard the message there was something in there that called out for more of God yes you might have been living in a Justified State before God but you wanted the baptism of the Holy Spirit I knew I needed it do you know you need it amen if not there's not a deep in there to call out you might have been living in a Justified State before God but you wanted the baptism of the Holy Spirit you hungered for it now the very reason that there's a holy spirit is because you are a hungry boy you would never hunger for it unless there was something in here to call for it out there man's had natural knowledge let me cover this real quick because there's a deep desire for man you look at that first thing he says car man had a cart man had a boogie man had a horse-driven carriage man had a trolley man wanted more why he had a deep he wanted to go that way he wanted to go see his neighbors and didn't have to take three days to get there right yeah that was his desire but what is that worldly knowledge done natural knowledge more people we worry about covet read your statistics as more people die in car wrecks than they do have covered so let's get around the car no you will not get rid of your car I promise you and I promise you if you're an American today you got two or three one ain't enough so see what that worldly knowledge natural knowledge is still a deep call man looks up in the sky way back when they said they write the Bible as brother around says then they look at that North Star and they shoot it and they're able to sail where they need to go but man's gotta desire I want to get there faster what's on that little ball up there so what'd they do they made a rocket that fuel that they put in the car they formulated a little different they put in a rocket electricity if both levels here he'd tell you and probably some of your older ones remember when there wasn't any but man had a deep desire to have electricity and look even now we were talking yesterday June's dad now a day before yesterday you look look what LED's done to this world I mean I'm old enough to remember the old light bulb and I'm telling you I'm telling you if you touched it you gotta burn all right didn't matter if it's 50 watt 60 watt or whatever it was if you if you'd be doing this time try to get that thing off right because it was hot now led just a little bit of tangle a little bit worn see what man's done man said we don't want that anymore because you know what if we had 100 light bulbs in here of the old type it are in here so man says hey it's hot pepper we're gonna make it when we put a little chip in it because you know what we made that chip to go in the computer man deep cause of the deep he needs to defend something brother Brian said it's a thirst look at gunpowder man shot bows and arrows and they couldn't hit anything but about 20 yards don't know what you call an Indian can't shoot a bow right a vegetarian but you had Bose shot 20 yards and and you'd have to sneak up and get right on him man said I need a desire to get further away from that animal so I can take more game so the Chinese put sulfur in this all together and gunpowder gunpowder now kills more people according to Wars and and stuff than anything else to besides cars so the thing that man's making to make us more convenient is killing us processed food oh don't go there by the way well I'm going to anyway processed foods what's killing us brother Ryan said wife wife killing us [Music] election days like three months for roast beef you keep milk for two and a half weeks now Lord my mom would buy it we'd have to drink it in the week we'd be gone I mean it'd be um unless you just use it for buttermilk then because we didn't have a place we just go get buttermilk we didn't have a Walmart but you see what a man by what I mean even a natural knowledge it's a knowledge that God give man to progress and get better look at War now you're in electronics my Heavens Electronics Richard and them can buy something and what Rich one year like six months can I say six months is that exaggerating six months later obsolete well where was it it was laying there the whole time that's right what are you saying brother wait it was laying there in you the whole time the knowledge that you needed God not a seed not an eternal life but a knowledge that you needed God give man knowledge to use to make us more convenient look at War now used to years ago when you had the the medieval Wars and all that man it was hand-to-hand combat right and then they come up with a crossbow they can shoot them a little bit further then they come up with this they come up with gun powders they could blow you up a little bit further and then you then you got foot soldiers and then you got a tank and Mary's laughing because you know where I'm going you don't even have to be in a battlefield now you'll be 10 miles that's right you'd be 100 miles away and then you can have a drone you can go you can go out too you can just rain drones without why electronics man has tried his best to live by that knowledge of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he is only killing kill himself but praise you this took us away from all that I don't worry about war somebody the other day this gets me you look at the world and you know you can't watch a movie now somebody says let's go have a drink not us but the people in the movie let's grab a drink let's grab a drink let's grab a drink water is good enough for me why do you have to go take a drink and stop somebody why because Satan has got in man's mind and that's what he's programming that we have to do this that we can do this that it's okay to do that it's okay to you know like Bob said present yourself naked to the world men and women right but that's what God's put in there he's put a he's put a he's put a place so we can have Holy Ghost knowledge or we can have Earthly knowledge and listen we need some Earthly knowledge to survive in this world kids you need Earthly knowledge you need to go to school you need to learn you need to do what they tell you to do the curriculum that they have so that you can survive in this world but I'll promise you it will have an end also the Bible says ever knowing but not coming to the knowledge of the truth ever learning that's what man's done he's learned this it's learned that it's learned all these things but to have the knowledge of God it's the greatest thing we can have and that knowledge is that knowledge right there the knowledge that you need God more than you need anything in this world anything and that deef that calls you there's already something to respond let me read you this real quick then we'll close musicians get ready to come I was trying to get to this but I'm going to skip over because I can do that see how far down it was I'm I'm so slow getting this gracious but listen this right here this is from regardless evil age let's stand our feet what would God call a people out of this evil age for his name the reason it is is to try her yes whoa to try her his bride yes when she has made manifest been tried been proven proved to Satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end as the seed starts in the ground and comes up to carriers life of it but it ends up the same seed it was when he was putting the ground in the same way the seed of Deceit fell in the Garden of Eden it's the same way it ends up in the last days just as the gospel was when it fell in denomination that nazia Rome it ends up in that same super organization just as the seed of the church fell back there with the signs and wonders of living Christ among them it ends up the last days under that same Ministry the ministry of Malachi for it and restores back again the original Faith listen we're living under the original Faith we're living on the same faith that Peter had same faith that Paul had same faith that James had did it all have the same effect Hallelujah we find out this evil age is what to prove to Satan he is not like Eve that she's not that type of a woman and she will be Tried by his word the bride is Adam's bride was tried by the word bride believed every bit of it but one thing he's the same yesterday today and forever failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people has called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact Again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every w o r d listen I put that right there how many of you can say God's proud of you because you know job's sitting there one day minding his own business he had all his cows in one lot he had his camels he had his kids safe in the house he had a nice wife he had all the food he needed he owned everything that he needed to sustain himself and he's just sitting there oblivious to what's fixing to happen but God's standing in heaven oh he said oh devil come here for a second if you consider my servant job you've got a hedge built around him kill him I've tried they're all comfortable he's got the word wrapped around him he's got everything he needs he's not he's not a warned of anything so he says you just let me at him but you know what God's standing there and he's not smiling on the outside because he's holding he smiled on the inside because remember he knows the end from the beginning he knows the end from the beginning he was proud of job before this ever happened so he doesn't let you say well no God's not proud of me because of well look at job after that what happened to him everybody all his friends all his neighbors and even his wife said you've done something right you've done something you're a secret Center you're holding something back no it wasn't it's just that God wanted to prove it job was his yes and then he was Pratt listen if he's not proud of you that's why I was telling about we look at sickness and all these different things as God beating you up now what about testimony service what about God letting your children go through what they went through they want to be a testimony they wouldn't have been a a video a pair of aubergine and different ones but B Frida sitting there with stage four still living still breathing still worshiping God because God's proud of you doesn't matter what the situation is I want him to be proud of me have you considered my servant job have you considered what we're going through in your life today in my life today have you considered that that is a testimony waiting to happen and let me tell you something your Daddy has already testified your daddy's already wrote it in the Bible by his stripes you're healed I'll save your soul if you'll ask me I died for you so he already knows he's proud of us before he even gets started but you and I have to go through that test amen so that God can say man look devil you didn't make him do what you said because remember Satan said I'll make him curse you and die and then his wife even said that and job never did joke came out on the other side and God said I asked my boy he was my boy to start with he's my boy now because I am proud of him let's sing a song draw me near the Avenue [Music] to me [Music] coming in here [Music] [Music] that's the first four words [Music] testimony starts with a test please [Music] and I will [Music] know that that should be your prayer but thou will be done [Music] [Music] never blessing all to thy precious bleeding fingers blast first [Music] friend with friends [Applause] [Music] [Music] nearer blessed Lord to thy precious [Music] I love that I cannot lose [Music] dominate [Music] [Applause] [Music]
