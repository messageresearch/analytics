uh this evening let's turn to ecclesiastics chapter 3 appreciate the Lord bringing brother wade back safely yes and um and just blessing him in his travels amen how many enjoyed the services this past weekend amen it's always good to have a a breath of fresh air you know there different Ministries how God uses the different Ministries you know and the different gifts you know to speak to our hearts and and to speak the words of life in in in his way and the way that that God placed the gift in in in the PE in the brothers lives and so we receive that amen we receive it praise the Lord uh this this evening I want to I want to speak this evening just briefly and I don't I want to keep you all too long but we'll see how the Lord leads amen you know I'm not long-winded and I don't I don't ever want to be but but uh I want to talk this evening about changes and transitions changes and Transitions and sometimes we think that it's the same thing but it's it really isn't changes is different from transitions but they they go along together amen and uh so I want to take this from Ecclesiastes chapter 3 starting at verse one and let's just bow our heads before we go to the Lord read his word Lord Jesus as we come before you Heavenly Father we we just ask you first and foremost Lord to forgive us for our sins and Lord cleanse us father from any unrighteousness and anything that we may have said done or even thought Lord that was contrary to your word father we know you know father in our hearts we we don't desire father evil but we pray Lord God Almighty we thank you Lord we thank you for the precious blood that father God is still there Lord that bumper of blood Lord that we can father God uh uh Have Faith Lord God that it not just cover our sins but completely eradicate our sins father and Lord God we thank you for that and Lord Jesus we just pray now that you would have your way this evening Lord speak to our hearts and Lord may you may something be said Lord to help edify your people and Lord and you be glorified and just have your way here tonight meet every need amongst us Lord God and continue father God to just be with with brother Dale and and sister Peggy and the family Lord God we just always put them before you Lord Jesus and Lord just thank you for the strength that you have been given them thus far and Lord we just uh ask that you would just have your way here this evening and we commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Ecclesiastes 3:1 it says to everything there is a season and I want you to notice that it says that to everything everything everything upon this Earth everything that you go through everything that happens in your life everything that that happens in your next door neighbor's life everything that that goes on there is a season for that to happen it's just like as if we are right now transitioning into the spring season right today I think is the first day of spring or tomorrow or something like that but I wear my bright yellow tie anyways but it's it's a transition now it would be it would be tough it would be tough if we went from Winter to Spring abruptly but we have for the last few weeks we've been having the times where like the weather can't make up its mind it's like you know we're getting 80° weather all just about a couple of weeks ago and then the other past two nights we've been getting you know below freezing temperatures but it's it's because it's in a transition process and so the change doesn't take place abruptly because it would not be good and we may not be able to to to accept it uh or nature would not be able to accept it in in in such a harsh way so it's the same thing with with with with this so just continue reading to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven amen and we'll just continue reading you may have your seats in there it says verse two a time to be born and a time to die right notice that these things are happening in time right a time to be born and a time to die because we know that you can't die when there's eternal life in in the vault right so these things are happening we know that these things are happening here on Earth what Solomon the wisest man that have that has ever lived and he's telling us here that the things that he has experienced and the wisdom he's sharing with us wisdom a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to plug plck up that which is planted right you know you can't have your potatoes sitting in the ground forever you can't have your corn sitting on the stalk or or forever eventually it's either going to fall off or R rot off or you're going to go and get it right but but it's it's it's a time to plant that and it's a time to get that that you that you planted A Time to Kill and a Time time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up man a time to weep and a time to laugh we can't enjoy the the the good times when we haven't had bad times right that that that's just how it is we can't enjoy a good laugh amen when we haven't cried before right you wouldn't be able to appreciate it I can appreciate when I can laugh really good good and there's nothing bothering me too much back back here you know but when you have you have troubles and you have tribulations and things and problems and stuff you know it's it's hard it's hard to laugh it's hard to laugh but that's where God wants you to laugh that's where God wants you to trust in him amen a time to time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance right a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing man a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace amen so that is what Solomon told us amen that there is a time and a season for each one of these things in our lives now we as human beings we hate change we hate change we love our our our our our routines and we love our our our for everything to stay the same because that's what we are that's that we're we're we're we are we are creatures of of uh if something doesn't stay the same it it hinders or or or or it's or or it's in it's violating our comfort zones you see what I'm saying so when when things change and things we know have to change for example as I was just referring to the seasons there has to be seasons in order for there to be different things to happen here on Earth um uh here in in America we we have the Four Seasons in in in in Colombia back in my country we we only have two seasons winter and summer and winter is just because it rains a lot but it's still the same temperature but that season needs to be there you see it's in order for things to grow in order for more rain and more water to come in in in into the on on Earth and and things like that so you have to have these seasons and these and change is good for each and every one of us God doesn't stay still God doesn't stay uh uh uh in one place he moves on Amen and we see that throughout the scripture amen that God is a God that moves and that moves forward and that moves on because he's a God Amen that likes and knows that we need change in our lives because if we had if we do not have changes in our lives we would be come stagnant y right amen we would become we would become rotten amen we would become amen we would not progress am you see so we have to have changes in our lives now uh but we hate it we we all we hate it we hate when somebody sits in our seat at church amen oh I we hate that we you know but but but that's good that's good that that that you're you're allowing that person to sit where you normally sit and that person didn't do it on purpose he just there was nowhere else to sit but it it it it takes us out of our comfort zones you see so we have to have the change now Proverbs 3 tells us this in verses five and six and I didn't give the brothers these other scriptures but if they can pull them up that's good it says trust in the Lord with all th heart and lean not unto thine own understanding amen trust in the Lord with all thine heart oh I will trust the Lord in in some things but then there's these other areas amen where we want to put our own hand in it and if we don't put our own hand in it then we don't we're out of our comfort zone but that's not what God is telling us here to do he's telling us to trust in the Lord with all thine heart amen and do not lean onto what you think it's right right onto what you think the way things should be amen because my ways and your ways a a they're they're rotten amen they're no good his ways are perfect amen and so we want to lean onto the perfect amen and when we lean on to the perfect and we know that his word is perfect so when we lean on to the word word and we do things by the word then then Perfection has to come out of that right there can't be any other way amen perfect Perfection has to come out if we lean onto him and not onto our own understanding not onto our own feelings amen not onto what we think the way things should be amen but the way the word says it should be amen now that's tough but it's what we need to do amen amen and he says here in in in verse in verse six in uh Solomon continues to say in all thy ways and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths amen so in everything that we do and we use this scripture a lot for for our young people this is a scripture that helped me when I as I was growing but in all your ways in all your plans and in everything every every change that's going to happen in your life amen acknowledge Him put him first and if you put him first then he will he will direct your paths but when we don't acknowledge Him He can't direct because you're not putting you're not leaning you're leaning to your own understanding you see so so that's that's that's what we need to do amen and that's what the wisest man that ever lived amen told us to do in Proverbs right amen now Malachi 3:6 tells us this for I am the Lord and I change not amen he God God is all known he he's the one that doesn't change but he doesn't change because he's infinite he's all knowing and that's the reason why we as human beings we we have a hard time accepting change because we're finite and we're scared of the unknown amen and so it's hard for us us to move forward Amen in something that we don't know but he's not he's not scared he's not afraid and that's the reason why he doesn't change but he says he's Lord and he changes not because he's all knowing amen we're constantly faced with changes and it's because we're not all knowing we're we don't know all things and that's the reason why we have to depend on God Amen and and that's the reason why we struggle with the process of change amen we struggle with change because we we sometimes don't have a clue sometimes we just got to shoot blindly sometimes and say Lord I'm doing here's my part you just do the rest it's almost like like us as ministers sometimes sometimes honestly you just you're like Lord you you're trying to find the mind of God you're trying to pray and you're trying to say Lord where what is it that the church needs right now amen what is it where where is your mind what what is it I don't want to necessarily preach what I want to preach I could I could bring here bring a a good teaching of you know of something that that I like but what is it that the that that that the church needs amen and then you're sitting there you know Gathering notes and you're Gathering scriptures and you're Gathering things and re and ultimately you have to say Lord that you do the rest you speak according to the needs of the people because I don't know them the the Brethren here that Minister don't know them but you oh Lord knows the needs and the hearts of every individual here and you can speak according to your oracles Lord and meet every need that's there because he created the heart and he knows the heart and not only that he can change the heart amen I can't change the heart amen but he can amen and so all we are asked to do is tasked to do is just speak his word amen throw out the net so to speak praise the Lord Jesus now brother brandham uh says this and and I know we believe that God sent us a prophet in this day and therefore we quote him amen yes sir amen but he said in the message in 1964 in in Christ has identified the same in all generations he says and now we find that in each one of those ages usually people don't want to believe it because they're already set in their way right and then he says a an interesting phrase here and and and several years ago I preached a message called when God turns the corner and he says here you're turning a corner right you're turning a corner you're building a building and then get to the corner everybody is running this way they don't want to turn that corner right but the building goes that way if the word says it goes that way see there's where we get those Junctions of time man that's where it's hard it's in the it's in the Turning of the corner when they're building the building it's it's in that turning of the corner because here they got used to laying the bricks or doing whatever all in one row for a while now but now it's time to turn to corner and that turning of the corner is where it gets it gets tricky it gets tough but that turning of the corner you need to Pivot and you need to to be able to turn that corner so that that so that that building can continue to be built amen so whatever it is in your life or whatever is happening in our lives we've got to be able to be able to Pivot amen when God is trying to move and direct us amen into a into another area or another season of Our Lives how many are understanding what I'm trying to say right cuz God Amen is moving God is God God is in transition God is moving and we got to look at him see where he's moving and just move along with him right that's and then things can go smoothly but that's the that's the hard part that's the hard part you know but he said he would lead us and guide us unto all truth amen so you're turning a corner now right we're turning a corner and we've got to be able to look in the word and we've got to be able to turn that corner amen and look at him and see where he's leading us right not by your own feelings not what you feel or how things should be amen but what do the people need what what is it that that that that that will continue amen that this building continues to grow amen what is it amen that I continue to grow amen that you continue to grow amen because God is not wanting to stand still God is wanting to move forward amen amen praise the Lord Brother BR continues to say here in 1961 in the church choos in law for Grace he says this you cannot break the types and shadows of God that's what Israel done in the natural that's what they've done in the spiritual we realize that those things happened to Israel now they've happened to the church today just as they did then and we're about the end of the road now Brethren watch what he says here it's time that something happen happened amen amen I I believe that it's it's time that something happened it's you know I I don't know you know here comes we have an eclipse coming and and and here comes all the YouTubers you know bringing up this it represents this and then the prophecy of this and all this and that amen and and and we know that something is on on the road to happen right and the word tells us what's going to happen happen so don't lean onto your own understanding amen but lean onto what the word says amen whatever will happen if something happens that day well they gu knew about it and I'm just going to move on Amen turn the corner with him amen I'm not missing a Rapture I'm not missing a body change if that's amen if the Rapture takes place that day I'm going in that Rapture amen and you should be too I'm not saying it is but but but you have to move and pivot and be willing to to and be and be able to Pivot when God is moving right and we're about the end of the road now Brethren it's it's time that something happen I want to cross Jordan don't you brother Brandman asked over into the promised land where we can see we've seen good things he says God's been good to us we're not complaining I'm out here with you this is Brother Bram still speaking I'm out here on these things with you but brethren let's put ourselves together and go over amen amen let's put ourselves together and go over why we must go over amen we can't stand still we can't go back amen and we can't just look at the past and and and and glory in the in in the days of old amen we've got to move forward because there is scriptures in the in the in the Bible to be fulfilled and they're not going to be fulfilled us standing around and sitting being stagnant we're God is moving and we've got to move forward amen praise the Lord Jesus there's scriptures to be fulfilled in your life that God plac there to fulfill in your life personally and they can't and they can't be fulfilled unless you get to that point where that an anointing comes over that where God can't can fulfill that scripture in your life you see I believe that with all my hearten you see so uh so he says here let's put ourselves together and go over and then he says we must go over amen amen we must go over the children of Israel when they got to the to the to the to the promised land to the to the River Jordan there they had to go over why because the promise had already been given to Abraham that they were going to to have that Promised Land even before Moses came on the scene even before anybody else that God used God had already said that he was going to take him to a land that flows with milk and honey God was going to make sure that that word was to be fulfilled God said that there is going to be a body change in this hour God said that there's going to be a resurrection to take place in this hour the conditions have to be there in order for those things to take place and they can't be there uh in in in in stagnant way and just waiting on the train like brother Dell used to say when we're sitting around and just get to put this thing on cruise control and just let's let's see what happens and I'll just uh I'll wait until God gives me the anointing to get my prayer closet and pray when I feel good and I don't I and I feel I you know I'm not I don't feel sick anymore and I I don't feel hunger pains anymore then I'll get down on my knees and get desperate with God again no amen God is moving you're going to be left behind somewhere praise the Lord Jesus amen now I want to I want to this this is what the difference between change and transition is now change is the event or the moment in time in other words is the actual is the actual event or or that moment that that happened that's different from what previously was there right so you could take for example you you you move in into a new home or you or you leave a job change jobs um or or when we become parents right right that's a change now transition is the process it's that process for that change to happen now we like changes it depends on what it is we don't like people to sit in our seat at church but we don't like that change though but but we but we need those changes now the transition for those changes or the things that happen for there to change that's where where it gets tricky that's where it's tough for us because that's the hard part and amen that the the transition is the process that unfolds before or during and after the change event right and that's the tricky part amen now also change is external it happens to us and and it also happens around us amen um for example and I put this example uh with regards to you missing a a flight right that that you you that is a change that happened when you go to the airport you get there and and and and and you get there and you miss the flight and it's because something happened to the plane or whatever and you can't get on the plane and you miss a flight that's a change that happened and you couldn't do anything about that right but now the trans I is what psychologically or what you're thinking how you're going to take that what are you going to do to be able to to to work with that change you see you see what I'm trying to say so for example you know last year my brother Bob and and and Michael and Nyla and all of us when we went to Nicaragua and we left Atlanta and we got to Houston was it Houston yeah it was Houston and we knew that something had happened all the national uh nationally the computer uh FAA computers they broke down or something like that something had happened and and when we got to Houston of course we missed our flight to go to Nicaragua so here we are in Houston I I wish I wish we were still in Atlanta there would have been an easier way to get out of that but we were in Houston very far away from home so we couldn't we had to the change happened abruptly but we had to Pivot amen we had to transition Amen in order to be able to accept that change and let's see what we can do about this some of us were thinking well maybe we should just go back I'll just get a flight and go back some and some of us were thinking well let's just see what happened let's wait here in the airport for a few hours let's just see what happens no I I want to go rest at at a hotel let's just see what but as you all know the the testimony we got there to the kiosk and and they were able to get our flights I think for was it the next day or two days we stayed in Houston two days that we stayed in Houston and they were able to get our flight uh uh uh uh for in two days and all of us at the same time so we weren't separated at all so it all worked out and we were able to hit a good barbecue place too while we were waiting you know and uh brother Bob I'm sure he still dreams about it yes and we were able to to uh to and and as I said you know we were there at that barbecue place and there was a great Gody that just treated us so nicely I forget his name now but maybe one day he's going to get eternal life for doing that to us you know so maybe the plane was grounded or the for just that man right there for us to be able to say for two days I don't know I don't know so so God is the one who who allows these things that happen but see we it was the transition that we made was okay we're just going to go to the kiosk and let's see what they have available for us and they had a flight available for us 2 days later and we transitioned amen and we got to where we needed to to to go you see so that that is what a A Change Is and and and and that's what that is what transition is and so transition is something internal amen it's it's a psychological process and it's the way we deal with change it's the way we deal with how w w with with change because we hate change I I hated that we missed that flight because we missed two days of being able to minister in Nicaragua but God had other plans you see amen so um so transition it it affects us on on the physical side on the emotional side amen uh but it it's it's in these processes amen that in that transition amen that it's that we are changed or we are transformed amen praise God to whatever the change that the Lord wants to to put in our Liv so change is is is a challenging thing amen for humans because we we don't like change we like things to stay the same we don't want anything to to to change but we've got to have changes take place from time to time otherwise we would be stagnant amen amen praise the Lord Jesus and and and so what happens when we when we have to Pivot and transition is that sometimes we start thinking or we start thinking of the worst and that's when fear comes into picture right we start fearing and we start thinking well if things don't stay the same way then what's going to happen that the things aren't going to happen the way they they've always happened but sometimes we need that to happen amen the people the people need that to happen you need that to happen amen and so we can't let fear be the Tormentor in our lives when when changes take place because sometimes we create these pictures in our in in our minds and and we think that things are worse than what they really are and in reality when you let time pass and you let things simmer down amen they're really not as bad as you think they are amen now that right there that is the transition that's that's part of a transition is when you let time pass when you wait on God amen amen and you wait on his on his will amen that is is a that is a transitioning mode right there praise the Lord Jesus so so we can't let fear be our our Tormentor amen because otherwise you know we' we' we'd just go around biting our nails constantly and we can't have that amen now Romans 8:28 it says and we know that all things all things amen and now we we read here in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 that to everything there is a season right and Paul comes over here in Romans and he says and we know that all things work together for good for good amen all things work together for good amen and it only happens to them that love God Amen why because they see that a change happens that we need to transition where God's moving we got to move right right yeah to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose amen and his purpose is his word praise God and so we see and and and so everything that happens in your life doesn't happen just to happen amen there is a purpose for it amen amen there is a purpose for it and we and we've we've got to embrace that amen it's hard and and and it's it's it's uh you know it's we don't we don't see the clear picture at times but we've got to embrace that God if God is in us then God is leading our lives and that he has a a Finish Line a a finished product in in at the end amen amen right amen and this is the thing that that that for example our you know teenagers they struggle with sometimes they they you know they want to they get to a point where they want to get older and I was a teenager and many of these adults young people they were all teenagers at one point one day Brother Don he was 11 years old and 12 years old sister Susan one day you were 11 12 13 14 right all of us were at that age that you're living in at that time at this current time and so we want to oh I want to when I get older I want to be this and I want to do this and I I want to I want this to happen and I want to be involved with this and then when the changes start taking place or the transitions start taking place that's when it becomes tough why am I getting all these pimples on my face why is this happening to me why is all these changes taking place what what what is all this I I put cream here but then all of a sudden I get something else over here let me tell you young people I've been there yeah I used to have a lot of bad acne but I promise you it'll go away they would they told me they told me when I was younger when I was there when I was your age they said they said oh don't worry when you get to be about 18 to 21 years old all that stuff will start going away well it took me about maybe 22 23 and and trust me you know every now and then you still have to battle with a little pimple here and there even if I'm 43 years old right so it's something that just stays is stays with you but that is not that that will change that's a transition that you're going through for a greater change to happen in your life right you have to trans there that and that's the tough part that's the tough part because now you're you're asking questions and you're doubting you know you have all these different emotions and and all these thoughts are racing through your head but believe me and trust me young people it is it's a normal thing amen and the best thing that you can do is reach out and talk to those who have been there where you are and who has been there where you are your mom and dad yeah right amen right people at church adult your pastor amen amen they've been there where you are at that age and so they understand and I certainly understand when you when you have trouble with the pimples I've been there done that and I know it's embarrassing I I know it is I know I'm talking here as a personal level it's embarrassing it can be but look at it in the way that it's you're you're you're embracing the transition of you becoming a better person of you becoming a lady or of you becoming a young a young man and those things must happen in order for you to be aen who God ultimately cuz God didn't ultimately create you to be a a a a a baby forever no that's right right and he didn't create you to be a a a a 13 year old forever amen and he didn't make you to be a 15-year-old forever you know UL timately you're going to be 21 years old an adult yeah and hopefully more mature than what you are now but there's there's transitions that happen there because a baby can't just be a teenager all of a sudden there has to be transitions amen and with Transitions and change sometimes change is messy but it needs to be that way so and I hope that some some of your teenagers get don't find that encouraging amen so we look at we can look in the Bible at at examples of of change and transition we can look at the at the children of Israel amen when they were promised that they were going to be taken to a land that's flown in milk and humy and and and they were going to have a deliverer and they were going to leave Egypt in a mighty hand and and when Moses came there and God sent Moses he went there and and and and and they proved and he proved that he was God sent and when he went to pharaoh and started telling him and and let let my people go and Pharaoh didn't let them go and what he did is he he doubled their burdens the people were happy God has sent us change God has sent us a deliverer God but when the transition's part of it started happening that's not God's man that's not who God wanted us to to to to have that's not the the prophet of God they started they started blaming Moses and started blaming the what God was doing and that's that that's ultimately what happens with us many times and yet is God working amen don't you think that it was God working there God was working on the scene he just was putting them in a position where he can he can uh uh later on uh deliver them with a with a powerful hand right amen so we we know that Moses was sent by God and and and their their troubles were were doubled and their work was doubled but it was God that allowed that in their life so that they could get even more serious amen praise God we we can look at Abraham's life and Abraham how how he was called Amen to leave his country and his and his family and and and his comfort zone and and God tells him I need you to go and and move to this this land and this is where where I want you to be and if you don't I won't bless you I can't bless you amen follow me and Abraham amen had to embrace that transition amen he had to embrace change in his life amen in order to receive from God what he what God promised him that he was going to what he was was going to have otherwise he wouldn't have had it any other way now you think it was hard to to to to go tell uh uh Sarah and and and Sarah God this God that I don't even know his name he told us to move to Wyoming there's no church around it's just you know flat land everywhere and and uh or you know wherever it is put your put the state there I don't know anybody but God said so and I don't know where we're going to live I don't know what the you know what where where we going to get our next meal but God said so so let's do it I just wonder what Sarah was thinking you see but that's the hard part that was the hard things that Abraham was having to to to deal with you know we only see just God Called Moses and Moses I mean God called Abraham and Abraham moved on but I'm sure he had to have some struggles mind battles right mind battles and and and and issues with with with his family his family telling him I can't believe you're going over there I can't believe where are you going and and having issues maybe with his mom and his dad and but he obeyed God and if he didn't make that transition then God wasn't able to bless him and give him the promised child that he was to to have amen we can also look at a transition of David amen David when he was transitioning from being uh a a a a a little Shepherd a little Shepherd amen just doing what his dad was telling him to do and and and and learning Amen in that process Amen to one day fa come face to face with the Giant and and and come face to face with with lion and and and a bear and all these things but he had to transition aen one to to and go through all these things in order to uh to uh to do what the anointing that was upon him which was to be a king later on that was the change amen that was the change when when the prophet came and anointed him to be king he wasn't king right away he was anointed to be king but there was a process that he had to go through in order to get to that point amen right and you read all about that all the things that eventually he came to be king amen and and and and it was the perfect will of God you see so it was it was in the transition and you think it was it was easy for David it wasn't easy for David plus he was a young man he was a he was a he was a a teenager I think when all that all those changes and all those things started happening but he transitioned and he tried to Pivot Amen in order to fulfill what God had for his life life amen praise the Lord Jesus and and and one of the greatest changes that that I see in the scripture is in Joshua and in Joshua chapter 1 where we see there where it was time for God to transition amen from Moses to Joshua amen and and in Joshua chapter 1 you can read there in verse one and and it says now my servant Moses is dead and now therefore God is Con ated in the now God is a god of the now and he says now therefore amen you're anointed I'm paraphrasing you're anointed to go take these people across amen it it's your turn it's your turn I I've used my servant Moses now up to this point now it's your turn and we know that Joshua is the holy spirit amen is a type of the Holy Spirit and that is what is leading the church in this hour amen is the Holy Spirit leading the church amen it's not it's not it's not the ministry of a man and it's not the ministry of of a certain group but it's the ministry of the holy ghost in a multi bride in a in a in a multi-person bride amen praise the Lord Jesus last time when I preached about this a couple several years ago I preached about turning the corner and and and and and typed it typed it in with how difficult it is for people to let go of that brother brandham has passed away and they just can't seem to let that go but he's not here no brother he's not but his message is here the word is still here with us and that is what's going to take us through brother Bram could not take us through brother Bam could not take us to a body change the message the word takes us to the body change brother Brandon physically could not because he physically did not even come to that right do you realize that he himself is not going to experience what the ones that are alive and remain are going to experience why because he died he's he's he he we know that he's alive you know in the sixth Dimension don't get me wrong and he's right now with his own people right but he got to come back resurrect amen amen with the other with the other Saints and then those that are alive and remain you and me shall be changed that part he is not going to experience but it was his message that was going to bring us to that without his message we were not going to get to the those that are alive and remain so it's not putting brother brandham down or anything like that we thank God for what God did to with brother bram's life amen thank God but there has to be a transition and if we did not have that transition of brother brandham leaving the scene pass leaving the scene then it would not give us the opportunity to come to that those that are alive and remain why because now we're not looking towards brother Brandon now we're looking more to the word giving us Faith to come to that Rapture in faith you see to come to a body change to come to to receive the the uh that change that we also desire and so what it does is the fact that he left the scene now it makes us study his the message and the word more that's right and now we're looking to the holy ghost or we're looking to the Holy Ghost for that change to happen in our lives it was the same thing that happened with the children of Israel there Crossing Jordan they had their eyes all on Moses amen but but now Joshua a man who was experienced in everything cuz he was with Moses the whole time right he was with Moses the whole time just as the Holy Ghost was with brother brandham the whole time but that same Holy Ghost is with his people today it's with his bride today and so we're looking at the holy spirit amen to make the change in our lives and so the people had to obey amen Joshua's instructions in order to be able to cross onto the other side onto the promised land and they couldn't do it no other way Moses if Moses was supposed to be there he would have been there right if Moses was supposed to be there God would not have allowed him to pass away but he passed away Joshua had to move on Amen and it's the same thing amen with us in this our day amen we have to move on with the leading of the holy ghost things have happened and things changes have taken place but we've got to continue moving on with the holy spirit amen there's a people that needs the word there's a people that needs Ministry there's a people that needs the five-fold ministry amen we've got to move on Amen with what God has in store for us why because we are in process and marching to receive a body Chang I want to see the dead raised that's are those are scriptures that have not been fulfilled they've got to be fulfilled amen and I can't wait on on on on on the brother brand to come back or anything like that Amen in order amen I believe he's already given us the full word in this hour amen the problem is is that we're not getting in it that's right that's the problem amen and so therefore we we die we die in our own foolishness sometimes expecting for something to happen that's outside of the word amen right and it's foolishness am amen praise God so we we and and and so yeah so I had I had that last time I preached that and I had I had people coming to me because they they got upset cuz I was talking about the relics and and how and how you know people are just so so uh uh they they they've got to have their their belt buckle and and and this you know brother brandom had this toothpick in his mouth and you the preserved it you know and I'm and and all these things that that that are not going to give me eternal life amen but the message he preached will that's going to give me a body change and and I respect the ministry of of of brother brandom I I love what he did and I love the experiences he had because it's helped me it helps me in my life even now right amen but I can't I can't go on in with with relics amen those are just those that's just what it is it's it's it's relics amen it's relics that that that it's good to have pictures and it's good to have things but those things I'm not I'm not hoping for those things to take me in to give me eternal life because I have a certain picture in my or a poster in my in my house or or or something like that you see I think I think the church nowadays has moved I think they've matured a little bit more about that you know I think I think I think things are are changing because now we're looking and seeing wait a second okay we've had the relics we've had all these things we've had all these things but look what has happened people are getting off the word yeah and and their their house is full of relics and they don't even go to church and their house is full full of of pictures and and everything and and and and and and and and they don't even live the word right brother they don't even do what brother brandom told them to do and it's to go to church yet their house is full of pictures and they got everything that brother brandham had but they don't even go to church that's not going to help them you see so I'd rather have the message that he preached give me that give me that because it goes along with the word that's what I want so that it so I can get out if here amen I can't get out of here with a belt buckle and I can't get out of here with his boots I've got to get out of here with the word he preached praise God for his boots and praise God that God anointed those boots when he was wearing them and but those boots can't give me eternal life amen I've got to have the word he preached amen praise the Lord I don't even know why I got into that praise the Lord but you see the death of Moses had to happen in order for there to be that transition right amen so changes take place Moses died that was the change but the transition that was difficult was when Joshua was bringing in the people and the people had to Pivot and and then and you read that in Joshua I believe is in Joshua chapter 3 where they say everything that you say Joshua we will do they had to come to that point to say everything that you say Joshua we will do now are you willing to say that today with what God is doing now right or you just going to stay stuck in the past or stay stuck with a personality and if it's not done this way then it's not it's not it's it's it's it can't be done if it it was always done this way we always did it this way we always did but God is transitioning amen God is moving why because we are supposed to get a body change so things happen so that we can come to a body change I don't know why uh other other reasons why but but the ultimately is that the the dead the sainted dead that have passed away they must come they they've got to resurrect I'm waiting to see brother Ray Gabriel again I'm waiting to see brother Gary Atkins again brother dick all the brother brother uh uh all the brother Marlo all these brothers Amen brother uh brother um brother Al man I want to see these brothers again but I ain't going to see them with the way they went though no amen they're going to be young amen but I've got to Pivot with God's program now in order to see that you see what I'm trying to say so we've got to move on with God now brother brandom says here you cannot break the types and shadows of God that's why Israel I believe I ReRe this and he says here we've been good we've seen good things I believe this church has seen good things we've had good Ministries amen we we have had good teaching we have had wonderful we've have had a wonderful pastor with brother Dell amen we have had uh I don't I didn't get to know brother Mo but I I hear he was a really good brother and and and God bless him for the ministry that he did amen but now it's time to transition into something else now amen because why we are to get to a body change amen and so we've got to get to a point where we're supporting amen if it's in the word and if it's outside of the word I can't support that but if it's in the word I've got to move on with it you see and it won't help you if you just sit there that's right I just won't move on I'm stuck with 1985 I'm stuck with 1975 1965 no you've got to move on it's 2024 and God God the the body change is taking place amen soon amen you've got to move on with the God's program amen God did things in 1985 God did things in 1975 but God is doing things in 2024 amen praise the Lord Jesus amen and for no other reason because I know sometimes us as older ones I include myself too but us older ones we're setting our ways we're just you just can't move me from here this is where I stay and we got the young people that are like asking questions they're wondering what's going on what's Happening and nobody's answering their questions they're living in this age they're experiencing the things they experienced that you experienced in 1965 but that you forgot that so you forget that there's young people now they're experiencing things in their life in 2024 and you don't want to move on on brother I'm challenging you all let's think about these other young ones amen that are growing up they got to have the word for themselves just as you had it so let's do something to give them the word let's just not stay in a in a in a in a in in a stagnant uh uh uhh pool amen a broken sister as brother Brandon preached that message amen let's move on with what God is doing now now amen so we had to have those changes we had to have we had to have the prophet leave the scene so that we weren't looking at Jeffersonville Indiana anymore but we're looking at amen the word of God this is our home this is my home amen we're not looking at the it's wonderful to go see the prophet's grave I believe there I believe there's even an anointing there amen but brother brandham can't do anything for me there right amen but the word does something for me wherever I go amen Wherever I Go amen I I it can do something for me so change and ex and and and transitions Amen in order to experience the full change there has to be a transition now even in in and with this I want to finish Even in our in the body change or in in the change of our bodies in order for us to get to that we have had to have a transition in our lives ever since you were born you are transitioning up to that point multiple changes are taking place in your life that's right amen and so in order to get to that point amen you have had to have gone through problems tribulations difficult times sad Times Hard Times uh flat tires car wrecks all kinds of stuff passing away of family members sick n all kinds of things but ultimately is to take us to the body change the ultimate amen change a body change but in order for there to be a full Chang there has to be Transitions and that's the hard part but as I always said and I you know I I love doing things online and and you know doing things as far as content and uh you know putting up content and different things and one thing that that the entrepreneurs uh say and is like one thing that they say is don't don't look at at at the finished product cuz sometimes you don't know what they you have a goal in mind right but just embrace the moment embrace the transition of to get to that finished product so embrace the moment now embrace the transition Saints embrace the growing in God amen Embrace growing in the word and learning more and praying Embrace that prayer time that you have that prayer moment embrace it amen because one prayer at a time one scripture at a time one message at a time one Church going at a time one missionary trip at a time and eventually it's taking us to that full body change amen praise the Lord Jesus embrace the moment amen and then you'll be happy and you're not you're not fearing what what's GNA happen oh no I'm out I'm out of my somebody's sitting in my seat again you're not embracing the change no that's right you're not embracing the transition you're stuck on yourself amen amen so God bless you all we love you and the Lord and uh let's just have the musicians come let's just pray Lord Jesus we thank you heavenly father for for the opportunity that we have to have spoken your word Lord we realize Lord that father Lord maybe things were said in a chopped up way but Lord ultimately Lord God we wanted to say what
