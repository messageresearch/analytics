[2:21] James in the fourth chapter from wind's
[2:26] coming from whence come Wars and
[2:29] Fighting's among you come they not hence
[2:32] even of your lusts that the war in your
[2:36] members you asks a mercy not because you
[2:54] ask amiss that ye may consume in upon
[2:59] your lusts do you think that the
[3:17] scripture says in vain
[3:19] that the spirit that dwells in us left
[3:22] us to envy submit yourselves therefore
[3:35] to God
[3:35] resist the devil and he will flee from
[3:38] you
[3:50] being afflicted and moan and we let your
[3:54] love to return to morning where your joy
[3:57] to heaviness speak not evil one of
[4:07] another brethren he that speaketh evil
[4:11] of his brother and judges his brother
[4:14] speaking evil of the law and judge the
[4:17] law but if ye judge the law there are
[4:20] not a doer of the law but a judge
[4:34] go ye now that ye say today or tomorrow
[4:40] we will go into such a city and continue

[20:56] sick among us just remember each one in
[21:00] order that your love and grace be there
[21:02] we committed to you now in Jesus name
[21:04] I mean visions one Paul an apostle of
[21:12] Jesus Christ by the will of God to the
[21:15] Saints which are in Ephesus and to the
[21:17] faithful in Christ Jesus
[21:18] grace be to you and peace from God our
[21:21] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:24] this would be the God and father of our
[21:27] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[21:28] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[21:31] places in Christ according as he has
[21:35] chosen us in him
[21:37] remember dice are thought chosen us in
[21:41] him before the foundation of the world
[21:44] that we should be holding without blame
[21:46] before him in love having predestinated
[21:50] us unto the adoption of children by
[21:53] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[21:56] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[21:59] of the glory of His grace wherein he
[22:01] hath made us accepted in the beloved you
[22:05] may be seated
[22:06] Lord that is blessing to the reading of
[22:09] the word have a good good crowd this
[22:11] morning glad to see everybody out that
[22:17] the Lord would would open our
[22:20] understanding and help us all to to see
[22:23] alright we've been on this in Ephesians
[22:28] a couple of services where you own it
[22:32] for a little while continuing on but I
[22:35] want you to think about what we've been
[22:38] talking about and you know to give
[22:42] lined up and get everything in order to
[22:46] understand called we read in the
[22:48] scripture that it says that that he has
[22:52] chosen us in him if we say but yet but
[22:57] we chose him now we didn't choose him he
[23:00] chose us you say yeah I did I accept no
[23:04] you accepted him as your Savior you
[23:08] didn't choose him you accepted him as
[23:12] your Savior and doing that then that
[23:15] puts you into the body of Christ and
[23:18] puts you as part of the chosen but
[23:21] remember now that what we're dealing
[23:24] with is trying to get an understanding
[23:26] to be able to follow the line of and
[23:30] going into adoption and that you know
[23:35] with a little bit we got last Sunday but
[23:38] we'll try to get a little more today and
[23:40] then just continue on gradually as we're
[23:43] going along because that's what we want
[23:45] to cover all right what was ours what
[23:47] has been our thoughts though to cover
[23:50] bringing about the part of really
[23:54] dealing with predestination everybody's
[23:57] scared of that word you know the word
[24:00] predestination
[24:01] it means destiny determined beforehand
[24:05] that's the definition of predestination
[24:08] and see everybody thinks well well what
[24:11] is the predestination are we
[24:13] predestinated this way
[24:15] what are we predestinated here what are
[24:17] we alright we're going to get to it
[24:19] today and I want to make sure that you
[24:21] follow it in the line to where we'll
[24:24] know because to me there's only one way
[24:27] to understand predestination and that's
[24:31] by the basis of what it is that God
[24:33] never predetermined anything to be other
[24:39] than his word now hold that until we get
[24:42] back to that later other than his word
[24:44] caught is not the person that comes
[24:47] predestinated eternally from God it's
[24:49] the word our seed all right we believe
[24:52] in a predestinated see the
[24:54] predestination
[24:55] word okay but people have to receive
[24:58] eternal life to have eternal life
[25:00] you didn't come into the world with
[25:01] eternal life cause if he did then Jesus
[25:04] Christ died in vain that put us in to a
[25:06] different position all right but now in
[25:09] doing that then we've used the
[25:11] background of a couple of messages to
[25:14] try to comprehend a little thought that
[25:19] you have two basic thoughts in the
[25:22] religious realm
[25:23] it's called Calvinism and Arminianism
[25:29] all right that's basically big so it
[25:33] builds up the religious rim you know
[25:35] this has this this has this all right
[25:38] Calvinism and Arminianism two thoughts
[25:43] to where we can understand why we're
[25:46] here and what's going on to me that's
[25:49] the only way we're gonna understand
[25:50] predestination because we can't put
[25:53] predestination as we'd used to do
[25:56] basically that's a Baptist Presbyterian
[25:58] even into the Catholic doctrines and
[26:01] things of predestination and everybody
[26:04] wants to make it predetermine this way
[26:06] for you sir all right but now remember
[26:09] one thing God does not predestinate by
[26:13] his desires he desired that everybody be
[26:18] safe he made a way for everybody he left
[26:23] it for everybody to work that they can
[26:26] do it that's one of the emphases that
[26:28] you place upon it in Calvinism and
[26:32] Arminianism is Calvinism is a put it on
[26:36] a basis that you know it's a you know
[26:42] how nothing to do with it he just God
[26:44] just chose you and took you and and made
[26:47] you what you are and and put you to a
[26:50] point and then just predestinated and
[26:53] just pushed a button and sent you
[26:55] through life
[26:55] him making you do all right then
[26:58] arminianism will cover on the basis of
[27:01] what we would call works I don't do this
[27:05] I don't do that I don't we'll cover
[27:07] those signs a little more
[27:08] as we go along but the main point I want
[27:11] you to think on is C we say Paul was the
[27:18] Calvinist I want that thought Paul was a
[27:22] Calvinist because he believed in this he
[27:23] believed it in in salvation you know
[27:26] vind are all right but now listen to
[27:29] what Calvinism says Calvinism says that
[27:34] only a chosen group of people are to be
[27:37] brought to salvation I'm just giving you
[27:40] an overall view from looking at the
[27:43] dictionary and looking up to walk
[27:45] Wikipedia ever how you doing and picking
[27:47] up the thoughts but the Calvinism puts
[27:50] it to the basis that you know it's this
[27:55] finished it's done it's a set thing and
[27:57] God just picked who he wanted and only
[28:01] the predestinated are considered in
[28:06] salvation all right now our median is
[28:09] imported on the basis of that all our is
[28:14] open for everybody
[28:17] now this that's two of the thoughts
[28:19] you'll have to get in your dictionary
[28:21] sometimes if you want to do it but
[28:23] that's that's the point that it'll make
[28:25] that they see Calvinism says all right
[28:30] I'm just gonna save certain people and
[28:34] only the predestinated elect is included
[28:38] in salvation in any form well now let me
[28:43] give you a thought see there's truth to
[28:46] those signs
[28:47] Calvinism has truth arminianism has
[28:50] truth all right Armenian is and see on
[28:53] the other side basis that the salvation
[28:56] is for everyone and and but you must
[29:02] bring yourself into that situation of
[29:05] understanding it I just want to give you
[29:07] a thought now if if it's only further
[29:13] predestinated are the elect then what
[29:17] are you going to do with your foolish
[29:18] version virgins Matthew 24 25
[29:22] what are you gonna do with your fifth
[29:24] seals you what are you gonna do with
[29:27] your people of that form and
[29:29] understanding so you can't have it as a
[29:32] stamped thing that's it it's done it's
[29:35] finished only the elect it's considered
[29:39] in Redemption
[29:40] there'll be Redemption when we leave out
[29:42] of here God will turn from us as the
[29:45] Gentiles and turned back to the
[29:47] dispensation with the Jews and it bring
[29:50] in those people and you'll bring in
[29:53] though the part there's a foolish
[29:54] version of us it that will be brought
[29:56] into that point to be given eternal life
[29:59] one day and I like that so you can't
[30:02] stamp it on the point of Calvinism I was
[30:07] just saying only the elect can be saved
[30:11] now you run into that into message
[30:13] people so that's what I'm asking you the
[30:17] question what are you Calvinism
[30:20] arminianism which one are you
[30:23] well I didn't know what this underneath
[30:25] I didn't know it mattered well we're on
[30:27] the basis of one side of the other so
[30:31] you know the understanding of most most
[30:33] of people of the message I come here
[30:35] with this predestinated seed I'm this
[30:38] I'm a seed I was this before the world I
[30:40] was that see making it a Calvinistic
[30:43] form of salvation
[30:48] whereas then you got the other groups in
[30:51] the message part that would argue we you
[30:55] know it has to be on the basis that we
[30:58] all choose and we've got to fulfill our
[31:01] religion and live our salvation and do
[31:04] it and both of those things are true
[31:06] they're both true but yet brother
[31:10] Branham now I'll give it to you later
[31:12] brother Brown says the book of Ephesians
[31:16] is the most wonderful book he said
[31:18] because it takes the two sides and
[31:23] brings it together in the middle all
[31:27] right now see then Calvin had his
[31:31] doctrine but that wasn't what Paul was
[31:33] teaching
[31:35] Kalvin probably claimed part out that
[31:38] but that was not what Paul was teaching
[31:41] Paul was teaching the truth of salvation
[31:43] the Calvinism and in the basis of of
[31:49] doing it well you see it had never been
[31:51] a doctrinal issue until they come up to
[31:55] the ire and it wasn't a Peter I mean
[31:57] excuse me it wasn't James and Paul
[31:59] arguing over predestination or anything
[32:03] like that it was the truth of the gospel
[32:05] of the hour they were living okay
[32:08] the Apostle Paul was taking it and
[32:11] looking from the side of what God was
[32:13] seeing of Abraham and how he would
[32:17] accept him and do what he was doing and
[32:19] it brought that in and that's the truth
[32:22] see James was taking it on the basis
[32:26] that he said show me your faith without
[32:30] your works
[32:31] he said I'll show you my faith by my
[32:33] works alright people want to argue that
[32:36] point they think James were saying one
[32:39] thing and Paul was saying something else
[32:41] no both of them were teaching salvation
[32:46] because there's a truth to the point
[32:48] that the chosen is the chosen right
[32:52] there's a truth to the fact that we must
[32:54] work out our own salvation with fear and
[32:57] trembling there's a truth to each side
[33:00] but putting it together by the book of
[33:03] Ephesians he said that's the most
[33:04] wonderful book of all he said called it
[33:07] takes that and brings it together
[33:08] alright now we're going to see the Lord
[33:11] willing in the next few messages picking
[33:14] it up and going into predestination
[33:16] we're going to see that the book of
[33:19] Ephesians is a valuable book because it
[33:22] shows the truth of predestination
[33:25] it shows what God was dealing with but
[33:29] remember my point now I'm trying to make
[33:31] a point with something because see
[33:33] people don't think I don't know about
[33:35] his own life see if we get our ideas our
[33:39] concept we have blamed Paul as to the
[33:42] basis the religious world says he was a
[33:44] Calvinist
[33:46] because he was rich
[33:48] laying a lot on grace and in salvation
[33:51] of that way and then they say well James
[33:54] was a legalist see an Armenian well both
[33:59] of them had truth all right but yet you
[34:05] got to put them together if you can get
[34:09] it together in the middle of the road
[34:10] then you don't have to worry about cause
[34:12] if you don't you're gonna go off one way
[34:14] or go off the other way all right
[34:16] see there's a truth to salvation to the
[34:19] point that God chose us right but then
[34:25] there's the truth to salvation to the
[34:26] point that you accepted God as your
[34:29] Savior all right
[34:32] you accepted what his editors were
[34:35] supposed to live a Christian life huh
[34:38] that's not legalism that's not that way
[34:44] but God has to use those things see
[34:47] Martin Luther was leaning more over onto
[34:50] the Calvinistic form of salvation all
[34:55] right here comes John Wesley as a
[35:00] legalist in his works because John
[35:04] Wesley had a lot of you know don't do
[35:06] this don't do that
[35:07] and all in his teachings all right
[35:10] because it was sanctification all right
[35:14] and see one was taking it one way and
[35:16] one was taken to the other one but both
[35:18] of them had truth that's my point that's
[35:21] what I want us to look at the Bible as
[35:23] as we see the Bible as it it doesn't
[35:26] take a one-sided view of something it
[35:29] gives you the straight truth of it
[35:32] salvation is of the Lord
[35:34] Jonah 2 & 9 okay we we believe that the
[35:40] fact that you say well I chose God well
[35:42] you didn't choose God God chose you
[35:43] cause no man saw God at any time the
[35:45] Bible says you say yes I did I've been a
[35:48] whole service on that trying to explain
[35:50] it to what we look at or what we're
[35:52] talking about yes we did cry out we
[35:55] prayed we fasted we sought after God we
[35:59] done no signs our butt
[36:01] it was the goodness of God that led us
[36:03] to do those things because we were not
[36:07] that's not the salvation upon alright
[36:10] the goodness of God leads us to do those
[36:14] things okay and that's that's fine but
[36:17] that doesn't save you because God is
[36:20] calling you remember only the called can
[36:28] be brought forth okay alright but
[36:31] putting that C together now we can get a
[36:34] picture and that's what I want us to
[36:35] take with the book of Ephesians is to
[36:38] take a look in there and follow that
[36:42] line not of Calvinism and Arminianism
[36:44] that was just a background for you to
[36:47] get to understanding out the way that I
[36:50] believe in well look the Bible has one
[36:53] way of saying something but we have
[36:56] blamed it for a lot of things we have
[36:58] taught it said this and we've taught it
[37:01] said that and it don't even teach you
[37:03] I've heard people say the Bible says and
[37:07] every trouble set on its own bottom well
[37:11] where's that in the word it's an
[37:16] illustration no point but where's it in
[37:18] the word no see we've said the Bible
[37:23] taught this and that's my point of
[37:25] sailing mankind have said Paul was more
[37:28] of Calvinistic and then they try to pick
[37:32] out what church would fit into that and
[37:35] basically the Baptist would fall in
[37:37] under part of Calvinistic works alright
[37:42] those men had great understanding but
[37:45] remember they were in their day and time
[37:50] they did not have it put together in the
[37:53] right order so they would take one side
[37:55] of it no they would take the other side
[37:57] and then to argue their points and how
[37:59] meetings and and all kind of things to
[38:02] to discuss it but it didn't work out but
[38:06] here comes a prophet in the last days to
[38:09] be able to show us the truth from God's
[38:12] Word and said
[38:14] at all in order and that's why we
[38:16] believe it like that and believe that
[38:17] God sent Malachi for promised it because
[38:21] it would straighten out the the
[38:23] fallacies of mankind and his religious
[38:25] belief well I wanted the Prophet say he
[38:29] said Calvinism is the point that looking
[38:33] at what God sees and he seen the faith
[38:39] of Abraham and a different thing he said
[38:41] but Arminianism is the basis of what man
[38:45] sees about what Abraham done our Deborah
[38:48] Ham did do this and didn't do that but
[38:51] remember both of them is telling the
[38:53] truth but I want D to write C then we
[39:01] can take the book of Ephesians and and
[39:03] put it in there and in a parallel Joshua
[39:05] because Joshua and the Old Testament was
[39:08] a setting a part of the land and getting
[39:10] the children of Israel divided up and
[39:12] putting in position to be the people of
[39:15] God
[39:15] so part it parallels that in that it
[39:19] explains it but see then there's the
[39:23] truth to it then you say well what about
[39:24] predestination well Steve what about
[39:29] predestination it's in the Bible we just
[39:34] read about the predestination in
[39:37] Ephesians yeah but I don't believe in
[39:40] predestination now what it is you don't
[39:42] believe what mankind mankind has taught
[39:45] you about predestination mankind has
[39:48] taught predestination until on some
[39:51] sides of it it is just a it wipes out
[39:54] Christianity you know and then you
[39:58] follow the people of this message and
[40:00] they come right on up into believing
[40:02] those times and will quote you things to
[40:04] try to show you that there was
[40:07] predestinated well okay that's fine it's
[40:16] in the Bible it's a truth that there is
[40:21] a destiny set in the Bible
[40:27] for each one of us but yet if we don't
[40:31] get it together in the correct way of
[40:33] understanding we make it God doing
[40:36] something when it's not what he's doing
[40:42] see then you you you you hang up on
[40:45] predestination this Mike you hang up on
[40:47] Calvinism and Arminianism you can't
[40:50] figure out what's going on
[40:52] but remember put them together and
[40:55] they'll come forth with a beautiful
[40:56] picture of the the plan of redemption
[40:59] God had a plan and a purpose we'll get
[41:02] back into that chrysler mystery if
[41:04] you'll read it God had a plan and a
[41:06] purpose he was going to see it achieved
[41:11] but then he turns right around and says
[41:14] now God didn't predestinate by his
[41:16] desire because he desired everybody to
[41:20] be saved but he knew everybody wouldn't
[41:24] right then he could say but for some
[41:29] reason whatever in the book of Romans
[41:31] where he said you know but Paul bringing
[41:34] out out Jacob have I loved and he saw
[41:38] how I hated alright now we got that
[41:40] figured out he hated did he hate Jacob
[41:46] where can you bring the word hate from a
[41:50] eternal loving God right see people
[41:57] don't think like that
[41:58] where can you were can you fathom our
[42:00] bring some word to be able to in the
[42:03] English language or any language in the
[42:05] world to be able to bring it to the
[42:07] point that God could hate Jacob no love
[42:13] Esau hey Jacob I mean hate he saw where
[42:20] can you put it so you don't think like
[42:24] that you don't think you think well I
[42:27] just I've got the Bible says it then he
[42:30] loved Jacob and hated Esau well now
[42:35] you've got me to argue with you on one
[42:36] point cuz hang on argue with you about
[42:38] what's being said Oh Jacob and Esau
[42:41] I'm going to ask you a question where
[42:43] did the word hate come in for God where
[42:49] did you get the right to put a word in
[42:51] our that would be have anything to do
[42:53] about hate no he hated the ways of Jacob
[42:59] he's coming he's owning and love the way
[43:02] to check them because of their doing and
[43:04] that's where you pick up your army in
[43:06] and and Calvinism but you see you got to
[43:12] get it in the right order because if you
[43:15] don't it's got to be put together where
[43:21] can you bring any form of hatred from an
[43:26] eternal God well God hate no no no God
[43:32] hates the sinner no God don't hate us in
[43:34] him he died for he loves the sinner he
[43:41] hates his ways right see then East all
[43:49] God could look down and see what he saw
[43:51] would won't and that's what God hated
[43:55] but he could see what Jacob wanted and
[43:58] that's what he loved
[44:02] do you when you bring it together it'll
[44:05] bring a beautiful picture but the book
[44:07] of Ephesians brings that together to
[44:10] where that you don't deal with the word
[44:11] P destination in what we'd think about
[44:14] it
[44:15] well it's predetermined for me to be
[44:16] that way and I can't do nothing about it
[44:18] now where's that in the Bible where's
[44:24] there anything in the Bible that God
[44:25] predestinated something to the basis
[44:27] that he didn't give them a choice he
[44:34] gave Cain a choice the God doesn't
[44:41] predestinate by his desires really in
[44:47] essence he predestinated by your desires
[44:54] because he looks at your desires of what
[44:57] you won't he looked at Jacob and saw
[45:00] what he wanted he wanted to birth rock
[45:05] he saw didn't care he didn't have no
[45:10] value to him what but you see then we we
[45:18] get to the point then of looking at
[45:19] predestination well there's got to be
[45:22] something about predestination that
[45:25] excuse me for coughing they'll get
[45:27] preaching sometimes and the whole call
[45:30] first starts working okay but listen
[45:35] what are your ideas about predestination
[45:41] well I believe I'm a predestinated seed
[45:45] I come straight from God be careful now
[45:50] cause that's Calvinism well I believe
[45:57] that I was so good and I live my life so
[46:02] good until God come down to save me now
[46:04] you're Armenian
[46:12] and neither one of them will put
[46:16] together the picture but both of them
[46:19] together will bring out the picture of
[46:23] what salvation truly is so then as we
[46:31] start off on this I want you to - now I
[46:34] want this message to be laid in there of
[46:36] understanding how does God predestinate
[46:42] he can't predestinate by his desires
[46:45] because he would be a UH he wouldn't fit
[46:50] the picture of God because He desires
[46:53] everybody to be safe so they can't be on
[46:58] the basis of what his desires is he
[47:00] didn't like you better than like the
[47:03] others like that's something that we
[47:05] think we're worth were so good you know
[47:08] we're so goody-goody we didn't know what
[47:11] Calvinism we didn't do this
[47:13] we didn't I I didn't drink and smoke and
[47:17] chew and and do all of those things so
[47:19] God saved me
[47:23] now that's Arminianism - you're gonna
[47:30] follow one side of the other but if we
[47:34] get into the truth of it we can see it
[47:35] and then follow the line there's only
[47:37] one way I make that statement with with
[47:41] the point of the prophets message to
[47:43] back up the Bible to come out to make
[47:46] one statement there's only one way God
[47:50] could predestinate and not be contrary
[47:56] to his own word or will he said boy
[48:04] you're making a strong side I'm making a
[48:06] strong statement because I invite you to
[48:08] come and let's talk about it so then you
[48:13] say well how does God free - God
[48:15] predestinate by his foreknowledge
[48:23] now which come first ain't in the
[48:27] chicken and the Thunder which come first
[48:35] this predestination come before or for
[48:38] knowledge or for knowledge before
[48:40] predestination which way is it
[48:43] see that's why I don't mind saying and
[48:46] putting out to you what I believe
[48:47] because I want you to know what I
[48:49] believe
[48:51] [Music]
[48:52] well I believe so and so I've always
[48:55] believed this about this on
[48:56] predestination I've always believed I
[48:58] just a predestinated person I can just
[49:00] feel it I was just I know I was back
[49:02] there well how did you get back there
[49:14] all right but God predestinate by his
[49:18] foreknowledge now he can predestinate
[49:27] Jacob and Esau run by his foreknowledge
[49:35] and he doesn't have to pick one and
[49:41] reject the other he allows mankind to do
[49:45] his own life he doesn't make you do
[49:49] anything the Lord made me get saved no
[49:54] he didn't he just made you to the point
[49:56] that you wanted it he didn't make you
[50:00] get saved there was no such thing but
[50:05] God did predestinate in a way that the
[50:10] thing the Bible says the thing formed
[50:14] can't say why did you make me this way
[50:18] because God never made us that way
[50:25] that's what I've always told you my
[50:27] brothers Methodist minister but he
[50:29] believes he said God made me a sinner
[50:32] with desires and lust and said he can't
[50:35] condemn me for having him I see didn't
[50:37] make you like that he made your own self
[50:43] mortal life puts you into a situation
[50:45] but yet you got a lot a choice to do
[50:47] away with those things and get away from
[50:49] it but see God predestination by his
[50:55] foreknowledge those who he foreknew he
[50:59] did predestinate alright which comes
[51:03] first then predestination no
[51:10] foreknowledge
[51:17] foreknowledge has to enter the picture
[51:19] and as it does for knowledge takes the
[51:22] book of Ephesians and puts it together
[51:25] to show you the truth of understanding
[51:31] the predestination it's not a bad word
[51:34] once you understand what it is
[51:36] it simply means destiny determined
[51:39] before him well God determined to save
[51:42] me so I can't help it
[51:44] I'm gonna be saved it don't matter what
[51:45] I do now be careful you're walking on
[51:49] thin ice you can't blame God for the
[51:58] situation that we're in you know I know
[52:06] Cosi that was always been a doctrine
[52:08] among religious people is predestination
[52:10] that is is one thing that has split the
[52:15] probably the one thing most of all to
[52:19] split up the churches is the doctrine of
[52:22] predestination and see that's what I'm
[52:28] saying some some people believe that
[52:30] well well God saved me I don't do it
[52:35] well you got a crew there but what if
[52:40] you didn't accept it
[52:47] what if he didn't accept it so let's
[52:51] just think about it let's read some
[52:56] things and then we'll we'll get to it
[52:58] and you'll know that that's at least we
[53:00] know where we stand on what we believe
[53:02] you know we have company back there and
[53:10] hope that they understand what we
[53:12] believe without me having to explain I
[53:14] believe that God sent a prophet in the
[53:17] last days promised it in Malachi 4 Luke
[53:19] 1730 revelation 10 7 etc etc and you
[53:23] know we don't make the Prophet God he's
[53:26] not God he is the prophet of God or was
[53:29] he's passed on but he taught us a
[53:32] message and that was what he was coming
[53:33] to do was from Malachi 4 to return the
[53:37] faith of the fathers back to the
[53:39] original Word okay that's what we're
[53:42] wanting to do is to turn back to the
[53:44] book of Acts in other words turn back to
[53:46] the book of Ephesians to where we can
[53:48] take the book of Ephesians and and put
[53:50] together predestination to the basis
[53:52] that it it it will be a beautiful
[53:55] picture but just remember where it's all
[53:58] comes from and then when you finish
[54:00] don't ask me later
[54:01] well brother you know you're gonna know
[54:03] caught them on read to you that I'm a
[54:05] firm believer in God's foreknowledge I
[54:09] believe that's the only way God can
[54:14] predestinate without being a respecter
[54:18] of persons as I said in the scripture
[54:22] that I was quoting a minute ago the same
[54:24] form can't say why did you make me this
[54:26] way so you can't argue with God about
[54:30] how come you're here what we are we made
[54:33] our own choices we chose our lives
[54:36] ourselves we're choosing them right
[54:38] every day in our own sails but don't you
[54:42] think that if there is an eternal God if
[54:46] there is that's a question to you not to
[54:49] me if there is an eternal God can he not
[54:52] keep his word straight if you can't keep
[54:55] his words straight then ain't no need in
[54:57] serving him
[54:58] why serve him if he can't keep his word
[55:01] straight if he's not uh
[55:03] you know setting that's the word is it
[55:09] but we need to get it together in the
[55:11] truth so I so according to Ephesians
[55:19] that we read it says that he chose us in
[55:24] him
[55:24] chosen us in him before the foundation
[55:27] of the world having predestinated us
[55:34] unto adoption now let me make a
[55:38] statement is going to be a slap you know
[55:40] how I do it I'll slap it out real quick
[55:42] sometimes to get you to think we notice
[55:46] what it says are he predestinated us
[55:47] unto adoption
[55:51] well the Dobson is welling up in the
[55:55] statue of a perfect man you don't start
[56:03] your journey as an adopted child of God
[56:08] you start your journey as a child a baby
[56:12] walking in the word but he predestinate
[56:16] sus unto adoption in other words he
[56:20] knows what's going to take place right
[56:23] so let's just think about predestination
[56:26] and let's take what the prophet has to
[56:28] say and then that way at least you'll
[56:31] understand what I'm talking about
[56:32] so go ahead with number one I'm an
[56:34] excuse me number five according with
[56:36] number five on the notes that we got
[56:39] because I want you to take these things
[56:41] I want you to listen to what he has to
[56:44] say these are questions and answers in
[56:46] jeffersonville any in it alright my
[56:48] precious friend now you can read up back
[56:50] and I put it all out to her
[56:51] predestination before the world begun
[56:54] alright my precious friend let us turn
[56:56] to Ephesians the first chapter for just
[56:59] one place we won't take too long all
[57:02] right let's start reading here to fees
[57:04] in the first chapter the first thing I
[57:06] want to say that that predestination is
[57:08] a bad word for a minister to use
[57:12] before an untrained congregation now
[57:14] watch what he said I like that the way
[57:16] says it's not a bad word to use when the
[57:20] congregation is trained so when I get
[57:22] through with this you'll understand one
[57:24] thing you may not agree with me but in
[57:30] the next few services you're going to
[57:31] learn one thing I believe in for
[57:34] knowledge I believe we are predestinated
[57:38] by foreknowledge I believe for knowledge
[57:41] comes before predestination
[57:44] predestination is a destiny going that
[57:47] away coming from your foreknowledge all
[57:50] right so you're gonna know what I'm
[57:52] talking about you know you may not agree
[57:55] with it but that's alright we're gonna
[57:58] have it it's gonna be we'll be trained
[58:00] for one time you can match the kids say
[58:02] what brothers they'll believe he
[58:03] believes for knowledge you know they'll
[58:06] at least be able to say it that way
[58:09] sometimes here at the church without an
[58:12] out as he's talking about I always use
[58:14] the word for knowledge because
[58:16] predestination is only the foreknowledge
[58:19] of God Jesus is claiming straight on
[58:26] predestination is only the foreknowledge
[58:30] of God God be an infinite by
[58:34] foreknowledge he knew everything or he
[58:37] is an infinite thing he knew what would
[58:40] happen
[58:40] so by foreknowledge he could
[58:42] predestinate that's the reason that I
[58:45] believe that God you know does it like
[58:48] that
[58:49] so what are we starting off as to be in
[58:53] how does God predestined by his
[58:56] foreknowledge now he predestinate cause
[58:59] he loaded now that making predestinate
[59:02] and by his desires then you desire to
[59:05] everybody to be saved so you're in
[59:07] trouble but he can predestinate you say
[59:14] yeah but I I believe predestination was
[59:15] just hold on we're gonna have a long
[59:19] series of services back through
[59:21] predestination to eventually learn what
[59:24] foreknowledge is really
[59:25] talking about alright so think about it
[59:32] by foreknowledge he could predestinate
[59:35] now for knowledge is knowledge
[59:38] beforehand is that as a Webster
[59:41] definition I mean we just being plain
[59:43] that means for knowledge means a
[59:46] knowledge is beforehand are before
[59:49] taking place all right so then God
[59:53] predestinate not by the desire he wanted
[59:58] you saved he paid the price for
[1:00:02] everybody in the world right but what's
[1:00:09] wrong with any predestinated is certain
[1:00:13] on weightless let's don't make him
[1:00:15] predestinate that away let's take it and
[1:00:18] stick on what we're talking about
[1:00:19] predestination means a destiny is
[1:00:23] predetermined
[1:00:24] alright I'll bring that I believe the
[1:00:27] Bible speaks of a predestination I
[1:00:29] believe that there are some
[1:00:30] predestinated unto election and some
[1:00:32] predestinated under reprobation right I
[1:00:35] believe that because the Bible says that
[1:00:40] but if they ain't careful I'll cross my
[1:00:42] own self up and see I believe that he
[1:00:47] loved Jacob hated Esau but that's what
[1:00:53] my point he didn't hate Esau as we know
[1:00:56] we take the word hate when I like it
[1:01:02] over in Genesis our worry repented that
[1:01:05] he made man you remember that
[1:01:10] well who do you repent to if we just
[1:01:14] believe in one God who did he repent to
[1:01:20] but it says it repented God he what he
[1:01:29] sees that he didn't make him wrong but
[1:01:31] he sees our wrong
[1:01:35] right he knew what we would do the
[1:01:39] minute he created us
[1:01:41] that's the infinite God he knew Adam and
[1:01:46] Eve would fall no no he had see the arsy
[1:01:52] pre-business he had to wait let's fail
[1:01:53] for he knew anything about it ours your
[1:01:55] your pre destinations from your
[1:01:57] Calvinistic and Armenian doctrines
[1:02:00] alright but think about it go ahead
[1:02:03] let's read a few go ahead Jehovah Jireh
[1:02:09] now there's a doctrine of predestination
[1:02:11] which is rotten nonsense
[1:02:13] I like evil he just like me I try to be
[1:02:17] like him because I try to be plain in
[1:02:20] that way you don't have to worry about
[1:02:21] it you don't have to worry about what I
[1:02:22] you don't have to worry well well what
[1:02:24] brother Dale what do you believe I done
[1:02:26] told you what I believe I believe in
[1:02:28] predestination by foreknowledge and I
[1:02:31] believe that's the only way God can pre
[1:02:33] determine anything to be without being a
[1:02:37] respecter of persons is to be by his
[1:02:43] foreknowledge he then that'll come
[1:02:46] together in the whole truth in whatever
[1:02:48] really is a true predestination God by
[1:02:51] for knowledge could predestinate because
[1:02:54] he has foreknowledge God is not willing
[1:02:57] that any should perish but being the
[1:03:00] interval and God knew who would perish
[1:03:02] and who were not that's the reason he
[1:03:05] said before and before Jack Evaristo was
[1:03:08] born he hated Esau and lo Jacob his
[1:03:12] foreknowledge let him know that he saw
[1:03:15] was a shyster and he let him know that
[1:03:18] Jacob respected that birthright you know
[1:03:23] what I like away we've read a Wrentham
[1:03:24] talks about thing he puts it into the
[1:03:27] places at one time
[1:03:28] I'm just straighten honest now so just
[1:03:31] listen Jacob was a better guy than he
[1:03:35] saw her I was just getting my words
[1:03:42] right he's always a better guy
[1:03:45] peace all loved his daddy took care of
[1:03:47] his daddy worked herself to death with
[1:03:49] his daddy he was a greater guy so when
[1:03:56] he says that he saw was a shyster you
[1:04:03] know Jacob was a shyster his very name
[1:04:06] is tripper up her he was a he was he do
[1:04:10] anything him and wanted to laymen and oh
[1:04:12] brother Ernie gets into about laymen and
[1:04:15] and Jacobs getting into dealing with
[1:04:19] each other you know but listen get the
[1:04:24] point of what you're talking about he
[1:04:27] saw was a shyster the only thing you got
[1:04:31] against he saw us he didn't care about
[1:04:34] his birthright now you gotta admit that
[1:04:38] he was a good guy he done everything
[1:04:40] right except he didn't care about the
[1:04:43] birthright now you know me anything else
[1:04:46] that he saw was guilty of see that's
[1:04:51] where we don't get it in the right order
[1:04:52] you know that came was a great guy you
[1:04:58] know that came love God you know they
[1:05:00] came worship God came brought an altar
[1:05:03] he worked yourself to death
[1:05:05] and Abel late over under a tree and let
[1:05:08] the Sheep grow then went and slit his
[1:05:10] throat and paid the price but the point
[1:05:14] of it is one of them knew the story the
[1:05:16] other one he was just human right let
[1:05:24] him know the D sold of shyster let him
[1:05:26] know that Jacob respected regardless of
[1:05:28] how he got it he stoled it now see
[1:05:36] that's that's what gets me yeah I I'm
[1:05:38] sorry
[1:05:39] what's the island when I bring it out
[1:05:41] like that I think about you mean God was
[1:05:44] setting up start looking downing and he
[1:05:47] says he saw you're the finest guy you've
[1:05:50] done everything right everything's
[1:05:52] perfectly in order but I hate you
[1:06:00] and then he sets up there and all in the
[1:06:02] world Jacob is doing is a tripper upper
[1:06:04] or Steeler a thief a con artist and God
[1:06:09] looks down and says Jacob I love you you
[1:06:17] know I don't make God sound too good but
[1:06:22] is it true
[1:06:23] did it happen I mean is it true but see
[1:06:28] then we've get into the story of
[1:06:30] realizing God was looking at those two
[1:06:35] boys to see one of them had his mind on
[1:06:39] the birthright he didn't care how he got
[1:06:44] it
[1:06:44] he stoled it he tripped up he done
[1:06:48] everything in the book to get that
[1:06:50] birthright that birthright is the top of
[1:06:53] the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:55] right I used to tell him I said I'm a
[1:06:59] when it comes to this message I'm a I'm
[1:07:03] a shyster we used to go to Jefferson
[1:07:05] building and they'd be the printed of
[1:07:08] books and we'd have be there for service
[1:07:10] you know and and they'd print of five
[1:07:13] hundred books and they'd be a thousand
[1:07:15] people well you know we never went that
[1:07:18] we didn't get a book or two yeah I've
[1:07:24] done it many times
[1:07:26] look up there and see him running out of
[1:07:28] books and I just deliberately walk off
[1:07:30] the back and I like I was looking for a
[1:07:34] seat you know trying to do something you
[1:07:37] know looking around trying to find
[1:07:38] something and they'd be taking those
[1:07:40] books out of the things and hand out and
[1:07:42] they'd just get him a handful of books
[1:07:43] and I just reach over to get a handful
[1:07:45] of books and I would go back up to where
[1:07:47] I come from and I pass them out down the
[1:07:50] aisle
[1:07:50] we got books every time you know why
[1:07:53] because I'm a shyster I wanted that book
[1:07:58] but I swear I look at Jacob and Esau he
[1:08:03] you know he give away what one was his
[1:08:06] birthright and the other one was the inn
[1:08:11] and he just come away well here comes
[1:08:16] Jacob and he had one thing in mind I'd
[1:08:22] love to have all the benefits that goes
[1:08:24] with this I won't have but my main idea
[1:08:27] is to get that birthright because if
[1:08:31] I've got it I've got everything I wanted
[1:08:35] well you know what I love about God you
[1:08:39] know maybe you don't think I love to
[1:08:41] read the Word of God like this you know
[1:08:46] what it was all said and done oh he saw
[1:08:51] man if Jacob would have hung around I
[1:08:54] regret when it first happened he'd have
[1:08:56] killed him
[1:08:56] I mean he's after him he to kill Jacob
[1:09:01] for what he done but you know what Jacob
[1:09:04] goes off gets over here goes through the
[1:09:06] whole line brings up a family comes to
[1:09:08] walking back and hears Esau Jacob the
[1:09:12] whole time thinking I gotta face that oh
[1:09:15] boy
[1:09:16] he gonna cut my throat he gonna kill me
[1:09:21] said maybe I can appease him you don't
[1:09:26] read the Bible like that he said maybe I
[1:09:29] can appease him so he had his family
[1:09:32] divided up in bands I don't know what
[1:09:34] that meant how many was each one but he
[1:09:36] said okay send this group before it's in
[1:09:39] this group next rescind this group
[1:09:40] maybe after getting a little wild me
[1:09:44] giving him all this stuff he won't cut
[1:09:46] my throat well you know what I'll I take
[1:09:55] it was a tripper upper yet God looked at
[1:09:59] his heart Esau he wanted that old boys
[1:10:04] throat but somewhere in that journey
[1:10:08] some started dealing with him the god of
[1:10:15] glory started dealing with him and you
[1:10:19] know he wound up to be a pretty good
[1:10:24] we want all this predestination we went
[1:10:27] all this seeds these ideas and time when
[1:10:31] it's all finished Esau comes running to
[1:10:34] his brother Jacob says take all of this
[1:10:38] I'll give it he said look I got more you
[1:10:40] got
[1:10:41] I don't need your stuff let's just hug
[1:10:44] each other's neck and get over this you
[1:10:47] know something took that he wound up not
[1:10:52] being too bad a guy we don't see those
[1:10:55] stories we'll attack a one-sided story
[1:10:58] about
[1:10:59] oh hey Garwin no earner son and we look
[1:11:08] at it wha that's unsavable that's him oh
[1:11:10] that's the mold surface seeds and whoa
[1:11:12] things predestinated Hagar sound learned
[1:11:19] she says son takes him over and sets him
[1:11:22] down we're doing right about the middle
[1:11:28] of her pity party she's having and being
[1:11:30] done and finished God says hey y'all
[1:11:34] wait up look over there
[1:11:39] look over there so there's some water
[1:11:43] and says now what I want you to do now
[1:11:48] check your Bible see if I'm right he
[1:11:51] told Hagar he said you go back down
[1:11:53] there now Sarah done run her out right
[1:12:00] you know I don't think she's nice to her
[1:12:03] I said you go down there and you be
[1:12:06] under subjection see we don't read the
[1:12:10] whole story I'm sorry that's just my way
[1:12:15] of looking at things because see I'm
[1:12:16] looking at like Calvinism and
[1:12:19] Arminianism
[1:12:21] which one are we are we grace and
[1:12:27] disgrace are we works and same time
[1:12:30] which one are we
[1:12:36] you know the brother brother said Martin
[1:12:39] Luther said he was more on the side of
[1:12:41] Calvinist because that's why I got so
[1:12:45] far down you know what they really got
[1:12:47] down there where they wouldn't even have
[1:12:48] revivals the Calvinistic doctrine got so
[1:12:52] tired of hmong they wouldn't even have a
[1:12:54] revival because they was afraid God
[1:12:57] might save that kid and him not wanting
[1:13:00] to save him that's the doctrine of
[1:13:02] Calvinism now how would you feel if you
[1:13:08] say well we're gonna revive we have no
[1:13:10] revival God might say some of our kids
[1:13:12] well what do you mean that's what you
[1:13:16] won't let's say we don't look at it that
[1:13:19] way we study the one-sided view of what
[1:13:22] we won't we study it to the point that
[1:13:27] we want to follow Jacob God this puts a
[1:13:34] wheeze on right in there and it scared
[1:13:35] him along and blesses him and gives him
[1:13:37] all oversight and turned his heart to
[1:13:40] where he don't want to kill his brother
[1:13:46] then we don't read the whole Bible we
[1:13:48] read what we want to read yeah but I I
[1:13:53] can't see nothing in that I mean how can
[1:13:55] you see anything well Hagar
[1:13:56] when she was just that old bad woman
[1:13:58] well God told us if you go get the water
[1:14:01] let's then go back down the owner and
[1:14:04] set under Saira gonna be obedient to it
[1:14:08] you know what you don't hear anything
[1:14:14] thrilled about eh well
[1:14:21] turns out to be a good guy see that's
[1:14:25] what my point is what are you getting at
[1:14:27] I'm getting at one thing we can argue
[1:14:31] all day long on predestination well I've
[1:14:34] got these quotes and I got these scripts
[1:14:36] I got this
[1:14:42] we'll have you got a truth that lines up
[1:14:44] so I can take predestination and if
[1:14:47] though you are way out and send us all
[1:14:49] over to here and realize we're all up in
[1:14:51] heaven we're running around up in there
[1:14:53] little bitty people just having a good
[1:14:54] time before the world all lean into it
[1:15:01] cuz only in God's mind that's what's
[1:15:04] your prophet saying so we're gonna have
[1:15:07] to hold that we're going to hold a port
[1:15:10] then when we come into predestination
[1:15:12] that you're only going to be dealing
[1:15:13] with God's mind now you've got it
[1:15:18] different than what people try to teach
[1:15:20] it oh if I was dark and then mmm others
[1:15:25] had to serpent seeds in time they're not
[1:15:27] dark what about it see I believe firmly
[1:15:41] that is one thing about it God's
[1:15:42] predestination can only be by
[1:15:45] foreknowledge anything outside of that
[1:15:49] I'm getting on the wrong side of that
[1:15:50] word I'm pre determining and I'm doing
[1:15:53] things that I shouldn't be doing with it
[1:15:55] but if I can keep it by his
[1:15:57] foreknowledge well that's bad this we
[1:16:01] talked for knowledge in the Baptist
[1:16:03] Church we talked predestination in the
[1:16:05] Baptist Church if brother dick Addison
[1:16:10] was sitting here today he'd say we
[1:16:11] taught it in the Presbyterian because
[1:16:13] that was one of their dog French that's
[1:16:17] predestination but a lot of people think
[1:16:22] about predestination they walking along
[1:16:23] in life and someone will fall down so
[1:16:26] I'm glad I got through with that because
[1:16:27] that was God predestinated me to fall
[1:16:31] well
[1:16:35] I'd rather think about that he's always
[1:16:37] trying to keep me from falling you know
[1:16:40] it's the better way but that's alright
[1:16:43] alright so we're we're let's go to
[1:16:45] number what do we get number six or
[1:16:48] let's go to number six place here we get
[1:16:57] because this is the point that I want
[1:16:59] there really is a true predestination
[1:17:01] godbye for knowledge could predestinate
[1:17:04] because he has foreknowledge God is not
[1:17:06] willing that any should perish but being
[1:17:09] the infinite God knew who would perish
[1:17:12] and who would not that's the reason he
[1:17:16] said before and Oh Jacob have a love
[1:17:17] Esau hated what about it what about it
[1:17:24] going to number seven let's get a few
[1:17:26] this from either this is taking trying
[1:17:32] to do God a service without his will but
[1:17:35] God has his word set and has in all ages
[1:17:41] now what's him his foreknowledge has
[1:17:44] caused him to set in the church his for
[1:17:51] knowledge caused him to set in the
[1:17:55] church there is some things in the
[1:17:58] church that are said come on we're going
[1:18:01] to get back to it one of these day you
[1:18:03] know that the gifts of God you got nine
[1:18:05] spiritual gifts in a church that's not
[1:18:07] predestinated eternally but you've got a
[1:18:10] fivefold ministry that's predestinated
[1:18:14] you better study your prophets message
[1:18:17] if you don't want to study that way you
[1:18:19] better study Malachi 4 because Malachi 4
[1:18:23] is predestinated come on because it's
[1:18:26] not a person it's a word it's the seed
[1:18:30] come on
[1:18:32] and the people certain things that he
[1:18:34] did from the beginning and then the
[1:18:35] gospel that's being preached to that age
[1:18:37] is only revealed to that certain people
[1:18:41] the rest of them don't see it that's
[1:18:44] true
[1:18:46] thank thee father that I have hid these
[1:18:48] things from the wise and prudent and
[1:18:49] revealed it to such ins would learn see
[1:18:51] that's predestination not that he did it
[1:18:55] by you say I'll choose you and don't
[1:18:57] choose you by his foreknowledge he
[1:19:00] knowed what you would do now he's got it
[1:19:05] on the basis of foreknowledge
[1:19:07] go ahead number eight things that are to
[1:19:11] be the foreknowledge of God can
[1:19:15] predestinate make everything work to his
[1:19:18] honor when that predestinated seed that
[1:19:22] you wish to be and God called you and
[1:19:26] that little ego of a seat in there oh
[1:19:28] this is all we want to read we don't
[1:19:30] want to read anything of foreknowledge
[1:19:31] all we want to read is a little Eagles
[1:19:33] and little stories and how he was and
[1:19:35] what we was before the world and what is
[1:19:37] doing but remember one thing
[1:19:42] here's what he's talking about they
[1:19:45] heard the Word of God it will build on
[1:19:49] top one word on the other just remember
[1:19:53] if there's anything about you that's
[1:19:55] worth anything it's this word ain't
[1:20:03] nothing else worth into you you and me
[1:20:06] it don't matter
[1:20:08] we all come from the same mold we may be
[1:20:11] different colored skins we may be tall
[1:20:15] and short and fat and ugly but we all
[1:20:17] come from the same mold right God has a
[1:20:23] reason he has a reason any predestinate
[1:20:32] succour denies foreknowledge God had a
[1:20:37] plan I keep going across the ministry
[1:20:39] God had a plan and a purpose he was
[1:20:41] going to see it and see okay where does
[1:20:48] it go to go ahead to the next one
[1:20:52] I want you to notice he does it in that
[1:20:57] way in every age now listen to it he
[1:21:00] does it every time by the same method he
[1:21:04] has to take believers and then in order
[1:21:06] to how believers to meet that word
[1:21:08] I want you he's got to predestinate it
[1:21:11] to that age there's no problem well I
[1:21:15] mean he said it to it I know he said it
[1:21:17] the word you see he's got to
[1:21:20] predestinate this thing to be there to
[1:21:23] meet the challenge of the age did it get
[1:21:27] it did you feel it did you see it
[1:21:30] do you understand it that's what
[1:21:32] happened what happened today he
[1:21:34] predestinated it to this by his
[1:21:37] foreknowledge when he predestinated in
[1:21:39] Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he
[1:21:42] come over and predestinated anything to
[1:21:45] happen in his word he had to prove his
[1:21:50] word to be so when he predestinated
[1:21:56] anything to happen and says it will
[1:21:58] happen
[1:21:59] he knows that seed will be there just at
[1:22:02] that time he predestinated a bride she's
[1:22:07] going to be there going to be a rapture
[1:22:09] she's going to be there he predestinate
[1:22:13] sit by his foreknowledge see there's
[1:22:16] nothing going to stop it
[1:22:18] 1 the foreknowledge the foreknowledge
[1:22:22] lay on foreknowledge let's get a few
[1:22:25] right here that connects together
[1:22:27] go ahead which one well number 10 all
[1:22:31] right look at the wording now watch the
[1:22:33] wording we didn't come through all of it
[1:22:36] you know that God knew from the
[1:22:38] beginning in and God is to make it
[1:22:39] everything the clock tick you know but
[1:22:42] remember God's clock will be just
[1:22:44] exactly on time all these things has to
[1:22:46] be that way it has to all be done
[1:22:50] according to his great knowledge his
[1:22:53] foreknowledge four-by-four knowledge he
[1:22:56] could predestinate not by his desire but
[1:23:00] by his knowledge
[1:23:01] God doesn't predestinate by his desire
[1:23:05] he's not willing that any should perish
[1:23:07] but by foreknowledge he knew who would
[1:23:10] accept it and who wouldn't see he
[1:23:12] predestinated by foreknowledge so he
[1:23:16] could predestinate he can set a destiny
[1:23:22] well now if he sets the destiny I don't
[1:23:24] have to do it
[1:23:25] Oh remember one thing he saw it before
[1:23:28] you've thought it so don't get all tied
[1:23:32] up and how goody-goody things are
[1:23:34] running he knew before the world what
[1:23:38] you and I would do because he knew in
[1:23:40] his mind his foreknowledge then he could
[1:23:48] set a destiny he could have a seed
[1:23:51] forever age his last couple we read a
[1:23:53] seed forever age predetermined yes be
[1:23:59] called that he knew what they do he knew
[1:24:03] you'd want the word so you know what he
[1:24:07] had it for you he knew you'd want
[1:24:10] salvation you know already had it for
[1:24:12] you
[1:24:14] he knew it okay go ahead number eleven
[1:24:24] hold it up you can read all in between I
[1:24:27] just give you that part God's not
[1:24:28] willing that any should perish but
[1:24:30] they're all would come to repentance but
[1:24:32] in order to be God he had to know and
[1:24:34] the word predestinate is used in
[1:24:37] Ephesians predestinate there isn't a
[1:24:39] good word it means in speaking of
[1:24:43] predestination to the people sometimes
[1:24:45] leads them to the thing that God has
[1:24:47] predestinated you to push you through a
[1:24:50] little pop or something that's not right
[1:24:54] predestination looks back to what
[1:25:00] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to
[1:25:05] destiny now how does he know your
[1:25:10] destiny he predestinated my destiny I've
[1:25:13] got to do this I can't help it uh-uh
[1:25:16] wrong thing
[1:25:18] he saw you do it I said simple to me
[1:25:22] foreknowledge is God before the world
[1:25:24] knew he was going to make mankind a
[1:25:27] whole thing he had in his mind we'll get
[1:25:29] back to that from Christ's ministry I
[1:25:30] ask you to read that message and and
[1:25:33] it'll it'll tie together to show you the
[1:25:35] whole beautiful picture that God before
[1:25:37] the world he looked down and seen what
[1:25:43] you'd want
[1:25:44] just like he knew what Jacob would want
[1:25:50] he knew what you'd want he had it for us
[1:25:55] by his foreknowledge then he could set a
[1:26:00] destiny sure we ever one of us everybody
[1:26:05] in the world has a destiny a determined
[1:26:08] point at the end you would call it or
[1:26:10] whatever
[1:26:12] everybody has it because what God's
[1:26:15] foreknowledge he knows what we're gonna
[1:26:19] wind up and do but he knows why we're
[1:26:24] doing it cuz come on therefore God being
[1:26:27] God before the foundation of the world
[1:26:29] knew that who would be saved and who
[1:26:32] would not Roman Dave he could say that
[1:26:34] he hated Esau and loved Jacob before
[1:26:37] either child was born for by
[1:26:39] foreknowledge he knowed what a little
[1:26:41] shyster there that he saw would be and
[1:26:43] how he would save Jacob so therefore by
[1:26:47] foreknowledge God knew those things he
[1:26:50] for knowledge everything is for
[1:26:55] knowledge okay alright let's read a
[1:26:59] couple then we'll quit go ahead what do
[1:27:04] we got now it's number 12 as well stated
[1:27:12] look predestination looks back to
[1:27:15] foreknowledge now get that in your mind
[1:27:20] we're gonna give you about four or five
[1:27:22] quotes of the same statement the point
[1:27:26] to get it in your mind which comes first
[1:27:29] did he predestinate and then his
[1:27:32] foreknowledge coming or was his
[1:27:33] foreknowledge and then he would
[1:27:39] predestinate an end by his foreknowledge
[1:27:41] of knowing what that end would be which
[1:27:44] one is it which comes first for
[1:27:48] knowledge always comes first
[1:27:51] predestination looks back to
[1:27:53] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks
[1:27:55] own to destiny God in the beginning
[1:27:57] could see all things and that way no
[1:28:00] come on
[1:28:01] foreknowledge he wasn't willing that the
[1:28:04] left side would be wrong coffee knew
[1:28:07] that this would be he didn't want that
[1:28:10] to happen but so so therefore he could
[1:28:14] foretell what would be and he knew the
[1:28:18] end from the beginning that wonderful
[1:28:21] and to think that ever born again child
[1:28:24] of God deny has that privilege and
[1:28:28] assurance to know that God knoweth his
[1:28:31] own you say yeah but but brother Dale to
[1:28:37] discipline it note for knowledge I don't
[1:28:39] get no thrill out of just this
[1:28:42] foreknowledge you're not reading when
[1:28:44] he's saying for me to realize that God
[1:28:50] before the world ever begun in his
[1:28:53] foreknowledge you ever NAT that would
[1:28:56] ever bad it's I that's an infinite God
[1:29:00] and he would know whether I'd want to be
[1:29:03] saved or not and you know what he would
[1:29:06] come to the basis of what I want
[1:29:08] I like oh brother Tom far boys had a way
[1:29:11] of saying it like there he said you
[1:29:13] trigger your predestination that was
[1:29:16] this point you trigger your
[1:29:17] predestination you know how you trigger
[1:29:20] your predestination he knows exactly
[1:29:22] what you're going does
[1:29:25] but is what you're gonna do yeah I'm
[1:29:31] gonna for the next few services I'm
[1:29:33] gonna be laying heavily on one line you
[1:29:38] say but brother Dale we didn't have
[1:29:40] nothing to do with it
[1:29:44] God done it all you got a truth what you
[1:29:53] see if you didn't accept it God is not
[1:29:55] going to override your free moral agency
[1:29:57] and make you accept it so I draw the
[1:30:04] house of desire for God a desire and
[1:30:10] realize that before the world ever begun
[1:30:12] God would look down and see my desire
[1:30:22] you don't never think about time he was
[1:30:25] talking the other day about it you know
[1:30:31] I'm not bragging I just didn't drink I
[1:30:33] didn't smoke I didn't do those things he
[1:30:35] just it just wouldn't nothing for me I
[1:30:38] had the opportunities of doing out of
[1:30:40] all people around with with liquor or
[1:30:42] beer stuff in my car to keep him getting
[1:30:44] caught set it out and I'd go on my way
[1:30:49] Lissie I just didn't want it we ever
[1:30:53] thought about that God was setting the
[1:30:55] fire looking at that and said well you
[1:30:56] know what he didn't want that he's gonna
[1:31:02] wait a minute now you're crossing the
[1:31:03] line no I'm not crossing the line I'm
[1:31:05] her I'm walking the line
[1:31:09] I'm walking a line between works and
[1:31:12] grace grace is what God does for us
[1:31:16] works is what we do for him put them
[1:31:22] together and what you got a fine line
[1:31:25] that God looked down and realized what
[1:31:31] you would want
[1:31:34] and he come down to give it to you
[1:31:39] that's gonna be nicer for services okay
[1:31:44] so foreknowledge looks back and says
[1:31:50] that he foresaw this and knows that the
[1:31:54] reason he could tell what the end was
[1:31:57] from the beginning and therefore knowing
[1:32:00] that all those marvelous days that we're
[1:32:04] living in now and to stand and witness
[1:32:10] and see the things that we've seen God
[1:32:16] had to make a preparation for it you
[1:32:21] realize they some sitting in this
[1:32:23] building today that sit and saw prophets
[1:32:25] all the works and the signs and the
[1:32:27] wonders that's a wonderful thing I would
[1:32:30] love to been able to do that they might
[1:32:35] not have changed their partner but I'd
[1:32:37] love to have done it that's a joy you
[1:32:43] know what what if that has something to
[1:32:46] do with your salvation no salvation of
[1:32:51] the Lord
[1:32:52] no God don't pick and choose as we make
[1:32:59] it
[1:33:00] he picks and chooses by his
[1:33:03] foreknowledge as to know what you will
[1:33:06] do right he knows what you will do what
[1:33:16] you won't do as always a type of person
[1:33:21] that I could understand how that maybe
[1:33:24] this is a point of thought I could
[1:33:26] understand how that you've liked in the
[1:33:27] old days you know they take a
[1:33:29] handkerchief and they get mad at each
[1:33:31] other and they slap each others face
[1:33:33] with a handkerchief
[1:33:34] next morning they get out what turn
[1:33:36] shoot each other well I used to think
[1:33:39] about that I always had a problem and I
[1:33:45] couldn't couldn't keep that problem
[1:33:48] straight in one
[1:33:50] because I didn't want you slap in my
[1:33:53] face man
[1:33:55] our woman it was just I didn't because
[1:33:59] that's a disgrace that's I can
[1:34:02] understand why they kill each other
[1:34:03] because that's a disgrace
[1:34:05] they're just disgracing your name to
[1:34:07] think they're doing that because they're
[1:34:08] slapping you and I always wondered I
[1:34:12] forgetting save was my salvation good
[1:34:15] enough to keep me from if somebody
[1:34:17] slapped my jaws and I start work one day
[1:34:22] and the man he got to pinching me on the
[1:34:24] legs and doing I sitting on the table
[1:34:26] running a job he worked for me because I
[1:34:28] was the inspector and he'd come by and
[1:34:32] pinch me I said don't do that I said
[1:34:37] don't do it and he just live long well I
[1:34:44] caught him sitting on the table I walked
[1:34:47] over there and I said now don't pinch me
[1:34:49] no more do you understand these looked
[1:34:54] at me and I just took my hand on his
[1:34:56] knees if you ever had anybody do that to
[1:34:57] you
[1:34:58] if you don't hurt somebody sitting on
[1:34:59] the table just put you hand it on the
[1:35:00] knees and just come up real and snap it
[1:35:02] real quick and they'll come off the
[1:35:04] table because they're hurting in their
[1:35:07] legs and I meant to my point was I meant
[1:35:12] for him to understand don't pinch me no
[1:35:14] more he came off that table and he
[1:35:17] slapped me and I thought hmm
[1:35:25] and I stood out and looked at it he
[1:35:29] looked at me that's while he just turned
[1:35:35] walked off cuz I was standing there
[1:35:40] thinking hey I believe now I understand
[1:35:44] it I don't want nobody else laugh in my
[1:35:47] face again you know the prove the point
[1:35:48] I just I just got to the point I believe
[1:35:51] my point was proved that that I could
[1:35:52] take it a little while he came back up
[1:35:56] her and we just was friends from then on
[1:35:58] but you know what he never paints me
[1:35:59] again
[1:36:02] you see you say well what are you doing
[1:36:05] I'm saying one time sometimes God allows
[1:36:09] us to go through trials to find out
[1:36:11] about how much how well we said we are
[1:36:14] and don't you think his foreknowledge
[1:36:16] brings that up before you his
[1:36:19] foreknowledge that allows you to go
[1:36:20] through things to her that he can let
[1:36:23] you see who you are you know it wasn't
[1:36:26] for God that he gave Abraham the trial
[1:36:30] right he wasn't a benefit of God for
[1:36:34] Abraham to have a trial to offer his son
[1:36:36] it was a benefit of Abraham because
[1:36:40] Abraham found out he would do what he
[1:36:42] would do and God found out he'd do it
[1:36:44] and what I love about brother Brown
[1:36:45] saying about Abraham he said God knew
[1:36:48] Abraham and he said he knew that he
[1:36:53] teach his children
[1:36:54] oh that's always better you realize
[1:36:58] you're raising your children do you
[1:37:03] realize that you're instilling in your
[1:37:05] children the nature you want them to
[1:37:08] hell
[1:37:09] you realize this is within your hands to
[1:37:12] do those things so do it right for God
[1:37:15] okay come on he's not willing that
[1:37:20] anybody but get the point I've got the
[1:37:24] others here but if you want but just
[1:37:26] remember I'll he ended up saying this
[1:37:30] which comes first then did God
[1:37:33] predestinate something to be no he
[1:37:40] looked down through time and saw what
[1:37:42] would be he didn't predestinate it to be
[1:37:47] he saw what it would be but he saw that
[1:37:51] he could change us and fit us into a
[1:37:54] mold because that's what I believe about
[1:37:56] Christianity
[1:37:57] I believe the statue of a perfect man is
[1:37:59] molding you into an image of Almighty
[1:38:03] God that's the reason I believe what it
[1:38:05] says there to start with
[1:38:07] he says he what predestinated us unto
[1:38:12] adoption adoption of the statute
[1:38:15] perfect man he predestinated a group of
[1:38:18] people in this last days to come to that
[1:38:20] maybe everybody else didn't get that but
[1:38:23] this group today has got it she will
[1:38:26] come forward she'll be that come on
[1:38:27] musician but think about it cut it all
[1:38:29] on pointers I want you to say please
[1:38:31] come first
[1:38:37] godbye for knowledge for knowledge he
[1:38:42] could look down through time and see
[1:38:45] what you want he saw what Jacob was he
[1:38:50] saw what he saw was he saw their desires
[1:38:56] of what they wanted then he worked
[1:38:59] according to that we were to thank God
[1:39:05] for a trial that he would allow us to go
[1:39:07] through it allows us to go through
[1:39:13] trials and things to build our character
[1:39:15] in times and we ought to thank God for
[1:39:19] it
[1:39:21] let somebody ring you jobs to see
[1:39:23] whether you can take it on let somebody
[1:39:28] say something to you to see whether or
[1:39:30] not you pray for the person around back
[1:39:34] up the God by foreknowledge
[1:39:42] predestinated a destiny now are you
[1:39:45] listening foreknowledge predestination
[1:39:50] then if it's said of any form you think
[1:39:53] then it's automatically got to first go
[1:39:56] back to his foreknowledge because you
[1:40:02] can't predestinate you a sinner and then
[1:40:07] condemn you for being a sinner I agree
[1:40:09] he can't predestinate you to be a sinner
[1:40:12] but he can for about for knowledge allow
[1:40:15] you to go through life and seeing what
[1:40:18] you would be he can set a final destiny
[1:40:22] because he knows what you do
[1:40:27] you know what maybe you ought to think
[1:40:30] about your salvation there's people that
[1:40:36] would kill you at a drop of a hat
[1:40:42] there's people that would do anything in
[1:40:45] the world for you which one is God
[1:40:49] looking at you say yeah but now wait a
[1:40:51] minute you're making the owner work no
[1:40:52] no I've done been through all that we
[1:40:54] don't go that away but he knows exactly
[1:40:59] what your end will be but you know what
[1:41:02] you don't know it you don't know it
[1:41:05] until you come to the end of it then
[1:41:08] when you're finished you'll look back
[1:41:11] and say God was with me all the time he
[1:41:18] was there all the time
[1:41:19] and all of my heartaches and troubles he
[1:41:24] didn't predetermine it to be he knew it
[1:41:27] would be he's there because he knows
[1:41:30] what you have need of you don't get
[1:41:33] nothing out of the message get one thing
[1:41:37] predestination if anything you look at
[1:41:40] and think about it being predetermined
[1:41:42] just remember it automatically got to go
[1:41:44] back to its for knowledge because dire
[1:41:48] is where it comes from that's it's in
[1:41:53] order the motion and if you follow that
[1:41:56] line you might find out that there is a
[1:42:01] lot to do with us and the Bible says to
[1:42:06] work out your own salvation but it says
[1:42:11] we can't we can't work out our salvation
[1:42:16] but it says we've got to work out our
[1:42:19] salvation then we've got a lot of things
[1:42:23] in the Bible that takes looks like it's
[1:42:24] just splittin going in every direction
[1:42:27] but it'll come together to make a
[1:42:28] beautiful picture you work out your own
[1:42:31] salvation you have something to do with
[1:42:36] your life every day
[1:42:39] no God no no no God allows you and I a
[1:42:46] life to be lived he likes to see what
[1:42:52] we're gonna do with it
[1:42:54] so what are we let Stan you say yeah but
[1:42:57] use a funniest guy I've ever heard of
[1:42:59] salvation
[1:42:59] cuz you sound like one thing it goes
[1:43:01] this way no remember they'll come
[1:43:03] together they'll come together if you
[1:43:08] just give it enough time and work it out
[1:43:11] okay go ahead run breezy
[1:43:24] Heavenly Father I appreciate
[1:43:31] you
