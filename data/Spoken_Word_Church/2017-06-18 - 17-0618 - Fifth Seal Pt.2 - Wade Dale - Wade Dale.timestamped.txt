[0:04] happening when I'm from the rapture
[0:06] takes place all right but now he's not
[0:09] remember to and I in it
[0:11] it was wonderful what broke in took six
[0:14] eel all about Genesis one in beginning
[0:18] God created heaven to the earth and then
[0:20] he come to know where there was a
[0:21] disruption of total destruction of
[0:22] nature in Noah's day that was total
[0:24] destruction of nature in a hen's day by
[0:28] saying there was a total disruption to
[0:30] nation he went right down through always
[0:32] an element disruption of nature when
[0:34] Jesus Jesus got it come on man it'll be
[0:36] more like that no one ever been born
[0:39] like that man so there was a disruption
[0:40] of the natural flow of what went on
[0:42] during the dying this human life one two
[0:46] three all right so which was one two and
[0:49] three and brother critic long you know
[0:52] the brother that was here this Gunder
[0:55] was not service he's been studying on
[0:59] the dimension student so me and him put
[1:00] some of our notes together and I got a
[1:02] lot further and he got off further so we
[1:04] were sitting in we will beat the table
[1:06] resource in the mother who wanted what
[1:07] we were delivered to that was get
[1:08] comments cause you're home so uh it was
[1:12] great fruit so now if it's eel
[1:16] [Music]
[1:18] we must see you know I always talk about
[1:23] I can feel that you you know the onions
[1:25] the onion but there's a little small
[1:27] layer if you keep having to pull back
[1:28] and it's really easy to kind of thing is
[1:31] when you cut it with the knife
[1:32] sighs sharp shot back it's oh I didn't
[1:37] wanna mention them sorry
[1:39] they're my turtle head before you
[1:42] forget Mary Hart yes I told him
[1:49] not to be on that you know the third
[1:51] full America hope is gonna have to come
[1:52] in a hurry or some that is rotor because
[1:56] I had a human anything and he said there
[1:59] was a man and he's looking today and
[2:02] he's acting like it's some kind of a
[2:03] bomb like it's a bomb he's going have
[2:07] made one stroke yet Joanna Bob Bob he
[2:12] has not made one yet he's going in like
[2:18] I could get attacked
[2:21] so that was mentioned a touch something
[2:22] makes and I wanted invite him so my my
[2:24] name is cut so I grabbed an outgoing I
[2:27] cut top up on a hand back to him and
[2:29] he's over Maginot nine and then Tony law
[2:31] was what there's the Bob you could that
[2:33] onion if you turn her over he was
[2:35] cutting with the sharp edge up everybody
[2:41] thank you crops I make yes but there was
[2:46] an onion peel in there little bit that
[2:50] was gold why anything there isn't here
[2:53] make sense there was an onion peel and a
[2:55] sharp short of the word come on thank
[2:59] God it is two-sided
[3:02] angle or disaster has got two ages on it
[3:06] so they're done my wish that ball
[3:08] drybeck anywhere everybody a memory the
[3:13] other had a chance I needed he needed so
[3:22] how you go up like that you find out
[3:25] your does Nathan knows their way around
[3:26] the kitchen
[3:28] [Music]
[3:36] also internet people no one pocket well
[3:44] then if I know
[3:46] oh that one but anyway the sharp sword
[3:50] of the word though you cut that and you
[3:52] to start people behind what is it it's
[3:54] the same onion but it's a different well
[3:56] alright so we're looking at a different
[3:57] level here than just a fifty love jus
[4:02] that's what I'm gonna talk about today
[4:03] other than fifth seal do like like the
[4:06] sea seal is into the disruption of
[4:08] nature through two prophets they will
[4:10] speak what we're gone but it affects us
[4:13] now in our own cell and in any effective
[4:17] no way it affected a permit are able to
[4:19] Abraham in fact that although three
[4:22] times it has it back alright because
[4:25] remember the seal three Turtles seal
[4:27] just didn't open and develop because
[4:30] Christ is still sealed so everything
[4:32] that's wound up in the seals of welcome
[4:34] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[4:36] and forever
[4:38] all right the seals when Janice is just
[4:41] like a cold row couple Sundays ago held
[4:42] it the spirit of Cain and Abel you can
[4:45] see that white horse rider and a red
[4:47] horse rider and the pale horse rider
[4:50] coming right down through those people
[4:53] is obtained enabled right and how they
[4:56] came when out from the presence of God
[4:58] and there was your total death or your
[5:01] annihilation
[5:02] because remember what we gonna rap sure
[5:06] if judgment for everyone else except
[5:09] 144,000 so we leave when we go into the
[5:14] presence of God that was a problem he
[5:16] went out of the presence of God when we
[5:18] go into the presence of God we go up but
[5:22] now what happens down here the presence
[5:26] of God has lifted off the Gentile a
[5:28] distance Asia it's always going to be
[5:30] with 144,000 all right so there is a you
[5:35] know there's a time here where the
[5:36] there's 144,000 I'm also gonna be saying
[5:40] okay all right
[5:44] Gentiles you can't put a block Walid
[5:46] away because it's just making me people
[5:48] but this fifth seal up now let's take
[5:51] the fifth seal and we can tie it all the
[5:55] way back to the book of Genesis because
[5:57] that fifth seal is a word that we
[6:00] haven't brought in yet
[6:01] the let's read at minimal noon we'll
[6:02] bring it in because watch what happened
[6:05] we had opened the fifth seal I saw under
[6:08] the altar the souls of them that were
[6:13] slain for the word of God and for the
[6:15] testimony which they held right now for
[6:20] testimony of Jesus Christ
[6:21] now assault under the altar crying how
[6:24] long how long is this there these people
[6:26] but now I don't know if I got it in the
[6:28] cult this afternoon but brother round
[6:30] talks about the theophanies that he saw
[6:32] in the sixth dimension when what they
[6:34] were sold under the altar crying how
[6:36] long not to avenge our blood these
[6:39] people were trying to avenge our blood
[6:41] so the ones that are in the city
[6:43] dimension are now under the testimony
[6:46] not that they bill I don't want to go
[6:50] into my Raja I won't go in and so I've
[6:53] done so I've taken and accept what he
[6:57] has done in that state dimension is the
[7:00] testimony of Jesus Christ
[7:02] that they held on the face of the earth
[7:04] so that six dimension is much different
[7:07] than the fifth domain
[7:08] the other dimension because the state
[7:10] dimension is where you have your souls
[7:14] under the altar that were here accepted
[7:17] Jesus Christ as their personal Savior
[7:19] God born again and then God put them
[7:22] into that dimension okay
[7:23] this step sealed Jew is not in that
[7:26] dimension per se the man extended per se
[7:30] because remember what roads are given to
[7:32] them okay and we may cover that it's
[7:34] afternoon a little bit more choking
[7:36] something coming down the mountain
[7:37] yesterday it was really it really helped
[7:39] me understand a little bit more
[7:40] continuity what's going on with our soul
[7:43] with our be open e with our the one the
[7:45] questions are there I got two questions
[7:47] if afternoon and try to cover them all
[7:50] on that Genesis 1:26 minutes so we don't
[7:52] do a little Sunday School class upstairs

[8:05] familiar Tim him Jurchen he's about my
[8:07] age
[8:08] please black brother real to proceed
[8:10] what pre-sewn just can't because I
[8:11] looked at his note so I'm sitting right
[8:13] on folded up and there's no a piece of
[8:15] notes up

[8:47] do my number four bought horse you know
[8:50] I'd like to do about face painting toes
[8:53] hey buddy
[8:56] that you can make oh you did coming son
[9:00] no yeah sure
[9:02] yeah when he had opened the fifth seal I
[9:04] saw it as part of a soul level or slain
[9:06] for the word of God now look the word of
[9:11] God why our world think we're going to
[9:15] break this down a little bit today while
[9:18] were they slain for the word of God
[9:23] remember this group is used while we're
[9:27] they explained for the word of God
[9:28] because all the Old Testament said they
[9:31] were going to be even the Bible in the
[9:36] New Testament it and then then in the
[9:38] old template says they were killed all
[9:40] the day long in other words the Jews are
[9:42] going to be dispersed you're going to be
[9:43] a despised nation you're going to be
[9:45] found Wars what what is that is what the
[9:49] Word of God was telling you the gym
[9:52] since you turned me down this is what's
[9:55] not happening to you
[9:56] because remember when she went whoring
[9:58] in the Old Testament and God put her
[10:01] away in divorcement
[10:03] he said you're in trouble Jacob's
[10:06] trouble you have trouble all your days
[10:08] even now you're going to bring Jacob's
[10:10] trouble all the way over to here because
[10:12] what is the what is the the tribulation
[10:17] for the Jew is called Jacob come because
[10:21] of what Jacob did all the things that
[10:23] you did they were slain for the word of
[10:25] God and for the testimony which they
[10:29] held
[10:29] now that's brain that all the whether
[10:31] you say well what about the 50 of you
[10:34] with just the property guys tonight with
[10:36] in Hitler's you know the 6.5 million
[10:39] Jews will they were slain with the Word
[10:42] of God they turned the Word of God down
[10:44] and the Word of God said right here I'm
[10:50] going to protect a group of people
[10:52] because they turned me down but not only
[10:54] they turn me down
[10:56] I handle
[10:57] I had to put my hand basically in other
[11:01] words no further amount of Revelation
[11:05] okay cuz remember when Jesus was here
[11:08] some bleep it was the Messiah even in
[11:11] there in John I believe it in 1400 where
[11:14] they believe doing positively don't even
[11:17] live vaccine versus later they turned
[11:19] him they turned away running same people
[11:21] yeah we believe you know all that Matt
[11:24] we're out of paper come they work out of
[11:26] their body to know that you know so they
[11:28] were slain for the word of God that
[11:30] before they were written before the
[11:31] foundation in the world okay and now
[11:35] what we're doing is see and now that is
[11:37] being fulfilled on one group of people
[11:39] not this 144,000 there's another group
[11:43] there's another group of people which is
[11:46] the physio team hi maybe we say they're
[11:53] all Jewish La Trobe forgiven they're in
[11:57] another dimension and is no combat be
[11:59] all right so we have moved from the
[12:02] combat Beach which is in this dimension
[12:04] combat beast work here
[12:06] all right then when we then the holy
[12:09] those lifts off the earth with us when
[12:12] we leave the Holy Ghost leave where
[12:14] Gentile people gonna say honestly so
[12:17] they leave out of this dimension we go
[12:20] into another dimension right now so the
[12:25] fifth seal Jinzo once they're killed in
[12:28] this dimension they go into another
[12:30] dimension so this is another dimension
[12:33] we're talking about that John one two
[12:37] three and four is right here this
[12:41] dimension this is where these happen
[12:44] okay - uh I'm talking about uh we get
[12:48] the supernatural part of it happen to us
[12:50] one two three four see we have no part
[12:52] of this
[12:55] if you're well you can cancel out out no
[12:58] you have to look at the onion peel you
[13:00] got to feel like another layer and see
[13:03] what God is telling us because they were
[13:07] playing for the word of God what the
[13:09] Word of God is what protected them the
[13:11] Word of God is what gives them why rose
[13:13] they didn't deserve it well you mean you
[13:16] didn't either so you can say we deserve
[13:19] it made in now on one level we're just
[13:23] like the pit sealed you the only thing
[13:26] is is that God set the word to the
[13:28] Gentiles and we accepted what he did we
[13:33] accepted salvation we accepted
[13:36] Redemption yes that's my god Donald
[13:38] cross these did not but we all started
[13:41] in the same way we all started under one
[13:46] word but without that we're all did
[13:54] allow grace by grace are you saved
[13:57] through faith okay now they're gonna be
[14:02] saved by grace with no faith in Jesus
[14:06] Christ because God said I have blinded
[14:09] my people that you know what you say it
[14:13] in it's my fault
[14:17] how can I condemn them when I was doing
[14:19] it and one of the brothers would speak
[14:24] preaching on love and it was really good
[14:26] because love being corrected the only
[14:30] way not to love me in us put us on bring
[14:32] more legs as you only link on to look
[14:37] think about it if we come down here is
[14:41] just zombies and just you know we're
[14:43] just here and we're going to be and I
[14:48] don't have a choice I've got to go this
[14:50] way know what love is that there's no
[14:53] love the love partying is put you down
[14:56] here and give you a choice give you a
[15:00] choice and then you choose what greater
[15:03] what greater joy that you choose and you
[15:07] know what the people that they go help
[15:09] they choose you go ahead God chose to
[15:12] save them but they're gonna choose to go
[15:15] help someone so I was going to say some
[15:16] say that's your choice resurrection we
[15:19] have free moral energy right up to the
[15:20] change I mean it continued drop from
[15:23] Adam all the way up to now you say well
[15:25] no that was not no still got three more
[15:28] legs go all the way up to the change of
[15:30] the body because you decide what you
[15:31] tricked anybody
[15:36] sure you weren't interested that's right
[15:41] that's right they received them so with
[15:44] that so they were slain for the word of
[15:47] God so the Word of God stood they were
[15:48] going to be slain the Word of God said
[15:50] this will be a Gentile bride
[15:51] that's going to what be called by his
[15:55] name
[15:56] these are not these are not called by
[15:59] the name of Jesus Christ reason 3 the
[16:01] fifth seal resurrection this is the
[16:03] testimony which they held not the
[16:05] testimony of Jesus cuz you know what
[16:07] their testimony was we are God's people
[16:11] period we are Jews because remember the
[16:16] Word of God that slayed them is also the
[16:20] Word of God is going to save them they
[16:22] only hear the word of God that slays us
[16:25] or is going to save us all right so so
[16:28] we think so much then when I got this
[16:30] box right here we go
[16:32] we got to get out of the box there's no
[16:36] one person there's only group of people
[16:38] devolve does another 41 now you and I
[16:40] are just that's when I leave us that's
[16:47] why we must think eternal that's why the
[16:50] eternal thoughts of God work for us
[16:54] we'll cover this afternoon with identity
[16:56] 1.6 minute sure the Word of God gives
[17:01] twice as well I'm working on another
[17:03] sermon to where there's a will there's
[17:05] lay my free will but God's will does it
[17:10] all they say but my will has got a match
[17:14] his will he wrote a will all his
[17:19] subjects he wrote in a will and this is
[17:22] it will - where there's a little there's
[17:24] a way I couldn't if my parents never
[17:27] left me anything and wrote a well they
[17:30] wrote a well did leave me anything
[17:32] how getting them right the will tells me
[17:36] that I get some the wheel tells me that
[17:39] I get
[17:40] so they were slain for the word of God
[17:43] and the testimony which they held so
[17:48] this is a group of people that's all
[17:50] Jewish saying under this seal
[17:54] now like I said there's an appeal
[17:56] there's me in you because we all live
[17:59] under grace what is great unmerited
[18:05] favor unmerited favor you to all the
[18:09] were different from them how I think you
[18:13] get grace by the marriages hair grace is
[18:16] unmerited favor like I said you say
[18:18] don't think about grace there's no way a
[18:20] human being has ever ever come up with
[18:23] grace there's no way because we always
[18:26] fetch it we always say this one and this
[18:30] one no admission yes indifferent
[18:33] unmerited favor is God put it out there
[18:38] you who would accept it and who wouldn't
[18:41] and he has this waiting ohmy God he's
[18:44] the same thing with a Liz and he had it
[18:46] wait until now to the need
[18:47] I think I'll read this afternoon where
[18:49] brother Brown said that blood sacrifice
[18:51] was back in Bernard Mifflin doctor but
[18:55] she got go further than that in mind
[18:56] doggy sweet Jesus Christ for members of
[18:58] the world all right thing I go back
[19:00] further than that but then you come into
[19:02] the garden there's and I'd make it an
[19:04] animal sacrifice to cover why I believe
[19:07] that someone me you try think of grace
[19:15] think of the grace of marriage and
[19:16] divorce think of the grace that beef
[19:17] look you and I pass judgment on a people
[19:22] that did not go by the Word of God
[19:27] killed zord of God in flesh
[19:32] kill oh and here we are we're judge
[19:35] we're standing here will judge all they
[19:38] have is attack money how would you how
[19:41] would you I'm God's people God's troll
[19:43] men but look at you you killed god
[19:45] you're still doing the things you're
[19:47] doing you know you like we would say
[19:50] you're cutting hair you wearing paying
[19:51] you know you kidding now where is that
[19:57] here we're do's and don'ts right here
[20:04] well show me right in here where where
[20:06] dude and oh it's a testimony that they
[20:13] held so how far are we from them we're
[20:17] not we're not we're just like them the
[20:20] other thing is we have grace through
[20:23] faith that Christ died for us and we
[20:26] accepted what he did
[20:27] no they they did is they just accepted
[20:30] it what Jehovah which they all know that
[20:32] Jesus Christ Jehovah said the Jesus of
[20:37] where the people in other word bear say
[20:38] where the people talk when we tell them
[20:42] whether we because remember over there
[20:46] now and even I think about this other
[20:49] thing that decision that has me cuz
[20:52] brother around painted to that we know
[20:53] it was it was Jews from back from
[20:55] Jesus's time gross 5th elder brother
[20:57] battle brings it in that distilled you
[20:59] there people went to that concentration
[21:01] camp that was probably murderers and
[21:04] liars and thieves and whoremongers and
[21:05] no Stella Leny
[21:07] so God will give me someone tells you
[21:10] you you just that and you just that next
[21:14] day you leave it to die
[21:17] God said this God said to the Prophet
[21:20] that the fifth seal Jew would make it
[21:21] white robes are going to be given to
[21:24] them because God Himself blinded the
[21:26] island of his own children and he is
[21:29] going to extend them more grace than
[21:31] you'll ever know remember the old story
[21:34] when you get to heaven you
[21:37] as a group of people laughing it's Latin
[21:39] over there - what these people have
[21:41] initially these didn't unknown we got to
[21:43] work
[21:44] I didn't think these people gonna make
[21:46] it this one around they made it to worry
[21:48] laughing right there laughing Co didn't
[21:50] thank you so then you'll add great they
[21:56] told us he said there's no big people
[21:58] there that you didn't think there would
[21:59] be like and there's not gonna be people
[22:01] there that you saw was laughing all
[22:02] right so what is that great so this bit
[22:06] feel to me is nothing but the highest
[22:10] apex of running of divine grace there's
[22:16] ever been bestowed even on a group of
[22:19] people but also menu because we're not
[22:21] that far from them listen people we term
[22:25] God now then you're not when you do the
[22:29] things in the world your terms on family

[23:18] who he was
[23:19] does thou not judge and avenge our blood
[23:23] now look

[23:31] blood on them that dwell on the earth
[23:33] what about me in you God why is that
[23:37] person can't you do something about that
[23:39] person is persecuted Lincoln hello I
[23:42] don't have any happened to me in you
[23:44] know I judge these people but remember
[23:49] when the hose really dropped in sideways
[23:51] what burger I'm sure you say God forgive
[23:52] that perhaps may God forgive the person
[23:55] that's because the inside man these
[23:58] people don't have the inside man yet not
[24:01] yet in this part of the script okay but
[24:04] watch when they say this look at media
[24:07] what happened God down the last drew say
[24:11] well black dog owners no better than
[24:13] around oh and I don't know he's good in
[24:15] water over now where's the handicar lies
[24:19] do what about grace how long O Lord holy
[24:25] and true because thou not judge and
[24:27] avenge our blood there was nowhere in
[24:32] here the probably God said where they
[24:34] said Father forgive them for they know
[24:35] not what they do see so that's an
[24:36] attitude of someone without oligo okay
[24:40] that's an attitude good and avenge our
[24:45] blood but what their meds in the end of
[24:47] this is the greatest point of grade
[24:49] because they were available good what he
[24:51] never answered except down here right
[24:55] here what was that rejected blood white
[24:58] room for giving under your blood
[25:03] in other words I'm going to give you
[25:06] something you're not even asking for
[25:09] they're asking for life avenge our blood
[25:13] you know blood for blood I for now
[25:14] they're still back in the Old Testament
[25:15] hybridizes Burton jameth angry Jehovah
[25:20] and white robes were given unto every
[25:23] one of them looks like he calmed down a
[25:25] little bit because they're not saying
[25:26] anything yet and it was said unto them
[25:29] that they should rest yet for a little
[25:32] season until their fellow-servants right
[25:38] and their brethren that should be killed
[25:41] as they were should be fulfilled now
[25:44] remember the only point is 144,000 is
[25:48] going to receive the holy oak but some
[25:51] of these others are just going to be
[25:52] killed why because the review program
[25:54] said they were killed because they were
[25:55] you
[25:55] Hitler killed them because they were of
[25:58] a Jewish race no other not because they
[26:03] ensure their who underline think that
[26:05] people will tell you that the Jews had
[26:06] the money and different needed money and
[26:07] they turned him down but hey if it was
[26:09] hard you it's now right but what
[26:14] happened is that those hundreds of zone
[26:18] bulletins I mean hundred thousand a
[26:20] month to learn about invalid demons were
[26:22] released in Iowa and Hitler and I made a
[26:27] choice
[26:28] what to kill the Jew with this bull
[26:31] building he was fulfilling the Word of
[26:35] God and then it was fulfilling the Word
[26:39] of God and they died under one testimony
[26:43] word you we are God's chosen people just
[26:47] like Graham I raised my soul set up
[26:49] there it goes desk is your look I can't
[26:51] help I'll born here I am God's people
[26:55] because he told me see then you get
[26:58] supple that's what there does their God
[26:59] set on his children
[27:02] they don't see though that that guy came
[27:04] over and became Jesus miles to die for
[27:07] their sins but you know what
[27:09] he died morning anyway he died for their
[27:12] sins up he died for this group so
[27:13] there's no way they can be give a white
[27:15] road unless Christ I'll uncle I'm dr.
[27:18] payoff Hillary he's people to be fitted
[27:20] okay that's why it's really hard I'm
[27:24] telling you it's really really hard so
[27:26] might does something against you and
[27:29] then they get born again you still got a
[27:33] memory of what that person done to you
[27:35] when I will tase up and it's hard to say
[27:38] that God has forgiven them and lock
[27:40] their slate clean
[27:43] never to be remembered again it may not
[27:46] the Holy Ghost
[27:47] they're not ever do it again number one
[27:49] number two is they were going to be
[27:50] brought up but you're going to have it
[27:52] people in your life that you've seen
[27:54] that you've done bad things to they'll
[27:57] see you standing up in judgment they
[27:58] going to wonder what the world have them
[28:00] but you got to remember Christ is just
[28:03] the only thing he's going to say here he
[28:04] said they accept is what I did for me
[28:07] and you did it's always eyes right so
[28:11] this does it we did them self okay and
[28:15] they try with a loud voice and a little
[28:18] more holy and true dost thou not judge
[28:19] and avenge our blood on them that dwell
[28:22] on the earth right and white robes were
[28:24] given unto every one of them
[28:26] it was center than them but they should
[28:28] rest yet purple seasons numbers they're
[28:30] in the ground resting right until their
[28:35] fellow-servants also and their brethren
[28:36] would just watch you that's his rafael
[28:39] servicable
[28:40] that should be killed as they were
[28:41] should be full bill actually come up
[28:45] here now to official G with now watch
[28:51] these one I wrote were given now what
[28:54] they're going to do is that grace of God
[28:56] is going to bring them
[28:57] Packard career all Jews let me just put
[29:02] it this way all Jews that were
[29:05] persecuted I don't know that they're
[29:07] just all going to be loved
[29:09] you're feeling they collect don't use it
[29:12] don't care about things you what I'm
[29:14] saying now is those people they're over
[29:15] the integral reality to walk around
[29:16] third you introduce your filthy ism as a
[29:19] filthy center-right hangman a dilator
[29:22] thank you okay
[29:23] but this group of people that was
[29:26] persecuted they're going to be back here
[29:32] all right
[29:34] somehow like I get back here alright cuz
[29:36] it while Rome to give it to cause no
[29:38] they're do away with me feel free to
[29:40] wrap my hair okay into the Millennium
[29:43] what we believe and then 144,000 Jews
[29:47] and us go to the end of millennium
[29:49] because remember you gotta do something
[29:53] with them because their God give them
[29:55] what road got to hold that that's that's
[29:58] the whole ego so that whole ethos has to
[30:01] come back into this dimension into
[30:02] millennium
[30:03] Colette's always going to be here right
[30:07] it's all gonna be here you know you take
[30:11] about the needs of that I don't get on
[30:13] that I just think I yet so maybe I'll
[30:15] get later back now all that I have a
[30:19] hospitality but the Millennium is just
[30:23] going to be what all that is is 126
[30:26] which is the children of God 144,000 and
[30:32] then you got Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph
[30:35] and all those take part in the Old
[30:37] Testament where they come up I don't
[30:41] know yet I just think I'll it clear and
[30:43] it's not really clear message that I
[30:44] want presume
[30:46] our venture without authority so let's
[30:49] just leave it to be that somewhere that
[30:51] if they're given White Rose they got
[30:53] show up somewhere they don't go to
[30:54] judgment because remember if they go to
[30:56] judgment listen it mean you go to
[30:59] judgment we're in trouble
[31:01] right now they may be a great guy gives
[31:04] you great for your image or you're
[31:08] blinded by a vault Shepard that's what
[31:12] the problems in they use that Lewis
[31:13] version that's cool it's version that's
[31:15] not the bride that's most version come
[31:17] to fully there's only there's only
[31:20] commits these scripture people are going
[31:23] to not go through the great white throne
[31:27] the Gentile bride 144,000 in the fifty
[31:32] of you because the Bible says white
[31:34] robes were given to them already they
[31:36] don't have been in the judgment 144,000
[31:38] going to receive the new birth here so
[31:40] late oh those are good I mean white
[31:42] throne judgment I don't mean judgment in
[31:44] the flesh
[31:45] I mean the white room and everybody
[31:47] stands before Michael and Jasmine this
[31:49] group of people right here will not be
[31:53] standing before judgment they will be
[31:56] standing engine oh my god that because
[32:00] then then grace is still going to abound
[32:05] but I've said many times before you know
[32:08] you yeah you may think she's very
[32:10] insignificant don't talk legend maybe
[32:13] don't have a lot of revelation but all
[32:15] they got to do is you go down the road
[32:17] and somebody stops and changes your time
[32:19] or somebody gives you a cup of water so
[32:22] I put you in line first
[32:27] come on y-you don't have to be preachers
[32:30] history and shining your light somebody
[32:35] hold the door for you to walk in you
[32:38] show that's insignificant
[32:40] well a couple of waters pretty
[32:41] insignificant really you can think about
[32:43] it just handsome by a water how many
[32:46] times some center grander to my
[32:48] superiors you look thirsty er bottled
[32:50] water so I snuck over get that and any
[32:53] kernel out these gonna throw blow
[32:55] through you into that person and gods
[32:58] going to give them so much greater good
[33:00] - you got what the guy did down here
[33:02] guess what I mean we can't develop that
[33:04] there's no way if we're standing in
[33:07] judgment we got our arms folded we're
[33:08] like dude you had three wives you run
[33:11] around 14 times you have 23 kids you
[33:14] kill the gun go down but then your daddy
[33:21] standing in the back she's going to let
[33:23] Matt Ordway mental oh no no in 2016 that
[33:29] man helped me inside the road and you
[33:32] said you wouldn't forget it then
[33:34] and now and you bring him back to the
[33:38] word and you tell us then this is what
[33:40] your were said and he says enter into
[33:42] the door Lord while great cf-18 we can
[33:47] as human beings we cannot develop the
[33:49] word grace and the way God developed her
[33:52] training which is unmerited favor God's
[33:55] going to give that man in her life
[33:56] because of one thing he did what worth
[33:59] it and he has to honoring work and he
[34:04] did it through someone that thinks
[34:06] they're so insignificant but yeah that
[34:08] meant will receive eternal life and be
[34:10] an eternity for eternity because of what
[34:12] you do
[34:15] so look at all the things you think of
[34:17] all you say well that that's happened to
[34:19] me before
[34:19] well it's happened to you what about all
[34:21] the people down to this this world is
[34:23] going to be full people there's seven
[34:26] billion people here now is we're not
[34:27] really crowded take four-fifths of the
[34:30] herbs and take some of the water out of
[34:31] it you have in 15 many people baby when
[34:36] you ain't gotta worry about social
[34:37] programs bathrooms and all that stuff
[34:40] you know you gotta bring it all together
[34:42] right bring it all in there you know
[34:44] well and gotta make sure this does all
[34:47] that they'll see but look at what how
[34:49] we're going to live what I'm saying if
[34:51] you're going my last too many people
[34:52] know I want more people in have them
[34:54] then what's going to be there oh Jesus I
[34:56] want more people that I owe dog have to
[34:59] create another world
[35:01] he said we create want to go live on why
[35:03] can't we go sit on them on Mars for a
[35:06] little while I'll come back gravel-walk
[35:08] fall below it this very so because if
[35:13] you look at that I believe then when
[35:16] brother Brown preach there's there was a
[35:17] lot of people preachers included back in
[35:20] 1963 that did not believe this you look
[35:24] so this hard for me to believe
[35:30] the gift of my eternal life today
[35:32] morning but it's a word of God right yes
[35:36] go back to the words on is the final
[35:38] resting place and everything is the
[35:39] words of the words I've said a couple
[35:42] wiring my name whereas I've said back to
[35:48] pin told the men that were slain for the
[35:52] word of God for the testimony which they
[35:54] held we are going to be with you now
[36:00] let's take it to the onion field - me
[36:02] and you we take the Word of God we're
[36:06] being slain by the Word of God every day
[36:09] we're being slain by one performance on
[36:11] this same two meters dying
[36:13] it used to be alive yeah man what's
[36:16] doing it the Word of God bottom line is
[36:18] the word thought it does everything okay
[36:21] that's why we must have master we must
[36:22] study ourselves too but we must have
[36:25] mastered to what to line up what we
[36:29] thinks going off on this side you know
[36:31] my brother branham you know there was a
[36:33] lot of people the commentaries of a lot
[36:35] of people that that deal with not
[36:36] a Jew that hated Jesus they had to turn
[36:41] around the Hannity they said let his
[36:43] blood be on us and our children that's
[36:45] why do you know that's why they're being
[36:47] persecuted now even backing them on
[36:49] World War two but we see now that we can
[36:54] send ourselves in the left by the grace
[36:57] of God the Word of God is their
[36:59] testimony what cares why do we hold up
[37:01] sex money Jesus Christ that he died for
[37:04] me not that I did this and I read 24
[37:07] books and I read and I and I look
[37:15] the only I know if you am
[37:18] okay the I am saying that I am going to
[37:23] be saved by grace through faith which
[37:26] means I gotta go free something I got to
[37:29] go what through a journey of
[37:31] justification sanctification baptismal
[37:33] double so anyway let's stop right there
[37:35] and we'll start again next Sunday a
[37:39] couple and fitzy got few more things in
