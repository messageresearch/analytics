[15:03] spot
[15:04] but you know what
[15:07] God's proud of him
[15:10] God allowed that to happen
[15:12] so his character
[15:14] same way with me and you he allows these
[15:17] things to happen so our character can be
[15:18] made manifest and we can see what if we
[15:21] didn't know what to work on
[15:23] he gives us that for us to realize what
[15:25] we need to work on what our strengths
[15:27] are what our weaknesses are to me that's
[15:29] his plan he planned to do that because
[15:31] he knew we'd need it
[15:33] and so we need to just take that plan
[15:36] and use it and looking forward Brother

[16:05] then we got other stuff coming but we'll
[16:08] be announcing that later on uh we sure
[16:10] miss everybody that's not here
[16:12] we uh
[16:14] we're praying for them sister Smallwood
[16:16] different ones Lord it just they just
[16:18] don't ever miss you know the they're
[16:20] here even when they're sick
[16:22] and we sure miss them and if they're not
[16:25] here they're sick
[16:27] yeah they can't say that to all of us
[16:29] but when if they're sick and they're not
[16:31] here
[16:33] but it's a fight you have to fight your
[16:34] way
[16:35] you have to fight your way here and you
[16:37] bite your way back get it right since
[16:39] we're back I heard you say there
[16:41] she said it is it's a fight it's a
[16:44] struggle
[16:45] but you know what I'd rather do that and
[16:47] gain eternal life
[16:50] than to lose my soul and go to hell
[16:52] all right
[16:53] gain the whole world
[16:55] but Lose My Soul
[16:58] brother Louise you know it's 10 000
[17:01] worlds that
[17:02] to me that's an awesome statement when
[17:04] it took a profit to be able to go back
[17:06] in the mind of God to even know there
[17:08] was ten thousand worlds
[17:10] but your soul is worth ten thousand
[17:13] worlds ten thousand of these
[17:15] all we think it's great because of of
[17:17] bezo and Amazon and uh
[17:21] and all those people like that if
[17:23] they're not born again they'll just
[17:24] vaporize into nothing their money their
[17:28] bank account their hunt I saw where
[17:29] somebody the other day with Bill Gates
[17:31] and over a hundred billion dollars now
[17:33] he was worth
[17:35] I can't fathom that I could spend it but
[17:38] I couldn't fathom that but it without
[17:40] God
[17:42] you got way more than he does
[17:44] way more ten thousand worlds worth than
[17:47] he does but the people like that that
[17:50] put on this world to prove one thing's
[17:52] for sure
[17:53] God's in control this whole thing
[17:55] and if you don't if you don't uh do what
[17:58] God says then it doesn't matter if
[18:01] you're rich because even even Jesus he
[18:04] loved that rich guy he loved that rich
[18:06] that rich Rich Young Ruler he loved him
[18:08] he said man come on Rich Young Ruler
[18:11] couldn't give him and then Jesus turned
[18:12] around and said it's really hard for a
[18:14] for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of
[18:17] Heaven because he'll always fall to his
[18:19] riches first
[18:20] and depend on that when you depend on
[18:22] God if you depend on God with zero
[18:24] dollars I'd rather do that and depend on
[18:25] myself with 10 billion dollars all right
[18:27] everybody with me on that that's what we
[18:30] got to look at we got to see that God is
[18:32] God's in control he's the one that's
[18:33] doing it and we're just gonna have to
[18:34] let go and let God all right so let's
[18:38] bow our heads I know we all have
[18:40] um things on our heart that we need to
[18:42] uh pray about and we appreciate each and
[18:45] every one of you being here
[18:47] and we love you with the love of the
[18:49] Lord thank you for all the support that
[18:50] you've given us and the support that you
[18:52] give the church and the cleaning of the
[18:54] church and getting everything keeping
[18:56] everything up and and we're working on a
[18:59] few other things to do and uh we just
[19:01] want to be uh ever in the will of God
[19:04] not in the will of ourself so let's bow
[19:06] our heads Lord thank you for this day
[19:08] that you give us
[19:10] Lord we now know that
[19:13] you are in control
[19:15] as the song says you've got it all
[19:18] in control
[19:19] and I pray Lord that you'd be with us in
[19:21] the furthermore this service you take
[19:22] control you speak to the people you go
[19:25] down there aisle Lord you you get into
[19:27] their life father not me you Lord teach
[19:30] them how to live better Lord how to be a
[19:33] better Christian
[19:34] Lord teach them how to pray teach them
[19:37] how to seek you father
[19:38] Lord just be with us now as we pray Lord
[19:41] for the sick and The Afflicted Lord the
[19:44] ones the ones that are not with us and
[19:45] the ones that are here today we pray
[19:47] that you would give them a supernatural
[19:49] touch Lord be with us Lord in the
[19:51] further of this service we give it all
[19:53] to you in the name of Jesus Christ
[19:55] amen
[19:57] all right in the beginning was the word
[19:58] where was with God and the Word was God
[20:00] and the Word was made flesh
[20:03] what kind of word is it it's a Living
[20:05] Word not a dead word not a dead letter
[20:07] it's a Living Word of God and the Word
[20:10] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[20:12] beheld his glory the glory of the only
[20:14] begotten of the father
[20:16] full of grace
[20:18] truth you can be seated in the Lord at
[20:19] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[20:21] second Peter 1 verse 5 says besides this
[20:23] giving all diligence add to your faith
[20:25] verse in the verse your knowledge
[20:27] knowledge Temperance Temperance patience
[20:29] patience godliness we're going to try to
[20:32] get to 10 patients we'll try to get to
[20:35] that sorry I probably preached a little
[20:37] bit this morning but I think we'll just
[20:39] kind of drop back and teach a little bit
[20:41] this afternoon slow down a little bit so
[20:43] that's all right with you
[20:45] man
[20:47] in your patience possess you your souls
[20:49] we're gonna we get to patience you're
[20:52] going to have to see that that patience
[20:55] brother Brown what do you say the first
[20:56] thing we had to have patience with not
[20:58] our neighbor not our somebody sitting
[20:59] beside you in church he said have
[21:01] patience with God
[21:03] so you got to have patience with God
[21:04] that he'll do what he said he will do
[21:06] all right so that's what we've got to do
[21:08] because I'll read you a quote where
[21:09] brother Brown said if you go out beyond
[21:11] the program of God you're just gonna
[21:13] keep up on the side of the road he says
[21:16] crap scrap heaps of ministers that go
[21:18] out past the program of God and we've
[21:21] seen it you've seen it we've all seen it
[21:24] we've seen him take a message and and
[21:26] brother Brown preached even you know
[21:27] like running without a message and all
[21:29] those things and you know running from
[21:30] the presence of the Lord
[21:32] you got to be in the right season at the
[21:34] right time
[21:36] and you've got to catch the mind of God
[21:38] and I believe that we have caught the
[21:40] mind of God because we know what time
[21:42] that we're living in we know what day I
[21:44] don't say we I say we every all of us
[21:47] sitting in here that we know what is
[21:50] coming
[21:51] we actually know who's going to do it
[21:55] but we know where we're going
[21:57] all right just as I said God knew
[22:00] everything and from the beginning he's
[22:02] now taught us from the beginning what it
[22:04] is that we're looking for
[22:06] where we come from what we're doing here
[22:08] where we're going right and to me that's
[22:11] the as as brother Dale's always said the
[22:13] opening of the seals is knowing where
[22:15] you came from what you're doing here
[22:16] where you're going well that's the whole
[22:18] Plan of Redemption
[22:19] the full plan not just to get your soul
[22:21] redeemed The Saul redeem started on the
[22:23] day of Pentecost that's and don't get me
[22:25] wrong but that's a 2 000 year old
[22:27] Doctrine
[22:30] that's a 2 000 year old Doctrine all
[22:33] right and it never gets any any any
[22:35] worse it gets better but
[22:39] add to your new birth so we're going to
[22:42] add to that what happened on the day of
[22:44] Pentecost back 2000 years ago in 80 30
[22:47] back in that in that time where they
[22:49] were in the upper room so we're going to
[22:51] add to that because what happened to
[22:52] Peter when Peter came out of that upper
[22:54] room he was the spokesman but remember
[22:56] he didn't write first Peter II Peter
[22:59] until a little bit later
[23:00] called you one filled with the Holy
[23:02] Ghost until then
[23:03] he didn't know how to get virtual
[23:05] knowledge and 10 patience and godliness
[23:07] and brotherly kindness but then he
[23:09] realized what God was doing in his life
[23:11] saying what your brother Brown and
[23:13] brother Brian was born again I think
[23:14] he's back in the 20s I think he got the
[23:16] new birth back somewhere in that way in
[23:18] his 20s he said he's born in 1909 I
[23:21] believe it was and and but he didn't
[23:24] preach statue of perfect man until 1960
[23:26] whatever it was 61 62. why he hadn't
[23:29] come to that stage yet
[23:31] he had to grow in Grace and knowledge
[23:33] just like me and you have to grow in
[23:34] Grace and knowledge he had to come from
[23:36] a baby listen you know what happened let
[23:38] me tell you what happened to brother
[23:38] Brown remember his first sermon he said
[23:41] I preach and and remember he preached
[23:43] and and hope he was illiterate hope had
[23:46] to read the Bible
[23:48] hope read the scripture and then he
[23:50] preached well the first sermon he
[23:52] preached you know I remember he thought
[23:53] man this is good I did a good job
[23:55] everybody enjoyed it and he goes behind
[23:57] and goes in the pastor studying the
[24:00] pastor Dr Davis looked at him and he
[24:02] said worst sermon I've ever heard
[24:06] brother Brown said what but they cried
[24:09] what brother what Dr Davis say they cry
[24:12] at funerals yeah all right so it wasn't
[24:15] an emotion so hey you know what that
[24:17] tells me
[24:18] if brother Brown can bomb in his first
[24:20] sermon so can we
[24:22] don't worry about when some of you get
[24:24] old get you know start preaching and you
[24:26] bomb don't worry the prophet bombed his
[24:28] first sermon all right I'm sorry that's
[24:30] what he said and I love it when brother
[24:32] Branham he's so honest
[24:34] and honest to tell us his his mistakes
[24:36] and honest to tell us even what he was
[24:39] thinking that he didn't have to tell you
[24:40] in me but praise God what was in his
[24:44] mind came out of his mouth now you and I
[24:46] may have a problem with that but if
[24:47] you're a prophet and let you and let God
[24:49] take control it's all right
[24:51] all right
[24:53] so add to your new birth so he so when
[24:55] brother Brown got bored again he had to
[24:56] add to brother Adam's new birth
[24:59] brother had to take a walk through
[25:01] justification sanctification baptism
[25:03] Holy Ghost as we were talking about this
[25:05] morning water to the ankles water to the
[25:07] knees water to the loins and then a
[25:10] river that you couldn't even you had to
[25:11] swim in it you had to learn how to swim
[25:14] all right now with the ankles you don't
[25:16] have to learn how to swim with the knees
[25:18] you don't have to learn how to swim even
[25:19] at the loins you could just walk through
[25:21] the water but buddy when it gets up
[25:22] about 10 foot deep you're going to
[25:24] either drown or learn how to swim one of
[25:26] the two all right so we're going to
[25:28] learn how to swim in this word of God
[25:29] all right get by with me we're going to
[25:32] minister nourishment look Minister
[25:33] nourishment to each one of us this ought
[25:36] to not be this ought to be the this
[25:39] ought to be the happiest time of our
[25:40] life to be able to sit in a congregation
[25:42] and hear the word of God and be able to
[25:44] sing the words of God they were the
[25:46] young adults were downstairs
[25:49] get my hand clap these younger dogs I'm
[25:52] telling you
[25:54] these young adults
[25:56] I see too many sitting out there on the
[25:58] on the street corners
[26:01] doing their stuff
[26:03] and they're enjoying it
[26:06] but I walked in that room
[26:09] and there was a song that been playing
[26:11] on the radio that I enjoyed
[26:14] it doesn't matter who's singing it
[26:16] you've heard me say that before I don't
[26:18] care who sings it they're all lost if I
[26:20] ain't got the new birth Toby Mac or
[26:22] anybody
[26:24] but it's the anointing behind the words
[26:26] that were that spoken that's true if
[26:28] they're saying about God that's true so
[26:31] this song Gyra I know you probably all a
[26:33] lot of you Maverick city news or
[26:34] Maverick City whatever it is not news
[26:36] and maybe receiving news what is it
[26:41] anyway so this this these PL these they
[26:44] sing it
[26:45] anyway it doesn't matter but they're
[26:47] getting together and they're saying and
[26:48] they have a choir and they have this guy
[26:50] playing the organ and or the piano and
[26:52] he's a black guy and I come to find out
[26:55] somebody says well he's a rapper I don't
[26:57] care
[26:59] the anointing to that song
[27:02] saying that Gyra
[27:04] Jehovah Jireh my provider
[27:07] and they sing that song and I walked in
[27:09] there and I told the young adults I said
[27:11] you've heard this song and they said yes
[27:13] I said I'd like for you to sing it um
[27:15] April for the uh well y'all don't know
[27:18] this but I I try to uh
[27:21] um voluntold
[27:23] when you hear these songs up here
[27:24] usually it's me asking them to do it
[27:26] either getting Sister Christine and and
[27:28] they're getting old now cantankers
[27:30] they're not doing it anymore so
[27:32] I went straight to the kids I didn't say
[27:34] you sister Trudy oh I'm sorry
[27:38] but I told them and I said go tell the
[27:40] you so I walked in there and I said hey
[27:42] guys you hear this song yep laid it down
[27:44] played it for him they said yep
[27:46] well they could have sung it today
[27:49] so much talent
[27:51] and a nine-year-old kid was leading them
[27:56] Zoe
[27:58] be led by a child I'm sorry she's 10.
[28:00] Lord Mercy forgive me
[28:03] goodness gracious but they jumped right
[28:05] in while you're saying these youth
[28:08] they get they get into that anointing
[28:10] and they know how to use it so I
[28:13] appreciate them singing those songs like
[28:15] that and I said you don't take it by
[28:17] that anointing out there you take it by
[28:19] your anointing
[28:21] to the people and if you say it by that
[28:24] anointing by the anointing of
[28:27] winning as always turn out right
[28:30] always turn out right so man they
[28:32] practice just a few times and they was
[28:33] they was comfortable with singing it so
[28:36] um I thank God
[28:38] that we've got a group of people
[28:41] that'll come together and sing those
[28:42] songs
[28:43] because I believe God's in song too you
[28:45] know
[28:46] right
[28:47] let's jump through this let's jump to
[28:50] this real quick so what was the fourth
[28:51] thing the fourth part of life is what
[28:53] the word we we looked at the dry bones
[28:56] we looked at the going into the water
[28:58] I'm going to try to get to these verses
[29:00] if you don't mind so what is it it's
[29:02] that Holy Ghost Bunch us Bunch us people
[29:05] being honed out so that it can fit the
[29:08] same kind of ministry he had when he
[29:10] went away that when he comes back it'll
[29:13] catch the whole thing who's the whole
[29:15] thing I'm looking at the whole thing
[29:18] he's not going to wrap your cars and
[29:20] airplanes and it's not going to Rapture
[29:22] your message book either
[29:24] it's not going to rap through your
[29:26] computer
[29:27] it's going to Rapture human beings that
[29:30] are born again by the Breath of God that
[29:32] have took the word of God and then
[29:34] there's going to be a group inside of a
[29:36] group
[29:37] come on somebody
[29:39] there's going to be a group brother
[29:40] Brown said there's been Brides brides
[29:42] churches Brides he's ever tell come one
[29:45] this is the one there's not another one
[29:48] we didn't we didn't have a we didn't
[29:50] have a preview of the bride and then a
[29:52] second preview of the bride and the
[29:54] third preview of the bride and then the
[29:56] fourth no
[29:58] brother Brown said it was two previews
[30:00] Alpha bride Omega bride the Omega bride
[30:04] got out of line it took a profit
[30:06] to get her back in line well you know
[30:08] what I believe we're back in line
[30:10] I just believe we're back in line so if
[30:12] we're back in line then this can happen
[30:13] it'll catch the whole thing in the
[30:16] Rapture with the Justified Sanctified
[30:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid
[30:20] will stand again the house of God will
[30:21] live again the Tree of Life
[30:24] where is that tree of life it's inside
[30:26] of you
[30:34] brother Brown said Christianity versus
[30:36] idolatry look he says we are made for
[30:38] takers of his Holiness we In His Image
[30:41] we are living images of a living God
[30:45] he don't want dead people he wants a lot
[30:46] of people he wants you dead to yourself
[30:48] look then dead to self raised with him
[30:51] now listen his word made flesh again in
[30:54] US O Brother Neville look what is it not
[30:58] the mythical imaginary God sitting out
[31:00] there but the Living God what is the
[31:03] Living God
[31:05] there's your answer the word in you
[31:07] makes it real
[31:10] glory to God oh I know you think I'm a
[31:12] Holy Roller maybe I am maybe I thought I
[31:15] hollered a little bit too much this
[31:16] morning but you know what
[31:18] get used to it
[31:20] but oh brother do you see it trap over
[31:22] every denomination trap over all
[31:24] paganism and I'm going to say over all
[31:26] your issues over all your problems
[31:30] he will help you because look the word
[31:33] of God which is God is made flesh in you
[31:36] because look the word of God and the
[31:39] word of the devil like I said before you
[31:42] take a high priest that high priest
[31:44] could only take the confession of the
[31:45] people back before God same way with God
[31:48] and and and Jesus Christ being our
[31:51] mediator there's not three different
[31:53] gods but it's a position
[31:57] did not Jesus pray he said father
[32:01] I pray that as you and I are one that
[32:05] the bride and mere one
[32:07] amen so we've had that prayer prayed
[32:09] over us in John 17. we've had that that
[32:12] he wouldn't take you out of the world
[32:16] Lord I'm not praying to take them out of
[32:18] the world in other words I don't want
[32:20] them to just have a flowery bed of ease
[32:22] I want them to be in the world but not
[32:25] of the world
[32:26] Lord he said father protect them so
[32:29] where's our protection come from our
[32:31] protection comes from our father amen
[32:33] every one of you that are fathers you
[32:34] are the protector you're your daughter's
[32:37] Holy Ghost until she gets it
[32:40] in the natural form
[32:42] and the word of God which is God is made
[32:44] flesh in you why you're seated in
[32:47] Heavenly places triumph over all things
[32:49] in Christ Jesus that's why I was telling
[32:52] them when they were singing you raise
[32:54] yourself up into a Heavenly atmosphere
[32:56] they may sing it and be a bunch of
[32:58] prostitutes and be a bunch of
[32:59] whoremongers
[33:00] but that song's anointed
[33:03] and when we catch the true anointing of
[33:05] that
[33:06] guess what that's what God wanted to
[33:09] start with that's what puts us in
[33:10] Heavenly places that's what puts me to
[33:13] be able to listen to that song and not
[33:15] have to worry about the past life or
[33:16] whoever's in it
[33:18] but I want them to sing it I want to
[33:20] hear it from their voice I want to hear
[33:22] from somebody who knows who Jehovah
[33:24] Jireh is that knows he's your provider
[33:28] all right I'm preaching now stop tell me
[33:30] my brother tell me my sister when was
[33:32] the time that the sons of God was ever
[33:33] to be manifested outside of this time
[33:35] right now
[33:38] we are now Sons and Daughters of God
[33:39] we're not going to be
[33:42] when was ever a time in history
[33:45] listen
[33:46] we talk about Lincoln and we talk about
[33:48] Washington and we talk about all these
[33:51] great people that we read about in
[33:54] history
[33:55] they're gonna all if they're not born
[33:57] again they're going to vanish
[33:59] they're not even going to be in your
[34:01] memory
[34:03] but there'll be a William Branham in
[34:05] your memory
[34:07] there'll be a Ron Spencer in your in
[34:09] your memory they'll be a Johnny Reagan a
[34:12] Samuel Dale a bob black that'll be in
[34:14] your memory
[34:16] that'll be what this world is waiting on
[34:18] it's not waiting on some great Jeff bezo
[34:21] or some great somebody else it's waiting
[34:23] on you
[34:26] things written in heaven your name's
[34:27] written in the palm of his hand
[34:32] what is the time to deliver all nature
[34:35] God deliver my nature first
[34:38] deliver this guy
[34:41] waiting for the time of manifestation
[34:43] why before the atonement was made before
[34:45] the Holy Ghost was ever poured out
[34:47] in the Old Testament on down there
[34:49] couldn't have been manifestation so
[34:51] who's making history
[34:52] you and I today are making history
[34:56] amen when we go through a testimony when
[34:59] we go through and we get healed or we
[35:01] get delivered from something you're
[35:02] making history
[35:04] you're making history that nobody else
[35:07] is gonna make
[35:08] sure Abraham Lincoln was a good
[35:10] president but he'll never be anymore
[35:14] I believe he was a Christian because
[35:15] brother Adam said he was a Christian
[35:17] so we'll get to see Abraham Lincoln
[35:22] but if he's not born again
[35:24] don't give me the presidency
[35:27] give me being the bride
[35:31] that's the manifestation of God that he
[35:33] wants he don't want you to be a good
[35:34] person
[35:35] God has never wanted you to be a good
[35:37] person there's a lot of good people it's
[35:39] going to be in hell
[35:42] but he wants you to be him
[35:44] he wants you to understand what he's
[35:46] saying he wants you he wants you like I
[35:48] said this morning that deep part of you
[35:49] that calls what's it calling for it's
[35:51] calling for him to come here
[35:54] because the coming of the Lord is what
[35:56] to the wall to the to the to the
[35:58] recorder to the to the uh you know no
[36:02] the coming of the orders to be in you
[36:05] the coming of the middle it's a
[36:07] revealing of
[36:13] you
[36:15] it's being revealed to you you're making
[36:17] history
[36:21] shaping up to a headstone to the
[36:23] manifestation the sons of God coming
[36:24] back and the spirit of God coming into
[36:26] these men look so perfectly until their
[36:29] ministry will be so close like Christ to
[36:31] join him in his church together how's
[36:33] that going to happen
[36:35] Ephesians 4 12.
[36:38] Apostle prophets pastors teachers and
[36:40] evangelists for what our perfection
[36:42] for the Perfection of the Saints if
[36:45] you're a saint then you're going to get
[36:46] perfected by that way in no other way
[36:48] are you going to get perfected
[36:51] then we talk about then we were talking
[36:52] about the two Prophets
[36:54] they're all waiting on
[36:56] waiting on that whole anointing that
[36:58] whole Malachi uh four anointing to them
[37:02] is waiting right here
[37:06] that Revelation is what is it seven or
[37:08] so where the two prophets go to Israel
[37:10] it's waiting right here
[37:13] it's barred there's no way it's going to
[37:15] go over there brother George until we're
[37:16] out of the way until he the bride be
[37:19] taken out of the way there's no way that
[37:21] scripture is going to be fulfilled we
[37:23] got to fulfill our part first listen
[37:25] Luther fulfilled his part God put him
[37:28] away he fought Wesley fulfilled his part
[37:31] put them away they all had a part listen
[37:33] they had a part in that plan I was
[37:34] talking about this was God's method of
[37:37] achieving an end
[37:40] and how many of you heard brother Dale
[37:42] say many many times he said what is the
[37:43] coming of the Lord what is the seventh
[37:45] seal brother Ryan said it's the end of
[37:47] all things well it's none then we're
[37:49] finished there's nothing else no it's
[37:51] the end of the struggling world he said
[37:53] it's the ends of this Cosmos it's the
[37:55] end of your issues
[37:56] whatever it is
[38:01] when we get over there we'll get
[38:03] delivered from it
[38:08] all right
[38:10] this is where we're gonna get delivered
[38:12] from it
[38:13] oh we are not going to get delivered
[38:15] from it
[38:16] and whose choice is that
[38:19] don't point at me
[38:21] I gotta point it myself
[38:26] look watch they uncover and open it up
[38:28] he's talking about the Sixth Seal so the
[38:30] Sixth Seal has got to in the spiritual
[38:31] form open with us on Earth not in the
[38:35] natural form it opens when the two
[38:37] witnesses appear to Israel and the
[38:39] Gentile church has got to be gone so by
[38:42] that we know that the seals were open to
[38:44] the Gentiles and that we're not here
[38:46] anymore the Raptors took place actually
[38:48] the dead in crisis Rose first and there
[38:50] will be changed so the body change
[38:52] there's glorified people walking all
[38:54] over the world all over the world yes
[38:58] because why
[39:00] because they've captured listen man has
[39:03] tried to capture
[39:04] nature
[39:08] clouds
[39:10] tornadoes man has tried to figure out a
[39:12] way to control all that
[39:15] so what have they figured out now
[39:16] they're controlling Me and You by the
[39:18] things that we do or don't do
[39:21] that covid-19 you believe whatever you
[39:23] want to it was a control Factor it was
[39:26] something to see how much you'll take
[39:28] and how much you'll not take see how
[39:30] much you'll do and how much you'll not
[39:32] do because listen we were talking about
[39:33] it yesterday me and somebody oh it was
[39:35] talking at the the Baptist friend that's
[39:38] first cousin of ours
[39:40] what one item
[39:43] I want to ask you something what one
[39:45] item that you can ever think of since
[39:47] you were a kid till now what one item
[39:49] took only about maybe two weeks
[39:53] to shut this whole world down
[39:58] oh we've had E coli over here we've had
[40:02] the Spanish Flu over here we've had this
[40:05] that we hear that happens over here we
[40:07] hear that this happened we had some
[40:10] smallpox at one time
[40:12] you know he and you had a group of what
[40:14] in two weeks
[40:16] they spread all over the world
[40:19] it was just like it was just like a it
[40:21] was just the demon but it just spread
[40:22] all over the world in a matter of two
[40:23] weeks
[40:27] control
[40:33] but what do we got to do as uh we'll get
[40:36] into patience in a minute because then
[40:38] the Bible says impatience like I said
[40:40] possess you your soul you've got to
[40:41] you've got to pull that thing down and
[40:43] say hey
[40:44] we got to believe God
[40:46] we gotta believe God for everything we
[40:49] make mistakes we make we got issues and
[40:51] problems that's okay we're going to have
[40:52] them until the day we get out of here
[40:53] but we're going to have to know how to
[40:55] handle them
[40:56] and you don't handle them by
[40:58] disappearing do you bro George
[41:00] thank you
[41:01] you do not have and me too I ran from
[41:04] this thing
[41:07] I'm looking to a bunch of people that's
[41:09] run from God in their life
[41:14] I got one amen and one that's it so the
[41:17] rest of y'all are Saints I'm preaching
[41:19] to these two right here me and me and
[41:20] these two right here are going to get it
[41:23] thank you very much go ahead
[41:26] but it is
[41:28] something we got to go through but we're
[41:31] going to come out on the other side but
[41:32] you can't be separated from God
[41:36] that Satan that wants to separate this
[41:38] thing
[41:40] let's continue on Psalms 42 verse 7 says
[41:43] deep calleth into the deep at the noise
[41:45] of thy water spout
[41:47] all thy waves and thy Billows are gone
[41:49] over me what happened brother Adam he
[41:51] walks through the he walks through the
[41:53] forest and he looks down at him and I
[41:55] see it on my route I've got a place on
[41:57] my route that two Springs come together
[42:00] and they just come out of nowhere
[42:02] I mean it's just Woods everywhere it's
[42:04] right on the side of the road right
[42:05] where the mailboxes are basically one up
[42:08] here or one down here and one up there
[42:10] um
[42:10] and you watch them even if it's not rain
[42:12] to drop back in the summertime
[42:15] here's this little bitty trickle of
[42:17] water running all the time
[42:20] now buddy of the last few weeks it's
[42:22] been like a flood
[42:24] but where'd it come from it come from
[42:25] that sprinkle there's nothing above it
[42:27] but just a big old slope going up to a
[42:29] couple of houses but there's a couple
[42:31] indentions in that in that Hill
[42:34] and that's where what that pressurized
[42:36] water from way down deep inside it's
[42:38] pushing between something a rock or a
[42:42] root or something just pushing right
[42:43] through between that and it's running
[42:45] through there doesn't take anybody you
[42:47] don't have to have a pump
[42:48] it just runs by itself and that's why
[42:50] Brother Bear looks at that stream he
[42:51] said why you do that you feel so you can
[42:53] cool the deer down so I can take a drink
[42:55] and do it no he said if the Supreme
[42:58] could have spoke what would it say
[43:00] there's something down inside of me
[43:03] that's pushing that water up out of the
[43:05] ground
[43:07] that's my question to you
[43:09] is there something inside of you
[43:11] pushing
[43:13] this word out of this ground
[43:17] listen folks we can't be dilatory
[43:19] anymore we played around with this thing
[43:21] long enough
[43:22] you either got to get excited
[43:26] are you gonna get left
[43:28] and I don't mean excited like shouting
[43:30] and running up in all the aisles you got
[43:31] to get excited about the word of God
[43:33] Amen
[43:34] you know what people will know if you
[43:37] get excited basically some of you that
[43:39] hadn't moved in years
[43:44] yeah I believe in Emotion
[43:47] sorry
[43:48] man what's a baby do when it comes out
[43:52] of the womb
[43:55] no
[43:57] screams
[43:59] let that word so oh she's asleep
[44:03] hit your niece she'll scream for you if
[44:06] you need it
[44:09] she ain't been quieter day in her life
[44:12] in that right
[44:14] and that's okay listen I'd rather her
[44:17] scream and keep everybody awake
[44:20] praise the Lord anyhow
[44:22] now before when the Deep calls for the
[44:24] Deep look before that can be a deep call
[44:26] there had to be a deep to respond in
[44:28] other words there had to be water
[44:31] there had to be water under pressure
[44:33] before that could be pushed out of the
[44:35] ground and then it just flow and be the
[44:39] prettiest white I mean not white but the
[44:40] purest Clear Water you've ever seen
[44:43] comes from a spring
[44:46] there's a River of Life flowing out a
[44:48] pure stream of water
[44:51] are the word of God
[44:53] before there can be a deep call there
[44:55] has to be a deep to respond to it as
[44:57] brother Rams says many times and you
[44:59] hear him he said there's Scott which one
[45:01] came first the fish or the water
[45:05] if the fish came first he just flops and
[45:07] dies but the water came first because
[45:10] God knew the fish would need the water
[45:13] so he knew we'd need the word of God he
[45:15] didn't just throw us out there and say
[45:16] here fight for yourself no he's right
[45:20] there fighting with us every time every
[45:21] day we just deny
[45:24] come on we just deny we need help
[45:28] we're in denial
[45:29] and denial is a river
[45:34] think about that for a minute
[45:37] it is there was something in there
[45:39] called out for more of God you might
[45:42] have been living in a Justified State
[45:43] before God but you want the baptism of
[45:45] the Holy Spirit and you hungered for it
[45:48] the very reason that there is a holy
[45:50] spirit is because you're hungering for
[45:52] it the very reason that Peter stood up
[45:54] and said add to your faith first you
[45:57] acknowledge temples patience he wanted
[45:58] to us to be as brother around said a
[46:01] Powerhouse
[46:02] a Powerhouse in this world in this dark
[46:05] world I read it to you he put us in the
[46:08] darkest place that he could put us
[46:11] you me
[46:13] cause he knew somebody would overcome
[46:15] somebody would make it
[46:18] I'm just dumb enough to believe it's me
[46:20] and y'all
[46:28] it's going down a little bit further
[46:32] and as I said this morning
[46:35] there's nothing of such prevailing power
[46:36] as a revelation of the word like I said
[46:38] this morning there's been enough
[46:40] Revelation preached in this building for
[46:42] us to take a rapture
[46:44] what are we doing with it though oh we
[46:46] lay out of church we sleep during church
[46:48] we we have issues we all don't have
[46:50] issues we all gonna have problems
[46:52] but when are we going to realize that
[46:53] this is better than anything out there
[46:57] this is going to sustain you where that
[46:59] out there won't
[47:01] if you think your job is God's going to
[47:03] take it away from you you know what
[47:04] that's if you're a child of God and know
[47:06] what brother Ram said
[47:08] and I'll tell you in my own words you
[47:10] think so much of your job and your car
[47:12] and your whatever it is God's going to
[47:14] take it away from you if you're a child
[47:16] of God because he's not going to put
[47:17] anything in your way
[47:19] for you to become a child of God all
[47:21] right but if not we'll just die for a
[47:23] rap so there's nothing of such
[47:26] prevailing power
[47:28] as the revelation
[47:31] Ephesians 1 17 the god of our Lord Jesus
[47:34] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[47:36] you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation
[47:38] in the knowledge of him that just kind
[47:40] of puts all that together look the eyes
[47:42] of your understanding not the eyes of
[47:44] your body
[47:45] right
[47:47] my eyes are going bad
[47:49] some of y'all wear glasses that you
[47:51] didn't wear them before some of you are
[47:53] going up here going
[47:55] not that my eyes but the eyes of your
[47:58] understanding Open the Eyes of My Heart
[48:01] Lord not the eyes of my physical the
[48:04] eyes of my physical will get me in
[48:06] trouble
[48:08] but not the eyes of your understanding
[48:12] being enlightened look that you may know
[48:14] I want to ask you a question ask
[48:16] yourself during the week do I know who I
[48:18] am
[48:19] do I know what I'm doing here
[48:22] do I know why I'm a preacher do I know
[48:25] why I'm a deacon do I know why I'm a lay
[48:27] person do I know why
[48:30] why do I come to church
[48:32] why do I take communion
[48:35] where do I live above what everybody
[48:37] else lives
[48:41] I'll tell you something
[48:44] everybody thinks this is rules and
[48:46] regulations and I harp on coming to
[48:48] church well I'm not telling I'm just
[48:50] telling you what the Bible says and I'm
[48:52] telling you what brother Brown says see
[48:53] that's what I mean y'all got your your
[48:54] favorite quotes who glory to Darling
[48:57] brother Graham said he also said you
[48:59] can't wait till them doors get open
[49:02] see we don't want them
[49:04] that cuts but it don't cut me you know
[49:07] about what about 20 years ago I guess
[49:09] when I quit drinking yeah I did sorry
[49:13] 22 years ago
[49:17] when we were out in the world bro George
[49:22] the law
[49:24] of
[49:25] um if you blew if you're you know you
[49:27] had one of those breathalyzer things
[49:29] if you blew it started out a long time
[49:31] ago they wouldn't even have one of them
[49:33] take you home
[49:37] well then they said no there's too many
[49:39] people dying of drinking alcohol
[49:41] and car wrecks so we gonna put a lemon
[49:45] on it and it's 1.0 if you blowing this
[49:48] little thing and it's 1.0 you're going
[49:50] to jail
[49:51] all the people scream
[49:55] then it come up to about 10 years later
[49:57] from that they said not needs to be 0.08
[50:01] oh the people were screaming about that
[50:04] they got the point in this .06 or
[50:06] something I don't even don't even know
[50:08] but if it went to 0.06 are we gonna have
[50:10] a sermon about this
[50:12] are we gonna send it home and go oh my
[50:15] God
[50:16] I don't know how I can live it don't
[50:19] matter if it's point oh
[50:21] if you don't drink that log does not
[50:24] apply to you that's the same way with
[50:27] sin if you don't do it the law doesn't
[50:30] apply to you
[50:31] man there's not a day I don't want to
[50:33] come to church now listen there's time
[50:35] when we have jobs I know that there's
[50:37] time when we have things that we have to
[50:39] do
[50:41] take a vacation that's fine
[50:43] but not 50 of 52.
[50:48] maybe two or 52
[50:51] but not 50 of 52.
[50:54] see what I mean so I don't want to be so
[50:56] dogmatic if you miss a Sunday if you
[50:58] want to go on vacation fast your travel
[50:59] day I've done it before
[51:02] okay
[51:04] but then two Sundays later and then the
[51:06] third Sunday after that and then the
[51:07] fourth Sunday after that
[51:10] you'd be surprised we kept it on the
[51:11] calendar how many times you've got it
[51:13] here and how many times you didn't
[51:16] see I don't have to worry about that I
[51:18] do not have a calendar it says the days
[51:20] I go to church the days I don't because
[51:22] I go to church
[51:24] that make me better than you no
[51:26] no that law that God said not forsaken
[51:30] assembling yourself together that don't
[51:31] apply to me
[51:33] because I do it because I love him
[51:37] you don't think about that sometime
[51:39] I do it because I love him I don't do it
[51:41] because I have what brother Dale listen
[51:43] they
[51:46] I've known him longer than your health
[51:48] yeah
[51:50] but there's been days he has not one to
[51:52] come search
[51:55] there's days he did not want to preach
[51:57] the sermon in this pulpit
[51:59] because of sickness Because Of Heartache
[52:02] because of y'all
[52:04] and US me I'm talking about y'all I'm
[52:06] talking about all of us
[52:08] but did he ever Miss
[52:10] Heavenly days no he didn't miss
[52:15] like the old the old joke about the you
[52:18] know the wife said honey we need to get
[52:19] him go to church he ain't going to
[52:21] church today
[52:22] she said you got to go to church
[52:25] he said I ain't nothing but a bunch of
[52:26] Hypocrites go to that church he said I
[52:28] ain't going
[52:29] she said honey you got to get him to go
[52:30] to church he said I ain't gonna none of
[52:32] them people they they all like none of
[52:33] them they don't like me either
[52:35] she said honey you got to go you're the
[52:38] pastor
[52:42] but you think every day
[52:44] roses
[52:46] puppy clouds
[52:48] no
[52:50] but he that overcometh
[52:53] well I grant yeah now see that's a
[52:56] promise
[52:58] the promise in the Bible not that I'm
[53:00] gonna dump you in here but you're gonna
[53:02] overcome whatever it is out there in the
[53:04] world
[53:05] well here I go again
[53:08] but I want us to be us to be the true
[53:09] church I don't want us to be somebody
[53:11] that just halfway does stuff
[53:16] none of us
[53:19] I don't want to believe that quote
[53:21] brother round said there's mate
[53:22] Believers unbelievers and True Believers
[53:23] in every crowd especially when he gets
[53:25] down there on Wednesday night where they
[53:26] ain't but about 20 of y'all here we got
[53:28] to looking around
[53:32] praise the Lord anyhow
[53:35] there's another one in quotes we don't
[53:36] like especially when the congregation
[53:37] gets lower and lower and lower and it
[53:39] doesn't matter with several hundred
[53:40] people's here was like well if ma'am
[53:44] no it's probably you
[53:46] but crossing the true church now look
[53:49] true church so there's a false church
[53:51] right remember we talk about the two
[53:52] vines or the two Church we're talking
[53:54] about the the knowledge of Good and Evil
[53:56] and the tree of life but brother Brown
[53:58] said their their Vines were intertwined
[54:00] you couldn't really tell the difference
[54:01] because well listen the tree of
[54:02] knowledge of Good and Evil is a
[54:04] religious tree
[54:08] it come from Satan who is
[54:10] way more anointed than not some of us
[54:12] are
[54:14] he was anointed for we was on Earth
[54:18] I didn't say in heaven I said on Earth
[54:23] but there's a true church
[54:25] and I'm going to contend I'm going to
[54:27] fight for that to find that true church
[54:29] you need to fight for that truth you
[54:31] need to find that true church
[54:33] not just about hey
[54:41] he said well then brother I said at home
[54:43] you've not found that true church
[54:46] because you got to put all the
[54:47] scriptures together
[54:49] can't do away with these over here
[54:51] okay just because that law is in is in
[54:55] force of the drinking alcohol it's still
[54:57] there in case you slip up
[55:00] hello somebody all right
[55:03] but for us that don't drink
[55:06] what does it matter
[55:08] you see what I mean that's the way I
[55:10] look at the word of God if you do what
[55:11] the word of God says the best you can I
[55:14] mean the best you can
[55:16] the best you can
[55:19] then that do's and don't stuff doesn't
[55:21] apply to you and me
[55:23] if you do it
[55:27] I bet that deep is a Love That No One
[55:30] Ever Knows
[55:32] listen I love you with all my heart
[55:34] but if she decide to leave this message
[55:36] and go somewhere else
[55:39] staying right here
[55:41] because this is where the Deep comes
[55:43] from
[55:44] we see the people leaving the message
[55:46] like crazy now why there was no deep
[55:49] there was no new birth
[55:51] to respond to the preaching
[55:54] although I wanted to find this over here
[55:55] and there wasn't this over here brother
[55:57] Brown missed it here this would miss it
[55:59] here this miss it here
[56:00] well you can pick all you want to but
[56:02] Christ in the true church is what a
[56:04] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[56:06] Book of Revelation shows highly at the
[56:07] Antichrist Spirit now that's what we're
[56:08] dealing with now and let me tell you let
[56:11] me make a point here reason I've been
[56:13] reading this and I hadn't said what this
[56:15] was but the reason I've been reading
[56:16] this one quote is that Antichrist spirit
[56:19] is right there
[56:22] the opposite of that
[56:26] oh god listen
[56:28] the devil wants you to have virtue he
[56:30] wants you to have a little bit of power
[56:32] that he gives you
[56:35] oh he surely wants you to have knowledge
[56:38] sure it does
[56:40] but you got to be able to discern
[56:42] whether it's his knowledge or God's
[56:43] knowledge
[56:45] you got to discern whether it's the
[56:47] temperance that God give you where God
[56:49] himself could walk into a sanctuary and
[56:53] he could plant a rope and he could make
[56:55] a plan of what he's fixing to do and he
[56:57] drives them jokers out of that
[57:00] Temple
[57:02] but he did one thing me and you can't do
[57:06] he went and died for him
[57:10] even though he drove him out
[57:13] he went and died for him
[57:15] can you do that God bless God anyway
[57:19] the Antichrist is going to what come
[57:21] into the church
[57:27] make it lukewarm
[57:30] formal
[57:31] and Powerless
[57:33] it exposes Satan Reveals His work that's
[57:36] what we're doing now that's why a lot of
[57:37] times you don't need discernment in a
[57:39] church service
[57:39] daddy will tell you and all the other
[57:41] ministers to tell you you don't need
[57:42] discernment because you can see the
[57:43] demon in your face
[57:51] mine too
[57:54] demons bother you
[57:57] right now
[57:59] right now
[58:01] listen if he can look right there if he
[58:04] can discredit God's word what does it
[58:06] need to start at
[58:08] right here
[58:09] he needs to start right here if he's
[58:11] going to discredit the word of God if he
[58:13] discredits this ministry then he's got
[58:16] all of you
[58:17] just one big he's got 100 people or 80
[58:20] people
[58:25] that's why many women in popularity
[58:27] brother Brown said the three things
[58:28] that'll do it they'll do a a preacher in
[58:31] many women in popularity wouldn't stay
[58:33] away from it but the discrediting of
[58:35] God's word right down to the time he's
[58:37] casting the Lake of Fire he fights it
[58:39] he's fighting now
[58:41] he knows that the people get the true
[58:44] revelation of the true church all right
[58:46] you got to know there's a false in the
[58:47] truth
[58:48] and they're sitting in every
[58:50] congregation
[58:52] and what she is and what she stands for
[58:56] you got to make a public announcement I
[58:58] am standing for the word of God
[59:01] and that public statement is made known
[59:03] because you don't drink you don't smoke
[59:05] you don't chew you don't curse your
[59:07] sisters don't cut your hair
[59:10] there's your declaration
[59:12] that God's word's right
[59:16] what she stands for and that she can do
[59:18] the greater work she will be an
[59:19] invincible Army if they get a true
[59:21] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[59:24] framework of the Christian church and by
[59:26] God's spirit discern that's why
[59:28] knowledge is discernment you got to know
[59:31] that's why Brothers tell you they'll
[59:34] tell me many many times they love
[59:35] preaching here some don't some do most
[59:38] do because there's not a pushback
[59:42] when they make a statement listen if you
[59:44] go to another church well some of you
[59:46] are not preachers but if we go to
[59:47] another church and we preach we hit a
[59:50] point and when we hit that point you
[59:52] just put in Brackets they're all shaking
[59:54] their head you put that point right here
[59:58] it's just soon you read the headlines of
[1:00:00] the newspaper in the Atlanta Journal
[1:00:02] Constitution
[1:00:04] because you gotta back up and explain
[1:00:06] what you just said
[1:00:08] because you feel that
[1:00:10] pushback
[1:00:12] or you preach something like this Daniel
[1:00:15] 7 weeks something a little controversial
[1:00:16] something a little deep you really get a
[1:00:19] you get a real you know you get a push
[1:00:21] back you kind of hit a wall
[1:00:23] well that's the spirit of God Discerning
[1:00:26] I'm sorry Discerning that they don't
[1:00:29] know what they think they know
[1:00:31] and not to share some you know don't let
[1:00:33] her head swell
[1:00:35] but like I said before we've been taught
[1:00:36] in this church
[1:00:37] taught
[1:00:39] and when you try to take teaching to
[1:00:41] another place and they're not used to it
[1:00:43] it really shuts them down
[1:00:45] hey man
[1:00:47] Bob Luis dad
[1:00:51] yeah
[1:00:52] all of you we know that for a fact and
[1:00:55] I'm not making anything out of it as far
[1:00:57] as us but it's a discernment that we go
[1:00:59] through
[1:01:00] it's the knowledge of God that we know
[1:01:02] what we're talking about I'm sorry we do
[1:01:06] because we've been taught well and we
[1:01:08] can discern you can discern
[1:01:10] and withstand the Antichrist spirit
[1:01:12] because what is an antichrist spirit
[1:01:14] it's not out there
[1:01:17] anything against the word of God is anti
[1:01:22] thing against a word of God is anti
[1:01:26] so it's Antichrist
[1:01:28] anti-anointed spirit
[1:01:30] but look if we can see that and overcome
[1:01:32] it Satan will be powerless do you
[1:01:35] believe what Brother Martin says
[1:01:37] she'll be he'll be powerless before her
[1:01:40] listen in the Garden of Eden Satan walks
[1:01:42] up in the form of the Beast and by his
[1:01:44] subtility he overpowers the bride
[1:01:49] of Adam
[1:01:50] he overpowers her with his influence
[1:01:53] with his spirit with his with his uh
[1:01:56] lust and his and all the things and
[1:01:59] she falls for it
[1:02:01] she falls for it
[1:02:05] and Adam couldn't save her because he's
[1:02:07] not a savior
[1:02:10] so he took her and said I'll take her
[1:02:11] sin
[1:02:12] we're going to live this way God said
[1:02:14] I'll put enmity I'm gonna put a division
[1:02:16] here but I'm going to come back and I'll
[1:02:18] make sure that this next bride
[1:02:21] is not gonna fall we read it this
[1:02:23] morning I'll read it again
[1:02:25] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[1:02:28] with true Revelation in our lives
[1:02:31] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:02:33] it not Revelation just what we get in
[1:02:35] this building
[1:02:38] if it's really revealed to you it's like
[1:02:40] brother Dale's always said how can you
[1:02:42] talk somebody out of a revelation
[1:02:44] if it's a real one it
[1:02:47] it becomes a part of you
[1:02:49] just like your hand your finger you
[1:02:51] can't deny it once you get a revelation
[1:02:54] how somebody gonna talk you out of water
[1:02:56] baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:00] I can't
[1:03:03] can't but they'll try
[1:03:05] they'll try but look the Gates of Hell
[1:03:06] will not Prevail against us the bride
[1:03:10] but we will prevail
[1:03:12] over them
[1:03:14] here's right here why why would God call
[1:03:17] a people out of this evil age for his
[1:03:19] name the reason it is is the Trier
[1:03:24] his bride
[1:03:25] when she has made manifest been tried
[1:03:27] been proven proved to who not to the
[1:03:31] world
[1:03:32] to the Devil Himself
[1:03:35] like it was at the beginning so shall it
[1:03:38] be at the end as the seed starts in the
[1:03:40] ground it comes up through carrier's
[1:03:41] life but it ends up the same seed as it
[1:03:44] was when it went in the ground
[1:03:46] and the same way the seed now who's he
[1:03:47] talking about Jesus Christ said I've got
[1:03:49] to go in the ground
[1:03:51] I Gotta Die Alone that I can bring up
[1:03:53] more fruit then what do we do we don't
[1:03:55] bring up we bring up stock yes we bring
[1:03:57] up tassel we bring up shuck but there's
[1:04:00] seed coming back because the seed is the
[1:04:03] multiplier
[1:04:04] and by with me the seed is the
[1:04:06] multiplier the shot's not the multiplier
[1:04:08] you can't plant a stalk and get another
[1:04:11] ear corn
[1:04:13] you got to plant corn seed to get an ear
[1:04:15] corn
[1:04:16] but it's got to go through those stages
[1:04:18] but it's got to be seed form
[1:04:21] that's my brother random the spoken word
[1:04:23] is the Original Seed
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:28] seed shall not be aired with the shuck
[1:04:31] oh my
[1:04:33] seed of discrepancy
[1:04:36] I know a lot of people talk about seed
[1:04:37] being this and that and the other but I
[1:04:39] believe that's true seed
[1:04:41] and it's been planted
[1:04:43] all right you didn't get it when you're
[1:04:44] the baby
[1:04:46] your wife wasn't pregnant when she was
[1:04:47] born
[1:04:48] she had to receive seed
[1:04:52] the same way the seat of Deceit fell on
[1:04:55] the ground and Eden is the same way it
[1:04:57] ends up in the last days
[1:04:58] just as the gospel was when it fell to a
[1:05:01] denomination at nicaea it ends up in a
[1:05:04] super organization just as the seat of
[1:05:06] the church fell back there with signs
[1:05:08] wonders and living Christ among them it
[1:05:10] ends up in the last days under the
[1:05:12] ministry of Malachi 4 and restores back
[1:05:15] again what's the brother I'm talking
[1:05:16] about that those first three Church ages
[1:05:18] they had all the gifts working in their
[1:05:19] life they didn't have any denominations
[1:05:21] they didn't have any
[1:05:22] um trinitarian they didn't have a first
[1:05:24] Trinity Church on every corner
[1:05:27] they didn't have a Baptist on every
[1:05:28] corner Presbyterian
[1:05:31] no it was a true word of God
[1:05:34] but they lost it
[1:05:36] they fell back there had signs and
[1:05:39] wonders so the ministry of Malachi 4 had
[1:05:42] to restore that back the original face
[1:05:44] that was faith that was once given we
[1:05:47] find now this evil age is to prove to
[1:05:49] Satan she's not like Eve
[1:05:52] that she's not that type of a woman
[1:05:56] and she will be Tried by his word
[1:05:59] the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by
[1:06:02] the word remember she missed it on one
[1:06:04] phrase he's the same yesterday today and
[1:06:07] forever
[1:06:08] but she failed on One Promise under the
[1:06:10] temptation of the enemy face to face and
[1:06:13] now the people that's called for his
[1:06:15] name of course is his bride she is to
[1:06:17] come in contact oh praise God
[1:06:20] how many is glad to come in contact with
[1:06:22] the word of God
[1:06:23] I mean I am
[1:06:25] contact
[1:06:32] every word and as we were talking this
[1:06:35] morning I want God to be proud of us
[1:06:37] I want our father to be proud of us
[1:06:39] how's he going to be proud of you if you
[1:06:41] don't do what he says
[1:06:43] ain't gonna happen
[1:06:45] so we got to go through virtue knowledge
[1:06:49] and get into temperance
[1:06:52] besides just giving all diligence add to
[1:06:54] your faith virtue into verse your
[1:06:55] knowledge and all his Temperance
[1:06:56] Temperance patience
[1:06:58] and patience godliness the Greek Lexicon
[1:07:01] for temperance is what
[1:07:03] self-control
[1:07:05] the virtue of one who Masters his
[1:07:07] desires and passions especially his
[1:07:09] sensual appetite
[1:07:11] strong or robust having power over
[1:07:15] possessed of now look what was virtue
[1:07:18] virtue was having power
[1:07:20] now you gotta learn to control it
[1:07:24] see every one of these virtues are
[1:07:26] exactly where they're supposed to be
[1:07:28] you got to have virtue before you can
[1:07:31] give it so you got to have power but
[1:07:33] Power without character satanic the
[1:07:35] prophet said so now we come up to
[1:07:37] knowledge the knowledge to know where to
[1:07:39] find out how to get rid of whatever we
[1:07:40] need to get rid of and then temperance
[1:07:44] to have power over
[1:07:47] not using that power in the wrong way
[1:07:52] I mean how many of you no I'm not going
[1:07:55] to ask
[1:07:58] if you could get rid of somebody in your
[1:07:59] life
[1:08:00] you would
[1:08:03] I ain't talking about killing them a
[1:08:04] murder I'm talking about just get rid of
[1:08:05] them
[1:08:06] just never have to deal with them again
[1:08:08] well you ain't got the temperance yet
[1:08:10] you need some work
[1:08:14] because what does temperance do
[1:08:16] it Masters brother man I'm gonna read
[1:08:18] you in a few minutes it Masters all
[1:08:20] circumstances
[1:08:23] curbing restraining controlling oneself
[1:08:25] temperate continent
[1:08:28] then the Bible tell us would be
[1:08:29] incontinent you know what continent
[1:08:31] incontinent is don't you be able to hold
[1:08:32] yourself continent incontinent you can't
[1:08:34] hold yourself as we get older we should
[1:08:36] know that
[1:08:37] yeah Temperance doesn't mean stop
[1:08:39] drinking alcohol either no no tempers
[1:08:41] doesn't mean alcohol is cured not in
[1:08:43] this case this is Bible Temperance Holy
[1:08:45] Spirit Temperance so he's connecting the
[1:08:47] two together Holy Spirit Temperance not
[1:08:49] Temperance out there in the world to
[1:08:50] quit drinking listen if you're not
[1:08:52] drinking you don't need that kind of
[1:08:53] temperance
[1:08:54] right
[1:08:57] I do not have to control myself
[1:09:00] with a drinking problem you know having
[1:09:01] a drinking problem I'm over that I'm
[1:09:04] done with that yeah all right so what's
[1:09:06] that tempers talking about controlling
[1:09:08] me in every other way
[1:09:12] that's just one of the lusts of the
[1:09:13] flesh but we're talking about Holy
[1:09:15] Spirit Temperance that means how to
[1:09:16] control your
[1:09:18] I'm gonna stop and drink some water
[1:09:20] right here
[1:09:26] now let's read that again how to control
[1:09:28] your tongue
[1:09:29] not be a toddler
[1:09:31] everybody's got to know everything just
[1:09:33] put it on Facebook
[1:09:35] how to control your temper not fly off
[1:09:38] every time somebody's peace cross to you
[1:09:42] help me Lord
[1:09:43] boy a lot of us going to fall off before
[1:09:45] we get started now brother Brandon must
[1:09:47] know something about that
[1:09:49] aren't we then we wonder why God is not
[1:09:52] in his church
[1:09:55] oh no it's a coach Joyce won't get right
[1:09:58] how many times brother tells many men
[1:10:00] it's just cause now if brother Dale
[1:10:02] would get back right if everything's
[1:10:03] right
[1:10:04] we'll be out of here
[1:10:06] now let's work on us first right
[1:10:13] ain't as right as I want to be but I'm
[1:10:15] more right Than I Used to Be
[1:10:17] same way with each one of us I believe
[1:10:19] we've grown this past year I believe a
[1:10:20] lot of people have really really grown
[1:10:22] and showed that they want to like I said
[1:10:24] before that Deep's got a call to want to
[1:10:25] go up that statue of perfect man that
[1:10:27] deep wants to make that we get better
[1:10:29] not better people better Christians
[1:10:33] boy a lot of us going to fall off before
[1:10:35] we get started aren't we then we wonder
[1:10:36] why God is not in his church so how
[1:10:38] important is these virtues
[1:10:41] then we wonder why God is not in his
[1:10:44] church doing Miracles and things that
[1:10:46] they used to do
[1:10:48] that's why
[1:10:50] we lost those virtues from the first
[1:10:53] church to right now that's why I took a
[1:10:56] prophet to preach in 1962 in October the
[1:11:00] stature of a perfect man
[1:11:03] why didn't he preach it in 1957 why
[1:11:06] didn't he preach in 1947 why didn't he
[1:11:09] preach in 1960 wasn't ready for it
[1:11:13] didn't have all the virtues in line
[1:11:15] Maybe
[1:11:18] I know he didn't when he was a kid
[1:11:20] remember he would have been a murderer
[1:11:21] and he would have been he'd have
[1:11:23] committed suicide twice we can go on and
[1:11:25] on everybody with me
[1:11:27] okay
[1:11:29] and I'm telling you not stories I'm
[1:11:31] telling you stories he told
[1:11:32] it's on tape and it's his voice
[1:11:36] he told us he was going to commit
[1:11:38] suicide he told us he was going to grab
[1:11:41] that wire
[1:11:42] right
[1:11:43] he told us he loaded that gun to shoot
[1:11:46] them boys with
[1:11:48] he told us he was going to take that
[1:11:51] whoever killed his dog and he's going to
[1:11:52] kill them
[1:11:54] wow
[1:11:57] and we followed this man
[1:11:59] yeah
[1:12:00] because he's human
[1:12:02] and he had a gift
[1:12:06] add Temperance to it old Temperance how
[1:12:09] to answer look in kindness when Wrath it
[1:12:12] spoke to you
[1:12:13] somebody says you bunch of Holy Rollers
[1:12:15] down there don't jump up and run and
[1:12:17] pull your sleeve roll your sleeve up see
[1:12:19] not that
[1:12:21] remember brother I'm the same thing
[1:12:22] remember the teacher told him to put the
[1:12:24] little string around his tie ten knots
[1:12:26] or count to 10 or whatever it was said
[1:12:28] he got to about three throwed it down
[1:12:30] rolled his sleeves up and went whipping
[1:12:32] them boys so they went to whipping him
[1:12:33] one of the two
[1:12:34] oh the prophet yep
[1:12:40] but later on
[1:12:43] he told that guy was fixing to
[1:12:45] break his face in
[1:12:48] he said no that ain't happening tonight
[1:12:51] what'd he say he said something
[1:12:55] deep
[1:12:58] came up
[1:13:00] and he said I felt sorry for that person
[1:13:02] I didn't want to kill him
[1:13:05] two people up in the up in the balcony a
[1:13:07] man and a woman a boy and a girl making
[1:13:09] love in the in the congregation during
[1:13:11] the service
[1:13:12] brother I'm told him stop stop that stop
[1:13:14] that well what would me and you have
[1:13:16] done
[1:13:19] yeah
[1:13:21] the holy spirit said whatever you say
[1:13:24] that's what will happen
[1:13:27] and with eyes that may have looked like
[1:13:30] a little bit maybe he was mad at one
[1:13:31] time
[1:13:32] because they were desecrating the house
[1:13:34] of God
[1:13:36] he said I forgive you
[1:13:38] he said they could have carried them out
[1:13:40] in the stretch or dead if I'd have said
[1:13:41] it he said but
[1:13:44] I prayed for their Saul
[1:13:45] I looked at the soul of those people and
[1:13:47] knew they needed to be saved the same
[1:13:50] way brother Devils looked at all of us
[1:13:51] we go through all this junk that we go
[1:13:52] through he's looking at your soul he's
[1:13:54] not looking at you
[1:13:55] all right praise God
[1:13:58] don't jump out and roll up your sleeve
[1:14:00] no not that that talk with Godly love
[1:14:03] Temperance kindness is that the way you
[1:14:06] want to be congregation says amen when
[1:14:09] you're riled up
[1:14:11] that didn't say you'll never get riled
[1:14:13] up
[1:14:15] see how that's written when you're riled
[1:14:19] up
[1:14:21] raw not back
[1:14:23] let him be your example
[1:14:26] I don't think brother Brown knew
[1:14:28] anything about road rage
[1:14:30] but the devil of that road rage was
[1:14:31] there at that time
[1:14:33] it's just manifest itself now because
[1:14:35] every time we people hey somebody passed
[1:14:37] me the other day and I mean he was
[1:14:38] flying pass on a double yellow line and
[1:14:41] praise God for stop signs
[1:14:43] the great equalizer
[1:14:46] it's a traffic light
[1:14:49] because he's like got caught in the
[1:14:51] light going up here in Rapid town he got
[1:14:52] caught in that light he couldn't get
[1:14:54] under it he got caught in that light and
[1:14:55] I pulled it right behind him I just
[1:14:57] smiled away
[1:14:59] I said you just wasted 20 worth of gas
[1:15:02] just to get 22 feet in front of me
[1:15:06] so anyway
[1:15:10] if thou be the Son of God turn these
[1:15:11] stones into bread he could have done it
[1:15:14] see there's there's a power inside of us
[1:15:16] that can do these things anybody with me
[1:15:18] there's a power inside of you to create
[1:15:20] a world and go live on it but why would
[1:15:22] we want to do that now
[1:15:24] we're here to save get Soul safe we're
[1:15:26] here to we're here to manifest the word
[1:15:28] of God
[1:15:30] oh it'd be real easy listen brother
[1:15:32] Brandon was full of these of these uh
[1:15:34] quirks and all he he said Lord I just
[1:15:36] want to go up on the up in the highest
[1:15:38] mountain remember
[1:15:40] storm down like Elijah and just
[1:15:44] and go right back up and he said no
[1:15:46] you're a people
[1:15:48] person you're a people Prophet the
[1:15:50] people you have to live with your people
[1:15:53] and I love what uh
[1:15:55] one brother was saying the other day
[1:15:58] a shepherd's got to smell like a sheep
[1:16:05] the good and the bad
[1:16:09] think about that
[1:16:11] if a new Shepherd comes in the Sheep are
[1:16:13] like
[1:16:15] that ain't Our Shepherd
[1:16:18] no
[1:16:19] because he hadn't lived with him
[1:16:21] you got to live with your people
[1:16:25] so you know what
[1:16:26] Jesus Christ took on our smell
[1:16:29] the odor of death the odor of sin
[1:16:33] he took that on us on him from us
[1:16:37] and now he's the great Shepherd
[1:16:39] that though you may stink like sin every
[1:16:41] once in a while even after you're born
[1:16:42] again he's still the shepherd standing
[1:16:46] right there with you with us with one of
[1:16:48] those Shepherd hooks of love
[1:16:50] not a fish hook
[1:16:52] a Shepherd hook
[1:16:54] when they called him Belgium he said
[1:16:56] I'll forgive you for that they pulled a
[1:16:58] handful of beard out of his face and
[1:16:59] spit in his faces come down off the
[1:17:01] cross he said father forgive him
[1:17:03] they don't even know what they're doing
[1:17:06] when he had the gift
[1:17:08] he note all things for in him was the
[1:17:11] fullness of the godhead bodily they had
[1:17:13] seen him perform Miracles by telling
[1:17:14] people what was wrong with him and so
[1:17:15] forth they put a rag around his head and
[1:17:18] around his eyes and hit him on the head
[1:17:19] and said prophesy tell us who hit you
[1:17:21] we'll believe you see he had temperance
[1:17:25] now if you got it like that
[1:17:27] add that to your faith if you still blow
[1:17:30] up and Sass and fuss and stew and carry
[1:17:33] on
[1:17:34] uh-huh
[1:17:35] you ain't got no you can't add that
[1:17:38] because it won't add it won't vulcanize
[1:17:41] you couldn't take a piece of rubber you
[1:17:43] know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron
[1:17:45] it just won't work no it's got to be
[1:17:48] flexible
[1:17:49] didn't didn't God tell us he put a heart
[1:17:51] of Flesh inside of us and take the Heart
[1:17:53] of Stone out because Stone hard
[1:17:57] flesh is pliable
[1:18:00] rubber's pliable
[1:18:02] you know vulcanize it to a piece of iron
[1:18:04] you can't do that it just won't work now
[1:18:05] it's got to be flexible just like the
[1:18:07] rubber is and when your faith and your
[1:18:09] Temperance looks becomes the same kind
[1:18:11] of Holy Ghost Temperance that he has
[1:18:14] then it will vulcanize with him you're
[1:18:17] added to it
[1:18:19] let's keep reading just for a second and
[1:18:21] we'll we'll um
[1:18:23] take communion
[1:18:24] when your knowledge is like his
[1:18:26] knowledge
[1:18:27] I come to do thy will oh God
[1:18:30] see what the father's word he defeated
[1:18:33] every devil
[1:18:37] with the father's word
[1:18:41] he defeated every devil
[1:18:45] heavens and earth will pass away but the
[1:18:47] word will not see when you got that kind
[1:18:51] of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your
[1:18:54] faith when you get the right kind of
[1:18:56] temperance like he had it'll vulcanize
[1:18:59] if you hadn't just a man-made halfway
[1:19:02] soused up most of y'all know what that
[1:19:04] means you're in this from the south you
[1:19:06] should know it South step belief or
[1:19:08] Temperance all ought to slap him down
[1:19:11] but maybe better not because they might
[1:19:13] put my name in the paper
[1:19:16] or Facebook
[1:19:18] or Instagram
[1:19:20] or Twitter
[1:19:22] those of you that don't know that Luis
[1:19:24] does ask him
[1:19:28] Netflix no they won't put you on Netflix
[1:19:30] I guess and do that you're not that
[1:19:32] famous
[1:19:33] because they might put your name in the
[1:19:34] paper about it that ain't the kind of
[1:19:36] tempers he's talking about
[1:19:39] because you know one time
[1:19:41] back in the Old Testament
[1:19:43] there was a prophet of God
[1:19:45] he was walking down the road
[1:19:48] and a bunch of children came up to him
[1:19:50] and started harassing him
[1:19:54] start calling him names see we hate it
[1:19:56] you can do a lot of things but don't
[1:19:57] call me a name
[1:19:59] because I take that personal
[1:20:01] you're talking to me
[1:20:03] don't do that to me
[1:20:05] you talking about me you talking about
[1:20:06] me
[1:20:07] yeah I'm talking about you
[1:20:10] but what happened
[1:20:12] there was no love in that prophet's eyes
[1:20:14] as far as agape love
[1:20:18] he turned and looked at him and he said
[1:20:20] in other words curse you
[1:20:23] and two bears two she Bears two big
[1:20:26] grizzly bears
[1:20:28] ate those are killed those 40 kids
[1:20:31] he didn't have temperance
[1:20:34] he didn't have Holy Ghost Temperance
[1:20:36] because he didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:20:38] but me and you got what would we do if
[1:20:40] somebody kept harassing us and telling
[1:20:42] us yeah same way with with all of us
[1:20:46] if we keep hammering on something like
[1:20:48] coming to church and different things
[1:20:50] if y'all could call two she Bears Out of
[1:20:52] the Woods you would
[1:20:55] I don't want most people do they want
[1:20:57] you to shut up if you start digging into
[1:21:00] their demons
[1:21:05] you say all that's never happened how
[1:21:06] many times you got people if Donnie was
[1:21:09] here his dad brother Tom bless his heart
[1:21:11] he tried his best
[1:21:14] but sometimes he was he was the two she
[1:21:17] bears
[1:21:20] and he was a little over we all know we
[1:21:22] all if everybody knows him they
[1:21:24] chuckling they laugh that's just the way
[1:21:25] brother Tom was
[1:21:27] but he didn't have a lot of temperance
[1:21:29] for people that didn't like the word of
[1:21:31] God
[1:21:34] okay he just he didn't he'll tell you if
[1:21:37] he's sitting here today he'll tell you
[1:21:38] but you know what he's on the other side
[1:21:40] he ain't got to worry about that no more
[1:21:42] because remember that has an end
[1:21:47] that's had an expiration date
[1:21:50] the day he passed from this life into
[1:21:51] the other life
[1:21:53] he ain't got to worry about that no more
[1:21:56] he ain't got to worry about hurting
[1:21:57] people's feelings but brother Tom buddy
[1:21:58] I'm telling you if he if he start
[1:22:00] digging into you
[1:22:02] it was like them claws were going
[1:22:06] and it was done with love
[1:22:08] okay but you didn't want to be around
[1:22:10] him
[1:22:12] Anna
[1:22:13] sister me either me either
[1:22:16] he'd come at you I mean with if he had
[1:22:19] if it's such thing as a full Barrel done
[1:22:21] he
[1:22:22] he wanted at you
[1:22:24] I mean it's like and it wasn't pointed
[1:22:25] at you you had him right here
[1:22:28] but he was doing it out of love he was
[1:22:30] trying his best to get you to see the
[1:22:32] word of God
[1:22:33] like he could see it
[1:22:35] his Zeal was overwhelming
[1:22:37] and you know what happened I don't want
[1:22:39] to be around him
[1:22:41] I see him over there how many people
[1:22:43] never mind I ain't gonna jump in your
[1:22:45] life
[1:22:47] you ever seen somebody you didn't I
[1:22:49] won't be around
[1:22:50] yeah
[1:22:55] that's why that's why when you look at
[1:22:58] somebody that's got Temperance like
[1:23:00] brother Branham did he didn't avoid
[1:23:01] nobody
[1:23:04] he knew they hated him
[1:23:06] he knew they wanted to destroy him
[1:23:09] uh um religiously or or in that Realm
[1:23:13] or discredit him they're doing it now
[1:23:16] but he knew they were discrediting him
[1:23:18] and he didn't know you didn't know as an
[1:23:21] outsider you never knew who he liked and
[1:23:23] didn't like you know what you know what
[1:23:25] Billy Paul said he said that was one
[1:23:26] great thing my daddy had you couldn't
[1:23:29] tell who was his enemies and who was his
[1:23:31] friends he just brought them all drew
[1:23:33] the circle bigger and just grabbed big
[1:23:34] old bear hugs and started pulling them
[1:23:36] in we don't do that
[1:23:39] we got our favorites and you let it know
[1:23:40] I like that person I like that person I
[1:23:42] like that person I liked that I don't
[1:23:43] like that person I like that person I
[1:23:45] like that one now I like him now I like
[1:23:47] her I don't like that one over there do
[1:23:49] you like that no one like that one
[1:23:53] but when you can really with the
[1:23:55] sweetness from your heart
[1:23:57] forgive every man
[1:23:59] we still believe brother Brown was a
[1:24:00] prophet right I'm reading the quote
[1:24:02] hold your peace
[1:24:08] let it be gone
[1:24:10] see then it'll vulcanize you can add
[1:24:13] that
[1:24:14] to your faith
[1:24:16] and then I remember I read you this and
[1:24:18] we'll read it again for those of you
[1:24:19] that weren't here the impact of
[1:24:20] vulcanization on rubber
[1:24:22] science directives must be true someone
[1:24:24] from the internet explains that
[1:24:25] vulcanization changes the physical
[1:24:27] properties of rubber by forcing it to
[1:24:29] retract
[1:24:32] today we are rubber right of course
[1:24:36] there are mechanical methods that can
[1:24:38] force rubber to retract as well the
[1:24:40] difference with vulcanization however is
[1:24:43] that it retains the original shape of
[1:24:45] the rubber
[1:24:50] when vulcanization is performed on
[1:24:52] rubber the rubber shrinks while
[1:24:53] retaining its original
[1:24:55] shape
[1:24:57] may I shrink
[1:25:00] and let God
[1:25:02] raise up
[1:25:04] vulcanization essentially scales down
[1:25:07] rubber to a smaller size make me small
[1:25:09] Lord
[1:25:10] all without deforming or altering its
[1:25:14] shape in addition to altering your size
[1:25:16] while retaining its shape vulcanization
[1:25:18] also protects rubber from future
[1:25:21] deformation praise God
[1:25:24] praise God
[1:25:26] I don't want to be deformed in the
[1:25:28] future
[1:25:31] if it's done right it won't
[1:25:34] as it shrinks rubber hardens and becomes
[1:25:36] less vulnerable to deformation
[1:25:39] it may still deform when exposed to
[1:25:42] enough stress
[1:25:44] can everybody raise their hand on that
[1:25:46] one yep we had stress we got it okay but
[1:25:49] remember when you put stress on rubber
[1:25:50] what does it do it just when you let go
[1:25:52] of it it just snaps right back into
[1:25:54] place again you ought to try that
[1:25:55] sometime let some of your stress go
[1:25:58] and let it snap back in place
[1:26:00] but vulcanized rubber won't deform as
[1:26:02] easily as conventional non-vulcanized
[1:26:05] rubber rubber also becomes harder when
[1:26:07] vulcanized which substantially
[1:26:09] subsequently increases its tensile
[1:26:12] strength
[1:26:16] as we receive these virtues God's
[1:26:19] Vulcanizing them to us if we do it right
[1:26:21] and we become what weaker
[1:26:24] we become stronger
[1:26:26] amen guess what it says we become
[1:26:28] stronger by the vulcanization process
[1:26:31] it's tensile strength and
[1:26:34] risk of physical damage
[1:26:37] my light with thermoplastic chemical
[1:26:40] process
[1:26:41] the effective vulcanization are
[1:26:43] permanent praise God
[1:26:45] after a rubber object our material has
[1:26:47] been vulcanized it can't be reversed
[1:26:53] once you get Temperance and that
[1:26:54] vulcanized resist to your soul
[1:26:57] and it's Godly Temperance you cannot
[1:27:00] lose that
[1:27:02] just like you cannot you lose your new
[1:27:04] birth
[1:27:07] it can't be
[1:27:09] reversed so no devil
[1:27:12] no Spirit evil
[1:27:15] can go in and play with it
[1:27:17] and then pull it apart
[1:27:20] if it's been vulcanized and how what is
[1:27:23] the vulcanization process Heat
[1:27:26] Heat
[1:27:31] it'll heat and meld together
[1:27:33] and be twice as strong
[1:27:36] may God do that to each and every one of
[1:27:38] us
[1:27:39] may he put us in that fiery furnace oh I
[1:27:41] don't want going to fire first Lord put
[1:27:43] me in there
[1:27:44] put me in that fire furnace because you
[1:27:46] know what I know what's going to happen
[1:27:48] that's going to be a Fourth Man stand up
[1:27:51] there's gonna be somebody up here that's
[1:27:53] going to help me into that fan that
[1:27:54] fiery furnace and I'm going to come out
[1:27:56] not smelling like smoke
[1:27:59] but be with that Fourth Man listen to
[1:28:02] Fire Let's stand our feet
[1:28:04] we'll start on patience
[1:28:08] next week
[1:28:12] let's go to the Lord in prayer
[1:28:18] dear heavenly father thank you for this
[1:28:19] day you give us now as we lord stand
[1:28:23] at attention
[1:28:25] and Lord we come here
[1:28:28] with hungry hearts Lord
[1:28:30] to take communion and Lord be able to
[1:28:32] commune with you closer
[1:28:35] Lord I don't want to feel
[1:28:37] like I have to run away from you
[1:28:40] the prophet of God preached a sermon
[1:28:42] running from the presence of the Lord
[1:28:45] and many prophets
[1:28:48] have done that in the past many men many
[1:28:50] great men
[1:28:51] have tried to hide themselves Gideon and
[1:28:54] all the different ones
[1:28:55] have tried to hide from the presence of
[1:28:57] the Lord because there's a there's a
[1:28:59] reverence there there's an anointing
[1:29:02] but Lord God you told us that we need to
[1:29:05] come boldly to that throne
[1:29:08] we need to ask
[1:29:11] and receive what we ask for
[1:29:14] Lord so we come boldly today Lord
[1:29:17] and if there'd be anybody hearing the
[1:29:18] sound of my voice whether it's on
[1:29:20] internet or here
[1:29:21] that needs healing father I pray that
[1:29:24] the healing virtue of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:25] Christ will take over
[1:29:27] and we'll Lord
[1:29:29] show us
[1:29:31] your power
[1:29:33] by that great
[1:29:35] healing anointing
[1:29:38] can't take it out of the church
[1:29:40] it's still there
[1:29:42] Satan you don't have any clue about
[1:29:44] healing you always want us to be
[1:29:48] as brother Joel says why is he wow as
[1:29:50] you woo but Lord
[1:29:52] I pray that you'd bind Satan every time
[1:29:55] that he wants to do that Lord I pray you
[1:29:57] bind him
[1:29:58] and that we can take positive to the
[1:30:01] Lord Jesus and let him take that
[1:30:02] petition to you father
[1:30:05] and Lord come boldly to the throne and
[1:30:07] hand that petition to our high priest
[1:30:08] who can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:30:11] infirmities
[1:30:12] that Lord we not be negative then we're
[1:30:14] not we're not say negative things Lord
[1:30:16] it will say things that are positive
[1:30:19] that Lord if we need something we'll
[1:30:21] stand up and say Lord I need you
[1:30:24] I need you to save my children I seize
[1:30:27] you Lord help me with my finances Lord I
[1:30:29] I need you to help me with my spiritual
[1:30:31] walk
[1:30:33] and Lord we come boldly to that not not
[1:30:35] hiding behind a tree or behind a bush
[1:30:37] but Lord You're our father
[1:30:41] and as the Bible says what father would
[1:30:43] not give a son that's hungry
[1:30:46] a piece of bread
[1:30:49] but give him a rock
[1:30:51] Lord you're not that way Satan is but
[1:30:53] you're not
[1:30:55] Lord we have not because we ask not
[1:30:59] so Lord I pray that you would be with
[1:31:01] this congregation Lord
[1:31:04] made through this week and coming on
[1:31:06] into the next couple weeks Lord his
[1:31:08] brother Jack's getting ready to come
[1:31:09] Lord and brother rest behind him Lord
[1:31:11] that you'd give us a fervor Lord a a
[1:31:13] fresh anointing
[1:31:15] that Lord as the anointing is of a
[1:31:19] Revival is falling even on the
[1:31:21] denominational World there in Kentucky
[1:31:22] Lord thank you for that it's helping the
[1:31:25] people
[1:31:26] but father we're your bride

[1:31:43] we we have issues with Lord I pray that
[1:31:45] you take those out of the way
[1:31:48] Lord that we might not be bound by by
[1:31:51] not be bound by by the as we was talking
[1:31:55] about the the laws of of the alcohol a
[1:31:58] different thing we're free
[1:32:01] we're free from the law of sin and death
[1:32:04] Lord but we bind ourself
[1:32:07] and I pray that you bring us out from
[1:32:09] under that
[1:32:10] Lord let the Deep call to the Deep
[1:32:14] let us hear from you Lord
[1:32:17] let us take you Lord and not the world

[1:32:27] that one we don't like this way and we
[1:32:29] don't like that way

[1:32:33] of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:36] and that you would sue this with that
[1:32:38] ointment
[1:32:40] Lord May the oil
[1:32:42] as run down Aaron's head to his neck his
[1:32:46] face shoulders all the way down his body
[1:32:49] he was just totally Anointed with that
[1:32:52] oil of the natural Lord I pray that
[1:32:55] you're anoint us with the oil of the
[1:32:57] spiritual father

[1:33:09] Lord just bless us now as we get ready
[1:33:11] to take this communion father

[1:33:47] bless each one that's here
[1:33:49] Lord may as we take this communion that
[1:33:51] will remember that one
[1:33:53] evening
[1:33:56] when you took the Bread and Wine
[1:33:58] and you said this is a new testament
[1:34:01] the testator has to die
[1:34:04] to make a new testament
[1:34:06] and Lord we live under that new
[1:34:07] testament
[1:34:09] in your blood
[1:34:11] and we take your body
[1:34:13] as the stripes were laid
[1:34:16] for us to be healed
[1:34:18] Lord we thank you for that thank you for
[1:34:20] salvation thank you for Redemption
[1:34:23] thank you for placing your own life
[1:34:25] inside of us
[1:34:27] there's many people billions of people
[1:34:29] in this world that need that Lord
[1:34:32] there's people in this congregation that
[1:34:34] needs it Lord
[1:34:35] Lord I pray that you would Minister to
[1:34:38] them Lord not just here in this building
[1:34:40] but everywhere they go they do not leave
[1:34:42] them
[1:34:43] lady just gnaw at them let it let them
[1:34:46] Lord not sleep at night
[1:34:48] until they hear from you Lord
[1:34:51] until they find the real peace
[1:34:54] the real Peacemaker
[1:34:57] the real Joy maker
[1:34:59] the real Jehovah Jireh
[1:35:02] our provider
[1:35:04] and all the other compound names of
[1:35:06] Jehovah Lord we appreciate all those
[1:35:08] titles but we know you as husband
[1:35:11] we're Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:35:14] and I pray that we begin to act like
[1:35:16] that Lord and will not make you ashamed
[1:35:18] that you'll be proud of us
[1:35:20] I believe in John 17 you were proud of a
[1:35:22] group of people
[1:35:25] because you asked
[1:35:27] the father to protect us while we were
[1:35:30] here
[1:35:32] and Lord that protection comes from an
[1:35:34] eternal God that created the whole world
[1:35:37] and I thank you for that Lord
[1:35:39] I thank you for the eyes of our of our
[1:35:42] spiritual realm have been enlightened
[1:35:45] we see Revelation that others cannot see
[1:35:48] it's become a mystery to the world but
[1:35:50] it's as the prophet said the mystery is
[1:35:53] now history
[1:35:55] we don't need
[1:35:57] the revelation
[1:35:59] of the serpent say we have it
[1:36:03] we don't need the revelation of water
[1:36:04] baptism we have it
[1:36:07] and Lord may we use it now
[1:36:09] Lord may we take these things that we
[1:36:11] preach and Lord may it go to each one of
[1:36:13] our hearts
[1:36:15] and that you'll settle us and ground Us
[1:36:17] in the word of God
[1:36:19] it's tough Lords you know that you were
[1:36:21] here
[1:36:22] there were many times you had such an
[1:36:24] anointing on you
[1:36:26] but the people didn't believe in you so
[1:36:28] you had to leave the room
[1:36:29] or you had to tell the people to leave
[1:36:32] so that you could heal and raise Jairus
[1:36:34] daughter
[1:36:37] so Lord let those people not be here
[1:36:40] those Spirits Lord may we not be bound
[1:36:42] may we be able to preach freely may we
[1:36:45] be able to receive freely
[1:36:47] freely receive
[1:36:49] from the word of God
[1:36:51] freely receive all the promises of God
[1:36:54] all the things that you've given us
[1:36:56] already in the Bible there has not to be
[1:36:58] another Bible be written
[1:37:00] it's already here we just got to do what
[1:37:03] it says
[1:37:05] father just bless us now in the
[1:37:07] furtherness of this service as we take
[1:37:08] communion
[1:37:10] bind our hearts together
[1:37:12] in you Lord let there not be any root of
[1:37:14] bitterness
[1:37:15] or gal or anything like that Lord
[1:37:18] that'll separate us from you or even
[1:37:20] from each other
[1:37:22] may we bind together Lord as a church
[1:37:24] around our pastor Lord and pray for him
[1:37:27] as every day
[1:37:29] we pray for healing of his body
[1:37:33] Lord but we also pray for Spiritual
[1:37:35] healing of all of our bodies that will
[1:37:37] become to that statue of perfect man
[1:37:39] somebody that that you're proud of
[1:37:41] somebody that you can be so proud of you
[1:37:43] can say hey devil
[1:37:45] have you considered
[1:37:48] Spoken Word Church
[1:37:50] oh you got a hedge around them you man
[1:37:53] they've been given the word well that's
[1:37:55] okay
[1:37:56] go ahead do what you want to
[1:37:59] but don't take their don't you can't
[1:38:01] take this life
[1:38:03] and when job came out of the end of this
[1:38:05] thing guess what
[1:38:08] he was twice the man he was before
[1:38:11] I pray that we've become twice the man
[1:38:13] because you restored everything to him
[1:38:15] twice is what you said
[1:38:17] Lord I pray that you'll give us Lord a
[1:38:19] blessing from Heaven that we can't
[1:38:20] contain may this year be a supernatural
[1:38:24] year for us Lord
[1:38:26] may it be a time that we learn more from
[1:38:28] you we learn how to be like you we learn
[1:38:30] how to act like you act we learn how to
[1:38:33] do the things that you did
[1:38:36] I believe if we
[1:38:38] are believing that we are Christians
[1:38:40] that that's got to happen
[1:38:42] because that deep calls into my heart
[1:38:44] for every person to be able to stand on
[1:38:47] their own
[1:38:49] and have their own experience with God
[1:38:51] in their own virtue and their own
[1:38:53] knowledge their own Temperance and go
[1:38:56] through trials Lord and and not be that
[1:38:58] they have to run and cry and try to find
[1:39:00] the preacher or the pastor
[1:39:02] the Lord you'll you'll help them to grow
[1:39:05] into individuals with God
[1:39:08] and that they can speak the word just
[1:39:10] like any of us speak the word Lord
[1:39:12] and that Satan will have to back up
[1:39:15] you're defeated devil
[1:39:17] you just don't know it yet
[1:39:20] these people know that
[1:39:22] and Lord we're going to thrive on that
[1:39:24] because it's a revelation that you can't
[1:39:27] get
[1:39:29] father I pray this should be with us now
[1:39:31] as we take communion
[1:39:33] bless us in Jesus name
[1:39:36] amen
[1:39:39] anybody have a a need or anything before
[1:39:42] we before we head into the
[1:39:44] the
[1:39:47] communion and foot washing
[1:39:50] we appreciate each and every one of you
[1:39:52] we appreciate the Lord giving us
[1:39:54] strength
[1:39:55] and given us an opportunity to speak
[1:39:59] or this of God or not
[1:40:02] you got to decide
[1:40:06] well it's worth it
[1:40:08] or not
[1:40:11] some people it's not worth it
[1:40:13] some people would rather drink a beer
[1:40:15] and go to church I was one of them
[1:40:20] okay
[1:40:23] I was one of them so don't tell me that
[1:40:25] Spirit don't get on us all
[1:40:29] but if you're born again
[1:40:30] that spirit's gone
[1:40:34] you want to be
[1:40:38] here in church
[1:40:40] or be around the bride
[1:40:43] I like being around the bride
[1:40:45] I don't like being around the world
[1:40:49] do you
[1:40:51] I'll be glad when this thing is over
[1:40:54] I'll be glad when I was talking about
[1:40:56] when this doll has an expiration date
[1:40:58] this part has an expiration date
[1:41:03] God does not have one
[1:41:06] and this world won't have one either if
[1:41:09] you'll realize what the Bible says that
[1:41:11] it's just going to burn it over it's
[1:41:12] going to still be here just like he
[1:41:14] burnt you over and you're still going to
[1:41:16] be here
[1:41:18] then we're going to come and live right
[1:41:19] here
[1:41:20] you know why because we weren't born on
[1:41:22] the moon
[1:41:24] we weren't born on Mars well somebody
[1:41:27] may say we were but
[1:41:29] where are you from
[1:41:31] I was born on this Earth I was born on
[1:41:33] this Earth from this Earth
[1:41:35] right so we have that connection and God
[1:41:37] so much thought of that he said okay
[1:41:39] I'll put you back down there
[1:41:41] because remember when brother Brown went
[1:41:43] across the curtain of time he was just
[1:41:45] astonished when they said we don't eat
[1:41:47] over here
[1:41:48] we don't have our regular bodies uh uh
[1:41:51] we got to go back to Earth what
[1:41:54] he looks back and sees it he said he
[1:41:56] sees his old decrepit body laying there
[1:41:58] he said I don't want to go back to that
[1:42:00] in other words they said look we don't
[1:42:02] need a drink here in other words they're
[1:42:03] not complete humans
[1:42:05] they knew they had to come back
[1:42:08] and pick up their Earthly bodies that's
[1:42:10] how much God thinks of me and you he
[1:42:12] preserves this Earth Burns it off takes
[1:42:14] care of all the sin Burns it off and
[1:42:17] lets us live here for an eternity and
[1:42:20] just enjoy God
[1:42:23] there's no way we can do it because
[1:42:25] we're preachers of time we're creatures
[1:42:27] of of heartaches and trials and
[1:42:29] tribulations
[1:42:30] but folks it'll be over not too long
[1:42:33] let's read for I received of the Lord
[1:42:36] that which I delivered unto you that the
[1:42:37] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:42:39] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:42:41] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:42:43] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:42:45] you this do in remembrance of me in
[1:42:47] other words a new testament was coming
[1:42:49] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:42:51] it and said take ye this is my body
[1:42:52] which is broken for you this do in
[1:42:55] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:42:57] he took the cup and he's
[1:42:59] something saying this cup is the New
[1:43:02] Testament in my blood this do you as
[1:43:04] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:43:06] me for as often as you eat the bread and
[1:43:08] drink the cup you do show the Lord's
[1:43:10] death till he come
[1:43:12] that's why brother Brown says only
[1:43:14] Christians
[1:43:15] should take communion
[1:43:17] right
[1:43:18] if you have an ought against somebody
[1:43:19] say God I'll take care of it but I'm
[1:43:22] going to take communion I feel good
[1:43:23] taking it now I'm okay but you better go
[1:43:26] take care of what you need take care of
[1:43:28] foreign
[1:43:29] because you're going to eat and drink
[1:43:30] damnation if you don't have a revelation
[1:43:32] about what's going on here all right for
[1:43:34] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:43:36] this cup you do show the Lord's deathly
[1:43:37] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:43:40] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:43:41] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:43:44] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:43:46] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:43:48] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:43:50] that eateth and drinketh unworldly
[1:43:51] eatest and drink a damnation to himself
[1:43:53] not Discerning the Lord's body who is
[1:43:56] the Lord's body me and you
[1:43:59] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:44:01] among you not Jesus
[1:44:04] Jesus has made his statement and Paul is
[1:44:08] now interpolating if you look at your
[1:44:09] Bible what Jesus said is in red the rest
[1:44:12] of it is Paul explaining why Jesus said
[1:44:15] what he did right
[1:44:17] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:44:19] among you and many sleep Paul could
[1:44:21] observe that that people were taking
[1:44:22] communion they weren't supposed to and
[1:44:24] they were dying or they were getting
[1:44:25] sick or there was problems I'm just
[1:44:27] reading the Bible
[1:44:28] because that was his observation it
[1:44:30] wasn't that he got this Revelation it
[1:44:31] was going to happen it was happening
[1:44:32] right then all right he said for he that
[1:44:35] eateth and drinketh unworldly eatest and
[1:44:37] drinketh Damnation to himself not
[1:44:39] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:44:41] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:44:43] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:44:45] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:44:47] when we are judged we are chasing to the
[1:44:49] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:44:51] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:44:53] when you come together to eat tarry one
[1:44:54] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:44:56] him eat at home that you come not
[1:44:58] together in the condemnation and the
[1:45:00] rest will I said in order
[1:45:01] when I come he he gets up to a group of
[1:45:05] of people in Corinth and they're they're
[1:45:07] drinking they're drinking their Mead and
[1:45:10] all that stuff and getting drunk at the
[1:45:11] Lord's table that's why he had to come
[1:45:13] and set that down
[1:45:14] so no no this is a Lord's Supper this is
[1:45:17] not your regular meal you need to keep
[1:45:19] that separate
[1:45:21] this is what we're doing here this is
[1:45:23] Discerning the body and blood of the
[1:45:24] Lord right here it's not that we're just
[1:45:26] sitting down and calling for a meal you
[1:45:29] know let's just go to you know Golden
[1:45:30] Corral and that'll be our Lord's Supper
[1:45:32] that's kind of what they were doing in
[1:45:33] Corinthians but Paul being a prophet he
[1:45:36] comes in now he doesn't you know bless
[1:45:37] God you're all going to hell no he just
[1:45:39] told him what to do and you know what I
[1:45:41] believe they did it
[1:45:44] because uh some of them got a real good
[1:45:46] Revelation when he said that some of you
[1:45:47] will sleep and some of you get sick and
[1:45:49] some of you gonna die
[1:45:51] that really I mean well you know that
[1:45:53] went right here that went right to their
[1:45:55] soul
[1:45:56] but they believe if they believe what
[1:45:57] Paul said so if you believe what the
[1:45:59] prophet said you believe what I'm
[1:46:00] telling you same way Happening Here you
[1:46:02] God discern the body of the and blood of
[1:46:04] the Lord why do we have issues and
[1:46:06] problems because we don't do things
[1:46:07] right
[1:46:09] amen bro Dale come up here and pray for
[1:46:11] them for the communion today
[1:46:15] everybody all right we're good with that
[1:46:17] I am so we're gonna do it anyway
[1:46:22] I miss brother Dale standing here going
[1:46:24] he took bread and blessed it
[1:46:28] yep there you go you know what to do
[1:46:32] what do we think
[1:46:35] opportunity to take this communion yes
[1:46:38] Lord
[1:46:39] yeah make it into your honor and your
[1:46:41] glory make it your way
[1:46:43] Lord we just committed to you
[1:46:46] in Jesus Christ
[1:47:05] it's coming today and we'll understand
[1:47:06] this more and more
[1:47:09] because that's what we're going to do at
[1:47:10] the marriage supper
[1:47:13] we're going to take communion
[1:47:18] and Jesus so told us he told us that
[1:47:20] night right there he said I won't do
[1:47:22] this until I come
[1:47:24] I won't do this until I come back and
[1:47:25] I'm not drinking the food of the vine so
[1:47:27] he's not up in heaven drinking wine
[1:47:30] or eating unleavened bread nope
[1:47:33] you know what he done he transferred
[1:47:34] that to us
[1:47:37] see there's so many times that that
[1:47:39] Jesus Sanctified himself for me and you
[1:47:41] not for yourself go ahead
[1:47:44] father we thank you Lord for an
[1:47:46] opportunity for taking this one and the
[1:47:49] bread Lord
[1:47:50] we know that it has symbolic meaning to
[1:47:53] it amen but there are true meanings we
[1:47:56] just ask you to commit everything to you
[1:47:59] and your your ways we love you we honor
[1:48:03] you in Jesus name
[1:48:05] amen
[1:48:06] yes amen
[1:48:18] Come Morning
[1:48:20] how warm by the river
[1:48:26] I'll rest need the
[1:48:30] evergreen tree
[1:48:33] I'll carry my cross
[1:48:38] through the midnight
[1:48:42] come morning
[1:48:44] there's Glory
[1:48:46] for me
[1:48:49] sometimes I'm despised
[1:48:53] and rejected you're gonna be
[1:48:57] and I question oh Father
[1:49:01] how long
[1:49:07] you get a little bit of patience
[1:49:10] at Mount Calvary and what it gives me
[1:49:14] the strength to go on gives me the
[1:49:17] strength to go on
[1:49:21] come morning it'll be over with
[1:49:25] won't have to worry about it no more
[1:49:27] brother Brown said six to nine o'clock
[1:49:30] in the morning sometime when the Sun
[1:49:33] starts coming up
[1:49:35] we're going to leave this place
[1:49:37] the resurrection is going to happen
[1:49:39] and we're gonna be out of here
[1:49:42] the world will just keep on going never
[1:49:44] know a thing about it maybe your
[1:49:46] neighbor will think maybe you went on a
[1:49:48] vacation or something maybe the neighbor
[1:49:50] thought maybe you got crazy and went up
[1:49:52] in the mountain somewhere you know they
[1:49:53] think you're crazy anyway so you know
[1:49:55] you disappeared in one of them camps
[1:49:58] one of them one of them Fellowship
[1:50:00] meetings or or one of them special
[1:50:02] meetings that we go to a lot
[1:50:06] that's all right it'll be a special
[1:50:07] meeting I promise you that
[1:50:09] it'll be one like you never had here
[1:50:11] before
[1:50:16] that Mount Calvary
[1:50:19] and he gives me the strength to
[1:50:24] go on
[1:50:27] come morning
[1:50:28] how well that'll be a reality we sing it
[1:50:32] now but it'll be a reality one day and
[1:50:34] when it becomes a reality you'll
[1:50:35] understand and listen to yourself
[1:50:37] singing this song today
[1:50:41] you'll hear it and you'll say oh
[1:50:44] the tolls of life
[1:50:47] are gonna be over
[1:50:50] we've come to the end
[1:50:59] you love the Lord
[1:51:02] this was made with holy hands and this
[1:51:04] was made with holy hands so we're doing
[1:51:06] exactly what the Bible tells us to do we
[1:51:08] didn't buy this and it's not going to be
[1:51:10] held over it's going to be burnt the
[1:51:13] wine is going to be put back together
[1:51:14] and it's just going to keep getting
[1:51:15] better and better it just keeps working
[1:51:17] all the way through
[1:51:18] for years
[1:51:20] oh they think they got vintage wine
[1:51:22] several hundred thousand dollars a
[1:51:24] bottle
[1:51:28] not like this one
[1:51:30] this wine is fixing to go into the
[1:51:32] Eternal vessel
[1:51:34] and it's going to become part of us
[1:51:36] and then the Lord's going to smile down
[1:51:38] and said hey they're doing what I told
[1:51:40] them to do let's just give them a
[1:51:42] special blessing today let's take
[1:51:43] communion
[1:51:52] you know I was thinking the other day
[1:51:54] while they
[1:51:55] take that up
[1:51:57] um well
[1:51:59] it was taken while they're taking this
[1:52:00] up
[1:52:02] um
[1:52:03] you know sometimes we stand around and
[1:52:05] we talk about um
[1:52:06] uh Brother Gary Atkins when the ones
[1:52:08] that went on
[1:52:11] and I was uh
[1:52:13] just kind of trying to remember
[1:52:15] everybody you know the tatums and and
[1:52:17] brother moat and I'm not finished with
[1:52:20] my Bible I need to never put my sword
[1:52:21] down and uh
[1:52:24] I was thinking about that the other day
[1:52:29] now whether you think I'm crazy or not
[1:52:32] that's all right
[1:52:33] but the thought came to me said well
[1:52:35] when you call their name said I just
[1:52:37] reach over and nudge them and say hey
[1:52:38] they're talking about you
[1:52:40] hey they're talking about you
[1:52:44] until they're over there and uh just a
[1:52:46] bliss you know they're just you know
[1:52:47] they're in just a a state of euphoria
[1:52:50] they're not here going we might get to
[1:52:53] the house today I got to work tomorrow
[1:52:55] no they're waiting on us
[1:52:58] they're over there with all the ones
[1:53:00] just went on with brother Brandon and
[1:53:01] all the different ones
[1:53:04] and we say their name over here
[1:53:07] that's all I was doing I was trying to
[1:53:09] remember the name different ones all of
[1:53:11] us has got somebody that's passed on
[1:53:13] that we're connected to all of us
[1:53:15] and the thought came to me said well
[1:53:18] so when you called their name said we
[1:53:19] just nudge them over there on the other
[1:53:21] side and say hey they're talking about
[1:53:22] you
[1:53:23] you say oh it's crazy I don't think it
[1:53:26] is
[1:53:27] how many times did Brother Brown said uh
[1:53:29] you know Lord let them look over the
[1:53:30] banister of time
[1:53:32] and look down and see what's going on
[1:53:35] I think they do that especially when we
[1:53:37] say
[1:53:38] talk about Gary
[1:53:40] talk about different ones
[1:53:43] Brother Richard Marlo different ones
[1:53:45] they're doing it now hey they're talking
[1:53:47] about you they haven't forgot you
[1:53:52] but you know what I think they're
[1:53:53] telling that they're telling the angel
[1:53:54] to tell back to us hurry up
[1:53:58] we want to see you again
[1:54:01] we want to pick up our bodies and we
[1:54:02] want to be humans again
[1:54:07] supper being ended the devil now having
[1:54:09] part in the heart put in the heart of
[1:54:10] Judas this carrot Simon's son to betray
[1:54:12] him Jesus knowing that that the father
[1:54:15] had given all things into his hand he
[1:54:17] was come from God and went to God he
[1:54:19] rises from supper and later inside His
[1:54:22] Garment and took a towel and girded
[1:54:24] himself after that he pouredth water
[1:54:25] into a basin and began to watch the
[1:54:27] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[1:54:29] towel or with he was girded then cometh
[1:54:32] he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto
[1:54:34] him Lord are you going to wash my feet
[1:54:36] Jesus said uh what I do thou knowest not
[1:54:39] now but probably in just about 11 days
[1:54:41] You're Gonna understand what's going on
[1:54:43] day of Pentecost
[1:54:45] but Thou shalt know hereafter
[1:54:48] Peter said unto him Thou shalt never
[1:54:50] wash my feet Jesus answered and said if
[1:54:52] I wash thee not thou Hast no part with
[1:54:54] me
[1:54:55] Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[1:54:58] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:55:01] Jesus said to him he that is washed and
[1:55:03] he is not deceived to wash his feet but
[1:55:05] it's clean every wet and you're clean
[1:55:07] but not all talking about Judas for he
[1:55:10] knew who should betray him therefore he
[1:55:12] said you're not all clean so after he
[1:55:15] had washed their feet he took his
[1:55:17] garment laid it down
[1:55:19] he kind of just he's the buddy you know
[1:55:21] he just went over there brother George
[1:55:22] just sat down beside him probably in one
[1:55:23] of those chairs like that after he got
[1:55:25] finished because they're all probably
[1:55:26] going
[1:55:28] why'd he do that for
[1:55:30] why'd you do that's our Master that's
[1:55:32] our that's our teacher
[1:55:35] uh Peter says Thou Art the son of God
[1:55:38] why are you doing this and I'm sure that
[1:55:41] was all in their minds
[1:55:43] and he deserved it
[1:55:46] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:55:48] taken His Garment and sat down he said
[1:55:51] know you what I've done to you
[1:55:54] you call me master and Lord and you say
[1:55:56] well for so I am
[1:55:58] if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:56:00] washed your feet you also ought to wash
