[4:41] let's just pray before we read father in
[4:43] the precious name of Jesus Christ we're
[4:45] approaching the throne of grace and
[4:47] mercy Lord
[4:48] knowing dear God no matter what we could
[4:50] say Lord God if if that great Dynamics
[4:53] was an idiot father it wouldn't be
[4:56] father we believe that that you're here
[4:59] Lord not only tonight Lord but you've
[5:01] been here Lord God I've watched a week
[5:03] after week after week month after month
[5:06] year after year our brothers just lay
[5:09] the word down lord but father tonight
[5:11] Lord God I'd like to see what it's done
[5:15] I believe Lord God there's a way
[5:18] it's not just sitting and listening and
[5:20] and not not really uh you can even
[5:24] participate and not know nothing
[5:27] but God the two Cadillacs is sitting
[5:30] there father
[5:31] they look just alike Lord
[5:34] two authors just put them together
[5:37] one of them's life and one of them's
[5:38] death
[5:39] and there's got to be a way Lord God and
[5:41] we know it's the word but it's not just
[5:44] a word it's the Dynamics in the word and
[5:47] father we as pray tonight that I'll be
[5:50] able to say something that will help
[5:51] somebody Lord that's all I've ever
[5:53] wanted to do is just help somebody Lord
[5:55] if it's one or if it's more God just
[5:58] help me to do yield and humble myself
[6:01] before you Lord God and use me Lord for
[6:04] thou in thy way in Jesus name amen
[6:08] and she started out by this I got a I I
[6:11] hope y'all don't get nervous all these
[6:13] uh pages I got up here we should would
[6:16] bro Wade and uh Brother Sam I tell you
[6:19] brother it's it's uh it's a
[6:23] people needs to
[6:24] really get serious about this thing
[6:28] because if there's no sincerity
[6:32] it may not be no justification for you
[6:35] so we got to be sincerely
[6:38] grateful to God
[6:40] and obedient to God now let's just start
[6:43] this off now Faith is a substance of
[6:46] things hoped for
[6:47] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[6:51] now to me this scripture is just exactly
[6:54] like Hebrews 13 8.
[6:57] see we need to understand I mean I I was
[6:59] reading here a while back in on uh on
[7:03] this talking about Judas and and I was I
[7:05] had some notes I was going to bring on
[7:06] and talk about it but uh he would
[7:09] Brothers he was justified and sanctified
[7:13] and showed his colors there it didn't go
[7:15] up you know but you know he said his
[7:17] name was on the Lamb's Book of Life
[7:19] now what do you think about that the
[7:22] Lamb's Book of Life what do you think
[7:23] about a church
[7:25] see you can't you can't always read
[7:27] these these notes and get and get it you
[7:30] can't always read Webster right you are
[7:33] strong concordance you can we can find
[7:36] out what words but listen long ago they
[7:39] didn't have commas and periods and and
[7:41] stuff like that it had Revelation right
[7:44] right so let's just uh let's just uh
[7:46] read this one more time and let's be
[7:47] seated now Faith is a substance of
[7:50] things hoped for the evidence of things
[7:52] not seen you can be seen
[7:57] now listen let me say I'm this is how I
[7:59] see it and that's all I can do is I can
[8:01] preach I can only do what God shows me
[8:04] to do and and I'll do that if no matter
[8:06] what now Faith is a substance
[8:11] how do you interpret that
[8:13] Faith well that's Revelation brother
[8:16] give me it is
[8:18] what is substance
[8:20] say well that's Faith that's God
[8:23] amen
[8:24] faith is is a substance or substance
[8:28] brings the faith of the all the Hope in
[8:32] the Bible the things it ain't seen
[8:35] now these things there's promises made
[8:37] for us and we must fulfill those
[8:40] promises and we must see what those
[8:42] promises is
[8:44] and there's a way to get there
[8:46] if we can if we can do it right there's
[8:50] a way
[8:52] let's go on a little bit
[8:54] now Faith is a substance the substance
[8:57] is God and the faith is of God and by
[9:01] having that in your new birth you've got
[9:03] the promise of everything in the laodice
[9:06] your age plus all the way back to
[9:08] capture
[9:10] that's why we're called to do something
[9:12] we're called to make manifest the
[9:15] rapture to bring God on the scene to
[9:18] vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17 30. amen
[9:22] amen Hebrews 13 8 John 14 12. we're
[9:26] we're called on to manifest these things
[9:28] and we it is not going to come except
[9:32] through desperation
[9:35] it's going to take a Godly desperation
[9:38] like we've never known because we talk
[9:40] about a a Rapture in faith that he said
[9:43] would come amen he said it would come
[9:45] brother he said something he said well
[9:48] that's what's happening the life of it
[9:50] now when he when brother Dale and bro
[9:53] wait the ministers preach see it's the
[9:56] it's a life in there and this is what we
[9:58] could be missing because if we see this
[10:01] if we see what's going on and it don't
[10:04] make you desperate somewhere wrong right
[10:07] so what he said God says you can't make
[10:10] yourself desperate no you can't but
[10:13] Christ can against who Christ is
[10:16] Christ is the word and if you don't see
[10:19] the word and it don't make you desperate
[10:22] listen I've said here for years and
[10:25] years and years and brother Dale has
[10:27] said a lot of things that I didn't
[10:29] understand
[10:30] but it put me in desperation the moment
[10:33] he said it right and I'd never come out
[10:36] of desperation until God showed me that
[10:44] right I got a little something here if I
[10:46] can find it
[10:49] I just scratched this out this morning
[10:51] may not mean nothing anybody but it
[10:53] means a lot to me
[10:56] every day every service we're 10. we
[11:00] have a decision to make
[11:02] are we going to believe and accept the
[11:04] truth
[11:06] from a time I get up in the morning and
[11:09] it should be all of us till I lay my
[11:12] head back on the bed at night
[11:15] I've been making decisions choices
[11:19] to make what kind of choice
[11:22] for God are we making what kind of
[11:25] decisions are we making
[11:30] are these choices and decision being
[11:34] made through desperation
[11:38] because brother Brown said be desperate
[11:41] to perish
[11:43] do we read the books
[11:45] do we really because you know he said in
[11:48] these books and takes lives Rapture and
[11:49] faith
[11:50] do we know
[11:52] I was thinking about Judas want to go
[11:55] he's in these notes here it says his
[11:58] name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[12:01] now how can that be
[12:04] but see these people apparently don't
[12:06] know how to break that down right right
[12:07] now being you do because we have a
[12:10] revelation the Lamb's Book
[12:13] it's a the lamb it's a it's a lamb with
[12:16] a with a what that you you say Peggy
[12:19] that was in between that right there
[12:21] well whatever it's a gap
[12:24] hits the Gap it's it's a it's a the
[12:26] Lambs it's it's it's his book right
[12:29] right he put a book of life out there a
[12:31] book of life but he's got a Lamb's Book
[12:34] of Life with our Eternal names on it
[12:37] that he and we're to get the Revelation
[12:39] all the way back to the attribute
[12:43] because you can't add nothing to God you
[12:45] can't take nothing from God so we're
[12:47] always there a high is one of the
[12:50] greatest Mysteries I have ever I don't
[12:53] even know how to talk about it how God
[12:55] in in in his great being could be there
[13:00] and and produce I mean he ain't adding
[13:03] that because he's there he knows how you
[13:06] can get into that mystery he has to
[13:09] bring you there and show you because
[13:12] election that he said he said it
[13:15] different ways but it's the same thing
[13:16] election looks to forek knowledge
[13:19] now if I've got the new birth then God's
[13:22] foreknowledge is in my soul
[13:24] so he takes that four knowledge and he
[13:27] shows me that I am his elected and by me
[13:30] showing me that I am his elected he
[13:33] showed me my predestination and my
[13:35] predestination needed by this it is all
[13:38] happening right here it shows me my
[13:40] destiny right
[13:46] right he uh preached the seals
[13:50] and he said now we can say these by
[13:53] words I mean I gotta I've said it just
[13:55] like the Lamb's Book of Life how many
[13:57] times have I read that right but he
[14:00] finally somebody wise they'll be
[14:02] fighting the later quotes they started
[14:04] breaking that down
[14:06] I said praise God for that right because
[14:08] people read it and don't know it and
[14:10] they won't ask nobody
[14:13] well maybe maybe some does
[14:17] it and that's good right that's good
[14:21] but uh he preach those seals
[14:24] and he he said when he this was in March
[14:28] and he preached seven seal he said a
[14:31] fold opened today yeah we know this he
[14:34] said a fold open yesterday and one
[14:37] opened today
[14:38] and what I heard rather I seen and
[14:41] couldn't make it out
[14:43] now the fold he seen yesterday was a fir
[14:46] or the 6C it was the entire book of
[14:49] sanctification
[14:50] because we're the one the life in it the
[14:52] life in it is a book of sanctification
[14:56] and he stood there with the lamb taking
[15:00] the book that he was and see we each one
[15:04] of us has to take this journey
[15:06] and become the book completed our part
[15:10] in the book completed we must see that
[15:13] and it's going to take Godly sincere
[15:17] desperation for you to make it that's
[15:19] why brother Brown said
[15:21] I doubtful does it makes it right
[15:24] that'll make you desperate
[15:27] I'm saying I'm talking about desperate
[15:28] I'm not talking about just I'm talking
[15:31] about desperate like I like I can't
[15:34] explain
[15:36] I stay I'll tell you church I stayed
[15:39] there my wife says Dean you don't never
[15:40] get no peace I said if you die to the
[15:43] world in the ways of the world I said
[15:46] what is there
[15:48] right but the peace we have sister Susan
[15:50] is a Holy Spirit
[15:53] see and following God and God is the
[15:57] word he's the Christ he's the Michael
[15:59] that came into you through justification
[16:02] and baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[16:04] been fighting for you why but by the
[16:07] time that you were placed in your
[16:09] mother's womb an angel would place right
[16:11] there and protect you and he didn't
[16:13] Satan would have took your life then
[16:16] now
[16:17] he preached the seals and he brought
[16:19] that in in from March to July he
[16:22] preached Christ to Mr God revealed a
[16:25] threefold mystery
[16:27] he said in that self-seal he was in a
[16:29] three-fold
[16:30] listen oh God
[16:32] now I'm talking about me and you all God
[16:36] in Christ
[16:38] now that cries condescended down and
[16:42] come into you through justification
[16:43] baptism of those and it becomes a new
[16:46] birth
[16:47] and there's things you could say that
[16:50] would just blow people's mind I called
[16:52] brother Brown said that you that ain't
[16:54] the new birth
[16:55] now you just say where the baptism the
[16:57] Holy Ghost you've got to understand it
[17:00] right and you can and you must
[17:02] understand it
[17:04] that's right that's right
[17:08] he preached the threefold mystery
[17:11] all God in Christ
[17:14] all Christ in the church that's me and
[17:17] you and the kingdom restored what is the
[17:20] kingdom
[17:23] God cries the kingdom restored that's
[17:28] like at the end of the uh the prayer
[17:31] Like Our Father which are in heaven he
[17:33] said they are the king Kingdom and the
[17:36] power and the glory listen the kingdom
[17:39] is the words that's Christ that's
[17:41] almighty God and the power of that and
[17:46] the glory of that is in you and me
[17:50] see those little things might not matter
[17:52] to you like like uh the end of uh though
[17:57] you ain't though I walk through the
[17:58] valley of the shed of death right you
[18:00] know it goes to the end he says and I
[18:02] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[18:04] forever what do we see there do we see a
[18:07] domain yes we gonna be there but the
[18:10] house of God is this right here and I'm
[18:12] going to dwell in the house of the Lord
[18:14] forever and so are you
[18:18] it ought to make you desperate Church
[18:20] it ought to make you want God it all
[18:22] makes you jump because listen I I
[18:24] apologize my health is kind went down
[18:28] but he's back I don't claim that no more
[18:37] it's called faith is the substance I
[18:40] have the substance of God brother and
[18:42] every promise in this book is mine
[18:45] he said he said you can manifest
[18:48] anything that's revealed to you and I
[18:51] tell you that all you got to do and by
[18:53] that Revelation is stand there only and
[18:55] God somewhere I'll come to it and make
[18:58] it manifest because he's the only
[18:59] Manifesto there is
[19:01] and
[19:02] age we talk about age I said age ain't
[19:04] got nothing to do this rapture
[19:07] I don't know how about Ian how old was
[19:08] he
[19:10] how about Elijah how old was he
[19:14] right how about Caleb I just use a few
[19:17] that was aged up he said I was strong
[19:19] now as I was when I went out I believe
[19:22] God's deceived the same God I believe
[19:24] he's a god of the impossibilities
[19:27] he changed the old man and old woman
[19:30] back to a young man and a young woman
[19:32] one time
[19:34] right showing us a type that I that we
[19:38] can have Divine Healing here listen I'm
[19:40] gonna I got in my notes I'm just kind of
[19:42] done
[19:44] left it a little bit
[19:49] Satan Satan will always
[19:54] come at you
[19:56] but this bride today is to become so
[20:00] garrisoned by God
[20:03] that his effects is going to be stopped
[20:06] on you man you hear me his effects
[20:09] here's a facts I don't care what you got
[20:12] if you hold on gotta come to it
[20:16] it's time to quit this
[20:19] doubting
[20:21] let's just let's go let me just right
[20:23] quick go to Genesis 18.
[20:35] I wanna I just I mean this is I mean I

[21:01] it
[21:08] God is every time you listen every time
[21:10] you turn the bug every time you you just
[21:13] turn the Bible brother here's all you
[21:15] can do to go where you was going to
[21:16] because you won't just stop and preach
[21:18] on that

[21:28] God Amen and well Paige I turned he'd
[21:31] reveal something have a page he would
[21:33] reveal something
[21:35] now desperation to do that if
[21:38] desperation to do that to one
[21:40] desperation and do it to somebody else
[21:42] you get in that same position if you
[21:45] you've got to want
[21:47] you got to want it more than anything
[21:49] you got to whoa God
[21:52] you got to what he said he wants to heal
[21:55] you more than you want to be healed it's
[21:57] going to take desperation on your part
[21:59] in my part to fulfill this right it
[22:03] would quit playing Church a lot of times
[22:05] and and and it's trying to organize
[22:09] ourselves
[22:10] I'm not saying we're organizations I'm
[22:12] not saying that but if we ain't careful
[22:14] we can get we can organize ourselves
[22:18] how people don't believe that no I've

[22:40] but I believe this man
[22:43] many many many many years ago when I
[22:47] first come to this church it was a
[22:49] little box here
[22:51] I come in and The Minister's meeting one
[22:53] night and I walked in and I heard some
[22:55] things right away
[22:57] I said God

[23:28] message

[23:38] important

[23:44] covered all this bro wait I mean at
[23:46] least cover these things but I tell you
[23:48] what though is revealed to you there's
[23:51] still a supernatural illness not made
[23:53] known to you and see that's what
[23:55] happened when brother Brown preached so
[23:57] seals he said a fold open yesterday went
[24:00] over today and I heard one he said I
[24:02] seen one and that's Supernatural element
[24:04] of that Silver Seal opened in Christ the

[24:29] would your attitude be

[24:37] sitting there just
[24:39] well how long didn't he how long is he
[24:42] going to go does he go along
[24:44] yeah I'm afraid
[24:50] I'm gonna I'm gonna just I'm gonna skip
[24:52] about here a little bit on the 17th
[24:54] chapter of uh uh Genesis you know he
[24:57] walked for 25 years with the promise of
[25:00] God to believe in God
[25:02] you know he wasn't circumcised
[25:06] if you if you read if you read I'm gonna
[25:09] invite you a lot I got a lot of
[25:11] scriptures I know I ain't gonna be able
[25:13] to get to
[25:14] but I'm gonna see them to you you write
[25:17] them down and I would read them
[25:20] I would read if listen if God
[25:23] is deadly were the man
[25:26] and he has anointed him to speak you
[25:29] better listen I've learned that a long
[25:32] time ago now listen we humans we have uh
[25:35] we have a disagreement sometimes but I
[25:38] guarantee you if you'll stop a minute
[25:41] and don't wait
[25:43] get that thing out of the way
[25:46] get it out of the way don't don't let it
[25:48] linger
[25:49] because he just grows out of proportion
[25:51] but you know it's things that I can say
[25:54] it I won't because I'm all I'm saying is
[25:57] I'm back and
[25:59] when Abram was listen when Abram was 90
[26:02] years old and nine the Lord appeared to
[26:05] Abraham Abram and said unto you I am the
[26:08] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[26:10] perfect
[26:11] exactly what if what has he been telling
[26:14] you
[26:15] there's a message that the prophet of
[26:17] God said oh Perfection or a perfect
[26:19] faith
[26:21] have we got it memorized
[26:24] have we ever even read it no I'm not I'm
[26:28] not saying no yeah but I'm just saying
[26:29] this is going out somewhere
[26:32] right have you read them
[26:35] right
[26:36] I will make my Covenant between me and
[26:39] thee and we'll put multiply the
[26:42] exceedingly do you see yourself there
[26:46] he said scriptures he said the one Eagle
[26:50] in the other Eagle he's talking about
[26:52] the wings of an eagle I'm talking about
[26:55] Jehovah eagle
[26:57] he's talking to Abram whose seat we are
[27:01] if we are
[27:04] right Abram fell on his face and God
[27:06] taught with him saying
[27:08] now God I I've just I I I'm going to try
[27:12] to not stop on each one of them
[27:15] but now what if God
[27:19] appeared to you in a vision
[27:21] or in a dream that's that's so real he
[27:25] looked like a vision right
[27:27] but let's just say you was awakened God
[27:29] would God would somehow hold you because
[27:32] he'd have to do something to talk with
[27:34] you if you don't and I knew it with me
[27:36] because he's probably make my heart stop
[27:40] yeah but you God didn't do something
[27:42] Jesus in Gethsemane was just about gold
[27:45] and the angels come
[27:47] just in time to strengthen him
[27:51] right so the angel your angel brought
[27:54] Sam
[27:55] but wait did each one of you it's right
[27:58] there with you Realm
[28:00] this Angel this place is full of angels
[28:04] and God why are they here because God is
[28:08] here
[28:10] do we believe it
[28:14] where's our thoughts ahead
[28:16] right do we do we
[28:19] this word should make us so desperate
[28:25] that we wouldn't be able to eat or sleep
[28:27] until we get answers from God that's the
[28:31] way it's done me
[28:34] right yeah well I got two verses read
[28:40] I'm gonna just I'm gonna just
[28:43] I will make these six verses exceedingly
[28:46] fruitful and I will make Nations out of
[28:48] the and King shall come out of thee and
[28:51] I will establish my covenants between me
[28:53] and thee and they said when he was doing
[28:55] that he was doing it with me and you
[28:57] and that seat after thee see in their
[29:00] generations for our devil actually come
[29:02] to be a god unto thee and to that seed
[29:04] after thee
[29:06] he promised he's right here in the word
[29:09] he promised it
[29:12] right and I will give it to thee and to
[29:15] that seed I said Thee the land where
[29:17] there are a stranger all the land listen
[29:19] this land that I'm in
[29:22] right this this land that that I live
[29:24] that he that he here see I was a
[29:26] stranger
[29:28] but he has he has made it alive and
[29:30] deeded it to me
[29:32] he he said this is my eye God gave it to
[29:37] me okay I turn around and get it back to
[29:39] him like Samuel Hannah had Samuel
[29:43] and brought the baby back to uh Eli to
[29:46] raise him in the ways of the Lord
[29:49] and that's the way we are to be
[29:52] we so confused and we and we
[29:56] we we can cause ourselves all kind of
[29:59] trouble because we can't believe God
[30:03] oh yes I believe God we say okay
[30:07] oh you say so let's just let's see I'm
[30:10] gonna just
[30:12] 15th verse and God said unto Abraham as
[30:15] for Sarah thy wife Thou shalt not call
[30:17] her name Sarah if I'm saying that right
[30:18] but Sara shall be her name she had a
[30:21] name change now
[30:23] and I will bless her and I will give
[30:25] this son of her yeah I will bless her
[30:28] and she shall be a mother of Nations
[30:29] Kings of people shall come over her and
[30:32] Abraham
[30:35] and Abraham fell upon his face now
[30:38] listen and laughed and said in his heart
[30:41] shall it shall be born unto him that is
[30:43] a hundred years old and shall say that
[30:45] that is 90 years old Bear right
[30:48] right and Abraham said unto God oh the
[30:51] Ishmael might live before thee
[30:54] right see he he needed a little boost
[30:59] like me and you need a little boost
[31:01] about 24 hours a day every day
[31:06] well see God won't somebody that so will
[31:10] accept him by the word that he has bring
[31:13] it to us that he he come down here and
[31:16] the word in flesh and the spirit and the
[31:19] quote says that he come in flesh to
[31:22] bring the word in our flesh
[31:25] not just in our sober way but in our
[31:28] flesh
[31:29] and then Romans 8 there he says to
[31:31] mortify the Deeds of the flesh right
[31:34] bring it in control
[31:37] don't put nothing in front of God when
[31:40] you get to where you don't put nothing
[31:42] in front of God you'll start seeing God
[31:45] right
[31:46] he'll he'll he'll be here and in his
[31:49] Divine
[31:50] word I mean he's already you talk about
[31:53] Divine Healing that's what he's doing
[31:55] every time the ministry is preaches and
[31:58] it's the truth your sin the Divine
[32:01] resurrection of God going on
[32:05] divine
[32:06] no Divine healer no Resurrection right
[32:09] right see we bring that just to hear in
[32:12] the Bible well that's going to come
[32:14] but right now I'm worried about
[32:16] resurrectionist body because I know
[32:18] that's going to follow
[32:21] right well okay
[32:25] well I won't get away from Israel I
[32:27] don't care about that too much
[32:29] and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[32:31] plains of memory it says 18 verse first
[32:33] I teach that's first verse this is where
[32:35] I want to go and he said in the tent
[32:37] Door In the Heat of the day
[32:40] now put yourself there
[32:43] and he lifted up his eyes and looked and
[32:45] low three men still by him now listen he
[32:48] doesn't talk to him he's done met him
[32:50] he's done melchester I mean he has been
[32:53] blessed he has been told
[32:56] so we made listen I got something here
[32:59] in a minute Lord willing
[33:01] and said my Lord if now I have felt
[33:05] favor in that side you think he
[33:07] recognized him then
[33:09] pay is not a way I pray thee from thy
[33:12] servant
[33:12] let a little water I pray you be fish
[33:15] and wash your feet and rest yourself
[33:17] under the tree right oh God
[33:20] oh god listen
[33:22] let me start tonight and wash
[33:24] everybody's feet
[33:25] that'd be great with me
[33:29] and I will fetch it more so bread and
[33:31] comfort you your heart after that ye
[33:33] shall pass on for therefore or you come
[33:36] to your servant and they said so do as
[33:38] thou has said and Abraham hastened to
[33:41] the tent and to say her and said make
[33:43] really quickly three measures three a
[33:46] fine meal need it and make cakes upon
[33:49] the Earth and Abraham ran into the herd
[33:52] and infested calf I'm going to say and
[33:54] he took butter and milk and the cave
[33:56] which he addressed and said it before
[33:57] them and he stood by them on a tree and
[34:00] they did eat
[34:01] theophany in human flesh
[34:05] right oh God he said Beware you
[34:09] entertain angels unaware
[34:12] right right what about human Angels
[34:15] Messengers Messengers
[34:17] I'll tell you what
[34:20] God is a patient God
[34:22] I am so I am so I am so where is savior
[34:26] thy wife and he said behold in the tent
[34:29] and he said I will certainly return unto
[34:32] thee according to the time of life we
[34:35] all know what that is
[34:37] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[34:41] and Sarah heard it in the tent which was
[34:44] behind him
[34:45] now Abraham and savior were old and
[34:48] well-stricken in age
[34:50] 99 and 90.
[34:52] and it cease to be what Sayer after the
[34:54] men are women
[34:56] therefore say relieve within herself
[34:59] sin after I am waxed oh shall I have
[35:03] pleasure my will my Lord being old also
[35:06] and the Lord said unto Abraham that's
[35:08] what I'm trying to tell you he's here
[35:10] he knows every thought you ever had and
[35:13] go ever going to have
[35:15] right and brother that you talk about
[35:17] helping somebody when God showed me that
[35:19] with me and my wife I was so dominating
[35:22] I don't see how she I mean she had to
[35:24] love me yeah I just I wasn't mean to be
[35:27] but I was dominating it was my way there
[35:29] wasn't no way
[35:31] but God began to deal with me
[35:34] and you know what I found out I loved
[35:36] her more than I didn't mean
[35:38] right that's it
[35:40] I don't wish I wish I asked God every
[35:42] day let me love her more Lord Let Me
[35:44] Love You More let me love your people
[35:45] more men I love you my disciples by the
[35:48] love you have one for another
[35:51] right okay
[35:52] and the Lord said unto Abraham for
[35:54] Abraham 44 did save her life saying
[35:57] shall I of a surety buried child which
[35:59] him old
[36:00] is anything too hard for the Lord right
[36:03] right I want you to hold that thought
[36:06] because God promised us some things
[36:08] right
[36:10] God I mean God himself promised it
[36:14] and we're the seeds spiritually
[36:17] of Abraham
[36:19] we're the completeness
[36:21] of that I heard bro Sam said a little
[36:24] ice cream
[36:25] I said oh God that's what this is but
[36:28] see we don't want as the ministers
[36:30] I'm saying
[36:33] we want everybody in this building
[36:37] to be there
[36:39] but everybody in this in this
[36:41] congregation has to make their own
[36:43] choice
[36:46] they make their own decision
[36:49] there's a decision when you come here
[36:52] and and are you going out the same way
[36:55] you come in
[36:56] you ain't got to do that
[36:59] I believe with all my heart if we if we
[37:02] preach it listen these brothers agree
[37:04] with me I believe if if we preach the
[37:07] truth God
[37:09] how you say it obligated
[37:12] uh we can we can bring the prophet up
[37:15] and show it how God would do things well
[37:18] we ain't deprive it but Jesus is still
[37:20] Jesus he's the same yesterday today and
[37:24] forever right
[37:27] right God we I just John 14 12 the
[37:30] things that I do shall you do also I've
[37:34] seen all these things myself I've seen
[37:37] the scriptures I got I could stand here
[37:39] October of Sam the other day I said we
[37:42] could write a book about me by my life
[37:45] I've seen the dead raised twice
[37:48] I've seen I've seen uh he uh John 14 12.
[37:52] I've seen it
[37:54] amen partake of it many times
[37:58] I have my eyes when I had that aneurysm
[38:01] y'all all remember it I couldn't see out
[38:04] of my left eye had double vision in my
[38:06] right eye I said God what am I going to
[38:08] do
[38:09] how could I go how can I preach I
[38:12] couldn't do anything Lord I'm sitting
[38:14] out on my dick God knows it's the truth
[38:16] son
[38:18] and I was looking and I was I got I was
[38:21] trying to keep feeling sorry for myself
[38:23] I said God you said it I can't say
[38:26] nothing but what you said Lord with your
[38:28] stripes I'm Healed and I and if I
[38:30] couldn't see it that way and my eyes
[38:32] started going over to the left and I
[38:35] said something to myself I said whoa
[38:38] something's happening and I looked and
[38:40] it just went boom it just opened my eye
[38:43] left out here boom I could see
[38:45] everything and not only did God heal
[38:47] that but he healed that double vision
[38:50] and then my right eye
[38:53] and we thank God ain't doing nothing
[38:57] he's going to complete this one day and
[39:00] the doubters and agnostics and all that
[39:03] they gonna be less sudden
[39:06] if God does something for you you ought
[39:09] to tell somebody
[39:13] I got to get off of it but I
[39:17] is anything too hard for the Lord
[39:20] at the time appointed I will return it
[39:22] to thee according to the time of life
[39:24] and say we shall have a son right
[39:27] right didn't say or denies saying I
[39:29] laugh not for you she was afraid and and
[39:32] I don't I would have been too and he
[39:33] said neighbor that I did his life right
[39:37] and the man rose up from this and looked
[39:39] towards Solomon and Abraham went with
[39:41] them to bring them on the way and it
[39:42] talks about Sodom and David I tell you
[39:44] he read the scriptures read them for
[39:47] yourself amen
[39:49] amen meditate over them pray while
[39:51] you're doing it
[39:53] if you're serious
[39:55] about being a son or daughter of God
[39:57] you'll do that right
[40:00] you'll do it every day you'll reach
[40:02] something every day
[40:04] and I don't mean just well now I got 20
[40:07] minutes I that I got set aside I'm on
[40:09] I'm gonna I'm gonna do this well that's
[40:11] hard too that's good
[40:14] but I find I talk to her I know you I'm
[40:16] not saying you don't do this but I
[40:18] talked to him I wake up
[40:21] before I mean I'm talking to him when I
[40:24] wake up right
[40:28] right but the point I'm trying to fix it
[40:30] and make right here Sarah
[40:32] doubted there stood God
[40:38] in human flesh
[40:41] and say we're doubted bless us you and I
[40:45] don't fall into this here category I'm
[40:47] not I'm not down in Sarah I'm I'm not
[40:49] I'm not doing that but what we want to
[40:52] do is do where Mary said did unto me
[40:54] amen according to that word
[40:58] being to me see you send a mouthful
[41:00] there right
[41:07] okay I'm gonna just get on over here and
[41:09] get started
[41:12] with some of the things I hit I want to
[41:14] go to First Peter
[41:23] I'll tell you this stop on the way uh uh
[41:25] First Corinthians 15 because I started I
[41:29] do this while ago and and I just kind of
[41:31] do like I generally do I just I try to I
[41:34] try to bring everything from Genesis to
[41:36] Revelation on every verse
[41:37] I I just I just can't hip it because God
[41:41] has given it and and I feel like a
[41:44] volcano full of fire and wanting to spew
[41:47] over
[41:50] okay in the 15th chapter of First
[41:54] Corinthians
[41:56] oh what a hub for me this is
[42:02] 21st but now is Christ risen from the
[42:06] dead
[42:06] and become the first fruits of them that
[42:09] slip now listen
[42:10] and now
[42:12] Christ is risen from the dead
[42:16] you hear me right here put your you need
[42:19] to put your finger on yourself if Christ
[42:21] is risen in you
[42:23] you ought to recognize it and and not be
[42:27] ashamed of it
[42:29] and you are you are to
[42:34] but now is Christ risen from the dead
[42:37] and become the first fruits of them that
[42:39] slip
[42:40] to me
[42:42] he's the first fruits and and put me in
[42:45] life
[42:46] you know we are the blood by the spirit
[42:50] we are the life of Jesus Christ by the
[42:52] spirit that come into us
[42:55] and if we have the new birth high in the
[42:57] world can why can't we understand these
[43:00] words how come we can't understand the
[43:03] Deep things of God
[43:06] see that's what I'm talking about
[43:07] desperation
[43:12] for sins by Man Came Death
[43:15] by men came also the resurrection of the
[43:17] Dead
[43:19] we can see the type see I could see the
[43:22] type in Abraham and Sarah you know what
[43:24] brother Brown said about that see it
[43:26] took about three days for them to be
[43:28] changed I got the quote
[43:29] he said I can't see it no other way
[43:33] just for cases same occasion he said you
[43:37] got to watch God's numerology right
[43:40] so and then look at the look at what
[43:42] he's done to us we're god with faith we
[43:45] got the baptism Holy Ghost then we move
[43:47] up through the statue of the prayer of
[43:49] man and then the Thunders is revealed to
[43:50] us Glory it just it's just everywhere
[43:54] when it gets to wherever first you read
[43:57] God is revealing something's going on
[44:01] and that ought to make us desperate with
[44:04] the things that's been brought right
[44:05] here we had ought to bring it be brought
[44:07] since it's brought me into desperation
[44:13] I've been preaching on this for years
[44:15] but I see more now than I ever have by
[44:18] the way
[44:19] and the others I mean I I just uh
[44:22] as in Adam all die even so in Christ
[44:25] shall all be made alive
[44:27] the promise of God bro daddy there it is
[44:32] you can't lose
[44:35] there's no way to lose
[44:37] Paul says dad where's your steam right
[44:40] Grace where's your victory
[44:42] you got nothing on me
[44:45] at God's appointed time I come forth
[44:48] and anybody that goes by the ground and
[44:51] I hope and pray that none of us goes by
[44:53] the ground
[44:55] but your Revelation speaks of your
[44:58] predestination
[45:00] and if you can't see your predestination
[45:02] other than in this book
[45:05] you ain't seen it right
[45:09] I ain't trying to
[45:11] tell everybody it ain't wrong I said I'm
[45:13] just trying to bring something that will
[45:16] so energize you
[45:19] that it'll bring God's sincerely
[45:22] desperation in you
[45:25] to make you want to do more I don't mean
[45:29] in works that's comes but I'm talking
[45:31] about the love of God because strange I
[45:35] mean you ain't ashamed right
[45:37] right Sam I wish I had words right
[45:41] I wish I had words to say
[45:43] listen
[45:45] then come at the end we shall have
[45:48] delivered up the kingdom of God even the
[45:51] father now now we see that that's a
[45:53] happening
[45:54] but see that in Revelation 10 1 2 and 3
[45:58] The Mighty angel that comes down in a
[46:00] cloud clove in a cloud
[46:03] puts putting one foot on land and one on
[46:05] sea and declares time is no more that's
[46:08] me he's come far because he takes me
[46:10] from there to Revelation 5 7 it takes
[46:14] the book right
[46:16] and he takes me back to Revelation 10 7
[46:18] and shows me how it happened
[46:25] now something has to stop death from
[46:28] striking this sister
[46:29] something's going to do it and this word
[46:31] is it
[46:34] now listen
[46:36] when he shall put down all Rule and all
[46:38] authority and power so we know this is a
[46:41] time this is I mean because this ended
[46:43] and we go into Rapture and all these
[46:45] things happen
[46:46] right but see we're still on this side
[46:48] and we're wanting to get there because
[46:50] if we don't if we don't have what it
[46:52] takes to get there it ain't gonna matter
[46:54] what goes on over there
[46:56] you can have the knowledge of the word
[46:58] until you slap full and run it over your
[47:01] head and it ain't gonna do you one bit
[47:03] of good
[47:06] read First Corinthians 13.
[47:08] read all the things you have faith you
[47:11] move mountains give your body to be
[47:13] burned right right understand all
[47:14] Mysteries you do all these things and
[47:17] the last verse says faith hope and
[47:19] charity but the greatest of these is
[47:21] Charity why because that's the baptism
[47:24] of the Holy Ghost
[47:26] that's what it ain't just well I'm
[47:28] charitable person I'm gonna give you a
[47:30] little money
[47:31] it's God Amen if you ain't got God I
[47:34] don't care what else you got right
[47:36] I don't care I don't care that the
[47:38] congregations I'm talking about in the
[47:41] world it don't make no difference if you
[47:42] ain't got it you ain't got it
[47:45] and there's one there's one message
[47:49] and how can people listen me and my wife
[47:51] said yesterday evening
[47:54] we're sitting there eating supper and
[47:55] one of my neighbors coming he's a he's a
[47:58] great guy I mean he is he is just a
[48:00] jewel
[48:02] but he's a pastor what is that a Church
[48:04] of God or something like a
[48:06] and he's just took it over and and it
[48:08] was just about gone and they got what
[48:10] 100 people or so now and he was telling
[48:13] me about the healings I said right there
[48:15] at the table he told me I'm sitting
[48:17] there and I saw a gun I I look at Peggy
[48:20] once why and they want people being
[48:22] healed I mean Hill I said and I said now
[48:26] how can this be
[48:28] to think on this I'm not I'm not saying
[48:31] we ain't got nothing but don't
[48:33] misunderstand me
[48:34] but he was saying that and I said and
[48:37] Lord that's happening with him and they
[48:40] ain't got the word I've given books
[48:43] and he made me preaching out some of
[48:45] them books that don't tell nobody that's
[48:47] what I look for
[48:49] right I get him on the first episode of
[48:53] The Sands of Time
[48:54] I staggered him but he finally got over
[48:57] it
[48:58] he's great he's just a fine person
[49:02] but he's uh
[49:03] if the Rapture happened guess what he'd
[49:05] be said
[49:07] and I don't mean that if the Rapture
[49:09] happens it's going to happen
[49:10] I I listen I've talked to him I've
[49:13] talked to him his wife is kind of
[49:16] sharp you know she uh
[49:19] sometimes I wonder who the pastor is
[49:21] but but you know but you know God always
[49:24] always gives me when I'll say something
[49:27] you know they'll be talking we'll be
[49:28] talking just as neighbors and he wants
[49:31] to talk about the word and I'll just and

[49:55] and do what was you talking about back
[49:57] in about three steps up shutting up she
[49:59] did

[50:02] it won't be you speaking but the Holy
[50:04] Spirit be speaking through you now I'm
[50:07] talking about recognizing God and what
[50:09] he's doing in your life not in my life I
[50:11] mean that that's fine that's fine we
[50:14] ought to recognize if I recognize what's
[50:16] going on with you I can pray harder
[50:18] that's what Sam said I mean God he I
[50:21] understand it better now than I ever did
[50:24] right my Lord I'm glad he's he's the one
[50:26] who got the job still to me
[50:28] I'm telling you I said I've said it many
[50:31] times God I feel sorry for saying
[50:35] I mean I mean
[50:37] for he must Reign till he had put all
[50:40] enemies under his feet now Here Comes

[50:48] he's going to be put into well start
[50:50] with he going to be putting a pit for a
[50:51] thousand years then he going to the
[50:53] great white Throne judgment and he going
[50:55] to the Lake of Fire
[50:59] but his actions
[51:01] his ways his his word his denomination
[51:06] has got we have scope got to put the
[51:09] whole armor of God on from the inside
[51:12] out and bring that Shield there that
[51:15] when he comes however he comes he's not
[51:18] going to be able to penetrate this bride
[51:22] do you believe that or you believe like
[51:24] say or did
[51:31] for he has put all things under his feet

[51:45] me and waited on me and my wife
[51:48] I am so glad
[51:50] for that for the for the brothers and
[51:52] sisters that you give me oh God I am so
[51:55] glad I'm so thankful I thank bro Wade
[51:58] when we was up in Canada at that time
[52:00] I've had that I've had that to have I
[52:02] had to have just the other day
[52:05] I would say I I don't know if I've told
[52:07] you I guess I have what it has
[52:09] up there in a cabin and snow was ever
[52:12] where and I had my vehicle and I had one
[52:15] of those little uh racks on the back of
[52:16] it and I went out there to do something
[52:18] and his back was I mean it was I it just
[52:21] it was killing me seeing him oh I don't
[52:24] see how he made it
[52:26] and all at once something happened God
[52:29] is my witness God dropped down or come
[52:32] out I keep saying drop down but he come
[52:34] out and I I I I turned and I went
[52:39] straight up them steps it went right
[52:40] straight to him
[52:41] God healed him
[52:44] amen I'm telling you truth God is real
[52:46] and the same God that done that is here
[52:49] today
[52:50] to fulfill the need that you have in the
[52:53] greatest need I could think that you've
[52:55] got is revelation right
[52:59] desperation revelation
[53:01] amen so you can have knowledge
[53:04] knowledgeable by itself won't do it you
[53:07] know what I see on the Statue of perfect
[53:08] man where he said knowledge right there
[53:10] you know what I see I see the word
[53:12] revelation
[53:14] that's what I look when I when I do you
[53:16] get the knowledge of the word and it's
[53:18] revealed to you then you have the
[53:20] related knowledge of the word right
[53:22] that's what I see
[53:28] for he had put all things under his feet
[53:30] for when he said all things are put unto
[53:32] him it is Manifest that he is accepted
[53:35] which did put all things under him I
[53:38] believe him
[53:39] I believe him now

[53:46] well I'm going to read Peter 1.

[54:07] oh god of mine unless you go to the 17th
[54:11] good gracious alive
[54:16] and if you call on the father
[54:19] who would I respect to a person's judges
[54:22] according to Every Man's work past the
[54:25] time of your soul Journey here in fear
[54:28] that's everything that I've said tonight
[54:31] I'm telling you if it don't listen the
[54:33] fear of the Lord I'm not saying be
[54:35] scared of God but what I'm saying is
[54:38] Lord don't let me come please help me
[54:40] Lord that I will sin against you that I
[54:43] will displease you Lord I don't want to
[54:45] displease you

[54:49] and you got people that God is called
[54:54] that has stood for year after year after
[54:57] year I'm telling you what I just I mean
[55:00] it's just a great thing that God's gave
[55:02] us
[55:03] a five-fold mission a five-fold Ministry
[55:06] is got the same word
[55:09] but they got different ways to applying
[55:11] it
[55:12] everybody ain't teachers but yet in the
[55:14] five four minutes today every one of
[55:16] them's out to teach
[55:17] that you take a pastor you kind of I
[55:20] mean listen
[55:21] a teacher could come along
[55:24] I'm talking about a genuine teacher
[55:27] fivefold Ministry teacher now not a
[55:30] school teacher not a professor but a
[55:33] teacher he might come and say a word but
[55:35] that Pastor pick it up is preach a year
[55:38] on it
[55:39] teaching
[55:43] you believe that
[55:46] I've seen it
[55:50] okay let me see where's where's that for
[55:53] his message as far as much you know if
[55:55] if you call on the father who without
[55:57] respect to a person judges according to
[55:59] Every Man's work past the time of your
[56:02] soul Journey here in fear now I would
[56:04] take that to heart for as much as you
[56:07] know that you were not redeemed with
[56:09] corruptable things as silver and gold
[56:11] from your vain conversation received by
[56:14] tradition from your fathers but with the
[56:17] precious blood of Christ as of a lamb
[56:19] without blemishing with that spot who
[56:22] verily was foreordained before the
[56:24] foundation of the world but was
[56:25] manifesting these last days times for
[56:27] you who by him do believe in God and
[56:30] raise him up from the dead
[56:32] listen and gave him glory this is the
[56:35] one I said and he is the kingdom the
[56:39] power and the glory
[56:42] standing there in just like me and you
[56:47] 've done that
[56:50] seeing that this one that's done this
[56:54] thing that has finished the work he says
[56:57] seeing you have purified your souls in
[57:01] obeying the truth through the Brethren
[57:03] unto a friend's love no through the
[57:06] spirit until unfriends love the brothers
[57:09] see that ye love one another with a pure
[57:11] heart fervently let me say that again
[57:13] sin yeah purified your souls in obeying
[57:17] the truth through the spirit amen you
[57:19] are the blood by the spirit remember
[57:21] that church take that meditate on it
[57:26] until it unfriends love
[57:31] the brethren
[57:33] see that ye love one another with a pure
[57:35] heart freely being born again not of
[57:38] corrupted but seated but Incorruptible
[57:40] by the word of God which is limited
[57:41] abideth forever for All Flesh is as
[57:44] Grace see when we get where we got a big
[57:46] head
[57:49] scripture right
[57:51] for All Flesh is as Grace and all the
[57:54] glory of man is the flowers of Grace the
[57:56] grass withers in the flower thereof
[57:57] followeth away but the word of the Lord
[58:00] didn't do it forever and this is the
[58:02] word which by the gospel is preached
[58:04] unto you amen
[58:06] okay
[58:09] I'm on them
[58:14] I want to read just a Porsche I'm going
[58:16] to skip around and First Kings First
[58:18] Kings 13 and I'm gonna go to Deuteronomy
[58:21] 13 verse the minister here has really
[58:25] tried to lay that down now we could go
[58:28] to Ezekiel 16. and I and I and I by
[58:31] God's grace his hand in leadership I can
[58:34] show you you and where you was at and
[58:37] what God did and I can show you how he
[58:39] dressed you
[58:40] and when he gets down there he gets you
[58:42] dressed right and it's a beautiful it's
[58:45] a beautiful thing how he dressed you and
[58:47] at the moment he got you dressed he went
[58:49] to that other group
[58:51] and God have mercy
[58:54] but you wasn't in one of those brother
[58:56] used to use that in uh what is second
[58:58] Corinthians he says you were murderers
[59:01] and all kinds of things he said and
[59:03] since were some of you but not now right
[59:07] amen think about this God has cleansed
[59:10] you
[59:10] and made you you are whiter than you
[59:13] could ever imagine
[59:15] and then I ought to see that right
[59:22] right okay let me give him a scripture
[59:24] here I want you to
[59:29] I I want you to see it because I I
[59:34] got a little time
[59:41] I want you now I want you to listen to
[59:42] this I'm going to read quick and I'm
[59:44] just going to expound on it just just a
[59:46] little bit and behold there came a man
[59:48] of God out of Judea by the word of the
[59:52] Lord into a methodology by the altar to
[59:55] burn incense there was a man of God here
[59:58] is a man of God sent by God with the
[1:00:02] word of God
[1:00:03] listen he wasn't lost
[1:00:06] he I mean he he might have backslid a
[1:00:09] little bit
[1:00:10] but see being who he was he's surprising
[1:00:13] to me he didn't have the Holy Spirit but
[1:00:15] he had the spirit leading him the spirit
[1:00:17] told him what to do
[1:00:19] and the spirit told him what to do he
[1:00:22] wasn't nobody else he said don't you
[1:00:24] have nothing to do with nobody else
[1:00:25] don't you eat with him don't you drink
[1:00:27] with them don't you stop don't you you
[1:00:29] just go don't go don't go back to where
[1:00:31] you come right
[1:00:33] right so when you started slipping
[1:00:35] you better you better come back quickly
[1:00:37] I'm talking about quickly because you'll
[1:00:40] make a decision tonight I'll make a
[1:00:43] decision tonight
[1:00:49] we'll either go out here
[1:00:51] with a greater Revelation with a greater
[1:00:54] desire
[1:00:56] to have this desperation that this poor
[1:00:59] preacher is trying to preach
[1:01:03] that knows a little bit God has showed
[1:01:06] me about the word of God is the only
[1:01:09] thing that can show you desperation and
[1:01:13] bring you into desperation instead of
[1:01:15] sitting here getting tired and enduring
[1:01:17] the message we are being enthused
[1:01:21] especially me
[1:01:23] special to me and he cried against the
[1:01:25] altar in the word of the Lord and said
[1:01:27] oh all to alter thus saith the Lord be
[1:01:30] holy Child said be born into the house
[1:01:32] of David Josiah by the by name and upon
[1:01:35] thee shall be offer the priests of the
[1:01:37] high places that burning sense of puppy
[1:01:40] and men's bone shall be burned upon thee
[1:01:42] and he gave his side the same day said
[1:01:44] this is a sign the Lord has spoken
[1:01:46] Behold The Altar shall be written and
[1:01:48] now she's done that are punished shall
[1:01:50] be poured out right
[1:01:52] okay
[1:01:54] and he came to pass when King George
[1:01:57] Obama if I'm saying it right I heard you
[1:01:59] saying of the men of God which the man
[1:02:02] of God I'm I'm expanded on that
[1:02:05] he was a man of God
[1:02:07] how do we treat men of God sisters of
[1:02:10] God
[1:02:11] we listen to the church that Jesus
[1:02:14] Christ is coming for We Are One with him
[1:02:18] and each other in him that's the one
[1:02:21] he's coming for
[1:02:23] so we better
[1:02:25] if there's any confusion Among Us in
[1:02:27] Schism amongst it we better get it out
[1:02:29] of the way I've learned that myself
[1:02:32] and it came to pass when King George I
[1:02:34] heard the sin of the man of God which
[1:02:36] has cried against the altar in Bethel
[1:02:37] that he put forth his hand from the
[1:02:39] altar saying lay hold on him in his hand
[1:02:42] which he put forth against him dried up
[1:02:44] so that he could not put it in again to
[1:02:46] him
[1:02:47] because it's not my anointed do I
[1:02:50] promise no harm say God working God if
[1:02:53] he's working here in the Old Testament
[1:02:55] how about where he's working now right
[1:02:59] we just don't we we pray we have people
[1:03:03] pray for us and that's right and we go
[1:03:06] right back and and next day you know
[1:03:09] we'll be right back right back see if
[1:03:12] you ask God something and you ask a man
[1:03:14] of God to pray with you and for you
[1:03:17] you stand right there on that don't you
[1:03:20] let no no devil move you off of it right
[1:03:24] right and it'll come to pass through
[1:03:25] he'll come
[1:03:28] the altar also was red and the ashes
[1:03:30] poured out from the altar according to
[1:03:32] decide which the man of God had given by
[1:03:34] the word of the Lord and the King
[1:03:36] answered and said it to the man of God
[1:03:37] and treat now the face of the Lord thy
[1:03:39] God and pray for me that my hand may be
[1:03:41] restored again and the man of God
[1:03:44] besought the Lord in the king's hand
[1:03:45] were restored to him again it became as
[1:03:47] it was before Divine Healing
[1:03:49] you know you mean the Old Testament yeah
[1:03:52] I mean in the Old Testament God when
[1:03:54] when the almighty God come down he
[1:03:57] condescended down you know who that was
[1:03:59] he was Grace condescending down
[1:04:02] Almighty Grace
[1:04:04] and the King said unto the man God come
[1:04:07] home with me and refresh thyself and I
[1:04:10] will give thee every word listen he held
[1:04:12] on forth and the man of God said unto
[1:04:13] the king if thou will give me half thy
[1:04:15] house I will not go in with thee neither
[1:04:17] will I eat bread nor will drink water in
[1:04:19] this place why do you want to
[1:04:24] come around right
[1:04:26] we're unbeliever he tells you on the
[1:04:28] marriage he says don't do that
[1:04:32] I mean I we could we could get in a lot
[1:04:34] of things here in in
[1:04:36] sometimes I think people don't
[1:04:38] understand
[1:04:39] well I know they don't oh they wouldn't
[1:04:41] maybe it wouldn't take the way they do
[1:04:45] for so was it charged me by the word of
[1:04:48] the Lord saying eat no bread no drink
[1:04:50] water to turn again in the same way the
[1:04:52] thighs came so he went another way and
[1:04:55] returned up by the way that he came to
[1:04:56] bethle he's going pretty good there
[1:04:58] and he helped up pretty pretty good but
[1:05:01] watch watch come on him
[1:05:03] now their dwelled in Old prophet in
[1:05:05] Bethel and his sons came and told him
[1:05:07] all the works said the men of God had
[1:05:09] done that day in Bethel The Words which
[1:05:10] he The Words which he had spoken to the
[1:05:13] king then they told also to their father
[1:05:16] and their father said unto them which
[1:05:18] way did he did he win did he go
[1:05:20] and it came to pass and just let me see
[1:05:23] I'm doing the same thing here
[1:05:29] I guess working the two pages don't work
[1:05:32] that
[1:05:33] so it has seen what way the man Our God
[1:05:35] winch came from Judea and he said unto
[1:05:37] his son settle me the ash so they
[1:05:39] settled the eyes and he rode there and
[1:05:41] he went out to the man of God and found
[1:05:42] him sitting on the Oak and he said to
[1:05:44] him are there the man of God that came
[1:05:46] from Judah and he said I am then he said
[1:05:49] unto me come home and with me and eat
[1:05:51] bread he said I may not return with thee
[1:05:53] now go in with thee neither will I eat
[1:05:55] bread and I drink water with thee in
[1:05:57] this place for it was said to me by the
[1:05:59] word of the Lord they shall not eat no
[1:06:01] bread nor drink water there nor turn
[1:06:03] again to go by the way that there came
[1:06:04] us he said unto him I am a prophet also
[1:06:08] as Thou Art I don't think so yeah and
[1:06:12] that the Lord saying bring him back of
[1:06:15] course it'll be a test Moses you know
[1:06:17] Moses were tested
[1:06:18] he said the Lord says I'm going to he
[1:06:21] said Moses stand there I'm going to do
[1:06:23] away with this crowd and I'm going to
[1:06:25] start a whole nation with you he said
[1:06:27] Lord don't do it
[1:06:28] you know what bro Brown said you know
[1:06:30] what he said he he told him he said
[1:06:32] they'll say you've got to buy and you
[1:06:34] couldn't get it in he said I mean he he
[1:06:36] that was Christ talking through Moses
[1:06:38] but see listen brother Brown said that
[1:06:42] was God testing Moses you know my
[1:06:45] thoughts went to he went to Brother
[1:06:46] Banner when he was in that meeting and
[1:06:48] that young man that woman was out there
[1:06:50] doing all them things he said young man
[1:06:53] stop that
[1:06:55] he said this is the place of God don't
[1:06:57] be doing those things they wouldn't stop
[1:06:59] it it went on he said it two or three
[1:07:01] times and the God says you say it
[1:07:04] what you say and blindness they blind
[1:07:07] whatever you say that's where he says he
[1:07:10] says I forgive you
[1:07:13] oh god sister Gail
[1:07:15] oh God give me that Lord
[1:07:18] let me have that
[1:07:20] he says he's working it he's listen I'm
[1:07:23] going to say this
[1:07:24] Church he's on his way
[1:07:28] he's on his way I don't mean he he's in
[1:07:31] he's inside you and me on his way to
[1:07:35] completeness
[1:07:37] me and you
[1:07:40] said bring him back until he said other
[1:07:43] Lord saying bring him back with thee
[1:07:45] into that house that he may eat bread
[1:07:47] and drink water but he lied unto him
[1:07:49] right
[1:07:51] so he went back with him and did he
[1:07:54] bread in this house and drank water
[1:07:55] listen
[1:07:57] God told the man of God what to do
[1:08:01] now I understand what Sam said listen
[1:08:04] God it was people trying to tell about a
[1:08:06] deal if I get it wrong said you you say
[1:08:09] that I'm trying to tell him something he
[1:08:11] said God can tell me
[1:08:14] I believe God enough that God can visit
[1:08:17] me he if he wants to if he want if I
[1:08:20] know it's a prophecy or if I know it's
[1:08:22] it's God he said but if he said but God
[1:08:26] it was something about maybe that and
[1:08:30] and and said he God God gave him the
[1:08:34] Revelation why wouldn't God come back to
[1:08:36] him and say wait a minute you ain't get
[1:08:38] that yes about right God why would he
[1:08:40] send somebody else like it's right here
[1:08:42] he says he said unto you I am a prophet
[1:08:45] also as Thou Art and Angel spoken to me
[1:08:48] by the word of the Lord said bring him
[1:08:49] back with thee into that house that he
[1:08:51] may eat bread and drink water so he went
[1:08:53] back with him and did he bread in his
[1:08:55] house and drink what he came to pass and
[1:08:57] they said at the table that the word of
[1:09:00] the Lord came into the prophet that
[1:09:01] brought him back and he cried into the
[1:09:03] men of God that came from Judas saying
[1:09:05] thus saith the Lord for as much as I
[1:09:07] asked disobeyed the mouth of the Lord
[1:09:09] and has not kept the Commandment which
[1:09:11] the Lord thy God commanded thee but came
[1:09:13] his back and has eaten bread and drunk
[1:09:15] water in the place of the wish the Lord
[1:09:17] did not say to the eat no bread and
[1:09:20] drink no water that cargo shall not come
[1:09:22] into the supper of thy fathers and he
[1:09:25] came to pass after he had eaten bread
[1:09:26] and after he had drunk that he settled
[1:09:28] for him that I asked to wait for the
[1:09:30] prophet whom he had brought back and
[1:09:32] when he was going his line met him a
[1:09:35] line him he's a man of God
[1:09:39] one mistake
[1:09:42] me I got my whole message here I know I
[1:09:45] ain't gonna be able to get it I mean men
[1:09:47] of God that was please God all kinds of
[1:09:51] things and at the last moment of the
[1:09:53] life the life they got lifted up in
[1:09:56] their heart and died got killed
[1:10:00] men of God now you're talking about the
[1:10:03] people that pretending to be God I mean
[1:10:06] are Christians and when he was going and
[1:10:09] I met him by the way and slew him his
[1:10:11] courage was casting away and they stood
[1:10:13] by and the lion also stood by the
[1:10:15] carcass and behold Men passed by and saw
[1:10:18] the car casting away in the last stand
[1:10:19] at the carcass and they can't even told
[1:10:21] her to the city the prophet I'm going to
[1:10:23] skip around him
[1:10:27] and he spoke to his son at 27th verse he
[1:10:30] spoke to his sons sell me the ass and
[1:10:32] they sell him and he went and found he
[1:10:34] when he found his carcass casting away
[1:10:36] about the line and he brought and he and
[1:10:39] the private took up the cars of the man
[1:10:41] and laid it upon the ass and brought it
[1:10:43] back and the old Prophet came to the
[1:10:44] city the morning to burn him and he laid
[1:10:46] his cars in his own in his own grave and
[1:10:49] they mourned over him saying unless my
[1:10:51] brother and he came to pass out he had
[1:10:53] buried him that he spake to his son said
[1:10:55] when I am dead
[1:10:57] bury me into suffocate wherein the man
[1:10:59] of God is buried to lay my bones besides
[1:11:02] his bones for the sandwich he cried by
[1:11:05] the word of the Lord against the altar
[1:11:06] in Bethel and against all the houses of
[1:11:08] the high places which are in the city of
[1:11:10] Samaria shall surely come to pass
[1:11:13] now if you just a minute and I'll skip
[1:11:16] over this I will read the whole thing on
[1:11:18] Deuteronomy
[1:11:21] I just want I just want to get just uh
[1:11:23] because I want you to do it
[1:11:33] I I mean I listen we're tried every day
[1:11:36] that we're Tried by the word we have and
[1:11:39] if we ain't had no word how can we be
[1:11:41] tried right
[1:11:43] if we just if we just got listen if we
[1:11:46] can't get desperate about the word that
[1:11:48] we that we hear and we can't get
[1:11:51] desperate enough to to approach god with
[1:11:54] that desperation that he'll reveal it to
[1:11:57] you and he will
[1:11:59] but it's going to take desperation it's
[1:12:01] going to take Godly desperation sincere
[1:12:04] Godly desperation to to fulfill the word
[1:12:08] to bring the Rapture to pass because and
[1:12:11] that's going to be so much listen we are
[1:12:13] a special designation of him
[1:12:16] we can't just listen it's ageless I got
[1:12:19] it in here it's not just putting verse
[1:12:21] in verse together verse together
[1:12:22] I mean you can be textbook perfect and
[1:12:26] not have no Revelation at all
[1:12:28] I mean perfect in this message
[1:12:31] and not have no Revelation at all right
[1:12:33] just waiting
[1:12:36] because you you see we don't need a
[1:12:38] thing we got something we ain't got it
[1:12:40] we need to be searching more and more
[1:12:43] and don't get settled down
[1:12:47] I don't know why God gave it to me but I
[1:12:50] I just uh well I do too I'm sorry I do
[1:12:53] okay okay here just just a
[1:12:58] about another hour
[1:13:07] how do you hear nobody leave you
[1:13:11] now listen very closely bro Sam said yes
[1:13:14] and the minister says this all the time
[1:13:17] and and it's it's my whole listen my
[1:13:20] whole God I believe God showed me this a
[1:13:23] long time ago my whole Ministry is
[1:13:25] warning
[1:13:26] because if if God gives it to me
[1:13:29] and I will and I bring it out I'm just
[1:13:31] using me now thinking my brothers can
[1:13:33] say the same thing for their and you
[1:13:35] bring it out I mean if if you then it's
[1:13:38] a warning
[1:13:40] right there's Grace if you receive it
[1:13:43] right you can have it by Revelation if
[1:13:46] you want it
[1:13:49] and how can you be satisfied with just
[1:13:52] uh just the knowledge of it right
[1:13:55] right you can't do that Donnie
[1:13:57] it won't it won't take you nowhere
[1:13:59] I mean the bus will pull up you'll be
[1:14:01] left I mean I won't say you I say the
[1:14:03] people will be left
[1:14:06] okay if there arise among you a prophet
[1:14:11] or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee
[1:14:13] sign or wonder
[1:14:15] and his son or the Wonder come to pass
[1:14:18] whereof he spoken to these saying let us
[1:14:21] go out to other gods which thou has not
[1:14:22] known and let us serve them they shall
[1:14:25] not hearken unto the words of that
[1:14:27] Prophet or that dream of Dreams listen
[1:14:30] why can you take it to Matthew 24.
[1:14:34] now I'm I'm I'm I'm telling you can you
[1:14:37] take it
[1:14:38] now he says they'll say Lo he's in the
[1:14:41] desert he's in his secret but don't you
[1:14:44] go there see there's somebody that's
[1:14:47] gonna know the truth and they ain't
[1:14:48] gonna follow these false doctrines and
[1:14:51] praise God we've had a pastor that is
[1:14:54] took those things and laid them out but
[1:14:56] I wonder how many of us remembers yeah
[1:15:01] all right I mean I listen it's if Satan
[1:15:04] is so close to the real thing
[1:15:08] and we're to see the elected if it was
[1:15:10] possible as a matter of fact he said
[1:15:12] except the Lord's showing the days oh no

[1:15:17] can we see the world can we see that
[1:15:20] things that's happening that brother

[1:16:38] tell you something this thing is going
[1:16:40] to come religion and political see all
[1:16:43] this is going to come together this
[1:16:45] world is going to get so bad so bad that
[1:16:49] they gonna see what they've done and
[1:16:50] they're going to start trying to to
[1:16:52] bring God back into it and they're going
[1:16:54] to do it they thing through the
[1:16:56] Catholicism
[1:16:58] I mean I'm telling you it's here that if
[1:17:02] you've seen that on the tube though here
[1:17:04] a while back about to pop it off oh Lord

[1:17:09] with the baptism Holy Ghost I said boy
[1:17:10] that guy said he is Meek he is really
[1:17:13] something
[1:17:16] deception
[1:17:19] I mean God the devil
[1:17:22] false prophet
[1:17:25] programmers talk about in this book I'm
[1:17:27] taught by he said talking about the
[1:17:29] devil's mechanics he's got his mechanics
[1:17:32] laid already late he said he's just
[1:17:35] waiting to bring his Dynamics into it
[1:17:39] how many times you read that
[1:17:42] right I'm asking how many times
[1:17:44] he said
[1:17:46] do you know what his mechanics is
[1:17:50] I'm asking I'm serious do we know
[1:17:54] listen I'm not trying to make nobody mad
[1:17:56] at me I'm just trying to preach the
[1:17:58] gospel
[1:17:59] I've I've done people I mean I've had
[1:18:02] them get mad at me and they'll walk out
[1:18:04] but I'm gonna I'm gonna tell the truth
[1:18:07] I'm going I'm going to do that
[1:18:09] but uh anyway okay and the side of the
[1:18:12] Wonder come to pass where if he's
[1:18:14] speaking to these saying let us go out
[1:18:16] to other gods which that has not known
[1:18:18] and let us serve them now this ain't
[1:18:21] God's like they had back Yonder

[1:18:53] so so that don't make you desperate
[1:18:57] I mean it makes me desperate
[1:19:01] right if there was a change see somebody
[1:19:04] is going to get such a revelation that
[1:19:07] they gonna know
[1:19:09] beyond anything that they have never
[1:19:12] owned never known before

[1:19:22] weighed the last Gentile coming and got
[1:19:23] all anoint Church in
[1:19:25] but listen to what I did in the bottom
[1:19:27] now he said he said you'll see the
[1:19:29] mighty works of God he said but it not
[1:19:31] only then then but now too see this is
[1:19:33] what people are missing
[1:19:35] if he could believe God if we could if
[1:19:37] we could believe God is he said give me
[1:19:39] 10 in here
[1:19:40] ten sons of God give me ten and you'll
[1:19:43] see the war you'll see God you know what

[1:19:52] is anybody y'all y'all ready to go
[1:19:57] true it's true I need to go from here
[1:20:01] not mad
[1:20:03] but searching my life
[1:20:06] right in every aspect of my life I want
[1:20:09] to live and make the Rapture in the
[1:20:12] capacity of this his ship right I want
[1:20:15] it the cap to come on me with the Flames
[1:20:18] where no matter what Satan comes to me
[1:20:22] and would arrange that he brings he's
[1:20:24] going to just bounce off of me
[1:20:27] that's what I want
[1:20:29] that's what I want but then it's just
[1:20:30] yours that's what I want and I'm going
[1:20:32] to get it because he said he'll give you
[1:20:34] desires of your heart
[1:20:38] okay let's just I'm just going to do
[1:20:41] this and if I was y'all I would pick up
[1:20:43] his book and I would turn to Deuteronomy
[1:20:45] 13 and I would read it it tells you
[1:20:47] about the false Christ I mean false
[1:20:50] prophecies and dreamers and shows you
[1:20:52] the signs and wonders right there he
[1:20:53] said if it takes you to another God he
[1:20:56] said God is leading he is letting that
[1:20:58] come on you to test you and see if you
[1:21:01] gonna stay with his word right and he'll
[1:21:04] tell you if you're going down and read
[1:21:05] the chapter you'll tell he'll tell you
[1:21:07] who it is going to come and try to get
[1:21:09] you to do these things
[1:21:11] it's right here in the scripture
[1:21:13] God I wish I had time to do it
[1:21:18] okay
[1:21:19] don't do it I just I just uh
[1:21:23] I want to read it right here uh in
[1:21:25] second Chronicle I'm gonna I'm gonna do
[1:21:27] this and
[1:21:29] while you're looking for I'm gonna read
[1:21:31] this right here
[1:21:32] now Christ Mission Garfield now this has
[1:21:35] been read I mean God how many times it's
[1:21:38] been read but has it been received in in
[1:21:42] in in the form
[1:21:44] that God has come and identified himself
[1:21:47] in your revelation
[1:21:49] because he always identifies himself
[1:21:51] always does
[1:21:52] but when we accept a hybrid denomination
[1:21:55] how can word go through that it's
[1:21:57] granted when it causes it short and
[1:21:58] blows the fuse but when the current is
[1:22:00] Flowing freely the word of God it
[1:22:03] expresses itself The Works that I do
[1:22:05] shall you do also John 14 12. and the
[1:22:08] last days it shall come behold I send
[1:22:10] you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn
[1:22:12] the horses children back to the face of
[1:22:14] the fathers
[1:22:15] are we are we identified with this
[1:22:19] listen in reality
[1:22:23] now it ain't because ain't nobody
[1:22:26] running throughout the aisles and all
[1:22:28] that that ain't where it said
[1:22:30] it's believing this word and receiving

[1:24:38] she brother I said she would have
[1:24:40] officially had the child
[1:24:42] she would have eventually been made
[1:24:45] eternally in her body while she was here
[1:24:47] so she turned it down we come back and
[1:24:51] don't turn it down and we're changed
[1:24:53] right here without dying can't we see

[1:25:55] you can do this and Satan said but she
[1:25:58] turned around and listened to him but
[1:26:00] the Eid in the last day is not going to
[1:26:03] do it because she's predestinated not to

[1:26:20] going to make me or you make one choice
[1:26:23] for him we'd do that with our own free
[1:26:27] choice and that's what he predestinated
[1:26:30] and that sea had come down that seed
[1:26:32] come down and found me and joined
[1:26:35] himself with me

[1:29:46] soul in obeying the truth through the
[1:29:48] word see they showed me I had some
[1:29:49] duties
[1:29:51] he presented it and I took it
[1:29:55] he gave me this eye he gave it to his
[1:29:58] mind Danny

[1:30:01] leg
[1:30:02] he's going let me tell you something
[1:30:04] I'll tell you and I believe this I
[1:30:07] believe it's whatever thing is in me
[1:30:09] I believe I believe that this mind
[1:30:12] is control time
[1:30:13] program said you either received God in
[1:30:17] this mind and he goes down through the
[1:30:19] mind or you reject him right
[1:30:22] all right if I hear the word
[1:30:25] and I have and I do
[1:30:27] the word faith come by here and it comes
[1:30:30] into my brain my brain works everything
[1:30:33] but my soul where he's at is it brings
[1:30:36] it in control see he give me the baptism
[1:30:39] of Holy Ghost and he gave it to me
[1:30:40] because this way he said what is the
[1:30:41] Holy Ghost given for to bring me to the
[1:30:43] word for the hour that I live the
[1:30:46] rapture
[1:30:47] he comes I hear the word he comes into
[1:30:51] my ear and goes to my brain and I accept
[1:30:53] it it goes down through those channels
[1:30:56] memory reason affects his imagination he
[1:30:59] goes down into my soul and God reveals
[1:31:01] it and brings it back up through there
[1:31:03] back through that and he comes and
[1:31:05] brings those memory reasons and in
[1:31:08] subjection he said he said oh would go
[1:31:10] and work and then he comes into CJ feels
[1:31:13] melting here I will do things like these
[1:31:15] two but he steps on his way in and on
[1:31:18] his way out he stamps that brain I know
[1:31:20] it
[1:31:21] and I won't receive nothing else right
[1:31:23] right well because of him not I I said I
[1:31:27] got the holy ghost in the brain I'm
[1:31:28] saying the Holy Ghost is to control this
[1:31:31] whole vessel that's what he wants that's
[1:31:33] what he come and that's what he died for
[1:31:39] that I believe that brother I believe I
[1:31:42] believe I believe that that that he how
[1:31:45] did you get the Holy Ghost anyway if he
[1:31:46] didn't make a way for it to come down
[1:31:48] through there into your into your soul

[1:31:55] you hold your whole trip with him the
[1:31:57] whole journey

[1:32:01] hurry up here
[1:32:04] Josiah was eight years old when he began
[1:32:06] to reign it rained in Jerusalem went in
[1:32:09] 30 years and he did this is this thing I
[1:32:12] want I want you to get here and he did
[1:32:14] that which was right in the sight of the
[1:32:16] Lord
[1:32:17] and walked in the ways of David his
[1:32:19] father and declined neither to the right
[1:32:21] hand or to the left
[1:32:23] and it goes on
[1:32:25] I'm going to do this card of time he
[1:32:28] goes on and tells you all the things of
[1:32:30] God and pleasing God how he done all
[1:32:34] these things
[1:32:35] a man of God Amen parents of God trained
[1:32:39] of God and God accepted him and he
[1:32:42] pleased God
[1:32:44] okay
[1:32:45] okay I I mean you can read it or not
[1:32:48] it's just 34-35
[1:32:52] 35th chapter first verse moreover Josiah
[1:32:56] kept a Passover and to the Lord in
[1:32:58] Jerusalem and they killed the Passover
[1:32:59] on the 14th day of the first month his
[1:33:02] birthday I was preached on these things
[1:33:03] and he said the priest in their charge
[1:33:06] is to listen God
[1:33:09] and encourage them through this in this
[1:33:12] the service of the house of the Lord and
[1:33:14] said unto the Levi said taught all
[1:33:16] Israel which were holy unto the Lord put
[1:33:19] the holy Ark in the house which Solomon
[1:33:21] the son of David King of Arrow did build
[1:33:23] he shall not be burdened upon your
[1:33:25] shoulders serve now the Lord your God
[1:33:27] and His People Israel now let me just
[1:33:30] say this

[1:33:34] must Nots that's Christians sons and
[1:33:37] daughter of God we need to know
[1:33:39] we must not misplace this word
[1:33:42] we must not misinterpret this word

[1:33:48] interpreted we totally dislocated
[1:33:52] now how you gonna get back I mean I mean
[1:33:55] we we didn't have to start if you went
[1:33:57] with now I'm not saying you can't make
[1:33:59] mistakes

[1:34:03] now this man here did all these works of
[1:34:07] God now I'm talking about and and you

[1:34:26] at the last of his life he got lifted up
[1:34:29] and wanted to go into the temple and
[1:34:31] serve incense instead of the priests so
[1:34:34] if you if you if you're a minister
[1:34:36] praise God but make sure you are
[1:34:39] because if you're a minister God gave
[1:34:41] you a message

[1:38:01] face from him
[1:38:02] he got to where he if he wanted to make
[1:38:05] war he'd make war he didn't consult God
[1:38:08] he's like David David or what David do

[1:41:22] 127. and multiply I mean just adding
[1:41:25] this that uh 90
[1:41:29] to 27.
[1:41:31] 37. see how many years she live
[1:41:34] could that be now listen I don't know
[1:41:36] this
[1:41:38] but he said if you obey your parents
[1:41:40] you'll live alone with me sir
[1:41:45] got a liar
[1:41:47] could that be what listen Abraham went
[1:41:49] on and married another woman had a bunch
[1:41:51] of kids
[1:41:52] I just wonder I just I wonder about that
[1:41:54] I wonder about things like everyone I
[1:41:56] mean no disrespect I mean you know we
[1:41:59] all I hope I can just read this real
[1:42:01] quick
[1:42:02] then I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[1:42:04] Spirit to give us Revelation or we fail
[1:42:07] to get it
[1:42:08] right it won't take just ordinary study
[1:42:10] and thinking to make the book is going
[1:42:12] to take the operation of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:14] that means this book can't be revealed
[1:42:16] to anyone but a special class of people
[1:42:18] it would require ability to hear from
[1:42:21] God now we ain't just talked about
[1:42:22] property God we talking about all of us
[1:42:26] the prophet has come and he did his job
[1:42:29] and now we're in the voice of the
[1:42:31] seventh angel which is Jesus Christ that
[1:42:34] was in him that delivered to birth the
[1:42:36] message
[1:42:38] but a special class of people it would
[1:42:40] require to hear from God it would
[1:42:42] require Supernatural instruction
[1:42:45] not just a student comparing verse with
[1:42:47] verse though that is good
[1:42:49] but if mystery requires the teaching of
[1:42:52] the spirit or it never becomes clear
[1:42:54] right
[1:42:55] we got to have see every the five-fold
[1:42:58] ministry is every one of them is I have
[1:43:01] to teach
[1:43:01] I don't remember that maybe that ain't
[1:43:03] the way to say it but they ain't a
[1:43:05] teacher
[1:43:06] they they can teach the word right and
[1:43:09] and then do it and go I mean but there's
[1:43:12] a teacher
[1:43:13] now I got my I got my ideas just like
[1:43:15] everybody else you know
[1:43:17] I see them
[1:43:25] I'm getting ready to
[1:43:28] I got so many things here
[1:43:30] God I want to do it now notice no matter
[1:43:34] trying to do God of service uh page 248
[1:43:38] 108. notice no matter how sincere A man
[1:43:41] may be no matter how great he's used of
[1:43:44] God
[1:43:46] listen no matter what he is he must be
[1:43:49] this
[1:43:50] see speaking of must be timely by the
[1:43:53] Bible what Moses said back there know
[1:43:55] what Moses did but that's not what God's
[1:43:57] doing today right
[1:43:58] what's he doing today it must be the
[1:44:01] Scripture it must be in season thirdly
[1:44:04] it must be according to the way God's
[1:44:06] word spoke it would be
[1:44:11] okay Oneness with God
[1:44:14] this is on volume 17 number 4 63 11 27.
[1:44:18] now this is something to consider this
[1:44:21] was back in 63 said this it may be
[1:44:25] almost past filling time see
[1:44:28] because there will come a time like that
[1:44:30] when the spirit of God will be with
[1:44:32] taken from the Earth
[1:44:34] there will be no more now this that this
[1:44:37] needs to explain it
[1:44:39] the church will remain a while third
[1:44:42] pool
[1:44:43] there's a part of the third pull the
[1:44:44] preaching to the totally lost that's
[1:44:45] going on now it's been wrong
[1:44:47] they're gonna but he just opened into
[1:44:49] word
[1:44:50] say they ain't going to receive it why
[1:44:53] why why why if somebody's got the word
[1:44:56] say and and you keep preaching it it's
[1:44:59] going to get narrower and narrower and
[1:45:01] narrower and then I mean I don't I I
[1:45:04] just I mean I've been as accused God
[1:45:07] I've been excused
[1:45:09] accused for years of exalting my passion
[1:45:13] I said I've never done it I said that's
[1:45:16] a lie of the devil I said I have always
[1:45:18] exalted the word he preaches not the man
[1:45:22] I love the man but but I but I said I
[1:45:25] exalt the word that he preaching and I
[1:45:27] do bro wait I exalt you and where the
[1:45:30] word comes I exalted
[1:45:33] okay it may be almost past feeling times
[1:45:36] see because there will come a time like
[1:45:38] that when the spirit of God will be will
[1:45:40] take was taken from the world there
[1:45:41] would be more the church will remain a
[1:45:43] while that's right preaching because it
[1:45:46] has to preach to The Eternity loss and
[1:45:48] as every Minister did coming down
[1:45:49] through the age the last part of every
[1:45:51] Ministry preached to the total loss
[1:45:53] there will be a mission now they will
[1:45:54] preach to The Eternity loss that have
[1:45:56] refused to receive it right listen I've
[1:45:58] got
[1:45:59] churches man I used to go all the time
[1:46:03] I'm never here to I wonder why
[1:46:06] because y'all listen to me now we figure
[1:46:08] what
[1:46:10] I mean I don't know I don't know how to
[1:46:12] compromise
[1:46:14] I don't know I I don't I'm not I'm not a
[1:46:16] political
[1:46:18] yeah
[1:46:19] but there's people wiser than me I know
[1:46:21] that and and I appreciate the people
[1:46:25] uh
[1:46:28] what is it it's wonders with God uh
[1:46:31] volume 10 into
[1:46:33] 6202-11 what is it you got to get with
[1:46:36] the word get yourself killed out
[1:46:38] I'm persuaded that many of his friends
[1:46:40] have received the Holy Ghost where we
[1:46:41] just received enough holy ghost in us to
[1:46:43] make us to a place where we don't want
[1:46:45] to lie we don't want to steal we don't
[1:46:47] want to do anything but God wants to
[1:46:48] feel every fiber of his church he wants
[1:46:51] to feel your thinking he wants to feel
[1:46:53] your mind see I'm telling you don't be
[1:46:55] like Sara now please don't that's don't
[1:46:58] fall off like Sarah how can this be
[1:47:01] God said it
[1:47:03] right God said it he wants to fill up a
[1:47:06] bit of you just make you completely
[1:47:08] totally dead to yourself or to your
[1:47:10] thing just so surrendered in God till
[1:47:13] his word is living right through you you
[1:47:15] don't know nothing else but God's word
[1:47:18] just stay right with his word it is life
[1:47:20] my words alive said Jesus he placed with
[1:47:23] that with them teachers believe in the
[1:47:26] Bible prophets that say the truth that
[1:47:27] say show the same prophecy that they
[1:47:30] always did down through the age what's
[1:47:32] he done he's showing himself alive among
[1:47:35] them confirming his word his word the
[1:47:37] kingdom of God his word made Power
[1:47:42] when's the last time y'all read that
[1:47:46] I'm asking when's the last time you read
[1:47:48] it
[1:47:52] what if what if I mean I know it ain't
[1:47:55] but what what if it was a it was a
[1:47:57] Rapture going to happen in the morning
[1:48:01] you're might I wish he would
[1:48:04] but but I don't want to lose nobody
[1:48:08] no sorry I love people I love people I
[1:48:10] love that neighbor of mine I love him
[1:48:13] how much I'm gonna plant a big old long
[1:48:15] Garden up
[1:48:17] he come over he don't never come see me
[1:48:19] hardly ever but when he came over
[1:48:21] yesterday he said oh yeah by the way you
[1:48:23] mind plowing that guard and everything
[1:48:24] about four acres
[1:48:27] I said oh listen now this is my writing
[1:48:30] I'm gonna do I'm I'm coming down to end
[1:48:33] because I hate to
[1:48:34] I wrote this December 7th 2012.
[1:48:38] the six-fold mystery of his coming
[1:48:41] now Daniel 9 20 24 statue of the perfect
[1:48:45] man see that's who I see in Daily 9 24
[1:48:48] the son of man he's the one that brings
[1:48:51] that he fills us with a spirit and
[1:48:53] brings us to to the same life that he
[1:48:56] has no sin
[1:48:58] see we have received reconciliation we
[1:49:02] have to received the atonement we've
[1:49:04] done all these things and and see I
[1:49:06] believe that we are the other part
[1:49:09] the husband and wife
[1:49:11] here's a husband that will come into
[1:49:14] flesh and he give us holy spirit so we
[1:49:16] could come into flesh
[1:49:18] that's what I believe where he starts to
[1:49:20] become visible to you
[1:49:22] the headship is where what the Holy
[1:49:24] Ghost was given for
[1:49:26] for him to come visible to you now more
[1:49:29] this is my reading our mind is what is
[1:49:32] out of order with the Holy Spirit
[1:49:34] our mind is is what is out of order with
[1:49:37] the Holy Spirit he's just turning when
[1:49:41] the word comes in we can't see we can't
[1:49:43] get it stopped we can get a butt you
[1:49:45] push it and stop and that word hit right
[1:49:47] there just so he said just stay still
[1:49:49] just a minute just a moment
[1:49:52] in in his arrest her and come down
[1:49:55] see we can't we just we just got we
[1:49:57] we're tired and I don't and me too
[1:50:00] but I feel better than I did when I come
[1:50:03] our minds was out of order with the Holy
[1:50:05] Spirit this is what God wants of our own
[1:50:07] free will from the holy spirit in our
[1:50:09] soul as we have the mind of Christ his
[1:50:12] word by our own accepted his word god
[1:50:16] turns right around and brings his word
[1:50:18] back through your in my senses back into
[1:50:21] our mind is bringing it back into
[1:50:24] subjection to his word
[1:50:26] how can we listen how can we be perfect
[1:50:29] in our soul in our in our body with our
[1:50:32] brain out of whack
[1:50:34] see that's what happened
[1:50:36] when when Satan began through the Beast
[1:50:38] it was told to the Beast the east and by
[1:50:40] reason he brought her and it knocked her
[1:50:43] brain out of cadence see now people
[1:50:46] already know what I'm talking about I
[1:50:49] mean reactions and things happens from
[1:50:51] the brain
[1:50:53] so I believe God has brought a word and
[1:50:55] is here now perfecting it to bring that
[1:50:58] brain back in subjection
[1:51:00] I'm talking about subjection
[1:51:03] I said no that can't never be okay sir
[1:51:07] I mean God God can do anything
[1:51:10] God can do anything right
[1:51:13] his word back through you and my senses
[1:51:15] called and he's bringing it back to its
[1:51:17] subjection to his word this is called
[1:51:20] the washing of the Water by the word
[1:51:21] Ephesians 5 26 this light here as Christ
[1:51:25] as a Christian is like walking through
[1:51:27] mud now y'all are excited for that but
[1:51:29] you know sometimes it feels like we
[1:51:31] dragging
[1:51:32] he says we get weighed down and fall
[1:51:35] down but as a word is the holy spirit
[1:51:37] that keeps bringing our mind back to
[1:51:39] what Adam and Eve lost remember brother
[1:51:41] Brown said what the people needs is our
[1:51:44] brains baptized are brought into the
[1:51:46] same thought as the holy spirit in our
[1:51:48] soul
[1:51:49] and then I got a I got a bunch of them
[1:51:51] in here Moses Joshua Abraham three
[1:51:54] Hebrew children the Lord appeared to
[1:51:56] them
[1:51:59] the Lord would identify with him Daniel
[1:52:02] went into the lion's den guess who
[1:52:05] brought him out
[1:52:07] Moses seen him
[1:52:09] walk with him talk with him and he
[1:52:12] denied the Holy Spirit like me and you
[1:52:13] have
[1:52:15] Abraham
[1:52:17] God
[1:52:19] we could just keep going on and on I can
[1:52:22] say way Dale Sam Dale Vermont riddicks
[1:52:26] Mr Gail I give you saved bro Donnie
[1:52:29] Susan I can say
[1:52:31] I believe it
[1:52:33] but uh
[1:52:36] Satan chose a mind to destroy to destroy
[1:52:39] the flesh this is where he keeps you in
[1:52:42] a state of confusion
[1:52:43] all the time trying to to Blind you from
[1:52:48] what God has already said
[1:52:52] you all tired
[1:52:55] hey
[1:53:00] the last enemy destroyed his death we
[1:53:03] must stop Satan with the full complete
[1:53:05] word
[1:53:06] now he will keep coming against us but I
[1:53:10] believe his effects will be stopped
[1:53:12] right and that's where I got first Peter
[1:53:14] down there see after you have purified
[1:53:16] yourself right I'm telling you this is
[1:53:20] this is a journey
[1:53:22] of perfection
[1:53:24] but he says you don't get perfect
[1:53:27] what I suffer right
[1:53:29] you don't get character you don't get
[1:53:31] the nature of God when I suffered now we
[1:53:33] don't
[1:53:35] say we want to suffer but we're by now
[1:53:39] I'll tell you God can give me a
[1:53:40] revelation of this right here and I
[1:53:42] guarantee before I get home and be
[1:53:44] testified
[1:53:46] I'll be tested by him
[1:53:52] I'm coming down
[1:53:58] my goodness I found my notes
[1:54:02] I see them
[1:54:06] I will do that to you I'm fixing to
[1:54:09] close but uh but I will say this right
[1:54:11] here it's on the greatest battle
[1:54:13] it's one of the greatest messages I
[1:54:16] believe without the Revelation this
[1:54:17] right here and marriage and divorce I
[1:54:19] don't say I know where we come to his
[1:54:21] ship
[1:54:21] right we better live a step it away
[1:54:23] brother
[1:54:24] but God says I'll be with you I won't
[1:54:25] leave you I won't forsake you how you go
[1:54:28] you're going you're going to go through
[1:54:29] some battles I mean and some of them's
[1:54:31] going to be really hard and it's been
[1:54:32] hard for me
[1:54:33] but say I'm still here by the grace of
[1:54:36] God he has tried his best to stop me and
[1:54:38] not well you all know it or not he's
[1:54:40] tried to stop y'all
[1:54:43] listen
[1:54:46] now we see backyard if we want to open
[1:54:48] it open up our channels then if we can
[1:54:49] see we find this one that this one and
[1:54:52] that one thousands of them testify but
[1:54:55] the devil will try to come right back
[1:54:57] see if he could get in there at all he's
[1:55:00] got your arm around it if he now listen
[1:55:02] what he's saying if he can get there
[1:55:04] you've got to hope so you got to hold to
[1:55:06] it I've been sit down until until I
[1:55:09] couldn't say no but God I love you
[1:55:11] I love you Lord I believe you I've
[1:55:14] always believed you Lord I said if I go
[1:55:16] to the ground I go I go say and I God
[1:55:18] why you were your stripes I'm Healed
[1:55:20] I ain't going to the ground I don't
[1:55:22] believe it so what if you do I said well
[1:55:24] I just get up for you will
[1:55:26] if you've got if you've got your senses
[1:55:28] see taste feel smell in here they're all
[1:55:31] right but don't trust him unless they
[1:55:33] agree with the word see this is
[1:55:35] important this is so important
[1:55:39] they're all right but if they disagree
[1:55:41] with the word don't you listen to them
[1:55:43] I'm telling these senses memory reason
[1:55:45] infection uh reason and Imagination
[1:55:48] don't listen to him if it's continuous
[1:55:51] words say God that ain't you so you've
[1:55:54] got to know the word
[1:55:55] to know to fight and combat that that's
[1:55:59] why I'm talking about the desperation
[1:56:01] now imaginations conscious memories
[1:56:03] reason affections they're all right if
[1:56:05] they agree with the word but if your
[1:56:07] affection doesn't agree with word get
[1:56:09] rid of it you blow a free or flu flew
[1:56:12] right quick so your reason disagrees
[1:56:14] with the word get away from me that's
[1:56:16] right if your memory and your
[1:56:17] imagination will consciously anything
[1:56:19] disagree with that
[1:56:20] when God can get a man in his hands I
[1:56:23] want you to listen to this will you
[1:56:25] believe it or not I'm telling you uh but
[1:56:27] I would believe what what God Said and
[1:56:30] when he says is anything too hard for
[1:56:32] the Lord now he's going to keep his
[1:56:34] promise
[1:56:36] he says when God can get a man in his
[1:56:39] hands till he can get senses conscious
[1:56:43] everything cleaned out
[1:56:48] yeah we believe it
[1:56:50] until it stands with God behind it in
[1:56:54] the spirit there is not a devil the
[1:56:56] world can poke it out in there now do
[1:56:58] you say he just say you ain't gonna he
[1:57:00] ain't gonna keep coming at you but he
[1:57:02] can't polka dot in your Revelation go to
[1:57:04] Revelation I mean Revelation 6 and a
[1:57:07] fourth uh fourth seal there and see what
[1:57:09] his name is he's given the name death we
[1:57:12] have got to quit fearing Satan see faith
[1:57:16] is not made perfect in fear right
[1:57:18] because we fear about our bodies We Fear
[1:57:20] we're going to lose this we're going no
[1:57:22] no no we don't don't do like job done he
[1:57:26] what he feared come on him we got to get
[1:57:29] away from that we learn from these
[1:57:31] people
[1:57:33] and if you come around and say you don't
[1:57:35] feel any better your conscience has even
[1:57:37] gone to that the fluids go so clear his
[1:57:39] shouts Hallelujah I just I heard Samson
[1:57:41] I've heard others do
[1:57:43] the olive blows a whistle glory to God
[1:57:45] it sounds just as clean and clear for
[1:57:47] the word of God to go through the power
[1:57:48] of God that's there's your Battleground
[1:57:50] your bag your belly your Battleground is
[1:57:53] back at the beginning back in the soul
[1:57:55] back in your mind that opens the mind is
[1:57:57] a gate to the soul the gate to the
[1:57:59] spirit rather your mind opens up and
[1:58:01] accept the spirit or rejects it the
[1:58:03] spirit
[1:58:05] you're mine right
[1:58:07] right so it's got something to do with
[1:58:09] it but he can't save you but I'll tell
[1:58:11] you where he can he could he could God
[1:58:13] can if you want it God can open it and
[1:58:16] that word will come right down amen into
[1:58:17] that soul
[1:58:19] you can have a little conscious little
[1:58:21] feelings a little Sensational it has
[1:58:22] nothing to do with it that's just a
[1:58:24] little Sensational your mind either
[1:58:26] accepts it or rejects it
[1:58:28] let none of them miss it it's your mind
[1:58:31] that opens the door or closes the door
[1:58:33] and listen to your conscience listen to
[1:58:35] your memory listen to your affection let
[1:58:37] me tell you something if you've got the
[1:58:38] baptism Holy Ghost now now I'm saying
[1:58:42] The Sinner does all this I mean that's
[1:58:43] that's day number sinner but now we make
[1:58:46] mistakes
