[0:00] thank you your job um it was too
[0:06] interesting it'll close up do we need to
[0:10] rewind now you're by far over not
[0:12] restart that anointing brother well yes
[0:14] big everything yet so I watched son of
[0:18] man stand upon a fee and i will speak
[0:21] unto thee and the spirit entered me i
[0:25] have got it the spirit entered me to
[0:28] watch but now watch this let's go to the
[0:30] Ezekiel three more over said to me son
[0:33] of man eat that now fight now what is
[0:34] this this is God speaking alright but
[0:37] now watch he's he kill 26 look at 26 and
[0:43] thou oh man he's talking specifically
[0:48] right there to Ezekiel yeah you got it
[0:51] little s yeah that's you and I the big s
[0:56] 0 n is Almighty God he's fixing to speak
[1:00] himself sure he's got to speaking to
[1:02] Ezekiel but right here he's saying and
[1:06] thou son of man be not afraid of them
[1:08] he'll look this son of man I ain't
[1:12] afraid of it paints the word this son of
[1:17] man isn't afraid of it but this son of
[1:21] man down here is what the one that was
[1:23] born from his ego his mom and dad you
[1:25] got that so you and I are sons and
[1:28] daughters of God right but we are a son
[1:32] of Matt we're all sons of men in flesh
[1:34] but we're son of a man and we're in
[1:37] flesh but now the son of man was God
[1:42] inhabiting this flesh not having to come
[1:45] in as my people didn't think so much
[1:48] about the River Jordan doctrine but the
[1:51] River Jordan doctrine actually separated
[1:54] the tube and made him just a little s
[1:59] uh-huh jesus never was a little is he
[2:03] was the son of man so what is decent man
[2:07] God in human flesh even as a baby he
[2:10] didn't need
[2:12] and the person he was Jesus Christ
[2:16] didn't need Redemption he came down here
[2:17] took on our sin to make us redeemable
[2:20] the man do you just blow money God get
[2:24] it near he got near Seoul cleaning out
[2:26] he didn't need his spirit cleaned out
[2:28] right but he didn't need a body change
[2:31] that's what we're working to he didn't
[2:32] need a body chain so the Son of Man is
[2:34] complete God but it's complete gone in a
[2:37] human mortal body alright same way with
[2:41] Ezekiel but now watch what he says here
[2:45] let's go back this the second what was
[2:48] the Ezekiel set to do Ezekiel was said
[2:51] to prophesy to Israel to tell Israel you
[2:56] have rejected me but I'm coming I'm
[3:01] coming as the son of man on earth to
[3:05] redeem Israel may you read all the Zika
[3:07] because remember Ezekiel 43 44 is the
[3:10] restoration of the Millennial temple so
[3:12] I think you'll really takes us right
[3:14] through into the Millennium so is he
[3:17] kill had to be not the Son of man but a
[3:20] son of man that capital son of man is
[3:23] going to speed through the spirit
[3:25] entered into me when he spake unto me
[3:27] and send me upon my feet that I heard
[3:30] him then I heard them to spoken to me
[3:33] and he said to me son of man I send thee
[3:35] to the children of Israel now who'd east
[3:37] and the children of Israel the son of
[3:38] man with children of Israel Jesus Christ
[3:41] Ezekiel couldn't save Israel that's why
[3:45] he was little ass right down there
[3:47] number six be not afraid of them they
[3:50] would be afraid of the words in other
[3:51] words what's he doing he's talking to
[3:53] the human man Ezekiel because listen
[3:57] remember they're just remember brother
[3:59] random would even when brought when God
[4:01] would speak to brother enemy he would
[4:03] question it is that you lord
[4:07] he's at you why he was a little songd
[4:13] ever did one day get up and go today did
[4:19] that man some my l know it was him that
[4:21] was the man you know I said ever seen me
[4:27] and him sure Jesus could receive thought
[4:31] like we did but he never questioned how
[4:35] many times a week listen how many times
[4:37] do we say was the Lord had told us to do
[4:39] something we did it it was just a
[4:40] complete failure I believe or I think I
[4:45] have this feeling that the Lord wants
[4:47] men do this and it's to go get all them
[4:49] you know people move off over in this
[4:51] direction and the Lord sent me up there
[4:53] well he ain't send you up here to starve
[4:55] to death didn't send you a pleasure to
[4:58] get involved doctrine you know what like
[5:00] these people that say well the Lord gave
[5:01] me this job but I got work on Sundays
[5:03] the Lord never give you a job work on
[5:06] Sunday you took a job that you needed to
[5:10] work on sunday you took yes
[5:19] that's just laugh-in so so what end so
[5:23] but jesus never I don't think Jesus ever
[5:25] walked up and went well should I knew
[5:27] that person or not I hear this voice
[5:28] telling me that no he was so in tune
[5:31] with the father he was the father made
[5:33] manifest in this flesh plane was decent
[5:36] man I swine and said I said to you jesus
[5:40] never said to us after work Ezekiel had
[5:43] to say thus said the Lord God is he too
[5:47] had to say that the mouthpiece of God
[5:49] had to say that until God Himself came
[5:51] in human flesh yeah Jesus was not only
[5:55] the mouthpiece of God he was gone to man
[5:58] seq was a mouthpiece of God that God
[6:00] used that vessel entered into that
[6:02] vessel spoke to who Israel the son of
[6:06] man cuz who's the one that condemned
[6:08] Israel when he was on earth the son of
[6:11] man he was always condemned he said o
[6:13] Israel if I if you you know i would have
[6:15] gathered you up as a in what I mean he
[6:17] only went to Israel so he went to Israel
[6:21] first though in a form of Ezekiel but
[6:24] that wasn't be some and that was a son
[6:26] of man with the son of man being in
[6:29] tight ship here to talk some man stand
[6:32] up on my feet to me when I started
[6:35] reading the zekiel after that I saw
[6:37] Jesus standing there because watch in
[6:39] Ezekiel one watch this right here memory
[6:45] had a vision right you had a vision of
[6:49] what the likeness of four creatures and
[6:53] the verse 5 and these was their
[6:57] appearance now remember we look at it
[7:02] and go live ops man and eagle right
[7:08] members lot and brother hamza within the
[7:10] box at liveops man mingle right that's
[7:13] the poor that's what he's talking about
[7:14] but what and these was their appearance
[7:18] they had the likeness of men so with a
[7:20] man hope now you wonder why I do what a
[7:24] while I'm walking out there he'll just
[7:26] beer
[7:27] God in the characterization of a lion
[7:30] the lion anointing flying LOL men that
[7:34] went what in a man in men God's always
[7:39] work through man he's never work to
[7:40] animals sure why he spoke to one with
[7:43] Balaam but he never used an animal for
[7:46] redemption except in the Old Testament
[7:47] that's what we're going to get into when
[7:50] we see what happened when Jesus said in
[7:52] Matthew 9 he talks about the Son of Man
[7:55] able to forgive sins and then if you say
[7:59] something against the Holy go why what
[8:02] seen this many right here what and
[8:04] everyone had four faces and for win now
[8:06] this is your for beef because look at
[8:10] verse 10 as for the lights our faces day
[8:14] for had the face of a man face of a lion
[8:16] face of an office face of an eagle but
[8:20] it was the appearance of a man Ezekiel
[8:24] saw a man standing everybody saw these
[8:26] spirits not spirits and evil spirits as
[8:29] the spirits of God characterizing their
[8:32] self as a line and brother branham
[8:34] explain that thank God for profit that
[8:36] would explain them the bolus of the line
[8:39] the sacrifice of the odds for the pulley
[8:42] and the eagle and demand okay but they
[8:48] all were characterized in one person
[8:50] right there verse 5 who what is that
[8:53] that was son of man Jesus Christ had all
[8:57] four of those combat beast because when
[9:01] it brother Brown take say that the
[9:02] combat beast was the only go the man so
[9:06] this man was the Holy go okay so what
[9:12] you say well it's characters I was
[9:14] characterizing the bride down to the
[9:16] church ages that's right but go to
[9:18] revelations where daddy's been reading
[9:20] her six months one lock into the Son of
[9:24] Man while all that was envelope right
[9:27] there in those seven sure changes in
[9:29] that Sun man characterization you don't
[9:33] say I want to
[9:33] because it was the characterization
[9:35] because because remember the son of man
[9:38] down through seven church ages was the
[9:41] true revelation was lost right the son
[9:46] of man started but writing the first
[9:48] church AZ said you lost your first love
[9:50] but what they lose they lost the
[9:51] revelation the son of man to me call the
[9:54] son of magnus the one who loves you God
[9:56] sure God loves you but this man right
[9:57] here said he I don't give my lap I love
[10:01] you so much I'm or die I don't have to I
[10:04] stay this man right here and just be
[10:07] just but you can't say he can't stay
[10:09] this man and how the characterization
[10:10] that he had the father healer redeemer
[10:13] saber they had to come out into this man
[10:15] right here alright son of man don't mate
[10:18] okay with that alright so here's his ETO
[10:21] talking but watch in first trying to get
[10:27] mold Bible out until they got all this
[10:28] stuff underline talks about their faces
[10:31] nice don't like the living creatures now
[10:32] we know the living creatures were
[10:33] lineups men illegal but they all were
[10:35] characterized Ezekiel turn look-sees man
[10:38] John turns to see the bride sees a man
[10:41] huh John turn see the bride you see
[10:44] there you know in that picture of the
[10:47] cloud
[10:49] anybody see the eagle wings
[10:55] oh yeah okay yep that's should have all
[10:59] been able to see that maybe we'll get a
[11:00] picture one day little shortening the
[11:02] ice on that back on the first and the
[11:04] sixties when we first started thing when
[11:06] you see that cloud manages to me it
[11:08] visualizes everything how they do away
[11:10] with it if they want to but I think was
[11:16] very important that's true so important
[11:20] that i don't think the seal going to
[11:21] open had it not been that labor of that
[11:23] come biblical fanfare jesus said the two
[11:27] angles said the way you see this man
[11:29] leave is the way you won't see him come
[11:32] and it within a cloud same way he went
[11:34] up the same way you come back down right
[11:35] in a cloud and probably if the two if
[11:39] the people would have a revelation they
[11:41] look so Jesus going up I believe you my
[11:43] seen the same formation of that cloud as
[11:47] he went up through the middle of it
[11:49] because he's the one that he's you
[11:51] wanted to get over those seals brother
[11:53] brendan o'neill Jesus eyes open sea
[11:55] alright alright so now watch this stuff
[12:00] so they got to get my old bottle here if
[12:02] I can read it with no 24
[12:12] a watch
[12:17] verse 24 and when they went I heard the
[12:19] noise of their wings like the noise of
[12:21] Greg waters what is water people has the
[12:24] voice of the all money not a different
[12:27] voice as the voice of the almighty the
[12:30] voice of speech as the noise of a hoax
[12:32] remember when join when john turned to
[12:35] see the boy SAT spoke to him he thought
[12:37] he was going to turn and see Jesus
[12:39] himself right because he remembered that
[12:42] boys from being on earth because
[12:44] remember Jesus boys didn't change
[12:45] samples so when you turn to see the boys
[12:49] the voice of the almighty the voice of
[12:52] speech as the noise of a mini not one
[12:57] when they stood they let down the wing
[12:59] so there was a voice from the firmament
[13:01] what is that cloud that was over their
[13:03] heads when they stood in let down the
[13:05] wings and above the firmament over the
[13:07] head was the lights of a throne hold on
[13:09] a minute as he parents of a semi was
[13:11] going upon the likeness of the throne
[13:14] was the likeness as the appearance of a
[13:16] man that's him that's man sitting on
[13:21] throne today and I saw as the color of
[13:26] amber parents of fire round about within
[13:28] from the appearance of his loins up and
[13:31] from the parents of his loins down and I
[13:35] salt with the parents of fire and he had
[13:36] brought this round about his appearance
[13:38] of the bow that is in the cloud of the
[13:40] day of rain want rainbow so was the
[13:43] appearance of the bride is right about
[13:44] that's revelation that's right that's
[13:48] revelations 4 5 10 all of it revelation
[13:55] 1 okay this was the appearance of the
[13:58] lightness of the glory of the Lord am I
[14:00] so I fell on my face and heard a voice
[14:02] of Wonders face and what's he going to
[14:03] do you watch this and watch it in verse
[14:07] 2 and 3 we're not going to go do it all
[14:10] because this is I just want to give you
[14:11] a little example because he said what so
[14:15] I'm asking on your feet back over here
[14:18] son of man I send thee to the children
[14:20] of the air filter a rebellious nice and
[14:22] verse 3 all right now Hoodie sent Jesus
[14:25] to
[14:26] same place right all right since the son
[14:30] of man this is the Son of Man going to
[14:32] the house of Israel verse 6 Ezekiel
[14:35] don't be afraid of them ok Ezekiel not
[14:42] the big son of man Ezekiel need to be
[14:45] afraid of their words listen the son of
[14:47] man wasn't afraid this person right here
[14:53] even in human flesh was not afraid of
[14:54] anything did he ever say I fear this er
[14:57] I fear that or I don't want to go here I
[14:59] don't want to go back he said fear not I
[15:03] and with you that was the problem with
[15:07] that first thing I said I'm afraid well
[15:10] he never been afraid before why he had
[15:13] that enmity ending them need to be
[15:16] afraid of the words in other words what
[15:17] the snot what what God's telling is
[15:19] equal is look don't be afraid of these
[15:20] people i'm with you i'm going to do the
[15:23] speaking because look verse 7 and thou
[15:26] shalt speak my words joisey kill is not
[15:29] going to go up there for centuries and
[15:31] just start talking I don't think brother
[15:33] branham come and just talk
[15:34] presumptuously he spoke the words of
[15:36] these automatic m.a.a.d words of these
[15:40] out of man ok and thou shalt speak my
[15:44] words unto them whether they were here
[15:46] are whether they will forbear for there
[15:48] are most rebellious but now son of man
[15:51] is he you'll hear what i say unto thee
[15:54] right look what happened first verse 9
[15:59] and when I look behold a handle ascend
[16:01] unto me and a little role of a book was
[16:04] there in for that book come from we're
[16:08] that revelation 10 by eight come from
[16:11] and he spread it before me and it was
[16:15] written with in and out revelations 5
[16:17] and there was written lamentations
[16:19] morning and low he's not finished more
[16:23] obese enemy son of man heat heat the
[16:27] book gone eat the books out of my son of
[16:31] man eat that belt I just eat this
[16:33] rolling go speak until the house
[16:36] of Israel so I open my mouth and he
[16:39] calls me to eat grow now look Ezekiel
[16:44] was not morning in right he was an
[16:46] anointed prophet run look what that word
[16:49] says he caused me to eat the rope now
[16:52] when you go over to John a born-again
[16:54] believer John goes over and he says
[16:56] gives me the book to the Denver in the
[17:04] Old Testament he had to be giving
[17:06] something to eat he had no words yet of
[17:08] course on the table but John being born
[17:10] again Christian he knew he needed that
[17:12] book so John if you'll revel in some ten
[17:15] John says give me the book and the angel
[17:19] says take it he's kidding okay it's mine
[17:21] in other words what it was a possession
[17:23] John had the new birth for 60 something
[17:25] years he knew that was a possession
[17:27] Ezekiel is not understanding everything
[17:29] that's going on you understand what I'm
[17:31] saying them telling prophets in the Old
[17:32] Testament sometimes did not understand
[17:34] what they were doing because they were
[17:36] born again they didn't have something
[17:37] inside of them to click on what they
[17:39] were saying they were literally just a
[17:41] mouse people God but now they'll be
[17:45] given eternal life yourself you know
[17:46] they're not something to throw away all
[17:48] right but they were not even in your
[17:53] situation not as great as you the least
[17:58] in the kingdom is greater than John and
[18:00] John was the greatest of the prophets
[18:03] yeah hello one more time jesus said
[18:07] that's what the man said the big ass
[18:10] told us one day he said the least in the
[18:13] kingdom what about to the home the
[18:15] police in the kingdom is greater than
[18:17] John and John was the greatest of all
[18:19] prophets hey man what he said so that's
[18:23] why all these prophets are prophesying
[18:25] and God would open up something for them
[18:28] to see like I believe as eco saw Jesus
[18:30] Christ when he saw all the way to mill
[18:33] the wheel and all that coming down with
[18:34] the four creatures had two pairs of man
[18:36] he went look at it Joe you know John
[18:38] Henry he was looking at
[18:40] Jesus right but Jesus was not manifested
[18:43] in the flesh yet one prominent we get
[18:48] what was talking about anyway I watched
[18:50] look at this absolutely go with
[18:53] revelations 10 verse 3 and he said to me
[18:55] son of man cause my belly to eat and
[18:58] fill their bowels with this role that I
[19:00] give thee then I didn't did I eat it and
[19:03] it was in my mouth honey sweet right
[19:06] what John say John said his head my
[19:10] mouth sweet as honey sweet you know but
[19:12] in my belly it was better what John had
[19:14] a living all right let's see if you did
[19:18] cuz Eagle doesn't say anything about it
[19:21] being better John had to go live it and
[19:27] he said unto me son of man go get the
[19:29] end of the house of Israel and speak
[19:31] with my words unto them all right so
[19:35] everybody that this is prefigure of the
[19:37] son of man be Son of Man prefigured with
[19:40] Ezekiel going to the Israel and his
[19:44] rules going to do what what Israel do
[19:46] does equal turns him down and he
[19:48] pronounces judgment same thing when
[19:50] Jesus did Jesus went to one he went to
[19:52] his own in his own received him not
[19:54] right but many that did they became what
[19:58] sons of God which isn't what the
[20:00] Gentiles us want to receive him in our
[20:02] soul but the house of Israel turned him
[20:05] down for thou art sent to a people of
[20:06] strange speech and hard language but are
[20:09] not sent to people with strange feature
[20:11] partly know where he went sent people
[20:13] that didn't know who's eat you up he was
[20:16] sent to the house of Israel alright and
[20:18] then it goes on through and we can go
[20:22] through a lot of that but let's go to
[20:25] Ezekiel 12
[20:38] and we go this is the same thing come
[20:40] back look somebody first two fishes they
[20:44] said in the main son of man these are
[20:47] the men that divides miss you can give
[20:48] week account from this city which I say
[20:50] is not near let us build houses cities
[20:52] to kill them you deflect there for a
[20:54] prophesy against them prophets also
[20:56] immensely the son of man is talking to
[20:58] the Ezekiel look at the Capitol and then
[21:03] look at the little ever the Spirit of
[21:06] the Lord fell upon me every time that
[21:08] you see that capitalist on a man and you
[21:10] see the little son of man you'll see as
[21:12] eq late to come in in other words the
[21:14] Spirit came into me or the Spirit fell
[21:16] upon me and send to me watch speak thus
[21:19] after or now look these on a man doesn't
[21:22] have saved us therefore is or but he's
[21:27] telling Ezekiel you say what I'm telling
[21:29] you to say thus saith the Lord this is
[21:32] what's going to happen to you right
[21:33] that's why bit that we got to be real
[21:36] careful when we start saying the staff
[21:38] the Lord 90 brother Ram Singh will have
[21:42] thus says the Lord and be still but
[21:44] remember the bride's don't have to be
[21:45] able to speak in the first person not

[21:54] this adoption stage okay this adoption
[21:57] stage it's not crying daddy daddy where
[22:00] are now now this is the day doing the
[22:03] speaking because this was the son of man
[22:05] right bring it back what we've been
[22:08] talking about this is the son of man
[22:10] this whole section / command is decent
[22:12] man sorry the headstone that's why
[22:15] that's why they didn't realize what the
[22:17] Sun man was cuz man took this away
[22:19] creeds and dogmas took what the son of
[22:23] man out of the picture but it was the
[22:26] son of God down to seven church ages
[22:28] they put people in the body yeah the son
[22:33] of man got to come back in the same
[22:34] powers when you alone here
[22:35] the first part on our first time okay so
[22:40] are we so I want to ask you a question
[22:42] right now are we the little som or the
[22:48] biggest hope when we give is a body
[22:56] chain
[23:02] remember the little xon was Ezekiel the
[23:05] person the big somn is Jesus Christ
[23:11] we're little adèle that's correct that's
[23:14] why brother Brown said I am a son of man
[23:18] revealing be sentimental when be some
[23:21] amends reveal what is it he dropped back
[23:23] in yet he never left you it's a
[23:27] revelation he's revealing to you than
[23:30] had I've been this big guy it was you
[23:33] know ever since the beginning of time
[23:34] you know our beginning of the church
[23:36] ages but you have made yourself the
[23:39] little som you made yourself that right
[23:45] but he wants us to realize because
[23:48] remember little xon never goodbye Kane
[23:53] is he killing everything buddy tonight
[23:55] okay that's right this man did this is
[23:59] where the body changes gotta come from
[24:00] this man's got to be back in power not
[24:03] the little X 0 ends that's my whole
[24:04] point now you give me about five minutes
[24:06] let's go to 99 and we'll see what this
[24:09] stuff question is that Jesus is talking
[24:12] about the one we're going to get back
[24:14] and talk more on the son of man because
[24:16] it's very important they might
[24:20] understand this whole pretense he is
[24:23] that the son of God the Son of God is
[24:27] the new birth in your soul put you in
[24:30] the kingdom push you in the body of
[24:31] Christ make sure you creature a new
[24:34] creation makes you part of a bride makes
[24:36] you part of the family of God but that's
[24:40] no guarantee that your body is going to
[24:42] be changed without dead you're one
[24:44] saying them because it will be change
[24:46] but change without death the only time
[24:50] you're gonna have change without death
[24:51] is this right here okay sons of God have
[24:56] died since the first church age right
[24:58] all right but when I son of man
[25:01] resurrected ain't never saw a man died
[25:04] but that big ass right thing
[25:06] no way because remember he said I'm
[25:09] alive forevermore when he stood down on
[25:11] earth he was the son of man when he come
[25:13] out of that grave that flesh was made
[25:15] eternal all right yes miss Reed if I
[25:24] skip Daniel 7 will go back to Daniel
[25:27] next Sunday Matthew 96 but then you may
[25:33] know now what'd he do he forgave this
[25:35] person of his sins sick of palsy lying
[25:38] on a bed seeing their faith said of the
[25:41] sink and Paul this son be able to cheer
[25:42] thy sins be forgiven thee right
[25:45] certainly the scribe says this man
[25:47] blessing Jesus knowing their thoughts
[25:49] should wear for think he evil in your
[25:51] heart for weather is easier to say thy
[25:53] sins be forgiven they are say rise along
[25:56] but that you may know that the Son of
[25:59] Man calculus always jump the west wing
[26:04] talks about him hath power on earth to
[26:06] forgive sin then he said to the sick of
[26:08] Paul do you rise take up the bed I'm
[26:11] going to the house all right so now
[26:13] let's go to now Matthew chapter 12 the
[26:21] brutal get back to Matthew 17 in a
[26:24] little while
[26:28] Matthew 12 verse 32 right then we're
[26:33] going to read the quote
[26:39] work why that's 31 wherefore I say in
[26:41] the old matter of sin if blasphemy shall
[26:43] be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy
[26:45] against the Holy Ghost shall not be
[26:46] forgiven unto man and one whosoever
[26:49] speaketh the word against the son of man
[26:52] he shall be forgiven him but whosoever
[26:55] speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall
[26:57] not be forgiven neither in this world of
[27:00] the world to come now look he'll make
[27:03] the tree good and his fruit good or else
[27:05] make the tree corrupting his fruit crud
[27:07] when the tree is known by a scrutiny
[27:09] talks about the people generation about
[27:11] it what in this scenario what is Jesus
[27:14] saying he said alright I have the one
[27:17] inside of me that forgive right you can
[27:21] speak against me but come on flesh man
[27:24] does the flesh was given remembering
[27:27] will try to break it down when I finish
[27:29] with some my number getting started and
[27:31] Isaiah says he gave his soul ransom he
[27:34] didn't give his flesh of his flesh was
[27:37] the sacrifice just like the flesh of a
[27:39] lamb the flesh was a sacrifice the soul
[27:42] was real offering that was what was
[27:45] encased inside this flesh a man but you
[27:50] won't you can't separate them to have
[27:52] guns in their use some bad that's the
[27:56] son of man all right now but what he
[27:58] says the Holy Ghost shall not be
[28:00] forgiving of the men that what they do
[28:01] some men were talking to Jesus to person
[28:05] some called him a wine-bibber they say
[28:07] you'd run around with prostitutes and
[28:08] publicans and all that you said wash
[28:10] blasphemy no that was talking my command
[28:12] Jesus right he said but you speak
[28:15] against the Holy Ghost now what does he
[28:17] do he goes on further and what did they
[28:19] say they said this man makes himself God
[28:23] now what they're doing what they're
[28:25] saying is they here have this anything
[28:27] but that was the works of what this man
[28:30] was right so what brother Brown say
[28:32] let's turn to
[28:33] go to the barrel in a second we would
[28:39] find it real quick I left this new
[28:45] format here they'll have their kind of
[28:48] tag again I will eventually i will write
[28:51] here jesus said while they're going to
[28:56] earth they brought him one day a bunch
[28:57] of men they said he cast out devils new
[28:59] bells above the pencil devils jesus said
[29:01] you can speak a word against the son of
[29:03] man will be forgiven but this rebel
[29:05] speaking at the word against the Holy
[29:06] Ghost will not be forgiven him in this
[29:07] world of the world come whosoever
[29:09] speaketh against the holy gospel they
[29:11] were calling see the atonement the blood
[29:14] cell as I'll get to after a bit was not
[29:16] burst yet so it could be forgiven then
[29:23] it was forgiven under the blood of bulls
[29:26] and goats right she just was still
[29:30] standing there under the law they were
[29:32] still making sacrifices he was telling
[29:33] them to go max hyperposite so their sins
[29:36] could be forgiven under the blood of
[29:38] bulls and goats but so it could be
[29:42] forgiven them the Holy Ghost had not yet
[29:44] pierced itself from this blood cell but
[29:47] after once coming from there it's the
[29:50] unpardonable so when Jesus came back
[29:55] going to bed Pentecost and that Holy
[29:56] Ghost entered entered into the peter
[29:58] paul james and all over nepal the peter
[30:00] james and john hall them you speak
[30:03] against that you'll not be forgiven I
[30:06] stopped strong that is look at the bride
[30:08] of Jesus Christ that's why that's why
[30:12] that if you say it's the brother Brown
[30:14] City you say off for gave Sam remember
[30:16] him that lady acting said you forgive
[30:19] them people their sins he said there's
[30:20] not far from the truth in other words
[30:23] what he was saying inside yourself was
[30:24] yeah that's what happened but he wasn't
[30:26] gonna give it a war ii to itself he
[30:29] wasn't gonna do that but that's what he
[30:30] did but why did he do it though he had
[30:35] the Holy Ghost inning the Holy Ghost was
[30:37] one getting people way around couldn't
[30:39] forgive me anybody
[30:40] but the Holy Ghost through the filter of
[30:42] a problem is a new testament prophet
[30:44] could tell those people your sins are
[30:46] forgiven but now look he didn't forgive
[30:49] them of their sins and then let him do
[30:50] whatever they want to do remember when
[30:52] he told him he said don't you ever
[30:53] whatever you've done don't ever
[30:56] duplicate that in other words don't ever
[30:57] do that again if your step what out the
[31:01] reason I look at this as managing
[31:02] divorce if you're sitting there and
[31:04] you're single I mean I'm single but
[31:07] divorced and you're separated from your
[31:09] wife you can reconcile with your wife
[31:11] but you can't go back somebody else just
[31:14] go she said you're free there's a lot of
[31:16] stipulations in Bobby's a lot of things
[31:18] involved with marriage and divorce there
[31:19] honey you're going to get into maybe
[31:21] later i will get into but we won't get
[31:22] into it now but that's the reason that
[31:24] the son of man you speak against him
[31:27] because that holy ghost was inside that
[31:29] man but it had not been burst yeah so
[31:33] they were covered under the blood will
[31:34] windows but now when the day pet coughs
[31:38] come I was it went bulls and goats
[31:41] anymore it was that holy ghost in those
[31:44] people those remember Peter cold and I
[31:46] since the fire he said you have what
[31:49] spoken against not Peter he said you've
[31:51] spoken against the Holy go so they were
[31:55] forgiven well they were they were killed
[31:57] let's go home was I got some more next
[31:59] ended Lord will
[32:03] you
