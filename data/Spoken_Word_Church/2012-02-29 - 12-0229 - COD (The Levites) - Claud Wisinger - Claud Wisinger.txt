remember now the Bible study Saturday uh the topic is the millenniums will come and be just discuss that amen you fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday in March and pray that we'd all be the announcement will be made later I've called a brother and giving me a little time to wait just wants to commit himself to it later you know so without somebody will be speaking so okay not to worry about it amen so let's just say Open the Eyes of My Heart that's what I thought of guns most of you know him so you don't have to be introducers to it right right now one easy Open the Eyes of My Heart foreign holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy oh you see hey man God bless each and every one of you it's good to be here tonight uh so if you don't like what I preached blame brother Wade how's that yeah I told him I was coming to Florida for a couple of weeks just to get in the Sun and relax it's been a real tough year back home uh I basically I retired last February remodeled the entire house that me and him to live in went through every room completely redid it and then we decided to buy a church about the time I finished with the house we bought a new church and we had to it used to be a garment Factory is what it was but before that like 30 years before that it was a church right and so it still had the baptistry still had the pastor's office and still had the stage was there and so we got such a good deal on it it was actually honestly it was a miracle that we could get it I told the church two years ago it was the church we were in was getting it was small and we just needed a better facility we've been there for 45 years and I told them I started telling them we need to get a new church I said not if there's anything wrong this but you know it's not the buildings and the nails it's just to make it comfortable have something a little more modern for the people be able to we never had a cry room so when the babies you know start crying whoever sat next to that person was unable to hear the message and so uh I told him two years ago that we really need to look at getting to church finally we voted that that would that's what we all wanted to do we started looking for a church and you know what we didn't have any money to buy a church we had no money I just felt I felt that that was the leadership of the Holy Ghost that we needed to have a new church so what we did uh uh this church come up means either sing it A friend of Irish a real estate agent in town he told us that well we got this one church but he says it's pretty bad shape so Ginger told me she said well let's go look at it I said okay let's go look at it so went over there looked at it when you walked in the door you just knew it was right you know what I mean it just it was right I could just feel that it was right but anyway we would have had 25 000 to put down we didn't have 25 000. we did not have it and so finally I called the realtor I said I'll tell you what if I give you a 25 000 letter of a write-off to say I'll give him 25 show that he gave 25 000 toward the purchase because he's he's wanting so much so we took and he did it and that was our down payment so I went to the bank and I told the bank I said uh well we you know we want to buy this church and so the bank said well how much do how much do they want for it and I told him he said how much are you going to pay for it and it was 25 000 left he made me he didn't charge me a dime and then they told us at the club the thing he said now when we close on this it's going to cost you around the realtor had figured it up yeah and he said it's gonna cost you 5 000 at the time in the closing we went to the closing me and my wife and they wrote us an 800 and some dollar check this is not right you know but this is God is what it is we were going to take every penny that we had to remodel the church so you know what it allowed us to do since we didn't have to have the down payment things we were able to go ahead and get into church uh and we had our weeknight service in it on January 1st and it was a real real blessing it really was so uh God's still Miracle work now yeah I can tell you that but for me it's been a little hard working on a house working on a church preaching three times a week you know how it goes and uh but we we've got we've accomplished a lot at Bartlesville and things are really good doing good for us so uh just continue to pray for us we're a simple people uh but you know what we love the Lord with all of our hearts behind the stream and you know what we're in the final part of this thing and we need to start pushing you know Paul said that we need to press toward the mark on the high calling in Christ Jesus if there's ever a time you need to press right right okay don't set on your laurels and think everything things gonna be okay that's right because the bride does have something to do that's right you're supposed to make yourself ready right amen the bride hath made herself ready is that right so there is something you need to do okay let's return to the scripture and read and I've been actually teaching a series uh when I first started ministering brother Samuel and brother Wade both were a real help to me and I told him I said I don't know how you guys do a series you know well I'm now on the 50th sermon out of cod so it's it's it's not how you do it just God works again it's a gift that does it okay so anyway let's go to Genesis 5 and 24 if you would we'll start with some simple scriptures and I try to show you something and uh I preached four sermons out of this this subject I'm going to bring tonight hopefully I can we'll get through it okay and I hope not to hold you too long because I know Wednesday nights I know how hard it is on your body Genesis 5 and 24 and Enoch Enoch was the seventh from Adam right we're the seventh Church age so we're going to take a rapture all right right and eat off the wall walk you know what walk to us this man are alive right Enoch had a conda right he had a manner of life right he walked with God and he was not for God took him right is that right let's go to Hebrews 11 and 5 now foreign Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation does everybody understand that before he got raptured out that's right he had this testimony you know what the word testimony means good report right see you're not going to get to heaven God say Well done my good and faithful servant if you haven't done good right and that word faithful means full of faith is that right so you gotta understand that Enoch please God and it was this testimony that pleased God Amen he walked he walked the walk do you understand that he had a good report before God and you know what that he pleased God Amen so if you're going to take a Rapture as Enoch did you're going to have a good report right is that right false report but a good report right let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you for the reading the word Lord I pray that I'll get myself out of the way and may you come and minister to the hearts of this people oh God lord we understand in this end time there's no great ones Among Us it's just you Lord you're the one that we looked forward to Lord look toward so be with us and break this down for the people Lord and is Christ's name we ask it amen we might be seated you have that chart right there you can put up God's good too amen I got a little church all the time I said don't get nervous I'm not nervous you know uh my brother Jess our old Pastor passed away now I used to watch him in the Pulpit when you think of Bible it'll keep you going like this he does but everybody see that okay yeah okay everybody understands the the Church age or the conduct order and Doctrine book are 23 messages that someone I believe it might have been Roy borders put together is that right right 23 messages and they believe that in these 23 messages and I don't really I'm not going to argue the fact I believe they're right that the conduct the order and the doctrine of the church just stated in those 23 messages yeah that fair to say right that's what they did this is what I did so we always call it the church right is that what we always say right we go Church conduct order and Doctrine right yeah amen you know three everything's perfected in three years does everybody agree with that amen so you've got conduct you got order and you got Doctrine right so I preached a message and I say you know really we're not church anymore we're Pride amen so I X this out okay let's get rid of that is that right let's go brag right so this is in order for you to be perfect can I just tell you this you got to have your contacts you got to have your order you gotta have your doctor and that's how you're going to be made that's how you're going to be like Enoch where you walk you have a manner of life that is pleasing to God all right is that right and that's your responsibility as being a bride member you need to walk the walk you need to walk a walk to where you absolutely are pleasing to God Almighty amen right is that right now this is what most people have in the message of the hour well yeah does everybody agree that right you know Paul said you can know all the Mysteries exactly hey you don't have love right you're like a symbol you just make a lot of noise is that right what we got around the message is a lot of noise we got a lot of people that know the doctrine I have people in in my church I'll be honest with you they say I believe the message and they live none of it that's right amen you know brother random said your life speaks louder than your words exactly that's what he said he said if you don't live it you don't believe it right right so you know what you can tell you can talk to me all you want tell me how much you believe this message but if you don't your manner alive is not according to all these right here you bear false witness right right did you know that then you're bearing false witness there's a sermon if you go through conduct order Doctrine run up said your life interprets this message right the word does everybody understand that right though everyday life that you live brother is what interprets it so if there's one quote in this message that you're that you don't live up to right then you misinterpreted amen exactly you know on that day you're going to be held accountable for misinterpreting the word you can quote it all you want but if you don't put some flesh on that club see we believe in the son of man ministry right we believe we're Ace on a man just like brother Branham was revealing the son of man is that right will you say you're a son a man which is a word made flesh I believe that but if your men are alive is not according to this message your life is speaking louder than your words your confession has no weight with me you understand your confession don't scare the devil one bit exactly but when you get down where the rubber meets the road and you live a life yeah amen then that scares you because you know what that life is an interpretation of this message amen that we say we believe so you can find out go read conduct daughter and Doctrine and see if you really believe the message of that can I say it that way exactly now I know that's tough you know the thing about a pastor that's a harder you know when you're and I know most of you some of your parents here anyway what you'll say the hardest thing you do is with your children all right you know that's what a pastor's job is right yeah I had somebody in the church the other day this sister she goes and she said we got a fellowship Paul now which has been real good for us but she's back here and saying well I told my kids that when they reached 17 years old they can do what they want to do they're old enough to make their own decision show me that in the message would somebody help me and show me it don't matter if your daughter's 40 years old if she lives with you under the token amen you don't let her come in your house living dirty Billy Paul came up to the house one day smoking a cigarette right he walks up here and he puts it out on the fence post he goes up to the door and brother bam standing there he said Paul you can't live here doing that all right why brother Branham applied the token on the house so this sister said you know when they're 17 they're old enough that you'll make and you know what she's got several kids and most of them are wearing pants and living with them do you know the neighbors going to see them kids walking in the house and after you've told them we don't believe in women wear pants and not cutting their hair you're allowing your kids to do it right see your life speaks louder than your world and when I and I got up from the church I said okay in the days of Paul does everybody understand the Antichrist Spirit went out amen you know brother bear said the Antichrist Spirit was a saying that went out right exactly so that sister was that was a saying that she as a pastor I was obligated so she cast it out over the in the fellowship hall everybody there I got the pulpit I said show me that I'll show you where brother Branham said that sister when your husband's away You're the pastor of the house right what would you do if this man was pastor this church okay and all his children come in wearing pants yeah wouldn't you talk to them wouldn't you blow it out and tell them you can't do that right you were raised under this message you know better you can't come here like that wouldn't you say that right well she's the pastor of the home and she's going to let that 17 year old kid make a decision right you know and and when when you pray I looked at when he preached on Two Souls which I'll I'll tell you it was wonderful amen I enjoyed it I mean I I thoroughly I enjoyed that message that he preached okay but do you know that if brother Graham said if you'll take a child and you won't do nothing with it you won't correct him or not corrected you do nothing that that child will pervert because why wrong birth amen the child's birth is wrong in the first place he's going to go wrong is that right and that's the point he was making what is it it was got perverted right but through our new birth it's converted not perverted is that right so when I did I had to preach that over the congregation I knew the sister was there but you know what being a pastor I have to correct it right because why that's a saying that when it went through the church somebody would have heard that and said you know what when my kid gets 17 I'm gonna let him do that right and you may say well brother Clyde you really be no I'm not that's what Paul was getting out when he said these sayings went out right is that right it was just simple things that you say that you can't find in a message you better quit saying it right better get your get your doctor order and you've been all lined up is that right no I believe in Doctrine I'll be honest with you I preach the doctrine of the message all right man brother Graham said the doctrine is the Bark on a tree if you don't have the bark on the tree the life will run out exactly so is the doctor an important yes but what we've got is a lot of people in the message that's got the doctrine and no conductor do you know if you don't have order the opposite of orders is that right if you don't have a conduct of it why like I say you you've seen people I mean you've seen women wear heels like that oh yeah you've seen all these things but what is it it's a misinterpretation of the message so in the day how are you going to make a Rapture how is your life how's your Manor life going to be pleasing to God that's right does everybody agree with that right so this is what everybody's missing in the message right this is where they think oh you know what we have Abraham as our father yeah we have brother Branham as our Prophet isn't that what they said yeah yeah what was it Jesus Christ was the interpretation of all the prophets all that the prophets spoke of Jesus Christ he was sitting there conducting himself according to that word right and they hated him for it they hated his conduct they hated his order they hated his Doctrine is that right you go look at Jesus ministry he had it all lined up he had every bit of this right here lined up is that right everyone the prophet spoke of him was made flesh right is that right and he was doing with the what all the prophets said right well Brethren said for the bride it's the same way do you know there's a portion of scripture that's written about you and you have to have the conduct the order and the doctrine of it right right but people in a message an hour and they think because they're this big shock believer they don't have to have any conduct you know what I mean right and I've heard people I'll be honest I've heard preachers say well you know what we don't need to preach a clothesline around here and their women will have heels like that right do you understand what I'm saying their conduct is sorry so even as a minister if all I do is just come preach Doctrine Doctrine Doctrine I need to get into some of this here right you understand what I'm saying you can't find a tape where brother round didn't preach yes that's right amen is that right and what's happened in the message they are because oh you know we're this big revelated people you know we just have about any old kind of conduct we want reason I hate TV because if I got one I'd watch it all right and I wouldn't watch a little of it right I like baseball I like football I like golf all right if it's got a ball I like it so I ain't gonna put a TV in my house I'm not going to tempt me because I know me all right I'm gonna be honest with you I ain't this big shot guy that if I will put it in my house if it's sitting there I'm gonna watch it all right so the best thing for me just keep it out all right but I've challenged people you show me where brother man said anything good about TV could be used right but he said if I had one I brought out the shotgun right is that right he said the lumps of the guy that wrote the lungs Edition he called it television yeah yeah he said that every disease in the fourth dimension is is in the fourth dimension does everybody agree with that exactly do you realize that TV is a product of the fourth dimension right amen it's a product of it you understand and the devil so got into it and perverted it in this hour like I told somebody in church I said you know you know I said it could be user I like to watch a football game but I gotta watch cheerleaders with it yeah I don't need cheerleaders right yeah so I ain't gonna get I'm not going to get a TV does anybody understand that I'm not going to park myself in front of that when I need to be reading the Bible every day Amen brother man said how are we going to make it when the sister said how are we gonna make the Rapture like Enoch right right pray and read your Bible every day right was that something Grady told him but you know what that is did he tell him some big Doctrine thing yeah come on Danny did he sell it well you got to believe this you got to believe that you gotta be no he said live a ABC everyday Christian Life pray read your Bible amen what is that conduct there's what the people in the message have gotten away from amen okay now you I'll let your profit can I read some quotes we'll just do it okay masterpiece 640705. now here is the interpretation thereof the reason now remember I had just got through writing I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote these notes yet but in preaching this morning I caught what it was right in my sermon did you notice the church only came in view now that's the truth friends the heavenly father who writes the word knows that I tell the truth I know say the truth and not knowing it until just a few minutes ago looked like or just recently see did you notice the bride coming in view twice the first seed and the second seed both of them exactly the same one amen and the reason they were dressed in different parts she'll come from All Nations right okay it'll make up the bride each one had long hair no makeup and real pretty girls it's either conduct they were watching me they were looking you know the messenger and the messenger are one all right the message and the messenger one is that right and it had their eyes on the messenger what did they have their eyes on the message is that right so listen what's it that represented the bride coming out of all Nations each one represented a nation they marched perfectly in line with the word all right and then I have to watch her she'll get out of step with that word right okay if I don't watch when she's passing by let me go on down I'm not a Jehovah Witness I can't read very long I don't like you but I can let me hit the main point they was getting back okay they was getting in line because they was looking out somewhere else right okay watch about that church that just went out into chaos the church went out into chaos they didn't have this right right that's the opposite of this is that right amen okay so they went to chaos the front ones I the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepped out of a little bit to the right hand side it looked like was trying to get back in line as they went by they was just passing me oh Forest here to the wall passing me I was standing there and then I just seen them all just move out and leave but you notice the church only came to view once right but the bride and twice is that right amen and he said let the Bride As she starts getting out of Step he says your bride's getting out of stairs is that right he was the ones on the back road yeah two or three of them on the back is that what he said we're getting out of step is that right from this that I'll step from this and that yeah they she come back in the step as the vision showed a few weeks ago right now is that right right this is where we're out of step is our conduct see what made Enoch take a Rapture is his manner of Life please God right Gloria is that right what happened some people in the grind got their eyes off the prophet off the message and their conduct they got out of step and they calmed up started getting all messed up is that right right amen and like I told you your life is an interpretation of this message right and if I was to preach at our church and I'm preached against TV and they come into my house I had a TV my life right would be a misinterpretation of what I'm preaching right and it causes confusion right I mean I've heard it over and over again I preached something Church they say well so and so in your church does that yeah yeah you see what I'm saying they're out of steps right and when you get out of Step what is it your life causes a misinterpretation of the word right you better get instead amen is that right you better go look if brother man said pray and read your Bible every day what you need to do you need to get your eyes back on the message all right what we've done in this hour we've taken our eyes off the message the bride right is that right we need to get our eyes back on the message and start getting back instead amen is that right it is sued listen to the quote as soon as she got back in Step what happened so what was the last thing that the bride needed to get in order for conduct right she has her Doctrine right we've got the order right right but the trouble is our conducts what's holding this up right man what did Brother Randolph say was going to hold up the Rapture the Readiness of the Bride exactly amen and in that quote and you look at it the last thing she was out of Staff her conduct wasn't right do you understand her life wasn't in order right that's what the bride needs to do we need to get back under the microscope of the message and see where we're out of step right and then get back into step is that okay is that okay okay and I'm gonna move off of that now and we'll move on to the subject that I really want to preach I had to get warmed up yeah amen I'm not like I'm not like brother Julie helicopters up helicopters down I'm like a C-130 transport I'm a big old boy I gotta go slow I get it up there and then I'm going to come down slow again okay but we're gonna get there all right well I want to tie with today is cod the Levites the Levites that's a weird one isn't it now don't go crazy on me I know the levitical priesthood's over with I know we're in the Melchizedek priesthood which is the son of man okay can you understand that that's right we're in a Melchizedek priesthood but do you under understand that the Old Testament was given to us for shadows and Tides amen right you know brother Ram said an adoption book in the last book he said if you're not a typologist you won't understand the scriptures right he said if you're not you know I've heard some people make fun of it and I've seen some guys go off on typo like we were talking today we'll have a certain license plate no type that you'll drive a certain car they'll type that now that's ridiculous yeah can I tell you that that's not the type of typologist I'm talking about a typologist I'm talking about you've got to understand that in the Old Testament there were shadows and types that were given amen and I could take those because that was Jehovah the old is Jesus Christ of the new right amen amen so I can take these shadows and tights being a typologist and bring them to an everyday something that happens in your life is that right amen so I want to read a quote now that brother Branham said about the Levites because we want to know what kind of don't we really do you want to know what kind of conduct you're supposed to have amen all right don't we want to know that if that if that group of people on the back row and you know what I don't know about you but this is the last stage this is the last course right this is the back row some of them got out of step right so what we want to do is we want to get our conduct in order I believe you guys I I've heard I've heard this brother preach I would never say he's off in his Doctrine are you kidding me I'd be nuts I know he's got the right doctor I know I got through I know brother Wade's many of the preachers in the message you have to write Doctrine but the trouble is the conduct of the people so bad amen I mean they their their life speaks louder than their words right isn't that what he said I mean you say you believe the message but I can pick up a message but it don't take me long to see your life is not interpreting the message of the hour your life is is chaos your life is not a conduct that is according to this message that hour so what we need to do is we need to get ourselves our conduct in order exactly and it's not all that remember it takes all three right right I'm do it away with Doctrine you understand like I said while ago it's the bar that holds the life in a tree very important your order is very important right amen and your conduct is important and when you get those three in line remember Brothers when you get them all in line no that's the way it is that's what he said by the message is that right so let me read you something here and I want to show you let me just quote I'm terrible I can't hardly read anything anymore I just want to preach you know what I mean I tell people I'm not into Jehovah's Witness I'm not a reader all right they get up and just read yeah you know I'm not just going to get up and quote quotes and read all the time I got to get up and minister to you break it down is that right that's what the preacher's supposed to do that's right but there's a quote and I want to read it here I'm going to read it now I mean let me see if I got like two sets of notes I actually preached four services on this back home okay you start being preaching about contacts you know people get bored they don't want to do that part yeah that's right they don't see the importance or the relevance of it you know what I mean they don't but let me tell you it's very relevant amen right amen your conduct is your interpretation of this message it is exactly right amen it's your man in our life is that right yeah so don't kid yourself it's important man I have these printers just want to hold on don't get nervous I'm not nervous all right I'll fumble around for a minute I'll get there thank you I'm not 24 pages of notes it's ridiculous how many notes yet I still like if I don't have 20 pages of notes I just you know I get nervous but I never hardly read them I just got them there yeah let me read some Jesus Christ the same yesterday now notice then the first thing you know when he noticed him and see him come and astonish the man now if you'll notice what a strange thing it was when all those Hebrews then when they sing remember staunch men renowned men holy men scholars in the Bible you couldn't lay one Hound on her life and say they wasn't holy they kept the Commandments of God just as true as could be kept they were holy they didn't do one thing day or night you know what they did they eat sweet and read the scriptures yeah pretty good huh yep well the ram said you pray read your Bible every day right they had to be born in a certain lineage before they could be a priest or a teacher the Levites does everybody agree with that yeah and they said this handed down their fathers handed down the Scrolls the laws they studied it day and night Glory okay now can I read uh the next quote this was a question's answers on COD now one thing there was sin in Israel and there was a man by the tribe of the name of Levi you know what Levi means accompanies him they pulled their swords and they went with Moses to the camp right and they destroyed everything that was sinned right in the camp and you know they killed their sons their old Sons their own daughters right their own Brothers their own sisters and those Levites if there was sin in the camp they drew their sword and they killed it right does everybody understand that yeah sir okay not going let's see God looked down and said because you did this and stood for me all these others will serve you you go right into the temple as priests is that right you stay right in the temple and the rest of them will work and will bring in a tent and take care of you amen with it yeah okay listen to what it says okay is that right oh Hallelujah if you can see that the Levites was the bride right man sure have you ever heard that before it might have I don't know if you have the Levites was the bride you know the Levites had to have a certain birth you know exactly is everybody okay with that right right so when you go read the Old Testament now when you read about those Levites that types you right they had to have a certain conduct come on did they hey man you read the Old Testament did they yeah man they had to have a certain type is that right you know the Levites were never numbered right that's right it's the bride number it's a number no American number right I could take and show you through the Old Testament you read every quote on the levite that types you all right man you know what your responsibility is to draw your sword and take all the sin out of the camp man not just him right right that's right you that's right right amen your brothers your sisters right your children you're supposed to kill sin out of the camp amen glory right if you let that sin stay there it's gonna sire the whole thing right does everybody understand that hey man so this is what happened let me go back and I want to explain in the Old Testament you remember when Moses went up on the mountain to get the Commandment s the children is or when he came down he said what's that noise and when he come down there do you know the people in the scripture says they were dancing naked around that golden cow that's right right did you know they were naked yeah pretty disgusting don't you think but you know who stripped them out Aaron right exactly Aaron wouldn't correct it all right and Moses looked at and said what is wrong he said well the people wanted something so I gave him a golden calf yeah is that what he said yeah and the people were dancing around that calf naked the scripture says that are they naked laodicea who strips them down right the preachers amen when you go out and lay over the sin you see these people all stripped down you know who did it the preachers did it that's right amen the preachers had done it why they won't preach the conduct that's what we got wrong in a lot of message churches preachers won't preach the conduct they'll preach the doctrine but they won't preach the conduct it takes all three to get you out of here man right okay so we don't just need the doctrine we need the conduct to go along with the dog but that's going to straighten you up where we can get out of here is that right so keep in mind as I'm gonna read about the Levites and a lot of people don't understand about the Levites but the Levites come and they stood with Moses amen have you stood with William Branham so are you a Levi if somebody comes in with a spirit in this church that it is not the conduct according to this message right now you got to use some wisdom you don't let somebody the first time they come through the back door just bam right you know come on use some sense about it but what you're going to do is you're in love you're going to correct that thing is that right you're going to take the word The Sword and cut it out of the congregation and if a pastor lets that thing continue to grow then he's going to be responsible for it amen the pastor has a big responsibility is that right right so the Levites their life if you read everything about a Levi it's a type of you man I'm gonna Draw Something on the board here I don't know if you've ever seen it before but it's pretty amazing when you really look at it okay so the levite has to be born a certain way right misconduct has to be a certain exactly do you know if he approached look at Aaron's sons did they die yeah right they didn't handle the firework was their conduct supposed to be a certain way in there you know everything the utensils the showbread everything in that Temple had to be placed in order it had everything those candles had to be a certain place everything had to be lined up is that right man does anybody ever looked up the word Tabernacle you know Tabernacle is a feminist name it's not a masculine name you know who the Tabernacle is right right man sure everything in you's got to be lined up all right the showbread's got to be lined up everything Body Spirit and soul the conduct if it's not lined up somebody's gonna die that's right it's going to be you Mr Levi yep right does everybody understand that right so in that Tabernacle all three of them they had to have everything right right couldn't be out of order could it so the conduct the order and they had to hang with Moses does everybody understand that so their conduct their order in their Doctrine had to be so-so to Levi's right and if they ever got out of order they died God didn't play around with that right if I'm not playing around with you either he gave you a message that you better come you better come under that amen if you don't come under the message then you exalt yourself over it that's what Lucifer does he exalts itself over the message that's given in every hour is that right so you got to be careful if your bride your conduct's going to be according to the Levites right amen amen everything's going to be right right amen so it's not just gonna and I wanna I wanna raise it because everybody puts well you know what's what's the what's proof you got the Holy Ghost you believe the message last time I checked by the fruits you'll know right what is your fruits it's your conduct right come on it is it's the way you live that's your fruit right isn't it so what is it you could say you believe in this it goes down scripture says the devil believes and trembles he's got more sense than some of us right at least he'll get scared right right some people will they'll sketch yourself they'll walk and hop Down Shoes Angels screw the tread amen so see your life you've got to have a conduct in your life amen if if brother Brown said the Levites type the bride did I read it amen right I can show you two or three other places where he did it so the Levites typed the bride when they were down in Egypt I don't know if he understood about Levites I'm gonna tell you something some of you here may be that way somebody told me something tonight I want to I want you to listen to what I'm saying listen real close okay the Levites what happened was when when Joseph went in there he said they were sheep herders right or really had her they went down everybody lived in Goshen did you know that you know what happened the pharaoh who knew Joseph and was really nice to Joseph said we're going to build a city you know what he did he offered to pay him you didn't know that did you go back and look at your history the Pharaoh paid them for their services so they left Goshen after a job there's like no yeah if they were to stay down in Goshen everything would have been well with them they wouldn't have come into bondage does everybody understand that right so what happened to it because of a job they got out of Goshen they like the money yeah but after a while the money become a burden to them right after a pharaoh come in they didn't know Joseph he quit paying them right and then they were in bondage and they couldn't go back to Goshen right you know the only people that stayed in Goshen Levi yeah you know why Levi's stayed down in Goshen they wanted to pray and read their Bible every day right does that sound familiar from what I just talked to you all right so see the Levites they didn't want to get out of Goshen they were doing fine just living down there God was blessing them they were praying and reading their Bible they were able to read pictures but the rest of the 11 tribes that now I'm out of ocean right you know what people will take it get them a job where they know they're going to miss Wednesday night yeah is that right let me ask you if you're a levite you're going to stay in Goshen you're going to stay at your post to do right brother Brennan taking sides with Jesus I read three times he mentions take stick be at your post to duty three times you think that's a light thing he was saying if you're going to take sides with Jesus you're going to be at your post to do right over and over I see message people they're going to take a job they'll come to me and say well brother Quan uh I don't know if I could be there on Sundays really why well I'm going to take a job it's gonna pay a dollar more an hour you mean to tell me you just you willing to you've got to be kidding me all right 160 bucks if you work 160 hours a month you're going to take that over coming to church Sunday right yeah you know what I told the person I said I'm going to tell you something come back Mom I'm going to tell you something if you go out there and say God gave you that job I'll correct you in front of everybody all right I said don't you tell me God gave you that job and he's going to pull you out of church I said you'd be God will bless you where you're at more than 160 dollars you're going after that's right what is it the Levites are going to stay in Goshen you're going to stay where God where you can read your scriptures that's right is that right but what people do at this age and laota see it I see it all the time people moving to this church people moving to that church for a job do you know why it's going to become a burden to you right and all they're going to do is enslave you Pharaoh right yeah but what did the Levites do they stayed on Ocean they were just content staying down there reading their scriptures having a good time is that right and I'm going to tell you later on God blessed them for all this you know what I mean so you may not get a blessing right now for it but you got a blessing coming amen if you'll stay in Goshen God's Gonna bless you but if you get out of Goshen for that job and for that all you're going to do is put more burden on you they'll enslave you out there is all they do you can I've seen it message people enslaved to a job move from here to here to here right right I've had people tell me I love the church I love the preaching I love the people but I'm going to go over there yeah really you mean you won't stay in the ocean yeah it becomes a bondage to them is what it is and they'll get under an old pharaoh who don't know Joseph yeah a preacher that don't know Jesus of Jesus is that right and you know what they do they come under bondage right that's what's happened to the people in that message of the hour that's right and they sell out is that right well the Levites didn't sell out right they stayed down in Goshen is where they did the others went up there and were mud daubers digging in that mud and you know what here we go in the wilderness Journey right Moses went up Moses come down the people were running naked around that calf can you imagine and and Moses said who's on the Lord's Side come and stand with me you know he stood with the Levites right the one had been praying reading their Bibles right these are the ones that stood see what he's talking about right brother Brown chased these types out through the Bible you know what I mean he really did he understood that Old Testament man those people stood with Moses is what they did is that right right they went through that they drew their swords and went through the car he killed all the sin out right now that's what it said go read it see if I'm not live or see if I'm not telling you the truth I'm not lying I'll tell you okay all right so we all understand that so we understand by Brother Branham and you go through and I can show you and I'm going to read some of them here in a minute and just comment on a little to show you that the Levites had a certain conduct that they did right and that conduct is showing you as a it's an example that's given instruction right so that you would know what your conduct's supposed to be is that right now it's the truth that's what you're if you want to know what your conduct should be go read about the Levites I'm going to challenge you to do that and when you do that say that's right because remember they were separated people they couldn't number them right the Levites couldn't own any property here right come on is that right exactly see there's nothing that I only hear right right I'm a levite I'm a bride there's nothing I own here this is just I'm just passing through it's not my home my treasures are laid up somewhere around the blue right so I believe I I have no possession here right is that right wasn't that the way they were all right man they had no possession on the earth so you go you're gonna fall in love with a job you ain't gonna Levi come on yeah you got no possession here you're just passing through what you're going to do is you're going to stay true you're going to read your Bible and pray every day live a simple Christian Life that's all it is just happy as they can be contentment was Godly that's a great name all right if people can't do that anymore they gotta they're gonna miss church on Sunday so they can go Bank 160 bucks a month yeah I was floored by that yeah can I tell you something else it was a preacher preacher yeah yeah you know what you come up with all the time right exactly people you think are spiritual but they ain't got enough spiritual sense to know that for the man said you ought to if you got the Holy Ghost you can't wait till those doors open you want to be here every service I mean you wouldn't miss it for nothing right Birdman said one service can determine your final destination right yeah so those Levi's it was a serious thing to them right they didn't play is that right and so because they went out and killed in the camp you know what he said okay you leave out to Europe you know he said they were a chosen people right does that talk to Brian amen are we a chosen people all right go through the scripture and look at those Levites and you'll see everything that you are right you're a chosen people you were separated do you understand you didn't sell out the world what are the things of the world right and when you stood by Moses you stood by William Brown is that the type of a prophet is that the conduct we're supposed to have all right I'll tell you yes it's a conduct we're supposed to have is that right exactly but you know what they because that God said they're my chosen people right is that right they're my chosen people right that's what we are do you know what the Levites were supposed to do they were supposed to administer to air in the high priest yeah who's the high priest of your confession Jesus who are you supposed to administer to Jesus Christ then they say in the scripture Brothers ministering he said that's the bride there right see brother Branham when he said the Levites type to bride he wasn't just joking it wasn't something he just threw out there all the way through the scripture when you started going and chasing them out about to leave I looked up every quote on the money bites I wanted to see what he said about it and when you see it the fullness of the type of Levites is she that's the bride oh man that's the bride does everybody understand that man and I'm going to show you something here this is this is the way it uh you know nothing nothing that was unclean could come near that Ark of the Covenant right right exactly do you know who the guards were that the Levites you know what you're you're the guard of the word man you ain't gonna let no filthiness come to that word is that right this man last night told me that he felt like his job was to clean up the doctrine right and I believe that I believe that why he's a levite he ain't gonna let nobody not a preacher not a priest not a king he's going to come near that Army if their life is not conducive to what the word says is supposed to be that's right hey do you know if you look through pictures on the on the Tabernacle those Levites had a sword in their waistband they had a sword you know what that was for your son unbeliever tried to approach that they would whip their sword out and cut him to shreds if anybody tries to approach this message and it don't matter if it's my daughter it don't matter if it's my son right right it don't matter if it's my wife right it don't matter because why I'm a levite and I have been put in the position right to guard that to everybody amen is that right because God comes down there and sits on that amen you know what the turbine apple is your heart your heart all right right man that third compartment enters the Intervale is that what he said he said that curtain was your self-will right you're the one that lets him in right you're supposed to come bully Before the Throne you know I'm gonna protect what I got in my heart hey man that devil ain't gonna he ain't gonna approach me with something because when he does I'm gonna whip my sword out I'm gonna cut him to shreds he ain't gonna get near me brother and I carry that sword right here amen that's my part that's what I'm supposed to do as a Levi as a bride is that right that's right now come on that's what it is okay now let me show you something I think I had a board like this too by the way I bought it for you too yes I did I can't remember that's why I don't like it just joking does everybody understand this is the Tabernacle in the wilderness right that's right everybody understand that this is the big out here right I'm gonna have to draw it down so you can see it everybody understand that right here here where's the curtain here right right here's where the all right Mercy Seat was is that right here's where God came down here right now the Levites what they were in charge now the Levites they had a course the Levites were actually part of the 12 tribes is that right in their course what they did that course that that group of Levites would run would be up here and they'd be serving in the temple yeah did everybody know that right right now I'm going to tell you something we're on the last course you are the last course of Levites there's no doubt in my mind yeah right I'm gonna be bold enough to make a statement tonight I believe we're the last course right I would believe we were the two or three on that back row were our conduct wasn't right right and we got to get it in order is everybody so the levite's job the Levites that when Moses laid down the doctrine they had to stand with Moses right the order everything had to be in order and he compartments do you agree with that I had to be perfect buddy every every jot and Tittle had to be right amen is that right so you have the right conda if you're a Levi you got the right conduct you got the right order you got the right doctor right amen no doubt about it is that right okay so here we are here's the Levi now the course that served and I could go read the scriptures I don't have much time I can't read the scriptures okay but go read them at home the Levites when they serve they actually this is where the Levites camped right here they were the group that camped here right right yep is that right right hey man sure right they did didn't they man now this is what happened here you had the tribes the 12 tribes right now the other Levi said it wasn't their course were down wherever their order was like well here's what you and I drew it way too big so I'm just going to show you something like this this is how they camped is everybody agree with that remember they were the close one I grew that way too big so visualize can you do that all right yeah okay here's what it was everybody okay with that hey man we're seeing it aren't you look this is the way it was and right here these bro these Levites ministered unto Aaron the high priest does everybody agree with that scripture says it okay now let me let me draw the picture truly the way it is can I do this man everybody's starting to see what it is amen yeah yeah everybody's starting to see what I'm drawing put it together connect the dots all right does everybody say what it is do you see what Moses singing in heaven right yeah you sing that pyramid is exactly what he said right what gave it away when I was reading Brethren said that now everybody understands the Levites were the only ones that were allowed to carry the ark right and the burden of it was on their heart exactly They Carried the ark over their heart everybody agree with that right he said that when they carried that you know that they really they were the Tabernacle down they put it up they put the showbread is that right right they were the ones that put everything in order right is that right right man see the bride hath made herself ready amen all right they're the ones who put the Tabernacle on and the Tabernacle is a feminist name not a masculine name amen so when it's talking about that Tabernacle let's talk about me I'm the Tabernacle right yeah I'm the one who wants to come and live in the mercy seats in the bride this one come down and set in your heart all right man why would you would the overcomer's supposed to sit with me and my and my father is sitting if I sit with my father in his throne right is that right the Tabernacles me and you it's a feminist name look it's right on top and he'll come down and set right here is that right scripture says he'll be the light thereof is that right so that's the way it's going to be and what was he doing he was giving us a shadow of time a new city that was to come who's going to be who's going to be in pyramid City the bride exactly and 144 000 right there ain't going to be no more there right the kings of the Earth are going to come in but guess what they're they're gonna have to go by there I'm gonna have to go buy this to get there yeah sure isn't that what they were man see that's what it is the bride you're the you guard this thing God puts you here to guard this thing to not let any of those nut head preachers out there try to bring some strange Doctrine right amen strange woman right into the camp right right to not commit adultery is that right that's what's your job every one of you said not just the preacher right your job's to do that when somebody tries to bring false Doctrine to you you're supposed to pull your sword and hack them to Pieces say son you can't come near this Tabernacle amen right right the only thing gonna approach this is the ones that are have their conduct their order and their Doctrine is correct exactly so the rest of them if you don't have that right in your life you ain't going to approach God right forget it I'm telling you you're not going to approach him if you're not that way okay but here's where the pride looked this is where the bride camps right here does everybody understand that exactly amen right here they're all in here amen that's not the 144 000 folks that's us all right we're gonna be at the very common yeah all right we are right man right that's where we're going to be yes sir and we won't let nobody get there and we're doing it now spiritually speaking we're fulfilling the the order of the Levites now right right is that right amen right okay amen right so remember I believe I'd say they have a certain birth do we have to have a certain birth right you must be born again right is that right let me read some things that I looked up can I do that Levites were never numbered if you want to write it down numbers 147. the priests and Levites live the same life do you know the high priest he the rules of a high priest was the same rules that the Levites had sure now they were priests it was high priests and Priests right does it say in Revelation we're priests and Kings under God is that what it says your life can't be different than the high priest right and the high priest life can't be different yours it's the same life it's the same Holy Ghost amen is that right amen so does we understand pretty simple then Moses himself dispensed oracles and revealed the Divine will of God on men's guidance is that right sure Moses gave the oracles that's right he did the Levites went and did it yeah you know what we're supposed to do that's what I said earlier see you're a Levi because why you go do it right if you don't do it how can you be a Levi your conduct or you'll die at in that right if another Levi was to try to approach that with the wrong conduct order Doctrine he'd have been killed right remember when those Levites come and stood with Moses is that right later on some of them Levites decided Moses had too much on him oh yeah were they Levites did they die right why their conduct order and Doctrine waiting right they said they stood with Moses but then they got out there it out and out there and decided you know what Moses ain't the only one around here it's right God talks to us too isn't that what they said that's what suddenly got in some of these message preachers brother gave us the perfect conduct ordering Doctrine right and all we got to do is go do it get our conduct order Doctrine right and you understand it's done deal but what do they do they're going to add their own order to it yeah they gotta add their own conduct to it yeah right I mean I know it's settlement they might be here in Georgia I don't know where somebody stand in the back row handing the women hoes when they come in are you kidding where do you see that in a message do you see that anywhere yeah no you better stand by Moses Mr preacher you better quit hatching up all this crazy stuff you understand what I'm saying and I told him what I feel like my call in life is to do is to stay true to what's set on tag and for me to get in a cooler in my room and break it down for my people right now that's what I feel like my call in life is to do I'll be honest with you that's I I tell my church that over and over because why it's my call right it's what I'm said to do at Bartlesville Tabernacle and to where the people will move up I had a lady I'm gonna tell you this I told you this or you this today a lady was going to our church 40 years I preached the other day and she said what you preached the other night changed me I tell you what I stood there in front of her and I had tears in my eyes she had tears in her eyes I said man that is the best thing a preacher right here you understand and tell me what a great preacher I am what a great message I preached and then I see your life is so contrary to the message of hour your life speaks louder than your wife amen I'm going to tell you as preachers we get that all the time oh brother yeah brother brother Samuel I enjoyed your message about that yeah and their life don't move up right they don't change their conduct and Order and Doctrine is not like the Levites exactly it's contrary to it yep and some of those people are the biggest burden and wear on you than anybody year after year they'll come to you like that right that's right but when they can come to me and tell me my life changed or what you said that'll make the preacher shout amen all right that's what we're here to do we're here to speak the message of the hour to get your eyes on the message can I tell you that Amen to get your eyes on the message so that your conduct order and Doctrine will get right and we'll all get out of here man that's what we're here amen okay my eyes are watered just a minute so the high priest and Levi same life same cleansing same Holy Ghost do you understand that right I'm not going to preach to you a different Jesus is that right the same Jesus that's right same yesterday today and forever is that right what's your list this might know some of you Levites lived in exemplary life before their children right think about it you wonder why some of our kids are not here yeah it could be your life you lived in front of them amen you could say I believe the message in your life misinterprets the message right and some of your kids will go out here because they're so confused they don't know what it says because and I had a preacher tell me this one time it blew away the statement but it's a true statement you don't tell that guy that child reaches age of maturity that you're God to him sure that's a tough statement isn't it right man but it's a true story right that child is looking at every remember said the man on Christmas who went out every house he came to he got a drink and he left footprints on the on the uh snow yep hey did the guy stop to look where Junior was and he's back here like this yeah what was he doing he's walking in his footsteps right he wasn't living in a levite life see sometimes you and I'm not always I'm not saying that always does everybody understand that but sometimes it could be the life that you live is why your kids are walking the way they're walking but the Levites lived in the exemplary life right so if you're the bride you're going to live this life you're going to live like zeppelinary life everybody understand amen yep chosen from among their brothers and allowed to approach God Amen pretty good isn't it all right there was guards of the Tabernacle also took care of the Tabernacle they offered sacrifices for the people another brand of a quote said they're going to want rain they're going to come to you right you're going to offer the sacrifice to God and don't want to get that right amen that's bride that's right that's a levite because they brought their sacrifices to glory is that right you see the times through it yes sir lives were blameless when a priest sinned he brought guilt upon himself in the family right right it's purely by when you see it you bring guilt upon himself and the family right they were judges did you know that right absolutely amen are we going to be judges on the other side yeah right that's a levite right oh yeah the people gave tithes to the Levites did you know that do you know and I'm going to tell you a quote and it Thrills me do you know on the other side when we're in this setting here that the people out there who grow gardens plant potatoes we're not going to be doing that right the Levites didn't work right right does everybody hear me right the Levites didn't work got it that's right I'm not gonna what was what was the curse that put on Adam you're going to work by the sweat of your foot work w-o-ook that's a four-letter word to a lot of people right work I need to work over there right I'm not gonna be under that Covenant you understand yeah I'm not going to work but the people outside there are going too they're going to be planting potatoes and they're gonna be playing Tomatoes all those things and you know what they're going to bring into the city a 10th part the ties you know what you're going to live off from there are ties right you're going to be in that City you're gonna eat tomatoes that they grew out there right you ain't gonna work but they're going to tie to you well that's why you tie the Levi's right so in time you're going to live in that City and I'm going to quote I can prove it you know you've read it but he they bring their ties in they bring their tithes in then they get the leaves off the tree for the nation exactly so these keys of the Earth are going to bring their tithing into the city right and that's what we're gonna live off from we're gonna eat the tomatoes they grew right the potatoes they Rude the lettuce the apples whatever you have an appetite for all right you understand that's what you're going to do you're the Levites you're the bride is that right I mean it's perfect brother I could read that quote to you but I got 24 pages of clothes I'm afraid if I get started reading quotes we won't get out of here you know he ministered to the high priest I already said that right he partook of the show bread took care of the furniture vessels and curtains so he put everything in order in here right there was an order to this right go kid yourself there was a real real word or two right okay inspected unclean persons come on man don't tell me you don't know when somebody on clean trash to approached this right that's right why you got the message right you've got what William Brown said right a woman coming here with Bob here and say she's got the Holy Ghost are you going to be fooled by that if she jumped up spoke in tongues you're going to say oh we had a sister to smoke you know interrupted the preaching brother Terence is gonna go there and said sister we had an order here right now and that is subject to this man in the Pulpit don't interrupt daddy right that's what you say right there right amen yeah is that right sure so so what we can expect seeing do you know the Levites in the Old Testament when somebody had leprosy if they had leprosy they could go they had to go to their house and inspect to see if it's clean of leprosy right yeah you know what leprosy is a type of yeah so when somebody comes into the camp you got every right to say sister you need to quit bobbing your hair but don't love sisters I've watched some scissors they'll blow you away you felt like you got beat to death before they get through see you you know it's like I told them you know really I wouldn't have to preach on the hair and all that if a sister come in we let her say a few Services right we got love oh yeah don't we a little compassion but after a while you say sister you know our women don't wear see-through blouses yeah right we believe that a woman ought to be you know you know you you would you do that would you do that sister or brother Sable could preach the great things right but see it ain't just up to him the fact that you're a levite you could correct the situation be careful you know you give some people Authority you know they'll play you think you got run over by a D9 right right I mean because they don't like the way you comb your hair no come on you know willing to risk their lives in service for the Lord amen you know brother random said when you do service for the Lord it'll never be forgotten right do you know every service that you every service You Preach there's a reward for you sure did you know that every time you open your Bible and you're in service for the Lord another man said that does not go unnoticed all right amen there is a reward coming for you for that did you know that that's what it was they were the temple musicians the Levites did you know that right right sure they were to inspire and spiritually prepare Israel for war did you know that yeah weren't they that's right yeah you know that in every levite there's a special chromosome that none of the other tribes have right exactly that's right you know that I know I knew you knew that right they have a y chromosome that nobody else has right there's something in you that's different than the rest all right that's right is that right so you as a Levi there's something in you right that's different than the rest but there's something in you bride that's different than the rest is that right right there so you go I challenge you when you go I ask my church you know what people do they'll a preacher they'll hear oh he's a good message they go home they don't open up and check it out right see what I want you to do I want you to go from here and I want you to read it I'm just telling you a few things that I thought about the Levites go in your Old Testament and read about the Levites and you'll see it over and over and over again how those Levites type the bride is that right that's what the true type of Levites are is the bride right that's what brother Bram said in COD I never knew that until I read that quote and I stopped it took my breath I said what and I looked at the book name conduct ordered a doctor and I said sure he's by the Levites he's set in a shadow in the Old Testament to show you how you're supposed to conduct your life right the most perfect shadow of how we're supposed to live is by the way the Levites in the Bible right and we had a prophet to come down here and break it down into Kentucky's or we'd have never seen it does everybody and we're supposed to as ministers we're supposed to break it down for the people right to let them know how they can approach God right because why the only way you can approach God is if you're conduct your order right now your Doctrine is correct right exactly if it's not you'll die right does everybody understand that yeah amen all right pretty simple isn't it yeah amen pretty simple hold on just a minute okay I'm at Good Times let's just stop there can we stop there everybody got one point there are there's just so many here that I can tell you about it and I just read some of them this is my notes I preached four sermons on this fat phone yeah I just I just couldn't believe how you know I could believe it brother Adam said it right but it was never open to me right until I read it all right so go back get your bike that's right remember if you're a Levi they stayed down the ocean they read their Bibles every day they love the word of God they were just the thing that made them the most content was just study in the word yeah yeah you didn't care about going out and making big money you know at the job side oh man you know Pharaoh's paying a lot of money down there didn't face the Levites at all they were happy being in Church Reading their Bibles studying the scriptures why can't we do that why don't why are we always so stiff-necked and uncircumcised do always resist the Holy Ghost is that right why do we do that you know brother Brandon said if you've got a complex do the opposite I heard that young man I don't know who you are done you know but anyway I preached the other day on Abominations you know God hates lying right oh he hates lying sure I told him if you look at it it said lying lies you know some people just lie to like yeah my little granddaughter she's eight years old that girl really lied to me didn't tell me the truth lying just to be lying and the scripture talks about that is that right and got another line you bear false witness against the brother God really hates that right but nonetheless God hates it right he hates it so much in the Book of Revelation he said if you add to and take away your part will be taken out right exactly like I told somebody if you ever when I when I took psychology class in college they told whispered something a girl's ear the professor and then she he said now you tell you it's like one person out of class at us for the same thing in their ear they did it for 10 people then the 10th person the professor pulled her out said now repeat what they said and they repeated what was said he held up what he told them it wasn't even close all right you understand that that's why you people add to and take away right now if you're doing that in the natural God already told us we're not supposed to add or take away from Revelation right I told him you know God protected that but you know that's where it tells the Harley who she is yeah it exposes the Roman Catholic you know they changed the Bible they won't change that one right you know why because God put it if you change if you add to or change this one God's a real smart guy yeah they protected that word in Revelation right because there's going to be a bride down here at the end time he's going to catch it and he said you know what I'm going to protect that but see God hates attitude and take it away right so if you do that you know that's a lie and God hates that right right I told my daughter in the truck I picked her up at school and she said so I said Chloe do you know God hates a liar she got real quiet I said do you know scripture says that the devil is the father of liars I said if you continue doing that girl do you realize the devil's your daddy I don't know if it did good or not but I told her all right I mean little eight-year-old girl but I told her God hates lies and for that you young man whoever you were I Pat you on the back for getting up and apologizing because your conduct was not conducive to this church I commend him for it no chance there's a lot of people been in this message 40 years ago right you got that right that's the church we're giving for nonsense is that right so God will bless you and anytime let me tell you something brother man says you've got a complex do the opposite next time the Devil comes to you and wants you to lie tell the truth yeah right scripture says to resist the devil he'll flee from you whatever the devil's trying to give you do the opposite right and that's resisting brother man said that's resistant exactly you should do the opposite right so when the Devil comes to you and tries to tip you with something do the opposite and he said resist the devil he'll flee from right amen is that right so all we got to do is do the opposite amen that's why we know the conduct the order and the doctor to this right yeah exactly right and we're the bride we're the Levites that's going to keep it right is that right thank you Lord right I'm gonna let nothing approach you right no sin is going to approach this Tabernacle right is that right amen you said you had some new people who's new somebody hold your hand up you knew any new ones here that's okay well I was gonna tell you if you're new you're sitting under a good pastor when you found a good pastor you found a good thing right because there's a lot of people out there ain't found a good pasture yet right that's right right amen you've got a real
