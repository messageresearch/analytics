your word you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from our destruction so we believe you we commit it all to you now and just have your way in Jesus name amen amen there two scriptures we've been reading to try to bring a thought from Hebrews 81 now the things which we have spoken this is the ssal what now seven chapters read it sometime together all together is one and just realized that when Paul gets this far he said now I'm going to try to sum this up he's explaining the great Mel jezdic all of the things of of the great understanding of predestination and all of the things of the word and then he says now this is the sum what is that sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens let's go to Ecclesiastes it's hard to find for you right next to Songs of Solomon and Ecclesiastes 12 verse 13 and after he's concluding all that he said Ecclesiastes called the preacher that's what it's called you know for the Book of Ecclesiastes the preacher now after he's got to preaching all of his sermon and he comes down to the end of it he says now let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter and what is the conclusion of it fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now some that wasn't here may need a copy of that just a few that that didn't have one to just show that the things that were you know to give it to you the scriptures and then that way you can go read your for yourself cuz I like to read the Bible for myself you know I mean hearing somebody else read it and tell me what it says is fine but you know I I like to read myself and uh I like to uh this Ecclesiastes said I like to I like to hear the conclusion of the matter now in the Bible summing up I'll have to give this a tiny bit of a background but there is what would be called the seven compound names of Jehovah all right now in that you'll see that it's Jehovah Gyra Jehovah tisu uh you got many uh titles uh Jehovah Shalom Jehovah n n nessi Jehovah Rah Jehovah RFI uh Jehovah Shamar all of those were ways that God was trying to speak to the people or you know of what they the time that they were and then when they would write it down and and put it and and a lot of it it really used like we used this morning uh there in in Genesis 22 where we use the for Jehovah Gyra and that's where that when Abraham was to take his son Isaac up on the mountain you know and to actually to kill him and uh he was well intended to do it cuz he was headed that away but God stepped on the scene and like we we know the story of why how would that uh lamb that you know when when God spoke to Abraham and told him to hold his hand not kill his son he turned around and looked and he found a lamb well where did that lamb come from because as the prophet has explained it to us back there you know you could walk easily I mean you know 20 M A Day 25 mil a day and they went 3 days journey and then the mountain was way off and they go on up and Abraham's carrying the the fire and carrying the wood and got a knife in his hand and long about that time you know Isaac he begins to to uh he was on up maybe you know 12 13 14 years old whatever somewhere and he begin to look around and he said now now daddy where's uh I I see the fire and the you know I see the wood I see the knife but said where's the where's the sacrifice that we're going up here to offer and God looks Abraham looks back at him and he says now son said God will provide himself a sacrifice well he was speaking from a prophetic form because he was actually looking at what he was going to sacrifice right he was literally going to kill his own son because God spoke to him told him to do it because you know like I said this morning uh God may not never ask you to kill one of your children because that kind of in this day they'd kind of get you for uh things but uh you know back then it was a little different style of ways but you know maybe sometimes he ask you to do something that is strange um maybe he asked you to run over to Lula church as afternoon and sit down and listen you know might be a little different thing for you want you to do and uh that's just a way of saying it but it it happens that way and uh but anyhow when he got ready to kill him he turned around and God spoke to him and there was the lamb where'd it come from you know back there on the mountain how would a lamb survive back on the mountain when the animals were to guide him you know and everything but God created a a sacrifice to take the place of what Abraham was fixing to do see the Lord provided a sacrifice all right so then providing that sacrifice when Mo when um the writing came through on it it was declared that Abraham said this is a place that I'll call it Jehovah Gyra say because the Lord has provided a sacrifice all right now as I was trying to bring this morning see then Jehovah Gyra being the Lord's provided sacrifice then if that was true that he is our sacrifice and we believe that God that was just a speaking of the coming of Jesus Christ all right and you know all of the things back there the offerings the signs the things that happen only spoke of Calvary coming because we know who the real true sacrifice is right see it's not a a lamb today it's it's not a a goat or a Ram or a red heer or something like that you know it's the Lord Jesus Christ was our sacrifice if not we're in bad shape you know we've got to believe that he paid the price he took our place only thing he asked of us to do is just to take his place then upon the Earth and be what we're supposed to be as Christians to let the world see Christ Living in our lives you know and see Jehovah Gyra then who was the the one see when God came down himself because we believe in one true and living God not as we you know had been been taught of all of our Lives maybe a lot of things about the godhead but I believe in one true and living God and like Jesus said unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins well we know for sure that he died for our sins right we know for sure that Jesus Christ hung on the cross and died for our sins well it wouldn't be just for you to send one of your children down to die for something that you're supposed to die for so we don't believe that that there was another person somewhere else that sent another person you know to do something else God came himself because that's what he told to Abraham that God Abraham said to Isaac God will provide for himself and he did 2,000 years ago he provided himself a sacrifice right to hang up on a tree to be able to pay the sin debt for you and I and thank God for that sacrifice you know because if heam made the sacrifice where would you and I be we'd still be in our sin that's the that's the only point he had to pay a price because there was a penalty because we had sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and and by doing that then a py had to be made or a price had to be paid see and God came down himself back there 2,000 years ago and and died upon a tree it was not the the beating that killed him it was not the the uh Stripes you know doing and all that was for our healing it was not that because when they pierced his side they come to find that water and blood said come out signifying that he died of a broken heart right you know why because mankind rejected him that's what he died of he died in mine in your place it was my sins that put him on the cross it was your sins that put him on the cross and he died of a broken heart because no one would accept him he kept telling them L you believe that I'm he you'll die in your sins but they wouldn't believe it me what do we believe today that's what I was asking you at the end of the service this morning who is your Sac sacrifice right who is the one that took your place cuz someone has to we can't die for ourselves that's right and as I said we've had good people that come along and give their life for other people you know fall on a hand grenade and and save a company or save men around them to take the whole BL but you know that didn't save us all that's it preserved some bodies maybe but it didn't save a soul so we got to depend upon our sacrifice amen and our sacrifice has to be that God gave himself right to take our place you say well I don't understand that because you know how can God die well it's very simple if you just think simple I guess that's why God made me the way I am he gave me a simple mind that just think simple and I think slow and I talk slow and uh you know but see you think things out Simply if Jesus said unless you believe that I am he is that scripture you'll die in your sin who's he talking about the Bible said it was God Emmanuel you know Emmanuel God With Us who was that sacrifice you say well it was the second person now that we're enough educated though that we know better than to think about things in the wrong order and I know these are you know it's it's things that we should consider but see God Almighty died on that tree that's right you said God can't die no not the way we think about it that's right because as I just got to explaining it it wasn't the the beatings that it wasn't the the nail Prince that killed him he gave his own life but he'd already told him he said you can't take my life read your scripture Matthew Martin luk John he said I lay it down you can't you couldn't take it it was no way to do it that's right he said I'll lay down my life amen he said but I'll raise it again all right see then what he done what is death as we say you know I know I'm carnal but I like to get this point across we say what is death you say well death is when when you just lay down and die and they take you to the Undertaker you know and they pick you up as pretty as they can and they walk over and you look down in there and said oh ain't he pretty no he's dead that's not a joke it's true he's dead life has left the body they've been bombed it but we call that death that's not death because the Bible says that no man you you can't can't take your own life you can take the existence of life away from you that's right but you can't do nothing it's God that has to take the soul away that's right amen you can be blown to pieces of all kind of thing but if there's anything left there you can still be alive see God is the only one that can take your life right Satan can't you say Satan kills people no Satan don't kill people cuz he can't do it that's right he don't have the power to amen God has to allow the life to leave the body so what happened to Calvary very simple very simple to understand one true and living God that's right that there a baby was born 2,000 years ago and what happened what happens when a natural baby is born a natural baby is born what he do when the baby comes forth God gives it a spirit right and he gives it a soul right to where it can live that was simply what God done he just came right down Hebrews 10:5 a body thou H has prepared me he just came down through the Virgin birth and when that body was come forth from the wound of Mary he just stepped right into it amen the very soul and the Very Spirit of almighty God doing that making God in human flesh John 1:1 in the beginning was the word word is with God and the Word was God verse 14 says and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us and we beheld it as only begotten of the father you all right so what happened at Calvary he said into thy hands right I commend my spirit right God just simply stepped out of that body and left him hanging there that's right so God died in the bases that for you and I right all right they put the body in the grave the Bible says the spirit went to speak to the soul their spirit's in prison and then he come back up in 3 days picked that body up took it up made it in a glorified state right turned around in just a little bit the Holy Ghost came back down right to live in the hearts of the people amen now that's not hard to understand then how the life could leave the body and things could happen and that God could die in our place and that would make him then as I was trying to bring out that would make him then what happened to Abraham Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide a sacrifice amen all right now that's just background material but tried to get you to look at it in the respect that many of you have spoken to me about it and said before I started this kind of a series on it that you hadn't looked at it like I was trying to bring it out well I that's good you say well I believe in one God okay now listen to me please you say I believe in one God brother Dale well that's true but when you admit that you don't see things in the clearest respect it doesn't mean that you don't believe in one God it don't mean that you're not right you know it doesn't mean that it means your lack of understanding right your lack of Revelation from God all right so that's the human element right all right so then what have I been trying to say that if there is an all there's a lot more of the thing things that are called Redemptive names than just the ones I gave you but all that is summed up in everything that God is and has been or ever will be is summed up into these seven Redemptive names which would be you know Jehovah Gyra see the Lord's provided sacrifice Jehovah T you and I'm a bad pronouncer but it means the Lord our righteousness Jehovah Shalom which means what our peace every time God would step into the presence of man what does he say peace because he knows the the supernatural Jehovah Nasha which means our Banner you remember when the children of Israel went forth each group had a banner for their tribe and then they would like four of them get together and they'd have a banner that they had to follow so we'll get down to those things and then it's Jehovah Rah which is the Lord is my shepherd you know Psalms 23 Jehovah rapi which is the Healer and then Jehovah shama which means the Lord is present so you sum up everything about God into these seven ways or expressions and as I said now remember it was the way God was appearing to the people he would appear as I said to Jehovah Gyra to Abraham why because he needed a sacrifice now while he was up on the mountain and what he was doing he didn't need a need a Healer so he wasn't appearing as that in that form but the point I want you to see is that and it'll take us quite a while to finish these that all of that sums up into one person almighty God God has always wanted to reveal himself to man that was his purpose for creating us right he created us where he could come down and fellowship with us amen he'd come down in the cool of the day and the scripture there Adam and Eve you know in the garden he could talk to them he could fellowship with them that's right right we see one day then sin entered the picture and When sin entered the picture and they were cast out of the garden what was God going to do you know what he was going to do you already know what he's going to do he's going to make a way amen for that man to be restored back not to just a Garden of Eden cuz who worries about that they claim that's over there somewhere around Iraq but who cares about where his at it's polluted now all messed up you see but God wants to reveal himself to you and I for whatever we have need of right right if you need a Healer today he's wanting to heal you more than you wanting to be healed why because you'll have to admit that in God there was what would be called attributes you know I mean you're looking at me I'm a I'm a human being but I'm also I'm a father I'm a son I I'm I'm a grandfather I'm a grand grandfather you know I'm a pastor of a church former employee of gentle Motors I got many many titles but I'm just one person and and I don't manifest all of them together you know my wife doesn't call me father I mean we do sometimes you know we say daddy or Mom or something you don't want to say it she doesn't have she doesn't really it's not correct for to call me Daddy but it's right for my children to call me that cuz that's the way I'm manifesting myself to my children now to my grandchildren they don't call me Father cuz everybody in our house calls me poppy but oh that's just what it's developed you know even you call me that but see it's something to reveal yourself or to make yourself known and that's the way God's done amen so for 4,000 years he dealt with man down through what we call the Old Testament situation and he dealt with them trying to reveal himself that's all he wanted to do just make yourself known now but still he knew even though he would accept the sacrifice that was offered for sin you know that he ordained the animals and things but that still didn't take away sin it only done is the the word for it is called Capo which means it discovered it and that's why Jesus CHR the scripture said he died once for all the all the Old Testament sin was just by that animal being offered it couldn't eradicate that sin and neither could it eradicate the person who was sinning to keep him from wanting to do those things but it was just pushing it covering it pushing it bringing it to Calvary cuz he died once for all as well as the old and the New Testament people right but see then the price once it was paid then the ride of of uh being able to Fellowship again was brought back into mankind but it can only be done by the new birth right we wasn't born wrong that's why Jesus not talking to Nicodemus you remember there in the scripture and he said Nicodemus you must be born again and and the scripture calls Nicodemus in the original translation calls him the teacher of Israel I know Jesus said a teacher but the original translation bring it out says the teacher in other words he was the top teacher of all Israel you know in other words you think today if you try to figure out somebody like Billy Graham or Roberts or something like that or or some great uh person of intellectual abilities you know and you'd call him you're the teacher but when he when he was talking to Nicodemus he said you must be born again very simple language I like what the scripture said said the Common People heard him gladly so he didn't change his language when he started talking you know how people are I'm just plain old country I've been around all over the the United States and I've been in a few foreign countries and things and and they have trouble in the foreign countries translating my speech it's not maybe my words but it's my speech because I still say ha tote and carry you know just like I do here well we understand that you know fetch me that glass well you say that overseas and you say fetch me that GL fetch what are you talking about and this hard to translate that but that's just the way we talk because we're we're common well that's the way Jesus was talking and my point I'm trying to make is this if I'm from here and I go to Canada where they speak real proper I don't change my way speaking you know I try to be more sensible but I don't use there in there in here and because I never could figure it out when you say here and deer that's too close together right you said which one you saying here or dear when we just play it out we say here and deer like I've always say to you you go up North and you they'll laugh at you like everything but you go in and you order a meal and you say I want some maters and ters and they won't never ask you what you're talking about they'll go in the back room laughing their head off at you but they'll go get you maters and ters right but you let one of them come down here and walk in the cafe and and they said what do you need and they said I want some tomatoes and potatoes you said what cuz you don't understand what they're saying now get the point that's all right I make an illustration for one little word see Jesus didn't change his language right Nicodemus was the guy that had the problem y Jesus knew exactly what he's talking about he said unless you're born again amen you must be born again Nicodemus right well what Nicodemus say you mean I got to go back to my mother's wound and be born a second time he said if I speak to you of heavenly things you don't understand it he said I'm not talking to you that I'm telling you you got to be born again in other words Nicodemus you born wrong right no matter what we think of any of us we born wrong right the psalmist said we were born in sin shapen in iniquity went from our mother's wound a liar you look down at a little bitty baby you know two hours old you look at it you say that's a liar well people don't like if you say that about your kids but it's true right you think it ain't true well it's about 2 years old and you say honey where's you get that cookie M got cookie all over his face and both hands and didn't lie to you like everything what that come from certainly didn't come from God and it didn't come from Mom and Daddy cuz they teach her children not to lie true M and daddies huh amen well point is we're born that way and that's what what Jesus was trying to get to Nicodemus you were born wrong right and you got to be born the original translation says You must be born from above where he was born from so then that's the point we have to get we got to hear what he has to say about it then Nicodemus left there unregenerated right because he couldn't understand but on the day of Pentecost those that did understand was in the upper room at Pentecost and they understood what the new birth was they understood what Jesus was saying even though they walked with it for three and a half years the disciples had they still didn't understand him but on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell well now that's the thing today that we need we need that same one that wrote the word to be able to come and interpret the word to us and we can see all of these things is trying is God trying to reveal himself to us ain't that wonderful to think that God Almighty is trying to reveal himself to mankind amen now you can go to school all your life and you'll never learn that cuz they won't teach it to you that way that's right they teach you the great intellectual point I'm not against it I'm just saying that it won't be done by intellect and has to be done by the New Birth the Born Again experience to be able to understand then and what is my point being that you cannot put more emphasis upon Jehovah Gyra if you're going to try to serve God then you would upon Jehovah RI which is our healer right if the Bible says he's our sacrifice yes now why can't we believe he's our healer he said I'm the Lord that Health all of thy diseases you remember how the prophet brought it out one day the had a way of emphasizing things I love he said you want to look into Moses's doctor's kit you know Moses with 2 and A2 million people out in the wilderness for 40 years walking around and the Bible said that their shoes growed with them right now that's what your Bible says amen you said well I don't believe that well you don't believe the Bible BL language no problem you just don't believe it but you see their clothes didn't wear out but I don't understand that I don't either but I believe in God that can do it don't you yes amen now but in all of that he said do you want to see Moses little you know what we call the Satchel you know the little doctor's kid you know a little black bag to Satchel do you want to look into Mo to Moses Satchel look down in there and you know what you read I am the Lord that Health all of thy diseases you know it's all Moses needed you remember the snakes even though they got in trouble themselves and caused it but you know the snakes was biting them Moses just went over and formed a little thing and hung it up on a tree and let it look like a snake and he said okay you look at that cuz God told me if you look at that and believe it you'll be healed and that's how they was healed right why because that serpent was not the Healer that serpent represented sin already judged you understand me FL was made a snake look like it would have been made a a cross or a dove or a some kind of a Venom to Golden all this the way God does things but you see if you make one greater than the other one look what you're losing and that's our problem we need healing of the body there's not a person in here from the least baby in here that today that does not have something physically wrong with you I don't care how young you are there's something in there eating its way at you and it come because of sin job said though my skin worms destroy this body he it yet in my flesh I'll see God job understood hey where is it worms come from if they don't involve you in the hurry that's right right it ain't a bug somewhere else it crawls up and bites you and then you start rottening and here comes excuse me for the plain language but here comes the maggots and the things the worms that eat you up it's inside your body you know we talk about cancer you know that they say medically speaking that everybody has cancer cells it's just the fact of your immune system will fight that to keep it suppressed from being able to come up and take you whereas other people get a bump a scar a burus or something happens and here comes a cancer that's not they don't have enough to take it away and they say now that's seven times in your lifetime you will face a situation that means cancer is very present well that's what kills people see you go down the sisters they go down to get a mograph and and they say you're cancer free go back in 3 months and they find a knot see all it means is that there's not 800 and something thousand sales orever what they call it the great big thing it takes that many to show up on the Machinery so you already got it before you all right you understand so we all need healing right everybody understand we all need healing I don't care how much you feel how good you feel I feel mighty good for 70 years old I do I feel good but you know I know that things are eating away at this body we see why is it I can't believe because I'm making salvation one thing and I'm making that a confession with my mouth and a believing in my heart which is correct come on right Romans what is it 10 the mouth confession is made under salvation but you must believe in your heart confessing with a mouth won't save you that's right you got to confess with your mouth believe in your heart right you got to put them together but you see we do that but then when it comes to the healing of our bodies what do we say the doctor said now we goofed up right there hey come on folks I go to doctor too so I'm not thr off we're not against doctors thank God for doctors I'm not going to them when they won't believe in God being the Healer I've walked away from them and it's just that's all right that's your business but I want to go to one that talks about healing and him talking about helping me cuz if he he's got any sense at all he knows he can't heal you I listen to Prophet the other day and I thought man how in the world could explain something that wonderful you know you take penicillin and stuff you know antibiotics you rub it on shores and things you know that I listen to him the other day and he said it like this he said if antibiotics are are are penicillin what he was really saying he said if that's what heals you he said then why don't you look at a guy that's got a big cut on his arm and he says he dies you know and you in bomb him and said 3 months later you put penicillin where that cut was at said it won't heal it right he said well of course it w CU he dead you ain't getting what he's saying either right the penicillin is not healing right it takes a creation of cells and only God can create amen you get a cut put something on it clean it keep it clean right that's right and God will heal it you break a bone the doctor sets it but he can't heal that bone takes God to be the healer but see we put it on that or we put it on what the doctor says and you better believe for sure cuz you know enough about it anyway you're if you're 50 years old you know for sure all the doctors 90% of them doing trying to get you money that's right right come on we're honest what I said I got doctors I go to her sure I tell them hey long as it's not contrary to what I believe I will do what you say they told me I had leukemia I said oky dokie that's what you you say I don't believe it but I said I'm not taking your chemo they didn't like it you know got shaky finally one of them he said well Sam and he's a good Christian guy and he said Sam that's better now it was to be I said Doctor you're in the business and I'm in the business you sat and look at them you see them every day they're dying taking your chemo I'm in the business of burying and then I said you know for sure it's not doing any good he said well Sam I listen I'll do anything you say except something contrary to what God says right well that guy so friendly with me was up at the hospital one day he goes all the way across the the emergency room thing we were in there with somebody else getting doing he comes all the way out come out hey Sam how you doing don't even charge me no feed or nothing Lord go in and talk have a good time cuz I love good doctors amen but he said say I can't heal nobody right I said we know that doc you can help us you set the bone you sew it up you clean it up but that penicillin ain't going to do it that's right that antibiotics and we take them right it takes God to heal but do we look at it like that God is the Healer now what am I getting at one thing we put the basis of our Salvation upon the confession of our mouth and the believing in our heart we don't put it upon no man right we don't put it on what anybody else says right now you can say you know what I'm talking about cuz the Bible said no man can call Jesus the Christ accepted me by the holy ghost that scripture all right but if I'm just saying what the sister said I'm saying what the brother said that has nothing to do with it that's right I must say what God says God says I'm Healed God say I'm saved let me say what he says [Music] amen well we'll see when they put you down to the Undertaker well don't worry about it I've got an upper taker done care of that see that's one thing don't bother me you may be afraid of it but that don't bother me that has nothing to do that's right I've had a 30 out 6 go off that close to my head and splatter barking and led into my head and I just climbed up in the tree and went on Hunting had a deer stand to fall out about 20 something feet up as I was going it kept slipping I realized it was falling and I just throwed my gun in the honey sucle patch down below me cuz I didn't want to go down with it and when I did I just big enough I just reached out like that and grabbed a limb I just swung around the tree walked right down this looked like i' done it purposely walked down picked up my gun and said you go home no went down found me another deer stand crawled up on it sat down finish the day why because the fear is not there fear have torment you afraid of something that's what's going to get you you afraid of cancer doctor will tell you doctor will tell you to hurry if you're afraid of a sickness it's going to get you that's right amen don't be afraid of it Bluff it nothing else stand up against it would you see Jehovah rapi I am the Lord that Health thy diseases let's look at that one cuz we're hung right there I guess Jehovah RI Exodus 15 remember now what I'm saying the point I'm getting across all of these are Old Testament scriptures and in the Old Testament God was appearing to mankind right to show mankind what was needed for the time do you understand so he I said he didn't show Abraham on the mountain Jehovah J Jehovah rapi why he didn't need a Healer he needed a sacrifice right so he showed him a sacrifice Moses down in in the the the Journey coming out he had a deliverer that had done brought him out of Egypt right he had a sacrifice already made he had the atonements in the things but he needed a healer look at Exodus 15:26 look at 25 now this is Moses and what he's doing he's asking him what to drink and the things you know the bitter water and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him showed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them and he said if thou Wilt G diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God and Willl do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his Commandments and keep all of his statutes now watch him if you do these things each one of those are involved with the Jehovah Banner Jehovah with tiu Jehovah see there each one involved in it that's why I ask you if you would I'm asking you to do it over and over is read the 23rd psalm just read it over and over and over you'll find all the Redemptive names of God dealing in in Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me the light down Le go on read it watch and we'll do which is right in his sight and will give ear to his Commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that Health thee now from that is derived because of the interpretation of what it's saying there is derived the meaning of Jehovah rapi the Lord that Health all of thy diseases it's not written out there in language a lot of these are written in plain language but it's just showing you in Psalms it said the Lord is my shepherd all right that's one of the meanings of the word Jehovah uh what is it Jehovah uh Ray it means the Lord is Our Shepherd it's whatever is needed for the time what did Moses this need with the children of Israel 2 and a half million they didn't have doctors and nurses and hospitals and but they had a man that had contact with God and when they needed healing they could go to that man didn't make that man anything did it made God a great God that would have a Healer there and would be the Lord that would Health all thy diseases that would take place and they could pull from that as we take all of the examples as it was saying to where that they would build a a a snake and stick it up and God would honor that we're like we're reading here that they couldn't drink the water so he tells Moses just take a stick down and throw it into the water now if Moses would have said I tell you what now Lord It's a Long ways over under on that side that Hill get that stick and it's hot so I'll just throw a rock now that's kind of the way we talk right Lord you take what I got or leave it wasn't that what Cain said in the garden Lord I've done all I'm going to do you either take what I given to you or forget it you know what happened God forgot it right gave honor to abble and wouldn't have came like the prophet was saying one day about Moses when he was there in you know the uh at the burning bush and God said take off your shoes he said Lord that dirt and sand is hot I just take my hat off he said God had never spoke to him right why cuz he told him what to do that's right God tells you what to do you do what he said it don't make no difference that's right if he tells you to do it you do what he said don't try to figure it out now this is a better way now Lord that doctor told me when I went that time for about my kneecaps and things and the doctor proved the x-rays and all the things he said Sam I'm just going to have to take your kneecaps off one of these days that was before the day came of what they've done to my wife you know to do the complete knee surgery and put you in a brand new knee and everything you know I still ain't found that grease fitting they can pump any grease and where her legs would work okay they don't make them but you know but that the doctor he said I'll take your kneecaps off I looked at him and I laughed at him and this was a specialist not just a regular MD he was a a what do you call a a bone doctor and uh or was it Orthopedic that what it is you he was a specialist and he was an Old Gentleman sensibly nice talking guy you know and I liked him but he said I'll take your knec I said you won't never take my kneecaps on he just lied back he said I done showed you they were out I said I don't care what you say you ain't taking my kneecaps off well I walked out of the office you know I'm still hbling I go back you've heard me tell it I'll go back to my regular MD and he said Sam my guy's a specialist I said I don't care what he is he ain't taking my C off I said you get me off of my feet for 3 days and I'll prove it to you he said I ain't going to do it I'll give you two he said because he says you got crippin arthritis he said if you got it you sat down you know it's true he was right he said if you sit down you lock up won't never move I said Doctor all I got is irritated kneecaps get me off of my feet you know instead of having to go to J Motors man you walking on that concrete and do it I took two days off you know what I done I went back to G motor you know what I still got my KN I spent about 30 something years ago close to 40 again praise the Lord you know I guess that doctor he probably ain't practicing now I wish I know for sure you know I'd go back and head and say Doc I still got my knap so I was depending upon what God was saying it's fine to have your confidence in doctors if you don't there's no need to going to them yeah but the thing of it was I was depending upon what Moses said Moses said God what I need God said I'm the Lord that Health all of thy diseases 40 years and their clothes growed with them now you say I just can't understand it okay you're done believe blessing I don't mean to be nce to or hateful tell the truth truth is better understood you don't believe that that the Red Sea opened up you believe that they walked across on this sea of Ridge well then explain how pharaoh and his army got grounded in two Ines of water right right right that's what they say they say they just went up to a place and went across the sea a re and just drove across one my Bible says Pharaoh Army got drowned you making it a greater Miracle than it is if you leave it alone you let God wall it up you go across when you facing death or whatever remember it's God that we're dealing with not man righten the doctor says like the you've heard the prophet tell about which was FF Bosworth's daughter son I think now but anyhow he said about how that lady told him said he never anybody that a doctor inst went that low you know when your blood pressures and and they raised up and he said honey you're looking at what the doctor taught you but I'm looking at the promises of God and the baby walk come out of there I saw a man one time up in Tennessee up there which I was begging to to what they wanted him to do you look down upon his foot and you could see between his toes it had rotten out I ain't talking about out at the toe I'm talking about up in here the skin and everything was gone it had eat down in and they begged him and he had Gang Green setting up in the his leg They begged him to please let him take his leg off it was the only hope they had a saving him he said I'll walk out of this Hospital on this lag or I'll die in here one you know what about 3 months later he walked out of there why because he had something to hold on to man my neph nephew you know most of you that he had to have the double lung transplant because he had the the disease and that you know he finally had to have a double lung but when he was a little bit baby they told him not even to get to don't even get no thing said I D in the hospital with him you know at the ech still not think of it but anyhow they said don't he said could I you know do I need to buy this machine do I need to the doctor said look son the baby can't live said don't buy nothing you'll be back they brought the little boy home I walked into the yard went to see him and I realized that I couldn't pray there not if there was anything wrong they was good people that's fine but I realized that I couldn't pray there you know what I done I picked up the little fell he was just I don't know might have been 6 months old or whatever he just wouldn't him that much my wife said two months old I pick him up you know what I do I'll go out in the yard I go out in the yard and I just walk around with him and I prayed and I said Lord It's little fell he ain't done nothing wrong you know reached down in healing make him be all right walk back in the house and laid him down went on home you know what he got better you know what he Liv for many years he's 40 now but many years ago many years after then he was in the hospital up in Gainsville and old brother Ben Howard ran into up her he said where you going he I said I'm going down here and pray for my neph my nephew he said well I I want you to go with me to pray I thank for his mother and he said we'll just go together I said okay so we go down we pray for his mother we walk in and and there was my little nephew his lungs was filling up it's whatever the disease what is sisters fibrosis is that the word for his lungs you fell up from they fell up from the inside that's the reason the problem they fill up from the inside and there's no way to get it out or nothing and they're laid and they was expecting him to die under oxygen tent not just oxygen we just simply prayed a prayor and you know what he said here a while back told somebody he said Old Charlotte is that right said Sam prayed for me and God touched me those lungs filled up yes and they done double lung transplant and you know that one of those lungs was a solid Mass you had Liv many years off of a one and not supposed to live over 21 I think was right now he's 40 years old what is it what am I talking about God is the Healer if we believe it that's right but we're not putting it on the same basis as a Salvation why not as I said this morning I keep saying it that I said it today you beat him to pieces that would not have healed us you see yeah but the Bible say by Stripes I'm Healed there is no healing without the Salvation you can't preach salvation without preaching healing you can't preach healing without preaching salvation cuz he said I'm the Lord that Health all the th diseases but do we believe it that way something goes wrong what's the first thing I'll go see what the doctor say well all right then you find the quotes you know that's what we like to do we trying to prop up our unbelief quotes you find a quote where the Prophet said the first Duty you have is to go to doctor that's what your Prophet said and I believe it go to the doctor no problems that's why I love I love for you to go to the doctor the doctor says you got this and then you pray for it and you don't got it no more now what happened I I for that doctor to say you got so and so and then when you believe it and see that you're healed it's wonderful because you're making him testify yes I am the Lord that Health all of thy diseases Moses take these two and two and a half million people you take them and you lead them 40 years yes at the end of 40 years they're still wearing the same clothes none of you wouldn't raised like most of us was raised I had three brothers ahead of me hand me down from Brother one the brother two the brother three and brother four my patches had patches on the patches but I was glad to have them I at least covered up they took my daddy's shoes and the old orange lash and and cut off the shoe and nailed it back together and made my brother the oldest one a pair of shoes all he had was a big old heel my sisters get mad CA in school and hear them come down the hall cuz all he's walking on with he but you don't what we made it you know I mean my mother raised nine of us my dad died when I was five and she raised us and you know what she wouldn't have no weire check I was working and already married before I could ever talked my mother into realizing that there was nine of us plus the husband wife situ situation 18 of us working paying the government and I said mom look at it it's not a disgrace for you to go down there and take what they're giving you we paying for it and you know what she finally did but you know she wouldn't do it when we was coming up cuz that was a disgrace but you know what she evidently done pretty good because they's still seven out of nine living and I'm the baby so it means that a lot of them older than I am but you know they're still kicking and she raised all of us why because she believed God to take care of us but listen folks I'm just trying to get the point across we'll end it see we believe one thing is greater than the other you're talking about almighty God you're not talking about human fire and presidents vice presidents and and CEOs and and you ain't talking about junk that's right you're talking about almighty God if he can save you why couldn't he heal you right but do you believe it that way well I asked the doctor now see you done messed up you didn't ask a real doctor real doctor and Isaiah 53 said by CH I'm Healed 12 or 13 years old I had romatic fever that's supposed to be a heart conditioned with the blood in the situation I can remember when I was out of school and all swelled up and all kind of thing but you know my mom and somebody got to praying for me and you know what they can't find it today I used to have to take 9 500 MGR of antibiotics to be able to get my teeth cleaned I took six of them before I went to the doctor and three of them when I got home to just get my teeth cleaned and I told that doctor that dentist one day I said man this is crazy who was taking care of me that's what I told him I said who was taking care of me before you and the doctor found out I had problems right he said I'm going to get on the phone he got on the phone sit right there with me called the doctor that I went to and he said Doctor do we need to give him these antibiotics he said that's Sam ain't it said yeah he said forget it you don't have to take no more he said cuz I got his records here and we can't can't find a thing they can't they can't they can't find nothing about rheumatic fever in my body why because he's a god it health do we believe it but see we try to figure it out that sister Trudy was telling me just a simple point a while ago remember last Sunday we baptized little n well she was praying Lord if if that's you dealing with her to get baptized you let her ask me again she jumped right up in the seat said Mama are we going and I want to get baptized she said that quick he answered her prayer amen well why can't we believe it see we try to figure it out don't try to figure God out believe what he says well in a way he's a Healer no he's not in a Healer in a way but I can't understand our human doing mine yours all of us if he can save me why can't he heal me now I believe the rest of it you know the story I don't believe in getting another body I know that's taught in the denominations and things that we're going to get a new body well what do you need a new body for when I can prove to you in the Bible that Jesus had nail prints in his hands after his resurrection you said well we're going to have to get us a new body you know why because you don't believe God can redeem this one now if he created why would he have trouble healing it and if he healing why would he have trouble changing it one day cuz my Bible said we' be changed in a moment the twinkling of an eye why can't we believe what he's already said what do you want him to do get up the cross and die again no Nicodemus why can't you believe it because he didn't have the believer inside come on let's stand together if he's Jehovah Gyra he's Jehovah RI if he's Jehovah RI he's Jehovah re he's Jehovah tishin you he's all of those titles his name is Jesus he's a rose of Shar in the lily of the valley am I quot in scripture he's the alpha the Omega the beginning and the end he's all and everything but what's his name he said I come in my father's name now I'm a Dale my kids wouldn't a cies we didn't name one of them Mill you know what their verth certificate says way Dale Terence dale anad dale why cuz it's Dale why cuz that's Dale you said I come in my father's name well his father must name must have been Jesus he said that's too much said you're Jesus only no sir re now I differ we there I'm Not Jesus only CU Jesus only don't believe that that there was a father existing there was any anything like the Old Testament Father and Son and Holy Ghost they don't believe in it that way they believe in one like a finger I know the doctrine sometime but you see he said ask anything in my name well his name is Jesus or was it over in the book of Acts when the man was healed and what did they say said his name and faith in his name hath made this man whole his name is Jesus what do we got go ahead P 190 and
