40 days he said in the resurrection said then we'll be up in heaven together so but we are glad to have you have you with us now the Lord willing This Afternoon brother uh Gabriel and I don't know his last name but remember he was here with us about six or eight months ago or somewhere around there last year and he's coming this evening so you better come find you a seat because brother Reyes in the group brother Samuel and him will be here with us this afternoon uh he may have to use an interpreter I don't think he will but may have to use for them cuz they'll be bringing the crowd so you better find you a seat somewhere hang on to it cuz there'll be a good many of them amen but let you know do it okay get never announcement I can't either of way uh brother Terrence had done announced brother uh Don's in the nursing home there in Crawford so if you uh you know if you want to get a chance to go by it's not too far from where he was and brother Ray can tell you in to hurry where it's at cuz it's couple couple miles from his house but uh you know he's there for a little while so remember that two now children please don't don't want to go in to the uh out in the playground this afternoon because it's you know it's too much snow and too dangerous so be careful around here we come up and cleaned off as much as we could to get the the ice back and stuff like that but uh you know just be careful around here because you could slip and fall you know we appreciate the the the Lord for not letting the power go off and doing and just leaving it to where we got the snow and a little ice but we really appreciate if You' like turning your scriptures turn to Revelations 1 where we've been reading and then we'll go to I'm going to read four places so so it'll be Revelations 1 Hebrews 1 Psalms 37 excuse me 34 Psalms 3 4: 7 and Matthew 11 so now we'll read it and then we'll give you an opportunity to get back to the next one you know as we we're doing it all right so let's pray father we thank you for this day and the time that we have we thank you for your love and your grace unto us and Lord we pray that you would just bless us now with your presence as we try to speak about you and to Lord to be able to see you Lord living among us and guiding us is what we desire forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us Lord and just bless each one bless those that are not here that wouldn't able to get here so just be with each one be with Brother Dean there as he's ministering for his brother and just bless and God we love you and just come now as we read your word and you speak to our hearts and our lives we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen so we'll go to Revelations 1 first then we'll go to Hebrews 1 and uh so Revelations 1 we've been reading for a while it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him now who gave the Revelation amen we're not trinitarians we're not this that or the other we're we're just you know doing the best we can to understand the word right but this was the Revelation all right the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his son servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now what is the time at the hand the prophet of God we covered it where he said when the word is revealed you know the time is at hand when the word is made known all right now let's go to to Hebrews one Hebrews 1 verse 13 and 14 but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foot to he's talking about the Angels now what are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be hirs of Salvation and that's what angels are sent for right okay now we go to Matthew 4 then we'll go to Psalms either way you we go to Matthew 4 and then we read it in Psalms Matthew 4:1 now I'm just getting a point here to where we can get to it after what verse 11 said then the devil leaveth him now you remember he's out in the Temptation in the wilderness and the things that's taking place you know the tempting of the Lord Jesus and he said and then the Lev devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him amen Angels Came and ministered to the Lord Jesus all right and we read that they Minister into the hours of Salvation right all right so now let's go to Psalms 34 and we'll Express more about it in a moment but you'll notice always that the biggest percentage of the time brother Brandon will say Angels plural right the scripture says Angel see the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him and deliverthat he's telling you what it is it takes all of the Angels right to make that angel amen all right so he's correcting what he say in the angels of God you may be seated Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now you can see all we got laying up here that we got a bunch you know for everybody to uh to read on so if if you don't understand what I'm saying at least you can read what the prophet had to say and that's the way I love it because I that's where I get what I preach on and what I what I see and and we see one more back there the sister came in so we I guess you heard the announcement we always say sister that when you come you're just one of us you know so make yourself at home man now I spoke back before the first of the year somewhere in there on a message and I said I would get back to it because it was a hard thing to understand and uh so I want to go back over that and make sure you understand but the foundation for this message was uh back when I was preaching and I I titled it then Angelic beings and that was the title back a few months ago and know and uh so I want to continue I want to make sure you understand what I'm saying now whether you believe it or not I can't I can't reveal it and whether you believe it or not is up to you and you know if you don't believe it fine just uh just tell me you don't believe it that's that's all right but uh you know let's see what the prophet had to say and I've never tried to convince anybody I just try to speak what I believe and that way then people can uh hear and have an opportunity and we get a good B bit of response back from people reading one just there moment ago and and uh you you know it I I I appreciate the response back and I appreciate you talking to me and telling me whether or not you agree cuz I want you to tell me not go tell everybody else you know you go tell everybody else you don't agree with me and then still come here you got a problem and then all it'll do just create a problem with me come just tell me I don't agree with you that's no problem my wife tells me that a lot of times you I don't agree with you about that that's all right she's got her opinion I'm not one that beats her over the head with it you know and uh you know she allows me to run things around the house like the vacuum cleaner and the washing machine and stuff like that anyway I mean you know so that's that's all right that's just a joke you know it's just a point you know that I want her to have her Holy Ghost and her Revelation all right I believe in the sisters having a revelation just as well as the brothers and you're sisters you're not going in the Rapture just because your husband goes this is not a package deal if your husband goes and you get ride on his back no that's not it it's it's it's got to be revealed to you you know and you got to have just whether the children and everything you've got to have your own Holy Ghost you got to have your own Revelation all right so then uh we just leave it that way now as I said I I wanted to to cover some things and to to make sure you understand I was just talking a little bit while they were getting to the things you know uh give out and all like that but now see the the main a couple of main things I want you to listen to is brother random said on the rising of the sun there number one on your notes that the same word that spoke of the groom speaks of the bride all right same word speak speak of the groom speaks of the bride all right so if we want to find ourselves we don't have to isolate scriptures that would talk see and and we think that we would really enjoy that but you know it that must just be about Jesus you know but the scriptures that spoke of him speak of us the speak that speak of us speaks of him why because it's him in us what we've been there in Revelations 1 as we were trying to cover you know Revelation one there where at 13 and all where it's one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man G about the PS with a golden girdle and the prophet said that's the bride all right so then that's just we say well that's the bride now now it's Christ in the bride right you know what he's saying that's right see we we nothing without him if he's not in us we're nothing anyway that's just the way it goes all right but now see if it speaks of him then we can put ourselves there now like what I've tried to tell you about the Book of Revelation if you want to find yourself in the Bible read the book of Revelation the book that everybody was told to stay away from the book that the devil doesn't want you to read to see yourself amen because show me in the Book of Revelation where Jesus Christ is ever standing by himself we haven't got down to it yet to where we get to it but you say well what about the lamb well that L lamb had seven horns and seven eyes and your Prophet said the lamb came from the church ages so we got to get into a lot to understand that all right you say well what about Revelations 10:1 you know that would be Christ we agreed all right but brother BR said it was the same as Revelations 1113 now we're right back where we started at that you can see Christ in the Book of Revelations cuz the prophet said if you don't see Christ in every verse go back and read it again all right now so that's the point that that we're getting at now I gave you one there on number two on the number is why Christ speak uh where brother brand says that and he uses the word us see we we read it to where it says you know uh that it bu thee up cuz that was Jesus on the the Temptation we were reading right down below there in Matthew a moment ago and and he said the angel the devil told an angel to Bear thee up L you dash your foot against the stone you know well brother random says he'll bear us up us up Les we do the same thing you know L we Dash our foot against the soul well now those are the things I want you to uh see and then verse number three there see not air with a shook the word to be fulfilled in this day is what we're dealing with amen now to be fulfilled in this day right all right then we are the people that are the Living Word of the Day of where we're at right all right we're the manifestation upon Earth of of the Lord Jesus Christ and brother randam said if these people talk about oil in their for you know on the forehead blood in their hands or whatever you know back and forth said they're not realizing that they're saying that the Corporal body is here and he said that's contrary to scripture he said cuz we meet the Corporal body in the are so then it's going to have to be in you and me to be here see all right now it's going to be fulfilled in this day all right now as I said I preached on this back a while ago and I'm still on it and U we were talking about the angel that come to John on patas and and a lot of people of the message is beginning to get stronger and stronger that they are saying that that was brother Bram that come to John on patmas now uh you got two or three different problems there with trying to understand that and I'm not contrary to nobody I just preach here what I believe all right if they want to listen that's fine but and if you differ that's fine but I know brother randam was a prophet and I know the quotes brother random said that it was a prophet that come to John O Batman I I know that I know what he's saying and I I know for certain but be careful because see you would have pre-existence right cuz brother brandham was born here in our day about 199 or somewhere and see you're saying that he was back there with John right well you know I mean really uh at least and and I don't throw off on nobody but I I don't believe that people are literally because I don't believe we're that dumb people but maybe we are but I don't believe that people are literally believing that brother brandom actually come and stood there in a human body right they're trying to explain something right and and all right but I see that and like I've told you brother random was waiting for the mighty one to come right you got to divide his ministry for three and A2 I mean for the the uh uh 30 something years that he was preaching and trying to get us back to the faith of the fathers and his message didn't begin until the seals broke so he was waiting on that mighty one to come would it me that mighty one was the one that come to John on Pat cuz the mighty one would be the prophet he brother R was a prophet a son of man but the Lord Jesus Christ in the prophet and by coming down in the way that he came to appear to John to bring these things to him then it would be you know that he would be it would be the prophetic Ministry that you're dealing with not the human flesh I I don't think most of people believe that the human flesh surely don't believe that that the human flesh would stand there with John on patmas because you got pre-existence is you got a lot of things that are are are messing up but see I I believe that that angel was the Prophet okay now then that would include every Prophet you know all right and see if it's not going to change whether we're going to go into Rapture or not what we believe about the but the main thing is to believe whether or not God came to him that's been my point my Point's not whether or not that was brother brandom it come to John I want to know what that angel told brother Brandon right right now I want to know what that is see all right because see what greater honor could we give to brother brandom see people would say well brother Dale you're degrading brother brandom because you don't believe that he was the one no no I'm just leaving it alone and letting it go because what's the greatest honor for me to know that he come to John and stood over there with him physically whatever would that change me but whatever the that brother random told me and you right some people think that this brother Brandon was transferred over there in spirit real and things it's all right my point is what did he say come on I want to know what the angel of the Lord said to me right behold I send you Elijah the Prophet come on see I I want to know that it's not what you know whether Somebody went here or somebody went over there it's it's kind of like Wade and I were talking about it one day and you got problems see because what what are you going to do with brother brandham when he was preaching that the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost now that can't be take taken to John on patmas cuz it wasn't true you you you better get it in the correct line right and like I'm saying I'm not arguing with nobody there no problems I'm just stating to my people what I believe that I want to know what God told brother Brandon because I've been through it and shown you that even though the angel as we read a moment ago come to John on patas dur in Revelations 1 all right but you know that angel couldn't reveal a thing to John he could tell John right right he could announce it right but he couldn't reveal it right brother Ram can't reveal anything to you amen I've got the quotes in here where brother Ram said it he said the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word right we see then once you're trying to make things and you know see I've just tried to make myself clear see I believe the most important thing is not who it was that came to John but who was it that come to brother brandom that's right because if you're going to say that that he did tell John you got to back up to find out who was that told G brother Bram to go tell John so then I want to talk to that person I want to know that deal you know amen because only the Holy Ghost can reveal the word amen go see like I said there in the Book of Revelations in in chapter one see when the angel come to John and told John that didn't end it the the Lord Jesus came on the scene in chapter one read your Bible that's right he came on the scene there well if he don't come on the scene in our hearts and loud what does it matter who tells us what that's right amen that's right almighty God stood on Earth and told a lot of things but what did that do to people that's right did that convert one person while he was here no no no I never converted one person while he's on Earthen you know what I'm saying he never gave the new birth to nobody cuz he couldn't give the new birth cuz he hadn't died yet it was inside of him amen all right that's all I've been trying to to get you to see about it but we'll get over in a minute and and jump off but see in the Book of Revelation you see the key to all of the Bible like I said to about uh in Genesis with Moses god came on the scene right and went down and delivered the children of Israel right righten now Moses couldn't do that right the one that said I'll go with you amen and said my angel will go with you and said you better fear him because my name is in him well evidently that must have been Jesus Christ now not Jesus the Flesh on that's right brother BR said the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not the revelation of Jesus it's not the revelation of Christ that's right amen cuz you'd be a Oneness when you run those channels that's right but when he said it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is almighty God Amen so then we're dealing with the full revelation of the Bible you're putting something on other words if you looking at brother Brandon being there you're putting something on to some kind of a thing you can nail down instead of listening to what he's saying amen that's right instead of believing that see and I know it's it's around the country you know and everybody's doing it well that's all right I'm just I just tell you what I believe amen I have no problems with these others that want to believe anything do you want to believe your big toes God that's all right just don't expect me to worship it that's right bless that's that's just the way I am I'm plain I'm too old to not be see the entire Bible then be the Revelation Jesus Christ number three a on your notes now as you remember A's come in here when I add notes you looking at number three and then you look at 3A okay and what he bre around and say the Holy Ghost is the only revealer amen of the word amen right now Jesus brother R I can give you that word brother said Jesus said my own life did not reveal that unto thee amen that's right so the father's got to reveal that's right amen all right who are we depending upon for the Revelation amen right somebody can come and make things know thank God right that's right thank God for the making known to us right you know I'm glad they made a an a model you know what somebody made that known one day but I sure don't want it brother D's got one and he he loves to ride in it that's fine I'll ride with him but I'm not going to New York in a sucker I'm just not going to do it I'll fly he drive but now listen get to point now and we'll get on to what we're talking about all right see we read in Hebrews 1 and 13- 14 especially verse 14 that the angels of God are given right to minister unto the ARs of Salvation amen thank you angels are not giving everybody right right I know they got the beautiful pictures and they got all these things and if you'll notice 90% of is women and I don't agree with that you know and they got Gloria setting it to now when you put out your little little scene at Christmas you know and you get everybody there and then they set this little Gloria down this little female angel you know cuz they're getting that all in the mind of the kids where when the kids grow up they well they was an angel there could that have been the angel that announced us that he was to be born over there you know you know you believe what you want to I'm not trying to destroy the kids' little thoughts it's adults I'm dealing with not kids that's right but you see then what are we trying to do there's no school no scholar no man r r says how well educated or guard or anything else he can't teach you anything that's right sir it takes a holy ghost so that's the main thing I want is the Holy Ghost and I ain't worried about the rest of it cuz he'll reveal it right as long as I wait on them all right now see only the redeemed have angels I like I said we see the pictures and we see a little kid leaning over a thing you know and we see this Angel and it's hovering over you know that's all well and good that's all right um people write books and they say uh I won't call it but anyhow one big man wrote a book and they had had a child that died real young like a little girl I think it was and they wrote a a book about angels you know well I think that my grandkids are angels I think my great grandchild is Angels but it's like I've always told you they're Halos held up by horns right you know my kids are angels they're H they're held up by horns my wife don't have no horns she's wore them off on pushing me around trying to keep me straight but now are you understanding I say them things that just get you to click away from something else cuz it you know you get to thinking on the wrong thing all right now brother random says everyone now he gave that was 1950 uh 1964 um on questions and answers number four on your notes where he says now it isn't promised that Sinners has Angels it's only the redeemed have Angels see because the scripture says that they're to minister into the hours of salvation that's right all right now he goes on in 1953 on the resurrection I don't think he was wrong I believe he was right and he says it this way God always sends his warning just before the coming of Jesus he sent an angel down Out Of Heaven by the name of Gabriel now minor Angels come my yes you see Angels everyone has a guardian angel according to the scripture see Jesus said their Angels always behold my father's face which is in heaven now that's what I say I don't believe everybody's got Angels you can say well I believe they're farther little children and things so you like to make things fit uh I i' rather this deal with the Bible and and just say you know that the redeemed have Angels well that angel that you have your Prophet said come to you his angel came to him when he was born there in that cabin and it was a light right it was a light that came in the room amen and it was the angel of the Lord he said and finally he met that angel of the Lord and I've got it in there I gave them to you the other day the prophet said the reason we don't see Angels is we're not dedicated enough he said when I see the angel of the Lord now this is your Prophet quot it he said when I see the angel of the Lord is when I'm fasting and praying see because there there's a supernatural realm there that you you you you know you got to do now I want to say this and then I'll repeat it and repeat it and repeat it I've even got quotes in here well that's the next one on down but see a lot of people says well you know uh the angels of the Lord they say I just the Holy Ghost well right now I going to say this and then we'll read what your Prophet said let's see if it fits in there see then there's all kind of forms of angels right all right and we'll get to it as we go through it we've been through it there are angels and brother Ram called his Angel a minor Angel that's up to him now you know what he called him one time I'll give it to you a while he called him the one with the healing right y he called it the healing Angel yep cuz there's angels for everything you know wormwood you know if God needed water to destroy the world you know he'd get wor wormwood cuz he destroyed it first time there's Angels assigned to those things and may not be used but one time right well you know they're not offended no we was listening last night where brother Brown was talking about the brother that kind of got offended at at what he had said to him one day you know and he just fell over dead well he went down and be like a lot of us were blessed God let him lay there call The Undertaker yeah he went against me no he goes down and prays for him God raises him up well I heard later the man got offended and says that that didn't happen exactly like that that's his business that ain't mine ain't nothing to me that's right but you see there's Angels because in the beginning that was the first thing that's what made him God right he created angels and they worship we think he probably created four you know oh when I'll brother day make more okay six I can name you more of that out of the Bible right y but you see he created a large amount of angels amen and assigned them with the things that they would be each one dealing with we'll get to it in a minute amen but then it goes upward and he calls it degrees we'll read that in a minute sure he calls it levels see sure you got angels and then you got Earthly Angels which are Church age Messengers and preachers are angels and you're an angel to your to someone you're trying to help and then there's judgment Angels then there cherubims yes there seraphim there's archangels Y and Jesus is even the angel of the Covenant right so there's Angels the prophet said one day we'll look and they'll be right here around us and we'll see them that's right he said that's what he said he said reason we don't see him is we don't dedicate ourselves that's what he said now quoting him he said when that angel comes to me is when I'm fasting and praying if you like that quote I'll be glad to get it for you but now listen look down on the next one it's obeying the voice of an Angel 1950 there's a lot on these but I just chose one to bring back to us someone said not long ago said to me said brother randam Angels was ministering spirits in the Old Testament oh my now look but since the Holy Spirit has come we don't have ministering Angels anymore now that's what people believe right all right now what did he say he talks about now this is not you know this is not worship of angels and things he's talking about angels being ministers to the church going down to the next paragraph and see you it's in the same message on the next paragraph said you think of Mary when he Gable Now watch how close brother brandom will be because when he asked you asked you asked a prophet a question remember it's God answering the question right right if he really yields himself so look how close he was well you think of Mary when Gabriel came down oh wait a minute brother randam got you there cuz Mary was still in the Old Testament cuz the New Testament had come into being yet look how close he makes it well think of Mary when Gabriel came down and spoke to her about the Virgin birth of the Savior are Zachariah in the temple that's still under the Old Testament are well now watching see he catches it and he knows somebody's listening he says or well after the Holy Ghost come now he moves into the New Testament room and many he believes that Philip had the Holy Ghost well we all believe that don't we well when he was down at Samaria preaching having a Revival was it the holy ghost that came to him or did the angel of the Lord touch him and say go to the desert Gosa the angel of the Lord came to him is that true it was the angel of the Lord that came to him right well everyone would believe that great St Peter the Apostle had the Holy Ghost he had the keys to the kingdom and he had the Holy Spirit didn't he but but when he was in jail one night and in prison and down at John Mark's house they were having a prayer meeting it was the angel of the Lord who came in and touched him and led not the Holy Ghost the angel of the Lord came in right right okay are you listening to what he's saying now right like I said now there's Angels there's Angels there's Angels there's angels and each one has an assigned thing to do so it wasn't the holy ghost that just up in the jail now when not an angel come down amen right amen but see we don't believe they're real we think it's just well brother the reason people say it they don't see Angels right huh you know here in America we have a saying of if I can't see it I don't what is that Missouri if I can't see it I don't believe it old man at work you know was talking about brother Mo was talking to him and tell you about that he was you know he said why they didn't go up in to the Moon they just went out there in the desert and sat down somewhere well if they able to fly up and go out in the desert to be fly somewhere else but see that was his point you couldn't convince him you can't convince people that they're Angels amen well cuz they never seen one and never seen one you don't believe it you believe in Pink Elephants no Brother D but a lot of you got drunk and believed in them yeah right you know some of you life and some don't cuz I don't guess you saw pink elephants when you was drunk but what else did you see blue ones no but you see there are angels here amen that's right they're right here in the building with us the prophet said your eyes will open one day am and you'll see see it amen right you see those angels are real they're not just a thought of your imagination right you no watch him now as he gets over look over on 68 obey the voice of the Angel 1950 we know Paul had the Holy Ghost you believe that well when he was 14 days and nights upon the sea without any moon or stars and it was all dark and he went down into Galley to pray he went back and told the men be of good courage for the angel of God whose servant I am came to me last night and said Fe not Paul is that right not the Holy Spirit the angel of the Lord see an angel of God sent from God right look at it and then John the Revelator the whole book of Revelations when it was wrote he said I have sent my angel Jesus did and John fell down to worship the Angel and the Ang angel said stand up worship God see a true angel of God won't stand to be worshiped he said that he was of the prophets and was and was his fellow men that had been sent to signify these things therefore Angelic beings is ordained ministers of God to come to the Earth and bu record of God and they work through mortal beings y just as they did through Daniel and back through the ages there I believe it with all my heart is said all Angel of the Lord 1951 I want you to know that that that that angel of God is no more to do with me than it is to do with you he's talking about his Angel having something to do with us why because he's bringing the message to him to bring to us right right that is an angel sent down from heaven and if you don't believe angels are ministering spirits in the presence of God then you don't know the Bible yes sir someone said brother brandom angels as far the Old Testament why that's an era the new church had more Angels ministering than what the Old Testament did yes sir well you said the Holy Ghost leads the church that's the correct that's correct the Holy Ghost is over all now how many angels could you name coming up see Angels this angel that angel this angel that angel this and the Holy Spirit is ruling all of it right the holy spirit is the one that's in charge amen they're all under his supervision right see it's like he'd say justification to work of the holy spirit all right so you can say that the an angel brother Rand will call that angel that come to him the pillar of Fire right he'll call that angel that come to him Christ he'll call that angel that come to him a man but when we get down here in a minute he'll tell you the difference in it right we've read them to you that where are we at okay we'll going down to seven cuz we're in that we're read let's back up to that paragraph well he they said the Holy Ghost leads church that's correct the Holy Ghost is overall this is the body and it's true but there's also ministering Spirit sent from the presence of God we know that Mary and all those they seen angels and we know the new church seen Angels how about you say Do you believe Philip had the Holy Ghost Philip the Evangelist after the Pentecost he had the Holy Ghost didn't he but who was it told him to go to the desert Gaza the angel of the Lord came down is that right when he was having that Revival at Samaria Peter had the Holy Ghost you believe that and while they were having a prayer meeting for him at John Mark's house the angel of the Lord what was it a light shine in the window and the angel of the Lord touched him and dropped the Shackled off of him and put him outside of the building is that right and Peter had the Holy Ghost is that right in other words what's he saying this what I always say what did the Holy Ghost do it he got somebody assigned right amen y see I'm trying to make things real here on Earth we get over there then you can look back at it and say well brother Dale tried his best to tell me about this cuz I can see real things but see it takes somebody that's seen something to be able to talk to you about what they've seen so you know and I don't care to discuss that anymore Paul had the Holy Ghost you believe that whose servant I am all right going up to 78 I just keep my numbers right still in the angel of the Lord there another another message I think this uh e41 the whole book of Revelation was showed to John by an Angel I have sent my angel to testify that right so angels are ministering Spirits usually come in the form of lights and I truly personally as I started to say a while ago with my Bible over my heart I believe that the angel of God I've seen it since I was a little boy in that little cabin they told me he came come in and that came come in that you seen the picture that the lady draw last night of the little cabin where I was born he said now that won't make me any different right go on down obey the voice of the Angel these are these are two it would be good for you to listen to but God's gift is the holy spirit that came down in the form of an Angel now who would have told brother brandham about those things right why would he stand there and say and this is a man who had the Holy Ghost right this is a man that we believe at least in the 63 when the seals were broke that he would be coming to his adoption stage amen yes and the man stands there and says you know what I'm doing I'm waiting on him right amen y he calls it the angel of the Lord he calls it Christ he calls it the Holy Ghost he call it all right that's what confuses people y well what will come to it you go and get into that seal book sometimes and you get to listen and you keep you compare what happened and here's brother brandham sitting in a room now he tells you is nothing in the room y right but him in his Bible right right and yet he's writing notes off of uh Fox's book of martyr he's writing notes and brings it out off of of the uh what is it the predan fathers and you get sometimes and just run it through and check it all out and see what is all in that room he said the angel of the Lord was in the room the Holy Ghost was in the room right he just keeps naming different things that was in the room it's probably pretty crowded yeah I make I say that where you life and you life you know you'll remember that if you didn't life you wouldn't remember it so you remember what I'm saying I know what to do with things I make you make you think about something amen right see it wouldn't crowded in the room I'm just getting a point to you what all was there all right but listen what he says look down on to the next one obey his voice 1957113 paragraph or e13 and therefore friends as your brother that's all I am but God's gift is the spirit of God that came down in the form of an angel now he didn't have wings he looked like a man I heard him when he walked brother around illustration you just as that and walked on the floor and walked right over just as normal as any man and talks just like any man amen he comes time after time through the room and different places when I'm fasting and praying amen now listen to what he says expectations 19581 E6 number eight on your notes someone told me here not long ago said brother random said now why don't you give all the praise to the Holy Ghost and say that that's the Holy Spirit let's give praise to the Holy Spirit say that's the Holy Spirit I said my brother I must be truthful whether it's a holy spirit I said it's a gift sent from God that's right now I wish we'd bear on to that you know heavily right he calls it a gift up above there in that other message now he calls it a gift again right sent from God he never said he was the Holy Spirit never told me who he was that's what everybody who is he find out is name now you know that person name interesed in a thing in the world that's right what good does it matter what his name is but see I don't know his name now you done cut off your computer you know what I mean your brain's gone that's right you ain't listening listen to what he said amen he never said he was the Holy Spirit never told me who he was he said I'm sent from the presence of God and it does not feel like the Holy Spirit when it comes okay the holy spirit makes me feel happy but when that comes around it it isn't that feeling it's very sacred August feeling like and it's different but it's sent from God Amen that's it now is he degraded in the Holy Ghost he said it's not the Holy Spirit but he said this is an August presence right he said the holy spirit makes me feel happy yep but then he describes this angel coming to him as like a a wonderful feeling listen he said brother randam the ministry of angels that was back in the Old Testament like Daniel and so forth but that's an error friends that that that that is wrong now he said since the Holy Ghost come and the Holy Ghost leads the church that's what people say we don't need the Angels the Holy Ghost lead that's the truth the Holy Ghost leads the church but holy ghost leads the church that is true but there's ministering Spirit sent from God special gifts friends y That's it special gifts all right what's a preacher a gift is that according to Ephesians what's a prophet a gift that according to right what's all those other things speaking in tongues now look what he called it in the message I am the resurrection 19521 1810 God still has angels and they visit the people not a worship of angels but Angelic beings who are attributes of God am amen sent to Min sent forth to minister to the church through the people oh my how short we are are the real Apostolic Church going down to the bottom and you'll see it's in the same thing and pick up that one right in the middle notice this angel came he was Gabriel and God sends minor Angels that's right perhaps the one that comes one that comes here now I tell you what so now Mr Brandon you call me a minor Angel again I'll zap you now that's what we think the angel of the Lord would say right well who are you well I'm I'm you know just a minister at Lula I'm not just a minister I'm the pastor oh my now what's wrong right now do you think that angel of God was offended for brother random to call him a minor Angel that's not the only time I give you a lot of quotes before on it right right right amen no he's tickled to death amen he's in his place right like I've told you why didn't that angel tell brother randam what the seals were he told him about the the other things he told him about Daniel 70 weeks he told him about the the serpent seed he told him about the many things of the Bible why didn't he tell him what the seals were that's right he didn't know what it was he wasn't assigned to that job right amen amen the angels of God are attributes of God all right take it here's God take it and let it come down in your mind here's God here's Christ not another God that's right the Son of God the Creator the Loos here's sarapes here's chims here's Angel of the church ages here's preachers here's angels of of the investigating judgment y everybody's got a job to do amen right right amen where did the prophet say we get in trouble trying to take each other's place he said you businessmen stay out of the pull pit it's not your job J right what you see all right what do we got he said perhaps the ones that comes here some people will actually watch now puff their mind up with angels and things right all right who they think they have seen and things like that that's just the counterfeit right well brother D you you told us what you've seen that's up to you to figure out where it's counterfeit or not cuz you ain't got but one way to know that's right that's whether or not you got the Holy Ghost is going to be the only one could tell you anything that's right if you got the Holy Ghost it'll take care we'll come on down through here in a minute we got it lined up to where that if a minister don't stay with the word he ain't an angel sent from God he sent from somewhere outse and if he's all puffed up about angel I seen an angel seen an angel here you got to believe me cuz I seen an angel yeah M no no that's right you got your own why don't you talk to him come on you you you quote what the prophets why throw the not down there today people just take them and and stumble all over what you give them the prophet of God said all redeemed have Angels you have an angel a guardian angel that goes with you why don't you try to contact that one sometimes right but why the prophet say he said because we're not fasting and praying enough right brother Dale you tell us about it no you're supposed to have an well I got the Holy Ghost well if you got the Holy Ghost you got an angel you're not going to get upset about what I say then amen you won't get offended right if you got the Holy Ghost don't worry about it look he's still in the same message he said if it ain't if a if a man has seen an angel and met his commissioned or that angel commissioned him from God and it was sent from God it'll bear a record right down to the line right that it's the truth you believe that but if it doesn't it isn't the truth that's one thing you can depend on by their fruits you shall know them he said well brother Dale what come to you see I always nip things in the bud it was said that brother Dale met the same angel that brother R met in his study no sir I've got my own Angel that's right I don't have brother Brams man stood here years ago and preached that he said I talk to brother bram's Angel every day pre it right here years ago I again I don't believe it right I'm not concerned about brother Brown's angel I'm concerned about the Holy Spirit leading me and keeping me straight it's the Holy Spirit doing it but I still have an angel right you have an angel right that's the point I'm trying to make right you're trying to find out where mine is don't find out about me it won't put you in the Rapture and no where brother Dale's at that's right it'll only do for you when you know where you're at amen amen I believe brother so and so man I believe him now the Lord really well that's all right but what's God dealing with you come on amen amen remember you're not going in the Rapture because brother Dale or Lev or anybody is going right I use them names called it Ryme not for degrading nobody you got to have your own Holy Ghost right if you got the Holy Ghost you got an angel come on that's right you know it ought do us all good to do a little fasting and praying we might find out a lot of things right but you see now all right get on with it brother D on hush greatest battle ever fought number 10 on your notes Here the Bible comes right back and tells us here that God sends forth Angels Glory what are they ministering Spirits Glory ministering experience s work right from the presence of God what to do Minister his word right right I'm listen see amen you're not to minister some theology or of some denominational group but to minister his word that's it ministering Spirit sent forth how do we know they are now how do you know whether or not that someone has made contact with an angel and that angel has talked to him right I see you stop there and then you start backpedaling why don't you try to find your angel and talk to him that's right you want to talk to mine don't do you no good find your own you don't try to believe brother Dale the only one got the holy ghost or we'll just believe he got the Holy Ghost and that makes us with the Holy Ghost go we believe he's got the Holy Ghost something wrong with your mentality am that's right but you see you said well it's not brother Dale I've got a quote brother but not meant for everybody I agree with you that's right CU it's degreed in the body of Christ but ministering Spirits how do you know how do you know whether or not I'm have made contact with god let's just read it how do we know they are the Bible said that the word of the Lord came to the prophet right all right we believe the prophets don't we but is that all of it I thought we believe there was a five4 Ministry [Music] amen these angels Ministry his word through his Spirit ministers the word through the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit and the word comes to the prophet and the prophets had the word of God that's the reason they could do the Miracles that they did it wasn't the man it was the spirit of God in the man the spirit of Christ in the man for the word all right now that's brother random we believe in that we believe he was a church age messenger don't we we believe he was an angel of God don't we the reason we believe it because he brought the word now I know people don't like for you to make plain statements but you know why I believe brother BR was a prophet now there's people here that saw him and saw all the dead raised the sick healed and things like that and wonderful I believe them but you know why I believe it cuz it Compares with what's inside of me right well who are you I'm me who are you what' that solve how are you going to know whether a prophet's right or not that's right that's right it's only by the word amen and it's the word that's in you right you know how I I check preacher when they're preaching you know what I've told you this what been with me ever since I started in this message you know how I check preachers to see where they're writing the word or not I don't set well he quoted that wrong he missed the A out of that message he missed a be here no I sat there and listened to what the person is saying right and then I see if it fits the new birth right that I have within me that's right amen and I let the Holy Spirit decide that's right well brother d what if you're wrong well if if I'm wrong I'm wrong but the Holy Ghost is not wrong that's right see going down reading the greatest battle Hur yes sir these are ministering Spirits sent from the presence of God to be ministers to minister what his word not some theology but God's word their ministering Spirit sent forth from God to minister ministering Spirits oh and remember if it's ministering something besides the word it don't didn't come from God because Thy word is all always confirmed in heaven always in heaven go on down he will never send a spirit and with a great big DDD now you know what he saiding there great big thing and his collar turned around in the back and everything like that well of course the days of Miracles is passed Big D D D see we all know that no no that didn't come from God right it's contrary to his word amen he sends the ones that ministers the Spirit of the word amen he said he wish he had a whole lot to go on that one now so then what are they there's your personal angel that comes to you that is not the Holy Spirit right but is governed or ruled by the holy spirit amen or the holy spirit is in full charge if it come from God now you can claim to see this and see that and believe this and believe in voices believe all kind of things but if it don't compare with the word amen well who are you well like a man told us one time when he said we don't have brother brandom here I said but we got his message amen what's wrong we got his message amen well you can quote and I can quote well let's put them all together what's the problem let's get it all together but you see then there's like I said there's angels to each individual being that's a new got a new birth and that angel like brother Brown said he said it come in that building in that house there where he was born that a light you said well that's just the Holy Ghost he said I read you the quote where he said the angel come there do you believe it yes he's the one that said it we ain't talking about ourselves so when you're born an angel come to you amen now if you want to tie anything together you want to tie your representation and predestination right there amen that's right but we want to make it well bless God I come in the world with eternal life yeah right well look what I am I've had eternal life all my what a garbage can standing in the front of me looking like amen and acting like amen that's right that angel came when you was born too yep and was with you all your life if you have the new birth today God his only father redeemed only the redeemed have the new birth that's right and he's going to take care of us L we Dash our foot against a stone now I'm re quoting the quotes I gave you right right the points that we gave right so then there's what there's angels and then there's Church age Messengers there's ministers we'll get to it in a minute we don't have time I know but we'll get to this part at least but what's the next well I don't believe these flying saucers flying around that's just garbage well your brother random that you claim to be a prophet he surely did believe in it and he called him investigating Angels now we won't have time to read them so we'll take these up Wednesday but you just take these notes home we can bring them back Wednesday we won't have to rerun all these Pages please because you'll find in there if you'll read them you'll find brother random said that there are special beings special persons ones assigned to a special job read the notes and then we'll preach on it Wednesday amen you see he talked about investigating angels five Junctions at the time numers 12 on your notes 5622 he said the whole worlds and shaking I go into Germany or what will we do I go into India what we going to do I go into Switzerland everywhere what are we going to do what about now amen the whole world is shaking the United States is shaking the great bureaus and so forth in the great Pentagon and all that investigating Supernatural things flying saucers what are they oh they say we seen little men in them all kind of stories they try to deny it but they there why God said that there'd be signs in the heavens above and in the earth we got it they're afraid all right now he believed in investigating Angels flying saucers what you see a supernatural thing is taking place investigating judgment right flying saucers now I like to put this in too where you can do it so you know you get flying saucers running around and they've been knowing for many many many many many years that they've been flying around so what's the best thing the United States and Russia can do they got steals bombers now that are totally invisible to Radars and things and Francis powers in 1962 called a you two pilot was shot down by the Russians that plane was faster and more sophisticated than the steals bombers they used last year year a couple years ago when they went into Kuwait that's what your government people says so brother brandom I'll quote you him he said Russia had Jed airplanes that's 50 something well we know that cuz they were they captured high for the German scientist we got half of them the wall of Berlin we know that Adam Bomb had done been split the things were taking place all right but he said they got fly got jet airplanes and flying saucer just run flying saucers in your computer and you'll find brother around and tell you Russia had flying saucers 50 something why because it was already running around in the sky that God was doing these things and what's the easiest way Brother Gary to check on another country take you a couple of little bitty guys that's a little bit small or something pull her ears up and piek them and operate on them just in case they fall you make them look funny paint them green or something and wind up and put them in an airplane it's invisible The Radars and things and they just fly around this file well don't you think we're doing the same thing folks we're not goody two shoes here in America that's right they had watches in 1900 when we're still thinking and I am to of the old thing you got to throw over your head and look up through it you know and the thing blows off and here you take a picture they had watches in the 1900 that would take pictures of individuals we ain't playing around they're investigating each other here why because now they can they say well we don't know what's going on because here goes this and here goes that see but your Prophet believe right along in the middle of all that that God had investigating Angels wouldn't the two of them sit down to Sodom didn't he call them matter what all right you say well I don't know let's keep reading then what about the Christ of mystery of God revealed not 63 728 number 13 did you notice the angels that come down investigated Sodom before Sodom was destroyed you remember that there was a bunch of them come down three of them one of them stayed with Abraham and you remember that they were lights from Heaven that came down in the investigating judgment right and look where they're all found around the Pentagon and thing that they find them that's the whole world judgment Sodom look at the next one and knoweth it not 65 813 just in case people think he CH well that's in his early Ministry so we give you a couple I seals you know the world don't know what that is you know you know it's all in we know what it is see we know it's investigating judgment Angels you see and they how that the Pentagon all about how it comes right down to the intelligence and that they go like a Flash and be gone pull away from anything they got see and they don't realize what it is see let them think whatever they want to they call them flying saucers or whatever they don't know blind saucers we won't be able to get into the next cuz that's when get into angels and burners and shims and things but we'll do that Lord willing Wednesday am but just keep in mind what we're talking about please keep these notes cuz we won't have to run some many that's right me and that old printer get fighting each other all the time anyway and he wants to do it his way I think sometimes there's got to be an investigating bug in there somewhere but listen do you understand what I'm trying to do I'm not trying to show you the quotes brother Ram says come on right thoughts the ideas no I'm trying to get you and I to realize one thing the angels of God are real believe they're real and one day we'll see them we may not see them here because we may not do as the prophet said we may not get ourselves out of the way there are people right here Among Us that seen things they talk to me about them why because if you get yourself out of the way God will speak to you what would be the difference in him sending why didn't he go down to Peter in jail why didn't the Holy Spirit just go down and the shackles fall and the gates open and what no he had an angel signed for that right said go do it wormwood an angel was assigned he you remember what brother randam said he said when they got ready to go down he said there are the children of Israel I'm the the three Hebrew children would being thrown in the fiery furnace in a different different ways he explains it and he said warm wood comes up and said let me just wash it off I'll put that fire out he said you've been good but he said I'm going myself yep Gabriel came said let me do it he said you've been good Michael even came he said let me go he said no I'm going myself see there's angels and there's Angels sure there's angels that are anointing Us in the wrong direction too right because they're Fallen Angels if Satan could enter into and speak speak to the Lord Jesus and try to get him to reason what do you think's happening in your mind in my mind a lot of time Angels trying to enter into us what made the man the demon the man there with the G Gia wor it the swine right what made him like he was right but said he didn't start out wrong he was a good man right but he let something get inside of him and Captivate him and said when he did he said then Jesus cast that demon out of him what was that demon y would that demon be an angel or the devil what comes and sometimes tells you something I had something one time came to me and started and I was writing notes and wrote five pages and in a minute something spoke inside of me and said if you do that you make your type greater than your antitype and that's all he said he didn't say you're wrong he didn't say nothing or explain it he just said you make your type greater than your antitype I took those notes and not only tore them up I burn them cuz I would not want no one to ever know what was on those notes and I could have proved it by the prophet's message in the Bible but the way I was approaching it was wrong right I don't mind being honest with you see you're going down the highway and somebody runs you off the road and something rils up in you who is that now come on I know it can be you I don't blame the devil for everything now don't do that that's don't do it we was listening last night I don't know what the name of the tapwood we were listening last night and brother random was explaining about these family that that they were Germans and he said they would stand and said you walk by in the morning said I'd go by and speak and say good morning said just look at me he said I good morning just look at you he said because it's their ways now he said these were Holy Ghost filled people right do you think no that brother Dale Holy Ghost fi people don't act that way Holy Ghost fil people ought not act that way but I'll sure get you to take and let you listen to the prophet explain how that because of their German background that they would be hard and Stern and and things and he said it's hard to deal with them am you know what that is that's a German Spirit right what kind we got I've always wondered what M background was and I decided not to go look it up cuz I might find out the wrong thing I told you what they' done one time they run it back to see if we would can find any you know maybe hanging by the tail to be in our family and they found out a bunch of them hung by the neck so we decided to quit that's not a joke don't think how goody two shoes you are folks right we ain't nothing but a messed up bunch of concoction instead of caucasians you don't know what your background is and you know that all of that motivates you that's right cuz all that Spirits there's a German Spirit there's an American Spirit ours is laughter but it's demons come on brother yeah it's demons that are motivating us bless God I got the Holy Ghost ain't no devil bothers me now you right then you're right in the Trap the devil's want you to be in that's the biggest devil there is in the country I know people don't like me to talk like that but is it the truth that's right no I got the Holy Ghost you ain't no devil in this body like one man at Brother Richard used to tell about said he sat there in caves and fast and pray for days and weeks and all and throw ashes on him that he beat himself and say they ain't anounce or tradition in this body nowhere and when they presented to him the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he walked out something was wrong was it what's wrong with me you why don't we believe leave let's stand what we got 331 in spiral book 331 in the spiral book anybody have a need the
