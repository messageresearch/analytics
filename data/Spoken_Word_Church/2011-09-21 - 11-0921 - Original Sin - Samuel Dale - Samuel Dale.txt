and then brother will be with us about the 12th and then brother uh Ron Spencer will be with us here on the uh what it 29th and 30th which will be on us on Saturday night and a Sunday morning service and we will be having a dinner after the Sunday morning service no Sunday afternoon service amen amen so just remember these if you'd like turn in your scriptures second Thessalonians 2 in Genesis 3 now while you're turning there and standing I would like to say something to you that I want to apologize to my wife for jokingly saying something there Sunday that there was no derogatory thing intended but it was a joke and I shouldn't have been joking and all but it's just one of those things and I'm sorry I will try my best to keep away from that but you know about the message part now I wonder how many of you sisters have thought about what I said about my wife instead of thought about what I said right or what the scripture would say or the Bible would say about um you know how you treat your husband cu the prophet said as you treat your husband so is it how you you treat Christ so then you know uh just think about those things and remember there's a saying you'll never be remembered for the goods you've done you'll always be remembered for the Goofs you made that's right okay so but I apologize to my wife about that I'm sorry that I shouldn't have been jokingly saying something about something that you know but so just keep that in mind all right 2 Thessalonians 2 and Genesis 3 kind of an odd thing to go over and then come back down all right but we want to tie it together uh into the message Father we thank you we love you we ask you that you would just bless us now with your presence and understanding that you would guide each and every one of us and that you'd give us Lord what you'd have for us this day forgive our sins and Lord forgive us in any way of life and not working according to what you would want us to be and just have your way now and keep us lead us by thine understanding hand as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and our lives we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen also the doctor said I do not have to have the operation as of this time so thinking about taking my thyroid out but he said he didn't think it was necessary right now but he wanted them to get to working on auses I said well for 20 30 years have been working on this crepiness to try to get it out so you know maybe one of these days they'll figure out how to do it cuz I asked him I said well if I take the thyroid out would it help that he said I can't promise you anything I said well all right but he said himself said well let's just wait I said okay you know let's do that all right yeah wait said after hunting season we have to wait get over there there goes her joke again right all right let's go to Second Thessalonians then we'll come back to Genesis because this is not going to be just dealing with the garden and the things I want us to get down to the original sin and see that the original sin would have to still be here y you remember when brother brandom was talking to the man you know and and he really didn't didn't have the answer something similar to the basis of what was that went on and and the man told him said now wait a minute brother random said whatever was there has got to still be here yeah he said okay Lord then the Lord came on the scene and showed him you know what it was you know so just remember that as we're trying to to get to the point 2 Thessalonians we'll start reading in verse 7 just to sa time for the m of iniquity do already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan watch even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness now let's go back to Genesis then cuz I said we want to tie it together and bring it down to the hour that we're living to finish all things up Genesis 3 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman y hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden right God ha said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for for God does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as God's knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave it unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of both of them were open and they knew that they were naked and they seed fig leaves together and made made themelves aprons you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I want to make sure that you follow the point of the way that I was trying to bring out um Sunday afternoon especially and and seeing the situation that we talked about Sunday morning and then on the end of the evening service about what that God first created a spiritual man that's right all right and that spiritual man was Genesis 1: 126 and 27 which according to the prophet that man was created before the foundation of the world Amen he was not created spiritually on the sixth day any day whatsoever amen he was created in eternity all right because we saw that spiritual man was the man land Christ Jesus the one true seed of of uh Galatians 3:16 amen all right and then the natural Man was created in Genesis 2 now that was created on the sixth day amen the natural man Adam was created there in Genesis and the prophet said now one is a natural man the other one is a spiritual man now you say but brother Dale uh what would that tie to together because uh you know we believe that that it was only in God's mind back before the world well all of the previous messages to anyone just hooking on and hearing this uh I don't have time to cover all of it but if you go back about seven or eight messages and try to listen you know it would uh you could be able to understand what we're talking about if not you won't know what we're trying to say but the point is that if you say it was just in his mind or in a way or something like that then you're cutting off the real truth that that man that was created back there was part of God right God stepped over into another form right right and begin to create it that's right not another God Amen but another form amen and if we wasn't there in him in that form mhm that he was in then the prophet of God says we'll never be there that's right all right so then that's just puts it to a point you know of of doing it but see what I've tried to get you to see is on the one true and living God the way I believe it God just stepped over into another form to to begin to create it was the same God Amen in another form that's right all right called a son of God God word logos theoy etc etc all right now he done that to be able to create because only the that only Jesus Christ was the creator according to uh the scriptures Hebrews 1 John 1 uh you know and all of that and what is it James 3 or what where it says that Jesus Christ created all things or Ephesians 3 all right now what I tried to get you to see about God the way I look at it and I mean this is the way I see it he he stepped over into another form right yeah all right now we won't take it up tonight because we're not going to get there but we'll begin to cover more into Sunday Services as to begin to talk about this man and creation and life and the existence of the Old Testament people and you'll see that that that same God that stepped down to to create was the same God that just stepped over into another form to be the Christ of the Old Testament amen the one to lead the children of Israel the you know the the pillar of fire the the the the things of the Old Testament and we'll see that that is the same Christ all right then that same Christ just stepped into flesh amen some 2,000 years ago into a human body that was prep all right and that same God was in that flesh not another God Amen not another person or identity same God Amen all right see then what I trying to get you see then then he just stepped over in the day of Pentecost amen when the Holy Ghost came he just stepped over in another form amen all right and see then we're the final imorph or final form of God in this end times then there shouldn't be any trouble to understand that we not as people not as little some form of identities or some little something you want to make but that we were there in him according to uh as we spent so much time in Ephesians it says that Ephesians 1 about four says that we were chosen in him that's right before the foundation of the world now what was chosen before the foundation of world the Christ right the eternal life not us as people Y and then we come to earth now that's where we are in our studies we've dropped to Earth and we're going to pick up and see how we developed our name our ways our doings here on Earth and then we'll see what part Christ plays with all of those things amen all right see that's that's what I wanted to bring I I wrote started wri notes and and then when I did I se well uh there's a gap you know so I need to fill it in all right and you'd have to be me okay I'm sorry when I look at something like that I don't want to leave a loophole right or a gap I want it filled in where you can just come flow right across and and be able to to see where we're at all right now we know that Eve was in Adam and I trying to bring out Sunday you know people say oh she was just a by product you know making her some kind of a dog meat or something you know compared to the man being a porterhouse steak or some kind of a fancy thing and I I spent my whole time trying to get you sisters to see your rightful position like I said then I flood a dub by some I say and ruins the whole thing and you forget all I talk and you just remember what to say but the Eve brother Brown said was co-equal amen absolutely yes sir amen we look at a byproduct a byproduct according to Webster is a secondary or incidental product like as in the process of manifest manufacturing all right it's something produced in making or doing something else right not the main product right but see it's like I tried to get you to see that you know God made male and female for the animals then when it come to the to the woman he didn't do that he went back to the original product that was standing there Adam and he took from Adam that's right a rib and made Eve all right and Eve was in Adam brother around said in theop in the beginning well why can't we see the truth of it people want to make it look like some kind of a garbage can yeah or created a certain way so you know that things could fall in in a way of making her do it well if that be true then God's the author yeah remember now I can quote brother brandom brother brandom said Satan was he designer now what's he talking about right right what's he talking about right that's right did he design her body no did he design design her spirit no did he design her as a person no no no no no God did amen right but see then Satan took over right the same lie he told in heaven that's what we want to get to the original sin the same lie that he told in heaven it's the same lie he told Eve and that's the same lie that he still telling today right I can't get away from that so forgive me you know I I wanted to and you talk to God about it or somebody else ever somebody told me to do it this way you have to make your Choice that's right but God created Adam and he saw Adam lonely so he took part of Adam then that would make her not an original creation all right so we're in marriage and divorce and brother Bram and the quotes brother BR made said see she wasn't in the original she wasn't right the other females were made in the original the dog the cat the horse the you know but she wasn't she was a byproduct she was in Adam then taken from Adam and placed into a position that we covered it Sunday that she was co-equal with Al right now how are you going to make a co-equal product such a garbage can byproduct that the preacher to do with the message right that's right I'm not a male show in his Pig but neither am I what is the other side of it Susan ain't here to help me I'm not a femin I'm what he said I just believe in the truth right amen right I believe God created e perfect amen yeah all right right but yet knowing that if he put her in flesh that she would fall right cuz he knew if he brought Satan into being he would fall yeah but did he make Satan fall no you can't do that cuz you down the author right did he make EA no you can't do it so she would put on three more agency amen that's right all right and she made her choice and that's what we want to deal with for a little bit now because look even if you say well she was a lesser product well what are you going to do there in the Bible where Adam said she is now bone of two other guys no said she's bone of my bone amen and Flesh of My Flesh right she had no original DNA had to be an Adam amen right and remember she never got her name Eve until she fell amen that's right her name was Adam that's right a byproduct Adam but then when she fell she received the name Eve because it means mother of all living all right so it put it into a place all right so God never went somewhere else to get it he went right straight to the original product and got Eve from the original product of Adam bringing her into being and in doing that look what the position he put her in coequal that's right right yep Satan was co-equal with God except for creation is that what your Prophet said that's what he said y said he couldn't create that's why he pass out Supernatural gifts that's why he can imitate the Holy Ghost he can do all kind of signs and wonders amen now but when Eve chose wrong see then her attribute was displayed into the the the committing of an act just as I tried to express that the Angels couldn't smoke drink Che or running around with women up in heaven y cuz they had no gender part to be able to do it so then that's not sin sin is to disbelieve right all right right sin is to disbelieve God's word right all right now she believed Satan's life all right just like Lucifer Satan got the angels in heaven to believe his lie amen all right so then now we come to quote number one brother Anderson you read all above and belows the things but just get what we underline and what we're thinking about now think of what your Prophet is saying and and your mind you know I I've always tried to tell you about your mind how your mind works right all right and and it can be locked in on something and you can quote it but it it locks in right all right now my mind used to be locked on this quote CU When I read that I thought brother randam who give you the right to interpret the scriptures or to change the wording when you said that the ends and the buts was per and you know what one day I read what he said he didn't change anything he said the original said that right was your mind locked on a point that brother randam just said the LIE yep should have said the lie was he telling us some better way of understanding no he was right in the scripture for this caus man she sent forth a strong Lo that they should believe a a lie it should have been translated there as I looked in the Lexicon Dei not a lie same one he told Eve now whatever the LIE is is the original sin right so that's what we're talking about tonight the original sin so now what is the original sin that we need to see that is still affecting us today when I told you whatever started in heaven came down to even the garden and is now prevalent today because we are in the Alpha and Omega the beginning was back there the ending is here and so is Satan amen telling the same lie that's right right now what did he tell Eve in the garden you shall not die right right simple plain language right you shall not die what is he telling the now forgive me just be with me what is he telling the basis of Christianity Today right you're born again y that's right you shall not die now may I quote brother Brandon do you need this one he said where at one time Satan used to tell you you was lost right yeah right but he says now Satan tells you you're saved right same lie Eve you shall not die y you were made for this you now will understand the great Mysteries and know all about the the creations and the things and all about the situations does that bring you down to where we are right where is there a group of people in the world today that is advanced in understanding of natural and spiritual things any more than the Believers of this end time message amen that's right absolutely right right when we could baffle the scientific world with our knowledge right coming from a seventh grade education man right that's right you're right you understand what I'm saying amen the same lie that he told Eve you shall not die now you say unto the people in the end time you shall not die did you you be as Gods y knowing all the Mysteries you know and Paul said we could is that right amen Paul said you know all Mysteries and not have love right that's it m so then we're sitting in the same situation the original sin that started in heaven was transmitted down to earth right and we're sitting in the same situation of that sin even to what I was trying to bring out the other day see because he told Eve he said you'll be as God right but I don't want to be as God right right amen come on I don't believe a child of God is as God all right right amen I believe a child of God is God Amen in another form amen called a son amen well amen what if that could be part of the LIE see you're only going to be able to understand and be able to fight Satan if you have the new birth right amen if you don't you're going to be caught am I am too in El Li right right that's right so now is it tying together with you right go remember what we brought out that Satan starts off be as God y then he comes up sitting in the temple of God to show him himself to be as God or whatever in Isaiah but then when he gets over in the end time right he says to be God right and you know what we just read in the Bible for this cause God has sent them a strong delusion yeah Amen to believe the lie Y and be damed God would do that God sends God permits the delusion he doesn't send it right he permits it to come into being right right why to try us amen right remember the other day and they in here again where brother around said this bride is to prove well it's number three on the notes but hold on we got to get number two first we she's to prove to Satan that she won't fall for that lie right amen we're here on the ground to fight it out with the devil and watch when you get on up here where it's at we're in the head all right amen all right going up let's pull this up while we at it number two the first seal 3:10 1963 B18 that other one was the first seal paragraph 87 U that we just went off where we were talking about it should be translated thei all right look God said if they want it just let them have it yep now he didn't make nobody do anything did he but he says if that's what they want let them have it and I'll actually make them believe that that's the truth cuz I'll give them a reprobate mind concerning the truth that's right now folks that's not trinitarianism right that's not denominationalism of what church we should belong to there's no strong delusion in that is there n because if you want to go to it you go talk to one group of people and they'll tell you that they're the ones with the truth and this other group ain't but you move up to that group and they'll tell you they the truth and they ain't everybody believes they in the truth right that's right but what what if we have a reprobate mind you know that God never gave you the reprobate mind he would be the author of rep probation or how You' say it the author of doing wrong right but he knew what we'd want he knew that Eve would want to believe Satan's lie come on he's not God if he didn't that's right right he couldn't make her believe it but he knew to give her a choice she would wind up into that lie yep and sin would come into origination all right look at the next one then God of his evil age paragraph 37 1965 801 with we find that this Evil Ages to prove to Satan she is not like Eve that she is not that type of a woman what and she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word you're going to be Tried by the word amen now what does that mean what did Eve fall on let's go and reading and Adam's bride believe believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face now what is brother random talking about she believed everything but Hebrews 13:8 see Satan convinced her that God would not keep his word cuz his word said you eat thereof you're going to die right right Satan said n no no no you don't understand he ain't going to kill you cuz you're so wonderful he just can't do it without you she really got buil up then didn't she right what happened she believes Satan's lie now brother R said to believe Satan's lie to serve Satan that's his words to believe Satan's lie to serve Satan now you getting what I'm talking about what was her lie what was the lie you shall not die you are the bride of Adam God created you they're just withholding the secret little things from you the great Mysteries what about today how come today that you have people that won't come to church right they go to church church is where they play tapes and things ain't none of my business I'm preaching that's where y'all get me wrong you think I'm beating on something like that no I'm talking to you amen I'm not talking to the internet I'm not talking to people listening out there they listen all they want to I'm not talking to anybody out there I'm not a worldwide Pastor right I get a question or something I refuse to even answer the question why because I'm not a I'm not the internet pastor if you want to listen that's your business I pastor this church all right now what would be the thing that would come into view from Eve and the situation of Adam and Satan you know through the Beast and brother randam said we're all born and watch it he didn't say we're born from the Beast and eat now he didn't say that cuz you only split half the condition there cuz there was two of them you know Cain and a one from one side one the other side all right but he said we're all born between Satan and Eve right now brother D my Mom and Daddy was holy sweep people away amen did that make you anything no that's right if you think it did you got a problem right that's right that's right but what was her situation that would have to come down and be the same situation here I'm talking about the end time now now we're we're not talking about down to the ages or nothing that's what I'm trying to preach it sin in Heaven Sin in the garden sin here the original sin all right now in the garden you find God coming down in the cool of the day right right amen you find Adam you find Eve eat and you find the Beast all right now if she disbelieved Hebrews 13:8 what would be our disbelief right what would be the disbelief today now brother randam said spoken words Original Seed you go back he said she couldn't wait that's it amen now who was it she couldn't wait on she couldn't wait on her head which was Adam right amen you agree that's right amen she couldn't wait on her head which was Adam all right now what would it be in the end time from that same quoting there of spoken word Original Seed I'm pretty sure if not I can find it in a hurry for you brother brand said so is it in the end time right amen so they can't wait wait for the Holy Ghost to get into anybody want to help me there couldn't wait for the Holy Ghost to get into the five-fold ministry uhoh did that strike home amen did that get down under your fifth rib you know what's wrong with the people of this message I hope you were listening to the situation L that there was God y there was Adam there was Eve and there was a beast now we've had God through a prophet are you listening to bring us a message right just like God was walking in the cool of the evening with them amen we've had God to bring us a message to a prophet amen that he walked in the cool of the evening with the bride of Christ and showed signs and wonders amen vind ating the man of the word that he was bringing but then all at once something happened and the the man was removed from the situation now the people don't know what to believe come on that's right I didn't write the book I just try to tell you what the book said so Eve wouldn't wait on her head her headship was the word in Adam right Satan through the Beast just simply got hurt to disbelieve that Adam would ever tell her the truth that's right he said brother Dale you always preach deep I I can't see where there's anything deep about that that's just as simple you say yeah it is cuz you studied it out no what's what's hard about believing that right am I right there was Adam there was Eve there was the Beast there was God there was Satan trying to do all his and Eve wouldn't wait on Adam to tell her y right well we got the prophet's message thank God for all of the printers and the things that's put it into books and textes and computers and things like thank God for it that's right right as I said we have the answer to to all of the questions of life planets and worlds and what's to come but you know there was a fivefold Ministry guy in the garden MH they just called his name Beast y are you listening that's right let called his name Beast you he didn't have one the Beast began to explain what Adam was supposed to explain that's so now we come down in the end time and we're standing down here with the prophet's message the prophet is not here to be able to explain it to us but I don't think he needs to be right right all but that's I think the Holy Ghost supposed to do it that's right brother R said they couldn't wait for the Holy Ghost to get into the to the ministry and express what was being said bless God I don't have to depend on no preacher okay bye Eve right that's right come on on not a joke truth right amen but I can get it for myself that's where the trouble is that's that same woman that thought she could get it for herself that was in the garden now let's take her for a second Now Eve was the first woman preacher you agree y I don't have nothing to do with women preacher forget that right I ain't going to argue with nobody whatever to do not throwing off on them or nothing just trying to make a point Eve preached to the Beast did we read it Eve told the Beast what God Said right and who was the god that told her that Adam right right amen Adam told her you know don't do and she become a preacher she preached to the Beast the Beast was probably what is the word astonished by her answers but Satan wouldn't right cuz that's what he wanted her to do yep he wanted her to preach the gospel to him where he could show her the loop hold the problems the things that she needed to know right you you'll be as God knowing good and evil right okay so what happens then what's happened to the end time people right I told you I'm not preaching somewh else so I'm talking here now I know I get in trouble trying to to preach to you try because people sitting there looking at me say I believe everything the prophet say is you believe that when you was a trinitarian too you believed everything the Bible said to you about a trinity being true I'm not somewhere else I'm preaching to you and me tonight because that same lies right here amen right brother D don't you believe that we have the Holy Ghost amen the prophet explained that said people say we don't have no need of a teacher or anything because we've got the Holy Ghost it's our teacher he said then why did God put teachers in the 5-f ministry amen right right amen you see that's what I tried to get you to see the other day and I still haven't brought that out really but the five-fold ministry is predestinated eternally from God because it's in the word right naming them Etc the nine spiritual gifts is listed in the Bible and talks of but it's not predestinated eternally because that's what your Prophet had to say all see then that's a gift to the church right is the fold Ministry what is their job brother brandom what is the fivefold ministry to do do you need this quote he said they'll they'll take these big nuggets that I have brought or nuggets or whatever use the word there right and he said they'll break them down right amen right to the people that's what the church couldn't wait on right what would have happened had the had Eve not listen to the Beast all this wouldn't have took place true right what would have happened if the Angels had to listen to Lucifer none that would have took what would have happened if everybody would have stayed with what Paul said right wouldn't be no problem with right that's right so Satan had to attack the word that's what brother R says to try to get people to not believe what the Bible said right to try to get people to not believe what brother Brandon said yeah and to try to get the people to not believe what the fivefold ministry said hey and I'm number one okay to make the statement that the way most of the preachers of this message preach I don't want to listen to them amen that's right amen yes sir I don't mind saying that Amen Brother D no I'm not judging I'm just telling it like it is amen right I wouldn't want to listen to it that's right why because they're not saying what the Bible say am brother R said I'll be glad when a day comes that's right but people will look you straight in the eye and say you're not saying what Paul said amen that's right but of course that makes you very unpopular it's all right amen cuz popularity ain't going to it don't work right right we see gifts and callings are without repentance so there's a lot of people get gifts y that don't repent to get them right right you know that's right you don't make you're a Christian because that you you got a gift that's right right but now listen we read in the scripture that he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers for what what it for right for the perfecting of the Saints now perfecting there in a is a word which is used like completion of bringing it to a full age Etc it's not because I'm up here that that makes you perfect right no I believe everything brother brother I believe everything you say I've had people who say that to me a lot of time that didn't hang around too long that's all right I have no problem but what about turning down the fivefold ministry right would that be the same as Eve not believing Hebrews 13:8 right okay pull up number four sir as we would see Jesus 54328 e35 let's let brother brandom answer that question brother brandom does Hebrews 13:8 tie together with the five-fold ministry okay God has men to build houses he has some to preach the gospel some to teach God has set God has set in the church first apostles prophets teachers evangelist and Gifts of healing and working of Miracles and so forth Aller the perfecting of the Saints Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever am all right so it puts together what happened in the garden Eve disbelieved Hebrews 13:8 right Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever come on so she disbelieved the ministry that was there that she should have listened to right amen which was her head amen see now he's made us come to the end time and then we can be in Satan's delusion by not putting our confidence in the ministry to believe that they of God could we be standing like Eve M look at the next gifts preaching 19 56 1207 E28 what there are in the church five offices Apostles or missionaries either one both the same thing word means one cent and apostles Prophet teachers evangelist pastors God said to them in the church but because we would be an apostle the prophet couldn't say you're not in it so it's not a onefold ministry that's right amen right is that what he's saying right are the pastor to the Evangelist or so forth but they're all little lines are you reading it all little Lin lines of God that's put into the church for the perfecting of the Saints little lines little things that he's placed there for the perfecting of the Saints are you listening for the perfecting of the Saints look at the next one number six paragraph 304 stature of perfect man 62 10:14 the morning service he's reading it because he's reading the scriptures about the apostles but for the perfecting of God does it read like that congreg says no the Perfection of what Saints who are the Saints the Sanctified ones amen the ones started from down here now he's in the Statue of perfect man starting at Faith right perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ for the edifying of the body of Christ for the edifying building it up edifying so you say we don't have to have the five-fold ministry we we don't we don't have to have five-fold Ministry we just get it straight from God well any of you want to take a horse and buggy and try to go to the Moon that's what you're saying that's right that's right right yep you see I can get that just get your horse buggy and go to move but I got horsepower I got the ability to move I don't need to F for Ministry he said like I said you said brother Dale you you're preaching to us we believe in the fful ministry what about your confidence right where's it say is it set in the five-fold ministry or is it set in the five-fold ministry and you right y do you have a little bit in reserve just in case this don't work just in case the 54 Ministry let me hold a little bit onto my own okay brother daylight I believe you but I just I just can't put all my confidence in the whole thing I've got to keep a couple of eggs and an extra biset something work you know what about it I didn't write the book I didn't make the statements the prophet said that the 54 Ministry was for the perfecting of the Saints I didn't write the book that said the f full ministry was for perfecting the and perfecting means completion right right and brother brandom I don't know where got it in here but he was saying like fill me up in the Statue of perfect man right long into the back of it he's talking about fill me up Lord that I might teach others Apostles prophets evangelist Pastor teachers for the bringing of these things into the body right how you going to climb up statue of perfect man well I just jump what about it okay that's the next one Anderson which stat perfect man paragraph 45 62 10:14 the morning for God has set in the church Apostles Prophet teachers pastors V all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it for that perfecting of the for that that Perfection of the coming of the Son of God now he ties it together with the coming of the Son of God and the five-fold ministry and the perfecting of the Saints do we believe that right is our dependence upon Perfection coming to us lying within the five-fold ministry or is it something we think we can do or have not done or whatever Y what about it brother D it just sound like you're trying to scare us and pull us to yourself I can't change your mind on what you think but I've been here 40 for 35 years and I I don't see too much pulling going on I didn't come and get you in the churches you were in you came here if I've ever produced a point of you thinking that brother Dale thinks he's a number one guy you better believe you missed it that's right I've got to depend upon the five-fold ministry myself that's right that's where you can't get preachers depend upon preacher nope I oh they quote five four minutes were perfecting the Saints but where do they use the ministry or what do they do that's why congregations are starving to death right brother and people are leaving congregations because that they won't move on I didn't do that but you see folks the greatest battle ever fought started in heaven right go these are on the quotes we won't read them they get the last one but the greatest battle ever fought the prophet of God preached the message he said sin didn't originate on Earth said it originated in heaven that's right that's right y when they disbelieve the word of God to take their own ideas then that that made those things he said those angels that fa he said D even give us a nature y That's right now don't talk about giving us a soul now get taught the wrong time that's right they pervert us because D's work to come to then you see spirits y spirits and you see them manifested and you see Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostals Brites okay that's what the other preachers they don't never bring that word in on end right they Lula you know what kind of act do we need Spirits get into people and cause them to form denominations Spirits get into people and cause them to form organizations which is the step before denomination brother R say you can't denominate this message but he said you can organize it and let you see it that's right so look about the world today and see what it is but see the battle went from an angels in heaven it came to Earth the prophet said and started and he said there had to be a mutual ground for it to start in he said so it was started in the human mind now the human mind of an individual it can be wonderful or it can be damaging that's right it's going what you use it for they used it to make gunpowder and W up killing people he used it to make guns wind up killing he used to make airplanes wind up killing he used it to make bombs the human mind you see Eve in the human mind was trying to face Satan now listen to this point if you agreed a while ago about it that she didn't listen to her head and didn't stay with the ministry of the hour listen to this point she was attacked in her head yep not in her heart that's right you read it go ahead Satan's attack is through the mind run around and said God's approach is through the heart right right so Eve in Head Thought she could fight it out no man quote brother brandom is a match for the devil none of those prophets or anybody was a match for the Devil the only match for the devil's ever been was the Lord Jesus Christ that's right amen until even Gabriel the great Archangel could be h Ed by Satan but Michael couldn't amen all right so the battle started in the human mind and that human mind Satan began to try to get her to reason and she went to her heart and tried it by the word it would would not have fallen there would have been no fall see our human brain is what Satan starts in right yep and begins to work on us that's right because your spirit connects to your brain don't ask me I don't know how I'm just talking all right memory reason conscious affections and things we talk about that Spirit realm but where do it work through it has to work through the human brain am I right right brother Rand said those senses are fine if they're lined up with the word right but he said if not right then they become the Devil's Playground right right brother R I believe it's Blasphemous night I know excuse me Grace about fault that he said eve got her flu stopped up right Amen in other words her memories and conscious affections Etc her flu you know what flu are like on a stove and the pipes on the you know heater and different things somebody on the internet might not understand what I'm saying but it just simply means she let him stop up those things right with his word yeah cuz he took God's word and perverted it Satan don't have a word he don't have seed that's right he took God's seed and perverted it God's word and perverted it and in her mind she began to reason y I don't need that I don't need to find full ministry y I just get it myself I can read the books and listen to The Taste and hear it exactly from the prophet I didn't write the book as I I keep saying God wrote the book right see it was thrown down to the human and it become into humans brother Brown said he started to try to destroy God's creation that's right that's in greatest battle ever to try to destroy God's creation so you see Cain killing a y you see the battle from then on of mankind that we'll get into more Sunday and going on with it it started in the human mind because Satan knew if he could get into that mind come on through reasoning memory conscious effect and all that works through that he knew if he could get her to stay in that real then it would produce whatever he desired see so no telling how long it took him there to reason with her she wasn't trying to be a bad woman brother Brown said there's no n goes to these convents and all to be a bad woman said she goes there to pray and commit her life to God but said she winds up being a prostitute to the priest right she didn't go there for that purpose she was blinded in her mind right decisions is what's made in the mind jump over Brother Anderson to number 10 let's read number 10 number 11 okay the greatest battle of Vault paragraph 400 62 311 see his attack listen his attack watch listen close this Clos his attack is what disbelieve God's word and that's his attack there can you see the greatest battle was ever fought there's only two forces Satan and God and what is Satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disel your weapon he disarms you what is your weapon the word right come on we don't have to do it all do we he disarms you let's let's listen real quiet now listen and if he can get you to disb believe your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he's disarmed you right look he's disarmed you when you get when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done hold that weapon don't you lay it down we see his unbelief to get you to disbelieve your weapon Eve was fortified behind the word right she had her head which was Adam she had the Holy Ghost In the Garden leading them around y right and yet Satan entered through her mind and got her to disbelieve God's word what about here in the end time am you see we we spend a lot of time talking about a battle and what happened back Dar but go ahead brother Anderson pull up the next one the greatest battle ever fought paragraph 60 and so an Army in getting ready for a battle first there's got to be select some soldiers they got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting now listen and I believe the that the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go in action right now he spent his whole point of the greatest battle ever fought in the human mind basically falling at back there right come on but then he drops it down to the end where we're at now right the battle is ready to go in the human mind right now you're sitting there saying I wish you'd shut up where I could get home I'm tired well who does he think he is I'm the bride of Christ I can't be deceived you know we quote that a lot and I know what the scripture said and I know what brother R said it's impossible for the true bride to be deceived but how you like this one he said if he didn't cut the work short frankly it would get them confused right right you want that quote he said he had to cut the work short that work there in the scripture where it said he do a short work that means he do a short word it's translated brother ROM didn't change it I didn't change it the translation in the original said it would be a short word right right man what we are to prove to Satan that we won't fall like Eve by disbelieving the word but you know what now let's get plain and blunt for a second you got to have the word before the possibility of disbelieving it can come to pass right do you agree that's right amen that's right Luke with a trinity couldn't disbelieve the seals you know come on marriage and divorce whatever you going there must be a falling away if there's a falling away you got to be somewhere to fall from right right right well bless God I'm glad at I'm at Lula where we got the word that if you make us the Apex of it I didn't if you do it then just remember we're the quicker ones to fall oh my because we've reached that place so be careful what you say about us oh you might be getting in bad shape but they never said that some of you say that I believe we have the word yes because we tried to stay with it amen and thank God for that we have used the fivefold ministry yep to try to bring that word amen as I've always told you if I knew where there was a prophet was a real Prophet not fly by nights and all that if I knew where there was a real Prophet anybody out there on the internet find give it to him and send it to him a real Prophet that can really has got the gift and don't worry about it if he comes here we'll know whether he's right or not right because if he discerns me out I don't mind telling him in a hurry hey you missed it right one brother was telling me one time he said something you know and we were at a church and he was talking about something he was like you know he was leading it like he had discernment well I'm not saying he didn't I just simply told him I said well if you ever discern me out you'll find out down inside of there there's something good well I don't mind that any Christian ought to say that you should say that that's right why would you be worried about being discerned out why would you be worried about being called out that's right right but it's like they used to tell about Jack Cole and them you know Jack Cole start calling it out and look back and brother Brown did too he start calling out people and telling them what they were doing and all at once the prayer line just start and everybody be just dropping out why people say boy bless God me I'm before I go for a prophet I'm going to pray that's good I seable but what are you afraid of Are You Afraid of the truth that's right why wouldn't we want to know the truth amen would you know what our problem is we cover up ourselves until we've got to where we can believe Satan's lie and he can tell us all how goody goody we are and how we believe the message and we can be right in the middle of the devil's lie right right brother you you sure don't sound you know I just tell it like it is M see there ain't no hope for nobody outside of Jesus Christ that's my only hope always has been my hope and always will be my hope that's right is Jesus Christ that's right yes sir if there there's anything that's ever come from this man's lips it was Christ amen I'm talking about the right part A lot of the wrong Parts Old Samuel Dale yeah we agree with that everybody knows that no problem you just pray for me I have to answer for my attitude and my ways you won't have to right but we'll all answer for what we do about the word right now I hope you listen because I thought now you know like brother said eve failed on Hebrews 138 I mean I even had people to question me here about it say well well brother D I don't understand that what does that mean well I didn't understand it too well either but sometimes when I start preaching God can use the old fell to bring out some things that's right I believe she turned down to 54 Ministry now what what those 54 Ministry back there oh that something I don't see why they wouldn't right that's right there was a man standing there that was named Adam right that could name all the animals right why not come on brothers let's Stand Together think on these things what is the original sin to dis believe God's word right right you know why a lot of times Brother Dean I talking about this a minute ago you know and I don't say it's every time because God's testing you to do that but you know a lot of times we don't believe that we're healed but yet we say we are by our mouth we confess with everything except the heart cuz I've never said it from the heart that I was healed and it didn't take place that's right right H but I said it a lot of time to the head and still just as sick as could be maybe sometimes we're not getting down into the heart then there is times come on that brother around and said after all that you've done and confessed and set and all everything he said and you're not healed he said just stand right there he said CU God is trying you to see if you'll stay with the word simple isn't it sure simple what we got 369 the red B 369 anybody have a e all in him amen the Mighty God is Jesus the prince of peace is he the Everlasting father the king eternally the wonderful and wisdom
