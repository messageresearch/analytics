[0:02] we are speaking on the stick full
[0:04] purpose now which commands the key to
[0:07] the whole thing if you'll pay attention
[0:09] to the six volt purpose it will tell you
[0:14] need to live a little bit this way yeah
[0:18] cuz we watch get out of that you can see
[0:21] other Harry I made this straight down
[0:24] the middle of what you do this and you
[0:26] just call what we want to see all the
[0:28] way no boy no I'm good okay all right
[0:31] here we go go go go refer to this but
[0:33] everybody's you can read that on your
[0:34] own all right Zakaria 13 no last Sunday
[0:41] and everybody needs to get the chart so
[0:44] you can look at it jahmene according to
[0:50] the Prophet message and according to the
[0:52] Bible hmm ok thank you use for a notepad
[0:59] or watch oh that's right two of you
[1:09] weren't my friend ro students were going
[1:14] ok I don't think listen that Sunday out
[1:17] there we go and Luis's gonna be doing
[1:20] sons good for us so what was that last
[1:25] Sunday we took this chart now for those
[1:29] of you that have not been here or had
[1:31] been here a while according to the
[1:34] prophets message and according to the
[1:35] Bible we see that there is one week left
[1:41] after the rapture of the church one week
[1:43] of time to fulfill scripture to fulfill
[1:48] all of the 490 years promised and
[1:53] Israel's Redemption okay now want us to
[1:58] get something in our mind today now
[2:05] your new birth happened sometime in a
[2:10] day right okay so let's don't get stuck
[2:15] when it says here's will be born again
[2:16] in today okay like I said before I don't
[2:20] think the whole thing 44,000 is going
[2:22] together in an arena they're going to
[2:23] preach one message to them and they're
[2:25] all going to receive the Holy Ghost at
[2:27] the same time and you'll hear brother
[2:28] branham say that they'll all receive the
[2:30] Holy go okay and the Israel the Bible
[2:35] says it will be born in a day we'll see
[2:38] to me when Israel begins to come back to
[2:41] God in 144 thousand August born again
[2:44] then Israel be morning in them today ya
[2:47] got that you did you know we're trying
[2:51] to repeat that woman what will happen is
[2:53] when you say Israel be born in a day so
[2:55] I don't think that Israel I don't think
[2:57] the two prophets are going to prophesy
[3:00] it takes me why would why would God give
[3:02] him 1260 days if if he only did it one
[3:06] day we got it same way the you know that
[3:09] my point is I seen by there this morning
[3:11] the point is is your new birth was a
[3:13] journey up to that birth right and it's
[3:16] a journey after that burden because
[3:18] we're Gentile all right all right but
[3:22] now what God is going to do is we're
[3:24] going to see this when we talk about the
[3:25] 70th week that God is not worried at all
[3:31] about anything but you and I sometimes
[3:34] we get hung up in all this right here
[3:36] that's leading up to even this rule
[3:40] didn't receive it at Calvary we didn't
[3:44] receive it at cow bring right right it
[3:48] took 40 50 days after the death of Jesus
[3:51] and he comes back on a dead planet cost
[3:52] of here in about 80 30 same thing and
[3:55] then the church started the Holy Ghost
[3:57] fell in the believers not only into
[4:01] believers 120 any upper rib okay right
[4:04] but it was the process they had to be
[4:07] preached to for three and a half years
[4:09] or they received the baptism the Holy go
[4:12] okay everybody got that so it's a
[4:16] process 1260 days we're going to read in
[4:19] the Book of Revelations in the minute I
[4:21] think what we do is maybe we'll read
[4:22] that one first the lesson hang on just a
[4:25] second but we've already proven by the
[4:28] Bible by the prophets message and by the
[4:31] calendar that 483 years is already
[4:34] finished in the redemption of Israel in
[4:37] the city but the city was tore down and
[4:41] they didn't receive him in Calgary so it
[4:44] must be applied over somewhere else the
[4:48] by all right with that but going we read
[4:52] it before where the wild olive branch
[4:54] would be grafted in which was the
[4:56] Gentiles because remember the Holy Ghost
[4:57] the the first church age 120 were to the
[5:02] Holy Ghost true the dead following God's
[5:04] people seek jesus said I come to my own
[5:06] see he come to the house of Israel but
[5:09] they didn't receive him but the 120 did
[5:11] so the 120 got the Holy Ghost right here
[5:13] on the day of Pentecost and then though
[5:15] Paul says what I turned out to the
[5:18] Gentiles okay Peter open the door but
[5:20] pita Paul's one that went in and
[5:22] nurtured the Gentiles in other words
[5:25] Tata all right so you got a Gentile age
[5:29] right here that's going to come down
[5:30] here to Revelation 41 remember looking
[5:35] your Bible revelations three two and
[5:40] three is your church agent right
[5:44] revelations 2 and 3 tells you about all
[5:47] these church ages okay all right Joe
[5:51] revelations 2 3 is your age is a Gentile
[5:55] age but in Revelations for 1 John says I
[5:58] saw a door open in heaven and I was
[6:00] caught up yep all right now the property
[6:04] guy said that was that was top of the
[6:06] rapture John was caught up and then then
[6:10] the bride
[6:13] the bride is no more sin until
[6:16] revelation 19 20 once when she rides
[6:18] back let's read that let's do that now
[6:21] stop and just make put it in script just
[6:24] give me a second so may remember lecture
[6:27] I 13 always did the way you could pin
[6:30] this would get later revelation for
[6:36] let's read it first this is John after
[6:40] this what after what after these church
[6:42] ages after this he wrote revelations 2
[6:45] and 3 saw the church age has come saw
[6:47] the last church age be the worst and
[6:49] then revelations for one he says after
[6:52] this I looked at me older doors open in
[6:54] heaven the first voice which I heard
[6:56] with as it were of a trumpet trumpet of
[7:00] the Lord Himself time shall be no more
[7:02] the trumpet talking with me which he
[7:04] said come up hither and I will show thee
[7:07] things which must be here after all
[7:11] right God's turning to the Jews now
[7:16] remember spiritually we replied in
[7:18] Revelations 4 12 19 but for revelations
[7:21] 41 revelations 19 is to the redemption
[7:23] of Israel what the property God said
[7:28] right right that's weird Ashley that's
[7:30] Israel's time right right all these
[7:33] things that are going to happen are
[7:35] going to happen from 4 12 19 21 you see
[7:38] why what about revelation 5 everybody
[7:40] since finds redemption the whole Bible
[7:41] wrapped up in Revelation 5 is showing
[7:45] what John was caught up to see heavenly
[7:47] things to me what I glass see it is we i
[7:50] explained his revelations for one if you
[7:52] read it it's setting a stage to show
[7:56] what's fixing to happen one sitting on a
[7:58] throne one god round about the throne
[8:00] with a crystal your lake and all the
[8:03] things you see right here he just
[8:05] settled with Jasper sardine stone round
[8:07] about the throne four and twenty elders
[8:08] the who's four and twenty elders the
[8:13] twelve patriarchs from the white Old
[8:15] Testament and the twelve apostles
[8:19] on the New Testament which we're all to
[8:20] use hmm they're all Cheers global input
[8:28] going well but so there they are all
[8:30] right clothing la crema so this has to
[8:33] be then John was caught up and showed
[8:36] both ways remember properly when a
[8:37] profit goes up he can see both ways he
[8:41] can see it for one waiting to see
[8:42] another all right John is the Eagle
[8:46] right the type of the Eagle top of the
[8:48] bride brother Ryan was top of the ego
[8:50] because he could go up higher than the
[8:52] rest and look all for direction Johnny's
[8:54] looking back in time and he's looking
[8:57] forward in time because remember
[8:59] revelations 5 didn't happen in time and
[9:03] having an eternity the book was written
[9:06] before the foundation of the world when
[9:08] he took that lamb was slain before the
[9:11] foundation or all right redemption is
[9:14] not in heaven redemptions on earth but
[9:17] the culmination of redemption is what we
[9:19] were here come down to here we go back
[9:21] to here now not this chart remember we
[9:24] were we were up here with Adam fall down
[9:27] here we gotta walk go right back to this
[9:29] and put it all back together again I so
[9:32] you see how damn 70 weeks is not just
[9:35] days and times and seasons are putting
[9:37] this here and putting this here but yet
[9:38] if you can put it here in a Jewish time
[9:42] then that's just wonderful it makes you
[9:43] see it a lot better right a revelation
[9:46] for one revelation 19 21 you said what r
[9:48] up one by revelation of ten seven we're
[9:51] going to read in Daniel there is a
[9:52] mighty angel that comes down Michael he
[9:57] fights for Israel okay so you put all
[10:00] these things together then he comes to
[10:03] revelations 10-7 says but in the days of
[10:05] the voice what John's doing he's
[10:06] interpolating he's seen what's happening
[10:08] and he's going how is this going to
[10:10] happen he goes back to Revelation 3
[10:13] knows it aligns it's coming al I just
[10:17] got a return remember John John knows
[10:20] the old testament to remember there is
[10:22] no new testament he's writing in it
[10:24] so he looks back the old testament
[10:26] seasons the malachite has to come but in
[10:29] the days of the voice of Elijah in other
[10:32] words these mysteries will be known and
[10:33] you'll be able to understand revelations
[10:35] 41 relations 19mm because there's a lot
[10:37] of strange things that goes on in there
[10:39] that man never knew anything about man
[10:43] never knew how to place these things
[10:44] that's my brother Dale said they told
[10:46] stay out of Revelations you kind of
[10:48] understand revelations 1 2 & 3 that's to
[10:50] church ages but what when you get for
[10:52] one he's up he's here he's redemption
[10:55] door this way and reductions over in
[10:58] Revelations files anything but we got to
[11:02] put them together it's like a puzzle
[11:03] take piece here piece here a piece here
[11:05] and put them together and it makes a
[11:07] beautiful picture so revelations 41
[11:10] revelations 1921 it is going to happen
[11:13] because watch what brother Brown says in
[11:15] your book he says the woman in the Sun
[11:18] the red dragon testing out the red
[11:20] dragon teen a vile plagues the seals all
[11:25] happen between 41 and 19 21 and they're
[11:29] going to happen in this 70th week 90 94
[11:33] 7 okay but you gotta have something
[11:35] leading up to it because God's already
[11:38] said that 70 years determined so there's
[11:41] going to be four hundred ninety years of
[11:43] this redemption process just like there
[11:46] was there was a 38 year process of me to
[11:52] be morning in 38 of your process okay
[11:57] same way with you whatever day is born
[11:59] again there was a put your put your time
[12:02] in there that was a process from that
[12:04] time you said no i was living in saying
[12:06] i didn't care yeah you didn't but there
[12:09] was somebody yeah he knew where he is
[12:13] gonna come to remember believers get
[12:16] angels when they're born they don't mean
[12:18] believers are believers when they're
[12:19] born that means believers get an angel
[12:21] when they're born because that angel and
[12:23] God the only two people that know what
[12:24] you're going to do you don't not staying
[12:27] about that today yes this morning free
[12:30] moral agency you're still a freeman
[12:32] related I don't care for your morning it
[12:35] or not you're still free my lady
[12:37] but an ultra not free moral agent though
[12:41] I was just thinking from conception to
[12:44] the day of your birth that's why they're
[12:47] born in a day well the preparation
[12:49] coordinate for me before noon that's
[12:51] correct that's a good that's a good
[12:53] analogy and good process you see that
[12:55] from conception of the baby that's nine
[12:57] months until live birth comes in a day
[13:01] you were born in a day yes okay so when
[13:05] you say here's was born today that
[13:07] doesn't mean all 144,000 is going to
[13:08] gather together they gonna preach one
[13:10] sermon and they all will get born again
[13:11] I don't see that because what in the
[13:14] world else are they gonna do for 1250
[13:15] nine days what I'm saying is what's
[13:21] going to happen it's just like it
[13:22] happens now they're going to start
[13:24] preaching right here and then going to
[13:26] say and I don't understand it I ain't
[13:27] going to hear no more i'm done i'm going
[13:29] away i'm coming back i enjoy what he's
[13:32] saying i don't enjoy what they're saying
[13:33] i don't care what they're saying what
[13:36] people do now same thing so this is
[13:38] going to take 1260 days for them to
[13:40] gather those people together maybe not
[13:42] in one place but in 1921 court okay to
[13:47] receive the Holy go in a day their day
[13:52] because remember I always I always think
[13:55] the Lord for the day I said lord thank
[13:57] you for the day I don't mean the 24-hour
[13:59] day you know they don't mean 24-hour day
[14:01] cuz we're not living in an hour or so
[14:03] we're not living in 24-hour day don't
[14:06] think living in 24-hour days this this
[14:08] thing right hand what you're saying okay
[14:10] you're you're sold already sitting in
[14:12] heavenly places we just got to
[14:13] understand that alright so now where we
[14:17] have revelation for so we go through
[14:19] revelation 4 5 6 7 on down through there
[14:22] and we see the death to the Jews you see
[14:25] what about the sealed the Celtic to the
[14:27] Jews
[14:32] rage the steelbook brother ramshead the
[14:37] stake sale are these to profit but we're
[14:40] going when these two prophets our own
[14:41] insane remember we get the spiritual
[14:45] aspect of it we get the spiritual
[14:48] breaking of the seal remember Jesus
[14:52] preached six seals back 2,000 years ago
[14:56] and he was number seven plays a lot of
[15:02] those with this but let's focus on this
[15:05] one week and put it in the Bible okay so
[15:07] what's going to happen if while we're in
[15:08] Revelations let's go to Revelation 7 get
[15:16] thick sticky honey now some revelation 7
[15:25] verse 4 and I heard the number of them
[15:27] which were sealed with how many 144,000
[15:32] that's all that's going to be sealing to
[15:35] give the old blood drive got it all
[15:38] right so we know for a fact that two
[15:41] profits are going to preface out and
[15:44] 144,000 is going to come in now let's go
[15:46] to revelations 12
[15:57] because remember we're leaving out a lot
[15:59] about the revelation living right does
[16:04] giving me a reed like unto a ride the
[16:07] angel stood saying rise and measure the
[16:09] temple of God the author of them that
[16:10] worship therein but the core which is
[16:13] without the temple leave out and measure
[16:14] it Nava is given to the Gentile be we
[16:20] got to come in somewhere and the holy
[16:22] city shall they tread under foot forty
[16:25] two months how much is 42 months three
[16:30] and a half years count it up 12 times
[16:32] three is 36 plus 6 it's 42 months of
[16:40] 30-day months not 31 and 32 and 19 and
[16:44] 29 and all that you know we got to leave
[16:48] here this year got an extra day remember
[16:52] this put it under your tab every
[16:53] presidential election year is a leap
[16:56] year happens that way all the time it's
[16:59] like Christmas come on the twenty-fifth
[17:00] to come December hometown but if you
[17:04] will know when we leave yours coming out
[17:06] just look at your election year the
[17:07] election year is your leap year all
[17:09] right give the politicians one more date
[17:11] a lot yes and that dish one on the
[17:16] Internet I hear black helicopters yeah
[17:21] I'm a politician now see y'all acting
[17:23] like careful I'm a small one I'm a
[17:25] constable I'm a commission all right
[17:30] verse 3 captain I'm a councilman I'm I
[17:35] work I work for the city of gilfer and I
[17:38] will give power unto my two witnesses
[17:39] and they shall prophesy a thousand two
[17:42] hundred and threescore days now what is
[17:46] three school or we've been through three
[17:48] scoring in 16 3 times 2 3 score three
[17:52] times two is six sixty so one thousand
[17:56] two are six today I probably want to go
[17:58] written right here ok got it Rover I
[18:01] think 260 days
[18:04] clothed in sackcloth these are the two
[18:07] olive trees and the two candlesticks
[18:09] standing before the god of the earth if
[18:11] any man will hurt them fire proceedeth
[18:12] out of the mouth and divide up the enemy
[18:14] and if any man will hurt them he must
[18:16] excuse me being this mayor of kill these
[18:19] have power to shut heaven this one
[18:21] brother I'm thoughts about them being
[18:22] part of that sixth seal they can open it
[18:24] in town they can control nature now
[18:27] these two prophets are not just remember
[18:31] they're going to Israel it's not Gentile
[18:33] no James I will be saved once they start
[18:36] there once once we gonna wrap sure
[18:38] there's no Gentile saved after this
[18:40] point right here now you got to go way
[18:43] over to the white throne judgment before
[18:48] any Gentiles ever be saving in got it
[18:50] yeah that's way I see it because they
[18:54] don't because the dead and living not
[18:55] maybe even guys stayed there for that
[18:57] whole thousand years all right okay if
[19:00] you're not born again if you're not in
[19:01] Christ dead in Christ we're dead in
[19:05] Christ now because we're dead in Christ
[19:08] now we're just going to rise because
[19:10] we're dead in Christ now we're not like
[19:12] they said don't know there's no dead
[19:14] people in Christ it's the dead in Christ
[19:17] we died when we got in your birth we die
[19:19] so we're dead here already all right so
[19:22] we're just going to raise because of
[19:23] what the death here all right then
[19:27] you're sleeping right now they these
[19:30] have power to shut heaven that it rain
[19:31] down the days of the prophecy and have
[19:33] power over waters to turn them to blood
[19:35] smite the earth with all plagues as
[19:37] often as they will all right so there's
[19:41] your tribulation cuz I don't know that I
[19:45] can't I don't have anything to base this
[19:48] on but I don't think they're just going
[19:52] to call
[19:54] just own the little city of it of
[19:57] Jerusalem the whole earth yeah the sixth
[20:05] seal opens it takes control the nature
[20:07] of the whole earth not just in the city
[20:09] of Jerusalem you understand what I'm
[20:10] saying sometimes we're narrow-minded and
[20:13] really we are we're so narrow-minded we
[20:15] said well that's just to the Jews it is
[20:16] but they can't look it doesn't give a
[20:19] stipulation smite the one earth not
[20:22] Jerusalem not my city is smite the earth
[20:25] with all plagues so they can fire a play
[20:28] golf anymore they want to okay don't
[20:31] make these two guys mad course we won't
[20:34] be around to see it but that's okay and
[20:40] when they shall have finished their
[20:42] testimony now look they got a promise I
[20:43] 1260 days right what the Bible says they
[20:47] must prophesied 1260 days and when they
[20:51] shall have finished their testimony in
[20:52] other words when they've got all that
[20:55] 144,000 born again by the preaching of
[20:59] their message the Beast that ascends us
[21:01] out of the bottomless pit shall make war
[21:03] against them and shall overcome them and
[21:06] kill them now that's when the Beast
[21:09] breaks his covenant in the midst of the
[21:12] week hey where'd you get that and your
[21:18] land owner Daniel 9 now I'm going to
[21:21] just turn to it now routine Daniel 9
[21:24] says and he we established verse 27
[21:29] Daniel 9 says and he is the Antichrist
[21:32] because God doesn't make a covenant and
[21:34] then break it alright and that's a
[21:36] little age and he shall confirm the
[21:39] covenant with many for one week he's
[21:44] going to make a seven-year deal with
[21:45] Israel and in my words let me tell you
[21:49] what's going to happen he's going to
[21:52] give them back the menorah he's gonna
[21:53] give them back the Holy of Holies he's
[21:55] gonna give them all their parts that
[21:56] they need to start temple worship again
[21:58] cuz they know they gotta get temple
[22:00] worship here and they know light has got
[22:02] to come back before the Messiah
[22:05] out but there no they're not gonna see
[22:08] that my side when I do this means Jesus
[22:11] is not going to be standing on the earth
[22:12] alright but watch what taken just a
[22:15] minute and he shall confirm the covenant
[22:17] with many for one week and in the midst
[22:21] of the week what's the middle of 73 and
[22:24] a half so after 1260 days that's why I'm
[22:28] saying people I don't care what the
[22:30] balcon I don't care what ppl the message
[22:33] say let me put it this way I don't care
[22:38] what brother Brown says if he's wrong
[22:39] but he's not he's saying what the Bible
[22:43] says he has to be a word prophet man you
[22:46] see I'm trying McDonald left it man 40
[22:52] years in the message and he leaves
[22:54] because he didn't see a brown bear
[22:55] getting killed or 16 people fall off a
[22:57] bridge or our brother Brown being wrong
[23:00] and all these doctors I honestly do not
[23:04] care if 16 people fell off a bridge and
[23:07] I want to be real honest with that I
[23:08] really back to me they ain't got nothing
[23:11] to do with the revelation that brother
[23:13] random brought from God to give to us
[23:17] for our revelation and for our purpose
[23:20] to get us out of here that has nothing
[23:22] to do a show well if it's false prophet
[23:29] you prove that that's something he saw
[23:32] as a vision when he was young that's
[23:34] correct but they found there's no
[23:36] documentation that ever happened there's
[23:39] documentation that one person fell off
[23:41] that bridge and died now listen people
[23:44] back in the nineteen hundred there was
[23:46] no OSHA there was no safety regulations
[23:50] and if you'll remember the lawyer or
[23:53] whoever that was to give the testimony
[23:55] said the men fell off the bridge but
[23:57] they fell down in the concrete and they
[24:01] died in the concrete and there's no way
[24:03] they're gonna dig them out they just
[24:05] said sayonara we love you bless your
[24:07] heart and all that stuff and filled it
[24:08] all the way on up so yeah that's what I
[24:12] mean you know they're picking it
[24:13] something they don't see the essence of
[24:15] the
[24:16] different man leaves a message in 40
[24:18] after 40 years of preaching the message
[24:20] and Sam brother Brown said that's what I
[24:22] want to call him I got so mad when he
[24:23] was preaching that he kept saying the
[24:24] profit if he don't think he's a profit
[24:26] stop calling him one if you don't
[24:28] believe this message stop stop saying
[24:30] the message saved of Mac the Prophet you
[24:33] stop playing it just stopped tear it up
[24:36] throw it away don't just start preaching
[24:37] about our something I that they test for
[24:41] everybody sign at the time or something
[24:43] I change that yeah watch what I believe
[24:46] Sam Sam Sam a blade of time anyway so
[24:51] let's get my mouth my sofa and he shall
[24:54] confirm the covenant with many for one
[24:55] week because loved it Daniel 7 two weeks
[24:58] is a very big controversy in the message
[25:00] very big huge and that's why a lot of
[25:04] people when they leave the message they
[25:05] say that's the second thing they say
[25:07] first is the cloud vision and second is
[25:10] brother branham was so wrong in day and
[25:11] seventy weeks that they don't even you
[25:14] know to them that was just a wasted
[25:15] three sermons again but yes I'm sorry
[25:19] it'd be nice to see because I still
[25:22] would like to see what it is that they
[25:24] say that how they explain Daniel 17
[25:27] weeks and maybe after week well there is
[25:28] i am going to because they explained
[25:30] just by quote right they do not
[25:32] explained by the Bible that was one
[25:35] brother got so confused trying to
[25:36] explain it till he grilled he drew his
[25:38] own chart he put scriptures in that me
[25:40] and Claude looked at each other and we
[25:41] were like 12 world's anti-gay I mean
[25:43] skype in the message 40 years to and he
[25:46] what he did what you do though is is
[25:48] when you destroy somebody's doctrine you
[25:52] destroyed what he's built his cell phone
[25:55] and you can't take it if you ain't got
[25:57] if you're not right here at Bradley
[26:01] kindness you can't take it so you latch
[26:03] out and that's what he did he blindly
[26:06] lashed out didn't hit it in the church
[26:08] here physically but he tried to do it
[26:10] later on in this in his own church and
[26:12] drawing his own charts which is not even
[26:14] nothing close to what we proven that
[26:17] these states are right he never even
[26:19] took any of this he was just proving
[26:22] their brother brown said there's only
[26:23] three and a half years left after the
[26:24] rapture and there is a twelve hundred
[26:27] and sixty that he simply
[26:29] two prophets ministries like I said much
[26:35] time okay all right look at that Messiah
[26:40] week that's right that's what they miss
[26:43] they missed the Son of Man ministry week
[26:46] three and a half here mmm three and a
[26:49] half here that's that week they don't
[26:52] see they don't see this mystery of this
[26:54] 3000 three and a half right here so did
[26:57] Jesus prophesied the first half but he's
[27:00] coming back to the Jews who prophesied
[27:01] last night but what they're saying is
[27:03] they're saying this three and a half
[27:04] years is already by going in there's
[27:06] only this talk left 460 days there's
[27:09] only that nine out of ten the people who
[27:12] messaged believe that's all this time is
[27:13] left but we're going to prove by the
[27:15] libel we're getting today and by the
[27:19] prophets message and by the moon the
[27:22] Jewish calendar that you in 1260 days
[27:27] ends and that and where we were at right
[27:32] here revelation 11 well there's 12 13 14
[27:36] 15 because after 1260 days watch when
[27:44] they finish their testimony the Beast of
[27:45] Senator Obama's pitch shall make war
[27:47] against them show overcoming any
[27:48] children so their dead in the midst of
[27:51] the week when he's going to do he's
[27:52] going to make a real nice covenant with
[27:54] you the Jews the Antichrist the Pope
[27:56] he's going to give them this stuff and
[27:58] they're going to start temple worship
[28:00] but these two prophets are going to come
[28:02] on the sand say look temple worship went
[28:07] out back here the one you crucified yeah
[28:13] the one you crucified is the true Lamb
[28:16] that y'all are missing so what's going
[28:19] to happen to the regular jeans they're
[28:21] going to get real lab because they waste
[28:23] they've wasted to their to their point
[28:25] they wasted two thousand years you'll
[28:27] see once this temple was destroyed never
[28:29] been rebuilt never been rebuilt back
[28:33] that's why the Jews do all this time
[28:35] they're trying to they had to get back
[28:37] to the homeland we all look at some
[28:40] things about 19 16
[28:41] about the the six-day war wait things
[28:46] c67 wait name is six table or 19 seats
[28:49] it's my favorite six-day war we'll see
[28:52] something a little bit but it all
[28:56] connects with them coming back goes
[28:58] really if you look on your charge
[29:00] brother rebel dream he's an easy feeling
[29:04] a little flap over up there because god
[29:08] I can't start dealing with them because
[29:10] this church age is going to end when we
[29:12] go on the rapture but in 1947 they
[29:15] became a nation that's when God started
[29:17] dealing with them bringing them back
[29:19] okay all right there my okay with it so
[29:25] far I'm training your brain okay all
[29:29] right 1260 days now what's going to
[29:31] happen he's going to give them all their
[29:33] material and they're gonna start doing
[29:35] animal sacrifices trying to get them
[29:38] aside back that's their whole point they
[29:41] missed him over here so that they know
[29:43] the massage coming to Israel he told him
[29:45] in the Old Testament come all right many
[29:48] many times he told him I'm coming to you
[29:50] you're my beloved you're my one right
[29:52] all right and they know that the
[29:54] Gentiles are going to come in but they
[29:56] can't lay it out like the prophet of God
[29:59] laid it out forth so head during this
[30:03] time the two properties are come on the
[30:04] scene what they're going to do they're
[30:05] going to preach that you miss them aside
[30:10] you've already crucified him preach
[30:13] basically the same sermon Peter did on
[30:14] the bed penticoff you who in Jerusalem
[30:17] have killed by this man you call Jesus
[30:20] you've killed both Lord and Christ you
[30:22] killed it all right and then 144,000 is
[30:26] going to start coming out but then other
[30:28] old Jews this is now its temple worship
[30:31] he's not come yet see that's where the
[30:33] fighting is going to be I believe that
[30:36] the their friends their Jewish
[30:39] counterparts are going to kill them
[30:40] because they're all going to be killed
[30:42] I'm forty four thousand plus the two
[30:44] prophets you're going to be killed well
[30:45] who's not a Gentile don't care
[30:50] and this time the Gentile was just
[30:51] trying to survive there you're going
[30:53] through the tribulation period they're
[30:55] just trying to survive they really don't
[30:56] care what's going on in Israel okay but
[30:59] Israel does but these two prophets
[31:02] preached Jesus so much to them until
[31:03] they I will read it in just in a min
[31:06] Tanaka right when they shall I finish
[31:08] their testimony the Beast of the Senate
[31:10] I Obama's pitch you'll make war against
[31:11] them and shall overcome them and kill
[31:13] them so other one in other words if
[31:15] that's true then the 70 weeks tops right
[31:19] here here's my point look what look now
[31:24] that finishes the transgression of
[31:25] Israel that ends their sin and
[31:27] reconciles their iniquity but their six
[31:31] things has got to go on before that 70th
[31:34] week is over how are you going to do it
[31:37] once they're gone I mean they're going
[31:39] to take a rack from their goal you got
[31:44] to bring in everlasting righteousness
[31:45] fill up the vision and prompted enter
[31:47] North the most holy all right so I
[31:50] finally brother Brown said seven times
[31:52] in the den 70 weeks book on the last
[31:55] book he said there's one week left after
[31:57] the rapture there is one week of work of
[31:59] earthly time because what happens right
[32:02] here and we're going to we're going to
[32:03] nail this thing down on our feast days
[32:07] all right cuz we're gonna read it
[32:08] somethin bout a feast in just a few
[32:10] minutes I doubt it but we'll try and
[32:12] their dead bodies shall weigh on the
[32:15] street of the great city which
[32:16] spiritually called Sodom and Egypt where
[32:18] Lord of two spots with Jerusalem mm-hmm
[32:20] they are the people candid and tonga
[32:22] nations shall see their dead body that's
[32:24] where like I said CNN and Fox News they
[32:27] go all show cuz hey look if he if them
[32:30] to them to people are going to be the
[32:32] two most hated people you think Osama
[32:34] bin Laden take the whole world's going
[32:36] to hate these two guns and they gonna
[32:38] love seeing laying in the street okay
[32:40] okay and they'd go phone the earth shall
[32:43] rejoice over them and make merry chefs
[32:46] in gifts one to another because the east
[32:47] two prophets tormented them that dwelt
[32:50] on the earth not just Jerusalem through
[32:51] the whole earth and after three days and
[32:54] a half left kind of three and a half
[32:55] days
[32:59] types of three and a half years they
[33:00] creak all right the spirit of life from
[33:05] God entered into them and what about
[33:06] seeing in going after three and a half
[33:08] days they go look pretty rough really
[33:12] yeah I mean they go either get shot up
[33:14] or pull through the streets or you know
[33:16] how many people are going to do when
[33:17] they killed somebody and they don't be
[33:19] bloated and just be honest but look
[33:21] what's going to happen is the spirit of
[33:23] life from God entered them and they
[33:27] stood upon their feet and great fear
[33:28] fell upon them we saw them and they
[33:31] heard a great sports from heaven saying
[33:32] them coming Tennessee that's their
[33:34] actress all right and they ascended up
[33:37] to heaven in a cloud their enemies
[33:38] beheld them all right remember then I
[33:40] all heck breaks loose after all this
[33:42] time okay everybody got that so we're
[33:45] right here now that came into seventy
[33:49] weeks of Daniel where you got to cook
[33:51] the Bible off right there okay let's
[33:54] just be calm how common sense then you
[33:56] cut them that's why real Brown had to
[33:58] say it as one week left down to the
[33:59] rector because biblically there was one
[34:01] week left after the rapture one week of
[34:03] earthly time that's left after the
[34:06] rector you can see what in the whole
[34:07] world would be against funny just now I
[34:09] notice it because the state of what they
[34:13] can bring on your chart what they say
[34:15] gent also hate you pinned I'll go hate
[34:18] them because what happened is is
[34:22] somebody will be messing with them and
[34:24] they'll just call fire down over on in
[34:26] Russia and it'll just blow up you know
[34:28] or burn 10,000 people well don't you
[34:31] think they gonna be ill when you don't
[34:33] see them use no weapons of war you know
[34:36] bombs and all my stuff they're just
[34:38] calling it out of their mouth and nature
[34:39] it's doing it that's why they control
[34:42] nature on that stick sealed that's why
[34:45] I'm due over 60 revealed to you is it
[34:47] it's a total disruption of this nature
[34:49] your nature that's why we get the
[34:52] spiritual part then it goes to the
[34:55] natural quarter okay all right don't you
[34:58] think that sexy if that's what this is
[35:03] come on two three four five six seven
[35:06] all these right here but you started
[35:07] faith add to your faith 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6
[35:16] cm you put the seals right in these will
[35:20] try to do it maybe one day later but six
[35:25] seals finishes our Redemption because
[35:27] right this is the total disruption to
[35:29] your nature because you were born
[35:30] contrary to God on every one of these
[35:33] these are not human virtues these are
[35:37] not these are your human virtues with
[35:41] God putting his virtue not remember
[35:45] where I preach them on virtue faith yes
[35:48] okay you gotta you gotta have you
[35:50] everything's out of your faith knowledge
[35:52] faith temperance faith patients faith
[35:54] and all these all this faith that's what
[35:56] we have to have to get us out of here
[35:58] here so it's a true revelation of the
[36:01] seal or the seal opening will come
[36:03] during this time but it can't happen in
[36:05] just 1260 days now that's just common
[36:08] sense you're not just bible reading
[36:09] simple bible reading there's more time
[36:12] way up after the 1260 day yes all right
[36:15] now you won't go somewhere else let's go
[36:19] to Zach right
[36:23] I had it up here for one year end route
[36:27] 13 all right Zach around 13 ground right
[36:33] at the end of the Bible run 13 and watch
[36:37] this and that day that should be a
[36:39] fountain open to the house of David into
[36:41] the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and
[36:43] uncleanness now watch this what's all
[36:46] this we're going to read it he shall
[36:48] come to pass in that day see then be
[36:51] born in a day that day they shall come
[36:55] to pass in that day saith the lord of
[36:56] hosts that I will cut off the names of
[36:58] the idols out of the land and they shall
[36:59] no more be remembered and also i will
[37:01] cause the prophets and the unclean
[37:03] spirits to pass out look I will end it
[37:05] shall come to pass that when he any show
[37:07] you prophesied then his father his
[37:09] mother that we got him to send to him
[37:10] thou shall not live for thou speaketh
[37:12] lies in the name of the Lord there's
[37:15] always been fault right and his father
[37:19] and his mother they've got him so trust
[37:21] thrust him through when he prophesied of
[37:23] these Falls and came to pass in that day
[37:25] and it shall come to pass in that day
[37:28] that the prophets shall be ashamed
[37:30] everyone of this vision when you have
[37:31] prophesied neither shall they wear a
[37:33] rough garment to the sea now I
[37:35] understand that but you know one thing's
[37:37] for sure when them to prophets raise up
[37:39] there's going to be fault there's going
[37:41] to be some imitations come out always
[37:44] happen brother Graham comes on saying
[37:46] everybody won't lay hands on sitting
[37:47] don't look okay but he shall say I have
[37:51] no profit island husbandmen for man
[37:52] called me to keep cow for me you look
[37:55] burst sex and once you're saying to him
[37:57] what are these wounds in that hand where
[38:00] was Jesus wounded in hands and feet
[38:03] where are they what are these wounds in
[38:06] thine hands then he shall answer those
[38:08] with which I was wounded in the house of

[38:53] the baby remember Joseph and Benjamin
[38:55] were the only two that were that were
[38:58] brothers by Rachel all right Rachel

[39:10] was always asking about Benjamin
[39:12] Reverend Joseph every time they come he
[39:14] said where's Benjamin house Benjamin

[39:32] stop right here because we're going to
[39:35] read the rest of that next week but I'm
[39:37] let's read one thing go to daniel 9
[39:40] something i was looking at the other day
[39:42] and i don't think i don't think i've
[39:44] ever seen this before

[39:57] I'm sorry sorry Daniel 12 all right I
[40:02] want you to I want you to chew on this
[40:03] from that Sunday yes Daniel 12 says and
[40:06] at that time Michael shall stand up the
[40:08] great friends now who's that that's
[40:09] Michael coming coming to to his people
[40:12] right all right keep going down telling
[40:18] Daniel is shut up to shut up the words
[40:20] and seal the book burst forward to the
[40:22] time the end knowledge young creep they

[41:04] Clea none of the wicked shall understand
[41:06] with your wise shall understand 11 verse
[41:08] 11 I never seen this before I want you
[41:10] to see why what kind of interpretation
[41:12] you have this who couldn't now the
[41:14] people the message says that that the
[41:17] this is it alright there's only three
[41:19] and a half years left out for the
[41:20] rapture coo coo now Daniel 9 says that
[41:24] that he shall make a covenant with many
[41:26] for one week and in the midst of week
[41:28] he'll break the Covenant and the
[41:30] abomination in other words he's going to
[41:32] come into the temple and say I'm God
[41:33] right right and then why the Daniel 9
[41:37] say it says once you're through here in
