[18:28] amen
[18:29] amen Revelations
[18:34] 1 says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[18:37] which God gave unto him to sh unto his
[18:40] servants things which must shortly come
[18:43] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[18:45] his Angel unto his servant John who by
[18:48] record of the word of God and of the
[18:50] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[18:52] things that he saw blessed is he that
[18:55] readeth and they that hear the words of
[18:57] this prophecy see and keep those things
[18:59] which are written therein for the time
[19:02] is at hand the time to understand right
[19:05] right all right 1 Peter 1
[19:08] ver9 receiving the end of your faith
[19:12] even the salvation of your souls of
[19:14] which salvation the prophets have
[19:16] inquired and searched diligently who
[19:19] prophesied of the grace that should come
[19:21] unto you right searching what or what
[19:24] manner of time the spirit of Christ
[19:26] which was in them did signify when it
[19:30] testified before him the sufferings of
[19:32] Christ and the glory that should follow
[19:34] unto whom it was revealed now see it was
[19:37] revealed to them that they it wasn't to
[19:39] them all right unto whom it was revealed
[19:42] that unto that not unto themselves but
[19:46] unto us they did Minister the things
[19:48] which are now reported unto you by them
[19:50] which have preached the gospel unto you
[19:54] with the Holy Ghost sent down from
[19:56] heaven which things the angels desire to
[19:58] look into wherefore G up the loins of
[20:01] your mind be sober and hope to the end
[20:04] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[20:06] you when at the revelation of Jesus
[20:11] Christ you may be seated did the Lord
[20:12] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[20:14] word now I know we have the thing to do
[20:17] but you're going in and
[20:21] out we pull it in and out
[20:26] something y
[20:31] we I chose today to uh run off the
[20:35] copies for you in our will the Lord's
[20:36] willing this
[20:37] afternoon um
[20:40] because I I've I've been thinking a lot
[20:44] on this trying to get up to a place to
[20:47] speak what the Lord willing we get there
[20:49] this afternoon we we be trying to to
[20:53] speak upon him and uh you know in that
[20:57] way the Lord is is good to us and he
[20:59] opened more of a better way uh one day
[21:03] there while brother Donnie and I were
[21:05] talking and fellowshipping and during
[21:07] the time being there maybe a a way of
[21:11] presenting something that I've had on my
[21:13] heart that I wanted to bring to you but
[21:16] basically what I want to do this
[21:19] morning I want to give you these or you
[21:22] can go home and if you'll follow it and
[21:24] just go down the line 1 2 3 4 then you
[21:28] you will you know the numbers on the
[21:30] quotes I'm giving you you will um I hope
[21:34] get an understanding these quotes have
[21:36] been given unto you uh the last service
[21:39] I preached I preached a lot about this
[21:41] but I want to make sure you understand
[21:44] this because what I have upon my heart
[21:47] would be no need of trying to progress
[21:50] further if you don't understand up to
[21:54] the point of what we're we've been
[21:56] trying to bring about the Book of
[21:57] Revelation so you know just bear with me
[22:00] and and and and everything Paul said it
[22:03] didn't bother him to say things twice so
[22:06] I guess it don't bother me to say I'm
[22:07] about
[22:09] 8,432 cuz that's probably about how many
[22:11] times I've said this and you know and
[22:13] been talking but I want to get it to a
[22:17] place that we can see so I just asked
[22:20] the question you know brother random
[22:22] said chapter 5 of Revelation Was
[22:25] preparing for the opening of the Seven
[22:29] Seals all right then I'm asking the
[22:31] question this morning
[22:33] basically are we
[22:36] prepared to understand are we
[22:41] prepared now you know it what no Hy
[22:44] Hazard thing that John was taken to
[22:47] patmas I saw that while uh brother seran
[22:51] and I really enjoyed his message but I
[22:54] was following his message along there
[22:56] Wednesday night and I saw something that
[22:59] you know I thought well I need to
[23:01] express that a little you know it wasn't
[23:03] no halfhazard thing that John was the
[23:06] one picked to go to patas even if you
[23:09] take the uh Gospel of Matthew Mark Luke
[23:11] and John you know the combat Beast and
[23:14] the things that brother Brandon would
[23:16] refer to and he would say you know like
[23:19] Matthew was the the line Mark the ox uh
[23:23] you know Luke the man and John the eagle
[23:27] and he was more into the prophetic form
[23:30] and he was chosen now so there had to be
[23:33] certain
[23:36] qualifications why did not God wait
[23:38] until PA came on the scene even to bring
[23:43] about the Book of
[23:45] Revelations that could have easily been
[23:47] done but it was for the point that it
[23:51] had to be a specific
[23:53] person all right now that you know that
[23:57] went to Pats all right the specific
[24:00] purpose or person who went there and
[24:05] then to see that there must be as we
[24:08] covered in one service there or spoke a
[24:11] few times about it it takes a special
[24:15] people to understand this book of
[24:19] Revelations brother R said it couldn't
[24:21] be done in Luther's age Wesley's age or
[24:23] the Pentecostal
[24:25] age It could only be understood in this
[24:28] age so it would have to be special
[24:30] people who would be
[24:33] prepared to uh you know to do and I'm
[24:37] not throwing no stones or making LI or
[24:39] jokes I'm just saying it
[24:42] um some trinitarian wouldn't it have
[24:45] been something to send a trinitarian
[24:47] Believer to patmas to write the Book of
[24:50] Revelations now we know it wouldn't have
[24:52] been done you know I mean but I'm just
[24:54] making a point by that to dig into your
[24:57] mind a little so that you'll think on it
[25:00] it had to be a specific person who had a
[25:03] an understanding all right and see then
[25:06] you and I must have the understanding
[25:08] that's right see we're the people then
[25:11] there's not another people to come amen
[25:13] all right we've never said you know
[25:16] time's over with or anything like that
[25:18] uh you know we tried to make it as right
[25:20] as we can but I believe we're the end
[25:23] time people I believe we're the people
[25:25] that it says it's time to understand yes
[25:28] all right and then in doing that I want
[25:30] us to make sure that we get the right
[25:35] foundation because uh wouldn't it be
[25:38] something to take somebody that would
[25:40] say uh you know uh that have a a degree
[25:44] in
[25:46] electronics and uh I said well we're
[25:48] going to have a good speaker this
[25:50] afternoon said we've got a choice of
[25:53] having a person who has a degree in
[25:56] electronics or or you can have your
[25:59] choice of whether you want him to speak
[26:00] or
[26:02] Einstein now what kind of a choice would
[26:04] it be you
[26:07] know all right and see that was what God
[26:09] was doing he had all of the Apostles and
[26:12] things that he could have
[26:14] taken Peter was a great one he opened
[26:17] the doors to the kingdom see all of
[26:19] those were but John was
[26:22] special and even in his life he was
[26:24] special he was the young one that leaned
[26:26] upon the the bosom of the Lord you know
[26:28] he was the young one that was always
[26:30] close with him it was always when like a
[26:33] healing would take place John would
[26:36] always be there see because he was
[26:38] special all right now then I believe you
[26:42] know you and I are special people amen I
[26:45] don't mean just Lula Georgia I'm not
[26:48] talking junk I'm talking to the world if
[26:51] they'll listen to it of whatever is out
[26:53] there you know that can and uh I do know
[26:57] for sure that that this message is going
[26:59] into a lot of foreign countries it's not
[27:01] like
[27:03] brother Lincoln Barner said one time
[27:05] they had a little radio station up there
[27:07] and said he probably reach out about 20
[27:09] miles you know so this preacher gets on
[27:12] the radio and he says hello
[27:15] world they only go out 20 miles but we
[27:19] do know this goes out a whole lot fun
[27:21] the 20 M but every who's supposed to
[27:24] hear will hear and receive and you know
[27:27] in appreciate it appreciate these
[27:28] brothers for doing all of that to
[27:30] getting it
[27:32] ready but
[27:35] now we spent a lot of
[27:38] time reading and talking of chapter 4
[27:44] and then we went in and started in
[27:46] chapter 5 and we spent a lot of time up
[27:50] to verse 7 now this afternoon we will
[27:53] pick up the Lord willing on verse 8 and
[27:58] we will try to continue you know our
[28:00] thought but I want to make sure you
[28:04] understand as I said the prophet said
[28:07] this
[28:08] was a preparation for the opening of The
[28:11] Seven Seals All right
[28:14] now he said we must get the preparation
[28:17] correct oh yeah right okay what do you
[28:20] mean brother Dale seals broke long time
[28:23] ago yeah that's what people say
[28:31] but how they broke to you and I amen
[28:35] right amen the sealed is the revelation
[28:37] of Jesus Christ not the Antichrist we'll
[28:40] get on that this
[28:43] afternoon so then has Christ been
[28:45] revealed to
[28:47] you or is your Christ brother
[28:52] Brandon there's a brother man sends me
[28:56] books every once in a while and
[28:58] he's named his children Christ brother
[29:00] Christ brandom so and so you know and
[29:03] that's what he believes he he you know
[29:05] their deities and things and we
[29:07] certainly don't believe that but we
[29:09] believe that the Lord Jesus Christ did
[29:11] use a man to bring us a message that's
[29:13] what we believe that's all we try to
[29:15] bring if if you was a presbyterian you
[29:17] didn't want to go after whoever you
[29:18] wanted or whatever or Methodist Baptist
[29:21] or
[29:21] Lutheran but now think of
[29:26] it now we've talked a lot about that no
[29:30] man was worthy to take the book all
[29:35] right so then it's not a the lamb wasn't
[29:39] a
[29:41] animal you know it couldn't take the
[29:43] book all right and we'll get back to it
[29:46] after a while of this what this lamb
[29:49] looks like but the main thing I want us
[29:52] to take is brother uh Anderson go ahead
[29:56] and pull up Revelations
[29:59] 5 and I want us to just think a little
[30:03] bit you say well we've been over this
[30:05] and over this we do it if you want to
[30:07] get up and go home you're welcome I'll
[30:09] go over it again whether you're here or
[30:11] whether you're
[30:13] not okay right that's just the best way
[30:16] of saying it you know you got your
[30:18] choice you got your keys in your
[30:20] pocket not trying to run nobody off just
[30:23] be blunt right amen and just plain about
[30:26] it but what it says and I saw in the
[30:28] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[30:30] a book written within and on the
[30:32] backside seal with Seven Seals that's
[30:34] right now you really
[30:37] understand these are
[30:40] symbolics you know a throne you're not
[30:44] looking at a throne the throne is the
[30:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost is living in
[30:47] your heart all right I hope that's
[30:50] caught on right all right and we know
[30:52] the right hand is the power and
[30:54] authority of almighty God that's right
[30:56] not one sitting on the right hand right
[30:59] you know the power and authority that's
[31:02] right and then we got down and spent
[31:04] quite a time dealing with this
[31:08] book that was in the hand of the one on
[31:11] the
[31:13] throne and
[31:15] uh it's not
[31:18] a scoffield or Thompson Chain or
[31:21] anything amen it's not a book like we
[31:25] talk about because back then they didn't
[31:27] have books right when it was translated
[31:30] into the King James it was brought over
[31:34] because they were beginning to pick up
[31:35] words and things and using the word book
[31:39] all right but it was originally we went
[31:40] through that it was some Scrolls MH that
[31:43] were written all
[31:45] right but yet we went through to seeing
[31:48] that this book in the hand of the one on
[31:50] the throne was the
[31:52] book that was actually placed before
[31:58] Adam Y and you know but yet because of
[32:02] the
[32:04] Fall then the book went back to the hand
[32:07] of the original owner amen and brother R
[32:09] said we see him on the throne with that
[32:12] book and he's the holder of the book of
[32:15] life right all right
[32:19] now you can pull these up brother Joe
[32:22] would have Scan through him in a hurry
[32:23] but go ahead with number
[32:26] one
[32:28] we'll drop back to this in a minute
[32:32] but holding it to the
[32:36] point around and said who is
[32:40] this who is this and what's going on you
[32:44] know so we see we know it was God
[32:47] sitting on the throne right all right
[32:50] then we see that the book he said he's
[32:52] the
[32:53] absolutely the absolutely original
[32:55] holder of The Book of Life
[32:57] right he holds it God does it when Adam
[32:59] forfeited it went back to its original
[33:01] owner it belongs to him and John is in
[33:04] the vision here in season all right now
[33:08] what kind of a book is
[33:11] it we said it's not something like that
[33:15] we even would cover it as a scroll
[33:18] right the it's the book of life amen
[33:23] right all right The Book of Life
[33:28] all right and then we went through
[33:30] covering these things to be able to see
[33:34] it that this book go ahead to number
[33:38] two and Christ is identified the
[33:42] same he's talking about
[33:45] it that he cannot
[33:47] come until the last
[33:50] one that has the
[33:53] name of the book of life y that was put
[33:57] there before the foundation world but
[34:00] that name is called that's the last one
[34:02] then M he came to redeem to bring back
[34:05] redeem is to bring back and when he
[34:08] brings the life one in he is sitting at
[34:11] the right hand of God tonight doing his
[34:13] mediatorial work now notice this is 64
[34:17] after the seals broke yeah right see
[34:22] he's talking of him sitting on the
[34:23] throne doing his mediator work when the
[34:26] light my soul is saved and that was that
[34:29] was
[34:30] redeemed and seen and knowed by God
[34:34] before the foundational world when that
[34:36] life soul is saved that closes the book
[34:39] right amen M then the lamb comes out
[34:42] takes a book out of the right hand of
[34:44] him that sits upon the
[34:47] throne and then he's coming to Earth
[34:49] he's coming to make it known right all
[34:51] right now we spend a little time
[34:53] emphasizing that this
[34:55] book
[34:58] see that was
[35:00] 1964 right you say well the prophet took
[35:04] the book all this happened in ' 63 why
[35:06] in' 64 is he talking still of
[35:08] mediatorial and why would he be saying
[35:11] don't you say that I say redemption's
[35:13] over don't you say the lamb has left The
[35:16] Mercy Seat amen he said I never said
[35:19] that
[35:20] right all right so if he never said that
[35:23] then he never said that that's the best
[35:26] way of putting it right he didn't say it
[35:29] see we say well now we got this with but
[35:31] he said it right you know so the
[35:33] emphasis whether or not we believe what
[35:36] he
[35:37] said now remember I spent quite a time
[35:40] talking
[35:41] about that the book must be
[35:45] completed that's right before it can be
[35:47] taken right
[35:50] amen all right now until the last name
[35:55] which we're reading here m would come
[35:57] into the book of life and we know it was
[35:59] written before the foundation of the
[36:00] world so we're not worried about it but
[36:02] we're talking about when that name is
[36:04] revealed upon Earth or person comes upon
[36:07] Earth and salvation comes to that person
[36:10] correct amen is what you're talking
[36:12] about because it was written before the
[36:14] foundation of the world all right and
[36:16] being that doing you're going to have to
[36:19] wait until all those names comes in and
[36:22] all are saved then redemption's over
[36:25] right that's correct and that's I kept
[36:27] asking you the question there one day do
[36:29] you believe redemption's
[36:31] over do you believe that in 1963 the
[36:34] lamb left The Mercy Seat as people are
[36:37] teaching and that was the first doctrine
[36:39] that struck me when I came into message
[36:41] in '
[36:42] 67 was that Redemption was over in 63
[36:46] cuz the lamb had left The Mercy Seat
[36:49] well then none of us basically in the
[36:50] building would be saved
[36:52] today right amen so I think we don't
[36:56] believe that amen right am so I think we
[36:59] can just move over from that and let all
[37:02] of this fanaticism fall away and and not
[37:06] worry about it all right amen then we
[37:08] can go on over
[37:11] to go number three first brother Joe
[37:13] before we get I mean
[37:15] Brother Anderson before we had a
[37:17] wonderful time last night yeah we if you
[37:20] want to listen to that brother Joe's got
[37:22] it and he can break it down you know and
[37:24] put it on to a tap we had a jubilee time
[37:28] I thought that was going to be the
[37:29] hardest borest aggravating this uh
[37:33] questions and answers form we was going
[37:35] to ever have go we had it about what is
[37:38] your
[37:40] name and people brought what their name
[37:43] where the meaning of their name right
[37:46] you
[37:46] know and I didn't have to worry about it
[37:49] because see weit just took care of it
[37:51] yeah cuz I said whatever he is I'm two
[37:54] times at
[37:55] it I said so I don't have to tell you
[37:58] what my name is but I enjoyed hearing
[38:01] people talk about their names and things
[38:03] it was really great all right and you
[38:05] say well was it boring to just hear
[38:07] people no it was great it was good but
[38:10] then we got down to the end and I told
[38:12] them in the middle I said now I'm
[38:13] reserving my part until the end so I
[38:16] want you to each one give your name and
[38:18] the meanings
[38:20] Etc and then we went through that we all
[38:23] got a new name right amen we're
[38:25] Christians amen hallelujah
[38:27] we all got to you know we got to going
[38:29] through then the the numerical numbers
[38:32] or what you call it chronological orders
[38:34] or numerical numbers and what your name
[38:37] means and your number you're born under
[38:39] Etc and I told him a little kid you
[38:41] there I
[38:42] said brother random told a brother one
[38:45] time said you was born under like a four
[38:48] and said but your new birth put you
[38:51] under a too and said you're going to
[38:52] fight your nature all of your life right
[38:55] well you know the new bird puts us all
[38:57] under one number right amen and under
[39:00] one name and under
[39:02] one zodiac right right right and it's
[39:06] not just Aries no that's right lamb you
[39:10] know the
[39:11] lamb we're all under that by the new
[39:14] birth right then we have to fight sure
[39:17] your zodiac form controls these things
[39:19] out here your body we're controlled by
[39:21] the I was watching it down there how the
[39:23] tide would go out and come in and you
[39:25] know just watch those things it's
[39:27] beautiful but we really had a great time
[39:29] when we finished so if you'd like to
[39:31] listen to it might encourage you to come
[39:33] amen all right but number
[39:35] three what kind of a book is
[39:38] this to begin with there is no basis for
[39:40] the claimers in Sardinian Church age
[39:43] 267 and I gave you these quotes So if
[39:46] you want to read them off of that or
[39:47] read them up
[39:49] here CLS that the L book of life is not
[39:52] the same as the Book of
[39:54] Life The Book of Life might be called
[39:57] the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's Book
[39:58] of Life and even thy book or book of the
[40:02] living only names are written in it
[40:06] Revelation 13:8 all that dwell upon the
[40:08] Earth shall worship Him the Beast whose
[40:10] names are not written in the L in the
[40:12] book of the lamb slain from the
[40:14] foundation of the world all right
[40:17] now if you look on the back of your last
[40:21] notes that was
[40:22] given you will see drop back now brother
[40:25] to to to
[40:28] a and just
[40:31] remember this is only a book of
[40:34] names the one in the hand of the one on
[40:36] the throne if you look back and flop on
[40:38] the back of it you'll find this
[40:41] quotation there are only names written
[40:44] in the Lamb's Book of
[40:46] Life there's not anything about your
[40:48] life right there's not anything in the
[40:52] Lamb's Book of Life the one that that go
[40:56] God had in his hand back there that went
[40:58] back from Adam was a book of names right
[41:01] amen all right and there was no records
[41:05] CU we hadn't come down and made a record
[41:07] yet that's right that's right all right
[41:10] it wasn't the records made amen it was a
[41:12] book of names right but then when it
[41:15] come to Earth you begin what would be
[41:18] known as writing of the
[41:20] Bible and it would bring it down to
[41:22] listen to what he's saying this is works
[41:25] of Faith Express paragraph
[41:27] 119 just like last night speaking when
[41:30] you get the book you're going to be
[41:33] maybe a little confused he talking about
[41:34] the church age book listen but one of
[41:38] them is your natural birth is what I
[41:41] said the two books of life it's the same
[41:44] book but one of them is your natural
[41:46] birth the other one is your spiritual
[41:47] birth one leads out to the other one all
[41:51] right now you got a couple of quotes up
[41:54] above there that will will go with that
[41:57] and you're reading off your
[41:59] notes that the Bible is two
[42:05] books it's the book of life
[42:09] right but it's divided into two books
[42:13] part of the Bible is the record of your
[42:15] natural life right right and the living
[42:18] on the earth and records and things are
[42:20] kept genealogies and things right but
[42:24] the other part of that is the re of
[42:26] Jesus
[42:27] Christ right
[42:30] amen which is where your name is written
[42:32] in the lounge book of life
[42:34] amen all
[42:35] right see then now we can read both of
[42:38] the parts of the book or sections or
[42:41] whatever you want to call it right
[42:44] amen we can read it here we can read
[42:47] about a Peter and a Paul and a James and
[42:49] a John and you
[42:51] know 4 and Luke 1730s and all of that
[42:58] and then now we've gotten to the point I
[43:00] hope by the study of the Book of
[43:01] Revelation we can see that our names are
[43:04] WR right that's right and it's not his
[43:06] brother Bram said it's not our manev
[43:09] it's what's going on while he's alive so
[43:12] that puts his name in the book all right
[43:15] so then we have the right setting the
[43:18] book that was there is not
[43:21] a it's not a Bible yeah right but where
[43:24] R will call it the Bible
[43:26] sure there not two two books but yet he
[43:30] say there's two books or two parts of
[43:33] the same book
[43:35] right one of them is your Eternal
[43:38] section the other one is your natural
[43:40] life amen all right one leads out to the
[43:43] other one right yes right but see then
[43:46] we must come to
[43:48] Earth
[43:50] Yep and there would have to be a book
[43:54] started about our lives
[43:56] amen you know so we start in Genesis and
[43:59] come down through and you know come down
[44:02] to our day and
[44:03] time and uh when it would then it would
[44:08] be a
[44:10] book but before the lamb can take the
[44:15] book I want to keep rolling that in your
[44:17] mind the book has got to be completed
[44:20] right amen because now here's what
[44:23] everybody argues about
[44:26] you know it's been an argument in the
[44:28] message ever since I've been in it that
[44:30] the seals are the seventh seals broke
[44:33] other side say s still ain't broke Y and
[44:37] some says well it's partially
[44:39] broke you know so they trying to get an
[44:42] in between I guess
[44:45] right but they never talk about how the
[44:48] book got sealed
[44:54] right this is a seal book sure brother
[44:58] randam even
[45:00] said we didn't know that
[45:04] no do you need that quote he said we
[45:08] didn't know
[45:10] that we didn't know it was a sealed
[45:13] book but we always been able well you
[45:16] mean sealed up well I've been able to
[45:18] read all my
[45:19] life ain't nothing sealed around my
[45:21] Bible bless God the Lord Jesus came into
[45:25] my heart
[45:26] and open the
[45:29] book brother said when the seals come
[45:32] off the book it become a brand new
[45:37] book does it come off to you right yes
[45:41] well yes I see this I see that and I see
[45:44] it's okay for me to have four or five
[45:48] wives that's what a lot of them
[45:52] say that don't fit the old book no
[45:56] that's right right right right truly
[45:59] don't come in the new
[46:01] book the new book can't be something
[46:03] different from the
[46:04] old all right it's just more revealed
[46:08] all right but how did the book get
[46:11] sealed we went through a message back
[46:13] there talking about how that when the
[46:15] children of Israel was going into
[46:17] captivity they would take the um
[46:20] property Deeds Etc what we would call
[46:23] now the the the tracks of land that they
[46:25] had added the descriptions and they put
[46:27] it in an Earthly vessel bury it in the
[46:29] ground that's in Jeremiah
[46:32] then and see then bringing it over until
[46:35] those all it was supposed to be was
[46:38] still in Jesus Christ amen right
[46:43] right but people don't even talk about a
[46:45] sealed book they don't like that right
[46:48] even the ones that says it sealed they
[46:50] say it's open to a degree or they say
[46:53] it's open six seals it open yeah uh but
[46:56] the seventh is not
[46:58] open you know they've been arguing that
[47:01] ever since they've been in the message
[47:03] right but you don't hear anybody talking
[47:05] about how the book got
[47:09] sealed the
[47:11] book I hope you caught it in a message
[47:14] or two
[47:15] back when I preached over and
[47:19] over that the book has got to be
[47:21] complete before it can be sealed
[47:24] right you don't seal a partially partial
[47:29] book so whenever
[47:34] name that would ever be in the book of
[47:37] life you know the Lamb's Book of Life
[47:38] for the foundation of the world when
[47:40] it's manifest on
[47:42] Earth and comes into the Plan of
[47:47] Redemption and if there's one
[47:50] today that's not in that Plan of
[47:52] Redemption the book is not sealed right
[47:55] M
[48:00] right come on
[48:03] M it's not sealed until the last name is
[48:07] brought in the
[48:09] book it's sealed then
[48:16] yes see when you get the new
[48:19] birth you're sealed in amen the body of
[48:23] Christ amen that's right you agree right
[48:26] amen but as we were talking about last
[48:28] night a little bit about it but I'm we
[48:30] going to have the next one on like
[48:31] justification and things but if you're
[48:34] not born again you're not sealed in the
[48:36] body of Christ that's
[48:40] right and folks that's our problem we're
[48:43] still an open book right until the new
[48:47] birth comes right
[48:49] amen that's our trouble that's why we
[48:52] live on both sides of the pages right
[48:55] amen you you know what I'm saying right
[48:57] that's
[48:58] right but when the book is
[49:03] sealed and only then can the lamb take
[49:05] the book that's
[49:10] right he said but but brother Dale the
[49:13] the lamb took the book 2,000 years
[49:19] ago Redemption was over 2,000 years
[49:23] ago now where you at
[49:28] well no the lamb took a book 63 well
[49:31] then Redemption was over in
[49:34] 63 and that would leave us out
[49:39] right I'm not
[49:41] hateful it's just time to rub out a
[49:44] little make belief that's or unbelief
[49:47] that's in us that we think we know right
[49:51] thereby we don't have to listen to
[49:54] nobody because we know am that's
[50:00] right I asked a brother when he was
[50:02] fixing to leave here I said would you do
[50:03] me a favor and
[50:05] yourself I said I'm going to preach
[50:07] something this
[50:09] afternoon that you don't
[50:12] know was it
[50:14] upsetting he said you don't think I know
[50:16] it I said I know you don't no problem
[50:18] sure would you please stay this
[50:20] afternoon and
[50:22] listen I ask you to please come back
[50:26] this
[50:28] afternoon of course some of you won't so
[50:33] thereby you'll be showing you don't care
[50:35] yeah that's
[50:36] right okay forget all of
[50:40] that time to rub out unbelief amen
[50:43] that's right all right go ahead
[50:46] now so the prophets are the one that
[50:48] said it I didn't go to number four
[50:51] Brother
[50:52] Anderson I went number three I guess
[50:55] went that that one but you know only n
[50:57] are in the book now number four what the
[50:58] prophet
[51:02] say this is taken from the fourth seal
[51:05] 63
[51:06] 321 now we have noticed now that the
[51:09] breaking of the
[51:11] seal it's the sealed book of redemption
[51:15] right and then the book is rolled up
[51:17] like a scroll just like the old was was
[51:19] a book it wasn't a book of this type you
[51:22] know and all like that that's doing it
[51:24] but it's a seven sealed book of
[51:26] redemption
[51:29] right now this
[51:32] book you see yeah but we've been able to
[51:35] read all of these we we can read about
[51:37] these things Brother
[51:39] D yeah come
[51:44] on the prophet of God in the seal
[51:48] book after he preached six
[51:51] seals he said if God doesn't come
[51:54] paraphrasing it now
[51:56] now and open this seven seal he said
[51:59] we're only presuming right
[52:02] amen you need that
[52:08] quote so now think about it the book is
[52:12] sealed it's a sealed book go to number
[52:19] five this is the
[52:21] breach paragraph
[52:24] 68
[52:27] do these things that please
[52:30] God where the book is sealed
[52:33] now and you are sealed amen the holy
[52:37] spirit is the seal y amen P the next
[52:42] one number six taken from the breach
[52:46] paragraph 75 now notice this book is
[52:48] sealed and you are sealed with the book
[52:53] mhm until the day
[52:56] of redemption
[52:59] am right you're seal with the
[53:05] book so then it's a simple matter of
[53:07] realizing that the book was
[53:10] sealed we were allowed to read certain
[53:13] things and the apostles were and the
[53:15] great faith of the fathers was there and
[53:18] they lived it and manifested
[53:20] it but yet a great man that is in the
[53:23] faith of the fathers by the name
[53:27] Paul he
[53:29] said without this end time people
[53:34] yep I'm I paraphrasing it we're not
[53:37] going to be made perfect right
[53:40] amen without us you canot be made
[53:42] perfect that's right he went into the
[53:45] ground and now he's depending on us amen
[53:47] that's
[53:52] right why not wait until Redemption
[53:55] over to try to understand a lot of
[54:04] things but you're sealed with the
[54:08] book and remember the emphasis I kept
[54:11] making that you can't take the
[54:13] book until it's fully right done it's
[54:17] got to be written
[54:20] right then you can take the book that's
[54:23] right and reveal the seal that's right
[54:27] well I don't understand when in the
[54:28] world you're saying it's right cuz you
[54:30] don't have a background and I'm
[54:32] sorry 40 years I've tried
[54:37] yes but you that connecting on and
[54:39] you're hearing these you're hearing
[54:40] things said that you say what in the
[54:42] world is a man talking
[54:44] about but for 40 years standing here
[54:53] declaring that the seals is not to the
[54:55] Bride of Jesus
[54:59] Christ the physical things of them the
[55:02] revelation of the seals is to the bride
[55:05] the seals are to
[55:10] Israel you see
[55:13] that's takes a lot of
[55:17] thinking but you see folks I've tried my
[55:19] best to express it to
[55:22] you look at number seven
[55:26] what are we and what are we
[55:30] doing Christ M God

[55:35] 5:24 now you see the
[55:37] seals and this is after the seals are
[55:42] broke now you see the seals when he was
[55:45] in his mediatorial work back there
[55:47] redeeming but someday he comes forth to
[55:49] get this book that he's
[55:52] redeemed and all that's in this book
[55:55] book would be
[55:59] him and all that's in
[56:03] that excuse me all that's in the book
[56:05] would be him for that's the
[56:10] believer the words in the
[56:13] book and the word is
[56:17] him and all that's in that he come forth
[56:20] to this for this book of redemption
[56:23] whose names are written on the book for
[56:25] the foundation world when it was slain
[56:27] as a lamb

[57:05] Book of Life is the names of those who
[57:08] are to be
[57:10] redeemed that was what was in the hand

[58:20] writing a book about you and I right

[58:50] see you got to wait until all the names
[58:53] are in before you can take the book amen
[58:55] right you'd be taking the book premature
[58:57] right
[59:00] amen see then there's no way in the
[59:02] world you to understand how that we are
[59:04] the actual word amen right you and I are
[59:08] the actual word amen we are the as Paul
[59:11] called written epistle read and known of
[59:14] all man right and those two witnesses
[59:17] will stand there and point back over
[59:20] here to where we are amen and they you
[59:24] know doing to where we were let me get
[59:27] it where nobody won't misunderstand the
[59:29] word going back to where we were and
[59:31] they'll say see you missed your
[59:33] salvation right amen but those Gentiles
[59:36] receive that salvation right amen and
[59:39] they've gone in a Rapture right that's
[59:41] right and you'll never have sunship
[59:43] you'll be servants
[59:49] right see the father sitting on the
[59:52] throne because it's the father strong
[59:55] amen right oh that's simple language is
[59:58] it right amen the Father Strong is where
[1:00:01] the father sitting right all right but
[1:00:04] in his imorph his form that is shown in
[1:00:07] the
[1:00:08] book he
[1:00:10] shown as a
[1:00:14] lamb I gave you a couple of them and
[1:00:16] it's in the back of your your notes
[1:00:19] where the prophet of God said he climbed
[1:00:22] up on the throne he took the book
[1:00:25] climbed up on the throne and sat
[1:00:29] down just because he took he can't take
[1:00:31] the book until the light's name appears
[1:00:34] right but then when he does he climbs up
[1:00:36] on the throne and sits down the prophet
[1:00:40] said it's an amorphus of God right right
[1:00:44] yes the forms of God being made known
[1:00:47] amen
[1:00:48] right all
[1:00:50] right and doing that
[1:00:53] then
[1:00:55] who's sitting on the
[1:01:01] throne according to acts
[1:01:04] 7 I think it's 69 I wrote These didn't
[1:01:08] read it Steven looked up and he saw
[1:01:12] Jesus standing on the right hand of
[1:01:16] God all by Revelation in Hebrews speaks
[1:01:20] of how that when he ascended he went to
[1:01:23] the right hand right mhm the power and
[1:01:26] the authority not the right hand right
[1:01:29] right join then on
[1:01:33] patmas sees in Revelations
[1:01:36] 51 him sitting on the throne right with
[1:01:41] the book in his
[1:01:44] hand getting prepared for the
[1:01:47] opening all
[1:01:51] right well then when you get to it
[1:01:59] you see the elders and all as they
[1:02:01] gather around and chapter 5
[1:02:04] and things are taking
[1:02:07] place and when you do see those things
[1:02:09] you remember that the proclamation went
[1:02:15] out and the Elder said the line of the
[1:02:18] tribe of Judah right has
[1:02:21] prevailed to take the book in other
[1:02:23] words in Lo the
[1:02:26] seals John was looking for that line
[1:02:29] because he knew who that was right he
[1:02:32] knew what tribe Jesus came from which
[1:02:35] was the line of the tribe of
[1:02:37] Judah the Bible saying that a lawgiver
[1:02:40] would come from Judah remember Judah was
[1:02:41] not mentioned in the bible as to come
[1:02:44] like a
[1:02:45] Levites it looked like that Jesus would
[1:02:48] have come from the tribe of Levi don't
[1:02:49] it
[1:02:50] yeah cuz that would have been the
[1:02:53] priesthood but in instead of that he
[1:02:55] came from the line of the tribe of
[1:02:58] Judah and as he did John knew that right
[1:03:02] so he's turning to
[1:03:04] look and when he
[1:03:06] does he sees a lamb amen
[1:03:11] yes now if that's all he would have seen
[1:03:14] John would have been all right because
[1:03:17] he could have said
[1:03:19] look I remember when he was
[1:03:22] introduced on the River Jordan not as
[1:03:26] the line of the tribe of
[1:03:30] Judah but as the Lamb of God that would
[1:03:34] take away the sin of the world that's
[1:03:37] right he says everything's
[1:03:41] okay but he looks and he sees him yeah
[1:03:44] the funny looking lamb cuz he got seven
[1:03:46] horns and seven eyes
[1:03:53] right
[1:03:55] so he needs
[1:03:56] help to be able to
[1:04:01] understand all
[1:04:03] right the lamb then can come
[1:04:07] forth The Lion and the lamb is the same
[1:04:11] God but different forms Mor right
[1:04:17] amen he will not be the line until
[1:04:20] Redemption is over right amen but when
[1:04:24] it is over he will become the lamb
[1:04:29] right he will remain as the lamb to
[1:04:33] Israel after redemption's over for us
[1:04:36] right but to us he becomes the line I
[1:04:39] don't want to get that
[1:04:41] far he becomes our husband right
[1:04:45] amen all right the
[1:04:48] line but where did that lamb come from
[1:04:52] is what was bothering John yeah
[1:04:55] for
[1:04:56] surely if he had seven horns and seven
[1:04:59] eyes it would in symbolics as he was
[1:05:01] being there and understanding those
[1:05:03] things he would know surely that that
[1:05:06] would have some
[1:05:08] connection right to where this lamb
[1:05:11] would have
[1:05:12] been and what he had been
[1:05:17] doing now remember it doesn't describe
[1:05:21] of Paul or Steven when they saw Jesus
[1:05:24] standing at the right hand
[1:05:29] right it doesn't describe
[1:05:32] him as a lamb right
[1:05:36] right they describe him as a person
[1:05:39] right yeah that's right come on Sten saw
[1:05:46] him Paul spoke of him
[1:05:50] right but here John
[1:05:53] he
[1:05:55] he wonders about this
[1:06:01] lamb and when he does he says where did
[1:06:03] this lamb come from cuz I remember what
[1:06:07] happened I remember he was introduced to
[1:06:09] the
[1:06:12] lamb and I remember what took
[1:06:16] place what was this that took
[1:06:19] place that made this come to the to the
[1:06:21] right position going number eight now on
[1:06:26] the mighty conqueror
[1:06:33] 1958 I go about Welcome Home the angels
[1:06:36] and the Bly gates open up and Jesus
[1:06:39] right down through the streets of Glory
[1:06:41] with the Old Testament Saints behind him
[1:06:44] seeing where was this at his
[1:06:47] resurrection right right and ascension
[1:06:50] all hell the fire of Jesus name and he
[1:06:53] come up in the fr front of the father's
[1:06:55] strong and said father here they are
[1:06:58] they were Faithful over a few
[1:07:02] things he said get up here
[1:07:04] son and sit on the right hand until I
[1:07:07] make all thy folds thy foot stool there
[1:07:10] he stands
[1:07:14] tonight
[1:07:18] okay but there still no l
[1:07:22] right
[1:07:24] there's still no land with seven horns
[1:07:26] and seven eyes
[1:07:28] right but when he sees him in Revelation
[1:07:30] he sees him as that where did he come
[1:07:33] from go ahead number nine I said most of
[1:07:37] these you've had over and over and over
[1:07:40] you ought to be able to quote them
[1:07:42] without this is Tak them to the
[1:07:45] breach now where it came forth where did
[1:07:48] it come from it come from the Father
[1:07:51] Strong they talking about the lamb the
[1:07:53] whatever John mentioned in Heavens
[1:07:55] looking where he had been seated since
[1:07:58] he had been slain and raised up he
[1:08:01] raised up and set on the right hand of
[1:08:02] God ever making ever living to make
[1:08:04] intercessions amen raised the Earth
[1:08:07] today as an intercessor with his own
[1:08:09] blood to make intercession upon the
[1:08:10] ignorance of the people now and that's
[1:08:13] the one I'm depending on he still there
[1:08:15] covered with bleach the bleach of the
[1:08:18] forgiveness of sin all right where's
[1:08:21] they at Father Strong right
[1:08:26] go to the next
[1:08:27] one so if this lamb come from anywhere
[1:08:30] he come from the father is
[1:08:33] strong from the breach paragraph 199
[1:08:37] Notice come from the Father Strong oh
[1:08:39] think where did he advance from to this
[1:08:42] Vision he come from Glory where he's
[1:08:44] seated at the right hand of God he
[1:08:46] Advanced forth to John out of Glory the
[1:08:50] lamb coming forth look at the next
[1:08:59] now he ties Zechariah
[1:09:02] 4 and Zechariah 4 is tying together
[1:09:06] about zerubabel and the Seven eyes of
[1:09:08] the Lord now watch brother Brown the
[1:09:11] seven
[1:09:13] eyes this is the breach paragraph
[1:09:16] 236 eyes means seeing seeing means
[1:09:19] Prophet seers this lamb had seven horns
[1:09:22] and on each horn had an eye
[1:09:25] seven eyes what is
[1:09:31] it Christ and his
[1:09:34] bride seven Church ages out of there
[1:09:37] with seven prophets that went forth
[1:09:39] seven Sears eyes so the last one must be
[1:09:43] a
[1:09:44] sear what is it Christ and his bride
[1:09:48] right amen you realize then folks that
[1:09:51] what I preached for years to you of one
[1:09:55] thing you can talk about the birth of
[1:09:58] the word that's
[1:10:01] wonderful you can talk about being
[1:10:03] pregnated with the word and that's
[1:10:06] great we need that yes but when are you
[1:10:10] going to ever get down to talking like
[1:10:12] Masterpiece and she's not out the shook

[1:10:16] emphatically States He said Mary was not
[1:10:19] the seed
[1:10:21] amen he said she was a carrier
[1:10:26] he said because he was deceived amen see
[1:10:30] Mary gave birth to the seed Zeus zeusa
[1:10:33] Street Pentecost gave birth to the word
[1:10:37] right Christ Is that real
[1:10:40] word you and I are going to have to be
[1:10:42] the
[1:10:44] word not just talk about a birth that's
[1:10:49] right where's the lamb going to come
[1:10:51] from to be able to take the book right
[1:10:54] amen I didn't say it's your Prophet said
[1:10:57] that's the bride yes
[1:11:01] M but Brother D you saying we going to
[1:11:03] be the one that takes the book now I
[1:11:05] didn't tell that and ain't never talked
[1:11:07] that right right amen if you thought I
[1:11:10] did you missed it that's right the lamb
[1:11:13] is the one that will take the book but
[1:11:15] the lamb must be produced by the Bride
[1:11:17] of Jesus
[1:11:22] Christ
[1:11:25] and to do that she must become the word
[1:11:29] amen the bride must not only give birth
[1:11:32] to the
[1:11:34] word but must be able to bring forth a
[1:11:38] fully matured lamb right
[1:11:40] amen statue of perfect man right
[1:11:44] whatever you want to talk

[1:11:48] him totally restored that's
[1:11:51] right back to seeing him sitting on the
[1:11:54] throne with a book in his hand and in
[1:11:57] doing that seeing that he paid the price
[1:12:01] the way he got to that Throne we read

[1:12:47] eyes amen you can't separate him and her
[1:12:52] right

[1:13:16] right see is our responsibility to give
[1:13:19] birth to the lamb right and bring it
[1:13:21] into maturity right can not be the lamb

[1:14:28] said the biggest portion of people of
[1:14:29] this message will die and go by the
[1:14:31] grave I've said that probably
[1:14:35] 5,432 times ever since then and maybe a
[1:14:39] few

[1:16:40] Jesus Christ but he was not the full
[1:16:42] bride when he went up right he only Ted
[1:16:45] that's
[1:16:46] right brother around said what you see
[1:16:49] now one day you will see it in its
[1:16:52] fullness

[1:16:58] amen you mean the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:01] is going to have the same Ministry that
[1:17:02] brother randam had amen the Bride of
[1:17:05] Jesus Christ around the world not no one
[1:17:08] person no more not no Lula
[1:17:11] Georgia but around the world that's
[1:17:14] right the Bride of Jesus Christ will
[1:17:16] have the same Ministry that brother rown

[1:17:20] Lord Jesus Christ had brother R said if
[1:17:22] not then won't welcome back that's
[1:17:25] right come
[1:17:27] on he can't come to it if it's not his
[1:17:30] same ministry right come on Church
[1:17:33] listen so what did he say you know we
[1:17:35] just kind of pass it off all God was he
[1:17:37] put in Christ all Christ in the
[1:17:41] church we just kind of passed that off
[1:17:43] as a good
[1:17:46] quote do we really believe it right
[1:17:49] adoption 1965 22 185 well then all that
[1:17:53] God was he poured into
[1:17:56] Jesus for he was the fullness of the
[1:17:58] godhead bodily is that
[1:18:02] right is it right he was God that's
[1:18:05] right all right is that right and all
[1:18:09] that Jesus was he poured into the
[1:18:11] church these things that I do shall you
[1:18:14] do all things of even greater than this
[1:18:17] shall you do where I go to the
[1:18:21] Father which is his body the fullness of
[1:18:24] him that fth all in all go ahead to the
[1:18:29] next this is Page paragraph 159 Christ
[1:18:33] of Myster God
[1:18:35] revealed preach 1963
[1:18:39] 7208 God expressed in Jesus who was both
[1:18:42] Father Son and Holy Ghost right the
[1:18:44] fullness of the godhead bodily now the
[1:18:46] complete fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:18:48] dwells in his
[1:18:51] church the preeminence all that God was
[1:18:54] he poured into Christ all that Christ
[1:18:55] was he poured into the church the
[1:18:57] Believers right a big man in this
[1:19:00] message he said you you say that you we
[1:19:03] that and he said you
[1:19:08] okay he brother rather said it sure you
[1:19:11] going get mad at me I found
[1:19:14] it you you would get upset with me cuz I
[1:19:17] found what the prophet said get upset
[1:19:20] with the prophet cuz he said
[1:19:21] it
[1:19:23] come on get the next
[1:19:26] one page 14 or paragraph excuse me
[1:19:29] number 14 paragra 130 the Mighty God
[1:19:32] unable then it was God in them days it
[1:19:34] was God in a man his son Jesus Christ we
[1:19:37] believe that amen now if you don't
[1:19:40] believe the rest of it you don't believe
[1:19:42] that that's right can I stop and say
[1:19:45] that you don't believe that if you don't
[1:19:47] believe the rest of
[1:19:50] it not just a prophet not just an
[1:19:52] ordinary man ordinary human it was God
[1:19:55] in Christ God in a man the fullness of
[1:19:57] the godhead bodily in a man God in in a
[1:20:00] man now it's God in men the fullness of
[1:20:04] the godhead bodily in his entire church
[1:20:07] manifesting himself fulfilling his
[1:20:10] word now do you believe that
[1:20:15] amen what about the light I think it
[1:20:19] is maybe one
[1:20:21] more
[1:20:25] progress 17 of lean not to to th own
[1:20:29] understanding so you see if you were in
[1:20:32] the full knowledge of God then you are
[1:20:36] becoming a part of God right and the
[1:20:39] only way you can be a Son of God or a
[1:20:41] daughter of God you had to be a part of
[1:20:44] God that's talk about your new birth
[1:20:47] right right and God isn't complete
[1:20:50] without you amen that's right
[1:20:53] come on that'll make you feel good has
[1:20:56] to be that's right because there's there
[1:20:59] is one only one resource of eternal life
[1:21:01] and that is God and him alone has
[1:21:03] eternal life now and you were part of
[1:21:06] him in so much that you are an attribute
[1:21:09] are in his thinking in the
[1:21:12] beginning and that because he thought of
[1:21:14] you in the beginning it gives that
[1:21:16] little tug towards him that's what has
[1:21:19] to be quickened some of them will never
[1:21:20] be quickened they just don't have that's
[1:21:23] wrong God is not
[1:21:27] complete right amen without
[1:21:32] you but here's the key let's is the last
[1:21:36] one God's only provided place of worship
[1:21:39] 1965
[1:21:40] 11:28 paragraph 264 no leav among
[1:21:46] you that brings the entire fullness of
[1:21:50] the godhead
[1:21:51] bodily
[1:21:54] y Le is our own ideas and
[1:21:59] thoughts
[1:22:00] right so when we get rid of all of
[1:22:04] that the fullness will be
[1:22:07] here said he couldn't do it the days
[1:22:11] couldn't do it in Luther's age no
[1:22:13] couldn't do it in W's age couldn't do it
[1:22:14] in Pentecostal age no but the day when
[1:22:17] the son of man will be manifested
[1:22:18] revealed brought back the church
[1:22:20] together with the entire deity of God
[1:22:23] amongst his people am everybody else
[1:22:27] said in brother showing the same visible
[1:22:30] signs manifesting himself like he did at
[1:22:33] the beginning when he was manifested on
[1:22:35] Earth in the form of a prophet God Oh
[1:22:38] Glory promised by Malachi 4 promised by
[1:22:40] the rest of the
[1:22:41] scripture where you worship at in the
[1:22:43] house of God SE present tent
[1:22:46] right you see what he's talking about
[1:22:49] yes yes but brother Dale we we don't see
[1:22:53] the things that was going on with the
[1:23:02] prophet what about it mhm
[1:23:07] right when Tyler got stung the other
[1:23:11] day he was in bad
[1:23:14] shape
[1:23:17] right he was itching all over and
[1:23:21] everything
[1:23:23] I just simply waited not because of no
[1:23:26] thing of Donnie and Bill not being in
[1:23:28] but I waited till I caught him in the
[1:23:30] bathroom coming out and tler we need to
[1:23:34] pray reached down and took his
[1:23:38] hands I'd say his temperature at that
[1:23:41] time was drastically over 103
[1:23:44] or4 he was burning hot burning hot and I
[1:23:48] could feel it we
[1:23:51] prayed and then and little bumps was
[1:23:54] coming up all along like where his blood
[1:23:56] was running especially all through here
[1:23:58] and night this little wels was coming up
[1:24:00] all over him and we
[1:24:03] prayed Paul found out and got Bill knew
[1:24:06] where the doctor was we went over Tyler
[1:24:09] sitting there he said brother Donnie had
[1:24:11] to go back and get some paperwork and
[1:24:13] some stuff from you know his billfold
[1:24:17] Etc Tyler he said brother Dale said call
[1:24:21] will just call Papa will just walk down
[1:24:23] here to Publix and get some you know
[1:24:26] some Dramamine or I mean know what been
[1:24:29] benad and said called I'm doing fine I
[1:24:32] said no no let's don't do
[1:24:36] it I believed he was
[1:24:39] healed but I said let's don't do it
[1:24:42] let's let us the doctor well we have a
[1:24:45] lot of fun about the doctor giving in
[1:24:47] shots and things you
[1:24:51] know
[1:24:52] but you see church I believe that God is
[1:24:54] still
[1:24:57] alive he's waiting on the Bride of Jesus
[1:25:00] to realize who she is the prophet said
[1:25:03] what you're here
[1:25:06] for if we're the fullness of the godhead
[1:25:10] bodily you say well I just can't see
[1:25:12] that well then you're blinded right come
[1:25:14] on you're blinded amen blind language
[1:25:17] you're
[1:25:19] blind the prophet said it you know
[1:25:22] there's a favorite quote of that
[1:25:24] right Prophet said it and I believe it
[1:25:27] and that's
[1:25:28] it that's a favorite quote I like it
[1:25:31] this way the prophet said it and I
[1:25:33] believe it and I've seen it made
[1:25:36] manifest cuz I've seen a living God in
[1:25:39] the reality of a
[1:25:43] people but to make sure you understand
[1:25:47] there is no book to go to Israel
[1:25:51] no
[1:25:52] tell me where it's coming from that's
[1:25:55] right right amen yes
[1:25:57] sir where's the book it's going to
[1:26:01] Israel I want
[1:26:03] scripture I know where I'm standing I
[1:26:05] know
[1:26:09] scripture where's the book that's going
[1:26:11] to
[1:26:15] Israel if it's not the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:18] Christ show me some verse paragraph Etc
[1:26:21] whatever
[1:26:23] right and we're not going over there
[1:26:26] like a man told me he said oh them two
[1:26:28] prophets this is years ago he said them
[1:26:30] two prophets said that'll be a gentile
[1:26:33] bride and a gentile prophet of
[1:26:37] course yeah we knew that he was saying
[1:26:40] he was the Gentile
[1:26:45] prophet and I told him I said brother
[1:26:48] randam said it would be two Jews because
[1:26:50] the the Jews wouldn't have a gentile
[1:26:53] that's right now don't go play games
[1:26:56] with
[1:26:57] me
[1:26:59] Elijah in his natural First Estate was a
[1:27:08] gentile in brother brandom it would have
[1:27:10] been a
[1:27:11] gentile but when he goes to Israel your
[1:27:14] Prophet said they won't accept nothing
[1:27:16] but a
[1:27:18] Jew right so that Elijah is going to be
[1:27:21] a Jew
[1:27:23] amen of course the brother didn't like
[1:27:26] it but I was just telling him what I
[1:27:30] believe just like I try to tell you what
[1:27:32] I
[1:27:33] believe I believe you and I have got to
[1:27:35] be the Living Word right amen right not
[1:27:38] just talk about it that's right but be
[1:27:41] the Living Word that's right could God
[1:27:44] take your Revelation and go to through
[1:27:47] with
[1:27:48] it God that's
[1:27:51] right you see why brother Ram couldn't
[1:27:53] go
[1:27:55] right come on he was on a plane the
[1:27:59] video they got of him they were setting
[1:28:01] up for him to go to Israel said brother
[1:28:03] Brandon with your
[1:28:05] ministry them Jews will accept Jesus
[1:28:08] Christ he was on the plane going there
[1:28:12] landed in what CYO or
[1:28:16] something and the Lord said come on
[1:28:18] behind the hanger I need to talk to you
[1:28:20] right he said iniquity of the is not
[1:28:22] full yet and said you can't
[1:28:24] go but he said I always
[1:28:27] thought I'd have something to do with
[1:28:31] Israel coming to
[1:28:33] Christ and you know he
[1:28:35] will yes sir CU it'll be his message
[1:28:40] that will go to Israel that's right sir
[1:28:43] and we're supposed to be that
[1:28:46] message that man said you don't think
[1:28:48] it'd be a gentile prophet and a gentile
[1:28:50] bride no sir
[1:28:53] you believe
[1:28:55] it I wouldn't have CED if he said we'll
[1:28:58] make you the prophet and we'll just get
[1:28:59] you a gentile bride I have said it won't
[1:29:04] work I got to be a Jew
[1:29:07] amen that's
[1:29:10] right because they won't accept nothing
[1:29:12] else that's
[1:29:14] right see
[1:29:18] church we got to be that
[1:29:20] book not just talk about it not just
[1:29:24] read it but we've got to
[1:29:27] become that
[1:29:31] book and then there'll be a book that's
[1:29:34] right to go to
[1:29:39] Israel brother random made a hor said
[1:29:42] I'd have made a horrible mistake y first
[1:29:45] seal if God hadn't to come and
[1:29:47] straighten me out of that's right what
[1:29:51] do you think would would have happened
[1:29:52] now this is this evening's
[1:29:55] message but what do you think would have
[1:29:57] happened in chapter 5 when they asked
[1:30:00] brother randam that question and they
[1:30:02] said is this the saints of God and he
[1:30:06] said
[1:30:11] no this is not the
[1:30:15] redeemed I'm reading
[1:30:20] him he started on and he stopped and he
[1:30:23] said something's
[1:30:25] wrong brother Ned Allison from my
[1:30:27] understanding was one that told him said
[1:30:29] read your question and your scripture
[1:30:35] over he read it over and he said that's
[1:30:39] wrong y he said see that's the
[1:30:42] bride now why would he why would he say
[1:30:47] to start with that was not to
[1:30:50] Bri
[1:30:58] y why would he say it was not the bride
[1:31:02] y he's a prophet you got to have a
[1:31:05] reason
[1:31:07] is because of what he had taught
[1:31:11] yep was he standing on it
[1:31:19] y be church it's time to wake up
[1:31:24] and start believe
[1:31:29] it if that wasn't the
[1:31:32] Bride of what he thought now he thought
[1:31:35] it wasn't the bride because he said it
[1:31:36] he said this is not the bride this not
[1:31:37] the Saints he said this is not the
[1:31:39] redeemed right then who was he thinking
[1:31:42] it
[1:31:45] was
[1:31:47] M hold
[1:31:50] that
[1:31:52] and that would have messed the Bible up
[1:31:55] entirely right yes
[1:32:00] sir now one more
[1:32:06] statement he said if we don't get this
[1:32:09] Daniel 70 weeks straight
[1:32:13] y he
[1:32:15] said we can't exactly Place The Book of
[1:32:19] Revelation right that's
[1:32:31] righty stand come
[1:32:37] on you got to have it prepared that's
[1:32:41] right he said we've got to get it
[1:32:48] prepared he said then if we get it pred
[1:32:52] we can depend on God to come and open it
[1:32:55] that's right
[1:33:01] sir cuz you know what he would have been
[1:33:03] to
[1:33:06] it he was saying that Israel that's
[1:33:09] right he be trying to show Israel to
[1:33:12] Israel y right won't work work if he
[1:33:17] showed Israel to Israel it would have
[1:33:18] made him sunship y right right
[1:33:24] if he showed Israel to Israel it would
[1:33:26] made him sunship CU he's not trying to
[1:33:28] show Israel to me and you he's trying to
[1:33:31] show us to
[1:33:34] ourselves that we can be the sons and
[1:33:38] daughters he would have made Israel back
