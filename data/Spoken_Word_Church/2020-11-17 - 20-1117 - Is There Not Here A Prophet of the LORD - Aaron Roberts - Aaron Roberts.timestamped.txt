[2:00] wednesday i kept thinking
[2:02] and then it's like you know what it's
[2:04] with tuesday
[2:06] i was hoping the work would be shorter
[2:08] you know
[2:09] no next week it's shorter but not this
[2:12] week
[2:14] because i keep thinking well you know i

[2:16] days so
[2:18] good to be in the house the lord tonight
[2:21] appreciate the lord and all of his
[2:22] blessings and amen
[2:24] amen good to see each one of you so um
[2:29] tonight we will look into uh first kings
[2:32] chapter 22. and
[2:40] y'all just pray for me tonight and
[2:44] kind of it's kind of something i spoke
[2:47] on at brother matthews church and
[2:49] and i'm going to share it tonight also
[2:52] it's a
[2:53] little different tonight but
[2:58] you know i believe that we're blessed
[3:02] people
[3:05] because you know there's a lot of people
[3:06] that look in the world and you know
[3:08] people
[3:08] spend years and decades studying the
[3:11] bible
[3:13] looking for truth and
[3:16] they have no idea what the bible says
[3:21] there's a lot of sincere people in the
[3:23] world and they have no idea what the
[3:25] bible says
[3:28] we're we're blessed people that he said
[3:31] blessed are your us
[3:33] for you see and that's god's grace to us
[3:36] that we that we're able to see
[3:40] and you know one of the things that it
[3:41] took for us to see was it took a profit
[3:46] so i you know one of the things i want
[3:49] to look at tonight
[3:50] you know we're a blessed people to have
[3:52] a prophet and it's all the way through
[3:53] the scripture that
[3:55] uh and you know one of the things
[3:59] you know prophets don't speak on their
[4:00] own
[4:03] you know prophets that
[4:07] don't speak without the authority of god
[4:11] you know
[4:13] uh all through the scripture we find out
[4:15] they get in trouble and
[4:18] you know so even you and i we're to
[4:21] speak
[4:22] what god says and not speak what we
[4:25] think
[4:25] right and not what we see
[4:28] but we're supposed to speak the things
[4:31] that we don't see
[4:32] right because if if we see by the eye of
[4:35] faith that doesn't necessarily mean that
[4:36] we see it but we see it by faith
[4:38] right if god said it whether that's what
[4:41] we're supposed to say
[4:42] god said let my word be true and every
[4:45] man a liar
[4:46] amen so we don't we don't look at what
[4:49] we see
[4:50] what goes on around us we look in what
[4:53] god says and that's what we're going
[4:56] that's what we speak
[4:59] and so you know god has blessed us that
[5:03] that we can see and you know those
[5:06] you know you you try to share with
[5:08] people what you see and
[5:10] it doesn't it doesn't get uh past your
[5:14] arms you know
[5:15] it's about that far enough sometimes it
[5:16] don't seem like it gets that far
[5:19] but uh before we read the scripture not
[5:20] let's just all bow our heads and
[5:22] remember each one that's i knew uh
[5:26] man many people are sick and
[5:30] i hadn't heard anything else about
[5:31] brother ray montgomery but
[5:34] i certainly won't remember him and all
[5:35] the other ones they've been fighting
[5:37] this covet thing and
[5:39] a co-worker of mine he found out he's
[5:41] got two masses that they
[5:43] say are cancer and so his name's jack
[5:47] and
[5:47] y'all just remember him he's got he's
[5:49] got a long road ahead of him
[5:52] but you know you just got to keep faith
[5:56] right we don't we don't look at what the
[5:58] doctors can tell us and they can do
[5:59] their own thing but you know god takes
[6:01] over after that you know
[6:03] so we we put our trust in and doctors up
[6:05] to a certain point
[6:06] and after that we we look for the great
[6:08] physician to take over
[6:10] so let's just all bow our heads our
[6:13] gracious heavenly father lord jesus
[6:15] we're just so thankful
[6:16] lord to be in your house tonight on on a
[6:19] tuesday night lord

[8:02] amen first kings
[8:06] chapter 22 verse ones and it says and
[8:09] they continued three years without war
[8:11] between syria and israel
[8:15] and it came to pass in the third year
[8:17] that jehoshaphat the king of judah came
[8:19] down
[8:20] to the king of israel and the king of
[8:22] israel
[8:23] said unto his servants no he that ramoth
[8:26] in gilead is ours and we be still
[8:29] and take it not out of the hand of the
[8:31] king of syria
[8:33] and he said in jehoshaphat will thou go
[8:35] with me
[8:36] to battle to ramos gilead and
[8:39] jehoshaphat
[8:40] said to the king of israel i am as thou
[8:42] art
[8:43] my people as thy people my horses as thy
[8:46] horses
[8:47] and jehoshaphat said unto the king of
[8:49] israel inquire i pray thee
[8:50] at the word of the lord today then the
[8:53] king of israel
[8:55] gathered the prophets together about 400
[8:57] men
[8:58] and said unto them shall i go against
[9:01] ramoth gilead to battle or shall i
[9:03] forebear
[9:04] and they said go up for the lord shall
[9:06] deliver it into the hand of the king
[9:08] and jehoshaphat said is there not here a
[9:11] prophet of the lord besides that we may
[9:14] we might inquire of him and that's where
[9:16] i got my title from
[9:18] is there not here a prophet of the lord
[9:21] and the king of israel said unto
[9:23] jehoshaphat there is yet one man
[9:25] micaiah the son of in-law whom we may
[9:28] inquire the lord
[9:29] but i hate him for he does not prophesy
[9:32] good concerning me but evil
[9:34] and jehoshaphat said let not the king
[9:36] say so
[9:37] amen god bless you tonight you may be
[9:39] seated
[9:45] and you know
[9:56] we know that in
[10:00] you know
[10:03] israel did not have a king when they
[10:06] decided
[10:06] you know they wanted to be like
[10:08] everybody else and they just they
[10:09] desired to be like everybody else and
[10:11] just wanted a king and
[10:13] you know samuel told them said listen
[10:16] said
[10:16] god doesn't want you all to be king he
[10:18] wants to be your king he wants to be
[10:19] your ruler
[10:20] and they were like no we want to be like
[10:21] everybody else we want to
[10:23] be we want to have a king we want to we
[10:26] want to
[10:27] look like everybody else we don't want
[10:28] to stand out and be different we want to
[10:32] and you know samuel come and told him
[10:34] said listen this is what's going to
[10:35] happen to you
[10:36] the king's going to take your sons and
[10:38] your daughters he's going to take the
[10:39] best that you have
[10:41] because he's going to take that for
[10:42] himself because that's what kings do
[10:44] and you know and then samuel said have i
[10:47] ever done anything to you that's not
[10:49] has been contrary to the law has been
[10:51] contrary to god contrary to the word
[10:53] it's like no you've done everything you
[10:54] know if you've never taken from us
[10:55] you've never done anything
[10:57] wrong but he said he said but no we want
[11:01] to be
[11:01] we don't we want to be just like
[11:03] everybody else we want to have a king
[11:05] well you know then you know samuel you
[11:08] know he was brokenhearted in
[11:10] the way that the children of israel done
[11:12] but you know god come and told samuel he
[11:14] said listen
[11:14] he said i want you to know they didn't
[11:16] reject you he said they rejected me
[11:20] and and when they done that you know
[11:22] they chose a great man named saul who
[11:24] was a great man you know great
[11:26] head and shoulders above everybody else
[11:28] is a great great looking man but you
[11:30] know what
[11:31] he was a failure because in all that he
[11:35] done he didn't follow the word
[11:37] and you know and we see david we had we
[11:40] had david who was over the
[11:42] the kingdom you know because after saul
[11:45] uh
[11:46] broke the law and didn't follow the word
[11:49] of the lord
[11:50] you know he put david in and then he had
[11:52] solomon
[11:54] but you know they they had good men but
[11:57] after a while
[11:58] you know they started having uh terrible
[12:01] kings
[12:03] which was what god what samuel tried to
[12:05] tell him in the beginning what was going
[12:07] to take place you're going to have these
[12:08] terrible kings these are what's going to
[12:10] happen
[12:10] because you know these men are not
[12:13] because at a certain point these men are
[12:14] going to raise up and
[12:16] and they're going to be drawn to
[12:17] themselves and they're they're going to
[12:19] be
[12:19] drawn by political power they're going
[12:22] to be drawn by
[12:23] money and other influences that have
[12:26] nothing to do with god
[12:28] and you know and then we see ahab what
[12:30] ahab was the
[12:31] scripture tells us was one of the
[12:33] wickedest kings that
[12:34] israel ever had if not the wickedest
[12:36] king that they ever had and you know
[12:38] here we are
[12:39] seeing ahab and ahab
[12:42] this you know he destroyed the altars of
[12:44] god he tore down everything and built up
[12:47] idols to baal and everything and then
[12:49] you know
[12:50] because of political power because of
[12:53] political
[12:54] structure and and uh what what he could
[12:56] see just in his human self
[12:58] then he marries jezebel and then and you
[13:01] know and it
[13:02] absolutely just destroys the morals of
[13:04] israel
[13:05] and you know here and here they are and
[13:07] you know and it was nothing nothing but
[13:09] just
[13:10] chaos and problems from the beginning
[13:13] but you know that's that's what the
[13:14] forefathers wanted and
[13:16] and then the children had to had to live
[13:18] with that and it was just
[13:20] something that they had been taught and
[13:21] they just they just lived in this
[13:23] ungodly world and that's all they'd ever
[13:25] been seen that's all they'd ever known
[13:27] is this ungodly filth but you know as as
[13:30] ahab began
[13:31] to see these these great things and you
[13:34] know all he had was
[13:35] was the lust of his eyes you know he
[13:37] just wanted more things and he just
[13:38] wanted
[13:39] everything to because he felt like
[13:40] everything ought to be his
[13:42] but you know there was a you know he he
[13:44] stood there and he saw his garden one
[13:46] day and he saw these things and you know
[13:48] he saw a man by the name of naboth and
[13:50] he saw
[13:50] naboth's vineyard and he seen it you
[13:52] know he saw how wonderful it was
[13:54] and you know he wanted naboth's vineyard
[13:57] but you know naboth
[13:58] had a had an inheritance that come from
[14:01] his father's
[14:02] and you know he said he said i'm not
[14:04] going to go away from my inheritance
[14:06] this this belongs to me he said i'm not
[14:08] going to give it up
[14:10] he said no he said i want you to sell
[14:12] this and he's like no i'm not going to
[14:13] sell this
[14:14] and he said he said no he said well i'll
[14:16] swap you for something it's even greater
[14:18] than what you have and he's like no
[14:19] he said this is what's been given to me
[14:21] of my father's he said this is my
[14:23] inheritance this is my land
[14:24] he said i'm not giving it up he said
[14:26] that's what belongs to me
[14:28] well you know what ahab was so
[14:29] distraught because
[14:31] naboth wouldn't sell it wasn't a
[14:33] sell-out but you know he wanted to hold
[14:35] on to what he believed well then
[14:37] ahab was so upset that his that his
[14:40] wicked wife
[14:41] jezebel decided to achieve what having
[14:43] killed
[14:44] so that ahab could get what he wanted
[14:46] now in the midst of all this then
[14:48] you know they sent the spies you know
[14:51] the uh
[14:52] the children of uh uh belial i believe
[14:57] but anyway you know they sent them to be
[14:58] a witness to naboth
[15:00] to tell lies that he had blasphemed god
[15:03] and blasphemed the king
[15:05] and they took him out and they and they
[15:06] murdered naboth
[15:08] well at the same time that as soon as
[15:11] ahab found out that naboth had been
[15:13] killed and that he could take that man's
[15:15] land
[15:16] that he could take away his inheritance
[15:19] then as soon as he went to take
[15:20] possession of it the prophet elijah met
[15:23] him on the road
[15:24] and told him he said because you've
[15:27] slain
[15:27] innocent blood because what you've done
[15:31] now he didn't pick up a rock and he
[15:32] didn't just and he didn't throw anything
[15:34] at him
[15:35] but you know what he was an accessory to
[15:37] murder
[15:38] being the king and knew what his wife
[15:41] was going to do you know what he was
[15:42] sanctioned he sanctioned that
[15:44] and he was and his blood was laid upon
[15:47] abs house
[15:49] and jezebel and all of the children
[15:52] when he when elijah come and told ahab
[15:55] he told ahab he said he said god has
[15:57] cursed your house
[15:58] and your posterity he's going to cut you
[16:01] off
[16:02] he said you won't there will never be
[16:04] anything left of you and then
[16:06] then he goes on and he talks about uh uh
[16:09] it was jeroboam because you know
[16:12] jeroboam had killed to take the throne
[16:15] and you know and the and the uh the
[16:17] other man that had done the same thing
[16:19] and he said you'll be the same way why
[16:20] because
[16:21] you slew innocent blood to take
[16:24] something that didn't belong to you
[16:26] because because you didn't real you
[16:28] didn't uh respect
[16:30] this this man's inheritance
[16:33] he said he said so now the curse has
[16:35] been put upon you and he said
[16:37] you'll never you'll never leave you'll
[16:39] never get away from this curse
[16:41] and so when when ahab had this curse
[16:44] upon him
[16:44] everything that he done was cursed he
[16:47] couldn't get away from that curse
[16:50] because everything that he touched was
[16:51] cursed
[16:53] and so when when
[16:56] when later on we see when when he came
[16:59] to
[17:00] uh he saw that ramoff gilead
[17:04] this city when when he saw that the city
[17:07] and they hadn't fought syria but that
[17:09] was that was one of their israel's
[17:10] biggest
[17:11] uh enemies was was
[17:15] syria and they were all a time in war
[17:16] and everything and they never could
[17:18] overcome why because they had sin in the
[17:20] camp and they couldn't ever get rid of
[17:21] the sin
[17:22] so they syria was there to be a thorn in
[17:24] their flesh
[17:25] thorn in their side just to harass them
[17:28] because they never was right with god
[17:30] and so you know he said he said we see
[17:32] that ramos gilead was given to us by
[17:34] the prophet joshua joshua told that was
[17:37] part of our land that was part of the
[17:39] land that was given to us
[17:40] that was our inheritance but you know
[17:43] what you're not ever going to claim the
[17:44] inheritance of god
[17:46] living in the world you're not ever
[17:48] going to claim the inheritance of god
[17:49] being wishy-washy you've got to be sold
[17:52] out to god and live by god's rules and
[17:54] god's
[17:54] law then so he said well i just want to
[17:57] take this land because i see that it
[17:59] belongs to me
[18:00] because they were reading and he saw how
[18:01] good ramoff gilead looked
[18:04] but you know what he still was laying
[18:05] under a curse
[18:07] and so when he went out there and then
[18:08] micaiah he said he said
[18:10] uh what we need in jehoshaphat said
[18:14] inquire of god to find out if this will
[18:16] if we can take this city or not yeah
[18:19] sure
[18:20] and you know what he had he had 400
[18:23] hebrew prophets
[18:25] you know he just didn't have anybody he
[18:27] didn't just get anybody off the street
[18:30] but he had 400 hebrew prophets stand
[18:33] there and tell him
[18:34] because why because they knew which side
[18:37] the bread was buttered on
[18:39] because they knew exactly what to do to
[18:42] make ahab and jezebel happy
[18:44] and so they could get up there and they
[18:45] could say oh no you just go ahead
[18:47] and take it the lord the lord's with you
[18:49] the lord will bless you the you can take
[18:51] ramoff gilead it's yours go ahead
[18:54] because
[18:55] it was prophesied to you well the
[18:58] problem was
[18:59] when you know that there was something
[19:01] jehoshaphat had just enough god about
[19:03] him
[19:05] to realize there was something problem
[19:07] there was a problem in there
[19:09] he had just enough spirituality about
[19:11] him that that didn't ring right
[19:15] but he didn't have enough spirituality
[19:17] about him to realize
[19:18] the man that he was hanging out with
[19:20] that he was fellowshipping with
[19:21] was cursed that he was that he had no
[19:24] business being there
[19:26] but he stood there and said you and i
[19:28] are just alike
[19:30] my horses are your horses and my
[19:32] chariots are your chariots
[19:34] he didn't even need to be in the same
[19:36] town
[19:38] but you know what he's like oh no no
[19:40] this sounds great this sounds great
[19:42] until he finds then until he hears the
[19:44] word of these 400 prophets
[19:47] and then it's like well this don't sound
[19:49] very good
[19:50] he said is there someone else that we
[19:52] can talk to
[19:54] he said is there someone else that we
[19:55] can inquire of god with
[19:58] is there someone else that might know
[20:00] how to talk to god
[20:01] who get an answer from god
[20:05] he's like well we got this one guy that
[20:07] we don't like
[20:09] he don't like us and we don't we don't
[20:11] really associate with him
[20:14] but he's like here's this one man let's
[20:16] let but he said let's go talk to micaiah
[20:19] well micaiah you know when when it come
[20:21] down to micaiah speaking
[20:23] speaking of of when he said can we uh
[20:26] were you an inquirer of god
[20:28] to if we can uh take ramos gilead
[20:32] well when when mikaya come up there he's
[20:35] like he said
[20:36] you know now now we want you to talk
[20:38] just like the rest of these prophets we
[20:40] we want you to we want you to be in step
[20:43] you know
[20:44] we want you to be just like everybody
[20:45] else just you know
[20:47] all you got to do is give up here and
[20:48] give your stamp of approval just give
[20:50] them a thumbs up and tell them
[20:51] everything's all right
[20:54] well you know micaiah just went up and
[20:56] told them y'all go ahead and go up go
[20:57] ahead
[20:59] but i'm going to tell you something
[21:01] y'all go ahead y'all y'all want to so
[21:03] bad
[21:03] well go ahead let me tell you what's
[21:05] going to happen
[21:07] you're going to get killed it's your
[21:09] death he said i see israel scattered
[21:11] like sheep
[21:12] i see what it's destruction but y'all go
[21:14] ahead i know that's what you want that's
[21:16] what's in your heart to do
[21:18] and then he said oh you know he was so
[21:21] mad that you know because this this is
[21:22] what you know
[21:23] you're just always saying bad things you
[21:25] just you just can't go along with
[21:26] with the program well the thing is is
[21:29] macayah
[21:30] had the word from god that that they
[21:32] shouldn't take that
[21:34] but you know the one thing about micaiah
[21:36] was makaya just didn't speak of his own
[21:38] word
[21:39] micaiah spoke because elijah had already
[21:42] cursed
[21:43] micaiah i'm sorry he'd already cursed
[21:45] ahab
[21:46] so when micaiah got the word of god then
[21:48] he looked back
[21:49] and he looked at what elijah had said
[21:52] and elijah had already cursed ahab so
[21:55] when makaya walked out there
[21:56] micaiah couldn't say anything else but
[21:59] he could only cur
[22:00] say what god had already said through of
[22:02] the prophet elijah and he had already
[22:04] been cursed and there was nothing he
[22:05] could else he could say
[22:07] he said he said your curse and he said
[22:09] there's nothing else you can say
[22:14] he said no matter
[22:17] you know how fundamentally you write you
[22:20] can be and everything looks so good and
[22:22] everything everything's so laid out so
[22:23] everything's so perfect
[22:24] yet you got to look back at what the
[22:26] word says and the word says
[22:28] that they were cursed and so you know
[22:31] then they go well you know
[22:33] they come down on micaiah and told him
[22:35] listen he said you
[22:37] you uh curse us and and say all these
[22:39] things and you know
[22:40] and then the the priest smacked him in
[22:43] the mouth and
[22:46] said you know where did the spirit of
[22:48] god go
[22:50] when it left me you know they locked him
[22:53] up and told him to
[22:54] feed him water and the bread of
[22:55] affliction and bread of sorrow and he
[22:58] said when
[22:58] when i come back i'll deal with him
[23:01] and he said you know if the gods if you
[23:04] come back god didn't speak to me
[23:07] so we understand that you know that that
[23:10] how important it is
[23:12] you know when we look at the word as
[23:14] mccain did makaya look back at
[23:16] what the scripture had said what the
[23:18] prophets had said
[23:19] because if jehoshaphat had actually been
[23:22] spiritual spiritual he'd actually known
[23:26] what had happened
[23:27] he'd already seen what had taken place
[23:29] but micaiah was standing there
[23:31] and then he had told him this is what's
[23:34] going to take place well if if
[23:36] jehoshaphat had been spiritual enough
[23:39] then you know what he should have packed
[23:40] his bags and went home
[23:42] he should have seen the destruction he
[23:45] said but you know what he went on anyway
[23:49] can we can we can we inquire of a
[23:52] prophet
[23:53] is there somebody that we can acquire of
[23:55] what god has to say
[23:57] and when he does then you know what he
[23:59] turns around and walks contrary to what
[24:00] god said
[24:02] and you know and then they wonder why
[24:03] people people wonder why they end up in
[24:05] trouble just like jehoshaphat did
[24:07] why because you know what he felt like
[24:09] he could he could just do whatever he
[24:10] wanted to
[24:13] and people people just want to follow
[24:15] whatever they whatever they believe
[24:20] but it's so important because god has
[24:22] has always
[24:23] from the beginning he's always had
[24:25] prophets
[24:27] right and he's always laid it out and
[24:30] and so you know the the prophets have
[24:32] always spoken
[24:33] by the word and they always dovetailed
[24:36] amen
[24:40] and we know that when you know when
[24:43] god wanted wanted to speak to the
[24:45] children of israel with moses
[24:47] and you know they they he wanted to
[24:49] speak to them and
[24:51] uh have have their own burning bush
[24:54] experience
[24:55] you know there came a time when the
[24:57] children of israel because because they
[24:59] seen
[24:59] the power and and the majesty and
[25:02] everything of the greatness of god you
[25:04] know if
[25:04] it scared the the children of israel and
[25:06] they and they were interfere and it's
[25:08] like glory
[25:09] moses moses you speak for god said we
[25:11] don't want we don't want to have what
[25:13] you have
[25:14] we don't want to have an experience like
[25:16] you have he said oh you go and tell him
[25:18] you go talk to god and you have you come
[25:20] tell us what god wants us to do
[25:22] and that's what we'll do but we don't
[25:24] want to have that experience
[25:26] and so he said fine he said if that's
[25:28] the way you want it he said that's the
[25:29] way it'll always be
[25:30] he said so we'll always have prophets
[25:32] that come and speak
[25:34] and so we know we know that when
[25:37] when moses was speaking and and and
[25:40] deuteronomy
[25:42] and and 18 generally 18
[25:48] verse 17 says and the lord said unto me
[25:51] they have well spoken that which they
[25:53] have spoken
[25:55] he said i will raise them up a prophet
[25:57] from among their brethren
[25:59] like unto thee and i will put my words
[26:01] in his mouth
[26:02] and he shall speak unto them all that i
[26:04] shall command thee
[26:06] to get that up there
[26:11] and he shall speak unto them all that i
[26:13] shall command him and it shall come to
[26:15] pass that whosoever
[26:16] will not hearken unto my words which he
[26:19] shall speak in my name
[26:21] i will require it of him but the prophet
[26:22] which shall presume to speak a word in
[26:24] my name
[26:25] which i have not commanded him to speak
[26:28] or that
[26:29] shall speak in the name of other gods
[26:31] even that prophet shall die
[26:34] and if thou say in thine heart how shall
[26:38] we know
[26:39] the word which the lord hath not spoken
[26:43] when a prophet speaketh in the name of
[26:45] the lord if the thing
[26:46] fallen not nor come to pass that is the
[26:49] thing which the lord have not spoken but
[26:51] the prophet
[26:52] has spoken it presumptuously thou shalt
[26:55] not
[26:56] be afraid of him
[27:05] and this is from what brother is
[27:07] speaking on this
[27:08] in uh modern events made clear by
[27:10] prophecies
[27:11] he says now notice notice he began to
[27:14] speak with moses the prophet a prophet
[27:16] deuteronomy 18 15.
[27:18] he said i'm watching the scripture here
[27:20] he said see
[27:21] he said drop down and see god spoke to
[27:23] him on top of the mountain oh my the
[27:25] thundering they said
[27:26] let the lord let moses speak not god
[27:28] speak lest we perish
[27:30] he said then he said they said well i
[27:32] won't speak to them no more like this
[27:34] but i'll raise them up a prophet that's
[27:37] that's been his message all the way
[27:39] through that's what's got to settle the
[27:41] whole thing
[27:42] at the end it's just got to because the
[27:44] word of the lord has come
[27:46] has to come to the prophet it's the only
[27:48] thing
[27:49] it can come to if it don't it breaks
[27:52] god's word
[27:53] and makes him tell something wrong see
[27:55] it'll never go
[27:56] to a seminary goes to a prophet and the
[27:59] prophet is sent
[28:00] from god so we know that he sent
[28:04] he sent the word by the prophet
[28:07] and we know that in in the beginning
[28:10] we know that when it became and it was
[28:12] spoken by the prophet
[28:15] you know when god had had a
[28:18] a secret that he wanted to reveal when
[28:21] when he had
[28:22] when he had attributes that he wanted to
[28:25] express you know
[28:26] he had to he had to make that that known
[28:29] and so as he began
[28:30] to express those attributes you know he
[28:32] began to make it known
[28:33] brother brown said he said that great
[28:35] secret mystery that he had before the
[28:37] foundation of the world
[28:39] and he wanted to begin to express
[28:40] himself and so as he began to express
[28:43] himself he began to express it through
[28:45] the prophets
[28:47] and each prophet began to express what
[28:50] god
[28:50] was showing him and each one of them
[28:52] began to express
[28:54] the the portion of
[28:57] christ that was to be manifested in that
[29:00] time
[29:00] and and we know as he began to express
[29:02] these things you know it was hid from
[29:04] hit from the world and people didn't
[29:06] understand what was going on but you
[29:08] know
[29:08] when they went to look back and then
[29:10] other times they they
[29:12] sent prophets and the prophets pointed
[29:14] the people back to what the previous
[29:16] prophet had said
[29:17] because then it became clear to what
[29:19] what was what
[29:20] had been said because there were times
[29:22] that you know they were
[29:23] they were you know um
[29:27] things just like isaiah when isaiah was
[29:29] speaking of
[29:30] you know a a virgin shall conceive well
[29:33] you know
[29:33] there was there was a lot of people out
[29:35] there that was a little confused about
[29:37] all that you know and there was a lot of
[29:38] people that didn't believe him you know
[29:39] it's like you know what
[29:40] wonder word you've been doing isaiah
[29:42] that you even talk like this you know
[29:44] how can these things be well then the
[29:47] other side of that coin is
[29:48] people you know everybody that had they
[29:50] were hoping to have a little girl
[29:52] and they were expecting this girl to be
[29:54] be the one that was going to fulfill the
[29:55] law of my of
[29:56] the word of isaiah you know everyone was
[29:59] looking for something that was going to
[30:00] take place
[30:02] well then you know there you know all of
[30:03] a sudden they hear the eye in the days
[30:05] of isaiah when the word went forth
[30:07] you know there were people that were
[30:08] looking for this to be fulfilled well
[30:10] then you know what
[30:11] after after that generation passed you
[30:13] know it was like well
[30:15] we heard isaiah say and then you know
[30:18] the other ones well it was just another
[30:20] fable
[30:22] and did isaiah actually say that
[30:25] you know did this actually take place or
[30:27] this just words that somebody said
[30:29] and you know it's like well you know we
[30:31] don't know what was going to take place
[30:32] but you know what when when 800 years
[30:35] later when everybody had forgot about it
[30:37] and it was just
[30:37] it was just tall tales and fables and
[30:40] and you know it was just well you know
[30:41] that's what granny said
[30:43] and you know we heard her say this and
[30:45] you know we heard them say that
[30:46] and you know that's what's in these old
[30:48] books and these old scrolls
[30:50] say this but you know there was a there
[30:52] was a lot of people you know they had
[30:54] just they had just glossed over that it
[30:55] didn't mean anything to them
[30:58] but you know there come a time when
[30:59] people began to look into the scripture
[31:01] and you know it wasn't it wasn't just
[31:03] words on a page but it was something
[31:04] that was real to them
[31:06] because you know they actually believed
[31:07] that god was going no matter how many
[31:09] years it had passed
[31:10] that god had had said that they still
[31:13] believed that it was going to come to
[31:14] pass
[31:15] they still believed that that was going
[31:17] to go be in in
[31:19] one of these days that no matter we
[31:21] don't understand how it's going to take
[31:22] place we don't
[31:23] we don't understand that but we know
[31:25] that there's going to be one that's
[31:26] going to fulfill this
[31:28] and you know and so you know how is this
[31:30] going to take place well we don't know
[31:31] but we know
[31:32] that isaiah said it that's right but you
[31:35] know it's not it's not just
[31:36] one thing that isaiah said but it was
[31:38] each prophet
[31:40] that began to speak
[31:46] as brother brown's speaking
[31:50] you know there was it was a
[31:53] a secret that was there that that he was
[31:55] expressing
[31:56] but you know as it began to be expressed
[31:59] then it became a mystery to people
[32:01] and you know that was that was the
[32:03] expression because you know
[32:05] amos amos 3 7 says that the lord god
[32:08] would do
[32:09] nothing except he reveal his secret to
[32:11] his servants the prophets
[32:14] but then revelation 10 7 tells us but in
[32:16] the days of the voice of the seventh
[32:18] angel when he shall begin to sound
[32:20] the mystery shall be fulfilled
[32:23] so it had to be at first it was a secret
[32:25] that the secret was being made known but
[32:27] people didn't understand that but as the
[32:29] seeker was being made known
[32:30] then it became a mystery to the people
[32:33] but then that's what
[32:33] caught the people's attention was the
[32:35] mystery
[32:37] just like when moses was standing there
[32:39] and he's and he was out there and
[32:41] after all the struggles and the
[32:42] heartaches and the failures that he had
[32:44] went through
[32:45] then he was standing up there watching a
[32:46] bunch of sheep out in the middle of
[32:48] nowhere
[32:48] looking at all this desert and just
[32:50] wondering what was gonna become of his
[32:52] life
[32:52] when one of these days he saw a burning
[32:55] bush he saw a burst that was on fire
[32:57] but the bush wasn't consumed but but at
[33:00] that time
[33:01] see then it became a mystery to him why
[33:03] because it was god revealing himself
[33:05] unveiling himself and that was what the
[33:07] mystery caught his attention
[33:08] then he turned and said well i'm going
[33:10] to inquire why
[33:12] this bush is on fire but it's not being
[33:14] consumed
[33:15] so you know he could as a brother adam
[33:17] said you know moses could have went up
[33:19] there and took a scientific approach to
[33:21] it
[33:22] and you know he wanted to take some of
[33:23] the the bush and he wanted to do
[33:25] testing and all kinds of stuff but you
[33:27] know it was something that caught his
[33:28] attention that he turned
[33:30] and he wanted to find out more about
[33:32] this
[33:33] but then when he turned he had he had a
[33:35] desire to find out something
[33:37] god could speak to him when he turned to
[33:39] inquire
[33:40] then god could speak to moses and tell
[33:42] him
[33:43] he said he said you know because you've
[33:45] always heard your entire life that
[33:47] you're going to be a deliverer
[33:49] well now now you've gotten to the place
[33:51] where you can be a deliverer
[33:53] because all your faults and failures and
[33:55] trying to do it in yourself
[33:56] and all these things that's not that was
[33:58] not my plan
[33:59] my plan is for you to follow me and now
[34:02] it's that was the time that you can do
[34:04] that
[34:05] and so you know all those things that
[34:07] had taken place all through the
[34:08] scripture we see those things
[34:09] where god began to unveil himself and he
[34:12] made him making himself known well there
[34:14] was something that was real to the
[34:15] prophets
[34:16] but that didn't mean it was real to
[34:17] everybody else
[34:19] you know noah spent 120 years in his
[34:21] generation
[34:22] building an ark telling people it was
[34:25] going to do something they'd never seen
[34:26] before
[34:27] but he stood up there and said listen
[34:29] water's going to fall from the sky
[34:32] we're going to all the scientific all
[34:34] the scientific evidence in the world
[34:35] proved and there was no no such thing in
[34:38] the world
[34:39] but you know what he stood up constantly
[34:41] and consistently building an ark
[34:45] and he kept preaching that it was going
[34:47] to rain
[34:48] and all the and all the ridicule that
[34:50] the man faced and all the problems that
[34:52] he faced
[34:53] and yet he kept preaching to these
[34:56] people
[34:56] and trying to show them the grace of god
[34:59] that it was going to reign
[35:00] that judgment was coming and there's a
[35:02] way out
[35:03] but you know what they did they didn't
[35:04] ex they didn't see that they thought
[35:06] well here's another kook you know we
[35:07] just got we just got to deal with this
[35:09] person
[35:10] and you know you know they just want to
[35:11] come by and ridicule him and and
[35:13] you know cause trouble and everything
[35:15] like that but you know he still preached
[35:17] the word of god he was still
[35:19] the grace of god he was still mercy to
[35:22] the people of that day
[35:23] that was standing in leather his shoe
[35:26] leather
[35:26] standing there speaking to the people
[35:28] that it's time to get ready there's a
[35:30] way out but there's destruction coming
[35:32] but they didn't they didn't accept that
[35:35] and every and every one of the prophets
[35:37] as you look through their life
[35:39] you see god was expressing himself in a
[35:41] special way and
[35:43] you know we see even even down we see
[35:45] that joseph was
[35:46] was spoken you know as a perfect type of
[35:49] christ
[35:50] as and the whole life of joseph you know
[35:52] because you know
[35:53] being the one that was spiritual
[35:56] you know he was hated of his brethren
[35:58] but you know god
[35:59] had his hand on joseph and he and all
[36:02] the things that that he had faced in his
[36:04] life
[36:04] but you know he was loved of his father
[36:07] and you know here he wasn't he was he
[36:10] was loved of his brother
[36:11] his father so much that he was given a
[36:13] coat of many colors
[36:14] you know and and brother i'm saying this
[36:16] this coat you know it represents a
[36:17] covenant
[36:18] and you know here he is here is this one
[36:20] you know everybody thought well here's
[36:21] the seer
[36:22] and his brother's hating him so much
[36:25] that they
[36:26] they wanted they contemplated killing
[36:28] him
[36:29] and so you know here he is as a perfect
[36:32] type of
[36:32] of of his christ here you know
[36:36] here he wasn't and he was like well you
[36:38] know they didn't want to kill him
[36:40] but you know they made it look like he
[36:42] was killed
[36:45] and so you know he took
[36:50] you know they threw him into the into
[36:53] the pit
[36:55] and they took that you know they took
[36:56] his coat and they dipped it in blood and
[36:59] you know how all of those things type
[37:01] type the life of christ
[37:03] and in a perfect in a perfect uh
[37:06] story how we see each one of those
[37:09] because you know
[37:10] here here was christ he came and he was
[37:12] spiritual and he and he spoke to his
[37:13] brethren and he
[37:14] and he wanted to tell them that listen
[37:17] he had a prophecy that spoke to the
[37:20] brethren and tell them
[37:21] listen there's going to be things are
[37:22] going to take place he said i'll see all
[37:24] that y'all going to bow down to me and
[37:26] you know that just made him mad but they
[37:27] didn't realize you know he was trying to
[37:29] tell them the future
[37:30] he was trying to to bring these things
[37:32] and you know and he was like well
[37:34] you know we're we're just going to take
[37:35] him and we're going to take his coat and
[37:38] you know they they they took his coat
[37:40] and they dipped it in blood and then
[37:41] they
[37:42] threw him in the pit and they sold him
[37:43] for 30 pieces of silver and all that you
[37:45] know
[37:45] and as you see here this um
[37:48] the the coat you know it was as a type
[37:51] of christ
[37:52] you know being crucified as you know you
[37:54] can see that there was that covenant
[37:56] you know there was dipped in blood you
[37:57] know the flesh had to die he was
[37:59] sacrificed the flesh was sacrificed but
[38:01] then we saw
[38:01] the spirit left and you know went to the
[38:03] right hand of the father
[38:05] which is the right hand of pharaoh and
[38:07] you know we've seen all the things that
[38:08] as he was there
[38:09] you know speaking to the butcher and the
[38:11] baker and and all those type things all
[38:13] the way through the
[38:14] life you know of christ you know being
[38:15] on the on the cross and all these things
[38:17] but you know
[38:18] all of those things went that he went
[38:20] through
[38:21] but all of those things but when it came
[38:23] to the end it was to preserve
[38:25] life you know when he began to speak to
[38:28] his brethren and you know
[38:29] he was so happy to see them and yet they
[38:31] were so fearful when he made itself
[38:33] known to them
[38:34] after all that he had went through
[38:36] because he began to tell them because it
[38:38] was
[38:38] it was he said y'all he said john meant
[38:40] this for
[38:41] for trouble he said y'all meant this for
[38:44] evil he said but god has done this
[38:46] for good he said god has done this to
[38:48] preserve life
[38:49] and you know he wanted to show them the
[38:51] love that that he was wanting to bestow
[38:53] on them and they thought it was because
[38:55] you know they go well this is terrible
[38:57] here we are in this position
[38:58] you know because we're trying to survive
[39:00] this famine and here
[39:02] here's our brother that you know that
[39:03] we've treated so badly
[39:05] and yet he wanted to make himself known
[39:07] and listen he was so blessed he said
[39:09] look what god has done
[39:10] he said because there's such a famine
[39:12] and yet god has called me to save the
[39:14] world
[39:15] the the known world here we are in egypt
[39:17] the greatest nation in the world and
[39:19] we're able to say
[39:20] serve up you know store up food and he
[39:22] said now y'all can partake
[39:24] and he said there's a place for y'all to
[39:26] come
[39:28] that y'all can that y'all can weather
[39:29] out this this famine
[39:31] and you never have to hunger and so and
[39:34] all these things that have taken place
[39:35] you know it's a perfect type of christ
[39:37] because you know the thing is is
[39:39] god makes a way for us because he loves
[39:42] us so much that he's made a way for us
[39:44] but the thing is is do you accept the
[39:46] way of god
[39:47] he said because if you don't accept what
[39:50] god has done for you
[39:51] he's he always makes a way of mercy and
[39:53] grace but the question is
[39:54] will you accept it
[39:58] and then if you accept it then you know
[39:59] what there's a way out but if you don't
[40:01] the only thing is is judgment
[40:06] but god has blessed us
[40:13] so we come through and as he began to
[40:16] speak all the way through the bible
[40:18] we see him speaking through each one of
[40:20] the prophets each one of them began to
[40:24] manifest part of of the word
[40:27] and so when when you know when he began
[40:30] as john was the last one john the
[40:32] baptist was the last one that came
[40:34] and you know as the
[40:38] said that you know the the prophets
[40:40] built the body
[40:42] you know they preached the word that
[40:43] that he stepped out on
[40:45] that you know that he began to this
[40:46] whole time he began to express himself
[40:48] through the prophets
[40:49] and he made himself known so that when
[40:51] john came
[40:52] john was pointing him back to the
[40:54] scripture to tell him that
[40:56] listen he said you've heard all of these
[40:58] things that have been preached you have
[41:00] heard
[41:00] all the prophets you've heard what moses
[41:02] has said all the way from the beginning
[41:05] and you've seen all this been made
[41:06] manifest but now
[41:09] the one that has been meant you know
[41:11] that has been prophesied all this time
[41:13] he said now he's here he said i don't
[41:15] know where he's at but i can tell you
[41:17] that he's here
[41:18] the one he said that i'm unworthy to
[41:20] unloose his lad
[41:21] his shoe latches but i want you to know
[41:24] that he is here to fill you
[41:26] with the holy ghost and fire he said he
[41:28] said he said i can baptize you with
[41:30] water
[41:30] but he said there's one that's coming to
[41:32] bring you into
[41:34] a new relationship to bring you into a
[41:36] new position
[41:37] because all the things that have been
[41:39] prophesied through the old testament
[41:41] now is it is is for here to be fulfilled
[41:46] and so you know only after all these
[41:48] people have studied all this and all the
[41:49] pharisees and
[41:50] and all the all the scribes and all the
[41:52] priests and all the things that they had
[41:54] said all these years and talked about
[41:55] when he stepped out before them you know
[41:58] they couldn't believe that this
[41:59] is this is the one they didn't even they
[42:02] didn't even believe
[42:03] john was the one
[42:06] you know when jesus when jesus was
[42:08] speaking to the scribes and the
[42:09] pharisees that time
[42:10] he asked him he said he said uh they
[42:13] want to know how
[42:14] you know by what authority do you do
[42:16] these miracles
[42:17] he said well let me ask you a question
[42:19] he said by what he said
[42:20] was john's baptism was it a man or was
[42:23] it of god
[42:27] and you know and you know he said they
[42:29] they were afraid
[42:30] now they didn't believe that john was a
[42:32] prophet but the scripture says
[42:34] that they were afraid because the people
[42:35] believed that john was a prophet
[42:38] that's right because they said they said
[42:40] well if it be of man
[42:42] they were going to be in trouble because
[42:43] the people were going to riot
[42:45] they were afraid that they were going to
[42:47] have a mess on their hands
[42:50] but he said he said well they can't say
[42:51] that it's of god because if they told
[42:53] jesus
[42:54] whether the baptism of john was of god
[42:56] well then he would be saying well why
[42:57] didn't you follow it
[42:59] you were you were required to follow the
[43:00] word of god and if you say it's of god
[43:02] well he said well we don't know
[43:05] why because they knew that they were
[43:06] backed into a corner
[43:09] but when when john began to speak of the
[43:11] word then he began to speak
[43:13] and he said the spirit of the lord came
[43:15] to him and told john
[43:16] he said the one whom you see the spirit
[43:18] of god
[43:19] like a dove descend and stay he said
[43:22] then you'll know that's the one
[43:24] and he began to speak and he said this
[43:26] is behold the lamb of god who takes away
[43:28] the sin of the world
[43:30] all the way through the scripture he
[43:31] began to point back to what had been
[43:33] said
[43:33] and here was the manifestation of that
[43:35] word
[43:36] and then when jesus began to speak you
[43:39] know
[43:40] he began to speak then he began to point
[43:42] back the whole time
[43:43] he began to speak of what was said why
[43:47] because they had walked away from the
[43:48] scripture
[43:49] he said so when jesus come jesus didn't
[43:51] bring no anything new to tell
[43:53] he kept telling what the law said he
[43:55] said look back
[43:56] he said he said search the scriptures he
[43:59] said he said
[44:00] and and he did search the scriptures
[44:03] he said in them you think you have
[44:05] eternal life he said
[44:06] they are they that testify of me he said
[44:09] he said where he said show me where i
[44:11] disbelieve the word
[44:12] show them where i've not fulfilled the
[44:14] word right
[44:15] see he kept pointing them back to the
[44:17] word to show them listen this is what
[44:19] this is the fulfillment of the word
[44:21] and he began to show listen but you know
[44:23] they didn't want to believe that
[44:25] right and so you know god you know and
[44:28] we understand that that was that was the
[44:30] grace of god that you know because
[44:32] if it hadn't been for them being blinded
[44:36] and and disallowing and turning over
[44:38] aside the messiah then you know we never
[44:40] would have been able to come in
[44:42] but you know it was grace of god that he
[44:44] called us and he made a way because it
[44:46] was prophesied in the old testament
[44:48] that they would be old gentiles that
[44:49] would come in as in joseph you know we
[44:52] understand that joseph had a
[44:53] had a gentile wife
[44:59] but we know that we know that all the
[45:03] way through the scripture
[45:05] the prophets just as jesus was rejected
[45:09] every one of the prophets was rejected
[45:13] when jesus began to speak he said he
[45:16] said he said you garnished the tombs
[45:18] he said you polished the tombs of the
[45:20] prophets
[45:21] and the spiritual ones that have come
[45:23] and he said he said which one of the if
[45:24] your father's not put there
[45:26] and he said you know he said oh he said
[45:28] if we'd have been if you know we're
[45:30] abraham's seed if we was in abraham's
[45:32] day we'd do
[45:33] we'd follow abraham and if we were in
[45:35] the days of the prophets we'd follow the
[45:36] prophets
[45:37] and he said he said but today is the day
[45:39] of the word and he said now he said i'm
[45:41] pointing you back to the word
[45:42] and he said you he said you don't
[45:44] believe this word he said you of your
[45:46] you are your of your father the devil
[45:48] and he said the works that he do he says
[45:50] what the works that he does you do
[45:53] and so they point them right back to the
[45:55] word and they did not fulfill the word
[45:57] they did not believe the word
[45:58] but you know there was a time but there
[46:00] was a group there was a small group a
[46:02] remnant that believed what was said
[46:05] in the midst of a midst of all that
[46:07] insanity and chaos
[46:08] because brother brown said he said it
[46:10] was a golden time when the people
[46:12] believed the word of god
[46:14] but he said when they rejected the word
[46:16] he said it was a time of chaos
[46:19] he said he said why he said why was
[46:21] solomon's temple
[46:22] and solomon's reign such a such a
[46:24] glorious time it's because the people
[46:26] believe what my what solomon
[46:28] said but you can look back at all the
[46:31] other
[46:31] prophets and the different ones and yet
[46:33] how many of them were sown asunder and
[46:35] murdered
[46:35] and killed and rebuked for what they had
[46:38] said but then when they come to find out
[46:40] that it was true then they turned around
[46:41] and said oh
[46:42] really well you know you know what a
[46:45] wonderful prophet what a wonderful
[46:46] prophet
[46:47] you know and we honor all these people
[46:50] and yet they had turned down and
[46:51] destroyed everything that they had done
[46:57] and the same thing with you and i
[47:00] because when he began to speak and he
[47:02] began to
[47:04] he began to un fulfill itself manifest
[47:07] itself
[47:07] and fulfill the word that was written he
[47:10] began because you know
[47:11] jesus had had a desire had something
[47:13] that he wanted
[47:14] to make manifest and he was and
[47:17] and and all the way brother and i said
[47:19] all the way through the the old
[47:20] testament all through the scripture we
[47:22] see that in types we said we see there
[47:24] was a partial word that was being
[47:26] made manifest but then when he became he
[47:29] became the fulfillment of that
[47:31] but then he wanted he wanted to fulfill
[47:33] another portion of himself
[47:35] and which was the bride there was a
[47:37] bride to be made manifest
[47:38] and brother ram said you know he said it
[47:40] was it was the word of god
[47:42] it was the word of christ it was the
[47:43] body of christ being made
[47:45] manifest in bright form so
[47:48] you know because when he when he came
[47:51] yet he was he was just like when adam
[47:53] came
[47:53] he said because adam came and he was he
[47:56] was the manifestation
[47:58] of god in human flesh and yet there was
[48:01] another portion why because he was
[48:03] lonely
[48:04] there was another portion to be
[48:06] expressed and when he become to when he
[48:08] came to this time then you know when he
[48:10] came on the in the earth as as walking
[48:13] fulfilling the word there was another
[48:15] portion that he wanted to make in
[48:16] which was himself in bride form and so
[48:19] when
[48:20] he came there you know he he was
[48:22] crucified
[48:23] that that that the bride could the
[48:25] spirit the life that could leave him
[48:27] that could go and and redeem the ones
[48:29] that he had called
[48:30] that that so there was a bride that had
[48:32] to be made manifest and then they began
[48:34] to manifest the word
[48:37] the word of their day and so you know
[48:40] you know here they are all all of these
[48:42] ones you know here
[48:43] as brother ram said they were standing
[48:45] in the temple after they had seen him
[48:48] preach for three and a half years
[48:51] and seen the miracles that he had done
[48:53] and all the things that he had done
[48:54] and they stood there in the temple and
[48:57] they stood there
[48:58] singing my god my god why hast thou
[49:01] forsaken me
[49:02] singing the prophecies that david had
[49:05] wrote in the psalms
[49:06] and they were standing there singing
[49:08] those things and he said out there on
[49:10] golgotha was the fulfillment of that
[49:12] word
[49:12] and they let him hang out there naked
[49:14] and rebuked and despised
[49:16] by the world and that was the
[49:17] fulfillment of what they were desiring
[49:20] and you know how beautiful it was but
[49:22] you know that that was that was the
[49:24] grace of god why because it was grace to
[49:26] us because you know it still
[49:27] it came that you and i could come in
[49:30] that he called you and
[49:31] all the way through the scripture you
[49:33] know when when paul came
[49:35] and he stood there and he began to speak
[49:37] to the people when they started to get
[49:38] away from the word of god
[49:40] and he said you've lost your first love
[49:42] and he went back and he started pointing
[49:43] him right back to the scripture
[49:45] and you know here he is here's a here's
[49:46] a great learned man paul
[49:48] standing there speaking and he was
[49:50] pointing him right back to the day
[49:51] and he was like look he said back there
[49:54] in days of moses when they had the
[49:56] tabernacle and they had the shoe bread
[49:58] and they had the altar and he began to
[49:59] express each one of those things and he
[50:01] began to express
[50:02] each one of those things and he showed
[50:04] jesus christ and he walked through
[50:06] he walked with them all the way through
[50:07] the scripture when they were out there
[50:09] in the wilderness and there he was
[50:10] walking he was a
[50:12] cloud by day a pillar of fire by night
[50:14] and he was standing and it was grace
[50:16] manifested in a prophet that was hidden
[50:18] in a prophet and he began to speak to
[50:20] him and he began paul began to bring
[50:22] back all the things
[50:23] that from the old testament and he began
[50:25] to bring it present tense
[50:26] and show this is the fulfillment of that
[50:28] word and see jesus christ has always
[50:31] been on this journey
[50:32] all the way through manifesting himself
[50:34] to his people
[50:35] and he began to express each one of
[50:37] these things and he began to show
[50:38] the same thing that had taken all the
[50:40] way through and people hadn't seen it
[50:42] but that was the day
[50:43] that mo that paul came to show all the
[50:45] things that had taken place in the old
[50:47] testament
[50:50] and we we see that you know as it as all
[50:53] the way went through the
[50:54] as it goes through the uh
[50:58] the church ages you know
[51:01] jesus said unless a quarter a week die
[51:05] and go on the ground and die he said it
[51:08] abideth alone
[51:10] amen amen
[51:14] and how many people they they were so
[51:18] you know they were so
[51:21] you know when people they're they're
[51:23] they're so um
[51:25] blind but you know they see these things
[51:28] and they
[51:28] wonder why why would did god allow these
[51:31] things to take place
[51:34] why why did why because it was it was
[51:36] the plan of god because god was
[51:38] manifesting his attributes
[51:41] as as you know you know because he he
[51:44] he allowed he allowed the devil to do
[51:46] his work
[51:47] bring in bring in a little saying
[51:53] you know begin to mix mix the word with
[51:56] man's word man's ideas begin to
[52:00] begin to work all the way through why
[52:03] because it was fulfilling all the way
[52:04] through the scripture and people say
[52:06] you know it came that that we we see
[52:08] when the when the
[52:09] red horse rider began to ride and and
[52:11] all these this murder and everything
[52:13] it's like what a terrible time
[52:15] but you know that was the fulfillment of
[52:16] god's word he began to manifest
[52:19] the the attributes of god and people
[52:22] don't see that they say well that's
[52:23] you know how can how can a god stand
[52:25] there and and see these things take
[52:27] place and just
[52:28] be quiet when when all these children
[52:30] were being killed when when
[52:32] babies were taken from their mothers
[52:33] when they were removed from their
[52:35] mothers unborn
[52:36] and then here they are being destroyed
[52:38] and how how can that be how can be that
[52:40] that be the uh
[52:43] the will of god for all these things to
[52:45] take place how can all these things and
[52:47] we can't
[52:48] we don't understand but it takes it
[52:49] takes the mind of god to understand
[52:51] these things
[52:52] it takes it takes the life of god and
[52:54] the only way that you understand these
[52:55] things is because
[52:56] god reveals them to you and when he
[52:58] began to reveal these things and he
[53:00] began to express these things
[53:01] then we understand why these things take
[53:03] place the way that they do
[53:05] and as they begin to unfold and and we
[53:07] see these things all the way through and
[53:09] you know why because that the life had
[53:10] to go down in the ground
[53:12] and it had to die and it had to abide
[53:14] alone but you know that's the only way
[53:15] that it was going to come back
[53:17] in multiplied form is that it had to go
[53:19] in the ground
[53:20] because the seed had to go into the
[53:22] ground because you know just like just
[53:24] like all the way through the scripture
[53:26] you know justin justin when we see even
[53:28] natural life
[53:29] shows us that it has to go into the
[53:30] ground so it had to
[53:32] it had to go through those things and
[53:33] and you know uh satan thought he really
[53:36] had something going on
[53:37] where he was able to overcome he thought
[53:39] he was overtaking
[53:40] the kingdom of god and he was able to do
[53:42] something just like he thought he could
[53:44] destroy
[53:44] jesus when he went into the went to
[53:47] calvary and died you know he thought he
[53:48] put him in the grave
[53:49] hey you know he thought he was going to
[53:50] destroy the church he thought he thought
[53:52] he was going to get somewhere but he
[53:54] didn't realize that when that life went
[53:55] in there he was fulfilling the word of
[53:57] god
[53:57] and as that life laid there you know you
[54:00] know what he never couldn't destroy all
[54:02] he never could destroy the roots of that
[54:04] tree he never could destroy
[54:05] all of it but he could do it he could
[54:07] destroy the effects of it and so it
[54:09] looked so
[54:10] dark it was so dark but you know what
[54:11] they became liked
[54:13] that it was a day that the light shone
[54:15] and there was a man
[54:16] who had been looking for something and
[54:18] had searched for something
[54:19] and the lord spoke to him and told him
[54:21] he said the just shall live by faith
[54:23] this
[54:24] and so when that light began to shine
[54:26] and he began to see because the glorious
[54:28] light had shot on the word
[54:29] that it began to express and his life
[54:31] became and it started to grow
[54:33] right you know through the through the
[54:35] shoots and the and the stone and the
[54:37] tassel and all that you know it began to
[54:38] grow back
[54:39] and they began to express each one of
[54:41] those messengers began to bring that
[54:43] word
[54:43] back and you know each one of them had
[54:45] they was there was a wonderful
[54:46] expression that took place
[54:48] but you know what each one of those
[54:50] expressions that god ever had
[54:52] they were rejected each one of them was
[54:54] rejected
[54:57] and so you know but as as all those
[55:00] things took place
[55:01] yet god had something greater and had
[55:04] something greater and you know what
[55:06] and it came to our day and you know
[55:09] there was a lot of a lot of things that
[55:11] people had seen all the way down through
[55:12] the history
[55:13] and they they saw all these things that
[55:15] they were all you know
[55:16] people probed at things and and all
[55:18] these things that had been
[55:20] that satan had entered had put in and
[55:23] you know
[55:24] had scrupled things up amen
[55:28] how people don't understand people don't
[55:30] see that there there was a need in our
[55:32] day for a prophet
[55:34] that there had to be somebody to come
[55:36] and take up all these loose sins and all
[55:38] these things
[55:38] that were hidden in the scripture why
[55:42] because because
[55:43] there had to be one that could come like
[55:45] he said the messenger of this day
[55:48] would would he said it came to do two
[55:50] things he said he said to point us back
[55:52] to the faith of the fathers
[55:54] the ones that came and walked with jesus
[55:56] that he preached to
[55:57] and brought them the word to take us
[55:59] right back to that
[56:00] that same the same uh foundation that
[56:03] fame same doctrine
[56:05] that they had was what was to be
[56:06] preached in our day
[56:08] you know everybody thinks that you know
[56:10] uh acts 2 38 baptism
[56:12] and oneness of the godhead and all these
[56:14] things they think well this is
[56:16] some kind of new things no it's as old
[56:18] as christianity
[56:19] the problem is is people have gotten so
[56:21] blind and and
[56:22] because satan has sown so much so much
[56:25] seed
[56:26] that's in there that has polluted
[56:28] everything that people don't even
[56:29] realize what's truth
[56:30] but you know the thing is it doesn't
[56:32] matter if you're a child of god it
[56:34] doesn't matter how much
[56:36] how much the devil comes in how much
[56:39] forces he brings how much
[56:40] how much everything he tries to sow
[56:43] seeds of discrepancy or whatever
[56:45] it doesn't matter what he does he cannot
[56:47] take away the light from a child of god
[56:49] if you're ordained of a light then guess
[56:51] what then the light will shine on you
[56:54] he will bring you the word it doesn't
[56:56] matter where you're at no matter how far
[56:58] away you get from god
[56:59] people think that you think you're a
[57:00] million miles away from god well that's
[57:02] what
[57:03] god knows where you are and god knows
[57:05] where to bring the word to you right
[57:06] where you're at
[57:08] amen and you know the thing is if you're
[57:10] if you're a child of god
[57:11] and you're you're ordained and god
[57:14] predestinated you to this then you know
[57:15] what
[57:16] then then you are going to come to it
[57:19] hey you know what but you understand
[57:20] that there's there's many people in the
[57:22] world
[57:22] that have been for ordained to
[57:24] condemnation they're not they're not
[57:26] ever going to come to the
[57:27] to the realization of this because you
[57:29] know what god can speak to them and show
[57:32] them
[57:32] and try to speak to them but you know
[57:33] what they will always turn the word down
[57:36] why because that that is that is their
[57:38] desire that they have made
[57:39] and they'll and you can speak to them
[57:41] because no matter you can give them a
[57:42] million years and they'll never accept
[57:44] it
[57:45] but you know what a child of god it
[57:47] doesn't matter
[57:48] you know no matter what how dark the
[57:50] storm is or
[57:51] all the conditions whatever when the
[57:54] light shines on them
[57:55] they will see it
[58:02] and we see that so in our day there was
[58:04] a prophet that had to come
[58:06] sure third day we had to receive a
[58:10] prophet
[58:13] you know a lot of people say you know
[58:14] he's uh i don't under i don't understand
[58:16] why
[58:16] why why why people believe that that we
[58:19] have to have a prophet we were given the
[58:20] scripture
[58:21] we have all the bible god sent sent
[58:23] prophets and he sent
[58:24] scribes and he sent all the apostles and
[58:26] everything and he gave us the word
[58:28] here's all the word right here
[58:29] so why we don't we don't need prophets
[58:31] because we have the bible
[58:34] and like i told them i said well the
[58:35] thing is that when you go back
[58:37] god gave moses the law
[58:40] which was the bible in their day he
[58:42] fulfilled all that everything that they
[58:44] had needed was given to him in the law
[58:45] but you know what he still sent him
[58:47] prophets why because the prophets were
[58:49] said to send a
[58:50] look upon him right back to what the law
[58:52] said
[58:54] and so you know why do we have why do we
[58:56] have to have a prophet in our day
[58:57] why because he pointed us right back to
[58:59] what the scripture said
[59:00] why because you can read and read and
[59:02] read and read just like brother branham
[59:04] said
[59:04] it takes more than just reading and
[59:06] study word for word and line by line
[59:08] but it takes the life of god it takes a
[59:11] supernatural
[59:12] insight it takes a supernatural insight
[59:15] from god for you to say the word
[59:17] it takes it takes so it takes more than
[59:19] just our human ability because we'll
[59:22] never figure it out
[59:23] we'll never be able to see it but it
[59:25] takes god who sent one
[59:26] who was ordained to show us these things
[59:30] you know that people you know you know
[59:33] they they spent all their time trying to
[59:35] tear down
[59:36] the the prophet and they try to tear
[59:38] down what god does well you know what
[59:39] it just the more more things take place
[59:42] the more i
[59:43] realize that it is the fulfillment of
[59:45] god's word
[59:46] there wasn't there's never been a
[59:48] prophet that's ever come that brought
[59:50] the word that wasn't rejected
[59:52] there wasn't one that's never been
[59:54] ridiculed
[59:55] right that's been turned out and you
[59:57] know what and so if it was same thing as
[59:59] it was then if they'd done that to
[1:00:01] jesus he said if they've done it to the
[1:00:03] master of the house what will they say
[1:00:05] to you
[1:00:05] what will they say about you so they've
[1:00:07] done exactly the same thing to brother
[1:00:09] branham but he came to bring us the word
[1:00:11] to bring us to the place that we need to
[1:00:13] be that we can see who we are but you
[1:00:15] know what we're going
[1:00:16] that he was rejected jesus was rejected
[1:00:18] and you and i will be rejected
[1:00:21] this this brother brown said that the
[1:00:23] world will not have us
[1:00:24] the world will be we'll be despised and
[1:00:26] rejected just like jesus was
[1:00:30] but you know what he said he said we
[1:00:31] were given the ability
[1:00:34] god gave us the word that we were the
[1:00:38] to be the word made manifest in our day
[1:00:42] just as jesus was made manifest why
[1:00:44] because it was prophesied
[1:00:46] that there would be a bride in the last
[1:00:48] days there would be one that would come
[1:00:50] and everybody wants to look back just as
[1:00:52] revelation 10 said
[1:00:54] you know there would be a days of the
[1:00:55] voice that when he began to sound
[1:00:57] but who is going to hear the sound if he
[1:01:00] was going to begin to speak
[1:01:01] and to open those mysteries and somebody
[1:01:03] had to be there to hear it
[1:01:05] amen and just as just as john stood
[1:01:07] there
[1:01:08] and you know the angel was standing
[1:01:09] there with the open book and he stood
[1:01:11] there
[1:01:11] and he said he said you must eat this
[1:01:13] book and he said
[1:01:15] so go and take it he said well give me
[1:01:16] the book and he began to
[1:01:18] and so john took the book a type of the
[1:01:21] bride ate the book
[1:01:22] and he said then you must prophesy again
[1:01:24] so you know that's the thing we must eat
[1:01:26] the word
[1:01:27] we must take the word and we're going to
[1:01:29] be rejected
[1:01:30] but you know what we're to eat the word
[1:01:32] to be manifested
[1:01:34] to manifest the word and he said he said
[1:01:36] through the shed blood through
[1:01:38] through the operation of all these
[1:01:40] things that god has done in our day
[1:01:42] all the things that take place the
[1:01:45] prophecies that has
[1:01:46] taken place in our day he's he's given
[1:01:49] us the grace
[1:01:51] he give us the grace to take this word
[1:01:53] and make it manifest
[1:01:55] that we can be born of his bone and
[1:01:57] flesh of his flesh
[1:01:59] and life of his life that we can be the
[1:02:01] word expressed
[1:02:03] and brother branham said in in the in
[1:02:05] the church age book he said you know
[1:02:07] a life lived by the word it would be the
[1:02:09] word expressed
[1:02:12] and so that's the way it is so and all
[1:02:16] these things that have taken place
[1:02:17] yet in our day we we have been the ones
[1:02:19] that have been come
[1:02:22] to fulfill this word brother branham
[1:02:25] said
[1:02:25] speaking of here in the in the
[1:02:27] masterpiece
[1:02:29] he said he said the word living and in
[1:02:32] action
[1:02:33] the bible bride not some man-made bride
[1:02:35] the bible bride smitten and afflicted of
[1:02:38] god
[1:02:39] no beauty we should desire her but yet
[1:02:42] we did esteem her smitten and afflicted
[1:02:44] of god that's right
[1:02:45] she stands alone she is smitten from all
[1:02:48] the denominations according to
[1:02:50] revelation 3 she is smitten out of the
[1:02:52] laodicean church age
[1:02:53] she was raised up in it she was raised
[1:02:56] up in
[1:02:58] see the church was raised up in the lao
[1:02:59] to see in church age that's the husk
[1:03:01] but if them other ones went he said
[1:03:04] can't you pentecostal men see that if
[1:03:07] that
[1:03:08] other was husk and died then the other
[1:03:10] the stalk had to die
[1:03:12] if the tassel had to die so must the
[1:03:14] husk die
[1:03:16] the three stages of organization
[1:03:20] they begin to talk about see it's just
[1:03:23] the same as
[1:03:24] methodist and baptist and presbyterian
[1:03:25] and all those he said see
[1:03:27] she stands alone like the bridegroom
[1:03:29] rejected a man despised and rejected of
[1:03:31] the churches the bride stands that way
[1:03:34] what is it see it's his masterpiece see
[1:03:36] it's the word
[1:03:37] that he can work through make manifest
[1:03:40] rejecting
[1:03:42] right he said now at the harvest time
[1:03:45] the seed is back to its original life
[1:03:46] back to the bible
[1:03:48] malachi 4 said would be brought brought
[1:03:51] that way
[1:03:53] must have it all to be this way it must
[1:03:55] be all of the word
[1:04:00] and brother bram says here in the
[1:04:01] ephesian church age
[1:04:06] he said god's intention for his creation
[1:04:10] man was to express
[1:04:11] his words in genesis adam was given the
[1:04:14] word to live by
[1:04:15] a life lived by the word would be the
[1:04:17] word expressed
[1:04:19] is it true or not but did adam live by
[1:04:22] the word no
[1:04:23] because he was because he was to live by
[1:04:26] every word and he failed to take heed to
[1:04:27] every word
[1:04:28] then rose moses and the great men they
[1:04:31] all failed to live
[1:04:33] by every word that the prophet the great
[1:04:35] type of the great prophet to come
[1:04:37] fell in anger to obey the word and there
[1:04:39] was david the great king of israel a man
[1:04:41] after god's own heart he felt by
[1:04:43] adultery
[1:04:43] when he was tempted but eventually in
[1:04:45] the in the fullness of time there
[1:04:47] came one the head even jesus who also
[1:04:50] must be
[1:04:50] tempted to see if he would live by every
[1:04:53] word
[1:04:54] that proceeded out of the mouth of god
[1:04:56] then was satan fooled
[1:04:57] for here there was one who lived by it
[1:05:01] it is written and that masterpiece of
[1:05:03] god overcame
[1:05:05] by reflecting god's word then
[1:05:08] was this manifested perfect one given to
[1:05:10] the cross
[1:05:11] as the perfect lamb of god for the
[1:05:14] perfect sacrifice and on the tree
[1:05:16] he received the wounds unto death that
[1:05:18] we by him
[1:05:20] and because of him might eat of the tree
[1:05:22] of life
[1:05:23] and then that life freely given would
[1:05:26] enable us to overcome
[1:05:28] and express the word of god amen
[1:05:32] so let's let's all stand this evening
[1:05:38] and all the things that went through yet
[1:05:41] he
[1:05:42] has enabled us to overcome
[1:05:45] that how do you overcome
[1:05:49] by the word
[1:05:52] what he say to overcome is the
[1:05:55] recognized devil in all of his tactics
[1:05:58] heidi oh how do you see the devil in all
[1:06:00] of his tactics
[1:06:01] yo yo come on how do you see the devil
[1:06:04] in all of his tactics by the word
[1:06:07] the word reveals it to you to show you
[1:06:10] all the things that the devil does
[1:06:12] so when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:06:15] he said he'll raise up a standard
[1:06:17] against
[1:06:19] so we we understand that all the way
[1:06:21] through the scripture
[1:06:24] you know i as as that song
[1:06:27] i i don't know the i i only think of one
[1:06:30] line of it it says
[1:06:31] i'll take the way what the lord despised
[1:06:33] few but you know
[1:06:35] uh i'm going through i think i'll
[1:06:36] believe the song i'm going through i'm
[1:06:38] going through
[1:06:39] but just what i was thinking about you
[1:06:40] know i'll take the way what the lord's
[1:06:42] despised you why because each one of
[1:06:44] them was rejected right
[1:06:47] all of them walked walked in the way of
[1:06:49] the word of god and they walked in the
[1:06:50] way of god you know what they were
[1:06:51] rejected
[1:06:53] and you know what you and i will be the
[1:06:54] same way despised and rejected
[1:06:57] but i want to walk just like jesus why
[1:06:59] because
[1:07:00] that's because if you're if you're the
[1:07:02] life made manifest then you know what
[1:07:04] all the things that he went through all
[1:07:05] the things that he manifested you will
[1:07:07] too
[1:07:09] you'll see because if if if he has the
[1:07:12] life
[1:07:12] in you if it's god's life it's the life
[1:07:15] of jesus christ in you then you know
[1:07:16] when people say well i don't know i
[1:07:18] don't know if i can do that or not
[1:07:19] well you know what it you know i i tell
[1:07:22] i tell everybody i've always told
[1:07:24] everybody my entire life
[1:07:26] most most most of you or some of you
[1:07:28] have seen my dad most of you knew my dad
[1:07:30] you know i you know i didn't i didn't
[1:07:32] have to go look in a mirror
[1:07:35] to try to be dale roberts
[1:07:39] ever since i was big enough to know
[1:07:40] anything i've always had people tell me
[1:07:43] you're dale roberts is boy i didn't have
[1:07:46] i didn't have to do nothing but all i
[1:07:48] had to do was people people could see
[1:07:50] when they saw me they saw g uh they saw
[1:07:52] dale roberts
[1:07:54] they saw they saw daddy and me and you
[1:07:56] know it wasn't something i had to go
[1:07:57] stand in the mirror and practice
[1:08:00] i don't know about y'all sometimes i get
[1:08:02] up in the middle of the night go to the
[1:08:03] bathroom and i see daddy in the mirror
[1:08:06] i take a double take like holes
[1:08:10] and even you know even now as i get
[1:08:11] older people say you know look
[1:08:13] there he looks so much like dale he
[1:08:14] looks so much like that well it wasn't
[1:08:16] something i had to do one because it was
[1:08:18] the life that's in me
[1:08:20] one because i'm a son of dale roberts so
[1:08:22] everything that i do
[1:08:24] i just i look like him i have mannerisms
[1:08:26] i sound like him in some ways
[1:08:29] but it was a you know so if the life we
[1:08:30] have the life of god then you know what
[1:08:32] it's not a struggle
[1:08:34] lots of times the struggle is we get in
[1:08:37] the way
[1:08:38] we get in our own way because you know
[1:08:40] what the life is there if we allow the
[1:08:42] life to
[1:08:42] the the life of god to manifest it you
[1:08:44] know what then it's just like brother
[1:08:46] ram said he said the christian life is
[1:08:48] just as easy to live as any other kind
[1:08:50] of life
[1:08:50] one because it's easier if we just yield
[1:08:52] ourselves to him
[1:08:53] then he can maybe be man benefits he
[1:08:56] said the works that i do shall you do
[1:08:58] also
[1:09:01] well i don't know if i don't know if i
[1:09:02] can do that or not well you know what
[1:09:04] that's what the bible said you could do
[1:09:07] you can overcome why because you've
[1:09:09] already because he's overcome
[1:09:11] because if he's overcome then you'll
[1:09:13] overcome one because he's made the way
[1:09:15] for you amen glory hey so the same
[1:09:18] things
[1:09:18] so if you if you have children that are
[1:09:20] lost then you know what he's
[1:09:22] he's the savior well then you know what
[1:09:23] you're a child of the savior that you
[1:09:25] can claim your children
[1:09:26] you can claim your children you can
[1:09:28] claim whether or not
[1:09:29] you have money in the bank account or
[1:09:31] all your bills paid he said because he
[1:09:33] said
[1:09:34] my god shall supply all your needs
[1:09:36] according to his riches and glory
[1:09:39] he didn't he didn't stutter on that and
[1:09:41] he was not an indian giver he didn't
[1:09:43] make a statement and then just try to
[1:09:45] back it up
[1:09:47] because he will back it up he didn't he
[1:09:48] didn't he wasn't stuttering and he
[1:09:50] didn't get confused on what he said
[1:09:52] right so no matter what the devil brings
[1:09:54] your way and say
[1:09:55] you can't receive the holy ghost then
[1:09:57] you know what he's a liar
[1:09:59] because if the devil comes and says you
[1:10:01] can't overcome then you know what
[1:10:03] he's lying amen
[1:10:06] you can't you can't get healed you can't
[1:10:07] get delivered you can't get an answer
[1:10:09] from god well then you know what
[1:10:10] hey you don't know he because if he's
[1:10:13] talking to you he's lying
[1:10:18] so if he's if he's speaking you know
[1:10:19] what then he's that he's a liar and then
[1:10:21] we don't well you know what god's gonna
[1:10:22] speak to us
[1:10:24] and you just stay there and you wait and
[1:10:25] see if god don't speak to you right
[1:10:28] all right we get we get in our own way
[1:10:31] and we're just like daniel
[1:10:32] daniel stood there was trying to pray
[1:10:34] for to get an answer from god well you
[1:10:36] know what it took three
[1:10:37] weeks when gabriel came and told him he
[1:10:41] said he said we fought
[1:10:42] the prince of the power of ariel prince
[1:10:44] of persia he said he said we battled him
[1:10:46] for 21 days
[1:10:50] he said hey but he said he said but
[1:10:51] michael came and overcome him he said so
[1:10:54] that i could come and speak to you
[1:10:57] well you know if that was if that's what
[1:10:58] he had to do then you know what he's
[1:11:00] still going to come and speak to you
[1:11:02] well you just hold on no matter how long
[1:11:04] it how dark it gets
[1:11:06] know how how lonely it gets know how how
[1:11:08] much depression comes in no matter what
[1:11:10] it is
[1:11:11] you stay right there and god's going to
[1:11:12] bring you an answer
[1:11:14] why because you keep you stand there
[1:11:16] because god is obligated to his word
[1:11:18] he's not obligated to me he's not
[1:11:20] obligated to you but he is obligated to
[1:11:22] his word
[1:11:23] and believe me something brothers
[1:11:25] sisters if we're born of the word then
[1:11:27] the word that you and i have inside of
[1:11:29] us he's obligated to that
[1:11:31] he's obligated to his word
[1:11:34] we're the children of the word and he's
[1:11:36] obligated to that
[1:11:39] praise the lord word don't have to back
[1:11:40] up we don't have to slack up we don't
[1:11:42] have to deal with anybody
[1:11:43] because we're going to stand on the word
[1:11:45] of god and then he said he said we
[1:11:47] we don't know if we have an answer or
[1:11:48] not he said don't you worry and the day
[1:11:50] that you need an answer he'll give you
[1:11:52] the answer
[1:11:54] he said he just said i'll put the words
[1:11:56] in your mouth that you need to answer
[1:11:59] to close the mouth of the critics
[1:12:05] see the thing is we need to have
[1:12:07] boldness
[1:12:11] why because each one of the he's one of
[1:12:13] those prophets had boldness they didn't
[1:12:14] they just walked in what they what they
[1:12:16] saw and what god had given them to speak
[1:12:20] amen that's right
[1:12:22] well then we don't have to we don't have
[1:12:24] to be afraid we don't have to be scared
[1:12:28] we don't have to be depressed we don't
[1:12:29] have to be lonely we don't have to be
[1:12:30] discouraged
[1:12:33] we don't have to be sad
[1:12:37] hey brother matthew always says he said
[1:12:40] i'm too anointed to be disappointed
[1:12:44] he said he said i'm too blessed to be
[1:12:46] stressed he said i'm too glad to
[1:12:47] be sad
[1:12:50] he said i'm too high to sign cry
[1:12:54] why because god has given us a position
[1:12:57] amen
[1:12:59] why because god god had grace to us to
[1:13:02] bring us and we've seen the fulfillment
[1:13:04] of the word amen amen the word
[1:13:07] because god give us a prophet in our
[1:13:09] days
[1:13:12] and so you know you know
[1:13:15] i could stand on what he said all right
[1:13:18] that's it and and because
[1:13:21] when when eleazar came and i'm gonna
[1:13:23] stop here in a minute i promise
[1:13:26] when eliezer came and began to speak to
[1:13:28] rebecca
[1:13:31] you know it wasn't that hey that she was
[1:13:34] drawn to eleazar
[1:13:36] because the word that eliezer began to
[1:13:38] speak to rebecca
[1:13:40] she was longing to see isaac
[1:13:44] but you know he preached it so much
[1:13:47] he preached that so much to her that
[1:13:50] when she saw him in the field in the
[1:13:51] distance
[1:13:52] she slid off that camel to go run and
[1:13:54] meet him because she saw him
[1:13:56] amen a man she had never seen before but
[1:13:59] yet she recognized him
[1:14:01] right how will i know him
[1:14:05] by the word glory
[1:14:08] what did fanny crosby say she was blind
[1:14:11] all of her life she said but i'll know
[1:14:13] him
[1:14:15] she said i don't know him by the prince
[1:14:17] the prince of the nails in his hand
[1:14:21] why because there was a way even even in
[1:14:22] her blindness
[1:14:24] god was real to her and had made a way
[1:14:26] that she would know
[1:14:30] he's opened our eyes to see
[1:14:34] i want i want to see him more today
[1:14:38] than i ever have before i want to say
[1:14:41] more
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:45] i think i thank god for what he's what
[1:14:47] he's given us
[1:14:52] let's sing something i'm going to stop
