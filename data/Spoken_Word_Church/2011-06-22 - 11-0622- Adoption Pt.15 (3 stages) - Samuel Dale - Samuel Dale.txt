the third of July will be our 40th anniversary here in the church which will actually be on the fourth which is on Monday but we can't handle it that away so we'll just do it with with the third and and it'll be all right I remember that remember brother Reed will be brother Keith Reed will be here preaching for us um for the weekend so just keep those in mind looking forward to a good time in the Lord and a good time to celebrate 40 years you know and maybe we've made our journey into around the mountain you know round and around for 40 years they went around and around and then they finally got started the other way so maybe we've made our journey round and around and we can get on where to do it but just remember all of these that are sick among us and I just pray to the Lord to bless Sister Barbara there got shingles and brother dick was taking some medication and it really messed him up so just remember all of these the sick ones Among Us Brother Gary and uh he's doing great he's able to be up and around he was maybe don't come to church tonight when I talked to him yesterday but I guess he didn't feel like it but they'll probably all be watching on the internet so we say hi to each one of you out there on the on the internet waves and things uh that the Lord will bless all right Ephesians 1 and Romans eight now we won't be having a we won't be having our Bible study on the first Saturday so we would just kind of probably I guess count that as the Bible study for this time or do you want to move over and have the bible study on the second Saturday what about it anybody you want it to Second Saturday because we won't be having the first Saturday because we'll be here we're really key free okay all right so everybody wanted to be all right with everybody amen for the yes okay all right yeah that'd be fine so it'll be on the second Saturday of July this this time okay uh six o'clock amen father we thank you for your loving your grace unto us and we thank you for all things and we ask you to just help us and guide us and lead us by that understanding that we may Lord just walk in the light of Your Love forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and we ask you to bless each one remember the sick among us there's many many sicknesses and things and you said in your word that you sent your word and healed it healed us and delivered us from destruction so father we ask you to just make it manifest and those are out there watching tonight because of not being able to come because of the sickness we ask you to bless them and just be with each one the same as it would be here we love you and we thank you and just have your way keep us because that's what we desire for you to do in Jesus name amen been in the seasons for a while but we haven't worn it out yet so Ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved now let's go over to Romans where we want to read Romans hey but we want to read verse 5 through 11. that's Romans 8 verse 5 through 11. for they utter after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they interact the spirit the things of the spirit to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded his life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit now watch he's asking the question the it's not saying everybody another way it see it's putting a point is dark but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you see now there's the condition now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and they deceive that the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I know I have a whole lot of of popes up here tonight and uh we may read some of it may not but if not you will have it to worry that you can can uh at least see what we're trying to cover but we've got over into the message and I want to make sure and cover this tonight that we will know what you know is what I'm trying to get to of the adoption and the things and uh it's coming down to a place until I believe that we are in the last days and the finishing up now how long that'll be that's no problem with any of us I was talking to brother Carol the other day and I think he's 80 something about 83 or something like that and he said that somebody said well you know the Rapture I believe he's coming pretty quick he said well at my age it ain't going to make much difference he said because I'm going one way pretty quick you know the age we're getting so uh you know that's a good point but I want to be here for the change and and all like that I wanted to see it but now I was trying to bring a point to you and I want to make sure you understand it see things don't happen just by chance you know God's everything is pre-programmed and you remember how that back up a few months ago that we were talking about how that the uh it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God but the word our seed and we talked about a word or d word or seed for each age all right so there is a word for each age and time all right so then we have the finishing up of all of the word in this day and that is the word for our day and our time we have the greatest of all uh things looking forward to and appreciating what God has already given us but I was trying to to bring a point to you and I want to keep that point in mind tonight that hey in each age I was looking at these the other day you know in the studying on it and in each age has been a Divine Healing campaign to follow the message of that age all right now I'm quoting wrote a random each age had a healing campaign to go out all right but this age was very special because you know when Azusa Street took place there in 1906 . see there was things following that which was the movement of God and all like that and and things were taking place but then as it began to die down a little bit then you see that that you know a a healing campaign started around the world this one would be a worldwide thing not just you know a partial it would be a great thing happening and you know people don't realize what took place back there when the prophet of God began to to bring forth in the the Divine Healing Ministry right you know and he began to to speak on those things and I wanted I made some statements about it and I want you to to fully understand what I'm getting at it and uh see then in this day this time they were to be a healing campaign let's go back and read from Malachi and just just read Malachi 4 and you'll see what it's saying because see we look at Malachi 4 A lot of times it's only the message that would be coming forth you know and then being careful we'll drop over to to the last days of brother Reynolds Ministry and and start off from there but I want you to see something from this and to read Malachi 4 I want us to follow one point see that there was a it was a promise in God's word all right now each age they get the point each age had a word or seed and it was promised for that age all right now so then in in the age coming that we're in see if there was a healing campaign started all right to fulfill the scriptures right all right and that will go all the way yeah me that will go all the way to the Millennium right with the the scriptures that we're going to read and and that way we can follow that point but the main thing I want you to see is that this healing campaign it had more to do with it than just Divine Healing right amen see it it meant a whole lot more than just the Divine Healing but the Divine Healing is like brother Bosphorus would always say said brother Branham said the the healing and the thing said that's just bait on the hook and that's why I believe that brother Branham started out in his early Ministry and you remember that he used to he would house somebody to preach for him I sure did all right and then he would just come out and pray for the sick what well then he stopped that and he started preaching the message and then he would you know the the prayer for the sick would take place which put a double burden on him but it was to you know I wouldn't want to follow a trinitarian out to to preach on Divine Healing you know because he would be lining me up in the wrong direction you know and I wouldn't want that understanding so I just believe that brother random just saw it you know because you'll see in a minute then he knew that they would be a message come I mean amen he knew the Divine Healing if if there was to be a Divine Healing campaign that was only to get the attention for the people now I'm show you a lot of quotes on that but it shouldn't be needed you were to understand that that healing campaigned it you know it was there and even to the writers that credit brother random and Oral Roberts as to be the the major ones or the Divine Healing campaign all right but you better remember one thing or Roberts came out from Brother Brown so you remember he was the first one going forth you know with the the healing campaign in this we read the things in a minute watch the little key things that he'll say sometimes as to uh expressing a thought but let's let's read Malachi here as we're at it we'll go over about to now let's just read start off verse one Malachi 4 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yeah and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root in a branch now you remember brother said I said uh that's gonna that proves that there is no eternal hell because it's going to burn up and all right but now start in verse two but unto you yeah I put a big old circle around mine that's me all right but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as caves of the stall all right now so then the promise is to you all right the son of righteousness will rise with healings in his wings now I've got the quotes in here we come on down in a little bit that that goes all the way to the Millennium right so this didn't just start as I said run around didn't come out just preaching and see he knew something was going to take place all right and he knew that there would be a message followed after this healing campaign all right see because it would be the son of righteousness right arising with healings Indian wings and if you'll run into your computer just run in Son of righteousness you'll find it as very little relating to actually just stopping on the Divine Healing point right it will carry all the way into the millennial Reign this son of righteousness will rise but it started there right that's my point I want you to see that something started back there right in the Divine Healing that has more to do with us than just a healing campaign they had those after following each message that would go forth they would be healings and signs and wonders but in this one it had a very special meaning because it was going to be the last tweeting unto the coming of the Lord of a healing campaign right all right and that's why things are not going now like everybody thinks we're to be doing this be doing that if we've got this you know we don't have nothing because we could produce this that the other we're not in the days of the healing campaign but it didn't stop with brother Branham when he went to the Grave amen we can still believe and we still see signs and wonders and we thank God for those things but not a worldwide sweeping that's right they're having more more uh uh healing campaigns out in the the denominational world right today that is taking place among the people of the message as far as a campaign for healing you don't hear of anybody announced we're going to have a healing campaign right they're going to have a preaching campaign they're going to have Holy Ghost Campaign or something they don't mention having a Divine human see because that was where when it was come there with the prophet it would not stop until the millenniums all right so now now get that point see that the son of righteousness will rise with healings in his wings right all right but it don't stop with just healings in his wings as a healing campaign you see it goes on it says and conjunction and ye see shall go forth and grow up as caves of the stall you the reason that's there the prophet is illustrating what you feed calves or the Stalls stored up food right right you know you don't they don't eat grass out in the pasture they're staying a stall you're feeding as we call it in the southern form of of doing you call it feeding it out in other words it's been out eating up on things and then you put it in there and you begin to feed it feed to to uh cleanse the body from a lot of the toxics of the the grass the things that was there and you're you're fattening them up and getting everything ready to tenderize the meat you know right in case anybody didn't know what all that's about about see you know but see it's not just a healing campaign right this healing campaign has to flow over into so you read Malachi 4 you know you you got the son of righteousness rise wasn't healing in his wings oh see so that doesn't stop now it'll go all the way to the Millennium right right oh they're showing a ratchetness right when healing in his wings because see over to that point things are going to be taking place all right now but then see there's to be a message followed because it says ye shall grow up all right now so get those two together tonight or what what we're talking about amen but we're talking about laying a foundation or God preparing uh a way that he could bring it into a uh uh bring in the word okay you said what they can do is sweep down and just do this well that's that's true and that's the way he pretty well done it in the ages but in this age he sends forth a healing campaign and the whole world begins to go through a point in the 40s and 50s and on up into the to the early 60s of people like Oral Roberts and all of them going forth with with great things happening not just brother Branham it was a healing campaign to strike the world but run around and said I knew all alone that there was a message to come amen if they're going to be Divine Healing there's got to be a message following that amen and it's not just the message of Divine Healing you get it it's not just a message that we're healing we're healing healing healing having a healing campaign all right that's wonderful thank God but there would be a message so Malachi shows you that now all right so go in your notes now and you'll have to scramble through to find it because it's actually the last page 29 30 31 and I just added these to it and left them on there where I could pull them out real quick so let's look and see what your Prophet had to say look at number 29 on your note star where it says God's provided way preach the 1959 415 and the a all right he's talking about uh invitations Givens and different things taking place and and all and he's talking about the lame she'll walk and the certain things you know the signs and the Wonders now look the last calling and the last invitation was a great time to sweep across the country in Divine Healing that was the last and we're winding up the end of that just pulling in the Loose Ends right now so how close is the coming of the Lord then he goes on to covering telling you how the Divine Healing is only the bait on the hook see in other words Divine Healing campaign was to bring in the sick and brother random you've heard him many times even say how dare you come up here and asking God to heal you of this sickness when you're standing there with sin in your life me see the the healing campaign was to get the people to come and they came by the millions see yep and some saw God I will read it after a while it's to prove that God's among you that's what healing is for healing is to prove God is among you all right amen and and that's what took place back there right because that would just debate on the hook all right but now remember you you don't put the bait on the hook and cast it out and then you draw it back in that's just a bait on the hook you know we'll drop back in we take the bait off throw the hook back out now you you don't do that right Duty you got to leave the bait on the hook all right just don't do that all right reason I'm saying that is is people just say well you put it on the one thing yeah see you don't you don't major on a minor but there's one thing about it a minor is a minor but you don't do away with a minor neither do you do away with the bait on the hook right right you turn around a lot of times reuse to catch more fish right with the same bait all right so now going down now while we're at it look at modern events made clear by prophecy 1965 1206 uh paragraph 37. now remember this message started first with Divine Healing now this should not be 65 now hey watch what are you saying man now remember this message started first with Divine Healing performing miracles and if God let that go through and a ordinary Church look just like we already had then it wasn't God if he let it go through it just wouldn't God now remember honestly I didn't get to bring this quote but it'll be glad to find it for you brother Brown says that even though you would have a healing campaign or healings and signs and wonders take place he said if it stays with the same old message man he said don't believe it even though there would be signs and wonders so if somebody comes along today with signs and wonders see and still staying with some old denominational message or some Two Souls seven Thunder virtual peruses the river Jordan's Etc in the message right the even though it would come and healing would follow it you're not going to the word of God because each of the healings especially this healing campaign would be the beginning of something that would take all the way to the change of the body right so it can't be different so do you understand what he's saying and remember this message started first with Divine Healing performing Miracles and if God let that grow go through a ordinary church just like we already had then it wasn't God right now watch it God don't have to show off he he don't he don't have to do these things to entertain us like we Americans are used to entertainment but he does it to the to attract the attention of the people that he's fixing to do something that's right right he's fixing to do something all right watch it now leadership 1965 1207 that was 1206 and it's 1207. and any message that comes in a genuine born message of God is different from the old trend I want you when a Divine Healing went forth not long ago did you notice how the impersonators followed it see and every one of them went right in them organizations staying there does anyone know that there had to be a message this one follow that and we're to follow the healing all right why God don't entertain us he attracts our attention with something and when he attracts our attention then he's got the message all right so now you see what I was trying to bring out is when Azusa Street came forward that was a move of God yes sir I believe that the Holy Ghost came himself the prophet said 464 of the seal book amen and as he did then Azusa Street began to dwindled back down a little and as it did then the the Oneness people begin to come forth and and started a move of God and and see that didn't progress too far other than bringing back to the church things that had been lost of the truth of one God and things and you know and sure they run it into a Oneness form but still then here comes the prophet about 1933 see and God coming down to vindicate and show that your message will forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ all right but he didn't just go right out then that's right amen it would be 30 something years later before his message would come forth right you know so we're about 63 we're the real message of the Prophet would come but it would be restoring back the understanding of the word of God and to do that to get the attention of the people God sends a healing campaign go ahead so you think you you don't be careful though don't just drop off and say we don't need that anymore right I made myself clear that we'll read to it a minute the prophet says this son of righteousness right when he lives we will go all the way to the Millennium all right until these bodies are changed we need healing amen that's right because that is the ultimate of all healing is the change of the body right that's right all right but see we've got to walk into it in the way that that God wants us to walk right yeah and see we can't go out ahead but we need can we lag behind so there had to be a healing campaign sweep out right to get the attention to the people to come to hear the message but more what's happening than beside this getting the people's attention right that's my will I want to get your attention tonight right I want to make sure you understand what I'm trying to say right see that healing campaign meant more than ever because brother random said that and where you've got them in your hand no Divine Healing no Resurrection that's right amen right he said Divine Healing is the earnest yes amen amen there's a few quotes in there in a minute we'll get to that are real astounding that the prophet would make on these things because he covers if there's no Divine Healing then there is no heaven to go to oh we're gonna get us a new body well we don't need healing anymore then just quit going to the doctors quit taking your medicine and just stop he said that's me himself no it's not being serious it's telling his truth if we don't believe in this body to be able to be redeemed what are we trying to take care of the sucker for all right you see it it just don't pan out right when people try to make their statements and do their things but do you understand what I'm saying in embarrassed where I'm gonna when that started with a healing campaign Dyers were the son of righteousness begin to rise we're healing in his wings because he begins and so we're trying to get the point to him he began to show that there is a possibility of these bodies being changed now that was what was taking place back there amen you say well why we have to do that because all the world was looking to get a new body just like the people in this Mansion you're still looking forward that's right real popular people out on the field don't get a new body and then you hear other people say I'm gonna get me a new body and you don't know what they're talking about yeah because a lot of them goes about and preaches in different places that you know you can say new body and for one group of people it means getting in your body don't need this no more the other side what does he saying oh yeah he's saying this body made new well I like to let you know what I'm talking about why can't we just say this body made new instead of saying we're going to get a new body see when we say we're going to get a new body can put us in a category to fit anywhere they just float with the people and if people get happy about getting a new body we just preach about that one you ain't watch preachers do that they'll pull all this away well they'll pull over this wet wild and it's all right you know but listen the key to understand all things is one fact Jesus raised with nail prints in his hand now did he rage in a natural body rdd erasing it glorified buddy was he still just natural when he raised because you better check your Bible because he raised up and appeared to married and then went up and then came back and then showed his hands in his sides right so you better get the story right of course I didn't go to change nobody but maybe he'll change us here and maybe somebody out there that's hungry enough to listen we'll we'll feed off of that and understand and somebody comes along we bless God we gonna give us a new body brother so-and-so said so I don't give a who what brother so-and-so said that's right what did the Bible say what does the prophet say well I got folks where the Prophet said we're going to give us a new body yes sir and I got plenty of them where he says the resurrection is not replacement right that's right so now you're making your profit a false prophet because you're saying he's teaching one thing one way and another thing another way now I don't believe that is this body made you amen all right now she did it in that point that's the key to it to understand that we don't get a new body right right we get this body redeemed am I now in doing that then I've asked you to read the future home things are ought to be and some of the messages are after the the opening of the you know the seals and the things where the Prophet bringing it down but especially like future home I'm not going to get on that tonight now I'm not going to get on the Redemption of the body that will be on over into Sunday I hope if I get there all right but I want you to hold the point women tonight to see the importance of understanding a simple little thing that we don't get a new body right we get this body redeemed right amen of course they explained it I heard one brother he's explaining it boy he brought it all down and this whole thing here is not worth nothing and he dropped it down and we just walk out on our own bodies into the Millennium in some kind of a glorified theophany form of a body and then in the future home we finally catch back up with it well I don't understand that huh I couldn't understand him I'm not making fun of him that's his business he's saying what he believes yeah I still they say that I'd rather listen to him than most people because most people won't tell you what you believe that's right right most people are just going to leave you in limbo and like I said they'll say I believe in a new body and then they wait to see what you're going to do and then if you don't go this way to go that way yeah you know you watch preachers and they'll do that a lot okay yeah maybe not I shouldn't have said that about preachers but you know it's true that's right but listen I don't have none of that flowing to try to get you to believe this way and then try to get I just got one thing you either gonna believe what I'm saying or forget it yeah I mean I don't have no two sides to me right I've never been that way I've always been one all right so let's read a couple of things that brother Branham had to say about the healing campaigns and the you know of the things that was taking place but I hope you followed my point I'm saying something to you that is a whole lot more valuable than you think now I'm saying something not undercover I'm saying it as the way I want it said exactly to be brought out see we we are if we're not careful we will be looking for something to take place when it's already taking place now brother Randall said one day he said see there said see where the moon will turn to blood he said I can show you where that's already took place well I can't because I can't find where he told me what that was me but he said he knew that it already took place well see we're all still looking for the moon to turn to blood when he said it's done over and see that's what we can do we can be looking I'll put it in here and it's plain language we can be looking for the message of the the to wet the Redemption of the body the message and the message has already come right and like Brother Gary and I were talking the other day if you're still dependent upon something to to have to come forth in some Big Bang Theory or something then there's no difference in what people are saying in in that realm that it is to those that are saying but around's got to come back the biggest portion of people that message had to depend us upon something to happen some kind of something to take place that's why they start running after every little young guy come along or something he's really built up and he's going and everybody just flocks the history Monday night while they just die back down and go floating back into churches again you know I'm looking for something to happen yes but I'm not when it's already happened right if it's already happened I want to tell you it's happened all right so you can that way we'll understand what we're trying to get to but look what you probably had to say on the message of number one on your notes Jesus Christ are saying 62 uh zeros which would be 7 18 1962. and just you read all the others I give it to you I read it you read it and see what is your context or whatever and I just give you something to save time look where he says the Holy Ghost struck first on the West Coast some cross-eyed colored man down here in California Holy Ghost struck on California was speaking in tongues then came Divine Healing campaign I don't know was that what I said want to go sister Street took place then came a Divine Healing campaign see all right the Holy Ghost struck on California was speaking in tongues then came the king healing campaign and here we are at the end time is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever as I was with Moses 1951 503. e17. now a few years ago when I started there was none of that going on now back up behind her and read and you'll see that he's talking about healing in certain ways of great success um you back up and you read it right back on your computer backwards he's talking about things uh like every one of them is having such success some way now a few years ago when I started there was none of that going on as I said they could credit Paul Roberts and Billy Graham I mean or Robertson's being with random but actually boy Roberts came out so I wrote a random code right around was the first on the field of Divine Healing you know the big campaign it's a great move of God all right watch he said there was none of that going on the only thing that that this has done and this Supernatural now he's talking about his ministry now what has wakened ministers out of since bound out of the sense-bound realm into a place to where they see God is present I'm gonna watch the purpose of the Duane here to see God is present they take his word start a healing campaign God heals the sick see you say you can search through anywhere you want to and you'll find the supernatural right so what's he saying when he started out there wasn't nobody on the field when he started they came from him all of the great things that took place that came from you he said The Minister's wakened up do these things and started got out of their sensebound realm into a place where they see God is present then they started remember who was it tell Osborne one of them you know said run around should I go do this he said no he said go sit down under that old oak tree of brother Bosworth and listen to him on Divine Healing now brother Bosworth was on the field before brother random came on the field with Divine Healing but it was not having the great effect he would actually come off the field in retirement and then he goes back with brother Branham and starts on with it but see a healing campaign of the supernatural God to get the attention of the people right all right that's not to get the attention of the people to get you healed that's part of it right come on that's part of the thing that's what they were dwelling on healing campaign the blood around says you can't preach healing without preaching salvation and you can't preach salvation without preaching healing right so it was to get the attention of the people and he said the the we don't major on a minor he said preaching of the gospel and saving of the souls is the important thing that was to get the people to come to the meeting get under the presence of God get under the anointing get under the thing and get under conviction and as it would then it would would go forth and they would accept Jesus Christ because that's the purpose of it see you don't measure on a minor you you don't go with that see you try to make it to where that you you know the healings and the signs and wonders is to be among you even the gifts uh what is it in Corinthians even the gifts see if the gifts the reason the gifts what the prophets say he said somebody come in a meeting said you have them to meet before and have the gifted people they made it in the back room and they come out and they read and they say make a sister here or not she's got a certain certain disease because of what she'd done in a certain place and here it is and God will heal her it's not just a Labyrinth of the tongues and things it was for a purpose me and that way they'll fall down and worship God and give honor because they know that somebody has told them the truth see it's not just a healing campaign this healing campaign look at the next one we're going to read look where it grinds up the son of righteousness where it winds up being lady will see in church age 1960 12 11 the evening service paragraph 64. and he's coming down sort of righteous riding the healing Wing go forward and grow up in his paths on the stall you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be actions on their shoulders your feet see that's in the Millennium when you're gonna take place and in in that ice that I shall do this say up the Lord of hosts not the day that he's what's not not the day that he shall burn the Earth will tread upon their ashes that's the Millennium of course he so it's going to come to the millennial reign healing is going to lies until the Millennium rain will start coming in all right going over just make sure in the mountain two or three Witnesses uh number four you know it's true sign overlooked 1961-11-12 and he comes down reading the same scripture that fear by now show the son of righteous rise of healing in his wings and you shall go forth as cash in the stall that's the Millennium and you shall tread them to Wicked for this shall be asked you to understand your feet in the day that I do this saith the Lord of hosts coming out in the Millennium right all right why would the prophet cover going into the millennium the kids were going to walk out on the ashes of the people we're going to walk on the ashes of the people into the millennium because they're going to have to die they're going to be killed all right so then Divine Healing will come to an end all right now you want scripture for it remember that when it comes into the tribulation in the Book of Revelation it says that they will cry to die pray for the rocks to fall upon them that scripture in the Book of Revelation they will be crying out for those things and as they do they won't come right because the healing is already left right right it's going to the other let me look at something one of them you know excuse me a second I had a question and I thought I stuck the answer into my Bible I'll try I'll get back to it if I can find it somebody asked me a question and I wrote it down and put it in my Bible now I can't find a place to put it how far but now watch see then the sign of the healing listen now and you'll understand why all of these quotes follow after a sign of healing is a sign of the Resurrection right amen all right now the Lord Jesus had that sign right all right that's the sign of the son of man is the resurrection sign all right amen Jesus had that sign he could guarantee you healing isn't it odd brother around him come along he said give me 24 year worst cases and I'll guarantee you either it was a sign what a sign of the Resurrection so now you see why there had to be a healing campaign because everybody thought that they was going to get a new body we had no thoughts of anything about getting you know up this body changed we were only thinking of getting a new one and God would have to create that from somewhere to bring it to us right and see then God to get that offer of my mind he sends a healing campaign to show you the resurrection is present now remember my thought while ago don't be looking forward to something try to find out what's here so there when the prophet took off on the Divine Healing campaign God was showing the world that they wasn't going to get a new body but how many took that amen I mean in the messages took that come on no they're not going to change from their doctrines and their ideas that's right right but see then the prophet would begin to say it's like on the next one Angel of the Lord 1951 718 if there's no Divine Healing now there is no resurrection of the body that's right Divine Healing is the earnest of our redeemed body now notice what it said did you ever think of that no I kind of put a little marks around that where you'd read it and think about it the prophet said did you ever think of that of what that Divine Healing see now is showing that there will come a resurrection because that is the earnest of our redeemed body amen for God to heal somebody is showing that that's an Earnest right amen yep all right that's what he said did you ever think of that now listen to this one if there's no Divine Healing then when you go to the Grave that's all of it that's right now read these with me real careful look at it look what he's saying if there's no Divine Healing then when you go to the Grave that's all of it do you have to get a new body but there is Divine Healing right look what he says did you ever think of that if there's no Divine healings in there then you when you go to the Grave that's all of you you'll be there forever and your dust will go away and there will be no more of you see if there we have the earnest of our salvation and completeness back the way we was in the Garden of Eden I'm looking at you one of them thinking of the power and he talks about your sister about eating away within a few hours to live by cancer by the earnest of her redeemed body will put her in the condition it is now what will it be when she draws the full value of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's just the you know what the down the earnest is the earnest is the down payment on anything that holds it a surety security now she's just got the earnest of it by being healed with a hideous capture that would have taken her life and here she is sitting well and normal now brother random is tying Divine Healing to the Redemption of the body if you're reading for him will I accept 1952 718. he's talking about David crying out my flesh shall Rest In Hope because he will not suffer thy my Holy One to see corruption neither will he leave his soul in hell all back there all pointing to Calvary then in Jesus lays the complete of Salvation the complete of Divine Healing a if there is no Divine Healing now there is no resurrection of the Dead and I'd like for you to Wade over that listen to him yep that's right we have the first fruits of our inheritances that write the earnest of our Salvation he said I'd like you to wait over that you know stomp around get over the top of it get away from it okay testimony 1953 1129 the evening Services don't let the resurrection you're talking about the Dr Bassett who he's really talking about you know about how he preached the great Camelot message um you know talking about all in the resurrection when this Mortal puts on immortality of course any Christian believes that that there would be a resurrection but if there's no attributes of the Resurrection if there's no Earnest of the Resurrection then there is no Resurrection if there is no Divine Healing then there's no Resurrection now you couldn't disprove that if you could by this group you couldn't disprove that if you could by the scripture see I'm arguing the points of Christ see because we have the earnest of our Salvation which is the baptism of the holy spirit is that right that's the down payment the earnest which holds it secured heaven for us and it's dark then if there is no Divine Healing to make a cancer-ridden body come back normal and well again there is no resurrection of the dead that's right we have no no Earnest of it at all there's no plan made for it he said that sells hidden life 1956-12 you cannot preach salvation to this to the soul without preaching bodily healing you just can't do it you can't cut the Bible up like that because it will it's Inseparable the same man died at the cross he was wounded for our transgressions with his Christ we were healed the same day the blood from the same veins so see so see it's inseparable all right I got a point I got to stop on a minute so I have to keep looking back at my notes Here you am 56 12-15 no one can preach salvation without preaching Divine Healing see you cannot preach Redemption of the Soul without repreaching Redemption of the body see when you can't deal with sin in any measure unless you deal with sickness and ever attribute sickness is the results of sin now are you listening are you following no Divine Healing no Resurrection amen keep your mind on the thought though God brought a Divine Healing campaign it would go of healing for the body would go all the way until the change of this body that's why we can believe in you right hearing him 1958 301 the evening sir you will die Lazarus of Rage from the dead but died again see but if there is no Divine Healing which is the earnest of our Resurrection there is no Resurrection if there is no freedom from sin and living above sin and free from sin then there is no heaven to go to hmm this is just the earnest of our Salvation that we have now through the works of the Holy Spirit life is either 57 611. Jesus came to redeem both of them so you go back up below there and you'll see the bodies full of sickness and death is pronounced on it and all this that and the other and the soul is sick and the body's sick and Jesus come to redeem both of them that's right not just one his soul he came to bring complete Redemption and we only have the earnest of our complete salvation now if there is no Divine Healing now there is no resurrection of the body that's correct to what's he covered we have the earnest of our salvation and our soul we have the earnest of their salvation and our body now for him will I accept 52 718 the earnest of our redeemed body and if God can reach down and take a cancer-ridden like Miss Florence Nightingale in my book there you who've seen it the great granddaughter of the Florence Nightingale the founder of the Red Cross if God can reach down to that poor Richard mortal laying there they couldn't even raise her hands to shake hands hands to shake hands and couldn't speak till I speak till I could hear her and put her to a hundred and fifty five pounds in Perfect nail that's the earnest of our resurrected body keep on going demonology 1953 608 now let's talk about the death side and how can a person that on that estate in that kind of condition ever be sick all right because it's your body is not redeemed your body is not redeemed no matter how much how good you are and how saintly and how holy how much Holy Spirit that's only your soul and your soul is not complete yet it's just got the blessings the promise of God which is the earnest of our salvation but now if we have no Earnest of our Resurrection no Divine Healing then I'll have no Assurance of nothing to prove to me that there is a resurrection all right no Divine Healing no Resurrection Divine Healing came as a sign of the Resurrection to get the attention of the people for salvation of the Soul fundamental Foundation of faith 1955. 13 Jesus couldn't come to redeem us from just sin without redeeming us from the sickness of all the things that goes with it are all the things that goes with even to death he redeemed us from death we do not die there is no scripture in the Bible it says a Christian is dying we have eternal we have everlasting life and cannot die God promised to resurrect the body in the last days we rest in this assurance now we have salvation happiness and joy which is the earnest of our salvation of our complete Redemption someday and we have Divine Healing as the earnest of our Immortal bodies which is coming home okay Denver's 1960 12 11 morning service I do believe in Divine Healing it's one of the great doctrines of the Bible but Divine Healing has more to it than just Divine Healing do you read now listen to what your Prophet is saying that's why I want you to take these quotes home and read them Divine Healing adds more to it than just Divine Healing Divine Healing only says that there is a God who's coming again what does Divine Healing speak up it's the earnest of our Resurrection if there's no Divine Healing then there is no resurrection and if there is no Holy Spirit now to baptize us there is no eternal life in the world to come this is the earnest of our salvation all right Queen of the South 58 613 when you pre you inherited and when you preach salvation for the soul it has to be for the body too now it's the earnest of our Redemption if there is no Divine Healing there is no Resurrection for it's just like the earnest the same as the joy of the Lord and the Holy Spirit is the earnest of our salvation okay so good Earnest of your healing Earnest of your body is what your hearing is your Resurrection okay now listen now if it's unearnished and like we read there in one of the quotes Brethren said all Christianity believes in a resurrection now if you're going to believe in the resurrection you're going to believe in the resurrection then why would you think you're going to get your new body because the word Resurrection is to bring back what goes down true amen you see how flimsy our doctrines like run around until that lady said that's as thin as a suit made off of a shadow of a chicken that started to death no that's that's cutting pretty good y'all think brother Dale's pretty hard you need to read a lot hey he really cut that lady pretty hard I mean but now listen if there's going to be a resurrection and resurrect means to bring back that that went down well now is it going to come back old no it's not gonna come back old it's going to come back young because your Prophet has explained that to it that's what I'm saying to you if you'll catch these little points Point number two of them made one I'm making number two your profit never spoke of things to come like we think he would always speak of a present tense a present tense all right see then healing while we're alive right now while you're alive healing is not for the dead right right healing is not not for the person that's dead right no they they're gonna have to be changed they're going to be brought up in the resurrection all right but the Divine Healing that we have and that healing campaign that went out to the world and brother Branham prayed for the sick until his last message and in doing that that was a proof of the Resurrection you agree but now listen it wasn't proof of a resurrection to come 101.2 is proof of a resurrection that's present tense that's right the resurrection is not a past thing it's not a future thing it's present tense right right I mean now that your prophet preached the message why are we looking for the missions I don't understand you you you say why we're looking for the message remember that it doesn't say in Romans 8 um the the adoption the change of the body it doesn't say the adoption the Redemption of the body it says the adoption to wit to understand the Redemption of the body we've got to get that while we're here but it's already been brought to us all right amen sure amen it's the message the prophet brought because there's not another message to come right nor messenger right that's point two okay I said something to brother the other day about something he said when are you going to explain to me about what you said about 9 15 I said I'm not going to you're allowed to explain that to me foreign was never dealing with anything in the past or in the future he was dealing with what's present tense the your Resurrection your Prophet said his word he said it was inside of you all right that's right all right well while we're looking for a resurrection when it's inside of us right right all we got to do is get what's inside of us outside we got the resurrection take place that's right man 0.3 I'm trying to say something to get you to think and then later on when I come back and it'll just click back and you'll quit looking for something to come you'll start looking at what's here right it'll take place I mean why because our bodies the prophet said are not redeemed no we know it we know we're standing here in a sinful condition that's not hard to understand isn't it right you know but for a minute I want you to think about his what he's saying here in the next couple of quotes that there's something been going on that's right sure amen there's something going on now right so you could take one quote and make things fall the way over and take another and make it no but let's just get what he's look at who is this Melchizedek number 17 on your nose 1965 221 then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or Quicken Hallelujah Made Alive and when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there's no question and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection now he's dealing now with the earnest of the Resurrection as being something that's with inside of you right not just Divine Healing that's my point not just Divine Healing is something happening inside of you right amen what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started what's already started the Redemption of the body it's already started we're looking for the Redemption of the body to be walking along like this and all at once we run up against the wall or we hit something or whatever something falls down planner we got Redemption right it's easy to quote you know our body's not redeemed but it's according to your prophet he said it's already started right I told you I'm not going to get there so keep on reading the future home and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin and mire and Corruption but now it's got to be earnest station it's turned Heavenly right now that's the earnest that you're going into rapture it's the earnest um now he's dealing with something that's on the inside of you now watch him drop back because how can he cover it any other way we're going to find in a minute there's one in here somewhere brother running so this is the top so this here's the top now what a sick person laying down nothing left but death that's all that can happen I've seen the shadow of people done eat of chatters of people done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while after that perfectly normally strong normal and strong and if that's what if there's no Divine Healing then there's no Resurrection because Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection but he's already been telling you up above her that he's talking about an inward Resurrection Divine Healing is only speaking of that because you'd be sick again number 18 and we will cover these two again so you could remember them future home 1964-802 stage one page 49. he's coming down to talk about the redeeming of the earth and the thing you are part of the earth your body your soul is a part of God an attribute of God displayed here on Earth in the body the bodies to be redeemed now the souls redeemed because it was in sin so God came down by a process of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeems your soul and you being part of the Earth it's Redeemed by it amen you're in the process now it's growing on it right so remember those two statements already in process see the Redemption of the body is already constantly it says and that's what number four it's not something to look forward to right it's something that we should honor and realize that it's taking place right now all right I don't see no difference what's that got to do with it that's the same thing they said to Jesus he never turned around to those people when they were talking to him in an ungodly way or even to the lady that would stand there and say oh yes we believe one day Lazarus is going to come forth in the resurrection what did he say he said I am the resurrection yeah so she was looking to the end of the world of Resurrection he said I am the resurrection I don't mean to ever press attention okay now just for a minute I'm going to try to cover something all right you've heard the prophet talk about that Jesus's Ministry had three pools and that his ministry had three pools and the different things and uh you know would take place and I want to show you from this now to tie back in to what we were talking about of the son of righteousness writers and with healing in his wings to drop all the way back to 33 when the prophet began to start a healing campaign you ever understand what it just said we're going to tie this back to what we're fixing to cover we're tied back to where the Prophet started a healing campaign and that would be the son of rice to this rise when healing to his wings to come forth and the message would have to follow all right but still it doesn't mean nothing wasn't going it didn't mean there wasn't nothing going on you better remember that before your Prophet went to Arizona that the about four or three of those times of the third pool had already taken place before he went to Arizona sure I'm sure of three maybe four might even all five of them take a place before then right so he said that Jesus had three pools amen first pull is to heal the sick now don't have time to get back into the scriptures but you ought to know it enough and you can go in there in the gospels and find it that the Lord Jesus had a marriage had a supper it was a wedding to take place or a married supper and he sent out invitations and people didn't come right that's right and they come and told him said most of the people hadn't come he said go out and get the sick the lame the Hulk bring them in remember that in the scripture that's right yep they went out and got them they still wasn't enough he said go out in the highways and hedges and compel them to come right because I'm gonna have a wedding all right now you're following that pretty cool the second pool of the Lord Jesus was what Healing The Sick going out the second pool of brother Branham was what Healing The Sick is that what he said it is then you can say knowledge the first fool well you better tie it together now and get it over to where you understand the I know the quote First full of healing second holds prophecy so remember my point a message will always follow right the Lord Jesus had a message that he was preaching and he was doing the first pull under his message of Healing The Sick he was preaching the message which was the second poor and then one day he was preaching to the totally lost under the third book okay now so would it happen with brother Brown so look what he said is your life worthy of the Gospel 1963 6 30 the evening service I'm not getting on your notes now why did you notice there was three pools or three turns of it when they went out first and called to them that were bidden to come and they didn't do it so there went out a healing campaign went out to get the blind in the Halt and still there was was room still there were room so he went out and compelled a good bad into indifferent that they should come right wedding supper 1956 1006. go out and start a healing campaign bring in the lane the Blind and the halt and everybody hollers today about healing campaigns to get a crowd what's the matter with you preacher that's the light of the Bible that's right go get the lame and the halt that's the last call before the coming of the Lord according to the Bible go out and call a healing campaign Miracles and signs and wonders will be done and bring them in because I'm going to have my stable set full amen I've made it I've killed my family and I'm going to have a real supper and you go out and bring in the lame and the halt the blind The Afflicted brother that's real that's a meal call Divine Healing is the program of today that's God's last call is Divine Healing and then these Fellers that wouldn't accept it and set back with their big old dry theology tries to say that we put Divine Healing in the paper to get a crowd Jesus said to amen that would make a Baptist Shout Jesus sent him out you understand what he says and they say you sent out all these papers you're doing this is that what Jesus done Jesus told him to go out and bring him in see this thing's going to tie now to the to the three pools so when it started back there with the prophet I said he quit letting people preach for him he started preaching his own because it's the same time that he was that the sign of the Messiah was in the prophet the real sound of the Messiah was the message the prophet was bringing right there's your real fact the message the man was bringing the other was to get attention but it ties with the first second and third pool go out get the lame in the home in other words I have a healing campaign because it's fixing to take place that something's going to happen something's going to take place son of righteousness is going to have to rise with healing in his wings resurrection of Lazarus 1958-13 and if God made a way for a flower to live again what about a man that's made in His image the freeze might come but when a man is Born Again of the spirit of God there's life in there eternal life that'll stand to freeze and when the son of righteousness Rises with healings in his wings that'll be a church to go up to meet him in there that's right amen God will again bring a resurrection brother Branham had the resurrection sign that was the sound of the Messiah they didn't make rather random God it was the sign of the Messiah the son of man the resurrection sign right that's why he could guarantee your healing see nobody else can't do it I can't do that ain't no man in the world could tell you I guarantee you Heathen right I can say it like this you believe God's word not guaranteed but I can't guarantee it myself but brother Brown said you bring me 24 us cases and I'll guarantee you sure why because he had the resurrection sign the resurrection sign would be exactly like the Lord Jesus was when he was here on Earth that when he first started out they listened to him but then he began to bring his message while he was Healing The Sick and raising the dead and they got where they wouldn't listen to it it's not that exactly what happened with our prophet in the last days that's right sure identically the same thing right 1954 305 God's provided way of healing of dealing excuse me dealing with sin he talks about God shining on us the Holy Spirit and give us a birth as the morning Stars reflected a lot of the absence of Christ by his power and demonstration the church sheds forth a light in this dark time soon daylight will come and the son of righteousness would rise with healings in his wing this Mortal will take on immortality and he's not talking just about Divine I mean just talking about healing is he he's talking about Divine Healing that's why they couldn't understand brother Branham and see they were actually printing it in a way when they would say Divine Healing me and and to the human mind when you say Divine Healing that means that uh what you're saying is is the heat you can never be sick again you see that was against brother Brown because they called him a Divine healer he says I'm not a Divine leader but see he uses the word Divine Healing a lot of time because if you're healed that's Divine I don't care if the Beatles are singing the song and God healed the healing is divine because God does it right right now so it is to find Healing to end with an ultimate what a change of the Bible they just didn't know what he was talking about that's right how many of the people that makes you now knows what he's talking about immortality Resurrection immortality I'm talking about Resurrection from the dead of the person in the ground I'm talking about our Resurrection your Resurrection lays inside of you right amen all right this Mortal will take will take on immortality we'll see him as he is and be made like unto him his own glorious body and she'll never be sick for a headache or disappointments that's what we're waiting for the Sun message Faith 1956 815 when the son of righteous rides with healings in his wings these old bodies will be made immortal the soul that's tempted and tossed about will then be stable forever in the presence of God Amen Watchmen what other than that 58 11 30 the shadows of falling Christ is appearing that's why signs and wonders are appearing it's that great satellite reflecting off of the morning stars with the healings in his wings and if he will bring healing from the reflection of his presence what will he do when he comes in person that's right these corruptible bodies of ours will be changed and be made like unto his own glorious body what will it be when he comes until he comes we're thankful for the sunlight of his presence as the morning stars do I climbed around for some glory and sitting there to heal his coming in this dark hour and about three more so I know Simeon and Anna 1959 to 11. talk about eternal life and someday when Jesus comes though we be dust when the son of righteousness rise was healing in his wings this Mortal will take on immortality and we shall be resurrected and caught up to meet him in the air each one of those hands give them eternal life for we ask it in Jesus name the testimony of a true witness 61-1105 he's talking about coming down to another season That season will come will be the immortal season and when the Son of God Rising with healing in his wings it'll be totally impossible to hold those bodies in the ground any longer they'll come forth in the brightness of the Son of God very nature except testifies of it Divine Healing here proves resurrection's coming from there right amen right amen God has a provided way 1962 728 and as the sun as you as the SUV rises in the East and sits in the West the gospel of the s-o-n Rose in the East and setting in the West and now the same Sun that rises into East s-u-n is the sunning Sun that sets in the west and the same s-o-n Hallelujah that through his light of gospel and Power in his Messiah signed to the Eastern people in the last days now the clouds has cleared back away from the church and the son Rises with healing in his wings and brings forth from the power for the power evidence of his resurrection that He Still Remains the Son of God it shall be light in the evening time 1964 11 12 or 112 excuse me shalom I don't know how he's going to do it but his spoken word will be of indicated with the son of righteousness shall rise with healings in his wings and the healing part there will not be a physical healing as you think as saying somebody's got a sickness and it'll be taken away from them that's what he's doing now in time but the whole creation will be changed this Mortal will take on immortality this this old age will jump into youth amen he said I don't know but it'll be there I don't know but it'll be there I don't know how but it'll be there take on these things the son of righteousness Rises with healing in his wings goes all the way to the change of the body tied back together to the prophet said that Jesus had three pulls and under his second pull he was preaching the gospel and the healing signs and wonders was taking place the prophet of God was preaching the message and as it was signs and wonders was taking place but it was proof of the Resurrection he had the resurrection sign and it was the proof of the Resurrection that a person could stand there that had been totally sick all over like that if you ever seen that picture of that uh little girl he's talking about Florence nightingale's granddaughter where it was and seeing her standing there her legs is about that big around and just dying and but yet God miracally healed her see why because the prophet had the resurrection signed right the son of man could raise the Dead that's where people somebody said you're welcome they're saying now that Jesus couldn't forgive sins but according to my Bible the son of man can amen I don't know about that I just haven't believe what the word says but now listen because we're closed listen to one point they're in 33 when that stroke of the healing campaign maybe you didn't think I meant what I said or was listening God sent down proof that we was not going to get a new body he sent healing in a miracle is signed around the world to prove the resurrection was present right the prophet just stepped right into that Ministry and begin to speak and God came and honored his word but he knew there was a message coming that's right if they couldn't stand an healing campaign message what would they do when he began to say I and my father won he said when you begin to say I'm my father one of these other things he said the shark will pull away amen so you see a vast Gap beginning to form into people of the message that some are wanting to go on into the message realizing that the resurrection sign has come in the resurrection is in the message number five nope okay the resurrection is in this message you say well it's inside of you that's right because I'm hoping God's inside of you because if God is inside of you the resurrection is not inside of you okay is that blood enough if the Holy Ghost is inside of you the resurrection is inside of you but if he ain't inside the uterus Rex is not inside of you so you don't have to worry about it but you see it's got to connect to that message amen my Prophet stood there and he said I knew this message was coming because it's got to follow it and he said if healing Goes Forth in a great healing campaign and stays with the old message he said don't listen why because healing and signs and wonders is a sign that God is here that's right not that God is coming in now number six God is not coming right your Prophet said I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here if he's here to raise the dead and heal the sick he's here he was here to bring his own message through that prophet prophet and that message will take you and I to a change he'll take you and I to a change because it's already inside of you that's right it's not something to come we already got the message if it's not as I say it in Romans again there to say it it doesn't say the adoption the Redemption of the body or change or it says the adoption to wit to understand the Redemption of stand together that's right the Redemption of the body to understand it you've got to have a revelation before you can be delivered right right if you're sick you've got to have a revelation to show you that you're healed right right if you're lost you've got to have a revelation to show you're saved so why don't we pray to Revelation right go ahead 596 in this power book anybody have a need less Europe I know we'll start again huh start with the course now start with the course now and my mind is it must be gone here in my soul I feel you I feel alone I hear you foreign our love again for sure that I preached the whole building it's all the pool once you receive that humorous very hard previously the birds then it's a pull on their body because the work has already begun drawing control change in my heart to me in case you just feel something is going on amen look around the world see what's taking place that's right look at all of the world falling apart he just caving in just it's gone isn't it that's right I was talking last night because yesterday Brother Gary and Harry and I see about 1980 I said this way back then and I still say it because long about that time when they first reached the Moon your Prophet said that going to another planet was a type of the Rapture in a planetary travel was a type of the Rapture when they reached the Moon there's not been a lot of advancement in science as far as the physical Point like that right because they reached the goal sure now they're wanting to go on all out into the space you know and they're wanting to go and they're making ships and they're doing and preparing yeah but they wouldn't that Force BC we were fighting with Russia trying to get ahead of them and Russia was trying to get ahead of us and you know to go to to the Moon hey put up a rocket and we'd put up a rocket and this would happen that one happened but see now there's not a lot of doing that but don't miss this along about that time they started electronical situations that exist today in this world that is on unimaginable to the human mind they used to have a telephone that you had to have a line to run here to California right a wire had to be run then they wound up making what they call what is it monofilament is that the word for it they started making this thing that could carry hundreds and thousands of phone calls through one fiber option through one thing they didn't need millions of cables they had just one cable that would carry millions of phone calls and just go and it'd all be in there and nobody's Crossing each other at all sleeping that wasn't nothing because now you can take your cell phone and you can dial it you can speak to somebody in Russia China you just that's right from a cell phone there's so much of that going on and you think those are not bothering they're still talking about the cell phones just can damage your head yep because of you using it so close and things because well it's got to be waves but now they say that what is that word for it now somebody help me it's not a bandwidth but it's something similar to that it is a place that they can't put any more in there that's right so they're going to have to create something else high definition they're going to have to create another way Bob and them can tell you about it there they're gonna have to do something right to be able to handle this thing those are Supernatural amen they could turn right around now and they can go through that and they can pick up your telephone conversation and bring that conversation right back and play it to you to prove you made that phone call sure but where is it coming from they even spoke way back a long time ago and said it they believed that they had tapped into that they could hear voices down in Hell crying out so with all that foolishness it's working yeah see the advancement of trying to go on that way now if you get the point it's turned back here the advancement of science here is now so Superior until in Kuwait which is what 20 years ago they said they could lay a quarter on the ground and from outer space they could tell you where it was head or tails yeah that's 20 years ago used to you you've argued about wiretapping because you couldn't hear somebody now they just listen all they want to get my point the inner planetary travel was the last great goal of mankind because that's the top of the rapture right the Rapture is going to be here right right that's right was the Rapture here the mysterious things are happening in this life they could just about do anything yep they had to do that in the in remembering the tire Bible because nothing with Earth was in Genesis maybe afford to flood because nothing was withholding from mankind scientific achievements they're still working on decomposing the human body and send it to California and put it back together prophet of God said one day we'll travel like I thought see how all these things are so close that's right don't look out there look right here don't try to find what tomorrow is doing right here that's right all right like on these times father we just asked you to help us to understand because that's what we need more than anything in the world is an understanding a revelation not a hit knowledge not an intellectual conception that can do such marvelous things in this world until it's almost a supernatural world that we're living in but yet of God that can speak to the heart of an individual and lead each one of us bless Lord do sick among us reach down and touch each one Sister Barbara There Brother Gary for the day the different ones that are sick the sickness Among Us my wife and their back lord and their troubles just make yourself manifest that's all he ever has for you to just come on the scene and do what you said you'd do we love you we thank you in Jesus name just pray one for another you're dismissed let the Lord and blessed remember the services this weekend and remember now behave you a child lost the same place foreign
