TRANSCRIPT
========================================
alright so what we're going to do is today we're going to just kind of start in a section this is this is that one week that we're starting to talk about okay yeah yes yeah we need to talk about something about that um oh yeah I look just think about me what I got to give out of this quick yeah yeah I got it right right okay all right we're having to do without the multi task today but this is this this is the part of the chart that we have we've already got finished with everybody understand i hope about the pic no 483 years if we've already covered the sharp member the charges was up there this much right here we're pretty clear on that that this 483 years has already been completed not 486 and a half most people in the message this this gets wrong have four hundred eighty six and a half when they say there's only three and a half years left after the rapture of time to finish I'm telling you this because it's it's in the way you say it there is only three and a half years left of Jesus's ministry to the Jews no doubt there's only three and a half years of tribulation we're going to reject the trouble all right but there's one week or seven years left because we've only covered 483 years right there we've only covered 483 years to the cutting off of them aside Daniel 9 24 25 going fourth commandment to restore and build Jerusalem until the Messiah prams to be seven weeks priest born two weeks we covered that all right here everybody got that there's no doubt that there's 483 years finished not 486 and I don't even sound good right right it's 483 years finished but how many years are promised 490 so obviously 480 three or four hundred nine months 483 is what seven years left damn one week equals what seven years all right so there's one week left to the Jude the 70th week if you'll even look in your Daniel 70 weeks book brother branham preaches the last sermon he preaches is on the 70th week okay all right all right we'll be took me that's okay I'm gonna refrain from from reading anything out of the boat for right now all right so now if you want to write this down that's okay but you can write it as we talked about so now if this is the seventh church age which we living in right you and I are right now right about there okay you and I are right about right that what wait a minute hold on it that we're in them all you are here you know you're going to maul you like dick bigger more decision you are here oh you are here right there right and being at that point now anything that happens between here to there has nothing to do with you and I got dealt with the Jews stopped and began dealing with the Gentiles 27 church ages mmm all right then when he finishes rapture of church aids bride to me that covers you can't just say wraps of the bride rapture of the church age bride you can say Gentiles if you want to but it covers Gentile in any nation like and then God does what he turns back to the Jews according to the angle 926 and after three score 2 we shall Messiah be cut off and on for his help people the prince that shall come shall destroy the city we know that was Titus and therefore shall be with a flood and at the end of the war desolations clairement and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week what's going to happen when we go home this will be God incarnate going interactor if you're going to get a body change this glorified body it's going to be God incarnate in you so what Satan gonna do he's gonna come right back big on comin behind not right back down heaters down here anyway he's got your step right over here and do the same thing but he's gonna be Satan incarnate in a man called hope hey that's the he he shall confirm the code many for how long how long and one weight equals okay we all right with that yes and in the midst of the week watch the middle of seven right so you got you got three and a half years here uh-huh can you got three and a half years here or 1260 days and twelve hundred and sixty days that all right there all right yeah 1260 and 1260 get it cuz it's gonna be in Florida folks that's why this is a 16-6 yes please yeah well you got 1260 days and to prophets are going to prop it up okay cut off in the middle of the week and you've got more time left if one week equal seven years prophetically remember seven years is seven x 360 ok and then let's see what to do I had it at home but I didn't what I'm gonna go this way but let's do they were 16 I'm a couple milady good let's go to be important what you got that's what I thought all right you're gonna have I'm at twenty-five hundred and twenty days prophetic calendar so there's 2525 2520 days left according to the prophetic calendar all right that's 25 that's going to be really important right that's going to be really important because when we get to this number 20 26 this is the year twenty twenty six eighty remember I told you to put that on there to remember it to keep it in because we got to go back and once we go back we might be able to tell more about you are here okay all right don't you remember too though this is the key remember time continues this the 70th week of Daniel ends the prophecy and begins the Millennium which is still one thousand years of daylight dark 360 days kind of okay so it's not gonna be a thousand years of 365 and forth anymore what's going to happen the way I see it if brother Brown said some kind of atomic explosion tilted the world off in the days of Noah to make it 365 and for God right here when this a comic battle starts of all of Armageddon go this is an atomic battle this is actually men fighting men bombs gases chemicals whatever they can throw at each other they don't throw it but that thing is going to do what it's going to be an atomic explosion in the world don't sit right leg up just got to come back in order for right hand money everybody got there but now that you know it's hot so you could say seven years plus the millennium is still time right yes that's correct why's it it's a raptor took place right now you would have a thousand and seven years with right of before the white throne right okay yeah cuz I ready just a few minutes ago revelation 20 said the dead NAS Liam for a thousand years go see it right here at this battle of Armageddon there's not going to be any believers on the earth that's kind of hard to believe but you're talking you're foolish virgins going to be killed during this time your two prophets in 144,000 go to be killed at this battle of Armageddon is nothing but even against heathen leave me hope that's what's been forever there is no one there is no one with the Holy Ghost right here that's why they gonna start throwing things at each other they ain't care you already know one thing's for sure Israel has the Samson of thing Samson remember when he pushed those pillars he said Lord I'm gonna die but take all these with me will they have the Israel when all this happened you know what's going to happen here's what going to say push the button take a lot if we're going down if you're going to be this we're going all beat each other that's the Samson effects they already have that in place so anyway so this battle Armageddon once that battle begins and ends it will be nobody going to heaven right so it says in the Bible revelations 20 the dead not live for a thousand years so whoever dies right here is going to stay dead for a thousand years till we come up to the walk on judgment that some of them could be given eat our life right that's why I said there's 90 x filled with the Holy Ghost round here I'm not saying that people won't be given eternal life but somebody may be given eternal life surely the foolish virgin they're going to die and stay in the ground you know why the food's Burton has to die because they don't get cleanse here you and I see you and that's what really they are trying to freeze now the Holy Ghost if the Holy Ghost is the only thing goes interactor but a foolish version can be justified and sanctified and not here all the right word the unclean spirit can come back like a religious but still to a point they're virgins just this foolish virgin okay flannel that's why I'm going to tell you right now that's the way I believe it a lot of people that send this message you're going to be food for a lot like like eighty percent why go there not been taught just against that came back to hold up they just did leave a message they've been taught wrong I just told you have and I said yeah plays one thing for sure when that Devil confronted brother branham he was a spiritual being he knew that meant something was right about that man so guess what he's a believer him but how does these people that teach others wrong that is just trying to hype you what do they do about the time for the millennium that's still tired yeah I they just don't they got quotes so you just got them we're going to read them where it sounds contrary to everything we're talking about but there's no way that's why I'm telling you we're going to line it up by the Bible then we're going to start reading quote you can see what we're doing i'm not quoting brother around many many times we went just by the mile sure I've interjected things that brother brown fat and obviously but we'd not really just put them on the screen and said look this is what he said right okay because in the book seven times he said there's one week left after the rapture then you get in the seals he said no I didn't say that well if he said it the way that they thought he said it he's like you were they yeah they thought he said it but the way he said and the way he's over here in the bank in the seals he's saying the same thing ok that's long as you get in your head there is only twelve hundred and sixty days left after the rapture of the Ministry of Jesus Christ brood to profits that's all cloud he preached grant half already over here all right slow down verse 27 food we're gonna do scripture today and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week we're right here oh my god there he shall confirm when we go up there is no Gentile saved after that God comes directly into these two prophets and starts calling out 144,000 do I need to round 11 44,000 Yolanda left the two prophets preached and bring 144,000 out well Satan is standing right here incarnate in a pope and he's going to make a covenant for seven years and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week remember he's not going to just make the covenant with Israel he's going to make two coming it with the whole world cuz walking out look now everybody's against Israel even us now everybody's against Israel folks going to walk in and say hey except now you know actually buy this time America is going to be pretty it in pretty bad shape earthquakes already going to happen in California we're going to be our economy is going to be cloud filled folks don't step in say okay hold on let's let's make a peace treaty here let's make a covenant with many for one for seven years let's make a seven-year covenant let's go bother each other let's let Israel do what everyone's doing let's let America rebuild let's let Russia do this all of us come together and we're going to survive this thing come in with flattery he's coming in to unite right he's coming into like a brand together right alright so that's what's going to happen and in the midst of the week which is right here all right after the Prophet 1260 days he's going to break it all right now what we're going to do is we're going to go back and it's going to give a little confusing but I pray that you that you'll follow me because these feast days still have a lot to do with this one week actually to me that's what the feast for the culmination of the feast days happens in this one week your seven feast ok you get Pentecost what spin couple my name is even holding us that's their Pentecost and then and then they're going to receive the Day of Atonement the trumpet through two prophets these are the trumpets right then you come down to the feast of a coat you got a day of atonement what brother Brown said it won't be that they'll kill him again it's a morning for the kill they'll go back in Jeremiah and read where did you get those scars right in the house of my friend through these two problems they're gonna see Jesus Christ and they're going to go in morning so man we killed him 2,000 something years ago we're in trouble and then really he comes in since we don't worry about cuz we won't read your mind I've ever read by Jacob trouble we're going through today alright we're going to read that we don't worry anything else but he shall confirm the covenant for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease he's going to walk in and say I am your atonement and he's going to kill this big profit he's going to come in to look you got Passover is when they killed the lamb right are we going to watch this Passover's when they kill the lamb right now what they're going to get here is they're going to give this to feast all these feasts they're coming together just like you not get them because remember we get them spiritually we don't get them naturally we get on spiritually right okay Jesus died for our sins 11 Brad firstfruits where the firstfruits come up Pentecost we receive the Holy Ghost brother Brown said we're now we are now in face of the trumpet easy we're now under the feast of tabernacle you and I spiritually why God timer tackling in flesh that's what's going to literally happen around here Feast of Trumpets is what call together doo-doo-doo look come this way making a noise from Lord shall descend from heaven with the watch out boys Trump all right they have atonement they're going to realize right in here that that they killed them aside and then they're going to be tabernacle in flash get the Holy Ghost and then they're going to go in director see the Jewish raptures right here they got that because these two prophets are going to be killed you look at revelations 12 14 they're going to be killed 144,000 will be killed and they're going to go in there after they're going to have to wait a little while from this valve Armageddon go and come back cuz I got something to do right here I left that blank let's get the first part right you are here we go in our actress Satan comes down incarnate suppose he little age she'll make a covenant for one year then he's going to break that covenant all right and for overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate white he walks into that temple because they're going to lift a home the old you I mean the new Jews were going to build a temple it's what you want to do now they know thing build a temple they need to red heifer they need the sacrifices they need the altar and guess his God Romans got all the member he's looked at Tates we saw the we saw the mural that was it was engraved in stone showed him coming back with a menorah and the ark and I and Israel knows they got it they not done and they need those pieces so what better time for a man called a poet step being the same alright we're going to make this covenant but you got to be peaceful we're gonna give you a heart back we're going to give you mine or back we're going to give you this back so see they're getting ready see a tie this is a real type of town because the bag is in the Methodist and all they know jesus is coming but they don't know how they don't think got the word to do it with same way with the common jus but there's a two prophets in 144,000 is going come in and say look just like Jesus he walked in the temple and said I am the bread of life unleavened bread they were having the feast of my liver bread he walks in the temple to the I'm to bread of life no they got mad at right same thing home didn't listen this 144,000 extra profits are not going to be killed by just some American think you really don't I mean it's not going to be any point who's going to kill them their own people don't people ones that want liberal temple worship right alright so that's why we keep this cuz when i finish with these these days i'm glad we went over them because if it's interlaced all in here so according to daniel 9 27 sorry corner daniel 9 27 this is the week that's left for one week so there's one week left of fulfillment of daniel 70 weeks which started when when did it start 445 bc waiting on time ago it took a long time with this seventy weeks but you know god's he's just real patient alright baby it will end right here this 70th week will have an end to it okay but it's not going to be end of time going to be into the 70th week because we're going to get into it a little bit later of Revelations 12 1 through 13 gives you 1290 days and thirteen hundred and thirty days let's pass this time yeah okay but remember your lap overs remember looking it even the charger brother branham diesel drew there's a lap over between eighty 30 and 8074 cottage destroyed Jerusalem there's a time than their that God give them repent look Israel came back 1947 from 47 so now they've been gathering back in the homeland all these Church agents remember they lap over there's a lap over of time it's not complete and then you know all right so now let's read Jeremiah 30 and you don't have to get to an ottoman one gone yes I did come off this one come over the best one no oh no I might be but I don't anymore because cuz look you can't do that in show it to a bunch of people because they'll say well the angel on the wall do it like brother I'm doing which is fine that's okay you know single but read one run around to that taste of one hates left over the other so the lamp over an age would be like that no one ate leftover the other right okay I mean to me that's just common sense right okay that's why 1977 so important 1977 to me was the finish of the lap over of that church age that old Pentecostal age come and in 1977 we come into the Son of Man ministry and it went higher than they'd ever been before okay we talked about that the question was a lap oh oh oh he said it was the end of this from the sick the lap over the six over to the seventh we should say no no no the lap over from the states church age to the senator kay was during the Pentecostal time okay that's for those because little girl Wesley Wesley Wesley was fine for his day and then there was a lot of west lens that came over they just remember when it brother i'm saying to start 1906 huh so right in here they would feel a little bit of Wesley going on but 1912 look 19 6 is one of the Holy Ghost felt in the age starting brother I'm saying but remember 1912 is when the oneness when they came out one drilling with God and Jesus Christ water baptism because remember 1906 trashed Arians they were baptized the father son Holy Ghost they believed in 30 Trinity but the Holy Ghost fell on them to give them the gifts okay but then it brother Brown said y'all would have been all right if you'd have moved on but they cabbage down on you guys speaking tongue is the evidence so brother Brown said what God moved right from the Pentecost right over to the badness bambridge took you so far and got left the batter's went right over into the different ones okay alright so now truly we're in a bride age let's go to Jeremiah though this is very interesting because what happened is this is a time this is always called the time of Jacob's trouble you ask the Israel they know it's come and watch the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord said now remember Jeremiah's the one got told that they're being captivity for 17 weeks remember way by long time ago around airline because what did Daniel do Daniel read my books he looked back to Jeremiah and Caroline I said you gonna be in there remember Jeremiah comes up and and Hananiah there's no are we going out in two years and puts the horn on and you know knock something down and makes a big show Jeremiah said that's fine but the guy only lived six months he's died remember God took the man off the same not Jeremiah but the other prophet why cuz you didn't get his daniel said two weeks right good the word that came to generalize from the Lord saying thus speaketh the Lord got a visual saying right knee all the words that I've spoken unto thee in a book for lo the days come days days saith the lord that i will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah said the Lord and i will cause them to return to the land 1947 remember they were scattered watch what he's going to do with the people of scattered and I will cause them to return to the land that I give to their fathers and they shall possess it that's a prophecy this we saw fulfill all right and these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel and concern Judah because remember Judah was one that went whoring you know what Babu come for the SAT the Lord we have heard a voice of trembling of fear and not of peace and had peace in Brevard ASCII now and see whether a man does prevail with child wherefore do I see every man with his hand on his loins and a woman in travail and all phases are turned into paleness alas for that day or now what he'd be talking about he's talking about when these two prophets start preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ these people are going to start absolutely travailing and mourning and weeping again when they get a revelation as one infant prevailed in all phases returning to penisy that's going to question alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of Jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it 144,000 not all Jews 144,000 for it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord of hosts then I will break his yoke from all the neck and will burst I bond give them holy go and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him the strangers over there us-russia right because what's which might be but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king now David is no I son of David whom I will raise up unto them okay they did raise up a natural David but he promised that natural David that he would rule and reign so what's the time of Jacob's trouble is coming on over here a little bit lamp over just a little okay because remember the King he's the son of David here but he can't be a son of David here until he comes here and does all this we're fixing talk about put everything a line therefore fear thou not o my servant Jacob that the Lord neither be dismayed o Israel for low I will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and Jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid alright Brian Wendy said the Lord I see he's come out of Jacob trouble he's really had no rent to the millennium cuz remember the Millennium is a jubilee for the Jews rest remember when you had a jubilee in the Bible you had a rest your arrest rest time right remember that but now they gotta come up yeah yeah we got we've gotta work on that inside here I'm just giving you a whole part of Jacob's trouble really how to put parentheses and put it in here but really it's covering all the way the limit but watch for unwitnessed at the Lord to save thee though I make a full end of all nations whether I have scattered thee road Ramsey of the Battle of Armageddon is a termination of forces what nations nation is always good as its military right right but i will make full end of all nations whether i have scattered they yeah i will not make a full end of the one promise but i will correct the in measure now they can get the correction through to promise and then only in the Millennium they're going to get more correction from us it's sold out remember remember there's a heathen there's a fish seal jus it's going to come in right here did never knew a thing about Jesus cry never knew anything all they knew about was temples barks justification sands casing baptism hold ago I'll lend you was outer core inner court hold right there are the ones under the alternate mm-hmm yes the fish help you I will correct the in measure and will not leave thee all together and punish he didn't because this you have done 144,000 have to die they're gonna come back in their bodies in there you know and then glorify bodies barely a month ago they all gotta die right here everything dies don't want me get a girl around set okay everything dies at the Bell along again for thus saith the LORD thy bruise is incurable and I wound this Grievous now remember when exit ladies blood be on us on our children God then at that time divorced Israel and Fleur away hello Israel was God's Ezra was God's life in the old testament she had the right she had the rights that we have now if she would have continued on the bell right with that ok then what'd he do he put her away what she went Laurie so she defiled herself but he didn't forget her this nut for for the steps lord I'm bruises and curable in other words that can't be bribed they can't come back in here and go over now we're bright know that remember brother I said their sermons I'm 44,000 two prophets all our service we even get over here in the future home we're going to live in the home in the future home the ride is and 144,000 are cervix to the bride everybody else has live outside City then come in but you can't stay they got leaked right so it's incurable there's no way they can get back to what you that looks bad but it really it's not it puts them in their place not all right and I wound is Grievous oh I didn't want to do that I didn't want to put them away but he knew they would could he give it to you get a Gentile bride all right look there is none too pleased not cause the thalamus be bound up now has no healing medicines in other words God is going to have to do it they can't there's no they can come back like all the lovers have forgotten them they went into other nations right but now God promised back a bit he's going to destroy every nation that you ever went to do you hear what I said everywhere the Jews were dispersed guns that I'm going to do away with that nation hey listen he's not going to be Russia and China and all nations in here they're going to be represented yeah they're going to be represented okay the people we're Americans will never forget where american idol thing but all nations we're not going to have a united states to go back to and a Russia to go to know we're God that this is the kingdom of the millennium that's when everything comes together all right and remember you a few Gentiles that Betsy Germans and a few this do that that's that that's right but whatever nation yeah the nation's that's going to come against Israel God's going to walk upon face the earth the nation which is to what the cosmos the World Order of Russia of the world order that's what the problem is now there's good people in every nation is just the corrupt ones as was just corrupting the whole nation right for that lovers have forgotten they seek thee not for I have wounded d with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of a cruel one for the multitude of thine iniquity watch because I sins were increase but what's he going to do first part of the six fold purpose finish transgression make the end of their sins and reconciliation for their iniquity that's going to be fulfilled okay then I got that look the word iniquity there's an equity in all these different things right why Christ now for that affliction the sorrow is incurable for the multitude of that iniquity now looks like they're in trouble the watch because thy sins were in crieff hmm I have done these things under there he's telling them if you would or not sin you wouldn't be in the place you're in there for all day that devour these shall be devoured he's fixing to turn this thing all back around all that adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity be killed and they they spoil this shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey remember God said long time ago he said whoever honours Israel I wonder that nation that's why God Brown see God honored United States because they've honored Israel but what when everybody turns against Israel we're done anybody turns fire give me for a prayer for I will restore health unto thee and I will heal the of thy womb say at the Lord because they call the an outcast saying this design whom no man seeketh after thus says the Lord behold I will look of eyes I will bring again the captivity of Jacob tents and have mercy on his dwelling places and the City shall be builded upon her own heap and the palace shall remain after the manner there and you can read the rest of it we don't have time and out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving divorce of them to make merry i will multiply them they shall not be a few i will also glorify them and they shall not be small not that it's Jacob's trouble that's the time of Jacob's trouble but what is happening God is bringing them out of that trouble because see there's going to be a tabernacle read Ezekiel 42 44 that's the Millennial temple that the Jews will erect sometime in here because remember right here it's going to be the fulfillment of revelations 19 what happens in Revelation right come back right with their rights 19 1 and after these things I heard a great voice and less people in heaven saying I lelu your salvation and glory and power and honor to the Lord you keep going to bride somewhat the bride and the armies that were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean who's that brother Brian said that is thus riding back into the millennium and according to this last / full six full purpose is what a north of most holy sometime right in here but we'll get to that but we don't lay them feast days right into that hmm Z 0 40 40 through chapter 44 it is the lot of people think that spiritual but i might brother branham I don't see why God would take so much time to put all the dimension then if it's just spiritual run there's dimensions they're going to actually build a temple because we that's what's the Millennium is God's not going to do away with sure what i'm doing sacrifices but God want to say God is going to let them erect that temple and then we're going to be able to teach in that temple because we're the ones going to be able to live in the temple and then the 12 tribes of Israel that's what the son of David was promised that you'll rule in the millennium or your rule over the 12 tribes of Israel has a son of David so it's going to be the son of David sitting on the throne okay and all this bride around him and then the hundred forty-four thousand is going to be the servants and the 50 mg alright will be raised up in the Millennium I don't understand as a pop so the Jews resurrect and build all the temples overrun in here somewhere in this that's why there's 1260 days left but then we don't come back to thank get all that done that's correct yes that's correct yeah the bride comes back to live in the table that's why I'm bad directed to deal that's right that's why I that I need something maybe that's no looker that's why listen if Daniel 70 weeks stops right here you've done away with all that yeah you know time to come got it out of it you've done away without that whole picture right here you don't have 1220 day you've only got that that's what people the message say no there's only three and a half years left and that ends they say this ends the seventy weeks of Daniel no way that can happen because remember we got a sixfold / + 3 of them here and three of them here okay bring in everlasting righteousness you can't do that before the Battle of Armageddon how you gonna bring their relax and righteous just need to destroy everything I mean it just don't really make sense but you know what to do they hone in on a couple of clothes and then they build all this around just a couple of cool Jesus didn't eat my flesh and drink my blood they probably a lot of people built around up around those clothes that were nuts so let's go they will get back into next week come on through this plant you
