[15:49] you and we depend upon that have your
[15:52] way now in Jesus name
[15:56] First Corinthians 11. 18 and 19.
[16:01] for first of all when you come together
[16:03] in the church I hear that there be
[16:05] divisions among you and I partly believe
[16:07] it for there must be also harrises among
[16:12] you that they which are approved may be
[16:14] made manifest among you
[16:18] all right first there's first Peter 3
[16:21] 15. recite before I found the Lord God
[16:24] in your hearts and be ready always to
[16:26] give an answer to every man that's
[16:28] asking you a reason or to hope that is
[16:31] in you with meekness and
[16:33] fear amen you may be seated the Lord had
[16:36] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[16:39] now we've been covering
[16:43] for some time now a lot of the doctrines
[16:46] and things
[16:47] among the people of the message
[16:50] and as I always say to each one of them
[16:53] as we cover these doctrines I speak only
[16:57] as of to what I have heard to what I
[17:00] know for myself
[17:04] um I've been acquainted with some of the
[17:06] doctrines you know in closeness and
[17:08] listen to them and you know try to check
[17:12] them out see what they're saying
[17:14] and try to see what they're trying to
[17:16] say instead of literally the words
[17:19] sometimes that are being used
[17:21] because you can misunderstand and and
[17:24] not you know get in the correct order
[17:27] and number two then I know and realize
[17:30] that when I announced they were going to
[17:32] speak on this
[17:34] as a doctrine that there's many groups
[17:37] of people that may be related to that
[17:41] doctrinal point but don't agree with the
[17:44] other parts
[17:45] and I was thinking about it there
[17:47] yesterday I think it was
[17:49] and and that's all came to me I was
[17:51] thinking right now you know there are so
[17:53] many doctrines among the people of the
[17:56] message but you know what I thought of
[17:58] little random said it wasn't
[18:00] a hard thing for Martin Luther to
[18:04] protest the Catholic Church see God told
[18:08] him he had done it and that was it said
[18:10] the thing was to hold his head above all
[18:13] the fanaticism that went with it you
[18:16] know and people went out and burned down
[18:18] the Catholic churches and this that and
[18:21] the other under Luther and said that he
[18:23] was telling them to do those things you
[18:25] know and he didn't do it but you know
[18:27] what we do we start trying to argue with
[18:29] anybody about what they believe but just
[18:32] trying to state to our people and to
[18:34] anyone else who wants to listen the
[18:37] things that we don't agree with
[18:40] and I kind of put each one of these on
[18:43] here where there was somebody
[18:45] disconnected on one message then if they
[18:47] want to go back and pick up the others
[18:49] they're welcome to do it if not that's
[18:51] fine but we spoke on two Lords two two
[18:54] Souls Two Lords
[18:56] on River Jordan you know Jesus wouldn't
[18:59] go out to the River Jordan the seventh
[19:01] under virtues that you can't have the
[19:03] virtues that they had to virtue of them
[19:05] to the ages when the Thunders well I
[19:07] don't agree with that because I believe
[19:08] the Thunders of Revelation contained The
[19:10] Prophet said in the Seven Seals and they
[19:13] say one of them was that one Doctrine
[19:15] was that you don't how the Holy Ghost
[19:17] today like it was in the book of Acts
[19:20] and I tried to explain that as to the
[19:23] difference in the upper room experience
[19:25] of the 120th tutor for three and a half
[19:28] years compared with a group downstairs
[19:30] and only heard one sermon and and you
[19:33] know and bringing those things out and
[19:34] trying to show you why
[19:36] uh I don't believe the things and you
[19:39] know and the damaging part that would be
[19:41] to to us all right then we went through
[19:44] their past this past Wednesday uh it was
[19:48] brother Branham the one that came to
[19:49] John on Patmos
[19:51] and uh we tried to cover that as the
[19:53] basis of that was the writing of the
[19:56] word and my concern is is who came to
[19:58] brother random right to bring you and I
[20:00] the message in the end time and all like
[20:02] that and and the doctrines and then this
[20:05] morning we were covering how the is
[20:08] there going to be recovered a two-part
[20:10] thing one was that some people believe
[20:13] that brother random was God
[20:15] you know some would say he's the Lord
[20:18] some would say he's this or that or the
[20:20] other some said he was the son of man
[20:23] and things and we went through that this
[20:25] morning covering it showing why we
[20:28] didn't believe those type of things but
[20:31] when we do believe surely that every
[20:33] born-again believer that has the New
[20:35] Birth that is deity inside of you so
[20:39] laying aside the gifts and the things of
[20:41] the prophet of God then if you have the
[20:44] new birth he had the new birth you're a
[20:48] deity he would be deity because that
[20:50] would be God living in you you know and
[20:53] trying to bring Fame all right now this
[20:57] afternoon we're going to cover another
[20:59] point that has been kind of confusing
[21:02] and the people some have been by here
[21:06] and stated some of the things and we
[21:09] didn't agree with it and uh you know on
[21:12] some of these things and uh so you know
[21:16] I don't try to argue and fuss I try to
[21:19] express and say well I just don't agree
[21:21] with that that's because I can't see it
[21:23] I can't see something it's like I told
[21:25] the man personally that believed in the
[21:28] two Souls I said I can't see what you're
[21:30] talking about
[21:32] I said I'm not saying you're wrong I'm
[21:34] right I'm saying I can't see it
[21:36] and I said you just pray for me you know
[21:39] and I'll pray for you because I just
[21:41] can't see it well I'm just why not be it
[21:44] that way you know it's a whole lot
[21:45] better and say oh yes I believe that
[21:47] didn't go around but I don't really you
[21:48] know no I'd really just you tell me and
[21:50] I don't believe it right right and then
[21:52] maybe we could work on some things of of
[21:55] doing but now what we want to talk about
[21:57] this afternoon is one day
[21:59] has been among the people of the message
[22:02] for quite a while
[22:04] and like I said maybe one or two tried
[22:06] to preach on it a little bit here and
[22:07] we've heard it different places and some
[22:10] of you heard this one on a lot that
[22:13] people believe that Adam
[22:15] injected his seed into Eve
[22:18] to save her
[22:21] now that's a Doctrine among the people
[22:23] of the message and as I said you've
[22:25] heard it's priest here right that's a
[22:27] couple of times and you know I have to
[22:29] say that I just can't see that right and
[22:33] now I'm going to say it this way because
[22:35] like I said there are so many different
[22:37] versions of it till
[22:39] people doing uh well did did Adam have
[22:43] sex with Eve to save her
[22:46] or was it to protect her
[22:48] or was it to preserve her
[22:51] or whatever word would you want to use
[22:54] to be involved you know to see that you
[22:57] could come up and say well my pastor
[22:59] don't believe that it was to save her he
[23:01] believes it was to preserve her okay we
[23:04] just covered that then we just lay that
[23:07] down and you know put it in the right
[23:09] order
[23:10] but now
[23:13] I I just can't follow the thought amen
[23:17] as to where that you could have sex in
[23:21] any form
[23:22] as to be any form of preservatives right
[23:25] or
[23:27] um protection or or anything
[23:31] and uh
[23:33] if you did what would it be so much
[23:36] trouble about serpent seed right you
[23:38] know what would be why why do we need to
[23:41] know about serpent season know what we
[23:43] are and uh it's like Brother Gary Atkins
[23:46] he's not here but he hears it is he
[23:48] alive because he said if if that's all
[23:50] the thing it was it was sex so that's
[23:53] what we had done on 10th Street during
[23:55] Atlanta when you had the hippie movement
[23:57] you know the love movement yeah you know
[23:59] uh you you just you get into the wrong
[24:03] thing amen and instead of trying to make
[24:06] it something you know and look at it
[24:08] that's what it's saying
[24:10] and understand it right you know people
[24:13] get this great Revelation brother Dale
[24:16] you're just not spiritual well if that's
[24:18] what you call spiritual
[24:20] and then I wonder what would be
[24:24] something be wrong
[24:26] you know I mean if it's if it's the fact
[24:29] that I don't believe Adam injected his
[24:31] seed into Eve to save her what would be
[24:33] on what would it be a wrong you know I
[24:37] mean because that's the one thing that
[24:39] got it started in the wrong direction
[24:42] amen right that which you know was that
[24:45] point of what took place so let's just
[24:48] go through that and you just bear with
[24:49] me as I try to speak on these things a
[24:52] little bit and and just put it to my old
[24:54] ignorance and go on and say all right
[24:56] now
[24:58] we know for Surety what happened in the
[25:01] garden amen
[25:03] now we're not dumb enough to not know
[25:05] the situation
[25:07] we know that Eve had relationship with
[25:11] the Beast
[25:12] all right
[25:13] now
[25:14] then
[25:16] she gave to Adam and she had a
[25:18] relationship with Adam and from that
[25:21] came Cain as the lineage of the Beast as
[25:25] being twins with Abel and from Abel you
[25:28] know coming from
[25:30] Adam
[25:31] in the basis of the relationship all
[25:34] right now we've got enough sense to know
[25:37] that took place but that is the the
[25:39] thing but I just can't see how that you
[25:42] know I'll give you a quote in a minute I
[25:43] don't mind giving you the quotes of what
[25:45] these people believe because I don't
[25:47] want you to come along say well well you
[25:49] didn't tell us this that they believe
[25:50] you know what I'll do the best I can to
[25:52] tell you both sides and then you make up
[25:55] your mind as to what you believe right
[25:57] that's I don't see why anybody wouldn't
[25:59] want to do that
[26:00] now when this act took place in the
[26:04] garden
[26:06] why would brother Branham emphasize
[26:10] the fact that
[26:12] Adam
[26:14] had a right to reject Eve
[26:19] all right sure
[26:22] and what would have taken place to Eve
[26:24] have Adam rejected her right
[26:28] she would have been destroyed right now
[26:31] all right we'll get to these in a minute
[26:33] and some quotes from some things but
[26:37] I I'm just the point I want to make to
[26:40] you
[26:41] that you cannot make
[26:44] the the wrong act
[26:46] turned out to be a right thing right
[26:49] amen you know I mean how can you do that
[26:53] you can't say well uh you know people
[26:56] are just ignorant so they don't know and
[26:58] that was no if it's wrong it's wrong
[27:03] and if Adam could have saved Eve by
[27:06] doing that then that would have to mean
[27:09] that some way and that's what people
[27:12] would think see that look at them doing
[27:14] this and all and he injected his seat he
[27:16] took and we've heard it right here and
[27:18] it immediately when the situation took
[27:21] place that Adam grabbed even and knew
[27:24] they had to do something so he grabbed
[27:26] her and and you know had intercourse
[27:29] with her and uh that protected her well
[27:33] if that would be right then where would
[27:35] be the blood of Jesus Christ
[27:37] where would there be any indeed of a
[27:40] savior right
[27:42] you turn it into a sex act right you
[27:45] turn it into a uh this you know some
[27:50] kind of a lineage and then that's the
[27:53] way the people of the message believe it
[27:54] and I've asked for this is one doctor
[27:56] that's in the message that they said if
[27:58] you're born from Adam you could be saved
[28:03] you ever heard that one and it said if
[28:05] you're born from the Beast
[28:07] you could never be saved
[28:09] that was part of the two Souls of
[28:11] doctrines of the issues that came forth
[28:14] well why would God offer
[28:18] salvation decaying right if it wasn't
[28:22] for him right amen now let's don't make
[28:25] God the author of confusion amen amen he
[28:29] offered it right
[28:31] he didn't want to destroy it
[28:34] um
[28:34] Judas
[28:36] he loved him
[28:39] let's let man take care of his own ways
[28:42] of doing things but you see what I
[28:44] believe took care of Eve and we'll read
[28:48] it in a minute
[28:50] it's the same thing that took care of
[28:52] Sarah that's right when
[28:55] she was life in the male Chesney that's
[28:58] right and we don't have no record there
[29:01] of a sex act taking place
[29:04] you know we have a record of
[29:09] one thing
[29:10] God could not destroy Sarah
[29:14] because she was a part of Abraham that's
[29:17] right all right we'll get to that in a
[29:19] minute
[29:20] well I want you to understand
[29:23] that Genetically speaking Sarah was not
[29:27] a part
[29:28] of Abraham that's all right
[29:31] agree
[29:34] but Genetically speaking
[29:36] Eve was a part of everyone the word
[29:39] genetic I guess he called it the room
[29:40] what you call germs you know you've got
[29:43] the education I don't
[29:45] uh
[29:48] Genetically speaking is just a word I
[29:50] use for that see he was actually a part
[29:52] of Adam she came from his body that's
[29:56] right
[29:57] yeah it wasn't just a marital form as a
[30:01] protective all right she literally came
[30:04] from his body right
[30:07] and then in doing that
[30:10] then what would be the thing that would
[30:13] save her
[30:15] you know and also we're going to get
[30:17] down when we get it if we got times we
[30:19] know we'll do it Wednesday we're going
[30:21] to get down to the one of Judah and
[30:23] Tamar
[30:24] that everybody likes you know so well
[30:27] and you can see these preachers until
[30:29] they just you know they they get all
[30:32] excited
[30:33] one night my one brother did here you
[30:36] know I mean he Illustrated that Adam
[30:38] just cookies and
[30:40] you know I mean
[30:43] uh I'm sorry I'm
[30:45] I'm too old I guess
[30:48] maybe I was born under the old school
[30:50] and just don't agree with a lot of
[30:52] things amen but you know what was it
[30:56] that took care of Eve I'm asking you a
[30:59] question
[31:02] laughs
[31:03] what took care of Eve
[31:06] between the times
[31:09] of the act with the Beast
[31:12] and the time with Adam
[31:20] a simple question
[31:22] I think something you know I think the
[31:24] Bible and all the message is very very
[31:26] simple amen
[31:27] and using simple terminology
[31:30] what took care of her
[31:32] minded God not destroy all right
[31:37] because even your Prophet says that sin
[31:39] cannot abide in the presence of God
[31:42] amen
[31:45] all right
[31:47] so let's go to it and just find out
[31:49] something
[31:52] and then we'll maybe
[31:54] bring something in the end it'll be up
[31:57] maybe a tad bit surprising
[32:00] about
[32:02] some of the things forgive me you know
[32:06] no devil he likes to fight
[32:09] but that's all right I'll get me a cough
[32:12] drop and I'll take care of that
[32:16] all right now what was the thing that
[32:18] brother random said
[32:21] was the reason that
[32:23] Eve was not destroyed right
[32:28] right he did not say it was a sex act
[32:30] right
[32:32] he said it was because that Adam loved
[32:35] Eve right
[32:37] all right
[32:39] now let's start on that and just see
[32:41] what we're talking about
[32:43] let's go ahead and message Oneness
[32:47] preached in 1962 to 11.
[32:51] paragraph 30. all right
[32:54] now Adam was a part of our Eve was a
[32:57] part of Adam
[32:58] she was flesh of his flesh and bone of
[33:00] his bones and that's what the correct
[33:02] Union is
[33:04] and that's what the the correct Union of
[33:07] the church is Spirit of his Spirit word
[33:10] of his word now he was part of Adam
[33:17] all right
[33:18] now if she was part of Adam in the
[33:22] natural
[33:24] will get to it after a while how much
[33:26] more is it
[33:29] of us in the spiritual right all right
[33:33] see she was flesh of his flesh we can
[33:35] read that in the Bible but what I want
[33:36] you to get is what the prophet said
[33:38] that's what the correct Union is
[33:43] the great Union is she was part of him
[33:47] because the new birth is not
[33:51] God coming down in the Holy Spirit to
[33:53] have a sex act with you the planet the
[33:56] sea that's right
[33:58] now
[33:59] that's not the new birth that would be
[34:02] carnality and it would make God having
[34:05] to come down in a literal and have a
[34:08] relationship with Mary to bring forth a
[34:12] child and that wouldn't work out but now
[34:15] here's the one that they love to read on
[34:17] this part so we'll go up to it and read
[34:19] it
[34:19] on page 234 the church a book to talk
[34:22] higher in church age
[34:26] and look now Eve should have been burned
[34:30] along with the serpent
[34:33] for their awful deed
[34:37] now that's your word to your Prophet
[34:39] right
[34:40] she should have been burned
[34:43] and you know what if Adam had not taken
[34:45] her
[34:49] and went with her and her sin
[34:53] that's exactly what would have took
[34:55] money right amen yep you should win all
[34:58] that good well all right we know we know
[35:01] the story she's part of him but just
[35:03] remember God told Moses one day
[35:07] he said you just stepped aside
[35:12] and I was just wipe out this whole thing
[35:16] and he said I'll start with you and
[35:18] raise up another generation yep do not
[35:21] ever think that God couldn't do it right
[35:23] that's my point don't think that God
[35:26] couldn't have destroyed Eve
[35:30] if you don't like our city of uh thing
[35:32] but make it a form of word
[35:37] he could love her and it could type
[35:39] Redemption right
[35:41] let's be careful when we get to those
[35:43] points but he could type it all right
[35:47] but Adam intervened watch taking her
[35:50] quickly to himself
[35:52] so that she could be saved
[35:55] Now where's there any point there
[35:57] implication of sex
[35:59] right he took her to himself
[36:05] I mean
[36:06] in other words he embraced he held her
[36:09] took her because he wouldn't take her
[36:12] responsibility we'll read in a minute
[36:14] but he knew what was going to take place
[36:16] once this would happen he knew that she
[36:18] would even bear children right around
[36:20] and says we'll read that in a minute
[36:23] all right but was it a sex act or was it
[36:26] what
[36:27] see she should have been burned
[36:30] but Adam intervened taking her quickly
[36:32] to himself so that she could so she was
[36:35] safe but when this satanic religion has
[36:38] gone the full course of the ages there
[36:41] will be no one to intervene
[36:44] man
[36:45] watch
[36:47] you will be burned with her Seducer
[36:50] for the and her children and the
[36:52] Antichrist and Satan will all find their
[36:54] places in the Lake of Fire right
[36:58] so it will be a finality that will come
[37:00] to where that there'll be a destruction
[37:02] but what took care of it
[37:05] all right look at the next one we'll
[37:08] just give a little reading out of the
[37:09] way 1965 911 God's power to transform
[37:13] transform uh paragraph 83.
[37:18] and he talks about the coming down of
[37:20] what took place
[37:22] no more new hymn Adam knew his wife and
[37:24] she brought Kane and also by our Abel
[37:28] twins Satan was with her that morning
[37:33] Adam that afternoon
[37:38] now the next one really
[37:41] bring up the next one that's exactly
[37:43] what happened
[37:45] came that Satan that morning in the
[37:48] serpent
[37:49] and Adam that afternoon
[37:52] she had two children
[37:54] now
[37:56] seeing in the presence of God one second
[38:03] would mean you're destroyed
[38:06] so you've got a morning and evening I
[38:09] just brought them to worry that somebody
[38:10] come along and say well he grabbed her
[38:12] immediately
[38:14] well what are you going to say now
[38:19] I mean you're going to say there's only
[38:20] a second between the act of the Beast
[38:23] and the act with Adam one second she
[38:25] still didn't lost the whole story
[38:28] because it would still be the same
[38:30] problem right
[38:33] so it was evident live on the morning
[38:35] and an evening affair
[38:38] all right brother random went through
[38:40] and proved you know about the the woman
[38:43] having the black baby and the white baby
[38:44] and one was a lover in the morning one
[38:47] was on up in the day and a doctor said
[38:49] anywhere within a 24-hour period that
[38:51] they would come forth it could be twins
[38:54] from different fathers all right now so
[38:58] get the point of what I'm saying what
[39:00] took care of Eve
[39:02] before Adam
[39:04] took her and done as they want to say he
[39:06] done to save her
[39:13] it could not have been the sector right
[39:17] because it would be a half a day in
[39:18] between them
[39:20] all right you follow me amen just
[39:22] natural things that's why I like to
[39:24] think of things it's natural and just
[39:26] take it out
[39:27] and then let brother Brown just answer
[39:29] the question
[39:30] and let him show you what
[39:33] good place huh
[39:36] see then you wouldn't want to lay up on
[39:38] that because you're just going to that
[39:40] one thing
[39:42] look at the next one go away Jesus 1963.
[39:48] 1103.
[39:51] now God would have took her right there
[39:56] excuse me
[39:59] am I giving the wrong one go wake Jesus
[40:02] 63 1103
[40:04] 226
[40:06] now God would have took her life excuse
[40:09] me right there
[40:11] but he couldn't hurt her
[40:14] she's part of Abraham
[40:17] and he's not talking about Adam here
[40:18] don't let you I'm gonna talk about
[40:21] Abraham
[40:22] all right we're just getting this point
[40:23] in then we'll go back to Adam and Eve oh
[40:26] we'd be gone long ago if it was a part
[40:29] of Christ
[40:30] all the things that he's done and we
[40:33] went around and said it's telepathy it's
[40:36] this that or the other but he can't
[40:38] touch you see
[40:41] now y'all you study that people is
[40:44] making fun of brother rounds what he's
[40:45] talking about right
[40:47] right and he's saying God can't touch
[40:49] him people
[40:55] why can't God touch them people
[40:59] because of Christ
[41:01] those people were Christians it's not
[41:03] going to be accounted right come on
[41:05] right so what they're saying this to
[41:07] left the other thing but he can't touch
[41:08] you see Ralph can't touch you because
[41:11] you're part of Christ when you're born
[41:13] again see and he couldn't do it but it
[41:16] because it hurt Abraham his promise was
[41:20] to Abraham and Sarah is a part of
[41:22] Abraham and the church is a part of
[41:24] Christ the bride and he couldn't do it
[41:27] old though although her unbelief all
[41:31] right now
[41:34] so God can't touch Sarah because she's
[41:38] part
[41:39] yep of Abraham
[41:42] now
[41:44] not the biggest natural things but
[41:46] remember Abraham and Sarah lived
[41:50] together a long time
[41:54] and you know what I mean
[41:56] but there was no children
[41:58] right
[42:01] you agree all right they were together a
[42:03] long time with no children but surely
[42:04] you know what you're doing they live
[42:05] together okay yeah
[42:08] all right so then the point is is what
[42:11] well I took care of Sarah they went back
[42:14] up to Abraham and
[42:15] he
[42:17] or took care of Sarah was the fact
[42:20] that she was a part of Abraham
[42:23] and that would be then
[42:26] happened Christ in the church
[42:34] divorce 1965 221 in the morning service
[42:38] paragraph 245. why didn't Abraham why
[42:41] didn't God feel so we're sitting there
[42:42] denying and lying right in the face of
[42:44] God
[42:45] sitting there as a mortal man eating
[42:47] flesh eating bread drinking milk and he
[42:49] said why did Sarah life back there in
[42:52] the rough in the back behind him in the
[42:54] tent he had never seen her say this how
[42:57] can these things be she said oh I never
[43:01] said
[43:02] oh my tell God that he's a liar to his
[43:06] face he couldn't take her why she's a
[43:09] part of Abraham amen he couldn't hurt
[43:12] her without hurting Abraham
[43:14] and you see where you women belong I
[43:17] always pick that up
[43:19] all right
[43:21] but my point is one thing
[43:24] Abraham
[43:28] it wasn't no Act
[43:31] it was the fact that she was part of him
[43:33] right that's it amen exactly right that
[43:37] preserved her yes sir
[43:39] all right because the promise we just
[43:42] read was with Abraham
[43:47] now one of these days when Wade gets
[43:50] through with that I've got a question on
[43:52] marriage and divorce and I let him
[43:54] finish up his part before try to bring
[43:56] any on it but
[43:57] I want us one of these days to just get
[43:59] down and realize who we are where we're
[44:01] at man for man or woman for woman or
[44:03] what we are that's right and see you
[44:04] know what's going on in life and
[44:08] because you see he said they're used to
[44:11] women you see where you're at said you
[44:13] women to be like Sabra was
[44:15] adorned herself in Monster Pearl lived
[44:17] on this and true to her husband loving
[44:19] him so much that she called here him her
[44:22] Lord ruler ownership I don't like the
[44:26] joke that I'll that my wife would say
[44:28] well I call him Lord because my Lord I
[44:32] don't like that that's not a that's not
[44:34] a good uh Point that's making light of
[44:37] the word
[44:39] all right now
[44:41] if that be true
[44:44] that he couldn't hurt
[44:46] you know what about Adam and Eve
[44:50] okay go to number seven Ephesians Church
[44:52] age which is page 104 Church age book
[44:55] he said you actually go to one question
[44:57] it always brings up another
[45:00] now the word teaches us that if a woman
[45:02] leaves her husband and goes with another
[45:04] man she is an adulteress and is no
[45:06] longer married and the husband is not to
[45:09] take her back
[45:10] that word was true in Eden
[45:13] as it was true when Moses wrote it in
[45:17] the law
[45:18] but you see it was true in Eden as well
[45:21] as Moses wrote it in the law the word
[45:24] can't change so it would be the same
[45:26] today right
[45:28] Adam took her back he knew exactly what
[45:31] he was doing but he did it anyway she
[45:35] was a part of him and he was willing to
[45:37] take her responsibility upon himself
[45:41] he would not let her go so we've
[45:43] conceived by him he knew she would he
[45:47] knew exactly what would happen to the
[45:48] human race and he said the human race
[45:51] sold the human race and to sin that he
[45:55] might have Eve for he loved her that's
[45:58] right amen now
[46:00] love is the point not sex right
[46:04] that's right no I'm not a dummy I know
[46:06] what they did do finally we just read it
[46:08] here
[46:09] all right
[46:11] I mean they did finally have a
[46:13] relationship yet
[46:15] but that's not the point of saving it up
[46:17] amen
[46:18] the point is that he loved her amen
[46:22] all right
[46:23] now what would have happened I asked you
[46:26] a question
[46:27] now this way what would have happened
[46:30] had God destroyed Steve
[46:35] he could have raised up another one sure
[46:38] right
[46:40] right
[46:41] he could give her another to give Adam
[46:43] another right
[46:45] wow right
[46:49] but he didn't do it nope
[46:51] why because Adam
[46:54] stepped in amen
[46:57] which then would top crash
[47:01] not your sex act amen
[47:05] the love that he would have to take her
[47:07] responsibility upon himself right
[47:10] see God saw what it would take to save
[47:13] you and I
[47:14] amen and he accepted that point to die
[47:18] for you and I amen
[47:20] taking our responsibility upon himself
[47:24] amen he didn't you know sin became sin
[47:28] right right we might become the
[47:31] righteousness
[47:32] see but the love that he had amen look
[47:35] at the next one thirsting for Life 1957
[47:38] 6 30 or East 16th
[47:43] Adam forwarded his wife out a perfect
[47:45] type of Christ going with his the bride
[47:48] to take her sins
[47:50] and Adam took the sins of Eve and left
[47:52] the Garden of Eden not deceived but
[47:55] willingly walked out with her so was
[47:58] Christ not deceived Satan could not
[48:00] deceive him all right
[48:03] he came to Earth to die for you and I
[48:05] amen which Adam and Eve would be only
[48:07] the part of it
[48:10] just speaking of it right to where it
[48:12] would come forth all right
[48:14] but what's the point now not an act
[48:18] but a love
[48:20] me
[48:22] I love that Adam would have for his wife
[48:25] all right amen
[48:27] run around we ready to start with and he
[48:30] said that a woman runs out you know
[48:32] right she does something wrong
[48:35] he said she shouldn't be taken back
[48:37] that's right
[48:40] now that's his word
[48:43] you say well I'll take her back and type
[48:45] Christ
[48:47] now be careful
[48:49] I happen to work with a boy that
[48:52] he called his wife about and I'm not
[48:55] joking you know
[48:56] he called her about five times
[48:59] running around
[49:02] and he'd just forgive her and take her
[49:04] back
[49:06] and I just told him one day playing I
[49:08] said you you got more than you probably
[49:10] than I got me I said because maybe acts
[49:12] about three I might have quit right yeah
[49:16] I said that's I believe in forgiveness
[49:18] you know and doing it well it wound up
[49:22] that the old boy would just come over
[49:23] and live in his house while he was at
[49:25] work
[49:26] we were on the night shift you know and
[49:28] he just came over and I said now I just
[49:30] couldn't go that way period you know
[49:32] that wouldn't but my point is what
[49:37] we're going to use this as a twofold
[49:39] form
[49:43] what happened in the garden
[49:47] brother Brown said it was adultery
[49:52] I don't go into that because I know the
[49:54] doctrine is a doctoring in the message
[49:55] you know that fornication is before an
[49:59] adultery after brother Branham called
[50:01] what happened in the garden adultery you
[50:03] need for them need me to bring those to
[50:05] you Eve committed adultery right she had
[50:09] another husband instead of her husband
[50:12] Adam right
[50:13] and the worst off part of it is that she
[50:15] had an animal
[50:16] right not a not a man
[50:20] so that'd be that much worse
[50:22] right
[50:25] come on you don't think like that she
[50:27] had an animal she didn't have a
[50:29] that wasn't a man that was an animal
[50:31] look like a man
[50:34] but it was an animal
[50:37] could be a whole lot more forgiving for
[50:40] a woman having a
[50:42] man with Ronaldo right but you see Adam
[50:46] loved her that's right
[50:53] what I say it because that was the
[50:56] reason I brought the point to you yeah
[50:58] but around said
[51:00] Satan threw the serpent that morning
[51:04] and Adam that afternoon
[51:06] so there was a period of time
[51:09] what took care of Eve during that period
[51:11] of time right
[51:13] because she was a part of Adam right
[51:16] amen
[51:18] and for God to destroy these he would
[51:20] have been destroyed part of Adam
[51:24] and then you would not have had no
[51:25] Redemptive forms to be brought into
[51:28] being
[51:30] agree
[51:32] right
[51:33] then he would have to come down and die
[51:36] in our place amen not to have a
[51:38] relationship with us but the diner place
[51:42] and I've always told you
[51:46] because I found it out on the Jews you
[51:48] know
[51:49] that they believe that that circumcision
[51:52] of the man
[51:54] took care of what happened in the garden
[51:59] that's what you believe
[52:01] what do you know ain't it hard to end
[52:04] the world today they are groups of
[52:06] people maybe not in this message because
[52:08] it really hadn't heard this one tied
[52:09] into the message but I wouldn't say that
[52:11] it wasn't but they have the woman there
[52:14] and she must have sex acts with a
[52:16] preacher to where they can you know save
[52:18] them
[52:20] all right I know there is a lot in this
[52:22] message to where they do have a lot of
[52:24] things that happen but that's their
[52:26] business that's their Doctrine just went
[52:28] to that all right but do you get the
[52:31] point
[52:33] to me now the sex act that happened with
[52:35] Eve was a secondary point right
[52:38] it was not the major thing right
[52:41] the Act was secondary in other words it
[52:43] was a about it was a part of that or an
[52:46] attribute me
[52:50] it wasn't the the setback with Adam
[52:55] she would already destroyed she was
[52:57] through
[52:59] he didn't have the ACT to save her
[53:03] no
[53:03] he loved her right right
[53:07] and he saved her
[53:09] you remember I preached to you what took
[53:11] care of Adam and Eve while it was the
[53:14] point of both of them what took care of
[53:16] both of them
[53:18] from the time that the sin had been
[53:20] committed until God made the sacrifice
[53:24] right right amen remember God made the
[53:27] first sacrifice Adam didn't do it right
[53:30] amen God killed those animals and took
[53:33] the skins and gave them to Adam and Eve
[53:35] well I took care of them before then
[53:39] because Jesus Christ stood as a lamb
[53:41] slain before the foundation of the world
[53:43] and God was looking down at that land
[53:46] not looking at Adam and Eve
[53:49] and then when the ACT did take place he
[53:52] stepped down
[53:53] and killed the animals showing that the
[53:55] animal was the Frog the problem my
[53:57] brother when I said the animal was put
[53:59] under the curse all right now see what
[54:01] am I getting at it's the love
[54:05] not an act okay
[54:07] the love that Adam would have for Eve
[54:10] because the Bible said in Adam all died
[54:12] that's right amen saying Eve because he
[54:16] can just wipe her off and start it again
[54:20] but yet God looked down and saw and knew
[54:23] what Adam would do all right
[54:26] and then it would be his love that would
[54:29] spare his Wrath
[54:33] because she was part of him just like it
[54:36] would be with Abraham and Sarah that's
[54:39] right
[54:40] that it would be that Sarah was a part
[54:42] of Abraham right
[54:45] and he would have heard Abraham had he
[54:47] destroyed Sarah
[54:49] yep
[54:51] now
[54:53] I didn't write the book I just like to
[54:56] read it
[54:57] but adultery
[55:02] in the Old Testament and we're going to
[55:04] crack up on this when we get into Judah
[55:06] Tamar but we use it here
[55:09] according to Deuteronomy I got it
[55:11] written down somewhere and y'all get it
[55:12] in a minute
[55:13] that adultery
[55:16] it takes 10 Generations
[55:19] to breathe that out
[55:24] an illegitimate child
[55:26] could not come into the congregation for
[55:28] 10 Generations that's 400 years right
[55:30] right
[55:32] before they could come back into the
[55:34] congregation now that's what God thinks
[55:36] of adultery so look where you would put
[55:39] it if you tried to bring it back there
[55:41] and you'd have to admit that Adam that
[55:44] Eve and the Beast would bring forth
[55:46] adultery
[55:49] but what she done because wrong husband
[55:51] wrong person right taking somebody else
[55:54] instead of her husband right so let's
[55:56] just read this one now remember this
[55:57] we're going to read it again look at
[55:58] number nine
[56:01] this questions and answers book 2 64 8
[56:04] 23 evening
[56:06] 180 subscribe 186. dear brother Brown if
[56:10] a baby is born out of wedlock can this
[56:13] child ever be saved or going to rapture
[56:20] hey what's your
[56:23] I believe the child could be
[56:25] the child can't help what it what's been
[56:28] done that is true but I about going in
[56:31] the rapture
[56:33] save I'd say yes
[56:36] but in the Rapture it's a predestinated
[56:38] seed that goes in the Rapture and I
[56:40] can't believe that adultery was a
[56:43] predestinated seed do you understand
[56:49] read what's your profits right
[56:52] okay
[56:54] now I called up another thing
[56:57] there's people in this message that
[56:59] don't believe that you they believe you
[57:00] couldn't be saved unless you got a
[57:02] certain Landing juice right
[57:05] right if you come in at them you're okay
[57:07] if you come in the Beast you can't be
[57:08] saved all kind of leads using different
[57:10] things
[57:12] but now I can show you if you'd like it
[57:15] I didn't figure this had to be argued or
[57:17] quoted should be enough
[57:20] the ten Generations
[57:23] of the fact of the Old Testament the
[57:25] prophet of God said the blood of Jesus
[57:27] Christ took care of that right
[57:30] all right now
[57:32] a little legitimate child
[57:36] let's take what he's saying at just that
[57:37] point then we'll get back to the other
[57:39] part so that somebody comes along and
[57:41] maybe you're an illegitimate child
[57:44] maybe you know that your your mom and
[57:46] daddy wasn't married or
[57:51] do you want to talk about my righteous
[57:53] in general can you run it back ten
[57:56] Generations
[57:59] can you run it back 400 years
[58:08] I mean any of you on a crow
[58:11] we need to eat some Crow
[58:15] D you're going off on my mama I'm not
[58:18] throwing off on your mama my mother was
[58:20] a mother
[58:25] we've probably all been better off if
[58:27] you'd have took a man after my daddy
[58:28] died
[58:30] unless you made a bad guy you know
[58:34] but listen
[58:37] what if you're an illegitimate child
[58:38] today well if you're sitting there
[58:39] knowing that in your genealogies
[58:44] this one brother was saying something
[58:45] about that one time and I said brother
[58:48] mode I said why is that brother so
[58:50] strong when that he said I don't know
[58:51] either he said but I know there is some
[58:54] possibilities in this lineage
[58:56] maybe he was trying to find somebody
[58:58] that could find an answer
[59:00] to hit me all right
[59:02] go to how many of you could think back
[59:04] 400 years that's right
[59:06] ten Generations because 40 years to a
[59:09] generation right
[59:10] right
[59:12] you think you could capture yourself
[59:13] pure
[59:16] like I told you when they sent us over
[59:18] here on the Mayflower you know I don't
[59:20] think they sent the good people over
[59:21] here
[59:23] I think they got rid of the scum
[59:26] because they were figuring most of them
[59:28] going to get killed
[59:29] so they didn't send to good people
[59:32] all right astonished
[59:35] that's why I say the black people they
[59:37] can run their genealogies back
[59:40] that's why people ain't nothing but a
[59:42] concoction they they call it Caucasian I
[59:45] call it concoction
[59:47] but we don't know where we come from
[59:49] amen amen that's right and who's who
[59:55] but what is the possibility what is it
[59:58] right say that you know that your
[1:00:00] genealogy was wrong
[1:00:01] another rabbit said the blood of Jesus
[1:00:04] Christ takes care of that if you have
[1:00:06] the new birth
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:11] if you don't have the new birth the Old
[1:00:13] Testament law still applies
[1:00:15] that's where people don't believe me on
[1:00:17] that they think the New Testament well
[1:00:19] you may win the New Testament
[1:00:21] but
[1:00:29] that's all right
[1:00:31] but you see
[1:00:34] if you're not born again tonight you're
[1:00:36] still under the law right man and the
[1:00:38] ten generation Point still applies
[1:00:43] but if you're born again
[1:00:47] the illegitimacy is gone amen right
[1:00:50] a baby look what the prophet's saying
[1:00:52] I'm explaining this for what 40 years
[1:00:59] a baby that's born right now
[1:01:03] illegitimate
[1:01:08] you don't think about it going in the
[1:01:10] Rapture but remember all badges go to
[1:01:12] heaven anyway babies right go to heaven
[1:01:14] anyway
[1:01:15] don't worry about it
[1:01:17] but if we ain't babies right
[1:01:20] all right we're old enough to understand
[1:01:22] right if we don't have the new birth
[1:01:25] we're all illegitimate from Eve that's
[1:01:27] what your Prophet said he said he was a
[1:01:30] hybrid whether you like to hear those
[1:01:31] words or not run it in your computer he
[1:01:34] said I'm a hybrid he said every man's
[1:01:36] born between watching Eve and
[1:01:42] he said eve and Satan
[1:01:48] because they're all born from a sex act
[1:01:50] right
[1:01:51] then you want to make a sex act a
[1:01:53] preservative
[1:01:56] it won't work
[1:01:58] but you see
[1:02:00] you get born again today
[1:02:03] that ends that visited iniquity
[1:02:06] right amen and he ends that law
[1:02:10] and I'll state it again where you make
[1:02:12] sure to understand me if you're not born
[1:02:15] again you you are still under the law
[1:02:18] because my Bible says what Christ is the
[1:02:23] end of the law
[1:02:25] what for righteousness right
[1:02:30] over the rest of it
[1:02:32] what to those that are saved in other
[1:02:34] words preparation
[1:02:36] yep you're not saved today you're still
[1:02:38] under the law right
[1:02:41] and then you ask people to turn to the
[1:02:42] first book of the New Testament turn to
[1:02:44] Matthew Matthew Mark Luke and John the
[1:02:46] law was still in existence
[1:02:48] Jesus was under the law he healed people
[1:02:52] and told him to go make the sacrifice of
[1:02:54] Moses
[1:02:57] yep
[1:02:58] the New Testament begins in the book of
[1:03:00] Acts amen
[1:03:02] amen put us into the body of Christ
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:06] listen I don't understand that we'll go
[1:03:08] back and listen to the text again and
[1:03:09] said it two or three times
[1:03:11] but you see Church
[1:03:14] he said the Rapture is it's a
[1:03:17] predestinated seed that goes in the
[1:03:18] rapture
[1:03:20] if you're born again
[1:03:24] all right if you're born again there had
[1:03:27] to be something predestinated somewhere
[1:03:30] right if you're born again
[1:03:33] if you're not you don't have to worry
[1:03:34] about anything
[1:03:36] you're still under the law
[1:03:39] no brother damn you don't understand
[1:03:42] Jesus died
[1:03:45] I told you what a man said about me one
[1:03:47] time and I asked him a question
[1:03:50] and I asked him a blunt question of what
[1:03:52] he thought about me as a minister
[1:03:54] and mine you know me
[1:03:57] when she believed he was way one up this
[1:03:59] way but I asked him a simple question I
[1:04:03] said where do you think I stand
[1:04:06] he said you ain't no more in the badges
[1:04:11] now I've explained this or some of you
[1:04:13] know what I mean but most of you don't
[1:04:16] what was he meaning you're no more than
[1:04:18] a badges
[1:04:20] you ever talk to a good Baptist you ever
[1:04:22] talked to Presbyterian
[1:04:27] and you asked him said how do you know
[1:04:29] you're born again
[1:04:31] what's your answer
[1:04:34] come on what's the answer they never
[1:04:37] talk about an experience
[1:04:39] they say this they say Jesus come on the
[1:04:43] day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came and
[1:04:46] I got it
[1:04:47] because it come two thousand years ago
[1:04:50] now does that make you with a new birth
[1:04:54] nope come on George what are you saying
[1:04:56] that I could take the Bible and the
[1:04:59] prophet's message and by my intellect be
[1:05:02] able to put it together until I would
[1:05:04] say like run around them I'm not saying
[1:05:06] the Lord's coming I'm saying he's here
[1:05:08] right amen
[1:05:09] and that I was only saying it because he
[1:05:12] said it
[1:05:13] right and I wouldn't say it that way
[1:05:16] and I went back up here to preach to him
[1:05:18] and when he did he changed his mind
[1:05:21] because I preached a message on
[1:05:23] manifestation
[1:05:25] and he saw the truth
[1:05:27] all right but listen
[1:05:32] you just understand what I'm trying to
[1:05:33] say then I'll get back on the point
[1:05:37] if you are born again
[1:05:41] the illegitimate childhood doesn't apply
[1:05:43] right right
[1:05:47] because it was ended in Jesus Christ
[1:05:49] coming and living in you
[1:05:52] so then you can go into rapture
[1:05:54] so don't be afraid I can't go into
[1:05:56] Rapture because I'm an illegitimate
[1:05:57] child
[1:05:58] I've told you over and over and I'll
[1:06:01] tell you one more time
[1:06:03] I don't care if I could run my DNA
[1:06:06] all the way
[1:06:09] you're called to be standing there and
[1:06:11] calling Daddy
[1:06:13] you know
[1:06:16] that new birth that I received in 1969
[1:06:19] took care of that
[1:06:21] if you can't believe it that way you
[1:06:24] don't have the new birth is the best way
[1:06:25] to put it
[1:06:27] you got to believe me on All Odds are
[1:06:29] all situation draw a thing of life
[1:06:34] and then don't worry about the
[1:06:35] illegitimacy but now put it back with a
[1:06:38] promise
[1:06:40] the Rapture comes
[1:06:46] a little legitimate value it's not going
[1:06:48] in the Rapture right
[1:06:50] you know a literal literal ill just
[1:06:52] gentleman baby
[1:06:53] a baby's not going in the rapture
[1:06:56] that's what he say
[1:06:59] it's not going
[1:07:01] well because it's an adulteress night
[1:07:06] but I believe and always happily
[1:07:11] look join Rachel
[1:07:14] there got two kids coming up to the age
[1:07:17] of accountability because we don't know
[1:07:18] what that is that's up to them
[1:07:22] but the little baby gets here you know
[1:07:27] I don't believe Jordan Rachel is going
[1:07:29] to go into Rapture and leave the baby
[1:07:30] here for somebody else to raise now if
[1:07:32] you believe that I understand you just
[1:07:34] blame me call me stupid crazy all you
[1:07:36] want to I just don't believe it I
[1:07:38] believe that baby's going with them
[1:07:40] because it's a baby but it's not
[1:07:42] illegitimate
[1:07:45] whatever little sex act that some flame
[1:07:47] has out here and you say well well I've
[1:07:48] got kids over there that I had they're
[1:07:50] illegitimate but they're saved because
[1:07:52] they're legitimate they're not going to
[1:07:53] do it all right
[1:07:54] they might have to come to the New Birth
[1:07:56] amen
[1:07:57] and any child no matter what whether
[1:08:00] your kids were pureborn or what they are
[1:08:03] they're gonna have to come to the New
[1:08:05] Birth not because mama and daddy
[1:08:09] okay is that fine enough everybody
[1:08:11] understand that if you don't ask me a
[1:08:13] question about it sometime but what does
[1:08:15] he say adultery
[1:08:19] is wrong Amanda
[1:08:21] So Adam and Eve in the garden
[1:08:24] now listen
[1:08:27] Eve had an affair with the Beast that
[1:08:30] was adultery right
[1:08:32] Adam took her back that made him part of
[1:08:35] the adultery right
[1:08:39] it's not on that husband's wife
[1:08:41] now
[1:08:43] now because
[1:08:45] wow he was not supposed to take her back
[1:08:51] but he did because he loved her and God
[1:08:53] honored that
[1:08:56] not no sex act
[1:08:57] man he honored that point that Adam
[1:09:01] loved her
[1:09:03] and he saw from that exactly what he was
[1:09:05] going to do right that he was going to
[1:09:08] come down and die
[1:09:11] to give his life
[1:09:13] to take up on him our sin
[1:09:17] that he could make us his righteousness
[1:09:20] all right all right bro you following me
[1:09:23] yes not a sex act but an act of love
[1:09:28] an act of love
[1:09:30] had God went in and destroyed Adam
[1:09:33] he I mean he he would have been
[1:09:36] destroying part of Adam
[1:09:38] same thing as it was with Abraham and
[1:09:41] Sarah right
[1:09:44] I'll say this about you sisters the
[1:09:46] weights in there last night
[1:09:48] in a woman can't be circumcised
[1:09:51] so in the Old testament's Law
[1:09:55] she had no rights whatsoever
[1:09:58] right
[1:10:00] you got no lineage
[1:10:04] she's not even counted in the league
[1:10:06] I'm not now come on listen vote I got a
[1:10:08] little chance I could read okay the wife
[1:10:11] of so-and-so with so-and-so you know all
[1:10:14] right
[1:10:15] but she has no lineage
[1:10:18] when Naomi came back to the land
[1:10:23] she could not type her property back
[1:10:29] agree right right Boaz had to be the and
[1:10:32] then she had the other Kinsman and all
[1:10:34] that had to be settled and took care of
[1:10:35] boys took
[1:10:39] the place as a Kinsmen
[1:10:42] and he didn't live with Naomi no no no
[1:10:44] no no
[1:10:47] but he took Ruth
[1:10:49] but as quick as the baby was born and
[1:10:51] we're going to get down to a narrow
[1:10:53] point on this in a minute
[1:10:54] quick as that baby was born it was taken
[1:10:57] and given right into the hands
[1:11:01] come Naomi yep and what was the man's
[1:11:05] name was all the lights not trying to
[1:11:06] figure out image is it what uh emilick
[1:11:10] you know was the one that uh Ruth was
[1:11:13] married to
[1:11:17] Naomi was married too in other words the
[1:11:19] lineage went back when the child was
[1:11:22] born from Ruth and Boaz that child was
[1:11:24] counted to the lineage right
[1:11:27] sure a Naomi's husband so they could
[1:11:29] redeem the property
[1:11:31] and that his name not diminished
[1:11:34] I'm off the Earth Yep all right
[1:11:38] see that it was made into the right
[1:11:40] order amen an act of love amen all right
[1:11:44] now you see what I'm talking about
[1:11:48] let's read what this one says here so
[1:11:50] that again right down underneath
[1:11:53] notice
[1:11:54] but now in the Old Testament we're still
[1:11:56] reading from 64 questions and answers
[1:11:58] but now in the Old Testament when a baby
[1:12:01] was born a bastard child it could not
[1:12:03] enter even entered the congregation of
[1:12:05] the Lord for 10 Generations 400 and
[1:12:08] something years that curse was so bad
[1:12:10] just think of that an innocent baby it's
[1:12:14] great great great great great great new
[1:12:16] name all them great structure great
[1:12:18] great job just think the baby's great
[1:12:21] great kenjit great grandchildren could
[1:12:25] not even come in the congregation of God
[1:12:27] that's right
[1:12:29] he said that's strong
[1:12:33] see adultery had to be cleansed
[1:12:39] right right amen it can only be done by
[1:12:45] doing What God Says
[1:12:49] all right
[1:12:51] so it wouldn't be an Adam and Eve but I
[1:12:53] just want to get that point so when we
[1:12:54] read a few more
[1:12:56] what do you see what I'm talking about
[1:12:57] anybody got any points you want to say
[1:12:59] something about it
[1:13:03] and he took her sin but Jesus Christ
[1:13:06] loved you and I and he took our sin
[1:13:09] right amen no sex act involved a love
[1:13:14] that he had because he knew that he
[1:13:17] didn't she was dead right right and you
[1:13:20] know that's according to the law
[1:13:22] Mormon family and adultery she's
[1:13:24] supposed to be stoned
[1:13:26] that's right
[1:13:28] right
[1:13:29] That's the Law right
[1:13:32] her husband had to be the one to put
[1:13:34] forth the first stone
[1:13:37] right
[1:13:40] now in that him being the one that would
[1:13:44] be the typing
[1:13:46] he has to do the first stone you can't
[1:13:48] Stone them remember she lost one of her
[1:13:50] pieces of Red Band they didn't take her
[1:13:52] around and kill her right
[1:13:54] they waited until her husband came home
[1:13:56] he catched the first time
[1:14:00] if you can't see it all kind of Hitler I
[1:14:02] don't know what in the world you do with
[1:14:03] it that's why God had the house
[1:14:06] Mary already engaged
[1:14:09] to Joseph
[1:14:13] to protect her
[1:14:17] I mean with no sex act involved with
[1:14:20] Joseph and Mary that's right amen
[1:14:23] but the fact that she was his espoused
[1:14:26] yep amen she was supposed to have been
[1:14:29] stoned she was found with child
[1:14:32] yep
[1:14:34] so
[1:14:36] the law would have brought it but Joseph
[1:14:39] took her
[1:14:43] but he didn't live with her until the
[1:14:44] baby was born That's my boy okay so it
[1:14:48] ain't sex acts
[1:14:49] you following me that's right
[1:14:52] just a love right The Binding of a force
[1:14:56] the prophet called it when to start
[1:14:57] already a union
[1:15:00] between man and wife
[1:15:03] a love of fire amen
[1:15:10] might sit somewhere last night about it
[1:15:12] and I know this brother one time he
[1:15:13] asked me a question he said you've heard
[1:15:15] me say this he asked me a question he
[1:15:16] said if you had to give up your children
[1:15:19] or give up your wife which would you do
[1:15:20] I said to give up my children
[1:15:25] I didn't pause I said give up my
[1:15:27] children right right he said I wouldn't
[1:15:32] looking for George
[1:15:34] but I would I said with my wife the time
[1:15:37] he'd asked me she was still capable I
[1:15:39] sit with my wife we could have had more
[1:15:41] children right
[1:15:43] but do away with my wife you're doing
[1:15:44] away with part of me right man and I
[1:15:48] said then I'll stay with my wife right
[1:15:50] yeah man you know because of the love
[1:15:52] but are you following me now I'm just
[1:15:53] going to that point okay
[1:15:56] what took place was
[1:15:59] the fact that he loved her
[1:16:03] not
[1:16:04] an act of the wrong thing right
[1:16:08] now let's cover this next while we're at
[1:16:10] it
[1:16:14] a lot has been said about Judah and
[1:16:15] Tamar if you want to go ahead and turn
[1:16:17] over in the scriptures
[1:16:20] turn to uh Genesis 38.
[1:16:25] and a lot has been said and even said
[1:16:28] here
[1:16:29] that
[1:16:30] you know
[1:16:33] maybe not the literal wording
[1:16:36] but the implication
[1:16:39] that
[1:16:42] God would not destroy Tamar because she
[1:16:45] had the seed of Judah
[1:16:50] in her womb
[1:16:53] and that was the implication
[1:16:57] and the same ones who make that
[1:16:59] implication always tie together Adam and
[1:17:01] Eve and Juden Tamar
[1:17:06] okay
[1:17:08] now just remember so we won't have to
[1:17:10] read it again
[1:17:11] the last one we read was questions and
[1:17:14] answers 64. paragraph 186 that
[1:17:19] adultery
[1:17:22] is not a predestinated seed
[1:17:28] okay
[1:17:29] so remember that now
[1:17:32] and let's see what happened with Judah
[1:17:34] and Tamar
[1:17:36] okay
[1:17:40] so I'm going to start reading and I
[1:17:42] found something rarely in here that I
[1:17:43] really it was in the Bible that I didn't
[1:17:45] know it was here
[1:17:46] let's start with verse six
[1:17:49] Genesis 38 I don't know where
[1:17:52] have to pull that one up but I just got
[1:17:54] one I wanted to pull up in a minute okay
[1:17:56] okay wherever he's back here
[1:17:59] and Judah took a while for her
[1:18:02] oh no go back to verse five
[1:18:06] um better go back to verse three okay
[1:18:09] all right
[1:18:11] Judas
[1:18:13] so there was a daughter of a certain
[1:18:14] Canaanite verse two whose name was
[1:18:18] and he took her and went in unto her all
[1:18:22] right and she conceived and bearishun
[1:18:24] and he called his name or I guess you
[1:18:27] said ER number one child okay not him
[1:18:30] and she conceived again and by her son
[1:18:32] and she called his name 09 number two
[1:18:35] okay
[1:18:37] and yet again conceived in by our son
[1:18:39] and called his name Shiva
[1:18:42] three
[1:18:43] okay
[1:18:45] and he tells where he was at when she
[1:18:47] burned
[1:18:48] and Judah took a while for her
[1:18:51] his firstborn
[1:18:53] whose name was Tamar
[1:18:56] and er judah's firstborn was wicked in
[1:18:59] the sight of the Lord and the Lord flew
[1:19:02] it
[1:19:04] all right 40 children was involved
[1:19:08] not saying they weren't together as
[1:19:09] husband and wife but before there was
[1:19:11] any children
[1:19:12] God took her out of the way because he
[1:19:15] was wicked
[1:19:16] all right verse 8.
[1:19:19] and Judah said unto oh man go in unto
[1:19:22] thy brother's wife and marry her and
[1:19:24] raise up seed to thy brother remember
[1:19:26] what we're talking about Ruth and Naomi
[1:19:28] and the thing because we'll read it
[1:19:30] right here see if you've done that and
[1:19:32] you took a wife
[1:19:34] you know if you had a child you had to
[1:19:36] give it to the cabara to that woman you
[1:19:39] know to work when the child would go
[1:19:40] back to that seat where it wouldn't
[1:19:41] diminish right you know it wouldn't go
[1:19:44] off the Earth right in other words it
[1:19:46] wouldn't be your child right Ruth and
[1:19:48] Boaz it was their child
[1:19:50] it was put over Ash to belong in the so
[1:19:52] and so that the lineage would carry
[1:19:54] across
[1:19:55] and keep it going so look what happened
[1:19:58] so he was wicked verse seven and he died
[1:20:01] and Judah said unto Onan go in unto thy
[1:20:04] brother's wife and marry her and raise
[1:20:06] up seed to thy brother
[1:20:08] and Onan knew that the seed should not
[1:20:11] be his and it came to pass when he went
[1:20:14] into his brother's wife that he spilled
[1:20:17] It On The Ground lest that he should
[1:20:19] give seed to his brother see I knew that
[1:20:23] was in the Bible what I didn't know it
[1:20:24] was going to be in this deodorant Tamar
[1:20:25] until I got to read okay everybody knows
[1:20:28] that's in there you know about spilling
[1:20:30] of the seed on the ground but now watch
[1:20:33] and the thing which he did displeased
[1:20:35] the Lord wherefore he slew him also
[1:20:38] number two guys are gone you know all
[1:20:40] right
[1:20:41] and then said Judah to Tamar his
[1:20:43] daughter-in-law
[1:20:44] remain a widow at my father's house
[1:20:48] till she left my son be grown
[1:20:51] for he said let's pray Adventure he died
[1:20:53] also as his brother did and Tamar went
[1:20:56] and dwelt in her father's house all
[1:20:58] right so Judah says all right now what
[1:21:01] you do
[1:21:02] I'm afraid that an unlaw's two boys
[1:21:06] I'm afraid I'm gonna lose the other one
[1:21:08] she'll kind of give a little time you
[1:21:10] know and go stay in the house when he
[1:21:13] probably had full intentions and never
[1:21:14] to let her marry
[1:21:16] let him marry Tamar right because he
[1:21:19] didn't do it
[1:21:21] right
[1:21:22] he didn't go let her marry
[1:21:25] Tamar
[1:21:27] all right but now watch watch that took
[1:21:29] place
[1:21:32] and in the process of time the daughter
[1:21:34] of Schumer judah's wife died
[1:21:38] and Judah was comforted and went unto
[1:21:40] his sheep cheers that's Judith wife now
[1:21:44] in two minutes
[1:21:46] he and his friend hire him the uh
[1:21:49] dolomite
[1:21:51] and it was told hey Marcia and behold
[1:21:53] thy father-in-law going to go up to
[1:21:57] timoth you pronounce the words I can't
[1:21:59] I'm sorry to assure his sheep and she
[1:22:02] put her Winner's garment off of her and
[1:22:05] covered her face with a veil and wrapped
[1:22:07] herself and said in an open place we
[1:22:09] should by the way
[1:22:10] dude Gemini first you saw that Sheila
[1:22:13] was grown
[1:22:15] number three boy he done grown up
[1:22:18] and she was not given unto him for wife
[1:22:21] you're going to read the rest of it
[1:22:23] Judah went in to Tamar not knowing that
[1:22:28] that was Tamar he thought it was just an
[1:22:31] old Harley
[1:22:33] and she conceived all right remember she
[1:22:36] asked to sign because he didn't have the
[1:22:38] the kid with it the goats you know with
[1:22:40] it so she asked the sign and he gave her
[1:22:43] the signals sometimes and then she kept
[1:22:45] it and then she disappears and when it
[1:22:47] goes on reading when it gets down that
[1:22:49] finally they go tell Judah that uh Tamar
[1:22:52] is pregnant
[1:22:54] he said bring her in you will kill her
[1:22:58] well when she come up before she got
[1:23:01] there standing his presence she said
[1:23:03] just take these in there and give it to
[1:23:04] him and said this is the guy that's the
[1:23:06] father or the child that I have
[1:23:09] right so Judah says that she's more
[1:23:12] righteous than he is
[1:23:14] all right
[1:23:15] now
[1:23:16] first off to you on the internet system
[1:23:19] go ahead
[1:23:20] run around never uses the way we're
[1:23:22] Tamar
[1:23:24] it's in the Bible 30 something times but
[1:23:27] his brother Brown never uses the word
[1:23:28] Tamar he uses the illustration only one
[1:23:33] time
[1:23:34] did he use the illustration
[1:23:37] about it and he used it in questions and
[1:23:41] answers on Hebrews number 3 1957 1006.
[1:23:47] in paragraph 693 through 696 and he
[1:23:52] explains what happened in this situation
[1:23:56] you know about the Harlot and the the
[1:24:00] doings and what he's what she had done
[1:24:02] but he never emphasized this to read it
[1:24:04] going to find it we've got it right
[1:24:06] there if you want it that you know
[1:24:10] it winds up never saying anything
[1:24:13] about her being this or that or the
[1:24:16] other or him being whatever right
[1:24:19] right all right
[1:24:21] but you see the emphasis that Brothers
[1:24:23] put up on using Judah and Tamar that I
[1:24:27] understand they're saying
[1:24:29] they're saying that Judah and Tamar was
[1:24:32] the only way that God could bring the
[1:24:34] lineage down of Judah
[1:24:39] all right
[1:24:41] but I'm sorry you've missed it amen
[1:24:45] because
[1:24:47] Judah had another son named Silver law
[1:24:50] says Sheila I already pronounce it right
[1:24:52] and he brought four seed to Judah right
[1:24:56] and it wound up being in the Bible if
[1:24:58] you want them
[1:24:59] that his descendants wound up being the
[1:25:03] uh
[1:25:06] s-h-e-l-a-m-i-t-e-s
[1:25:11] all right
[1:25:13] and you'll find that in numbers 26.
[1:25:17] not verse 20. First Chronicles 1 18 and
[1:25:21] First Chronicles 2 21 that it brings
[1:25:24] down to showing that that Judah did have
[1:25:28] descendants of his name so his name
[1:25:30] would not have diminished because he
[1:25:32] would have carried it on right
[1:25:34] but I agree with their point of one
[1:25:37] thing
[1:25:38] from Judah and Tamar came forth Perez
[1:25:41] remember how do you pronounce it
[1:25:44] p-h-a-r-e-z and
[1:25:48] t-e-h-a-t-e-r-a-h because remember they
[1:25:50] were twins
[1:25:54] all right so the point is that what
[1:25:57] they're saying is that that was the way
[1:25:58] to get the lineage to come to Dave
[1:26:02] because David does come from there
[1:26:03] Solomon comes from there Boaz comes from
[1:26:06] there
[1:26:07] but their point was that it was brought
[1:26:09] down to extend the lineage of
[1:26:12] Judah to where David could come into
[1:26:14] being
[1:26:16] and it is perfectly true
[1:26:19] that David being coming from the tribe
[1:26:22] of Judah
[1:26:23] David being a man after God's Own Heart
[1:26:25] and I'm quoting scriptures and then in
[1:26:28] that room at respect
[1:26:34] and there's no promise that Christ would
[1:26:37] come from any other tribe
[1:26:40] he was not promised to come from Levi
[1:26:44] he was promised to come from the line of
[1:26:46] Judah which would be the tribe of Judah
[1:26:49] come on all right
[1:26:52] but see they're saying that that would
[1:26:53] be the only way to carry it down
[1:26:58] but now just remember Judah and Tamar is
[1:27:01] adultery right anybody would admit that
[1:27:08] right
[1:27:09] Judah was supposed to have given his son
[1:27:14] but when Judah and Tamar had the
[1:27:16] relationship it was a dog treat right
[1:27:18] right
[1:27:20] no she was promised to his son
[1:27:25] not the Judah
[1:27:27] come on read your Bible we read it in
[1:27:29] there Judah said we'll buy it until this
[1:27:32] boy gets old enough she said the boy's
[1:27:35] old enough and he ain't Giver Give In to
[1:27:37] Me
[1:27:38] that was her husband
[1:27:40] she had an act with a Judah
[1:27:45] and they brought an adulterous hat
[1:27:49] two children fell forth from that
[1:27:52] sure it extended to lineage
[1:27:55] but get the point you didn't have to
[1:27:57] extend the lineage because should I ever
[1:27:59] apronounce it
[1:28:01] he was a descended straight from Judah
[1:28:03] which his lineage went on
[1:28:06] all right
[1:28:07] right but did he come to David is the
[1:28:10] point
[1:28:13] that David would be the one
[1:28:16] okay but remember now it's an adulteress
[1:28:19] Act
[1:28:23] see then you can't make an adulterous
[1:28:25] act be a predestinated seed
[1:28:27] that's right it'll get away from your
[1:28:29] natural acts of the Old Testament
[1:28:31] you better get away because what we're
[1:28:33] fixing the code the William Brothers
[1:28:35] Jones Pull up The Book of Ruth
[1:28:39] the Aaron and I were talking about this
[1:28:40] while ago and I mentioned it to him and
[1:28:43] then already had it written down to use
[1:28:45] the scriptures but I want you to look at
[1:28:47] something
[1:28:51] and I want you to remember
[1:28:54] all right
[1:28:57] we gave the quotes in the prophet
[1:29:02] if it was an adulteressed act
[1:29:05] child couldn't come into this
[1:29:07] Congregation of the righteous
[1:29:09] for 10 Generations
[1:29:12] 400 years
[1:29:14] right he said there was nothing
[1:29:18] that could take that away you're in the
[1:29:19] Old Testament you're not coming to the
[1:29:21] New Testament now get back on the Old
[1:29:22] Testament with me there was nothing back
[1:29:24] there that could take it out
[1:29:26] it had to be bred out right
[1:29:29] yeah I want you to notice something very
[1:29:33] accurate on the bottom
[1:29:38] all right
[1:29:40] Perez was an illegitimate child
[1:29:44] remember how you pronounce that name
[1:29:46] come on that's right
[1:29:48] okay count with me
[1:29:51] Perez
[1:29:54] yeah
[1:29:56] he had a son by the name of
[1:29:58] his arm
[1:30:00] he's only got rain
[1:30:03] begotten amble of a dead right pronounce
[1:30:06] it
[1:30:07] now Sean we got five right
[1:30:11] hey Sean they got Solomon
[1:30:15] gentlemen
[1:30:17] he begotten boys
[1:30:21] be dry oh bad
[1:30:24] oh bad we got Jesse
[1:30:27] and Jesse but got David 10 Generations
[1:30:32] perfect God bled it out amen
[1:30:36] it's not the genealogies of carrying it
[1:30:38] on
[1:30:39] right that doesn't make any difference
[1:30:42] it's what God done all right
[1:30:45] he bled it out to David
[1:30:47] the word David could be of the line of
[1:30:49] the tribe of Judah
[1:30:53] for the Tim generation
[1:30:58] see
[1:31:00] it's not sex in the garden
[1:31:02] it was love in the garden and God
[1:31:05] promising to fulfill his word
[1:31:10] that he would raise up a people even in
[1:31:13] the acts of adultery
[1:31:16] from Adam and Eve he would raise up with
[1:31:19] people amen
[1:31:20] he would come down and make a way
[1:31:23] and even in his natural way
[1:31:27] he would count it off from Perez
[1:31:31] coming from Judah Tamar not because it
[1:31:34] was in the wound of Tamar
[1:31:38] no but because he would use it from that
[1:31:42] and bring it to 10 Generations
[1:31:45] all right Christ could come from David
[1:31:49] right amen
[1:31:52] Christ could come from David
[1:31:55] now we know he never come from David
[1:31:57] natural right amen but David was the
[1:32:01] promise
[1:32:05] David's son Solomon would sit on his
[1:32:08] throne which was a type of Christ
[1:32:11] so it bled out through David
[1:32:15] the promise of God his word
[1:32:20] and what was his word in Genesis I'll
[1:32:22] put enmity between thy seeds and the
[1:32:25] seed of the woman right I'll put the
[1:32:28] female woman down
[1:32:31] that would be Jesus Christ to take away
[1:32:33] the skin of mankind amen
[1:32:38] sure Judith Tamar extended the lineage
[1:32:40] of death of of
[1:32:42] Judah
[1:32:43] through their act
[1:32:45] God turned around and bled it out of him
[1:32:49] and brought Solomon into existence
[1:32:52] to be a perfect type of Christ
[1:32:55] David was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:32:59] and the Bible says that from not from
[1:33:01] any lineage of of it's not from the
[1:33:04] lineage of Levi the scripture says
[1:33:07] he said but one were and I'm
[1:33:09] paraphrasing it it is not even mentioned
[1:33:14] to come from Judah
[1:33:17] right
[1:33:18] down through David
[1:33:21] yes
[1:33:23] right but not because of sex acts but
[1:33:26] because of a promise
[1:33:29] that's right you and I are not dependent
[1:33:32] I'm not on some sex actor to try to save
[1:33:34] or to whatever happened in the garden
[1:33:36] that's right thank you Lord I'm trying
[1:33:39] to depend on the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:33:42] that made a way amen and he said I'll
[1:33:45] put enmity between thy seed and the seed
[1:33:47] of the woman amen that's good I'll take
[1:33:49] care of it yeah one of these days I want
[1:33:51] to preach on Abraham's unconditional
[1:33:53] Covenant because if it can't be brought
[1:33:55] out of Genesis over there with Abraham
[1:33:56] and Adam and Eve then you can't come up
[1:33:58] with an unconditional Covenant you'll
[1:34:00] have a garbage can running around
[1:34:02] because you think Abraham's
[1:34:04] unconditional Covenant which
[1:34:07] doesn't matter what Abraham does I'm
[1:34:08] Gonna Save him anyway
[1:34:11] wow is that the course where the Prophet
[1:34:12] said that
[1:34:15] well if that be true then don't think
[1:34:17] whatever we do we just live like a devil
[1:34:19] because we're going to heaven anyway
[1:34:23] thank you
[1:34:27] did you see Church
[1:34:29] an intersection act right
[1:34:31] it's a promise of God
[1:34:34] he said what he'd do
[1:34:38] Judah didn't keep his word
[1:34:40] but God kept hears amen
[1:34:42] and he said I'll just bleed that out
[1:34:46] and I'll bring it down
[1:34:49] the word that I can bring Christ right
[1:34:51] from the lineage of David
[1:34:55] but just don't think now that I'm saying
[1:34:57] that Boaz and all of them others before
[1:34:59] I couldn't enter the congregation of the
[1:35:01] righteous no
[1:35:04] they did
[1:35:07] it's just a story of natural typing
[1:35:12] to where you use it
[1:35:15] because of Boaz was a type of Christ
[1:35:19] it's just using it as a story of
[1:35:21] understanding by staying together
[1:35:25] like on these things
[1:35:28] what kind of an Act was it it was an act
[1:35:31] of love from God that he loved us all
[1:35:34] right amen right and he made a way amen
[1:35:38] now let me put one more in there you
[1:35:40] know that in the Bible that a man that
[1:35:43] was like that with 10 generations to an
[1:35:45] illegitimate child right
[1:35:47] he couldn't come back into the
[1:35:48] congregation right now he could come out
[1:35:50] into the kind of the outer Court sector
[1:35:52] you know he could he could dwell out
[1:35:54] there he could bring his offerings he
[1:35:56] could do his things
[1:35:57] but he couldn't go in
[1:35:59] for the congregation the righteous
[1:36:02] that's right but you know what the Bible
[1:36:03] says about a man just wounded in his
[1:36:05] Stone
[1:36:11] do you know the Bible says man's wounded
[1:36:14] in his Stones he can never come into the
[1:36:15] congregation nope that's right
[1:36:19] stones are Revelations right it ain't
[1:36:22] talking about natural things folks
[1:36:25] is talking about physical things there
[1:36:27] because of what it taught
[1:36:31] come on we can stay a long time on it
[1:36:34] you know that if a woman and a woman was
[1:36:36] trying to protect her husband
[1:36:41] you know somebody beating her husband up
[1:36:43] and a woman goes in to protect her
[1:36:45] husband is she grabs the guy in the
[1:36:48] wrong place they cut her arm off hand
[1:36:50] off trying it
[1:36:53] wow
[1:36:56] it's real straight when you get down to
[1:36:58] it because of what it meant
[1:37:01] but you know what I love on the other
[1:37:03] side
[1:37:04] that baby ten Generations he can say
[1:37:08] Daddy Daddy can look downstairs

[1:37:24] and you can go in Praise the Lord thank
[1:37:28] you Jesus

[1:37:32] Bible says the Bible says he visits
[1:37:35] righteousness to a thousand Generations
[1:37:41] 40
[1:37:42] 000 years
