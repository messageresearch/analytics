[9:26] to count you all as our friends this
[9:29] morning not just friends but family
[9:31] because we're all bought by the blood of
[9:33] Jesus Christ this morning birthed into
[9:35] the family of God and you know I was
[9:38] born into the family of greens some 56
[9:42] years ago didn't have to join it but I
[9:45] was born into the family with all the
[9:47] rights and privileges of being called a
[9:49] green a man but greater than that I was
[9:52] born about 40 some years ago into the
[9:54] family of God with all the rights and
[9:56] privileges this morning and all the
[9:58] blessings that he has bestowed as we
[10:01] look together this morning second Kings
[10:02] chapter 20 begin reading in verse number
[10:05] one a very very familiar story to us no
[10:09] doubt this morning in those days was
[10:11] Hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet
[10:15] Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and
[10:18] said unto Him thus saith the Lord set
[10:21] bone house in order for the
[10:23] I shall die and not live then he turned
[10:27] his face to the wall and prayed unto the
[10:29] Lord
[10:30] saying I beseech thee O Lord remember
[10:33] now how I have walked before the in
[10:35] truth and with a perfect heart and have
[10:38] done that which is good in thy sight and
[10:41] Hezekiah wept sore and it came to pass a
[10:46] for Isaiah was gone out into the midst
[10:49] middle court that the word of the Lord
[10:51] came to him saying turn again and tell
[10:54] Hezekiah the captain of my people thus
[10:56] saith the Lord the God of David thy
[10:58] father I have heard thy prayer I have
[11:02] seen thy tears behold I will heal thee
[11:06] on the hill V on the third day thou
[11:10] shalt go up unto the house of the Lord
[11:12] and I will add unto thy days 15 years
[11:15] and I will deliver thee in this city out
[11:18] of the hand of the king of Assyria and I
[11:21] will defend the city for my own sake and
[11:25] for my servant David's sake and I say I
[11:29] said take a lump of figs and they took
[11:32] and laid it on the ball and he recovered
[11:35] and Hezekiah said unto Isaiah what shall
[11:38] be the sign that the Lord will heal me
[11:39] and that I shall go up into the house of
[11:43] the Lord the third day and Isaiah said
[11:45] this sign shalt thou have of the Lord
[11:47] that the Lord will do the thing that he
[11:50] had spoken shall the shadow go forward
[11:53] 10 degrees or go back 10 degrees and
[11:56] Hezekiah answered it is a light thing
[11:58] for the shadow to go down 10 degrees nay
[12:00] but let the shadow return backward 10
[12:03] degrees and Isaiah the prophet cried
[12:06] unto the Lord and he brought the shadow
[12:08] 10 degrees backward by which it had gone
[12:11] down in the dial of Ahaz may the Lord
[12:15] had his blessings to the reading of the
[12:16] word is you have your seats this morning
[12:19] like to speak for just a little while
[12:22] and kind of an evangelistic message this
[12:25] morning if you will your condition is
[12:28] not your conclusion how we want to take
[12:33] a few minutes this morning by the help
[12:34] of the Lord and deal with some
[12:36] conditions
[12:36] and all of us have conditions all of us
[12:40] have sickness all of us have
[12:43] circumstances we have problems in life
[12:46] and you know if you're here and you
[12:49] don't have problems of life please stand
[12:51] up and tell me your secret a man because
[12:54] you know we're all born in sin shaping
[12:57] iniquity we all have problems we all
[13:01] have circumstances we all have things
[13:03] that we have to deal with and you know
[13:06] as long as we live here on this earth
[13:08] we're gonna have problems amen but I'm
[13:11] so glad that there as we said at the
[13:14] beginning you know when we have a
[13:16] problem that lets us know that there is
[13:18] a solution because as we said God has
[13:21] already provided you know that the
[13:23] scripture tells us with every temptation
[13:25] he has already made a way of escape so
[13:29] we know that God is by our side and he
[13:33] has provided what we have need of
[13:35] sometimes we just need a little
[13:36] encouragement to build our faith as it
[13:39] were to reach out and take hold of what
[13:42] God is already provided for us this
[13:43] morning
[13:44] amen and I heard the coming already
[13:47] about faith cometh by hearing and
[13:49] hearing by the Word of God and we look
[13:52] back and we we see whenever Moses got
[13:55] ready and got to the point to where they
[13:57] were fixing to come out of Egypt with
[13:58] the children of Israel and whenever he
[14:01] began to rehearse to them by the Sam and
[14:03] tell them all the miracles and all the
[14:06] signs and all the things that God had
[14:08] showed them and and bestowed upon them
[14:11] and the reason he did that was to build
[14:14] their faith and to encourage them and to
[14:17] strengthen them to believe God that God
[14:20] was going to bring them to the land that
[14:22] he promised them amen and confirm his
[14:25] word that he had given to Abraham and if
[14:27] we look in this day we find that the
[14:30] prophet of God has done the same thing
[14:32] amen he rehearsed all the miracles he
[14:35] rehearsed all the signs he rehearsed all
[14:38] the wonderful things that God did amen
[14:40] and and he told us if thou canst believe
[14:43] all things are possible and I believe
[14:46] this morning that God has not changed
[14:49] he's Jesus Christ
[14:50] the same yesterday today and forever
[14:52] amen and if God did that for Moses he
[14:55] and he did it again and this day I
[14:57] believe that this morning as ministers
[14:59] of the gospel we are to rehearse those
[15:03] things and to help our faith be
[15:05] increased this morning amen now every
[15:08] one of us the scripture says has been
[15:09] dealt the measure of faith it's and what
[15:12] is that measure it's just enough for you
[15:15] to receive what you have need of amen
[15:17] now my dad used to talk about practicing
[15:21] your faith or putting it in action you
[15:24] know sometimes a lot of people say well
[15:26] how do I do that how do I make you work
[15:29] well you put God to the test amen how do
[15:34] I do that brother Joe just begin to
[15:36] believe and believe and believe and
[15:38] believe and wait until God gives the
[15:41] answer this morning
[15:42] amen so many times we want our pie and
[15:45] we want it now we don't want to wait a
[15:47] while
[15:47] amen but God sometimes he says just wait
[15:50] a little bit amen because he sees the
[15:52] big picture this morning we're looking
[15:54] right here at the circumstances at the
[15:56] situation but God is looking at the big
[15:59] picture and he knows that sometimes if
[16:01] we get certain things or we do certain
[16:03] things and he allows us certain events
[16:06] to happen in their lives it might not
[16:08] prove to be exactly the timing that we
[16:11] need that or our would be beneficial to
[16:14] us then as it would be down the road so
[16:17] God is is mindful of all of these things
[16:20] this morning amen now we need to
[16:23] understand as Christians this morning
[16:25] that whatever condition that we may have
[16:29] God already has a remedy for that and I
[16:33] know I'm I'm kind of repeating that this
[16:34] morning but we got to understand Amen
[16:37] it's not what you have but what he can
[16:40] deliver you from this morning amen we in
[16:44] this age and all the teaching and all
[16:47] the denominationalism it's put a limit
[16:50] on what God can do
[16:52] Amen because it's taught to people well
[16:54] miracles don't happen anymore that was
[16:56] for the Apostles that was for them that
[16:58] was for those back under but I want to
[17:00] tell you the Bible tells us Jesus
[17:03] price is the same yesterday today and
[17:05] forever he has not changed this morning
[17:08] if he has healed somebody before he will
[17:12] do it again
[17:13] amen the Prophet told us if you meet the
[17:15] same conditions and come with the same
[17:18] faith this morning God is obligated not
[17:21] to you but to this word this morning to
[17:24] accomplish and to bring to pass what you
[17:26] have need of to bring the healing to
[17:29] your body because why he's already done
[17:31] it amen and if we come under the same
[17:33] faith this morning under the same
[17:35] circumstances God will do it again
[17:38] amen so we got to realize it's not our
[17:42] condition that we're in but it's what
[17:44] God can do for us this morning and when
[17:47] we comprehend that and recognize that
[17:49] then we can begin to see the things that
[17:52] God would do for us and begin to be
[17:55] recipients of what he has in store now
[17:59] brother Branham tells us in the ten
[18:01] virgins in 144,000 Hughes he said now
[18:05] that that's a type of the gospel trumpet
[18:07] he said you might have served the devil
[18:09] all these years in Chains with drinking
[18:12] smoking gambling and sin dirty things no
[18:15] matter what you've done but when you
[18:17] hear the gospel trumpet sound it's a
[18:20] sign that you can go free you can go
[18:24] faith cometh by hearing a man hearing of
[18:28] the word of God now you've heard the FEU
[18:30] gospel you don't have to stay bound any
[18:33] longer now we look back in the Old
[18:35] Testament whenever amen the day of
[18:37] Jubilee the year of Jubilee and whenever
[18:40] those those people had been in bondage
[18:42] they had been enslaved maybe they they
[18:45] gotten a financial bind they had to
[18:47] endure themselves or to enslave himself
[18:49] as it were to a a wealthy individual to
[18:52] make it through and to to survive a man
[18:55] but whenever that year of Jubilee came
[18:58] there was a trumpet that sounded a man
[19:01] and whenever that trumpet sounded it
[19:03] didn't matter whether they were in the
[19:05] garden ho and whether they were plowing
[19:07] the field whether they were feeding the
[19:09] ox or or watering the the animals or
[19:12] whatever they were doing if they were in
[19:14] the house
[19:14] serving and cooking a meal when that
[19:16] trumpet sounded and they heard the voice
[19:18] of that trumpet as it were amen freedom
[19:22] was theirs this morning amen and it's
[19:24] the same thing with the gospel trumpet
[19:26] this morning when you hear the word of
[19:28] God and it quickens to your heart I have
[19:31] heard the voice of God he met the
[19:33] trumpet of God the word going forth and
[19:36] that word declares to me that I am free
[19:39] I am healed I am delivered I'm set free
[19:42] amen whatever you have need of this
[19:45] morning when you hear that word and it
[19:47] quickens to your heart it's the same as
[19:50] that Israelite here in that trumpet
[19:52] sound and it declare damn you are free
[19:56] this morning and you can lay down your
[19:58] whole you can lay down your dishrag you
[20:00] can lay down whatever amen has bound you
[20:03] or whatever you've been doing lay it
[20:05] aside because now there is a freedom
[20:07] that God has given you this morning and
[20:10] we've just got to walk in that freedom
[20:13] Amen my brother madam tells us in
[20:16] questions and answers he said you may
[20:18] think you're tied to brother sister that
[20:20] wrote this question you may think the
[20:22] devil has got you tied down there but
[20:25] he's lying amen there was one time a man
[20:29] came to Jesus Christ the Son of God he
[20:32] untied you don't you believe it you
[20:35] don't have to stay down there no sir
[20:37] you're free that's right he died in your
[20:40] place to take away your sins you just
[20:43] believed him flop your wings and fly
[20:45] away with the rest of them don't stay in
[20:48] that pit of the devil no sir we all we
[20:51] all look at life and wonder how did we
[20:54] end up here and what can we do to get
[20:56] out of this and into our destiny today
[20:58] we're going to move you from your
[21:00] condition to your god-given conclusion
[21:04] amen and I like that this morning
[21:06] because that lets me know Amen that
[21:09] whatever I'm faced with in life there is
[21:12] a conclusion to that and my condition
[21:15] just like Hezekiah Amen Hezekiah was a
[21:18] man just like you and I a man but he got
[21:21] a word from the Lord set your house in
[21:23] order
[21:24] Amen you're going to die in
[21:26] léo a member Hezekiah amen he had a
[21:29] reality of something this morning that
[21:31] he could touch the heart of God he
[21:34] turned his race to the wall and he began
[21:37] to pray and call out to God and say Lord
[21:39] my I've got things to do I want to
[21:42] finish this project I want to build this
[21:43] or whatever the case was
[21:45] and God heard his cry and before the
[21:48] prophet got out the door hardly Amen out
[21:51] to the middle court God spoke to me and
[21:53] said go back and tell him Amen that the
[21:55] condition is not the conclusion Amen
[21:59] I've heard his cry and I want you to
[22:01] know this morning God will hear your cry
[22:03] if you'll just call out to him Amen turn
[22:07] your face to the wall as it were and say
[22:08] Lord I need you to move in my situation
[22:11] I need you amen to change this
[22:14] circumstance because I don't know what
[22:17] to do amen so many times we get in
[22:19] problems and circumstances we don't know
[22:21] the answer but I know one who does this
[22:24] morning and that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:27] amen now we've got to realize this more
[22:30] than to have a victory there has to be a
[22:33] struggle amen
[22:36] the winner of a war can't win unless he
[22:39] fights a battle amen unless there is a
[22:43] skirmish or a fight there cannot be a
[22:46] victor this morning amen so we got to
[22:49] realize until you you can't be healed
[22:52] until you're sick I know my
[22:54] father-in-law some years ago maybe
[22:56] 30-some years ago now a man he was
[22:59] diagnosed with with cancer and and you
[23:02] know whenever the doctors came in and
[23:03] told him that morning said mr. myko said
[23:05] you've got cancer
[23:07] and you know it's it's in this condition
[23:10] and so forth and brother Rex said well
[23:12] praise the Lord how do you know God can
[23:14] heal it if you never have it amen and I
[23:18] want to tell you he lived for nearly 30
[23:21] more years after that amen and God gave
[23:24] him strength listen he went to the
[23:26] doctor he took their radiation he went
[23:29] through their tests a man he never lost
[23:31] his hair he never lost his teeth only
[23:33] they told him that he might lose them
[23:35] but so he had them pulled he never lost
[23:36] his beard
[23:38] man and and you know just had a
[23:40] wonderful beautiful head of hair and I
[23:42] can say that this morning amen but you
[23:44] know God took care of him this morning
[23:47] how do you know God can heal it if you
[23:49] never have it and you can't get healed
[23:52] until you go through the sickness this
[23:54] morning but I'm so glad Amen that God
[23:57] has already said by whose stripes you
[23:59] are healed
[24:01] by whose stripes you were healed it's
[24:03] already done this morning it's just our
[24:06] faith has to walk out and take hold of
[24:09] what God has already said and already
[24:12] declared for you and on a man we got to
[24:15] realize this morning where we're at and
[24:17] we got to know our status and understand
[24:21] who we are amen I believe brother
[24:23] Branham said when this bride recognized
[24:25] this what she is this world will not be
[24:29] able to hold her she'll go in a rapture
[24:31] and that's what we're striving for this
[24:33] morning Amen I don't know about you but
[24:37] I'm longing to get out of this world I'm
[24:40] looking forward to the day that I'll
[24:42] have a change Amen that something will
[24:45] sweep over me and I won't be Amen bald
[24:49] and yeah and you know and and and
[24:51] overweight I'll be a man a perfect
[24:54] specimen of what God has declared that
[24:56] we would be this morning
[24:58] Amen now you look up here and say well
[25:01] brother Joe I just don't know about that
[25:03] well amen let me tell you this morning I
[25:05] believe what the Bible said I believe
[25:08] what the prophets said this morning a
[25:10] man he said will turn back to the 18 to
[25:12] 21 year old somewhere in that range Amen
[25:15] just like Abraham did listen when you
[25:17] see Abraham and you hear the story how
[25:20] that God had come on the scene that
[25:22] promised him a child and so forth and
[25:24] then after 25 years later here Abraham
[25:27] was running around described it was
[25:29] walking along with his king Amen
[25:31] stoop-shouldered and just trying to get
[25:33] around the best he could and then all of
[25:35] a sudden after that visitation of
[25:37] Melchizedek
[25:38] amen and if he had the bread and wine
[25:41] with Abraham a man and Sarah's secrets
[25:44] were discovered and the
[25:46] and Melchizedek said why did Sarah laugh
[25:48] and you know the story this morning
[25:50] amen and then after that something began
[25:53] to happen to brother Abraham and sister
[25:56] Sarah now abraham believed a promise all
[25:59] those years and he staggered not Amen
[26:01] but sister Sarah had to get her own
[26:03] revelation this morning and when she did
[26:06] things begin to happen and it wasn't
[26:08] just a little while until they wrapped
[26:11] the baby in their arm a man oh let me
[26:13] tell you this morning when we get our
[26:15] personal revelation of what the Word of
[26:18] God has said it won't be long until we
[26:20] receive the benefit of that this morning
[26:22] and we hold the promise in our arms or
[26:25] in our body or in our situation this
[26:28] morning because God has declared that it
[26:31] would be today amen
[26:35] why little Bethlehem brother Benham said
[26:38] and another great event that I wouldn't
[26:41] forget to call that was when David was
[26:43] in his worst of time when it was a
[26:46] fugitive he'd already been anointed he
[26:48] knowed what he was to be he was to be
[26:51] king God said so and yet he was hated he
[26:56] was standing in between two great deep
[26:58] fires here was the Philistines on one
[27:02] side after him here was Saul on the
[27:04] other side and he was a man without a
[27:06] nation just as the church stands today
[27:10] the true living Church of God without a
[27:13] denomination or anything else she stands
[27:17] alone but yet she she's had the
[27:20] anointing poured on her she knows what
[27:23] she is now we know it intellectually we
[27:26] know our brother say I'm up here in
[27:28] their mind but what it's got to happen
[27:30] is has got to drop from here about 12
[27:32] inches down in our heart this morning
[27:34] amen and recognize and realize that as a
[27:37] man thinketh in his heart so is he
[27:40] it's not what we know intellectually
[27:42] it's not what we can conjure up in our
[27:45] mind a member when it drops down as a
[27:47] revelation from God to you just like
[27:51] Peter whom do men say that I the Son of
[27:53] man am jesus said and some said you're
[27:56] lying
[27:56] you Jeremiah this one that one the other
[27:58] amen but Jesus said but whom say ye that
[28:02] I am and Peter with a divine revelation
[28:05] of God he said thou art the Christ the
[28:08] Son of the Living God and Jesus said
[28:10] flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you
[28:12] but my father which is in heaven and it
[28:14] became so real to Peter
[28:16] Amen that he realized this was more than
[28:19] just a man and I want you to understand
[28:21] Amen you are more than just the people
[28:24] you are sons and daughters of God
[28:26] you are deity in flesh this morning
[28:29] walking around little Messiah it's
[28:32] according to the word of the Prophet hey
[28:34] man we are God upon the earth this
[28:36] morning
[28:37] hey man and when we comprehend that Amen
[28:41] not up here but down here and when it
[28:43] becomes so real to us and then what's
[28:45] going to happen amen we are going to
[28:48] become amen the fullness of the
[28:50] manifestation of God in this hour amen
[28:55] you forgive me this morning we got to
[29:02] understand our condition we need to
[29:05] first understand that God has already
[29:08] declared my end from my beginning Isaiah
[29:13] 41 26 who had declared from the
[29:15] beginning that we may know and before
[29:18] time that we may say he is righteous yay
[29:21] there is none that shows you a there is
[29:24] none that declare with you a there is
[29:26] none that heareth your words but it is
[29:28] God that hath declared not men a man you
[29:32] know denominations they want to go and
[29:35] they want to make some men elevate them
[29:38] and you even you know in the Catholic
[29:40] Church they want to elevate men to
[29:42] certain positions and make them a man as
[29:45] God upon the earth and and they've got
[29:47] you know they've got a bit of truth
[29:49] there but it's perverted a man by the
[29:54] sound they they they try to to make it a
[29:57] man-made or a man lid situation which we
[30:01] realize they man as as my dad used to
[30:03] say God started his church like he wants
[30:06] it and now he wants it like he started
[30:09] it
[30:09] how did he start the church on the day
[30:11] of Pentecost he poured out his spirit in
[30:14] those believers amen and that's how God
[30:17] started his church and that's what God
[30:19] wants to see today a church that is full
[30:22] of the Holy Ghost and fire a church that
[30:25] can be led by the Spirit of God not some
[30:28] hierarchy out of Rome or Chattanooga or
[30:31] wherever it might be Cleveland Tennessee
[30:32] amen God wants a church that's led by
[30:35] the power of God and by the Holy Ghost
[30:38] this morning because God Amen is he is
[30:43] the leader he is the God this morning he
[30:46] is our instructor and that's how he
[30:48] wants his church to lead in this hour
[30:51] that we're living in isaiah 40:8 and 3
[30:55] i've declared the former things from the
[30:58] beginning and they went out of forth out
[31:00] of my mouth and I showed them I did them
[31:03] suddenly and they came to pass now
[31:05] knowing this morning that he has
[31:08] declared our beginning it helps me to
[31:11] understand what is said in Jeremiah
[31:13] 29:11 said for I know the thoughts I
[31:17] think towards you said the Lord thoughts
[31:20] of peace and not of evil and to give you
[31:24] and expect it in do you realize God knew
[31:28] this morning exactly how you would end
[31:32] up look back at the children of Israel
[31:36] and we refer to them a number of times
[31:38] this morning but the children of Israel
[31:40] brother Louise when they came out of
[31:41] Egypt do you reckon God knew that they
[31:44] were going to murmur and complain and
[31:46] backslide God knew that he knew that
[31:51] they were going to grumble and carry on
[31:53] and and murmur against God against Moses
[31:57] and against Aaron he knew a man that
[31:59] they were not going to go into the
[32:01] Promised Land God knew that cause he's
[32:03] an all-knowing God this morning a man he
[32:06] knows the end from the beginning a man
[32:09] but yet knowing that what did God do did
[32:12] God cast him away no did God destroy
[32:15] them he did naturallyspeaking Hey
[32:18] but there was a seed amongst that group
[32:20] this morning that God preserved amen
[32:24] there was those that God knew amen that
[32:26] they would hold fast to the Word of God
[32:28] and I believe in this our God knows
[32:31] there is a people a man that will stand
[32:34] by the Word of God they will not deny
[32:36] they will not fall away
[32:38] amen they will not back up from saying
[32:40] well I'm not sure if he's a prophet
[32:42] anymore I'm not sure about this and
[32:44] about that there is a people that has
[32:47] declared from their heart this morning
[32:49] they meant by divine revelation and they
[32:52] understand a man that God takes a man a
[32:56] man and uses that man that man is not
[32:58] perfect a man that man has mistakes just
[33:03] like Abraham just like Noah just like
[33:06] Jacob just like all the men that God
[33:09] used well I hope this is all right this
[33:13] morning a man that God takes a man an
[33:17] imperfect man and he covers him by the
[33:20] anointing of the Holy Ghost this morning
[33:23] amen and whenever that anointing speaks
[33:25] through that man it's not the man not
[33:28] the imperfect man that's speaking but
[33:30] it's a perfect God that speaks through
[33:32] that man this morning Amen so we've got
[33:35] to find a man a balance and realize he's
[33:38] just a man but God uses the
[33:41] instrumentality of man amen he takes our
[33:44] imperfections a man that he brings
[33:47] through us the perfection of God this
[33:49] morning amen the declaration that God
[33:56] has made of us it gives us peace to know
[33:59] that our condition is not the conclusion
[34:04] amen the things we're facing now it's
[34:07] not the outcome that God has expected
[34:10] for us this morning
[34:12] amen it's just the beginning of the
[34:17] situation to get me to the where the
[34:19] conclusion is amen now understand that
[34:23] God has a plan for your life this
[34:25] morning and in that plan he wants you to
[34:27] know that the condition
[34:30] is your release to your conclusion Amen
[34:34] as we said earlier you can't get healing
[34:36] until you've been sick you can't have
[34:39] victory until you have a war or a battle
[34:42] you can't have deliverance until you've
[34:44] been bound this morning amen all of
[34:47] these conditions are just the
[34:49] forerunners of the conclusion that God
[34:52] has for you and listen this morning what
[34:55] does God allow these things for he
[34:57] allows them to mold character in you
[34:59] they meant to shape you and form you
[35:02] into what he has expected for EURion
[35:06] this morning and he knows amen what what
[35:09] good is if we take our children this
[35:11] morning and we give them everything they
[35:13] won't they we let them do anything they
[35:15] want to do that has that hasn't in but
[35:18] it's not the end that you want this
[35:19] morning a man but I think we want to
[35:22] train them in the way that's right and
[35:24] let them see and understand there is a
[35:27] right road to follow and if you follow
[35:29] the wrong road Amen it's going to be
[35:32] trouble and destruction in the end this
[35:35] morning and that's what God is doing for
[35:39] you and I as his sons and daughters he's
[35:42] leading us and listen just like little
[35:46] children or young children or adult
[35:48] children sometimes they make the wrong
[35:51] choices
[35:54] well maybe them Georgia you don't have
[35:57] that problem maybe that's just in North
[36:01] Carolina amen
[36:03] sometimes sometimes we as adults make
[36:09] the wrong choice but I'm so glad this
[36:13] morning a man that when we get ourselves
[36:16] in those conditions and sometimes when
[36:19] those conditions come upon us at no
[36:21] fault of our own or no direction of our
[36:23] own that does not mean we have to stay
[36:26] there that does not mean that that's how
[36:29] it's going to turn out this morning it
[36:31] just lets me know a man that God is
[36:34] mindful and that God has something in
[36:37] store down
[36:38] Road for you and I this morning it will
[36:41] just put our confidence in him and
[36:43] recognize a man that he hasn't expected
[36:47] in for you and I and as we started to
[36:49] say we make our mistakes we make our
[36:52] faults and their failures amen and God
[36:54] is aware of that he's mindful of that
[37:00] this morning and he knows a man he knows
[37:03] what we're going to do you know I can't
[37:07] help when I think of these things a
[37:08] little cap I used to have a little ball
[37:10] cap and on that cap it had a little boy
[37:13] with a slingshot in his back pocket he
[37:15] had a cat by the tail and the slogan on
[37:18] there said God knows all about me but he
[37:20] loves me anyway
[37:22] I'm so glad sister Becky that he does
[37:25] this morning
[37:26] Amen because he knew my ends from to my
[37:29] beginning and listen he knew the road I
[37:31] would travel he knew the wrong I would
[37:34] do he knew the right I would do and he
[37:38] knew the choice I would make a man when
[37:40] he come down and life was presented to
[37:42] me and salvation was presented to me he
[37:45] knew I would choose that he knew in the
[37:48] end I would do the right thing hey man
[37:50] and I'm so glad this morning that when
[37:52] he saw and he looked brother Joe at me
[37:54] and he saw he meant what I was and what
[37:57] I would turn out to be without His grace
[37:59] amen he didn't leave me there amen there
[38:02] was another conclusion that he had for
[38:05] me this morning and I'm so thankful for
[38:07] that in this hour now understand that
[38:17] the condition does not kill you well
[38:21] brothers Joe I know this one had this
[38:22] condition and and and they died from it
[38:25] and they had that condition they didn't
[38:26] survive it or whatever the case might be
[38:28] but I want you to understand even though
[38:33] you go through a condition you go
[38:36] through a sickness if your heart is
[38:39] right if your heart is right brother
[38:44] Danny and everything is all right
[38:47] between you and the Lord
[38:48] and this body passes away
[38:52] what's more important this flesh that's
[38:55] gonna rot in the ground or that man on
[38:57] the inside
[38:59] amen we think about the rich young ruler
[39:01] he came to Jesus what must I do to to be
[39:05] saved or to inherit eternal life
[39:07] jesus said amen keep the commandments he
[39:09] said I've done all there hey man that's
[39:11] wonderful
[39:12] amen we all do that we try to hey man
[39:14] but jesus said you like one thing go
[39:17] sell all that you have and give to the
[39:19] poor a man his heart wasn't a ride he
[39:22] meant and brother madam told us later
[39:23] that inhale he lift up his eyes amen and
[39:27] they saw that great go fix the neighbor
[39:29] Hammond on the other side and and he
[39:32] wanted some relief from the condition
[39:34] that he was here he passed up the relief
[39:36] that a condition that he was in he
[39:38] turned it down and wouldn't accept it
[39:41] and because of that brother Sam amen he
[39:43] had a different conclusion but I'm so
[39:46] glad this morning when we don't turn
[39:47] down the medicine if you will the
[39:51] salvation then our conclusion Amen it's
[39:54] not the condition that we're in when
[39:56] it's all said and done and we look in
[40:03] Isaiah chapter 54 and we realize that it
[40:07] releases hope in knowing that God did
[40:09] not make a mistake in choosing you to
[40:13] deal with this situation
[40:15] going back to my father-in-law how do
[40:19] you know God can heal it if you never
[40:21] have it God knew brother X would have
[40:24] that kind of faith and listen as we said
[40:28] brother X lived oh by the way I forgot
[40:31] to tell you when he was taking those
[40:32] radiation treatments he was working in a
[40:35] sawmill and I know you country brothers
[40:38] down here know a little bit about how
[40:40] hard work that is it's not easy but he
[40:43] never missed a day's work he'd Drive
[40:46] about 25 miles down the ray to take his
[40:49] treatment he had turned right around
[40:50] come back and go right back to work amen
[40:54] God blessed him God honored his faith
[40:58] amen and he as I said he never lost his
[41:01] Harry he never lost his strength until
[41:03] years later hey
[41:04] man when when it flared up again amen I
[41:07] and they never did find the original or
[41:10] the main trunk or the main source amen
[41:13] but you know God kept him all those
[41:15] years amen now isaiah 54:17 as we refer
[41:22] to no weapon that is formed against thee
[41:26] shall prosper and every tongue that
[41:29] shall rise against the in judgment thou
[41:32] shalt condemn this is the heritage of
[41:37] the servants of the Lord and their
[41:39] righteousness is of me saith the Lord I
[41:42] want you to realize there whatever
[41:44] weapon the devil forms against you it
[41:47] will not prosper Amen how can you say
[41:51] that mojo because I know what he's
[41:53] already said he has an expected end for
[41:56] me Amen he knows what its gonna be in
[41:59] the end he knows that that that my life
[42:02] is not going to be destroyed by the
[42:04] devil he knows that he's going to bring
[42:06] me through he knows he's going to heal
[42:09] me he knows he's gonna bring deliverance
[42:10] in my life amen and no weapon that the
[42:14] devil forms against you whether it be
[42:16] cancer whether it be lies whether it be
[42:18] deceit Amen whether it be circumstances
[42:20] whether it be a lost children that you
[42:23] know and the devil uses that worse than
[42:25] anything I believe against us parents
[42:29] when we see our children and we see them
[42:33] going the way of the world and nothing
[42:36] tears it our heart more than our
[42:37] children well maybe you're not as
[42:42] concerned a parent as I am I thank God
[42:45] for what God's done for Nathaniel
[42:47] he's serving the Lord and now I'm
[42:50] beginning to speak a little bit so I
[42:52] thank God for that but you know I deal
[42:54] with people and you know whenever they
[42:56] come and their hearts disscourn because
[42:58] their children is doing this and the
[42:59] children is doing that and the children
[43:01] is doing the other thing amen and it
[43:03] just breaks their heart it just pulls at
[43:05] their heartstrings and and you know just
[43:07] just they just don't know what to do or
[43:09] have a handle it well the thing to do a
[43:12] man is we dedicate our children to the
[43:14] Lord when they're little bitty
[43:16] babies and we don't baptize them we just
[43:18] dedicate them to God and when they come
[43:20] of age and recognize they need a Savior
[43:22] then they repent then they're baptized
[43:24] then God fills them with the Holy Ghost
[43:26] amen but what we do we give them to God
[43:29] and say Lord they're in your hands amen
[43:35] you have promised me you shall be saved
[43:37] and your house man now how God does it
[43:42] that's not my business when God does it
[43:44] that's not my business but my business
[43:46] is to take what he said you shall be
[43:50] saved in your house this morning
[43:52] Amen well brother Joe they have to be
[43:54] saved they have to be born again
[43:55] absolutely hey man but I want to tell
[43:58] you this morning God has it in control
[44:01] amen how he does it that's not for me to
[44:04] worry about my worry is to believe what
[44:08] he said this morning and to claim that
[44:11] promise of God amen and understand today
[44:14] Amen that he is a big enough God to take
[44:17] care of his word this morning amen now
[44:23] this condition is a weapon that the
[44:25] devil forms against you amen but the
[44:28] scripture says it cannot prosper amen
[44:32] what is the condition that the enemies
[44:34] formed against you this morning that you
[44:36] have to have to be back stepping into
[44:39] fear and oppression and that's what the
[44:41] devil wants this morning he wants to get
[44:43] you oppressed he wants to get you
[44:46] depressed he wants to get you in a
[44:49] spirit of fear well praise the Lord
[44:53] again maybe this is just for a North
[44:55] Carolina folks but you know maybe y'all
[44:57] just in do it this morning maybe
[44:58] somebody on the internet hear it hey Ben
[45:03] but he wants to get you bound by fear
[45:07] what's brother Ernie say false evidence
[45:09] appearing real
[45:11] amen it's not true evidence this morning
[45:13] you know a couple years ago I had to sit
[45:17] on the grand jury for the state of North
[45:18] Carolina for about a year's time and
[45:20] we'd have to sit there and they'd bring
[45:23] in their cases and well we've got this
[45:25] much evidence we got this and we got
[45:27] that and we as a jury
[45:29] have to decide is there enough evidence
[45:31] to bring it to trial
[45:33] amen well I want to tell you this
[45:34] morning friend if we believe the Word of
[45:37] God amen there is evidence against the
[45:41] devil and his tactics this morning amen
[45:44] there is evidence that will prove that
[45:46] he is a liar that he is a deceiver that
[45:50] he this morning a man is one that will
[45:53] try his best to intimidate you I know
[45:58] this is simple ABC this morning but it's
[46:01] what the Lord laid on my heart amen
[46:03] he tries to intimidate us to bring us to
[46:07] a position to where we are so bound by
[46:10] fear that it's hard for us this morning
[46:12] to take hold of the promises of God amen
[46:15] because listen we are human this morning
[46:18] a man that we go by what we can see
[46:21] taste feel smell in here and many times
[46:23] what does that do that hinders this
[46:25] morning faith in our hearts and causes
[46:29] us a mentor to look at the circumstances
[46:32] instead of the conclusion this morning
[46:34] oh my but if we could ever just grasp
[46:37] hold of that conclusion and realize God
[46:40] has promised us the victory this morning
[46:42] amen and he sold us in the book of
[46:45] Revelation to him that overcometh will I
[46:47] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[46:50] as I have overcome and set with my
[46:52] father in his throne now do you think he
[46:54] would have made that statement if there
[46:56] was a somebody going to overcome this
[46:58] morning
[46:59] Amen no he knew that you would be
[47:01] overcomers he knew that you would be
[47:04] victorious this morning he knew that
[47:06] because he knew the conclusion to your
[47:08] condition this morning brother Branham
[47:14] tells us in the message job he said oh
[47:16] sure you're giving him everything he
[47:19] wants got him all hedged up and
[47:21] everything said no wonder said sure he
[47:24] can serve you making plenty of money
[47:26] plant got plenty of cattle got
[47:28] everything in life said sure anybody can
[47:30] serve you like that said if you'll let
[47:32] me have him
[47:32] I'll make him curse you to your face and
[47:36] what did God say I don't believe it
[47:41] the devil comes before the Lord that
[47:44] says Lord you got Joe green down there
[47:48] and he's out there preaching faith and
[47:51] he's out there preaching that you have
[47:52] done made a way of escape and you've
[47:54] done you've done brought victory in his
[47:57] life and you've done helped him to
[47:59] overcome and and say if you'll just let
[48:02] me get at him if you'll just let me put
[48:04] sickness on him furious let me take his
[48:06] little houses and his little land and
[48:08] all the little things that he's got if
[48:10] you let me do that
[48:11] he'll curse you to your face and I trust
[48:14] that God sitting there on the throne and
[48:16] said now now he won't do it I've got
[48:22] confidence in John Green and you think
[48:25] well why am I going through this why not
[48:28] you every son that cometh to God must be
[48:35] chastened of the Lord amen well brother
[48:38] Joey's at chase think no not always
[48:40] sometimes it might be but not always
[48:44] sometimes God looks down and says
[48:47] there's brother Boyd you know brother
[48:49] Boyd has been testifying of how good
[48:51] I've been to him and how blessed he is
[48:53] you know I'm just gonna let him have a
[48:55] little hardship and just let's just see
[48:58] if he really means that well brother Joe
[49:02] do you think God's that kind of God
[49:03] absolutely absolutely
[49:08] Wow because he loves you and he's got
[49:11] confidence in you and he knows a man
[49:14] that you have an expected end and that
[49:18] expected in is not a end of defeat and
[49:22] gloom and despair but that expected him
[49:25] by the Lewis is a end of victory of joy
[49:28] of peace of happiness of our blessings
[49:32] of God and God knows that this morning
[49:35] Amen so what what do we do we look at
[49:37] the circumstances and we say oh god how
[49:39] am I going to get through this well how
[49:41] am I gonna get through it is he's gonna
[49:43] bring me through it this morning amen
[49:48] how
[49:52] romans 8:28 tells us and it's a very
[49:55] very familiar scripture this morning he
[49:57] says and we know that all things but
[50:03] then used to say all is all-inclusive
[50:07] without exception everyone I was
[50:11] preaching down to Mexico brother Dan was
[50:13] interpreting for me and I used that
[50:15] illustrates him and I said a
[50:17] three-letter word and brother Dan said
[50:20] uh-huh I said Oh a three-letter word he
[50:25] said uh-uh
[50:26] he said I can't interpret that as a
[50:29] three-letter word because in Spanish
[50:31] help me brother Louisa if I if Spanish
[50:34] all is nosotros is that right ok no ok
[50:41] it's more than three words three letters
[50:44] anyway
[50:45] hey man it's more than three letters I
[50:47] spent a long time ago a man but it's
[50:49] more than three letters he said I can't
[50:51] interpret it as being a three-letter
[50:53] word amen so you know but whatever how
[50:55] many letters it is all-inclusive without
[50:59] exception every one anything that you're
[51:03] dealing with amen it's working toward
[51:07] your good let's go back to the script
[51:08] here and we know how many knows this
[51:11] morning that all things work together
[51:15] for the good amen of them that loved the
[51:20] Lord a man to them that love God to them
[51:23] who are the called according to his
[51:26] purpose and we know his purpose is to
[51:29] have a spotless bride Oh mom that should
[51:36] have made a Baptist shout to have a
[51:40] spotless bride is his purpose amen and
[51:43] who is that this morning amen that's you
[51:47] and I and his purpose will be fulfilled
[51:50] and everything that I go through it's
[51:55] for a purpose this morning to bring me
[51:58] to that place where I can be a part of
[52:00] that spotless bride this one
[52:05] now understand that the Bible is
[52:07] declared to us that no matter what the
[52:09] condition is this morning it's working
[52:13] for my good why because I love the Lord
[52:17] and I am called according to his purpose
[52:20] amen
[52:22] now we realized this morning that these
[52:26] things are formed and they leave a
[52:28] condition but it's all worked out for my
[52:31] good this morning
[52:32] understand that we have to know that
[52:34] this condition is for the glory of the
[52:36] Lord amen Paul the Apostle said in
[52:39] second Winston's 12:9 he said unto me my
[52:42] grace is sufficient for thee now listen
[52:46] Paul was a man that was shipwrecked
[52:47] several times or a couple of times that
[52:49] beaten several times and lift for dead
[52:52] and and despised and rejected of of his
[52:54] peers and of the Church of that day amen
[52:58] but what did he do he said listen I know
[53:01] that these things are for my good they
[53:04] bring me to a place that where I put my
[53:07] confidence in God and his word
[53:09] amen and I know that these things are
[53:11] not going to move me no weapon formed
[53:14] against me shall prosper
[53:15] and God has promised me that I will be
[53:18] victorious this morning ow he's in in
[53:28] his confidence there he said in verse 9
[53:32] he said unto me my grace is sufficient
[53:33] for thee my strength is made perfect in
[53:37] weakness they meant most gladly
[53:39] therefore will I glory in my infirmities
[53:41] that the power of Christ may rest upon
[53:44] me Paul knew that these infirmities in
[53:47] these hardships amen they was molding
[53:50] him they meant to a place to where the
[53:53] power of Christ could rest upon him and
[53:55] that Christ could be manifested through
[53:57] his life now as we move on we want to
[54:01] look and see how to approach God in the
[54:03] middle of your condition and approach to
[54:07] God a man is going to be important you
[54:11] know you see somebody going through a
[54:14] trial and you know they come up and they
[54:16] still God why God why did you let this
[54:18] happen and why is this going on in this
[54:22] situation a man and how you respond to
[54:27] the situation is how God responds to you
[54:30] Amen the condition of your prayer this
[54:33] one is going to open or closed doors
[54:36] Amen and listen we must get the first
[54:40] statement Amen in order to release or we
[54:43] don't forget the first statement I
[54:45] should say in order to release our faith
[54:47] to believe that our condition is the
[54:49] opening for our conclusion what we're
[54:53] going through lets me know that there's
[54:55] something better in the end amen
[54:59] second Timothy 3:16 and I'm trying to
[55:02] Terry this morning he said all Scripture
[55:04] is given by inspiration of God and is
[55:08] profitable for doctrine for reproof for
[55:11] correction for instruction in
[55:13] righteousness that the man of God might
[55:16] be throughly a lot of people read that
[55:19] as thoroughly but it's throughly
[55:22] throughly furnished unto all good works
[55:26] amen the word coming forth you know lots
[55:29] of time we sit there and we say why in
[55:31] the world is the preacher preaching on
[55:33] such a subject is that why is he dealing
[55:35] with that situation why is he preaching
[55:38] about this they meant well Amen somebody
[55:41] needs to hear it this morning
[55:43] hey man if the man of God is in tune
[55:45] with the Lord a man that God puts things
[55:48] on his heart it's not just that to back
[55:51] the air this morning Amen God uses them
[55:54] instrumentality of men amen he takes the
[55:57] fivefold ministry and he comes along and
[55:59] it deals with situations in our heart
[56:02] this morning in our lives amen and if we
[56:06] listen to the Word of God God always
[56:08] provides the answer this morning amen
[56:13] that we might be throughly furnished
[56:16] made perfect
[56:18] furnished unto all good works now
[56:22] according to the prior that Hezekiah
[56:23] prays in second Kings 20 that we read he
[56:26] appeals to God as the son has not
[56:29] finished his labors
[56:30] amen and and he bends on the grace of
[56:32] his father to grant him amen the time
[56:35] that he needs to complete his project a
[56:38] mentor whatever he's doing there and we
[56:40] got to take note that Hezekiah did not
[56:42] allow his condition of impending death I
[56:46] mean thus saith the Lord you're gonna
[56:47] die he didn't let that faze him he
[56:50] turned his face to the wall and he said
[56:52] God I need a little more time can I just
[56:59] share a personal testimony with you this
[57:01] morning I am one son out of seven
[57:06] children and my dad always wanted to see
[57:12] myself and sister Rex and have a child
[57:15] we were married 11 years thought we
[57:17] weren't going to be able to have
[57:18] children and prayer was made and
[57:21] prophecy was given and within just a
[57:24] little amount of time since the wreck
[57:27] Sam was expecting by the Sam and here is
[57:29] the result of that almost 28 years ago
[57:32] in just a few days amen
[57:34] but you know whenever we we we got the
[57:38] promise and then during the time of the
[57:43] the pregnancy dad had his first heart
[57:46] attack and it was October the first
[57:49] Sunday evening never will forget as long
[57:51] as I live
[57:52] October the first that evening the aunts
[57:54] brothers and Louie were singing at the
[57:55] church and and dad and brother Dan had
[57:58] just come back from Costa Rica and dad
[58:00] had some sickness and so forth and as
[58:04] you can understand from drinking the
[58:05] water and different things and and so
[58:07] forth so he come in he was in the the on
[58:12] the platform while they were singing
[58:13] they come back in had to go to the
[58:15] restroom and and he's he come back by
[58:17] the sound booth there in the old church
[58:18] he said son come and come out here and
[58:20] pray for me I just feel terrible I just
[58:22] need a touch from the Lord so we did and
[58:24] then after the service of course he
[58:26] ended up going to the hospital with a
[58:27] heart attack but anyways Nathaniel was
[58:30] on the way he hadn't arrived yet and
[58:31] this was in October in US and he was
[58:34] born in December and you know when dad
[58:36] knew that that child was coming he never
[58:39] did say it's gonna be a girl
[58:41] he said when my grandson gets
[58:44] here you know he's gonna carry on the
[58:47] name and you know Israel he was real
[58:49] excited cuz you know we were the only
[58:51] Son and carrying on the name and so
[58:53] forth and then when he was born and then
[58:56] of course dad was so thrilled and so
[58:58] excited and you know just spend as much
[59:01] time with him as he could and and all
[59:03] those things and then you know two years
[59:05] less than two years I guess it was
[59:07] actually after Nathaniel was born dead
[59:09] passed away November the 22nd in
[59:12] Nathaniel was not hard at two years old
[59:14] but several weeks and months before that
[59:18] dad would just sometimes he'd be played
[59:20] with him he's I wish I could just talk
[59:22] to him and have a conversation with him
[59:24] and so forth and you know I believe that
[59:27] the condition that dad was in when he
[59:30] had that first heart attack if it hadn't
[59:33] been for the hand of God I believe dad
[59:35] would have went home at that time but I
[59:37] believe like Hezekiah my daddy turned
[59:39] his face to the wall now you might say
[59:41] well brother Joe I don't believe it well
[59:43] that's okay it didn't happen to you it
[59:44] happened to me
[59:45] amen I believe that dad knew that he
[59:49] death was imminent he knew that his time
[59:51] was short and just from conversations
[59:54] and all the things that happened he knew
[59:56] that God was gonna take him home amen
[59:58] and he turned his face to the wall as it
[1:00:00] were and he prayed he said Lord let me
[1:00:02] see that grandbaby amen let me see that
[1:00:05] child amen and God allowed him almost
[1:00:08] two years to enjoy that grandson amen
[1:00:11] and then God took him home amen
[1:00:13] now you might say well brother Joe
[1:00:14] that's that's foolish well I have a
[1:00:17] Bible example and God does not change
[1:00:20] this morning amen God is still the same
[1:00:24] Jehovah Jireh he is still a prayer
[1:00:27] answering God amen and and dad turned
[1:00:30] his face to the wall and he got to enjoy
[1:00:32] that grandbaby then God took him home
[1:00:34] amen and you know this morning amen have
[1:00:37] we in our faith in our condition can
[1:00:40] look to God amen and recognize that he
[1:00:44] is what he says he is and he will do
[1:00:47] what he says he will do Amen then our
[1:00:50] condition does not have to be our
[1:00:53] Cluj in this morning now as we look in
[1:00:57] James chapter 5 verse 16 the Bible
[1:00:59] declares the effectual fervent prayer of
[1:01:02] a righteous man availeth much and we can
[1:01:06] see what happened in Hezekiah day we can
[1:01:08] see what happened in brother Henry
[1:01:10] Greene's day amen we can see what
[1:01:12] happened into profit of God's day a man
[1:01:14] and I trust we can see what's happening
[1:01:17] in our day this morning and recognizing
[1:01:20] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:01:22] forever amen so when we have that
[1:01:26] understanding this morning a man that we
[1:01:28] condition ourselves to pray effectually
[1:01:31] amen and that word effectually means
[1:01:34] sufficient to provide a result a man
[1:01:40] sufficient to provide a result when we
[1:01:44] pray enough and when we pray with the
[1:01:47] right frame of mind but probably God
[1:01:49] said the right mental attitude toward
[1:01:52] any promise of God will bring it to pass
[1:01:56] this morning and when we come with that
[1:01:58] kind of an effectual prayer then God
[1:02:01] will honor this morning and hear our
[1:02:03] prayer and we've got to come with an
[1:02:05] expectation to believe that he will this
[1:02:07] morning amen it said that expectation is
[1:02:11] the breeding ground for miracles
[1:02:15] Hezekiah didn't pray just to hear
[1:02:17] himself pray amen he didn't pray just to
[1:02:20] say well God I'm praying and I I'm
[1:02:23] hoping Hezekiah expected God to hear his
[1:02:27] prayer amen he didn't not know when God
[1:02:31] would answer but he knew had to be
[1:02:34] before his death this morning amen
[1:02:37] because he asked God to let him live he
[1:02:41] didn't ask God to raise him from the
[1:02:42] dead he asked God to let him live you
[1:02:45] know some of the brothers sometimes
[1:02:46] they'll say what we need to do is pray
[1:02:49] specific you know we pray in general god
[1:02:54] bless the brothers in the church God
[1:02:56] bless the sisters in the church God
[1:02:57] bless the mission program god bless all
[1:03:00] the missionaries around the world but
[1:03:02] sometimes we need to say God you see
[1:03:05] brother Sam down there in Georgia
[1:03:07] Ulf out there in the country you know
[1:03:09] but he's going through a test lord I
[1:03:11] don't know what he's going through but
[1:03:12] Lord maybe he's going through something
[1:03:14] Lord just go down there on sagres Road
[1:03:16] and and help brother Sam and encourage
[1:03:18] him and strengthen them specifically for
[1:03:21] him this morning
[1:03:22] amen but you know so many times we want
[1:03:25] to generalize it but if we could ever
[1:03:27] just come to realize Amen that God wants
[1:03:30] us to pray specific this morning amen
[1:03:35] I'm thinking of a story but I can't
[1:03:37] think of it of how you know somebody
[1:03:42] prayed and you know that they asked for
[1:03:46] certain things I know what it was we
[1:03:48] were in the Philippines a couple years
[1:03:49] ago or a few trips back brother Dolan
[1:03:51] myself you know we were on the island of
[1:03:54] Palawan and it was hot and we thank God
[1:03:57] that they had some fans and a little
[1:03:59] breeze of blowing but we got a call or
[1:04:02] the brothers did from some brothers on
[1:04:04] another island which was about a five
[1:04:06] hour boat ride across the Pacific Ocean
[1:04:08] from one island to the other
[1:04:10] and those brothers said the waves are so
[1:04:12] high we want to come to the meeting but
[1:04:14] we can't get there because of the waves
[1:04:16] and their little boat that we have to
[1:04:18] travel in and it's just not safe said
[1:04:20] would you brothers pray that the wind
[1:04:23] will stop and the waves will settle them
[1:04:25] so we can come so we prayed and brother
[1:04:30] Danny we prayed Lord stop the wind and
[1:04:33] let the waves settle them so those
[1:04:34] brothers can come to the meeting and my
[1:04:37] goodness we prayed and God heard our
[1:04:40] prayer and just in a few hours here come
[1:04:43] those brothers and they made it across
[1:04:44] the sea and they had a tuna about this
[1:04:47] big here and about that big around God
[1:04:50] blessed them with that they could sell
[1:04:51] that and pay for the gas to make the
[1:04:53] trip in the boat
[1:04:59] but we'd like to roast it because we
[1:05:03] didn't pray God's settle down the ways
[1:05:05] but let the wind still blew over here
[1:05:10] now that might be silly but that
[1:05:12] actually happened amen and we'd like to
[1:05:15] have roasted not only did the winds die
[1:05:18] but the electricity went out and we
[1:05:20] didn't have no fans but hallelujah
[1:05:23] anyhow our brothers got to come and God
[1:05:25] bless them with a big fish amen and help
[1:05:28] them to pay the way to get there amen
[1:05:30] stopped the wind amen so what what
[1:05:32] happened amen their condition was not
[1:05:35] their conclusion a man in our condition
[1:05:37] wasn't our conclusion either but thank
[1:05:39] God it was a blessing to them and we saw
[1:05:42] the hand of God move this morning
[1:05:44] Oh let me tell you God is still real
[1:05:46] this morning he's still alive and well
[1:05:51] and we realized that Hezekiah wasn't the
[1:05:53] only one that had conditions if we check
[1:05:55] through the Bible amen in the log of the
[1:05:59] history of men Amen you'll find many
[1:06:02] others have suffered from conditions and
[1:06:04] circumstances and because they had an
[1:06:06] expectation their conclusion was great
[1:06:10] this morning amen
[1:06:11] what is expectation it's nothing more
[1:06:14] than having faith to believe God for a
[1:06:17] testimony amen the Bible declares in
[1:06:21] Revelation 12:11 they overcame him by
[1:06:23] the blood of the Lamb and by the word of
[1:06:26] their testimony amen so you know a lot
[1:06:30] of people say well how can I test if
[1:06:32] I've been healed if I'm still sick
[1:06:34] because you're not looking at the
[1:06:36] condition you're looking at the
[1:06:37] conclusion and the conclusion says by
[1:06:41] whose stripes you were healed amen
[1:06:44] overcoming conditions by the blood of
[1:06:47] the Lamb and Romans 4:17 and call it
[1:06:50] those things which be not as though they
[1:06:52] were amen and believe in God now in my
[1:06:56] conclusion this scene as we come to a
[1:06:58] conclusion
[1:07:01] here by saying that no matter what your
[1:07:03] condition might be it does not have to
[1:07:07] be and it is not your conclusion
[1:07:09] whether you're conditioned be drugs or
[1:07:11] alcohol and I know we're believers here
[1:07:13] this morning smoking their sex or lust
[1:07:16] or pain or abuse or or our oppression or
[1:07:19] depression or discourage some of
[1:07:21] whatever it is this morning that's your
[1:07:23] condition but it does not have to be
[1:07:26] your conclusion God says it's not your
[1:07:30] conclusion it's just a trick of the
[1:07:31] enemy to make you feel that you'll
[1:07:33] always be bound
[1:07:35] can you imagine brother Joseph way back
[1:07:38] down there in the dungeon in Egypt you
[1:07:41] know he talked to the butcher and the
[1:07:44] Baker and said when y'all are restored
[1:07:46] or when the one that's restored remember
[1:07:48] me don't forget about me but he forgot
[1:07:50] about him and here he was did you think
[1:07:52] he meant days went by that he didn't sit
[1:07:55] there and think oh god I'm gonna rot in
[1:07:57] this dungeon how many years did he spend
[1:08:01] there quite a few amen but that was not
[1:08:05] his conclusion because he had already
[1:08:08] had a vision or a night dream amen that
[1:08:12] saw his parents and his brothers bowing
[1:08:15] to him and and him in a position of
[1:08:17] authority God had showed him this
[1:08:20] dungeon is not your conclusion but all
[1:08:23] my the circumstances no doubt many times
[1:08:25] made him doubt and made him worry made
[1:08:27] him concern amen but the end God's time
[1:08:30] and in God's season what happened God
[1:08:32] brought him out of there and placed him
[1:08:35] to where his father and his brothers had
[1:08:37] to come to him and listen to that friend
[1:08:40] amen you got to realize that why do the
[1:08:42] people in the world call you and ask you
[1:08:45] to have your church to pray this morning
[1:08:46] because they know they have seen your
[1:08:49] testimony and heard your testimony of
[1:08:51] the results of your prayers and you're
[1:08:54] calling out to God and they know that
[1:08:56] you are able to touch God where they are
[1:08:59] not this morning we can't come and say
[1:09:08] well grandpa had it great granddaddy had
[1:09:10] it and granddad had it and daddy had it
[1:09:13] and I guess I'll have to deal with it to
[1:09:15] know somebody has to break the cycle
[1:09:21] somebody has to break the change and who
[1:09:25] is that going to be it's going to be me
[1:09:27] this morning a man I'm gonna say you
[1:09:30] don't matter if daddy had a they don't
[1:09:32] matter if granddaddy had a they don't
[1:09:33] matter if great-granddaddy Eddie and
[1:09:35] don't matter of great great great great
[1:09:36] great great game there they had it
[1:09:37] I am defined that thing this morning I'm
[1:09:41] telling it get behind me Satan I'm not
[1:09:44] gonna deal with that or I am gonna deal
[1:09:46] with it I'm gonna put it in this place
[1:09:47] and say it's not mine I don't claim it
[1:09:51] this morning
[1:09:52] I refuse to walk in that I refuse to
[1:09:55] live with that why because I know I am a
[1:09:59] son of God amen and I have been given
[1:10:02] the authority to put the devil in his
[1:10:04] place this morning remember what God
[1:10:09] said through them the Apostle Paul who
[1:10:12] said Corinthians 4:17 for our light
[1:10:14] affliction which is but for a moment
[1:10:16] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[1:10:21] eternal weight of glory amen our our
[1:10:25] afflictions and our conditions amen it's
[1:10:29] it has a purpose as God is molding us
[1:10:33] and shaping us and bringing us this
[1:10:35] morning to a place to where we are
[1:10:37] totally completely submitted to him a
[1:10:41] man Moses had a condition he was a
[1:10:43] murderer
[1:10:44] Exodus 2:12 and you look this way and he
[1:10:47] looked that way and scripture said and
[1:10:49] and when he saw that there was no man he
[1:10:51] slew the Egyptian and he hid him in the
[1:10:53] sand and that was the condition and
[1:10:55] Moses had to flee for his life but that
[1:10:59] wasn't the end of the story God got him
[1:11:03] into a place to where he can wash all of
[1:11:05] that knowledge of Egypt out of him and
[1:11:06] all that
[1:11:07] Pharaoh ism' out of him and put in him a
[1:11:12] ability to speak to God and to hear from
[1:11:16] God and and that God could take that
[1:11:18] vessel and use it to bring about the
[1:11:20] deliverance for the children of Israel
[1:11:22] naman had a condition he was a leper but
[1:11:24] that wasn't his conclusion amen even
[1:11:28] though he balked and even though he said
[1:11:30] ain't there better rivers in in his
[1:11:32] country and then Syrian can I go
[1:11:34] there amen but sometimes we just got to
[1:11:37] listen to the Word of God and to be
[1:11:38] obedient to that if when we do then our
[1:11:41] condition changes tonight and their
[1:11:43] conclusion it's not what the condition
[1:11:46] was brother Branham says in the ten
[1:11:49] virgins 144,000 he said now that's the
[1:11:52] type of the gospel trumping you might
[1:11:54] have served the devil we read this in
[1:11:56] the beginning all these years and chains
[1:11:57] with drinking smoking gambling sin and
[1:12:00] dirty things no matter what you've done
[1:12:01] but when you hear the gospel trumpet
[1:12:03] sound it's a sign that you can go free
[1:12:06] you can go faith cometh by hearing
[1:12:08] hearing of the word of God now you've
[1:12:11] heard the full gospel you don't have to
[1:12:14] stay bound any longer thirsting for life
[1:12:16] so you see the same God with Florence
[1:12:19] Nightingale there is the same God that's
[1:12:22] right here he's the same one and the
[1:12:24] only thing you don't have to wait to be
[1:12:26] prayed for the only thing you have to do
[1:12:28] is just believe that the work is done if
[1:12:31] you're a sinner you don't have to wait
[1:12:33] for an altar call right where you're
[1:12:35] sitting while Peter yet straighten these
[1:12:37] words the Holy Ghost fell on them that
[1:12:39] heard the word they were ready it's a
[1:12:41] condition of the heart it's a condition
[1:12:44] of the people who listen this morning if
[1:12:48] there's someone here that has a
[1:12:51] condition there's someone here that has
[1:12:53] a circumstance I want to tell you that
[1:12:56] is a condition but it is not the
[1:12:59] conclusion that's not what God has in
[1:13:03] mind for you that's not what God wants
[1:13:05] you to be God wants you to be healed he
[1:13:08] wants you to be delivered he wants you
[1:13:10] to be free this morning he wants you to
[1:13:12] be happy and joyous he wants you to
[1:13:14] rejoice in the good things of God this
[1:13:17] morning
[1:13:17] you don't have to remain there and in
[1:13:21] order not to remain there you have to
[1:13:23] walk in faith and believe what God see
[1:13:26] it and you can have the results this
[1:13:28] morning stand with me if you will just
[1:13:38] remember you're not at the end you're
[1:13:42] just at the beginning of your conclusion
[1:13:45] right amen and when when when
[1:13:48] you when you walk in faith and look to
[1:13:53] God for that expected Ian that he has
[1:13:55] for you then God will honor your faith
[1:13:58] to signing to him that believe us what
[1:14:03] the scriptures say all things are
[1:14:05] possible
[1:14:07] amen maybe this morning is we bow our
[1:14:10] heads you're here and there's a
[1:14:13] condition that you're dealing with a
[1:14:15] circumstance a situation sickness
[1:14:20] whatever it is this morning God is able
[1:14:24] he sent his word the scripture said and
[1:14:27] the power of God was present to heal
[1:14:31] these are not things that brother Joe
[1:14:33] just made up these are things we've
[1:14:34] taken from the word from the message of
[1:14:36] the hour and we believe it's true this
[1:14:39] morning we believe it's accurate we
[1:14:43] believe it's right and we believe that
[1:14:46] God will keep his word if you've got a
[1:14:50] need this morning just lift your hand if
[1:14:52] you would God knows every circumstance
[1:14:55] Heavenly Father as we bow our heads
[1:14:58] before you this morning Lord we know
[1:15:01] that your word has declared that our
[1:15:04] condition is not our conclusion and Lord
[1:15:08] we we believe this morning that as the
[1:15:13] word has gone forth that the power of
[1:15:16] God has been present to heal just like
[1:15:19] the scripture we read their Lord less
[1:15:21] Peter was yet speaking unto them the
[1:15:24] Holy Ghost fell upon them and Lord we
[1:15:27] believe that as the words have been
[1:15:29] spoken this morning that your healing
[1:15:31] virtue can fall it's already been paid
[1:15:34] for Lord it's already been provided your
[1:15:36] deliverance your salvation your victory
[1:15:39] your joy it's already been provided this
[1:15:42] morning then we believe as the word has
[1:15:44] gone forth God it could fall and it has
[1:15:49] fallen and it's spoken two hearts and
[1:15:51] quicken to them they're free they're
[1:15:54] walking in deliverance this morning
[1:15:56] they're walking in victory because Lord
[1:15:59] is as the
[1:16:01] one of the earlier songs that was saying
[1:16:03] this morning victory in Jesus and we
[1:16:06] believe that this morning with all of
[1:16:07] our hearts that there is victory there's
[1:16:10] there's joy there's peace there's
[1:16:13] deliverance Lord in the name of Jesus
