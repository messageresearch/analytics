[0:00] brotherly kindness
[0:14] okay
[0:20] brotherly kindness this one's going to
[0:22] be tough
[0:27] all right come on
[0:30] come on
[0:32] come on there you go good boy
[0:34] all right
[0:36] brotherly kindness
[0:38] let's read now
[0:40] second peter one
[0:44] follow along simon peter our servant
[0:46] apostle of jesus christ to them that
[0:48] have obtained
[0:49] light precious faith with us through the
[0:50] righteousness of god and our savior
[0:52] jesus christ
[0:54] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[0:56] through the knowledge of god and jesus
[0:58] our lord
[0:59] according as his divine power has given
[1:02] unto us all things that pertain to the
[1:03] life and godliness what we're talking
[1:05] about
[1:06] excuse me through the knowledge of him
[1:07] they have called us for lord virtue
[1:10] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:12] great and precious promises that by
[1:14] these you might be protectors of the
[1:15] divine nature i mean escape the
[1:17] corruption those in the world do lust
[1:20] and besides this give me all diligence
[1:23] that's not gonna be something that god's
[1:24] gonna just give to you
[1:26] these are victories they are character
[1:29] victories right
[1:31] it's a character victory
[1:33] besides just giving all diligence and to
[1:35] your faith virtues your virtual
[1:36] knowledge knowledge temperance temper
[1:38] patience patience goblin is godless
[1:40] brother kindness
[1:41] and brother kindness charity where
[1:43] things be in you and abound they make
[1:46] you
[1:47] that you should not be barren or
[1:49] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[1:50] jesus christ
[1:52] so all these things together is going to
[1:53] make us a very fruitful person because
[1:56] the next scripture says
[1:58] that if you like these things you're
[1:59] blind right
[2:01] see we'll we'll read that maybe next
[2:03] time if you like these things you're
[2:04] blind you can't see it far off it's not
[2:06] that you're not born again it's just
[2:08] that you're blinded
[2:12] to the other virtues or you're blinded
[2:14] to a certain part of the word
[2:16] and you will not be
[2:20] fruitful you will be barren in other
[2:23] words you want to produce anything
[2:25] somebody's barren can't produce
[2:30] all right so it's very important here we
[2:32] are up to brotherly kindness
[2:35] brother brown didn't speak a whole lot
[2:36] on brotherly kindness but he preached
[2:38] the whole
[2:39] his whole 1100 sermons was on brotherly
[2:41] kindness right
[2:43] and he was trying to get natural
[2:44] brothers pentecostals baptist methodists
[2:46] come together
[2:48] now what we're trying to do is we're
[2:50] trying to get the message people
[2:52] together
[2:53] you know
[2:56] and not just see it our way right that's
[2:58] not the that's not the uh
[3:01] there's a watch this right here
[3:03] then sixthly they said the bible said
[3:05] adding
[3:06] brotherly love brotherly kindness now
[3:09] that's a good one right here the sixth
[3:10] one seven
[3:12] seven right up there brotherly kindness
[3:14] all right adding brotherly kindness all
[3:16] right
[3:16] we got it when we get to that brotherly
[3:19] kindness put yourself in his place on
[3:21] the matter
[3:23] put yourself in his place on the mayor
[3:24] where'd you come from
[3:30] that's what i'm saying
[3:36] hey bro good to have you with us
[3:38] good to have you with us
[3:40] good to see you good to see you
[3:43] where was i scaring me today
[3:47] now you say my brother sinned against me
[3:49] said peter shall i forgive him he said
[3:51] seven times a day he said seventy times
[3:55] seven
[3:57] how much is that
[3:58] 490.
[4:03] how long did israel
[4:05] 400 490. so there you are
[4:08] god's going to forgive israel in the 490
[4:11] years
[4:12] 70 times seven brotherly kindness now
[4:15] you see if a brother is all out of tune
[4:18] don't be impatient with it
[4:22] hello
[4:23] anybody home i think
[4:25] don't be impatient with it remember we
[4:28] were supposed to get patience
[4:31] before that
[4:33] okay
[4:34] because see to me like i told you all
[4:35] before
[4:36] this is number 48
[4:39] of of this this statue of a perfect man
[4:42] it's all sure it all winds up into
[4:44] charity but this thing all winds up and
[4:46] the key is brotherly kindness
[4:50] because right there at the pyramid
[4:52] there's brotherly kindness right before
[4:53] the holy spirit seals everything into
[4:55] you and brings the capstone down because
[4:58] remember you can have faith which is a
[5:00] rock
[5:01] you can have virtue which is a rock
[5:03] temperance which is a raw patience are
[5:05] godliness revelation right but when you
[5:08] come to brotherly kindness if you've got
[5:10] paper
[5:12] you understand the analogy
[5:15] that headstone is a rock
[5:17] if you got rock rock rock rock and then
[5:19] you think well i can pass by a little
[5:21] brother kindness i'll just i'll just
[5:23] make it a little paper i just you know
[5:25] i'll just pretend like i love my brother
[5:27] you know
[5:29] you know pretend like ben's a good guy
[5:31] and not me
[5:32] but
[5:35] that's what he said no
[5:37] but
[5:38] but brotherly kindness has got to be a
[5:40] rock also
[5:42] all right that headstone is not going to
[5:44] come on anything but the rock if you
[5:46] started with a rock in the foundation
[5:48] which is faith then brotherly kindness
[5:50] cannot be
[5:52] what any other material so brotherly
[5:55] kindness is just as important and to me
[5:57] it's the key to bring you right up into
[5:59] that statue of a perfect man
[6:01] into the headstone which is love which
[6:03] is not
[6:06] love at all it's a gopher level brother
[6:09] kindness now see if her brother is all
[6:10] out of tomb don't be impatient with him
[6:12] be kind to him go anyhow
[6:15] somebody said not long ago how can you
[6:17] believe these things the way you do and
[6:19] still go to the assemblies of god one
[6:20] that's all the rest
[6:22] then put seed brother to kindness cc
[6:24] hoping someday see
[6:25] patience with him see temperate enduring
[6:28] with him knowledge to understand you
[6:30] watch what he's doing to me brotherly
[6:32] kindness is all these other virtues
[6:33] wrapped up into one right
[6:35] yeah
[6:36] it's all these perches wrapped up into
[6:38] one number one you've got to have faith
[6:40] brother claude was talking the other day
[6:41] and he's preaching on the statue of
[6:42] perfect man
[6:44] that he's doing it also
[6:46] because people are seeing the importance
[6:47] in the statue of a perfect man i think
[6:49] the ones that's going to make it to the
[6:50] headstone you're just not going to be
[6:52] standing somewhere and the heads don't
[6:53] follow you right they're going to rock
[6:55] following you one day but it'll be one
[6:56] of them 90 pound talents that they talk
[6:57] about in the book of revelation
[7:00] that's right that's not a headstone
[7:05] that's a literal phone
[7:07] that's right
[7:08] that's what somebody asked me one time
[7:10] said well you're
[7:11] you're you can't um
[7:13] talk about this dress and all this stuff
[7:15] and some of the old testament said what
[7:16] are you going to do so they used to
[7:17] stone people when when they did things
[7:19] wrong in the old testament i said don't
[7:21] worry
[7:23] go over there in revelations and read
[7:24] with them 90 pound stones win 90 pound
[7:27] hailstones
[7:29] are going to pound this earth and pound
[7:30] the people they're going to get their
[7:31] stone in
[7:32] it's just they're going to get it over
[7:34] there you know and not like they did in
[7:36] the old testament but it is a type of
[7:38] it's the same thing it's the ending up
[7:39] of all things that stoning in the old
[7:41] testament was the type of this world
[7:42] being stoned in the new testament all
[7:44] right
[7:46] it's like brother uh
[7:48] bob was bringing out really good the
[7:49] other night and i never thought about
[7:50] that smart as i land thought about that
[7:52] so
[7:53] it was good
[7:55] about i'll be fishers of men and then
[7:58] the fish the fish being the trout you
[8:00] know and all the ground will come like a
[8:02] third pool that's what jesus was telling
[8:04] the people right he said i'm coming to
[8:06] fish these people out i'm coming you
[8:09] know i'm coming back but i'm not i'm not
[8:10] gonna do it myself i'm gonna do it
[8:12] through here
[8:13] so brother brown's standing there
[8:14] fishing what's he doing he's fishing for
[8:16] trout
[8:18] which
[8:18] is what
[8:20] if these fishers are men then that trout
[8:22] is me and you
[8:23] that's what he's catching he's catching
[8:25] the people
[8:26] bringing them in first pull got their
[8:27] attention second pull brought him in a
[8:29] little bit closer bigger fists and then
[8:31] the third pull was the was the big great
[8:33] big one all right
[8:34] so a wonderful type there and it was it
[8:36] was really good
[8:38] having faith that someday having faith
[8:43] having faith so he dropped right back
[8:46] down like brother and i were talking
[8:47] about you got to have faith for every
[8:48] one of these
[8:49] you never leave that foundation of faith
[8:51] you got to have faith that god gives you
[8:53] virtue
[8:54] you got to have faith that god gives you
[8:56] knowledge tim you gotta have faith that
[8:57] god gives you these things everything's
[8:59] built on faith because there's no way
[9:01] you can buy it
[9:02] you can't get a receipt for it
[9:04] you'd be nice to say well when i get
[9:06] when i get knowledge god's going to give
[9:07] me a receipt and say now you have
[9:09] knowledge
[9:10] that would be wonderful
[9:12] but that's not the way god is because
[9:14] we're going to have knowledge all the
[9:15] way up through right
[9:17] until the end
[9:18] of brother
[9:20] brother brown brought us the word but it
[9:22] takes a five-fold ministry to break it
[9:24] down to the people
[9:27] having faith that some day
[9:29] now not when you want him to come
[9:32] that's the whole problem
[9:34] we want people to see it just as quick
[9:35] as
[9:36] as you tell them exactly ain't gonna
[9:39] happen
[9:40] now some will but some won't right
[9:43] i like the ones that come in kicking and
[9:44] screaming and fighting i've told you
[9:46] that many times before if somebody ever
[9:47] walks in this door and says this is the
[9:49] greatest thing since sliced bread and
[9:51] we've never heard of this and this is
[9:52] the greatest thing and
[9:54] blah blah blah six months later they're
[9:56] gone that's right because they just get
[9:58] a feeling they just get an emotion
[10:01] but somebody that comes in and six
[10:02] months later they're going i don't know
[10:04] about this one god business i don't know
[10:06] about this um i'm still waiting toward
[10:09] you know i go well that's fine you just
[10:10] stay right there right
[10:12] having faith that someday
[10:15] you'll bring him in
[10:17] no that's not what that says
[10:20] that's what we want to do we want to
[10:21] bring them in
[10:23] we want to hold them over the fire no
[10:26] knowing faith that someday god will
[10:27] bring them in
[10:28] all right
[10:29] brotherly
[10:30] thing one kindness
[10:31] three four five six seven program taps
[10:33] on trump work
[10:34] then you're coming now remember he goes
[10:36] over into blasphemous names
[10:38] and continues and expounds on the statue
[10:41] of a perfect man right
[10:42] now in this church age the message is
[10:44] being poured into the church but the
[10:45] church body itself is all together like
[10:48] this tabernacle will say
[10:50] that's where she comes to the church
[10:51] this tabernacle is not a holy ghost
[10:53] tabernacle there's no such thing
[10:55] individuals that come into this church
[10:58] is holy ghost tabernacle right there are
[11:00] tabernacles that contain the holy ghost
[11:02] but not the church body a group
[11:03] therefore it runs out but what this man
[11:06] was pouring now what he's doing is and
[11:08] we're going to read it probably next
[11:09] sunday
[11:10] to just kind of solidify everything
[11:12] together we're going to read sister
[11:13] shepard's dream
[11:15] remember her dream she dreams that she
[11:16] was standing and looking at this thing
[11:19] and he somebody
[11:20] that was water being poured in and
[11:22] brother brown explains all that he talks
[11:24] about honey and he talks about things
[11:26] like that so
[11:27] we're going to do it next sunday
[11:30] but i want to just lay a foundation for
[11:31] this brotherly kind that says we're
[11:32] going to steal brother the kind is
[11:33] pretty good pretty good bet all right
[11:36] but he talked about but this man was
[11:38] pouring the water the messenger to the
[11:40] church pouring the message into the
[11:42] church but what was water doing
[11:46] now it was boiling out all the trash now
[11:48] i really like that
[11:51] he said what's going on morning and i
[11:53] don't have any trash no that's not
[11:54] what's that's not what that
[11:56] right that's not what that uh
[11:58] vision or or dream was all about right
[12:01] there stood sister shepard a holy
[12:03] ghost-filled woman
[12:05] brother branham and type of the man was
[12:08] pouring the water in and what was coming
[12:10] out trash there was still trash in that
[12:13] tabernacle that had to be cleaned out
[12:15] even after the new birth
[12:18] sure it's getting the excess trash out
[12:21] like i told you last sunday we're we're
[12:24] we have our foreskin we have the excess
[12:26] skin taken off at the new birth right
[12:29] right but there's still excess what did
[12:31] i tell you this is your biggest organ of
[12:33] your body your skin is the biggest organ
[12:35] in your body it covers 99 of your body
[12:38] so this is what the problem is
[12:41] your natural heart is not the problem
[12:43] lungs
[12:44] liver whatever
[12:46] it's your skin it's your flesh that's
[12:48] right that's where the problem is all
[12:49] right
[12:50] but now remember that's what these
[12:52] virtues and if it was given
[12:54] and promised it's a requirement then
[12:58] god's made a way for us to do it
[13:01] so it's not unattainable poor little
[13:03] sister shepard was probably just a
[13:05] housewife
[13:06] a little granny that lived at home
[13:09] but god gave her a dream
[13:11] and there was the vision of her going up
[13:13] the statue of a perfect man because
[13:14] that's what it was it was remember it
[13:16] was coming down and then the water was
[13:17] running over her feet right
[13:20] she had something to do with the with
[13:22] the with the vision the water was
[13:24] running on her feet
[13:26] so here we are back to us the water's
[13:28] got to run on our feet
[13:30] and remember
[13:32] feet stands for what
[13:34] redemption
[13:36] she was being born again
[13:39] she had a first birth
[13:41] but peter says being born again see
[13:42] peter's one who could know
[13:44] that because he's the one who went up
[13:45] the statue of a perfect man being born
[13:48] again
[13:50] everybody got that that's good
[13:53] that was the holy spirit that's what the
[13:55] holy spirit does
[13:56] boils it up now
[13:58] now the honey represented brotherly love
[14:01] brotherly kindness which is this age i
[14:03] just got through telling see a brotherly
[14:05] kindness the age that we live in now
[14:09] so the honey
[14:11] represents brotherly kindness well that
[14:13] right here is brother kindness right
[14:15] here and that honey is the holy spirit
[14:17] that brother brown we'll talk about a
[14:19] little bit later but he talks about
[14:20] sealing this in
[14:23] all right we're going to seal this in
[14:24] with something
[14:26] got it
[14:28] we get all the way up here that's one of
[14:29] the people in the message a lot of
[14:30] people say well no you don't get warning
[14:32] angel up here well that's absolutely not
[14:34] true that's right because this is the
[14:35] faith of god the virtue of god the
[14:37] knowledge of god the temple of god the
[14:38] patience of god the godliness of god
[14:41] right and the brother of the kindness of
[14:42] god how are you going to get how are you
[14:44] going to know anything about god if you
[14:45] don't have his spirit in him that's
[14:46] right that's right there's no way you
[14:48] can understand any of this without
[14:50] having the new birth right down here in
[14:51] the baby form no way
[14:54] the people on the day of pentecost they
[14:56] had to get the new birth
[15:00] right peter had to get the new bird
[15:01] before you could understand and write
[15:03] add to your faith virtue your virgin
[15:05] olive temperature
[15:06] peter had to get the new birth before he
[15:08] could say being born again
[15:10] being born again right
[15:12] so that means he was born one time he
[15:14] had to be born again all right being
[15:15] born again
[15:17] but then you come here to this part
[15:21] excuse me
[15:23] we've been having fun for our past few
[15:24] days and we've been talking and laughing
[15:26] and picking up for excuse my
[15:28] excuse my voice but the holy spirit is
[15:30] that honey that seals them because i'm
[15:31] going to tell you something that's like
[15:33] i said before this
[15:35] is
[15:36] god
[15:37] that is jesus christ
[15:40] himself
[15:42] that love that's jesus christ himself
[15:45] that's not love for your wife love for
[15:47] your parents
[15:48] that that has nothing to do
[15:50] with feel your love right feel your love
[15:53] can turn you into it can go to lust
[15:55] right remember brother brown said it
[15:57] starts out against love for your wife
[15:59] then love for your parents and then love
[16:01] for your children then it drops and just
[16:02] keeps right going on down to lust and
[16:04] that's what satan did he took it right
[16:05] on down the lust and the things of the
[16:07] flesh but this is divine love so it's
[16:10] the divine nature of god
[16:14] the holy spirit's sealing everything off
[16:16] but you've got to have that brotherly
[16:17] kindness it's right there and it's very
[16:19] narrow
[16:21] doesn't mean you don't have to have less
[16:22] of it it means that a lot most people
[16:24] are not going to get it right
[16:26] a lot of people are going to get faith
[16:29] but a lot of people are not going to
[16:30] handle that brotherly kindness now the
[16:31] honey represented brotherly love brother
[16:33] the kindness which is this age i just
[16:34] got blue telling of probably kindness
[16:37] the age that we live in now
[16:39] now you might say look i sure don't like
[16:41] brother neville
[16:43] or sure i don't like brother jones i
[16:45] don't like bro so-and-so
[16:47] and something like that but just let
[16:48] something happen to him brother your
[16:50] heart's broken he just nearly killed you
[16:53] see we can obtain brotherly kindness and
[16:55] feeling for one another
[16:57] see but to maintain in a group of people
[17:01] that's the
[17:02] problem you see what he's talking about
[17:06] to maintain that in a group of people
[17:10] why do you care for that brother because
[17:12] you broke bread with him here at the
[17:13] altar as you will tonight you fellowship
[17:15] with him you shook his hand you worship
[17:16] with him he's your brother and he might
[17:18] do something in the flesh that you would
[17:20] disagree with because you just kind of
[17:23] stay what you ought to do but shine him
[17:25] a little
[17:27] but in the bottom of your heart if
[17:29] something happened to that brother it
[17:31] would just nearly kill you or that
[17:33] sister i'm an old man i was once young
[17:35] now i'm old i've seen it down to the
[17:37] ages do that hear people saying i just
[17:39] won't have no more to do with him and
[17:41] something happened to that man it nearly
[17:44] kills him he thinks oh god let my
[17:45] precious brother go without making
[17:47] friends with him you see see see it's
[17:49] brotherly love it looks like it won't
[17:52] stick
[17:53] but it does stick
[17:55] the honey it sticks
[17:58] we may do a little we may do a little
[18:00] part on honey may type it into
[18:03] this part right here we'll see
[18:07] and then let's read this one
[18:09] that's the way god does the church he
[18:11] beats every creed every denomination
[18:13] every man-made dogma until he sees his
[18:15] own life reflecting in you now that's
[18:16] what he's doing here remember these are
[18:19] character developments
[18:21] uh brother keith reed called them the
[18:23] trials of life and that's exactly what
[18:24] it is because remember we read a
[18:26] scripture where i said it pertained to
[18:28] life and godliness so this pertains to
[18:30] natural life that we live
[18:32] and being a christian
[18:34] which should be the same but remember we
[18:36] do do things in life that's
[18:39] not always christian
[18:41] oh you don't
[18:44] i don't mean bob
[18:46] that's right that's right
[18:50] you're the one telling the truth
[18:55] if i do not listen if i do not the works
[18:57] of my father believe me not see if that
[19:00] if what is purpose to the church now
[19:02] what's purpose to the church
[19:04] ii peter that's purpose to the church
[19:07] that's a promise
[19:09] right that by these promises we read
[19:11] these divine promises
[19:13] that you'll receive the divine nature of
[19:15] god
[19:17] the life see what it
[19:19] if what is purpose to the church the
[19:21] life that was in christ isn't reflecting
[19:23] on you don't you stand still if you
[19:24] haven't got patience virtue all these
[19:26] things temperance and things godliness
[19:28] brotherly kindness and all these things
[19:30] that's required of you
[19:34] all right they're required
[19:36] they're not just a pretty chart to look
[19:38] at and something phillip takes me
[19:41] no it's a requirement
[19:43] and it's a holy requirement
[19:46] okay
[19:47] no matter what you've done no matter how
[19:49] much you've shouted how many churches
[19:51] you've joined how many feathers you've
[19:52] pinned into yourself don't do it
[19:55] wait till genuinely from your heart you
[19:57] can forgive
[19:59] to your heart you have brotherly
[20:01] kindness
[20:02] no matter if they pull a handful of
[20:05] beard from one side you can turn the
[20:06] other cheek with sweetness see
[20:08] until those virtues no matter what they
[20:11] say to you
[20:13] so until those virtues come it will
[20:15] matter what people say about you know
[20:16] all these things but
[20:18] when it comes down to where
[20:20] they pulled jesus beard out and they did
[20:22] all the things to him
[20:24] he could have stopped the whole process
[20:25] he could have had him
[20:27] he could they could have been zapped out
[20:28] of existence
[20:30] right that's right he could have done it
[20:32] you could have called ten thousand
[20:34] angels as the song goes but he didn't
[20:36] he says if i do not the works of my
[20:38] father believe me not
[20:40] and then remember when we were talking
[20:42] about godliness
[20:43] we were talking about godliness and here
[20:44] we are at uh
[20:47] at brotherly kindness
[20:49] that godliness just it just to me it
[20:51] flows right over into brother county
[20:53] remember
[20:54] we're going to read the dream next
[20:55] sunday
[20:56] it didn't
[20:58] the the honey didn't flow down to
[21:00] brotherly kindness and stop
[21:02] it flowed all the way down
[21:05] and all the trash that come out it
[21:07] flowed all the way down so in other
[21:08] words it was cleaning that tabernacle
[21:10] out
[21:12] so that god now god dwells in you at the
[21:14] new birth everybody understand that
[21:16] right
[21:17] that's that's god god says i am pleased
[21:19] to dwell in you just like at the river
[21:21] jordan
[21:22] a type where jesus standing there and
[21:24] this is my beloved son who in whom i'm
[21:26] pleased to dwell when you receive the
[21:27] new birth god is pleased to dwell there
[21:31] but he's not pleased with a lot of
[21:32] things that we do
[21:33] but he's pleased to dwell in your soul
[21:35] but remember we got to get that memories
[21:36] and conscious affection
[21:38] we don't worry about see tasteful
[21:40] smelling here right we talked about that
[21:42] last sunday remember that we don't worry
[21:43] about sea taste fields smelling here
[21:46] you can't help seeing what you see in
[21:48] this world right but when you take it
[21:49] down into your memory reason conscious
[21:51] affection and imagination and you cook
[21:53] that thing
[21:55] that's the problem
[21:57] now if you're born again it can't get
[21:58] any further if you're not
[22:01] see my problem was when i wasn't born
[22:02] again there was no filter it just soaked
[22:05] right down into the soul and soul said
[22:06] yeah i like what i see right here right
[22:09] you see what i'm talking about
[22:11] but now since you have a new birth which
[22:13] burnt satan out he can't get into that
[22:15] soul
[22:17] but he can get into that spirit realm
[22:19] he's in that memory reason conscious
[22:21] affection imagination
[22:22] and he's that's his
[22:24] playground but to me these virtues is
[22:27] driving him out
[22:30] now remember we're still going to have
[22:31] our memory of things we've done right up
[22:32] to the chains i don't think god's going
[22:34] to wipe our memory out until we get on
[22:35] the other side
[22:37] amen
[22:38] we're going to and even on the other
[22:39] side we're gonna know where we came from
[22:41] we're just not gonna remember the bad
[22:42] things because the bible says foreign
[22:43] things have passed away behold all
[22:45] things are becoming new we'll be able to
[22:47] sit and talk about the things of god and
[22:49] the glorious things of god we won't talk
[22:50] about the bad things but still the bad
[22:52] things are going to be in our memory but
[22:54] what we have to do is
[22:56] we have to remember one thing if jesus
[22:58] said we can do it
[23:00] and he said he was going to come back
[23:01] remember i was preaching oh my god
[23:03] he's the god of my life brother graham
[23:05] preached that the night after the statue
[23:06] of her of the statue of perfect man he
[23:08] preached the god of my life all right
[23:11] if you take that guide and let him do it
[23:13] now remember you can override that
[23:17] you can
[23:19] you can override that your free moral
[23:21] agency
[23:22] i'm going to make a statement here your
[23:24] free moral agency is more powerful than
[23:26] god
[23:29] because god won't override your free
[23:30] moral agency
[23:32] god's not going to make you
[23:35] do anything right if he is he's a
[23:37] respecter of persons and he made you do
[23:39] this and he can't judge you for it
[23:41] everything has to be what you thought of
[23:44] what you think what you say what you do
[23:47] then god can judge you for that right
[23:49] man that's right i mean i that's the way
[23:51] i see it i if not then we're just a
[23:53] bunch of zombies we just we just get the
[23:55] holy ghost and we
[23:57] you know we're like no
[23:59] god
[24:00] but remember
[24:02] on the other side he foreknew
[24:05] so he knew what you would choose before
[24:07] you chose that's right
[24:09] but he can't make you choose
[24:12] anything
[24:13] right he leaves you on free moral agency
[24:15] to decide what you want to do and then
[24:17] you know what you can be a just judge
[24:19] when you do that
[24:21] but you can't be a just judge if god
[24:23] just says well i picked peggy dale
[24:26] and and i pulled her right through life
[24:27] and and she i had all this waiting well
[24:31] the reason he had all that waiting for
[24:33] us because one day she
[24:35] chose him right right
[24:37] exactly amen that's the way we see in
[24:39] this church foreign knowledge comes
[24:41] before predestination
[24:43] god foreknew those who he for knew he
[24:45] did predestinate the only way he could
[24:48] make your destiny determined beforehand
[24:50] is because he knew before
[24:52] what your destiny was going to be
[24:54] he knew what you would choose
[24:56] he knew that you would go
[24:58] so far at the statue of a perfect man
[25:00] and not going any further he knows that
[25:01] but we don't
[25:03] but he get but he didn't say well now i
[25:05] know bob's only going to come to
[25:06] temperance so i'm not going to give him
[25:08] anything else i'm not going to give him
[25:09] nothing to work with no he gives him
[25:11] everything to work with but he's going
[25:13] to say it
[25:14] at the end he's going to say now bob you
[25:16] stopped the temperance you didn't you
[25:17] didn't have faith to go to knowledge
[25:21] is that okay that all right i mean we
[25:22] are we are we're little gods now when he
[25:25] says we're little gods that's exactly
[25:26] what we are we're little creators we can
[25:29] create this in ourself
[25:32] it's there
[25:33] all right
[25:34] but in brotherly kindness
[25:36] you're gonna have to wrap all these up
[25:38] remember you see what he just said
[25:40] gotta have knowledge number one you
[25:42] gotta have knowledge whether the
[25:43] person's right or wrong
[25:45] temperance
[25:47] remember don't let your temper flare up
[25:48] if you don't agree with you exactly the
[25:50] way you you know see it the way you said
[25:52] have patience
[25:54] and then you know what
[25:56] brother brown they said they
[25:58] billy paul said the one thing about his
[25:59] daddy was you didn't know who his
[26:01] enemies
[26:02] are his friends were another
[26:05] you can't say that about me
[26:09] and i can't say that about me
[26:11] you can't say that about you yeah
[26:13] that's right
[26:14] some of you are close
[26:16] but some of us haven't we know who we're
[26:18] against and who we're for and you know
[26:19] who we're against and who we're for but
[26:21] when you take brother brown with a guy
[26:23] that people hated his guts hated for him
[26:25] to be even be in the room with him
[26:28] yeah he treated him exactly
[26:30] like that person don't tell me that
[26:32] prophet didn't know
[26:34] where there's a familiar spirit and an
[26:36] unfamiliar spirit he knew that he had to
[26:38] override that spirit see that's
[26:40] something we don't do
[26:42] that's good i just got there
[26:44] that's good we have to over we have to
[26:46] override that spirit that tells me that
[26:48] man's against me
[26:49] right because humanly
[26:52] but when they look for love projects
[26:54] brother brown said grace takes over so
[26:56] when love projects that grace will take
[26:59] over and you'll say okay the brother's
[27:00] not right or he's doing something wrong
[27:02] it's just bear with him now look you
[27:04] don't have to get into the slop with it
[27:06] or hurt don't get in the slot with them
[27:08] don't say well i'm not going to church
[27:10] because they're not going to church i'm
[27:11] going to go testify to him on sunday no
[27:13] the best way for you to testify is you'd
[27:15] be here right and then draw them right
[27:18] to you okay let's go upstairs
[27:21] we have a few extra people so
[27:24] when you walk in don't look at somebody
[27:26] like they got
