[0:00] i feel like when david said i was glad
[0:02] when they said let's go to the house of
[0:03] the lord
[0:13] so we're reading in hebrews chapter 4 uh
[0:16] about about rest
[0:18] and uh the difference between labor and
[0:20] rest and kind of going into that
[0:23] movement moving from labor to rest
[0:27] let's just ask ask the lord's blessing
[0:29] before we begin studying lord we just
[0:31] thank you so much for
[0:33] your grace to us and for your many
[0:34] blessings and for being able to gather
[0:36] around your word and we just ask your
[0:38] blessing upon the services today and
[0:40] upon this this little study that we're
[0:42] about to embark on we pray lord that you
[0:44] will just help us now in your name
[0:47] so in hebrews chapter 4 verses 1 to 5 it
[0:50] said let us therefore fear lest a
[0:51] promise being left left us of entering
[0:54] into his rest any of you should seem to
[0:56] come short of it
[0:58] for unto us was the gospel preached
[1:01] as well as unto them but the word
[1:02] preached did not profit them not being
[1:04] mixed with faith in them that heard it
[1:07] we which have believed to enter into
[1:08] rest as he said as i have sworn in my
[1:11] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[1:13] although the works were finished from
[1:14] the foundation of the world
[1:17] excuse me
[1:18] for he spake in a certain place of the
[1:20] seventh day on this wise and god did
[1:23] rest the seventh day from all his works
[1:25] and in this place again if they shall
[1:27] enter into my wrist
[1:29] so we're talking about rest and you know
[1:31] rest is when you um
[1:33] when you uh you know you first hear
[1:35] about the gospel and you and you you're
[1:37] you're you you kind of beg you become
[1:39] interested in it and you become begin to
[1:42] become convicted that you need to be
[1:43] saved that something's wrong in your
[1:45] life and you begin to start working
[1:47] things out like the bible says work out
[1:49] your salvation with fear and trembling
[1:50] and you begin to labor and you you're
[1:52] you're trying to you're you're trying to
[1:54] work out how things work and and you're
[1:57] laboring to enter into that place
[1:59] and we'll dive into that a little bit
[2:01] more but rest rest is where you when god
[2:04] reveals to you that that the work is
[2:06] finished and you're at a place where of
[2:08] course we're resting what are we resting
[2:09] and we're resting in his promises we're
[2:11] resting in the word what what god said
[2:14] but sometimes it what's what's hard for
[2:16] us to do is to is to to really
[2:18] understand um
[2:20] what is laying there in the page but
[2:22] when the holy ghost lifts it off the
[2:24] page and reveals it to you and it makes
[2:26] it plain to you then that's something
[2:28] you can rest on like like you know
[2:30] whether that be healing or you know if
[2:32] you know you labor to to be healed in
[2:34] your body and you're praying and you're
[2:36] you're you're go searching through
[2:37] scriptures for for for scriptures you
[2:39] know something to give you faith but
[2:41] then when god speaks to you that you're
[2:43] healed then you're you're rest you're at
[2:45] rest you're resting on that promise and
[2:48] it's it's something that you already got
[2:50] maybe it's not yet manifested in your
[2:52] body but you're resting in that so rest
[2:54] at rest is a place that god brings us to
[2:57] not by not by some feeling or sensation
[2:59] so much but because that god reveals
[3:01] something to you that reveals it and
[3:03] it's made plain to you in your heart and
[3:05] down on the inside of your soul even
[3:07] though the rest of the world may be in
[3:09] turmoil the rains and the sleet and the
[3:11] snow and all that but down on the inside
[3:13] you're at rest
[3:16] so so we've got to follow this pattern
[3:17] of labor and then rest it you know we
[3:19] looked at in genesis when god created
[3:21] the world he he labored for six days and
[3:24] then he rested
[3:25] after after six days
[3:28] he had done everything so now he just
[3:29] stepped back and took a look at his work
[3:31] and he you know marveled at you know he
[3:34] was satisfied and all that he had done
[3:37] and he rested
[3:38] and so you see these same patterns
[3:40] repeated through the scripture and i
[3:42] think you know you want to look for
[3:43] patterns because that helps us to
[3:45] understand uh what we're doing here and
[3:47] where we're going and where we are in
[3:49] the road map of of of life
[3:51] and so that's why in colossians chapter
[3:53] 2 it says um it says that you know these
[3:56] old testament patterns and things
[3:57] they're given for us as a type as a
[4:00] shadow of
[4:02] of the real thing
[4:03] which is why paul said
[4:05] um let no man therefore judge you and
[4:07] meet her and drink in respect of a holy
[4:09] day or the new moon or the sabbath days
[4:11] which are a shadow of things to come but
[4:13] the body the body or the thing that
[4:15] that's that's you're looking at the
[4:17] shadow of is of christ so in the old
[4:19] testament you're looking at the shadow
[4:20] but the body is the thing being uh
[4:23] that's casting the shadow the body is of
[4:25] christ so when you get in the new
[4:27] testament you're looking at the thing
[4:29] you're looking at the real thing the
[4:30] substance that in the old testament
[4:32] you're just looking at the shadow of
[4:35] now brother brown said in the message
[4:36] shalom he said the holy ghost is our
[4:38] sabbath or our rest the sabbath the
[4:40] place where you come to it you're you're
[4:42] resting
[4:43] the bible said so come unto me all you
[4:45] that labor there's that word again i'm
[4:47] gonna keep i'm gonna keep stressing
[4:48] labor
[4:49] labor before rest coming to me all you
[4:52] that labor and heavy laden i'll give you
[4:54] sabbath to your soul
[4:56] not a day paul said you that keep a day
[4:58] i'm afraid of you see that's right see
[5:00] there remaineth a rest
[5:03] unto the people of god
[5:05] a sabbath keeping
[5:07] for we which have entered into his rest
[5:09] have ceased from our
[5:11] labor from our works as god did from his
[5:16] now now on the you you look at rest when
[5:19] you know kind of compare now before the
[5:21] before the before the day of pentecost
[5:23] peter peter was doing a lot of laboring
[5:26] he like he uh when when uh he made that
[5:28] declaration to jesus said i'm i'm never
[5:31] gonna be offended of you and he was he
[5:33] he was trying to work it up within
[5:35] himself but on the day of pentecost it
[5:37] was different it was not his own
[5:39] righteousness that he was trying to work
[5:41] it was not his own things that he was
[5:43] you know
[5:44] he said i i'm not going to deny you i'm
[5:46] going to do everything i can he strike
[5:49] he strove within himself all night long
[5:51] as the people asked him about
[5:53] uh weren't you with this man and and and
[5:56] and like jesus said you're going to deny
[5:58] you're going to not deny me three times
[6:00] before the grows
[6:02] because he you know he didn't uh he
[6:04] wasn't he wasn't at rest yet rest
[6:07] is what happened on the day of pentecost
[6:08] where he came forth and he was doing
[6:10] what he could not do before
[6:12] now he was coming out proclaiming by
[6:15] revelation by the thing that he was
[6:17] resting in a revelation of jesus christ
[6:20] he said he began to identify by the
[6:22] scripture what what was happening these
[6:24] are not drunken as ye suppose this is
[6:26] that this jesus hath god raised up and
[6:29] he now where before he was afraid to
[6:32] testify that he had been with jesus now
[6:34] he boldly proclaimed where they were
[6:36] before they were hiding in that in that
[6:38] upper hiding away from everybody now he
[6:40] went out on the street boldly
[6:41] proclaiming because
[6:43] his soul was at rest
[6:45] he said therefore let all the house of
[6:47] israel know assuredly that god hath made
[6:49] that same jesus whom you have crucified
[6:51] both lord and christ
[6:54] so so brother i'm saying awakening jesus
[6:57] you say you're a christian
[6:58] i believe you are i think he's talking
[7:00] to somebody in the prayer line he said
[7:01] you believe
[7:02] what are you resting in
[7:05] some day he will raise our bodies up
[7:06] after they've absolutely completely
[7:08] perished
[7:09] if you don't believe that why'd you go
[7:11] to church see if there's no resurrection
[7:12] aren't we amongst men most miserable so
[7:15] what he's saying is we're resting we're
[7:16] resting in his word of promise
[7:19] we're resting that that's that's what we
[7:21] rest in not not that we feel something
[7:23] not that we feel good or don't feel good
[7:24] or or um that we're in church or not in
[7:27] church or anything like that but we're
[7:29] resting in what god said
[7:31] his word of promise he that believeth in
[7:33] me though he were dead yet shall he live
[7:36] i am the resurrection in life he that
[7:38] eats my flesh and drinks my blood has
[7:40] eternal life and i'll raise him up the
[7:42] last days we're resting in that revealed
[7:45] promise when the holy ghost reveals to
[7:48] you his word
[7:49] that is a rest
[7:53] and we would see jesus she said our soul
[7:55] rests solemnly upon his word
[7:58] and faith cannot be based anywhere else
[8:01] all theology and man-made isms are
[8:03] sinking sands
[8:04] and faith cannot find its resting place
[8:07] upon the shifting sands of man's
[8:11] or theology
[8:11] other words what man's idea of the
[8:13] message or the bible is we're not
[8:15] resting on on an intellectual
[8:17] understanding we're resting on a
[8:19] spiritual revealed revelation
[8:21] it's got to find his solemn resting
[8:23] place on the immovable rock of almighty
[8:26] god's word
[8:28] there's where it anchors
[8:30] god said so
[8:32] that settles it
[8:33] that's forever the truth
[8:35] now see when you look at god's word and
[8:37] it says like like we were just listening
[8:38] to brother brown say there's a promise
[8:40] that that if you repent and are baptized
[8:42] in the name of the lord jesus you shall
[8:44] receive the gift of the holy ghost you
[8:45] can rest in that
[8:46] you can take that and rest in it until
[8:49] he gives you a spiritual revelation that
[8:51] has been accomplished and then you got
[8:52] rest you can rest that god has done
[8:55] something right when you when god's word
[8:57] is it leaps off the page and you begin
[9:00] to see the things fit together and
[9:02] identify yourself in the scripture then
[9:04] that's a rest
[9:06] now
[9:07] the promise the promise of rest jesus
[9:09] gave this promise to to those that labor
[9:12] so first you gotta you gotta have that
[9:14] that that time where you're laboring he
[9:16] said come unto me all ye that labor
[9:19] and are heavy laden
[9:21] and i will give you rest
[9:24] now you can you go back and you can
[9:25] compare that story with uh so many so
[9:28] many types in the old testament so many
[9:30] shadows of the thing to come
[9:32] like the story of ruth now brother ram
[9:34] said
[9:35] he told us that you you look at that
[9:36] story of ruth her journey that she
[9:38] started off
[9:40] under justification she said i'm going
[9:43] to go with you naomi i'm going to go
[9:45] with you and i'm i'm you know i'm
[9:47] forsaking all of my past life and i'm
[9:49] going to go on you with a journey
[9:51] just justification
[9:53] now now under sanctification she started
[9:55] what did he say she did laboring and
[9:57] what is laboring a legalist so what are
[10:00] you doing your your mind and your
[10:03] thinking is actually being transformed
[10:05] you start off you're going to start off
[10:06] as a legalist why because you think you
[10:08] begin to think that the things that you
[10:10] do
[10:11] are the things that save you
[10:13] you begin your your mind is you're
[10:15] looking at like your your actions and
[10:17] things are being transformed you're now
[10:19] you want to be a christian you're coming
[10:21] to church
[10:22] and you think well now now i'm you maybe
[10:24] maybe you might even begin to say well
[10:26] i'm better than other people because
[10:27] look i'm in church and i'm doing things
[10:29] i'm laboring
[10:31] but but you're not at rest yet
[10:34] ruth under sanctification laboring a
[10:36] legalist
[10:37] and then
[10:38] ruth resting now she was laboring there
[10:41] in that field going what's she doing
[10:42] she's going through
[10:44] like you do you you you come to church
[10:46] and you hear things preached and maybe
[10:47] you don't understand it so you if you're
[10:49] laboring now you go home and you'll go
[10:50] study things out and you open up your
[10:52] bible and you go now what what were they
[10:54] talking about when they preached on
[10:56] ezekiel 36 what does it mean that god
[10:58] will take that stony heart and soften it
[11:00] up and give you a new spirit and you go
[11:01] studying it out and
[11:03] and what what what stage am i at and you
[11:05] begin to labor through the scripture
[11:07] like the bereans like ruth there in the
[11:09] field picking up the little sheaves of
[11:11] wheat she's laboring and she's trying to
[11:13] uh you know i i'll take what i can get i
[11:15] take i take what what falls off the
[11:17] masters table i walk behind these
[11:19] preachers and i'll get i'll get if i
[11:21] can't get the whole bundle at once i'll
[11:22] get the little bit that i can
[11:25] but then there came to a place where she
[11:26] was there rest she she came to a place
[11:29] where she she she laid down at boaz's
[11:31] feet and he threw his skirt over which
[11:33] is a type a shadow of the holy ghost
[11:36] that was thrown over you claiming your
[11:38] life and then he said you know you you
[11:41] wait you rest and i'm going to take care
[11:43] of everything and that's for resting
[11:46] when god gives you a revelation that
[11:48] he's the one that is in control that
[11:51] he's the one that's living the life
[11:53] through you that it's not it's not you
[11:55] you know you you're trying to do and
[11:56] trying to work and trying to you know
[11:58] you you come to church and you pay your
[12:00] tithes and you you're like i'm doing it
[12:02] i'm do i'm paying my tithes
[12:04] i'm doing the things that are required
[12:05] of a christian but then there comes a
[12:07] day where it changes
[12:09] the changes where you're it's christ and
[12:11] he's really he's really living in you
[12:14] and he's really doing it and it's not
[12:16] that you're just doing it because you're
[12:17] trying to follow a rule book or you're
[12:19] trying to follow the list of things that
[12:21] are you think are required but it's
[12:22] christ living in you
[12:24] that's rest
[12:28] now now see look look at this journey as
[12:30] we go through the the tabernacle i'm
[12:32] just looking at this little cross
[12:33] section of the tabernacle
[12:35] a lot of times we we focus a lot on the
[12:38] holy the holy of holies but most of your
[12:40] christian journey is going to take place
[12:43] in this holy place
[12:44] where there's a lot of labor going on
[12:47] and you see in this in this uh
[12:50] follow the bottom right justification
[12:52] you start off this you you change your
[12:54] direction you start going in the
[12:55] direction of god and and you alter this
[12:58] you you recognize that the sacrifice has
[13:00] been altered and then you move into the
[13:02] holy place of sanctification where
[13:04] there's a lot of labor going on what do
[13:06] you mean labor well you see that you
[13:08] look at the priest lighting the the
[13:10] candlesticks he goes up and he and he
[13:12] and he's because the candle it gets
[13:14] smokey in there and then you got to go
[13:15] tend to it
[13:17] you're constantly tending to the light
[13:18] you're trying to trying to keep the fire
[13:20] burning you go to a special meeting and
[13:23] you get real excited and you go home and
[13:25] you read about the word and everything
[13:26] but then the fire starts dying down a
[13:28] little bit and things start getting
[13:30] smoky in there and you got to go tend to
[13:31] a little bit more you got to go trim the
[13:33] lamps you got to keep tending to things
[13:35] and and and then you go over to the all
[13:38] the table of showbread and you're trying
[13:40] to study things out and you go over to
[13:42] the altar of incense and you pray and
[13:44] you're you're oh god forgive me of what
[13:46] i did today and you're you're laboring
[13:48] constantly
[13:49] because you're trying to get dressed
[13:51] you're what are you laboring for because
[13:53] there's thing there's things that are
[13:55] not clear to you there's things that you
[13:57] don't understand
[13:59] you're you're you're working toward your
[14:00] your your your labor into a place where
[14:03] god can reveal to you that there's
[14:05] enough word packed in that god can
[14:07] reveal to you
[14:08] his plan
[14:12] now look what the brotherhood said in
[14:13] revelation chapter 5 he said the luthers
[14:15] believed it by faith and come into the
[14:17] land
[14:18] but the methodist taught sanctification
[14:20] which was the legalistic standpoint of
[14:22] it see you got to do something
[14:24] now now see see how it's it's a little
[14:27] bit difficult to express
[14:29] because there ain't nothing wrong
[14:30] we got to there's got to be a change in
[14:33] your life there will be a change in your
[14:35] life
[14:36] when you begin to come to church and you
[14:37] start your sisters start wearing their
[14:39] hair longer and they and and your dress
[14:42] changes and and those kind of things you
[14:44] start looking like well look at me what
[14:46] i'm doing
[14:48] look at what i'm doing
[14:49] and that's
[14:51] you're looking at it wrong when god
[14:53] reveals to you that it's not you doing
[14:55] it
[14:55] but he is life in you making the word
[14:58] alive and he's the one doing it that's
[15:01] your rest but then you won't be looking
[15:03] around at others saying look what i'm
[15:05] doing but see a real revelation will
[15:07] humble you a real revelation brings you
[15:10] down now see he said the methodist
[15:12] taught sanctification which which was a
[15:14] higher revelation than the lutherans
[15:17] which was the legalistic standpoint of
[15:19] the cease you got it you got to do
[15:21] something
[15:22] i got to quit i got to let my hair grow
[15:24] out said the women of course they don't
[15:26] do it anymore but they did do it
[15:28] let their hair grow out
[15:30] they had to quit wearing the paints in
[15:32] their faces
[15:34] they didn't wear their skirts wrong and
[15:35] are short like the other seat he's see
[15:37] it's almost like he's he's preaching
[15:39] vote two ways you gotta do it but look
[15:42] it's a legalistic standpoint of it you
[15:44] gotta do it but don't look at the things
[15:46] that you yourself are doing it's christ
[15:48] in you
[15:49] they had to do something see that's what
[15:51] she did the state of justification the
[15:53] state of sanctification
[15:55] legalism legalism is when we base our
[15:58] justification on our own law keeping
[16:00] like we say where i'm keeping this list
[16:02] in other words this this is the now
[16:04] we're going back to labor now
[16:06] labor before rest labor you're going
[16:09] through this place of labor where you
[16:10] think that you're justified that you're
[16:12] good that you are righteous
[16:14] because you are keeping a list
[16:18] rather than based on the finished work
[16:20] of christ legalism exists when people
[16:23] attempt to secure righteousness in god's
[16:25] sight by good works
[16:27] instead you're it's what you're looking
[16:29] at instead of looking at what christ did
[16:31] on the cross for you you're looking at
[16:33] what you're doing
[16:35] legalists believe that they can earn or
[16:37] merit god's approval by performing the
[16:39] requirements of the law
[16:41] so you work and you do and you're
[16:42] laboring like an ox
[16:44] laboring trying to get to that rest and
[16:47] then god like on the day of pentecost
[16:49] comes and quickens the word that you've
[16:51] packed in while you're laboring and now
[16:54] it's alive
[16:58] brother adam said now you've got to be
[16:59] perfect
[17:01] jesus said be there for perfect even as
[17:03] your father in heaven is perfect now how
[17:05] are you going to be when you're
[17:06] continually sinning when you're
[17:07] continually doing what's wrong
[17:09] he said now this will kind of put a
[17:10] little kink in the legalist
[17:12] but notice it isn't what you do it's
[17:15] what god has done
[17:16] it's not what you do it's what he done
[17:19] you can't be perfect you can't be in
[17:21] yourself but in christ
[17:23] you are perfected
[17:24] you're not trusting in your own good
[17:26] works or your own church you belong to
[17:29] but you're trusting in the shed blood of
[17:31] the lord jesus
[17:33] there you are that's what makes you
[17:35] perfect
[17:36] there's what anchors your faith
[17:39] and what is rest
[17:41] faith
[17:42] rest is when god reveals it to you
[17:45] that's what you're resting in
[17:48] so in hebrews chapter 4
[17:50] if we keep moving on through our study
[17:53] paul says sing therefore it remaineth
[17:55] that some must enter therein
[17:57] and they to whom it was first preached
[17:59] enter not in because of unbelief
[18:02] again he limiteth a certain day saying
[18:04] in david today after so long a time as
[18:07] it is said today if you will hear his
[18:09] voice
[18:10] harden not your hearts
[18:12] or if jesus had given them rest and we
[18:13] he would he not afterward have spoken of
[18:15] another day he would have blocked out a
[18:17] day there remained therefore rest to the
[18:20] people of god there's a rest for he that
[18:22] has entered into his rest
[18:24] he also hath ceased from his own works
[18:28] as god did from his
[18:31] let us labor
[18:32] therefore you gotta labor
[18:35] you gotta have that place where you're
[18:37] laboring to study things out
[18:40] there for to enter into that rest lest
[18:42] any man fall after the same example of
[18:45] unbelief and now
[18:47] through the let the rest of these slides
[18:49] i'm gonna i got this ox because the ox
[18:52] is a symbol of labor
[18:54] and i want that just to kind of be
[18:55] burned into your mind because that's
[18:57] going to come up later as you study the
[18:59] scripture
[19:00] burn into your mind the symbol of an ox
[19:03] with labor
[19:05] an ox is laboring because when you're
[19:07] going through this place of labor it's
[19:08] like an ox plowing in the field and it's
[19:11] just it's it's going through a place of
[19:13] uh you're just moving and and and ox is
[19:16] it's like a beast of burden in it and
[19:18] it's um
[19:20] you know things are hard to be preached
[19:21] and and you just keep moving on
[19:25] through
[19:26] and i got over here hebrews chapter six
[19:28] verse one therefore leaving the
[19:29] principles of the doctrine of christ
[19:31] will just go on unto perfection not
[19:32] laying in the foundation of repentance
[19:34] from dead works because dead works is
[19:37] when it you're just you're laboring
[19:38] you're doing it to satisfy the like
[19:40] you're the requirements of your list
[19:42] of the requirements of what you think
[19:44] righteousness really is but not having
[19:47] yet come to a place of rest but it dead
[19:50] works is different from liv a living
[19:52] christ in you living it out amen
[19:57] so let's let's think about this now
[19:59] now when you're born again
[20:01] the labor doesn't stop
[20:03] it just changes
[20:05] it changes into something else
[20:07] a change is now you got you got a sword
[20:10] in your hand and you're you've got a a a
[20:13] you're a trowel thank you brother a
[20:15] trial in the other hand and you're
[20:17] you're ready to go building something
[20:19] something's being built that's why
[20:20] preachers can preach the gospel they're
[20:22] laboring people in there and they're
[20:24] abused they're laboring they're they're
[20:26] listening to the word and they're then
[20:27] and then you you know maybe you hear
[20:29] some things preached about the seven
[20:30] seals that you don't understand and or
[20:32] maybe and you go home and you begin to
[20:34] study it out or maybe you're you're
[20:36] you're you're going through all these uh
[20:38] you're working through the growth of the
[20:40] stature of a perfect man and you maybe
[20:42] you come to a place where you say well i
[20:43] seems like i'm patient
[20:45] seems like i got temperance
[20:47] and then god will let something come
[20:49] along to prove that out that maybe you
[20:51] don't really have the patience or the
[20:52] temperance that you do and until finally
[20:54] you come to a place where it's you
[20:57] realize that christ is living in you and
[20:59] you're resting because it's christ
[21:01] living in you not something that you're
[21:02] doing but it's christ now look at what
[21:05] philippians says wherefore my beloved as
[21:08] you have always obeyed not as in my
[21:09] presence only but now much more in my
[21:12] absence
[21:13] work out your own salvation
[21:16] with fear and trembling
[21:18] you got to labor
[21:20] you got to work out now i think this is
[21:21] something that sometimes we we kind of
[21:23] balk at because we want somebody to do
[21:25] all the work for us many times
[21:27] but paul's saying here he's saying i'm
[21:29] gone
[21:30] i'm not with you i'm not there to do all
[21:34] of the studying for you
[21:36] you're gonna have to do something on
[21:37] your own
[21:38] work out your own salvation it's time
[21:41] for you to get to work like an ox to
[21:44] labor in the field and go to plowing
[21:47] now now then he couples that though with
[21:49] for it is god
[21:51] which worketh in you both to will and to
[21:53] do of his good pleasure now so there you
[21:56] got almost this paradox of of you got to
[21:59] every morning when you when when when
[22:01] it's time to come to church you maybe
[22:03] maybe you don't feel like it sometimes
[22:05] but you gotta you gotta labor when you
[22:08] don't feel like it you you do it but
[22:10] it's god doing it in you it's god
[22:12] working it in you because you're born
[22:15] again and christ is the one that puts
[22:17] that he he's changed your motives and
[22:20] he's changed you so that now you want
[22:22] the word
[22:23] but then when you don't feel like it you
[22:25] you know you you're you're you you don't
[22:28] feel like maybe praying but you go pray
[22:30] because there's something in you that's
[22:31] longing to do that and you and you're
[22:34] laboring
[22:35] that's why ii peter says wherefore the
[22:37] rather brethren give diligence when
[22:39] peter's talking about going up the
[22:41] statue of a perfect man give diligence
[22:43] to make your calling in election sure
[22:46] for if you do
[22:47] these things you shall never
[22:50] fall
[22:51] it it's almost like a paradox that it's
[22:54] it's automatic but you got to do
[22:56] something
[22:57] what does diligent mean
[22:59] diligence is careful and i got this ox
[23:02] up here because i want that to be burned
[23:03] into your mind
[23:04] and ox laboring
[23:06] careful and persistent work
[23:09] or effort
[23:11] constant in effort to accomplish
[23:13] something attentive and persistent and
[23:15] doing anything
[23:17] that's
[23:18] that's why paul peter is saying that you
[23:20] get these virtues laboring
[23:23] done or pursued with persevering
[23:25] attention painstaking for example a
[23:27] diligent search of the files or we'll
[23:30] say like a diligent search of the
[23:32] scriptures
[23:33] laboring
[23:37] so that's why jesus said and well this
[23:39] will be a great place to stop he said
[23:41] coming now let's meditate this is
[23:42] fantastic look
[23:44] you before let's say before before you
[23:46] start on your on your christian journey
[23:48] you're trying to you're going through
[23:49] that place of late baby form
[23:51] sanctification trying to get to that
[23:53] place of rest studying scriptures going
[23:55] through church going through the like
[23:57] painful times and and you're like an ox
[23:59] with that that yolk on your neck
[24:02] and jesus said come unto me all ye that
[24:04] labor and are heavy laden and i will
[24:06] give you rest
[24:07] and now he says take my yoke upon you
[24:11] so now where you before you are trying
[24:13] to do things on your own
[24:15] now take my yoke upon you he's going to
[24:18] you're going to yoke yourself with him
[24:20] and he yokes yourself because this
[24:22] double yoke is one where he's
[24:25] imagine when you get born again you
[24:27] you're trying to understand scripture
[24:29] and you're trying to understand things
[24:30] but now you've got christ to help you to
[24:33] open these things up
[24:34] and you know when a ox if
[24:37] you you ever you ever seen somebody you
[24:39] know they're trying to push a car out of
[24:40] the ditch or something maybe there might
[24:41] be somebody that's that's kind of joking
[24:43] around and pushing with their finger or
[24:45] whatever while everybody else does the
[24:46] work well when you're yoked up with
[24:48] christ that's really that situation he's
[24:50] really he's the one doing the work and
[24:52] you're yoked up with him but he's the
[24:54] one that's pulling the load
[24:56] you know in one place jesus actually
[24:58] brother brown said that that when you're
[25:00] yoked with christ it's like the
[25:02] scripture says take up thy cross and
[25:04] follow me but now when you're yoked up
[25:06] with him that cross is lined it's got
[25:08] it's padded so it's not as bad anymore
[25:11] because you're doing it with a from a
[25:13] place of love and the musicians can go
[25:15] ahead and come forward
[25:16] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[25:18] for i am meek and lowly in heart and you
[25:20] shall find rest unto your souls for my
[25:24] yoke is easy and my burden is light what
[25:27] was hard before when you get the new
[25:29] birth and the scriptures begin to come
[25:31] open and become plain and what was what
[25:33] was hard before and what was a labor now
[25:36] becomes easy because you're yoked with
[25:38] christ
[25:39] you're at rest
[25:43] god bless you
[25:46] [Applause]
