========================================

inside as you keep going in your life like I said before you got no hope no more worth to you than mmm I don't know and you know what he's not gonna give you everything at one time you might get one thought a month but you know what at least you got that I'll promise you you get a revelation of the word Satan did not do that it comes from God okay so just feel just feel confident that God is the one that gives you a revelation of the word right for one who is made not after the law of carnal commandment what's Paul saying he's separating them to Levis because they came under colonel you know man and woman come together have a baby in the Levitical priesthood every man was satisfied and they ran the Levitical line or lineage this man had no lineage remember he didn't have father a mother our descent for he testified our to priest forever after the order of Melchizedek for there's very a variant where there is barely a dis annulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitability this unprofitable miss thereof we're going words Don Brown so now look what's that saying for there's very a dissing only of the commandment in other words Jesus didn't come to do away with the law but what he done was that he made the law liveable and it dissing though the commandment because the priests said hey I haven't touched a woman the Bible says in the Testaments to not commit adultery that means to literally act on the 27 I can prove all the way through the Bible that your your flesh doesn't sin before that wasn't one over we were at but but I can prove that Jesus here's the woman caught in the act of adultery Jesus said oh I didn't see it so go and sin no more but what happened when Jesus walks up to them he reads the end of the the old high priest they're like that touched a woman if they did they had to tell them hey I didn't touch the woman that middle one have not had fleshly carnal relations with nobody but my wife jesus said if you look on a woman and lust after in your heart you've already committed a dolphin none never committed the act with this so this is not the part we have to worry about Jesus is saying you better worry about that inside guy till he said if you look honor to less there you've already committed the daughter because the inside motivator anyway you know that for the law made nothing perfect then we've just been talking about that for 30 minutes the law had made nothing in the Old Testament perfect but for the bringing of a better hope did for by the which we draw nigh onto God in other words what Jesus Christ came to eradicate sin and then we fall under that receive what he give us and then we draw nigh unto God and instantly it's not without an oath he was made priest in other words he wasn't in the Levitical priesthood but he is our high priest and then here's here's he's interpolating those remember interpolating isn't the end of the parenthesis because it should read this and as much as not without an oath he was made priest by so much was Jesus made sure to have a better Testament the Paul interpolates are adds a little bit to it he's not add to the word he's riding to work okay he's not he's not add me riding from those priests were made without an oath but this women oh by him that said of him the Lord sware and will not repent in other words the high priest could have swore to you that you were forgive report the Jesus Christ when he says you're forgiven you're done you don't have to do it he don't have to go counsel with anyone a help he is the counsel thank the Lord sware him will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek now he's finishing his thought by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better Testament why the Testament was in his blood remember we're gonna take communion today jesus said thereon and the remedies that this is a new Testament in my blood which I've said it for you in other words they was enough there was life in that blood that could come back on the believer and take the sin away there was not life in an animal that could die and then that Lamb come back into our that office or that whatever could come back into the believer and clean them up for by so much with Jesus made a surety of a better Testament and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death one priest I know them come up they've reached down and they'll come up right when priest I know they'll come in though the free stuff this priest died one time and that was it do you have time to long but this man because he continually continuous ever had an unchangeable priesthood amen what a surety and changeable priesthood you know I guess it was a little I guess in freedom Levitical priesthood you did have different personalities now we know they did try to do the right thing you know that because they were under the law but I was I've been reading in chronicles and then Kings were men this person would come in and be king and and he fire all the Levites you know well Farah permanently and then he brings so many other people in then they'd bring these people in and then you bring this one in and this one to stand up and say this different what stand up and say that mm-hmm I guess it did change it didn't change the priesthood apart but they had different personalities what I'm saying is we know God's personality and that does not anything it's Anna surety that if you should hear what Christ says then he ain't gonna change it it's an unchangeable priesthood but wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him who by Christ seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such an high priest became us who is holy and harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens we're such a high priest was spitting for us the numbers that didn't become us but he difficulties but you see when did he became a high priest for us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who need not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifices Biki because remember in your Levitical your high priests had to go in and make a sacrifice for his sin first in the Old Testament then he made the atonement for the rest of the of the country now Christ didn't have to do that who needed not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the people for this he did once when he offered up himself right for the law maketh man high priests which have been permanent are but have weaknesses but the word of the oath which was sense the law make it the son who is consecrated forevermore pretty good pretty good summation now let's go now cuz I like Paul what you saying now of the things which we have spoken in other words a whole chapter 7 he's gonna sum it up this is the sum or this is the what this is what I'm talking about put it that way main point this is the main point we have such a high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven a minister of the sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man was the true tabernacle you and I think them and not man he ditched it for every high priestess ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices where him is of necessity this man have someone also to offer where he were on earth he should not be a priest in that there are priests to offer gifts according to the law no words have people they're gonna go his servant to the example and shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle for ceased a team that now make all things according to the pattern showed to be in the mouth brother Brown told us he went to the mountain got the dimensions and everything to build the tabernacle alright but now have he obtained a more excellent ministry for how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant what first covenant wasn't do this don't do that long as you don't touch a woman you're good now which was established upon better promises by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant this covenant is I'm gonna wipe your sins away pubis if you'll just come to me all ye that labor is heavy rest let heavy late and I'll give you rest which was established upon better promises what go back to the mutability of God for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been soft for the second in other words if it was finally we wouldn't be coming to church today brother they would be cutting the throats of lambs and chickens and goats making sacrifices and we're saying home over there somewhere but no now he's going to make all this plain that that you and I now come boldly to the throne the ones that entered in the bales been rent everything's been took away from and then you and I are now the tabernacle and the temple of God for finding fault with them he said behold the days come saith the Lord when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not in other words that please put this before you put them away well this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law not on a table hosting 10 commandments in your yard is nice but don't be sitting on a porch drinking a beer while you what are you doing okay you know this place that way well this is a covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those dates that the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and wrap them in their heart and I will be with them in garden they should be my people let's finish this and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and never manage brother saying know the Lord for all of shall know me from the least to the graves now that doesn't mean what is he saying here the high priest is the only one that you got back in the Old Testament concrete went in he's when I saw his Shekinah glory nobody else saw that part of God now you and I come ball into the throne you should know the Lord because if you got the new birth you got the Lord inside of you for all shall know me from the least to the greatest for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more thank God and that he said they knew come that he have made the first oh now that which they can't and waxes old is ready to vanish away all right we'll stop then we'll start right there next Sunday then barely the first covenant had also orbited the divine service and worldly sanctuary now that don't mean worldly like we say worldly that means it was down here on earth and they were bridging more during whatever it is [Music] [Applause] that's a weird day yeah bro deal it will cover some of that yes all right Hebrews chapter 7 [Music] okay alright he was having several go back to chapter six for just a minute and read let's do it let's look at this for everybody when we look at this immutability we looked at a couple of Sundays ago and thanks all of y'all for doing your job while we're gone I have not had an opportunity to listen to your gift save the best for last we want to talk about the mutability or in other words there is no it never changes we we have an unchanging God and his if he's an unchanging God then his counsel is unchangeable which means that when you have a counsel you have people because I'm getting the milk Emily when you're looking you get a council of people when you get together with and we have them you have a student council we have we're called council members elected official at the City and Guilds bill you get together you got all these different ideas that's not God you don't take counsel from no one no one changes his mind he can't even change his own mind because they said that by two but now luck but what we're getting into what we're going to get into to see more about this seal this afternoon that by two immutable things two unchangeable things remember brother man talks about to own impotence meet because God being alone is not God go back to what brother Ram said he wasn't God he went God's eyes how the worship he wasn't gone before he will himself existing he he self existed alone he wasn't even God now we're in God so now being God he has to have subjects and I like what a man said I was looking to the radio I can't remember the guys name but he'd come on its own the fish and he he's a thug Robbie's a crime and he's talking about people saying well there's no good and evil it's all of this you know well in the presence of good there has to be evil to make the good good and then the presence of evil has to make good so you can't have you can't have just where people think well there's no God and doesn't know anything going up no you got to have to you got I'll tell you you got to help me then you got a heaven two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie so he's not gonna like we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us we totally have as an anchor of the soul what that he's immutable and Paulson he's made you and you you so I'm going to see and I've been thinking about a little bit all week they have made the Seventh Seal everything in the book except their self they've made it brother Ram coming back they've made it seven thunders virtues they've made it this person they made it back they put it all out there and that's not words that that's right it's Christ in you the hope of all it's that other immutable thing because remember listen yeah we've got to take a body change and yeah we as human beings we change our mind but I listen if your soul is the soul of God it's immutable but it can't change its mind or we're another person you see what I'm gettin to that's God inside of you so I'm reading this afternoon where brother round talks about the bridegroom and the bride the Scripture speaks of one speaks of the evidence the same identical thing and in Romans eight we just went through we're gonna they said we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ whatever he gets we get okay he got these guy and human flesh so regarding him--as clay that's the whole problem but saying what a saint always do he always points back that way and always points that way memory right but not sure the guy's trying to study here we totally have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast which entered into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek continue reading for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the Most High God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him now remember that was the first which was actually Abram at the time because God has to come to you in your journey of your new birth a broom type justification and sanctification right hey bro type of gentrification in sanctification now Abraham top is wonderful circumcised so Abraham got a name change you've got a name change when you became a Christian then Abraham was circumcised to show that he had come to this place though he didn't come to a new birth but remember it's types he typed the new birth so God met Abram in his justification and sanctification just like what brother Dale was talking about last night Bob study and he'll be talking about this after that no more this morning is that what God's got to do is he's got to come in and do a work of sanctification now that's gone he comes in and he cleans that out it's not the devil the devil never gonna clean you I don't he's gonna kind of fill you up with you and him so what happened in April's journey Abram realized this Melchizedek met him when he got a victory brother Brown said if you'll read a Abraham and something I can't remember the language okay excuse me other title but he's talking about Abraham's journey through justification sanctification told them Abram means mill Cassidy God Almighty human flesh after a victory remember what happened lot got captured by a bunch of kings they took him down into a place and Abram collected his household it was just people in this household wedding with an army he just collected 300 or some people in household and he lived out live when when he came back from the slaughter of the king he didn't just run them out of the country he killed him and blessed him to whom also Abraham this Abram gave a tenth part of all cuz now look you said well what's Paul saying Abraham for probably on this island earning money Paul is writing about Abraham which there was nothing to be put and charged against Abraham when you come through the blood of Jesus Christ you look back and surely Paul being a Bible scholar knew that was a broom but Paul's looking at a finish work Paul is looking through the blood through through Calabrian looking at Abraham not Abram but Abraham finish the journey right and he met Melchizedek after the slaughter of the kings in his walk of justification and sanctification and that's the same thing you and I are going to have to meet God and because listen if you come to a baby for justification then your sins are forgiven who did that the helf did that you can't do it Satan can't do it but God just forgive you your past sins now he didn't go ahead and birth you so there's a process but he's going to but look what look what how gracious God is you you come into the justification that's why I said if you can't see this in your journey then you got to know them that you were justified in fighting in a particular place that you were sanctified in the place and that you get to receive the baptism I hold oh nothing you just come into this message and sit down in a message to you and never had an experience no you better have an experience with Jesus Christ not the way around right then that will take you to the messages and then but a justification we see this past in for chopped-off but remember brother Graham said it does nothing for the old nature it's still in there your soul is still black my brother Dale stole my anointed ones anointed ones can be anointed on their spirit creeps we've seen P in this message preached 40 years and preached seemingly good revelation and find out later on that they've been sleeping with other women and taking money from people and and now they're not the message when when I was back in but still and we all we all look at these things we go how come that happen well there's one thing for sure they were anointed but they didn't have the Holy Ghost to keep them from doing the things that they didn't do wrong okay now listen you can get trapped in some stuff there's a fine line you get trapped in some stuff but you'll quickly brother Brown said you'll quickly repent and quickly get away from get them go away with that so that's what Abram Abram beginning his journey met Melchizedek you will meet the high priest of your confession in your justification in your Saints petition all right if I got that you will meet that person you should know listen if you can't sit down I'm telling you we need to be real clear you need to be able to sit down and go right there it's where I was justified right there is where I got thanked about you don't have to remember the day the hour into place I do but you don't have to and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got to understand it that cannot be just an anointing from being sanctified to the Baptist the host is a very very very tricky place to bend so that's where Satan can still work on you because your soul is not redeemed at the sanctification so he can make you think even brother Branham tells us and brother Dale's gonna read this then you become part of a religious order when you're sanctified you want to go to church well then you say the messy Church and say well I believe that women shouldn't cut their hair and we should baptize name Lord Jesus Christ and yeah that but one true and living God well I knew that my sport paint a nice black the second so I know that cause I live through it okay I live through that I could preach it fourteen-years-old better than some people in this messy but I didn't have the hold I knew I didn't because my fruit showed twenty years from their tour twenty years later than I did okay so but now I do remember though when God when I repented I remember when got sanctified emptied me out and then I remember when he filled me up and then the word became alive is what it's telling them by last night those of you that weren't about the state you will know if you can't understand more than you understood twenty years ago everybody sitting in this room has been in this message over 20 years you you're the closest one I would assume maybe usually 20 80 99 this is 20 19 20 years you weren't there to telly so really I mean been dismissed twenty years do you still do you still you still sucked in the bottle you you still you still hung has God not reveal that's the trueness of a new birth the problem with people is and that's why I love that scripture Matthew those who endure to the end shall be saved we keep enduring and we'll keep enduring and sometimes it makes you don't have nothing but you know what you keep coming back you keep coming back you keep coming back and keep coming back you keep coming back and you keep coming back you do the things that God tells you to do and you enjoy doing them that's the big difference you enjoy doing them all right that's the whole thing if you quit enjoying coming to church you don't have a new birth you do not have anybody if you do not enjoy coming to church he oh well it's Sunday I gotta take a set-aside this day to do well you ain't got from your birth program started burning nbelievable will not cannot wait for the doors of the church to open up no no some of you live a long way away a wink tonight which is good because we have the internet to do that win but now sund'ys if you reverence God he'll read what you I promise grab watch him with your time and your offering and and you know what I'm gonna say it right now some of y'all have made one service dinner on Sunday that ain't it brother Graham said when the doors are open you should be a term an entire doors stay open from like 2 o'clock 4 o'clock to y'all not like my brakes and then you can dust ok but you just tell me that and then you can leave but like Terry said we saw that some people have on one service on Sunday most people y'all someone go already decided not to have a one service so I'm just telling you the Bible says Ashley see the Day approaching we should more want to be in Turkey that's right right and I'm just reading the Bible I'm not telling what lesson that's your opinion no it's not my thing the Bible says and more as the day approaches we should be minded together and be in church me my people like sister truly there 80 years old Grove sorry 81 throw four hours to come to church state both services she had a won't so much since he had a bucket full of excuses she could use she didn't use them then God's honored her because at 81 she's feeling pretty okay so God will honor it but now you say well I got I got problems well staying at home might be your problem but remember Abram my whole point Abram never stopped Abram went on to be Abraham he met Melchizedek twice two times he met him at the slaughter of the kings which is in justification and God is going to meet you and he's going to sanctify justify you and sanctify you but now Abram had to make the journey into Abraham to have a revelation to them all so Abram gave a tenth part of all there's you your tithing first being by interpretation king of righteousness after that also king of Salem which is king of peace now we know who that was that was the often II God Jesus Christ yeah but he was Jesus the theophany but he wasn't the outside man this Melchizedek man around here didn't die for you the flesh he had to come down through wound to be Jesus Christ to be our brother see because we can't be terrible Melchizedek but we can be heir with Jesus Christ a man a man we can't be animal Melchizedek though he'd be the high priest though he'd be the one that that takes and and heals your diseases and all these things but he cannot be your Savior this Melchizedek could not he had to become both crimes that he became Jesus Christ right and then now now listen and I'm gonna say this one more time the reason we can understand and the reason you and I can get revelation is because that man that wrote these words through these prophets is Lee than you today he's looking through your eyes reading hornies already but he's already wrote and if that doesn't become real to you then you need to get the new birth because the new birth is the birth of the word that you read it's a bird it bursts you into where you don't like we have for 50 years we have been second persons well there's God and we can't get to him because he's this great thing and then he's over there saying I'm this great dog but now I'm inside of you see even but no we have to have the faith of Abraham because look Abraham did not have the new birth he didn't have a man inside teacher he didn't have the Holy Ghost in his self he had an anointing just like an anointed one but it was a true anointing of God to carry him through that journey okay there's no one in you text Old Testament you know that no one in the New Testament had a new birth though the testator died Jesus had to die even John the Baptist did not have the new birth all right until Jesus died no one had a new birth by the hand an anointing all through the Old Testament that was an anointing that was the Christ that was above the people then he came to be with us and now he came to become the begin us now that part we were getting more even after 50 years we're trying to understand that that Christ is in us even though Paul roads if Christ in you the hope of glory we still think that's a second person or another [Music] we're missing something when we think that that we're not you say are you good are you as good as God no I'm as good as God made me and if he made me good then I gotta throw it back than him right if I'm Harrison Jordan and I throw it back to him say hey you know what I said this right and you know what our actions will show that we went absolutely this is the day of Revelation if you and I are the midstream we have to be revealed then we definitely are going to be made known so this King of this Melchizedek was a person and many people think that not a messy book with that clarity by brother Branham tell us it was a person it was the theophany of God is this Melchizedek because it says without father without mother without descent who is that about the Christ Jesus Christ the Christ alright because Jesus did have a mother a birthing mother all right without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth the priest continually now consider how great this man was brother Brennan many times you know he was do with denominational people that believe that that was just in a warrior just a priest today but brother Brown says he daddy the Bible said he was a man okay until whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoil and barely they that of the sons of Levi who received the office of the priesthood that's what we're talking about couple Sundays ago Levi was the Levitical priesthood Levi Levitical priesthood right he was in the loins of Abraham which was his great-grandfather he paid time they didn't literally pay time but what happened when he come out of it when that lineage come out of Abraham he paid tithes we were talking not too long remember preachers should pay tithe they're not exempt even the Levi's if you'll keep going in the Bible the Levi's pay the tithe back into the into the I guess you might say the Treasury and that's what I said what brother Dale does brother Dale takes the tithe he takes a salary he takes that money and he pays it right back into the church his 10% and what that 10% does it accumulates and he brings people in to preach and pays these creatures when you get paid to preach that that comes from his piloting coming back to know you I promise you you come by Daniel Stamm beliefs being a shin kicker that's a shame kicker in a message to because most most message preachers don't think well fly one said did brother day over 1 times the food iPad 2 great we all no one is exempt from vampire no one okay barely pay there are the sons of Levi who received the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people which is a commandment it is a commandment that you pay time and if you don't you break in the commandment and that's why you stroke kind of interesting you can tell people that don't really pay a lot of time for the struggle don't take any discernment for that right have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the ones of Abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them receive tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises so it's the blessing we know that and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better in other words what's Paul saying without contradiction you will be blessed if you do these things you'll be blessed of the better these two but who's the better of Jesus Christ our God and you're the lesser so you're the one that's going to be blessed by doing these things and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witness that he liveth you understand what I'm saying him men to die in other words the priest of the natural priesthood but there he receiveth them of whom in his witness that he liveth and as I may say also leave I also do receiveth I've paid tithes in Abraham so that's where you your room scriptures playing about fan ties everybody based on where he was getting the ones of his father when Melchizedek many if therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood we know it's not all the Levi's they were set up as an order to do the priestly things but they never saved one person no I was saying in the Old Testament no one so what they did is they just did what God told them to do and God covered their sin I told the next year and then what he had to go back in and cover their sin again you have to go back we'll cover that in revelation 6 because if that blood would have been sufficient they would have had the only went one time and it have been all done so what had done was it just covered our the word Capo it just covered they're saying until calibrating them when Jesus shed his blood it took care of those things right so by the Levitical priesthood no one was perfected therefore perfection were if if therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood now he's interpolating for an Andrea the people received the law they had to do that to live in Levitical priesthood had to be there what further need was there that another priest should ride after the order of Melchizedek in other words minded Christ's have to come and this was sufficient if the blood of bulls and goats was sufficient why did Christ have to come because the blood of bulls and ghost was the substitute that was a human life I mean I'm sorry that was a nature life that when it went away it just meant we needed somebody to die that could release a life that could come back inside of me and clean me up and that's what Christ only Christ could do better right so that's so that it's so profound but it's so simple how that all works it was a substitute until Christ came itself but it that would be what further need was there then another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek and not be calling after the order of Aaron for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law for he of whom these things are spoken for 10 to the know the tribe of which no man gave of 10 that said the author he understand what he's saying okay Jesus Christ did not come from the Levitical priesthood he came from the tribe of Judah so it says for he Christ of whom these things are spoken pertaining to another tribe he stomach the Levitical tribal abetik Levitical now he's saying this person then come of which no man gave attendance at the altar in other words Judah did to do with the washing the pots and doing the sacrifices Christ came from the tribe of juda you would think you'd come from Levi but remember Jesus had to come under the law and Judah was the lawgiver right for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah that answered your question excuse me know which try Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood see if you just would have come to caucus and tsukasa I come from the tribal Eva I come from a little bit of a priesthood conference what it said my side the Bible tells it's going to come from from in other words that come from between the legs of Judith what it said really what it said come out from spring from Judah but now remember Jesus didn't come really from the tribe of Judah Joseph came from the crowd you did okay and he had nothing to do but you still gotta run your types you got to see that he did come out he was the Lion of the tribe of Judah so he didn't come anyway that they told it said he would be coming so they didn't think it was Christ they think it was Jesus Christ other thing for the Lord sprang out of Judah of which crime oh just paid nothing concerning priesthood and it is yet far more evident for that after the symbol to to Melchizedek there arose another priest simple to all right our likeness I guess you can say that let's look at what foot just like this all right a milk as it arises another creeps who has made not after the law carnal commandment now look all other priests came carnally by man and woman okay except this one Jesus Christ who is made not after the law carnal commandment our normal human doings but after the power and endless life what we come here and have to receive the new birth like we've talked about last night that all those couple birds that we were talking about you know you you see these people in the message then you know they were born with eternal life and all this was it's the eternal seed well brother brown says you would these that you were born to cook of Earth and you had to be changed into a week okay they don't read them I've never I've never seen anybody even read those quotes they just bury them underneath the pile you know but you know what it's our job to pull them out put them on top all right mmm but after the power and in this life in other words Jesus came here with each our life and you did not he did but now we receive eternal life and it's the same eternal life he had so it's not through definite eternal life I don't see how we don't I don't see how that's why I said the new birth birth through the new birth is the most real prompting and even when he said that 50 60 years ago he says one of the most the old crop subject because he had the bag to stay in just shake a hand he had the Pentecostal saying you gotta shout vegan tongue you had to master this you hadn't do this you had all these different ones and man has just taught so scattered but and now in the message it's the same way they don't go back to justification thinking about to hold up so it usually the message don't you please don't send profit didn't you're born again you have to because you're agreeing with the word you're agreeing with the letter and it will prove and the letter killeth I tried but it will prove that it went on down
